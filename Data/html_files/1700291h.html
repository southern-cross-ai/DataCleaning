    Love In Idleness</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  can any one hope to transfer that to canvas?&rdquo; asked the artist, surveying the  many-coloured earth and sky and sea with despairing eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Easily  enough,&rdquo; replied the girl at his elbow, &ldquo;those who see twice as vividly as others,  can make others see once as vividly as they do. That is what we call genius.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  large word for my small capabilities, Miss Enistor. Am I a genius?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ask  yourself, Mr. Hardwick, for none other than yourself can answer truly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Outside  his special gift the artist was not over clever, so he lounged on the yielding  turf of the slope to turn the speech over in his mind and wait results. This  tall solidly built Saxon only arrived at conclusions by slow degrees of  laborious reflection. With his straight athletic figure, closely clipped fair  hair and a bronzed complexion, against which his moustache looked almost white,  he resembled a soldier rather than a painter. Yet a painter he was of some  trifling fame, but being only moderately creative, he strove to supply what was  wanting by toilsome work. He had not so much the steady fire of genius as the  crackling combustion of talent. Thus the grim Cornish country and the  far-stretching Atlantic waters, so magically beautiful under an opalescent  sunset, baffled him for the moment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have the beginnings of genius,&rdquo; he finally decided, &ldquo;that is, I can see for  myself, but I cannot pass the vision on to others by production.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Half  a loaf is better than none,&rdquo; said Miss Enistor soothingly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not so sure that your proverb is true, so I reply with another. If indeed  appetite comes with eating, as the French say, it is useless to invite it with  half a loaf, when, for complete satisfaction, one requires the whole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is something in that,&rdquo; admitted the girl, smiling, &ldquo;but try and secure your  desired whole loaf by sitting mousey-quiet and letting what is before you sink  into your innermost being. Then you may create.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Crossing  his legs and gripping his ankles, Hardwick, seated in the approved attitude of  a fakir, did his best to adopt this advice, although he might well despair of  fixing on canvas the fleeting vision of that enchanted hour. From the cromlech,  near which the couple were stationed, a purple carpet of heather rolled down to  a winding road, white and dusty and broad. On the hither side of the loosely  built wall which skirted this, stretched many smooth green fields, divided and  subdivided by boundaries of piled stones, feathery with ferns and coarse  grasses. Beyond the confines of this ordered world, a chaos of bracken and  ling, of small shrubs and stunted trees, together with giant masses of silvery  granite, islanded amidst a sea of gold-besprinkled gorse, tumbled pell-mell to  the jagged edge of the cliffs. Finally, the bluish plain of ocean glittered spaciously  to the far sharp horizon-line. Thence rose billowy clouds of glorious hues  threaded with the fires of the sinking sun, heaping themselves in rainbow tints  higher and higher towards the radiant azure of the zenith. No ship was on the  water, no animals moved on the land, and even the grey huddle of houses, to  which the smooth level road led, appeared to be without inhabitants. For all  that could be seen of sentient life, the two on the hilltop were alone in this  world of changeful beauty: the Adam and Eve of a new creation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo;  murmured the girl, to whom this stillness suggested thoughts, &ldquo;around us are  nature-spirits, invisible and busy, both watchful and indifferent. Oh, Mr.  Hardwick, how I should love to see the trolls, the pixies, the gnomes and the  nixies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rhyme,  if not reason,&rdquo; laughed the artist lazily, &ldquo;one must have the eye of faith to  see such impossible things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Impossible?&rdquo;  Miss Enistor shrugged her shoulders and declined to combat his scepticism  beyond the query of the one word. As that did not invite conversation, Hardwick  gave himself up to the mere contentment of looking at her. Amidst the warm  splendours of the hour, she somehow conveyed to him the sensation of a grey and  pensive autumn day, haunting, yet elusive in its misty beauty. He was wholly  unable to put this feeling into words, but he conceived it dimly as a subtle  blurring of the picture she had bidden him create. His love for her was like a  veil before his conception, and until that veil was removed by his surrender of  the passion, the execution of the landscape on canvas was impossible. Yet so  sweet was this drawback to his working powers that he could not wish it away.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet  it was strange that the girl should be attractive to a man of his limitations,  since her alluring qualities were not aggressively apparent. A delicate oval  face, exquisitely moulded, with a transparent colourless skin, and mystical  eyes of larkspur blue, were scarcely what his blunt perceptions approved of as  absolute beauty. Slim and dainty and fragile in shape and stature, her unusual  looks suggested a cloistered nun given to visions or some peaked elfin creature  of moonlight and mist. She might have been akin to the fairies she spoke about,  and even in the strong daylight she was a creature of dreams ethereal and  evanescent. Hardwick was much too phlegmatic a man to analyse shadows. A Celt  would have comprehended the hidden charm which drew him on; the Saxon could  only wonder what there was in the girl to impress him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are not my ideal of beauty, you know, Miss Enistor,&rdquo; he said in such a puzzled  way as to rob the speech of premeditated rudeness; &ldquo;yet there is something  about you which makes me adore you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  girl flushed and shrugged her shoulders again. &ldquo;What a flamboyant word is &lsquo;adored&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is the only word I can use,&rdquo; said Hardwick stoutly. &ldquo;The Venus of Milo,  Brynhild in the Volsung poem, Jael who slew Sisera, Rubens&rsquo; robust nymphs:  these were the types which appealed to me&mdash;until I met you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  complimentary to my small commonplace looks! What caused you to change your  mind, Mr. Hardwick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Something  you possess, which is not apparent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  talk in riddles. What attracts any one must be apparent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  that is uncertain. I am not a deep thinker, you know. But there is such a thing  as glamour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is. But you are not the man to comprehend the meaning of the word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  admit that: all the same I feel its influence&mdash;in you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said the girl indifferently.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor  do I. Yet the feeling is here,&rdquo; and he touched his heart. &ldquo;If I could only  shape that feeling into words,&rdquo;&mdash;he hesitated and blushed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  might be able to tell you much&mdash;Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  do you use my Christian name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  not? We are man and woman on a hillside, and not over-civilised beings in a  drawing-room. You are Alice: I am Julian. It is quite simple.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  too intimate,&rdquo; she objected, &ldquo;you have known me only six months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you reckon knowledge by Time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have no knowledge: you confessed as much lately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hardwick  looked at her earnestly. &ldquo;I have this much, that I know how deeply I love you,  my dear!&rdquo; and he took her hand gently between his palms.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  let it lie there undisturbed, but did not return his pressure. For a few  moments she looked straightly at the sunset. &ldquo;I am sorry to hear you say that,&rdquo;  was her calm remark when she did decide to speak.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because  I can never love you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Love  can create love,&rdquo; urged Julian, again pressing her hand and again receiving no  answering caress.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  between you and me. You may be fire, but I am not tow to catch alight.&rdquo; The  flush had disappeared from her face, leaving it pure and white and calm to such  a degree that the man dropped her hand. It was like holding a piece of ice, and  he felt chilled by the aloofness of touch and look. &ldquo;But you are a woman,&rdquo; he  said roughly in his vexation, &ldquo;you must know what love means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t: really I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Alice hugged her knees and stared with the sublime  quietness of an Egyptian statue at his perturbed countenance. As he did not  answer, she continued to speak in a deliberate way, which showed that his  proposal had not touched her heart in the least. &ldquo;My mother died when I was  born, and I had Dame Trevel in the village yonder as my foster-mother until I  was ten years of age. Then my father sent me to a Hampstead boarding school for  eleven years. I returned only twelve months ago to live at Tremore&rdquo;&mdash;she nodded  towards a long low grey house, which basked on a neighbouring hilltop like a  sullen reptile in the sunshine.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  your father&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  father,&rdquo; interrupted the girl in a melancholy tone, &ldquo;has no love for any one  but himself. At times I think he hates me for causing the death of my mother by  being born.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Surely  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  you have seen my father. I leave you to judge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hardwick  was puzzled how to reply. &ldquo;He is not a man who shows his feelings, you know,&rdquo;  he said delicately.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think he has any feelings to show,&rdquo; replied Alice indifferently. &ldquo;I am  used to his neglect, and so have schooled myself to be quietly agreeable  without expecting any demonstrations of affection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hardwick  nodded. &ldquo;I have noticed, when dining at Tremore, that you are more like  well-bred acquaintances than father and daughter. Perhaps,&rdquo; he added in a  dreamy tone, &ldquo;that is what first made me fall in love with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  see,&rdquo; said Miss Enistor ironically, &ldquo;you have come across the line of  Shakespeare which says that pity is akin to love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have never read Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Hardwick simply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a  clever chap, you know. But you looked so forlorn in that dismal house, and  seemed so starving for kind words and actions, that I wanted to take you away  with me and make you happier. Yes,&rdquo; the artist quite brightened at his own  perspicuity, &ldquo;that is what drew me to you&mdash;a desire to give you a really good  time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  looked at him gravely, but with a suspicion of a smile on her pale lips. &ldquo;Do  you know, Julian, that I believe you to be a good man.&rdquo; The artist blushed  again: he had the trick of blushing on occasions, which showed him to possess  still the modesty of boyhood. &ldquo;Oh, I say,&rdquo; he murmured almost inaudibly; then  to cover his confusion added: &ldquo;You call me Julian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Alice nodded her head in a stately way. &ldquo;Henceforth let us be the greatest of  friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lovers,&rdquo;  he urged, &ldquo;true honest lovers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  Julian. We would be neither true nor honest as lovers. Our marriage would not  be one of those made in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are  any marriages made in heaven?&rdquo; he asked somewhat cynically.</p>
  <p align="left">She  looked at him in surprise. &ldquo;Of course. When one soul meets another soul capable  of blending with it, that is a heavenly marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well  then,&rdquo; he cried impetuously, &ldquo;my soul and your soul?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  shook her head. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t strike the same note: we are not in harmony, Julian.  As friends we can esteem one another, but as lovers, as man and wife, you would  end in boring me as I should finally bore you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One  would think you were fifty to hear you talk so,&rdquo; said Hardwick crossly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you reckon knowledge by Time?&rdquo; she asked, harking back to the phrase he had  used earlier in the conversation.</p>
  <p align="left">He  had no reply ready. &ldquo;Still it is odd to hear a girl of twenty-one talk as you  do, Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are speaking of my new suit of clothes. I am as old as the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  that is the queer stuff your father talks. He believes in reincarnation, doesn&rsquo;t  he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  does, and so do I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  wonder that you can. A sensible girl like you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear Julian, you speak without knowledge,&rdquo; she interrupted placidly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  can&rsquo;t be knowledge which can&rsquo;t be proved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think you must be a reincarnation of Nicodemus,&rdquo; retorted Miss Enistor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is no answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now  how can I give you an answer, when you have not the capability of grasping the  answer, Julian? If a peasant wanted a mathematical problem proved to him, he  would have to learn mathematics to understand it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  I suppose so. But you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  mean that you have to live the life to understand the doctrine. Christ said  that two thousand years ago, and it is as true to-day as it was then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">With  his slow habit of thinking Hardwick had to revolve this speech in his mind  before replying. Alice, with an impish look of mischief on her face, laughed  also to prevent his answering. &ldquo;I am taking you into deep water and you will be  drowned,&rdquo; she said lightly, &ldquo;suppose you begin your picture.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said the man soberly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like painting the picture. I don&rsquo;t believe  I ever could,&rdquo; and he looked at the fading glories of sea and land regretfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Next  time you are born you will be a genius,&rdquo; said Miss Enistor cheerfully, &ldquo;as you  are building up in this life the brain required by a master-painter. Meantime I  wish you to be my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  it is hard to decline from love to friendship, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No  &lsquo;buts.&rsquo; Friendship is love from another point of view.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  my point of view.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  raised an admonitory finger. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be selfish,&rdquo; she said severely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Selfish?  I? How can I be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By  wishing me to give for your gratification what I cannot give for my own. I  cannot love you as you desire, because there is not that spiritual link between  us which means true love. Therefore to make me happy, if you really love me,  you should be prepared to sacrifice yourself to the lower feeling of  friendship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is too high for me,&rdquo; murmured Hardwick despondingly, &ldquo;but I see that you won&rsquo;t  have me as your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly  not. I want a man to love me, not to pity me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t exactly pity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes  it is,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;you are sorry for me because I live in a dull house with  a neglectful father. It is very nice of you to think so, and it is still nicer  to think that you are willing to help me by tying yourself to a woman you do  not really love. But I can&rsquo;t accept that sacrifice. You must be my friend,  Julian&mdash;my true honest friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hardwick  glanced into her deep blue eyes, and unintelligent as he was in such subtle  matters read his answer therein. &ldquo;I shall do my best,&rdquo; he said with a deep  sigh; &ldquo;but you must give me time to cool down from passion to friendship. I  want you to be my wife, and like all women you offer to be a sister to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Or  I will be your cousin if the relation will suit you better,&rdquo; said the girl,  laughing outright at his rueful looks.</p>
  <p align="left">Julian  took offence. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t pity me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  at all, since your feeling is not one of genuine love,&rdquo; was the cool response. &ldquo;I  would if it were.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One  would think you were a hardened woman of the world to hear you speak in this  way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps  I was a woman of the world in my last incarnation, Julian. I seem to have  brought over a great deal of common sense to this life. You are a dear, sweet,  placid thing, but although you have seen more of human nature and worldly  existence this time than I have, you don&rsquo;t know half so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Alice,  you are conceited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah,  that speech shows you are yet heart-whole, Julian. If you were really in love  you would never dare to speak so to your divinity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  I daresay I shall get over it. But it&rsquo;s hard on a fellow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  at all. Hard on your vanity perhaps, but vanity isn&rsquo;t you. Come,&rdquo; Alice sprang  to her feet and took up her smart silver-headed cane, &ldquo;the sun will soon go  down and I must get home. We are friends, are we not?&rdquo; she held out her hand  smiling.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course we are.&rdquo; Hardwick bent to kiss her hand and she snatched it away  swiftly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  isn&rsquo;t friendship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  with you friendship means: &lsquo;You may look, but you mustn&rsquo;t touch.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo;  said Miss Enistor lightly, &ldquo;consider me if you please as a valuable Dresden  china ornament under a glass shade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Julian  heaved another sigh and began to collect his painting materials. &ldquo;I must if I  must,&rdquo; he admitted grudgingly; &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t another man, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  face of the girl grew grave. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t another man whom I love, if that is  what you mean,&rdquo; she said, reluctantly. &ldquo;I have not yet met with my Prince, who  will wake me to love and beauty. But there is a man who wants, as you do, to be  the Prince.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh  hang him, who is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don  Pablo Narvaez!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  old mummy. Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is both possible and disagreeable. He hinted the other day that he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Loved  you? What impertinence!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Alice dryly, &ldquo;he did not commit himself so far. But he hinted that he would  like me to be his wife. My father afterwards told me that it would be a good  match for me, as Don Pablo is wealthy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wealthy  be blessed, Alice,&rdquo; rejoined Hardwick with great heat. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to take  your husband from a museum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t and I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied with great determination, &ldquo;and for that reason  I wish you to be my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why,  what can I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stand  by me. If my father insists upon my marrying Don Pablo, you must say that I am  engaged to you, and this will give you the right to interfere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hardwick  packed his traps, and swung up the hill on the home-path alongside the girl. &ldquo;How  can you ask me to take up such a position when you know that I love you, Alice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  I thought that you did I should not ask for your help, Julian. But in your own  heart you know that you really do not love me. It is only what you call the  glamour of my personality that has caught you for the moment. It is not  improbable,&rdquo; she went on musingly, &ldquo;that there may be some slight link between  us dating from our meeting in former lives, but it is not a strong enough one  to bring us together this time as man and wife!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  this mystical talk makes me tired,&rdquo; cried the painter in quite an American way,  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s silly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  it is from your point of view,&rdquo; said Miss Enistor promptly, &ldquo;let us get down to  what you call common sense in your robust Anglo-Saxon style. I want you to  stand between me and Don Pablo in the way I suggest. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  That is&mdash;give me a day or two to think the matter over. I am flesh and blood, you  know, Alice, and not stone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  nonsense, you deceive yourself,&rdquo; she retorted impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I tell you  that if I thought your feeling for me was really genuine I should not be so  wicked as to risk your unhappiness? But I know you better than you do yourself.  If you loved me, would you have chatted about this, that and the other thing so  lightly after I had rejected you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is something in that,&rdquo; admitted Hardwick, as Alice had done previously with  regard to his whole-loaf argument. &ldquo;Well, I daresay I shall appear as your  official lover. Don Pablo shan&rsquo;t worry you if I can help it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thanks,  you dear good boy,&rdquo; rejoined the girl gratefully and squeezed the artist&rsquo;s arm.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel fire running through your veins when I touch you, Julian?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Hardwick stolidly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t  your heart beat nineteen to the dozen: haven&rsquo;t you the feeling that this is  heaven on earth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  a bit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  dropped his arm with a merry laugh. &ldquo;And you talk about being in love with me!  Can&rsquo;t you see now how wise I was to refuse you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Hardwick reluctantly, for he felt that she was perfectly right in her  diagnosis; &ldquo;there may be something in what you say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is everything in what I say,&rdquo; she insisted; &ldquo;however, I shall give you another  chance. Catch me before I reach Tremore and I shall be your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Before  Hardwick could accept or refuse, she sprang up the narrow winding path as  lightly as Atalanta. More out of pique than absolute desire the artist  followed. Although he now began to see that he had taken a false Eros for the  true one, he resolutely sped after the flying figure, if only to have the  pleasure of refusing the prize when he won it. But he might as well have  attempted to catch an air-bubble. Alice was swifter than he was, and ran in a flying  way which reminded him of a darting swallow. Down the declivity she dropped,  following the twists of the pathway amongst the purple heather, and sprang  across the brawling stream at the bottom of the valley before he was half-way  down. Then up she mounted, with an arch backward glance, to scale the hill  whereon Tremore gloomed amidst its muffling trees. At the gate set in the  mouldering brick wall he nearly caught her, for pride winged his feet. But she  eluded his grasp with a laugh and disappeared amongst the foliage of the  miniature forest. When next she came in sight, he beheld her standing at the  sombre porch of the squat mansion binding up her tresses of black hair, which  had become loose with her exertions.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t love me,&rdquo; panted Alice, who had scarcely got her breath, &ldquo;if you did I  should have been in your arms by this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pouf!&rdquo;  puffed Hardwick, wiping his wet brow. &ldquo;Pouf! pouf! pouf!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  that all you have to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is all I am able to say. Pouf! Pouf! Well, my dear girl, Saul went to look for  his asses and found a kingdom. I went to look for a kingdom of love and find an  ass&mdash;in myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh  no! no!&rdquo; protested Alice, rather distressed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh  yes! yes! The love-mood has come and gone in the space of an afternoon, Miss  Enistor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Alice  to you, Julian,&rdquo; and she held out her hand.</p>
  <p align="left">The  artist did not attempt to kiss it this time. &ldquo;Brother and sister,&rdquo; he said,  giving the hand a hearty shake, &ldquo;and official lover when necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a bargain,&rdquo; replied Miss Enistor beaming, and so it was arranged.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_II"><b>Chapter II</b></a><b><br>
    The Prophecy</b></h2>
  <p align="left">From  the hilltop where Alice and her rejected lover had conversed, the house called  Tremore could be plainly seen in its grey nakedness. But on the other side, in  front and at the back, it was screened from the salt Atlantic winds by a dismal  wood of stone-pines, yews, cypress-trees and giant cedars, planted by various  Enistors in the long-distant past, when they had first set up their tent on the  waste moorland. The gloomy disposition of the race could be seen, not only in the  funereal types of trees chosen for sheltering the mansion, but in the grim look  of the mansion itself. Never was there so dreary a place.</p>
  <p align="left">Tremore  means &ldquo;great dwelling&rdquo; in the Celtic tongue, but the name could only apply to  this particular house from the unusual space of ground it covered, since it was  only one storey high. Built of untrimmed granite blocks and roofed with dull  hued slates, it stretched in a narrow line towards the rear of the hill on  which it stood. Here it divided into two other narrow lines, forming on the  whole the exact shape of the letter &ldquo;Y.&rdquo; One of the forks contained the  kitchen, the servants&rsquo; sleeping apartments and the domestic offices: the other  held the bedrooms of the gentry, while the main stem of the letter was made up  of drawing-room, library, sitting-room and dining-room. It was an odd place  quaintly planned and curiously built: but then the Enistors were odd people.</p>
  <p align="left">One  markedly strange thing amongst others was the absence of vegetation about the  house, since nothing would grow near it. Flowers were conspicuous by their  absence, turf was wanting, and not even weeds would flourish. The very trees  stood aloof in sulky darkness, leaving the building isolated in an arid space  of beaten earth. There it stood on the bare ground with its heavy porch, its  thick walls and many small windows, bleak in its nakedness for want of draping  ivy. True enough there was a kitchen-garden and a small orchard at the back,  beyond the screen of trees, which flourished tolerably, but round the house  greenery was wanting, as if the place was cursed. Perhaps it was, as the  Enistors had borne a sinister reputation for generations. But whatever the  reason might be, Tremore might have been built in the desert from the way in  which it lay like a sullen snake on the barren earth. And a two-headed snake at  that, like some demon of a fairy tale.</p>
  <p align="left">The  interior of this undesirable mansion was desperately gloomy, as all the rooms  were small with low ceilings, and for the most part panelled with black oak  dull and unpolished. The kitchen and servants&rsquo; rooms were more agreeable, as  here Mr. Enistor had conformed to modern ideas of cheerfulness so far as to  paper and tile the walls brightly. But his own particular portion of the house  he would not allow to be touched, and although it was comfortable enough, it  was decidedly depressing, with its sombre tints and stuffy atmosphere. Often  did Alice leave its dark chambers and its dismal surroundings to breathe freely  on the vast spaces of the moors. East and West and North and South stretched  the treeless lands, covered with heather and dangerous with the shafts of  worked-out mines. The village of Polwellin below belonged to the Enistors, and  over it and its inhabitants the present head of the old family exercised a feudal  sway. But beyond this particular collection of dwellings, containing one  hundred people, more or less, there was no house or hamlet for some leagues.  Perchton, a watering-place haunted by artists, was the nearest town, and that  was ten miles distant. Tremore would have suited a misanthrope, but it was not  a place wherein Alice cared to live. She was young and inclined to mix with her  fellow creatures, but never did any chance come by which she could enter  society. It was no wonder that the girl was peaked and pining, and could see  things invisible to the ordinary person. Isolation was unhealthy for one of her  temperament.</p>
  <p align="left">Seated  at the heavy mahogany table, whence, in old-fashioned style, the cloth had been  removed for dessert, Alice almost regretted that she had not accepted Hardwick&rsquo;s  proposal to remove her from such sad surroundings. The dull carved panelling of  the walls, the sombre family portraits, the cumbersome furniture, together with  the lowness of the ceiling and the limited space of the room, stifled her and  depressed her spirits to such a degree that she could scarcely eat. Mr. Enistor  and Don Pablo&mdash;the latter dined at Tremore on this particular night&mdash;were in  accurate evening dress, and the whole apartment bore an aspect of good-breeding  and stately ceremonial. The host was attached to the customs of his ancestors,  and his meals were always served with quite royal etiquette. And by the light  of the many wax candles in silver holders which illuminated the room&mdash;Mr.  Enistor would have nothing to do with lamps&mdash;Alice looked curiously at the two  men, whose want of vitality, as she vaguely thought, drew the life-power from  herself.</p>
  <p align="left">She  was wrong as regarded her father, for Korah Enistor was a handsome, healthy man  in the prime of life, and had plenty of vitality in his robust frame. He looked  somewhat austere with his dark hair, scarcely touched with white, his dark eyes  and powerful face, which lacked colour as much as her own did. Like Hardwick,  the man resembled a soldier, as he was tall and lean, well-built and active.  Also, he possessed the imperious manner of one accustomed to command men, and  spoke in a slow deliberate manner with compelling glances of his dark eyes. The  most casual observer would have noted that here was a strong personality given  to dominate rather than to obey. All the same, Alice noticed that her  strong-willed father pointedly deferred to Don Pablo Narvaez, in a way which  argued that he rendered him obedience. It was strange that she should entertain  this idea seeing that the Spaniard was as frail as Enistor was strong, and did  not at all look like one who could, or would, rule so aggressive a personality.  This odd deference had puzzled her on previous occasions, but to-night the  feeling that her father was thrall to Don Pablo was particularly strong.</p>
  <p align="left">A  breath, she thought, could have blown the guest away like thistledown, so frail  and weak did he appear. What his age was she could not guess, but conceived  that he was an octogenarian. His scanty white hair, his shrunken figure, his  small wrinkled face, and the false teeth which showed when he smiled, all  favoured this belief. Don Pablo was like an expiring flame, which the slightest  breath might extinguish, and the only thing, hinting to the girl&rsquo;s mind at  enduring life, were his eyes. These were of a brighter blue than her own,  extraordinarily large and piercing, so that few could bear their direct gaze.  The idea entered Alice&rsquo;s head at the moment that here was a bunch of blooming  flowers in a cracked vase of great age, or to be less fanciful, she told  herself that Narvaez had a weak body dominated by a powerful will which kept  the life intact. She could imagine him stepping out of that fragile shape, and  still be alive, more powerful and more vitalised in another. His brain was clear,  his speech was incisive, and always he used his dominating eyes to compel all  those he gazed at to surrender to the spell of his powerful mind. There was  something sinister about his interior youthfulness and exterior senility.</p>
  <p align="left">The  girl both hated and dreaded him. Being sensitive she was responsive to  influences which a coarser nature&mdash;say that of Hardwick&mdash;would never feel. Don  Pablo impressed her as something terrible in spite of his weak looks. His frail  body was only the jungle, as it were, that concealed the tiger, and she could  imagine him putting forth powers whose force would shatter the aging tenement.  What such powers might be she did not know, as he revealed nothing of his  dominating nature to her. But she vaguely felt that what force he possessed was  deadly evil, and would be used for purely evil purposes. Therefore, warned  instinctively by her pure soul, she kept out of his way as much as possible.  The stealthy attempts of her father to bring youth and age together, Alice  resisted as best she could. But it was difficult to fight against two such  commanding natures, and all the time there was the insistent feeling of being  drawn into darkness. Alice often blamed herself for thinking in this hostile  way of her father, but could never get rid of her doubts. It was firmly rooted  in her mind that Narvaez and Enistor were dwelling in an atmosphere of evil,  which they wished to extend so as to include herself. At the moment the  pressure was particularly strong, and she sighed with weariness as the invisible  forces came up against her. Hardly had the sound left her lips when Don Pablo  glanced swiftly at his host.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are tired, Alice,&rdquo; said Enistor, rising to open the door. &ldquo;The heat is  oppressive to-night. Take a turn in the garden and you will feel better. Is  your head aching?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  father,&rdquo; replied the girl almost inaudibly, and glided out of the room like an  unquiet ghost to seek the life-giving moorland air.</p>
  <p align="left">Her  father returned to the table in his stately fashion, and poured himself out a  fresh glass of water. On the shining mahogany there were no decanters of wine:  only dishes of fruit, crystal jugs of water, and the three empty coffee-cups.  Neither Narvaez nor his host drank any alcoholic liquor: they did not indulge  in smoking and were extremely temperate in eating. An ordinary man would have  missed the smiling good-fellowship which is usually to be found at a  dinner-table. Had these two even laughed outright they would have appeared more  human. But they did not, and throughout their conversation maintained a  sinister calmness disconcerting in its aloofness from the chatter and merriment  of commonplace mortals. Yet somehow this profound quietness seemed to suit the  room with its menacing atmosphere.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is difficult,&rdquo; murmured Don Pablo, with a glance at the door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  not impossible,&rdquo; returned Enistor, answering the thought rather than the words.  These two were versed in mind-reading beyond the ordinary.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is as it may be, my friend!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  frowned. &ldquo;You mean her innocence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  it necessary for you to put that into words?&rdquo; demanded the older man in a  mocking way; &ldquo;of course I mean her innocence. That very purity which makes the  girl so valuable to me is the wall which protects her from the influence I wish  to exercise over her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Constant  dropping of water wears away a stone, Master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  proverb does not apply in every case,&rdquo; retorted the other darkly. &ldquo;I tell you  that I am helpless before your daughter. I am too old for her to love me,  therefore her heart is safe. She is not greedy for money, or admiration, or  position, or dress, or for half a dozen things which would tempt an ordinary  girl. There is no foothold to be obtained.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  host cast an uneasy glance round, and his eyes grew piercing, as if he would  force the invisible to become apparent. &ldquo;She is guarded, we know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez&rsquo;  wrinkled face grew even darker than before. &ldquo;Yes, she is guarded. I am aware of  the power that guards her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  you have said several times, Master. Why not explain more fully?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  time has not yet come to explain. If you were advanced enough to read the  Akashic Records, then you might see much that would explain things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  nodded gloomily. &ldquo;I understand. The present situation is the outcome of the  past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Everything  in life is an outcome of the past,&rdquo; said Narvaez, &ldquo;even a neophyte such as you  are should be certain of that. Cause and effect govern all things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  if you would explain the cause, I might see how to deal with the effect,  Master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  daresay,&rdquo; returned the other dryly, &ldquo;but in spite of my superior knowledge, I  am not yet omnipotent, Enistor. I can read a trifle of the records, but not  easily. There are veils before my eyes which prevent me from knowing the exact  state of affairs which has brought things to this pass in this set of lives. All  I can say is that you and I and your daughter, together with two other people,  were in Chaldea over five thousand years ago, and the lives then are linked  with the lives now. The Karma of that period has to be worked out while we are  all in the flesh to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you know who the other two people are?&rdquo; asked Enistor eagerly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know one. He is powerful, and hostile to you and to me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  does not follow the Left-hand Path then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  He is a White Magician. You will see him some day when the hour strikes. I am  teaching you all I can so that you may be able to confront him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not afraid of any one,&rdquo; snapped Enistor sharply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  you have courage enough,&rdquo; admitted Narvaez, &ldquo;but knowledge must be added to  that, if you are to be victorious. As to the other person who has to play a  part in the working out of this Karma&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well!  Well! Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know who or what he is,&rdquo; confessed the other.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is a man then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  I know that much!&rdquo; Narvaez drank a glass of water, and rose with an effort as  if his bones pained him. &ldquo;We had better understand the situation.&rdquo; In spite of  his mind-reading Enistor could not understand and said as much with a puzzled  air. Narvaez laughed softly for a moment and then became his usual calm self. &ldquo;I  refer to the position on the physical plane of you and myself and those  surrounding us&mdash;the flesh and blood puppets I mean with which we have to deal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are  they puppets?&rdquo; demanded Enistor dubiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One  is not. You can guess that I mean our powerful adversary. But the others&mdash;bah!&rdquo;  he swept the air with one lean hand. &ldquo;I think I can deal with them, if you give  me your assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have promised to give it&mdash;at a price,&rdquo; said Enistor tartly.</p>
  <p align="left">The  guest stared at him with a sphinx-like expression. &ldquo;I know your price and you  shall have your price,&rdquo; he dropped into his chair again with an air of fatigue,  and his eyes grew brighter than ever. &ldquo;Listen, my friend. I came here from  Spain three years ago in search of you, as I learned by my arts that you would  be useful to me. You have the blood of my race in your veins, as you know,  since that Spanish sailor, who was wrecked on these coasts in a galleon of the  Great Armada, married your ancestress from whom you are descended.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know all this, Master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Quite  so, but I wish to refresh your memory. I found you here a poor man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Which  I am still,&rdquo; interrupted Enistor gloomily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course. The time is not yet ripe for you to gain your wish!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  wish! my wish!&rdquo; the host rose and raised his arms, with a fierce look on his  powerful face. &ldquo;When will it be gratified? I want money&mdash;a large  amount&mdash;thousands of pounds, since money means power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  power is the real thing you desire. The money, as we know, is only the means to  obtain that power. You wish to influence men at all costs; to rule the masses;  to be famous as a leader!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  sneer with which Narvaez made this speech irritated Enistor, although he was  sufficiently educated in mystic lore to be aware how important absolute  self-command is to those who deal with occultism. That is, he knew such was the  case, more or less, but could never attain to the necessary calm. &ldquo;It is not a  contemptible ambition,&rdquo; he snarled savagely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Our  adversary of the Right-hand Path would say so,&rdquo; rejoined Narvaez coolly, &ldquo;since  you desire power and rule and money in order to gratify Self.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  never knew that you worked for other people, Narvaez,&rdquo; sneered Enistor.</p>
  <p align="left">The  Spaniard smiled coldly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, I never shall. I strive, as you do, for  power, and, thanks to my knowledge, I have more than you, although it is not  enough to content me. It is because your aims are the same as mine that we can  work together. But Alice does not desire anything and that is what baffles both  of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  that case, she is useless to you, Master, and therefore it is no good your  marrying her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Once  she is my wife, I can influence her more easily, Enistor. As you know, I have  no feeling of love for either man or woman. That philanthropic sentiment of  sacrifice for humanity is disagreeable to me. In black magic, as in white, one  must live like what is called a saint to be powerful. To be absolutely free you  should never have married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet  you propose to make the same mistake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no mistake about the matter,&rdquo; said Narvaez calmly, &ldquo;my marriage with your  daughter will be no marriage in the accepted sense of the word. I simply wish  to bind her to me, so that I can train the clairvoyance she possesses which is  so valuable to me. I can give her plenty of money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t give it to me,&rdquo; interposed the other hastily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course not. Why should I? Nothing for nothing is the rule of the Left-hand  Path. But that I require your services and cannot dispense with them I should  not waste my time teaching you my knowledge. However, the situation stands  thus. I am to marry your daughter, and when I train her clairvoyantly&mdash;waken her  sleeping powers, that is&mdash;we may learn from her reading of the Akashic Records  what danger threatens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is a danger then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  and a very real one, which has to do with this adversary I told you about. A  desire to defeat him brought me to you, and as he is your enemy as well as  mine, you are wise to obey me in all things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet  I know that when you have no further use for me, you will cast me aside as of  no account,&rdquo; said Enistor bitterly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; rejoined the other coolly. &ldquo;You would act in the same way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not so sure that I would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah.  You have still some human weakness to get rid of before you can progress on the  path along which you ask me to lead you. I have no use for weaklings, Enistor.  Remember that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  host drew himself up haughtily. &ldquo;I am no weakling!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For  your own sake, to-morrow, I hope you are not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because  a blow will fall on you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  looked uneasy. &ldquo;A blow! What kind of a blow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Something  to do with a loss of expected money. That is all I can tell you, my friend. You  keep certain things from me, so if you are not entirely frank, how can you  expect me to aid you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  dropped into his chair again, and the perspiration beaded his dark face. &ldquo;A  loss of expected money,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and Lucy is ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who  is Lucy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  sister who lives in London. A widow called Lady Staunton. She has five thousand  a year which she promised years ago to leave to me, so that I might restore the  fortunes of the Enistor family. I had news a week ago that she is very ill, and  this week I was going up to see her in order to make sure she had not changed  her mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is useless your going to see Lady Staunton,&rdquo; said Narvaez leisurely, &ldquo;for she has changed  her mind and has made a new will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  scowled and clenched his hands. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t know details,&rdquo; said the Spaniard agreeably, &ldquo;those have to be supplied  by you. All I am certain of is that to-morrow you will receive a letter stating  that you have lost some expected money. As the sole money you hope to receive  is to come from Lady Staunton, it is logical to think that this is what will be  lost. You should have told me about this and I could have worked on her mind to  keep her true to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  it is impossible,&rdquo; cried Enistor, rising to stride up and down in an agitated  way. &ldquo;Lucy is as proud of our family as I am, and always said she would leave  her fortune to restore us to our old position in the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lady  Staunton is a woman, and women are fickle,&rdquo; said Narvaez cruelly. &ldquo;I fear you  have lost your chance this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  may be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  may be, but I don&rsquo;t think so. I was looking over your horoscope last evening,  Enistor, and from what I read therein I made further inquiries, which have to  do with invisible powers I can control.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Elementals?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  other things,&rdquo; said the magician carelessly; &ldquo;however I learned positively that  you will get bad news of the nature I explained to-morrow. It is too late to  counteract what has been done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  will&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exactly,  the will. From what you say I feel convinced that my knowledge applies to Lady  Staunton and her fortune. See what comes of not being frank with me, Enistor.  You are a fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe what you say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As  you please. It does not matter to me; except,&rdquo; he added with emphasis, &ldquo;that it  makes my hold over you more secure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  poor friend!&rdquo; Narvaez glanced back from the door towards which he had walked  slowly. &ldquo;You are losing what little powers you have obtained, since you cannot  read my mind. Why, I mean that with five thousand a year you might not be  inclined to give me your daughter in marriage. As a poor man you are forced to  do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  seems to me,&rdquo; said Enistor angrily, &ldquo;that in any case I must do so, if I wish  to learn the danger which threatens me as well as you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why,  that is true. You are clever in saying that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  perhaps this possible loss of money is the danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  The danger is a greater one than the loss of money. It has to do with your life  and my life in Chaldea; with our adversary and with the unknown man, who is  coming to take part in the drama of repayment. I have a feeling,&rdquo; said Narvaez,  passing his hand across his brow, &ldquo;that the curtain rises on our drama with  this loss of money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe Lucy will cheat me,&rdquo; cried Enistor desperately.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait  until to-morrow&rsquo;s post,&rdquo; said Narvaez significantly, &ldquo;you will find that I am a  true prophet. Our bargain of my marriage with Alice must continue on its  present basis, as the want of money will still prevent your becoming  independent. I might suggest,&rdquo; he added, opening the door, &ldquo;that you forbid  your daughter to see too much of young Hardwick. She might fall in love with  him and that would in a great measure destroy her clairvoyant powers. She will  be of no use to either of us then. Good night! When you sleep we shall meet as  usual on the other plane!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez  departed chuckling, for disagreeables befalling others always amused him. He  was absolutely without a heart and without feelings, since for ages in various  bodies he had worked hard to rid himself of his humanity. Enistor was on the  same evil path, but as yet was human enough to worry over the inevitable. Until  he slept he did his best to convince himself that Narvaez spoke falsely, but  failed utterly in the attempt.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_III"><b>Chapter III</b></a><b><br>
    The Fulfilment</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Next  morning Enistor was gloomy and apprehensive, for he had slept very badly during  the hours of darkness. He tried to persuade himself that the Spaniard  prophesied falsely, but some inward feeling assured him that this was not the  case. Before the sun set he was convinced, against his inclinations, that the  sinister prediction would be fulfilled. Therefore he picked up his morning  letters nervously, quite expecting to find a legal one stating that Lady  Staunton was dead and had left her five thousand a year to some stranger.  Fortunately for his peace of mind there was no letter of the kind, and he made  a better breakfast than he might have done. All the same he was morose and  sullen, so that Alice had anything but a pleasant time. Towards the end of the  meal he relieved his feelings by scolding the girl.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  forbid you to see much of that young Hardwick,&rdquo; he declared imperiously, &ldquo;he is  in love with you, and I don&rsquo;t wish you to marry a pauper painter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Aware  that her father wished her to accept Narvaez, it would have been wise for the  girl to have held her tongue, since a later confession of a feigned engagement  to the artist was her sole chance of resisting the loveless marriage. But  Enistor was one of those people who invariably drew what was worst in a person  to the surface, and she answered prematurely. &ldquo;Mr. Hardwick proposed yesterday  and I refused him. Therefore I can see as much of him as I want to, without  running any risk of becoming his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  ignored the latter part of her reply, proposing to deal with it later. &ldquo;You  refused him? And why, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is not the man I want for my husband. He does not complete me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are  you then incomplete?&rdquo; sneered Enistor scornfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To  my mind every woman and every man must be incomplete until a true marriage  takes place!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  is a true marriage, you silly girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  marriage of souls!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pooh!  Pooh! That foolish affinity business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  it foolish?&rdquo; queried Alice sedately. &ldquo;It appears to me to be a great truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Appears  to you!&rdquo; scoffed her father. &ldquo;What does a child such as you are know about such  things? At your age you should be healthy enough not to think of your soul and  even forget that you have one. Nevertheless I am glad that you have refused  Hardwick, as I have other views for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  they include marriage with Don Pablo, I decline to entertain them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you indeed? Rubbish! You are my daughter and shall do as I order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am a human being also, and in this instance I shall not obey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  frowned like a thunderstorm. &ldquo;You dare to set your will against my will?&rdquo; he  demanded, looking at her piercingly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  this instance I do,&rdquo; replied Alice, meeting his gaze firmly. &ldquo;I am quite  willing to be an obedient daughter to you in all else. But marriage concerns my  whole future and therefore I have a right to choose for myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have no rights, save those I allow you to have! In refusing Hardwick you have  shown more sense than I expected. But Don Pablo you must marry!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Must  I, father? And why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is wealthy and he adores you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  in spite of her nervousness laughed outright. &ldquo;I am woman enough to see that  Don Pablo only adores himself. He wants a hostess to sit at the foot of his  table and entertain his friends: he has no use for a wife. As to his wealth, I  would sooner be happy with a pauper than with a millionaire, provided I loved  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Silly  romance: silly romance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps  it is. But that is my view!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  frowned still more darkly, as he saw very plainly that, frail as she was, he  could not hope to bend her to his will. In some way he could not explain the  girl baffled his powerful personality. Yet it was necessary that she should  become the wife of Narvaez, if the danger which the old man hinted at was to be  known and conquered. &ldquo;Alice, listen to me,&rdquo; said the man entreatingly, &ldquo;we are  very poor and Don Pablo is very rich. If you marry him, you will soon be his  wealthy widow, as he cannot live long. Then with the money you will be able to  restore the fortunes of our family and marry whomsoever you desire. Be  sensible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  refuse to sacrifice myself to a loveless marriage for your sake,&rdquo; said Alice  doggedly, and standing up like a weak lily against the force of a tempest. &ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t love me, father: you have never loved me, so why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not going to argue the point with you any longer,&rdquo; stormed Enistor, rising  hastily; &ldquo;I shall force you to marry Don Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  that case I shall marry Julian Hardwick and ask him to protect me,&rdquo; said the  girl, rising in her turn, shaking and white, but sullenly determined.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Protect  you! Who can protect you against me? I can deal with Hardwick and with you in a  way you little dream of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  you can do to Mr. Hardwick I do not know,&rdquo; said the girl steadily, &ldquo;but me you  cannot harm in any way, nor can you compel me, else you would long ago have  used your boasted power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are  you aware that you are speaking to your father?&rdquo; demanded Enistor, astonished  at her daring.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perfectly!  I wish to be a good daughter to you, father, but in a matter which concerns my  whole life I must decline to yield either to your commands or prayers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  could have struck her pale face in his wrath, but, sensitive to invisible  things, he became aware that there was a barrier around her which kept him at  arm&rsquo;s length. He knew instinctively that the powerful influence pervading the  room had to do with the unknown individual whom Narvaez called &ldquo;Our Adversary,&rdquo;  and felt that he was not prepared to measure his strength against such a force.  So uncomfortable and daunted did he feel, that his one desire was to leave the  room, and he began to back towards the door. Alice was astonished to see the  perspiration beading her father&rsquo;s forehead and watched his departure in dismay.  Unaware of what was taking place, she looked upon the withdrawal as a  declaration of war, and believed, with some truth, that she would have to  suffer for opposing resistance to the marriage with Narvaez. Yet she still held  out, as she felt a singular sense of security. The same power which weakened  Enistor strengthened her, but not being a trained occultist, she wondered how  she could dare to face her father so boldly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall talk to you later,&rdquo; breathed Enistor with an effort, so hostile was the  atmosphere. &ldquo;Meanwhile you may as well know that if you decline to become Don  Pablo&rsquo;s wife, you will ruin me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  Squire&mdash;that was his title as the owner of Polwellin village&mdash;left his obstinate  daughter in the room, and went to the library, which was his own particular  domain. Here the opposing influence did not follow him. Sitting down heavily,  he began to breathe more freely, and wondered why he had been so craven as to  fly from the field of battle. Although he had been anxious all his life to  acquire forbidden lore, he had only learned something of the practical side of  occultism since the arrival of Narvaez, some three years ago. That ancient  sinner was accomplished in black arts, and for his own ends was willing to  impart something of his knowledge to Enistor. A considerable amount of sinister  teaching had been given to the Squire, but as yet he was but a neophyte, and  ignorant of many things. Narvaez withheld much purposely, as he was keenly  aware of Enistor&rsquo;s powerful will and unscrupulous greed for power. The Spaniard  did not so much desire to instruct his host as to make use of him. Those  servants of Christ, who walk on the Right-hand Path, are possessed entirely by  the Spirit of Love, and are only too anxious to teach to the ignorant all that  they may be capable of assimilating. But the Brothers of the Shadow are too  inherently selfish to be generous, and merely give out sufficient knowledge to  render their pupils useful servants and docile slaves. Narvaez had no intention  of cultivating Enistor&rsquo;s latent powers to such a strength that they might be  dangerous to himself. Consequently, although the man was on the threshold of  power, he had not yet crossed it, and therefore was unable to deal with the  force in the dining-room, the strength of which he could not calculate. To  influence Alice to work for self in a way which would lure her from behind the  barrier of the protecting power required more knowledge than Enistor possessed.  Yet Narvaez likewise professed fear of the Adversary, and could only use  cunning instead of command. The Squire smiled grimly to himself as he reflected  that the Master himself would have been ignominiously driven from the  dining-room in the same way, had he been present.</p>
  <p align="left">Of  course Enistor did not wish to injure his daughter in any way at which the  world would look askance. He merely desired her to make a loveless marriage so  as to acquire the wealth of Narvaez, and so that she might be educated in  clear-seeing for the purpose of averting a possible danger. What that danger  might be Enistor did not know, and so far as he could guess Don Pablo was  equally ignorant. Therefore it was absolutely necessary that the latent  clairvoyant powers of the girl should be brought to the surface and trained, if  the safety of the Black Magician and his pupil was to be assured. Enistor was  aggressively selfish, and to save himself was ready to sacrifice his daughter  and a dozen human beings if necessary to the Dark Powers. Her body, her  fortune, her honour, would not be injured, but&mdash;as Enistor very well knew&mdash;her  soul would be in danger. For this however he cared nothing. Better that the girl  should perish than that he should be balked of his daring ambition. But he did  not intend to surrender Alice to Don Pablo unless his price was paid, and that  price included unlimited wealth together with unlimited power over weaker  mortals. Narvaez alone could instruct him in the arts which could command such  things.</p>
  <p align="left">Meanwhile,  as Enistor needed money, it was necessary for him to attend to practical  matters, which had to do with Lady Staunton! For many years Enistor had  influenced his sister strongly to leave her entire fortune to him, and until  Narvaez had spoken on the previous evening, he had every reason to believe that  he would get what he wanted. But the prediction rendered him uneasy, even  though the expected letter had not yet arrived. The Ides of March had truly  come, but had not passed, and although the fatal epistle had failed to appear  in the morning&rsquo;s batch of letters, it might be delivered by the evening post.  All that day Enistor was naturally uncomfortable and apprehensive. Positive  that his sister would leave him her fortune, he had rejoiced when the news of  her illness arrived, and in his fancied security he had not even gone up to  London to make sure that all was safe. Certainly he had never dreamed of taking  so long a journey to console the old lady on her death-bed; but he deeply  regretted for the sake of the inheritance that he had not sought her company  during her sickness. Also it might have been advisable to enlist the evil  services of Narvaez to clinch the matter, and this omission the Squire deeply  lamented. However, it was now too late to do anything save wait for the post  and hope for the best. He suffered as only a selfish nature can suffer, and the  agonies of a truly selfish man are very great when he is thwarted.</p>
  <p align="left">It  was close upon three o&rsquo;clock when he was put out of his misery by the arrival  of an unexpected stranger. Enistor, finding that Alice had betaken herself to  the safer spaces of the moorlands, had no one to torment, so he busied himself  with evil practices in his gloomy library. That is, he used the teaching of  Narvaez to concentrate his will-power on Lady Staunton, so that she might still  desire to leave him her money. With her visualised image in his mind&rsquo;s eye, he  was sending powerful thoughts to her sick-bed insisting that he and he only  should benefit by the will. An ignorant person would have laughed at the idea  of any one being so controlled from a distance, but Enistor knew perfectly well  what he was doing, and made ardent use of his unholy telepathy. Later when the  footman announced that Lady Staunton&rsquo;s solicitor, Mr. Cane, desired an  interview, Enistor granted it without delay. It was better, he wisely thought,  to know the best or the worst at once, without suffering the agonies of  suspense until the evening post.</p>
  <p align="left">The  new-comer was a bustling, rosy-cheeked little man, well dressed, expansive and  voluble. He had no nerves to speak of, and still less imagination, therefore he  was not in the least impressed by the grey atmosphere of Tremore. In fact  before he condescended to business, he complimented his host on the breezy  altitude of the house and the beauty of the surroundings. His courtesy was not  at all appreciated, as Enistor soon let him know.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t suppose you came here to admire the view, Mr. Cane,&rdquo; said the Squire  irritably. &ldquo;Your unexpected presence argues that my sister is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mr.  Cane&rsquo;s lively face assumed a solemn expression, and his airy manner became  heavily professional. &ldquo;You are right, Mr. Enistor,&rdquo; he said pompously, &ldquo;my  lamented client, Lady Staunton, passed away to the better land in a peaceful  frame of mind at ten o&rsquo;clock last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  frowned and winced as he remembered his wasted telepathy. &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said  conventionally, &ldquo;and I regret greatly that I was not at hand to soothe her last  moments. But unexpected business prevented my taking the journey. Still, had I  guessed that she was likely to die, I should have managed to be with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pray  do not grieve, Mr. Enistor,&rdquo; exclaimed the solicitor with unintentional irony. &ldquo;My  lamented client&rsquo;s last moments were tenderly soothed by her best friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Her  best friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  Lady Staunton termed Mr. Montrose!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  never heard of him,&rdquo; said Enistor abruptly. &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  most unexpected reply took away the Squire&rsquo;s breath. &ldquo;He is the fortunate young  gentleman who inherits Lady Staunton&rsquo;s property.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  rose in a black fury, with clenched fists and incredulous looks. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  understand: you must be mistaken,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not mistaken,&rdquo; replied Cane dryly. &ldquo;I was never more in earnest in my life,  sir. It is hard on you as my late lamented client&rsquo;s nearest relative, I admit.  In fact Lady Staunton thought so too, and asked me to come down as soon as she  died to explain her reasons for leaving the money to Mr. Montrose. Otherwise,  since your sister, Mr. Enistor, did not encourage legal matters being attended  to out of order, you would not have heard the news until the reading of the  will after the funeral. As Lady Staunton died last night, the burial will take  place in four days. I have no doubt as a sincere mourner you will be there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  sincere mourner!&rdquo; cried Enistor, pacing the room hastily to work off his rage. &ldquo;How  can I be that when my sister has cheated me in this way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  not cheated, Mr. Enistor, not cheated,&rdquo; pleaded the rosy-cheeked little man  more volubly than ever. &ldquo;Lady Staunton&rsquo;s money was her own to dispose of as she  desired. Besides, she did not forget you entirely: she has left you the sum of  one thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Really!&rdquo;  sneered the Squire savagely, &ldquo;and this Montrose creature inherits five thousand  a year! It is wicked: infamous, scandalous. I shall upset the will, Mr. Cane!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  lawyer remonstrated mildly. &ldquo;I fear that is impossible, Mr. Enistor. My  lamented client was quite in her right senses when she signed the will, and as  I drew it up in accordance with her instructions, you may be certain that all  is in good order. I feel for you: upon my word I feel for you,&rdquo; added Mr. Cane  plaintively, &ldquo;and my errand cannot be called a pleasant one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  hang your feelings: what do I care for your feelings! It is my sister&rsquo;s  iniquitous will that I am thinking about. She knew how poor I was: she was  proud of being an Enistor, and she faithfully promised that I should have the  money in order to mend our family fortunes. What devil made her change her  intentions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No  devil that I am aware of,&rdquo; said Cane with puny dignity. &ldquo;Lady Staunton did make  a will in your favour. But a year ago she signed a new one leaving her income  to Mr. Montrose, who is now my client. I decline on these grounds to hear him  spoken of as a devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh.  Then it was this Montrose beast who made her change her mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  Certainly he did not. He is not even aware that he has inherited, as Lady  Staunton asked me to see you first. Only when the will is read, after the  funeral in four days, will Mr. Montrose learn of his good fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Montrose  does not know,&rdquo; said Enistor, striding forward to stand over the little lawyer  in a threatening way. &ldquo;Then why not destroy this last will and read the old one  which is in my favour!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Cane  wriggled beneath Enistor&rsquo;s fiery gaze and slipped sideways out of his chair. &ldquo;Are  you in your right senses to&mdash;&rdquo; he began, puffing indignantly.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  cut him short. &ldquo;Oh, the deuce take your heroics! You know perfectly well that I  should benefit rather than a stranger. I want the money and I intend to get the  money. By righting this wrong you will be doing a good act, since it seems you  have a conscience of sorts. If it is a matter of money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This  time it was Cane who interrupted. &ldquo;You insult me,&rdquo; he vociferated shrilly. &ldquo;I  am an honest lawyer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rather  an anomaly,&rdquo; interpolated Enistor scoffingly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;An  honest lawyer,&rdquo; continued the little man sturdily, &ldquo;and as such I am bound to  consider the wishes of my client. You are asking me to commit a felony, Mr.  Enistor. How dare you! How dare you!&rdquo; he mopped his perspiring brow. &ldquo;What have  you seen in me to lead you to make so infamous a proposition?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  thought I saw some vestiges of common sense,&rdquo; said Enistor dryly. &ldquo;But it seems  that you are a fool with a conscience!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have a conscience, but I am no fool, Mr. Enistor! I have a great mind to tell  the world at large how you endeavoured to tempt me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  you do, I shall put forth a counter-slander saying that you came down here to  tempt me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To  tempt you? To tempt you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  not? If I say that you offered to destroy the last will and substitute the  first provided I gave you a large sum of money, who will refuse to believe the  statement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Any  one who knows me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah.  But the whole world does not know you, Mr. Cane. Your immediate friends may  reject the calumny, but the majority of people won&rsquo;t. My word is as good as  yours, you know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  will not dare&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh  yes, I shall dare if you dare!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Am  I dealing with a gentleman or a scoundrel?&rdquo; asked Cane, appealing to the carved  ceiling.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pooh!  Pooh!&rdquo; said Enistor cynically. &ldquo;What is the use of calling names? Why, a  gentleman is only a scoundrel who is clever enough not to be found out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  disagree: I disagree entirely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  thought you would. You are not strong enough to be original. However, all this  chatter will not alter circumstances. My sister has sold me in favour of  this&mdash;what do you say his name is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Montrose. Douglas Montrose!&rdquo; said Cane sulkily. &ldquo;He is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  you sit down and explain? You will be more comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No  I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Cane sharply and still fretted by the proposition which had been  made to him. &ldquo;I doubt if it would not be better for me to retire after what you  have said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  said Enistor ironically, &ldquo;your duty to your late lamented client forbids.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  does, and therefore I remain to explain. But I shall not sit down again in your  presence, nor drink your wine, nor eat your food.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Better  wait until you are asked, Mr. Cane. Go on and tell me about Montrose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Confounded  by his host&rsquo;s disconcerting calm, the little lawyer came to the point, but  delivered his explanation standing. &ldquo;Mr. Montrose is a young Scotchman, poor  and handsome and clever. He is a poet and a journalist, who lives in a  Bloomsbury garret, ambitious of literary fame. Eighteen months ago he saved  Lady Staunton&rsquo;s life when her horses bolted in Hyde Park. He stopped them at  the risk of his limbs, and prevented a serious accident!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Silly  ass,&rdquo; muttered Enistor, &ldquo;if Lucy had died then, the money would have come to  me. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Appalled  by this crudely evil speech, Cane started back. &ldquo;Are you a man or a demon, Mr.  Enistor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  can ask riddles when you have delivered your message. Though, to be sure,&rdquo; said  Enistor, sitting down, &ldquo;there is little need. This handsome young pauper paid  court to my sister, who was always weak and silly. His sham heroism and his  good looks and effusive compliments worked on her feeble mind, and she made him  her heir. Am I right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lady  Staunton made Mr. Montrose her heir certainly,&rdquo; said Cane, shutting up his  little black bag and putting on his hat to leave. &ldquo;But your description of my  new client is wrong. He does not flatter any one, and his heroism was not a  sham. Nor was your sister feeble-minded, but a very clever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo;  ended Enistor sharply, &ldquo;and being so became the prey of this adventurer. Well,  Mr. Cane, now that you have delivered your message you can go, and I shall be  obliged if you will send me the one thousand pounds as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  certainly,&rdquo; cried Cane eagerly.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  saw why he spoke so agreeably. &ldquo;You think that by taking the one thousand  pounds I condone the testament of Lady Staunton. Perhaps you are right, but I  have more strings to my bow than one. I have been infamously treated and I shall  have my revenge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  cannot revenge yourself on your sister who is dead,&rdquo; said Cane rebukingly, &ldquo;and  to punish Mr. Montrose, who is perfectly innocent of harming you, would not be  the act of a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah,  but you see I am nothing so feeble-minded as a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  are you then?&rdquo; Cane stared.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  wronged man, who intends to be revenged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall protect my client,&rdquo; cried the lawyer vigorously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Naturally,  your fees will be larger if you do. But don&rsquo;t protect him at the cost of my  character, or it will be the worse for your own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not afraid!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed  you are! Horribly afraid. However, you needn&rsquo;t faint on my doorstep as that  would be inconvenient. Good-day: your trap is waiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Cane  got away at once, quite convinced that Enistor was not wholly in his right  mind. His rosy cheeks were pale as he drove away, and his courage was dashed by  Enistor&rsquo;s unscrupulous threat.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is dangerous,&rdquo; thought the lawyer. &ldquo;I must hold my tongue!&rdquo; and he did.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_IV"><b>Chapter IV</b></a><b><br>
    Plotting</b></h2>
  <p align="left">The  prophecy of Narvaez should have softened the blow to Enistor in the moment of  its fulfilment. But it did not, for the simple reason that he had tried his  best to disbelieve the Spaniard, in spite of his knowledge of the man&rsquo;s powers.  Don Pablo, as the result of prying beyond the boundaries of the visible,  possessed in active working super-senses latent in the ordinary man, and so he  could literally see through a brick wall. Certainly his vision was not  invariably clear, and at times the details of his prognostications were incorrect.  In the present instance he had foretold that Enistor should receive his bad  news by letter, whereas Mr. Cane had come down personally to convey the  disagreeable intelligence. But the actual fact that Enistor would lose the  money had been proved beyond all doubt, and the Squire found the one undeniable  truth so unpleasant that he was careless about minor mistakes.</p>
  <p align="left">As  soon as Cane, without bite or sup, had driven away in the direction of  Perchton, Enistor made his way across the moors to the back-country where  Narvaez had his abode. It was impossible that he could keep the knowledge of  his bad fortune to himself, and moreover he wanted advice with regard to his  future actions. The Squire was clever as men go, and usually decided all  matters for himself; but in this instance it was necessary to consult a  mastermind. Don Pablo was not only a shrewd and highly educated man, versed in  knowledge of the world, but also possessed super-physical information which was  both dangerous and useful. That is, the lore was dangerous to any who did not  possess the spirit of love, and useful to an unscrupulous and wholly selfish  man. Both Enistor and his master thought only of themselves and were prepared  to crush without remorse all that stood in their way. At the present moment the  unknown Montrose was an obstacle in Enistor&rsquo;s path and he wished Narvaez to  assist in his removal. The Spaniard would only give his services if he saw that  their use would benefit himself. And as the Squire knew that the wily old man  wished him to remain poor in order to retain mastery over him, it was not  likely that he would help him to gain a fortune. Enistor therefore was not  certain that he would be aided, and more for the sake of talking himself free  of care than for any other reason sought the cottage of the magician.</p>
  <p align="left">And  Don Pablo&rsquo;s abode was really and truly a four-roomed cottage, where he lived  along with a simple-minded old Cornish woman of sixty, who attended to his few  wants. Enistor knew that Narvaez was immensely rich, and wondered why he should  live so penuriously and humbly. But the man was almost wholly devoid of desire  for things which mankind covets. He ate and drank sparingly: he cared nothing  for society: his dress was plain but neat, and he was too much taken up with  study to entertain. Narvaez, as his neighbour soon found out, was consumed by a  passion for power: not that kind of power which is displayed openly by royalty  or politicians or merchant-princes, but the secret power which sways the  destinies of individuals and nations without apparent sign. For this he studied  day and night, and crossed constantly the boundaries between the worlds visible  and invisible. He obtained no physical benefit from the exercise of such  command, but the passion of hidden sovereignty satisfied his soul, and that was  all he cared about. He had long since risen above the sphere wherein the  virtues and vices of men dispute pre-eminence, and lived above the healthy  necessary turmoil of ordinary life to reign in solitude as a cold, calm,  intellectual and merciless tyrant, doing evil because it gratified Self. He  disobeyed the law of love which is giving, and isolated himself in a kingdom of  his own, which his desire for rule had cut off from the great empire of God.  His sole connection with men and women was to destroy their protecting will and  make them slaves to his whims. In this way he acted with regard to Enistor,  else he would not have taught the man anything about dark magic. But Narvaez  knew well that Enistor, possessed of as fierce and unscrupulous a nature as his  own, and almost as powerful a will, would never be a slave. Consequently he was  obliged to act cautiously in his association with him. Enistor, if he became  too learned in forbidden lore, might well become Don Pablo&rsquo;s rival, to dispute  the bad sovereignty which the Spaniard loved. As a matter of fact Narvaez would  not have meddled with the Cornish squire at all but that he knew that a common  danger menaced both, which Enistor, through his daughter, might avert. Narvaez  was clever and powerful, and wholly given to self-worship, but he was by no  means omnipotent, and at times it was necessary to defend his position. Thus by  the offer to teach Enistor how to realise his ambitions, he managed to make the  man more or less obedient: but there was always the danger of revolt should  Enistor learn too thoroughly the laws of the invisible world, which  interpenetrates the visible. Don Pablo, however, was content with the position  of affairs, as his pupil was not yet strong enough to measure swords. And  before he was, the Spaniard hoped to secure his ends and leave Enistor in the  lurch.</p>
  <p align="left">The  cottage was of grey stone, a clumsy rugged-looking habitation set on the side  of a purple-clothed hill, beside a grass-grown lane, which meandered down the  valley. On the slope of the hill were many disused mining shafts with huge  mounds of earth and ruined buildings beside them. The hilltops had been a Roman  camp, and the boundaries could still be defined. In the centre and amongst many  gigantic stones was a sacrificial altar of the Druids, with grooves cut in its  hardness so that the blood of the victims might stream to the ground. Alice  never liked this unholy hill, as she was sensitive enough to feel the influence  which clung round it. But Narvaez had established his home beside the miniature  mountain, because on moonless nights he could perform uncanny ceremonies on the  altar, which was given over to the Dark Powers he worshipped and propitiated.  Enistor had likewise taken part in these sacrilegious doings and shivered at  the memory of certain things, when he sighted the sinister grey monoliths which  crowned the hill. Great as was his courage, it was not entirely proof against  the deadly influences of the evil beings who haunted the place, although in a  lesser degree than Narvaez he could compel them to service by performing  certain rites.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  was ushered into Don Pablo&rsquo;s study by the housekeeper, a brown-faced cheery old  woman, too simple-minded to understand her master&rsquo;s weird powers. The apartment  was of no great size, and the limited space was but sparsely furnished. There  were only a table, which served as a desk, two chairs, a well-filled bookcase  and a ponderous iron safe, wherein Narvaez stored what valuables he had by him.  The walls were draped with dull red cloth, and the floor, oddly enough, was  covered with a black carpet. The effect was menacing and impressive. When the  visitor entered, a fire-place wherein large logs flamed faced him, while  opposite the one window looking out on to the hilltop was a closed door leading  to a sealed apartment, which Don Pablo allowed no one to enter into save  himself and his pupil. Across the passage was a dining-room together with a  tiny kitchen and a bedroom for the housekeeper at the back. The cottage itself  was placed in a disorderly uncultivated garden surrounded by a loosely built  stone wall. There was no upstairs, and the house being roofed with slate  covered with moss presented a sombre appearance. In its greyness it resembled a  huge toad squatting amongst the heather.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  can you bear a fire on this hot day?&rdquo; asked Enistor, throwing himself into the  vacant chair and speaking irritably.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are in that kind of humour which seeks any outlet for its relief,&rdquo; was the  Spaniard&rsquo;s irrelevant reply. &ldquo;How often have I told you that it is necessary  for you to get complete command of your temper. I have a fire because this body  I occupy just now is nearly worn out and requires artificial heat to sustain  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you get a new one?&rdquo; demanded the visitor still crossly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Some  day I shall,&rdquo; rejoined Narvaez significantly, &ldquo;at present this one serves me  tolerably well. I control it thoroughly: you do not manage yours properly: it  is your master, Enistor. Ah! you have much to learn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have reason to be cross.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No  one has any reason to be cross. To lose one&rsquo;s temper simply shows that one is  not yet free from ordinary human limitations. However, at your stage of  learning I excuse you. It is hard to lose a large income, as you have done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What,  you know&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  by any super-physical means, Enistor,&rdquo; said Narvaez, coolly leaning back in his  chair. &ldquo;I walked to the top of the hill with a field-glass, and saw that you  had a visitor. As so few people come here, it is only logical on my part to  assume that the man was some messenger sent to tell you of Lady Staunton&rsquo;s  death and your own loss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  the news did not come in a letter, as you prophesied,&rdquo; snapped Enistor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not the Pope to be infallible,&rdquo; said Don Pablo dryly, &ldquo;and the matter is so  trivial that I did not examine into things sufficiently to be entirely certain  of details.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Trivial  to you: not to me!&rdquo; said the Squire gloomily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nonsense!  Your possession of that income is only delayed. You have not lost it  altogether!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  looked up sharply. &ldquo;Did you make an invisible third at my interview with Cane?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I?&rdquo;  Don Pablo shrugged his aged shoulders. &ldquo;Do you think that I have nothing to do  but to waste my time in that way? No! I only say that you will regain the  money, because I shall assist you to get it. You must have your price even  though it is but a temporary one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  do you mean by temporary?&rdquo; asked Enistor unpleasantly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Any  one who works for money, or earthly fame, or earthly power has to surrender  what he gains when death comes. But he who labours to acquire super-physical  powers as I do&mdash;those powers which can dominate men without their knowing, gets  what he can never lose, however many the deaths or lives!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall work for that later, Master. At present I require money so as to take my  proper position in the world, and sway men at will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  limited ambition,&rdquo; scoffed Narvaez. &ldquo;However, what you desire you shall  acquire, as you won&rsquo;t let me have your daughter without a price.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Would  you do something for nothing yourself, Don Pablo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said the magician honestly. &ldquo;I take what I want if I am strong enough to do so.  Otherwise I buy what I require. Nothing for nothing and something for  something&mdash;if there is no other way of getting it. That is my rule.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is the rule of the majority of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;True,  my friend,&rdquo; chuckled Narvaez, settling himself comfortably. &ldquo;Mankind has a long  way to travel before the law of love is learned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  law of love?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  give all and ask no return! Think of it: how dull life would be then, Enistor!  However, we have argued enough, and my time is valuable. What about your  interview with this lawyer? I must have details if I am to assist you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  looked at his master with a sneer. &ldquo;I should have thought that a man with your  powers would have known everything without requiring explanations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  it had been worth my while I would have made myself acquainted with all that  took place,&rdquo; said the other man blandly; &ldquo;but your affairs do not interest me  save the necessity of paying your price. Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  Squire looked again at Narvaez, and this time with gloomy distaste. It was  often borne in upon him how entirely selfish Don Pablo was. But by this time he  knew beyond question that those who take the Left-hand Path are forgetful of  all save themselves. And Enistor could scarcely blame Narvaez for owning a  quality which was almost as highly developed in his own nature. &ldquo;Might is  Right!&rdquo; is the rule of black magic, and the survival of the fittest is the sole  way to attain supremacy. Enistor had fully committed himself to the worship of  his own being, yet there was sufficient good in him to struggle at times  against the isolating power of selfishness. However it was worse than useless  to argue away accepted facts, so he swallowed his anger and quietly detailed  all that had taken place.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo;  said Narvaez, smoothing his wrinkled face when the last word was spoken. &ldquo;You  have made my task more difficult than was necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  what way?&rdquo; scowled the Squire, who disliked correction.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  several ways,&rdquo; was the serene response. &ldquo;Your idea of threatening Cane was a  good one, and had you called me to your assistance I could have worked along  those lines. The man&mdash;from what you say&mdash;is weak, and my power added to yours  would have secured the destruction of the second will, and the substitution of  the first. Then you would have got the money without trouble. By weakening in  your attack, you have simply turned Cane into your enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t dare to say anything, if that is what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is not what I mean, Enistor. Of course, since a lawyer, like C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s wife,  should be above reproach, Cane will not speak lest you should accuse him of  offering to suppress the second will. But that doesn&rsquo;t much matter. The point  is that you had him at a disadvantage and did not press your point. A well-directed  thought would have brought me to your house, and I could have compelled the man  to yield.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not so sure of that. He is honest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  does that matter?&rdquo; asked Don Pablo, opening his eyes contemptuously. &ldquo;Honest or  not, I should have obsessed him to such a degree that he would have committed  himself too far to retreat. Of course if he was guarded my control would have  effected nothing. But our Adversary only protects Alice, and in this instance  would not have interfered. And yet,&rdquo; Narvaez suddenly looked round, as though  aware of some new influence, &ldquo;he might have prevented my exercise of power. It  is necessary for the money to go to Montrose so that the Chaldean Drama should  be played out in this set of lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  Montrose the other man you spoke of at dinner last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Don  Pablo threw up his hand to compel silence, closed his eyes to shut out the  world of sense and listened intently. As he did so, his face grew dark and  angry. &ldquo;I defy you: I defy you!&rdquo; he said vehemently, addressing some invisible  person, as it appeared to Enistor. &ldquo;Plot as you will, I can counterplot!&rdquo; then  he was silent for a moment, and opening his eyes lowered his hand. &ldquo;The  Adversary,&rdquo; he said quietly to his guest, but still looked fierce. &ldquo;He is aware  of our schemes, and says they will not succeed, if he can prevent their  success. Well, I shall pit my strength against his.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  Adversary then is not absolutely certain of success?&rdquo; asked Enistor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  Because man has free-will. If Montrose and Alice are guided by the Adversary,  our task will indeed be difficult. But if you and I can make either stumble,  the game will end in our favour. As I said, Enistor, this loss of money is the  beginning of the drama. You can see for yourself, because by its going to  Montrose it brings him on to the stage. And yet,&rdquo; added Narvaez with a furious  gesture, &ldquo;had you called me in to deal with that lawyer, I might have  suppressed the second will and have prevented Montrose coming into the matter.  The Adversary told me just now that he would have intervened also, but Cane  being weak and having free-will&mdash;as all men have&mdash;could not have stood out  against my domination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Enistor gloomily; &ldquo;it seems that owing to my ignorance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your  folly,&rdquo; interrupted the other sharply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Folly  if you will then. But owing to my ignorance or folly we have lost the first  move in the game. What now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez  shrugged. &ldquo;We must take a roundabout way instead of going by the direct path.  That is closed by your not pressing your advantage with Cane. Now Montrose will  obtain the money! Very good. He can retain it until I get it back from him to  give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  money is rightfully mine,&rdquo; cried Enistor vehemently, &ldquo;and come what may I  intend to gain it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  will never gain it if you bluster and fume in that way,&rdquo; said Don Pablo coldly;  &ldquo;keep your temper and self-control, and we shall soon be at grips with the  Adversary. He is no mean antagonist, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  Master, what is to be done? I leave myself in your hands!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t assist you otherwise.&rdquo; Narvaez considered for a few moments. &ldquo;I think  it will be best to send Alice to London for a few months. The time of her stay  will depend upon her chances of falling in love with Montrose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  jumped up and stamped. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know Montrose,&rdquo; he declared in an angry  manner, &ldquo;she will never know him if I can help it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are unable to help it,&rdquo; said Narvaez frigidly. &ldquo;The Karma of Chaldea is bound  to bring Montrose and Alice together. This much I am sure of, although I am  ignorant of the details. Well, let us carry the war into the enemy&rsquo;s camp,  Enistor. With this thousand pounds which you inherit, give Alice a few months  in London on the plea that she requires a gay life to cheer her up. She will  meet Montrose and he will fall in love with her. I am certain of this as his  fate and her fate are intermingled. Then you can give your consent to the  marriage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  about your desire to marry Alice?&rdquo; interrupted the Squire, much puzzled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  can be gratified later,&rdquo; said Don Pablo coolly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see what I mean,  Enistor? When Alice desires to marry Montrose, you will naturally invite your  proposed son-in-law here to acquaint yourself with his character. Once he is on  the spot&rdquo;&mdash;Narvaez smiled cruelly and drew a deep breath&mdash;&ldquo;I think you can safely  leave him to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  will you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never  mind. I have a plan in my head which may or may not succeed. There is no need  to tell you what it is. You shall see its results. Your work is to send Alice  to London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; said Enistor, trying to read his master&rsquo;s thoughts,  but in vain. &ldquo;But I shall obey your instructions. But if Alice is to meet  Montrose in society I fear it will be difficult to induce her to go out for  enjoyment so soon after her aunt&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Montrose as the heir of Lady Staunton will feel the same way. But it is not  necessary for the two to meet at public functions. A quiet evening here, a  little dinner there, and the introduction is accomplished. You need not trouble  about details, Enistor. The accumulated result of good and evil, which we call  Karma, will bring them together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are willing to surrender Alice, I see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  dear me, no! Montrose can make love to her until he is in my net. Afterwards,  when the money comes to you and Montrose comes to the gallows, Alice can be my  wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  gallows. You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  mean nothing at present,&rdquo; interrupted Narvaez impatiently, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t fight  battles with squirts. Montrose is in your path and mine, so he has to be  removed. The means may be unpleasant, but they will not harm you in any way. I  assure you of that emphatically.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will  they harm Alice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only  through her affections; not otherwise. What a heap of scruples you have,  Enistor,&rdquo; sneered the old man; &ldquo;one would think you were a school-girl instead  of a grown man. You don&rsquo;t care for Montrose, or for your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; admitted Enistor selfishly. &ldquo;All the same, murder&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  if the word frightens you, call it blood-atonement. And the restitution of the  fortune may be managed without the sacrifice of Montrose&rsquo;s life, if you will  insist upon this silly weakness. If you wish to tread the Left-hand Path,  Enistor, you must get rid of scruples. Trample on every one, slay, ruin,  devastate: as the stronger you have the right to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  Squire winced at this abominable teaching, although in his innermost heart he  subscribed to it. And after all, as he thought, in the world of to-day the  weaker is still the prey of the stronger. He was only carrying out more  thoroughly what every one did in a lesser degree. Without further pangs he gave  in to the necessity of Montrose being removed by a legal death. &ldquo;But his  hanging will involve the commission of a murder by him,&rdquo; he said suddenly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  said the other man ambiguously. &ldquo;But you had better wait and see, Enistor. I  can&rsquo;t waste time in arguing down your scruples. If you can&rsquo;t face these things,  leave the matter alone and deal with the future danger yourself. But remember  that only Alice can describe what that danger is, and she must become my wife  to be trained as a clairvoyante.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t want her to love Hardwick because you said the passion would destroy her  powers,&rdquo; said Enistor irrelevantly. &ldquo;What about her love for this Montrose? Won&rsquo;t  that do harm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Unfortunately  it will,&rdquo; sighed Narvaez vexedly, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t prevent the blossoming of the  love. The great law of Karma is stronger than I am. I can only deal with the  free-will of both and warp their natures if possible. I think you had better go  now. I have much to do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  scowled at the imperious tone and tried&mdash;as he often did&mdash;to match his will  against that of Narvaez. It suddenly came to him that he could find an easier  way out of the difficulty and reduce Don Pablo&rsquo;s power over him by acting in  the ordinary selfish way sanctioned by custom. &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; he said testily. &ldquo;Montrose  has the money, it is true, and legally there is no chance of getting it from  him. But if he becomes my son-in-law, I shall be able to keep the income in the  family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Quite  so,&rdquo; assented Narvaez indifferently. &ldquo;If you want the money for the family&mdash;to  build up the Enistor fortunes as county people I suppose you mean&mdash;your  suggestion is excellent. Montrose can take your name and along with his wife  will be great in the land. Where you will be I leave you to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want Montrose to be great in the land, and I don&rsquo;t suppose that he has  the brains to become so. But he and Alice will probably allow me to handle the  income and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  you will use it for your own advancement. Eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  not? My advancement as head of the family will mean theirs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probably,  if you wish to waste time, energy and cash in building up your decayed race.  But Montrose may have his own ideas to carry out, and those may not include  consent to your possession of the family purse. Complete ownership of the money  makes him stronger than you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stronger  than I am? We shall see,&rdquo; and Enistor laughed at the idea.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  likely, when it is too late, you probably will see, and won&rsquo;t be pleased with  what you do see. However, it is your business, not mine. I can return to Spain  and learn what I wish to learn in other ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  the teaching you are giving me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez  sneered. &ldquo;With an obedient son-in-law possessed of five thousand a year you  will not want the teaching.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  Squire looked as alarmed as a self-confident man well could. He had scarcely  counted upon this attitude being taken by his master. &ldquo;I want the teaching more  than I want the money,&rdquo; he confessed uneasily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  can have both if you will permit me to carry out my plans,&rdquo; said Don Pablo, acidly  polite. &ldquo;Otherwise you must be satisfied to sink back into the ordinary rank  and file of humanity. My fee for teaching super-physical knowledge is  possession of your daughter as my wife. Therefore your idea of securing the  handling of this money by forwarding her marriage with Montrose does not meet  with my approval. You can take your choice. I&mdash;as you will be pleased to  observe&mdash;do not coerce you in any way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried the Squire with sudden fury.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let  us leave it at that,&rdquo; rejoined the Spaniard amiably.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  stamped, swore under his breath and bit his nails angrily, while Narvaez smiled  in a hatefully bland manner. Certainly the marriage of Montrose and Alice would  bring back the money to the family; but it might not&mdash;and here the egotist saw  danger&mdash;put it into his own particular pocket. Lady Staunton&rsquo;s heir might be  self-willed, obstinate and foolish&mdash;there was no knowing what qualities he might  possess likely to thwart his proposed father-in-law&rsquo;s schemes. And should he  prove to be recalcitrant, Enistor recognised that the marriage would only make  matters worse. He would gain by it neither the teaching nor the fortune, and  would have bartered the substance for the shadow. To have the money would be  good: to acquire the secret lore would be better: to have both would be best of  all. And both he could have for certain if he agreed to allow Narvaez to take  command. For the teaching would make him a minor god, while the five thousand a  year&mdash;even if he got it, which was doubtful&mdash;would not even make him a  millionaire.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  remind me,&rdquo; said the tempter, smiling as hatefully as ever, &ldquo;of an ass between  two bundles of hay. With my help I repeat you can have both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  money and the teaching: the teaching and the money.&rdquo; Enistor opened and shut  his hands, drawing deep breaths and thinking profoundly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exactly!  On condition that I marry Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  agree.&rdquo; Enistor came to the decision swiftly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Understand!  I am to have a free hand and your obedience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  other man nodded, not knowing how fatal to himself was that sign of  acquiescence. At that moment he stood at the cross-roads, free to choose good  or evil, and his fierce greed led him to take the Left-hand Path down which  this dark guide beckoned him to destruction. With a little chuckling laugh  Narvaez received his victim&rsquo;s allegiance, and turned to his work. Then in the  same tone of voice he made exactly the same remark as he had made when Enistor  first hesitated. &ldquo;I think you had better go now; I have much to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  thus abruptly dismissed returned home pondering deeply on the way. By this time  he was sufficiently infected with the cynicism of Narvaez to accept the  situation, and to do what was necessary to turn Alice into a decoy for  Montrose. Whether the bird would be lured into Don Pablo&rsquo;s nest he could not be  sure, as Cane might warn his client of danger. Enistor now saw how very foolish  he had been to make the man his enemy. But he comforted himself with the idea  that the little lawyer would not dare to speak in the face of a possible  accusation of having offered to suppress the second will. Also, even if he did  speak, Montrose being in love would never listen to him. On the whole  therefore, Enistor felt confident on reflection that the fortunate young man  would appear at Tremore. Then he could be left to the malignant devices of Don  Pablo Narvaez.</p>
  <p align="left">That  evening at dinner Enistor abruptly announced the death of his sister, the loss  of the money, and the good fortune of Mr. Douglas Montrose. He listened quietly  to Alice&rsquo;s regrets, then informed her that she could go to London for a month  in a very short space of time. The girl demurred.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t go out into society when Aunt Lucy is dead,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no need for you to go into society,&rdquo; said her father, who anticipated the  objection. &ldquo;You can stay quietly in town and enjoy yourself in a small way.  This place is rather dull for so young a girl as you are. The question is who  can chaperon you, seeing that your Aunt Lucy is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs.  Barrast can, father,&rdquo; said Alice eagerly and much flushed, for the prospect of  escaping from that gloomy house was delightful.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who  is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Julian&rsquo;s&mdash;I  mean Mr. Hardwick&rsquo;s sister. I met her at Perchton last Christmas, and so did  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I remember; that frivolous little fool of a woman with no more brains than a  sparrow. Yes! you can go to her, if she will have you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  will be very glad,&rdquo; said Alice eagerly. &ldquo;She is fond of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  good.&rdquo; Enistor rose deliberately. &ldquo;Then that is settled!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_V"><b>Chapter V</b></a><b><br>
    The Meeting</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Having  settled that Alice should go to London in that singularly short and abrupt  conversation, Enistor refused to discuss the matter further. He ran up to town  himself within the next four days, not so much to appear at his sister&rsquo;s  funeral, which he duly attended, as to get the promised thousand pounds. He did  not meet Montrose, since he purposely kept out of the young man&rsquo;s way, in spite  of Cane&rsquo;s suggestion that there should be a meeting. Enistor, instructed by his  master, decided that it would be best to let Montrose fall in love with Alice,  and approach him in the character of a proposed son-in-law. Of course the  Squire had no doubt but what the affections of the young people would be  engaged as Narvaez predicted. The fulfilment of the prophecy concerning the  loss of the money had considerably strengthened his faith in the Spaniard&rsquo;s  powers.</p>
  <p align="left">With  Cane the Squire got on much better, as he was anxious to obliterate, for  obvious reasons, the bad impression he had made on the little man. Enistor  pretended that he had only acted as he had done to see if Cane was honest, and  professed himself quite willing to be content with his scanty inheritance.  Whether the solicitor believed him or not it was impossible to say, but he  feigned a belief and behaved with extraordinary civility to Enistor. Cane even  went so far as to pay the thousand pounds out of his private account, so that  the Squire should not have to wait for the winding up of Lady Staunton&rsquo;s  estate. By the acceptance of this money, it was tacitly understood that Enistor  would not contest the will, and Cane drew a long breath of relief when the  receipt was given. There certainly was no chance that the second will could be  upset, but the lawyer did not wish for any public action to be taken, lest  mention should be made of the visit to Tremore. For even though that visit had  been authorised by the dead woman, the vague threat of the Squire might come  out in open court. Cane was quite innocent of wishing to destroy the will, and  could deny the possible assertion on oath. But he knew well that however guiltless  a man may be, there are always those who quote the &ldquo;No smoke without fire&rdquo;  proverb. Therefore Cane was sincerely glad to have the matter settled without  dispute, and for that very reason had given Enistor a cheque on his private  account. When the Squire departed, the little man felt that all danger was at  an end.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  arrived back at Polwellin in very good spirits, as for many a long year he had  not handled so large a sum of money. Being of a luxurious nature he bought many  unnecessary things, and spent on himself a considerable sum which could have  been used for better purposes. However, on the sprat-to-catch-a-mackerel  theory, he set aside a certain ample amount for Alice&rsquo;s season in London.  Acting the part of a fond father, he told her that she was to spare no expense,  but to have all she wanted in the matter of clothes and jewellery and  enjoyment. The girl was secretly amazed at this sudden kindness on the part of  her usually neglectful parent, but being young, and being a woman, she gladly  took advantage of the opportunity to purchase pretty things. In the selection  of frocks and hats and feminine frippery she had the benefit of Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s  taste, and the little woman congratulated her on having so lavish a father.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  will like Amy when you know her better,&rdquo; Hardwick had said to Alice, when the  subject of chaperonage was broached; &ldquo;but you will soon grow tired of her. Her  sole idea in life is chiffons. She will be delighted to introduce you into her  particular set of frivolous kill-time wastrels, but with your nature, Alice,  you will never meet a man at her house likely to appeal to you as a husband!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This  was perfectly true, as in spite of her youth Miss Enistor was a thoughtful  girl, who wanted more food for her mind than an endless round of bridge-parties  and whist-drives and Cinderella dances and theatre visits, coupled with airy  gossip about this person and that. Mrs. Barrast was only too pleased to  chaperon a tolerably pretty girl of good family who was possessed of plenty of  money, and she did her best to give her guest an amusing time. But what Julian  prophesied soon came to pass. Alice grew weary of the dainty little woman&rsquo;s  frivolity and shallow nature. It was like an industrious bee living with a  butterfly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are a darling,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barrast when Alice had been a week in the charming  house in Hans Crescent; &ldquo;quite the nicest thing I ever met. And your good looks  don&rsquo;t clash with mine. That is so satisfactory, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not good-looking,&rdquo; said Alice soberly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course not. Good-looking is a word which one applies to a man. But you are  lovely in a moonlight, misty kind of vapoury way,&rdquo; babbled the other. &ldquo;I think  you look charming in that mourning, and Madame Coralie has such good taste. I  wish you would marry Julian, dear: you are just the sort of romantic  head-in-the-clouds darling he loves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Julian  would not suit me, nor would I suit Julian,&rdquo; said Miss Enistor decidedly. &ldquo;We  have arranged to be brother and sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Barrast sighed. &ldquo;Such a dull relationship. Frederick and I live together  something in the same way. Of course he&rsquo;s my husband and I&rsquo;m his wife, although  I don&rsquo;t know why I ever married him. But he goes his own way to Blue Books and  politics and vestry-meetings and those horridly dull things, while I go mine, seeking  for a heart that will understand me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is a dangerous quest, Mrs. Barrast,&rdquo; said Alice seriously.</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Barrast pounced on her guest with many kisses. &ldquo;You chilly darling, why don&rsquo;t  you call me Amy, as I have asked you to again and again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well  then, Amy, you should not let all these young men make love to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  they will, my dear. There is something about me which draws them in spite of  themselves, poor dears. And after all I don&rsquo;t mean anything wrong, you know,  Alice. Platonic friendships are my delight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is a dangerous word between a married woman and an unmarried man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dangerous  quest: dangerous word. My dear, you talk as if you were one hundred and forty  years of age,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Barrast petulantly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have lived much alone and have thought deeply, Amy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  my dear, you shouldn&rsquo;t think. It always wrinkles one dreadfully to think, you  know. Frederick thinks and just look at him. One would take him to be my  grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  like Mr. Barrast very much,&rdquo; said Alice quietly, and she did, for the master of  the house was the only person to whom she could talk sensibly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Run  away with him then. No,&rdquo; Mrs. Barrast reflected, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do that. After all  Frederick is rich and my husband, though I don&rsquo;t know why I married him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Would  you have married him had he been poor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Barrast screamed in a pretty playful way. &ldquo;Of course not, darling. What odd  things you say. All Frederick&rsquo;s attraction lies in his money and his brains. He  is clever, you know, and is too much taken up with politics to look at any  other woman, which is so satisfactory. I was so poor when I met him that I was  glad to marry him. And I&rsquo;m sure I make him a very good wife, Alice,&rdquo; ended Mrs.  Barrast in an injured tone, &ldquo;so you needn&rsquo;t raise your eyebrows in that nasty  sort of way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  only meant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know what you mean. It&rsquo;s sure to be something to do with Dr. Watts&rsquo;s hymns, as  you are that sort of girl. I wish you weren&rsquo;t so particular about mourning,  dear, as then I could take you to heaps and heaps of places where one can have  a really good time. We&rsquo;ll go to Hurlingham this afternoon. Now you can&rsquo;t  refuse. I&rsquo;ve set my heart on your going to Hurlingham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It  was little use Alice refusing, as Mrs. Barrast was one of those desperately  persistent people who always get their own way. Miss Enistor, who had been fond  of her Aunt Lucy, really wished to go out as little as possible, and but that  she was anxious to escape from gloomy Tremore and the attentions of Don Pablo,  would never have come to live with the butterfly. However, her hostess was so  kind, and Alice was so young, and the contrast between London life and Cornish  life was so great, that she really did enjoy herself immensely. Besides there  was always Frederick to talk to, a tall grave man with iron-grey hair, who  treated his pretty young wife in a most indulgent manner, and was as amused  with her shallow frivolity as Richelieu must have been with the pranks of his  kittens. There was really no harm in the dainty little woman and, in spite of  her platonic philanderings, she never gave Frederick any serious cause for  rebuke. One cannot be angry with a morsel of thistledown, and that is the best  description of Mrs. Barrast. Always charmingly dressed and delightfully  vivacious, she floated from house to house in a frolicsome fairy kind of way.  Dullness fled when Mrs. Barrast entered a room.</p>
  <p align="left">It  was strange that so airy and nimble-witted a woman should be the sister of a  stolid giant like Julian, with his serious views of art and life. But he was  very fond of Amy Barrast, although she flouted his advice and told him  frequently that he was as dull as tombs, a witticism she had picked up from an  American admirer. Hardwick came several times to London while Alice stayed in  Hans Crescent, but always returned to his beloved west country, as the  frivolity of his sister&rsquo;s circle was altogether too much for him. By this time  he had accepted the r&ocirc;le of Miss Enistor&rsquo;s brother, and the two were most  confidential.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are  you tired of all this, Alice?&rdquo; asked Julian, after a particularly frivolous luncheon.  &ldquo;This rubbish must bore one of your thoughtful disposition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice,  who was looking unusually charming, laughed gaily. &ldquo;I have left my thoughtful  disposition at Tremore,&rdquo; she said in a light tone. &ldquo;While I am in Rome I must  do as the Romans do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do?&rdquo;  said Hardwick; &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t do anything!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  they do, Julian. They work harder than any labourer to kill time. I do not  think that I should like to lead this life always, but it is a change from the  dullness of Polwellin, you know. The month I have been here has improved my  health and spirits. I am sure that I thought too much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Possibly!  All work and no play is as bad as all play and no work. When do you return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have no settled time to return. Father says that I can stay as long as I like.  Though of course I don&rsquo;t want to outstay my welcome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t, Alice. Never think that. Amy likes to have you here, and Frederick says  that you are the most sensible girl he ever met. You should go with Amy to  Cowes later on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  shook her head. &ldquo;I am not sure. I must go back some time or another, as father  won&rsquo;t let me remain away for ever. Besides I really think that I shall grow  weary of pleasure. Blue skies and constant sunshine bore one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  I quite understand. But remember when you come back you will again be exposed  to the attentions of that old mummy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  shuddered. &ldquo;Don Pablo? Is he as often at Tremore as ever?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;More  often. And when he isn&rsquo;t at Tremore, your father goes to his cottage on the  moors. I can&rsquo;t understand why your father likes him so much. There seems to be  something evil about Narvaez.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Alice laid a trembling hand on his arm; &ldquo;have you felt that also?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  I&rsquo;m not a sensitive chap as a rule, but Narvaez makes me uncomfortable&mdash;just  like Mr. Hyde in Stevenson&rsquo;s story, you know. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t consent to  be his wife, Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  certainly shall not, whatever my father may say. At the worst I can always  marry you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  isn&rsquo;t a compliment,&rdquo; murmured Hardwick, mortified.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  you know what I mean. I respect you and like you, even if I don&rsquo;t love you,  Julian. And if I did marry you I should never give you cause to complain of  coldness on my part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Alice&rdquo;&mdash;his face lighted up.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  No! No! The compact still stands. Until I am driven into a corner we are only  brother and sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course. It&rsquo;s an odd arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  I admit that, and only a really kind-hearted, sensible man such as you are  would understand and keep to such an arrangement. Sometimes I think I am doing  wrong in holding you to our compact, but on reflection I don&rsquo;t think that I am  doing wrong. If you loved me as a man should love a woman, it would be  different and then I should be playing with fire. But you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Julian honestly, &ldquo;you are quite right. I like you: I have a deep affection  for you, and at all costs would protect your happiness. But I am quite sure now  that I don&rsquo;t love you in the way you would like to be loved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  drew a deep breath of relief. &ldquo;How nice to hear you talk so reasonably, Julian.  We quite understand one another, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Quite,&rdquo;  he hesitated, and then spoke softly. &ldquo;Have you seen any one who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interrupted the girl hastily; &ldquo;you said that I should meet  with no one to suit me here. Not that I am looking out for a husband, you know,  Julian!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  do know. All the same you are sure to come across Prince Charming some day, and  then I shall surrender my guardianship to him. You are certain to choose some  nice fellow, who won&rsquo;t mind our continuing our brother and sister arrangement  when you are Mrs. Somebody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo;  said the girl dubiously; &ldquo;if Mr. Somebody loves me, he may object to a triangle  of that sort. Besides, you may marry yourself, Julian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  may,&rdquo; said Hardwick in his stolid way, &ldquo;but at present I am at your service as  a stop-gap husband if Don Pablo and your father drive you into a corner, Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  dreadfully immoral a stop-gap husband sounds!&rdquo; laughed Miss Enistor, but  appreciated the offer all the same. It was impossible to combat alone two  strong natures like those of her father and Narvaez; therefore to have Hardwick  on her side was a great gain. Nothing would ever induce her to marry Don Pablo.  Alice was certain of that.</p>
  <p align="left">But  as speedy events proved it was not necessary for Julian to hold himself at Miss  Enistor&rsquo;s disposal in this loyal way. Six weeks after Alice was in London,  circumstances brought about the meeting with Montrose. The girl knew that this  young man had inherited her aunt&rsquo;s money, but as Enistor, when informing her of  the fact, had said nothing very bitter, she had no grudge against the fortunate  legatee. Certainly she regretted the loss for her father&rsquo;s sake, but decided  with instinctive fairness that Lady Staunton had a right to do what she would  with her own. Alice had seen but little of her aunt in past years, although the  old lady had sometimes invited her to pay a visit. Consequently she had heard  nothing of Montrose, and wondered what he was like. When Mrs. Barrast mentioned  the name, Alice was curious to see the young man. And there was every chance that  she would, as it appeared that Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s doctor wished to bring him to  dinner.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  Dr. Eberstein is such a delightful man that any friend of his is certain to be  a darling,&rdquo; babbled the little woman. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t met my doctor, have you,  dear. He attends me for nerves! I am a great sufferer from nerves, and I&rsquo;m sure  if those Christian martyrs they make such a fuss over suffered as much as I do,  I quite understand them being praised. But I am sure they never did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have  you ever met Mr. Montrose?&rdquo; asked Alice anxiously, for she wanted to have a  sketch of the young man beforehand.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  my dear. Dr. Eberstein says he is very handsome and very nice, and has a lot of  money!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is quite true, Amy. Mr. Montrose inherited my aunt&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  my dear, what a disagreeable thing for you. I shall write to Dr. Eberstein and  say that I can&rsquo;t ask him and his friend to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; asked Alice bluntly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  you don&rsquo;t want to meet a man who has robbed you of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  has not robbed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your  father, I mean, Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor  my father, Amy. Lady Staunton had a perfect right to do what she liked with her  money. My father is not at all annoyed, nor am I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  a perfect, Christian feeling!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Barrast; &ldquo;and how odd that you  shouldn&rsquo;t be angry! How much money have you lost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;None  at all,&rdquo; said Miss Enistor rather impatiently; &ldquo;but my aunt left Mr. Montrose  five thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  how dreadful! My dear, if I were in your shoes I should scratch his eyes out.  Of course your father is rich&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  father is very poor. I only had this season in town because my aunt did leave  him a little money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your  father is poor! That makes his conduct and yours the odder, if there is such a  word. I think it&rsquo;s very unjust, a sister not leaving her money to a brother and  keeping it in the family. My dear,&rdquo; added Mrs. Barrast impressively, &ldquo;this  wrong must be put right. You shall marry this young man, if he is nice and  agreeable. Then the money will come back to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  make such plans, Amy. I don&rsquo;t want to marry any one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear, that&rsquo;s quite immoral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  nonsense! If you begin to be a match-maker I shall refuse to meet Mr. Montrose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  you don&rsquo;t want me to ask him to dinner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ask  him if you like: only don&rsquo;t expect me to fall into his arms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As  if I expected you to do anything so silly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barrast, and withdrew to  pen her invitation to the doctor and his friend. By this time, in her own mind,  she was quite determined to arrange a match between Montrose and Alice, being  one of those busybodies who will meddle with what does not concern them in the  least. But Mrs. Barrast did not look at her proposed scheming in this light.  She thought she was behaving very kindly to Alice.</p>
  <p align="left">The  girl herself was really anxious to meet Montrose now that there was a chance of  doing so. Never having felt the want of money, she had not given much thought  to the loss of the inheritance, and did not know how vexed her father was to  see Montrose get the income. Enistor had particularly refrained from expressing  his vexation, since he did not wish Alice to be biased against the fortunate  youth. Therefore Alice was quite prepared to be just towards Montrose, and to  like him, if his personality appealed to her. A very unsophisticated maiden was  Miss Enistor. In a similar position Mrs. Barrast would have schemed to recover  the lost fortune by marriage, if the man had been as ugly as a Cyclops, and  indeed, as can be seen, really did intend to right things in this way. But  Alice was quite content to let Montrose remain a bachelor and enjoy the money  after his own fashion.</p>
  <p align="left">Mr.  Barrast had to attend to his political duties on the evening appointed for the  dinner, which was perhaps the reason why his frivolous wife selected that  special evening. Frederick was a kill-joy, she said, and moreover she did not  wish to ask an extra woman to dinner. Mr. Montrose could attend to Alice and  she, as the hostess, could attend to Dr. Eberstein. They would enjoy a pleasant  meal, and afterwards could chat and have music in the drawing-room. Also Dr.  Eberstein might be induced to tell their fortune, or prophesy events, or do  wonderful things which, according to Mrs. Barrast, he was capable of doing when  willing. As a matter of fact, Eberstein had the reputation of being a psychic  doctor, and of knowing more about the unseen than most people. But in spite of  Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s babbling, he never by any chance performed the wonders which she  spoke about. All the same, with the pertinacity of her nature Mrs. Barrast  intended to ask him to give an exhibition of his powers, and as Frederick did  not approve of such things, this was another reason why she chose an evening  when he would be engaged. &ldquo;Frederick is quite a heathen, you know, dear,&rdquo; said  Mrs. Barrast, when the two ladies were in the drawing-room waiting for the two  guests, &ldquo;he says that to help poor people is better than being religious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To  help the poor is  to be religious,&rdquo; said Alice quietly.</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Barrast made a grimace and looked in a near mirror to see that her hair was in  good order. &ldquo;Oh, I know you are that sort of person also, dear. Julian tells me  that you are hand in glove with your vicar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  vicar of Polwellin is a good man, Amy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  dull! I never did like good people, who are fond of the ragged poor and  starving children and all that slum sort of thing. Though I&rsquo;m sure I have  helped dozens of times in bazaars and charity dances to get money for them. And  I really needed the money more than they did,&rdquo; concluded Mrs. Barrast  plaintively.</p>
  <p align="left">She  flitted round the drawing-room in her usual restless manner, arranging the  flowers, rearranging the many useless objects of luxury, and generally passing  the time in meddling, chattering continuously. The drawing-room was suggestive  of her brainless nature, as it was filled with costly things of no possible use;  frivolous rubbish that had taken her fancy for the moment and then had been  more or less forgotten. There was ample space, plenty of light and colour, and  all the appliances of civilisation for an easy, luxurious existence. But repose  was lacking, as the hostess had communicated to the room some of her abnormal  restlessness. Mrs. Barrast was always screwed up to concert pitch and never  gave herself, or any one in her vicinity, a single moment of peace. This  incessant desire to say something or to do something, however silly, was  gradually forcing Alice to consider seriously the necessity of cutting short  her visit. There was an excess of oxygen in the atmosphere of Mrs. Barrast that  disturbed the girl&rsquo;s serene nature.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  here they are at last,&rdquo; cried the hostess with another glance into the mirror,  as her quick ear caught a sound outside the door. &ldquo;I am so glad, as I am so  hungry. Then you see, dear&mdash;oh, Dr. Eberstein, how are you? So very glad to see  you. And Mr. Montrose! It is Mr. Montrose, isn&rsquo;t it? How do you do? So pleased to  meet you. Dr. Eberstein, this is Miss Enistor, who is staying with me for a few  weeks. Mr. Montrose, Miss Enistor. And now we can go to dinner. I am sure you  are both dying for food!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  doctor bowed gravely to Alice and remained somewhat in the background talking,  or rather listening, to the voluble Mrs. Barrast. It seemed as if he had  stepped back to be a spectator of the meeting between the younger people, for  Alice felt, rather than saw, that his eyes were upon her. But she was too much  taken up with Montrose to consider this for a moment. The young man advanced  silently, a tall slim figure, graceful and virile. His dark eyes were fixed on  Alice in a puzzled sort of way, as if something about her perplexed him  greatly. On her part, the girl rose from the chair to meet his gaze more  directly than was consistent with the first introduction of a youth and a  maiden. She did not know why he appeared to be familiar to her. It was not his  looks, for these were new to her. But in his eyes there was something which  hinted that he was less a stranger than a very dear friend. Of course, what  knowledge of reincarnation she had gained from her father told her that the  body was nothing and the soul was everything. Certainly she had never seen  Montrose before in the flesh, but through his eyes there looked a soul which  she knew. All this flashed through her troubled mind in a second and the blood  crimsoned her face as she impulsively held out her hand.</p>
  <p align="left">With  a soft quick indrawn breath the young man took it. He was evidently as  perplexed as she was. Only by an effort did he release the girl&rsquo;s slim hand and  find his voice.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am glad to meet you, Miss Enistor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">His  voice broke the spell, and Alice became aware&mdash;at least she thought as much&mdash;that  she had been acting foolishly. Of course he would be confused to meet the niece  of the lady whose money he had inherited. That was the reason of his odd look  and strange silence. But she would put him at his ease at once, since there was  nothing to be gained by being stiff with a perfectly innocent person. And  then&mdash;here came in the momentary memory again&mdash;she liked him at sight more than  any one she had ever seen. She repeated his words.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am glad to meet you, Mr. Montrose!&rdquo; and then the two smiled at one another in a  somewhat embarrassed way.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  the gong,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Barrast gaily, &ldquo;your arm, doctor. We shall have a  pleasant dinner and a delightful evening!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am sure of that, Mrs. Barrast,&rdquo; said the other positively. &ldquo;The evening has  commenced most auspiciously.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  asked herself what he meant and laid her hand on Montrose&rsquo;s arm. She did not  get an answer to her mental question until much later.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_VI"><b>Chapter VI</b></a><b><br>
    A Conversation</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Dinner  was served, not in the large dining-room, used on high days and festivals, but  in a small octagonal apartment, reserved for such minor occasions. Its walls  were of polished white wood, gaily painted with wreaths of flowers bound with  knots of blue ribbon and held by naked cupids, dimpled and rosy. There was a  blue-tiled fire-place in which stood a brass cradle for the flaming coals,  though at present, the weather being warm, this was filled with ferns and  bulrushes. The ceiling was painted with sunset clouds, the carpet was  moss-green sprinkled with bunches of daisies, and the furniture was of  cream-coloured wood. In the centre stood a round table of no great size, at  which the hostess and her guests took their seats. Two smart parlour-maids  attended to their wants, as Mrs. Barrast preferred to dispense with footmen and  butler, save when she gave a state dinner to people she did not care about.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Frederick&rsquo;s  friends, you know,&rdquo; she explained airily, when unfolding her napkin. &ldquo;The  people who like things-as-they-ought-to-be. I think  things-as-they-ought-not-to-be are more amusing myself. More of a surprise, you  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  you pushed that theory to extremes, Mrs. Barrast,&rdquo; said Dr. Eberstein in a dry  way, &ldquo;you would find the world excessively disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know, doctor. People in society all say the same things and do the same  things and think the same things. I adore originality myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  originality made you uncomfortable you would change your mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  daresay. But that would be no novelty. I am always changing my mind!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Consequently  your nervous system gets out of order and you have to come to me to have it set  right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  I and others did not come to you where would your practice be?&rdquo; asked Mrs.  Barrast, accepting fish from the parlour-maid. &ldquo;If one didn&rsquo;t change one&rsquo;s mind  the world would stand still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dr.  Eberstein laughed. &ldquo;That is a deeper remark than you guess, Mrs. Barrast,&rdquo; he  said quietly. &ldquo;But there is one change of mind and another change of mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; the frivolous little woman opened her eyes widely, &ldquo;if there were not  another change of mind there would be no change at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;True,  O Queen! You speak wiser than you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell  Frederick that, doctor. He says I have no ideas, and what I have aren&rsquo;t ideas  at all. No! I don&rsquo;t mean that! But he says&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what  Frederick says. Nobody ever does, especially when he gets up to make a speech  in the House. But he&rsquo;s a dear fellow all the same, and do try that hock,  doctor. It is particularly good!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  smiled and refused, as he drank nothing but water. He looked on Mrs. Barrast as  an irresponsible delightful child, who had everything to learn, yet who could  not be taught, as it was impossible for her to concentrate her attention for  one whole minute. A butterfly herself, she chased other butterflies and danced  along a sunny path careless of whither she was going. The doctor knew that in  the nature of things she would have to learn what life meant some day: but did  not tell her so. Mrs. Barrast would not have understood him if he had.</p>
  <p align="left">While  eating and listening to the remarks of Montrose, the youngest member of the  party stole frequent looks at Eberstein. He was not very tall, rather stout,  some years over fifty, and had a healthy clean-shaven face. Alice by no means  considered him handsome, but when he smiled there was a kind and helpful look  in his grey eyes which drew her to him. She felt that he was cool, wise,  tolerant, and anxious to aid his fellow mortals. Mr. Montrose&mdash;so ran her  thoughts&mdash;was very fortunate to have such a friend. In the hour of need  Eberstein would prove staunch. Alice was positive of this although she had no  experience of the man&rsquo;s nature. But added to the ordinary feminine intuition  she possessed a subtle clairvoyant instinct, undeveloped though it was, and  without any positive proof she would have staked her existence on Eberstein&rsquo;s  being a really good and helpful man. One in a thousand.</p>
  <p align="left">But  as a woman her feelings inclined to Montrose, since he was extremely handsome  and likewise fascinating. The unusual combination of auburn hair and dark eyes  was striking, and his clearly cut features of the Greek type impressed her with  a sense of belonging to a thoroughbred stock. His shapely body, his slim hands  and feet, his lithe active strength, suggested a racehorse perfection. A  well-formed head showed that he had brains, and a resolute chin revealed  courage and decision. Altogether Miss Enistor was favourably impressed with the  looks of the young man who had inherited Lady Staunton&rsquo;s money, and thought  that he would make good use of it. As to her other feeling, of his soul being  familiar to her, she had not yet reasoned that out in a way to satisfy herself.  At present all she knew was that she and Montrose seemed to be old  acquaintances, and they chatted as if they were friends of many years&rsquo;  standing. Mrs. Barrast remarked this.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  two get on very well together,&rdquo; she said shrewdly, when the dessert was placed  on the table, and Eberstein smiled when she made the remark.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  seem to suit one another,&rdquo; was Montrose&rsquo;s reply: then added, to avert personal  remarks on the part of Mrs. Barrast: &ldquo;I wonder how it is that one is repelled  by some people and drawn to others at first sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ask  Miss Enistor for the explanation,&rdquo; said Eberstein quietly.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  was startled by the directness of his speech. &ldquo;How do you know that I can  explain, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Dr. Eberstein knows all manner of things other people don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; chimed in  the hostess. &ldquo;I am quite afraid of him sometimes. He is as wise as the sea and  as deep!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  as useful, I hope,&rdquo; said the doctor, smiling genially. &ldquo;However, Montrose has  not yet asked Miss Enistor for a reply to his question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  young man laughed and looked at the flower-like face of his neighbour with  great admiration. &ldquo;How is it some people repel while others attract?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  doctrine of reincarnation explains,&rdquo; replied the girl, forced to answer plainly  while the doctor&rsquo;s calm, grey eyes were on her. &ldquo;Those people who repel have  done one an injury in some previous life: those who attract have done good, or  at least have been friendly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Likewise  in other lives?&rdquo; questioned the doctor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course. Although I do not know if you believe in reincarnation?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  Mrs. Barrast uttered a little shriek and dabbled her fingers in the bowl of  rose-water at her elbow. &ldquo;He believes in all manner of dreadful things, my  dear. How he can do so I cannot understand, when he is so clever. I think  reincarnation is rubbish myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  no! no!&rdquo; protested Montrose.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What!  You believe in our having lived before also? Really it is very odd and queer of  you. Alice too. My dear, where did you learn such awful nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;From  my father,&rdquo; said Miss Enistor dryly; &ldquo;and if you met him, Amy, you would not  think he was the man to teach nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  he&rsquo;s got a bee in his bonnet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  doesn&rsquo;t wear a bonnet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Alice, you know perfectly well what I mean. He&rsquo;s crazy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Miss  Enistor laughed. &ldquo;I think my father is the sanest person I have ever met, Amy.  Why shouldn&rsquo;t reincarnation be a great truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t in the Bible,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barrast pettishly, for the conversation being  beyond her was somewhat boring to her small intellect. &ldquo;And what isn&rsquo;t in the  Bible is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are of the Caliph Omar&rsquo;s opinion with regard to the Koran when he ordered the  library of Alexandria to be burnt,&rdquo; observed Eberstein; &ldquo;but if you will read  St. Matthew, verse 14, chapter xi, you will find that reincarnation is plainly  acknowledged. Also in St. John&rsquo;s Gospel, chapter ix, verses 2 and 3, it is  plainly hinted at. Origen, the most learned of the Christian Fathers, believed  in the law of rebirth and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s all nonsense,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Barrast, weary of the explanation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  be it,&rdquo; admitted the doctor quietly, &ldquo;it is all nonsense. Your brain is the measure of  the universe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. Frederick says that I haven&rsquo;t any brain to  speak of: as if I could live if I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barrast incoherently. &ldquo;Let  us have coffee here while you gentlemen smoke. Oh, I forgot: you don&rsquo;t smoke,  doctor. Mr. Montrose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; and the young man accepted a cigarette from Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s own particular  case. &ldquo;You smoke yourself, I see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  yes.&rdquo; Mrs. Barrast lighted her little roll of tobacco. &ldquo;It soothes me. I am all  nerves, you know. Alice, will you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  thank you. I am not all nerves!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I wonder you aren&rsquo;t, living in Cornwall with sea-gulls and moors and those  sort of things. You will like this coffee, Dr. Eberstein. There is a vanilla  bean in each cup, which makes it so nice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  good coffee,&rdquo; said the other, sipping gravely, and wondering if Mrs. Barrast  was aware of the rubbish she talked.</p>
  <p align="left">The  little woman apparently was not, as she conversed volubly, darting from this  subject to that after the manner of a swallow. She mentioned several novels  which had attracted her frivolous attention, talked of some musical comedies  she had seen, criticised the fashions, told one or two tales dealing with  scandals concerning various people, and in every way monopolised the  conversation, until it was time to return to the drawing-room. Alice, who  wished to converse with Montrose, was pleased when this move was made, as it  appeared to be the only chance of ending Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s airy nothings. For a  few moments she was alone with her hostess and seized the chance of asking if  Dr. Eberstein was a German.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  suppose he is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barrast gravely, &ldquo;his name sounds like it. But I can&rsquo;t  say what he is. He talks all languages as well as he talks English, and never  says anything about his father and mother. But he&rsquo;s very nice, isn&rsquo;t he, Alice?  A kind of soul-doctor, you know, who tells his patients that mind is stronger  than matter. Not exactly Christian Science, but something like it. He has never  come to dinner before. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know why, as I have asked him dozens of  times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  thought that she knew the reason, which had to do with Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s frothy  chatter, but was too polite to put her idea into words. &ldquo;What do you think of  Mr. Montrose?&rdquo; she asked, anxious for a second opinion.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-looking  but stupid,&rdquo; was Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s verdict; &ldquo;not a second idea in his head. However,  he has money&mdash;your money, dear, so you ought to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  has not got my money,&rdquo; said Miss Enistor tartly, &ldquo;and even if he had I  certainly should not marry him for his wealth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  daresay: you are such a funny girl. Not at all like a human being. It&rsquo;s silly  not to eat a pear that has fallen into your mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Montrose being the pear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course. He is head over ears in love with you already. I&rsquo;m not his style  evidently. Not that I care,&rdquo; ended Mrs. Barrast, caring very much indeed. &ldquo;Go  in and win, Alice, and let me design the bridesmaids&rsquo; dresses. Pink silk and  white&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Barrast&rsquo;s chatter about chiffons was put a stop to by the entrance of the  gentlemen. As if it had been arranged, Dr. Eberstein walked over to Mrs.  Barrast and engaged her in conversation. Montrose hesitated, then came to the  corner wherein Alice was seated. He looked extremely handsome and attractive;  she was more than ever taken with his appearance. Smiling amiably, she made  room for him to sit down beside her on the ottoman, but waited for him to begin  the conversation. He did so with an abruptness which startled her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  hope you are not my enemy,&rdquo; said the young man earnestly.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;Why should I be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  you see Lady Staunton left me her money!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  not, Mr. Montrose? It was her own money!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  But do you think it was right that she should leave it away from her relations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  she wished to. Why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t regret the loss?&rdquo; He looked at her very directly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  at all. I have never given the matter any consideration.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  your father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is quite satisfied with the legacy left to him by Aunt Lucy,&rdquo; said Alice  unhesitatingly, for she knew nothing of Enistor&rsquo;s wrath about the loss.</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  drew a long breath of relief. &ldquo;I am glad to hear you say that,&rdquo; he said  thankfully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, Miss Enistor, that, when I heard of my  good fortune, it was my first intention to surrender the money to your father.  I was persuaded not to do so by Dr. Eberstein.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is a friend of yours?&rdquo; she asked carelessly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  best friend a man ever had: the best friend a man could have. He cares for  nothing save to do good. I see you raise your eyebrows, thinking of how he  advised me to keep Lady Staunton&rsquo;s money. But he did so, because it was necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  demanded Alice point-blank.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell you. He said it was necessary, so I obeyed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Would  you have obeyed him if he had told you to give my father the money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Montrose truthfully and unhesitatingly. &ldquo;And to put it plainly, Miss  Enistor, it is harder for me to keep the money than to surrender it. I don&rsquo;t  require so large an income.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet  my father heard from Mr. Cane that you were poor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  poor. I was starving when I first made Lady Staunton&rsquo;s acquaintance, Miss  Enistor. My parents died when I was a child, and I was brought up by an old  aunt in Edinburgh. When I was eighteen years of age she passed away, leaving me  what little she had. I came to London with the idea of writing poetry and  plays. But my work would not sell, and when my money came to an end, I starved  until I managed to drift into journalism. Even then I only managed to keep body  and soul together in a Bloomsbury garret. When I saved your aunt&rsquo;s life, she  gave me employment as her secretary to deal with her many charities. But I  assure you that she never expressed any intention of leaving her money to me.  If she had, I should have objected, since her brother was alive. However, she  did leave me this large income, and I was ready to give it up, until Eberstein told  me it was necessary to keep it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  wonder why?&rdquo; said Alice thoughtfully, and greatly interested in the story he  had told.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Eberstein  will not tell me. But he has a good reason for what he says and I always obey  him, knowing his true friendship. A few years ago I was dying of starvation and  pneumonia in my attic, and he saved my life. Since then I have been with him  constantly. As you believe in reincarnation, Miss Enistor, I may as well tell  you that there is some tie between you and me dating from former lives. What it  is I cannot say, as Eberstein refuses to explain. He brought me here to-night  to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Alice darted a swift piercing look at the young man&rsquo;s earnest face and wondered  if he was as guileless as he appeared to be. &ldquo;How did he know that I was here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s doctor, you know,&rdquo; said Montrose simply.</p>
  <p align="left">The  girl did not reply immediately. She was considering if there was not some  conspiracy on foot to entangle her in a marriage bond. Dr. Eberstein looked  kindly and sympathetic, yet for his own ends he might have brought herself and  Montrose together. Was he an honest man, or a schemer? Was Montrose his victim,  or his accomplice? And what had she to do with either of the two men? As she  thought thus, there came a wave of that same overpowering influence which she  had felt in the Tremore dining-room. It seemed to sweep away the suggestion of  evil with which she had almost unconsciously credited Eberstein and his young  friend. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said faintly and turned white.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are  you ill?&rdquo; asked Montrose, alarmed. It was plain that he did not feel the  influence as she did.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  No! I shall be all right soon. The heat&mdash;&rdquo; here she broke off with a surprised  look. &ldquo;Why, I am  all right. I never felt better in my life. Did you feel anything just now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Feel  anything?&rdquo; Montrose looked puzzled. &ldquo;What do you mean, Miss Enistor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing  at all,&rdquo; she replied quickly and evasively, for she decided that it would not  do to be too frank with this young man until she knew more of him. &ldquo;Only the  heat, you know, and these dinners. I am a quiet country girl, Mr. Montrose, and  am not accustomed to London life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  like the country myself, Miss Enistor,&rdquo; sighed the young man wistfully. &ldquo;I have  long since wanted to live in the country, as London in some ways worries me. I  can&rsquo;t explain myself more fully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know what you feel like,&rdquo; said Alice, nodding wisely. &ldquo;You are sensitive as I  am. To be in the country is like being in clean water, while London is like  bathing in a dirty pool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  Montrose&rsquo;s face flushed and brightened. &ldquo;How did you guess?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because  I feel as you do. It is the evil thoughts that are in London which affect you.  My father knows something about psychic matters and has taught me a little.  That is why I believe in reincarnation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  nodded in his turn. &ldquo;Eberstein first spoke to me on the subject and placed life  in a new light before me. I used to wonder why I had such a bad time, and  complained greatly about my lot. But he made all things plain to me. I can bear  life&rsquo;s burdens now with a serene heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  was amused when she reflected on his position. &ldquo;You have health and wealth,  good looks and a good friend. It is easy to bear such burdens.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah,  but you forget that I went through many a long year of sorrow and bewildered  pain, Miss Enistor. Besides, money does not bring happiness. I never can be  enthusiastic over money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;People  with large incomes can afford to say that,&rdquo; said Alice cynically.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  that a hit at me?&rdquo; retorted Montrose good-humouredly; &ldquo;if so it misses its  mark, I assure you. I am quite willing to give back the money to your father if  Eberstein tells me to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  should you obey him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because  he knows more than I do. I look upon him as a guide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  shook her head. &ldquo;Every man should think for himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  Eberstein says,&rdquo; replied Montrose unexpectedly; &ldquo;and all he does is to give me  hints, leaving me to take them or reject them as I choose. Fortunately I know  how little I do know, and I am glad to have a more experienced man to help me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Experienced?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  In the things of this world and the next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  Dr. Eberstein religious then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  in the narrow sense in which the word religious is used. But he is a wonderful  man, as you will learn when you see more of him. I don&rsquo;t want you to think me  weak and without will-power, Miss Enistor, because I constantly quote  Eberstein. But the most accomplished general is glad to obey the guidance of a  man who knows the lie of the land when marching through the enemy&rsquo;s country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  enemy&rsquo;s country?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  might call the world so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Miss  Enistor moved restlessly. &ldquo;What an odd conversation we are having!&rdquo; she said in  a nervous way. &ldquo;We have only met to-night for the first time, and yet we are  quite confidential.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is better to talk as we are doing than to gossip,&rdquo; said Montrose sententiously.  &ldquo;And how do you know we have met for the first time to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have never seen you before,&rdquo; said the girl sharply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have not seen Douglas Montrose, nor have I seen Alice Enistor,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But  in other bodies, in other lives, we have been friends: the very best of  friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  do you know that?&rdquo; asked Alice, wilfully dense, although her heart endorsed  every word the young man said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Need  I explain?&rdquo; He stared at her hard.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she answered after a short pause. &ldquo;I can guess your meaning. When we shook  hands we were drawn together by&mdash;well, I can&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By  the friendship of the past!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she hesitated; &ldquo;I suppose so! But other people would think we were talking sad  nonsense, Mr. Montrose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  does it matter what other people think?&rdquo; said the young man calmly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  much. But one has to consider the world in which one lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mrs.  Barrast?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  No! No!&rdquo; Alice laughed outright and rose, as she felt that he was getting on  altogether too fast. &ldquo;She is very tolerant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is something in her favour, considering how narrow people are as a rule in this  world.&rdquo; Montrose got on his feet also. &ldquo;Before we join her and Eberstein, let  me hear you assure me that you do not look upon me as a grasping enemy who has  taken your father&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  assure you of that certainly,&rdquo; said the girl frankly, and gave him her hand  with a smile. &ldquo;If you had not mentioned the subject I should never have  referred to it. Keep the money, Mr. Montrose, and make what use you will of it.  Both my father and myself are quite content,&rdquo; and she said this about Enistor  once more, entirely unaware of its falsity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are good,&rdquo; said Montrose impetuously. &ldquo;Few people would take a loss so kindly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  like yourself I cannot get up any enthusiasm about money. Come, let us join  Mrs. Barrast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One  moment. Shall I see you again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  you like. I am staying here for a few weeks!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  I like.&rdquo; The young man&rsquo;s face was eloquent and the look in his eyes betrayed  his heart to Alice in a moment. With a laugh to hide her confusion she turned  away to join her hostess, and came face to face with Dr. Eberstein.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well  met, Miss Enistor,&rdquo; said the elder man in a genial manner and staring at her  very directly. &ldquo;I was just coming to take Montrose away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  called out Mrs. Barrast, &ldquo;he is going, and at eleven o&rsquo;clock too. So very  early. What can we do with the rest of the evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  advise bed,&rdquo; said Eberstein pointedly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bed  for me,&rdquo; endorsed Alice gaily. &ldquo;I feel rather tired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think you do,&rdquo; said the doctor calmly: and to Miss Enistor&rsquo;s surprise on  consideration she did not. But as he spoke she again felt a wave of that  strange uplifting influence and drew back, startled to find that it emanated  from the doctor. Eberstein smiled quietly, &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-night,  Mr. Montrose,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barrast pointedly. &ldquo;Next time you come, talk to me as  well as to Miss Enistor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  apologise for my bad manners,&rdquo; said Montrose quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  a compliment to me!&rdquo; laughed Alice, shrugging her shoulders.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  you understand me, I think, Miss Enistor,&rdquo; he looked at her straightly.</p>
  <p align="left">She  returned his look flushing. &ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; was her low reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Such  nonsense,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barrast irritably: for her the evening had not been a  success.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_VII"><b>Chapter VII</b></a><b><br>
    Behind The Scenes</b></h2>
  <p align="left">It  was a delightfully warm summer night when Eberstein and his young friend left  the house. For some little distance they walked on in silence, as Eberstein was  never voluble and Montrose felt disinclined to speak at the moment. Oblivious  of his surroundings, more or less, he moved mechanically by the doctor&rsquo;s side,  dreaming of Alice and of the love which existed between them. Considering he  had met her for the first time an hour or so previously, it seemed ridiculous,  even in a dream, to think that she had any such tender feeling for him. But  something in the deeps of his own nature was struggling to the surface to  assure him that his dream was truth. Much as he valued Eberstein&rsquo;s company, he  wished him away at the moment that he might puzzle out the meaning of this  strange intuition.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  that is impossible, just now,&rdquo; said the doctor quietly. &ldquo;I wish you to come to  my house, as I have much to say, and something to show.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  was startled, as he often was at Eberstein&rsquo;s speeches. &ldquo;You know what I am  thinking about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  that so strange?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  it isn&rsquo;t, really. You have extraordinary penetration. Sometimes I am quite  afraid of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are never afraid of me,&rdquo; replied Eberstein, shaking his head with a benevolent  smile. &ldquo;Think!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  Montrose reflected for a few moments. &ldquo;It is true. I am not afraid!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  doctor smiled approvingly. &ldquo;That is right. Fear would prevent my aiding you in  any way, and you need aid more than you guess. Remember what the Bible says, my  friend: &lsquo;In quietness and confidence shall be your strength.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Faith  and peace of mind are so hard to get,&rdquo; complained the young man sadly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  hard. The Blessed One said that the Path was difficult.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  Blessed One!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Christ:  your Master and mine,&rdquo; replied Eberstein solemnly. &ldquo;Strait is the gate and  narrow is the way which leadeth to life and few there be that find it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  those who do not find it are lost?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For  the time being, not eternally. God is very gentle with His straying sheep, and  we have many lives, many opportunities to find the way to the fold. You are  coming to the strait gate, Montrose; therefore my aid is given to you lest you  should faint on the hard uphill journey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not good enough even to approach the gate,&rdquo; sighed the young man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  you think! But the standard of goodness is not kept on earth, but in heaven, my  friend. However&rdquo;&mdash;Eberstein broke off to hail a taxi&mdash;&ldquo;we can talk of these  things when we reach my house. Get in, Montrose!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  young man did so, and was followed by his master, who told the chauffeur to  drive to Bloomsbury. Eberstein lived in that unfashionable district,  not-withstanding the fact that his practice lay largely amongst wealthy and  aristocratic people. Many of the doctor&rsquo;s patients wondered why he did not  select a better-class neighbourhood, but Eberstein never gave them any  information on this point. Yet his known character might have revealed the  reason to an ordinarily shrewd person very easily. The man was greatly given to  helping the poor and needy. Not so much the proverbial ragged paupers of the  slums&mdash;although he helped those also when necessary&mdash;as poor curates, badly paid  clerks, shabby governesses, struggling ladies, and such-like persons, who had  to keep up some sort of appearance on nothing. His money, his sympathy, his  medical skill, were all wholly at the service of those who could not pay, and  the fees received from his rich patients went to ameliorate the sufferings of  the self-respecting, who never complained and showed their pauperism as little  as was possible. Eberstein made no boast of his philanthropy: he never even  spoke of his many good works. It was perfectly natural for him to go silently  attentive about the work of his Master Christ, as he knew he could act in no  other way without going contrary to his whole being. To feed the hungry, to  clothe the naked, to teach the ignorant, to comfort the desolate: for these  purposes he was in the world.</p>
  <p align="left">In  one of his exploring expeditions Eberstein had found Montrose dying in a garret  and had set him on his legs again in a sympathetic brotherly way which had not  offended the young man&rsquo;s pride. More than that, he had supplied food for the  starving soul as well as for the starving body, and by explaining the riddles  of Life in a perfectly reasonable way he had entirely changed Montrose&rsquo;s outlook.  His prot&eacute;g&eacute; had been puzzled by this absolutely unselfish conduct, not  understanding from inexperience that no return was demanded for these great  gifts. But as his limitations began to expand through the teaching, he began to  comprehend, and finally he accepted Eberstein as a kind of angel in the flesh,  sent to help him in his hour of need. And the philanthropist was so  unaffectedly sincere, so reasonable and sympathetic, that the rescued man grew  to love him with a reverence rare in the younger generation. The doctor  restored his faith in human existence.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here  we are,&rdquo; said Eberstein, alighting from the taxi and dismissing it. &ldquo;We can now  have an undisturbed hour for conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  doctor admitted himself into the quiet house with his latch-key, as the  servants were all in bed. They were never kept up late by their considerate  employer, since he recognised that they required their necessary sleep. So the  two men entered the hall, ascended the stairs, and betook themselves to a large  room at the very top of the mansion. Eberstein kept this entirely to himself,  not even seeing his friends therein, much less his patients. Therefore it was  with some surprise and more curiosity that Montrose stepped into the apartment  and closed the door after him. Then he uttered an exclamation of pleasure&mdash;a  soft exclamation, for the atmosphere of the place suggested a church.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  a wonderful room,&rdquo; breathed Montrose, staring round him, &ldquo;and how holy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He  scarcely knew what caused him to utter the last word, unless it was the unusual  looks of the spacious room. Everything was white; the walls, the carpet, the  ceiling, and even the light which radiated from two large lamps with opaque  globes. The table, the few chairs, the bookcase, and the sofa were of white  wood with silken cushions like mounds of snow, and the draperies which veiled  the volumes and the windows were also the hue of milk. Yet there was no  suggestion of winter in the colourless expanse, for the air was warm and the  atmosphere so charged with perfect peace that Montrose felt quite at home. The  room, he felt, expressed Eberstein himself. It might have been the chapel of  The Holy Grail.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  never brought me here before,&rdquo; said the young man, feeling that his dark  garments were a blot on the purity of the surroundings, &ldquo;although you have  known me for three years, more or less.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  assented the doctor, seating himself before the table and indicating a chair  for his guest, &ldquo;it was not necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  it necessary to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  should not have brought you here, had it not been.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  why this night of all nights?&rdquo; persisted the other wonderingly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have met Miss Enistor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  was more bewildered than ever. &ldquo;What has she got to do with it, or with me, or  with anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ask  yourself,&rdquo; said Eberstein, and looked steadily into the eyes of Montrose.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  ask myself!&rdquo; murmured the guest, mechanically compelled to the speech.</p>
  <p align="left">Those  kind grey eyes on a level with his own a little distance away poured, as it  seemed, such a flood of light towards him that Montrose voluntarily closed his  own. Yet it was not a dazzling light which need have frightened him, but an  all-enfolding steady radiance, which bathed his whole being in luminous  splendour, until he felt that he was partaking of that peace of God which  passeth understanding. The tide of glory lifted him up higher and higher beyond  the gross envelope of the physical body until he felt himself soaring without  wings into an all-embracing sphere of glorious music which expressed itself in  colour. In this ocean of rainbow hues he floated, aware that he was using  super-physical senses to view super-physical scenes. On him descended, with the  swiftness of thought, a golden cloud more brilliant than the noonday sun, and  this dissolved away to reveal the form of a young girl clothed in floating  white draperies. The face was fair, the hair corn-coloured, the eyes deeply  blue and the figure majestic and graceful. Anything more unlike the elfin  beauty of Alice can scarcely be imagined. Yet he knew beyond all doubt that  this was Alice in another shape which she had worn in another clime under alien  stars. His soul flowed out to blend with her soul in one flame of unity. But  there was a barrier between them which Montrose strove to break through. Try as  he might he could not.</p>
  <p align="left">Even  in that heaven-world, despair seized him, when he found that the invisible  barrier withheld him from his beloved. On her side she seemed equally desirous  to come to him, and held out her arms in vain longing. On his face and her face  were looks of appealing love baffled by the impossibility of meeting heart to  heart. Then a shadow grew up between them swiftly; the shadow menacing and dark  of a yellow-skinned man, rather like a Chinese, from whose throat ran a stream  of blood. Who this man was Montrose could not tell, even though he had  recognised Alice in a different guise. And the enemy&mdash;Montrose felt that the  wounded creature was an enemy&mdash;grew larger and larger until the blackness of  which he was part blotted out the splendour of the girl. Blotted out also the  atmosphere of colour and music and radiancy, until Montrose, sinking downward  in the gloom, opened his physical eyes to find himself seated in the chair  opposite Eberstein. Only a single moment had elapsed, for the journey had been  as swift as that of Mahomet to the seventh heaven mounted on Al Borak, but he  seemed to have been away for hours. The discrepancy was to Montrose impossible  to reconcile, even though he grasped confusedly the fact that he had been&mdash;in  the Fourth Dimension say&mdash;where there is no time.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  now know what Alice Enistor has to do with you,&rdquo; said Eberstein in a quiet  impressive tone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t in one way,&rdquo; faltered the still bewildered young man, &ldquo;and yet I do in  another. All I can be certain of is that she is mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Undoubtedly.  She is yours and you are hers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  why could we not come together?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  shadow of your sin came between and parted you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  sin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  which you committed five thousand years ago,&rdquo; explained the doctor patiently. &ldquo;Then,  self-willed, self-centred, you would not wait the striking of the hour which  would have made you one, and therefore, seeking to obtain your desire by force,  you broke the Great Law. The Great Law broke you, as it breaks all who disobey.  For many ages your soul and her soul have been asunder, but now in the fullness  of time you meet again on this physical plane in new vestments of flesh. But  your sin has not yet been expiated, and you cannot yet be one with her you  love. The shadow stands between you twain and will stand until the debt is paid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  shadow&mdash;the man?&rdquo; stammered Montrose confusedly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  owe him a life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  he is my enemy. I feel strongly that he is my enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  was and is: it depends greatly upon you if he continues to be. If one obeys  truly the Law of Love, one must not be angered even with one&rsquo;s enemy. What says  the Blessed Son of the Most High God?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As  if the words had been placed in his mouth, Montrose replied softly: &ldquo;Love your  enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for  them which despitefully use you and persecute you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  bowed his stately head. &ldquo;Such is the Law of Love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Rubbing  his eyes to make certain that he was entirely awake, Montrose sought for an  interpretation. &ldquo;I do not quite understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no need for you to understand further, my friend. This much enlightenment  has been vouchsafed you through the mercy of God. For the rest you must work  and walk by faith, seeing as in a glass darkly, obeying the Great Law of your  own free will, so that your unselfish love may cause hatred to cease.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whose  hatred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  of the man you sinned against. Only with the aid of the Blessed One!&rdquo;&mdash;Eberstein  made the sign of the cross&mdash;&ldquo;can you prevent the Son of Perdition from  descending into the Abyss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who  is the Son of Perdition?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your  enemy, whom Christ loves as He loves you. Your task is to make yourself a  channel through which the grace of the Blessed One can freely pour for the  salvation of this erring soul. Oh, think how glorious it is that you should be  permitted to be the instrument of Christ in this mighty work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  I do not know how to go about the work!&rdquo; exclaimed the bewildered man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Watch  and pray, my son, for the time when you must act is near at hand. Only by  making yourself receptive to the holy influence will you know how to act when  the time is ripe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  will help me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am bound to help you since I am obedient to the Law. But much has to be done by  yourself, Montrose. I cannot command, as each man has free-will with which even  the Logos Himself does not interfere. Christ stands at the door of your heart,  but will not enter unless you invite His entrance. Only by doing what you ought  to do will the Spirit of Love enter and sup with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  what am I to do?&rdquo; demanded Montrose desperately.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ask  your own heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  says nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  time is not yet ripe for it to say anything. Watch and pray! Come,&rdquo; the doctor  spoke in a more matter-of-fact tone, &ldquo;it is growing late. Go home and sleep:  you are becoming exhausted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  tell me, Eberstein, if I am right in what I think,&rdquo; pleaded Montrose earnestly.  &ldquo;I know intuitively that I met Miss Enistor in some previous life and that I  loved her, as I love her now when we come together for the first time in this  incarnation. I had all the feeling of being her friend. Oh what do I say!  Friend is too weak a word&mdash;of being her lover. If I understand rightly, some sin  committed by me has parted us, and that sin I have to expiate before we can  come together again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is the case. But ask me no more now. With the aid of the Blessed One you must  work out your salvation in fear and trembling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indicate  my enemy and I shall forgive him for Alice&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; cried the young man with  impetuous generosity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  must forgive him for his own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  can I when I don&rsquo;t know why we are enemies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  will know when it is necessary you should know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  passed his hands across his brow and stood up slowly. &ldquo;It is all bewildering  and difficult.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  bewildering and very difficult. I answered that question earlier in the  evening. We talk in a circle. To do so is a waste of time. Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Another  question was trembling on Montrose&rsquo;s lips, but he refrained from putting it,  and with a silent hand-shake departed slowly. Accustomed to come and go at will  in this house, which was more a home to him than any habitation he had known,  the young man descended the stairs and let himself out into the silent square.  The balmy summer night was brilliant with stars, and charged with some  mysterious healing influence, which soothed and relaxed his weary nerves. On  all sides the great city was yet awake and alive with people, each one intent  upon the realisation of his or her desire. But here, isolated from the roaring  thoroughfares, the quadrangle was comparatively lonely and dark, as the  passers-by were few and the lights widely scattered. The central gardens, with  their trees and shrubs and turf and flowers, slept within the rusty iron  railings, speaking every now and then as a wandering breeze woke the leaves to  sigh and whisper. The hurrying steps of a wayfarer, the measured heavy tread of  a policeman, the murmur of distant life: Montrose heard these things without  hearing as it were, as without seeing he stared at the silent cats gliding  through the shadows. He walked along, wrapped up in his own thoughts, seeking  mechanically his rooms and bed.</p>
  <p align="left">Notwithstanding  his accession to considerable wealth, the fortunate youth had but slightly  changed his mode of living. He enjoyed better lodgings, better clothes, more  nourishing food, and was free from the obligation of compulsory work to exist.  But he still lived in unfashionable Bloomsbury, a quiet, inexpensive, and  somewhat recluse life, not seeking to enter what is known as society. With his  good looks and undeniable talents and newly acquired wealth, he would have been  welcome to the gay throng who flutter in the sunshine of pleasure. But there  was nothing in Montrose which responded to such aimless allurements. Once or  twice friends had taken him to this house and that, where the butterflies  gathered, and on this particular night Eberstein had induced him to dine at  Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s. But entertainments of all kinds bored Montrose immensely, and  only the presence of Alice had aided him to endure the shallow chatter of his  hostess and the artificiality of his surroundings. The after-events in  Eberstein&rsquo;s room had both startled and awed him, so that he was still greatly  moved by what had taken place when he reached his modest lodgings.</p>
  <p align="left">But,  as common sense told him, thinking would not help him, as his thoughts spun in  a circle and always brought him back to the same point. That point was the  meeting with Alice and the weird feelings which contact with her personality  had aroused in him. She belonged to his life in some way which he could not  quite put into words, and he belonged to hers. They were together and yet  apart, but what parted them it was impossible to say, as the vision had not  indicated in detail the especial sin, or what had led to the commission of that  sin. Soon he would know more&mdash;Eberstein had assured him of that. Therefore it  would be best to wait for the knowledge. He had been given light enough in the  darkness of the path to take the next step, and that light revealed Alice  waiting for him to come to her. He was only too willing to do so, as the  feeling that he loved her deeply grew with overwhelming swiftness. When she  knew what was in his heart and he knew what was in hers, then the next step  could be taken. What it might be and where it would lead to Montrose could not  say.</p>
  <p align="left">However,  the doctor had given him necessary instructions for the moment in the phrase &ldquo;Watch  and pray!&rdquo; To watch for the dawning love in Alice and to pray that he might be  worthy of such love seemed to be his task, and a very delightful task it would  be. Therefore Montrose knelt down and prayed with all his clean heart that  every possible blessing might befall the girl and that, if it was God&rsquo;s will,  he might become her husband to cherish and protect her. Then he went to bed in  a peaceful frame of mind. Sleep came to him almost immediately, but before his  eyes closed he felt that Alice was near him, and knew that in some wordless  manner Alice spoke to him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  have much to learn and there is pain in the learning,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;but we  are together to suffer together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Suffering  does not matter,&rdquo; said Montrose, as in a dream, &ldquo;we are together!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII"><b>Chapter VIII</b></a><b><br>
    Love&rsquo;s Young Dream</b></h2>
  <p align="left">After  the storm comes the calm, and when trouble has endured for a season peace  descends to refresh the exhausted soul. Montrose had suffered a great deal  during the five-and-twenty years of his present life, and it was time that he  should enjoy a rest. Ever since he could remember, dark clouds had enshrouded  him, and with a fainting heart he had groped his way through the gloom. The  meeting with Eberstein had been the end of sorrow and the beginning of joy, for  the doctor had bidden him raise his eyes to the hills made glorious by the  rising sun. With the legacy of Lady Staunton the dawn had come, but only when  he met Alice did Montrose feel that the sun was above the horizon. As by magic  the darkness was swept away, and now he walked in golden sunshine, no longer  alone. She was beside him, and he wondered how he could have endured life  without her dear presence. For the next three weeks he was in heaven rather  than on earth.</p>
  <p align="left">Of  course the first desire of Montrose was to share with Alice the wonderful  knowledge that he had acquired so strangely. But a note from Eberstein  prevented this. The doctor wrote that he was going abroad for a few weeks, and  that in the meanwhile Montrose was to tell the girl nothing of his late  experiences. &ldquo;Woo her as an ordinary youth woos an ordinary maid,&rdquo; said the  letter. &ldquo;She is yours and you are hers, so nothing can come between you for the  time being. I say for the time being, since there is an ordeal which you must  face before you stand before the altar. Whether you ever do stand there to take  her as your wife depends upon your courage and forbearance and love. Meantime  keep what you have seen and what you have heard to yourself. When I return I  shall explain what is necessary for you to know!&rdquo; This note was delivered the  first thing in the morning after Montrose&rsquo;s weird experience, and when he  called round to see Eberstein he found that the doctor had already departed for  Paris. There was nothing left for him to do but to obey instructions.</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  did this very willingly. After all he was a man living in the world of men, and  wished to make love like an ordinary person. Certainly Alice was an angel, and  might not be satisfied with ordinary love-making, but she also was human, and  appreciated the domesticity of life. Montrose remembered reading in some book  Eberstein had lent him: &ldquo;For every step you take in other planes, take two on  the plane you know, since you are here to learn the lessons of this plane!&rdquo;  Thus the young man abandoned for the moment his search after super-physical  knowledge and gave himself up to the joy of being an ordinary mortal. And in  one way or another he hoped to elevate a commonplace wooing to a romantic  passion, but all strictly within the limitations of the physical brain. When  the gods descended from Olympus to follow after nymphs, they came as mere men.  In a like way did Montrose set about his courting of Alice as the one woman in  the world for him.</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Barrast quite approved of the romance. For a time she had been rather annoyed  that so handsome and rich a young man had not laid himself at her feet. But  being really good-natured, if extraordinarily vain, the little woman had ceased  to play the part of dog in the manger, and forwarded the aim of Montrose by  every means in her power. At heart she was a great match-maker like most women,  and the fact that Montrose possessed Lady Staunton&rsquo;s wealth made her zealous to  bring about the marriage. She looked upon herself as quite a dea ex machin&acirc;, and, certain  that all would turn out as she wished, had already arranged how the bridesmaids  should be dressed, what people ought to be asked to the wedding, what present  she would give, and where the young couple should spend their honeymoon. There  was no doubt that Mrs. Barrast, like many another frivolous person, was a great  hand at counting her chickens before they were hatched.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  the dinky little things will come out of the eggs all right,&rdquo; she said to Alice,  a week after that young lady had made the acquaintance of Montrose. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a  nice boy and any one can see he&rsquo;s head over heels in love with you, my dear.  But I wish you would dress in colours, Alice. It looks so silly for an engaged  girl to go about in black.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not engaged yet,&rdquo; replied Miss Enistor doubtfully, &ldquo;and I never may be, Amy.  My father has to be consulted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barrast impressively, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll jump at the chance of getting the  money back into the family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is Don Pablo, who wants to marry me,&rdquo; ventured Alice anxiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  there&rsquo;s Julian also,&rdquo; retorted the little woman. &ldquo;What of that? Why, I had  dozens of offers before I met Frederick, though why I took him I really don&rsquo;t  know. Of course, as you told me this Don What&rsquo;s-his-name is rich and if  Douglas&mdash;you don&rsquo;t mind my calling him Douglas, do you, dear?&mdash;was poor, I  shouldn&rsquo;t advise you to throw the old thing over. But youth and good looks and  money and all those nice things are better than an old man. And I am glad after  all that you did not accept Julian,&rdquo; ended Mrs. Barrast candidly. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t  rich either, and life&rsquo;s horrid without money. Besides, I wish Julian to marry a  rich girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  he loves her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pooh,  what has love to do with marriage? What old-fashioned ideas you have, Alice. I  suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t marry Douglas if you didn&rsquo;t love him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly  not,&rdquo; said the girl firmly.</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Barrast made a grimace. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky you like him then, my dear. Of course it&rsquo;s  not right to marry for money only,&rdquo; added the butterfly, contradicting herself  boldly, &ldquo;but when you meet a man with a banking account try and love him as  hard as ever you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  love Douglas for himself alone. If he was a pauper I should love him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  daresay you would. I&rsquo;m sure there is madness in your family. It&rsquo;s a mercy  Douglas is well off. Five thousand a year is very nice. Be sure you make him  take a house near ours, dear, and get a smart motor-car with one of those nice  chauffeurs who look like engineers but aren&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re lots cleaner than  engineers, aren&rsquo;t they? And do wear a blue dress, dear: blue suits you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  no! I am still in mourning for my aunt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure you needn&rsquo;t be. I wouldn&rsquo;t mourn for a horrid, lean, old thing&mdash;she was  lean, you know&mdash;who didn&rsquo;t leave me a penny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  left my father one thousand pounds, Amy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just  enough to make him hate her. I&rsquo;m sure I would if I&rsquo;d been treated in that nasty  way. And do make Douglas take you out more. I&rsquo;ll come too as your chaperon,  though perhaps I&rsquo;m too young for the part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  go out quite enough, Amy. With my aunt in her grave&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t talk about graves,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Barrast, rising in a hurry, &ldquo;you set my  nerves on edge, if nerves ever do have an edge, which I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know if  they have. Not that it matters of course. Has Douglas proposed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  But we understand one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barrast in despair, &ldquo;what is the use of that? I like  everything to be signed, sealed, and delivered&mdash;I come of a legal family, you  know, dear&mdash;to make certain. Don&rsquo;t lose your salmon after you&rsquo;ve hooked him. Men  do wriggle, you know, and if he sees another girl, he will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interrupted Alice, with very red cheeks. &ldquo;How can you talk so? I am the  only girl Douglas has ever loved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  he told you the usual lie then,&rdquo; sniggered the little woman provokingly. &ldquo;How  can men be so silly as to think we believe them! I wish you&rsquo;d ask him to make  love here, Alice, as I&rsquo;d like to hear how he goes about it. It&rsquo;s absurd meeting  in Kensington Gardens as you do. It isn&rsquo;t respectable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  I am not going to be respectable this afternoon,&rdquo; said Alice, escaping from  this wasp, &ldquo;for we meet there in two hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Make  him give you an engagement ring,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Barrast, who always insisted upon  having the last word, &ldquo;diamonds, you know, dear. If the engagement is broken  you won&rsquo;t want to keep the ring and can always get market value for the stones.  I feel it is only right that you should have some of that money. Remember what  I say, darling: remember what I say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice,  on her way to her own room, did not hear the end of this speech, although it  was screamed out after her. She was rather offended that Mrs. Barrast should  advise Montrose&rsquo;s capture like an unwilling fish, as if any marriage could  possibly be happy with a reluctant bridegroom. But when putting on her hat, the  girl laughed at her reflection in the mirror, and excused the little woman&rsquo;s  well-meant speech. Amy really did mean well, although she had a rather brutal  way of putting things. Miss Enistor wondered if Frederick had been bargained  for in this mercantile way, and thought it was very probable. Mrs. Barrast was  exceedingly modern, and modern women are very businesslike in dealing with what  was formerly called romance. The Barrast marriage was a kind of mutual aid  society. Frederick had secured a pretty woman to do the honours of his house,  and Amy had captured a rich husband who supplied her with plenty of money and  let her go her own frivolous way. Alice decided that the shrewd butterfly had  made the best bargain, and was taking full advantage of her cleverness. Then  she put Mrs. Barrast out of her head and started for the place of meeting in  Kensington Gardens.</p>
  <p align="left">It  was a warm afternoon, but not too dazzling, as a thin veil of clouds was drawn  across the sky. Alice alighted from her taxi at the park gates and leisurely  walked up the broad path towards the Round Pond. She preferred to meet Douglas  here rather than in the Hans Crescent house, because Mrs. Barrast would always  have been interrupting. And the girl was sufficiently in love to think that two  was company and three a nuisance. As a matter of fact, she acknowledged to  herself she was as deeply in love with Montrose as he obviously was with her,  though neither of them had put the feeling into words. On this occasion,  however, Alice decided that it would be just as well to come to some sort of  understanding, since it was probable that she would not remain much longer in  town. At least she fancied so, for her father had been grumbling about the  money she was spending. Of course she had only known Douglas for seven days,  and it was rather early to fall in love with him. But she felt convinced that  in previous lives she had loved the young man, and that the present wooing was  only the continuation of one interrupted in the distant past. What had  interrupted it she could not say, but this time she was determined to bring it  to a head, and learn for certain if Douglas felt towards her as she felt  towards him. If glances and attentions went for anything, he assuredly did, but  modesty or nervousness apparently prevented his plain speaking. Expecting at  any minute to be summoned back to the gloom of Tremore, Alice felt that she  could not go away without knowing what Montrose&rsquo;s feelings were. And if he  really did love her to the extent of making her his wife, she gratefully  recognised that she would have some one beside her to resist the pressure put  upon her by Don Pablo and her father.</p>
  <p align="left">On  arriving at the tree under which she usually met her lover, she was surprised  not to find him waiting for her. His absence piqued her, especially as she was  late, for he certainly should have been watching for her arrival with his heart  in his eyes. With a pout she sat down on one of the two green chairs and stared  unseeingly at the many children playing about the grass and sailing toy ships  on the Round Pond. What would her father say if he knew that she was meeting  Montrose, and now loved him to the extent of thwarting Enistor&rsquo;s darling  project of uniting her to Narvaez. Poor ignorant girl! She little knew that Don  Pablo by his black arts was keeping Enistor advised of all that was taking  place, and that the two men were calmly watching her innocent luring of the fly  into the web. Eberstein could have warned her of this infernal espionage, but  he was absent, and neither Alice nor her lover had any knowledge how to guard  themselves. They were even ignorant that protection was necessary, and it was  only when the worst was at an end that they learned how the guardianship of the  master had been withdrawn for the time being. The children had to learn to walk  alone in their own strength and by their own will. Therefore, in the Garden of  Eden represented by Kensington Gardens, did they lie open to the assault of the  Serpent in the person of Don Pablo. But their ignorance and innocence and  natural leanings towards the good baffled the black magic of the evil creature  for the moment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  penny for your thoughts,&rdquo; said Montrose suddenly, and Alice raised her eyes to  find that he had slipped silently into the chair placed a trifle behind that on  which she was seated.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They  are only worth a halfpenny,&rdquo; she retorted rebukingly. &ldquo;I was thinking how  little you must care for my company when you are so late!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have been hiding behind yonder tree ever since you arrived,&rdquo; explained Montrose,  laughing, &ldquo;and for quite an hour I have been waiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  laughed also. The boyishness of his action appealed to her. &ldquo;But we are too old  to play at Peep Boo like babies,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head with a would-be  attempt at primness which was quite a failure.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  are not old,&rdquo; denied Montrose, placing his chair in line with hers. &ldquo;We are  young: we shall always be young, for the gods love us. As to babies, look into  my eyes and you will see yourself as a baby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But  Alice would not look, and the colour came to her cheeks. &ldquo;There was a girl at  school who talked of babies in the eyes. It was amusing to hear her talk, but  rather silly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  silly things are the serious things of life at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  do you explain that epigram, Mr. Montrose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  epigrams require explanations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This  one does, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  no, it doesn&rsquo;t. You must guess that the explanation lies in the words I used. &lsquo;At  this moment,&rsquo; I said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  this moment rather than others, Mr. Montrose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  young man drew back rather disappointed. &ldquo;No. I see you don&rsquo;t understand, Miss  Enistor, or you would not call me Mr. Montrose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  call me Miss Enistor!&rdquo; replied Alice, wilfully dense.</p>
  <p align="left">For  the sake of beating her with her own weapons, he answered in kind. &ldquo;Naturally I  do. I am a very polite person. But I daresay, in other lives, in other climes,  and when we were clothed in other bodies, I called you Chloe, or Octavia, or  Isabeau, or Edith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Greek,  Roman, French, and Anglo-Saxon,&rdquo; commented Alice, amused; &ldquo;you seem to have  settled the countries we lived in. I suppose I called you Damon, or Marcus, or  Jehan, or Harold&mdash;that is, supposing we were together in those days in those  places.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  have always been together,&rdquo; said Douglas decisively. &ldquo;I am quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have  you any proof?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only  the proof of my own feelings. I am not clairvoyant to the extent of remembering  my former incarnations, nor can I&mdash;as some can&mdash;consciously leave my physical  body at will and return to it with a recollection of what I have seen. Now you  are more advanced.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed,  I am not. I have learned much from my father, who knows a great deal about such  psychic matters. But I have never been properly instructed and my knowledge is  very limited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  you believe in the doctrine of reincarnation?&rdquo; urged Montrose eagerly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course. It is a most sensible doctrine to believe, and explains nearly  everything in a common-sense way. But I cannot prove my belief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no need to prove it to me,&rdquo; said Montrose, thinking of his vision, &ldquo;for I  know beyond all question that we have lived and loved before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  assented the girl dreamily, &ldquo;I knew you the moment you entered Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s  drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  young man glanced round, and, seeing that they were more or less sheltered from  observation, gently took her hand. She did not remove it, although her whole  body thrilled to the touch. &ldquo;You knew me as what?&rdquo; asked Montrose.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say more than that I knew you as a familiar friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  cold a word,&rdquo; pleaded the other softly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  other word can I use to you when we have only known each other for a single  week?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is in this life. In other existences we knew each other for years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  looked down timidly. &ldquo;It&mdash;is&mdash;probable,&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  why not take up the new life at the point where the old one left off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t know how it left off, Mr. Montrose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  But assuredly it did at a point where you called me by my then Christian  name&mdash;Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Her  heart fluttered as he spoke thus intimately. &ldquo;Perhaps we were not Christians,&rdquo;  she said, rather embarrassed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  he dropped her hand, &ldquo;you are fencing. I merely spoke in the style of to-day to  illustrate my point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now  you are angry!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  never could be angry with you; only you will not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps  I do,&rdquo; said Alice, with a whimsical smile.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  so, why aren&rsquo;t you plain with me?&rdquo; said Montrose, ruffled.</p>
  <p align="left">The  mothering instinct, which makes every woman see in every man a child to be  soothed and petted, rose within her. &ldquo;Let us slap the bad, naughty table that  has hurt baby,&rdquo; she said demurely, and Montrose looked up to see the laughter  in her eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  little witch!&rdquo; He caught her hand again and this time so roughly that she  winced at the delicious pain. &ldquo;You know quite well what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  do&mdash;Douglas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  He leaned towards her so violently that she swung aside in alarm.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  eyes of Europe are on us,&rdquo; she said hastily, indicating the throng of children  and nursemaids and grown-up people round the pond and on the paths and lying on  the grass.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bother  the eyes of Europe.&rdquo; But he saw that she was right and he did not dare proclaim  his love by taking her in his arms. It was rather a poor thing to content  himself with squeezing her hand. But he did, and so hard that she uttered an  exclamation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Montrose, you are hurting me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Am  I? Poor hand! I wish I could kiss it!&rdquo; with a swift look round, he managed to  do so. &ldquo;There&mdash;Alice. Don&rsquo;t you dare to call me anything but Douglas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  believe you wish to take me by storm,&rdquo; she pouted, not ill-pleased.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What!  capture my own city?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your  own city? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  mean that I dwell in your heart. That city is mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  conceited you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed,  I am not. You know quite well that I am only speaking the truth. I loved you in  the past and I love you now. All preliminaries of love were gone through ages  ago. Why fence, as if we now meet for the first time? When I saw you in Mrs.  Barrast&rsquo;s drawing-room I said, &lsquo;She is mine!&rsquo; When you saw me you said, &lsquo;I am  his&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interrupted Alice hastily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  thought it, though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shan&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no need for you to do so. Oh, my dear,&rdquo; he went on entreatingly, &ldquo;is there  so much love in the world that you and I can afford to throw what we possess  away? All my life I have been lonely: all my life I have wanted to meet you, to  adore you, to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  could you when you didn&rsquo;t know that I existed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Fencing  again. As if you didn&rsquo;t know that spirit is everything and form is nothing. We  have been apart on earth until last week; but we have always been together in  higher worlds, although neither you nor I can remember our companionship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  laughed in a rather anxious manner. &ldquo;Any one listening to us would be certain  both of us were insane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  daresay. But as no one is listening, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. For the convenience of  a world that doesn&rsquo;t understand such things, let us behave in a conventional  manner. I shall visit at Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s and court you in the approved style. In  due time I shall write and ask your father if I may make you my wife. Meanwhile  I want your assurance that you love me and have always loved me in the past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  a single week&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Time  doesn&rsquo;t matter. You know it doesn&rsquo;t. You love me, Alice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  She saw that the time for fencing was ended. &ldquo;I love you, Douglas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He  kissed her hand again, then, aware that the place was too public for him to  take her in his arms, suppressed his feelings. Side by side they sat in a stiff  kind of way, while each longed for demonstrations which the situation forbade.  It was decidedly uncomfortable to be thus conventional. But it was just as well  that they thus came to an understanding in the eye of the sun, as the  self-control was quite an education.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One  would think we were a couple of old married people, sitting side by side in  this stiff manner,&rdquo; said Montrose with a vexed laugh. &ldquo;I should like to be a  Sabine and carry you away by force.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps  you will have to do so,&rdquo; said Alice, thinking of Don Pablo. &ldquo;My father will  never consent to my becoming your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  looked amazed and anxious. &ldquo;Why not? There is nothing against my character and  position,&rdquo; he said rapidly, &ldquo;and as I have inherited Lady Staunton&rsquo;s money,  your father will be glad that I should bring it into the Enistor family again  by making you my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think my father cares anything about the money,&rdquo; said Alice, ignorant of  her parent&rsquo;s true feelings. &ldquo;He wants me to marry Don Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  Spaniard. Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  Spaniard, as you have said. He is my father&rsquo;s greatest friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Young  and handsome and wealthy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wealthy,  certainly. But very ugly, just like a mummy, and as old as the hills&mdash;older, I  believe. He must be eighty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  why does your father wish you to marry him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because  Don Pablo is rich.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  I am rich also. Five thousand a year is riches.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don  Pablo has more, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care what he has. He hasn&rsquo;t got you for a wife and he never will have.  You will marry me and no one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  I promise you that, Douglas. But there will be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;  Montrose laughed joyously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d face a universe of trouble if you were the  prize to be obtained by enduring it. Besides, Eberstein says that we belong to  one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  does he know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  knows many things that are strange and true. When he comes back he will  explain. He promised to do so. Meantime, all we have to do is to be true to one  another. We are engaged. Say we are engaged, Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  We are engaged. I shall marry no one but you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hurrah!  Then we shall be happy for ever and ever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo;  said the girl thankfully. &ldquo;All the same, I fear Don Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  tucked her arm within his own. &ldquo;We are together,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Unity is strength.  You understand, dear!&rdquo; And Alice did understand, smiling happily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is the birthday of the soul,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;of your soul and mine, which are one.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_IX"><b>Chapter IX</b></a><b><br>
    The Warning</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Mindful  that a premature engagement might lead to gossip, Montrose and his beloved  acted with great discretion. They gave vent to their ardent feelings in  private, and behaved prudently in public. Certainly the young man paid many  visits to Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s house, and was markedly attentive to her visitor. But  it was natural that a bachelor should admire a pretty maid, so people merely  remarked indulgently that evidently Montrose was falling in love with Miss  Enistor. They little knew that the inevitable had already happened, and in a  scandalously short space of time. Mrs. Barrast, with a shrewdness which did her  credit, guessed that the couple understood one another better than they would  admit; but even she did not guess how far matters had gone. She would have been  annoyed had she really known the truth, not because of the private engagement,  but for the simple reason that she had not been admitted into the confidence of  the lovers. As it was, all she saw led her to believe that Montrose was  conventionally approaching her guest with a view to marriage, and quite  approved of his intentions. Therefore she welcomed him to the house, and made  use of him and his money. It was only right, she thought, that he should pay  for her kindness in forwarding his aims.</p>
  <p align="left">And  the payment took the form of Mrs. Barrast plundering Montrose on all and every  occasion. Frederick supplied her with ample funds for her frivolity, but Mrs.  Barrast always wanted more than she could reasonably obtain, and cleverly got  what she desired from Douglas. As both lovers were in deep mourning for Lady  Staunton, the aunt of one and the benefactress of the other, they did not take  much part in the gaieties of the waning season. All the same, Mrs. Barrast made  Montrose give her concert tickets and boxes at theatres, which she used freely  for herself and her friends. And as on these occasions she usually left Alice  to entertain the donor in the Hans Crescent house, the young man was quite  willing to be lavish in this direction. Indeed, he was in others also, for he  supplied the butterfly with flowers and scent and gloves and similar trifles,  which every woman likes to have and which no woman likes to pay for. Alice did  not object at the outset to this generosity, as it was necessary to keep Mrs.  Barrast in a good temper; but in the end she protested against such wholesale  robbery.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  will ruin Mr. Montrose if you take everything he gives you,&rdquo; she said to Amy,  two weeks after that momentous agreement in Kensington Gardens.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  nonsense!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Barrast airily. &ldquo;The man has got more money than he  knows what to do with. It&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s duty to be agreeable. But of course, dear,  if you are jealous&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&mdash;jealous?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Barrast shrugged her elegant shoulders. &ldquo;Well, my dear, it looks like it, you  know. You needn&rsquo;t be if you are, I&rsquo;m sure, for I can&rsquo;t marry him, and I have no  intention of running away with the dear thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  wouldn&rsquo;t run away with you if you wanted to,&rdquo; said Alice crossly, and could  have bitten out her tongue for the speech.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Really!&rdquo;  Mrs. Barrast tittered significantly. &ldquo;Has it gone as far as that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; Alice grew red.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear! You are a woman talking to a woman, so there is no need for you to try  and deceive me. You want to marry this charming young fellow!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t admit that, Amy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whether  you admit it or deny it, what I state is the case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have no right to say so. I like Mr. Montrose. I admire him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Words!  Words! Words! You love him. Look at yourself in the glass, my dear. I think  your colour tells the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  if it does?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah!  Then you admit that I am right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  saw that it was useless to fence with Mrs. Barrast, who was much too clever to  be deceived and far too dangerous to be tampered with. &ldquo;Yes! I am in love  with&mdash;Mr. Montrose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  not say with Douglas?&rdquo; tittered the little woman.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Douglas,  if it pleases you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear, the question is if it pleases you and&mdash;him. Am I blind?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Barrast  dramatically. &ldquo;Am I a fool? Do you think that during the past three weeks I  have left you and that nice boy together without guessing the truth ages and  ages ago? I never ask for tickets. He gives them to me to get me out of the  way, which&rdquo;&mdash;ended the butterfly justly&mdash;&ldquo;is not complimentary to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mind Mr.&mdash;well then, Douglas, giving you boxes at the theatres,&rdquo; said  Alice petulantly; &ldquo;but why take flowers and gloves and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because  I want such things,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Barrast coolly. &ldquo;If you are foolish enough  not to take presents from him, I don&rsquo;t see why I should not. But I am glad that  we have come to an understanding, dear, as I wish to know if you are in  earnest, or if you are merely flirting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  if I am flirting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  I think it&rsquo;s very horrid of you. He has a heart and hearts can be broken. I don&rsquo;t  flirt myself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Barrast, uttering the lie with the greatest composure,  &ldquo;but if you are making a fool of that nice boy I shall take him off your hands  and be a&mdash;a&mdash;well, a mother to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  laughed outright. &ldquo;You are much too young and pretty to be a mother to any one,  Amy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right. Taunt me because I haven&rsquo;t any children. Frederick is always  complaining, as if it was my fault, which I&rsquo;m sure it isn&rsquo;t. But as to this  flirting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t flirting. Douglas and I understand one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Really.  How sly you are! Has he said anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All  that I wished him to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  he has proposed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  Alice contented herself with the affirmative and did not trouble to give the  date of the proposal. Mrs. Barrast understood that it had taken place within  the last day or so, and even that displeased her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  quite immoral for him to be so hasty,&rdquo; she exclaimed, because the idea of  Montrose adoring Alice and not herself was annoying and hurt her vanity.</p>
  <p align="left">The  girl smiled, wondering what her hostess would say if she knew that the proposal  had been made three weeks previously. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in love, you see!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is sense in all things, my dear. He has only known you a month.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course! But love at first sight&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe in such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Amy, what about Romeo and Juliet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They  are only things in a play. I don&rsquo;t think Juliet was at all respectable, and if  she had lived in London instead of Verona, I should never have allowed her to  visit me. Mr. Montrose should have behaved himself properly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  do you call proper behaviour on his part?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  he should have spoken to me first!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Douglas&rsquo;s  idea of propriety differs from yours, Amy. He thought it was best to tell my  father that he wished to marry me, before speaking to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  could do no less,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Barrast, still ruffled. &ldquo;Has he written to Mr.  Enistor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  Two days ago; but he has not yet received an answer. Nor have I, for I wrote to  my father at the same time, asking him to consent to our engagement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  he&rsquo;ll consent quick enough&mdash;your father, that is,&rdquo; sniffed the little woman. &ldquo;He  owes me a great deal for bringing back that lost money to the family. If he is  nice&mdash;I suppose he is  nice, though Julian doesn&rsquo;t like him at all&mdash;I expect he&rsquo;ll give me a bracelet,  or a muff-chain, or a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you really mean that?&rdquo; interrupted Alice, opening her eyes very wide.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course! Why shouldn&rsquo;t I mean what I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  rapacious you are, Amy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  a nasty word when I&rsquo;m only sensible. What is the use of men if they don&rsquo;t give  us things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Douglas  will give you all you want, dear. After all, you brought us together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This  diplomatic remark cleared the air and banished the frown from Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s  small-featured face. &ldquo;Of course I did. I saw that you two were meant for each  other the moment you set eyes on one another. I advised you to get back your  aunt&rsquo;s money by marriage, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  certainly did,&rdquo; admitted Miss Enistor dryly, not thinking it necessary to  explain that she loved Montrose for himself alone. &ldquo;What you said has come  true, Amy. Douglas desires to make me his wife, if my father consents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  bother your father,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Barrast vigorously. &ldquo;What does his consent  matter when you have hooked a rich man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be vulgar, Amy!&rdquo; said Alice, wincing.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  don&rsquo;t be romantic. You can&rsquo;t deceive me. Mr. Montrose is rich.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  would marry him without a sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  you will,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Barrast caustically. &ldquo;He has the sixpence, remember. I  am glad, dear: you have played your cards well. Frederick will be pleased. He  likes Mr. Montrose immensely, and you a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am glad he does,&rdquo; said Alice soberly, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t say anything until we hear  from my father, Amy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It  was with some difficulty that Miss Enistor induced the little woman to be  silent, for Mrs. Barrast was so immensely pleased with what she took to be her  own cleverness in bringing the matter to a favourable issue that she wanted to  trumpet the news all over the place. There was no word now of impropriety or  hasty wooing, for Alice let the butterfly think that the match was quite of her  own making, and the butterfly spread sheltering wings over the happy pair. She  did not tell Frederick, and as Frederick was wholly occupied with politics he  did not see what was going on under his very nose. But with many mysterious  becks and smiles and significant looks, the little woman managed to intimate  that she was the fairy godmother of these particular lovers, whose romance was  rapidly progressing towards fulfilment. Thus she made everything safe in a  respectable way for Montrose to be constantly invited to dinner, and to be left  alone with Alice more frequently than would have met with public approval had  he not been courting. The young man&rsquo;s gratitude showed itself substantially and  took the form of several pieces of jewellery, which the guardian angel was  pleased to accept. Everything went as merry as a marriage bell, pending the  reply of Enistor to Montrose&rsquo;s letter. That came four days after Alice had  remonstrated with Mrs. Barrast for her shameless looting.</p>
  <p align="left">Mr.  Enistor had written not only to Montrose but to his daughter with regard to the  proposal, and when the two came together on this particular evening, they let  one another know immediately that the fatal missives had been received. Luckily  Mrs. Barrast, with a merry party, had gone to the Empire Music Hall and would  not return until late. Montrose, as usual, had provided the box, purposely  having done so to rid himself of an inconvenient third. Frederick was at the  House, so he could not interfere, and Douglas had Alice all to himself in the  large drawing-room. Mrs. Barrast, for the sake of propriety, had made him promise  to await her return and have supper. Therefore everything was nicely arranged,  and when quite alone, the lovers sat together on the sofa and looked into one  another&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  said Alice breathlessly, &ldquo;the letters!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  just yet,&rdquo; replied Montrose, taking her in his arms, &ldquo;remember I have not seen  you for forty-eight hours!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  you foolish boy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  had some excuse for calling him so, although she liked the foolishness he  displayed immensely. He dropped on his knees, holding her waist in his arms,  and said all manner of delightful things, only interrupting his speeches to  kiss her again and again and again. What he babbled need not be reported, as  the talk of lovers, however pleasing to themselves, is extraordinarily silly  when repeated to others. But the splendid glamour of love was over this pair,  and what Douglas said sounded sublimely sensible to the girl, while the looks  of Alice were those of a goddess to her adorer. Yet Montrose was a common-sense  young man, and Miss Enistor only a tolerably pretty girl. The misleading  passion of love excused each regarding the other as a divinity. They certainly  did so and were as foolishly happy as Antony and Cleopatra were in their day of  power. And like those famous lovers they would have regarded the world as well  lost for love.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  really!&rdquo; cried Alice at last, recovering her reason first, which was natural  since she was a woman, &ldquo;we must be sensible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think we are very sensible indeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Other  people would not think so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  trouble about other people?&rdquo; replied Montrose, reluctantly getting on his feet.  &ldquo;There are no other people. You and I are alone in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed,  I think we shall be unless my father consents,&rdquo; sighed Miss Enistor. &ldquo;Not that  there will be any loneliness with you beside me,&rdquo; she added.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo;  Then another kiss and embrace before settling down to more prosaic  conversation. &ldquo;Tell me, dear, what does he say to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Much  the same as he writes to you, Douglas, I expect.&rdquo; Alice took the letter from  her pocket. &ldquo;He is not angry as I expected he would be, and says nothing about  Don Pablo. All he desires&mdash;so he says&mdash;is my happiness, and if he approves of you  he is quite willing that we should marry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  he approves of me,&rdquo; echoed Montrose, reading the paternal letter over Alice&rsquo;s  shoulder, &ldquo;quite so. But suppose he doesn&rsquo;t approve?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  try to cross the bridge until you come to it, Douglas. Why shouldn&rsquo;t my father  approve, now that he evidently has given up his idea of my marrying Don Pablo?  Has my father asked you down to Tremore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  said Montrose, producing his letter in turn, &ldquo;how clever of you to guess that,  dearest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  did not guess it, as you might have seen if you read my father&rsquo;s letter  properly,&rdquo; said Alice quickly. &ldquo;He says that he has asked you down, or intends  to ask you down. I don&rsquo;t know which.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  here is the invitation,&rdquo; remarked the young man, waving his letter. &ldquo;Mr.  Enistor says that before he can consent to place your future in my hands he  must become well acquainted with me. He invites me to Tremore for a visit of  one month. In four weeks he hopes to give his decision.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  disconsolately replaced her epistle in her pocket and watched her lover put  away his communication. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound very promising.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  but I think it does,&rdquo; said Montrose hopefully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what else he could  say if he entertains at all the idea of my marrying you. It is only natural  that he should wish to know what kind of a husband I am likely to be to his  adored daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  said Alice ironically, &ldquo;does my father call me that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Twice  he calls you that in his letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  doesn&rsquo;t mean it,&rdquo; the girl assured Montrose in a troubled way; &ldquo;my father and I  endure one another&rsquo;s society, but little love exists between us. The fault isn&rsquo;t  mine, Douglas, as I was willing enough to love him when I came from school. But  father has always kept me at arm&rsquo;s length, and hitherto my life has been  loveless&mdash;save for Julian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Julian!&rdquo;  There was a jealous note in the young man&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;That is the name of Mrs.  Barrast&rsquo;s brother, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  I call him Julian and he calls me Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Confound  his impudence!&rdquo; fumed Montrose angrily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No  impudence at all, Douglas. Julian is my very good friend: nothing more, I  assure you. But if I had not met you, and if my father had insisted upon my  becoming Don Pablo&rsquo;s wife, I should have married Julian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Alice,&rdquo; in a tone of deep reproach, &ldquo;do you love him and not me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  I respect him. If I loved him you would not now be sitting beside me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Still  Montrose was not satisfied. &ldquo;Is he good-looking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very;  in a large stolid Anglo-Saxon way. He&rsquo;s an artist, but I don&rsquo;t think one would  call him clever except as a painter of pictures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  see that you don&rsquo;t love him,&rdquo; said Douglas, his brow clearing; &ldquo;but does  Hardwick&mdash;that is his name, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;love you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  rejoined Alice promptly, &ldquo;he thought that he did, but he really does not in the  way a woman wants to be loved. He proposed and I rejected him on those grounds.  Now he understands that I am right, and we have settled to be great friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All  the same you said you would have married him if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  my father had insisted on my becoming the wife of Don Pablo,&rdquo; interrupted Alice  swiftly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand, Douglas? I detest this Spaniard, who is such a  friend of my father, and of two evils I was prepared to choose the lesser. I  did not want to marry Julian any more than I wanted to marry Don Pablo. But  Julian is at least human, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  Don Pablo human?&rdquo; asked Montrose, interrupting in his turn.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe he is,&rdquo; said Alice thoughtfully, &ldquo;there is something dreadfully  wicked about him. I can&rsquo;t explain, but when you meet him you will in some way  guess my meaning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Humph!  I shall certainly accept your father&rsquo;s invitation both to see this Spaniard and  Hardwick also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  you understand my position?&rdquo; urged Alice anxiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  I think I do. All the same I want you to assure me positively that you love no  one else but me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no need to tell you what you already know,&rdquo; returned the girl in a calm  positive way. &ldquo;We are made for one another!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo;  he caught her in his arms, &ldquo;I know. But I hope your father will think as we do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  means well,&rdquo; said Miss Enistor with a sigh of relief, &ldquo;or he would not ask you  down to Tremore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It  was at this interesting point in their interview that the lovers were  interrupted. The footman opened the door to announce Dr. Eberstein, and when  that gentleman entered the room the servant promptly retired. Montrose came  forward with a look of amazed inquiry, which was reflected on the face of  Alice. Both the young people were astonished by the unexpected appearance of  the doctor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  thought you were still in Paris, Eberstein,&rdquo; cried Douglas, as his friend shook  hands with both.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  arrived in London to-day!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t you let me know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  was no need to. It was necessary that you should quite understand one another  before I came on the scene.&rdquo; Eberstein looked from one flushed face to the  other with a smile. &ldquo;You do understand, I see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  are engaged,&rdquo; blurted out Montrose awkwardly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  that means an understanding,&rdquo; said the doctor cheerfully, with a benevolent  look in his grey eyes. &ldquo;I hope it means also mutual trust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am quite sure it does,&rdquo; cried Alice vehemently, &ldquo;nothing Douglas could say or  do would ever make me doubt him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  I would believe in Alice if all the world were against her,&rdquo; said the young man  decisively.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is good hearing,&rdquo; observed the doctor pleasantly, &ldquo;union is strength.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Every  one knows that, don&rsquo;t they, doctor?&rdquo; said Miss Enistor rather pertly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  he replied, &ldquo;but few practise it. You wonder why I have come here to-night. It  is because you both need me. All seems to be sunshine at the present moment.  You love one another devotedly: you think that Mr. Enistor is well disposed  towards your engagement&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  interrupted Alice, with a frightened look in her eyes. &ldquo;How do you know that my  father is aware of our engagement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  letters you received to-day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This  time Montrose interrupted, and there was a note of awe in his voice. &ldquo;I believe  you know everything, Eberstein.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know that you are invited down to Cornwall, so that Mr. Enistor may judge if  you are the man he would choose to be his son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  how do you know?&rdquo; said Alice, startled. &ldquo;You make me afraid!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  took her hand and gazed directly into her eyes. &ldquo;Are you sure that I make you  afraid?&rdquo; he asked gently.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why,  no!&rdquo; Alice felt the momentary fear vanish in an unaccountable way.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  you trust me even though you have known me such a short time? Remember, you  have only met me once, Miss Enistor.&rdquo; He loosened his soft, reassuring grasp  and leaned back in his chair.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  do trust you,&rdquo; said the girl promptly, &ldquo;you have been kind to Douglas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  that the sole reason?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  stared at him doubtfully. &ldquo;It is the only reason I can give. No one but a good  man and a kind friend would have saved Douglas&rsquo;s life as you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps  no, perhaps yes,&rdquo; said the doctor enigmatically, &ldquo;but I advised our friend here  to keep Lady Staunton&rsquo;s money. My interest in him may not be so philanthropic  as you imagine it to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Doctor!&rdquo;  said Montrose indignantly, &ldquo;how can you talk so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  Eberstein threw up his hand. &ldquo;I want Miss Enistor to speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  can I say but that I trust you? I am sure there is some good reason why Douglas  should keep my aunt&rsquo;s money. You would not have advised him to keep it  otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  if your father pointed out that he should have enjoyed the fortune and that I  wish Montrose to keep it so that I can make use of the money through him? What  then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Still  I must believe in you and trust you,&rdquo; persisted Alice steadily. &ldquo;My father does  not want the fortune.&rdquo; Eberstein smiled slightly. &ldquo;Oh, I assure you he does  not. He has said nothing about it. As to doubting you, doctor, he does not know  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  will some day and then he may doubt me. Remember when he does and tries to turn  you against me that I have foretold the possibility of such a warning. You say  you will trust me. Good! I accept the assurance. Montrose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  believe in you now as I always have done,&rdquo; said the young man eagerly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  understand why you are talking in this way, though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t understand many things at present,&rdquo; said Eberstein dryly; &ldquo;when you do,  pain will come with the knowledge. Necessary pain. Go to Cornwall and meet Mr.  Enistor. While the sun still shines you will not see me. But when dark clouds  obscure the light, then I shall be at your side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  will come to Cornwall?&rdquo; asked Alice quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When  the need arises.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will  it arise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  looked from one to the other quietly. &ldquo;Yes! The need will arise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  need?&rdquo; demanded Montrose, bewildered.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Enough  for the day is the evil thereof,&rdquo; said Eberstein serenely, &ldquo;and that also  applies to the good. All is well with you as yet, so enjoy the passing moment  and draw from peace the necessary strength for conflict. Gold must be refined  in the fire, and you must both be cast into the furnace. Yet be not afraid. The  same God who saved Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego will save you. You are  neither of you afraid,&rdquo; he ended positively.</p>
  <p align="left">Arm  in arm the lovers stood and they glanced at one another as the doctor spoke. &ldquo;We  are not afraid,&rdquo; they declared simultaneously, and spoke the truth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Behold  then,&rdquo; said Eberstein solemnly, &ldquo;how great is Love which can cast out fear!&rdquo;  and over them he made the holy sign.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_X"><b>Chapter X</b></a><b><br>
    In Cornwall</b></h2>
  <p align="left">It  was August when Alice returned home. As soon as her father learned that she had  become engaged to Montrose, he sent for her. Now that the mouse had entered the  trap there was no need for the girl to remain in London and spend money. Mrs.  Barrast was sorry to lose the companionship of Miss Enistor, not only because  she liked her as much as one of her shallow nature could like any one, but for  a more selfish reason. With Alice departed Montrose, and although he did not go  immediately down to Cornwall, he scarcely came near the house in Hans Crescent.  Thus Mrs. Barrast was deprived of the many presents which she loved to receive.  However, she had done very well, and made the best of her loss, since the girl&rsquo;s  visit, because of Montrose&rsquo;s love-making, had not been unprofitable to her.  Mrs. Barrast was very affectionate when Alice departed, and made her promise to  return when she became Mrs. Douglas Montrose. Alice readily consented, for  though Amy was vain and selfish, yet the fact that the love-romance had taken  place beneath her roof made the girl regard her as a most excellent friend. All  the same she was not sorry to return to Cornwall, as she was weary of the  frivolous London life.</p>
  <p align="left">In  the railway train Alice became quite depressed. She was coming back to dreary  Tremore, to her father&rsquo;s uncongenial society, and perhaps to the unpleasant  attentions of Don Pablo. But on this latter point she was reassured by her  father&rsquo;s letter. Although he had not quite consented to the marriage with  Montrose, and would not consent until he had seen the young man, yet, in the  face of his half-approval, he certainly would not allow her to be troubled by  Don Pablo. Certainly the Spaniard had great influence with the squire of  Polwellin, and might not be inclined to surrender the girl whom he desired to  make his wife. But Douglas, as Alice reflected, would soon be on the spot, and  he would deal with Narvaez, if the old man became troublesome. On the whole,  therefore, even though matters were a trifle unsettled, Alice concluded that  the new life would be better than the old. At all events she would not be quite  so lonely, and that was something. Of course Dr. Eberstein had predicted  trouble, but also he had agreed to come down when the trouble arrived. This  comforted the girl not a little, as she had the greatest confidence in Montrose&rsquo;s  friend. Why, she could scarcely say, as she knew next to nothing about him. But  his mere look, let alone the touch of his hand, was enough to make her feel  strangely brave and happy. If Don Pablo was all evil, Dr. Eberstein was all  good. Yet why one should be this and the other that, Alice could not tell.  Doubtless, as Douglas had suggested, Eberstein could have enlightened both on  this point. But he had not done so, and beyond warning them that they could  count upon his help in the trouble which was surely coming, he had said very  little. Therefore, these two young people had to walk by faith, and very  bravely did so.</p>
  <p align="left">At  Perchton, which was the nearest station to Polwellin, Alice quite expected to  find her father waiting for her, since, little as he loved her, he must surely  be anxious to see how she looked after her long absence. But Mr. Enistor was  not on the platform, and Alice with a rather forlorn feeling alighted from her  compartment. In London she had grown accustomed to love and attention, so the  neglect of the present moment brought on her depression again. But that  vanished in a trice when a strong hand took the small bag she was carrying, and  a strong voice sounded in her ears.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here  you are at last,&rdquo; said Julian brightly. &ldquo;I have been waiting for nearly an  hour, Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Julian!&rdquo; she took his hand, to press it warmly. &ldquo;I am so glad you are here. I  was feeling quite dismal because father has not come to meet me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  thought you would be. Yesterday I asked him if he intended to come to Perchton,  but as he said that he had no time I came in his stead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  left your painting. How good of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  at all. We are brother and sister, are we not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think many brothers would take so much trouble to be kind to their  sisters,&rdquo; said Alice brightly. &ldquo;Did father send the carriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  One of the horses is laid up. But a friend of mine has a motor, so I made him  lend it to take you to Tremore. Where is your baggage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I must look for it in the van and get a porter and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; interrupted Hardwick quickly, &ldquo;go and sit in the  motor; there it is. I can see to your boxes. How many?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Two  large and one small,&rdquo; said Alice, and gladly settled herself in the very  comfortable vehicle, while Julian went back into the station.</p>
  <p align="left">Shortly  he returned with a porter and the boxes were duly placed on the motor. Julian  stepped in beside the girl, and a word to the chauffeur sent the splendid  machine humming down the narrow street like a giant bee. Then the two had time  to look at one another, and Julian approved of the girl&rsquo;s appearance. Love had  made her blossom like a rose. She was less ethereal than she had been, and the  sad look on her delicate face had vanished. Also, as Mrs. Barrast had attended  to her frocks, and had introduced her to Madame Coralie, the girl was  singularly smart and attractive as regards clothes. A smile was on Julian&rsquo;s  face as he looked at her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  went away a duckling and you return a swan,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  what a doubtful compliment,&rdquo; said Alice gaily; &ldquo;am I then, or rather was I, an  ugly duckling?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  my dear, you were never an ugly duckling, but what I mean is that you have turned  from a fairy into a pretty nymph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is better,&rdquo; said Miss Enistor graciously, as the motor whizzed out of the town  and began to climb the long winding road to the moors. &ldquo;You are improving,  Julian. But you don&rsquo;t ask me how I have enjoyed myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no need. Your appearance speaks for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  laughed. &ldquo;Do you think that my looks are due simply to a short season of  pleasure in London?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  not exactly,&rdquo; rejoined Hardwick in his stolid way; &ldquo;in fact, seeing that you  have been staying with Amy, I expected you to look more fagged than you do. Amy  makes a toil of pleasure and is certainly a very wearing woman to live with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  is a dear,&rdquo; said Miss Enistor warmly, &ldquo;and has been most kind. But you are  right about her feverish pursuit of pleasure,&rdquo; she said, with an after-thought.  &ldquo;Amy never rests!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  never lets any one else rest, which is worse,&rdquo; said Julian grimly; he looked at  her sideways. &ldquo;Yes! Mere London pleasure cannot account for your happy looks.  Well, let me know who he is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let  you know who he is?&rdquo; repeated Alice, blushing and looking prettier than ever, &ldquo;do  you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think you know what I mean. You are in love at last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Like  a woman Alice did not reply directly to the remark. &ldquo;Are you very angry,  Julian?&rdquo; she asked, laying a timid hand on his arm.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear, I am not angry at all. We are brother and sister, you know. Long ago I  discovered that you were right as to my proposal and I was wrong. All that I  could do for you was to accept the situation of your future husband if Don  Pablo insisted upon marrying you. But I presume I can now resign that position,&rdquo;  ended Hardwick gravely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is called Douglas Montrose,&rdquo; said Alice, still evasive.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  very pretty name for Prince Charming. Yes, your father mentioned to me that the  young man had written to him, and he also mentioned that Montrose is the  fortunate person who has inherited Lady Staunton&rsquo;s money. So Amy got her own  way, as I knew she would. An inveterate matchmaker is Amy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  opened her eyes widely. &ldquo;Did you guess then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  so much guess as know,&rdquo; replied Hardwick composedly. &ldquo;Amy wrote about her  desire that you should become Mrs. Montrose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  was pleased, of course. Amy told me how deeply you loved the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  could not tell that for certain,&rdquo; pouted Alice doubtfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not so sure of that. Women are proverbially clever and shrewd in anything  that has to do with love-making. However, it seems she was right: your bright  eyes and crimson cheeks tell me as much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  may as well confess that I love Douglas,&rdquo; admitted Alice boldly, &ldquo;and he loves  me. Already we have asked father&rsquo;s consent to our marriage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  will give it without doubt, Alice. It is a happy way of getting back the lost  money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh  the money! the money!&rdquo; she cried petulantly; &ldquo;you talk just as Amy talks,  Julian. As if I cared for money. I love Douglas, and if he were a pauper I  would marry him. And my father has not jumped at the chance of getting back the  money, as you seem to think. He won&rsquo;t say yes and he won&rsquo;t say no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  must say something,&rdquo; remarked Julian, with a shrug.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing.  He refuses to give his decision until he knows more about Douglas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hardwick  nodded. &ldquo;That is natural and sensible. So the young man is coming to Tremore to  be put through his paces?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  clever of you to guess that. He is&mdash;in a few days. Oh, how anxious I feel,  Julian. So much depends upon my father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  will consent, I am sure, Alice. With such a disposition as you have, you could  choose no one but a really good man for your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  laughed a trifle bitterly, which was strange considering her prospects and  happy state of mind. &ldquo;Goodness or badness matter very little when one is in  love, Julian. And they do not matter at all to my father so long as I marry a  rich man. It is a good thing for me that Douglas has plenty of money, for only  in that way will things run smoothly for both of us. Otherwise I feel certain  that my father would still insist upon my marrying Don Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;  said Hardwick meditatively. &ldquo;The question is, &lsquo;Would Don Pablo marry you?&rsquo; my  dear girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is supposed to be in love with me,&rdquo; said Alice, puzzled. &ldquo;You know how he has  bothered me, Julian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I know. But there is Rose Penwin, you know, that fisherman&rsquo;s pretty  daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  turned to look at him in astonishment. &ldquo;What about her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or  Narvaez has taken an unaccountable admiration for her since you departed for  London.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Unaccountable!&rdquo;  Miss Enistor&rsquo;s lip curled. &ldquo;There is nothing unaccountable in any man admiring  a pretty girl, and Rose is more than pretty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  is,&rdquo; said Hardwick calmly. &ldquo;Pretty is not the word to apply to a beautiful and  stately woman such as Rose Penwin is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Brunhild  or Brynhild&mdash;what do you call that Norse goddess you said you so admired until  you met me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  never admired any Norse goddess,&rdquo; said Hardwick, laughing. &ldquo;I simply quoted Brynhild  as a type. Yes, Rose Penwin is of that type, but I am not in love with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don  Pablo is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  I am given to understand from village gossip. You know I chatter frequently to  the fishermen and their wives. Well, Don Pablo has been paying great attention  to Rose; giving her presents and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Does  she accept his attentions?&rdquo; interrupted Miss Enistor, astonished.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes  and no. She does in a way, as she wants to make Job Trevel jealous!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Job  Trevel,&rdquo; said Alice thoughtfully; &ldquo;to be sure! He is my foster-brother, Julian,  as I told you how Dame Trevel brought me up. But I thought it was understood  that Rose was to marry Job.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Too  thoroughly understood,&rdquo; said Julian dryly. &ldquo;It seems that Job is so certain of  Rose that he does not trouble to pay her those pretty attentions which a lover  should. Thus, to make him jealous, Rose pretends to accept the attentions of  Don Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  old mummy. He can&rsquo;t even feel love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  I agree with you there, and I am puzzled to know what his game is. Why should  an old man of eighty run after a girl of nineteen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  ran after me and bothered me enough, as you know,&rdquo; said Alice in a thoughtful  manner. &ldquo;He must be mad. Yet I do not think a madman would or could exercise  such an influence over my father. However, Job can scarcely be jealous of Se&ntilde;or  Narvaez, who might be Rose&rsquo;s great-grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is jealous, however. Don Pablo is wealthy and Rose likes pretty things, you  know. She may not love the old reprobate: she could not. All the same the  prospect of unlimited money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  nonsense!&rdquo; broke in Alice vigorously, &ldquo;she would not be so wicked. If I see  anything of her treating Job badly I shall speak to her. I am very fond of my  foster-brother even though he has a bad temper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All  the worse for Don Pablo if he has,&rdquo; said Hardwick significantly. &ldquo;Rose is  playing with fire. Love on one hand, wealth on the other: which will she  choose, do you think? I assure you, Alice, that there are the elements of a  tragedy in these things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  may be all imagination on your part,&rdquo; said the girl after a pause, &ldquo;and in any  case, if Don Pablo now admires Rose, he will leave me alone, and my father will  have no excuse to forbid my marrying Douglas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Julian  wrinkled his brow disapprovingly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a selfish way of looking at the  matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is! It is!&rdquo; acknowledged Alice with sudden compunction. &ldquo;Love does make one  selfish, Julian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet  love should have the opposite effect, my dear girl. You usually have such a  high standard that it seems strange you should fall short of it in this way.  But you have been with Amy, and although she is my own sister, even a short  time in her company does harm. She is not bad&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean that, Alice: but Amy  is excessively selfish and she seems to have contaminated you in some way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  grew scarlet, as never before had Julian dared to speak to her in this  reproving style. Yet she felt that he was right, and took no offence. &ldquo;I am  glad you have said what you have said, Julian. I should not have spoken as I  did. It was narrow and selfish, as you say. I must think of others even if love  for Douglas fills my heart. I shall see Dame Trevel and Job and in some way I  shall learn the truth. You may be sure that I shall do what I can to put  matters right between Rose and Job.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hardwick  patted her hand. &ldquo;That is spoken like the trump you are, Alice, my dear. I knew  that you were not thinking of what you were saying. As you are in love, there  is some excuse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  No! Don&rsquo;t weaken your good advice, Julian. There is no excuse for one to fall  short of one&rsquo;s standard. Your warning has done me good. You are a dear kind  boy, and if I had not met Douglas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  would have loved me,&rdquo; ended Hardwick, smiling. &ldquo;No, dear, don&rsquo;t deceive  yourself. If we had married we should have been comrades, but never man and  wife in the true spiritual sense. The marriage made in heaven is the only true  marriage. You said something of that sort when you refused me. How entirely  right you were, Alice!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  girl looked at him with a whimsical look in her eyes and wondered at his  simplicity. &ldquo;What a child you are, Julian. Nine women out of ten would take  offence at such a cool assurance that your love for me has perished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo;  returned Julian composedly, &ldquo;nine women out of ten are dogs in the manger, but  you, my dear Alice, are the tenth. I shall be glad to see Montrose. Tell me all  about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is difficult,&rdquo; said Miss Enistor absently, &ldquo;let me think for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Julian  could not see why it should be difficult for a young girl in the first  delicious phase of a perfect passion to talk to an intimate friend, such as he  truly was, of her feelings. But he did not understand what was passing in Alice&rsquo;s  mind. Her wooing was of so unusual a character, and had so much to do with  psychic matters concerning which Hardwick knew nothing, that it was hard to  explain the swift love which had drawn her and Douglas together. For one moment  she hesitated, and the next decided not to speak. Julian would not understand,  and she evaded a direct answer to his question by a truly feminine subterfuge. &ldquo;I  would rather you judged Douglas for yourself without looking at him through my  eyes. He will be here in a few days and then you can give me your opinion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Julian in his usual stolid way, &ldquo;perhaps you are right!&rdquo; after which calm  acceptance of the situation he became silent.</p>
  <p align="left">While  the two young people had been talking, the car had pursued its way towards  Tremore steadily and swiftly. Along the winding white roads it glided, with the  spreading no-man&rsquo;s-land of purple heather on either side. How Alice loved it  all; the vast moorlands sprinkled with grey blocks of granite; the tumbled  steepness of black cliffs; the far-stretching spaces of the gleaming ocean and  the life-giving winds that breathed across the limitless lands. For the moment  she wondered how she had ever endured the narrow, muffling London streets, with  their twice-breathed airs and garish lights. Like a thing of life the great car  swung untiringly along, and the landscape widened out at every turn of the  road. She felt as though she had come out of a stifling cavern into a spacious  world, and flung out her hands in ecstatic greeting to the majesty of Nature.  Reborn through love into a wider consciousness, the girl&rsquo;s seeing and hearing  now embraced an appreciation of much to which she had been formerly deaf and  blind. Sound seemed sweeter, colour more vivid and life dearer. There was a  feeling of spring in the autumnal air, and Alice felt that she wished to dance  and sing and generally rejoice out of sheer lightheartedness.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am made one with Nature,&rdquo; she exclaimed, thrilling to the beauty of land and  sea. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Shelley say something like that in &lsquo;Adonais&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  never read poetry,&rdquo; replied Julian stolidly. &ldquo;To my mind poets only say in many  words what a journalist says in few.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  a pagan sentiment,&rdquo; cried Miss Enistor gaily, &ldquo;and how untrue. Oh, there is  Tremore!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Assuredly  it was, and the grey house looked more sinister than ever in the pale sunshine.  It placed its dark spell on Alice, for as the motor-car breasted the hill, her  gay spirits left her and she became as pale as hitherto she had been rosy. With  wonderment and regret Julian saw again the wan girl who had left for London  weeks before, and anxiously inquired if she felt ill.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Alice, rousing herself with an effort from the lethargy which had fallen  on her. &ldquo;I feel quite well, but less full of vitality than when I arrived at  Perchton. It is the idea of Tremore, I think,&rdquo; she shuddered. &ldquo;You know what a  gloomy house it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Montrose  will dispel the gloom when he arrives,&rdquo; suggested Hardwick.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  brightened. &ldquo;Oh, I am sure he will. But how nice of you to say that. You are  not a bit jealous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  believe you are annoyed because I am not, my dear girl,&rdquo; laughed the artist.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Julian,  how can you say such a thing?&rdquo; she replied absently; then added in a markedly  irrelevant manner, &ldquo;I hope father will be glad to see me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mr.  Enistor may have been glad, but he certainly did not appear at the door to show  his gladness. Alice&rsquo;s boxes were taken into the house, and Julian departed in the  car, declining to enter, on the plea that father and daughter would have much  to say to one another. Alice did not seek to stay him. She felt chilled by the  absence of welcome and the sombre atmosphere of the big house. The beaten space  of ground upon which it stood seemed to isolate it from the warm laughing world  of vivid life, and she entered with the feeling that she was descending into a  vault. Nor did the greeting of her father tend to dissipate this impression of  dismay. He received her in the library with a cold kiss and without rising from  his chair.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  Alice, how are you?&rdquo; He looked at her keenly as she stood by the table, white  and frozen into silence. &ldquo;Your stay in town does not appear to have done you  much good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I feel all right,&rdquo; said the girl, with an effort to be her true self.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t look all right,&rdquo; snapped Enistor, rather disappointed. &ldquo;After all the  money you have spent you certainly should have a more healthy appearance. H&rsquo;m!  I think I understand,&rdquo; he paused a moment, then added bitingly, &ldquo;your new lover  has disappointed you. Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  Alice roused herself to offer a protest. &ldquo;Douglas is all that I can wish,  father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  hope for your sake that he is all I can wish. If he isn&rsquo;t I shall certainly not allow you  to marry him. There is always Don Pablo to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">At  this speech Alice did wake up and a colour flushed her cheeks. &ldquo;Don Pablo, if I  am to believe Julian, has fallen in love with Rose Penwin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know that Hardwick was such a gossip,&rdquo; said Enistor coolly. &ldquo;As to  falling in love, Narvaez is much too sensible a man. He admires the girl for  her beauty and has given her several presents of jewellery. At Don Pablo&rsquo;s age  no one can object to that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Job  Trevel can, and Job Trevel does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;More  gossip,&rdquo; sneered Enistor. &ldquo;Your artist friend appears to have informed himself  accurately of the situation. But it matters nothing to you or to me, since  neither of us has any right to interfere with Don Pablo&rsquo;s likes or dislikes.  You are the one he loves, Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  thought you said a moment ago that he was too sensible to fall in love!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  Squire shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I meant in the silly way of boys and girls.  Narvaez&rsquo; love is of a deeper and more spiritual kind. He admires Rose as a  beautiful girl; he adores you as a soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want his adoration!&rdquo; said Alice wearily, for it seemed hard that the  usual wrangling should begin the moment she returned home.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  prefer Montrose&rsquo;s adoration no doubt. Well, I have no objection so long as I  approve of the young man and he does what I want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  must restore the money which your aunt left him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  thought you did not care for the money, father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  care very much indeed for the money, although I have never emphasised the fact.  Only because he has it did I even consider the possibility of your marrying  him. I should much prefer you to be Narvaez&rsquo; wife. However, we shall see when  the young man arrives. Meantime you had better lie down as you seem to be worn  out by your journey. It&rsquo;s waste of money to send you away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  bit her lips to keep back her tears and breathed a prayer that Eberstein should  help her to throw off the deadly influence of the house. Even as she did so the  relief came, and she felt a wave of vitality run through her body. The weary,  languid sense of utter desolation left her; the colour returned to her cheeks,  the brightness to her eyes and the strength to her whole being. Enistor saw the  statue come to life, and in place of a wan, weak girl beheld a living,  breathing woman, very much alive. He stared amazed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  has come to you?&rdquo; he demanded, startled and puzzled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Love,&rdquo;  said Alice quietly, &ldquo;love and life instead of hate and death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  quivered, since he knew that the first mentioned forces were at war with  himself and his dark Master.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XI"><b>Chapter XI</b></a><b><br>
    The Spider And The Fly</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Alice  returned to her home with the feeling that she was entering a hostile city. The  atmosphere of the house was inimical, charged with disintegrating forces, which  strove to break up and scatter her protective power. That the power came from  Dr. Eberstein she was now perfectly certain in her own mind, as she had  experienced his help so plainly when she arrived. Before her visit to London,  Enistor had so dominated her with his cold cynicism and cruel insistence that  he had almost entirely conquered her will. She had been like a bird in the  coils of a serpent, and only absence had enabled her to regain her freedom. In  surroundings less charged with deadly evil, the girl had recovered the youthful  spirits which were her rightful heritage, and the unifying influence of  Montrose&rsquo;s love had strengthened her considerably. Therefore, when fear again  threatened to control her, she had been able to assert herself, but, on  reflection, she felt positive that the attempt would have been vain had she not  mentally appealed to Eberstein.</p>
  <p align="left">Why  she had thus called upon him for help she scarcely knew, as she was ignorant of  matters connected with the occult. All she did know was that the doctor had  always soothed her with his serene strength when she was in his presence, and  half unconsciously she had wished for him to be beside her when the insidious  evil which overshadowed Tremore had surged round her to paralyse and control.  Eberstein had not come himself, but his power had, and like an impassable wall  it had fenced her in from danger. The hint that such help was obtainable in  such a manner was enough for the girl. She persistently and particularly dwelt  upon Eberstein&rsquo;s powerful personality, and whenever uncomfortable feelings  assailed her, she swiftly imagined that he was close at hand to defend her.  Also she constantly visualised the image of her lover, knowing that he was  willing to lay down his life for her safety, and this in a lesser degree filled  her with life and strength. If Enistor on his daughter&rsquo;s return doubted that  the visit to London had done her good, he had no reason to doubt afterwards.  Alice recovered, as by magic, the brightness of her eyes and the roses of her  cheeks. She went about the dark house gaily and hopefully busy with domestic  affairs, always cheerful and merry even to the extent of singing while at work.  It might be thought that Enistor was glad to see how the girl had recovered her  spirits and had benefited by the change. But in place of showing satisfaction,  he gloomed and glowered in high displeasure.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is less chance than ever of our gaining authority over her,&rdquo; he complained to  Narvaez, when on a visit to the magician&rsquo;s cottage. &ldquo;We nearly controlled her  before she left for London, but now her resisting strength has increased  tremendously.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is not her own strength that defends her,&rdquo; replied Don Pablo quietly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  it is the strength of love awakened by Montrose. You might have known,  Master&mdash;you who have such means of obtaining knowledge&mdash;that there was that risk  when I let her go to Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not omnipotent and omniscient,&rdquo; answered the old man dryly. &ldquo;Great as is my  power, there are still many things beyond my control. I implied as much when I  told you that the present situation is the outcome of the past. You know the  Law of Karma&mdash;the Law of Cause and Effect&mdash;the Law of &lsquo;As ye sow so shall ye  reap,&rsquo; which governs the evolution of the present creation, and knowing so  much, you should not be surprised that we are mastered by it as are all beings.  Sooner or later Alice was bound to come into contact with our enemies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who  are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dr.  Eberstein and Douglas Montrose!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Alice  told me how she had met Eberstein and how much she liked him. But she gave me  no hint that he was an enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  could she, seeing she does not know,&rdquo; retorted Narvaez sharply. &ldquo;Eberstein is  the White Magician, against whom I warned you weeks ago. He is coming down here  soon, as I prophesied he would. And Montrose also comes. We were all together  in Chaldea five thousand years ago, and there engendered causes which have to  be worked out in the flesh to-day. Why do you blame me for Alice going to  London?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  has gained strength by going there and meeting these men. You should have  warned me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  warned you as much as I could,&rdquo; snapped Narvaez, acridly sharp, &ldquo;but I could  not prevent the inevitable. Alice had to meet them, and the loss of that money  under the will which left it to Montrose was the means used to bring them  together. All I could do, being impotent under the Karmic Law, was to so  arrange matters that Montrose might be brought down here along with Dr.  Eberstein. That I have managed and now comes the tug of war. You are by no  means a satisfactory pupil, Enistor, as I have again and again to explain  matters which you already know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  I take it that Eberstein has already declared war by bringing Montrose and  Alice together?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  Great Law did that. Eberstein&rsquo;s declaration of war is the help that he is  giving Alice to withstand the influence we strive to bring to bear upon her.  For the moment, as you saw, she nearly relapsed into her former condition when  she returned from her visit. But her intuition told her to call upon her  guardian Eberstein and the help came. Her innocence protected her before: now  she has the more powerful protection of love, both from Montrose in a personal  sense, and in an impersonal way from Eberstein.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  he very powerful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  grinned Narvaez with a look of hate in his cold blue eyes. &ldquo;He follows the  Right-hand Path of Love, and has the universal power behind him. You and I on  the Left-hand Path of Hate possess only a portion of that power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  that case it seems impossible to conquer,&rdquo; said Enistor irresolutely.</p>
  <p align="left">The  Satanic pride of Don Pablo rose in arms against this insinuation. &ldquo;Eberstein  will find me no mean adversary,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;I shall fight and fight to the  last. Already the fly in the person of Montrose has walked into my parlour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!  So you are the spider?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  And I shall devour Montrose if I can. Already I have made my plans and started  my work by paying attentions to that silly Rose Penwin, thus arousing the  jealousy of Trevel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never  mind what you see,&rdquo; interrupted Narvaez impatiently. &ldquo;Leave me to do what I  intend to do, and then Eberstein will not find it easy to save Montrose, in  spite of his power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  if he has more power than you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you understand?&rdquo; cried Don Pablo, exasperated. &ldquo;Montrose and Alice both have  free-will. Eberstein can guide and coax; he cannot command. If the two yield to  Self, then we triumph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  if they renounce Self?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  we fail. But be of good cheer. Neither is yet so strong as to have entirely  conquered the animal self, and that will fight in each for its existence. What  you have to do is to play the courteous host, to permit the engagement of Alice  and Montrose: then leave the rest to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This  was only one of many conversations which Enistor had with his Master, while  awaiting the arrival of his guest. He could not quite understand the situation,  and Narvaez declined to explain further than was in his opinion necessary. All  Enistor knew was that Montrose was to be trapped in some way, and that Don  Pablo&rsquo;s courting of Rose Penwin with gifts had to do with the trapping.  Contented with this knowledge, the man was markedly amiable to his daughter,  and Alice felt nervously surprised by the unusual attention which her  ordinarily indifferent father paid her. Formerly she had, with some reason,  dreaded the sinister influence emanating from him, but now seeing in his  demonstrations of affection a sign that he truly loved her, she regretted her  possible misjudgment. In many ways she attempted to show her appreciation of  the miraculous change from blame to praise, and on the whole found domestic  life at Tremore unexpectedly pleasant. Nevertheless the natures of father and  daughter clashed at odd moments, and it was only by constantly acting parts  they did not truly feel that they could keep things smooth. More than ever did  Alice long for the arrival of Montrose, so that she could display her true  nature and exercise her true love.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor&rsquo;s  unnatural complaisance extended to Hardwick, as, now that he was aware of the  artist&rsquo;s rejection, he did not forbid his visits. Julian guessed that the  Squire merely tolerated him, and simply came to Tremore on all and every  occasion to aid Alice, since he knew that she was something of an alien in her  home. His host was always pointedly agreeable, and so&mdash;strange to say&mdash;was Don  Pablo. The dark dour old man, for some hidden reason, appeared to take a great  interest in the artist. As he had formerly neglected him in every way, Julian  was puzzled to know why he should be thus honoured. Not liking Narvaez, he did  not reciprocate this belated amiability, and always escaped with Alice on to  the moors when it was possible. He trained her to observe the beauties of  Nature, and opened her eyes to a more glorious world of form and colour. Alice  accepted such behaviour with sisterly thankfulness, and looked upon him as a  large comfortable Newfoundland dog, able to protect and please her. Therefore  the young people found life very pleasant, and all was sunshine for the moment,  as Eberstein had predicted. That more glorious sunshine would come with her  lover&rsquo;s arrival Alice knew very well, but she never forgot that clouds would  sooner or later overshadow the summer sky, although she could not see in which  quarter they would arise. A vague feeling, however, intimated that disaster  would come with Montrose, and that her belief in his love would be severely  tested. Nevertheless, she looked forward to his arrival, knowing that Eberstein  would follow him shortly. And in the doctor she had the most implicit  confidence, assured that whatever sorrow descended upon her or her lover,  Eberstein would guard them and help them in every way. Also there was Julian  upon whom she could rely in the hour of her need. The suspense indeed was  unpleasant, but Alice fought it with prayer and high thinking, girding herself  as it were with armour of light against the time when the Dark Powers would  assault the citadel of her being. But in her innocence she was ignorant, save  from the hints of Eberstein, that an assault was intended.</p>
  <p align="left">At  length came the golden day when Douglas was to arrive, and Alice rejoiced to  receive a letter stating that the young man would leave London by the early  morning train at five o&rsquo;clock. At half-past three he would be at Perchton, and  there Julian was to meet him in his friend&rsquo;s motor-car which he had again  procured, so that Montrose might be with Alice as speedily as was possible.  Enistor, indeed, mindful of Don Pablo&rsquo;s injunction to be courteous, had offered  to send the carriage, but Alice, anxious that some swifter method should be  found to bring her lover to her longing arms, had accepted the offer of Julian.  She did not go to the Perchton station herself, but waited a mile beyond  Polwellin village in a green nook beside the high road for the happy moment.  Hardwick had purposely arranged to bring the lover to Tremore, as he was  anxious for the sake of the girl&rsquo;s happiness to see what was the nature of the  man she had chosen to be her husband, and deemed that he could discover the  same more easily when Alice was not present. Apparently his reading of Montrose&rsquo;s  character was satisfactory, for when the car came swirling round the corner,  Alice saw that the two young men were chatting together as if they had known  one another for years. Of course when Alice was espied waving her hand on the  green hill above the nook, the car was stopped on the dusty white road, and  equally of course Montrose jumped down to run like a deer up the ascent. In  another moment she was in his fond arms, and heart was beating against heart.  Neither could speak, so full of joyful emotion was the moment, and guessing  this, Julian told the chauffeur to drive on. With some astonishment the couple  saw the motor slipping round the bend of the road, through the village, and up  towards Tremore, bearing the portmanteau of Montrose. They were alone in the  purple world amongst the gorgeous coloured bracken, which was vivid with  autumnal tints. The sun was just sinking and the glory of its rainbow hues  bathed them in opal lights.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is one of the nicest fellows I ever met,&rdquo; said Montrose, when the first  surprise at Julian&rsquo;s prompt action was over. &ldquo;And he is so sensible. He knew I  wanted to be alone with you at the first opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Julian  is always considerate,&rdquo; said Alice gaily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  call him Julian&mdash;Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s brother?&rdquo; said Montrose jealously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo;  she took him by the lapels of his coat and looked into his dark eyes. &ldquo;Of  course I call him by his Christian name. I told you about Julian in London. How  he proposed to me: how I refused him, and how we are now like brother and  sister. There is no need to be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  stopped her mouth with a kiss. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say the word. I am a fool,&rdquo; he said  penitently. &ldquo;I remember what you said in Town. And Hardwick is a brick; a  really true, honest-hearted fellow. I like him immensely. And&mdash;and&mdash;oh, we have  so much to talk about, Alice, that we need not waste the time in discussing  Hardwick, even though he is so decent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  quite agreed with this sentiment, so the two started to climb the hills on  their way to Tremore, and talked all the way of near and dear matters so  necessary and interesting to lovers, and so dull when a third person overhears.  They went over their meeting in Hans Crescent, recalled what he had said and  what she had replied; explained how each had been hungry for this precious  moment of meeting and punctuated the enthralling conversation with frequent  kisses. And as the magical light died out of the western sky, they conversed on  graver subjects which had to do with some vague thought of evil coming to them  both. Montrose explained how he had seen Eberstein shortly before leaving London.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  sent for me yesterday,&rdquo; said the young man, fumbling at his breast, &ldquo;and gave  me this, which he said was necessary for my protection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your  protection,&rdquo; echoed Alice with a sudden qualm, and she stared at the small  golden heart swung on a thin golden chain, which Montrose had produced  unexpectedly. &ldquo;Why should you want protection, Douglas?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah,  that I cannot truly say. But I am so accustomed to obey the doctor implicitly  that I did as he asked me and wear this amulet round my neck. He has always a  reason for what he does, Alice. Remember, dear, he said plainly that our  sunshine would not last for ever,&rdquo; ended Montrose gravely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is to be a period of sorrow, I know,&rdquo; murmured Alice, nestling close to her  lover&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;But with Dr. Eberstein&rsquo;s help we shall come out of the darkness  into the light once more. I don&rsquo;t know what he means,&rdquo; she added after a pause.  &ldquo;Why should sorrow come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have an idea that it has something to do with our meeting in former lives,  Alice, and that we have enemies to encounter and conquer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don  Pablo very likely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think so, although I am not sure.&rdquo; Montrose spoke dreamily, remembering his  wonderful vision and the warning of Eberstein. &ldquo;We must watch and pray, dear,  for, more or less, we are moving in the darkness. This will aid us,&rdquo; and he  held up the talisman, which glittered in the sunset rays.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  how can that golden heart help?&rdquo; asked Alice disbelievingly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  only see the exterior, dear. It holds,&rdquo; Montrose made the sign of the cross on  his breast, &ldquo;a portion of the Host, as Dr. Eberstein told me, and is therefore  powerful against evil. I called it an amulet: rightly, I should have said a  reliquary. Look, dearest!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Then  a most wonderful thing happened. The two had reached the shade of the wood  surrounding Tremore, and had halted on its verge in a spot where the sunlight  could not penetrate. But as Alice stared at the golden heart it blazed as a  star with a far more brilliant light than any she had ever seen before. In a  flash of thought she knew that her interior senses had been opened by the  mightiest influence on earth. She was looking through the sheath of metal at  the very Host itself in its supernal aspect, radiant, glorious, wonderful,  holy. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed in a hushed voice and bowed her head reverently.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  is it?&rdquo; asked her lover in surprise, for her expression was angelic.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700291h-images/page170.png" width="490" height="750"></p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you not see the light that is brighter than the sun?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he whispered nervously, and seized her hand, like a child seeking for the  comfort of a mother&rsquo;s touch. &ldquo;Where is the light?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is gone now.&rdquo; Alice passed her disengaged hand across her brow. &ldquo;It disappeared  when you touched me. When you held up that heart it shone like a marvellous  star of splendour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Then  Montrose understood. &ldquo;You have seen the Power itself,&rdquo; he murmured, and with  trembling hands restored the reliquary to his breast. For the moment what Alice  had seen shook him to the core of his being. &ldquo;How glorious to be able to see  through the veil even for a single moment. But why should you not when it is said,  &lsquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Like  children they clung to one another on the borders of that dark wood, and it was  some time before they could proceed. The sacred light they felt was yet around  them, and would act as a shield against all evil. That it did so far as Alice  was concerned was certain, for while walking under the yews amidst the heavy  darkness, her sense of protection was unusually strong. Not so Montrose, for  even though he carried the reliquary, he was less sensitive to its helpful  influence than the girl who was more attuned to spirituality. It might be that  with him the preponderance of earthly desires placed him more in touch with the  lower planes than with the higher, but undoubtedly he felt strongly the tremendous  pressure of the evil around him. And when the two halted on the verge of the  beaten ground, barren of herb and flower, the house of hate bulked largely,  silent, black, brooding and menacing.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Alice,  how can you live here?&rdquo; demanded Montrose, grasping her hand tightly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  feel it also?&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that sense of doom and dread?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  feel the power that rends and tears and parts asunder: the disintegrating force  of Chaos, which is necessary for creation before Cosmos&mdash;the Cosmos of Love can  be formed!&rdquo; and unconsciously he gripped her hand with crushing force, so great  was the emotion which stirred him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Douglas,  you hurt me,&rdquo; cried the girl, writhing.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  forgive me,&rdquo; he descended to the commonplace and tenderly kissed the pained  finger. &ldquo;But the feeling of dread was so strong that I forgot what I was doing.  There,&rdquo; he kissed her hand twice, &ldquo;is it better, darling?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  laughed. &ldquo;You are a child,&rdquo; she said, advancing towards the house.</p>
  <p align="left">Her  lover sighed. &ldquo;We are all children, I think. Afraid of the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no darkness where God is, dear. Think of God and the light comes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are nearer to the Great Spirit of Love than I am,&rdquo; said Douglas, peering  nervously into the gloom. Then he made an effort to throw off the still  persistent influence of evil. &ldquo;Let us get into the lamplight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come  then,&rdquo; said Alice, and stepping into the porch, she laid her hand on the handle  of the door. Immediately, as by magic, it retreated from her fingers, and the  portal swung wide to reveal Enistor on the threshold, dimly seen in what light  still radiated from the fading sunset over the heavy tree-tops.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  heard your voices,&rdquo; he explained genially, &ldquo;and knew that our guest had  arrived. Welcome to Tremore, Mr. Montrose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank  you, sir, oh, thank you,&rdquo; replied the young man, reassured by this reception  and warmly clasping the hand extended to him.</p>
  <p align="left">As  he did so a strong feeling of repulsion possessed his mind with overwhelming  force, and it was all he could do to prevent himself from wrenching his hand  away. Not that there was any need for the action on his part, for Enistor  actually translated the thought into swift doing, and loosened his grip, to  stand back with a startled look. Without doubt the same repugnance at the same  instant of time obsessed the older man, but, less self-controlled, he had been  unable to prevent the unfriendly action. In the twilight each man strove to see  the face of the other, but it was impossible to distinguish clearly. In shadows  they met as shadows.</p>
  <p align="left">It  was Alice who broke the spell of confused hatred, as, in spite of her  clairvoyant faculty, she was apparently ignorant of the thunder in the air.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am sure you will be glad to have tea, Douglas. Is it in the library, father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  muttered Enistor, regaining his self-control by a powerful effort, and with  that one word he led the way into the lamplight. Douglas followed arm in arm  with the girl, feeling that but for her and all she meant to him he would have  escaped immediately from the grim house and its unseen owner.</p>
  <p align="left">In  the mellow radiance which flooded the library Enistor beheld a slim and  delicate man with the dreamy face of a poet. Scorning himself that such a  stripling should cause him even momentary dread, and despising him as one of  the enemies indicated by Narvaez, the Squire became good-naturedly tolerant.  During tea-time he behaved courteously, and proved himself to be a genial and  hospitable host. But Montrose was markedly silent, as his repulsion increased  immediately he caught sight of that dark and powerful countenance. Also in his  heart there lurked an uncomfortable fear that Enistor was in a position to  injure him in some inexplicable way. It was not physical fear, for Montrose was  a brave man, but a hateful influence which seemed in some way to paralyse him.  Why this should be so he was naturally unable to guess, but the desire to fly  the neighbourhood of an implacable foe was so strong that it took him all his  strength to resist the desire for an ignominious retreat. But for Alice&rsquo;s sake  he did so resist, as her gracious presence enabled him to bear the strain with  some equanimity. Therefore, as he had been trained by Eberstein to control his  feelings, he drank and ate in quite a conventional manner. Alice, still  ignorant of the hatred with which her father and her lover regarded one  another, presided over what was outwardly a merry little meal, chatting and  laughing in a smiling and whole-hearted way, as though she had not a care in  the world. As indeed she had not for the moment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  fear you will feel dull here, Mr. Montrose,&rdquo; said Enistor, formal and cold.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  father, what a compliment to me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear, we are quiet folk at Tremore, you must admit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  like quietness,&rdquo; said Montrose, smiling, &ldquo;and would much rather be here than in  London. And of course with Alice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is paradise,&rdquo; ended Enistor cynically. &ldquo;You have the usual stock-in-trade of  pretty phrases which lovers delight in. Well, we must see what we can do to  amuse you. I am usually busy myself, but Alice can be your guide to the few  sights of the neighbourhood. You can ride a horse, or a bicycle, and drive in  the carriage or dog-cart. There is a tennis-lawn at the back of the house and  golf-links in Perchton. Then you can go sketching on the moors with Mr.  Hardwick and Alice; or Job Trevel will take you out fishing. Mr. Sparrow, the  vicar of Polwellin, will show you the church and cromlechs and rocking-stones  and other such things, as he is something of an arch&aelig;ologist. We can have music  and bridge and conversation in the evenings, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stop!  Stop!&rdquo; interrupted Montrose, now more at his ease, as he saw that the Squire  was endeavouring to make himself agreeable. &ldquo;It would require six months to do  all these things. I shall enjoy myself immensely, especially if you will  introduce me to Se&ntilde;or Narvaez.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  do you know about him?&rdquo; asked Enistor sharply, and frowning.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All  that Alice and Hardwick could tell me. He seems to be a very interesting man,  and an unusual character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is original,&rdquo; assented Enistor quickly, &ldquo;so much so that he does not choose to  know every one. However, as he is my very good friend I daresay I shall be able  to induce him to meet you here. You will find him very interesting indeed,&rdquo;  ended the Squire significantly, and he stared hard at Montrose, wondering if he  guessed how the Spaniard regarded him.</p>
  <p align="left">But  the young man, having nothing to conceal, and quite innocent of Don Pablo&rsquo;s  enmity towards him, met the Squire&rsquo;s gaze with a forced friendly smile. &ldquo;I like  interesting people,&rdquo; he said amiably. &ldquo;And I hope you do also, Mr. Enistor, as  my friend Dr. Eberstein is coming to Perchton shortly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall be pleased to welcome any friend of yours,&rdquo; replied the elder man in a  formal way, and then rose to leave the room. He felt that he had done enough as  host for the time being and wished to be alone, so that he might send mental  messages to Narvaez about the new arrival. &ldquo;You will excuse me until  dinner-time, Mr. Montrose. Alice will entertain you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">When  the Squire departed Alice did her best in the way of entertainment, but found  it difficult to banish the thoughtful look from her lover&rsquo;s face. Pleading  fatigue, the young man soon sought the room assigned to him, and pondered over  the odd distaste which the sight of Enistor induced. He could not account for  it, and wished that Eberstein would appear to elucidate the problem. Across his  mind flashed insistently the question of Ahab, &ldquo;Hast thou found me, O mine  enemy?&rdquo; and the deadly answer of Elijah the seer, &ldquo;I have found thee!&rdquo; Much as he  loved Alice, he felt that the situation was uncomfortable and perplexing and  quite beyond human explanation.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XII"><b>Chapter XII</b></a><b><br>
    Small Beer Chronicles</b></h2>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  emphasis of the soul is always right!&rdquo; says Emerson, meaning thereby that the  immediate feeling which individuals have for one another at first sight is a  hint from the divine within them as to whether they should be friends or foes.  This subtle impulse is never felt again, as self-interest and custom gradually  blunt the spiritual perceptions, and those who cross each other&rsquo;s path behave  as worldly circumstances bid them. And naturally so, for whenever the desires  of the animal-self come into operation, the more latent powers of the  Higher-Self are obscured. Therefore, he is the wise man who accepts the  emphasis of the soul as guidance in the choice of friends and in the doing of  deeds. Because men, influenced by selfishness, do not follow such a lead, their  path in life becomes much more complicated than it need be. They hear the  blatant trumpeting of desire: not the still small voice of conscience.</p>
  <p align="left">Not  being particularly metaphysical, Montrose was ignorant of this safeguard, and  did not heed the warning of danger given at his first meeting with Enistor.  That schemer, better informed, accepted the knowledge that here was a foe to be  wary of. It would have been surprising had he not done so, as apart from the  hatred which sprang into lively being at the first touch of hands, Narvaez had  spoken plainly, and moreover Montrose was the detestable person who had secured  Lady Staunton&rsquo;s fortune. To regain it and allow the Spaniard to execute his  dark designs, Enistor masked his hatred under a fine show of courtesy, behaving  with such apparent sincerity that Douglas was entirely deceived. As the days  slipped by and there was no change in the gracious attitude of his host, he  grew to like him, to admire him and to enjoy his companionship. This was little  to be wondered at, as Enistor, being well-read and well-bred, could make  himself extremely agreeable when he chose to do so. For obvious reasons he did  so choose, and so did away with the mysterious repulsion of the first meeting  that it became only a dim memory to Montrose. At the end of seven days the  visitor persuaded himself without any great difficulty that Enistor was a most  excellent man, an agreeable friend, and one likely to prove an ideal  father-in-law. Alice was relieved to see that the two men got on so well  together, and more than ever decided that she had deceived herself with regard  to her father&rsquo;s true character.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have, I think, bridged the gulf between us,&rdquo; she explained one Sunday morning,  when with Montrose she was descending the hill to Polwellin church. &ldquo;Father and  I never got on well until you came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dearest,  your father&rsquo;s character takes time to realise,&rdquo; was the prompt reply. &ldquo;He looks  stern and is of a reserved nature. But when one comes to know him he has a  sweet kernel for all his rugged rind. At first I did not think we should get on  well together, but that was a mistake. He&rsquo;s a ripping fine chap, and as good as  they make &lsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you like my father for his own sake or for mine?&rdquo; asked Alice doubtfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For  both sakes,&rdquo; rejoined the young man positively. &ldquo;And seeing that I am here to  rob him of his dearest treasure, I think he is behaving wonderfully.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo;  murmured Alice, not wholly agreeing with this valuation. &ldquo;Are you so sure?  Father looks at me in a different way from what you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Naturally.  It is a different kind of love. From what you said, I quite expected to find  your father a bear and a tyrant. Instead of being either he is delightful in  every way. I don&rsquo;t think you are quite fair to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  the girl was still undecided. &ldquo;He has altered much since you came, Douglas. You  have brought the best out of him. He is more human. All the same&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped  abruptly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well  then&mdash;all the same?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  said Alice abruptly, and passed swiftly into the church, where further speaking  was out of the question, much to her relief.</p>
  <p align="left">What  she had meant to say and did not say was concerned with an uncomfortable  under-current of thought regarding her father&rsquo;s surprising attitude. Owing to  the relationship between them it was difficult to judge him impartially; yet  Alice wished to do so, if only to satisfy her own conscience. Remembering the  man&rsquo;s lifelong indifference and coldness and utter want of consideration, the  girl left that this aggressive amiability was assumed for some purpose. What  that purpose might be she could not conjecture, unless it had to do with the  recovery of the fortune which she now knew he had not lost with equanimity. But  even if the marriage with Douglas took place, it was hard to see how her father  hoped to benefit, and she knew from experience that he did not hold with  altruism. Filial sentiment made her strive to please him on the forced  assumption that in spite of appearance he really did love her. But somehow she  could not convince herself that such was the case. He was acting the  affectionate father as she was acting the affectionate daughter, yet she did  not think that he believed in her any more than she believed in him. It was all  very difficult and very disagreeable.</p>
  <p align="left">It  was useless to discuss the matter with Montrose, and for this reason she had  ended their conversation by entering the church. The young man and her father  had become excellent friends, and he would never believe that Enistor was  anything but what he presented himself to be. In fact, Douglas had told her  very plainly that she had misjudged her father, and her own surface-thoughts  implying that such was the case inflicted a pang. But intuition scouted the  idea of misjudgment. As one human being adjusting herself to another human  being she knew how to act, but as a child striving to understand her parent she  was quite bewildered. Finally, she decided that the only thing to be done was  to accept the situation as her father wished it to be accepted, if only for the  sake of peace and quietness. The Squire was willing to permit the marriage, and  was doing his best to be agreeable to his future son-in-law. Nothing else  mattered for the moment. Having arrived at this sensible conclusion, Alice  compelled herself to attend to the service.</p>
  <p align="left">It  was by no means an interesting one, as there was a want of warmth and colour  about it which reduced the whole to a monotonous repetition of fine phrases.  The vicar was a thoroughly good man, earnest and self-sacrificing, but with so  moral a temperament that he entirely failed to understand sinners. And not  understanding them he was unable to give them that sympathetic help which a  practical experience of temptation teaches. He would scold a wrong-doer with  great anger&mdash;box his ears so to speak&mdash;not because he was a bad-tempered man, but  for the simple reason that he could not see the sin from the wrong-doer&rsquo;s point  of view. As Mr. Sparrow said again and again, he did not want to run away with  his neighbour&rsquo;s wife; he did not desire to drink too much, or to cheat, or to  swear, so why&mdash;he asked plaintively&mdash;should his parishioners desire to do such  uninviting things? By this inborn obtuseness he missed his aim, as he  invariably attempted to bully ignorant wrong into becoming enlightened right  without necessary explanations. Naturally those he genuinely tried to help  resented a process which robbed them of their self-respect, and which gave them  no logical reason for doing other than their crude desires bade them. Therefore  while some remained members of the church, and accepted ecclesiastical  scoldings stolidly as part of the burdens of life which they were called upon  to bear because they could not help the bearing, others took refuge in the beer-shops  and rejected all authority. Also, there were a few who joined Nonconformist  sects of the democratic type, where the congregation controlled the preacher,  and turned him out if his views were unsatisfactory to their narrow  understandings. The result of these things was chaos, and Mr. Sparrow lamented  that he had to deal with such stiff-necked people. Yet had he been able to  explain reasonably what he taught, and had he possessed the tact to coax  instead of bullying, he would soon have reduced the whole parish to order.</p>
  <p align="left">As  a matter of fact in one way the vicar was better than his religion: not that  his religion was not true and helpful, but because he knew it only externally,  and taught by the letter rather than by the spirit. In the first lesson he read  about the angry and jealous God of the Jews, and in the second declared the  everlasting Love of the Father, Who sent His beloved Son to suffer for His  children. Naturally the congregation could not understand such a contradiction,  and Mr. Sparrow did not explain, because he did not understand himself.  Therefore on Sundays he was rather a failure, while on week-days he was highly  successful. The fishermen and their wives could comprehend a parson who helped  them in their small needs and talked kindly to them, and shared their joys as  well as their sorrows. But what they could not comprehend was the priest who  tried to bully them into seeking a vague state of existence, which to them  appeared to be vapour and moonshine. They wanted proofs, or at least reason,  and they got neither.</p>
  <p align="left">In  his sermons Mr. Sparrow told those who listened drowsily that if they were  black with sin, they would go to hell: if they kept innocently white, they  would arrive in a dreamland heaven: but he made no provision for the grey  people. And as the majority of the congregation, if not the whole, belonged to  the third category, being neither particularly good nor particularly sinful,  the alternatives did not interest them much. Those in church adopted various  attitudes, said certain words, sang certain tunes, and went through a set  ceremony, with a vague idea that it was all necessary somehow to arrange  matters for a vague future. When Montrose came out he commented on their  orderly behaviour, and utter ignorance of what it all meant.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Though  of course,&rdquo; he added truthfully, &ldquo;there were some who understood more than the  rest. Still, what a clockwork ceremony!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  but, Douglas, the liturgy of the Church of England is very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  most beautiful the mind of man can conceive,&rdquo; he admitted readily. &ldquo;What can be  more glorious than the Litany, which includes all possible petitions that  mortals can offer. Said understandingly nothing can be more helpful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Sparrow read it beautifully, and the responses were made correctly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh  yes! But I missed the living spirit. It was all words, repeated parrot-fashion  by the majority&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say all&mdash;of those present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  what can the vicar do, Douglas? You know how dull the people are?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They  are children, more or less stupid,&rdquo; said Montrose with conviction, &ldquo;and can  grasp very little. Since Mr. Sparrow teaches them to love God and love their  neighbour, he is doing all that he can do. But he could colour the greyness of  his sermon: he could speak in parables as the Master did. Then he would arrest  their attention, and some ideas, if put picturesquely, would stick in their  minds. A man will forget a series of admonitions if stated baldly: he will  certainly remember some if connected with a story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  said Alice doubtfully. &ldquo;But Mr. Sparrow is a really good man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  that rather irrelevant?&rdquo; observed the young man dryly. &ldquo;I quite admit that he  is a good man. It is not his fault that the Church has lost her esoteric  knowledge, which was reserved for the intellectual, who wished to believe with  the head as well as with the heart. But he is only a sample of many parsons.  His intentions are of the best, but he does not speak with conviction to my  mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is a true believer,&rdquo; urged the girl, rather distressed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am sure he is everything that is genuine and kind,&rdquo; replied her lover, a trifle  impatiently. &ldquo;But he lacks that wisdom which comes from logical reasoning on  the things he discourses about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  can religion be proved logically?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly;  but only when one knows the esoteric teaching which the Church had, but which  the Church has lost. Eberstein has taught much of it to me during the last  three years, and there are few questions connected with religion and the Bible  which I cannot answer in at least a reasonable way. Go to Mr. Sparrow and he  will assure you that half the questions you ask are a mystery into which you  must not pry. What is the result, Alice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure I can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; she answered good-humouredly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  result is,&rdquo; continued Montrose, growing more vehement, &ldquo;that whenever a man  begins to think, he leaves the Church from sheer inability to gain the  information which is needed to reconcile what is taught with common sense. Only  the people who don&rsquo;t think, who are Christians because they happen to have been  brought up Christians, remain in the Church, and accept emotionally and blindly  whatever is told them on ecclesiastical authority. That, when examined, is no  authority at all to the thinking man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  the inner teaching?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  gives a perfectly reasonable and logical explanation which proves that the  exoteric teaching is true. I believe all that the Church sets forth save the  one word &lsquo;eternal&rsquo; before the one word &lsquo;hell.&rsquo; But then I know why I believe  and can defend my belief in a most positive manner, so that any man with common  sense must admit the logic of my arguments. Think if the parsons knew of this  teaching, and gave it out, how the churches would be thronged. People are not  irreligious nowadays. There never was a time when men and women wished to know  about the truth more anxiously than they do to-day. But they go to those in  authority and are given a stone in place of bread.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  will not the parsons take this teaching?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  cannot say. It changes nothing they teach outwardly, save the horrible doctrine  of eternal punishment, and gives back to all in a rational and convincing way  the faith they are gradually losing. Yet the Church goes on blindly repeating  the same things Sunday after Sunday, until they have lost their force. The  inner teaching would revive that force, if accepted, and the Church would be  able to fulfil her true mission, which is to lead civilisation. As it is, her  children will not stay with her. Pain is forcing the most advanced souls to try  and understand the problems of existence, and this understanding the esoteric  teaching gives, as I have proved myself. But the Church should be the teacher:  not pain, which comes from ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  these fishermen and women would only be bewildered if they sought to understand  the problems of life in the way you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course: because I am at a higher point of evolution. But what they are I was,  and only pain drove me to acquire further knowledge, as pain will drive them in  future lives. What Mr. Sparrow teaches them is all right: they are satisfied  with bread and do not desire cake. But what I maintain is that the vicar should  know more, and then he could do more good with his simple instruction by luring  them on to think D E F as well as A B C. However, he is a good man and does his  best according to his lights, and that is well. I daresay he is an interesting  man when he talks arch&aelig;ology, because that is his hobby and he is sincere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Douglas, I am sure Mr. Sparrow&rsquo;s religion is sincere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am sure it is,&rdquo; assented Montrose quickly. &ldquo;But his understanding is so limited  that he is unable to make religion interesting. And believe me, Alice, that  since I met Eberstein and learned what religion really is, I find it the most  interesting thing in the world. I know little as yet, as I learn but slowly.  Still I am beginning to grasp the great scheme of the present creation, and it  is so glorious and beautiful that I shall never rest until I understand it  sufficiently to take a conscious part in it, and do the work appointed to me as  Douglas Montrose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  was silent. What her lover said was beyond her understanding, as, save some  discussions with the limited Mr. Sparrow, she had never talked about such great  subjects. Her father never spoke of religion and never went to church, so she  really only knew what the vicar could teach her. So far as that went all was  well, but she sometimes yearned for a fuller comprehension of creation and for  reasonable explanations of life&rsquo;s riddles. From what Montrose had said it  seemed likely that he could teach her what she wished to know, and that  Eberstein, to whom he had referred, could teach her more when the time came.  Her face glowed at the idea and she felt anxious to be instructed at once. But  by this time they had wandered down the path to the beach, below the black cliffs,  and her lover was talking of other things. She therefore left theology alone  for lighter conversation, and approved of Montrose&rsquo;s appreciation of the beauty  which clothed sea and land.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  a lovely place, Alice. I am sure the fairies dance on these yellow sands in the  moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course they do,&rdquo; said Alice, now talking on a subject about which she knew a  great deal. &ldquo;Fairies really exist, you know. Se&ntilde;or Narvaez calls them  Nature-spirits. He showed me some one day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  turned on her in surprise. &ldquo;Are you clairvoyant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  Se&ntilde;or Narvaez says so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  does he know anything about clairvoyance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  great deal. So does my father. They both take an interest in such things, you  see, and study them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I know very little, save what information Don Pablo has given me. He says that  my clairvoyant faculty must be trained before it can be of any use.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;True  enough. Eberstein told me also that clairvoyance must be trained. But is Se&ntilde;or  Narvaez the man to train it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  knows much about the unseen, Douglas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  should not be surprised to learn that what he does know is of the worst, Alice,&rdquo;  said Douglas dryly. &ldquo;There is something evil about that man. I have only met  him twice and each time I was uncomfortable in his presence. He is like a snake,  a toad&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;oh, any noxious animal. And to think that he wanted to marry you. I  never heard of such insolence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  means well,&rdquo; said Alice soothingly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  doubt it. Anything he means is to his own advantage. I shouldn&rsquo;t be at all  surprised to learn that he was a Brother of the Shadow, since he knows about  unseen things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  Brother of the Shadow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  Eberstein tells me Black Magicians are called.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  are there really such men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  There are White Magicians and Black. They both have acquired super-physical  powers the same in essence, acting differently when used differently. Good men  use them to help: bad men use them to hurt. Just like dynamite, you know, dear.  You can use it for a good purpose to blow up rocks blocking a harbour, or for a  bad one to destroy life. But the thing itself and the action of the thing are  the same. How did you see these fairies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nature-spirits,&rdquo;  insisted Alice quickly. &ldquo;Oh, one day when I was on the moor Don Pablo came  along. He told me about them and I did not believe in such things. Then he took  my hand, saying I was clairvoyant. In some way his touch or some power which he  poured into me opened&rdquo;&mdash;Alice was puzzled how the experience could be explained&mdash;&ldquo;opened  a third eye, as it might be. I don&rsquo;t know exactly how to put it, but in some  way I saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Saw  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Little  men and women on the heather. Some were playing and others were at work. The  ground I sat on was alive with them. Yet when Don Pablo took his hand away, the  third eye closed and they vanished. But of course they were still around me,  though I could not see them. I told Julian about pixies and nixies, and he  laughingly said that it needed the eye of faith to see them. I daresay that was  my third eye. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perfectly.  Eberstein has explained some of these things to me. And I had an experience&mdash;&rdquo;  Douglas broke off abruptly, remembering that the doctor had asked him to say  nothing about his vision. &ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. But I quite believe that  the veil can be lifted, or perhaps&mdash;a better way of putting it&mdash;the veil can be  seen through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It  was lucky for Montrose that Alice&rsquo;s attention was distracted at the moment, as  she might have pressed him overhard to relate his experience. And as she had  her full share of feminine curiosity, she would not have been put off with  evasive replies. But at the rude jetty a boat had arrived and in the boat was a  tall girl, whom Miss Enistor recognised at once. She told Montrose to stay  where he was and ran down the slope to speak with Rose Penwin. The reason why  she did not want Douglas to accompany her was obvious.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Rose, why have you not been up to see me?&rdquo; asked Alice, when the girl moored  her boat to the jetty and stepped ashore.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have been too busy, miss,&rdquo; replied Rose, smiling, and showing a set of very white  teeth. &ldquo;Did you want me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  about Job Trevel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Rose flushed and drew herself up. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he been saying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing.  I haven&rsquo;t seen him. But people are talking, Rose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let  them talk,&rdquo; retorted the girl sullenly. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d a shilling for every bad word  they say of me I should be rich.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  looked at her in pained silence. Rose was a magnificent-looking woman, tall and  stately, highly coloured and beautiful. With her black hair and black eyes and  perfectly moulded figure, she looked the embodiment of a sea-goddess. Also her  dress was picturesque, with a touch of colour here and there pleasing to the  eye. But what Alice looked at most was a snake bracelet of Indian workmanship  in silver which clung round her right wrist. &ldquo;Do you think it right to let Don  Pablo give you such presents?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Rose  flushed still deeper and her eyes flashed with anger. &ldquo;He might be my  grandfather,&rdquo; she snapped in a savage manner.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Alice earnestly. &ldquo;Oh, Rose, you know how hot-blooded Job is.  And if you give him cause to be jealous&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s jealous or not, miss. The likes of me is a sight too good  for the likes of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  he&rsquo;s an honest man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  is Don Pablo, and what&rsquo;s more he&rsquo;s a richer man. If he was young I wouldn&rsquo;t let  him give me things. But whatever they may say, an old gentleman like that don&rsquo;t  mean no harm. Besides, I haven&rsquo;t said yes to Job.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  you will say yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  depends upon how Job behaves himself, miss. I&rsquo;m not going to have him glowering  and swearing as if I was doing something wrong, which I ain&rsquo;t. And begging your  pardon, miss, I don&rsquo;t see what you&rsquo;ve got to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to see you get into trouble,&rdquo; said Alice indiscreetly.</p>
  <p align="left">Rose  flashed round furiously. &ldquo;Who said I was going to get into trouble? I like  pretty things, and if an old gentleman gives them to me, where&rsquo;s the harm, I  should like to know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Job&rsquo;s  jealousy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let  him keep it to himself,&rdquo; interrupted Rose, who was in a fine rage. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t his  wife yet to be at his beck and call. And perhaps I never shall be if it comes  to that. Don Pablo says that a girl like me would make plenty of money in  London as an artist&rsquo;s model: or I might go on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think Don Pablo should be ashamed of himself to poison your mind in this way,&rdquo;  burst out Alice, angry in her turn. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Inherited  respect for the Squire&rsquo;s daughter kept Rose within bounds, but for the moment  she looked as though she would strike Alice. With an effort she turned away,  biting her lip and clenching her hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forget myself if I stay, miss.  You&rsquo;d best keep away from me!&rdquo; and before Miss Enistor could stop her she  fairly ran up the path past Montrose on her hurried way to the village. Douglas  turned to stare after the flying figure, and wondered what Alice had said to  send the girl away with such wrath depicted on her face.</p>
  <p align="left">At  the same moment as Rose disappeared Alice heard a deep male voice speaking to  her, and turned to see Job clambering up on the hither side of the jetty. He  was a tall, bulky, powerful man, with red hair and keen blue eyes, handsome and  virile in a common way, and exhibited a strength which appealed to every woman  for miles around. At one time it appealed to Rose, but since Don Pablo had  poisoned her mind she had risked an unpleasant exhibition of that strength by  her coquettish behaviour. Job looked dour and dangerous, and there was a spark  in his blue eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  heard what you said, Miss Alice,&rdquo; he remarked, drawing a deep breath. &ldquo;I was  under the jetty waiting for her coming. But when you spoke to her I thought I&rsquo;d  just wait to hear if she&rsquo;d listen to sense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t seem like it, Job,&rdquo; said Alice sadly, and looked with distress on the  splendid figure of her foster-brother.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  it don&rsquo;t, miss,&rdquo; he responded gloomily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got the bit between her teeth,  she has. It&rsquo;s all that foreign devil, begging your pardon for the word, Miss  Alice. I&rsquo;d like to strangle him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be silly, talking in that way, Job. It&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  will be for him, if he don&rsquo;t sheer off,&rdquo; muttered the man vengefully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Job,  you know quite well that Don Pablo is an old man: he must be eighty if an hour.  You can&rsquo;t be jealous of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  I am, Miss Alice, and it ain&rsquo;t no good saying as I&rsquo;m not. What right has he to  give her presents and talk about taking her to London? I&rsquo;ll break his neck if  he goes on with such talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  tried to defend the Spaniard, not because she thought he was acting rightly,  but for the simple reason that she wished to talk Job into a calmer state of  mind. At the moment the man was dangerous. &ldquo;Don Pablo only admires Rose as a  beautiful woman,&rdquo; she urged.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  he shan&rsquo;t. No one shall admire her but me. And if he wants to marry, Miss Alice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  nonsense,&rdquo; she broke in. &ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s too old.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  they did say as you were going to marry him,&rdquo; retorted Trevel coolly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am going to do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; cried the girl, stamping her foot. &ldquo;I  think you should be more sensible than to suggest such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t suggest it,&rdquo; said Job stolidly. &ldquo;But the Squire wants&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care what the Squire wants,&rdquo; interrupted Alice, with another stamp. &ldquo;People  say things they have no right to say. You are my foster-brother, Job, and I  allow you more licence than most. But you must never speak to me in this way  again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t mean any harm, Miss Alice, and my heart is sore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Poor  Job!&rdquo; Alice became sorry for the big man. &ldquo;You do suffer, and Rose ought to be  ashamed of herself to cause you such pain. Get her to marry you at once and  laugh at Don Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  won&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s got her fair under his thumb, Miss Alice,&rdquo; said Trevel gloomily. &ldquo;I  hate him, and so does everyone else. He&rsquo;s the only man as I ever heard the  parson have a bad word for. There&rsquo;s something about that foreign chap,&rdquo; Job  clenched a huge fist, &ldquo;as makes you want to squash him like a toad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  nodded comprehendingly. &ldquo;All the same you must do him no harm, or you will get  into trouble. And remember, Job, that I am your friend&rdquo;&mdash;she gave him her hand&mdash;&ldquo;and  to prove it I shall tell you what will please you. I am engaged to that  gentleman over there&mdash;Mr. Montrose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Trevel  shook the hand heartily and his face grew good-natured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fair glad of it,  miss. I&rsquo;ve seen the gentleman and like the gentleman. He&rsquo;s been down in the  village with Mr. Hardwick, as we like also. As to that foreigner, miss&mdash;ugh!&rdquo; Job  scowled and turned away, while Alice went back to Douglas.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have been trying to reconcile two lovers, but I have failed,&rdquo; she told him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  is the cause of the quarrel?&rdquo; asked the young man, amused.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  dangerous one. Don Pablo,&rdquo; and she gave details.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  an old beast!&rdquo; said Montrose. &ldquo;If I were that fisherman I&rsquo;d screw his neck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  put such ideas into Job&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; cried Alice rebukingly. &ldquo;He is angry enough as  it is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All  the worse for Don Pablo, my dear!&rdquo; and so they left the matter, which was of  less importance then than it became afterwards.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII"><b>Chapter XIII</b></a><b><br>
    Further Small Beer Chronicles</b></h2>
  <p align="left">When  the young people went to church, Enistor took the opportunity of paying a visit  to Narvaez. The effort to keep up an appearance of friendship for a man he  hated was not easy, and the Squire wished to unbend in the society of one who  knew his true sentiments. Also he greatly desired to learn what were Don Pablo&rsquo;s  plans regarding the restoration of the fortune, for the Spaniard did not seem  to be moving in the matter at all, and valuable time was being wasted. And  since Enistor was anxious to get rid of Montrose as speedily as possible, he  thought it was just as well to suggest that the scheme&mdash;whatever it might  be&mdash;should be completed as soon as could be conveniently managed. The master of  Tremore wanted to handle the coveted income; he wished to see his daughter  married to Narvaez, and finally he desired to learn the nature of this danger  at which Don Pablo hinted so frequently. Of course the marriage with the Spaniard,  by making possible the training of Alice&rsquo;s clairvoyant powers, would soon  disclose this last.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  walked leisurely over the moor to where the evil mount with its crown of  monoliths was indistinctly outlined against the grey sky. As it was now autumn,  the heavens had lost their summer azure, and the earth had been stripped of its  flowering splendour. He wandered through a ruined world, where the red and  brown and yellow of the dying bracken were veiled in chilly mists. The ground  was sodden, the herbage was dripping wet, and the cries of the birds sounded  mournful, as though they were regretting the passing of warm weather. That  Enistor should see the prostrate body of a man lying amidst the fantastic  colours of the moorland seemed to be so much in keeping with the general air of  decay and sadness that he did not even start when he bent over the still form.  But he did utter an ejaculation when he looked at the white face and recognised  Julian Hardwick.</p>
  <p align="left">Why  the artist should be here in an unconscious condition Enistor did not pause to  inquire. He was above all a man of action, and as it was necessary to revive  Hardwick, he hastened to fill his cap with water at a convenient pool. The  chill of the fluid on the white face flushed it with returning life, and when  Enistor loosened the collar, and shook the body, Julian opened his eyes  languidly. In a half-dazed way he murmured something about brandy, a hint which  the Squire acted upon by searching the artist&rsquo;s pockets. He soon found what he  looked for, and a drink of the generous liquor revived Hardwick so speedily  that he was soon able to sit up and talk.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  heart is weak,&rdquo; he said in a stronger voice, buttoning his collar.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  was frankly amazed. &ldquo;Why, you always look singularly healthy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because  I am big and well-covered with flesh it is natural you should think so, Mr.  Enistor. But the heart doesn&rsquo;t do its work properly. That is why I live so much  in the open air, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk so much. You are exhausting yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hardwick  took a second drink of brandy, and as the heart quickened he began to look more  like his old self. &ldquo;I am all right now,&rdquo; he assured his helper, &ldquo;I can manage  to crawl to my lodgings and lie down for a time.&rdquo; He got on to his feet and  stretched himself languidly. &ldquo;I always carry brandy on the chance of these  attacks!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  couldn&rsquo;t have used the brandy had I not been here to help you,&rdquo; said the Squire  bluntly. &ldquo;If you are liable to such seizures you should not venture to wander  on these lonely moors by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps  not! But it is rarely I become so incapable. Thank you very much for being so  kind. I shall go home now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Then  Enistor made an effort which rather amazed himself. &ldquo;Let me take you home,  Hardwick. You are not fit to go by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hardwick  was as amazed as the man who made this offer. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you would bother  about me in that way,&rdquo; he said weakly: then he straightened himself with an  effort. &ldquo;Thank you all the same, but I can manage!&rdquo; And giving his preserver a  friendly handshake, he moved along the path which meandered towards Polwellin.</p>
  <p align="left">The  Squire stood looking after him, thinking that he might fall again and require  further assistance. But the tall figure moved steadily through the mists,  apparently possessed of sufficient vital power to reach the haven of home in  safety. Then the Squire thoughtfully resumed his way to Don Pablo&rsquo;s cottage,  wondering at the discovery he had made. Hardwick looked so strong and well, and  was so massive and imposing in appearance, that no one could possibly have  guessed that his heart was weak. But Enistor did not wonder at this alone: he  wondered also at his own kind offer to go out of his way to help any one in  distress. It was rather a weak thing to do, he reflected, and not at all an  action of which Narvaez would approve. All the same Enistor resolved to tell  the Spaniard if only for his own glorification.</p>
  <p align="left">Don  Pablo was seated by a huge fire in his sinister study, with a paper in his  hands covered with odd signs and hieroglyphics. With his usual serenity he  murmured a welcome and pointed to a chair. But he did not speak further for the  moment and Enistor employed the time in trying to read the inscrutable face,  which was seamed with a thousand wrinkles and made quite inhuman by the  passionless look of the cold, steady, blue eyes. Shortly the old man laid the  paper aside with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  are you doing?&rdquo; asked Enistor curiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have been casting Hardwick&rsquo;s horoscope,&rdquo; was the unexpected reply. &ldquo;For the  satisfaction of his own curiosity he gave me the day and hour of his birth,&rdquo; he  smiled in a cruel way. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will be pleased at what I have to tell  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  telepathic message passed swiftly from one trained brain to the other and  Enistor nodded in a surprised manner. &ldquo;He may die at any moment,&rdquo; said the  Squire, translating Don Pablo&rsquo;s thoughts. &ldquo;Well, that is very likely. I found  him unconscious on the moor a short time ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is not dead?&rdquo; questioned Narvaez, with unusual interest.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh  no. I revived him with water and some brandy he had in his pocket. Also I  offered to see him home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  demanded the other coldly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  he seemed weak and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  often have I told you that other people&rsquo;s troubles do not concern you, Enistor!  If you choose to waste your powers on assisting weaker persons, you will lose  much force better employed in your own gain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not quite so hard as you are,&rdquo; snapped the Squire, sharply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  quite so wise, you mean,&rdquo; was the unmoved response. &ldquo;However, I pardon your  weakness on this occasion, as I don&rsquo;t want Hardwick to die&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you wish him to die at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  last word implied that I did. It is part of my plan to get the fortune you  desire, which also means that I shall secure your daughter as my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no need for you to see,&rdquo; said Narvaez tyrannically; &ldquo;you do what I tell you  and all will be well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you mean to kill Hardwick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  There is no need for me to move a finger. His horoscope shows an early death  from natural causes. Having found him unconscious, I leave you to guess what  those causes will be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have no need to guess. Hardwick&rsquo;s heart is weak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exactly.  The organs of his body are healthy, but he has not a sufficiently strong heart.  If he could get a fresh supply of vitality he would be a powerful and long-lived  man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you intend to give him that vitality?&rdquo; sneered the visitor.</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez  chuckled. &ldquo;Yes! You will see that splendid body walking about filled with  strenuous life some day soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  body walking about.&rdquo; Enistor stared keenly at the mocking, cruel face. &ldquo;I must  say you speak very strangely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  speak as I speak, and what I mean to say I say,&rdquo; rejoined Don Pablo  enigmatically. &ldquo;Let us change the subject, as I am busy. Your errand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  only came to get the taste of that young prig out of my mouth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  waste my time. Why can&rsquo;t you rely on your own strength? I am not going to have  you here draining mine, particularly when this body I have at present is so  frail. Act the courteous host and give the young fool as much of your daughter&rsquo;s  company as he desires. The rest can be left to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  when are you going to move in the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When  the time is ripe and when I choose. How often am I to tell you that it is  impossible to hurry things? Corn takes time to grow: a rose takes time to  unfold, and everything in the visible and invisible world progresses inch by  inch, step by step. Nature, as you should know by this time, is a tortoise and  not a kangaroo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is another reason why I came,&rdquo; said Enistor, accepting the rebuke with a  meekness foreign to his nature; &ldquo;that fisherman&mdash;Trevel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well?  He is annoyed because I give the girl jewels, and waken her ambition to be  something better than a domestic drudge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;His  annoyance extends to an intention to kill you,&rdquo; said Enistor dryly. &ldquo;I advise  you to be careful, Master. Trevel is dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dangerous!&rdquo;  Narvaez spoke with supreme contempt. &ldquo;You know what I am and yet talk of danger  to me from an ignorant boor. I could guard myself in a hundred ways if I so  chose. But,&rdquo; ended Narvaez deliberately, &ldquo;I do not choose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  wonder what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  may wonder. Threatened men live long. Content yourself with that proverb. And  now go; I am busy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Without  a word Enistor rose and walked to the door. There he paused to say a few words  not complimentary to Narvaez, and he said them with a black look of suppressed  rage. &ldquo;You treat me like a dog,&rdquo; snarled the weaker man. &ldquo;Be careful that I do  not bite you like a dog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  trust you as little as any one else, and am always on my guard,&rdquo; said the  magician mildly, and stared in a cold sinister way at his pupil. Enistor felt a  wave of some cruel force surge against him&mdash;a force which struck him with the  dull stunning blows of a hammer, and which twisted his nerves so sharply that  but for dogged pride he would have shrieked with pain. As it was he writhed and  grew deadly pale, the sweat beading his brow showing what agony he suffered.  Hours seemed to be concentrated into that one long minute during which Narvaez  held him in the vice of his will, and made him suffer the torments of the  damned.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  beat my dog when he bites,&rdquo; said an unemotional voice. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; And Enistor,  conquered by supreme pain, crept away in silence. As the door closed, he heard  his master chuckle like a parrot over a piece of cake.</p>
  <p align="left">The  Squire returned painfully to Tremore, cursing himself for having been such a  fool as to defy a man possessed of super-physical powers. Twice before he had  done so, and each time Don Pablo had inflicted torments. The man, more learned  than an ordinary hypnotist, simply used in a greater degree the will and  suggestion which such a one employs. A hypnotist can make his subject believe  that he has toothache, or has taken poison, by insisting with superior force  that he shall so believe. Narvaez, more learned in the laws which govern this creation,  compelled Enistor in this way to feel the torments of a heretic on the rack,  without resorting to the ordinary necessity of casting his subject into a  hypnotic trance. If Enistor had concentrated his will, he could have repelled  the suggestion, but he had not the terrific power of concentration which ages  of exercise had given Don Pablo. He was in the presence of a powerful  influence, directed by an equally powerful will, and therefore had no weapons  with which to fight his dark master. In a fury Enistor wished that he could  make Narvaez suffer in the same degree, but he knew that he could never hope to  do so. Even if he became possessed of knowledge, of concentration, and of a  more powerful will than was human, the Spaniard knew of ways which could baffle  the attack. The sole consolation which Enistor had to pacify his wounded pride  was that there was no disgrace in a mere mortal being beaten by a superman.  Narvaez, in a minor degree, was a god, a very evil god, and those worshippers  who did not obey him felt very speedily what their deity could do. Enistor had  no wish to measure forces with so powerful a being again.</p>
  <p align="left">For  the rest of that week he left the magician alone and devoted himself to  entertaining his guest. It was impossible to induce Narvaez to act until he  chose to act, and all that could be done was to obey his instructions and  behave agreeably to Montrose, so that the visitor might be lulled into false  security. Never was there so amiable a host as the Squire; never was there so  genial a companion, and Douglas became quite fascinated with a personality  which transcended his own. The young man was so much weaker than his host that  the latter wondered why Narvaez did not compel him to surrender the fortune by  putting forth resistless power. Had Enistor guessed that Montrose&rsquo;s desire to  do good and to love every one nullified the evil spell, he would have wondered  less. And at the same time Enistor would have understood how, not having  unselfish love in his own breast, he lay open to the assaults of the magician.  As he treated others so he was treated, and a realisation of this golden truth  would have enabled him to defy Narvaez and his suggestions. But the mere fact  that he wished to exercise the same might-over-right free-lance law prevented his  understanding how to defend himself from a more accomplished devil. And Don  Pablo was as much a devil as there is possible to be one, since he wholly  obeyed the instincts, carefully fostered, of hate and selfishness. Enistor was  a very minor devil indeed, as he had too much of the milk of human kindness in  him as yet to equal or rival the superior fiend.</p>
  <p align="left">In  his determination to act his comedy thoroughly, Enistor went to the great  length of asking the vicar and his wife to dinner. As Mr. Sparrow had never  before been invited to break bread under the Squire&rsquo;s roof, he was extremely  surprised by the unexpected honour. At first he was minded to decline, since  Enistor never came to church and never took the least interest in matters  connected with the parish. But Mrs. Sparrow pointed out that this desire for  their company might be a sign of grace, and that if they went, it might entail  the reformation of their host. Also the dinner was sure to be good, and she  could wear her new dress in decent society, which she very rarely had an  opportunity of doing. Urged in this way and having a certain amount of  curiosity of his own regarding the splendours of the big house, Mr. Sparrow  sent an acceptance in his neat Oxford calligraphy. The Squire gave it to his  daughter and told her to order the dinner.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;See  that it is a good one,&rdquo; said Enistor genially. &ldquo;Sparrow is as lean as a fasting  friar and won&rsquo;t object to a decent meal for once. It isn&rsquo;t Lent or any of their  confounded Church feasts, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  answered Alice, very much puzzled by this unusual behaviour; &ldquo;but why do you  ask Mr. and Mrs. Sparrow to dinner? I thought you didn&rsquo;t like them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t! They are a couple of bores. But it is rather dull here for Montrose, and  we must get what society we can to cheer him up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think Douglas is very well satisfied with my company,&rdquo; retorted the girl,  rather nettled by the implied slight, &ldquo;and these two bores, as you call them,  certainly will not amuse him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  well; ask Hardwick also. He isn&rsquo;t a bore and Montrose likes him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Julian  isn&rsquo;t very well, father. He hasn&rsquo;t been since you found him on the moor  fainting. But I shall send the invitation. Shall you ask Se&ntilde;or Narvaez?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  said her father sharply and uneasily, for his body still tingled with the  memory of Don Pablo&rsquo;s reproof. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t submit him to the ordeal of enduring  so dull a set of people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Complimentary  to us all,&rdquo; said Alice dryly, then regretted the retort; &ldquo;I am sure you wish to  make things pleasant for Douglas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course! I wish him to stay here as long as he likes,&rdquo; said Enistor, with an  emphasis which she could not quite understand. &ldquo;See that everything is all  right, my dear. I want the dinner-party to be a success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Rather  amazed at the way in which her usually selfish father sacrificed himself, Alice  consulted the housekeeper, and made all preparations for this rare festivity.  When the evening came, the parson and his wife duly arrived and at their heels  followed Hardwick, who had willingly accepted the chance of an evening in the  company of Alice, whom he loved as a sister, and Montrose, who appealed to him  as an unusually agreeable and decent fellow. The Squire welcomed his guests  cordially, and took Mrs. Sparrow in to dinner. She was a faded, colourless  woman with a washed-out appearance, markedly accentuated by the gauzy grey  dress she wore. Alice in a delicate pink frock, which set off her evasive  beauty to great advantage, looked like a fresh sunrise beside a wet, misty  autumn day. Douglas could not keep his eyes off her and Hardwick was equally  pressing in his attentions.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  you must not over-tax your strength, Julian,&rdquo; said Alice, when she found  herself at the dinner-table between the artist and Mr. Sparrow, who had  escorted her thereto.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I am all right now,&rdquo; replied Hardwick, &ldquo;no better and no worse than I ever was.  You were surprised when your father told you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  was greatly grieved, Julian. And it seems so strange that a big man such as you  are should be so delicate. You should see a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have seen several, but they can do me no good,&rdquo; said the artist sadly. &ldquo;In  every way I am healthy, so there is nothing to cure. All I lack is what they  cannot give me, and that is a new supply of life-force.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  it is vitality you want, Hardwick,&rdquo; said Montrose, speaking across the table, &ldquo;you  should consult Dr. Eberstein, who is coming down shortly to Perchton. He is  wonderful in many ways and I am certain he would do you good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  cannot breathe more breath of life into a man than what that man already has,&rdquo;  said Mr. Sparrow, in a tone of sad rebuke. &ldquo;God alone is able to do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo;  murmured Mrs. Sparrow, in an equally sad tone, &ldquo;you should pray for strength,  Mr. Hardwick. We are told to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  thought that was spiritual strength?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  what more do you want?&rdquo; replied the lady, forgetting the exact point under  discussion. &ldquo;Let us watch and pray lest we fall into temptation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear!&rdquo; murmured the vicar in an undertone, for he felt that this conversation  was too professional for the occasion.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Quite  so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sparrow, taking the hint, and did not open her mouth for some  time save to eat and drink. All the same she watched for an opportunity to lead  the conversation towards such religious topics as she and her husband were  interested in. This was to be done with a view of surprising the Squire with  the extent of her husband&rsquo;s knowledge. Now she had managed to enter the big  house, she did not intend to go out again in a hurry. Enistor was a valuable  parishioner, and if he could be brought to defer to Mr. Sparrow much could be  done with him and with his money.</p>
  <p align="left">The  table looked charming with its snow-white napery, on which glittered crystal  and silver, while the dinner-service was a thing of beauty. The scarlet and  golden autumn leaves which decorated the board, the mellow light of the many  wax candles, the well-cooked food and the delicious wines, all impressed the  vicar&rsquo;s wife greatly. She even felt a little angry that such a heathen as the  Squire surely was should possess these luxuries, while Mr. Sparrow&mdash;capable of  being a bishop in her opinion&mdash;was content with unlovely surroundings and plain  viands, prepared in anything but an inviting way by their one servant. No, not  content&mdash;that was the wrong word to use. He put up with ascetic living, while  the wicked&mdash;meaning Mr. Enistor&mdash;lived on the fat of the land. It was enough to  shake the faith of a Christian lady in the fairness of things. And truth to  tell, Mrs. Sparrow, in spite of her anxious faith, frequently doubted if the  world was governed justly. She and her husband did all that the Bible told them  to do in the way of living uprightly and unselfishly, therefore they should  certainly long before this have sat under their own fig-tree, possessing beeves  and lands according to the promise. As it was, they were as poor as rats, or  rather as church mice, which seemed to be the more ecclesiastical comparison.  Clearly there was something wrong somewhere in the way in which mundane matters  were ordered.</p>
  <p align="left">Meantime,  the Squire had started Mr. Sparrow on arch&aelig;ology, as the best way of keeping  him off theology, and the parson was talking eagerly about a certain red  granite heart, inscribed with weird signs, which he had dug up on the hill  where the Roman camp was to be seen. &ldquo;Near the cottage of that Spanish  gentleman,&rdquo; he explained precisely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know,&rdquo; said Enistor; and indeed he knew the hill very well in a way of which  Mr. Sparrow would scarcely have approved.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is a Druidical altar there,&rdquo; went on the clergyman eagerly, &ldquo;and I have no  doubt many dreadful sacrifices took place there in the old days. This  heart&mdash;which I shall be delighted to show you if you call at the vicarage, Mr.  Enistor&mdash;no doubt had to do with the terrible rites.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Earlier  than that,&rdquo; put in Montrose unexpectedly, &ldquo;the heart was the symbol of the  Atlantean race, as the cross is the symbol of the Aryan. The hieroglyphics on  it mean doubtless the sacred word &lsquo;Tau.&rsquo; Aum is the sacred word of our present  people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tau!  Aum! Atlantean!&rdquo; echoed Sparrow, much perplexed. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  would take too long to explain, sir. Dr. Eberstein, who told me about these  things, is the best person to consult.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  wish to consult no one,&rdquo; said the parson, drawing himself up. &ldquo;I believe the  heart to be a symbol of the Druids.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  symbol of Atlantis rather,&rdquo; insisted Montrose; &ldquo;this very land on which we are  was part of the great continent of Atlantis.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  mere fable, sir. You are thinking of the myth which Plato mentions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is no myth, but an actual truth, Mr. Sparrow. Atlantis did exist and was  overwhelmed by that flood you will find mentioned in the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Absurd!  The name of Atlantis is not mentioned in Holy Scripture. There is no proof that  what Plato says is true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This  much proof, that as far back as arch&aelig;ologists can go the civilisation of Egypt  was in full swing. Where did that civilisation come from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  grew up in the Valley of the Nile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly,  but the beginnings were brought to the Valley of the Nile by a highly civilised  race. Remember it was the Egyptian priests who told Plato about Atlantis. They  knew, because Egypt was a colony of that mighty continent. There was another  colony in Central America, and you will find the vast ruins of its cities  described in a book by D&eacute;sir&eacute; Charnay. The civilisation of Mexico and Peru  destroyed by the Spaniards was the last remains of the splendour of the  Atlanteans.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where  did you hear all this, Mr. Montrose?&rdquo; asked the Squire quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;From  Dr. Eberstein. You can ask him for yourself when he comes down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  should like to meet him,&rdquo; said Mr. Sparrow primly, &ldquo;but I do not think that I  shall agree with a single word he says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  why ask him?&rdquo; asked Montrose, very naturally.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To  confute him, sir. What we know of the early world is all contained in Genesis.  There is no mention of Atlantis there, although there is of Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  about the chronology of the Bible? It has been proved, Mr. Sparrow&mdash;and you as  an arch&aelig;ologist must admit this&mdash;that the civilisation of Egypt extends further  back than the date given in Genesis as the beginning of the world. What do you  say to that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  could say a great deal,&rdquo; retorted the parson, whose arch&aelig;ological knowledge was  always struggling with his religious beliefs; &ldquo;but this is not the time or the  place to say more. When Dr. Eberstein, who is your authority for these  startling statements, arrives I shall be happy to thresh the matter out with  him. It will be an intellectual pleasure. I get few opportunities of that sort  down here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is very probable,&rdquo; said Hardwick, nodding; &ldquo;your parishioners are a good sort,  but not very learned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They  have no need to be learned, Mr. Hardwick. Let them fulfil their daily task, and  be satisfied with the position in which they have been placed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  they take your advice,&rdquo; said the Squire dryly, &ldquo;there will be no chance of  their rising in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  should they try to rise?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Sparrow, coming to her husband&rsquo;s aid.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  my dear lady, it is said that the common or garden millionaire usually starts  his pile with the proverbial halfpenny. If he accepted your husband&rsquo;s ruling,  he would never attempt to rise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is divinely ordained that some people must be high and some low.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rather  hard on the low people. I think every one should be dissatisfied, myself: that  is the only thing that makes for progress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did  you promulgate this extraordinary doctrine in the village, Mr. Enistor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  replied the Squire, glancing at the parson, who spoke. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because  some of my parishioners are very dissatisfied indeed. Mrs. Trevel was hard up  last winter, and prayed for money. She did not get it, and told me that she did  not intend to pray any more, as it seemed useless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  what explanation did you give her?&rdquo; asked Alice anxiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  was horrified at her impiety, Miss Enistor, as any right-minded person would  be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; murmured Montrose ironically, &ldquo;how dare she ask for money when she was  hard up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mr.  Sparrow took no notice of him. &ldquo;I told her that God thought she required  discipline and that she must not complain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  should she require discipline rather than a millionaire?&rdquo; asked Julian.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  may have more original sin in her,&rdquo; said Mr. Sparrow, floundering in a bog and  getting quite out of his depth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said Montrose grimly, &ldquo;if according to your teaching, Mr. Sparrow, we all start  as brand-new souls, given a set of circumstances over which we have no control  at the outset, and with the same goal of heaven or hell at the end, it seems to  me that every one ought to start at scratch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; said the parson, doggedly illogical, &ldquo;some are rich and some are poor;  some are clever and some are stupid; some are ill and some are well. It is all  divinely ordained.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  so unfair,&rdquo; urged Julian, seeing the absurdity of the speech.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What,  sir, shall the clay say to the potter what it wants to be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  really don&rsquo;t see why the clay shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; put in Mr. Enistor, who liked to see  the parson driven into a corner, &ldquo;especially when the clay has nerves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All  is divinely ordained,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Sparrow piously, &ldquo;we must not murmur. I  regard Mrs. Trevel as a most impious person for daring to rebel when her  prayers are not answered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  told her that,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;and she only laughed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Bitterly,  I expect,&rdquo; murmured Montrose; &ldquo;poor soul, I shall give her some money in the  morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mr. Sparrow. &ldquo;It will only confirm her in disbelief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;On  the contrary it will restore her faith,&rdquo; remarked the Squire coolly, &ldquo;as it  will show that her prayers are answered after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mr.  Sparrow had nothing to say after this, although he greatly longed to preach a  sermon to those present. But not being in the pulpit he feared lest his  statements should be contradicted by these ribald people. Therefore he wisely  held his tongue on religious subjects for the rest of the evening. On the way  home, however, he made one scathing remark to his wife.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They  are all atheists, Jane. Just the kind I expected to find under the roof of a  man who does not come to church.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XIV"><b>Chapter XIV</b></a><b><br>
    Preparation</b></h2>
  <p align="left">On  the morning of the third day after the dinner, Montrose received a letter from  Dr. Eberstein saying that he was arriving in Perchton that same evening. At  once the young man decided to see his friend at the watering-place and stay  there for the night. He was anxious to tell the doctor how Enistor&rsquo;s character  had been misunderstood, and what an agreeable man he was to live with. Also he  asked the Squire if he could bring back Eberstein for a few hours&rsquo; visit, to  which Enistor heartily agreed. The schemer was looking forward to meeting the  man&mdash;if he was simply a man and not something greater&mdash;whom Narvaez called &ldquo;The  Adversary.&rdquo; Confident of receiving support from Don Pablo, the Squire was  anxious to come to grips with the opposing power that wished to thwart his  plans. The suspense of the delay in any decided action being taken chafed  Enistor considerably, and he wished to arrive at the desired conclusion as  swiftly as possible. Narvaez advised waiting and Enistor rejected the advice.  He had not the inexhaustible patience of his master.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  suggested that as Hardwick was going on that day to Perchton to consult a doctor  about his health, Douglas should accompany him. The artist as usual had  borrowed his rich friend&rsquo;s motor-car, and when a message was sent to him,  replied that he would be delighted to have Montrose with him. To avoid the  necessity of the car climbing the hill to Tremore, Douglas went down to  Polwellin with a medium-sized bag, containing what necessaries he required for  his night&rsquo;s absence. Alice walked with him, and they left the bag at Hardwick&rsquo;s  lodgings, where the car was to arrive some time during the afternoon. It was  already long after midday, and having to get rid of an hour of waiting, the  girl proposed that they should call on Dame Trevel.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  said you would help her, Douglas,&rdquo; she reminded him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course. I should have seen her on the morning after the dinner, when I told Mr.  Sparrow that I would give her money. It was wrong of me not to keep my promise.  The vicar will think that I am like every one else, and say much but do little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think the vicar will think anything about the matter,&rdquo; said Alice  candidly. &ldquo;Mrs. Trevel is a heretic in his eyes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Simply  because she won&rsquo;t believe blindly against her better reason. There is a great  want of logic about priestly authority. With the teachers of exoteric knowledge  it is &lsquo;Obey or be damned!&rsquo; which is something like the reported motto of the  French Revolution: &lsquo;Be my brother, or I&rsquo;ll kill you.&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  Mr. Sparrow is a good man, Douglas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  admitted long ago that he was a good man, my dear. But a good man with a  limited understanding can do more harm than a bad man. There are other ways of  teaching a child than by boxing his ears until he is stupid with pain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think Dame Trevel would like to be called a child,&rdquo; said Alice, with an  amused laugh.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear, the majority of human beings are children. The longer I live, the more I see that. I  am a child myself in many ways, although, as Eberstein is widening my  limitations, I am beginning to grow up. Children,&rdquo; Montrose spoke half to  himself and half to his companion, &ldquo;what else? Instead of cake and toys, we  want gold and lands, and power and pleasure. Whether we deserve them or not we  clamour for them, just like a child. We become cross when things don&rsquo;t go as we  wish them, and slap the bad naughty table that has hurt baby in the shape of anything  which impedes our getting what we desire. Good Lord, how can any man be angry  with another man, when he knows that his enemy is but a child? But to know that  one must be more than a child oneself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you call me a child?&rdquo; asked Alice, pouting.</p>
  <p align="left">At  the very door of Dame Trevel&rsquo;s cottage Montrose bent to kiss her. &ldquo;A very  charming child, who shall never be put into the corner by me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  talk as though you were the only wise man in existence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  assented Montrose, laughing. &ldquo;I speak as though I were the judge of the earth  instead of being a denizen. La Rochefoucauld says that. Go in, Alice, and let  us get our interview over. We haven&rsquo;t overmuch time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Trevel received her visitors in a clean little room, poorly furnished but  fairly comfortable. She was a gaunt old creature, London born and London bred,  so she did not speak in the Cornish way. But indeed, thanks to the authority of  school-boards, the local dialects are fast disappearing, and the girl idly  remembered at the moment how ordinary was the wording of Rose Penwin and her  fisherman-lover. The sight of Dame Trevel seated in her big chair suggested the  names, as the absence of the West Country shibboleth in her speech suggested  the thought of the younger generation whose dialect had been, so to speak,  wiped out. The old woman was glad, as usual, to see her nursling and highly  approved of the handsome young man who was to marry her, as all Polwellin knew  by this time.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  hope it will be all sunshine with you two,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trevel, when her visitors  were seated. &ldquo;And that you&rsquo;ll live to see your children&rsquo;s children playing  about your knees, my dears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;With  Alice beside me it is bound to be sunshine,&rdquo; replied Douglas heartily. &ldquo;She is  an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah,  my young sir, men always call women so before marriage; but what do they call  them afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  depends mainly on the woman, I fancy,&rdquo; said Montrose dryly. &ldquo;A wife can make  her husband whatever she chooses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  silk purse out of a sow&rsquo;s ear,&rdquo; retorted Miss Enistor saucily. &ldquo;But Douglas and  I understand one another, nurse, and there will be no cause for quarrels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  wish I could say the same about my lad and the girl he has set his heart on  marrying,&rdquo; sighed Dame Trevel, laying down her knitting and removing her  spectacles. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more her fault than his, though. Rose is a flighty piece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  won&rsquo;t listen to reason,&rdquo; said Alice, shaking her head wisely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Does  any woman ever listen to reason?&rdquo; inquired Montrose with a shrug.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;From  a man she won&rsquo;t; but from a woman she will. Don&rsquo;t be cynical. But I have talked  to Rose without success,&rdquo; ended Alice, turning to her nurse.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  have I, my dearie, and then she told me to mind my own business; as if it wasn&rsquo;t  my business to see that my lad got a decent wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  no real harm in Rose,&rdquo; cried Alice hastily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not saying there is. But why she should take jewels from that foreign gentleman  and make Job wild, I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Women  are fond of jewels,&rdquo; suggested Douglas.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  why not if they get them in the right way?&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Trevel ungraciously. &ldquo;But  Rose is to marry my lad, and he don&rsquo;t want her visiting that old gentleman and  taking presents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Old  is the word, nurse,&rdquo; said Alice swiftly. &ldquo;Job can&rsquo;t be jealous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  he is, and his jealousy is dangerous, just as his father&rsquo;s was before him,  dearie. And the foreign gentleman puzzles me,&rdquo; added the old woman, taking up  her knitting again. &ldquo;They did say he was to marry you, my love&mdash;by your father&rsquo;s  wish, I swear, and never by your own will. December and May. Ha! A pretty match  that would be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  marry Douglas and no one else, nurse, whatever my father may say or do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a dour gentleman is the Squire,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trevel, shaking her head, &ldquo;and not  pleasant to cross. He never treated your mother well, and she faded like a  delicate flower blown upon by cold winds. To me, dearie, he behaves cruel in  the way of rent, for all my bringing you up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  doesn&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; said Alice, distressed, and driven to defending her father,  although she knew only too well his high-handed methods with tenants who could  not or would not pay.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Out  of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh,&rdquo; quoted Mrs. Trevel in a sour  way. &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t mean it, why does he do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Says  he&rsquo;ll turn me out bag and baggage if I don&rsquo;t pay the rent,&rdquo; cried the old woman  excitedly. &ldquo;How can I when the fishing&rsquo;s been bad and Job can&rsquo;t earn enough to  keep things going? I make a trifle by my knitting, but that won&rsquo;t boil the pot.  And winter&rsquo;s approaching too. Oh, what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  glanced at Alice and handed a piece of paper to the speaker. &ldquo;Pay the rent with  that, and use what is over to buy food and coal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Trevel grasped the banknote, with a vivid spot of colour on each faded cheek,  and could scarcely speak in her excitement. &ldquo;What is it: oh, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  answer to your prayer,&rdquo; said Alice, rising and looking solemn.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  prayer! Why, it&rsquo;s a fifty-pound note. Oh, sir, I can&rsquo;t take such a large sum of  money from you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is not from me,&rdquo; said Montrose hastily. &ldquo;I am merely the instrument. God sends  the money because you asked Him to help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  tears fell down the worn old face. &ldquo;And I told the passon as it wasn&rsquo;t no use  praying,&rdquo; she moaned regretfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  you see it is. He takes His own time and means, but in the end every petition  receives the answer He deems best. Thank Him, Mrs. Trevel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  thank Him, and I thank you too, sir. Bless you, how the sight of this money do  set my mind at rest. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Job and the contrary ways of that silly  girl I&rsquo;d be as happy as an angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pray  for Job and Rose,&rdquo; advised Alice gently.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  it do seem worth it, dearie. If He sends me this, He may turn Rose into a  reasonable girl, which she isn&rsquo;t at present.&rdquo; Mrs. Trevel was about to put away  her treasure-trove when she hesitated. &ldquo;Should I take it, Miss Alice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  Of course you must take it. Mr. Montrose is rich and can well afford to give it  to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  the riches I have,&rdquo; said Douglas quietly, &ldquo;are but given to me as a steward of  Christ to dispense according to His will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He  did not say this priggishly, although to an ordinary man of the world such a  way of regarding wealth would seem priggish. Nine people out of ten would have  considered the speech as one made for effect, but Alice was the tenth and knew  the absolutely impersonal way in which her lover looked at the money. With  joyful tears Dame Trevel showered blessings on the young couple when they left  her house, and was a happy woman for the rest of the day. Even the prospect of  Rose&rsquo;s behaviour rousing Job&rsquo;s jealousy to the extent of leading to serious  trouble ceased to cause her anxiety for the moment. Angels had come and left  their gifts behind them. The old woman resolved to go to the vicarage and  confess with penitent tears that she had been wrong to doubt the efficacy of  prayer.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you really regard yourself as Christ&rsquo;s steward?&rdquo; asked Alice, when the two were  on their way to Julian&rsquo;s lodgings, more from curiosity than because she  doubted.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  I thought you knew me well enough to believe so, darling. Of course when you  are my wife I shall use the money to make us both comfortable, and we shall  have even the luxuries of life. But we must share our good fortune with less  fortunate people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  not sell all we have and give it to the poor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  suppose there comes a stage when one does that,&rdquo; mused Montrose, more to  himself than to the girl. &ldquo;But I have not yet reached that point. I know what  poverty is in its most sordid aspect, and I don&rsquo;t wish to undergo the  experience again. The most I can do is to share&mdash;&rdquo; he paused, then went on in a  doubtful manner: &ldquo;I expect the Blessed One knew that the young man who had  great possessions, to whom He said that, was a miser. He was perfect in all  ways, but he loved money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  Bible doesn&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; insisted Alice quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am reading between the lines, dear. And if Christ gives any one wealth to  administer as a steward, what would be the use of the steward nullifying his  office by getting rid at one sweep of what he has to administer? It&rsquo;s a hard  saying in any case, Alice. I must ask Eberstein what he thinks about the  matter. Besides, my dear&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated and closed his lips.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  asked the girl, curiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  answered Douglas, as Alice had answered on a previous occasion, but there was a  puzzled and rather pained look in his eyes as he spoke the word.</p>
  <p align="left">The  car was already standing at the door of Julian&rsquo;s lodgings and Julian himself  was already in the vehicle. While Montrose bundled in beside him, Alice stared  at the artist and laughed at his healthy looks, for he seemed to have entirely  recovered from his experience on the moors.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  a fraud you are, Julian, talking about your heart being weak,&rdquo; she said in a  jesting manner. &ldquo;You look big and strong and healthy. Your eyes are bright,  your colour is ruddy and you are the picture of a Samson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Julian  nodded gaily. &ldquo;I feel like a Samson to-day,&rdquo; he said, tucking the rug about his  companion&rsquo;s legs and his own. &ldquo;Sometimes, as at present, I could jump over the  moon. At other times you could knock me down with a feather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  strange,&rdquo; said the girl thoughtfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s  a queer animal,&rdquo; cried Douglas lightly, and waved his hand as the big car got  under way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back to-morrow, dear. Think of me!&rdquo; and he smiled at Miss  Enistor&rsquo;s bright face, little guessing what it would look like when he next set  eyes on its beauty.</p>
  <p align="left">Shortly  they were clear of the village and spinning along the winding levels towards  the watering-place. Julian, as Alice had noted, was full of life, and chatted a  great deal about this thing and that. Also he asked Montrose questions about  the teaching of Eberstein, since his curiosity had been aroused long since by  some of the apparently odd things which the young man said so simply and  serenely. It was not the first time that they had conversed on the subject of  reincarnation and its kindred associations. Julian was not prepared to accept  what he termed the theory of successive lives as gospel, and wanted physical  proof for super-physical knowledge. This, as Montrose assured him, was absurd.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When  you are able to leave your body consciously and enter into the Unseen World,  you will be given positive proof regarding the truth of Reincarnation and the  Law of Cause and Effect, which is termed Karma by Eastern teachers. But until  that time comes you must accept both laws on logical grounds, since they alone  explain without a flaw the riddles of life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can  you  leave your body consciously?&rdquo; asked the artist with scepticism.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  I shall some day, as Eberstein is training me. But you can&rsquo;t hurry the hour and  you can&rsquo;t delay the hour. You have just to wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  requires immense patience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Immense,&rdquo;  assented Douglas, &ldquo;but if you want a big thing you have to do big things to get  it. Only by living the life of Christ can you attain to the Christ-like powers.  Love, purity, unselfishness, serenity, kindness of thought and word and action:  these things arouse the latent faculties which, inherent in every man, enable  him to come into contact with other worlds. These are the laws of the Kingdom  of Heaven by which one acquires the powers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Julian  thought for a few moments. &ldquo;I had a talk with Narvaez the other day,&rdquo; he said  after a pause, &ldquo;and he offered to cast my horoscope. He seems, so far as I can  judge in my limited way, to have powers beyond the reach of the ordinary man.  Does he practise love and unselfishness and all the rest of the necessary  requirements?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  said Montrose decidedly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Narvaez is a good man, although I have  no positive reason to say that he is a bad one. But an evil man&mdash;I am not  speaking of Don Pablo, understand&mdash;can gain some of the power of the Kingdom by  sheer force of will. Christ says: &lsquo;He that entereth not by the door into the  sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber!&rsquo;  So those who get in otherwise than through Christ the Door of the sheep&mdash;the  door of love, that is&mdash;are the evil people who acquire super-physical powers by  strength of will, and make use of them selfishly. It is black magic to do that.  But those who follow the Master and enter through Him, as the Door, by living  the prescribed life to which I have referred, get the powers. But these use  them for the benefit of others and not to aggrandise themselves. That is white  magic.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  seems strange to use the word &lsquo;magic&rsquo; in connection with Christ.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  word has become polarised,&rdquo; said Montrose indifferently, &ldquo;you can call anything  that happens by working an unknown law of Nature &lsquo;a miracle,&rsquo; or &lsquo;a wonder,&rsquo; or  &lsquo;a magical performance.&rsquo; The one who performs such exceptional things, of  course, can exercise the unknown law I speak of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Christ,  being superhuman, could,&rdquo; argued Hardwick seriously, &ldquo;because He had wisdom  without measure. But the ordinary man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  the ordinary man loves Christ and keeps His commandments and walks in His  footsteps, he can gain knowledge of the power to work what are termed miracles.  The Master said so Himself, when His disciples marvelled at His doings, and  told them that if they followed Him they would do greater things. As you know,  some of the apostles did work miracles in His name. They learned by living the  life how to use the laws rightly, by means of the power of Love which came  through the Blessed One.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  appear to know a lot about these things, Montrose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed,  I know very little. Eberstein can give much, but I cannot take all he is  willing to give, because my understanding is yet limited. But everything will  come in time. I must wait patiently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This  interesting conversation was necessarily ended when the car reached Perchton,  and the young men parted for the time being. Douglas sought out the hotel where  Eberstein was staying, while Hardwick went in search of his doctor. The artist  arranged to meet Eberstein later, as Montrose was anxious he should do so, if  only to gain an answer to certain questions. The young man being a neophyte  could not explain much that Julian desired to know. But he was positive that  Eberstein could and would answer all questions, as he never withheld any  knowledge from a sincere inquirer.</p>
  <p align="left">In  a quiet hotel, high up on the cliffs, the doctor occupied a light and airy  sitting-room, delightfully peaceful and cheerful and bright. Through the  expansive windows could be seen the calm waters of the bay, with little  wavelets breaking on the crescent of yellow sand, and the tall white column of  the lighthouse shooting up from the reddish-hued rocks of the promontory.  Montrose, after early greetings had taken place, noted none of these things,  but flung himself into the nearest chair, feeling unaccountably weary.  Eberstein, who had welcomed his young friend in his usual sincere and kindly  manner, looked at him keenly, as he observed the boy&rsquo;s wilted appearance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  seem to be tired,&rdquo; he remarked gently.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  I am,&rdquo; admitted Montrose, with a perplexed expression. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I  should be, as I slept all right last night and came here in a comfortable  motor-car.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whom  did you come with?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  fellow called Hardwick, who is an artist. A really capital chap, who is a  first-rate friend. He got the car from some one he knows and gave me a lift.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  he ill?&rdquo; asked Eberstein, after a pause.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Strange  you should ask that. He isn&rsquo;t ill, and he isn&rsquo;t well; that is, he suffers from  a weak heart&mdash;not enough vitality. He is seeing a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  understand what?&rdquo; Montrose stared.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  you look tired. In quite an unconscious way, this Hardwick has been drawing the  vitality out of you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can  that be done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  yes! The weaker body frequently replenishes its life forces from any stronger  body that is at hand. You have heard it said how old age eats up youth. That is  a great truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;David  and Abishag,&rdquo; murmured Montrose wearily. Then he opened his eyes with an  astonished look. &ldquo;I am growing stronger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  smiled in an understanding manner. &ldquo;I am giving you strength, and strength you  will need very shortly, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  said in London that trouble was coming. But so far everything is all right.  Enistor is an extremely pleasant man, who quite approves of my marriage with  Alice. We get on capitally together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was  your first impression of him pleasant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  I disliked him no end when we first met. But as there was no reason for me to  do so I grew to like him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  said the doctor with a world of meaning, &ldquo;second thoughts are not always best.  Have you met the man who wanted to marry Alice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Narvaez?  Yes! He&rsquo;s a beast. I shall never get over my dislike for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  must not dislike him or any one,&rdquo; corrected Eberstein softly. &ldquo;Pity Narvaez and  pity Enistor, but be on your guard against both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  can they do?&rdquo; asked Montrose, with the disdainful confidence of youth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Enistor  can do nothing alone. Directed by Narvaez he can do much. And he will,&rdquo;  concluded the doctor with emphasis.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Does  the trouble you predicted come from that quarter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  it is two against two. Alice and I can fight her father and Narvaez.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be over-confident, or you will invite disaster,&rdquo; said the doctor dryly. &ldquo;There  is much doing of which you know nothing. That is why I am here to aid you, my  friend. I cannot do everything, as a great deal has to be done by you and Alice  with what intuition and strength you possess. With Alice the ordeal has already  commenced.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  started to his feet. &ldquo;Is she in danger?&rdquo; he asked excitedly. &ldquo;If so, I must go  back to Tremore at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no need. What she has to do must be done alone, and you would do her more  harm than good by going to her assistance. Hitherto I have protected her with  my strength, which has increased her own. Now for a certain time that strength  has been withdrawn. Narvaez will know the moment I cease to guard her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  will he do?&rdquo; demanded the young man, clenching his fists.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing  that physical strength can deal with, so don&rsquo;t get ready to fight, my friend.  Narvaez will not hurt the girl, but he will endeavour to learn from her  something he has long wished to know. It is necessary that he should know and  that his pupil should know also. Therefore, for a time he is permitted to work  his will. There! There! He will only make use of her clairvoyant powers, so she  will suffer little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want her to suffer at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Unless  she does in some degree, she will not progress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Narvaez  is such a beast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  He is only a man blinded by pride in his intellectual knowledge. You must pity  him for his blindness and do your best to help him. Hate only ceases when Love  is used to vanquish it. Calm yourself, Montrose. What must be must be if the  Will of God is to be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  wish you hadn&rsquo;t told me,&rdquo; cried the young man, greatly agitated.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is a weak thing to say. I told you purposely, so that you may develop faith and  patience. Can you not trust me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  Yes! Yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  show it by waiting quietly here until I tell you to return to Tremore, my  friend. This is the time of preparation to meet and baffle the trouble I warned  you against. Stand in the strength of Christ and not in your own strength. He  never fails those who trust in Him. To-morrow morning you must come with me to  early celebration. By partaking of the Body and Blood of The Blessed One&rdquo;&mdash;Eberstein  made the sign of the cross&mdash;&ldquo;you will gain the necessary strength to stand up  bravely against the Powers of Darkness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Narvaez?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  bowed his stately head. &ldquo;God pity him and save him,&rdquo; he murmured, with infinite  compassion.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XV"><b>Chapter XV</b></a><b><br>
    The Trance</b></h2>
  <p align="left">A  man on a suburban road at noonday, with the sun shining brilliantly, walks  along thinking of his private affairs and heedless of surroundings. But when  the toils of day are ended, and he proceeds along that same road in a darkness  scarcely illuminated by a few lamps, his feelings are less comfortable. Of  course much depends upon the man being sensitive or stolid, but in any case  this matters little in the present instance, as the illustration is merely used  to symbolise the mental state of Alice during the evening of her lover&rsquo;s  absence. One moment she was clothed in the radiance of perfect security and  peace; the next, and a dreadful gloom descended upon her bringing anguish and  distress. Naturally there was no physical change, but in some inexplicable way  she felt that an inward light was quenched. Alice had never read St. Teresa&rsquo;s &ldquo;Castles  of the Soul,&rdquo; or the explanations of that terrible saint would have given her  the key to her condition.</p>
  <p align="left">As  it was she felt as though the sun had fallen from the sky, and quailed in the  dense darkness pricked with feeble lights which now surrounded her. Little as  she knew it, those same lights represented the sum of what experience she had  gained with painful learning through many successive lives. The knowledge and  attainments of Eberstein, who had reached an infinitely higher level than  herself, beamed in that splendour which had been withdrawn. But what little  light she possessed and what greater light he had gained were only what each  could receive of The True Light &ldquo;which lighteth every man that cometh into the  world!&rdquo; Hitherto, Eberstein had given for her use what glory he had earned;  now&mdash;since the child must learn to walk alone if it ever hopes to come to  maturity&mdash;he had stood aside for the moment, so that she could make the attempt  with what strength she possessed. But Alice did not know all this, and could  only feel supremely wretched and forsaken.</p>
  <p align="left">So  listless did she feel that there was no energy in her to dress for dinner. For  two hours she sat in the drawing-room, already darkened by the early gloom of  the short autumnal day, longing to be in the haven of her lover&rsquo;s arms. Her  lonely soul cried aloud for human sympathy, for human protection, since the  higher love seemed to have withdrawn itself, and she put forth all the longing  of her being to call back Douglas to her side. But no answer came. The gloom  waxed denser, the silence became more oppressive, and all the girl could do was  to concentrate her mind on Christ and His saving grace. There was some comfort  to be got in murmuring that holy name over and over again. She felt as though  she were drowning in a bitterly salt sea under a leaden sky, and that  despairing trust in the Blessed One was the spar to which she clung in the hope  of rescue. And unprotected as she was for the moment, save by her intuitive faith,  she felt the evil forces of the house bear down upon her shuddering soul with  terrific weight. She little knew how these destroying influences were being  directed by a Brother of the Shadow, and as little did she guess that he would  be permitted to go so far and no farther. Knowledge of this state being a  necessary ordeal would have helped her to bear it; but the ignorance which made  her sufferings more acute was part of the ordeal itself. And silent, unseen,  motionless, the Powers of Good watched her endurance of the test.</p>
  <p align="left">In  the library Narvaez, in an extraordinary state of excitement for one so trained  to serenity, was conversing hurriedly with his pupil. He had come over a  quarter of an hour previously and was informing Enistor of the girl&rsquo;s defenceless  state. The Adversary had withdrawn his protection, as Don Pablo knew in some  mysterious way which he declined to explain to the Squire, so now was the time  to put forth the dark influence of evil and make use of the girl&rsquo;s clairvoyant  powers.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They  are untrained, it is true,&rdquo; said Narvaez, striving to be calm, since he knew  how much depended upon perfect self-control. &ldquo;But she is so pure and so  powerful in her purity that when I loosen her soul from the bonds of the flesh,  she will be able to reach that exalted plane where she can read the past  truthfully. Information will come through little coloured by her personality. I  assure you, Enistor, as in so young and innocent a girl, it is not yet  particularly strong. Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  the drawing-room! Moping in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah,  she feels the absence of her guardian, and is greatly bewildered. All the  better for our purpose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  are you going to manage?&rdquo; said the Squire anxiously. &ldquo;Alice hates you, and will  never submit to do anything for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez  sneered. &ldquo;But for The Adversary, I should have dominated her long ago without  difficulty. Now that the protection has been withdrawn she is quite at the  mercy of my superior knowledge and power. She can never oppose her will to  mine, as she is ignorant and I am wise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t hurt her,&rdquo; said Enistor uneasily, and silently astonished with himself  for giving way to such a kindly human feeling.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  Of course I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted the other impatiently. &ldquo;I shall send her to find  out what we want, and then recall her. Why she is unsupported now I cannot  learn; but certainly for the moment she has been left to walk alone. This is  our hour, Enistor, so let us make the best of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  do you intend to act?&rdquo; questioned the father tensely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Place  that arm-chair in the middle of the room: put the lamp behind yonder screen. I  shall sit here by the window where she cannot see me: you take up your position  near the fire. Give me a saucer, a plate, a vase&mdash;anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  Squire obeyed these directions and sat down as instructed to watch the doings  of Don Pablo. That gentleman, taking a red-hot coal from the fire, dropped it  on a bronze saucer of Indian workmanship which Enistor had selected from  amongst the ornaments on the mantelpiece. Placing this on a small table which stood  near the central chair, Narvaez shook over the burning coal some special  incense which he carried in a tiny golden box. At once a thick white smoke  fumed upward, and the room was filled gradually with a stupefying fragrance.  With the lamp behind the Chinese screen, the apartment was only faintly  illuminated by the red glow of the fire, which smouldered without flames in the  grate. The Spaniard moved about with an activity surprising in a man of his  years, and when he had completed his preparations retreated into the darkness  near the heavily curtained window. Thence his voice came low, clear and  piercing to the Squire.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am putting out my power to draw her here. Tell her when she comes to sit in the  arm-chair yonder. My influence and the scent of the incense will bring about  the separation of the bodies, and she will go to the appointed place. You ask  the questions, as my voice may move her to rebellion. Keep your brain passive  and I will impress upon you what I wish to ask. You have been already trained to  be receptive in this way, so you know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  breathed Enistor, sitting well back in his chair and fixing his eyes on the  library door, dimly seen in the reddish glow of the fire.</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez  did not waste time in replying, but the Squire felt that he was now radiating a  tremendous influence, which seemed to extend beyond the walls of the library  and throughout the entire house. Shortly, swift unhesitating footsteps were  heard, and Alice simply raced into the room, so speedily did she respond to the  call. She had all her waking senses about her, and was puzzled to understand  the impulse which had sent her headlong in search of her father.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you want me?&rdquo; she asked, with quick laboured breathing, for the oppression of  the room was terrible. &ldquo;Why are you in the dark? What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  want to talk to you about Montrose,&rdquo; said Enistor softly. &ldquo;Sit down in that  arm-chair over there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About  Douglas!&rdquo; Alice, with a weary sigh, dropped into the central chair, near the  table where the incense curled upward in faint grey spirals, not discernible in  the half-light. A whiff of the scent made the girl drowsy, and closing her  eyes, she rested her head on the back of the chair. The action brought her face  nearer to the bronze dish, and with the next breath she inhaled a lung-ful of  the burning perfume. With a choking sensation she strove to open her eyes and  lean forward, but her body would not obey her will, and she rested, inert and  powerless, where she was. There was a momentary struggle between spirit and  matter, a sick sensation of loosened bonds, and then she found herself standing  upright gazing at her motionless body lying in the chair. It was alive and  breathing, for she saw the rise and fall of the breast, but she, in a similar  body, stood apart from her physical vehicle, distinct, and&mdash;so far as she  knew&mdash;unattached. Before she had time to grasp the situation, the library  vanished, and she was environed by a restless atmosphere of colour. It was as  if she was clothed with the splendour of sunset, for there was no hard-and-fast  outline; no visible form: all was cloud and colour, materials waiting to be  shaped by the will into something which the soul desired. The silence was like  a benediction of peace. &ldquo;Higher! Higher!&rdquo; said the far-away voice of her  father. &ldquo;Seek out the past where it is to be found. See yourself and those you  know, in other times, in other climes, in other flesh.&rdquo; There was a pause, and  then came the telephonic voice again, repeating the orders of Narvaez. &ldquo;Use for  the past the names by which you and those you know are called to-day. Higher!  Higher!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  again felt that struggle of spirit and matter, and&mdash;no longer afraid as she had  been&mdash;passed out of her second body to become conscious in a third one. Now, as  she knew intuitively, she moved in the sphere of Tone, and everywhere rainbow  light spoke in music, though still she wandered in a cloudy atmosphere as in  the heart of a many-hued opal. Wave after wave of murmuring light rolled over  her, but there was no horizon, no boundaries, no up or down. She was in a  dimension about which, as Alice Enistor, she knew nothing. But her eternal Self  knew that the place was familiar, as she&mdash;having stepped behind two veils of  matter&mdash;knew the Eternal Self.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Seek  out the Book of Time,&rdquo; commanded the thin voice which directed her doings, and  ghost of a sound as it was, it penetrated to her through the choral harmonies  of the glorious music.</p>
  <p align="left">In  a moment everything as it were became solid, and she felt that she had dropped  again to the earth. Clothed in a larger and more majestic body than that she  wore as Alice Enistor, she moved amidst familiar surroundings, knowing the  landscape she moved through and the people whom she found herself amongst. Then  she was aware that she was still on a higher plane and had travelled in time  through five thousand years to re-live for the moment an incarnation of the  past. The Book of Time, as she dimly sensed it, was not a book, as the physical  brain knows a book, but a state of consciousness. At this moment, when the rainbow  had vanished and the music had ceased, and&mdash;as it might be&mdash;she was living  amongst the living, her father&rsquo;s voice came for the third time.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  do you see? What do you do? Who are you, and who are those you mingle with?  Speak!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">So  she was not entirely detached from her body of Alice Enistor after all, since a  thin thread of light ran from where she was to where she had been when starting  on the journey. Down that thread of light&mdash;so it seemed&mdash;she sent her voice:  telegraphed, or telephoned, all that her father wished to know. The necessary  goal had been reached, the necessary communication between the mental and  physical planes had been established, and she proceeded to reply, compelled by  some unknown influence which forced her to speak.</p>
  <p align="left">In  the library Narvaez wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead, and sighed  heavily with the efforts he had made to bring things to this point. But he did  not speak with his own tongue, lest the sound of his voice should reach the  girl in those far-off regions and make her rebellious. Silently he impressed  his desires upon Enistor, and softly Enistor voiced those same desires, while  he looked at the motionless figure of his daughter reclining in the deep  arm-chair.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  do you see?&rdquo; asked Enistor, scarcely moving his lips, and in a thin silvery  utterance, soft as a summer breeze, came the answer:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am looking on Chaldea, far back in the deeps of time. No&mdash;not looking: I am  living in Chaldea, as the priestess of a great Star-Angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  name of the Star-Angel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  would call Him, Mars, although He has a different name in Chaldea. He is the  Planetary Spirit of Mars, and I serve in His temple. The Chaldeans worship the  Host of Heaven, as manifestations of the Logos, whose visible symbol is the  Sun. The Star-Angels of the seven planets are the seven Spirits before the  Throne, mentioned in the Book of Revelation. The Logos is not the Absolute God  from Whom emanated the Universes, but the Being whose Body and Creation is the  Solar System. He is the only God our consciousness can conceive. He is the One  of this creation manifesting Himself in the many: we are the many ever striving  to return to Him, by learning through experience how voluntarily to choose good  instead of evil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  the Chaldeans worship the Stars themselves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  They worship the Angels of the Stars: the power inherent in each planet which  emanates from the mightier Power of the Sun-Logos. And His Power emanates from  the Absolute God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Has  each Angel a temple?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  And the Logos has a Temple also. These are all placed on a wide plain in a  fashion symbolising the Solar System: like an orrery. One collection of temples  stands on one plain, another on another plain, and so on throughout Chaldea. On  this plain where I live there is the great Temple of the Sun and near it the  Temple of Vulcan; next that of Mercury, then that of Venus, until the last  temple far away in the distance is dedicated to Neptune. The situations of the  temples are reckoned to scale, and represent our System.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  there a Temple to the Earth-Angel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  There is one to the Moon-Angel, and near it a small dome of black marble  typifying the Earth. But it is not a shrine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are a priestess in the Temple of Mars?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  I wear a brilliant scarlet dress. The priestesses of Venus are in sky blue, and  those of the Moon are clothed in silver, while the priests of the Sun wear  cloth of gold. Each Star-Angel has His particular colour, and each is  worshipped in His own shrine. On great festivals all meet in the great  Sun-Temple to worship the Logos.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There  was a restless movement in Don Pablo&rsquo;s corner. Enistor, overwhelmed with  curiosity, was asking questions on his own account, thereby irritating his  master, who wished for more intimate information. A twist of pain brought  Enistor to his senses, and he hastily submitted his will to that of Narvaez.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you see me?&rdquo; was the next question asked, as instructed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  You are the High Priest of Mars: a big fat man like a Chinaman, with a rather  cruel face. All the Chaldeans are like Chinese with yellow skins and oblong  eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps  they are Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  No. They are Turanians, the ancestors of the Mongolians. I am of the Aryan  race, and I don&rsquo;t like the Turanians, who are brutal and lawless. Perhaps that  is why you are so cruel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Am  I cruel? Why am I cruel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  like power, and desire to see every one at your feet. I am a vestal of the  temple gifted with clairvoyance, and you use me to foresee the future and learn  about other spheres. All this knowledge you turn to your own advantage. Oh, you  are wicked. You really don&rsquo;t worship the Star-Angel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whom  or What do I worship then?&rdquo; asked Enistor, again breaking away from Don Pablo&rsquo;s  guidance, as the picture drawn by the clairvoyante did not please him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  Powers of Darkness: the Elemental Powers. Sometimes you steal away from the  Temple after dark to see a very evil man, who is teaching you how to get power  in a wrong way, through offering blood sacrifices.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who  is the man?&rdquo; questioned Enistor, still using his own will, in spite of signals  from Narvaez.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is Don Pablo now. Then he was an Atlantean magician: one of the Lords of the  Dark Face. You are his pupil, or rather his slave. He uses your intellect to  make himself more powerful. There is some good in you, however, and you try to  break away every now and then, but the chains that bind you are too strong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For  the first time Don Pablo spoke in a quietly enraged tone. &ldquo;Stop asking  questions on your own account, or I shall hurt you, Enistor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">A  shiver passed through the body in the chair, as if that hated voice had  penetrated even to where Alice was, and had recalled the detestation in which  she held the speaker. Enistor was minded to rebel, but he swiftly considered  that if he did so at the moment, he might break the spell, and then would not learn  about the threatened danger. Therefore, he was obedient and set himself to obey  his evil master. Narvaez became quiet again, and through his instrument asked  another question.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you live in the Temple of Mars?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  along with other vestals. But none of them possess such great clairvoyant  powers as I do, and that is why I am valuable to you. But you use my powers for  bad purposes and I hate you. Behind you there is Don Pablo, with his dark  designs, but I am supported,&rdquo; her voice took on a note of triumph, &ldquo;I am  supported by a good man, who is a priest of the Sun. He works for good, and is  trying to take me away from your influence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is The Adversary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know whom you mean by The Adversary. But he is now Dr. Eberstein. Oh, and  I see Douglas. He is a Chaldean noble and he loves me. He wants to carry me  away from the Temple and from you, as you are killing me with the demands you  are making on my powers of clairvoyance. I love Douglas: I want to run away  with him. But he is hot-headed and foolish and will not take me away quietly.  Dr. Eberstein tells him, when he goes to the Sun-Temple, that if he waits  everything will come out right. But Douglas will not wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you see Hardwick?&rdquo; asked Narvaez, through Enistor&rsquo;s tongue.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is an old beggar-man who sits outside the Temple. I give him alms every day and  speak kindly to him. That is why he is so willing to help me now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Does  Douglas carry you away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There  was a pause, and then the voice of the girl came sweet and clear: &ldquo;I am in the  Sun-Temple. It is a great festival. All the worshippers of the various  Star-Angels are there in the dress and colour appointed to each. The Temple is  built in the form of a cross with a hemispherical dome where the arms of the  cross meet. It is something like St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. But between the arms of  the cross are passages leading to vast halls, so the plan is different. In the  east arm of the cross there is an altar to the Sun, and the west arm contains  an altar to the Moon. The great northern altar is for the whole Solar System, I  think. The worship now is at this altar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  is the worship?&rdquo; asked Enistor, to Narvaez&rsquo; unspeakable annoyance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is night, and along the roof of the northern arm of the cross there is a slit  through which the stars shine. Mars is being worshipped, and his ruddy light  shines through the slit on to a large silver mirror&mdash;I think it is silver, but I  am not sure. It is concave. Beneath it is a brazier on which I am throwing  incense. The priests and priestesses are singing and the worshippers are bowing  their heads, as the Star gleams from the mirror through the grey smoke of the  incense. And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have  done with all this nonsense,&rdquo; said Narvaez angrily, in his own voice. &ldquo;Tell me  about the carrying away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  body in the chair shivered again, but the soul was obedient to the powerful  influence. &ldquo;Douglas is there with many of his slaves. Towards the end of the  service, he breaks through the crowd of priests and takes me up in his arms.  The priests try to stop him, but many are struck down. There is a great tumult.  You, father, as the High Priest of Mars, thrust at Douglas with a spear  snatched from one of the slaves. Douglas lets me down for a moment, as I have  fainted, and stabs at you with a knife. Oh,&rdquo; the voice shook with horror, &ldquo;he  has stabbed you in the throat. You fall and die, cursing him. I see Douglas  carrying me away. Don Pablo is running beside him. He is drawing the life from  me, and Dr. Eberstein is looking on sadly. He can do nothing: he can do  nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; demanded Narvaez harshly, and now careless of using Enistor as his  instrument.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  owe you a life. I fell into your power when you were a magician in Atlantis&mdash;in  the City of the Golden Gates. You have a right to take my life, or to forgive  me, as I killed you centuries before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  I did not forgive you. I never intend to forgive you,&rdquo; said Narvaez grimly. &ldquo;You  were mine then and suffered: you shall be mine again and pay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never!  Never! By taking my life in Chaldea you lost your power. I was reborn free from  your influence of the past, and you have tried again and again to get me once  more under your spell. But Dr. Eberstein guards me. He will save me from you  this time, as he has saved me before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared the Spaniard savagely. &ldquo;You shall marry me and again become my  slave to use your powers for my benefit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall not marry you. I paid my debt of the past in Chaldea when you killed me.  Douglas carried me safely away and then found that I was dead: you drew the  life out of me in revenge for what I did to you in Atlantis. Douglas would have  been killed for his sacrilege, but Dr. Eberstein as his friend, the Priest of  the Sun, helped him to escape from Chaldea. Douglas became a hermit and died  very penitent. Dr. Eberstein told him that he had lost me for thousands of  years through his hot-headed haste, but that we would come together again when  the past was expiated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  it is not,&rdquo; cried Don Pablo triumphantly. &ldquo;Montrose owes Enistor a life. To pay  that he must give his own life: he is at your father&rsquo;s mercy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Douglas  will pay the debt, but not in the way you wish him to pay it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Enistor  will enforce payment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said the Squire, his eyes glittering. &ldquo;Now I know why I hated him the moment we  met. He killed me in Chaldea: he has robbed me in England; I shall demand the  payment of both debts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  feel the evil forces that are working in you both,&rdquo; said Alice wearily, &ldquo;and  they hurt me. The book is closed: do let me come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Stay  where you are and search out the future,&rdquo; commanded Narvaez, with a snarl of  fierce command. &ldquo;Search.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  cannot see the future. It is on a higher plane where past and present are one,&rdquo;  came the thin, tired voice, for the girl was becoming exhausted physically with  the long-continued strain.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go  to the higher plane: you can do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Something  stops me. There is a barrier I cannot pass. You are not permitted to know.  Father and I and Douglas have to work out by our knowledge in the flesh the  drama begun in Chaldea. This much is allowed: no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  the danger which threatens me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  are black clouds: red clouds: wicked clouds. You are cutting yourself off from  the Life of God: you are isolating yourself from creation. You want to drag my  father with you, out of space, out of Time, out of the arms of God. Oh, it is  too terrible: it is too terrible. Let me return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;See  the future,&rdquo; shouted Narvaez, defiant as Satan in his isolating pride.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  cannot: I dare not: I will not. I call upon Christ for help. Save me from this  wicked being, O Power of Love. Deliver me from evil, Our Father who art in  Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">What  happened at the moment Enistor never quite knew. He saw Narvaez advance to the  middle of the room, looking powerful and making defiant gestures of insane  pride. Then all the strength seemed to leave him, and he dropped on the floor  like a stone, becoming motionless and powerless, a mere mass of evil matter  uncontrolled by his wicked will. At the same time Alice stirred, sighed, opened  her eyes and looked through the dim lights to where her father gripped the  mantelpiece appalled at the conquest of his dark master by some invisible power  he could neither hear, nor see, nor feel.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  wish to speak to me about Douglas, father?&rdquo; asked Alice languidly, and taking  up her life at the point it had ceased when Narvaez laid his wicked spell upon  her. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she rose with a gesture of repulsion as she saw the prostrate form. &ldquo;Don  Pablo. I would not have come if I had known he was here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is all right, Alice,&rdquo; said Enistor, recovering his will-power and speech. &ldquo;He  only came a short time ago, and withdrew into the shadow while I spoke to you  about Douglas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  I didn&rsquo;t see him fall. I didn&rsquo;t hear him fall!&rdquo; stammered the girl.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  perfume made you faint for the moment,&rdquo; said the Squire, taking the lamp from  behind the screen. &ldquo;We must postpone our talk, Alice, as the heat of the room  has made Narvaez faint. Go to bed. I shall attend to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo;  said the girl, without arguing, and touching her father&rsquo;s lips with her own she  went away. The hour of darkness had passed, and though she felt languid&mdash;with  the strain she supposed that she had endured in the drawing-room&mdash;yet the light  had returned and she felt safe.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor,  left alone, touched the old man, wondering how he would be able to revive him,  as this was no ordinary faint. But the moment Alice left the room Narvaez sat  up, apparently his usual self.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did  The Adversary strike you down?&rdquo; asked the Squire, still pale and unstrung.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  It was One I do not choose to name. But I defy Him! I defy Him!&rdquo; He shook his  fists in the air with impotent anger. &ldquo;I shall win yet! I shall win yet!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XVI"><b>Chapter XVI</b></a><b><br>
    The Disciple Of Love</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Next  day at noon, Montrose returned to Tremore accompanied by the doctor, to be  received by the housekeeper, as Mr. Enistor had gone to see Se&ntilde;or Narvaez, and  Alice was still in bed. Knowing from Eberstein that the girl had been submitted  to an ordeal, Douglas anxiously demanded if she was ill. But, much to his  relief, the answer immediately reassured him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ill,  sir? No, sir,&rdquo; responded the housekeeper, who was a voluble talker, &ldquo;though she  did go to bed early last night with no dinner and only a glass of milk to keep  her up, which isn&rsquo;t enough nourishment for a young thing like Miss Alice. But  she was sleeping so lovely that the master said she had better sleep on. But I  think she is getting up now, sir, and when she knows that you are here, sir&mdash;&rdquo;  the housekeeper looked significantly at the young man and departed smiling,  with her sentence uncompleted. She was an old and valued servant, who quite  approved of the match.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are sure Alice hasn&rsquo;t suffered?&rdquo; demanded Montrose for the twentieth time, and  prowling restlessly about the drawing-room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing  to speak of,&rdquo; answered the doctor serenely, explaining himself as he would have  done to a child. &ldquo;Narvaez and his pupil were permitted to go so far and no  farther. They have learned what they wished to know, and I hope the knowledge  will do them both good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  is the knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no need for you to know at present, my friend. You saw what you did see in  my London house, and with that you must be content to work out your present  Destiny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  it is a case of Destiny I am helpless, doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think not. Certain things must happen because you put certain forces into  action five thousand years ago. But such events will work out for good or bad,  as you apply the Law of Love or the Law of Hate. Man makes his own Karma, but  he can modify the same to a certain extent by using his will-power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  sighed. &ldquo;I am so much in the dark, I don&rsquo;t know how to act.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  will know how to act when the time comes, if you are true to the teaching of  Christ,&rdquo; said Eberstein gently.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  if you would only advise me what to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  that case you would only gain the Karma of obedience: good in itself, but less  than is demanded. Your future has to do at the moment with Alice and her father  and Narvaez, but if I told you the precise reasons why you have come together,  you would be hampered in your actions. Watch and pray, my friend, and abide by  the Law of Love. Then you will receive the guidance of the Blessed One, who is  building up Himself within you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall do my best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is all that is asked of you and of any one. If a man acts up to the highest  ideal he can conceive, nothing more is demanded. And one word of warning,  Montrose. Alice is quite ignorant of the use made of her clairvoyant powers  last night. Therefore do not ask indiscreet questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you mean to say that she does not know what she told Narvaez and her father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  she does not. Ignorance is as necessary for her as for you at present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  objected. &ldquo;If you would only point out the pitfalls to both of us, doctor, we  might avoid them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;These  same pitfalls are the creation of your own free-will, and of your own free-will  you must avoid them,&rdquo; said Eberstein decisively. &ldquo;Only experience will teach  the necessary lesson which has to be learned, and by making yourself receptive  to the Eternal Ego you can always gain the guidance of the Great One, who works  through that same Ego.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  young man sighed again, for this epigrammatic teaching was so difficult and&mdash;to  him&mdash;so involved that he wondered why Eberstein did not speak plainly and have  done with it. Walking to the window and looking out at the dark woodland a  stone&rsquo;s-throw away, where the trees were being tormented by a blustering wind,  he pondered over the problem, but could find no answer thereto. After a pause,  Eberstein advanced and laid a kind hand on his shoulder, reading his thoughts  and pitying his perplexity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Our  teaching is meant to stimulate the mind,&rdquo; he said impressively. &ldquo;Therefore  hints are given rather than full explanations, and the pupil has to use his  brains to expand those hints into the necessary knowledge. In this way he  progresses, as what he gains by this system of instruction is thoroughly  learned, which would not be the case if his path were made easier.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think Christ taught in the way you mention,&rdquo; mused Montrose. &ldquo;I remember how  many of His sayings puzzled me&mdash;and for the matter of that still do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  nodded. &ldquo;Regarding earthly things He spoke plainly, as in the case of giving  tribute to C&aelig;sar, because people could understand. But as they were unable to  comprehend heavenly things the Blessed One could only instruct them in  parables, and give hints. By doing this last He roused those He spoke to into  puzzling out the meaning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Give  me an example.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  Four Gospels are filled with examples. To take one instance. When the people  asked: &lsquo;Who is this Son of Man?&rsquo; Jesus replied, &lsquo;Yet a little while is the  light with you!&rsquo; If the people could have connected the saying about the Light  of the World with this speech, they would have grasped the fact that He spoke  of Himself. He was the Son of Man: He was the Light of the World. But,&rdquo; quoted  Eberstein sadly from St. John&rsquo;s Gospel, &ldquo;though He had done so many miracles  before them, yet they believed not on Him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Before  Montrose could comment on this speech, Alice entered the room and flew like a  homing bird to her nest in his arms. She looked weak and very pale, with dark  circles under her eyes, and had a general appearance of debility. For the  moment she did not notice the doctor, but could only weep on her lover&rsquo;s  breast. Mindful that he was not to ask indiscreet questions, Douglas could only  smooth her hair and whisper comfortable endearments. After a time, Alice  responded to this gentle treatment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am so glad you have come, Douglas,&rdquo; she faltered wearily. &ldquo;Last night I had two  hours of great suffering in this very room. I felt as though all light were  withdrawn and just as if I had fallen into an Abyss of Darkness. Then I heard,  or fancied I heard, my father calling for me and went into the library, where  he was sitting almost in the dark. He said that he wanted to speak about you.  But I saw Se&ntilde;or Narvaez lying on the floor, and refused to stay. I went to bed  and slept for hours and hours. I have just got up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  was Se&ntilde;or Narvaez lying on the floor?&rdquo; asked Eberstein quietly, and more to set  her at her ease than because he wished for a reply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  doctor, how are you? I am so glad you have come. Don&rsquo;t think me rude not saying  anything. I feel so upset. My father said that Se&ntilde;or Narvaez had fainted with  the heat of the room. It was hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  long were you in the library?&rdquo; asked Douglas with anxiety.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only  a few moments. I could not bear to stay where Se&ntilde;or Narvaez was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  glanced significantly at Montrose to draw attention to the fact that Alice was  quite unaware of the flight of time when undergoing her ordeal. Then he asked  her to sit down and spoke gently as he took her two hands within his own. &ldquo;You  said that you were in darkness. That is not the case now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  it isn&rsquo;t, doctor. The feeling of light came back when I went to bed, and I did  not feel so miserable. I was glad to sleep. And yet,&rdquo; Alice looked at the two  men in a bewildered manner, &ldquo;the rest doesn&rsquo;t seem to have done me any good. I  feel as if I had walked miles. Do you think that what I suffered from the  darkness last night has exhausted me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  replied Eberstein quietly. &ldquo;That was the hour of your Gethsemane. Now you are  feeling better: the light is around you again: the life-forces are rebuilding  your strength. Look into my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Instinctively  obedient, Alice did so. Already through the doctor&rsquo;s hands she felt a warm  current passing up her arms and into her body, but when she met his steady grey  eyes the magnetism of the life-power he was giving her tingled throughout her  entire frame. The brightness returned to her eyes, the colour of health flushed  her cheeks: her nerves ceased to thrill with pain, and her muscles grew strong.  In silent astonishment Montrose looked at the rapid transformation which was  taking place under his eyes. From a colourless statue, the girl warmed into  rosy life, and when Eberstein dropped her hands she sprang to her feet to stand  in the shaft of sunlight which had broken through the heavy clouds of the  autumnal day.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I feel that I have been born again to a more splendid life,&rdquo; she cried in  ecstasy, and looked as though she were transfigured, which certainly was the  case. &ldquo;Oh, thank you, doctor: thank you: thank you. How did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  How did you do it?&rdquo; asked Douglas, also intensely curious.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  suppose you would call it a case of hypnotic suggestion,&rdquo; smiled Eberstein,  putting his explanation in simple words which they could understand. &ldquo;I have  stimulated Alice&rsquo;s will to command the inflowing of the life-currents from the  vital body into the physical, and have added a trifle of my own strength, which  I can well spare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is wonderful: wonderful,&rdquo; cried Alice, radiant with unusual life, and smiling  like the goddess of spring.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;All  things are wonderful, because all things are God. He manifests in the many.  Thank Him, my child!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  was silent for a moment and breathed an inward prayer of profound gratitude,  which was echoed in the thoughts of her lover. Then she descended to earth and  apologised for the absence of her father. &ldquo;He went to see if Don Pablo was  better, and will be back to luncheon. That was the message he sent up to my  room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  quite understand,&rdquo; said Eberstein, nodding gravely. &ldquo;Of course Don Pablo is an  old man, and has not much strength.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  could give it to him,&rdquo; said Alice, rejoicing in her glorious vitality.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  could but cannot, because Don Pablo would refuse to accept help from me, and I  could but will not, because he would turn such strength to an evil purpose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  nodded and shivered. &ldquo;He is not a good man. I hate him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  must pity him. He is not good, it is true, but that is because he is dominated  by his lower self. For him as for all men God has nothing but everlasting love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  he is my enemy,&rdquo; remonstrated the girl, perplexed. &ldquo;I feel that he is my enemy,  doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  of that? Does not the Great Master tell us to love our enemies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  that standard is impossible to reach,&rdquo; said Montrose quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  you act in your own strength it is. But all things are possible with God, and  only in His strength do we conquer. Do not think of Narvaez as bad, for by  doing so your angry thoughts add to the burden of evil he bears. Send thoughts  of love and pity to refresh his struggling soul, which the animal forces are  striving to overwhelm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am sorry for him in one way,&rdquo; murmured Alice. &ldquo;At least I think that I am  sorry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have every reason to be, but I don&rsquo;t think you truly are,&rdquo; said Eberstein  dryly. &ldquo;Because you read the letter of the commandment and do not comprehend  the spirit. I cannot very well explain either to you or to Montrose, as your  limitations are yet great. But I ask you both to pity the man and to hope that  he may grow better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I shall do that,&rdquo; said Douglas readily. &ldquo;There is great room for improvement,  isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  Narvaez, as in you, and in Alice, and in Enistor. Who can afford to throw a  stone at any one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  flushed a trifle at the implied rebuke, but never dreamed of defending himself,  as he looked upon the doctor as an oracle to be listened to and obeyed with all  reverence. Eberstein smiled approvingly when he noted how the young man curbed  both thought and word, then changed the subject by commenting on the impressive  looks of the house and its commanding situation. Alice was gratified to hear  Tremore praised, but hinted at the uncomfortable atmosphere of the place.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  always feel as though I were battling against depression here, doctor. The  rooms and furniture are both so sombre.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Every  house has its own psychic atmosphere, which comes from the sayings and doings  of those who live in it,&rdquo; explained the visitor. &ldquo;I cannot say that the  influence of this beautiful place tends to calm the spirit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  agreed. &ldquo;When I first came here I felt that it was a kind of battle-ground,  full of tumult and war.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  so it is. Invisible forces of good and evil strive here continuously as I can  feel. You sense them also, Alice, as you are more or less clairvoyant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  I know,&rdquo; admitted the girl, with a nervous glance round the room. &ldquo;And the evil  is stronger than the good, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At  present that is the case. But we must change the conditions and make this house  a centre of holy power to bless instead of curse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  will have to keep Narvaez out of the place then,&rdquo; observed Douglas abruptly. &ldquo;And  that will be difficult, as he is a friend of the Squire&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Quite  so,&rdquo; said Eberstein calmly. &ldquo;I came here to aid Mr. Enistor, as well as to help  you and Alice. He is being wrongly guided by Narvaez.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As  if the mention of his name had evoked his presence, the Squire made his  appearance unexpectedly. He did not look pleased, as Don Pablo had refused to  see him, for the first time during their acquaintanceship. Enistor therefore  returned in a somewhat gloomy frame of mind, but smoothed his brow and assumed  his company manners when he greeted the doctor. He knew well enough that his  guest was &ldquo;The Adversary&rdquo; so often mentioned by Narvaez, but knew also how the  Law of Love which Eberstein obeyed prevented hostile treatment. He therefore  felt safe and indeed rather contemptuous, since he was unfettered by scruples  himself, and did not care what means he employed against the aims of the  doctor, whatever they might be. Yet the downfall of Narvaez on the previous  night should have warned him against over-confidence, and would have done so  had not the man been so besotted with intellectual pride. Eberstein knew of  this Satanic attitude, but gave no sign of his knowledge beyond a pitying  glance at Enistor&rsquo;s powerful face when they shook hands.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have a beautiful place here,&rdquo; he remarked lightly. &ldquo;I was just admiring the  position when you came in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is well enough, but a trifle lonely,&rdquo; said the Squire rather ungraciously. &ldquo;Still,  I can amuse you by showing our family treasures, which are many. How do you  feel, Alice?&rdquo; he asked, turning abruptly to his daughter, and anxiously  wondering if she was aware of the information she had given on the previous  night. &ldquo;I hope you are better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I am quite well now, father. Dr. Eberstein has done me good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have an excellent bedside manner,&rdquo; interposed Eberstein quickly, as he did not  wish Alice to explain too much. &ldquo;And I have cheered up Miss Enistor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is well. She had a fit of the blues last night, and would not listen to what I  had to say to her in the library.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or  Narvaez was there and he always makes me uncomfortable,&rdquo; protested the girl in  a troubled way.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are full of fancies, Alice,&rdquo; retorted Enistor in an acid tone. &ldquo;And as Narvaez  had fainted you might have remained to help me. However, it was just as well  you retired to bed and slept for such a long time, as you were not quite  yourself last night. Well,&rdquo; he added with an assumption of benevolence, &ldquo;as  Montrose was away from you, it was natural you should feel dismal. Ah, these  young men, doctor: they steal the hearts of our children.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  exhibit no shame in doing so,&rdquo; said Eberstein humorously. &ldquo;Cupid was ever a  robber, Mr. Enistor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Then  the gong thundered an invitation to luncheon, which proved to be a truly  delightful meal. Alice, with her recovered strength, was filled with the joy of  life, and Douglas, seeing her in such good spirits, was very merry in his turn.  As to the doctor, he made himself so entertaining in talking of all that was  going on in the great world that Enistor unbent considerably, and silently  acknowledged that The Adversary was better company than Narvaez. By the end of  the meal, both Squire and doctor were on the best of terms. Not for many a long  day had such gaiety reigned at Tremore.</p>
  <p align="left">After  luncheon Alice and Douglas stole away after the fashion of lovers who desire  solitude to express their feelings freely. Enistor was left alone to entertain  his guest, and conducted the doctor to the library, to show him certain  black-letter folios which were of great antiquity and great value. Eberstein,  charmed with the treasures of the library and with the spacious room, revealed  himself to be no mean judge of books and furniture and ancient manuscripts.  More than ever Enistor felt that this debonair gentleman was not to be feared  and became uncommonly friendly with him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  wish you would come and stay here for a week, doctor,&rdquo; he said impulsively. &ldquo;It  is such a pleasure to meet any one so well read and well informed on all  subjects as you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  flatter me,&rdquo; responded the doctor cordially. &ldquo;I should be delighted to accept  your invitation, and may do at a later date. Meanwhile, I have business which  detains me in Perchton for a short time. But you have the society of Se&ntilde;or  Narvaez,&rdquo; he added, with a keen glance. &ldquo;And I hear from Mr. Hardwick, whom I  met yesterday, that he is most entertaining.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hardly  the word to be used,&rdquo; said Enistor composedly, and wondering why the reference  was made. &ldquo;He is learned and serious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see why learning need necessarily involve seriousness. Knowledge should  make one happy, and happiness shows itself in gaiety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor,  fidgeting with a parchment, frowned. &ldquo;Do you think that knowledge should make  one happy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  not, if the knowledge be rightly applied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  what way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To  help others less learned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  should it be?&rdquo; demanded Enistor defiantly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  should it not be?&rdquo; countered the doctor swiftly. &ldquo;What is the use of hiding one&rsquo;s  light under a bushel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is a strange sentiment from you, doctor. It implies vanity, as if you wished  others to see and envy your light. Well, I suppose that would be a source of  gratification to any one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is but a narrow mind that finds gratification in possessing what another person  lacks. You will find the explanation of my real meaning in saying what  surprises you in the text: &lsquo;Let your light so shine before men that they may  see your good works and glorify your Father which is in heaven.&rsquo; It is the  Father who does the works, and the Father therefore should surely receive the  praise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who  is the Father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  the greater sense God, in the minor degree The Ego, which is a part of God.  Through the minor power the greater power works, and to Him be the glory, Mr.  Enistor. I daresay you know something of these things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know a great deal,&rdquo; said the Squire in a proud tone, &ldquo;but I do not interpret  them as you do. If I do anything I take the praise to myself. It is I who do  it, not this Father, big or little, you talk about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  quoted solemnly: &ldquo;Thou couldst have no power at all against Me, except it were  given thee from above.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is from the Bible, I take it,&rdquo; said Enistor scornfully. &ldquo;Well, you see, I don&rsquo;t  believe in the Bible. It is a series of old documents filled with  contradictions and mistakes and impossibilities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah,  you think so because you read the letter and do not understand the spirit. If  you were not so limited you would comprehend the true meaning of the  contradictions and mistakes which puzzle you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They  don&rsquo;t puzzle me,&rdquo; retorted the other resentfully. &ldquo;Such rubbish is not worth  puzzling about. And I am not limited in any way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah.  Then your knowledge is as wide as that of&mdash;shall we say Narvaez?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  But then he is an older man and has had more time to study. But I am learning  swiftly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  the personality you know as Squire Enistor of Tremore is taking all that  learning to use for its own ends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  not, when such personality is myself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  lower self: all the self you know,&rdquo; corrected Eberstein serenely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  other self is there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  Greater Self: that spark of God, which is you&mdash;the Eternal You. Bring your  learning to That, Enistor, and you will become One with the Great Father  through Christ the Son by the influence of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  if I am that Greater Self, as you say, I work for myself, and therefore deserve  praise for my work and the reward also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  work only for the limited self which you know. You are not aware of your  Greater Self, because it is veiled from you. All you are doing at present is to  thicken those veils instead of thinning them. Are you not aware that God is the  One manifesting Himself in us, the Many? We are all striving to return to Him,  the source of our Being. This being the case, through life after life we have  to widen our limitations, so that instead of knowing ourselves as man&mdash;as you  do&mdash;we come to know ourselves as gods, one with the Great God, yet  individualised for His holy purpose. Why do you seek to limit your powers, to  circumscribe your knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  rubbish you talk, doctor,&rdquo; cried the Squire, opening his eyes in genuine  amazement. &ldquo;Why, I am trying hard to increase my knowledge and gain power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Power  for yourself,&rdquo; said Eberstein quickly, &ldquo;and by so doing you are narrowing your  circle of action. By giving, you widen out to the consciousness of the Deity:  by taking, you build yourself a little hut in which you sit as a very shabby  little god.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  Narvaez has powers you do not dream of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know more about Narvaez than you think, Mr. Enistor. He is doing in a much  greater degree what you are striving to do in a smaller way under his misguided  instruction. Was not the warning given last night in this very room enough to  shake your faith in his powers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  Squire started back frowning. &ldquo;You know what took place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course I know, and you know that I know. Come, Enistor, let us talk freely, for  I want to help you, and you need more help than you dream of. Narvaez calls me  The Adversary, and so I am: not so much adverse to you and him, as to your  doings. Your spirit is one with my spirit, as is that of Narvaez&rsquo;, and I wish  to aid that other part of myself to fight against the animal self which is  trying to overpower it. The spirit cannot be harmed overmuch truly; but the  soul can be made a slave to the senses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have  you come here to measure your strength against mine?&rdquo; demanded Enistor in a  furious manner.</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  smiled. &ldquo;If I put forth my strength against Narvaez, much less against you, the  result would surprise you. But I act under the Law of Love, which gives every  man free-will, and does not allow domination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Narvaez  was dominated last night,&rdquo; admitted the Squire reluctantly. &ldquo;Did you strike him  down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  A Great Power struck him down in very mercy, as he was going too far, and it is  hoped that the warning may turn him from his evil ways. He is my brother as  well as you are, Enistor, and I wish to help you both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want your help, unless you can make me rich and powerful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  could make you both, and you would use what I gave you to damn yourself yet  deeper. Narvaez is dragging you down to the abyss into which he is surely  descending. In Atlantis he lured you into his nets by promising to gratify your  desire for personal power over men; by giving you wealth to pander to your animal  passions. Life after life, as in Chaldea, he has made you more and more his  slave by working through your senses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not a slave!&rdquo; cried Enistor indignantly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed  you are. To Narvaez and to your own evil passions. You, who are a god in the  making, obey him. Like Judas Iscariot he is a son of perdition and wishes to  make you one also, because your intellect is useful to him. Again and again, in  many lives, you have been helped in order that you may break away from this  bondage; but you will not, and until of your own free will you elect to break  away, nothing can be done to save you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where  is the boasted power of Christ?&rdquo; sneered Enistor contemptuously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Poor  soul, why blaspheme? Christ stands at the door of your heart waiting until you  open the door. He does not enter unless He is invited, so how can He use what  you call His boasted power, unless you will accept His aid. Humble yourself,  Enistor. Say as did the prodigal son: &lsquo;Father, I have sinned against Heaven,  and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.&rsquo; Then you will  learn how great is His mercy: how sweet His compassion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  refuse: I refuse! I am myself: none shall rule me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Narvaez  rules you, and will you bend to him rather than to the Holy One?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  make use of Narvaez!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  makes use of you rather. Oh, blind, blind! Already he is plotting and scheming  to gain you riches in this life as he did in others, so that he may bind you  the more securely to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  that is the case why don&rsquo;t you thwart his schemes?&rdquo; taunted Enistor.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  has free-will, and must act according to his own judgment. Moreover, those he  plots against are delivered into his hand by their own acts. One is, at all  events. Alice escaped from his rule in Chaldea when he slew her by his black  magic, and since then he has striven vainly to enchain her again. Montrose is  at his mercy and at yours, because of the crime he committed in the Temple of  the Star-Angel. He stabbed you and carried away a vestal, in spite of my  warnings. For this reason Narvaez has power over him, and as, through love, the  Karma of Alice is connected with the Karma of Montrose, she has to suffer in a  vicarious way. But Narvaez cannot rule her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  can rule Montrose however,&rdquo; sneered the Squire.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  in the way you think. Ignorance has made Montrose helpless, as he sinned  through blind passion. But he has not deliberately given himself over to the  Dark Powers as you have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have not given myself over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have&mdash;believe me you have,&rdquo; insisted Eberstein. &ldquo;And even now your evil master  fears lest you should escape, as your soul is striving mightily. There are  germs of good in you which I am trying to awaken. Now a great chance is being  given to you to escape from the bondage of sin. See that you take it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  chance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Montrose  owes you a life: he is possessed of a fortune which you think you ought to  have. Forgive him his sin against you, and admit that he has a right to keep  the fortune. Then your chains will break.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  if I refuse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  greater will be your sufferings, both in this life and in others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  threaten, do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  plead and warn. But I see that you will not listen, therefore I talk in vain.&rdquo;  Eberstein was silent for a moment, then added quietly, &ldquo;But it may be that the  Blessed One working through Montrose may save you yet. Great is the mercy of  God and great is His patience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  then left the room. Enistor gazed after him with a sneer. &ldquo;Why, I believe he is  afraid of me,&rdquo; he muttered, with inconceivable foolishness.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XVII"><b>Chapter XVII</b></a><b><br>
    The Disciple Of Hate</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Dr.  Eberstein came and went like a gleam of sunshine. His mere presence comforted  the lovers, since they felt that he would be a source of strength in time of  trouble. Truly that time had not yet arrived, but the hint given of its  proximity made those who were destined to suffer both uneasy and apprehensive.  As the doctor refused to explain what was about to take place sooner or later,  the suspense was extraordinarily trying, and only the profound faith of the  lovers in their tried friend enabled them to endure. At present, things  certainly went smoothly, since Narvaez had ceased to persecute and Enistor was  apparently agreeable to the marriage. Nevertheless the young couple felt  insecure and sensed clouds gathering swiftly in the summer sky. It was the  ominous calm before the breaking of the storm, and the sole comfort lay in the  fact that Eberstein remained at Perchton, able and willing on their behalf to  deal with the problematic future.</p>
  <p align="left">As  to Enistor, after his one interview with the doctor he scoffed at the idea of  such a man endangering the success of his schemes. In common with the majority  of people, the Squire considered a loving disposition to be a distinct sign of  weakness, and Eberstein&rsquo;s tolerant arguments only strengthened this belief.  Judging the disciple of love by his own limitations, Enistor assured himself  that if the doctor really possessed power he would make use of it to gain what  he wanted. The Squire was not very clear in his mind as to what Eberstein  really did want, but nevertheless believed that to secure his ends he would  long since have exhibited some capacity to enforce obedience on his enemies.  But far from doing this, or even threatening, the doctor had merely talked  ethically. Enistor scouted such chatter, since he could not, and indeed would not,  believe that the power of love was stronger than, or even as strong as, the  power of hate. The fact that Narvaez had been reduced to impotence when  exercising his evil will should have warned the Squire that he had to deal with  overwhelming forces, but he shut his eyes to such a plain revelation and  persisted obstinately in believing that he was superior to the gigantic power  of good. It was simply a case of &ldquo;neither will they be persuaded though one  rose from the dead,&rdquo; and Enistor declined to believe the evidence of his own  eyes. There is nothing stops the progress of any one so much as intellectual  pride, since it persistently distorts the truth into what it wishes to believe is the  truth.</p>
  <p align="left">Don  Pablo could have enlightened him, since he was not foolish enough to  underestimate the forces with which he fought, even though in his insane pride  he pitted himself against those very forces. But Don Pablo had shut himself in  his cottage, and again and again refused to see his pupil. And Enistor could  not force himself upon the seclusion of the sage, as he knew by experience that  Narvaez, less considerate than Eberstein, would do him an injury if annoyed. So  the Squire likewise had to wait as did Alice and her lover. The nerves of all  three were strung up to breaking-point, and the atmosphere of Tremore became  more than ever insistently oppressive.</p>
  <p align="left">To  escape the pressure Alice went down to see Dame Trevel in the village, leaving  Douglas to write sundry letters. Afterwards he was to join her on the moors, so  that they might go for a lengthy walk before dinner. The old nurse was at home  as usual, but Alice was surprised to find Hardwick with her. The artist looked  like a wax image for paleness, and was seated in the pet chair of the hostess  with the appearance of a man who had not long to live. The momentary  improvement in his health when he had gone to Perchton had passed away, and  Alice uttered an exclamation of dismay.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Julian, how ill you look! You should be in bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  that&rsquo;s what I tell him, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trevel, looking anxiously at the  young man. &ldquo;Bed for the likes of he, say I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sick of bed,&rdquo; said Julian, in a pettish tone quite foreign to his usual speech.  &ldquo;It does me no good to lie like a log day after day. Thank God, it won&rsquo;t be  long now before the end comes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Julian, don&rsquo;t talk in that way,&rdquo; cried Alice tearfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear, I have done all I can, and the result is of the worst. The Perchton  doctor can do no good, and even Montrose&rsquo;s friend says that I shall never get  better. There is nothing organically wrong. I am just dying of sheer debility.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  careful nursing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Trevel shook her ancient head. &ldquo;Nursing and doctors and medicine won&rsquo;t do the  gentleman any good, Miss Alice. He&rsquo;s come to me for some herbal cure, but there&rsquo;s  nothing I can give. Only the Almighty can renew his strength.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  Almighty does not see fit to do so,&rdquo; said Julian moodily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, for  heaven&rsquo;s sake, Alice. Tears are of no use. After all it is just as well you  refused to marry me, as I should soon have left you a widow, and an  unprovided-for widow at that. Until your father found me insensible on the moor  no one knew my secret, not even my sister; and I always managed to keep up,  even to racing you to Tremore, if you remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  I remember! I never dreamed you had anything the matter with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor  did any one else save a London doctor. But of late this debility has gained on  me, and the end is very near. My dear, I was selfish to propose to you without  telling the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t say that, Julian. Can nothing be done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing!  My heart may stop at any moment, as the Perchton doctor says. One comfort I  have and that is an easy death awaits me.&rdquo; Hardwick began to laugh in a feeble  manner. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t look like a man who is able to enjoy a legacy, do I, Alice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  legacy? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why,  Don Pablo, who always objected to me because I loved you, has turned out to be  an unexpected friend. He came yesterday to see me and explained that he had  left all his money to me. If I could only live, Alice, I should be a very  wealthy man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  has Se&ntilde;or Narvaez done this?&rdquo; asked the girl, puzzled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lord  knows,&rdquo; replied Julian indifferently. &ldquo;He says he has taken a fancy to me, and  that as you are to marry Montrose he and I are in the same boat, as your rejected  lovers. He&rsquo;s not a bad old fellow after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  shivered. &ldquo;I can never like Don Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know. He&rsquo;s eccentric rather than bad, and perhaps he really did love  you. At all events, he has behaved most kindly towards me during my illness, sending  grapes and wine and other delicacies. I used to dislike him and wanted to  refuse them, but he came and behaved so sympathetically that I accepted what he  offered. But his legacy,&rdquo; Julian shook his head, &ldquo;I shall never live to enjoy  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But  Alice could not bring herself to believe that Narvaez was the good unselfish  man Hardwick made him out to be. &ldquo;I wonder what is behind all this amiable  behaviour, Julian?&rdquo; she asked, pondering.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wickedness,  dearie!&rdquo; cried Dame Trevel unexpectedly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you never think as the leopard  can change them spots of his. That foreign gentleman is the devil, if ever  there was one, with horns and hoofs, and as black as a coal from the pit. He&rsquo;s  got some wicked design on you, Mr. Hardwick, as he has with that silly girl, Rose  Penwin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  there is nothing wrong about what he is doing for Rose,&rdquo; said Julian, with a  faint smile. &ldquo;He told me that she had great dramatic talent and should go on  the stage. He is willing to help her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is willing to make a fool of her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trevel, knitting vigorously, &ldquo;and  that&rsquo;s a fact. Why can&rsquo;t he leave the girl alone to marry Job and do her best  to be a good wife; not that she ever will be, the pretty fool. Your Don  Babbler, or Pabbler, or whatever you call him, will get his neck twisted by my  lad, if he don&rsquo;t mind his own business. All the village knows how he&rsquo;s come  between Job and his promised missus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  means well: he means well!&rdquo; said Hardwick, rising and looking like an old and  feeble man in spite of his great stature; &ldquo;but perhaps he would be wise to  leave Rose alone. Alice, will you give me your arm to my lodgings? I see that  Dame Trevel can do me no good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  would if I could, my dear gentleman, but you&rsquo;re past the power of man to mend,  as any one can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  say that,&rdquo; cried Alice hastily, and helping Julian to the door. &ldquo;It will be  best for him to come to Tremore and let me nurse him. As to Rose Penwin I shall  see Don Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  do no good, dearie, and it ain&rsquo;t for the likes of you to go after so wicked a  man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall appeal to his kind heart, as Mr. Hardwick says he has one. I want Job and  Rose to be happy, so I shall ask Don Pablo to leave her alone to live out her  life in Polwellin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think if you put it to him in the right way he will,&rdquo; murmured Julian.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  he don&rsquo;t, murder will come of it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trevel wisely, and then stood at  her door to see the artist being helped down the narrow street by Alice in a  most tender manner. &ldquo;Poor gentleman,&rdquo; thought the old woman, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s death in  his face, and such a fine figure of a man too. Him dying, and Rose taking  jewels from that foreign beast, and my lad with murder in his heart&mdash;oh, it&rsquo;s a  weary world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">All  Alice&rsquo;s persuasions could not gain Julian&rsquo;s consent to go to Tremore to be  nursed. But the girl could not bear to think of him dying in lonely lodgings,  so she determined to write a letter to Mrs. Barrast and get her to visit  Cornwall. Julian laughed at the idea.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear, Amy won&rsquo;t come. And if she did she would only worry me. Let me die in  peace. I can leave this world quite happy, as you are to marry such a good  fellow as Montrose is. Oh, here we are. How lucky my sitting-room is on the  ground floor, Alice, along with my bedroom. I don&rsquo;t think I am strong enough to  climb stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Julian,  I can&rsquo;t bear to leave you like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  can do no good by stopping beside me. I am not suffering any pain, remember;  only fading out of life as it were. I don&rsquo;t know whether it is owing to the  fall of the year, or over-exertion on my part, but it is surprising to think how  swiftly I have broken up altogether.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  never dreamed that you were so weak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Julian  laughed and nodded. &ldquo;I kept my secret well by only seeing you and others when I  was feeling stronger than usual. However, I can play my part no longer, and  anyhow it matters little. Now I shall get to bed. Look in occasionally and get  Montrose to call when he has time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice,  greatly distressed, but wholly unable to improve matters in any way, took a  tearful leave of the sick man and climbed up the path leading across the moors  to the hill of the Roman encampment. There, by the Druidical altar, she had  arranged to meet Douglas, and as the pathway ran past Don Pablo&rsquo;s cottage she  decided to see the man about his interference in Job Trevel&rsquo;s love-affairs. The  fisherman was certainly growing dangerous, and much as the girl disliked  Narvaez, she had no wish to see him strangled. Besides, if her foster-brother  allowed his temper to get the better of him to this extent he would undoubtedly  be hanged, and that would break Dame Trevel&rsquo;s heart.</p>
  <p align="left">More  than ever Alice wondered why the Spaniard should wish to benefit Rose by giving  her a chance of exhibiting her beauty on the stage, and should desire to make  Julian a wealthy man. So far as she could understand, Narvaez was anything but  a philanthropist, and, although he had succeeded in convincing Hardwick of his  kindly nature and generous disposition, Miss Enistor had her doubts. It was  borne in upon her that for his own mysterious ends Don Pablo was acting a  comedy which might&mdash;and in the case of Job certainly would&mdash;turn into a tragedy.  Regarding Julian&rsquo;s legacy Alice had no wish to interfere, but so far as Rose  was concerned she thought it would be just as well to warn the Spaniard that he  was playing with fire. With this determination she came in sight of Don Pablo&rsquo;s  cottage about half an hour before the time appointed for the meeting with  Douglas on the mount.</p>
  <p align="left">It  was such a glorious day that there were quite a number of people on the moors,  mostly women, who were gathering bracken and cutting peat. The blustering winds  of previous days had died away, and rain had ceased to deluge the country, so  that the vast spaces of many-coloured herbage spread largely and clearly under  the grey-blue sky. There were no mists to veil the view or blur the outline of  distant hills, and but for the keen nip in the air and the presence of frost in  deep hollows where the pools were iced over, it might have been summer. Alice  quite enjoyed the walk in the pale sunshine, and her cheeks grew more rosy and her  eyes brighter while she advanced towards the trysting-place. When she came  unexpectedly upon Don Pablo taking the air, some trifling distance from his  cottage, Miss Enistor looked more charming than ever the old man had seen her.  He was aware of her coming with that preternatural acuteness which  distinguished him, and came forward with a gallant air of greeting which ill  accorded with his withered looks. The man appeared to be older than ever,  and&mdash;as Alice thought&mdash;more wicked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This  is indeed a surprise,&rdquo; smirked the elderly lover, bowing; &ldquo;are you on your way  to see me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am on my way to see Mr. Montrose,&rdquo; replied Alice coldly, for the man revolted  her now as always; &ldquo;but I did intend to call in at your cottage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  kind of you. Permit me to lead you into my humble abode.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  thank you. I can talk to you here. It is about Rose Penwin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed!  She has been telling you how I wish to forward her fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  But Dame Trevel told me and I came to expostulate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez  grinned wickedly. &ldquo;For doing a kind action. Surely not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see where the kindness comes in, to launch a girl on the London stage and  place her in the midst of temptation, when she could be a happy wife in  Polwellin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  talk like a woman of fifty, my dear Alice. What do you know of temptation, or  of life at all? As for Rose being the happy wife of a rude fisherman, that is  impossible to one of her beauty and talents. As one old enough to be her  great-grandfather surely I am permitted to help her to do something in the  world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Polwellin  is all the world Rose needs,&rdquo; said Alice resolutely; &ldquo;until you interfered she  was quite content to marry Job. Why did you meddle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ask  yourself that question, my dear,&rdquo; retorted Narvaez, coolly adjusting his fur  coat. &ldquo;I was engaged to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never!  Never! Never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  you threw me over,&rdquo; continued Don Pablo, just as if she had not spoken; &ldquo;therefore  I tried to comfort my heart by doing good. Marry me and I shall leave Rose to  become that oaf&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall not marry you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  you say, but I think differently. The game is not yet played out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  game?&rdquo; asked Alice, looking at his malicious face with distaste.</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez  chuckled wickedly. &ldquo;You know, yet you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he rejoined enigmatically. &ldquo;When  you are my wife this problem will be explained to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall never be your wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed  you shall and your lover&rsquo;s fortune shall be restored to your father, who ought  to have it. There are wheels within wheels, my dear girl, and much is going on  of which you are ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  daresay,&rdquo; said Alice firmly, &ldquo;you are capable of any wickedness. But it is  impossible for you to harm me or Douglas. You forget that we have a friend in  Dr. Eberstein.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  Spaniard&rsquo;s wrinkled face grew black, and he looked like a wicked little gnome  bent upon mischief. &ldquo;I defy Eberstein and his silly power,&rdquo; he said shrilly. &ldquo;He  can do much, but I can do more. No one can hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Job  can and Job will, Se&ntilde;or Narvaez. You don&rsquo;t know the tempers of our West Country  men. Already he is dangerous, and if you do not leave Rose alone he will break  your neck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  neck is not so easily broken,&rdquo; retorted Don Pablo tartly. &ldquo;I am not so feeble  as my appearance warrants. There are other ways than those of mere brute force  by which I can defend myself. Eberstein&mdash;pouf!&rdquo; he snapped his fingers in  disdain. &ldquo;Job Trevel&mdash;pouf!&rdquo; he repeated the action; &ldquo;but Montrose,&rdquo; he added  with a sudden change of tone, and raising his voice so that some women working  in a near depression of the ground heard him. &ldquo;I am afraid of Montrose. He may  kill me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are talking rubbish,&rdquo; said Alice, startled by the meaning hate in his tones. &ldquo;Douglas  scarcely knows you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  will know me better soon. I see him coming along yonder. Doubtless to meet you  and enjoy those kisses which should be mine.&rdquo; Don Pablo with surprising  activity leaped to the girl&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Do you think that I shall surrender you to  him?&rdquo; His hot breath fanned her cheek. &ldquo;Shall I permit a fool to triumph over  me? No!&rdquo; He gripped her wrist before she could swerve aside. &ldquo;You are mine. You  shall be my wife, my slave, my helper, my instrument. And this is the sign of  your bondage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Douglas!  Douglas!&rdquo; Alice shrieked as the hateful Spaniard threw his arm round her waist  and endeavoured to press his withered lips to her own.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mine!  Mine!&rdquo; cried Narvaez, and the girl felt faint with disgust as he clung to her  like a loathsome snake. The next instant he was whirled away by a strong arm,  and Douglas was sustaining Alice, while the women from their work of  peat-cutting and some men with them ran up, crying loudly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  beastly little devil,&rdquo; shouted the young man furiously, &ldquo;I shall break every  bone in your body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  hear! you hear!&rdquo; screamed Don Pablo, raising himself on his hands and knees  with an effort; &ldquo;he threatens me. He wants to kill me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez  was no favourite in Polwellin, but he was rich and had made friends with the  mammon of unrighteousness in the village. Therefore the men and women murmured  something about the shame of a young man striking so old a gentleman. They had  not seen the entire episode, and even if they had would not have blamed the  Spaniard overmuch, since it was popularly reported that the younger man had  stolen the promised bride of the older one. &ldquo;Lat um be,&rdquo; said one of the men,  stretching out his arm to prevent Montrose again falling on Don Pablo, which he  seemed inclined to do.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  let him be,&rdquo; panted Alice, clinging to her lover, &ldquo;he is mad. I shall tell my  father how he has insulted me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Insult  you!&rdquo; shrieked Narvaez, crawling up with the expression of a fiend. &ldquo;I wonder  you think any one can insult you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  broke away from Alice and, gripping Narvaez firmly, shook him like a terrier  shaking a rat. &ldquo;You wicked wretch, how dare you! I&rsquo;ll kill you if you insult  Miss Enistor further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lat  um be,&rdquo; growled the same man who had spoken before; &ldquo;um be bad fur sure, but um  be old, my young sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pah!&rdquo;  Douglas flung the little gnome away and took Alice&rsquo;s arm within his own. &ldquo;Let  him keep out of my way then. If he crosses my path again I shall rid the world  of his accursed presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  hear! You hear!&rdquo; shouted Don Pablo again. &ldquo;He threatens to kill me. If anything  happens to me, remember all of you what has been said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Aye,  we&rsquo;ll remember. But why didn&rsquo;t you lat her as is to be his wife alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  was to be my wife and he robbed me of her,&rdquo; snarled Narvaez, arranging his  disordered attire.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come  away! come away,&rdquo; murmured Alice, with white lips and dragging Douglas aside,  for the young man&rsquo;s fury was overpowering him again.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;ll go. I am not master of myself while that little reptile is about&mdash;oh, you  toad&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; Words failed Montrose, and he walked hurriedly away with Alice,  after shaking his fist at Narvaez.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  threatened to kill me: I&rsquo;ll remember that,&rdquo; shouted the Spaniard after him. &ldquo;You  threatened in the presence of witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose,  walking swiftly home with Alice, paid no attention to the cry, but turned to  the girl with a white face of suppressed anger and dilated nostrils. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t  you let me twist his neck?&rdquo; he growled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  an old man,&rdquo; apologised Alice, shivering.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;An  old beast. Is age to protect him from being punished? I shall tell your father,  and Narvaez will never enter again into Tremore. He won&rsquo;t come near me again in  a hurry, I&rsquo;ll warrant, after that shaking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is dangerous! dangerous!&rdquo; said the girl, trembling violently. &ldquo;There is some  meaning in what he did. You heard how he called on those men and women to  witness that you had threatened him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  do more than threaten if he dares to as much as look at you again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Douglas,  he is dangerous. Keep away from him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with him. He is old as you say, and I can&rsquo;t  thrash the life out of him as I should like to. Come, Alice, you will be all  right soon. You have done with Narvaez; he has cut his own throat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is dangerous! He is dangerous!&rdquo; and that was all the girl could say, or think,  since a dim feeling that future evil would come out of present evil haunted her  in a way she could not explain.</p>
  <p align="left">Had  the two overheard what Narvaez was saying and seen what he was doing, Douglas  also might have deemed the man dangerous. He gave money to the men and women  who had witnessed the affair, and told them to remember the threats of  Montrose. &ldquo;I am an old man. I love Miss Enistor as a daughter,&rdquo; whimpered Don  Pablo, &ldquo;yet my life is in danger. I shall get the police to protect me. As it  is, this young ruffian has almost killed me,&rdquo; and with a feeble gait he  tottered into his cottage. There he smiled grimly when within four walls and  rubbed his hands. &ldquo;That is the first act of the drama: now for the second.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII"><b>Chapter  XVIII</b></a><b><br>
    The Night Before</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Enistor  was furious when he was told how Narvaez had insulted his daughter, for  although he had little love for the girl, yet his family pride rose up in arms  against such behaviour. Don Pablo was useful to him, as he knew a great deal  about super-physical laws, which the Squire desired to know also, and in which  he was being instructed. All the same the Spaniard had proved to be a hard  master, and moreover had talked much about the recovery of the fortune, but had  done little towards enabling it to be regained. Then again, Narvaez had been  struck down in the moment of triumph by a stronger force than any he possessed,  and that made him out to be less powerful than he claimed he was. In one word,  Enistor was beginning to consider Don Pablo to be something of a humbug.</p>
  <p align="left">Certainly  there were the pains to which he could subject his pupil when he so chose. But  that was, as Enistor knew, mere hypnotic suggestion and could be nullified by  an opposing will. Narvaez hitherto had possessed the more dominating influence,  but since his capabilities appeared to be shattered by the intervention of the  higher powers, it might be that he could not inflict further hurt. The Squire  wondered if he could make his dark master suffer by taking him unawares while  his forces were weak, and determined to do so if he could, if only to be  avenged for the series of petty insults to which he had long been subjected.  Why Narvaez should behave in such a crude animal way to Alice, the girl&rsquo;s  father could not think. But as he had over-stepped the mark, it gave Enistor an  opportunity of becoming openly hostile. Enistor was selfish and unscrupulous,  but there was that in him which resented the treatment to which Alice had been subjected.  Perhaps the germs of good to which Eberstein had referred were sprouting with  unexpected swiftness. But be it as it may, Enistor sought the moorland cottage  breathing out fire and fury against his former friend.</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez  refused to see him, and when Enistor, sternly angry, sent word by the old  housekeeper that he would break his way in and take the consequence, he still  refused. However, he improved upon his former message by sending an intimation  that he would receive the Squire on the following afternoon. With this Enistor  was fain to be content, as by breaking in he would only cause a scandal, which  for Alice&rsquo;s sake was not to be thought of. The master of Tremore was a very  proud man, and could not bear to think that his family name should be made the  subject of police-court gossip. But when he returned home, he believed more  than ever that Narvaez was a fraud, as he had not even attempted to inflict the  usual pains by suggestion. The man was getting so old that he was losing his  nerve, and shortly would not be worth considering whether as friend or foe.  Having therefore lost the magician&rsquo;s dark assistance, Enistor decided to try to  recover the fortune in his own way.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice,  shaken by Don Pablo&rsquo;s conduct, had retired early to bed and Montrose was seated  in the library with his host over after-dinner coffee and tobacco. He was still  seething with anger, but since the Squire had taken matters into his own hands,  he could do nothing but look on. After a full discussion of the affair, Enistor  insisted that it should be shelved.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  have talked enough about it,&rdquo; he said in a peremptory tone. &ldquo;I promise you that  Narvaez shall not enter these doors again. To-morrow I shall explain my opinion  to him, and then he can go hang for me. With regard to his desire to marry  Alice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Surely  after what has taken place, sir, you would never think of any possible  marriage,&rdquo; cried Montrose, glowing with wrath, &ldquo;let alone the fact that you  have tacitly agreed to Alice becoming my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  certainly refuse to think further of Narvaez as my son-in-law,&rdquo; said the Squire  stiffly, &ldquo;in spite of his wealth. But as regards yourself the possibility of  your making my daughter your wife rests with you entirely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  young man laughed and rested his reddish-hued head against the back of the  chair. &ldquo;If it rests with me the matter is soon settled,&rdquo; he said, with a  relieved expression in his eyes. He thought that the Squire was talking in a  remarkably sensible way.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  depends upon how you reply to the question I am about to ask,&rdquo; said Enistor  dryly. &ldquo;You inherit the fortune of my sister?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  Douglas sat up, aware that the conversation was becoming serious. &ldquo;We have not  spoken about this matter before, sir, but I would have you know, now that the  ice is broken between us, that never in any way did I seek that fortune. It was  a surprise to me when I heard the will read by Mr. Cane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  I understand from Mr. Cane himself. I absolve you from fortune-hunting, since  you knew nothing of Lady Staunton&rsquo;s intentions. But do you think it was quite  fair of her to leave the money away from her own family?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is rather a difficult question to put to the man who has benefited, Mr.  Enistor. And let me remind you that by marrying Alice I bring back the fortune  to your family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think not. Your wife benefits, but I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Both  Alice and I are prepared to be your bankers,&rdquo; said Montrose uneasily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To  give me what is rightfully my own,&rdquo; retorted the Squire, with a curling lip. &ldquo;Thank  you for nothing. No, that won&rsquo;t do. Until my sister met you it was always her  intention to leave the money to me, to restore the position of our family in  the county. I want the fortune you hold to myself, as I am a poor man. It is  not for a base ambition that I seek the income, but for the sake of going into  Parliament and helping to govern. I want power, I want a great sphere to work  in. Without money I am condemned to stay in this cramped neighbourhood eating  out my heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  quite understand that with such ambitions you feel the need of money, Mr.  Enistor, and with Alice&rsquo;s permission I am willing to give you any reasonable  sum you desire to forward your aims.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  did not appear to be overcome by this generous offer, or even thankful for the  same. &ldquo;I take nothing as a gift and I claim my rights.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  whole fortune of your sister?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly!  She ought to have willed it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  understood from Alice that you were quite agreeable that Lady Staunton should  do what she wished with her own,&rdquo; said Montrose slowly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t tell Alice everything, Montrose. I accepted my small legacy and said  nothing about the matter, as there was nothing to be done until you came. Now,&rdquo;  Enistor fixed his dominating gaze on Douglas, &ldquo;I ask you to let me have the  money by deed of gift. In return you shall marry Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  what are we to live on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall allow you five hundred a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  return for five thousand.&rdquo; Montrose laughed at the boldness of the demand. &ldquo;No,  sir. I cannot do what you ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  you are a fortune-hunter after all,&rdquo; said the Squire bitterly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not!&rdquo; Douglas sprang to his feet with the hot blood making red his cheeks. &ldquo;So  far as I am personally concerned I don&rsquo;t care for money, although I don&rsquo;t deny  that I am glad my days of poverty are over. But this money has been given to me  in trust to help others. I cannot be false to my trust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  waved his hand disdainfully. &ldquo;That is only a young man&rsquo;s talk. Why should you  help others? Let them look after themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think differently. Dr. Eberstein has taught me differently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dr.  Eberstein,&rdquo; said the other with a sneer, &ldquo;is a visionary. If you are to be my  son-in-law you must allow me to advise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have always acted on my own responsibility during life,&rdquo; said Montrose sharply,  &ldquo;and I shall continue to do so. Dr. Eberstein knows so much about things not of  this world that I am always glad to hear what he has to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  do what he tells you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly,  in things which have to do with my spiritual welfare. But as regards earthly  affairs I take my own way. Still, I admit,&rdquo; ended the young man frankly, &ldquo;that  in this instance Eberstein advises me to keep the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Naturally!  He can do what he likes with you and the money will be useful to him and his  ambitions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  taunt was so puerile that it failed to disturb Montrose. &ldquo;Eberstein has no  ambition save to do good, and is rich enough to execute his plans without aid  from me. He cannot do what he likes with me, as you think, although I am always  willing to take his advice, which is of the best. I am not a child, Mr.  Enistor, but one who has gained experience through bitter trials. I may add  that Eberstein&rsquo;s teaching inculcates self-reliance and individual judgment, so  that each man may learn to stand alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  is a dreamer as you are. However I care nothing for him or his teaching in any  way. You have heard my conditions. Surrender the fortune to me and you marry my  daughter: otherwise you must leave my house and never see Alice again. I give  you three days in which to make up your mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  make it up now,&rdquo; said Montrose, resolute but calm. &ldquo;The money I have, and the  money I keep. With or without your consent Alice shall be my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As  you please,&rdquo; replied the Squire, frigidly polite. &ldquo;You have heard my  determination, from which I shall not swerve. In three days we can talk about  this subject again; meanwhile let things go on as usual.&rdquo; And the conversation  terminated in what might be called an armed neutrality.</p>
  <p align="left">To  remain in the house on such a footing was by no means palatable to a young  hot-headed man as Douglas truly was. His first impulse was to leave Tremore and  do battle with Enistor from a distance: his second to stay where he was and  give Alice the safeguard of his presence. Should he depart it might be that  Enistor could coerce the girl into obedience, thereby causing her unnecessary  suffering. Montrose loved Alice too well to submit her to such sorrow, so he  swallowed his pride and said nothing about the conversation. As he was  sufficiently self-controlled to appear at his ease Alice had not the faintest  idea of what had taken place. Perhaps if she had observed her father&rsquo;s sudden  change towards her lover from geniality to chilly politeness she might have  been enlightened. But the insolent conduct of Narvaez had made her nervously  ill, and she was too languid to take much interest in any one or anything. So  matters remained much as usual, although the visitor felt that the atmosphere  of the big house was insistently menacing and sinister. Eberstein could have  told him that the conditions heralded the breaking of a storm, but Eberstein,  watchful and silent, stayed at Perchton, saying nothing, but thinking much.</p>
  <p align="left">Meanwhile  Polwellin seethed with gossip. The first item had to do with the sudden illness  of Hardwick, who was said to be dying. Every one regretted the news, as the  artist was a favourite in the neighbourhood in which he had lived so long. The  doctor from Perchton came to see the sick man, and Mr. Sparrow, always a help  in time of trouble, visited the bedside. Hardwick was grateful to see them  both, but was too weak to take much interest in either his body or his soul. He  was simply fading out of life, and things of this world were losing their  interest for the departing spirit.</p>
  <p align="left">The  second item concerned the quarrel of Narvaez and Montrose, which had been  reported by those who witnessed it, with many additions. It was freely stated  that Montrose had threatened to murder the Spaniard for the insult offered to  Miss Enistor, and the gossips said that if he did he would only be forestalling  Job Trevel, who was equally bent upon &ldquo;doing for the foreign gentleman.&rdquo; It  puzzled the simple villagers to understand why Don Pablo should return to Miss  Enistor, when he had left her to philander with Rose Penwin, and arrived at the  conclusion that he was a bad lot. Nevertheless, because the stranger was rich  and scattered his money freely, there were a few who spoke in his favour. But  the majority were hostile, since the mere presence of Narvaez seemed to  irritate those he was with into quarrelling, even though there was no cause to  do so. Undoubtedly the man had an evil influence, and the inhabitants of  Polwellin would not have been displeased to see this male At&ecirc; leave the place.  Then Mr. Montrose could marry the Squire&rsquo;s daughter and Job could make Rose his  wife, which would mean wedding festivities and plenty to eat and drink. In this  way the gossips talked and the rumours grew, so that shortly the whole village  was infected with uneasy fear as to what would happen. It seemed as though the  influence of the dark house on the hill had descended upon Polwellin. Perhaps  it had, and perhaps it had been guided in its descent by that man who dealt  with supernatural things in the cottage which squatted like a toad amongst the  heather.</p>
  <p align="left">To  that same cottage Enistor repaired the next afternoon to keep his appointment.  He found Narvaez, looking older and more withered than ever, crouching over the  fire, moody, broken-up and peevish; altogether unlike his ordinary serene self.  At the first glance the Squire decided that his master was quite helpless and  sat down with a glow of pleasure to take the upper hand. It pleased him  immensely to show Narvaez that he also had a will, that he also could bully,  and that the former relationship was now reversed. All the latent cruelty in  Enistor rose to the surface at the sight of his helpless tyrant. The late  under-dog now intended to bite and worry as the top-dog had done.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  sir,&rdquo; said Enistor shortly, &ldquo;what have you to say for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez  whimpered and crouched still lower over the fire. &ldquo;I am an old man,&rdquo; he moaned,  &ldquo;a very old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;An  old scoundrel, you mean. How dare you insult my daughter yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are  you against me also? Do you want to see Montrose murder me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  would serve you right if you did get murdered,&rdquo; snapped the Squire with  contempt; &ldquo;you are of no use in the world that I can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  did not think so once,&rdquo; muttered Don Pablo humbly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  That is true. Because I believed you to be a clever man. Now I know that you  are a fraud laying claim to a power you never possessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have felt my power,&rdquo; snarled Narvaez savagely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  admit that I have. And why? Because you had a trained will which you could  concentrate to compel me to feel what you wished. That is a thing of the past.  The Great Power that laid you low the other night has broken your will, and you  are no longer able to control me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is true! that is true! I have had a shock, a great shock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  if I put forth my will,&rdquo; continued the Squire mercilessly, &ldquo;I could make you  endure the pains you inflicted on me when I disobeyed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  would you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have a mind to do so at this moment. You set the example. As you did to me so I  wish to do to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  daresay.&rdquo; Narvaez straightened himself a trifle, and some of his old fire  sparkled in his dull eyes. &ldquo;But I am not yet so feeble that I cannot defend  myself if necessary. I cannot control you, certainly, as The Adversary has  scattered and weakened my will, but I can prevent you from hurting me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  I shall let you off this time,&rdquo; said Enistor, sneering, yet wondering why he  should show mercy after Don Pablo&rsquo;s teaching.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let  me off! Let me off!&rdquo; screamed the Spaniard fiercely. &ldquo;Try, if you dare, to  measure your powers against mine, shattered as I am. I can gather myself  together again, remember; then you take care, you take care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  felt a qualm, wondering if Narvaez was so weak as he pretended to be. There was  a look in the rekindled light of those steady eyes which made him doubtful of  his ground. Bold as he was, he felt that it would be rash to advance, and  therefore he retreated skilfully by changing the conversation immediately. &ldquo;You  are wrong to think that Eberstein struck you down the other night. It was a  Higher Power.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who  told you that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Eberstein  himself. It shows me how broken you are, Narvaez, when you don&rsquo;t know that the  man has been trying to convert me to his way of thinking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  Yes! I am brought very low: very low indeed,&rdquo; muttered Don Pablo with a groan; &ldquo;but  if Eberstein tried to convert you he hasn&rsquo;t succeeded very well, since it is  only the remains of my power that prevent you from giving me pain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t agree with what Eberstein says,&rdquo; retorted the Squire tartly. &ldquo;He talked  the usual weak Christianity of benefiting one&rsquo;s neighbours instead of one&rsquo;s  self.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  not take his advice?&rdquo; asked Narvaez, looking up with his former keen glance. &ldquo;Benefiting  one&rsquo;s self has brought me to this. If you follow my teaching you also may come  to these depths.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is a strange thing for you to advise, Narvaez.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  strange! But I should not advise if I dreamed for one moment that you were  disposed to take the Right-hand Path. The Power of Self is too strong for you,  Enistor. Age after age it has dominated you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  Eberstein told me! But this time I have broken your bonds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have  you indeed?&rdquo; said Narvaez in a strange tone, staring into the fire. &ldquo;Ah! that  will please Eberstein. Of course I lose a pupil and he gains one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  I stand alone!&rdquo; said Enistor proudly.</p>
  <p align="left">The  answer seemed to satisfy Don Pablo and he chuckled. &ldquo;I hope you will be able to  stand alone against Montrose, now that I cannot aid you. He has the fortune,  remember, and he will keep it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have given him three days to surrender it or lose Alice for ever. And the  mention of her name,&rdquo; cried the Squire, lashing himself into a fury, &ldquo;makes me  wonder that I don&rsquo;t thrash you for daring to insult her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  No!&rdquo; cried Narvaez, and his voice broke. &ldquo;I am such an old man. Besides I can  still help you. Montrose has a secret which you can use against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  is that secret?&rdquo; Enistor&rsquo;s hand, which he had raised to strike, fell by his  side.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Montrose  is already married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a lie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ask  your young friend if it is a lie. You talk about my having insulted your  daughter, Enistor: what about the insult of a married man coming to woo the  girl in so shameless a fashion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  Squire frowned and was too astounded to speak for a few moments, during which  Don Pablo eyed him curiously. When he did speak it was again to deny the truth  of the amazing statement. &ldquo;Beyond the fact that Montrose will not give up the  money which should be mine I have nothing against him. He is a well-bred  gentleman and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very  well bred to pose as a bachelor,&rdquo; sneered Narvaez contemptuously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe it. The man is honest. You will have to prove what you say,  Narvaez. Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Since  you are shouting so loudly I can safely say that I do. Prove what I say: oh,  certainly. Send Montrose here to-night and I can give him absolute proof that  my statement is correct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall come with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  said Narvaez sharply. &ldquo;If you come I shall refuse to give the proof in any way.  Montrose will be convinced that I can prevent him from marrying your daughter,  and to put things straight he may be willing to give up the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Even  then,&rdquo; cried Enistor furiously, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t allow him to marry Alice. He would be a  bigamist.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is his affair and hers,&rdquo; said Don Pablo cynically. &ldquo;What you want is the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  do, but not at the price of seeing my daughter&rsquo;s life ruined.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pooh!  What does her ruin or his matter to you? Are you bent upon following the feeble  Christianity of Eberstein?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Feeble!  He was too strong for you the other night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  was not!&rdquo; Narvaez raised himself to his full height and seemed to recover a  trifle of his former dominance. &ldquo;I could have dealt with The Adversary alone,  but the power he summoned to his aid overwhelmed me. However, this is not to  the point.&rdquo; The man collapsed again into a weak condition. &ldquo;Do what I tell you  about sending Montrose here at eight o&rsquo;clock this evening. I can prove that he  is a married man. If you like I can get him, through threats to expose him to  Alice, to give you the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall deal with that,&rdquo; said Enistor angrily. &ldquo;All you have to do is to prove  your statement. He can come alone and when he returns he shall explain what you  say. But I don&rsquo;t believe that he is married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think Montrose will believe,&rdquo; chuckled Narvaez, and then waved his thin hand. &ldquo;Go  now, Enistor. I am tired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  order me about in that arrogant way,&rdquo; shouted the Squire, &ldquo;you have not the  power to do so. You will be tired enough when Montrose has done with you, I can  tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps  I will. He threatened to murder me, and to keep his secret he may do so. I don&rsquo;t  care: this body is very old and weak. I shall be glad to get a new one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To  work more evil. Remember how you were warned on that night when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go  away! Go away!&rdquo; cried Don Pablo in a shrill voice of anger, and his eyes flamed  viciously. &ldquo;I know more about the warning than you do and I despise it. Do you  hear? I despise it!&rdquo; And as on the night when Alice&rsquo;s soul had been loosened  from its bonds of flesh he shook his fists in the air.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  did not argue any longer, but went away with a contemptuous shrug of his  shoulders. He was more than ever convinced that Narvaez had little power left:  all the same the wounded snake might strike in hopeless rage, so it was not  wise to tempt the man too far. Besides, on his way back to Tremore, the Squire  was filled with rage against Douglas for tricking him. To think that the young  scoundrel was married and yet came down to make love to Alice. Eberstein must  have known that Montrose was not free, and yet he also had kept silent. So much  for the Christianity he professed. It was with a black face and an angry heart  that Enistor returned home. He found that Alice and her lover had gone down to  see Hardwick in Polwellin, therefore he nursed his wrath until they returned,  and it lost nothing by the delay. Even then the Squire did not immediately  attack the young man, since the girl was present. After dinner, as he decided,  he would be able to bring Montrose to book for his monstrous behaviour.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  could scarcely eat and retired early from the table. Julian was at death&rsquo;s  door, as she told her father, and she doubted if Mrs. Barrast&mdash;to whom she had  written&mdash;would arrive in time to take a last farewell. With the Squire&rsquo;s  permission she returned to the dying man accompanied by the housekeeper.  Enistor did not object as he rather liked Hardwick, and was sorry to hear that  he was passing out of life at so early an age. But he put the matter out of his  mind when alone with Montrose.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  saw Narvaez to-day,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;He tells me that you are already  married, and swears that he can give proof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  sprang up almost too startled to speak. &ldquo;Is he mad to say so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mad  or not, he declares that such is the case. What have you to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Say?  Why, such an accusation is not worth answering. I have never looked at a woman  until I met Alice. As to being married,&rdquo; the young man paused with an angry,  bewildered look, &ldquo;the thing is preposterous,&rdquo; he cried indignantly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Preposterous  or not, Narvaez declares that if you go up to him to-night at eight o&rsquo;clock, he  will give you proof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  will he!&rdquo; Montrose glanced at his watch. &ldquo;It is twenty-five to eight now. I  will go at once, and shall arrive at Don Pablo&rsquo;s cottage shortly after the hour  he mentions. Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  what then?&rdquo; demanded the Squire grimly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  force the lie down his throat,&rdquo; raged Montrose, who was quite beside himself  with anger, and, unable to speak further, he left the room hurriedly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  he or Narvaez the liar?&rdquo; Enistor asked himself, but could find no reply.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XIX"><b>Chapter XIX</b></a><b><br>
    The Morning After</b></h2>
  <p align="left">After  breakfast disastrous news came from two quarters, and concerned both Don Pablo  and Julian Hardwick. While the Squire, his daughter and his guest were ending  their meal, the housekeeper rushed into the room with an agitated face to  announce evil. Like all her class she was delighted to be the bearer of bad  tidings, and counted upon making a sensation, which she assuredly did. Enistor  had scarcely raised his eyebrows at her unceremonious entry when she burst into  voluble speech.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!  sir: oh! miss, here&rsquo;s dreadful goings on. That poor young gentleman who painted  pictures is dead and gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  thought he would die,&rdquo; said Alice, with a sob. &ldquo;He had no strength when I left  him last night. Oh! poor Julian: poor Julian.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  that ain&rsquo;t the worst, miss. Se&ntilde;or Narvaez is murdered!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  started to his feet and overturned his chair. He could not believe his ears. &ldquo;Murdered!  Don Pablo! Be careful what you say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am careful, sir,&rdquo; cried the housekeeper resentfully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as dead as a  doornail, lying outside his cottage with a broken neck. Mrs. Boyce as looked  after him came on the corpse this morning, and is now in the kitchen crying  dreadful and exhausted, as she well may be, having rushed across the moor at  her age to tell of the wicked crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  is it a crime?&rdquo; asked Alice, deadly pale and anxious.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For  sure, miss. Men don&rsquo;t break their own necks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who  killed him?&rdquo; demanded Montrose sharply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No  one knows, miss&mdash;I mean, sir. Mrs. Boyce said as Se&ntilde;or Narvaez had some one to  see him last night, but who he was she don&rsquo;t rightly know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor&rsquo;s  eyes rested on Montrose, who started and flushed. &ldquo;When did Mrs. Boyce discover  the body?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When  she got up early to make the old gentleman&rsquo;s breakfast,&rdquo; said the voluble  housekeeper. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t in his room, as usual, but she thought he might have  gone out for a stroll, as he sometimes did. Then later, as he did not return,  Mrs. Boyce went out to look and found him dead just outside the gate, looking  as quiet as pussy. And please, sir, she wants to know what she&rsquo;s to do, having  come as quick as ever she could to tell, so that it mayn&rsquo;t be thought to be her  fault, which it ain&rsquo;t, she being one as wouldn&rsquo;t kill a fly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell  Mrs. Boyce that I shall go over to the cottage and see what is to be done,&rdquo;  said Enistor quickly, &ldquo;and send one of the men down to the village for the  policeman. We must communicate with the Perchton Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  what about Mr. Hardwick as is dead and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t trouble about that. Do what I say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  housekeeper vanished reluctantly, as she dearly wished to remain and discuss  the deaths. The moment the door was closed Enistor turned to Montrose with a  frown. &ldquo;What do you know of this?&rdquo; he asked imperiously.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  started and spoke before her lover could open his mouth. &ldquo;Douglas cannot  possibly know anything,&rdquo; she cried indignantly. &ldquo;What do you mean, father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  mean that Montrose was the last person who saw Don Pablo alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t be sure of that,&rdquo; said the young man, very pale but very quiet. &ldquo;I  certainly called on Don Pablo shortly after eight o&rsquo;clock, to question him  concerning the lie he told about me. But I left him some time before nine  perfectly well. His death is as great a surprise to me as to you, Mr. Enistor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  hope the police will take that view,&rdquo; sneered the Squire. &ldquo;You returned here  after nine and went straight to bed, when you might have guessed that I was in  the library waiting for your report.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  was too upset to give any report,&rdquo; said Montrose shortly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  I quite believe that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Douglas!  father,&rdquo; cried Alice imploringly, as she could not yet understand the precise  situation. &ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  means so far as I can judge that Montrose forced the lie down Narvaez&rsquo; throat,  as he said he would, and very thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you accuse me of killing the man?&rdquo; said Montrose hoarsely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  said the Squire, looking at him with grim directness.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  I deny absolutely what you say,&rdquo; declared the other vehemently; &ldquo;as I said  before, I left Narvaez in his room shortly before nine o&rsquo;clock, after he had  confessed to me that what he mentioned to you was untrue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  did he mention to father?&rdquo; questioned the girl, terrified at the furious looks  of the two men. &ldquo;I was with Julian until eleven, and when I returned home you  had gone to bed, Douglas. I came to tell you about Julian, father, but you did  not say that anything had happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing  had happened then so far as I know,&rdquo; said Enistor quickly. &ldquo;My dear, I saw Don  Pablo yesterday and he told me that Montrose was already married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Married!  Married!&rdquo; Alice started back the picture of dismay.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is a lie!&rdquo; cried Douglas fiercely, and passed round the table to take her in  his arms. &ldquo;I swear it is a lie, dear. When your father told me after dinner I  went at once to Narvaez. He confessed calmly that he had spoken falsely so as  to prejudice my chances of making you my wife. Had he been a younger man I  should have thrashed the life out of him. As it was I told him my opinion and  then left him quite unharmed. I swear that I never laid a finger on him, but  returned here shortly after nine o&rsquo;clock to go to bed. I was too indignant at  what had been said to seek out your father and explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  laughed coldly. &ldquo;That is a very neat story. Do you believe it, Alice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  girl clung to her lover. &ldquo;Believe it: of course I believe it. Douglas would not  tell a lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  even to save his own neck?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  neck isn&rsquo;t in danger,&rdquo; said Montrose haughtily.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know so much about that. The other day you threatened to kill Narvaez for  the insult he offered to Alice, and many people heard that threat, as you know.  To demand explanation of a lie&mdash;I daresay it was a lie&mdash;you left this house  breathing fire and fury against Narvaez. When you returned it was to retire to  bed without a word of explanation. Now we hear that the man, whom you regarded  as your enemy, is dead&mdash;murdered. The evidence in favour of your having killed  Narvaez is very strong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Purely  circumstantial evidence,&rdquo; said Montrose, but turned paler than ever when he  realised his position.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Innocent  men have been hanged on circumstantial evidence before now,&rdquo; said Enistor  coolly. &ldquo;Although on the face of it I do not admit your innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Father,  how can you think Douglas would murder any one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah,  I have not the belief in him that you have, Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed  that is true,&rdquo; said Montrose bitterly. &ldquo;You have always been hostile to me,  although for a time you masked your feelings. Now it seems that without a  shadow of proof you believe me to be a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  shadow of proof!&rdquo; echoed the Squire tauntingly. &ldquo;Upon my word, I think there is  much more than a shadow of proof. You threatened Narvaez and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  so did Job Trevel,&rdquo; interrupted Alice defiantly. &ldquo;It is probable that Job murdered  Don Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Probable,  but scarcely possible,&rdquo; said her father coldly. &ldquo;However, I shall send for the  Perchton police and strict justice shall be done. Until the truth comes to  light, Montrose must lie under suspicion. Leave him, Alice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never!  Never! Never!&rdquo; cried the girl, with her arms round Montrose&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;He is  innocent: wholly innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  stepped forward and wrenched his daughter from the young man. &ldquo;Obey me, Alice,  I command you,&rdquo; he cried imperiously. &ldquo;So far you have had your own way, but  now the time has come for me to have mine. Go to your room and stay there until  I look into the matter. As to you,&rdquo; he faced Montrose, who was quiet and pale  and as still as a statue, &ldquo;I should order you out of my house but that justice  must be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  mean to have me arrested on a charge of murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  mean to explain the whole circumstance to the Perchton Inspector and let him  deal with the matter,&rdquo; retorted Enistor haughtily. &ldquo;Meantime, if you try to  escape you will be taken in charge at my instance by the Polwellin policeman.  You understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  understand that you are bent upon my destruction, Mr. Enistor. But you need  have no fear. Being perfectly innocent, I shall not attempt to escape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Douglas! Douglas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  will  disobey me.&rdquo; Enistor dragged back his daughter and forced her to the door. &ldquo;Go  to your room, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  clenched his hands on seeing the girl he loved so roughly handled, but he could  do nothing against the authority of her father. With one last sorrowful look,  Alice disappeared and Enistor followed, leaving the unfortunate young man alone  with his misery. The wicked atmosphere of the house seemed to bear down upon  him with such force that he could almost feel the physical pressure. But this  probably was imagination, as he was not sufficiently clairvoyant either to see  or hear or feel the unseen. But in this agonising moment when it seemed that he  was being swept away by a flood of evil, his thoughts turned swiftly to  Eberstein. In that man he hoped to find aid, but even as he dwelt on the doctor&rsquo;s  assistance a line from one of the Psalms flashed insistently into his mind. &ldquo;Vain  is the help of man&rdquo; was the phrase, and he became vividly aware by some sixth  sense that salvation could only come from the Great Power of Love as manifested  in the Lord of Compassion. So intolerable a sense of his peril seized him that,  almost unconsciously, the cry for help issued from his lips.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Christ!&rdquo; he breathed audibly. &ldquo;Lord help me, lest I perish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It  might have been that the intense agony of the moment opened his interior  senses, for he became conscious that some glorious light, not of the world, was  enfolding him in its radiance. It welled&mdash;so he believed&mdash;from the golden heart  on his breast, as if the stored-up sacramental power was issuing forth to do  battle with the dark influence. But be this as it may, Montrose became aware  that the gloom was receding, that the evil was being baffled, and that he was  growing stronger by virtue of some higher force to resist the terrors pressing  in upon him. The radiance which clothed him as with a garment gradually died  away, and he found himself standing in the common light of day; but the  peaceful, holy, uplifting feeling remained. He knew his innocence, and he knew  also with profound thankfulness that God would make that innocence apparent to  others. The trouble prophesied by Eberstein had indeed arrived, and very  terrible it was; but behind the clouds which environed him shone the sun of  righteousness, and its glory would sooner or later dispel the gloom. Having  arrived at this knowledge in some way which he was wholly unable to explain,  Montrose left Tremore and descended to Polwellin.</p>
  <p align="left">Here  he walked straight to the post-office and sent a wire to Eberstein asking him  to come over at once. He would have gone to Perchton instead, but that he did  not wish Enistor to put his threat into execution and have him arrested by the  village policeman. As it was, he became an object of suspicion to the fishermen  and their wives. The news of Narvaez&rsquo; violent death had travelled swiftly from  ear to ear, and Montrose was apparently looked upon as the criminal. The  evidence of those who had heard his threats against the man was too clear to  admit of doubt, and already accusations had been spread broadcast, judging from  the horrified looks which met Montrose&rsquo;s gaze on all sides. He had been tried  and condemned without loss of time, and in spite of the sustaining power he  felt his heart sink with purely human fear. It was with a feeling of relief  that he met the vicar face to face. From a more educated man he at least hoped  to have justice.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Montrose,&rdquo; said the vicar, who looked more solemn than ever and was certainly  more stiff, &ldquo;are you wise to walk through the village just now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  should I not?&rdquo; asked the young man defiantly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  there are rumours: rumours,&rdquo; said Mr. Sparrow, removing his clerical hat to  brush his bald head with a nervous hand. &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or Narvaez is dead, as you know,  and it is said that you are responsible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  should I be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  insulted Miss Enistor the other day in your presence and you threatened to kill  him, I understand. Of course I am not a believer in your guilt,&rdquo; added the  parson quickly, &ldquo;as from what I have seen of you I do not think for a moment  that you would shed the blood of a human being.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; said Montrose simply, and extended his hand.</p>
  <p align="left">Sparrow  took it with a flush on his parchment face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all rubbish as I have said,&rdquo;  he burst out with very human wrath. &ldquo;And as you are staying at Tremore,  undoubtedly you will be able to show that you did not see Se&ntilde;or Narvaez last  night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It  was on the tip of Montrose&rsquo;s tongue to confess his visit, but something&mdash;perhaps  common sense&mdash;prevented him from incriminating himself. Instead, a question  sprang to his lips to which he was extremely anxious to get an answer. &ldquo;What  about Job Trevel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  you are,&rdquo; said the vicar quickly. &ldquo;A rough hot-tempered man like Job is much  more likely to have done the deed, though God forbid I should accuse him or any  one unjustly. Yet Job certainly hated Se&ntilde;or Narvaez on account of Rose Penwin,  and uttered many threats against him. But when the news came of this murder,  Mr. Montrose, I at once went to see Dame Trevel, remembering Job&rsquo;s enmity. She  tells me that Job went out fishing last night early and has not returned.  Therefore he cannot be guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  who can have murdered Narvaez?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is hard to say. Of course he lived in a lonely situation and had much wealth,  if rumour is to be believed. We shall see when the police come from Perchton.  They should be here soon. I believe that Mr. Enistor and our village constable  have gone to the cottage to see the body. Meanwhile, Mr. Montrose, I advise you  to return to Tremore and wait until we learn more. Se&ntilde;or Narvaez was no  favourite, yet it is dangerous for you to walk about amongst my rough  parishioners, as they seem to think that you are guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  was no coward, yet he did not see the necessity of courting danger when no  benefit could be derived from such foolhardiness. He bowed his head and accepted  the warning, thankful to think that Mr. Sparrow did not believe him to have  committed the crime. &ldquo;And Hardwick is dead,&rdquo; he said sadly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  Yes! Yes! It is a world of trouble, Mr. Montrose. I have just seen the body,  and the poor fellow looks asleep rather than dead. Strange that he should die  on the very morning when this tragic event takes place. Polwellin is such a  quiet place: nothing of moment ever happens here. Yet now we have two deaths:  one from natural causes and one by violence. It never rains but it pours. I  have much to do: much to do. Now go back to Tremore, my dear young friend, and  rest assured that God will prove your innocence in His own good time. You have  my sympathy and my wife&rsquo;s sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are a good man and she is a good woman, Mr. Sparrow,&rdquo; said Montrose, deeply  moved. &ldquo;I assure you I shall not forget how you are standing by me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pooh!  Pooh! Of course I stand by you, and so will Mr. Enistor. There is absolutely no  ground for these rumours against you, save your unhappy threat. You should keep  your temper, Mr. Montrose: you should keep your temper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rather  hard to do when a lady is insulted,&rdquo; said Douglas dryly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course: quite so. If it had been Mrs. Sparrow now, I should have forgotten my  calling. Still we must fight the enemy of evil feelings even against those who  strive to harm us. Good-day: good-day and hope for the best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose,  climbing the hill to Tremore, would have smiled on any other occasion at Mr.  Sparrow&rsquo;s fight between human failings and the divine command to turn the other  cheek to the smiter. But he did not smile, as he was very grateful to the man  for his advocacy, and thought highly of him for standing up so boldly against  public opinion. Sparrow was limited in many ways, but he had a considerable fund  of common sense, which he used to the best advantage. He followed his Master as  best he knew how and was very close to Him in his present attitude, which was  one few men would have assumed in the face of such hostility. Montrose  determined that when his innocence was assured he would repay the vicar in one  way or another. Meanwhile he had to deal strenuously with his very disagreeable  situation.</p>
  <p align="left">After  midday Enistor returned and requested an interview with his guest in the  library. The young man appeared, looking haggard and anxious, which was very  natural considering the dangerous position in which he stood. Also he was angry  at not seeing Alice, for by Enistor&rsquo;s orders she was not allowed out of her  bedroom, the housekeeper being on guard. Douglas insisted that he should be  permitted to have a conversation with the girl.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have no right to keep us apart,&rdquo; said Montrose indignantly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Until  you clear your character I have,&rdquo; said Enistor coldly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  you don&rsquo;t think that I am guilty: you can&rsquo;t think so. Why, even Mr. Sparrow,  whom you say is narrow-minded, does not believe that I killed Narvaez.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Sparrow does not know of your visit to the cottage last night. Nor does any one  but myself and my daughter. The Perchton Inspector came with several policemen  and has examined the cottage and the body, and Mrs. Boyce, who looked after  things for Narvaez. She declares that someone called last night, but could not  say who it was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps  Job Trevel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Job  went out fishing last night early and has not returned. Rose was with her  mother all day and all night. Neither of these two can be guilty. And from your  open threats it is said that you struck the blow, or rather broke the man&rsquo;s  neck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not strong enough to do that,&rdquo; said Montrose, looking at his hands.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rage  can make any one strong,&rdquo; said Enistor coolly. &ldquo;And as you had every reason to  be in a rage, seeing that Narvaez told what I believe was a wicked lie, you may  have handled him too roughly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  did not handle him at all. How dare you say so!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  dare me too far, Montrose, or you may suffer. As it is I have a proposition to  make to you. Only Alice and I and you know of your visit to the cottage last  night. Alice because she loves you will hold her tongue. I am willing to do so  also, if you will make over the fortune by deed of gift to me straightaway.  Narvaez&rsquo; lawyer from Perchton came with the police, as it seems my dead friend  has left his money to Hardwick for some reason. It is a vain gift, as Hardwick  is also dead. However, that is not the point. What I mean is that this lawyer  can make out the deed of gift to-day and you can sign it. Then I shall hold my  tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  if I refuse?&rdquo; asked Montrose, seeing himself placed perilously between the  devil and the deep sea.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall then tell how you visited Narvaez last night, and I need hardly inform  you that such an action coupled with your previous threats will bring you  within reasonable distance of the hangman&rsquo;s noose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  nodded and swallowed, as his mouth and throat were very dry. &ldquo;I see my danger.  All the same I decline to give you the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  you must take the consequence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am ready to do so. And I give you the credit of not believing in my guilt or  you would scarcely compound a felony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t know what I would do or what I would not do,&rdquo; said Enistor coolly, &ldquo;as  you know little of my character. But you are in my power to hang, and hanged  you shall be unless you surrender the money. I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; ended the man with  a sneer, &ldquo;that your dear friend Eberstein can aid you in this dilemma. What do  you think yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think nothing about it,&rdquo; rejoined Montrose decisively. &ldquo;I have wired to Dr.  Eberstein to come over, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  he has not yet put in an appearance,&rdquo; interrupted the Squire, with a harsh  laugh. &ldquo;And he never will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  disagree. When he knows of my peril he will come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  knows of your peril without your telling him, if he is the wonderful man you  have made him out to be. However, this is an unprofitable discussion. The  question is, will you give me the money to save your neck?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  said Montrose obstinately.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall give you until six o&rsquo;clock to decide,&rdquo; replied the Squire calmly. &ldquo;And  then, if you still refuse, I shall inform the Inspector about your visit to  Narvaez last night. That will mean your immediate arrest and subsequent  punishment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  will mean the first undoubtedly, but I may escape the second. I trust in God to  prove my innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  age of miracles is past,&rdquo; said Enistor with a shrug, and left the library to  again interview the Inspector.</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  remained where he was wondering why Eberstein did not either come over to help  him, or at least reply to his wire. Enistor&rsquo;s taunt was surely true, for the  young man had sufficient knowledge of Eberstein&rsquo;s wonderful powers to be  certain he was aware of all that had taken place. With his ability to procure  super-physical knowledge, he probably knew who had murdered Narvaez, so he  would surely come to the rescue. But an hour passed and the shadows began to  deepen without any information. Montrose began to feel his spirits sink, and  again tried to invoke the helpful power which had aided him before, but without  success. He felt desperately angry against the Squire for behaving so wickedly,  and resented the hate directed against him. &ldquo;Hate only ceases by love,&rdquo; as  Eberstein had said, but how could he love, or even tolerate, a man who was bent  upon encompassing his destruction. Montrose asked himself this question several  times without getting any reply, and was well nigh in despair, when an  interruption came. This was none other than the unexpected appearance of Alice.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  my dear, my dear,&rdquo; she cried, hastening across the shadowy room to throw  herself into his longing arms. &ldquo;I have been broken-hearted over you, but I  could not get out to see you. Father came some time ago and said that I could  try to persuade you to give up the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  what do you say?&rdquo; Montrose asked her softly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Give  it up: give it up. What does this miserable money matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  care nothing for the money as you well know. But Eberstein told me to keep it,  and I obey him in this as I obey him in all things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  why hasn&rsquo;t he come to help you?&rdquo; sobbed the girl, trembling.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  will come: he will do something. I have every confidence in him. Remember how  he prophesied this woe, and said that we had to learn to walk alone. I can&rsquo;t  believe that one who has helped me so much will desert me in my hour of need.  Depend upon it, Alice, all will be well. What have you got here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is the Bible,&rdquo; she offered him the book. &ldquo;I have been trying to find comfort in  it. But I can&rsquo;t: I can&rsquo;t. Everything seems to be against us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Eberstein  said that it would be,&rdquo; replied her lover gloomily, &ldquo;and he has proved himself  a true prophet. However, we can only wait and let your father do what he wants  to do. I refuse to buy my safety by giving up the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  why not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because  such a surrender would be tantamount to my admitting guilt. Since Job can prove  an alibi I don&rsquo;t know who murdered Narvaez, but I know my own innocence, and am  prepared to face the worst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then&mdash;then&mdash;&rdquo;  faltered Alice with white lips, &ldquo;there is the danger that you may be condemned.  Oh, Douglas, if my father reveals your visit, the evidence is so strong against  you. Why not hide until we can find out the truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Would  you have me sneak away like a cur?&rdquo; cried the young man in high anger. &ldquo;No. I  am innocent and therefore can meet my accusers with a calm mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  the evidence is so strong,&rdquo; pleaded Alice again. &ldquo;If we can only get time to  learn the truth there will be some chance of proving that evidence false.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  can we get time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  must hide, and meanwhile I shall see Dr. Eberstein and search for the person  who is guilty. Oh, if Julian were only alive,&rdquo; moaned Alice, clasping her  hands, &ldquo;he would help. But he is dead: dead, and we have no friends to help us  in any way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  have God, and Eberstein who is a servant of God,&rdquo; said Montrose tenderly. &ldquo;Dearest,  I must have faith and so must you. Besides, even if I did hide I know of no  place where I could be concealed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  do,&rdquo; said Alice eagerly, and thinking that this speech was a sign of yielding. &ldquo;There  is a cave in the cliffs some distance away from the jetty where the boats go  out for the fishing. I could guide you there and you could take provisions and  candles and something to drink. There you could wait until things grew quiet,  and with Dr. Eberstein I could find out the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  cave would be discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  I have thought of that. No one but I knows of the cave&mdash;at least I fancy so. I  found it one day by chance. And no one would ever think of looking for you  there. They would never think you had taken refuge in a cave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear, I can&rsquo;t admit guilt by running away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  you don&rsquo;t, my father will destroy you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This  was true enough, and undoubtedly Enistor would press on the charge as strongly  as possible. Montrose wavered. &ldquo;It might be reasonable to gain the delay,&rdquo; he  muttered. &ldquo;Oh, I wish Eberstein were here to advise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As  if in answer to his speech, one of the servants entered with a telegram, which  proved to be from the doctor. Montrose opened it when the maid had left the  room, and found the message rather cryptic: also unsigned, save by the initial &ldquo;E.&rdquo;  It ran: &ldquo;Matthew x. 23, twelve words!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Look  up the text, Alice,&rdquo; said the young man eagerly.</p>
  <p align="left">The  girl, luckily having the Bible with her, rapidly skimmed over the leaves and  took the book to the window to read the small print in the fast-failing light. &ldquo;But  when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another,&rdquo; she read slowly,  and would have continued the verse, but that her lover stopped her with a  gesture.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Those  are the twelve words,&rdquo; he said, folding up the telegram. &ldquo;The rest of the verse  doesn&rsquo;t matter. So Eberstein wants me to fly. I wonder why,&rdquo; and he looked  woefully disappointed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Take  his advice,&rdquo; said Alice eagerly, and glad that such a powerful opinion backed  her up. &ldquo;You always obey him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  All the same I did not think he would tell me to sneak away. It seems to be  cowardly: it seems like admitting guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  said in London that I believed in Dr. Eberstein and I say the same now,  Douglas,&rdquo; was Alice&rsquo;s decided answer. &ldquo;He knows more than we do about things,  as he prophesied that we should have trouble. Do what he says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  frowned and bit his lip, for his faith in the doctor was being sorely tried. He  never expected to get advice coinciding with that of Alice. And the idea of  flight was opposed to his sense of manhood. All the same there was no sense in  being heedlessly rash, and undoubtedly Eberstein must have some powerful reason  to telegraph as he had done. Alice watched his changing face eagerly and  inwardly prayed that he might yield. She saw no safety for the present but in  flight. Finally with a sigh he took her face between his two hands and kissed  her. &ldquo;I shall go to your cave,&rdquo; he murmured, but winced at such resignation to  what he regarded as an ignoble course.</p>
  <p align="left">The  two put the plan into execution at once and stole away across the moor into the  gathering night after certain preparations. In the space of an hour Alice  regained her room, and was apparently innocent of what had taken place. But  Douglas was safe in the unknown cave with a scanty store of food, and wine, and  a few candles.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo;  said Enistor furiously. &ldquo;Then he is guilty after all.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XX"><b>Chapter XX</b></a><b><br>
    The Unexpected</b></h2>
  <p align="left">As  Montrose had stated to Alice, his flight was looked upon as a tacit admission  of guilt. Up to that moment Enistor had not been quite certain that Douglas was  the culprit, as the young man had never given him the impression that he was  one likely to proceed to such extremities. But this sudden disappearance could  only mean that he had done so, therefore Enistor very naturally concluded that  Montrose had been infuriated by Don Pablo&rsquo;s bitter tongue into revenging  himself hastily. Probably he now regretted that haste, but whether he did so or  not mattered little to the Squire. All that the master of Tremore knew was that  his enemy was now at his mercy, and he intended to take full advantage of the  opportunity. His first step was to inform the Perchton Inspector of that fatal  visit to the cottage.</p>
  <p align="left">Then,  very speedily, the hue and cry was out, and for miles round the police explored  the country. There was no doubt in any one&rsquo;s mind as to the actual truth. The  threats of Montrose, his presence at the cottage at the time when the crime had  taken place, and now the unexpected disappearance&mdash;these things showed that  Douglas and none other was the guilty person. The next day every one was  searching far and wide for the criminal, and Enistor was so vindictive that he  offered a reward he could ill afford for the capture of the unfortunate young  man. This he did to gratify the hatred which had existed for many incarnations,  and also because he believed that when Montrose found it was impossible to  escape the gallows, he would make over his wrongfully inherited money to Alice.  And once Alice was in possession of the income, her father felt convinced that  he would be able to handle the same. It was a very plausible plan, and Enistor  worked hard to carry it out.</p>
  <p align="left">As  Alice had come and gone in the space of an hour, and her absence had not been  noticed, save by the housekeeper, the Squire was far from suspecting that his  daughter had organised the flight and selected the hiding-place. As to the  housekeeper, she was quite on the side of the lovers, since she did not believe  for one moment that a nice young gentleman like Montrose had so vilely murdered  Don Pablo. Therefore she procured the food and wine and the candles which  Montrose had taken with him, and also promised to hold her tongue in spite of  all temptation. Alice trusted her, and she was right to do so, for the woman  was perfectly staunch. Moreover the girl was glad to have some one to whom she  could talk freely. During those dark days she saw little of her father, but  remained in her bedroom praying constantly for the safety of her lover. It was  a terrible ordeal for one so young and delicate and friendless, but Alice felt  that she was being supported by the Master of Love, and that out of sorrow  would come enduring joy.</p>
  <p align="left">Mrs.  Sparrow came to see her, and the narrow-minded grey woman proved to be  unusually sympathetic. Neither she nor her husband could bring themselves to  believe that Douglas was guilty, in spite of all evidence to the contrary, and  for this loyal support Alice was duly grateful. Of course the vicar&rsquo;s wife was  excessively aggravating with her platitudes, which did not give much comfort. &ldquo;All  is for the best!&rdquo; &ldquo;We must not murmur at the rod!&rdquo; &ldquo;It is for your good that  you suffer!&rdquo;&mdash;these cut-and-dried phrases dropped incessantly from Mrs. Sparrow&rsquo;s  prim lips, and wrought on Alice&rsquo;s nerves to such an extent that sometimes she  could have screamed. But knowing that the grey woman meant well, and  appreciating her defence of Montrose, the girl controlled her feelings, and accepted  these exasperating condolences as genuine, which they assuredly were. But she  longed for the presence of Dr. Eberstein and wondered why he did not put in an  appearance. Yet he remained absent and silent, not even sending a letter to  comfort her in trouble. Still Alice had such a belief in the man that she did  not resent his apparent neglect. All the same, her faith was being sorely  tried.</p>
  <p align="left">Job  Trevel did not return. According to his mother he had gone away in his boat to  the fishing-grounds at six o&rsquo;clock on the evening of the murder. No one  therefore could suspect that he had anything to do with the matter, but the  Polwellin folk wondered at his absence. Rose could give no explanation, as the  death of her patron caused her so much grief that she took to her bed. There  was no chance now that she would go to London and appear on the stage, and  beyond possessing some jewels and a few articles of costly clothing, she had  benefited little by Don Pablo&rsquo;s sinister friendship. She would not even have  his name mentioned, and now that the man was dead both Dame Trevel and Mrs.  Penwin hoped that Rose would marry Job and settle down. The gaudy bubble blown  by Narvaez had burst, and the disappointed beauty had to do the best she could.  Therefore, she and the two old women looked forward to the return of Job as the  best thing that could happen to put the crooked straight. And as the weather  had been stormy, it was presumed that Job had been driven for shelter into some  distant cove, whence he would come back in due time.</p>
  <p align="left">Polwellin  was quite excited over the tragic events which had taken place, and the village  was in a ferment over the possibility of this person and that gaining the  reward offered by the Squire. But although every acre of the moorland was  searched the fugitive could not be discovered. It was over forty-eight hours  before the first clue was found, and that clue came from a quarter least  expected. Also it was given to the man who most wanted to learn the whereabouts  of Montrose, on the second day after the commission of the crime. Enistor was  the man, and Mr. Sparrow was the person who put him into communication with the  individual who afforded the desired information.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  most wonderful thing has happened, Mr. Enistor,&rdquo; said the vicar, entering the  library on the afternoon of the second day. &ldquo;The age of miracles is not yet  past, my dear friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  scowled. He did not like to be called a dear friend by the parson, as he  thought the man was an ass, and he was quite sure in his own mind that miracles  were all rubbish. He told Mr. Sparrow as much. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t Palestine to be  gulled by such things, and we live in a scientific era.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  a very godless era,&rdquo; said the vicar in a tone of reproof. &ldquo;And I only hope that  the wonderful thing that has happened will convert those who do not believe in  an Almighty Being to a more reverent frame of mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This  was a hit at the Squire, who was looked upon as an atheist by Mr. Sparrow. But  Enistor did not take up the challenge. &ldquo;What is your miracle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Hardwick is alive.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  the Squire could not but feel startled at the announcement.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah,  I thought you would be amazed,&rdquo; said Mr. Sparrow complacently. &ldquo;Wonderful are  the works of God and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  hang your platitudes! You talk rubbish. Why, you told me yourself that Hardwick  was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  did. I saw him lying dead on his bed, and mentioned to Mr. Montrose that he  looked as though he were asleep. It might be a case of suspended animation,&rdquo;  continued Mr. Sparrow, brushing his bald head thoughtfully, &ldquo;something of a cataleptic  nature it may be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well?  Well? Well? Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is nothing further to say, Mr. Enistor. The presumed dead man revived this  morning and is now as well as you or I. I was sent for immediately by the  landlady and called to express my astonishment. I have telegraphed for the  Perchton doctor who deposed to the death. He will be amazed to learn what has  taken place. Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is no doubt a case of catalepsy as you say,&rdquo; growled the Squire, turning to his  desk again. &ldquo;A good thing for Hardwick that he wasn&rsquo;t buried alive. Now he can  enjoy Narvaez&rsquo; fortune and have a good time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  hope he will be a good man, seeing that he has been raised from the dead like  Lazarus. Not that Mr. Hardwick was bad. Indeed I always thought that he had  signs of grace about him. Well! Well! His resurrection gives me a text for next  Sunday. I thought you would be pleased.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am not pleased and I am not sorry,&rdquo; retorted Enistor. &ldquo;Hardwick is a nonentity  and is nothing to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  thought you were friends, Mr. Enistor. He asks to see you, saying that he is  sure you will come down to him at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  presumes too much. I have quite enough to do in searching for this scoundrel  who murdered my dear friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe he did,&rdquo; said Sparrow decidedly. &ldquo;Mr. Montrose is not the man to  shed blood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the Squire grimly, &ldquo;he broke the man&rsquo;s neck. And if he did not  murder Narvaez, who did? Not Job Trevel, who was the other person who uttered  threats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is a great mystery,&rdquo; sighed the vicar, putting on his hat.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Like  this confounded resurrection of Hardwick. Why the deuce couldn&rsquo;t he stay in the  next world after taking the trouble to go there? He&rsquo;s not much use in this one  so far as I can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Question  not the decrees of the Almighty,&rdquo; said Mr. Sparrow rebukingly. &ldquo;But there: I am  speaking to a deaf adder. May I see Miss Enistor to comfort her and offer up a  prayer in her present sorrow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.  She&rsquo;s moping in her room and behaving like a fool. Offer up what prayers you  like: they won&rsquo;t do any good. It is all her folly in getting engaged to that  young criminal that has brought things to this pass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Montrose is innocent,&rdquo; said Sparrow obstinately, &ldquo;and in due time God will  prove his innocence. I wish you a softer heart, Mr. Enistor, and good-day,&rdquo; and  the worthy parson stalked out of the room to seek Alice and console her.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  did not resume his work immediately. It had to do with the disappearance of  Montrose, as he was writing to the Perchton Inspector. Before the entrance of  Sparrow with his wonderful news, the work had seemed very important, but now  Enistor felt inclined to lay it aside and seek the lodgings of the artist.  Certainly it was wonderful that Hardwick should recover, after he had been  lying dead&mdash;as the doctor insisted&mdash;for so long a time. Undoubtedly it was a case  of catalepsy, and Enistor felt curious to see the man who had been so nearly  buried alive. His sister was due the next day to see about the funeral, and  Enistor laughed when he thought how the frivolous little woman would be  surprised. Disappointed also it might be, as she, being the next of kin, would  have enjoyed Narvaez&rsquo; money had her brother really passed away. It was all very  strange, and after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation the Squire put on his cap and walked down  to Polwellin. He would see for himself what had taken place, and would question  Hardwick concerning what he had seen during his trance. For trance it was the  Squire felt sure, and the recovery&mdash;in his opinion&mdash;was a perfectly natural one.</p>
  <p align="left">There  was quite a crowd round the lodging, and Hardwick&rsquo;s landlady was recounting her  feelings when the dead man had come to life. She certainly looked as though she  had sustained a shock, and seemed rather disappointed that there was to be no  funeral. Enistor listened grimly to her incoherent explanations, then pushed  his way into the house and sought the artist&rsquo;s sitting-room. He found Hardwick  dressed in his usual clothes and presenting an unusually vigorous appearance.  His face was more highly coloured, his eyes were full of fire, and he moved  about with the swift grace of a panther, alert, vital, impetuously and  wonderfully alive. Enistor stared in amazement at the sight. Never had he seen  before so splendid and powerful a man, or one so charged with life-force.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dying  seems to have done you good, Hardwick,&rdquo; he observed dryly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  looks like it,&rdquo; replied the other, and although he spoke in his usual mellow  voice, the Squire pricked up his ears and looked at him inquiringly. The tone  was more imperious than that ordinarily used by Hardwick, and had in it a  dominant, crushing quality which startled the visitor.</p>
  <p align="left">The  two men stared hard at one another. Hardwick took up his position on the  hearth-rug, leaning easily against the mantelpiece, while Enistor took  possession of a deep arm-chair near the window. The door was closed, as was the  window, so they were quite alone; entirely free from observation and  eavesdropping. The Squire felt that in spite of Hardwick&rsquo;s late cataleptic  trance the artist was more alive than he was, since wave after wave of powerful  animal vitality seemed to emanate from him and fill the little room. Then  Enistor cried out with sudden terror.</p>
  <p align="left">He  had reason to do so. Every nerve in his body was aching with agony, and every  muscle was twisted with pain. Some force ran through his frame like fire,  excruciating, insistent and terrible. He could not rise from the chair, he  could not even move a finger, but lay where he was inert and helpless, with  that devouring flame tormenting him to madness. And indeed Enistor wondered why  he did not go mad with the frenzy of pain, while Hardwick smiled on him quietly  and calmly and unwinkingly, like an avenging god. After that one cry the  miserable man uttered no other. He felt that it would be useless to protest in  any weak human way. He was in the grip of a tremendous force and as helpless as  a fly in the claws of a spider.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think you will taunt me any more with the loss of my power,&rdquo; said  Hardwick suavely. &ldquo;I am a fraud, am I? my will has been shattered? Eh? How do  you like that, my dear friend?&rdquo; and again there came another surge of the  biting fire, which caused the perspiration to break out on Enistor&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who&mdash;who&mdash;who  are you?&rdquo; stammered the Squire brokenly. He was beginning to have an inkling of  the appalling truth, for he well knew that only one man&mdash;if man he were&mdash;could  exercise such devilish power.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think you can tell me that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Narvaez!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;  The magician withdrew his intense gaze, and loosened his victim from the bonds  of torment, then sat down quietly, smiling and bland. &ldquo;I think you have had  enough proof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  feebly moved his limbs and wiped his forehead with his pocket-handkerchief. His  mouth was so dry that he could scarcely speak, and he thankfully poured out a  glass of water from a carafe which was on the table. As he drank, a delicious  sense of freedom from pain passed through him, and he knew that the man  lounging in the chair was curing what he had hurt. &ldquo;I have had enough proof,&rdquo;  gasped Enistor, setting down the empty glass. &ldquo;You are Don Pablo in Hardwick&rsquo;s  body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  I am very well satisfied with my new suit of clothes,&rdquo; said the other, looking  at his limbs complacently. &ldquo;Hardwick&rsquo;s retiring soul left its earthly vehicle  in good order. The organs are all sound, the blood is of the best, and the  whole mechanism only needed the extra vitality which I am able to supply.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  can you get the vitality?&rdquo; asked Enistor rather nervously, for the sight before  him was enough to shake an ordinary man to the core of his being.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never  mind. I know how to tap the source of life and use what I will. Hardwick could  not do that, being ignorant, therefore he died from sheer lack of vitality. A  lucky thing for me, as it gave me a chance of replacing my worn-out body with  this very splendid instrument.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did  you kill Hardwick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  There was no need to kill him. His Ego had been drawing the soul back for a  long time, and knowing that he would soon die, I made my arrangements  accordingly so as to enter the body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  your lie to lure Montrose to the cottage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was a lie&mdash;in  your interest,&rdquo; said Narvaez-Hardwick coolly. &ldquo;It was necessary that Montrose  should be there so as to be inculpated in my death. Do you understand now why I  insulted Alice so that Montrose might publicly quarrel with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  The Squire turned pale as he began to comprehend the infernal ingenuity with  which the magician had wrought out his scheme. &ldquo;Then Montrose is not the guilty  man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No  more than you are. My insult to your daughter was a comedy to deceive the  public as to Montrose&rsquo;s feelings towards me. My behaviour when you called to  taunt me was part of the same comedy. I think I played my part excellently  well, Enistor, or you would have been afraid to say what you did. I suppose you  are now convinced that I still have my powers: if not&mdash;&rdquo; he leaned forward to  fix the other man with his eye.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  No! No, I am quite convinced,&rdquo; and Enistor cowered in his chair. &ldquo;You are  Narvaez true enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To  you and to The Adversary whom no disguise can deceive. But the rest of the  world will know me as Julian Hardwick. When Montrose is disposed of, my friend,  I can then marry Alice as arranged. She was not averse to becoming Hardwick&rsquo;s  wife, so there will be no difficulty over that. And I am still rich, as I made  over all my fortune by will to Hardwick, and inherit my own money. I have sent  for the lawyer, who will come and see me to-morrow to arrange about the  transfer of the property when my late body is buried. And I think,&rdquo; ended  Narvaez-Hardwick pensively, &ldquo;that I shall follow the corpse of my benefactor to  the grave. Grace my own funeral,&rdquo; he laughed, much amused.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where  is Hardwick&rsquo;s soul?&rdquo; stammered Enistor, who felt the hair of his head rising  with the natural terror of the human for the superhuman.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Purging  its baser qualities on the Astral Plane,&rdquo; said the other carelessly. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t  stay long there, as he was such a pious ass he will probably get his share of  heaven before long. I am not interested in him. I have done him no harm in  taking his body. It was useless to him and is useful to me. Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez-Hardwick  rose and stretched himself. &ldquo;It is splendid to have so magnificent a vehicle.  In it I shall live years and years gaining wider and wider knowledge to extend  my empire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  the Great Power that struck you down and warned you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hold  your tongue,&rdquo; snarled the magician, with a look which transformed the kindly  face of Hardwick into the semblance of a fiend. &ldquo;Leave me to deal with powers  higher or lower as the case may be. I have held my own for centuries against  all. Are you about to become a pupil of The Adversary as I suggested when you  taunted me in the cottage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  And yet The Adversary has greater power than you have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a lie,&rdquo; shouted Narvaez-Hardwick imperiously. &ldquo;What struck me down was a much  Mightier Power, which I don&rsquo;t choose to name. I told you that before. Hold to  me, Enistor, and I can give you the kingdoms of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At  what price?&rdquo; Enistor shivered at the look on the other&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  know the price. You must give me Alice for my wife, and you must obey me in  every way. I cannot instruct you unless you do. And now that Montrose is in  your power and has to pay back the life he took from you in Chaldea, you can  force him to give up the fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  refuses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  dare not refuse if he wants to save his neck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  is he guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Narvaez-Hardwick laughed contemptuously. &ldquo;You might have guessed that no pupil  of The Adversary would be bold enough to commit murder. He is full of silly  scruples. You know who killed me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  you are a fool,&rdquo; said the magician roundly. &ldquo;Job Trevel is the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  started from his chair. &ldquo;Impossible! Job was away in his&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Job  was at the cottage on the evening when I died,&rdquo; interrupted Narvaez-Hardwick  grimly. &ldquo;I sent for Rose Penwin to come and see me some time after eight,  knowing that Job would follow. I contrived to let him know by impressing a  message on his foolish brain. He really was going out in his boat, and at six  was about to start when he felt compelled to come to the cottage. He saw Rose  on the moor and followed her. By that time I had drawn Montrose to the cottage,  so as to incriminate him, and you know the means I used. After I had confessed  that I had told a lie about the marriage he went away, and I saw Rose, to talk  nonsense and rouse Job&rsquo;s jealousy. I went with her to the gate and kissed her  there. She didn&rsquo;t mind, as I was an old man and had promised she should go to  London next week. Job was waiting for her at the gate, having seen her enter  the cottage. Then he sprang on me and broke my neck. After that Rose ran away  and Job returned to his boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  has not come back yet,&rdquo; said Enistor, horror-struck at the callous way in which  Narvaez-Hardwick detailed his wickedness.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor  will he. He fears lest the truth should come to light and he should be hanged  for my murder. Rose knows, but for her own sake she will hold her tongue. So  you see that Montrose cannot escape. He can offer no defence and must be  hanged. Go to him and offer him his life on condition that he surrenders the fortune.  Then hang him, or pardon him if you will. I don&rsquo;t care in the least. You are  bound to me by stronger bonds when the money is gained, and as Julian Hardwick  I shall marry Alice and train her as a clairvoyante. We shall go to Spain,  where I have my home, as Narvaez, and which as Julian Hardwick I inherit. I  think I have managed everything very cleverly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  faltered Enistor, awed by the power and frightened by the unscrupulous cruelty  of this strange being. &ldquo;But Montrose has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez-Hardwick  frowned. &ldquo;I know that, but I don&rsquo;t know where he is. I have searched and  searched without success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  you have not yet been out of doors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  fool, have I no means of searching other than in the physical?&rdquo; cried the man  wrathfully. &ldquo;I have been looking for him from the other side. It is as easy for  me to use my astral body as this physical one. But The Adversary has placed a  veil round him. I cannot see where he is. Still Alice knows; I am certain of  that. She will want to see him: follow her, and then deal with the man as you  will. I have placed him at your mercy. But I am bound to say that this would  not have been the case had he not killed you in Chaldea, my friend. The  Adversary would have interfered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  may interfere now,&rdquo; said Enistor, rising slowly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  cannot. Montrose owes you the life of which he robbed you. You can do what you  like. Where he is I cannot tell, as he is protected so far. But his evil Karma  is too powerful for this protection to continue. He must work out his fate.  Follow Alice: she will lead you to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am sure Alice does not know, Narvaez.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Call  me Hardwick, you fool, else you will be considered a lunatic and will be shut  up for one. Alice does know. This much I am aware of. She assisted him to fly:  she knows where he is hidden. Now I think that is all I have to see you about.  You can go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor&rsquo;s  pride revolted at being ordered about like a dog. &ldquo;I wish you would speak more  civilly, Hardwick,&rdquo; he said, scowling.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  spoke civilly to me when you thought I had lost my power, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; jeered  the other. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bend your brows at me, or I shall make you suffer. I have  done much for you and expect repayment. Nothing for nothing is the rule of the  Left-hand Path.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like to kill you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  my dog is showing his teeth, is he? Take care! I have shown you what I can do.  If you want to be shown further&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  No!&rdquo; Enistor winced at the thought of again enduring that cruel pain.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  obey me. Go away and watch Alice so that she may unknowingly lead you to  Montrose&rsquo;s burrow. When he is found come to me again. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  gnashed his teeth at the insults hurled at him, but being in the grip of a  greater force than he had within himself, there was nothing for it but to  yield. He departed with a gloomy face, to carry out his orders. Narvaez, in the  splendid body of Hardwick, rejoiced with unholy glee.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am winning,&rdquo; he cried exultingly. &ldquo;Winning all along the line.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XXI"><b>Chapter XXI</b></a><b><br>
    The Choice</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Enistor  returned to Tremore in a black silent rage, wishing heartily that he could find  some one with whom to discuss the position in which he found himself. But there  was no one, as the mere statement that Narvaez had taken possession of Hardwick&rsquo;s  body would be scouted by the most credulous. There were some things which could  not possibly be believed, and this was one of them. The present generation was  too material to entertain, for a single moment, so wild an idea, and Enistor  knew&mdash;as his master had warned him&mdash;that he ran a very good chance of being  locked up as a lunatic, if he even hinted at the astounding truth. Thus the  Squire&rsquo;s dabbling in unholy matters had isolated him from his fellow-creatures,  and, at the moment, he felt the deprivation keenly. There was nothing he could  do but shut himself up in his library and think over his position.</p>
  <p align="left">It  was not a pleasant one. By his own acts in this and previous lives he had  committed himself to bondage, and was treated like a slave who had no rights of  his own. What a fool he had been to doubt Narvaez&rsquo; power, since again and again  he had received proofs of it. On the evil hill beside the Druidical altar he  had seen with other than physical eyes the terrible elemental creatures which  Don Pablo could evoke, and whom he controlled by his powerful will. Any doctor  would have told him that it was a case of mere hallucination brought about by  the hypnotic suggestion of certain weird ceremonies. But the Squire knew  better. There were ways of entering the invisible world which interpenetrates  the visible sphere, and Narvaez, by centuries of study and training, had  learned how to open the door. He had flung it wide to his pupil, but it could  not be closed again, as Enistor did not know the necessary conjuration. This in  itself showed the man how impossible it was for his ignorance to cope with the  knowledge of Don Pablo.</p>
  <p align="left">And  now that the magician&rsquo;s black arts had secured a new body, the perfection of  which assured him a valuable instrument for many years wherewith to rule on the  physical plane, Enistor saw painfully clearly that he would be more of a slave  to him than ever. He had to obey Narvaez, as he had ample proof of how the man  could enforce his will by inflicting torments. For the first time, therefore,  the Squire began to consider how he could escape from his thraldom, and  ruefully confessed the truth of the significant text, &ldquo;The way of the  transgressor is hard!&rdquo; Had Enistor been master instead of slave he would not  have troubled about the saying, but being at the beck and call of a merciless  tyrant, he wondered why he had been such a fool as to take the Left-hand Path.  So far as he could see there was no chance of retracing his steps.</p>
  <p align="left">Yet  he had one great hope. With his own eyes he had seen the powerful Lord of the  Dark Face struck down in the moment of his wicked triumph, so there was no doubt  that the Power of Good was infinitely greater than the Power of Evil. It was in  Enistor&rsquo;s mind to seek out Eberstein and ask for his assistance. The doctor  knew as much about the unseen as Narvaez, and perhaps more, since he was in  communication with higher planes than the magician could reach. Undoubtedly,  Eberstein, always bent upon doing good, would willingly give his aid, but the  price demanded would be the renunciation of revenge. That price the Squire felt  that he could not pay, especially now, when Montrose lay at his mercy. The  death in Chaldea he might overlook, since it was more or less, to the  conception of his physical brain, the figment of a vision. But the money which  Montrose unjustly withheld could not be given up, as Enistor needed it desperately  to forward his plans for success in the social and political worlds. Therefore  he did not seek out Eberstein, as the price which the doctor would ask for  giving aid was too great. When the Squire came to this conclusion he heard a  faint regretful sigh, which startled him not a little. There was no one in the  library and both door and windows were closed. Yet the sound was quite  distinct, and Enistor ardently wished that he was sufficiently clairvoyant to  see who was present. In a fanciful moment he wondered if his guardian angel had  taken his departure, seeing that it was hopeless to induce him to turn from  evil to good. But the idea was ridiculous, as the Squire could see no use in  anything that did not benefit himself. He rose to his feet fully determined to  find Montrose and give him his choice of life or death. If the young man  surrendered the money he would be permitted to escape; if he declined, then an  uncomfortable death awaited him at no very distant date. Enistor felt quite  virtuous in offering the alternative, as he considered that he was giving  Montrose a chance of salvation which the man would be foolish not to accept.</p>
  <p align="left">As  to Narvaez, Enistor hoped that shortly the magician&mdash;physically at all  events&mdash;would remove himself from his path. If Montrose would only act sensibly  and escape to Australia or America, after giving up the fortune, then Alice  could marry Don Pablo, and go with him to Spain. Thus Enistor would be left  free from all domestic relations and with five thousand a year to act as his  ambition urged him. And of course the girl would think she was marrying Julian,  for whom she had a great regard; so, failing the fugitive becoming her husband,  which on the face of it was impossible, Narvaez, in the body of Hardwick, would  have little difficulty in gaining his ends. In this way everything would be  very nicely arranged and he could dispense with the assistance of Eberstein. In  his insane egotism, strengthened by the wicked teaching of Don Pablo, the  Squire never gave a thought to the idea that he was deliberately ruining an  innocent man. He was too imbued with the iron rule of the Left-hand Path to  flinch at such villainy, and considered that the weaker must give way to the  stronger. That was only fair and logical. The irony of this thought was that  Enistor, as inferior to Don Pablo, did not wish to submit to him, although the  strength of the latter compelled him to do so. Yet he was exercising towards  Montrose the very tyranny he resented being exercised towards himself. But no  amount of argument could have convinced Enistor that he was illogical.</p>
  <p align="left">At  afternoon tea Alice made her appearance, looking anxious but determined, since  her faith in Eberstein, and in the Great Master of Eberstein, braced her to  face the worst serenely. Things were dreadfully tangled, the outlook was black,  and, humanly speaking, it seemed that there was no possible chance of happiness  for herself and her lover. But since the doctor had foretold not only the  coming of calamity, but the passing of the same, if bravely endured, Alice was  perfectly certain in her own mind that in some mysterious way God would answer  her constant prayers for joy and peace. Thus, although she was pale, her eyes  were bright and steady, and she behaved in a calm reasonable manner, as though  everything went well with her. Enistor marvelled at her composure, and would  have dearly loved to shake it by announcing that he knew she had contrived the  flight of Montrose. But this he could not do lest he should place the girl on  her guard. Therefore he said nothing, having arranged mentally to follow her  when she stole out to seek the hiding-place. &ldquo;There is no news of that young  scoundrel,&rdquo; said Enistor, unable to withstand the gibe. &ldquo;He has concealed  himself very cleverly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Douglas  is no scoundrel,&rdquo; said Alice steadily; &ldquo;circumstances are against him, and he  does well to hide, seeing how bitter you are against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  lie set forth in bad English,&rdquo; sneered the Squire. &ldquo;He is a scoundrel, as every  murderer is, and I am not bitter against him. I only wish to see justice done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  care nothing for justice, father. All you wish is to use this accusation to  force Douglas to give up Aunt Lucy&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are very impertinent, but you speak truly enough. My main desire is to get that  money, and unless Montrose surrenders it he shall hang.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  will have to catch him first,&rdquo; said the girl coldly, but said no more. For her  father was behaving so wickedly in her opinion that she found it difficult to  speak to him with any degree of civility.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  peered at her from under his strongly marked eyebrows and scowled in a menacing  manner. It occurred to him that she might have gone to see Montrose during the  afternoon, in which event she would assuredly not seek him after dark, and  therefore he would not be able to follow her to the hiding-place. &ldquo;Where have  you been these last few hours?&rdquo; he asked acidly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  went to see Rose Penwin, who is ill,&rdquo; said Alice quietly.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor,  bearing in mind what Narvaez had stated, started violently. &ldquo;What did she tell  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing!  What is there she could tell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;One  never knows what a silly girl like that will say,&rdquo; retorted the Squire,  reassured that the secret of the murder was safe. &ldquo;What else have you done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  saw Dame Trevel and learned that Job had not yet returned. Then, as I was told  how Julian had recovered from his cataleptic trance, I called on him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  must have gone to his lodgings immediately after I left,&rdquo; said Enistor quickly.  &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you think his recovery is wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  Mr. Sparrow said the doctor was sure Julian was dead, so it is little less than  a miracle that he is alive and well. But&mdash;&rdquo; Alice hesitated, and looked highly  perplexed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Julian  is different from what he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  a way I admit that, Alice. He has more strength. It is a wonderful recovery,  and I expect the case will be reported in The Lancet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean that exactly,&rdquo; replied the girl reluctantly; &ldquo;but somehow Julian is  quite different. I liked him very much, as he was always so good and kind,&rdquo; she  hesitated again, then ended abruptly: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rather  whimsical, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; said her father tartly, and wondering if the girl&rsquo;s  intuition had informed her of the marvellous truth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  suppose it is,&rdquo; said his daughter wearily; &ldquo;but whatever may be the reason  Julian&rsquo;s illness has changed him into something different. I used to be so  happy when with him, but now I shudder in his presence. He has the same  terrifying effect on me that Don Pablo used to have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are talking nonsense,&rdquo; said the Squire roughly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know I am. An illness could not change any one into other than he was. I can&rsquo;t  help my impression all the same. Julian was good, now he is evil. I never wish  to see him again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  is a pity,&rdquo; said the man slowly, &ldquo;for now that Narvaez is dead and Montrose has  proved himself to be unworthy of your hand, I wish you to marry Julian  Hardwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  started to her feet. &ldquo;Never! Never! Never!&rdquo; she cried vehemently.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are capricious, my dear. You were willing enough to marry Julian rather than Don  Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  two evils I chose the least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  shall choose the least still, if Julian is the least. I objected to you  marrying him because he was poor. Now that he has inherited the money of  Narvaez he is a good match for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  Alice struck the table so violently that the cups rattled in the saucers. &ldquo;Douglas  is innocent and Douglas shall be my husband. Even when Julian was his own dear  self I would not have married him after meeting Douglas; much less would I do  so now, when he has changed into something horrid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  saw that she sensed the presence of Don Pablo&rsquo;s black soul in Hardwick&rsquo;s body,  but as she could not explain and would not be believed if she did explain, he  merely laughed at her vehemence. &ldquo;You are a silly girl to talk in this way.  First you like the man, then you don&rsquo;t, and talk of a change which only exists  in your imagination. Are you going mad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  may be,&rdquo; said Alice moodily. &ldquo;I have had enough to send me mad. But you will  understand this, father, that I love Douglas and intend to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This  was her final determination, and before Enistor could argue further she left  the room, fearing a breakdown. When alone she flung herself face downward on  the bed and tried to compose her mind. It was necessary that she should do so,  as late at night she intended to steal out with food for her lover. Her  father&mdash;as she thought&mdash;would never suspect her, and she could leave the house  when he and the servants were in bed. Already the housekeeper had made up a  bundle, which lay in a convenient cupboard, and would have accompanied her as  chaperon, but that her mistress declined such companionship. Montrose was  nearer at hand than any one suspected, so it was just as well that as few  people as possible should seek the hiding-place. Alice, nerved by love to walk  the lonely moors in the chilly gloom, intended to go alone, and in holding to  this resolve became more heroic than she ever thought she could be. But in her  heart perfect love had cast out fear, and she would have faced an army to  succour the man she intended to marry.</p>
  <p align="left">The  dinner was quiet and the evening was quiet, as Enistor spoke little and Alice  was not inclined for conversation. Indeed there was nothing to say, as father  and daughter were silently hostile to one another. Owing to the Squire&rsquo;s want  of paternal affection they never had been friendly, and now that he wished to  ruin her life by handing over Montrose to the police, Alice felt that she hated  her father. Eberstein would have told her that it was wrong to do so, even in  the face of excellent reasons. But Eberstein was absent and silent, so in this  dark hour the girl had to fight entirely unaided. As a matter of fact, she was  being guided along the dreadful path skilfully, and her every movement was  being watched, as her every thought was known to her guardian. But her  clairvoyant power being in abeyance, she did not guess this, and so far as she  was aware, only the strength of her love for Douglas enabled her to battle  against the dark influences which tried hard to sap her strength.</p>
  <p align="left">When  Enistor retired to his library, Alice excused herself on the plea of a bad  headache and went to her room. There she sat in the faint light of a solitary  candle sending loving thoughts to the lonely lover in the cave under the  cliffs. Nine o&rsquo;clock struck and then ten, but it was not until eleven that the  house became dark and quiet. A stolen visit to the library assured her that her  father had gone to rest, so, thinking that all was well, the girl put on a warm  cloak with a hood and took the basket, to leave by a side door which the  housekeeper had left unlatched. In ten minutes she was through the darkling  wood and on the bare spaces of the moor. But she did not see that her father  was following with the skill of a Redskin on the trail. Enistor had watched and  waited pertinaciously, and had little difficulty in getting on the track.</p>
  <p align="left">It  was a stormy, blowy night, with a mighty wind rushing inward from the sea, and  Alice struggled against the blast incessantly on her way to the cliffs. Every  now and then there was a lull and she could hear the clamour of the waves and  the thunder of the waters hammering against the rocks. In the vast hollow of  the sky, black clouds were hurtling across the firmament at tremendous speed,  unveiling every now and then a haggard moon, full-orbed yet with waning fire.  It was a Walpurgis night, when warlocks and witches should have been abroad,  rather than this delicately nurtured girl, made heroic by love. Enistor,  toiling after her at a distance, wondered at a strength of character which he  had been far from thinking his daughter possessed, and laughed grimly to think  that unknowingly she was placing her lover within reach of the gripping hands  of justice. Amidst the clash and clang of the elemental forces the girl, on her  mission of love, and the man, on his errand of vengeance, staggered across the  waste land drenched by the fierce rain and buffeted by the roaring winds.  Occasionally a zigzag flash cut through the inky clouds, but the subsequent  thunder was almost lost in the furious crying of sea and wind. Great as was the  hate of Enistor to enable him to face such forces, greater was the love which  strengthened Alice to attempt such a task of high endeavour.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  led her father down to the very verge of the cliffs, and halted there a stone&rsquo;s-throw  from the coastguard station. Lurking in the background, the Squire strained his  eyes to see her, and did see her, a momentarily clear silhouette against the  pale illumination of the horizon, where the moonlight struggled to assert  itself. Then a big black cloud drove ponderously across the moon, and when it  passed, Alice was no longer to be seen. In some way she had descended the  cliffs, and a cold feeling of fear lest she should fall and be dashed to pieces  gripped Enistor&rsquo;s heart, rather to his surprise. He had never thought that he  possessed sufficient love for Alice to make him wince in this way. But the love  was evidently latent in him, and sent the man pell-mell towards the lip of the  land to stay the girl from her rash adventure.</p>
  <p align="left">Bending  over to look into the seething hell of water below, which bubbled and boiled  like a witches&rsquo; cauldron, Enistor caught sight, in the fitful moonlight, of a  tiny dark figure dropping down to some unknown destination. Alice was safe as  yet in spite of the fury of wind and wave, and scrambled down a narrow track  with the sure-footedness of a goat. Not for nothing had she adventured her life  in hazardous ways during the past year, and now the nerve she had gained came  in useful when her lover&rsquo;s neck was in danger. She did not think of her own at  the moment, but Enistor&rsquo;s heart was in his mouth, as the saying is, as he lay  on his stomach peering down at the daring girl. Then a turn of the path below  concealed the clambering figure from his eyes, and he debated within himself as  to the best course to adopt. He was surprised to think that Montrose was  concealed so near to the coastguard station, and no great distance from Tremore  itself. But in the very daring of selecting so dangerous a hiding-place lay its  safety, as he soon came to comprehend. But what Alice with her youth and  lightness could do Enistor did not dare to attempt. He decided to wait until  she came up the cliff again, and then he could force her to reveal the exact  spot where Montrose lay hidden. Rolling into the shelter of a venturesome gorse  bush which grew near the verge, he kept his eyes partly on the light of the not  far distant station and partly on the place where the girl had descended. In  this way he hoped to seize his daughter and to guard against being surprised by  the Navy men, although these latter would be useful at a pinch to arrest the  fugitive, when Alice was forced to reveal the truth. So Enistor lay there and  the rain beat upon him, the wind blew, and the thunder rolled overhead a  challenge to the tumult of the waves below.</p>
  <p align="left">Meanwhile  Alice, never suspecting that she had led her father to within a stone&rsquo;s-throw  of her lover&rsquo;s lurking-place, swung still further downward from the point where  Enistor had lost sight of her. Finally the path, which was a mere goat&rsquo;s track,  excessively narrow and dangerous, terminated in a small jagged hole no very  great distance up the cliff from the sands and rocks below. It was marked by  bushes, and would have passed unnoticed even by an experienced climber. The  girl had found it during a day in spring, never thinking that it would ever be  required for the purpose for which it was now being used. Speedily thrusting  herself into this rabbit-burrow, as it might be called, she scrambled on hands and  knees along a narrow passage until she emerged into a fair-sized cave. There  she saw Montrose ready to greet her with a candle in his hand, and this he soon  put down to take her in his arms. &ldquo;My darling! My darling! How brave you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  my dear! My dear! My dearest!&rdquo; She could only cling to him and kiss him and  feel that she had reached the heaven of his embrace. &ldquo;You are trembling!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  lighted another candle from the stock she had brought and made her sit down on  a block of stone fallen from the roof. &ldquo;No wonder I tremble when I think of you  climbing down that terrible cliff. You must not do it again. Do you hear? I  would rather give myself up than expose you to such a risk. You might fall and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  stopped his protestations with a kiss. &ldquo;I shall not fall. Again and again I  have gone down that path out of a spirit of sheer adventure. Shall I then not  come when your life depends upon my coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  never was such a woman as you are,&rdquo; cried Douglas brokenly, &ldquo;but oh, my darling  heart, how can you love me when I lurk here so shamefully?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are doing right. Dr. Eberstein said that you were to fly. When the truth comes  to light you can reappear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will  it ever come to light?&rdquo; questioned Montrose uneasily. &ldquo;Everything is dead  against me. I must stay here for ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  will not stay here for ever!&rdquo; said a quiet steady voice, and the lovers turned  their heads with a start to see Eberstein standing some little distance away,  calm, benevolent, and encouraging as he ever was.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  cried out with natural terror at the sudden appearance of a man whom they  supposed to be miles away, and Montrose, thrilled with the deadly fear of the  supernatural, could scarcely speak. &ldquo;How&mdash;how&mdash;did&mdash;you&mdash;come here?&rdquo; he gasped,  holding Alice tightly to his breast.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  a way you know not,&rdquo; replied Eberstein, smiling so kindly as to strengthen  both. &ldquo;My true physical body is asleep in the hotel at Perchton. This I use now  is one created for the moment, so that I may be seen and heard to speak by you  both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">But  for that reassuring smile and their knowledge of Eberstein&rsquo;s goodwill the  lovers would have been terrified out of their lives. &ldquo;But you are&mdash;you are flesh  and blood,&rdquo; stammered Alice nervously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  one way, yes: in another way, no. The knowledge of certain laws which has been  entrusted to me enables me to materialise myself in this way.&rdquo; He advanced to  place one hand on the girl&rsquo;s shoulder and the other on that of Montrose. &ldquo;You  can feel my touch, can you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  can feel, hear and see,&rdquo; said Douglas, and his inclination was to kneel before  his Master who manifested such power. All fear had departed now both from  himself and Alice. It was as if an angel had come to them.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Kneel  only to God,&rdquo; said Eberstein solemnly. &ldquo;It is His great mercy that permits me  to come to your aid. The moment is at hand which will decide your future&mdash;the  future of you both. Before you, Montrose, will be placed good and evil: as you  choose so shall it be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  shall choose the good,&rdquo; cried the young man impetuously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Be  not over-confident, lest you fall,&rdquo; warned the Master gravely. &ldquo;One whom you  wronged in the past has you at his mercy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  father?&rdquo; questioned Alice, with a gasp.</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  bowed his head. &ldquo;In Chaldea you killed him, Montrose, and therefore you owe him  a life for a life. Humanly speaking you are in his power for the moment, and he  can hand you over to the officers of law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  I am innocent of the crime!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  And he knows that you are innocent. But the teaching of the son of perdition,  whom you know as Narvaez, has warped his nature, and to gain the money he  claims he will place you, if he can, in the shadow of the gallows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  does not know where I am! He is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo;  The Master raised his arm slowly. &ldquo;What will be, will be as love or hate, fear  or trust triumphs in your breast. Ascend the cliff, alone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Alone!&rdquo;  Alice uttered a shriek. &ldquo;No! No! Let me go also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ascend  the cliff alone,&rdquo; repeated Eberstein calmly, &ldquo;and you, my daughter, kneel here  in prayer that good may triumph over evil. May the will of God be fulfilled,  and may the love of Christ&rdquo;&mdash;he made the sign of the cross&mdash;&ldquo;be with you in the  hour of need, with the saving grace of the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Where  he had been there was but the gloom of the cave faintly illuminated by the  candlelight. Motionless with awe the lovers clung to one another, and Montrose,  looking upward when movement came to him, breathed a voiceless prayer. Then he  bent to kiss Alice, who had sunk on her knees, and loosening his clasp moved  slowly towards the entrance to the cave. She did not seek to stay him, but with  folded hands looked at his retiring form&mdash;it might be for the last time. But as  she looked the exaltation and awe of that solemn moment opened her interior  senses, and she saw a triangle of white flame, which showered on her lover&rsquo;s  head purple rays of ineffable beauty. These shaped themselves into a cross as  he disappeared, and then drew inward to a star, radiant and glorious, which  shone in the gloom as the symbol of hope and salvation. To that high  splendour&mdash;to the Power beyond&mdash;to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy  Ghost proceeding from the Father through the Son, did she pray fervently. Not  that her earthly parent might be spared the commission of a crime, not that her  lover might be saved, but that the holy purpose of God, unknown and  inexplicable, might be fulfilled according to His will. To such a height of  trust in the Love which saves had the ever-compassionate Mercy of The Christ  raised this weak, faltering, bruised soul.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XXII"><b>Chapter XXII</b></a><b><br>
    Right Is Might</b></h2>
  <p align="left">Montrose  was so accustomed to obey his Master that he never questioned the order to  climb the cliff and leave Alice alone in the cave. Yet as he straightened  himself behind the bush which masked the entrance he wondered why such  instructions had been given. Neither he nor the girl knew that Enistor watched  for their coming, so the young man could only conjecture that Eberstein wished  him to surrender to those officers of the law who were hunting for him. This  seemed strange in the face of the doctor&rsquo;s telegram advising him to fly; but for  want of knowledge Montrose was not in a state of mind to reconcile the apparent  contradiction. His sole idea was to do what he had been told to do, even  though&mdash;as seemed to be the case&mdash;he was risking loss of liberty and life. And  indeed, with regard to the last Montrose believed that he might lose it  otherwise than on the gallows.</p>
  <p align="left">The  narrow, tortuous path sloped upward abruptly, with the cliff soaring high above  it and the cliff dropping steeply below to unfathomable depths. Fortunately the  mighty wind, which roared inland from the sea, enabled him to cling the more  surely to the rocky face of the precipice, and by slow degrees he crawled  towards his goal overhead. In a less degree than Alice was the young man  accustomed to such perilous wayfaring, and only by persistent will-power did he  manage to control his nerves. What with the screaming of the tempest above and  the bellowing of the waters below, he nearly lost his head. The tumult of  sound, the stormy darkness only fitfully dispersed by gleams of moonlight, his  dangerous position midway between heaven and earth&mdash;these things were enough to  daunt the bravest man. But that he had been supported by unseen powers,  Montrose would never have succeeded in scaling that tremendous cliff. Yet he  did so, painfully crawling upward inch by inch, shaken like a leaf in the grip  of the wind and stunned by the uproar of great waters. At length, after many  hours&mdash;so it seemed to him who had lost count of time&mdash;he reached the summit and  cast himself breathlessly on the wet herbage. Panting painfully, he sat up  after a pause, and then the lightning flaring in the dark sky showed him a tall  figure rushing towards him. And at the very moment of the onset the winds swept  clear the face of the moon to reveal in her waning light that Enistor had found  him at last.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have you now,&rdquo; shouted the Squire, stumbling towards his victim with eager  haste. &ldquo;You shall not escape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  had no thought of escape and could not have saved himself even had he been so  inclined. He was wholly spent with that fearful climb and was unable to cry  out, much less shape his breath into speech. Yet with the instinct of  self-preservation&mdash;since he was dangerously near the verge of the precipice&mdash;he  rolled blindly to one side as Enistor dashed heedlessly towards him. One moment  he saw the big man reeling with extended hands to clutch and capture in the  half-light; the next and his enemy had disappeared over the cliff, crying  hoarsely as he realised that he had underestimated the distance. The cry was  echoed by Montrose, who nearly lost what few senses remained to him in the  horror of the moment. Then it flashed across his bewildered mind that Enistor  was dead and that there was no chance of capture for the moment. Striving to  regain his breath, to control his mind, to master his nerves, that effort was  the insistent thought which governed his whole being. Utterly unmanned, he  sobbed hysterically.</p>
  <p align="left">But  the loss of self-control did not last long. By a powerful exercise of the will  Montrose succeeded in gaining the mastery of his being and on hands and knees  crawled towards the edge of the cliff. He did not expect to see Enistor, as in  his impetuous rush the man must have hurled himself directly into the  thundering waves which broke far below in white and furious foam. In the  moonlight, which radiated strongly for the time being against the face of the  sea-front, Montrose saw a dark body half-way down. The Squire had fallen  straightly for some distance, then had cannoned off one rock to strike against  another, and finally came to rest on a projecting spur, where the senseless  body remained, hanging helplessly above the boiling of the witches&rsquo; cauldron  below. Clearly and distinctly Montrose saw the perilous position of his enemy:  clearly and distinctly he knew that his enemy could be saved. It remained with  him to allow Enistor to die terribly (since the man&rsquo;s first movement when he  revived would precipitate him into the hell beneath) or to descend and effect a  rescue. How could he do so without a rope and lacking assistance? The young man  did not know, but what he did know, and the thought burnt into his brain, was  that Enistor could be saved, or doomed. And the choice lay with him.</p>
  <p align="left">The  temptation was almost overpowering. Only Enistor could depose to that fatal  visit to the cottage, and if such a proof was wanting Montrose knew positively  that he could not even be accused, much less arrested. He was aware of his  innocence, yet Enistor, who hated him, could prove him to be guilty, and hand  him over to an unmerited death. This the man would assuredly do, and Montrose  winced to think how his name would be covered with ignominy and how greatly  Alice would suffer. Why should he save one who designed his disgrace; who  desired his death? He asked himself this question, and then asked it of God. No  reply came either from himself or from the Unseen. He felt as though the  guidance of the Higher Powers had been withdrawn, and that he was left to  choose unbiased, uninstructed, completely free. Then he recollected how  Eberstein had said that both good and evil would be placed before him, and how  swiftly he had declared he would select the good. His memory recurred to the  subsequent warning: &ldquo;Be not over-confident lest you fall.&rdquo; This was the time of  choice, the crucial moment, which decided all. If he saved Enistor he saved the  only witness who could bring about his condemnation: if he did not rescue the  man he would be free to marry Alice, to enjoy the money, and to lead a peaceful  life. But could a peaceful life be built up upon a crime? for a crime it was to  allow his enemy to perish. No! Come what might, arrest, trial, condemnation,  and shameful death, it was impossible to hesitate longer. Enistor must be  rescued and he must be the man to do the deed. In a frenzy of eagerness, and in  deadly fear lest the evil should overpower the good, Montrose sprang to his  feet and hurried impetuously towards the lights of the coastguard station.  There was not a moment to be lost, so he literally fell against the door and  clamoured for admittance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the row? What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo; asked a gruff voice, as the door opened violently and  a coastguard appeared. &ldquo;You, sir!&rdquo; The man had seen him before and recognised  him in a moment. &ldquo;Have you come to give yourself up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  what you like about that,&rdquo; gasped Montrose, clinging to the door, a wild figure  ragged and streaming with water, &ldquo;only help me to save Enistor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  Squire! What&rsquo;s that about the Squire?&rdquo; and another coastguard laid down his  pipe to step hurriedly forward.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  has fallen over the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  threw him over!&rdquo; cried both men simultaneously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  No! I swear I did not. But what does it matter? You can arrest me afterwards if  you choose. Just now I want to save Enistor. His body is hanging halfway down.  Get me a rope, a lantern; come and assist. I must save him.&rdquo; And Montrose,  feeling a new and powerful life move him to action, rushed into the darkness.</p>
  <p align="left">The  startled coastguards followed, both to see what had happened and to arrest the  fugitive for whom the whole country-side was searching. But discipline  prevailed in spite of their natural bewilderment, and they came to the verge of  the cliff when Montrose shouted, with lanterns and a stout rope. The young man  was lying on his stomach pointing downward to where the body was plainly seen  in the moonlight. The coastguards recoiled in dismay.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is  that the Squire?&rdquo; cried one. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s dead for certain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  Tie the rope round me. I shall descend,&rdquo; said Montrose feverishly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  almost sure death, sir,&rdquo; declared the other man more respectfully, for if the  fugitive intended to descend upon such an errand of mercy it was impossible  that he could be guilty of the murder.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Death  or life, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; retorted Montrose, and hastily bound the rope under his  armpits, assisted by the two men, while he slung one of the lanterns round his  neck. &ldquo;Now! Pay out the rope!&rdquo; and he let himself down gradually, clinging  dexterously to the scanty herbage of the precipice.</p>
  <p align="left">Luckily  the storm was dying away and the wind had rapidly swept the greater part of the  heavens clear of vapours. In the starry space above the sealine the moon shone  out more strongly than usual, so Montrose had ample light to negotiate his  downward course. The coastguards peered over the edge of the cliff, and twisted  the rope round a convenient rock, measuring it out gradually. But hardened men  as they were, they shivered as every now and then the daring adventurer swung  clear, to hang like a spider at the end of the slender line, while the cruel  rocks and hungry waters waited below for their prey.</p>
  <p align="left">But  the Power that had supported Montrose before supported him now, and he felt  singularly clear-headed and strong. Slowly but surely he dropped down the face  of the precipice and finally alighted gently on the projecting spur of rock.  Very cautiously he looped a twist of the rope round Enistor&rsquo;s body, knotting it  to himself, for the least mistake would have tumbled both from the insecure  foothold. As it was the spur trembled and vibrated dangerously under the added  weight of Montrose, even though he was greatly supported by the line. However  he managed to bind the Squire&rsquo;s insensible body to himself, then gave the  signal to be drawn up. The coastguards made sure that the rope was safely  attached to the rock, and then, hoping that it would not give way under the  strain, they began to haul up the two men. With one arm round Enistor, who was  bound more or less tightly to him by the rope, Montrose assisted as best he  could with the arm left free and with his feet. But it was a perilous journey,  and the two men above, as well as Montrose, heaved sighs of relief when willing  hands dragged rescuer and rescued into safety. Notwithstanding the immense  strain to which he had been subjected, the young man still felt able to deal  with the situation. &ldquo;Have you any brandy?&rdquo; he asked the nearest man, as the  three of them looked down at the insensible body.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; and a flask was handed over.</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  knelt and forced the clenched teeth apart to pour down the ardent spirit. The  Squire still lived, for his heart was beating faintly, but his face was  woefully scratched, his head was bruised, and the mackintosh he wore was ripped  to shreds by the tearing and rending of the rocks and shrubs which he had  struck during his fall. That he was alive was a miracle, and so the bluff  coastguards thought as they held the lanterns for Montrose to do his office of  mercy. They respected the young hero intensely for what he had done, as few men  would have dared the perils of such a descent in the stormy gloom of the night.  But they did not know how truly heroic Montrose had been in saving the life of  one who could condemn him to a shameless death for a deed he had never  committed. Montrose himself did not consider the action further, being wholly  occupied in aiding Enistor to recover his senses. What he had done he had done.  There was no more to be said.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Better?&rdquo;  asked the young man softly, when Enistor feebly opened his eyes to stare into  the pale face bending over him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the&mdash;the matter?&rdquo; murmured the broken man faintly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  fell over the cliff. Hush, don&rsquo;t talk. Take some brandy: you will be all right  soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  I think&mdash;I think&mdash;my back&mdash;broken,&rdquo; the voice died away in a drawl of exhaustion  and the eyes closed. With a last effort they opened again, and Enistor asked a  question. &ldquo;Who saved me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  did!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You!&rdquo;  The voice expressed astonishment, disbelief, hatred, scorn; a whole gamut of  disordered passion, as some all-comprehending sixth sense told Montrose. Then  the sick man relapsed into insensibility.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Help  me to carry him to Tremore one of you,&rdquo; said Montrose, rising and looking at  the men, who were staring curiously at him in the mingled light of the moon and  the lanterns. &ldquo;The sooner a doctor sees him the better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  can take him along with my mate here, sir,&rdquo; said a coastguard gruffly; &ldquo;if you  go you will be arrested for the murder of that old foreign cove.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As  I am innocent I don&rsquo;t mind being arrested. And if you two hand me over to the  police I understand that a certain reward&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  speak like that, sir,&rdquo; broke in the other man hastily; &ldquo;a gentleman what risked  his life to save him as was hunting him down ain&rsquo;t no murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; said Montrose thankfully and simply. &ldquo;All the same I am going to  surrender. Meantime, we must take the Squire home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  men stared and wondered, admiring Montrose more than ever, since he was risking  his liberty as he had risked his life to save the man who was so bitter against  him. One coastguard returned to the station, but Montrose and the other carried  the body of Enistor on a hurdle&mdash;taken from a near sheepfold&mdash;to Tremore. They  took a long time to cover the distance across the dark misty moorland, and as  they approached the great house Montrose little by little felt the artificial  strength which had sustained him so far ebbing away. He wondered why it was  leaving him: he wondered what would happen when the police took him: he  wondered if Alice was still in the cave: and finally broke down altogether on  the threshold of the dark house. When the coastguard rang the bell and roused  the servants he handed over two insensible men to be taken indoors. Like a  blood horse Montrose had kept up the pace until he reached the goal, and then  had fallen into as unconscious a state as that of the man whom he had saved.  But as his senses left him he glimpsed a glorious radiance round about him: he  saw the smiling, approving face of his Master, and knew that a hand was raised  in benediction. And soundlessly the words of a Beatitude came to him as soft  and refreshing as summer rain. &ldquo;Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain  mercy!&rdquo; After that gracious saying he knew no more.</p>
  <p align="left">Then  Montrose lost count of time. From the moment when he sank in the darkness  before the door of Tremore until the hour he woke in his own bed time had no  existence. A screened lamp illuminated the room, the blinds were drawn, the  door was closed, and a fire was burning in the grate. He was clasping a tender  hand, and his eyes opened to see the face of Alice bending over him with that  motherly look which all women give to men in time of sickness. It was certainly  night, Montrose thought dreamily, and he probably had been carried to his  bedroom a few minutes since. But how had Alice come so swiftly from the cave?  Was this another miracle in this life of miracles?</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700291h-images/page358.png" width="490" height="750"></p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did  you come after us?&rdquo; he asked weakly.</p>
  <p align="left">The  girl uttered a cry as his lips moved and thankful tears fell on his pale face. &ldquo;Douglas!  do you know me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Alice!  Yes, I know. Alice! I am all right.&rdquo; He strove to rise, but fell back.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are weak still,&rdquo; said the girl, arranging his pillow, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t attempt too much,  dearest. Take this,&rdquo; and a strengthening drink was held to his lips.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  I must see what is happening,&rdquo; muttered Montrose impatiently, his brain  becoming gradually clearer. &ldquo;Your father lies insensible at the door with that  coastguard in charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Father  is in bed and the coastguard is gone, Douglas. It was last night you came here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Last  night! Impossible! It is night still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  dear one, you have slept for twenty-four hours. The doctor said it was the best  thing that could happen after the strain you have undergone. You will soon grow  strong. I am your nurse and have been watching you for hours and hours. Now,&rdquo;  Alice rose and moved towards the fire, &ldquo;you shall have some soup.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  do feel tremendously hungry,&rdquo; admitted the patient; &ldquo;and your father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  Alice&rsquo;s face grew sad. &ldquo;You must not talk. Shortly you shall know all that has  taken place. Drink the soup and then try to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  wilfully argued and objected, but the girl was firm. Finally he finished the  bowl of broth and closed his eyes again. When he was quite asleep Alice left  the housekeeper to watch beside him through the night and retired to her own  room for a much-needed rest. Anxious as she was about many matters both with  regard to her lover and her father, weariness, mental and physical, demanded  its due and she slept soundly until ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning. Her first  waking thought was for her father, and after she had learned his present  condition she sought the sick-room of her lover. But Montrose was no longer  sick. He was up and dressed, with a healthy colour in his cheeks and very  bright eyes, ready for his breakfast and anxious to learn what had taken place  during his insensible condition. Even the thought that he might be arrested on  that very day did not daunt him. Knowing his innocence, and aware that he had  conquered selfish fear to the extent of saving the life of the sole witness who  could condemn him, he felt convinced that in some way&mdash;he did not know  how&mdash;things would be made smooth. Therefore he went down to the dining-room with  Alice and, after making a good meal, he accompanied her to her very own  sitting-room to hear explanations.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your  father is in danger of death, you say?&rdquo; he asked, when they were seated.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,  Douglas. The fall hurt his spine and the doctor does not think that he will  recover. However, he is sensible enough and can talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  does he say?&rdquo; asked Montrose nervously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Scarcely  a word. And that is why I am so anxious to hear from you all that took place  after you left the cave. Both the coastguards told me much; but you can tell me  more. In the first place, where did you meet my father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  the first place,&rdquo; said Montrose, asking a counter-question, &ldquo;am I to be  arrested for murdering Narvaez?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No!  While you have been asleep wonderful discoveries have been made and your  character has been entirely cleared. It was Job Trevel who broke Don Pablo&rsquo;s  neck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Job?  But his mother said that he went out fishing some hours before the death!&rdquo; said  the young man, startled and puzzled by the revelation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  his mother truly thought. Job did go down to take his boat out, but jealousy of  Rose brought him back to Polwellin. He suspected that she intended to see Don  Pablo, and when he found she had gone out he followed her to the cottage on  chance. Rose was there after you left and Don Pablo came out with her to the  gate. Then Job, crazy with anger, sprang on him and&mdash;you know the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know how Job escaped, or why Rose held her tongue when I was in danger of  arrest for what I did not do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rose  ran home terribly afraid lest she should be accused of having had something to  do with the murder, and took to her bed intending to be silent out of selfish  fear. Job returned to his boat and went away. He has not yet returned, and I  don&rsquo;t think he ever will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  how was this found out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  doctor who attended Rose became suspicious of something she said when half  delirious. He told the Perchton Inspector, who saw Rose and forced her to  reveal the truth. Now the police are hunting for Job, and you are entirely  exonerated, although you will no doubt be called upon to state the hour when  you left Don Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank  God for his mercies,&rdquo; said Montrose devoutly. &ldquo;It is a most amazing thing,  Alice. And to think that last night I nearly decided to let your father die,  since he alone would witness against me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  expect that was the test that Dr. Eberstein spoke of, Douglas. I don&rsquo;t know how  my father came to be on the spot unless he followed me by stealth when I came  to see you at the cave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  nodded. &ldquo;No doubt your father suspected you and followed as you say, dear. The  moment I reached the top of the cliff, he rushed at me, but making a mistake  about the distance in the gloom, he hurled himself over the precipice. I saw  that his body was lying half way down, and it was in my mind to leave him  there. Oh! what a struggle I had,&rdquo; cried the young man passionately, &ldquo;only  Christ&rsquo;s love could have nerved me to save the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  Yes!&rdquo; Alice fondled his hand. &ldquo;The descent was very dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is not that I was thinking about. That was nothing. But my doubts, my  hesitation: my desire to save my own life at the cost of his. I wonder my hair  has not turned grey. And to think that all the time things were coming to a  point which would proclaim my innocence. Had I let your father die I should  have committed a purposeless crime. But thanks be to Christ the All-Loving and  All-Powerful, I did as I would be done by, and gave my enemy his life. What a  moment of anguish it was: what a bitter, bitter moment,&rdquo; and the young man  wiped the perspiration from his brow.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  drew his head down on her breast and murmured over him as a mother murmurs over  a child. And Montrose really was a child at the moment as what he had passed  through shook him still to the core of his being. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now, dear; it&rsquo;s  all right now,&rdquo; she urged gently. &ldquo;You have conquered your greatest enemy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your  father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,  dear, yourself. And perhaps my father also. He does not seem to be so bitter  against you as he was. Twice he smiled when your name was mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  he has recovered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  will never recover,&rdquo; said the girl sadly. &ldquo;The doctor says that his spine is  injured.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Poor  man!&rdquo; cried Douglas generously, &ldquo;can I not see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  at present. The doctor says he is to be kept quiet just now.&rdquo; Alice burst into  distressful tears. &ldquo;Heaven only knows that I have little reason to love my  father; but it is heart-rending to see him lying there, broken down and  helpless, with no future save a painful death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This  time it was her lover&rsquo;s turn to soothe and console. Drawing the sobbing girl  closer to his heart, he said what he could. &ldquo;Death is the gate of Life, we are  told, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  made no reply. The phrase did not tend to disperse her grief, which was rather  that of pity than of love, although the two are so much akin that the one can  scarcely be distinguished from the other. Montrose wisely said no more,  thinking truly that silence was more comforting than words, and they both  remained silent for some minutes. A knock at the door parted them, and Alice  dried her tears to receive a card from the incoming servant. At once her sad  face lighted up with pleasure and hope.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  Douglas, Dr. Eberstein has come,&rdquo; she exclaimed joyfully. &ldquo;Bring the gentleman  here at once, at once!&rdquo; And when the servant had departed the girl turned to  her lover with an air of relief. &ldquo;The doctor will put everything right. I feel  certain of that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  do I,&rdquo; replied Douglas confidently. &ldquo;He may even cure your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  was shown in at this moment, and when the door was closed, he walked over to  Montrose with a glad smile to place his two hands on the young man&rsquo;s shoulders.  &ldquo;You have conquered, my son. As a true follower of the Blessed One you have  forgiven your enemy in the face of overwhelming temptation to act otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then  Mr. Enistor truly was my enemy?&rdquo; asked Montrose hurriedly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Life  after life he has been your enemy. Remember the vision which you saw in London,  and the wounded man who came between you and the girl you love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Enistor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  bowed his head. &ldquo;He was then a priest of the Star-Angel, Mars, in Chaldea.  Alice was a vestal and you a noble who loved her. I warned you then not to  pluck the fruit before it was ripe, but you would, and in carrying away the  girl you murdered Enistor. This is the sin which has parted you and Alice for  many ages. Now the debt is paid; for the life you destroyed you have given a  life in saving your enemy. The shadow has vanished, and now,&rdquo; Eberstein placed  the hand of Alice in that of Montrose, &ldquo;now you are one once more. In union  lies strength, therefore let the sorrows you have passed through bind you truly  together for service to God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How  wonderful! How wonderful!&rdquo; gasped Alice, holding tightly to her lover as if she  feared to lose him again. &ldquo;Will there be no more trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  troubles which all undergo when dwelling in the flesh. But these, in many  cases, you will be able to avert, since you have much light and more will be  given. But the dark Karma of Chaldea has been dispersed for ever. Thank God, my  children, that you have been so wonderfully guided through the mists of error  into the clear day of truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  do thank Him,&rdquo; said Douglas reverently, &ldquo;and you for so guiding us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am but the instrument used for God&rsquo;s high purpose,&rdquo; said Eberstein, with a  solemn look, &ldquo;and I thank Him that I have been so honoured. Now you both must  do as you have been done by, and aid in the salvation of Korah Enistor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My  father! How can we do that?&rdquo; inquired Alice anxiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  must wait for the arrival of that Son of Perdition who wishes to keep that most  unhappy soul in bondage. Then will Love and Hate battle for the prize. The  result depends upon that soul&rsquo;s choice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  Narvaez is dead,&rdquo; said Montrose, puzzled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Narvaez  is more alive than ever in the body of Julian Hardwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Alice recognised the truth of this astounding statement at once. &ldquo;I knew Julian  was different: that he was evil instead of good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  sensed Narvaez&rsquo; black soul in Hardwick&rsquo;s body,&rdquo; said Eberstein simply. &ldquo;Be strong,  be ready; for the hour of strife is at hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let  us pray!&rdquo; cried Alice fervently, and the two did pray with full hearts, while  the Master strengthened the selfless petition.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII"><b>Chapter  XXIII</b></a><b><br>
    The Eternal Strife</b></h2>
  <p align="left">For  three days Enistor lingered on, fighting inch by inch for his life with  obstinate courage. The doctor told him that there was no hope, but he declined  to believe in such croakings. With all his pride and all his will he resisted  the coming dissolution of his body, and therefore lived much longer than would  have been the case had he been of a less resolute nature. Night and day Alice  and the housekeeper nursed him by turns, and he seemed grateful for their  attentions, although he said very little to either. Montrose wished to see the  dying man and assure him of forgiveness, but Enistor declined an interview.  Narvaez-Hardwick also called with feigned expressions of regret, but was forced  to depart without seeing the man his wickedness had brought so low. As to Dr.  Eberstein, he took lodgings in the village, so as to be at hand at the last  moment, and waited patiently for a summons to the bedside.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  will come,&rdquo; he assured Montrose. &ldquo;It will surely come, since the last act of  this terrible drama has to be played by all who have taken part in it, with the  exception of Hardwick, who has done his share and passed over. But you and  Alice and Narvaez and I have to face Enistor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For  what purpose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  doctor answered rather irrelevantly. &ldquo;The extension of Enistor&rsquo;s life beyond  what is natural, considering his injuries, is not permitted without a good  reason. The poor creature is taking part in a tremendous struggle between the  little good he has in him, and the enormous quantity of evil which, through  ignorance, he has accumulated in this and other lives. I am trying constantly  to increase that good, while Narvaez is putting forth all his wicked power to  strengthen the evil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who  will win, you or Narvaez?&rdquo; asked Montrose abruptly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only  God knows the issue of the conflict, my son, since Enistor, having free-will,  can choose either the good or the bad, the Left-hand Path or the Right-hand  Path. You were given the same choice in another way, but with you the Power of  Love prevailed. Whether it will prevail with this miserable man depends upon  himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  cannot you tell, Master? You know so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know much, but I do not know all. God alone is omniscient. Did not one of your  poets say: &lsquo;We mortal millions live alone&rsquo;? That is a great truth greatly put.  Each soul must find God for itself through Christ by the power of the Holy  Ghost. It can be helped and instructed by those who, like myself, are humble  servants of the Most High, but the soul alone can choose whether to rise or  fall. I tell you, Montrose, much as Enistor suffers physically, he is infinitely  more tormented mentally. Night and day, and day and night, the strife continues  between evil and good, in which Narvaez and I take part. Only Enistor can elect  which side will win.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can  I not help?&rdquo; asked the young man, distressed at the terrible plight of his  whilom enemy.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  have helped&mdash;helped greatly. Enistor is constantly trying to understand why you  saved him, when he could have, and would have, condemned you to a shameful and  unmerited death. It is well nigh impossible for him to grasp such self-abnegation,  but the positive fact that you acted as you did is the spar to which he clings,  and which prevents him from sinking in the troubled waters of evil desires  which Narvaez is bringing up against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you smash Narvaez?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  would be against the law of justice. Narvaez has his rights, as every one else  has. If he chooses to abuse those rights he will bring destruction on himself,  as he is surely doing. Hate only ceases by love, so all that I can do is to  offer Narvaez the assistance which he refuses to take. With my greater powers,  poured through me for selfless ends by the God of All, I could use force and  render him harmless. But such force would mean employment of the power of Hate.  The influence is always the same in its essence, but becomes good or evil as we  employ it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Still,  if you ended Don Pablo&rsquo;s wickedness, Enistor would be saved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  cannot tell. But he cannot be saved at the cost of injustice to Narvaez, my  son. By his own acts in this life and others he has placed himself in the power  of Narvaez, and must abide by his choice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Still  he may want to escape?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  so, and I truly hope that such will be the case, he has only to open his heart  to the incoming of Christ, and the Mighty Power of the Blessed One will sweep  away Narvaez like a straw. Love is stronger than evil, and must prevail when  election is made to use it. Now go, my son, for even now the Son of Perdition  is putting forth his strength to overwhelm the soul, and I must withstand him.  Pray constantly, my child, and tell Alice to pray; for the fight is desperately  bitter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Without  a word Montrose departed, leaving Eberstein to wrestle with the Powers of  Darkness. Seeking Alice, he brought her to the altar of the parish church, and  there they remained kneeling for many hours. It was well that they fled for  refuge to the tabernacle of God, for within all was light, and the Dark Powers  halted at the door, helpless, fierce and furious, and&mdash;baffled.</p>
  <p align="left">During  those days of the struggle Montrose&rsquo;s worldly position had been made secure.  The confession of Rose, who had seen Narvaez murdered, proved beyond all doubt  that Job Trevel was the culprit. That man never returned now or thereafter, and  it could only be conjectured that he had been lost at sea in the storm which  took place when the crime was committed. But Montrose was fully exonerated, and  in their rough way the villagers of Polwellin apologised for their wrongful  suspicions. He more than regained the place he had lost in their affections,  for the coastguards had told everywhere how the Squire had been rescued and at  what a cost. That Enistor should have been saved at all was a matter of regret  to his tenants, who detested him for his many acts of oppression. Throughout  the village there was not heard one pitying word for the man now at the point  of death, so doubtless this feeling of ill-will also tormented Enistor in his  then sensitive state. But as the man had sown, so the man had to reap, and by  his own acts he was condemned to a punishment which went far to excuse his  wickedness.</p>
  <p align="left">In  reply to Alice&rsquo;s telegram Mrs. Barrast came down to see the last of her brother  and was desperately annoyed to find&mdash;as she thought&mdash;that he had completely  recovered. Of course for his own ends Narvaez-Hardwick played the part of a  grateful brother, and to get rid of the little woman he gave her a handsome  cheque out of the property he had acquired. That the same had merely been  transferred from Narvaez to Narvaez was a fact not known to Mrs. Barrast, who  quite believed&mdash;and very naturally&mdash;that Julian had been cured in some miraculous  way of his illness by the Perchton doctor. What that gentleman himself thought  no one ever knew, as he held his tongue very wisely, through sheer inability to  explain matters. But his practice benefited greatly, and he made full use of  his enhanced reputation. Mrs. Barrast thanked him for the wonder he had  wrought, said that she would mention his skill to her friends and send them to  Perchton for treatment. Then she went across the Channel with Frederick to  spend the handsome cheque in Paris and did not trouble any further about her  brother. Which was just what the individual masquerading in that brother&rsquo;s body  desired. Hardwick&rsquo;s sister was such a trifling little butterfly that it was not  worth while breaking her on a wheel. Even if, out of sheer malicious amusement,  the magician had wished to do so, he had no time. All his energies were taken  up in fighting the strong power of Eberstein for the soul of his escaping  slave. The adversaries came to grips on the night of the fourth day after  Montrose had wiped out his sin by the rescue of his enemy.</p>
  <p align="left">After  dinner on that evening, Alice and her lover were waiting in the library,  feeling sorrowful and depressed. The young man was seated in an arm-chair  before the fire and Alice, on the hearth-rug, inclined her dark head against  his knees. Having watched throughout the previous night by the bedside, she had  slept all day, and now was giving her whole attention to Douglas before  returning to her new vigil in the sick-room. Neither of the two was speaking,  as the shadow of evil lay thicker and blacker than ever on the house, and there  was a feeling still more terrible in the air. Montrose felt little of such  things, cased as he was in less sensitive flesh; but Alice was alive to  battling forces, invisible and menacing, which thrilled her soul with agony and  helpless grief.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Death  is here,&rdquo; she said at length, without removing her gaze from the burning logs,  and Montrose knew enough of her clairvoyant powers not to exclaim at the weird  remark.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do  you think he will die to-night?&rdquo; he asked, looking nervously round the  brilliantly lighted room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think so. Something dreadful is coming nearer and nearer. Very cold, very  powerful, yet very merciful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  shuddered and recalled a play by Maeterlinck which he had read some years back.  The atmosphere of the library was exactly that suggested by &ldquo;L&rsquo;Intruse,&rdquo; and he  felt, as did the characters in that wonderful piece of writing, that the being  with the scythe was about to enter the door. When a sharp knock came, his  shaken nerves extorted a start and a cry. But it was only the housekeeper who  came to announce that she wanted Alice to take up the watch by Enistor&rsquo;s  bedside and also to tell both the young people that two gentlemen had arrived  simultaneously at Tremore.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr.  Hardwick and Dr. Eberstein,&rdquo; said the housekeeper.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell  them to come in,&rdquo; replied Alice quietly, in marked contrast to her lover, who  started to his feet much perturbed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  do they come together?&rdquo; he asked uneasily. &ldquo;They have never met before to my  knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is the beginning of the end, Douglas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They  then bring death with them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or  Narvaez brings death and Dr. Eberstein brings life,&rdquo; said Alice, still in the  unemotional tone which she had used throughout. &ldquo;But not in a physical way, you  understand. Hush! Here they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  two men entered quietly: Narvaez, splendid and strong in the beauty of his  stolen body, and Eberstein, elderly, grey-haired, and weary-looking. But Alice,  looking through the masks of flesh, saw that they lied. Eberstein was the  ever-young, glorious soul, radiant with immortal life, and Narvaez but a black  evil shadow, distorted and venomous. Outwardly the magician resembled Milton&rsquo;s  fallen archangel, magnificently sinful, while the doctor, like his Great Master  the Man of Sorrows, seemed to bear the burden of other people&rsquo;s sins. Here  indeed were the representatives of the eternal strife, the types of Heaven and  Hell, bearing the cross and the wine-cup. And the world-battle on a smaller  scale was about to be fought out between them. As Alice greeted the one and the  other, the housekeeper turned at the door to speak.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  Squire knows that Dr. Eberstein and Mr. Hardwick have come, miss, as I told  him. He would like to see them along with you and Mr. Montrose. But I don&rsquo;t  think it is wise, miss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  can go,&rdquo; said the girl quietly, and the housekeeper departed, grumbling at the  risk of visitors to the sick man. &ldquo;Shall we see my father now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She  addressed Eberstein, who bowed, for the situation was too tense for the use of  many words. But Narvaez spoke with an insolent smile. &ldquo;I hope Mr. Enistor will  not be the worse for my coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think he will be very much the worse, Don Pablo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  am your dear friend, Julian Hardwick,&rdquo; sneered the magician.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  know better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Clever  girl. But you do not know all,&rdquo; he taunted.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Enough  to be aware that you are an evil man, exercising more than human power. Also  Dr. Eberstein has recalled to my recollection what I saw during the trance. I  know who you are, Se&ntilde;or Narvaez, and what you are. With me you cannot  masquerade as an angel of light.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  leave that r&ocirc;le to our friend here,&rdquo; scoffed the other with a shrug.</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  did not take the slightest notice. With Narvaez he was very watchful, but  intensely quiet: always on his guard, but never offering the fuel of words to  kindle useless argument. And time being precious at the moment, he softly  intimated to Alice that it would be as well to seek the bedroom immediately.  Without objection the girl led the way, and shortly the whole party were in the  presence of the Squire.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  lay in bed, propped up with many pillows. Other than a shaded lamp on a small  table beside him, there was no illumination save the crimson glimmer of the  fire, so that the room was filled with a kind of artificial twilight, sinister  and eerie. It was a large apartment furnished in that heavy cumbersome style  prevalent during the first half of the last century, eminently comfortable but  markedly inartistic. The green rep curtains of the bed were looped back to show  the white suffering face and sunken eyes of the sick man, on whom the gaze of  the quartette was centred. The silence was intense; as the rain had ceased, the  wind had died away, and only the heavy breathing of those present, or the fall  of a burning coal, broke the stillness. This calm before the storm suggested  itself to Alice as much more terrible than the storm itself could possibly be.  It seemed as though the whole of creation waited anxiously to hear what choice  the dying man would make between evil and good. The words came slowly from him,  as he fixed his weary eyes on Montrose with wondering inquiry.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why  did you save my life?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  was sorry for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sorry  for one who intended to have you hanged for a crime you did not commit.  Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  I saved you showed it was not impossible. I had a struggle: oh, yes, I had a  great struggle. Not knowing that my character would be cleared, I nearly  decided to let you perish lest you should condemn me. But I could not: I could  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  demanded Enistor insistently. &ldquo;Why? Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  pressed his hands tightly together to control his emotions. &ldquo;How can I explain?  Something higher than my ordinary self acted for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The  Christ, Who is building Himself up within you, spoke,&rdquo; said Eberstein gravely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Weakness  spoke,&rdquo; struck in the magician. &ldquo;The weakness of a coward who was afraid to  remove an obstacle from his path.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Montrose  did remove an obstacle,&rdquo; said the doctor, addressing Narvaez-Hardwick for the  first time. &ldquo;One which was blocking his upward path.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;His  murder of me in Chaldea?&rdquo; questioned Enistor, after a pause.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  He owed you a life. Only by giving back in another way what he had robbed you  of could he learn his lesson and cleanse his soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where  is the life that has been given?&rdquo; sneered Narvaez-Hardwick. &ldquo;There is Enistor  dying. A valuable gift indeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Montrose  did not know that Enistor was fatally injured by his fall. So far as he was  aware he gave back what he had taken and at the risk of losing his present life  unjustly. The sheet is clean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sophistry!  Sophistry! You are trying to make black white.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  so. Man is judged by his intention in whatever he does. Thought precedes both  words and acts, so if the first be right the two last cannot be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  are here to listen to a sermon, it appears,&rdquo; said the other man mockingly. &ldquo;You  are woefully dull.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Eberstein  ignored the spiteful speech to advance towards the bed. &ldquo;Enistor, you are about  to pass away from the physical plane to reap as you have sown, and painful will  be the harvesting of your sheaves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tares  he should call them,&rdquo; mocked Narvaez-Hardwick contemptuously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not  all tares. Always the germs of good have been in your victim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A  victim! I?&rdquo; cried the Squire, pride and indignation lighting up his faded eyes,  to the delight of his dark master, who approved of the sinister quality.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Eberstein steadily. &ldquo;Age after age, life after life, you have been the  victim, the slave, the tool of this man, who is stronger than you are. By taking  his gifts, you have submitted yourself to his will. Break your chain, Enistor:  now, at this very moment, assert your freedom as a son of God, owing allegiance  only to that Power of Love which is co-extensive with creation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  by so doing you render yourself the servant of all,&rdquo; said Narvaez-Hardwick  vehemently. &ldquo;Whatever you gain you must use for the benefit of others and not  for yourself. Think of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  came the quiet voice of the White Master. &ldquo;Think of it, and think of how the  powers you gain through evil are used for the benefit of your dark tyrant. He  does not even give you gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  give more than gratitude: my gifts are more substantial. Virtue is not its own  reward in my service. Service indeed. And who has done service? I ask you, Enistor.  Did I not scheme to place this young fool in your power, and did I not do so?  You failed to use the golden moment properly and crush him, or you would by now  have been wealthy, by regaining your lost property, and he would have been  waiting his trial in prison. Have I not rendered you a great service? Do I not  deserve gratitude in return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Gratitude  for ruining me,&rdquo; said Enistor, wincing at the fiery glances cast upon him. &ldquo;You  ask too much. You have plotted and planned, it is true, but your schemes have  been brought to naught.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By  you,&rdquo; said Narvaez-Hardwick scornfully, &ldquo;since you failed to grasp the prize I  placed within your reach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  was Douglas who conquered,&rdquo; said Alice suddenly. &ldquo;He chose the good instead of  the evil, and hate was overcome by love. Father,&rdquo; she moved forward swiftly to  kneel beside the bed, &ldquo;you have no bitterness against Douglas now: you cannot  have since he has saved your life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For  the moment,&rdquo; scoffed the magician, &ldquo;a pretty saving truly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have had a terrible time since regaining my senses,&rdquo; said the Squire feebly. &ldquo;All  my old life has been broken up, and I am beginning to see things in a new  light. Love is stronger than Hate, I admit that, since Montrose acted so  unselfishly as he did. Douglas,&rdquo; he held out a trembling hand, which the young  man gladly took, &ldquo;I thank you for what you have done, and I ask you to forgive  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Willingly!  Willingly,&rdquo; said Montrose, with fervour. &ldquo;If we had only understood one another  better, you would not now be dying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no question of dying,&rdquo; cried Narvaez-Hardwick, furious to see how his empire  was slipping from his grasp. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hearken to this weak babble, Enistor.  Listen, I can cure you: I can make you as well as ever you were.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  girl and her lover started up with incredulous looks and Enistor gasped in  amazement. &ldquo;Can he do this?&rdquo; he demanded, looking at Eberstein.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  assented the other calmly. &ldquo;His knowledge is great, even though it is wrongly  used.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wrongly  used to cure the sick? Ha! What of your Master who saved the lives of those  past human aid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He  saved through the power of love, and left those He saved free. You would use  that same power after your own evil fashion, changing its good into bad, so  that you can bind Enistor the more closely to you as a slave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Slave!  Slave! What parrot repetition. Always slave: victim: tool! Lies, I tell you,  Enistor, lies. You are my friend. If I did make you suffer, it was to test your  strength, so that you might become strong enough to handle those great powers  which I use. I can make you omnipotent as I am myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Omnipotent,&rdquo;  echoed the Squire doubtfully. &ldquo;How can that be when you were struck down in  your moment of triumph?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  was taken by surprise,&rdquo; said Narvaez-Hardwick sullenly. &ldquo;Had I been on my guard  I could have held my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think not,&rdquo; observed the doctor gently; then addressing Enistor directly, with  marked emphasis: &ldquo;My son, creation is sustained by love, and where love is not,  destruction must needs come. By pandering to self, this man has acquired a  small empire, which he has cut off from the great one of God. His force is only  that little which he has gained and which he is strong enough to hold. But my  force,&rdquo; Eberstein stood up very straightly, &ldquo;is the force of the whole, which  is necessarily greater than the force of the part acquired by Narvaez. Through  me, as through all who strive to work selflessly, the mighty power of love is  poured, for the benefit of those who need aid. Only this can give you power,  and will you consent to be a slave in the petty kingdom of this man, which will  be destroyed when his measure is full?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  will never be destroyed,&rdquo; cried the magician, hatefully proud. &ldquo;For centuries I  have endured alone, defying all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  seek isolation, and isolation you shall have,&rdquo; said Eberstein sadly. &ldquo;Life  after life you are building thicker and thicker the prison-house which shuts  you in from the source of all life. Oh, my Brother, have we not pleaded with  you again and again to repent, and turn to Him who alone sustains the worlds,  and you will not, in your mad pride of self. Rapidly and surely you are  descending into the Abyss, and would drag this man with you. But so great is  the Love of Christ, who died for you and for all, that He will forgive you even  at the eleventh hour, as He forgives this poor mortal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t asked for forgiveness!&rdquo; growled Enistor savagely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  Don&rsquo;t be so weak,&rdquo; said Narvaez-Hardwick eagerly. &ldquo;Eberstein talks rubbish. If  you turn to his foolish ways will he save your life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said the doctor with decision. &ldquo;Enistor must pass on to exhaust the evil that  he has made by suffering. But in that necessary suffering he will be supported  and aided by Him who suffered Himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There,&rdquo;  the magician turned triumphantly towards Enistor, &ldquo;you see that he can only  promise pain. A nice bribe for you to turn into a silly saint, isn&rsquo;t it, my  friend? Now I&rdquo;&mdash;the man&rsquo;s voice became dangerously persuasive and bland&mdash;&ldquo;I can  make you whole again by curing your hurt and renewing your vital powers. You  have heard Eberstein admit that I can do so. Then, since you have stood the  tests of inflicted pain, which were necessary, I can now instruct you in the  higher magic, which will give you power over men. Also I can make you rich. Let  this money of your sister&rsquo;s remain with Montrose and let him marry your  daughter and pass out of your life. You and I, my dear friend, will go to  Spain, and there you shall share in my greatness. Together we shall sway this  generation, making and unmaking men and nations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  listen to him: don&rsquo;t listen to him,&rdquo; implored Alice, putting her arms round her  father&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;Remember how cruel he has been to you: remember how he was  struck down by God: remember how his schemes have failed. He is a liar, like  his Father the Devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is no devil but what man makes for himself,&rdquo; sneered Narvaez-Hardwick. &ldquo;But we  will let that pass. You have heard, Enistor. Eberstein offers you death in this  world and pain in the next&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Through  which you will pass to a wider and more glorious life, when the past has been  expiated,&rdquo; said the doctor swiftly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;While  I,&rdquo; went on the magician, paying no heed to the interruption, &ldquo;can give you a  long physical life with power and wealth, and ease and knowledge. Also in the  next world I have my empire and you shall share it when we pass over this time,  to return more powerful when we next incarnate. Choose! Choose!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Aye,  choose,&rdquo; said Eberstein solemnly. &ldquo;The Path of Pleasure, which leads to  destruction, or the Path of Pain, which ends in the radiant light of the  Godhead. The narrow way: the broad way: the Way of the Cross, or the Way of the  Wine-cup in which the serpent of self lurks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">On  one side of the bed stood the Dark Master, on the other stood the White Master,  and between, prone with anguish, lay the body which contained the soul for  which the opposing forces of good and evil struggled. Alice clung to her father  and Montrose knelt prayerfully by the bed. The room was charged with battling  powers, but in that dread moment of choice the influence of both stood aloof  from the soul, which had to make its choice by what knowledge it had garnered  painfully through many incarnations. Enistor felt suddenly feeble, felt that he  was in a dense gloom, pricked here and there with wan lights, which represented  all the good he had gained: and great indeed was the blackness of evil. Of  himself he could do nothing, yet he knew intuitively that behind the gloom was  a glorious and radiant Power of Love, which would dispel the evil when called  upon. Narvaez offered him the kingdoms of the world, which rise and fall and  pass away as a burning scroll: Eberstein offered him the glories of eternal  good, which endure for ever and ever. He had in many lives tested the lower:  now was the time to reach out to the higher. Yet so strong was the temptation  of the flesh that the man paused, hesitated, faltered and held his peace. Alice  sensed the conflict, and strove to surrender her gain of good to him who had  treated her so cruelly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If  it is permitted, let what I can give go to help my father,&rdquo; she cried, and then  the miracle happened.</p>
  <p align="left">Enistor  felt an inrush of light, not very strong yet wholly pure, and it was sufficient  to turn the scale in spite of the strong insistence of the evil darkness. Yet  not in such strength could he conquer. Something greater was needed, but the  aid of Alice gave him power to call upon the greater might. &ldquo;Hear us, oh!  Christ: graciously hear us, oh! Lord Christ,&rdquo; he cried, in the suddenly  remembered words of the Litany, and in broken tones.</p>
  <p align="left">Narvaez  retreated suddenly with a snarl of baffled rage, driven back by a glorious  power, which flooded the being of his escaping victim with ineffable light. As  by magic the darkness vanished, and the radiant tenderness of Perfect Love  descended upon the weary soul. Enistor&rsquo;s face grew young and bright. With an  expression of joyful awe, he stretched out imploring hands of surrender and  remorse. What he beheld Eberstein saw, as his head was reverently bent, and  Narvaez saw also, for he fell back slowly towards the door; driven into his  self-created darkness by the overwhelming glory of the Cross. Alice, clinging  to Montrose, murmured incoherently: &ldquo;Do you see Him: do you see Him? There.  With His hand on my father&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  Lord of the Dark Face had vanished: the Lord of Compassion had come in power.  Like a child who is weary the dying man fell dead on the pillows, his soul  passing onward so gently that the two young people scarcely realised that all  was over. A moment later, and the Presence was gone. The supernal light,  visible to all save Douglas, faded away, and Eberstein stepped forward silently  to close the tired eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;May  God lead him to a place of refreshment, light and peace,&rdquo; he said in solemn  tones, and over the body he traced the holy emblem of salvation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo;  murmured the two who knelt by the bedside.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700291h-images/page381.png" width="490" height="750"></p>
  <p align="left">And  away into the night fled the Son of Perdition, baffled, broken and beaten,  despoiled of his slave, who was lost to him for ever. And his was the eternal  torment of self, which flies though no man pursueth.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV"><b>Chapter XXIV</b></a><b><br>
    Dawn</b></h2>
  <p align="left">For  six months after the death of her father Alice travelled abroad, with Mrs.  Sparrow as her chaperon and companion. The strain to which she had been  subjected demanded removal from surroundings so intimately connected with the  ordeal, and meanwhile Tremore could be safely left in charge of the  housekeeper. It was with some reluctance that Montrose agreed to the  Continental tour, which had been suggested by Eberstein, as it parted him for  half a year from the girl he loved. But the doctor pointed out that absence would  make Alice more self-reliant, since she would have to deal single-handed with  her sorrow, unaided by her lover&rsquo;s sympathy and companionship. Each human  being, he declared, must learn to become a centre of power, depending on God  alone for help, since only in this way can such a one develop the necessary  strength to act as a useful servant of Christ. It was a drastic training for  the young people, at which they winced; but when Eberstein fully convinced them  that the flesh must be dominated by the spirit at all costs, they agreed to the  separation. It was a final test of their obedience, and a great one.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  selected Mrs. Sparrow to accompany her, for two reasons. First, she was sorry  for the childish woman, who led so dull a life, and wished to brighten her grey  existence. Secondly, the girl was immensely grateful to both the vicar and his  wife for their championship of Montrose in the face of strong evidence as to  his guilt, and desired to give some tangible proof of her feelings. Indeed she  asked Mr. Sparrow to come abroad also, but met with a refusal, since he could  not see his way to leave his parish for so lengthy a period. However, Douglas  induced the good man to pay him a few visits in London during his wife&rsquo;s  absence, and these gave great pleasure to Mr. Sparrow, besides which they  helped to widen his views. Therefore he was delighted to think that his better  half should chaperon Miss Enistor, and took unselfish pleasure in the  preparations for the great event.</p>
  <p align="left">As  to Mrs. Sparrow, to journey abroad, and see with her own eyes very many things  she had only read about, was like a glimpse of paradise, or a drink of water to  a thirsty man. She left behind her a colourless life of scraping and screwing,  of cutting and contriving, to enjoy comfortable days of ample means and  constant novelty. France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany: Mrs. Sparrow saw them  all, and wrote daily letters to her husband concerning her experiences. Her  being blossomed like a rose in the sunlight of prosperity, and she regained in  a great measure the youth which had been crushed out of her by sordid cares.  Alice enjoyed the naive delight of her rejuvenated companion as much as she did  the sights which brought forth such an expression of pleasure, and in this way,  amongst others, was aided to forget her late trials. The tour was a complete  success, and when the two returned to England during the early blossoming of  spring, they were bubbling over with the joy of life. And the end of the  journey terminated in lovers meeting, which was fit and proper, according to  the dictum of Shakespeare.</p>
  <p align="left">The  sorely tried pair were married quietly in London. Mr. Sparrow came up to  perform the ceremony, Mrs. Sparrow acted as the one and only bridesmaid, while  Dr. Eberstein gave the bride away. Then came a pleasant wedding breakfast and  the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Montrose to Eastbourne for a delightful  honeymoon. Mrs. Barrast was annoyed that she had not been asked to the great  event, since the wooing had taken place in her house, but she soon got over her  pique, and sent a present to the happy pair, together with a letter in which  she complained that Julian, exiled in Spain, took not the slightest notice of  her. Douglas laughed over the characteristic selfishness of the butterfly, and  wondered openly what she would say if she really knew the weird truth. Alice  replied that she would never believe it, which was extremely probable,  considering Mrs. Barrast&rsquo;s limitations.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  I only hope that Don Pablo will leave her alone,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Montrose. &ldquo;He  is just the kind of man who would play her some malicious trick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think he would be permitted to do that,&rdquo; rejoined Douglas thoughtfully. &ldquo;Narvaez  is a kind of super-human criminal, and will be kept within bounds by the Great  Powers which control the world. Mrs. Barrast is a frivolous little woman, who  does no harm, even if she does no good, so she will be protected until she is  strong enough to endure suffering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  seems rather cruel that if one gains strength and improves one&rsquo;s character, one  should only grow better to invite sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  cannot become gods in any other way, dear. The burden is always fitted to the  bearer, and what is demanded from the strong is not asked from the weak. &lsquo;Whom  God loveth, He chasteneth,&rsquo; you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  could never understand that text,&rdquo; objected Alice, raising her eyebrows.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Eberstein  explained it to me,&rdquo; replied her husband. &ldquo;Through ignorance one accumulates  bad Karma, life after life, which is gradually paid off in such a way as not to  bear too hardly on those who have to suffer. And until that Karma, which is of  our own making, is paid off, we are unprofitable servants working&mdash;so to  speak&mdash;only for ourselves, since it is to get rid of the burdens which  inconvenience us that we labour. But when any one vows himself or herself to  the service of Christ and desires to work, as the Master did, for humanity at  large, the evil Karma must be got rid of very speedily, so as to leave freedom  for the work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  asked Alice, when he paused, and still not seeing clearly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Cannot  you understand? The quicker the Karma is paid off, the sooner will the servant  of Christ be free to do what he or she wants in the service of the Master. Thus  an appeal is made by the soul to God for such freedom, and it is answered by  the payment of the evil being concentrated in three or four lives, whereas,  ordinarily speaking, it would be spread over a hundred. Therefore at the soul&rsquo;s  request, trouble after trouble descends without intermission, and the greater  speed means the greater pain. Thus do we see many people of blameless lives  suffering terribly and, humanly speaking, unjustly. But the chastening is only  the love of God drawing them swiftly to Himself by allowing them&mdash;at their own  request, mind you&mdash;to pay off the evil of past ignorance at one sweep&mdash;so to  speak&mdash;instead of by instalments.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  see. But Mrs. Barrast?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She  is in the A B C class. Only easy payments are demanded from her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What  about ourselves? Are we free?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In  a great measure I think we are&mdash;for this incarnation at least, since we have  been so bitterly tried. But of course I cannot tell if we have discharged all  the evil debts of the past. I don&rsquo;t much care. What is gained is well worth the  pain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  shivered. &ldquo;The pain is very great.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So  is the gain. If one works for super-human things, one must be content to suffer  more than the ordinary person. But don&rsquo;t distress yourself over such things,  dear heart,&rdquo; added her husband, taking her in his arms. &ldquo;We have passed through  the clouds and now stand in the sunshine, so what we have to do is to help  others as we were helped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have helped Mrs. Sparrow, and you have helped her husband,&rdquo; said Alice  thankfully. &ldquo;She is quite a different woman, so gay and bright and hopeful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  Sparrow is as happy as the day is long. As the living is in your gift, Alice, I  have arranged to add to the income, so that the two may enjoy more of the good  things of this life. And when we live at Tremore we can do much good in the  parish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  Yes!&rdquo; Mrs. Montrose&rsquo;s face lighted up. &ldquo;I am quite anxious to get back and  begin some good work. But&rdquo;&mdash;her face clouded&mdash;&ldquo;it will not be pleasant to live in  Tremore: it is such a gloomy house, and the atmosphere&mdash;ugh!&rdquo; she shuddered at  the memory.</p>
  <p align="left">Montrose  laughed in an encouraging manner. &ldquo;As you gave me permission to do what I liked  with the house during your absence, I have made very great improvements,&rdquo; he  said significantly; &ldquo;also Dr. Eberstein is there at present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  Alice was curious.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait  and see. I don&rsquo;t fancy you will find Tremore such a disappointing residence as  you think it will be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Try  as Alice might, she could get no further satisfaction on this point, and  consequently became desperately anxious to return and see what had taken place.  Montrose resisted her desire to go back until he received a telegram from the  doctor, and then agreed that they should start for Cornwall on the next day.  During the journey from Eastbourne to London, and the journey from Paddington  to Perchton, they talked hopefully about the future and made many agreeable  plans, mainly concerned with asking less fortunate people to share the  happiness and wealth which they enjoyed. For unlike ordinary mortals this bride  and bridegroom looked to finding happiness in clothing the naked and feeding  the hungry, in teaching the ignorant and comforting the desolate. Only the man  who has had toothache can fully sympathise with the man who has it, and in a  like manner what Douglas and Alice had suffered made them intensely anxious to  save others if possible from the purgatory of pain. It was an astonishingly  unselfish attitude for a happy pair returning from their honeymoon to adopt,  since such people are usually wrapped up entirely in themselves. But then they  had been fortunate enough to have the friendship of Eberstein and the enmity of  Narvaez to bring them to such a pitch of noble resolve.</p>
  <p align="left">At  Perchton, the bride and bridegroom were received by the vicar and his wife, a  very different couple from what they had been some months previously. There was  no greyness about the bright-faced woman: no stolid endurance of a dismal life  about the genial man. Mr. Sparrow was cheery and helpful: Mrs. Sparrow smiled  on one and all, beautifully dressed, and looking years younger.</p>
  <p align="left">They  had learned to be optimistic, instead of giving themselves over to religious  pessimism, and were able to enjoy the gracious beauty of the world without the  rebuke of a morbid conscience. Sparrow preached more about the Loving Father of  the New Testament, and dwelt less on the jealous and angry God of the Jewish  theology. Alice and her husband had begun their work well, for they had  humanised two people by helpful kindness, and had their reward when they saw  the beaming looks of the couple.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And  Dr. Eberstein is at Tremore,&rdquo; said the vicar, when the motor-car was whirling  across the long, white moorland road. &ldquo;You will be pleased to see him, Mrs.  Montrose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of  course, Mr. Sparrow. Dr. Eberstein is the best friend my husband and I ever  had, or ever could have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  agree,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sparrow brightly. &ldquo;He is a most delightful man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  think so myself, and I approve of him,&rdquo; remarked the vicar thoughtfully, &ldquo;although  his views are scarcely orthodox. He believes in the strange doctrine of  Reincarnation; although I am bound to say he did not attempt to convert me to  his way of thinking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did  you attempt to convert him?&rdquo; asked Montrose, with twinkling eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  I did,&rdquo; confessed Mr. Sparrow, &ldquo;as it seemed a pity such a man should be in  error, and credit a pagan belief which has come down to us from the dark ages.  But he merely smiled and declined to argue. It is a great pity,&rdquo; repeated the  vicar regretfully, &ldquo;as he does much good and possesses a really fine nature.  However, we must not lose heart. He may yet change his views.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  scarcely think he will,&rdquo; said Montrose dryly. &ldquo;And as he is a servant of Christ  as you are, what does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There  is much to be said on that point,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Sparrow sententiously. &ldquo;For you  know that Christ said nothing about Reincarnation and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Edgar,&rdquo;  interrupted Mrs. Sparrow quickly, &ldquo;this is not the time to talk of such things.  Later, dear, later. Meanwhile, I am sure that Alice is anxious to know all that  has taken place in Polwellin since she went away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nothing  has taken place, Jane. Things remain as they were. Though I am glad to say,&rdquo; ended  the vicar hopefully, &ldquo;that the parishioners pay greater attention to my sermons  than they did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because  you preach more cheerfully, dear,&rdquo; said his wife, and then addressed herself to  Alice: &ldquo;Dame Trevel is quite reconciled to the loss of her son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Has  he not returned?&rdquo; asked the girl quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.  And the police cannot find him. He has vanished altogether, and as there was a  storm on the night he murdered Don Pablo, it is thought that he has been  drowned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is very probable,&rdquo; struck in the vicar. &ldquo;Job went away without his mates&mdash;urged  to flight by a guilty conscience no doubt&mdash;and so could not handle the heavy  boat by himself. I am sure he has been drowned. It is just as well&mdash;if you do  not think me harsh in saying so&mdash;for he would only have survived to be hanged,  and that would have broken his mother&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It  is already broken,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sparrow, with an expression of pain. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t  say the same for Rose Penwin,&rdquo; she added energetically. &ldquo;That misguided girl  has gone to London with the idea of appearing on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,  she is beautiful and clever. She may succeed as an actress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But  the temptations, Montrose! They are many. I consider Se&ntilde;or Narvaez did wrong in  putting such ideas into her head. Rose has been trained in my Sunday school,  and may resist temptation, but I dread the worst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  hope for the best. Let us not be hard on her, Edgar. We are none of us perfect,  you know, dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You  are,&rdquo; the vicar patted his wife&rsquo;s hand, and by so doing added the beauty of a  fond smile to her face. &ldquo;And I am sure Montrose thinks that his wife is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That  goes without saying,&rdquo; replied the newly made bridegroom, in high good humour. &ldquo;Here  is Polwellin at last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  villagers received the couple with loudly expressed joy, having an eye to the  future. Enistor had been a tyrant, and so desperately poor that he had extorted  the last penny of rent from those who could ill afford it. But the new Squire  and his wife were young, and rich, and soft-hearted, so the tenants hoped for  glorious times of peace and plenty. And the hope was duly fulfilled, for the  relationship between Polwellin and Tremore became much more friendly than it  had been in the old bad days. Douglas, as the vicar&rsquo;s right hand, laboured as  the Moses to his Aaron in dealing with the temporal prosperity of the parish,  while Alice acted as Lady Bountiful for ever and a day. Therefore, having such  true premonitions of a joyful future, it was no wonder that the bluff fishermen  and their tall womenfolk welcomed their benefactors with loud cheers and  smiling faces, as they called down profuse blessings on their young heads.</p>
  <p align="left">At  the foot of the hill rising to Tremore, Montrose and his wife sent on the car  with their luggage, and alighted to visit the grave of Enistor, which Alice  wished to do before re-entering her old home. The vicar and Mrs. Sparrow took  their departure, and the girl with her husband turned aside to the grey windy  God&rsquo;s acre wherein so many generations of the family were laid to rest. Here,  over the last Squire&rsquo;s remains, rose a broken column of white marble,  emblematic of his abruptly ended life. On its base was inscribed the name &ldquo;Korah  Enistor,&rdquo; with the date of birth and the time of death, together with the  significant text from the Psalms: &ldquo;Thou also shalt light my candle: the Lord my  God shall make my darkness to be light!&rdquo; None but Alice and her husband and  Eberstein understood the full meaning of the hopeful saying, therefore much  comment was made on its mystery. But aware that through God&rsquo;s mercy her father  had set his feet on the way of the Cross, which leads to Eternal Light, the  girl was able to pray for the dead without tears. Douglas also removed his hat  and offered up a petition for his former enemy, after which he led his wife  from the churchyard towards the great house on the hill.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Welcome!  Welcome! thrice welcome,&rdquo; said Dr. Eberstein, who waited for them with  outstretched hands at the door. &ldquo;Now indeed, made one by the sacrament of  marriage, do you step forward into the full sunshine of peace and joy, to work  for the Great Master by helping His children.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Alice  and her husband each clasped a hand, but could say nothing, as their hearts  were too full to speak. But the servants, headed by the smiling housekeeper,  demanded attention, so the young couple controlled their feelings and  graciously thanked one and all for their kindly greeting. Then the domestics  retired to a festival of eating and drinking in the kitchen, while Eberstein  conducted Douglas and Alice through many rooms which had been rendered brighter  and lighter by modern improvements. There was still the dark oak panelling, the  grave family portraits, the low ceilings and old-fashioned furniture. But  everything had been renovated in the best possible taste, and the effect of the  whole was less gloomy than it had been. But something more than furbishing up  rooms and furniture had been done to make the house feel so cheerful and  bright. What it was Alice could not say, and looked round with a puzzled air.  The doctor enjoyed her perplexity, and when he finally led the pair into the  library, guided the girl to one of the low casements. &ldquo;Do you see any change in  the ground?&rdquo; he asked, smiling.</p>
  <p align="left">Alice,  who had not taken notice of her surroundings when entering the house, looked  out wonderingly. The dark wood had a more cheerful appearance, as many of the  trees were budding with spring green, fresh and delicate, while the ever-leafy  branches of cedars and stone-pines and yews sparkled with the refreshment of a  light shower, so that they also hinted at renewed youth. But the greatest  marvel of all was that the space of beaten ground immediately surrounding the  house was covered with an emerald carpet of turf, and the golden crocus, the  pale snowdrop, and many violets were to be seen here, there, and everywhere  like gleams of faint many-coloured fire. Out of doors a new life seemed to  burgeon and bloom, while within there was a fresh living atmosphere, charged  with creative power and fertile with the promise of glorious doings, noble,  unselfish, holy. Quite unable to explain this mystic change from death to life,  which made Tremore a centre of joy and abiding tranquillity, Alice turned to  inquire mutely how the miracle had come about. Apparently Douglas knew, for  Douglas smiled; but he waited for the master to enlighten his wife.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I  have cleansed the house,&rdquo; said Eberstein gravely. &ldquo;All those forces of hate and  destruction, which created so evil an atmosphere, have been broken up and  dispersed. They had their source in the selfish thoughts of your father,  strongly accentuated by Don Pablo&rsquo;s wicked teaching. Now that the Squire is  dead and Narvaez has departed for ever, the shadow has lifted. By the  performance of a powerful ceremony I have exorcised the dark elementals. And  now&mdash;&rdquo; he touched Alice lightly between the eyes, bidding her use the  clairvoyant sense he had thus awakened.</p>
  <p align="left">The  room was filled with a luminous rosy light, alive with scintillation of diamond  brilliancy. And her sight, piercing the walls, beheld the whole house bathed in  this celestial radiance, although towards the back, where the servants  congregated, the clearness was somewhat dimmed by their ignorant thoughts of  self. Life was everywhere, pulsating in great waves, welling up gloriously from  the heart of the world, so that, within and without, Tremore was alive with the  splendour of unhampered force. Alice could now understand how the beaten ground  round the house, formerly rendered barren by hate, was now covered with verdure  and many-hued with flowers. Love was in the mansion, love was in the garden, love  was in the woodland, and that mighty power had caused the desert to blossom  like a rose. The light sang, softly, musical with the murmur of innumerable  bees, and the girl felt as though she were in the heart of an opalescent sphere  which vibrated with harmony. When her eyes looked again on physical things, the  doctor was speaking.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;See  that you do not disturb the harmony by any thought or word or deed of self.  Here you have a centre of holy power, to which those tormented by the warring  forces of the world can come to find peace and heavenly refreshment. Such in  the days of old were the shrines, whither pilgrims travelled for the healing of  their souls. You and your husband are the guardians of this place, and here  many weary men and women will come for solace. See that you send them not empty  away. A great trust is reposed in you, my children; a great work is given you  to do. Thank therefore the Christ who has chosen you for this service of love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">After  this solemn admonition, Eberstein became his usual quiet genial self, and  passed a very pleasant evening with the young couple. After dinner he  discoursed to them at length, giving many wise counsels, and instructing them  how to deal with the future. When they retired to rest he told them to rise at  sunrise and meet him in the garden, since it was his intention to leave Tremore  before breakfast. Knowing that he had much work to do, Douglas and Alice never  thought of pressing him to stay, although they greatly regretted that he could  not give them more of his company. They said little to one another, for all  that had taken place awed them considerably. But when the east was radiant with  the promise of another day, and awaking birds twittered amongst the darkling  trees, they came out on to the dewy lawn, to find their guest ready to depart.  He was dressed for travelling, his portmanteau was already on a motor, which  panted far away at the gate of the avenue, and in the silence of the dawn he  came forward to bid them farewell.</p>
  <p align="left">Taking  each by the hand, Eberstein led them to a small hill towards the back of the  house, where the sun could be seen rising over the undulating line of the  moorlands. An arc of fire was just showing above the horizon, and a splendour  of light was changing the rosy hues of the eastern sky into a golden haze.  Silently prayerful, the three stood looking at this aerial magnificence. It was  the doctor who spoke first.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;See  there the promise of your future,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;The darkness of the night  has fled away before the glory of the celestial orb. So have the black clouds  amidst which you walked of late been dispersed by the Sun of Righteousness,  which has risen with healing on His wings. You know what work you are appointed  to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Montrose gravely. &ldquo;Six months in the year Alice and I must live in London,  seeking out the lame, the halt, and the blind; both the spiritually sick and  the physically crippled. We must give to them money, attention, sympathy, love  and instruction, looking on every man as a brother and on every woman as a  sister, irrespective of race or creed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just  so,&rdquo; said Eberstein, nodding, &ldquo;because all are one, and you are in others as  others are in you, all being in the Father, through the Son by the power of the  Holy Spirit. And then?&rdquo; he turned to Alice.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For  six months in the year Douglas and I must live here,&rdquo; she said, equally  gravely, &ldquo;and here we must bring those who need rest and help. We must not  pauperise them by indiscriminate charity, but must teach each to become a  centre of power, to develop his or her latent faculties. Finally, we must never  think of self, but let the Power of Good flow through us unhindered by selfish  desire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just  so,&rdquo; said Eberstein again, and smiled approvingly. &ldquo;Remember that to be  channels of the Divine power you must surrender all. A single thought of self  and the channel is choked. Freely the power is given to you, so freely must you  give it to others, and in passing through you on its beneficent mission it will  cleanse you both body and soul, strengthening each so that you may be strong,  wholesome servants of The Christ. You have learned your lesson well, my  children, so it only remains for me to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We  shall see you again, I hope?&rdquo; asked Douglas anxiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh,  yes,&rdquo; responded the doctor cheerfully. &ldquo;Every year I shall come and stay with  you, for there is much instruction in higher things to be given. By following  the Master and living as nearly as possible His gracious life, you will refine  your physical bodies to such a degree that in time you will be able to link up  with the desire body and the mental body&mdash;consciously, that is. Already every  night you both work and help in the next world, although you cannot yet  remember what you do. But when the time is ripe you will remember, and  consciously pass from this world to the other. Afterwards you will pass  consciously from the desire world to the mental sphere, and so you will work  constantly on three planes as the servants of Him who died on the Cross. Think  then, my children, how glorious is your future.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The  faces of both brightened, but Douglas spoke rather mournfully. &ldquo;There is much  to do in the physical world alone,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Look at the unrest that  prevails everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Be  of good courage, my son. This unrest you fear shows how rapidly humanity is  progressing. This is the era of individualisation, when each has to think for  himself. Is it then any wonder that opposing wills clash, when all are so  ignorant? But Chaos must precede Cosmos, and the human race is in a very hot  furnace being shaped towards the ends intended by the God of All. The inner  teaching is being given out freely to the West and to the East, to the North  and to the South, therefore is a new spirit being infused into all religions  for the enlightenment of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Into  all  religions?&rdquo; questioned Alice dubiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes!  All the great religions are true in their essence, for all worship the One True  God in Trinity, or in Duality, or in Unity. What men quarrel over and what they  reprobate are only those external things which have been added by the ignorance  of man. But the time is at hand when such errors will be dispelled, and then  all religions will be unified by the Blessed One. To this nation and that God  has spoken in different ways: soon He will speak to all with one mighty voice,  and all men will learn that they are the sons of one great Father.  Notwithstanding the turmoil of the present, be of good cheer, I say, for &lsquo;All  things work together for good,&rsquo; as St. Paul has set forth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">In  the glory of the sun, now wholly above the horizon, Alice and her husband  walked down the avenue to where the motor-car throbbed as if impatient to  start. There was a clean, fresh look about the world, as if it had been newly  made, and although husband and wife were a trifle sad at the departure of  Eberstein, yet their hearts were singing with joy, and they were filled with  gratitude to God for what He had done for them.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Farewell,  and may the Master bless you,&rdquo; said Eberstein, from the body of the car. &ldquo;When  I come again let me find that you have worked in the vineyard as true  labourers. And so&mdash;&rdquo; he traced the sign of the cross in the air, and Alice saw  it visibly outlined in dazzling light as the motor sped swiftly down the hill,  through Polwellin and towards Perchton over the purple moors.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dear!&rdquo;  Douglas took his wife in his arms, &ldquo;do not cry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;These  are joyful tears, I think,&rdquo; said Alice, smiling. &ldquo;God is so good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Let  us try to show ourselves worthy of His goodness,&rdquo; replied the young man, with  an answering smile. &ldquo;Come, dear, our work awaits us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And  in the glory of the spring morning, under the budding green of the trees, and  across the soft grass of the lawn, they passed into their dear home, no longer  the house of hate, but the Mansion Beautiful, wherein great works were to be  done by them in their day and generation.</p>
