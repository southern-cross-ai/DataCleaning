          <i>The Seagate Mystery</i></b></h2>
  <p align="left">In the month of May, a  young man was walking slowly up and down the London, Chatham and Dover platform  of the Victoria station. It was close on twelve and he glanced from the clock  to the train, which was timed to leave for Margate at noon. This intended  passenger was dressed in deep mourning and there was a haggard expression on  his face which betrayed anxiety. Judging from his garb and ill-suppressed  grief, he had but lately lost a near relative.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nearly twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;  he uttered, looking at his watch to verify the station time, &ldquo;and the train  starts at five past. I am afraid Dillock will be late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Even as he spoke the man  whom he expected emerged from the ticket office, and walked straight towards  him. A tall, sober-looking individual was the newcomer, with a keen inquisitive  look on his clean-shaven face. His appearance, smart and alert, was that of a  barrister, and he was frequently mistaken for a member of the legal profession.  As a matter of fact, if not a lawyer, he was closely connected with the law,  for he was well known as Dillock, one of the cleverest of London detectives.  Taken in conjunction with the mourning garb of the young man, his appearance on  the spot was ominous of evil. It looked as though Dillock were engaged in the  investigation of a possible crime.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just in time, Mr.  Dillock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very sorry, Mr.  Halston, couldn&rsquo;t get here any sooner,&rdquo; replied the detective smartly. &ldquo;I came  as quick as a hansom could bring me. After all I am in time, with five minutes  to spare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, about this case&mdash;&rdquo;  began Halston, when the other cut him short.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can tell me all  about it in the train. Can we get a carriage to ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; said  Halston, beckoning to the guard. &ldquo;I engaged one on purpose so that we should  not be disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock jumped in,  followed by Halston, the guard locked the door, and in a few minutes the train  moved slowly out of the station. The two men settled themselves comfortably and  proceeded to discuss the matter which had brought them together. Halston  lighted a cigar and offered his case to the detective. Dillock declined the  courtesy, and producing his pocket-book for the purpose of taking notes,  plunged at once into business. He was a man who knew the value of time.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I had no time to speak  this morning, Mr. Halston,&rdquo; he said, apologetically, &ldquo;as I had to finish off  another case, else I could not have got away to-day. Consequently, beyond a  glimpse of the papers, I know nothing of this matter. You must tell me about it  as minutely as possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all I  know,&rdquo; said Halston, gloomily, &ldquo;unfortunately, I was not at Seagate when my  cousin was killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rudolph Carrant is the  name of the deceased,&rdquo; observed Dillock, glancing at the newspaper, &ldquo;your  cousin!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, My cousin! He was  two years older than I, and engaged to be married to Miss Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; said the  detective, in a vague kind of way, as though such an engagement had no special  interest for him, &ldquo;He was to be married. Very sad! Very sad indeed. By the  way,&rdquo; he added, looking up from his paper, this report says he fell over the  cliff and was killed. Is that correct?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes! It was supposed he  fell over,&rdquo; said Halston, with marked emphasis.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Supposed! eh?&rdquo; was the  significant comment of Dillock</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have my suspicions.  They may be groundless; still, I can&rsquo;t help suspecting that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That he was pushed  over,&rdquo; finished Dillock, putting the idea into words.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Precisely! That he was  pushed over. It was not an accident, but a murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you any idea of  the motive for the crime?&rdquo; queried Dillock, looking keenly at the gloomy face  of the other.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I believe robbery was  the motive. In fact, I am certain of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Robbery! Hm! Money?  Jewels?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, papers!&rdquo; said the  young man, with evident reluctance. &ldquo;Yes, papers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Papers! Have you any  idea of their nature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I have not the  least idea. I know nothing of my cousin&rsquo;s private affairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then why do you suspect  that your deceased cousin was robbed of papers, or why, Mr. Halston,&rdquo; added  Dillock, slowly, &ldquo;why do you think there was any foul play in the matter. It  might be, as the papers say, an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Cecil Halston had a fair  and delicate complexion like that of a woman, and blushed with indignation at  this speech. Knowing what he did, it seemed absurd that any one should hold a  contrary opinion. He was prepared to substantiate his suspicions.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was not an  accident,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly. &ldquo;My cousin was murdered and robbed. I do not  agree with the jury. Their verdict is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For answer, Dillock read  aloud the description of the case reported in &ldquo;The Morning Courier.&rdquo; It was  bald and unsatisfying.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;An inquest was held  yesterday on the body of Mr. Rudolph Carrant, who fell over the cliff at  Seagate on the fourteenth day of this month. The deceased was found on the  morning of the fifteenth lying at the foot of the cliff with his neck broken.  Dr. Maxwell said death must have been instantaneous. The unfortunate gentleman was engaged to be married to Miss Catherine Granville, daughter of Sir  Algernon Granville, and was at his house on the night of the accident. He left  there at ten o&rsquo;clock for the purpose of going to his hotel, and it is supposed  that he mistook the path and so fell over the cliff. The jury brought in a  verdict of death by misadventure. Much sympathy is felt in the district for  Miss Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">When he finished reading  this delectable report, Dillock laid the paper on the seat beside him, and  proceeded to discuss the matter. Halston was prepared for this  cross-examination.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is that report correct,  Mr. Halston?&rdquo; he asked, rubbing his chin.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In the main it is  perfectly correct,&rdquo; replied the other, doubtfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And the jury brought in  a verdict of accidental death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So it seems,&rdquo; said  Halston, coldly; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t agree with that verdict.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You believe Mr. Carrant  was murdered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do! Murdered and  robbed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Robbed of papers, you  say?&rdquo; queried Dillock, looking down.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. At least, that is  the only motive I can conjecture as reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were not called as  a witness at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. There was no reason  that I should be called,&rdquo; said Halston, promptly. &ldquo;Besides, I was in Paris when  the inquest was held. I was not subp&oelig;naed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What! Not when you  guessed your cousin had been murdered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did not know that at  the time,&rdquo; responded the young man with some hesitation. &ldquo;You see my cousin  died on the fourteenth of this month. It is now the twentieth. The inquest, as  you see, has been held, and he is now buried. I returned to England for the  funeral. It was then that I fancied the cause of his death was other than  accidental.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What made you think  so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A conversation I had  with Sir Algernon Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Dillock,  suddenly. &ldquo;Then this idea of foul play is not your own?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. It is the idea of  Sir Algernon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand,  Mr. Halston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will explain. On the  night of the fourteenth, Rudolph was at Sir Algernon&rsquo;s place at Seagate. There  was some card playing and my cousin won ten pounds. Sir Algernon gave him a  bank note for that amount and he placed it in his pocket-book. I know that  pocket-book very well,&rdquo; added Halston, speaking rapidly, &ldquo;having often seen it  in my cousin&rsquo;s possession. It is of shagreen, with his crest and monogram in  silver on the outside, and the corners are also bound with silver. You follow  me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; replied  Dillock, scribbling this description in his note-book, &ldquo;and Mr. Carrant had it  in his possession on the night in question&mdash;Had it in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So Sir Algernon says.  He saw Rudolph place the ten-pound note therein. Then he went away and the next  morning was found dead at the foot of the cliff. But the pocket-book was gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah! The pocket-book was  gone,&rdquo; said Dillock, in a casual kind of fashion.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. It had been  abstracted from his breast-coat pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was he not in evening  dress?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was, certainly. But  he had a breast pocket in his dress coat, an inner pocket, and it was there  that Sir Algernon saw him place the book containing the note.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So you think that Mr.  Carrant was robbed and murdered for the sake of that ten-pound note?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what other  conclusion one can arrive at.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You said something  about papers,&rdquo; hinted Mr. Dillock, artfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, he might have  been robbed for papers, or for money, I don&rsquo;t know which,&rdquo; replied Halston,  impatiently. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, Mr. Dillock, my cousin was not a very  reputable person. He knew many scamps, and it is just possible that his  pocket-book may have contained papers likely to be of value to some of his  disreputable acquaintances. You know from experience what these kind of people  are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It might be so,  certainly,&rdquo; said Dillock, thoughtfully, &ldquo;it is more likely that a man would rob  your cousin of papers which he knew were in his possession than of a ten-pound  note of which he knew nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He might have guessed  Rudolph had money on him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Possibly! But that  special ten-pound note was only won off Sir Algernon at cards on the night in  question. No one could have known Mr. Carrant had that in his possession when  he left the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Except Sir Algernon,&rdquo;  said Halston, significantly.</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock played with his  watch chain and did not answer this question directly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can  throw suspicion on him,&rdquo; he said, at length, raising his eyebrows, &ldquo;if he had  anything to do with this matter he would have held his tongue about the  robbery, particularly as the jury brought in a verdict of accidental death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You then agree with me  that my cousin was murdered?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The loss of that  pocket-book is suspicious,&rdquo; said Dillock, declining to commit himself to any  opinion. &ldquo;If your cousin had fallen accidentally over the cliff, it is probable  that the pocketbook would still be in his possession&mdash;unless,&rdquo; added the  detective, after a momentary pause, &ldquo;someone had a grudge against him and took  away the pocket-book so as to foster the idea of robbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly it might be  that. A murder, and to avert suspicion, a pretended robbery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you know anyone who  had a grudge against him?&rdquo; asked Dillock, seeing his companion answered  somewhat absently and was in deep thought. Halston wriggled uncomfortably and  dropped his eyes before the keen gaze of the detective which seemed to read his  very soul.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to cast  suspicion on anyone,&rdquo; he said, at length, with a frown.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you any  suspicions?&rdquo; asked Dillock, sharply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes and no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What does that mean.  You speak in riddles. Give me the key to them. You mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Simply this!&rdquo; burst out  Halston, rapidly. &ldquo;I say that my cousin was robbed, if not of money, at least  of some papers he carried in that shagreen pocket-book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is Sir Algernon&rsquo;s  idea,&rdquo; corrected the detective, &ldquo;not your own. I wish to know your own  suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have none. At least,  I have no very definite suspicions of any consequence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes you have,&rdquo;  persisted Dillock. &ldquo;Come, Mr. Halston, you have told me everything so far, why  not continue to repose confidence in me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I might say that  Rudolph&rsquo;s death was accidental.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You might, but you will  not do so. Your story of the pocket-book gives the lie to that. Come, Mr.  Halston,&rdquo; he said, again in a persuasive manner. &ldquo;You suspect some one. I can  read your face like an open book. You suspect some one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; responded  Halston, with manifest reluctance.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And his name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hugh Oliphant! He is  the man I suspect, but I am by no means certain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked  Dillock, taking no notice other than the name.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A gentleman of  independent fortune,&rdquo; sneered Halston, &ldquo;and a discarded lover of Miss  Granville&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Dillock,  pricking up his ears, &ldquo;then he was naturally jealous of Mr. Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very jealous indeed. Of  course, I don&rsquo;t speak from personal knowledge, as I know Oliphant but slightly.  I simply say what was told to me by Rudolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did he tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That Oliphant hated him  because he was going to marry Miss Granville, and would gladly put him out of  the way if he could.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Had Mr. Carrant any  tangible reason for such an opinion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, that I cannot tell  you,&rdquo; responded Halston, frankly. &ldquo;He said no more than that. My idea is that  Oliphant met Rudolph on that fatal night and that in a quarrel which ensued my  cousin fell over the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Put it in plain words,  Mr. Halston,&rdquo; said Dillock, quietly. &ldquo;You mean that Oliphant pushed Carrant  over the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo;  answered Halston, fencing with his questioner.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, but you think so,&rdquo;  persisted the detective, looking at him steadily.</p>
  <p align="left">Halston bit his lips in  an angry fashion and looked gloomily downward.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You forced it out of  me,&rdquo; he declared, sullenly. &ldquo;I did not wish to tell you. I have no grudge  against Oliphant, but I really and truly believe that he knows more about my  cousin&rsquo;s death than anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I quite appreciate your  reluctance, Mr. Halston,&rdquo; said the detective, quietly, &ldquo;it is very chivalrous  but, if you will pardon me saying so, very foolish. It is your duty to discover  the assassin of your cousin, and if you suspect Oliphant you are quite right to  say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But he may be  innocent,&rdquo; demurred Halston, faintly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You may be sure I shall  give him the benefit of every doubt,&rdquo; responded Dillock, drily. &ldquo;By the way,  did Miss Granville love Oliphant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; as she  was to marry Rudolph I suppose she did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She might have been  engaged to your cousin against her will, hence the jealously between the two  men. Was your cousin rich?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very rich. He had  twenty thousand a year. I am his heir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I congratulate you,&rdquo;  said Dillock gravely, &ldquo;and Sir Algernon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is as hard up as it is  possible for any one to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then he doubtless  forced his daughter to marry Carrant on account of its being a good match.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t  say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Halston was growing  restive under this prolonged examination which had now lasted over two hours.  The train would soon be in at Seagate, so as Dillock had learned nearly all he  wished to know, he desisted from further questioning, and permitted his  companion to busy himself in a book. Meanwhile he glanced over his notes and  did his best to think out the case.</p>
  <p align="left">It perplexed him  greatly. There were two theories equally feasible. One that Carrant was killed  to gain possession of certain valuable papers, and the other that Oliphant had  deliberately murdered him in a frenzy of jealous passion. The former was the  most probable, as it was scarcely likely Oliphant would be so foolish as to  commit a crime for such a trivial cause as jealously. Certainly, it appeared  trivial to the detective, but it might not be so to Oliphant, yet Dillock could  not comprehend the state of mind which could drive a man into periling his neck  for the sake of a woman. He was rather misogynistic.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I must see this  Oliphant,&rdquo; he thought, as the train gradually slowed down; &ldquo;from his demeanour  I can tell plainly his attitude towards this girl and her dead lover. As to the  pocket-book&mdash;if that has been stolen it will be a more difficult matter to trace  it&mdash;unless,&rdquo; he considered with an after-thought, &ldquo;the note affords a clue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As soon as this idea  entered his brain he asked Halston a question.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you know if Sir  Algernon has the number of that ten-pound note he gave to Carrant in payment of  his loss at cards?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;  responded Halston, promptly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not the man to do anything in a business-like  way. I shouldn&rsquo;t think it likely. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Dillock,  slowly, &ldquo;if I can trace that note I&rsquo;ll be able to lay my hand on the man who  killed your cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
          <i>The Busybody</i></b></h2>
  <p align="left">Sir Algernon Granville  could hardly be called an estimable personage. He was profoundly egotistical  and deemed his fellow creatures were created for the purpose of ministering to  his pleasures. Married at an early age when he had some thought for others, his  wife had died after three years of married life leaving him a comfortable  fortune and one daughter. She desired to settle the fortune on her child but  Sir Algernon persuaded her from adopting this sensible course, and promised  faithfully to hold the money in trust for Catherine.</p>
  <p align="left">As a matter of fact, he  had no intention of exercising such self-denial. The child at that time was  only two years of age and therefore had no necessity for money. Thus argued her  father, and placing Catherine under the care of his only sister, Mrs. Devereaux,  proceeded to enjoy himself. He did this so excellently well and showed such  skill in spending money, that by the time Catherine was of age he had scarce a  sixpence to bless himself with.</p>
  <p align="left">To make matters worse,  Mrs. Devereaux died at this very critical time and Catherine was sent back to  her father. Sir Algernon had hoped that his sister would leave the girl a  second fortune of which he might have the spending, but such proved not to be  the case. All Mrs. Devereaux possessed was an annuity and as this passed away  when she died, Catherine was returned to her indignant parent as poor as when  she left him.</p>
  <p align="left">The baronet was  seriously angry and frequently asked himself how he was to support this young  lady who required money, dresses and amusements. He quite forgot that he had  spent the money which was rightfully hers and felt himself very much aggrieved  at the prospect of taking charge of his child. Matters, however, could not be  altered, so he made a virtue of necessity and took charge of Catherine with  many protestations that he intended to be a model father.</p>
  <p align="left">His idea of the r&ocirc;le was  getting the girl married to a wealthy husband, and he set to work at once.  Unfortunately, in his own set, a rather fast one, there was no very eligible  suitor, so he looked round to see who was worthy, in point of income, to be his  son-in-law. Ultimately he fixed upon Rudolph Carrant, who had a large fortune  and no morals. This latter state of things mattered little to Sir Algernon so  long as the money was safe, and having presented Carrant to his daughter as a  suitor he commanded her to inveigle him into marriage by all the feminine arts  at her command.</p>
  <p align="left">To his wrath and  astonishment, Catherine, a handsome, high-spirited girl, absolutely refused to  adopt this ignoble course. She did not like Carrant, who was a gambler and a  profligate, and declined to sell herself for a comfortable home. Her own was  miserable enough, what with straitened means and a cantankerous father, but she  preferred even such misery to the degradation of becoming the wife of a man  whom she knew to be an unconscionable blackguard. Moreover, this was the  strongest reason of all, she was in love with Hugh Oliphant.</p>
  <p align="left">He was the scion of an  old Scotch family with a long pedigree and a lean purse. Three hundred a year  represented his entire income, and when he hinted to Sir Algernon that he loved  Catherine and would gladly make her his wife, the baronet was filled with wrath  at the idea of a pauper daring to aspire to the hand of his child. With furious  words he turned Oliphant out of the house, and despite Catherine&rsquo;s indignant  tears, ordered her to marry Carrant at once. Furthermore, to make things safe  and put an end to Oliphant&rsquo;s foolish hopes, he took his daughter down to  Seagate, at which place he hoped to marry her to Rudolph Carrant.</p>
  <p align="left">To do the latter  justice, he was very much in love with Catherine, and swore if he married her,  to give up his wild ways and bad companions. He came down to Seagate at the  request of Sir Algernon, and there took up his abode at the nearest hotel. At  this time he behaved himself excellently well and was most devoted in his  attentions to the girl he adored. She did not want his attentions, she did not  care about his promises of reformation; all she desired was to marry Hugh  Oliphant, and this desire she was unable to gratify.</p>
  <p align="left">Her father watched her  like a lynx. Carrant had promised to allow him a good income after the  marriage, so Sir Algernon was quite prepared to sell his daughter in order to  secure the same. He was determined to lose no opportunity of obtaining this  settlement, and never let his daughter out of his sight. At all hours he was by  her side, much to the admiration of the neighbourhood, who greatly admired such  a devoted parent. The neighbourhood was quite unaware that the aforesaid  devoted parent was on the eve of selling his child to a drunkard for the  furthering of his own selfish ends.</p>
  <p align="left">Hugh Oliphant was left  behind in town to forget Catherine as he best could, but not being a mild young  man, declined to acquiesce in this infamous arrangement which, if carried  through, would rob him of his promised wife, and devote her to life-long  misery. He came down to Seagate, and despite the keen eyes of Sir Algernon,  managed to have some conversation with Catherine.</p>
  <p align="left">In this interview he represented  that she owed nothing to so selfish a parent and would assuredly be forced to  marry Carrant if she stayed, therefore, he proposed that she should fly with  him. It required but little persuasion to gain Catherine&rsquo;s consent to this  course, for she was herself heartily sick of her heartless father and debauched  lover. To the joy of Oliphant she agreed to elope with him, and he made all  preparations for flight, but, on the very eve of fulfilment, their house of  cards was knocked down by the hand of Fate.</p>
  <p align="left">On the 16th of May they  arranged to get married in London. On the 14th of May the obstacle to their  union was removed by the death of Rudolph Carrant. Under these circumstances  Catherine judged it best to wait, and if possible, persuade her father into a  more reasonable frame of mind. Hugh consented to this course as there was no  help for it, but he sorely grudged the postponement of the day which would turn  Catherine Granville into Mrs. Hugh Oliphant. Sir Algernon was not to be trusted  in any way.</p>
  <p align="left">After that untoward  death of Carrant&rsquo;s, the spirits of Sir Algernon fell to zero. He wanted money  very badly, and it seemed hard to him to lose the big fish for which he so  arduously angled. There was no one else to whom he could marry his daughter,  yet he did not despair, and once more looked around for a wealthy and  complaisant son-in-law. His daughter hinted at Oliphant, but Sir Algernon put  his foot down on that with determination.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oliphant, indeed,&rdquo; he  said, angrily, &ldquo;a beggarly younger son with a pauper&rsquo;s income. I suppose he  thinks because Carrant is dead that I&rsquo;ll let you marry him. I&rsquo;ll do no such  thing. As you can&rsquo;t marry poor Rudolph you must marry his cousin and  heir-at-law, Cecil Halston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What, that effeminate  looking person,&rdquo; cried Catherine, in dismay. &ldquo;I shall do nothing of the sort,  papa. I wish to marry a man like&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Like Oliphant, I  suppose,&rdquo; sneered her father. &ldquo;You shall marry whom I choose, and that wretched  Oliphant is not my choice. It is my duty as a father to look after your  well-being, and I have decided that you shall marry Cecil Halston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t love him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. He  can make good settlements.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t love  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, perhaps he  doesn&rsquo;t love you yet,&rdquo; said Sir Algernon, affably, &ldquo;but he will do so soon. He  told me that he admired you very much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">With this prospect  Catherine began to think she would ultimately be forced to revert to her old  plan and fly with Hugh. But since Carrant&rsquo;s funeral her father never let her  out of his sight, and looked over all incoming and outgoing letters, so she was  quite unable to either communicate with, or gain a sight of her lover.</p>
  <p align="left">Meanwhile Sir Algernon  ingratiated himself with Halston, and gave his opinion regarding the death of  Carrant. The heir was unwilling to take steps on so slender an assumption as  robbery and was inclined to agree with the jury in the verdict ascribing the  death to an accident. Nevertheless Sir Algernon was so certain that Carrant had  met with foul play, that to quieten his scruples, Halston was forced to call in  the aid of a detective. Hence his journey to London and his engagement of  Dillock to find out the true cause of Rudolph Carrant&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p align="left">In his hints that  Oliphant was mixed up in the crime, there was without doubt a suspicion of  jealousy in the mind of Halston. He knew that Catherine loved Hugh and that  Carrant stood in the way of their coming together, therefore he was by no means  certain but that Oliphant might not have purposely killed his rival and so  removed an obstacle from his path. These suspicions he imparted to Dillock,  though he did so very unwillingly, as he had really no grounds for so base an  accusation. What Dillock thought about the matter remains to be seen. He was  not a man of many words, and valued his professional reputation too highly to  commit himself to a rash opinion. On arriving at Seagate about three o&rsquo;clock,  Halston took the detective to his hotel, where they had something to eat, and  then walked him along the parade to call on Sir Algernon Granville. The  baronet&rsquo;s house was at the extreme end of Seagate, so the detective and his  companion had to walk the full length of the parade. Towards the termination of  the asphalted walk, Halston touched Dillock on the arm.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you see that fair  man in the grey tweed suit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Walking rapidly  towards us. What about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is Oliphant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The man whom you  suspect?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; said  Halston, angrily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly suspect him. But this is the man who loves  Miss Granville and who hated my unfortunate cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; remarked  Dillock, calmly, and kept his eye on the approaching figure.</p>
  <p align="left">Hugh was a handsome  young fellow of thirty, with an open candid countenance. He was quietly dressed  and wore no jewellery. With his shoulders well back he had the air of a soldier,  and walked rapidly past Halston with a cold nod in answer to the stiff  salutation of the latter. In that moment Dillock had rapidly taken in all the  points of which he wished to be cognizant, and did not turn his head when  Oliphant had passed them.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Are you not going to  look at him?&rdquo; asked Halston in a vexed tone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have looked,&rdquo;  responded Dillock, leisurely. &ldquo;I saw him thoroughly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He does not look like a  man who would commit a base action.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is to be hoped he is  innocent,&rdquo; said Halston, rather annoyed by this remark, &ldquo;but things certainly  look black against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that, Mr.  Halston. As yet we have no proof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He has no doubt laid  his plans excellently well,&rdquo; said the other, with a sneer.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Does he love Miss  Granville very much?&rdquo; asked Dillock, suddenly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Confound him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock whistled. He saw  now the reason why Halston was so bitter against the lover of Catherine. It was  once more the inevitable woman.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s jealous,&rdquo; thought  the detective, as they stopped before Sir Algernon&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;She must be a  pretty girl, Miss Granville. Carrant, Oliphant, Halston, all in love with her.  I hope she&rsquo;ll be present during this interview.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Unfortunately Dillock&rsquo;s  desire was not gratified. Only Sir Algernon was in the room when they entered.  He was a fat little man with a perpetual simper, and a pair of shifty grey eyes  that by no means ingratiated him with the detective. That individual was a keen  reader of character and he disliked Sir Algernon the moment he set eyes on his  face.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad face,&rdquo;  decided Dillock, as he acknowledged the baronet&rsquo;s effusive greeting. &ldquo;If the  daughter is like the father, Carrant had a lucky escape even at the cost of his  life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Sir Algernon made his  visitors sit down, apologised for the non-appearance of his daughter, whom he  said was lying down quite worn out with grief, and began at once to talk of the  business which had brought Dillock to Seagate.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he said,  rubbing his fat hands together, &ldquo;and what do you think of this matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can hardly form an  opinion yet, Sir Algernon,&rdquo; replied Dillock, coolly, &ldquo;as I am not yet in  possession of all the facts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Mr. Halston tell  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I told him all I  could,&rdquo; interrupted Halston, &ldquo;but of course my information is second hand. You  tell your story, Sir Algernon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This was precisely what  the baronet wanted. There was nothing he liked better than to hear himself  talk. As an orator he was unsurpassable&mdash;in his own opinion.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are of course  aware,&rdquo; he said to Dillock, &ldquo;that the late Mr. Carrant was engaged to my poor  daughter, Miss Granville?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Mr. Halston  informed me of that fact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She feels the loss very  deeply&mdash;very deeply indeed. Mr. Carrant was devotedly attached to her. He came  down here at my request so as to be near her, and sometimes at night we played  cards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You were playing on the  night of the fourteenth,&rdquo; said Dillock, consulting his notes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We were. Not for high  stakes. Oh dear no. But for just sufficient to add excitement to the game. I  lost ten pounds and paid it to Mr. Carrant in a ten pound note.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was anyone else  playing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. My daughter had  retired early with a bad headache and we were quite alone in the room. We  merely played cards for a little distraction and I lost ten pounds. I gave Mr.  Carrant a ten pound note as I have said, and he placed it in his pocket-book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you the number of  that note?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I regret to say  that I have not. I am not a business man, my good sir,&rdquo; said the baronet,  lightly, &ldquo;so did not trouble myself about such a small matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t prove a small matter  if I get the right number,&rdquo; observed Dillock, grimly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because you say Mr.  Carrant placed that note in his pocket book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. In a shagreen  pocket book with silver edges&mdash;also a silver crest and monogram. I admired the  workmanship and examined the pocket book. Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; repeated  Dillock, calmly, &ldquo;that book was in Mr. Carrant&rsquo;s pocket when he left the house.  It was not there when his body was found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s true  enough,&rdquo; said Halston, approvingly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In the interval it must  have been stolen. Now then,&rdquo; said Dillock, raising his forefinger, &ldquo;whomsoever  stole that book probably murdered Mr. Carrant. He will try and get rid of the  note&mdash;if I know the number I can nail him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Dear! dear!&rdquo; said Sir  Algernon, much astonished at this view of the case, &ldquo;what a pity I have not got  the number.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where did you get the  note?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;From my bank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is the name of  your bank and what cheque did you draw?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The Liberty Bank; I  drew a cheque for twenty pounds and sent it up to be cashed. They sent back two  five pound and one ten pound note.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Dillock,  making a note. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the numbers from your bank. Now one other question,  Sir Algernon. Was Mr. Carrant sober when he left your house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo;  hesitated Sir Algernon, glancing at Halston. &ldquo;He was, I am afraid, a little  elevated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not sufficient to make  him fall over the cliff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, dear no! In fact, I  wonder he went near the cliff at all. There was no necessity for him to do so.  Along the road was his nearest way to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are well acquainted  with the topography of this place, Sir Algernon,&rdquo; said Dillock, rising, &ldquo;so I  think we will continue this conversation outside. I wish to see the place where  Mr. Carrant is supposed to have fallen over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The baronet consented at  once, and the three men went out to view the scene of the accident&mdash;or crime.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
          <i>A Strange Discovery</i></b></h2>
  <p align="left">Seagate consists of a  cluster of red-hued houses, built after a somewhat quaint fashion, which stand  back some distance from the shore. Directly in front a garden with walks not  unlike Devonshire lanes stretches the length of the sea front. On an equal  level a gravelled path winds along, and below, at the foot of a steep bank,  extends a broad asphalt parade verging on the ocean. At one end stands a many  gabled house, at the other stretches a smooth green sward from the hedge which  separates it from the road down to the white cliffs. It was at this point that  Carrant met with his fatal accident.</p>
  <p align="left">The three men strolled  down to the glass-box kind of erection which serves to keep the keen winds from  invalid visitors, and stood on the edge of the cliffs looking towards Margate.  In the bright sunshine they could see the pier running out to sea, the huddled  mass of houses lying thick together on the hill after the fashion of San Remo,  and high above all the square grey tower of the church. What with the sunshine,  the blue water, the white cliffs and the gaily dressed throng on the parade the  whole scene was eminently picturesque; but they had no time to admire the view.  Hither they came to see the spot where Carrant met his death, and to find, if  possible, some evidence of the crime. Leaving the glass shelter, Sir Algernon  guided Halston and the detective along the coast-guard&rsquo;s path.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You see there is a  notice warning people not to go beyond this low bank lest they fall over the  cliff,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a board. &ldquo;Carrant, I presume, neglected that  warning and so was doomed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He could not very well  read that notice at night,&rdquo; objected Halston, ironically.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No doubt, sir, but he  frequently saw it during the day,&rdquo; retorted Sir Algernon, in a rather heated  tone. &ldquo;I myself pointed it out to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Here and there a chasm  yawned inward from the sea, but was railed off by a stout fence so that no one  with ordinary caution could possibly come to harm. At one portion the cliff ran  out in a kind of platform and beyond this a kind of tall monolith stood alone  and defiant. Between it and the cliff ran the currents when the tide was full,  but now as they looked over the crumbling edge they saw but an expanse of evil  smelling seaweed and greenish fungus.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo;  said Sir Algernon, pointing cheerfully downward with his stick. &ldquo;The body was  found between that pillar and the cliff. He was quite dead when discovered, as  his neck had been broken by the fall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The baronet spoke calmly  with no regret for the dead man. He sorrowed for him it is true, but merely in  a selfish fashion as Carrant&rsquo;s death had thwarted his aims. Now, with a  prospect of marrying Halston to his daughter, Sir Algernon could afford to be  cheerful and talk calmly of the tragedy. One son-in-law was the same as another  to this model father, so long as he gained a large income. The egotistical old  man gave no thought to his daughter&rsquo;s feelings.</p>
  <p align="left">Perhaps Dillock, inured  as he was to human selfishness, guessed this, for he turned away from his  simpering guide with a look of disgust and examined the place carefully. How  Rudolph Carrant had approached so near to the edge he could not conjecture,  unless he had been led thither by his assassin, and then the latter must have  given some powerful reason to have induced even a half-drunken man to place  himself in so perilous a position. Therein lay the mystery of the crime. On  viewing the spot, Dillock was quite convinced that Carrant&rsquo;s fall was not the  result of an accident. No man would have come so near the edge of the cliff,  especially as the fact of the raised bank would have warned him of his  dangerous proximity to the verge. Certainly Carrant, according to Granville&rsquo;s  evidence, was partially intoxicated, but even then he would not have been so  foolhardy.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Mr. Dillock,&rdquo;  said Sir Algernon, impatiently, &ldquo;do you think I am right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I certainly think  Carrant was murdered, if that&rsquo;s what you mean,&rdquo; said Dillock, looking around.  &ldquo;No man would be such a fool as to come beyond that path.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But even if someone was  with him, how could he be induced to come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, that I don&rsquo;t know,  Mr. Halston, I have come here to find that out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock knelt down on  the coarse grass and looked over the edge of the cliff. The tide was out and he  saw plainly where the body had lain. The margin whereon he rested was very  loose and crumbly and he could easily understand how a man, standing on the  extreme edge, could be pushed over before he had time to utter a cry.</p>
  <p align="left">While thus engaged he  heard Sir Algernon utter an ejaculation of rage. Looking up in some surprise he  saw the young man whom Halston had pointed out as Hugh Oliphant step over the  bank and advance towards the baronet. Dillock rather congratulated himself on  this unexpected meeting, as he wished to understand precisely the terms on  which Oliphant stood with Catherine&rsquo;s father.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sir Algernon,&rdquo; said  Hugh, looking very pale, &ldquo;I must apologise for thus forcing my company on you,  but I have called three times at your house and each time have been denied  admission. You thus leave me no option but to speak to you when I have the  opportunity&mdash;as now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The young man spoke in a  perfectly quiet and courteous tone, but Sir Algernon&rsquo;s smile had vanished and  he looked very angry as he made answer:</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I really do not know  why you thus intrude, sir. I have already intimated my desire that our  acquaintance should cease. My daughter,&rdquo; added the old man, pompously, &ldquo;is of  the same opinion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That I can scarcely  believe, Sir Algernon,&rdquo; replied Oliphant, deliberately.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You doubt me, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I believe that your  daughter loves me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The baronet looked  apprehensively at Halston, who changed colour at this speech. If this sort of  statement were to be permitted to go uncontradicted there would be a very good  chance of the young man giving up any idea of courting Catherine. Sooner than  this should occur, Sir Algernon sacrificed his dignity to his desire to keep  Halston in leading strings.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My daughter does not  love you, Mr. Oliphant,&rdquo; he said, with a faint attempt at dignity. &ldquo;At one time  I grant, there may have been something between you, but when she became engaged  to Mr. Carrant her feelings underwent a change.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Secure in his knowledge  of the projected elopement, Oliphant merely smiled at this useless denial.  Halston saw the look on his face and turned away with a muttered curse, while  Dillock, lying full length on the grass with his nose over the cliff,  apparently took no notice, but nevertheless did not lose a word of the  dialogue.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This place is hardly  fitted to discuss such matters,&rdquo; continued Sir Algernon, angry at the contempt  expressed by Oliphant&rsquo;s smile. &ldquo;Pray, leave me, sir, and do not molest my  daughter further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will you permit me to  call at your house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir! Certainly  not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then will you allow me  to see Miss Granville?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I do not wish my  daughter to have anything to do with you, Mr. Oliphant. She is grieving deeply  for the death of her promised husband, and it is hardly the time for you to  disturb her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well, Sir  Algernon. I have given you one warning, and the consequence of your ill-advised  course must be on your own head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you threaten me,  sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I simply tell you that  it is my intention to marry Miss Granville, with or without your consent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You will not dare to do  so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I dare anything when  you treat her and me so cruelly,&rdquo; retorted Oliphant, coolly. &ldquo;I regret having  to speak to you in public, in the presence of these gentlemen, but the attitude  you have taken up forces me to do so. Good day, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He took off his hat and  walked away, leaving Sir Algernon white with suppressed fury. For a moment it  looked as though he would burst out into a torrent of words, but a sense of  shame restrained him from thus lowering his dignity before strangers. Halston  was looking gloomily at the ground, and Dillock, now in a sitting position, was  raking the coarse grass with his hand, more out of idleness than anything else.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am sorry we have been  interrupted by that ill-bred young man,&rdquo; said Sir Algernon, stiffly, &ldquo;but now  that he has departed let us resume our examination of this&mdash;What is the matter,  sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This last question was  caused by a sudden ejaculation uttered by Dillock. He was looking at an object  which he had just picked up out of the long grass.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a locket,&rdquo; said  Halston, bending down to look at it, &ldquo;a locket on which is enamelled a monogram  H.C.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;H.C.&rdquo; repeated  Granville, aghast. &ldquo;Hugh! Catherine! Why that locket must belong to my daughter  or to Mr. Oliphant&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It must be Oliphant,&rdquo;  said Halston, with a triumphant look in his eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He evidently dropped it  here when he met my cousin and pushed him over the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait a moment,  gentlemen,&rdquo; remarked Dillock, now on his feet, &ldquo;do not let us jump at  conclusions. H and C may mean other names than Hugh and Catherine. It may not  belong to Mr. Oliphant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It certainly does not  belong to my daughter,&rdquo; said Sir Algernon, taking the locket from Dillock, &ldquo;at  least, I never saw it in her possession. Ah!&rdquo; he added, sharply, as he touched  a spring and the locket opened, &ldquo;two portraits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Miss Granville and  Oliphant,&rdquo; said Halston, who was looking over his shoulder.</p>
  <p align="left">There was a dead silence  for a moment and the three men looked at one another. That this locket should  be found on the very spot where the presumed struggle had taken place seemed to  prove conclusively that Oliphant was guilty. That was if the locket were the  property of Oliphant of which they were not certain.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ask Oliphant if it  belongs to him,&rdquo; said Halston, speaking for the three. Dillock acquiesced, and  without saying a word, Sir Algernon walked over to the young man who had taken  a seat not far away.</p>
  <p align="left">He seemed surprised when  the baronet approached, and arose to his feet. A few words passed between them,  and Oliphant making a gesture of surprise, walked swiftly across the grass to  where Dillock stood still holding the locket open in his hand.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You have found a  locket,&rdquo; said Oliphant, stopping short before the detective, &ldquo;it belongs to  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is this your property?&rdquo;  exclaimed Dillock, unable to conceal his surprise at the frankness of the  admission made by the young man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes! It is mine,&rdquo; said  Hugh, taking the locket. &ldquo;See here are the letters of Miss Granville&rsquo;s and my  names intertwined. H for Hugh, C for Catherine. Miss Granville gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you dare&mdash;&rdquo; began Sir  Algernon, when Dillock cut him short. There was a more important question to be  discussed than the baronet&rsquo;s offended dignity.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How did this locket  come here, Mr. Oliphant?&rdquo; he asked, seriously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I cannot  tell,&rdquo; replied Hugh, frankly, then, catching sight of the expression on  Halston&rsquo;s face, he turned pale.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dillock,  answering his unspoken question. &ldquo;It was here that Mr. Carrant fell or was  pushed over the cliff. This locket which you acknowledge to be your property is  found here. What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say  that you think I killed Carrant,&rdquo; burst out Hugh, indignantly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It looks like it,&rdquo;  sneered Halston.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Silence, sir,&rdquo; cried  Hugh, turning sharply on him. &ldquo;I ask this gentleman, not you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This gentleman,&rdquo; said  Sir Algernon, in a measured tone, &ldquo;is a detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A detective?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;From Scotland Yard,&rdquo;  finished Dillock, looking keenly at the young man. &ldquo;Now, sir, explain how this  locket came here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I cannot tell you,&rdquo;  said Hugh, in a faint voice. A sense of horror was slowly stealing over him as  he saw in what a perilous position he had placed himself by his frank  admission. &ldquo;You knew Mr. Carrant was engaged to marry Miss Granville?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you love Miss  Granville yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Naturally you looked  upon Mr. Carrant as a rival and disliked him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hated him,&rdquo; said  Oliphant, with a dark look. &ldquo;I hated him for insulting Catherine with his love.  But why do you accuse me of murdering him. I understood he had fallen over the  cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So the jury said, so  the world thought,&rdquo; replied Dillock, still constituting himself spokesman, &ldquo;but  a pocketbook containing papers and money is missing from his possession.  Consequently it is more than probable that he was robbed and thrown over the  cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But not by me&mdash;not by  me? Why should I rob the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You might have done so  as a blind,&rdquo; said Halston, pointedly, &ldquo;you admit that you hated Carrant, and  now we find your locket here&mdash;the locket given to you by Miss Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can you explain this,  Mr. Oliphant?&rdquo; asked Dillock, in a stern tone.</p>
  <p align="left">Oliphant passed his hand  across his brow. The abyss which had suddenly opened at his feet appalled him.  He knew that Sir Algernon and Halston hated him, though he was unable to  conceive the reason for the latter&rsquo;s ill-concealed dislike. They would do all  in their power to harm him, and a thousand trivial occurrences flashed across  his brain, which might serve to weave the rope to hang him. He tottered with a  momentary faintness and then drew himself up proudly to face his accusers.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can explain what I  did with the locket,&rdquo; he said, addressing himself to Dillock, &ldquo;but I cannot  tell how it came here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; sneered  Halston, &ldquo;I thought you would make that excuse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At least, sir, permit  me to defend myself,&rdquo; said Oliphant, with great dignity. &ldquo;My explanation can be  substantiated by Miss Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By my daughter!&rdquo; cried  Sir Algernon, furiously. &ldquo;What has she to do with the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your daughter and I,  Sir Algernon, arranged to elope together in order that she should not be forced  into this marriage with Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said the baronet,  furiously, but calmed down as Dillock clutched him by the arm.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go on, sir,&rdquo; he added,  sarcastically, &ldquo;let us hear your defence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We were going to elope  on the fifteenth,&rdquo; said Hugh, quietly. &ldquo;All had been arranged save the time she  was to meet me. I could not send a letter for fear it should fall into your  hands so I scratched the time on the back of that locket and sent it to  Catherine by special messenger. Even had it fallen into your hands it would  have told you nothing, therefore I adopted it as a means of communication in  lieu of letter writing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;On the back of the  locket are scratched three figures,&rdquo; said Dillock, can you tell what they are?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. The figures are  2-30, which means that she was to meet me for the half past two train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is correct,&rdquo;  replied Dillock, nodding his head.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So you sent this locket  to Miss Granville?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I did. The  messenger I sent is at my hotel. He can prove my words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then how did the locket  come here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least  idea,&rdquo; said Hugh, quietly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps Miss Granville  can tell,&rdquo; suggested Dillock, wishing to aid the young man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. She certainly can  say if she received the locket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said  Dillock, turning to Sir Algernon, &ldquo;let us go to your house and see Miss  Granville. We will also send for the hotel messenger. The truth must be  discovered.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
          <i>Denial</i></b></h2>
  <p align="left">It must be confessed  that Sir Algernon behaved very well at this juncture of affairs. Oliphant was  no favourite of his, and on many occasions the baronet had insulted the young  man grossly. Yet, much as he disliked him, he could not bring himself to  believe that Oliphant was guilty of so base a crime. In spite of his pomposity  and selfishness, there was a touch of good-breeding about Granville, and it  came out strongly now that he discovered his enemy to be in danger of his life.  As they left the cliffs, he spoke in a low voice to Hugh.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Oliphant,&rdquo; he said,  seriously, &ldquo;believe me, I am deeply sorry that this accusation should be  brought against you. I am not prepossessed in your favour as you know,  nevertheless, I do not believe you to be guilty of the crime laid to your  charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am obliged for your  good opinion, Sir Algernon,&rdquo; replied Hugh, astonished at this unexpected  leniency of the baronet, &ldquo;despite the fact that circumstances are against me, I  hope to prove my innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I shall do all in my  power to help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In that case pray send  to my hotel for the waiter who took the packet to Catherine on the fourteenth.  His name is Whitson. Mr. Dillock,&rdquo; he added, raising his voice, &ldquo;have I your  permission to send for the man by whom I forwarded the packet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By all means, Mr.  Oliphant. Call all witnesses likely to prove your innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Evidently the detective  was well disposed towards Oliphant, and the young man felt grateful to him for  his consideration. He hoped to clear himself of this charge if only to  disappoint Halston, who was ill-disposed towards him. Why his attitude should  be thus he could not conceive, as he had only met him once before, and had  never to his knowledge done him any harm. Yet Halston disliked him and rejoiced  that he was in danger of being arrested for the crime of murder. Either he was  devoted to his cousin&rsquo;s memory and wished to avenge his death, or he harboured  some secret grudge against Oliphant. That Halston was an admirer of  Catherine&rsquo;s, Hugh was of course ignorant.</p>
  <p align="left">On their arrival at Sir  Algernon&rsquo;s house, the baronet at once despatched a messenger to the hotel for  Whitson. Then, when they were all seated in his study, he requested his  daughter to come down. Miss Granville, hearing from the servant that Hugh was  with her father, felt very anxious as she thought that their projected slight  had been discovered, and that there was likely to be trouble with her lover.  Hastily adding a few touches to her toilette she obeyed Sir Algernon&rsquo;s request  and walked into the study.</p>
  <p align="left">Catherine Granville was  a tall, handsome brunette, who carried herself in a very stately fashion.  Though only twenty years of age she looked much older as her demeanour was so  composed. Plainly dressed in black serge with white linen collar and cuffs, she  entered the room in a hesitating manner. Her face was quite colourless, but  flushed a rosy red when she beheld her lover. Without saying a word she walked  towards him, despite the frown with which her father greeted this open  exhibition of her preference. Indeed she would have kissed him boldly before  them all but that a significant pressure of Hugh&rsquo;s warned her that it beloved  them to be on their guard.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My dear Miss  Granville,&rdquo; said Oliphant, gravely, &ldquo;your father has kindly permitted me to see  you in the presence of these gentlemen in order that you may assist me to  exculpate myself from a crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A crime,&rdquo; repeated  Catherine, in a bewildered fashion. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am accused of having  murdered Rudolph Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Catherine looked at him  in a startled manner and appeared as though about to faint. Controlling herself  with a powerful effort she burst into an angry laugh.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is this a jest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is no jest, Miss  Granville,&rdquo; said Dillock, smoothly. &ldquo;Mr Oliphant is in danger of being  arrested.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who are you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My name is Dillock. I  am a detective from Scotland Yard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are a detective?&rdquo;  repeated Catherine, turning pale with emotion, &ldquo;and you have come here to  arrest Mr. Oliphant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Unless he can clear  himself of the charge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who has dared to bring  it against him? You, father? No! Not you! Even you would shrink from that,&rdquo; she  said, in so scornful a tone that Granville winced. After a pause she spoke  again.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Halston, are you  Hugh&rsquo;s accuser?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. Why should I accuse  Mr. Oliphant of so terrible a crime. I bear no ill-will towards him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No one accuses me, Catherine,&rdquo;  said Hugh, quietly, &ldquo;but on the spot where Carrant was murdered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Murdered! This is news  to me. I understood his death was the result of an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; interposed  Dillock, shaking his head, &ldquo;he was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And by whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That is what I wish to  find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Catherine looked at him  with a startled gaze, clasping her hands nervously together. Their eyes met and  they stared steadily at one another for nearly a moment. She was the first to  give way, and, dropping her eyes, addressed herself hastily to Hugh.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You say Mr. Carrant was  murdered and that you are accused of the crime. Yet you add that no one accuses  you. What is the meaning of it all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You know this locket?&rdquo;  said Hugh, taking it from Dillock.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. It is the locket I  gave you last year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well! It was found on  the spot where the struggle took place between Carrant and his assassin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How did it get there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wish to discover how  it got there,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;On the fourteenth of this month I sent it to  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Sent it to me,&rdquo; she repeated,  steadily. &ldquo;Surely you are making some mistake. I never received it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Quite sure. Had it been  sent you may be certain I should have received it. Unless,&rdquo; she added, turning  round so as to face her father, &ldquo;unless you stopped it coming to me, papa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I did not,&rdquo; replied  Sir Algernon, decisively. &ldquo;I never saw the locket before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I certainly never  received it,&rdquo; said Catherine, passing her hand across her brow, &ldquo;had I done so  it would not have been discovered on the cliff. You were not on the cliff that  night, were you?&rdquo; she suddenly asked her lover.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Hugh,  while Dillock pricked up his ears. &ldquo;I did not leave my hotel after nine  o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What time did you say  Mr. Carrant left this house, Sir Algernon?&rdquo; asked Dillock.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A little after ten. I  noted the time as the quarter struck just as he went out of the gate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you, Mr. Oliphant,  did not leave your hotel after nine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. Whitson can prove  that I stayed in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you could not have  seen Mr. Carrant on that night,&rdquo; declared Catherine.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I certainly did not. I  saw him last at noon on the fourteenth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If this is so,&rdquo;  murmured Dillock, in a puzzled tone, &ldquo;how did the locket come to be lost on the  cliff. Can you give us any idea, Mr. Halston?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I!&rdquo; said Halston, in  astonishment, &ldquo;certainly not. I was not in Seagate on the fourteenth. I was in  Paris on that date and only returned in time to attend the funeral of my poor  cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The whole affair was  wrapt in mystery. If Hugh could prove an alibi, he certainly could not have  lost the locket himself on the cliff. Yet someone must have taken it there  perhaps to implicate him in the crime. But who would do such a dastardly act?  Dillock was fairly puzzled, and sat nursing his chin in deep perplexity.</p>
  <p align="left">During the silence which  ensued after the last remark of Halston, the door opened and Whitson entered.  He had come at once to the house in response to Hugh&rsquo;s message and stood  waiting cap in hand to be addressed.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whitson,&rdquo; said Hugh,  quietly, &ldquo;I wish you to answer this gentleman a few questions relative to my  movements on the fourteenth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will you not examine  him yourself, Oliphant,&rdquo; said Sir Algernon, anxious that Hugh should have every  opportunity of proving his innocence.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I prefer that Mr.  Dillock should do so. It will be more satisfactory to us both.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I will answer any  questions you may ask, sir,&rdquo; said Whitson, respectfully, addressing Dillock, of  whose profession he was quite ignorant.</p>
  <p align="left">The ensuing conversation  was entirely between the two men.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you know this  locket?&rdquo; asked Dillock, holding it out.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir. It is the  property of Mr. Oliphant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When did you see it  last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;On the fourteenth of  this month. Mr. Oliphant called me up to his room and told me he wished me to  deliver a packet at this house&mdash;a packet addressed to Miss Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I saw him wrap that  locket up in a piece of paper, address it to Miss Granville, and then he handed  it to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are quite sure he  then delivered this locket into your hand for transmission to Miss Granville?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; I was  looking at his actions the whole time.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, and when he gave  you the packet what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I came along to this  house and according to my instructions tried to see Miss Granville, but she  would not grant me an interview.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I was lying down with a  bad headache,&rdquo; interposed Catherine, promptly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, miss, so the  servant told me,&rdquo; replied Whitson, respectfully. &ldquo;Well, sir, as I could not see  the lady, I gave the packet to the butler and told him to deliver it to her at  once. Then I returned to the hotel and reported what I had done to Mr.  Oliphant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About what time was  this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Between eight and nine  o&rsquo;clock on the evening of the fourteenth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was Mr. Oliphant out  when you returned?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir. He was waiting  for me on the verandah of the hotel. Then he went into the billiard room and  played there till twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was in the whole  time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir. I was  marking, and he played with Mr. Scotson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Scotson has gone back  to town,&rdquo; said Hugh, at this moment, &ldquo;but he can prove that I was playing with  him that evening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This evidence is  sufficient,&rdquo; replied Dillock, with a grim smile. &ldquo;Well, Whitson. What did Mr.  Oliphant do when he stopped playing at twelve o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He went to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This evidence of Whitson  proved conclusively that Hugh could have nothing to do with the crime. As he  was not out of his hotel after nine o&rsquo;clock he could not have been with Carrant  on the cliffs at the time of the murder. Dillock was satisfied that Hugh was  innocent, yet anxious to know how the locket had been found on the cliff, asked  Sir Algernon to call his butler.</p>
  <p align="left">The man entered, looking  rather pale. A rumour had spread through the house that Dillock was a detective  and the butler felt nervous at being summoned so unexpectedly, the more so as  he was quite unaware of what he was required for. No one as yet knew that  Carrant had been murdered, and it was with considerable astonishment that the  butler presented himself before the keen-eyed detective.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Markham,&rdquo; said Sir  Algernon, addressing him kindly, &ldquo;this gentleman wishes to ask you a few  questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, Sir Algernon,&rdquo;  replied Markham, bowing.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This is the man to whom  you delivered the packet,&rdquo; said Dillock, turning to Whitson.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir. I gave in  into the hands of Mr. Markham.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What packet?&rdquo; asked  Markham, apprehensively.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The packet I delivered  to you on the 14th to be given to Miss Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you deliver it as  directed?&rdquo; asked Dillock, sharply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir, I did not. I  placed it on the hall table, as just when I closed the door on Whitson the bell  rang in the drawing-room. I came in to attend to Sir Algernon, and when I went  back&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo; said  Dillock, seeing the man hesitate.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The packet was gone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; echoed everyone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. I asked the  servants if they had touched it but they said they had not, so as I was afraid  of getting into trouble, I said nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your neglect to do so  has placed me in a very dangerous position,&rdquo; said Hugh, sternly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hope not, sir,&rdquo; said  Markham, turning pale. &ldquo;I swear it was as I say. I left the packet on the hall  table and when I returned in ten minutes it was gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you suspect anyone  of having taken it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said  Markham, with some embarrassment, &ldquo;I did think Mr. Carrant might have done so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Carrant!&rdquo; said Dillock,  with lively interest. &ldquo;Was he in the hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was going down  there, sir, as I entered the drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, yes, I remember  that,&rdquo; interposed Sir Algernon. &ldquo;We were going to smoke and Carrant spoke of  some fine cigars he had left in the pocket of his overcoat. He went down for  the case when Markham answered the bell and returned with them to the smoking  room in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did he say anything  about the packet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. Not a word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet he must have seen  it there lying on the hall table,&rdquo; said Dillock, in a perplexed tone.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course he did,&rdquo;  observed Catherine, with feminine intuition. &ldquo;It was he who took it. He knew I  loved Hugh, and that papa had forbidden me to receive any letters or messages  from him. Doubtless he recognised the writing on the packet and, thinking it  was a message from Hugh to me, slipped it into his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In that case he would  have spoken to Sir Algernon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps he intended to  do so,&rdquo; said that gentleman, &ldquo;and forgot all about it. We began playing cards  directly he returned to the smoking room and I have no doubt he quite forgot  the packet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why did you not ask Mr.  Carrant if he had picked up the packet, Markham?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I intended to do so,  sir, but next morning the poor gentleman was dead, so as it could do no good I  held my tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think it is as you  say, Miss Granville,&rdquo; remarked Dillock, turning to Catherine. &ldquo;Mr. Carrant  recognised the writing and slipped the packet into his pocket intending to  mention it to Sir Algernon. By the way, Mr. Oliphant, did he know your writing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am sure he did, I  wrote him frequent letters telling him Miss Granville was engaged to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then that is what took  place, without a doubt,&rdquo; said Dillock, decisively. &ldquo;Actuated by jealousy he  took the packet, forgot to speak about it to Sir Algernon, and when outside,  suddenly recollected it. He might have opened the packet on the cliff when he  was attacked and thus in the scuffle it fell on the grass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This certainly seemed to  be the most feasible explanation and was readily accepted by all present. Sir  Algernon shook hands with Hugh, almost the first time he had ever done so in  his life,</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I congratulate you on  having proved your innocence,&rdquo; he said, in a hearty voice while Halston scowled  at the favour thus shewn to his rival.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank you very much,  sir,&rdquo; replied Hugh, returning his grasp warmly. &ldquo;I am glad to have your good  opinion. It is fortunate for me that I was able to show I had nothing to do  with the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Catherine said nothing,  but leading Hugh towards the door kissed him fervently, and left the room. Sir  Algernon frowned as she did this and glanced at Halston. The young man was pale  with fury. Dillock was thinking.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We have proved your  innocence, Mr. Oliphant,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;but have not yet found the  criminal. This is a more difficult case than I imagined it to be.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
          <i>What the Coastguard Said</i></b></h2>
  <p align="left">After that episode of  the locket Dillock felt somewhat perplexed. He could not see clearly ahead and  was in doubt as to what would be the best course to pursue for the capture of  this unknown criminal. Hugh had been proved innocent beyond all doubt therefore  the suspicions of Halston were all wrong. No one so far as Dillock could learn  had a grudge against the dead man, yet as his life had been evil there were  grounds for thinking some of his profligate companions might have something to  do with the crime.</p>
  <p align="left">After considering the  questions, Dillock was half inclined to return to London and make himself  acquainted with the past life of Carrant. There he might find the motive of the  crime. Perhaps some of his scampish companions bore a secret hatred against the  deceased, and had come down to Seagate to pay off the score by killing him. Yet  after further thought Dillock abandoned this idea. He had his own suspicions as  to who was guilty, but kept them strictly to himself, lest they might prove to  be unfounded, and he would be blamed for being too hasty.</p>
  <p align="left">His principal reliance  lay in the banknote which had been stolen. On learning from Sir Algernon that  it had been obtained direct from the Liberty Bank, he sent a message to a  brother detective, directing him to find out the number. This man, Jackson by  name, had obtained this information, and, having transmitted it to Dillock, was  now watching the bank to see when the note would be returned. Information had  also been sent to the other banks, both London and Provincial, so Dillock,  knowing the note would sooner or later pass into someone&rsquo;s account, had great  hopes of securing the criminal thereby. Jackson was a smart detective and  Dillock knew he would do all in his power to help him, so easy on that score,  he remained at Seagate to see if any further facts would turn up in connection  with the crime.</p>
  <p align="left">After the finding of the  locket, he made a thorough search both at the top and bottom of the cliff, with  the idea that he might find some more evidence, but, notwithstanding the most  minute examination, he was gratified with no further discoveries. His principal  employment&mdash;if it could be called so, was sitting in the glass shelter at the  end of the parade watching the spot from which the unhappy man had fallen.</p>
  <p align="left">Sometimes he paid a  visit to Hugh with whom he had become very friendly. Oliphant spoke quite  openly to the detective regarding his love for Catherine, as he was grateful to  Dillock for having treated him so kindly while under suspicion. Sir Algernon  was much more civil to the young man than formerly but still forbade him to  visit the house or think of marrying Catherine. The admiration of Halston had  become so unmistakable that the baronet cherished hopes that he would propose,  and, knowing these hopes, Hugh became apprehensive lest Sir Algernon should  force his daughter into the match against her will. These fears he confided to  Dillock who consoled him to the best of his ability.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be afraid,  Mr. Oliphant,&rdquo; said the detective, sturdily, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll never marry that fellow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But if forced to do so  by Sir Algernon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then run away with her  as you intended to do before Carrant&rsquo;s death. But I don&rsquo;t think you need have  any fear of Miss Granville. She may pretend to obey her father for the sake of  peace, but from her looks I shouldn&rsquo;t think she was the kind of young lady to  be forced into a marriage against her will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not in an ordinary  case,&rdquo; said Hugh, with a sigh, &ldquo;but she has some absurd ideas as to filial  duties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Considering the way in  which her father neglected her it is strange that it should be so. Yet, if she  has these ideas, why did she consent to thwart his plans regarding Carrant by  eloping with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because she detested  the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at it,&rdquo;  said Dillock, grimly, &ldquo;from all I have heard of him he does not seem to have  been a particularly engaging person. Nor do I think Mr. Halston is much  better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Both of them come of a  bad stock. Yet Halston is certainly behaving well in pushing this inquiry about  his cousin&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t have done  so but that Sir Algernon insisted. So long as he got the money Halston was  quite content that his cousin&rsquo;s death should be ascribed to&mdash;accident. All he  furthers this inquiry for is to gratify Sir Algernon so that he may marry his  daughter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That he shall never  do,&rdquo; said Oliphant, emphatically. &ldquo;She will elope with me before that takes  place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Unfortunately you told  Sir Algernon that you contemplated that in the case of Carrant, therefore he&rsquo;ll  guard his daughter closer than ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo;  responded Oliphant, with a smile. &ldquo;I am quite content to wait, for Catherine  will never marry anyone but me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wish you joy of your  wooing, Mr. Oliphant. I hope you&rsquo;ll be luckier in love than in this detective  business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you propose to  do next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least  idea. I have been trying to find out if anyone saw Rudolph Carrant after he  left Granville&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did anyone see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. It was after ten and  the respectable Seagate people had all retired into their houses. No one seems  to have been out all night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Except the  coastguards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a bad idea,&rdquo;  said Dillock, approvingly. &ldquo;A coastguard would likely be walking along the  cliffs by that path. The question is would he be near where the murder took  place at that special time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s improbable. Still  you might enquire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do so at once,&rdquo;  said Dillock, jumping up with great glee. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if a  coastguard had seen something. Chance has more to do with human life than  people think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Taking a hasty leave of  Hugh, the detective went off in search of his evidence. Frequently he had seen  coastguards passing as he sat in the shelter but hitherto, strange to say, had  not thought of asking them any question. Now, in accordance with the suggestion  of Oliphant, he took his seat in the old place and kept a sharp look-out along  the cliff. Meanwhile he considered what the chances were of his getting any  information in this way bearing on the crime.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;These men are  constantly on the alert,&rdquo; he said, aloud, &ldquo;and would be sharp to notice any  suspicious characters. If they did not see Carrant himself they might at least  have espied some tramp. After all I would not be surprised if this turned out to  be a mere vulgar robbery. Some tramp saw a gentleman standing on the edge of  the cliff, approached to rob him and in the struggle threw him over the cliff.  Then he would descend and take away the pocket-book. If that is what has been  done the note is bound to be changed sooner or later by the murderer. Then I&rsquo;ll  be able to lay my hands on him. It is either an ordinary crime of this sort or  else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Mr. Dillock stopped  short. He had another theory of which he was somewhat doubtful so did not care  to utter his thoughts even to the empty air. There was no one in sight, yet he  was on his guard and held his tongue. One never knew who might be lurking  around and Mr. Dillock was a very cautious man. Just as he finished his  soliloquy he saw a coastguard coming briskly along the path.</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock strolled towards  him and speedily found himself face to face with a breezy-looking individual  with a bright eye and ruddy countenance. He turned smartly as Dillock  approached and politely offered his marine glass for the detective to observe a  passing ship.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine boat,&rdquo; said  Dillock, gravely looking through the glass and returning it to its owner. &ldquo;By  the way, I&rsquo;m a stranger here. Is it not near this place that a gentleman fell  over the cliff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir, just over  yonder. He came out for a stroll and by some chance got past the bank and fell  over the cliff. There was an inquest held on the body and now he is buried.  Poor Mr. Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you know him?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As well as I know the  nose on my face, sir. Why I spoke to him before he fell over that cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock&rsquo;s eye twinkled  with delight. Not only was he in a fair way to obtain information concerning  the crime, but he had chanced on the very man who had seen Carrant on that  fatal night.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, indeed,&rdquo; he said,  with affected indifference, &ldquo;and when was that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About half-past ten,  sir,&rdquo; replied the coastguard. &ldquo;He often used to speak to me and my mates when  he was out for a breath of fresh air before going to bed. Many&rsquo;s the half-crown  he&rsquo;s given me. A kind, liberal-hearted gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This was evidently a  hint, and Dillock profited thereby. Slipping five shillings into the horny palm  of the mariner he waited for further information.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thankee, sir. Well,  sir. On that night at half-past ten, or it may be a little later, Mr. Carrant comes  up to me over yonder and he says&mdash;&lsquo;Have you seen a lady about here?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo;  says I. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no lady about here at this time of the night.&rsquo; And with that  he laughed and gave me half-a-crown. Then he went away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In what direction?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To the left. In the  opposite direction to the place where he fell over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was he sober?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Quite sober, sir, but  very jolly. I expect he had had a glass or two, but nothing to speak of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well. When he went away  what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I waited a bit to light  my pipe in the glass shelter yonder, and then followed him at a distance along  the path.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was he on the path?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For a time, sir. And  then he struck off towards one of those seats. A lady was sitting there, and as  soon as she saw him she came towards him. I saw them meet, and then they walked  back to the glass shelter, and I went on to attend to my duties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you any idea who  the lady was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not in the least, sir.  But she couldn&rsquo;t have been very respectable meeting a gentleman at that hour of  the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you see them again?</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I came back there a  few hours later and there was no one about. Yet, I daresay, sir, the poor  gentleman fell over the cliff in the meantime and broke his neck. I might have  seen him lying there had I looked over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why did you not tell  all this at the inquest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t called as a  witness, sir,&rdquo; said the coastguard, in an amazed tone. &ldquo;Besides he wasn&rsquo;t  murdered. He fell over by accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, yes, of course,&rdquo;  replied Dillock, hastily, not wishing to raise his informant&rsquo;s suspicions.  &ldquo;Quite right. A very interesting story. Good-day, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-day, sir,&rdquo; said  the coastguard. Then as Dillock walked away he added to himself. &ldquo;Now, I wonder  if there&rsquo;s anything wrong about that chap. He&rsquo;s been pumping me, and I&rsquo;ve told  him all I know&mdash;for five shillings. If I&rsquo;d known he wanted to pump me I&rsquo;d have  asked ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The information thus  procured cost Dillock many an anxious thought. Could it be that a woman&rsquo;s hand  had thrust Carrant from the cliff. If so, who was the woman who had perilled  her reputation by meeting this man of bad character at so late an hour and had  crowned her folly by committing a crime. It might be that the papers referred  to by Halston contained matters inimical to the fair fame of some woman, and  she had adopted this desperate means of saving her reputation.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If anyone knows about  Carrant&rsquo;s past life it will be Halston,&rdquo; muttered Dillock, as he hurried  towards that gentleman&rsquo;s hotel. &ldquo;He may know of some woman who hated Carrant  and wished to rid herself of him. Yet it is inconceivable that a man engaged to  Catherine Granville would be so mad as to meet another woman here. He might  have guessed it would get to her ears and then she would have nothing more to  say to him. Even her father would have broken off the match had he heard of so  insulting a meeting. Who can the woman be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">On arriving at the hotel  he sent up his card to Halston and was at once conducted to the sitting-room of  that gentleman. He found him lying on the sofa reading a French novel, but he  sprang up when Dillock entered and advanced eagerly towards him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you discovered  anything further?&rdquo; he asked, anxiously, signing to Dillock to seat himself.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. I have discovered  who was the companion of Carrant on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed. Who was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A woman. But I don&rsquo;t  know her name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; repeated  Halston, much bewildered. &ldquo;Do you mean to say that a woman committed this  crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, that I cannot tell  you, but it was a woman who met him near that place after he left Granville&rsquo;s  house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Tell me all about it,&rdquo;  said Halston, eagerly, and seated himself close by Dillock so as not to lose a  word of the discourse.</p>
  <p align="left">Thus adjured, Dillock  narrated the story told to him by the coastguard and made frequent comments  thereon. Halston listened in silence, and when the tale was ended sat staring  at Dillock with much admiration.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What a wonderful man  you are,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;it was a good idea to question the coastguard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nevertheless it was not  my idea but Oliphant&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oliphant!&rdquo; repeated  Halston, with a frown. &ldquo;Oh, he suggested it, did he. Well, and what does he say  to the information thus gained through his means?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have not told him  yet,&rdquo; retorted Dillock, resenting the sneer. &ldquo;I came first to you. What do you  think of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What can I think of it  save that my cousin was a scoundrel to be engaged to Catherine Granville and  then to meet another woman in that underhand fashion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you any idea who  the woman can be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not in the least. I  know that Rudolph was a profligate and was mixed up with queer people. But when  he became engaged he promised to reform. It appears by your story that he was  as bad as ever under the rose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Might not some woman he  knew in London have followed him down here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not improbable  though I confess I do not see what reason any woman could have for doing so.  Carrant was not a lovable man.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She might have come  down to get those papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What papers?&rdquo; asked  Halston, staring at the detective.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The papers in the  shagreen pocketbook which you said might have been the motive of the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I remember; I did  make that suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Have you any idea what  those papers contained?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not the slightest. Why  do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because they might have  been letters jeopardizing the fair fame of a woman and she came down here to  ask Carrant for them. Finding she could not get them by fair means she tried  foul, so pushed him over the cliff and robbed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all  surprised if that were the case,&rdquo; said Halston, coolly, &ldquo;but how can you find  this woman? Carrant loved so many that it will be like looking for a needle in  a bundle of hay to seek this one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will you not help me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Certainly, if I can,  but I don&rsquo;t see how I am to do so. I don&rsquo;t know many of the ladies with whom  Carrant was in love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You know some?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Dillock,  coolly, &ldquo;then tell me if there is any special one whom you suspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that right  off,&rdquo; replied Halston, with some hesitation, &ldquo;but if you come and see me  to-night I&rsquo;ll do my best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About nine o&rsquo;clock. I  dine with the Granvilles but will come back to keep my appointment with you. Do  you think this woman pushed Rudolph over the cliff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say for  certain,&rdquo; said the detective, in a vexed tone. &ldquo;I had quite another theory as  to the murder, but this discovery has knocked it on the head. This is a queerer  case than either you or I imagine, Mr. Halston.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
          <i>What the Pocket-Book Contained</i></b></h2>
  <p align="left">A week after that  interview Dillock was still at Seagate. He learned nothing new from Halston  regarding Carrant&rsquo;s past life. To all appearance, the dead man had been a  scoundrel and a profligate of the worst kind. His name mentioned with that of a  woman however blameless she might be, was sufficient to sully her fair fame.  When Halston revealed all he knew of Carrant&rsquo;s past to Dillock, the detective  wondered that Sir Algernon could think of giving his daughter to so iniquitous  a villain.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And he must have known  Carrant&rsquo;s record,&rdquo; thought Dillock. &ldquo;There are always plenty of scoundrels in  the world to blight the fair fame of either man or woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">All this talk and  conference led to nothing. Carrant had behaved badly to so many women that it  was impossible to pick out any special one who would have committed the crime.  Plenty of them had been wronged sufficiently to desire vengeance on the man who  had betrayed them, yet it was a matter of great difficulty to name any  particular woman who would have taken the law into her own hands. Dillock did  not attempt to do this. He judged it best to wait until chance or Jackson  placed the pocket-book in his hands. When he gained possession of that, when he  learned what those papers contained, then he might be able to run his prey to  earth.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yet, after all,&rdquo; he  said, disconsolately, there is but little chance of my getting that pocket-book.  If the woman to whom those papers were valuable committed the crime she must  have destroyed them. She would certainly do her best to reap the reward of her  terrible deed by destroying the evidence which she had sacrificed so much to  obtain. As to the ten-pound note, I daresay she threw that into the fire so as  to obliterate every trace likely to connect her with Rudolph Carrant&rsquo;s murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As a matter of fact  Dillock was beginning to weary of his sojourn at Seagate. Notwithstanding all  his efforts, he was quite unable to obtain fresh evidence, and had serious  thoughts of going to town and investigating Carrant&rsquo;s past life on the chance  of finding something likely to throw some light on the subject, when he  received a letter from his coadjutor Jackson which made him change his mind.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have traced the  note,&rdquo; ran the letter, &ldquo;and have captured the man who stole the pocket-book  from Carrant after his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock shook his head  over this sentence. If the coastguard&rsquo;s evidence were true it was a woman who  committed the crime. Yet Jackson hinted that a man was guilty of the murder,  and asserted that he had him safe under lock and key. Could it be the man, in  whose possession the note was found, had confessed his crime. If this were so  then Dillock felt he was quite at sea.</p>
  <p align="left">He read the letter  again. It went on to say that the writer would bring the man and the  pocket-book to Seagate, there to show both to Dillock. &ldquo;You will be surprised  to hear who actually killed Carrant,&rdquo; continued the letter, &ldquo;and I fancy rather  sorry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">This also puzzled  Dillock. He certainly did not see why he should be sorry that the murderer of  Carrant was captured. Jackson&rsquo;s letter irritated him by its very mystery. First  it suggested that the captured man had committed the crime, then finished by  stating that Dillock would be astonished when he heard who had killed Carrant.  After several vain efforts to solve the mystery the detective gave it up in  despair, and anxiously awaited the arrival of Jackson with the man about whom  there were so many doubts.</p>
  <p align="left">The day after he  received that letter, Jackson came down to Seagate escorting a  truculent-looking man in charge of a policeman in plain clothes. A  beetle-browed scoundrel of the tramp order who looked like a galley slave, and  who saluted Dillock with a ferocious scowl. As advised by letter the detective  had a carriage waiting for Jackson and his charge, and into this they bundled  the tramp and themselves. During the short drive to the hotel, Jackson was  anything but communicative.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you from the  beginning,&rdquo; he said, in answer to Dillock&rsquo;s questions, &ldquo;wait till we are in  your private rooms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But why did you bring  this man down here?&rdquo; said Dillock, &ldquo;it is most irregular. You should have wired  me to come up to town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I brought him down on  purpose. It is necessary that all the people interested in the death of Carrant  should be brought face to face with him. Now then Dillock, who are the people  who are interested in this crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Four,&rdquo; responded  Dillock, promptly. &ldquo;Sir Algernon, because he hoped his daughter would marry  Carrant. Miss Granville, because she wished to escape from such a wretch. Mr.  Oliphant, because he was Carrant&rsquo;s rival; and Mr. Halston, because he is the  dead man&rsquo;s cousin and wishes to avenge his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then you must ask all  those people to call at your hotel this afternoon at&mdash;say three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can ask three. Sir  Algernon, Miss Granville and Oliphant, but Mr. Halston went up to town  yesterday and is not expected back till to-morrow night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, we can do without  him,&rdquo; said Jackson, as he alighted. &ldquo;Come, my man, get down. You needn&rsquo;t look  so tired as you have another railway journey before you to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What, are you going  back again?&rdquo; asked Dillock.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By the seven-thirty  train. I have to lodge this scoundrel in gaol.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lodge me in gaol, will  you,&rdquo; raged the tramp, with a few curses. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you bring me down here to  tell the truth and promise to let me go if I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t promise that,  my friend,&rdquo; remonstrated Jackson, sharply. &ldquo;Here, Mitchell, you can watch him  here while Mr. Dillock and myself go into the next room. I&rsquo;ll ring when I want  you to bring him in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The policeman placed the  tramp in a chair and took up his position beside him much to his disgust. &ldquo;A  land of liberty,&rdquo; said the tramp, indignantly, &ldquo;and this is the way a gentleman  is dragged about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Jackson laughed and went  into the inner room with Dillock. When the door was closed, the latter, unable  to restrain his impatience any longer, burst out in rapid speech.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Upon my word, Jackson,  this is a nice way to treat me,&rdquo; he said, indignantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just on tenterhooks  to know the truth and you won&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell now,  Dillock,&rdquo; said the other, smiling. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve worked in a good many queer cases  together but this is the queerest of all. A nice job I had to trace that note.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How did you manage it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I sent word to all the  banks that a note bearing a certain number would be presented sooner or later.  In due time, I got notice that it was paid into a branch of the Hibernian Bank  at Whitechapel. I went down there and found the man who presented it was a Jew.  He swore that he got it from a tallyman, so I went to him. In his turn he  informed me that it had been given in payment of some clothes by the gentleman  outside. His name is Levine&mdash;so he says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But Levine didn&rsquo;t buy  ten pounds&rsquo; worth of clothes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. He bought the  clothes he has on and took the change of the ten pound note. He also left the  suit and hat he was wearing in the tally shop. Then he went to knock down the  change of the note. I found him drunk in a low shanty in Whitechapel, and when  he was sober got the truth out of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; asked  Dillock, eagerly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A good many things that  were not true, but when I told him he might swing for the murder of Carrant, he  came out with what I truly believe is the truth. At least, it is backed up by  evidence like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">To illustrate the  remark, Jackson placed on the table a straw hat, much tattered, and the  shagreen pocket-book which had been stolen. Dillock laid his hand on the latter  with an ejaculation of delight, and was about to open it when Jackson  restrained him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Wait a minute, mate,&rdquo;  he said, rapidly, &ldquo;that pocket-book comes on later in the tale. Listen to the  tramp&rsquo;s story first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Dillock,  laying down the pocket-book reluctantly. &ldquo;I am all attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Levine was at one time  a flash book-maker,&rdquo; began Jackson, &ldquo;though you would not think so now to look  at him. He did fairly well for a time but ultimately took to welshing, which  finished him off as regards the turf. Then he went from bad to worse till he  ended in tramping the country and begging. It is a pity, as the man is fairly  well educated and speaks decent English.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He looks a perfect  ruffian,&rdquo; declared Dillock, impatiently, &ldquo;just the kind of man who would commit  a murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Jackson smiled and  Dillock resented the smile. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say Levine committed this murder,&rdquo; he  said, resentfully, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;ll do one yet or I&rsquo;m no reader of a man&rsquo;s face. That  scamp&rsquo;s a born criminal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He got his hand very  well in as regards this robbery,&rdquo; said Jackson, drily, &ldquo;especially considering  he is an amateur.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, so it was he who  robbed Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. But he did not  murder him. According to his story, he was on a begging tour and struck Seagate  in May as likely to be full of soft-hearted people. It appears, however, that  he did very bad business and was reduced to sleeping out on the night of the  fourteenth of May. When all the people left the parade, which they did early,  he made himself comfortable in that glass shelter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; interrupted  Dillock. &ldquo;A coastguard lit his pipe there and yet did not see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps he got under  the seat when the coastguard was there,&rdquo; replied Jackson. &ldquo;At all events he  managed to escape detection as he was not anxious to be turned away from so comfortable  a shelter. While he was lying there and wishing he had a pipe and a screw of  tobacco&mdash;his own words, Dillock&mdash;he heard the sound of voices and, cautiously  looking through the glass, saw two figures approaching&mdash;a man and a woman. The  man was Rudolph Carrant&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And the woman?&rdquo;  questioned Dillock, breathlessly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that  later on,&rdquo; replied Jackson, provokingly. &ldquo;The contents of this pocket-book will  tell you her name. Well, to continue Levine&rsquo;s story. The couple came close to  him and he heard the woman imploring the man to give her some papers. What  these were of course he did not know, but she seemed very anxious about them.  At length she lost her temper and ran to the edge of the cliff with the evident  intention of throwing herself over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Dillock,  with raised eyebrows, &ldquo;I see now how Carrant was inveigled over the bank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Carrant followed the  woman,&rdquo; continued Jackson, taking no notice of this interruption, &ldquo;and managed  to get between her and the cliff. He was so near that the least touch would  have sent him over. I wonder he did not see his danger.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He had liquor aboard,&rdquo;  explained Dillock, &ldquo;and was in a foolhardy condition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Evidently, or he would  not have placed himself at such a disadvantage with an enraged woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did Levine see her  face?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. She wore a thick  veil. It was not quite dark you must remember&mdash;and he could see Carrant and the  woman comparatively plainly as they were so near to where he was hiding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, go on. Don&rsquo;t keep  me in suspense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;While they stood in  this position, Carrant being between the woman and the cliff, Levine saw him  produce a pocket-book and flourish it in the woman&rsquo;s face. She made a snatch  and seized it. In doing so, Carrant, forgetting he was so near the verge,  slipped back and with a cry fell over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then she did not  deliberately push him over?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. According to  Levine&rsquo;s account it happened in that way. More of an accident than a murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And what did the woman  do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She appeared to be  terrified and dropped the pocket-book. It fell over the cliff also and she  threw herself down to see where it had gone. Of course there was nothing but  darkness below. For some minutes she remained looking over the edge, and then,  rising to her feet walked swiftly away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Down to pick up the  pocket-book I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Precisely. The tide was  out so there was no difficulty in getting round the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How would she know the  spot where Carrant&rsquo;s body was lying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By means of an isolated  pillar which stands out from the cliff. Carrant fell between that and the cliff.  There was no difficulty about that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well. She went down to  find the body?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The pocket-book,  rather. Wished to gain the reward of her crime no doubt. I must say she was an  uncommonly plucky woman to dare so much. Levine followed her cautiously down to  the parade and across the rocks. He hid himself behind the pillar and watched  her as he best could in the gloom. She examined Carrant&rsquo;s body, and evidently  finding he was dead, hunted for the pocket-book. Notwithstanding all her  efforts she was unable to find it, and in despair, desisting from her efforts,  she cleared out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And all this time she  never saw Levine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. He was too clever  at hiding himself. When she left he emerged from behind the pillar and in his  turn examined the body. Carrant, he says, was quite dead, having broken his  neck in the fall. Having assured himself of this fact he looked for the  pocket-book. The woman could not find it because of the darkness, but Levine  had a scrap of candle in his pocket and some matches. Lighting this he searched  carefully and found the book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where was it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Caught in a cleft of  the cliff a little way over the body. That is why the woman could not find it.  She looked on the ground, but it never struck her to examine the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said Dillock,  grimly. &ldquo;I wonder she had the courage to do what she did. Her nerves must have  been pretty strong. Well, when Levine found the pocket-book why did he not go  up to town and give the alarm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Because he was afraid  of being accused of the murder,&rdquo; replied Jackson. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder he feared  that. A tramp in possession of a man&rsquo;s pocket-book, and the man lying dead at  the foot of a dangerous cliff, looks suspicious. Levine had not a clean past,  so if he had told his story it might not have been believed and he might have  been arrested for the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suppose it is only  natural that he should look after his own skin,&rdquo; said the other,  philosophically, &ldquo;but if he did not give the alarm he certainly took the  pocket-book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He did! Carrant was  dead and he could not help him. Had he been alive I think Levine would have  gone for assistance, for then Carrant could have told the truth about the  woman. As it was, Levine thought discretion the better part of valour, and made  off with the pocket-book. When he got to a safe place he examined it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did he find?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Some loose gold and  silver&mdash;a ten pound note and a few papers. Among them a letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. A letter written  by the woman who met Carrant on the cliffs. A letter making the appointment for  half-past ten on the fourteenth of May.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is the letter in here?&rdquo;  asked Dillock, laying his hand on the pocket-book.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. But wait a moment  before you look at it. I wish to finish Levine&rsquo;s story. He walked to Margate  during the night and with the loose silver procured a breakfast in the morning.  Then he took the first train to town, lived on the gold for some time, and  ultimately changed the ten pound note which led to his detection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did he hear of the  inquest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. He looked in the  papers for that. When he saw that the death was ascribed to accident, and  nothing was said about the pocket-book, he thought himself safe, and changed  the note. So this is his story. What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It sounds true,&rdquo; said  Dillock, picking up the pocket-book, &ldquo;especially as the contents of this  pocket-book bear him out. Where is the letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; replied  Jackson, taking it from the book and spreading it out before Dillock.</p>
  <p align="left">It was a letter written  to Carrant, requesting him to be at the end of the parade near the glass  shelter at half-past ten, as the writer wished to see him particularly. It was  signed Catherine Granville.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Catherine Granville,&rdquo;  repeated Dillock, in a startled voice. &ldquo;She to whom he was engaged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. She is the woman  who caused his death. It was Catherine Granville, and none other.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
          <i>The Straw Hat</i></b></h2>
  <p align="left">After that discovery  Dillock remained silent for a moment or so out of sheer astonishment. That the  woman who was with Carrant on that fatal night should turn out to be Catherine  Granville was almost incredible. There was certainly nothing in her speech or  demeanour likely to lead to such a belief, and yet he could not disbelieve the  evidence before him. Here was a letter written by her in which she invited  Carrant to meet her at the very spot where he had fallen over the cliff. The  evidence of the coastguard and the tramp proved conclusively that she had kept  the appointment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Dillock,  recovering from his bewilderment, &ldquo;I cannot believe it. She had no motive to  commit such a crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Jackson shrugged his  shoulders. He was quite convinced of Catherine&rsquo;s guilt and did not like his  word to be doubted.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She hated Carrant, and  was being forced into the marriage against her will,&rdquo; he said, pointedly. &ldquo;You  told me so in the last letter you wrote me. I think that a sufficiently strong  motive for her to desire his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted  Dillock, promptly, &ldquo;particularly when she did not intend to marry Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Her father insisted  upon the marriage taking place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;True enough. But Miss  Granville made up her mind to disobey her father and elope with Oliphant. If  so, why should she depart from this arrangement to commit a useless crime.  There is no sense in such a supposition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She may not have killed  him to get out of the marriage but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In any case she did not  kill him,&rdquo; interrupted Dillock sharply, &ldquo;according to the evidence of Levine,  it was an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, granted it was  so, and putting the marriage out of the question,&rdquo; said Jackson, impatiently,  &ldquo;you admit Miss Granville met Carrant on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It looks like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then she met him for  the purpose of obtaining certain papers. They were in that pocket-book and when  she snatched it from Carrant he fell over the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I admit all that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then her motive for  seeing Carrant that night must be contained in that pocket-book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock picked up the  shagreen case and balanced it lightly in his hand. He looked thoughtful.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why Miss  Granville should meet Carrant on the cliff when she could have seen him in her  father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Perhaps she did not  want her father to know of the meeting,&rdquo; suggested Jackson.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We are not certain of  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be  certain of anything, Dillock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The detective brought  down his fist on the table. A sudden idea had entered his brain.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it was  Miss Granville at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about that letter  in her own hand-writing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It may be a forgery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A forgery,&rdquo; repeated  Jackson, much astonished. &ldquo;Who would take the trouble to forge a letter like  that or who would be capable of doing so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but I&rsquo;ll  soon find out if it&rsquo;s genuine or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock thereupon rang  the bell, and when a waiter appeared, asked if Mr. Oliphant was in the hotel.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the  man. &ldquo;He is sitting on the verandah.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Give him my compliments, and ask him to  come up here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">When the man left the  room, Dillock turned to Jackson.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When Mr. Oliphant  comes,&rdquo; he said, coldly, &ldquo;I shall ask him if that letter is genuine. If it is,  we will seek Miss Granville and request an explanation of her movements on that  night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And if it is a  forgery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In that case I&rsquo;ll  follow up the theory I have had all along,&rdquo; said Dillock, opening the  pocket-book.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is your theory?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a lesson from  you, Jackson, and hold my tongue till I have everything all cut and dried. Then  I&rsquo;ll tell you, and it will be your turn to be astonished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Jackson showed plainly  that he did not like this reticence. The fact was these detectives were rivals  in an unacknowledged fashion. They worked together amicably enough, but one  always tried to out-do the other, and show that he was the smarter of the two.  This system of competition was good for business as both put their souls into  the work and consequently performed wonders with the cases given into their charge.  Dillock had been instructed to look after the Seagate case, and had deputed  Jackson to look after the town part of it. Hitherto he had been the luckier and  had discovered the most important facts. Naturally he showed his partner that  he considered himself head of the firm. This self-glorification Dillock  resented, and was prepared to do anything to get back his lost influence. He  had a theory, but the discovery of the sex of the supposed criminal upset that  theory. Nevertheless he was not going to acknowledge this to Jackson, so merely  hinted that he would explain his theory at the right time. Jackson resented  this but as he was being paid back in his own coin, sulkily acquiesced in  Dillock&rsquo;s determination.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; he  said, with an affectation of carelessness, &ldquo;but whatever theory you may have  formed you can&rsquo;t go against facts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What facts?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That it was Catherine  Granville who met Carrant in order to recover certain papers. The letter speaks  for itself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hear what Mr.  Oliphant has to say about the letter,&rdquo; said Dillock, drawing his chair up to  the table. &ldquo;Meanwhile let me examine the contents of the pocket-book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">It contained nothing but  some visiting cards, the letter of Catherine which Dillock asserted to be  forged and a cheque drawn on the bank of Hibernia by Carrant made payable to  Cecil Halston. So far, Dillock felt disappointed. The signature to this latter  was scratched out, and it was punched with three holes. This showed that it had  been duly honoured. If so, what was it doing in Carrant&rsquo;s pocket-book?</p>
  <p align="left">For a brief moment  Dillock considered this matter and then dismissed it as trivial. It had no  connection with the meeting of Catherine and Carrant, always presuming such  meeting had taken place&mdash;and he wanted to find out what possible reason she  could have for writing the letter.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing here to  show her motive,&rdquo; he said, closing the pocketbook with an angry snap, &ldquo;and yet  you say Levine heard her asking Carrant for certain papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She did, and moreover  snatched the pocket-bock from Carrant which indirectly led to the catastrophe.  His flourishing it and her snatching it showed that the papers referred to were  in that pocketbook.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;They are certainly not  here now,&rdquo; said Dillock, in a vexed tone. &ldquo;Do you think Levine stole them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. He used the money  because it was of use to him. The papers, whatever they were, would have been  of no value.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Call him in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Jackson opened the door  and nodded to Mitchell, who thereupon marched the tramp into the room. The  latter looked sulky and gave expression to his bad temper.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How much longer is this  sort of thing going on,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you all I know so why not let  me go. There&rsquo;s the pocket-book&mdash;there&rsquo;s the hat. What more do you want. The  money? Well it&rsquo;s all spent and I haven&rsquo;t got a penny. You can&rsquo;t get blood out  of a stone, so let me go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, the hat,&rdquo; exclaimed  Dillock, taking no notice of the latter part of this speech. &ldquo;I forgot all  about the hat. Is it yours?&rdquo; he added, sharply, turning to Levine.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. I gave it to the tally-man  with my old clothes. He,&rdquo; pointing to Jackson, &ldquo;got it from him and brought it  down here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I should rather think I  did,&rdquo; said Jackson, triumphantly, &ldquo;seeing it is Miss Granville&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you mean to say that  is Miss Granville&rsquo;s hat,&rdquo; asked Dillock, in astonishment.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know her name,&rdquo;  retorted Levine, but it&rsquo;s the hat that the young woman who was on the cliff  lost. I hadn&rsquo;t one of my own so it being a straw and suiting either a man or a  woman I wore it until I sold it to the tally-man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock picked up the  hat with a frown. It seemed to confirm the guilt of Catherine Granville, and he  winced under the triumphant glance darted at him by Jackson.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Black straw,&rdquo; said  Dillock, &ldquo;black straw with a blue ribbon with white spots. A kind of sailor hat  such as ladies wear at the sea-side. How do you know it is Miss Granville&rsquo;s,&rdquo;  he asked Jackson, sharply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why. The wind blew it  off her head while she was searching for the pocket-book and Levine picked it  up. You can&rsquo;t have better proof than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am satisfied that  this hat belonged to the woman who met Carrant,&rdquo; retorted Dillock, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not  satisfied that she was Miss Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then ask her yourself,&rdquo;  said Jackson, much nettled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I intend to; and if she  denies that it is hers I&rsquo;ll go to the shop where it was bought. See!&rdquo; said  Dillock, pointing to the inside of the hat, &ldquo;it was purchased from Abraham  &amp; Co&rsquo;s., Outfitters, of Oxford Street. And it&rsquo;s a new hat,&rdquo; he added,  nodding his head with a satisfied air.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got to do  with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never you mind,  Jackson, I&rsquo;ll tell you when the shop-keeper informs me of the name of the  person who bought it. And that name,&rdquo; continued Dillock, impressively, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t  be Catherine Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When are you going to  let me go?&rdquo; broke in Levine, impatiently.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When your evidence is  no longer necessary,&rdquo; retorted Dillock, silencing Jackson by a gesture. &ldquo;Look  here Levine, or whatever your name is. What about this pocket-book?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I picked it up at the  foot of the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What did it then  contain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A letter, some visiting  cards, a cheque for two hundred pounds with the name scratched out and a ten  pound note and three sovereigns in gold and eighteen shillings in silver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. I spent the money  but the rest of the things are there as you see them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Were there no other  papers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m blest if there  were,&rdquo; said Levine, staring blankly at his questioner. &ldquo;I swear that there was  nothing more but what you see there, barring the money which I spent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it  at all,&rdquo; muttered Dillock, in a perplexed tone. &ldquo;There is nothing here to  connect Catherine Granville with the crime&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a crime,&rdquo;  interrupted Levine, &ldquo;he fell over by accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Keep your evidence  until it is asked for,&rdquo; said the detective, angrily. He was beginning to lose his  temper. For the life of him he could not see the reason why Catherine wished  for this pocket-book.</p>
  <p align="left">Turning towards Levine  he eyed him sternly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now listen to me, my  man,&rdquo; he said, tapping the book. &ldquo;This matter is very serious and you may get  into trouble if you keep back any part of the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am telling the  truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Will you swear that  with the exception of the money the contents of this pocket-book are as you  found them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll take my oath  on the Bible that I&rsquo;ve touched nothing but the money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The man was evidently in  earnest, therefore Dillock was unwillingly forced to believe in him. With such  lack of evidence to implicate Catherine Granville he began to be more hopeful  of proving her innocence. After all she might not have met Carrant on that  night. The letter was the sole evidence against her&mdash;very strong evidence it is  true, yet it might be forged. It was doubtless an extreme view to take of the  matter especially for Dillock who was an unusually suspicious man, but he could  not bring himself to credit Catherine with such base conduct.</p>
  <p align="left">At this moment of his  cogitations Hugh briskly entered the room. He looked quite happy as he had just  concluded a stolen interview with Catherine on the parade. She told him that  her father having lost Carrant was now trying to make her encourage Halston  whose attentions were becoming very marked. On hearing this Hugh had seized the  golden opportunity, and proposed that they should revert to their former  intention and elope. After some persuasion Catherine had consented, as it  seemed to be the only way of escaping Halston&rsquo;s odious attentions, and filled  with joy Hugh parted from her to make all necessary arrangements. He intended  to see Dillock and tell him of his intention as he knew the detective was his  firm friend. Hearing he was engaged he waited on the verandah of the hotel when  the waiter delivered the message. He just paused for five minutes to write a  letter to his banker to send him some money and then walked upstairs to see  Dillock.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Dillock,&rdquo; he  said, gaily, glancing at the other two, &ldquo;what is the matter now? Nothing wrong  I hope,&rdquo; added he, noting the grave face of the detective, &ldquo;is it trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is and it is not,&rdquo;  replied Dillock, ambiguously. &ldquo;Do you know whose writing this is, Mr. Oliphant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hugh took up the letter  with secret alarm and glanced at it without making himself master of the  contents.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is Miss  Granville&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said, frankly, without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;How did it come  into your possession?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was in this  pocket-book,&rdquo; interposed Jackson.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That pocket-book. Whose  is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rudolph Carrant&rsquo;s,&rdquo;  said Dillock, gravely.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rudolph Carrant&rsquo;s,&rdquo;  repeated Hugh, in a shocked voice, snatching up the letter which he had laid  down on the table. &ldquo;A letter to Rudolph Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">There was an absolute  silence while Hugh read the letter. As he did so his face grew pale and he bit  his lip hard. In two minutes he laid the letter down again and looked at  Dillock with a bloodless face.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It means that Miss  Granville was with Carrant on the fourteenth of May at half past ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The remark was made by  Jackson and Oliphant without a word turned to look at him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She made the  appointment and kept it,&rdquo; continued Jackson, triumphantly.</p>
  <p align="left">Oliphant put his hand up  to his throat as though he felt a choking sensation, and looked at Dillock.</p>
  <p align="left">The detective shook his  head with a pitying smile.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If that letter is in  the handwriting of Miss Granville, I am afraid she met Carrant, as my friend  says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; cried  Oliphant, finding his voice for the first time. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a foul lie! Who dares to  say such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do for one,&rdquo; declared  Jackson, insolently.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He is a brother  detective of mine, Mr. Oliphant,&rdquo; said Dillock, quickly. &ldquo;It was he who found  the pocket-book on that man,&rdquo; he added, pointing to Levine.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And who is that man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the man who saw the  lady meet Mr. Carrant when he went over the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Great Heavens, don&rsquo;t  say she murdered him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo;  growled Levine, casting down his eyes. &ldquo;I only say she met him and he fell over  the cliff by accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Even that is  something,&rdquo; muttered Hugh under his breath, &ldquo;but it can&rsquo;t be true. I tell you,  Dillock, it is an infernal lie. Miss Granville went to bed early that night  with a bad headache. Besides, why should she make an appointment with Mr.  Carrant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I wish  to find out,&rdquo; said Dillock, impatiently. &ldquo;It appears that this man, Levine,  overheard her asking for some papers which were in this pocket-book. She  snatched the pocket-book from him and afterwards lost it. Levine found it and  says all the contents are intact with the exception of some money, but I cannot  find any letters or papers likely to be of use to Miss Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You surely don&rsquo;t  believe that she met this man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; said Dillock,  pointing to the letter. &ldquo;With that evidence I can do nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Hugh covered his face  with his hands and turned away with a groan. If this hitherto staunch friend  turned on them, then indeed there might be some ground for believing this  horrible story to be true.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I think the best way  would be to show the letter to Miss Granville and ask for an explanation,&rdquo;  suggested Jackson.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; cried  Oliphant, seizing Dillock by the arm. &ldquo;You come with me and we will go at once  to Miss Granville. These two men can stay here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind in the  least,&rdquo; said Jackson.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope the  young lady will be able to clear herself. Take the hat also, Dillock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock nodded and  picked up the straw hat and pocket-book off the table. Then without a word he took  Oliphant&rsquo;s arm and led him out of the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
          <i>A Doubtful Explanation</i></b></h2>
  <p align="left">On the way to Sir  Algernon&rsquo;s house Oliphant remained silent. This reticence rather astonished  Dillock, who quite expected to be closely questioned by the young man. The fact  is Hugh was afraid to ask further questions, lest Dillock should prove beyond  doubt that Catherine was guilty. While he could, he wished to cling to the  belief that she was innocent and could explain away the damning evidence of the  letter. Dillock, guessing this desperate loyalty, respected his silence, and  the pair walked side by side to their destination without exchanging a word.</p>
  <p align="left">When they arrived, the  servant said that Sir Algernon was out but that Miss Granville was in the  drawing room. Hugh sent up his name and was at once requested to walk up. They  ascended the stairs rapidly and presented themselves before Miss Granville, who  came eagerly forward to meet her lover. She looked pale and worn, but that  might have been caused by the intense heat of the day.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am so glad to see  you, Hugh,&rdquo; she said, taking his hand with a fond smile. &ldquo;Are you&mdash;Mr. Dillock,&rdquo;  she added, catching sight of the detective.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Hugh,  hastily, leading her to a seat. &ldquo;He has come with me, Catherine, to ask you a  few questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;About Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know nothing about  Mr. Carrant,&rdquo; she answered, sharply, &ldquo;he was always hateful to me. I can give  Mr. Dillock no information on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock opened his mouth  to reply, when he caught sight of a photograph on an adjacent table. It was a  portrait of Halston&mdash;an admirable representation of his smooth delicate  countenance. A few words and his signature were scribbled thereon.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Halston&rsquo;s portrait,  I see,&rdquo; said Dillock, carelessly, picking it up.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. He gave it to my  father yesterday,&rdquo; replied Miss Granville, coolly. </p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He is no favourite of yours,  Miss Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hate him. A  smooth-tongued piece of treachery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You speak strongly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No  more strongly than Halston deserves,&rdquo; said Hugh, suddenly. &ldquo;He pesters Miss  Granville with his attentions when she has shown him plainly that she does not  want to have anything to do with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Catherine frowned. She  did not like her affairs to be discussed before a stranger, especially when  that stranger was a detective. Touching Hugh&rsquo;s hand to intimate silence, she  turned towards Dillock and addressed herself directly to him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Mr. Oliphant says you  wish to ask me some questions concerning Mr. Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not exactly about Mr.  Carrant,&rdquo; replied Dillock, coming towards her in a leisurely manner, &ldquo;but about  this letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">The detective handed it  to her without a word, and with some astonishment she read it slowly from  beginning to end. At its conclusion she looked up with a flushed face and an indignant  look in her eyes.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo;  she demanded, looking from one man to the other.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have come to ask you  that, Miss Granville. What does your letter mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is not my letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not your letter,&rdquo;  repeated Dillock, while Hugh uttered an ejaculation of delight, &ldquo;but it is in  your hand-writing, it is signed with your name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is not mine,&rdquo;  declared Miss Granville, earnestly. &ldquo;I never wrote a letter to Mr. Carrant in  my life. This,&rdquo; tapping the paper, &ldquo;is an impudent forgery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I knew it. I knew it,&rdquo;  cried Oliphant, unable to repress his joy.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A forgery,&rdquo; repeated  Dillock, slowly. &ldquo;Ah! indeed, a forgery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He was evidently  thinking of something, for he stared at Catherine with a far-away look in his  eyes. &ldquo;You are sure it&rsquo;s a forgery,&rdquo; he added, abruptly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Of course it is. It is  not my writing. I don&rsquo;t use this kind of note paper and I certainly should not  have written to Mr. Carrant making an appointment on the cliff at half past  ten&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;On the fourteenth of  May,&rdquo; finished Dillock, significantly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The fourteenth of May,&rdquo;  she said, turning paler than ever. &ldquo;Why, that is the night&mdash;the hour when Mr.  Carrant met with his death. And this letter purporting to be written by me,  seems to show that I was there when he was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It shows all that, Miss  Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you accuse me of  this murder&mdash;do you&mdash;oh Hugh&mdash;Hugh. Say that you don&rsquo;t believe this infamous lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, No. I don&rsquo;t believe  it in the least,&rdquo; said Hugh, taking her in his arms. &ldquo;I quite believe that the  letter is forged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I swear it is. But who  forged it. Who dared to make use of my name in this way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Where did you find this  letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In the pocket-book of  Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That pocket-book  mentioned by my father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Catherine passed her  hand across her brow in a bewildered fashion. Catching sight of Oliphant&rsquo;s  perturbed countenance, she drew herself up with a proud gesture.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am not going to  faint, Hugh. Tell me all about this letter and you will see how I shall repel  this calumny.&rdquo; She sat down on the sofa beside Oliphant and placed her hand  within his. Dillock took a seat near them and told Levine&rsquo;s story in as few  words as possible. Catherine listened to every word, her face growing pale with  horror as he proceeded. Before he ended she sprang to her feet and paced to and  fro in an agitated manner. Neither of the men dared to make a remark.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh it is  infamous&mdash;infamous,&rdquo; she muttered, angrily. &ldquo;Who could have forged that letter?  I have no enemies that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Whoever forged that  letter must know your hand-writing well,&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very many people know my  handwriting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There is no one whom  you suspect?&rdquo; asked Dillock, thoughtfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; she answered,  quickly, &ldquo;if I did suspect anyone it would have to be a woman&mdash;according to your  own showing. It was a woman who met Mr. Carrant and no doubt she also forged  the letter. For what purpose I cannot conjecture. Why did she implicate me in  the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Levine said the woman  asked Carrant for some papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well. Are there any  papers in that pocket-book likely to throw light on the subject?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. Only a few visiting  cards, a cheque and that letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Granville picked up  the letter and looked at it in silence.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can easily understand  that Mr. Carrant thought this letter came from me,&rdquo; she said at length. &ldquo;He was  not well acquainted with my hand-writing and could easily mistake this bad  imitation as my penmanship. But what I cannot understand,&rdquo; she added, with  great emphasis, &ldquo;is why he should believe I desired to make such a ridiculous  appointment. I could see him here every day without meeting him at night on the  cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He did not see you on  that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I went to bed with  a bad headache.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Had you really a  headache?&rdquo; questioned Dillock, looking at her, &ldquo;or was it only an excuse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Partly one, partly the  other. Hugh arranged about our elopement in all ways save the time. I expected  to hear from him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And I sent you the time  on that locket&mdash;half past two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, you know I did  not receive that locket. Mr. Carrant stole it as we heard the other day. I was  determined not to see him on that night as I was anxious about you and feared  to betray myself. Therefore, making the excuse of a bad headache&mdash;and I really  had a slight one&mdash;I retired to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you stay in your  bed-room all that evening?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Catherine hesitated and  looked apprehensively at Dillock. He saw and at once interpreted her meaning.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can trust me, Miss  Granville,&rdquo; he said, quickly. &ldquo;I am a friend both to you and to Mr. Oliphant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did I not know you were  our friend I should not make the confession I now intend to make,&rdquo; she replied,  in a low voice.</p>
  <p align="left">The two men looked at  one another. What possible confession could she make in connection with the  events of that fatal night. Catherine saw the look which passed between them,  and smiled a trifle scornfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, I am not going to  confess myself guilty,&rdquo; she said, quickly, &ldquo;but simply tell you that I was out  on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You left the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, and at the time  mentioned in that letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What motive had you for  leaving the house at that strange hour?&rdquo; asked Dillock, sharply.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wished to see Mr.  Oliphant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I did not see you  on that night,&rdquo; said Hugh, in dismay. &ldquo;I was playing billiards up till  midnight, and then went to bed. I did not hear that you came to the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Nor did I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, what did you do,  Miss Granville?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;As I told you I  expected a communication from Mr. Oliphant respecting the time I was to meet  him at the station. He sent it marked on the locket so as to elude the  vigilance of my father. Unfortunately, as you are aware, I did not receive the  locket owing to Mr. Carrant&rsquo;s jealous suspicion. All the evening I waited for  news and became so anxious about ten o&rsquo;clock that I dressed and veiled myself  with the intention of seeing Hugh at his hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What a mad freak,&rdquo; said  Oliphant.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It was mad but I was so  excited that I hardly knew what I was doing. Shortly after ten I was assisted  by my maid to slip out of the house by the back door. As I went on to the road  I saw Mr. Carrant leave the house and depart in the opposite direction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I went along to Hugh&rsquo;s  hotel&mdash;to the Magpie Hotel. On arriving outside the grounds I saw a number of  gentlemen sitting in the verandah and became afraid lest I should be  recognised. It seemed impossible for me to see Hugh quietly with so many people  about so I abandoned my intentions and returned to the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;At a quarter to  eleven.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Altogether you were out  of the house about three quarters of an hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you see anyone with  Mr. Carrant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did you return by the parade?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I walked along the road. If Mr. Carrant met anyone it must have been near  the cliffs, so I did not see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did I not know you to  be innocent of this affair, Miss Granville, I should regard this confession as  a very perilous one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it!&rdquo; replied  Catherine, looking frankly at Dillock, &ldquo;but you say you are my friend so I  thought it best to tell all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I am glad you did so.  Have you made this confession to anyone else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do any of the servants  know that you were out of the house on that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Only my maid. I can  trust her to keep silent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She does not connect  your absence with Carrant,&rdquo; asked Hugh, anxiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. It is supposed Mr.  Carrant met his death by accident. No one knows anyone was with him at the time  of his death. I myself did not know till you told me to-day that it was a  woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d very much like to  know who this woman was,&rdquo; said Oliphant, grimly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How was she dressed?&rdquo;  asked Miss Granville.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;In some dark garments,&rdquo;  said Dillock, taking up the hat, &ldquo;and with this on her head. It blew off when  she was searching for the pocket book. It is not yours I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. But I have one  exactly like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. But that is  nothing. A hat of this colour and trimming is very common this season. Plenty  of women are wearing them, especially at the seaside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock whistled softly  and examined the label on the inside crown.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Abrahams &amp; Co., of  Oxford Street,&rdquo; he said, meditatively. &ldquo;I know those people. I&rsquo;ll go up to town  and have a talk with them. They will be able to tell me to whom they sold this  article.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll be able to  lay my hand on the woman who indirectly caused the death of Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But she did not thrust  him over the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough. I  don&rsquo;t think she intended to kill him, though she might have done so in the end  had she not secured the pocket book.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why did she want the  pocketbook?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you now,&rdquo;  said Dillock. &ldquo;I have an idea about the matter. Wait till I see Abrahams and  one or two other people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hope I have completely  exculpated myself,&rdquo; said Catherine, anxiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. I am quite sure  you had nothing to do with this affair. As to that rash visit to the Magpie  Hotel,&rdquo; continued Dillock with scorn, &ldquo;some detectives, on that evidence alone,  might swear that you wrote the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I did not write  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah! It is to your  interest to deny it. But don&rsquo;t be afraid Miss Granville. I&rsquo;m quite satisfied of  your innocence. It&rsquo;s a good thing you have me to deal with. I can see an inch  further than other people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you suspect anyone?&rdquo;  asked Hugh.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about  it in two days. Mr. Carrant&rsquo;s sins came home to him on the fourteenth. The  motive of the crime&mdash;for crime it is morally speaking&mdash;is to be found in London.  I go up there by the half-past seven train to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Can I help you in any  way?&rdquo; asked Catherine.</p>
  <p align="left">For a moment or two  Dillock reflected, and then looked up with a grim smile.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. I think you can.  Give me two things. First that portrait of Halston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; said  Catherine, slipping it out of its frame, &ldquo;but you surely don&rsquo;t suspect him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What would be the use  of that seeing it was a woman who met Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well here is the  portrait. What else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A letter of Mr.  Carrant&rsquo;s. Two letters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I can give you half a  dozen if you like,&rdquo; said Catherine, going to the door, &ldquo;he wrote me a great  many letters which were not answered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">When she left the room  to bring the letters, Hugh laid his hand on Dillock&rsquo;s arm and looked at him  curiously.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What have you in your  mind, Dillock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A good many things,&rdquo;  responded the detective. &ldquo;Look here, Mr. Oliphant, I have had my suspicions all  along of this affair. To-day those suspicions became certainty. I go to London  tonight. When I return I&rsquo;ll tell you something likely to cause you considerable  astonishment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, because I haven&rsquo;t  completely worked out my case. By the way did you know anything of Carrant&rsquo;s  life in town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not very much, but what  I did know was by no means creditable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That was to be  expected. Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you this much, Mr. Oliphant. In Mr. Carrant&rsquo;s past  life is to be found the reason for his death. If he hadn&rsquo;t died by accident, he  would have been murdered in any case.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By this woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, by this woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">At this moment Miss  Granville re-entered the room with a bundle of letters and put a stop to  further conversation between them. She placed the packet in the hands of  Dillock.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There are six letters  there,&rdquo; she said, smiling. &ldquo;The rest I destroyed. Does it matter much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. These are quite  sufficient for my object.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You leave for town  to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By the seven thirty  train. Let me see if I have all my proofs. Straw hat one, portrait two,  pocket-book three, bundle of letters four. Four pieces of evidence which will  turn this mystery inside out. I&rsquo;ll catch this woman but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But what, Mr. Dillock?&rdquo;  asked Catherine, seeing he hesitated.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be able to  arrest her. The death was accidental, so I&rsquo;m taking a lot of trouble for  nothing. Nevertheless I wish to thrash the matter out for my own satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And for mine,&rdquo; said  Catherine, taking Hugh&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not consider myself free from suspicion  till you find this woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite satisfied,  dear,&rdquo; replied Hugh, kissing her. &ldquo;I never suspected you for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
          <i>In Quest of Evidence</i></b></h2>
  <p align="left">Dillock left the lovers  alone and walked smartly to his hotel. Here he found Jackson impatiently  waiting his return.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the latter,  quickly. &ldquo;What does she say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She denies that she  wrote the letter or met Carrant on the cliffs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I thought she would do  that,&rdquo; scoffed Jackson, who had made up his mind to Catherine&rsquo;s guilt. &ldquo;But  what proof has she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No proof is needed,&rdquo;  replied Dillock, sharply. &ldquo;The girl is perfectly innocent, Jackson. Surely you  can rely on my judgment in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Then, if she is innocent,  who is guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely what I  want to talk about. I am going up to town tonight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;With me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I wish you to stay  here. I&rsquo;ll see to Levine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why do you wish me to  stay?&rdquo; grumbled Jackson, who by no means relished the prospect.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Listen, Jackson.  I&rsquo;ll tell you my idea and you&rsquo;ll soon see my reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">For the next hour the  two detectives were in deep conversation. At the end of that time Jackson  willingly consented to stay at Seagate and carry out the behests of his  superior officer. More than that he manifested the deepest admiration for  Dillock&rsquo;s skill and cuteness.</p>
  <p align="left">He for one had never  dreamed that the solution of the case could be at once so simple and  extraordinary.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any proofs  yet,&rdquo; said Dillock, in answer to this remark, &ldquo;but I hope to have them  to-morrow. All you have to do is to carry out my plans and keep your weather  eye open.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You can trust me,&rdquo;  replied Jackson, confidently, and so they parted.</p>
  <p align="left">On the way to town,  Dillock was thinking what would be the best thing to do with Levine. For  reasons of his own he did not want the story of the robbery to come out in open  court. As the death of Carrant was accidental there was no chance of punishing  the woman who inadvertently caused it. There was another little matter in connection  with the case which might probably lead to legal proceedings but this had  nothing to do with Levine. After some consideration Dillock decided that it  would be best to have Levine detained as a vagrant until he was sure of his  facts in connection with his theory. Then he would take advice and decide what  was best to be done.</p>
  <p align="left">Levine grumbled a great  deal at having to be locked up. He had told all he knew and wanted to be free,  quite ignoring the fact that he was answerable to the law for the stolen money.  Dillock succeeded in quieting him with a promise that he would do his best to  get him out of his trouble, so Levine went off quietly enough with Mitchell.  This little matter being thus disposed of, Dillock went to his lodgings to  think over matters, and lay his plans for the morrow.</p>
  <p align="left">Next morning he had his  hands full. In the first place he reported himself at Scotland Yard, and having  fulfilled this necessary duty, went off to see about the cheque found in  Carrant&rsquo;s pocket-book. A friend of his, called Flaxton, was an expert in  comparing handwriting and signatures, and had frequently been called as a  witness in forgery cases. To him Dillock submitted the letters of Rudolph  Carrant, the letter purporting to be written by Catherine Granville and the  cheque. Also a genuine letter of Catherine&rsquo;s which he had obtained from  Oliphant.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Here, Flaxton,&rdquo; said  Dillock, placing these before him. &ldquo;I wish your opinion on these matters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is it you wish to  know?&rdquo; asked Flaxton, looking at the four articles.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;First if the signature  R. Carrant, signed to that cheque is genuine. You can find that out by  comparing the signatures to these letters. Those are all right as the man wrote  them himself. I suspect the cheque to be a forgery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But it is paid. The  signature is scratched out and it is perforated with three holes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it is paid.  Nevertheless, I have my doubts about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said  Flaxton. &ldquo;What else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;See if the handwriting  in the body of the cheque bears any resemblance to the letter signed Catherine  Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I think so, except  that you might compare this letter with the rest of the writing and give me  your opinion on the lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">And Dillock laid on the  desk a letter he had received from Halston requesting him to meet him at the  Victoria Station. Flaxton took up the papers and nodded.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Call in and see me this  afternoon at three,&rdquo; he said, with a yawn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be able to tell you all about  them by that time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Satisfied that the  business would receive thorough attention at the hands of so capable a man as  Flaxton, the detective went off to attend to other matters. This time he drove  to Abrahams &amp; Co., of Oxford Street. It was a large shop and did a  considerable trade in cheap goods. People with limited means purchased whole costumes  at Abrahams&rsquo; at a very moderate price. Abrahams could supply everything from a  Highland costume to a Parisian made dress&mdash;or if it was not exactly Parisian  made it was called so, which was a sufficient recommendation in the eyes of  Abrahams&rsquo; customers. Most of the costumes in which male and female trippers  disported themselves at Margate came from the shop of Abrahams, so it can be  easily seen that this emporium was widely known and extensively patronised.</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock sent in his card  to the head of the establishment, who, fortunately, happened to be in at that  moment. Abrahams, learning that his visitor was a detective from Scotland Yard,  treated him with all courtesy. It was not the first time detectives had paid  him a visit, as some of Mr. Abrahams&rsquo; customers were rather shady and  frequently repaired to his shop for the purpose of buying disguises after  particularly nefarious purposes. It was the first time Dillock had been there,  but knowing he was a detective, Abrahams scented a criminal case at once. He was  a hook-nosed man of a pronounced Jewish type and was very deferential in his  manner.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good-day, sir.  Good-day,&rdquo; he said, when Dillock was shown into his private sanctum. &ldquo;And what  can I do for you my dear sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I wish to know if you  recognise this straw hat?&rdquo; replied Dillock, going straight to the point and  placing the article in question before him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is one of our hats,&rdquo;  said Abrahams, looking inside. &ldquo;There is our mark.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you know to whom you  sold it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My dear sir, I can&rsquo;t  tell that,&rdquo; replied Abrahams, with an expansive smile. &ldquo;We sell many of these  hats to ladies. It is now the sea-side season and a great many customers get  their summer clothes in this place. You will see dozens of these hats at  Margate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The same colour&mdash;trimmed  the same?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Precisely the same in  all respects.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have reason to  believe that the person who bought this purchased an entire costume to match.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not unlikely. Many of  our customers buy complete costumes. It is quite a speciality with us. We sell  them cheap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Does any special  costume go with this hat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Blue serge trimmed with  white braid. A very natty costume indeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I wish to find  out who bought a costume of that kind about the eleventh, twelfth or thirteenth  of May.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Abrahams bowed, smiled,  and touched a bell, when a clerk entered.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ask Mr. Brine to have  the goodness to step this way,&rdquo; said Abrahams. Then, when the clerk  disappeared, he turned to Dillock and explained. &ldquo;The head of the sea-side  department. If anyone is likely to know, it will be Brine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">As he finished speaking,  Mr. Brine entered. A tall pompous looking personage who looked far more like  the owner of the establishment than did his master.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Brine,&rdquo; said Abrahams,  impressively, &ldquo;this gentleman wants to know if you sold one of our serge  sea-side costumes on the eleventh, twelfth or thirteenth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I sold four, sir,&rdquo;  replied Brine, after a moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;Three were to ladies on the eleventh,  and one to a gentleman on the twelfth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To a gentleman,&rdquo; said  Dillock, trying to repress an exultant smile.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A young gentleman, sir.  Aged I should think about thirty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never mind about the  gentleman, Brine,&rdquo; said Abrahams, with a magnificent sweep of his hand, &ldquo;it is  about the ladies we wish to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;On the contrary, I wish  a full description of the gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Abrahams was crushed and  Brine smiled.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was a little under  the middle height, sir,&rdquo; he said, addressing himself directly to Dillock.  &ldquo;Clean shaven with dark hair and eyes. A very juvenile looking gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Like a girl,&rdquo; suggested  Dillock, artfully.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Now you mention it,  sir, he had a feminine cast of countenance He didn&rsquo;t look as though he indulged  much in field sports with that complexion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Afraid of sunburn,  probably,&rdquo; said Dillock, dryly. &ldquo;Why did he buy this costume?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He said he wanted it for  his wife, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Indeed. Why didn&rsquo;t she  come to try it on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;She was ill in bed so  he said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ill in bed and going to  the seaside. That doesn&rsquo;t look like the truth. Now tell me, Mr. Brine, did he  look like a gentleman who would buy a ready made costume for his wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Brine,&rdquo; said Abrahams,  in an awful voice, &ldquo;the best in the land buy their clothes here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know that, sir,&rdquo;  replied Brine, deferentially, &ldquo;but I should think this gentleman&rsquo;s wife would  be of the Bond Street sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Did he take the dress  with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, sir. He ordered it  to be packed and sent to Victoria Station addressed to Mr. Percy, to be called  for. I packed the things myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The dress and hat and  veil and other articles of ladies&rsquo; toilet, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Would you recognise  this gentleman if you saw him again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Easily, sir, he was  very handsome and his delicate complexion attracted my attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock laid the  portrait of Halston before the man. He recognised it at once.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him, sir. That&rsquo;s  the very gentleman. I&rsquo;d swear to him anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Good! You may be called  on to do so,&rdquo; replied Dillock, putting the portrait back into his pocket. &ldquo;I am  much obliged to you, Mr. Abrahams, yourself and Mr. Brine have done me a very  good service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I trust there is no  trouble over this,&rdquo; said Abrahams, anxiously, escorting Dillock to the door.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, no, I don&rsquo;t think  so. In fact, I question very much whether you will hear of it again. It is  merely a question of identification.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I hope it has been  successful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very successful,&rdquo;  replied Dillock, and took his leave.</p>
  <p align="left">The detective walked  away with a feeling of elation. He had been more fortunate than he expected and  now saw a chance of solving the Seagate mystery. It was nearly one o&rsquo;clock, and  he went back to his lodgings for some luncheon. Before doing so, he entered a  telegraph office and sent a wire to Jackson. It referred to the identity of the  man who called himself Percy, and so curiously resembled Halston.</p>
  <p align="left">After luncheon Mr.  Dillock waited about for half an hour or so and then walked to Flaxton&rsquo;s  office. He arrived before the appointed time but Flaxton had already done his  work and was quite willing to receive him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Mr. Dillock,&rdquo; he  said, rubbing his hands and pointing to the documents spread out on the table  before him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found out all you wished to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Am I right or wrong,  Flaxton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You are perfectly  right. The cheque is a forged one. Though how it comes to be paid beats me. I  must admit, however, that the signature is admirably imitated. He must be a  clever man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;This Mr. Halston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Do you mean to say he  forged the cheque?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Aye! He forged the  cheque and wrote this letter signed Catherine Granville. I&rsquo;ll stake my  professional reputation that it is so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You may be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not. As I say  the forgeries are excellent, but I can prove that they were all written by the  same man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Why, look here,&rdquo; said  Flaxton, pointing to the cheque. &ldquo;This C in Cecil is similar to the C in  Carrant. The &lsquo;n&rsquo; in each name is not unlike. Then look at the body of the  cheque. &lsquo;Pay Cecil Halston.&rsquo; It is almost like his own signature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, I see all that,  but the letter signed Catherine Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is distinctly a  masculine handwriting though a very good imitation of a woman&rsquo;s. The forger  took more care over the cheque than over the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t need to  trouble so much about the letter. The man to whom it was sent was very  imperfectly acquainted with the lady&rsquo;s handwriting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So I should think. It  is difficult to tell the cheque forgery. I don&rsquo;t wonder the bank officials were  deceived. But the letter. See here is the C in Catherine the same as in Cecil  and Carrant&mdash;also the &lsquo;a&rsquo; in Halston and Granville are like one another. I am  quite satisfied that the man who forged that cheque forged the letter, and his  name is Cecil Halston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock snapped his  fingers in the fulness of his joy.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Hurrah,&rdquo; he said,  smacking Flaxton on the back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Halston?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. He is a clever  rogue as you say but I&rsquo;ve run him to earth. But the worst of it is I can&rsquo;t nail  him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;For the forgery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And for a murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. It really wasn&rsquo;t a  murder but an accident. He was morally responsible, but that goes for nothing  in the eyes of the law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What about the  forgery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, you see, the bank  paid the cheque and won&rsquo;t acknowledge themselves to be in the wrong. The man  Carrant is dead and didn&rsquo;t say anything in his lifetime likely to prove that he  knew his name was forged. And finally the scamp Halston has come in for  Carrant&rsquo;s money. Now you see, I can&rsquo;t nail him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m afraid not.  Unless he confesses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If I bluff him he may  do so in the presence of witnesses, but I can&rsquo;t be sure. He&rsquo;s a clever rogue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You might catch him in  a trap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You may be sure I&rsquo;ll do  my best. I suspected him from the first but didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to bring  it home to him. And the queer part about it is that it was he who engaged me to  investigate the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What a fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t his  wish. There was a prospective father-in-law mixed up in the business who would  have taken the matter up for himself if Halston had not done so. Therefore, of  two evils, he chose the least and did it himself. I&rsquo;ve no doubt he thought he&rsquo;d  throw me off the scent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not complimentary to  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. It wasn&rsquo;t. However,  I&rsquo;m even with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard,&rdquo; said  Flaxton, reflectively, &ldquo;very hard. To engage you to run him to earth and he  didn&rsquo;t know you could do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the irony of  fate,&rdquo; laughed Dillock, as he took his departure, &ldquo;he was working for his own  ends and all the time was assisting me. The irony of fate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock had now all  necessary evidence to bring the crime home to Halston, yet the coincidences of  the case were so peculiar that he did not know very well how to proceed, so  went to Scotland Yard and laid the whole matter before the Commissioner. That  gentleman was very much astonished by the recital, and confessed himself to be  as much perplexed as Dillock.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know  what to say,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;the man is morally guilty, but that goes for  nothing. Levine can prove that the death was accidental, so he can get off on  that score. Despite the evidence of Flaxton, the Bank won&rsquo;t be foolish enough  to admit that they paid a forged cheque. It would do them too much harm. I  really don&rsquo;t see what can be done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If I get him to confess  that the cheque was forged in the presence of witnesses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, yes. Then you might  get the Public Prosecutor to take it up. But I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll manage to  trap this gentleman. He seems too clever for that. However you can try. But if  you get the better of him I shall be very much astonished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So shall I,&rdquo; was  Dillock&rsquo;s comment as he walked away.</p>
  <p align="left">That evening he received  a telegram from Jackson, which added the last link to the chain of evidence.  Quite satisfied that all was well Dillock went to bed and started next morning  for Seagate.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
    <i>The Triumph of a Scoundrel</i></b></h2>
  <p align="left">Meanwhile unconscious of  the storm about to break over his head, Halston returned to Seagate with the  intention of asking Catherine to be his wife. It was true that his cousin had  not long been dead, but Halston considered that no obstacle. Catherine had  never intended to marry him so there was no necessity why she should mourn for  his memory. The young man spoke to Sir Algernon on the subject and received  that gentleman&rsquo;s permission to broach the subject to Catherine.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Though I must say it is  rather soon after the death of Carrant,&rdquo; he said, in a hesitating manner.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that  matters, Sir Algernon. She never cared for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I question very much whether  she cares for you,&rdquo; retorted the baronet, angrily. &ldquo;I admit that it is my  desire that this match should take place, but Catherine is deeply in love with  Hugh Oliphant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t a sixpence  and I am well off. I think she&rsquo;ll see the difference between us. Besides,&rdquo;  added Halston, taking a case out of his pocket, &ldquo;I have bought her a diamond  necklace. No woman can refuse a man who offers her such jewels.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Sir Algernon cast a  careless glance at the necklace glittering on its blue velvet cushion and shrugged  his shoulders.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ask her, if you choose,  Halston, but I am afraid you won&rsquo;t get the answer you desire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Halston merely laughed  in a triumphant fashion and went off to the drawing-room to bribe Catherine  into matrimony with honeyed words and jewels. Sir Algernon remained in his  study thinking over the matter. He was by no means so anxious in thwarting  Catherine&rsquo;s love for Oliphant as he had been. By a side wind he heard that an  elderly relative of the young man was on the point of death and likely to leave  him a large fortune. Under these circumstances, if his daughter wished to marry  Oliphant he would let her do so. Sir Algernon felt quite virtuous as he made  this concession.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;And after all,&rdquo; he  soliloquised, &ldquo;she has two strings to her bow. If she marries either it will be  a good match. But I rather suspect she&rsquo;ll refuse Halston and marry Oliphant. I  don&rsquo;t care which she takes so long as they can allow me a decent income to live  on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Decidedly Sir Algernon  had an eye to the main chance in all matters touching his own comfort. His  selfishness and egotism almost amounted to mania.</p>
  <p align="left">On entering the  drawing-room Halston found Miss Granville reading a letter which she hastily  put away on hearing his footstep. He guessed it was from his rival from the  flush on her face, and smiled covertly to think how poor a chance had Oliphant  beside his own. No woman in her senses would refuse a man who could give her  diamonds. So Halston thought, and his experience of the sex was not small. But  then he had not yet met a woman like Catherine Granville. She was superior to  bribery in that way, but Halston, wise in his own conceit, did not know this.</p>
  <p align="left">She did not receive him  very warmly. There was no man of her acquaintance for whom she had a greater  dislike. With cold civility, she bade him welcome and mentioned that she had  thought he was in London. No reception could have been more frigid.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;So I was till last  night,&rdquo; replied Halston, his native impudence never deserting him for a moment,  &ldquo;but came down by the last train. I particularly wished to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To see me, Mr.  Halston?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. I wish to ask you  a question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Pray do not ask it,&rdquo;  she said, putting up her hand quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I must. You can guess  what I wish to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your manner is so  unmistakable that I cannot help guessing it,&rdquo; she returned, with rising anger.  &ldquo;I would much rather you were wise in time and did not ask me any question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Miss Granville smiled,  coldly. She hated the man and was determined not to spare him.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Rather a sudden growth  of affection is it not, Mr. Halston?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I loved you from  the day I saw you with my cousin a year ago. Then he was paying his addresses,  and I, pauper as I was, had no chance. I went away to the Continent in the vain  endeavour to live down my mad passion. Then I heard of Carrant&rsquo;s death and came  back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Came back to propose to  me within three weeks of your cousin&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo;  he asked, defiantly. &ldquo;You never loved him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. I did not love him.  Still a certain sense of decency might have restrained you from this insult.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is it an insult for a  man to ask a woman to be his wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. When that woman  shows plainly that she dislikes him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t love me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. You know I only  love one man in the world&mdash;Hugh Oliphant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He is a pauper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No matter. I love him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is mad folly for you  to throw yourself away on this beggar,&rdquo; he said, angrily. &ldquo;I can give you  wealth and happiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, no. Not happiness.  No man can give me that but Hugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If it be happiness to  starve, I&rsquo;ve no doubt he can give it you,&rdquo; he sneered.</p>
  <p align="left">Catherine arose from her  seat and walked across the room.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;If you came here to  insult me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I do not insult you,&rdquo;  he interrupted, eagerly. &ldquo;Nothing is farther from my thoughts. I love you. I  wish to make you my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I refuse. I do not wish  to marry you. No man but Hugh shall be my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He is a pauper, I tell  you,&rdquo; Halston repeated, angrily. &ldquo;He cannot give you wealth, he cannot give you  jewels like these.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">He opened the case and  thrust it into her hands. For one moment she looked at the glittering gems and  then placed the case quietly on the table beside her.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I refuse you and your  jewels. I am not to be bribed. Did you come here thinking I would be false to  the man I love for the sake of a few shining stones? Learn sir, that I esteem  Hugh Oliphant more than you or your wealth. I love him. I hate and despise  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Halston caught her hands  with a passionate gesture of entreaty. He was terribly in earnest.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But listen! listen!&rdquo; he  reiterated, over and over again.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, no. Go away, Mr.  Halston.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Leave me! Leave me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">She strove to draw her  hands from his clasp, but he held them firm. At that moment the door opened and  Sir Algernon entered the room. But not alone; behind him came Oliphant, Dillock  and Jackson. One look at their faces told Halston all. His game was up. With a  muttered curse he dropped Catherine&rsquo;s hands and turned to face and beat down  the danger which menaced him. The man was not wanting in courage and held his  own bravely; game to the last.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What is the matter,  papa?&rdquo; asked Catherine, somewhat amazed by this invasion.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Matter,&rdquo; repeated Sir  Algernon, who was white with anger. &ldquo;Yes, a great deal is the matter. That  fellow,&rdquo; pointing at Halston, &ldquo;has been found out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;What do you mean by  speaking of me in this fashion?&rdquo; demanded Halston, trying to steady his voice.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I shall leave the  explanation to Mr. Dillock,&rdquo; sneered the baronet, &ldquo;though I daresay you can  guess what is coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Halston looked at the  three stern faces bent so threateningly on his own, and then at Hugh who had  crossed to Catherine and taken her hand. He tried to assume a nonchalant  demeanour, and laughed uneasily. </p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, Mr. Dillock, I am waiting for your  promised explanation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I shall be delighted to  give it to you,&rdquo; replied Dillock, smoothly. &ldquo;Will you not be seated?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said  Halston, taking a chair. &ldquo;Now the sooner you put an end to this ridiculous  scene the better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It may not end in a  ridiculous fashion for you, Mr. Halston.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my chance of  that. Pray give me the promised explanation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;When you engaged me to  find out who had killed your cousin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;He was not killed,&rdquo;  interrupted Halston. &ldquo;It was an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;By so saying that you  condemn yourself. I did not say it was an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. But the jury said  so. However, go on and let me hear this precious story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very well. I won&rsquo;t take  up your time with preliminaries,&rdquo; said Dillock, feeling nettled by this  treatment. &ldquo;I have merely to say that it was indirectly through you that Mr.  Carrant met with his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Catherine uttered an  exclamation of horror and drew closer to her lover. Halston shrugged his  shoulders and signed to Dillock to continue. The other three men listened to  the dialogue silence.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Your cousin was rich,  and you poor,&rdquo; said Dillock, rapidly, so as to give Halston no chance of  interrupting again. &ldquo;He helped you a great many times in your extravagance, and  at last declined to assist you further. In desperation you forged his name to a  cheque for two hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; said  Halston, quietly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;It is not a lie. I have  the evidence of an expert to prove that the cheque is a forgery. It was so well  done, however, that Carrant&rsquo;s bankers cashed it without suspicion. As you know  Mr. Halston&mdash;and none better, your cousin was very careless over money matters.  He did not know that two hundred had been drawn out of his account till the  paid cheque was sent to him along with others in the due course of banking  business. Instead of proclaiming it a forgery, he sent for you and told you  that if you dared to come near him again he would prosecute you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I had no such  conversation with Carrant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes, you had, sir. He  knew that you were an unscrupulous scoundrel, and so, to protect himself, held  the forged cheque in terrorism over you. Enraged at this, and not being certain  what Carrant would do, you were anxious to get the cheque back. He carried it  as you knew in his pocket-book. Then you laid your plans. Going over to Paris  you wrote to Carrant from there to make him think you intended to stay abroad  and then returned secretly to England. Being a good mimic, and knowing the  affection Carrant had for Miss Granville, you determined to disguise yourself  as her and persuade him to give you up the cheque.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Catherine,  at this point, &ldquo;then it was he who wrote that letter in my name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. He applied his  talents in handwriting to forge a letter, making an appointment and signed it  Catherine Granville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You villain!&rdquo; cried  Miss Granville.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Lies! Lies! All lies!&rdquo;  muttered Halston, whose face was livid with rage.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;To disguise yourself as  a woman was a clever stroke, Mr. Halston,&rdquo; continued Dillock, with a sneer.  &ldquo;You thought by that to throw the law off the scent or entangle Miss Granville  in difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I did not disguise  myself as a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes you did, sir. You went  to Abrahams &amp; Co. in Oxford Street, and bought a ready made serge costume  complete, had it sent to Victoria addressed to Mr. Percy, and then came down to  Seagate. Here, as Jackson discovered, you took lodgings for one night&mdash;the  fourteenth of May&mdash;as Mr. Percy; sent your forged letter to Carrant at his hotel  inviting him to meet the supposed Miss Granville on the cliffs, and then,  disguising yourself as a woman, went to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;A perfect farce this  is,&rdquo; laughed Halston. &ldquo;How could I disguise myself as a woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, you are clever at  amateur theatricals, and the night being dark aided your enterprise. Carrant,  being half drunk, never suspected the truth, particularly as you were veiled.  You asked for the cheque&mdash;the paper you called it&mdash;and when he would not give it  to you, threatened to throw yourself over the cliff. Carrant, not being very  clear-headed, and thinking you were Miss Granville, got between you and the  cliff. To pacify you he produced the pocket book containing the cheque, with  the intention of giving it to you. You snatched it from him, and he, forgetting  he was on the edge of the cliff, stepped back and fell over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;An accident!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I know it was an  accident otherwise I would arrest you for murder,&rdquo; retorted Dillock, coolly,  &ldquo;yet for the moment you were afraid. The pocket-book slipped from your hands  and fell over me cliff. Notwithstanding your fear you went down&mdash;not to see if  Carrant still lived&mdash;but to find the pocket-book. You thought you were alone.  You were watched.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Watched, said Halston,  with a slight start.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Yes. A tramp called  Levine overheard your conversation with Carrant and saw the accident. He  followed you down the cliff and when your hat fell off picked it up. By that  hat I found Mr. Percy and Mr. Halston were one and the same person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Halston muttered  something indistinctly and arose to his feet.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Is there any more of  this?&rdquo; he asked, sullenly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Very little. You  couldn&rsquo;t find the pocket-book but Levine did after you left the spot. It is now  in my possession with the forged cheque and forged letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I forged neither cheque  nor letter and I defy you to prove that I did so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;The expert Flaxton&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Halston snapped his  fingers and sneered.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;That for the expert,&rdquo;  he said, insolently, &ldquo;he can say the cheque is forged if he likes but I say it  is not. Carrant gave it to me. I presented it at the bank and it was duly  honoured. Who is to say it is forged. Not the bank officials. They will not  admit themselves to be in the wrong. Not Carrant. He is dead. You can&rsquo;t touch  me for the forgery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Ah, you then admit it  to be a forgery,&rdquo; said Dillock, quickly.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, I only put  a supposititious case. I say the cheque is a good one and I defy you to prove  it otherwise. As to the death of Carrant&mdash;it was caused by an accident so you  can&rsquo;t arrest me for that. In fact, my dear Dillock,&rdquo; he added, strolling  towards the door, &ldquo;I go quite clear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;But it was you who  disguised yourself as a woman and stole the pocketbook. Why did you take all  that trouble if the cheque was a good one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I deny your story  altogether. I am not in the habit of disguising myself. I could have seen  Carrant without all that elaborate scheming. In fact, I say that your story is  a pack of lies. I admit nothing and go free.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock was unable to  say more and turned away with a look of anger on his face. The man whom he had  unmasked and who denied everything stood at the door looking at them all with a  derisive smile.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I have to thank you  gentlemen for the trouble you have taken to hang me, but you see I have  escaped. Miss Granville, I congratulate you on your engagement to that pauper.  The diamonds I&rsquo;ll take with me, and you and he can starve together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Irritated by this last  insult Hugh rushed forward and caught him by the throat. Forcing him outside  the door he threw him down the stairs.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;There you scoundrel,&rdquo;  he shouted after him, &ldquo;you have at least that punishment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Halston picked himself  up with a curse, shook his fist at his rival, and left the house expeditiously.  Later on he left England and no one regretted his departure.</p>
  <p align="left">When Hugh returned to  the drawing-room, he found his hand warmly shaken by Sir Algernon.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Thank you, thank you,  my boy,&rdquo; said the baronet, in a gratified tone. &ldquo;I am glad you did that. The  scoundrel. To think he might have married Catherine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Well, he will not do so  now,&rdquo; said Hugh, smiling.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No. No. You shall be  her husband. I withdraw all objections.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;My dear Sir Algernon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Not a word&mdash;not a word.  Poor as you are she shall be your wife. Catherine, my dear child,&rdquo; leading Hugh  to his daughter, &ldquo;you can kiss your future husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">After that Sir Algernon  turned away with the conviction that he had yielded very gracefully. Catherine  and Hugh were quite overwhelmed by this magnanimity, and even when Hugh became  rich he never forgot Sir Algernon&rsquo;s kindness in letting him marry Catherine  when he was poor. Of course he knew nothing about the baronet&rsquo;s private  information regarding the elderly relation&rsquo;s fortune, so Sir Algernon, like  many other people, gained a reputation which he by no means deserved. Meanwhile  Dillock and Jackson looked ruefully at one another.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve caught our man,&rdquo;  said Dillock, with a sigh, &ldquo;but can&rsquo;t nab him. Oh, he is an artful one that  Halston. And the worst of it is that it is he who was to pay me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Never mind about that,&rdquo;  said Hugh, overhearing this remark. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be responsible for the debt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;Oh, thank you, sir,&rdquo;  said Dillock and Jackson together.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;No thanks,&rdquo; replied  Oliphant, laughing. For indirectly through your removing a dangerous rival I  have gained my wife. But tell me, Dillock, when did you first suspect Halston?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">Dillock smiled and  looked wise.</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I suspected him from  the time he explained things in the railway carriage, sir. I saw that he was  trying to put me off the scent and kept my eye on him. When I heard Levine&rsquo;s  story of a woman I was rather put out of my reckoning. Then it struck me he  might have disguised himself as he was rather feminine in appearance. I was  certain of this when I saw the cheque and the forged letter. Then the evidence  of Abrahams proved that I was right. The rest was easy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;You found it out very  skilfully.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="left">&ldquo;I should like to have  punished him,&rdquo; said Dillock, regretfully, &ldquo;but the queer part is, sir, that he  was working against himself the whole time and didn&rsquo;t know it. The irony of  fate I call it.&rdquo;</p>
