<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter I. The Lovely Land</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>ANDY BURNETT reached California in the autumn of 1832. It is
impossible to say exactly where he and his three horses crossed the
Sierras. He may have found his way past what is now called Donner
Lake and so over the summit and down the American River; or, more
probably, he may have picked a route farther north. Andy was an
old-time mountain man, of ten years' experience in the Rockies, and
a range of mountains more or less presented to him, at this time of
year, no extraordinary difficulties. He did not suffer from lack of
food, because, before he had left the deer country, he had laid in
a sufficient stock of jerked meat. His animals came through in good
shape for the reason that, before he took them out of the rich
grasses of the hanging meadows at the six-thousand-foot level, he
had scouted afoot to find out exactly where next he should land
them. He neither lost nor crippled them, for he knew what a horse
could do; he had developed an eye for the "lay" of country, and he
allowed himself to be led by the logic of geological formations,
which Andy had never studied, of which he could have told you
nothing, but along which his experience-developed instinct led him
as down a broad highway.</p>

<p>He made no plunging, heart-bursting, exhausting struggles
through the snows. When he came to the snow he sat down quietly and
fed himself and his horses, and smoked his pipe, and waited. Then,
when the surface had hardened, he led his buckskin-shod animals
over the crust. He even took time at the summit to look abroad
admiringly on a world made fragile by the moon. Once across the
Divide, he stopped at a soggy Alpine pocket amid the granite, where
were willows, and short grasses, and flowers, and small rivulets
chuckling over some secret they were bringing from under the snow.
Andy had already visited the pocket, afoot. Here again he waited
and smoked his pipe, until sundry upside-down birdlings in the
willows told him it was near to morning.</p>

<p>This was as far as Andy had scouted in advance. The rest was
downhill. Every trickle of water showed him direction, but he knew
better than to follow the streams. Streams are gay and bounding
people who think nothing of foaming leaps and tumbled boulders.
They have a way of luring one down easy ways until he finds himself
in a cañon some thousands of feet deep, and then disappearing over
edges. Andy wanted a gentle descent, so he kept to the ridge of a
"hog's back," where were only minor problems of ledge and cliff.
Then he left the willows and entered pines. Some of the riding was
over a brown, thick carpet of needles through the spaced columns of
a cathedral: some of it was badly complicated by the snow brush and
manzanita. Andy took his time. He refused to involve himself, to
plunge ahead regardless, in blind confidence that there was another
side, near by, accessible. Never for a moment was absent from his
mind the last spot where would be available the two necessities,
grass&mdash;or browse&mdash;and water; to which he could, if need
arose, back-track for a fresh start.</p>

<p>The cañons dropped swiftly away below him to left and right.
Through the thick shafts of the yellow pines he caught glimpses of
the blue of depth, and the forested slope across, like ruffled fur.
After a time, on the second day since leaving the Alpine meadow,
the rounded slope of the hog's back plunged to a steep descent. The
pines dwindled and scattered. Small oaks appeared here and there,
and pungent sage, and the brittle rustlings of chaparral. The air
tasted hot and dry in the nostrils; and lizards darted and stopped,
darted and stopped, curtseying up and down and inflating the
soft-brilliance of their throats.</p>

<p>Here was no water, and Andy had to make a dry camp.</p>

<p>He had exhausted his canteen and was thirsty. So were his
horses; and hungry as well. In the depths of the cañon below ran
clear water, and the bottom widened to a flat with cottonwood and
grass. Nothing prevented a steep descent. But Andy was a mountain
man and knew better than to yield to the temptation, as did later
many an unfortunate who has left us an account of his tribulations.
He caught his loose horses and tied them to be led, and sucked a
bullet, and did not hurry. And at the last, after a multitude of
minor checks which Andy patiently circumvented, the horses braced
their feet and half slid, half scrambled down the last powdery
steep of the hog's back to meet again beyond the "breaks"&mdash;the
cool trickle from the snows, now grown to a river.</p>

<p>Andy was a little hungry, the horses were somewhat gaunted. But
he had suffered no great hardships, been in no imminent danger. He
had crossed the Sierra as he had crossed a hundred times through
unknown passes of the Rockies. It was to him part of the day's
work. It never occurred to him that he had done anything
extraordinary. That point of view was reserved for the
"pathfinders" and the greenhorns who would come later, the
"explorers" who were to follow more bunglingly his trails, and the
trails of his fellows, without his slow patience or his cunning, to
be written of in books.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>NEVERTHELESS, even to Andy it was a queer country. Its
conditions were strange to him. The sky was clear and deeply blue.
The sun was strong. The air was hot. But the strength of the sun
had no oppressive weight. It poured downlike a golden flood. Every
tissue in Andy's body expanded to absorb it. Its very fire was
grateful. The air rose in shimmers like the blast from an open
furnace. Its heat bit his nostrils, But his skin was dry and his
vigor unimpaired. The sagebrush of the bottom lands and the low
hills crackled with the brittleness of desiccation as he moved
through it. Its odor rose pungent to his nostrils. The earth was
baked to an iron hardness. On its surface lingered a few dried
sparse patches of the grasses of a former season, thin and fragile,
without virtue.</p>

<p>It seemed an inhospitable land. The water was cold and clear.
The man and his animals quenched their thirst. But that was all.
Andy went hunting. There were no deer, though plenty of tracks
petrified in what had been mud, many months before. The horses
nuzzled the grass, then turned away. But shortly Andy noticed them
eagerly licking the apparently bare ground. Examining closely he
found it covered with small oily seeds, the fruit of the burr
clover. After an incredibly brief time the beasts retired to the
shade, stood on three legs, and snoozed. They were satisfyingly
fed. On the side hill, among the small vales he heard a snuffling,
and saw the great brown body of a grizzly eating the acorns beneath
the trees. Like most sensible mountain men, he had always avoided
when possible an encounter with these animals, having found that
they were in general harmless when undisturbed, but formidable in
combat, especially to a man in command of but a single small
bullet. But the jerked meat was exhausted, and there seemed no
other game but quail, on which Andy was reluctant to expend his
precious ammunition. So without haste he went into war, delivering
his shot coolly, springing into the branches of an oak when the
beast charged, awaiting there in confidence the effect of his
carefully delivered heart shot.</p>

<p>That night he feasted on bear steak. The next morning he caught
up his horses, already filling out their gauntness, tied the bear's
paws to his saddle, and rode to the west.</p>

<p>All day he moved in and out of diminishing hills. Live oaks were
spaced on their slopes and crests as though planted for a park. The
sagebrush ended. The dry brown grass thickened, grew tall. Just
before sunset he eased himself in his saddle and looked abroad over
the plains of the great valley.</p>

<p>The sun was in his eyes, its rim just touching gold-powdered
mountains fat and low to the west. The heat of the day was lifting.
From the snows of the Sierra breathed an air. The plains were like
a great brown sea. Under a breath of breeze all its surface
rippled. With a heavier puff of wind it broke into waves which ran
away and away until lost in the horizon haze. A herd of elk grazed
in the middle distance; a long patterned flight of wild fowl cut
the lucent green of the western sky. In the air was a deep humming
undertone of bees, a calling of small birds, a liquid, checked
half-song of a meadowlark remembering spring. A released fragrance
of ripe grasses clung to the last of the day's warmth. From
cottonwoods at the stream's edge floated the mourning of doves.</p>

<p>Andy straightened in his saddle with a deep sigh. It seemed to
him, for the moment, at least, that he had at last found the peace
for which he had journeyed so far. The cloud of frustration, of
tragedy, of loss of those he held most dear, of gathering
bitterness and strife, had broken against the serenity of those
distant peaks turning rose in the sunset. He had escaped into the
Lovely Land.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>THAT night he slept among the cottonwoods. Next day he rode
through the waist-high grasses. Soon he ran into swarms of
game&mdash;elk, antelope, deer in herds throughout the bottoms.
Andy had never seen so many waterfowl; had never imagined there
could be so many, anywhere. They covered the surfaces of the small
lakes so thickly that, even from the vantage of his saddle, Andy
could discern but a gleam of water here and there. As he rode
nearer he found the borders of these ponds eaten, or beaten, bare
for a hundred feet or more, to form muddy beaches, and that the
beaches too were covered with the ducks and geese, basking or
preening in the sun. He rode among them. They waddled away, to
right or left, shaking their tails in indignation, gabbling their
opinion of discourtesy. But they did not fly. Andy waved his arms
and shouted. A few of the more nervous sprang into the air; but
immediately dropped down again. But every head was turned
accusingly toward the intruder; and into the peaceful air arose a
mighty chorus of quackings and honkings. For the first time since
the fatal Rendezvous at Pierre's Hole a slow grave smile lightened
Andy's face.</p>

<p>"Now, look here!" he expostulated, speaking aloud after the
fashion of the man who spends much of his year in solitude, "I've
got as much right here as you have! I never in my life been so
cussed out!"</p>

<p>A goose stretched her neck at him, hissing, seeming almost
decided to nip a horse's legs. Andy turned his smile toward this
valiant but somewhat ridiculous champion.</p>

<p>"No, you don't, old girl," said he. "I've got a trick of my
own!"</p>

<p>On a sudden impulse he extended the long rifle and fired it into
the air.</p>

<p>A blank instant silence followed the sharp crack of the piece,
broken a half second later by the crash as of a mighty waterfall as
the birds took wing. It seemed as if the dark earth were lifting to
expose the hidden silver of the lake. The air was filled with
hurtling bodies. The very sky was darkened. And another great roar,
and a third, like successive peals of thunder, rolled across the
man's astonishment; and then a smooth high silence made up of the
thin whistlings of thousands upon thousands of wings. But the
startlement was only momentary. Almost at once the birds began to
drop back to their resting places, at first by ones and twos, then
by tens and twenties, finally by thousands. Each volplaned down at
a sharp angle, up-ended, lowered yellow webbed feet, set the brakes
of outspread pinions, furrowed the water in a long silver curve,
and came to rest, wagging his tail vigorously, fluffing his plumes,
and quack-quacking his resentment at the shock to his nerves. Andy
threw back his head and laughed long and joyously. A cloud seemed
to have rolled away, a physical weight to have been lifted from his
somber spirit. He rode on, whistling under his breath, with a new
eye cocked to the low circling marsh hawks and the high sailing
vultures and the remote calm blue of the sky.</p>

<p>But when, a time later, he brought his gaze back from this high
ecstasy to the practical affairs of life, he drew rein abruptly
with a swift curse at his lapse from the mountain-bred wariness
which until now he had never relaxed for a single moment of his ten
years in the wilderness, a wariness that had brought him this far
safely through many dangers, but which now, it appeared, he had
abandoned at exactly the wrong time. For he had ridden unseeing
over a low undulation of the plains smack into the middle of a
wandering band of Indians. They surrounded him on all sides, thirty
or forty of them, and were standing silent, looking at him.</p>

<p>Andy was accustomed to the Indians of the plains and the
mountains, a fine warlike people, with considerable claim to a
civilization of their own. Save for the miserable creatures at the
water holes of the Utah desert, whom he had encountered when with
Jedediah Smith, he had never seen as wild and primitive a lot as
this. He sat his horse quietly and looked them over, trying to size
up the situation, to determine a course of action. And while he did
so, he cursed himself as a heedless fool.</p>

<p>They were a hard-looking lot, Andy thought, short, squat,
heavily muscled, with flat expressionless faces and small beady
eyes, Most of them were naked, except for a scrap of skin. One man
wore a curious robe made of ropes of feathers twisted together. A
few had plastered themselves with an overcoat of mud. Many were
tattooed with blue-black transverse stripes across the face and
body. Their hair was as coarse as thread. Most wore it long, to the
waist; but some had trimmed it to five or six inches, and its
stiffness stood it out like bristles. Andy's eyes ran over them
appraisingly, seeking for indications that might guide his course
of action. He saw women, which was encouraging in a way&mdash;or
would have been were these Indians whose habits he knew. The men
carried short bows, which was not so good. All were afoot; but Andy
could not risk a dash, not with a laden pack horse, anyway. They
made no hostile demonstration. In fact, they did not move at all;
they merely stared.</p>

<p>Andy spoke to them in sign language. He tried them in several of
the trans-mountain dialects, finally in Spanish. They continued to
stare. At length he gathered up his reins and, rather gingerly,
moved his horse forward. They did not offer to stop him. But they
accompanied him. When again he drew rein, after a few yards, they
too halted. And continued to stare.</p>

<p>Andy pondered. The situation was decidedly perplexing. Though
not at the moment hostile, these people had him at their mercy,
unless he could disengage himself. And just how was he to do
that?</p>

<p>Finally one who might have been a headman or chief&mdash;at
least, he wore a headdress of woven grass and
feathers&mdash;stepped forward&mdash;Andy eyed him narrowly for a
sign of hostility, testing the looseness of his knife in its
sheath. The man touched one of the bear paws hanging at Andy's
saddlebow and said something. Andy did not comprehend the words,
but he did the look of inquiry. When the Indian understood that
Andy had killed the bear he threw back his head and gave utterance
to a long wolf-like howl. The unwinking immobility of the
bystanders broke. A number ran off through the grass in several
directions. The others chattered to one another, moved about. But
none ventured to approach, nor was there any evidence of hostile
intention. Andy sat his saddle in alert expectation for five
minutes; then ventured to move on. They made no offer to hinder
him; but followed after, like a pack of dogs. Andy did not like
that. He rode in momentary expectation of an arrow in his back. But
there was nothing else to do; so he continued, trying at first to
watch as well as he could. It was impossible to do so with any
efficiency because of the high grass. Finally he gave it up with a
shrug.</p>

<p>After a time, from the elevation of his saddle, he began to see
the bobbing heads and shoulders of other Indians converging from
several directions, hundreds of them. As they came nearer he
noticed that each wore a single white feather in his hair. He
stopped; then rode on. If he was to fight, one spot was as good as
another, unless he could gain some vantage point. He spied about
him for a grove of trees, a thicket, even a slight elevation. There
was none.</p>

<p>As the newcomers drew nearer Andy saw that many of them were
women, and that they bore armfuls of green branches and tules,
These, when they had approached, they proceeded to scatter in
handfuls before the hoofs of Andy's saddle horse. He rode forward
on an improvised carpet. Gradually he gained confidence. They
seemed to be honoring him in a rude fashion of their own. But as he
looked about at the impassive, ugly, stupid, cruel faces, he was
not so sure. The bead-like eyes stared at him unblinking.</p>

<p>After some hours he saw in the distance a low butte-like hill
with a flat top. Unmolested he rode to this, dismounted, tied his
horses nose to nose, made the best disposition he could for
defense. That was not much; the people crowded about him too
closely. He sat in the midst of his possessions, his long rifle
across his knees, and waited. He wondered what he should do when
night fell. The Indians stared at him. Andy's nerves were good; but
this was beginning to get him a little.</p>

<p>More women came in. They brought baskets which they set down
before him, dozens of baskets. Soon he was fairly barricaded by
them. He examined them. They were filled with acorn meal, with
bread in small dingy loaves, with grass seeds, with dried
grasshoppers. He tasted some of the bread and found it bitter, but
the action seemed to please the savages. The sun set. Andy managed
to convey the idea that he wished the top of the hill to himself.
To his great surprise the whole multitude withdrew to its base,
where they camped below him in a great circle. Andy unsaddled his
horses, picketed them, made of his belongings and the baskets a
rude fortification: He lighted his pipe and took up his vigil, for
he still feared treachery. Evidently someone somehow carried fire,
for shortly tiny blazes sprang up in the gathering dusk. After a
time a spark advanced up the hill. As it came near Andy saw it was
carried by a single unarmed man. The savage laid down the brand and
retired. Andy made himself a fire of sorts from the dried brittle
brushwood that grew sparsely near where he sat. No other invaded
his sanctity of the hill, though he watched all night, but at
daylight the whole tribe swarmed up the slope, to squat about and
stare.</p>

<p>Andy saddled; mounted; turned down the slope toward the south.
The people remained where they were, without following. No one made
even a gesture of farewell.</p>

<p>He rode nearly to the foot of the hill; then bethought him, and
turned back. From his saddlebow he untied the paws of the grizzly
bear and gave them to the chief. He would not need them now as
food; there was a plenty of game. For the second time the man's
unwinking animal gravity broke, his spirit rose to the surface of
his beady eyes. Again he threw back his head to utter his long
howl. And the faces of the bystanders became human.</p>

<p>A quarter mile from the foot of the hill Andy turned in his
saddle to look back. The Indians were gathered in a compact group
on the summit. When they saw him turn they waved their hands in
farewell. The whole experience was mystifying.</p>

<p>Within the hour Andy had his second encounter in California.
This time the men were five, and mounted, so he saw them in the
distance and composed himself advantageously to await their
approach. This was headlong, until the party was within a little
over a hundred yards. Then the leader uttered a sharp command. The
horses threw up their heads, stiffened their forelegs, and came to
a plunging stop. The leader trotted forward alone. Andy examined
him watchfully and with some curiosity.</p>

<p>This was rather a small man on a very fine horse. He wore a flat
glazed hat tied under his chin, and fine <i>botas</i> with silver
spurs. The rest of his dress, whatever it might be, was concealed
by a loose, sleeveless leathern armor. Andy later learned this to
be composed of seven thicknesses of antelope skin, and that it
would stop an arrow handily; but at the moment it looked like
rather an awkward smock. A saddle covering of the same material
afforded a partial protection to the horse. On either side the
pommel hung a large pistol in a holster. A sword swung at the
rider's side. As he drew near Andy saw him to be dark, young, and
rather handsome, especially when, as now, he flashed very white
teeth in a smile.</p>

<p>"<i>Buenas tardes, señor</i>," he greeted Andy, who watched him
composedly but with a finger within the trigger guard. "Lieutenant
Jesus Maria Corbedo de Cortilla of the Army of Mexico upon the
affairs of the Republic with troops."</p>

<p>He gestured largely toward the four still in the background.
"You understand Spanish?" he added as an afterthought, "Ah, that is
well. And you? You are a Hudson's Bay man, no? Would you be so
polite as to afford me a glimpse of your <i>permiso</i>?"</p>

<p>"My <i>permiso</i>?" repeated Andy, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Your permission to travel in these the lands of the
Republic."</p>

<p>"I am but now across the mountains, <i>señor</i>," explained
Andy. "You are the first man&mdash;white man," he corrected, "whom
I have encountered. So naturally I have no permit such as you
mention."</p>

<p>The officer drew his brows together, pursed his small red
mouth.</p>

<p>"No permit, hah! From over the mountains, hah! You are not
Hudson's Bay man! You are <i>americano</i>!" he accused.</p>

<p>A fleeting grave smile sketched Andy's lips at the little man's
fussy excitement.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, <i>señor</i> lieutenant," he acknowledged. "My name
is Andrew Burnett," he added.</p>

<p>"This is important. This must be seen to. At once. You are under
arrest," he stated suddenly.</p>

<p>The grave smile reappeared on Andy's lips and stayed there. The
muzzle of the long rifle shifted slightly but significantly.</p>

<p>"That is as may be, <i>señor</i>," said he.</p>

<p>"But let us not be hasty; let us consider." The Mexican's eyes
shifted, and he paled slightly. "The situation is most irregular.
Dismount, <i>señor</i>, and let us discuss this matter." He signed,
almost imperceptibly, with his hand, and the four men gathered
their reins and turned their horses.</p>

<p>"Willingly, <i>señor</i> lieutenant; but alone," replied Andy;
then, with a snap in his voice and a flash in his gray eyes, "Order
your men to stay where they are!" Again the long rifle shifted,
until now its muzzle pointed toward the officer's chest. The
Mexican shouted a command. The soldiers stopped; drew together in a
group, and began indifferently to roll cigarettes.</p>

<p>The officer dismounted. Andy too swung himself from his saddle.
The two men squatted on their heels together. Above them stood the
horses. The Mexican's animal was a fine beast. From the corner of
his eye Andy surveyed its proportions with admiration. It stood
like a statue, its head high, its little ears pricked forward,
turning over and over on its tongue the metal rollers of its
bit.</p>

<p>"The situation is complicated," repeated the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The truculence had evaporated from his manner. He was all
smiles. His bearing was intimate, as though he took Andy into his
confidence, asking him to share his difficulties. "It is my duty to
escort you to the Governor, <i>señor</i>. But I am on campaign. I
fight the Indians." He swelled his chest beneath the <i>cuero</i>
and slapped himself vigorously. "I am an Indian fighter,
<i>señor</i>. That is my duty in the army. Were you not a stranger,
<i>señor</i>, you would know the name of Cortilla." He produced
tobacco and corn husks, which he offered politely; then, on Andy's
refusal, proceeded to roll a cigarette and to puff the tobacco
fiercely through his nostrils. "I have fought many campaigns. It is
sufficient that these others learn that Cortilla is afield. They
flee, they scatter, their <i>rancherías</i> are abandoned. Them I
burn," he added; then, as an afterthought, "But perhaps you too
have fought the Indians, there, across the mountains, <i>señor</i>?
If so, you can appreciate the difficulties and the hardships of a
soldier's life."</p>

<p>To the mountain man, new come from a long sojourn among the
warlike tribes of the plains and ranges, from the winter blizzards
and summer "dry scrapes" of the wilderness of the "Great American
Desert," riding about in this lovely land in pursuit of such simple
savages as he had seen looked more like a picnic than a campaign.
But he agreed politely.</p>

<p>"These Indians make war on your people?" he asked. The Mexican
explained. The missions and ranches of the Spanish occupation were
all near the coast. The Indians there were Christians, civilized by
the efforts of the <i>padres</i>.</p>

<p>"A cattle, <i>señor</i>," said the officer contemptuously, "but
useful."</p>

<p>Back of this narrow strip lay the broad valleys and the Sierra,
a wild country, visited by no man in his senses except at the call
of duty. Here dwelt the wild tribes, the "gentiles." They were
lower than cattle, mere beasts. No one disturbed them.</p>

<p>"Save when the good <i>padres</i> need converts,
<i>señor</i>."</p>

<p>But these gentiles would not stay put. Every so often they made
raids. Then they must be pursued. And the duty of pursuit fell upon
him, Jesus Maria Corbedo de Cortilla. It was a hard life.</p>

<p>"You have not a large force, <i>señor</i>," observed Andy.</p>

<p>"Stout hearts! Strong arms!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, thought Andy, these gentiles could not be very
formidable. He questioned. It developed that the warfare was not a
matter of much bloodshed. The Indians raided with one object in
view, to steal horses. This they accomplished at night, without
attempting to come in conflict with the <i>rancheros</i>, indeed
with a very successful determination to keep out of sight. Then the
soldiers were sent out in pursuit; Ordinarily they succeeded in
recovering most of the stolen animals, for the trail was easy to
follow, driven animals moved more slowly than mounted men, and the
raiders scattered without resistance when overtaken.</p>

<p>"Like quail, like rabbits, <i>señor</i>," complained the
lieutenant, "in the bush, the <i>barrancas</i>, in the mountains
where horses cannot go."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he talked largely of doughty deeds; trying to
convey the impression of terrible slaughters and reprisals. Andy's
shrewdness and experience read between the lines. He began to be
slightly amused. These excursions to him took on more and more the
character of picnics. Andy was tough and hard from his ten years in
the trapping country. About the only hardship he could discover in
the situation was the necessity of wearing the many-plied
<i>cueros</i> of antelope skin&mdash;if it was a necessity. They
must be very hot. Sometimes the raiders managed to get clear away
with their booty. Then, it seemed, they did not ride the horses,
they ate them! This was the culminating grievance.</p>

<p>That was the present case. Don Sylvestre Cordero had been
relieved of a whole <i>manada</i> of breeding mares. The savages
had managed to confuse their trail and had wholly disappeared. It
developed that some of the mares belonged to Cortilla himself! So
he had pushed on in hope of vengeance, much farther to the north
than he had ever been before.</p>

<p>"I circle wide to cut the trail," he cried. "My men are expert
at tracking. Soon I shall meet with these <i>rota cabrones!</i> And
they shall learn that it is not well to affront Jesus Maria Corbedo
de Cortilla&mdash;and the Mexican government!" he added. "You
encountered no such people?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I met some Indians," said Andy carelessly, "but they were
not the people you are looking for. They were friendly. I don't
think, by the way they acted, they had ever seen a white man
before. They had no horses."</p>

<p>The young officer brooded darkly for a moment, then turned upon
Andy a countenance beaming with friendliness. Andy had listened
well, and it was evident that Jesus Maria had talked himself into a
liking for so respectful an audience. And he still had an eye on
the long rifle lying in apparent carelessness across the young
man's lap.</p>

<p>"As for this present difficulty," said he, "I should, as I said,
escort you to the capitol. But I am on other duty, and Jesus Maria
Corbedo de Cortilla never shrinks from duty. I will take your word.
You will ride to the Governor. You will report to him. You will say
that I have sent you, Thus all will be regular."</p>

<p>"I have never had other intention," said Andy simply</p>

<p>"<i>Bueno</i>!" cried the officer gayly. "Then, <i>señor</i>, we
shalt meet again. And know this, I, Jesus Maria Corbedo de
Cortilla, am an intimate of the new governor who comes, Figueroa.
We are like that," he laid his two forefingers side by side. "A
word in his ear, eh? We shall see!"</p>

<p>"Thanks, <i>señor</i>," said Andy. "<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>"</p>

<p>He mounted and drew aside to watch the little cavalcade pass.
The soldiers, he thought, were rather stupid looking, though they
sat their horses gracefully and well. They glanced at him sullenly
as they passed, lowered resentfully at their officer's sharp
command. They, too, wore the antelope skin <i>cuero de gamuza</i>
and the glazed flat hats. They too carried swords, but no pistols.
But they were armed further with long lances and short guns slung
under the leather skirts of their saddles, and swathed heavily in
fox skins, the tails dangling. It crossed Andy's mind that the
battle would be about over before they could bring these clumsy
smoothbores into action. As additional defense each bore a round
rawhide shield. These had been varnished and painted with the arms
of Mexico. They presented a very gay but not particularly warlike
appearance.</p>

<p>"I think, <i>señor</i>," Andy called after them, "that you will
do better to swing to the east. I saw no sign in the north."</p>

<p>The Mexican waved his hand gayly and rode on.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>ANDY too went his way. But not for very long. Within the half
mile an uneasiness overtook him. It was a mental&mdash;or rather a
psychic&mdash;condition with which past experience had made him
familiar. In externals and in most essentials Andy was a direct,
matter of fact, rather slow bit of efficiency, but he possessed
spiritual perceptions, antennas, which worked mysteriously below
his knowledges. Sometimes they helped him, as when they enabled him
to smell out hidden dangers; sometimes they disconcerted
him&mdash;as when they forced him too clearly to see the other
fellow's point of view. But he had learned never to ignore them. So
he reined in his horse and sat relaxed in his saddle, his eyes
roaming the surrounding prospect for sign of life, his inner ear
cocked for a whisper.</p>

<p>Then, unquestioning, he turned back on his trail. He did not yet
know why, but that was the thing to do. When an hour's travel had
returned him to the top of the butte-like hill where he had spent
the night, the reason was revealed.</p>

<p>From the elevation he could see ahead for a long distance over
the plain. About half a mile distant Andy saw Cortilla and his four
men gathered in a compact group. The lieutenant was holding out
something in his hand and apparently making a speech. In a moment
Andy saw why.</p>

<p>A dark head appeared above the grass, then another and another,
until a dozen were in sight. They were at some little distance from
the Mexicans. Cortilla was evidently trying to coax them nearer but
was having difficulty in doing so. They seemed shy, and at a sudden
movement of one of the horses dove out of sight like scattering
quail. But Cortilla persisted. Finally one of the savages, bolder
than the rest, perhaps the chief, plucked up courage enough to take
the object that Cortilla was offering. He examined it; others drew
near to look. Soon the Mexicans were surrounded by a dark crowd of
savages; as Andy had been surrounded the day before. Now, Andy
reflected, if Cortilla knows their language, he may get some
information. But as yet he did not know why he had come back. It
was none of his council.</p>

<p>But suddenly Cortilla arose in his stirrups. The sun caught a
flash of his sword as it leaped from his scabbard The bright
pennoned lances of the troopers dipped. The horses plunged, rearing
high, striking down viciously. The black mass of the savages held
for an instant's astonishment, then broke into flight. The dark
figures dove into the grass in all directions. A few stood,
apparently paralyzed with fear. Andy saw these pierced through by
the soldiers' lances. Then all five men, holding together in a
compact group, set their horses at speed through the high grass,
ranging like bird dogs, hunting down the fugitives, flushing them
from their concealments or overtaking them as they ran.</p>

<p>By this time Andy had reached the spot. He had started his horse
at a run down the hill the instant the purport of the scene had
penetrated his incredulity. He wasted no time, energy, nor speed in
trying to attract attention. The spare horse kicked up his heels
and raced joyously alongside and ahead. The pack horse, outraged at
this invasion of his privilege of laden sobriety, lumbered along
behind.</p>

<p>The Mexicans were mad with the excitement of the pursuit. They
yelled at one another exultantly, dashed headlong toward this point
and that where the agitation of the grasses revealed another
victim. Andy now shouted at them, but in vain. They must have been
aware of his approach. Probably they imagined he was joining them
to take part in this rare opportunity for a <i>matanza</i>, a
slaughter, where were no brush, no <i>barrancos</i>, no "mountains
where horses cannot go." Indeed, as he drew near, Cortilla waved at
him his blade and flashed at him a quick smile. At that instant an
Indian, about to be overridden in the shallow place of his
concealment, arose almost under the horses' feet to oppose his puny
bow in a last desperation. The arrow struck Cortilla's <i>cuero</i>
without effect, and the Indian fell, pierced by the lances. An old
woman, wailing, bent low, scuttling away. His rapier pointed,
Cortilla spurred forward his horse. At the same instant Andy stood
erect in his stirrups; his arm swept forward in a wide arc; his
long bladed knife whirled glittering through the air to bury itself
deep in the neck of the Mexican's horse. It was a chancy cast in
the circumstances; the long rifle would have been more certain for
the purpose; but Andy could not afford to empty his only weapon
this early. The stricken animal plunged forward and rolled over.
Cortilla hit the baked earth with a crash and lay still.</p>

<p>Andy whirled toward the astounded troopers.</p>

<p>"Rein back!" he commanded sharply. "I'll shoot the man who moves
a hand."</p>

<p>They stared at the cold fierce fire in his gray eyes and obeyed.
The affair was beyond their slow comprehension, but not the menace
of the long rifle.</p>

<p>Andy dismounted.</p>

<p>"Ride back," he repeated, "over there. And sit still."</p>

<p>They trotted away obediently. It was no longer their affair.
They were paid to fight Indians, who rarely fought back, not one of
these accursed Boston <i>rifleros</i>, rumors of whose deadliness
had seeped over the mountains, around by Santa Fe and Taos, even
into this remote and sleepy land. Especially a mad one. As for
Jesus Maria Corbedo de Cortilla, he had not endeared himself. So
they glanced at each other and shrugged and withdrew the required
distance, where they rolled cigarettes and rather curiously awaited
events. Curiously, and a little uneasily, for who knew what the
madman might do when he had finished with <i>el comandante</i>?</p>

<p>It certainly looked as though it were all up with <i>el
comandante</i>. The American had possessed himself of the officer's
sword and was standing over him, waiting for him to return to
consciousness.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>CORTILLA stirred, groaned, finally sat up. He was dazed, but
slowly recollection of events came to him. Andy waited; but his
eyes blazed with a cold fury that did not abate.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you miserable little murderer!" he growled in English
as Cortilla started to speak.</p>

<p>The naked sword in his hand, he advanced until he stood over the
still prostrate man. Cortilla shrank, looked about him wildly.</p>

<p>"To me! To me!" he shouted to his soldiers. "Help! Help! This
one murders me!"</p>

<p>The troopers stirred uneasily, but subsided as Andy turned
menacingly in their direction. The tall frontiersman thrust the
point of the weapon in the ground, stooped, and lifted the smaller
man bodily to his feet, putting into the action a half-restrained
strength that rattled Cortilla's teeth in his head. For several
seconds Andy stood thus holding him by the collar, deep furrows
between his eyes, staring at his squirming and bleating captive,
who was now certain his hour was come. Then suddenly he dropped the
long rifle, whirled the Mexican about, bent him half double, seized
the sword, and with the flat of it proceeded most heartily to spank
that worthy, to spank him with the full vigor of the fury that had
blazed in his eyes, spanked him until Jesus Maria Corbedo de
Cortilla howled like a schoolboy. It was ridiculous; it was
magnificent. Then, as suddenly, he hurled him aside, broke the
sword in two pieces, flung the pieces at Cortilla.</p>

<p>"<i>Vamos!</i>" he cried harshly: then, as Cortilla, completely
exhausted by the terrible beating, half stunned by the force of the
fall, failed to rise, he imperiously motioned the troopers to
approach. They hesitated uncertainly, but as Andy again held the
long rifle in his hands, they finally&mdash;and
gingerly&mdash;obeyed. Their faces were impassively noncommittal;
but, if Andy had been cool enough to observe the fact, they were
not wholly able to restrain a certain complacency beneath the
surface of their eyes. Provided this madman did not further
misbehave, provided that after all they themselves escaped from
this astounding episode with whole skins, it would be something
that they had seen Jesus Maria Corbedo de Cortilla spanked. The
sight had done much to sweeten the memory of past petty
disciplines. And already they were, beneath their grave and correct
exteriors, relishing in anticipation certain appreciations by
others in the <i>presidio</i>, others who also had memories of past
petty disciplines. Life was worth while, after all.</p>

<p>Possibly some such thought occurred to Cortilla also, and
sufficed to overcome his immediate fears. He was livid with
rage.</p>

<p>"You shall hear of this!" he shrieked. "You have insulted
Mexico, the Mexican Army! You shall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Vaya!</i>" Andy cut him short. "It is lucky for you I do not
kill. Silence!" he roared, "or I may forget that fact&mdash;and
there will not be any Mexican Army," he added with grim humor.</p>

<p>The last remark struck home with the troopers.</p>

<p>"Come, <i>señor</i> lieutenant," anxiously pleaded one of them,
dismounting. He held the stirrup urgently. Cortilla climbed into
the saddle, groaning and wincing.</p>

<p>"<i>Vamos!</i>" Andy repeated.</p>

<p>They rode away slowly. When at a considerable distance Cortilla
turned in his saddle to shriek imprecations and threats. Andy threw
forward the muzzle of his rifle. One of the soldiers leaned forward
to grasp the officer's reins. The horses broke into a shuffling
trot. They disappeared through the tall grasses, over the rise.</p>

<p>Andy dropped the butt of his long rifle to the ground, crossed
his elbows on it in his typical attitude. For some time he stared
into the distance; then roused himself with a sigh. Across the
deserts, across the ranges he had made his long and toilsome way,
escaping the blood and hatred of the gathering storm. He had not
escaped. Here too were hatred and bloodshed. All he wanted was to
live in peace, in peace to forget his sorrows, to heal his wounds.
There was no peace. He looked about him over the far-flung quietude
of the falling day. The sea of grasses bent in long parallel
rippling waves beneath the wind. Again the lines of waterfowl cut
the sky. But above him swung on slow majestic wing the vultures
waiting for him to go. Darkness was gathering over the Lovely Land.
The bells of San Gabriel, which had been sounding ever louder in
his ears, had suddenly been stricken faint and far away.</p>

<p>"Well," he addressed himself with a humorous acquiescent quirk
of the lips, "you've made a good start, Burnett."</p>

<p>He mounted, collected his other two animals; and rode on. But
now he headed southeast: toward the great valley and the
Sierra.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter II. Valedor</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>ANDY BURNETT was bitterly lonesome. This was not so much
physical as psychic. Andy was, in his trapper's life, quite
accustomed to being by himself. But always, even in the remotest
solitudes, the warmth of distant companions, to whose company the
mere matter of a journey would bring him, glowed as a reality
between himself and the chill. Now they were gone. Kelly alone
survived of those nearest to him; and Kelly had quit the mountains.
In this new land Andy had remembered <i>Padre</i> Sanchez, at the
Mission of San Gabriel, where, many years ago, when on an
expedition with Jedediah Smith, he had spent some months. After the
tragedies at Pierre's Hole had wiped out the last of his close
friends, the young trapper's mind had turned to a hoped-for peace
and healing within sound of the mission bells. And at the very
threshold of the new land he had fallen foul of its government.
More, he had so outraged the touchy pride of its representative
that the latter must make it his business to hunt the young man
down, if he could. Not only was Andy barred from the coast lands of
civilization; but he must, he knew, have become a sort of
outlaw.</p>

<p>That did not worry him. He knew he could maintain himself
indefinitely in the great interior valley and the foothills and
mountain parks of the Sierra, without the slightest danger of
detection by the Spanish. There were plenty of beaver, he
remembered: undoubtedly he could, in the proper season, make up a
few packs. He could take them up into Oregon, to the Hudson's Bay
post there. Jed Smith had spoken highly of the factor McLaughlin,
known as the White Eagle. The fact that that meant near a thousand
miles of unknown rough travel through known hostile tribes did not
bother him. But Andy was still a mountain man, with the mountain
man's strong prejudices and partisanships, He would as soon work
for the Hudson's Bay Company as for Astor and the American Fur
Company&mdash;just about as soon. Still, sooner or later, he would
have to get fresh ammunition and supplies somewhere. An alternative
was to return the way he had come. His whole being turned over in
revulsion at the thought. That phase of his life was definitely
finished, closed by the searing red hand of massacre. Riding thus,
moodily, in a fog of apathy that blotted out the healing beauties
thronging on every side to his assuagement, he was, when on the
fourth day he encountered three horsemen, almost too indifferent to
take the obvious precautions. Almost, but not quite. Long habit
nudged him. So he rode directly at them, and brought his horse to a
stop at an appropriate distance, and looked them over coolly and
appraisingly.</p>

<p>They were unarmed, except that the leader wore a light slim
rapier. Obviously not of the military. That, to Andy, was about the
only obvious thing about them. Nothing in their appearance or their
equipment, as far as he could see, suggested their
business&mdash;if they had any. His contempt, the contempt of the
mountain man for "foofaraw"&mdash;unless it might be his own kind
of foofaraw&mdash;added to his recently acquired misliking of the
race. His figure relaxed in his saddle, though his eye did not lose
its wariness, nor did his right hand leave the trigger guard of the
long rifle that crossed his saddle before him. No detail escaped
the appraisal of his eye, practised in the appraisal of details.
And of what he saw he liked nothing. Except the horses. He
grudgingly admitted to himself that the horses were fine animals,
especially that ridden by the young man with the rapier. It was a
spirited-looking beast, a light buckskin in color; but unlike any
buckskin Andy had ever seen. The buckskins of the plains had black
manes and tails, and a black stripe down the backbone. This one had
no such stripe, and its mane and tail, which were long and silky
and slightly waved, were of shining silver. Its legs were slender;
its hoofs small; its nervously pricking ears fine; its lustrous
eyes wide apart; in its distended nostrils the quick blood showed
rose. It stepped with a dainty springing touch of the ground,
holding its head high, its smooth muscles quivering with a speed
eager for release; and yet it moved perfectly in control. Its rider
had raised his hand, and it stood, immobile as a statue except for
the alert movement forward and back, forward and back, of its ears,
and the slow, musical champing of the rollers of its bit.</p>

<p>Nor, though the animals' trappings smacked decidedly of
foofaraw, did Andy withhold his admiration from them. Your
wilderness horseman, whatever he may be, whether trapper,
plainsman, or cowboy, has always lavished on his mount the love of
decoration he stoutly denies to himself. The wide side plates of
the bit were inlaid with carved silver; the bridle was of braided
rawhide starred with silver <i>conchas</i>. The rawhide reins were
tufted along their length with brightly colored tassels of
horsehair, and were joined together at the end in a long whip-like
<i>morale</i>. Nor was the saddle less gay. Its tree carried a low
horn whose top was as broad as a saucer. Over the tree was an
all-enveloping apron-like leather, extending forward and back and
down the sides, the <i>mochila</i>, the business-foundation of the
structure. Over this was another covering, the <i>coraza</i>, also
of leather, elaborately ornamented with delicate and graceful
carvings in conventional patterns of leaves and flowers,
elaborately embroidered with colored silks, with silver, and with
gold. Across the front of the saddle a folded <i>poncho</i>. Behind
it a sort of second seat, or pillion, the <i>arqueta</i> shaped
like a half moon, also of leather, lined with fleece. Silver
<i>conchas</i> held each juncture. The stirrups were hooded with
carved leather that extended below in two long flapping points
almost to the ground, the <i>tapaderos</i>, Only later, of course,
did Andy learn the names for these things; but now he saw them all
and admired and approved. A coiled rawhide reata, smooth and oiled
and supple, hung at the saddle-bow.</p>

<p>That is as far as his approval ran. The rider was much, oh, much
too foofaraw. Though tall and muscular, he was altogether too
handsome, with his clear olive complexion, his tiny moustache, his
long-lashed black eyes, his too-red lips, and the affected streak
of whisker that extended from his temples to end at the corners of
his lips. The mocking smiling animation of his face was too
animated, too changeable, too frivolous for Andy, accustomed to the
self-contained Indian stolidity of the mountain men.</p>

<p>But the height of silly foofaraw, as Andy saw it then, was the
way the man had rigged himself out. The creature wore a stiff
low-crowned hat tied under his chin, with a tasseled band about it
of braided gold and silver set with green stones. Under it was tied
a bright kerchief to cover his hair, which hung down his back in a
short queue, like a woman's or an Indian's. He had a short
collarless jacket trimmed with red, so scant its edges did not meet
in front, although it sported two crowded rows of gold buttons. The
man's shirt was frilled. He had wound about his waist a broad red
sash, the ends of which hung down his left side. He had on
close-fitting knee breeches the bottoms of which were fringed with
gold. He wore bright embroidered garters! His boots were of soft
leather and were of two colors, yellow and brown. On his heels two
pieces of fringed leather supported his silvered spurs, which were
enormous, with rowels two inches or more in diameter, and tiny
bells against the rowels, and silver chains hanging under the arch
of the foot, that jingled musically with every movement. Andy's
nostrils widened with abysmal disdain.</p>

<p>And just to make it complete this&mdash;this
<i>popinjay</i>&mdash;carried on his back, held in place by a broad
ribbon, a guitar!</p>

<p>The other two were stolid-faced men, slightly older in years.
Their equipment was much the same, except that it was less
ornamental, less elaborate, more worn than that of their companion.
To a bystander, had there been one, the two groups would have
presented an interesting contrast: the tall frontiersman in his
worn buckskins, his head bound in a simple bandanna handkerchief,
his long rifle across his saddle, bestriding one wiry Indian pony,
the other two cropping soberly alongside; and the gayly caparisoned
Californians.</p>

<p>The younger man was the first to flash a gay greeting, which
Andy barely acknowledged. He was decidedly off the Latin races.
Then the stranger, unabashed, wheeled his horse alongside.</p>

<p>"You come from a long way, <i>señor</i>!" he suggested; Andy
grunted assent; then, as the fact belatedly reached his
consciousness, he was startled out of his withdrawal. "Where did
you learn to speak English?" he demanded bluntly.</p>

<p>"I espeak it well, eh?" acknowledged the young man. "Why not? I
am educate in United States. I think," he added with a laugh, "my
family he get tired keeping track of me and send me away to get rid
of me. Nevare have I been very popular with my family. Sad,
eh?"</p>

<p>Andy grunted. He offered no encouragement to this volatile
stranger. Apparently he did not even glance in his direction.
Nevertheless, he saw and registered every movement made, not only
by his undesired companion, but also by the other two. Andy felt
quite competent to take care of himself with double this number of
fancy-plumaged jayhawks, but he did not intend to be caught
unaware.</p>

<p>The principal jayhawk chattered more like a magpie than a
jayhawk, which added to Andy's contempt. The stranger spoke very
good English. Indeed, a broad doubling of the initial S and an
occasional inversion of phrase were his chief idiosyncrasies of
speech. He told a few unessentials about himself; he commented
superfluously on the weather and the surrounding country; he
questioned Andy adroitly but without response. Andy had no use for
this company and took no pains to conceal that fact. Every few
moments the young Californian turned in his saddle to address in
Spanish the two <i>vaqueros</i> who followed twenty yards or so
behind. These remarks Andy listened to idly, though his impassive
face gave no sign that he understood. But soon his attention was
more closely enlisted.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Panchito?" said the leader. "Could there be
two like him?"</p>

<p>"He is undoubtedly the man of whom we have heard, Don
Ramón."</p>

<p>The Californian glanced at Andy as though to refresh an
impression.</p>

<p>"He has not to me the air of one so desperate. Though," he added
with a curl of the lip, "he is an unmannerly pig, surly as a
bear."</p>

<p>"<i>Gracias</i>," interposed Andy dryly.</p>

<p>Ramón reined in his horse so abruptly that the animal threw its
head high. His eyes were dark and flashing with anger, but the
suavity of his manner did not alter.</p>

<p>"Ah, you espeak Spanish, <i>señor</i>," he said in that tongue.
"I do not find it courteous that you have concealed that fact! It
savors of the spy."</p>

<p>Andy laughed shortly. His contempt and indifference to the
other's opinion were as obvious as the lash of a whip. The young
Californian's eyes widened slightly, but it was the man Panchito
who snarled in anger.</p>

<p>"Shall we take him in, Don Ramón? This is an order to all loyal
men&mdash;and a reward."</p>

<p>The long rifle seemed of its own accord to leap from Andy's
saddlebow to point its muzzle not two feet from the Californian's
chest.</p>

<p>"I could kill you," he said after a moment. "I'd as soon kill
you as any of your cowardly kind. But killing is useless." He
slowly dropped the muzzle of his rifle. "I think you'd best ride
your way."</p>

<p>At that instant, swift as the dart of a snake, wham!
<i>slap!</i> with such tremendous force as almost to shake him from
his saddle, a loop of slender heavy rawhide pinioned his arms to
his sides, and wham! <i>slap!</i> another encircled his neck. Such
were the speed and the force of the shock that the long rifle was
jarred from his grasp.</p>

<p>So unexpectedly and swiftly did these things happen that for a
moment Andy was completely confused, but only for a moment. His
mind instantly steadied to complete acceptance of the
situation.</p>

<p>"This is the end of Andy Burnett," he thought. He even found in
a corner of his mind space for admiration at the speed and
dexterity of the maneuver. The men were a full fifty feet distant;
they had snatched the reatas from their saddle horns, had run their
loops, had cast them before even the mountain man's customary quick
reactions had responded. He found another small space for
mortification that he should have been caught thus unaware, and a
counter comforting reflection that it was only his complete
ignorance of this new type of deadly weapon that had betrayed
him.</p>

<p>He sat quiet, without attempt at struggle. The <i>vaqueros</i>
had taken each a turn about his pommel, had turned their horses
half away, had poised their spurs. Their eyes were fixed
inquiringly upon their master.</p>

<p>The latter touched his own mount with the spur to edge it
daintily close to Andy's own.</p>

<p>"What say you now, <i>señor</i>?" he inquired softly in Spanish.
"I but raise my hand&mdash;and my men are off and away, like the
wind. And you? What of you? It is not a pleasant death,
<i>señor</i>. One lives to feel the earth clutching at one's body
with fingers of iron, tearing the flesh from the bones, until at
last it has torn down through the flesh to the life. Eh,
<i>señor</i>, what say you to that?"</p>

<p>His face was close, his dancing black eyes searching the depths
of Andy's for the effects of his words. Andy stared steadily back
at him.</p>

<p>"What do you say, <i>señor</i>?" insisted the other.</p>

<p>"Raise your hand," replied Andy quietly.</p>

<p>"<i>Caramba!</i>" cried the Californian. "You at least are no
coward!"</p>

<p>He signaled to the <i>vaqueros</i>; then, as they hesitated in
reluctance, more imperiously. They rode forward grumbling, loosened
the loops, released Andy from the nooses, and re-coiled the reatas
at their saddlebows. Without dismounting, the young man swooped
gracefully down from his saddle, retrieved the long rifle from the
ground, returned it to the frontiersman with a half-mocking
bow.</p>

<p>"You could have killed me, <i>señor</i>," said he. "You did not.
I could have killed you. I did not. We are quits. And now, again,
let us ride together for better acquaintance."</p>

<p>He wheeled his horse, slapped Andy's mount lightly to put it in
motion.</p>

<p>"You are no coward, <i>señor</i>," he repeated. "You called me
one&mdash;will you be gracious enough to tell me why?"</p>

<p>Andy was confused and just a little shamed. His pride of a
mountain man was still sore at having been so flagrantly caught
unaware. He hesitated, then bluntly blurted out the truth. He told
of the harmless wild savages he had met in the upper valley, of
their mystifying dumb friendliness, of his meeting with Cortilla,
the lieutenant, and his four soldiers hunting horse thieves, of
Cortilla's unprovoked attack on the savages and the subsequent
massacre.</p>

<p>"It was a cowardly outrage, <i>señor</i>," he stated stoutly.
"These people were practically unarmed, they were friendly,
unsuspicious. They killed children, old women. These men were
cowards. They were your countrymen."</p>

<p>The young man listened attentively, without speaking, up to this
point.</p>

<p>"So you concluded I too am a coward," he commented dryly.</p>

<p>"My mind was sore, my heart was on the ground."</p>

<p>Andy voiced the quaint phrase of his Indian affiliations in half
apology.</p>

<p>Don Ramón reflected. "<i>Basta</i>," said he at last. "Partly I
comprehend; though these Indians are animals and must be made to
fear. But, <i>señor</i>, those others were not my countrymen: they
were Mexicans. They are of <i>la otra banda</i>."</p>

<p>"I do not understand." Andy was puzzled. "Are not you?"</p>

<p>"I, a Mexican!" Ramón drew back proudly. "The saints forbid! I
am <i>californio</i>! But go on."</p>

<p>Andy told, diffidently now, of his interposition, of how, single
handed, he had stopped the massacre, and finally of how he had
spanked Cortilla with his own sword.</p>

<p>Ramón listened with interest, with growing amusement.</p>

<p>At the farcical denouement he gave vent to his feelings in a
great shout of delight.</p>

<p>"But, listen, Panchito, José," he summoned the <i>vaqueros</i>
to his side, "the great Cortilla! With his own sword! Did you hear
what this <i>señor</i> has related?"</p>

<p>The men's grave faces broke to a sardonic relish. Andy felt the
warmth of a complete approval. He did not understand it wholly as
yet, but it was grateful to the loneliness of his soul. In spite of
himself a liking began to creep into his heart for these strange
companions, a liking illogical, against all his sober Anglo-Saxon
prejudices, but genuine.</p>

<p>"With his own sword! The great Cortilla!" the Californian
repeated. "Oh, <i>corazón de mi alma</i>, I could love you for
this!"</p>

<p>He swung the guitar to his hands, dropped his reins, struck
sweetly its chords, and in a melodious tenor began to sing some
obviously improvised doggerel celebrating in mock heroics this
extraordinary feat of arms. His horse, unguided, paced stately as a
parade. Andy rode soberly alongside. Under the unbelievable blue of
the California sky, with the brown plains about him bordered by
mountains that somehow looked as fragile as pasteboard, with wide
oaks spaced as though planted, with this bizarre, brilliant retinue
in its bright trappings, led by the troubadour with the guitar, he
seemed to himself to have entered somehow a realm of unreality, to
have been lifted body and soul from the stark harshness of his old
life.</p>

<p>Softly and mysteriously he experienced the relief of the man
who, long submerged, bursts at last above the water's surface to
fill his choking lungs with the thin, sweet air of life.</p>

<p>Ramón suddenly ceased his song and swung aside the guitar.</p>

<p>"<i>Valedor mío</i>!" he cried.</p>

<p><i>Valedor</i>, Andy searched in his memory for the word.</p>

<p>It came to him at last. Friend: nay, more than, merely friend,
one especially trusted, one near to the heart.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>"DON RAMÓN!" cried one of the <i>vaqueros</i> suddenly.</p>

<p>Andy had already seen the object of his attention, a lumbering
grizzly bear, prowling out in the open, a hundred yards or so from
a dense willow thicket in a <i>barranca</i>. He paid it no
attention. He had seen plenty of "white bears" in his time and
rarely bothered them.</p>

<p>"Now you shall see esport!" cried Ramón. "<i>Holá!</i>"</p>

<p>The three Californians struck spurs to their horses and dashed
away at a speed more rapid than Andy's smaller and travel-wearied
animals could equal. He arrived on the scene to find the bear
already bayed-up, its ruff erect, its eyes blazing and badgered,
its great head, with its bared, snarling teeth, swinging to and fro
following the movements of the dancing horses that circled slowly
about it at the distance of twenty yards or less. The horses were
wild with fear, or perhaps merely with excitement, but were held to
the task in a control of perfect horsemanship. Each man had the
coil of his reata in his left hand, with his reins, and from his
right dangled the loop.</p>

<p>Andy, riding up, made a motion to dismount for a standing shot.
He had no enthusiasm for the affair, but supposed it expected of
him, and so prepared to do his best. The bear was a large one and
already very angry. Andy had no tree into which to spring while
awaiting the effect of a heart shot. The bullet was too likely to
glance from the sloping skull. He resolved to try for the
difficult, but instantly fatal, eye shot. It did not occur to him
for a moment that he was invited only as spectator; that these men
intended to capture and to kill this largest and fiercest, of
America's wild animals with no other weapons than the slender oiled
rawhide reatas. If he had understood that, he would have considered
it a harebrained reckless bit of bravado; doomed, if carried
through, to possibly a fatal, certainly a disastrous ending. And if
anyone had told him, as was the truth, that in protection of the
cattle such men as now accompanied him, with no other weapon, made
it a regular business to hunt and to kill just such bears as the
one now confronting them, he would have dismissed the statement as
merely another tall story for greenhorn consumption.</p>

<p>"No! no-no-no!" cried Ramón. "Do not get down. You shall
see!"</p>

<p>He apparently was struck with a new idea, so suddenly that under
the impulse of it he brought his horse to a full stand. The bear
roared and charged at this stationary target.</p>

<p>"<i>Señor</i>!"</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried Andy and the others.</p>

<p>Ramón danced his horse aside in a quick falcon swoop.</p>

<p>The <i>vaqueros</i> shouted, circling in opposite directions.
The bear, confused, stopped again, growling in his throat. Ramón
was laughing.</p>

<p>"You have said me a coward, <i>señor</i>," he called gayly to
Andy.</p>

<p>He stooped to disengage his spurs, which he tossed toward the
bear; then in a sudden movement he vaulted clear of his saddle,
landing lightly on his feet. He slapped his horse, the beautiful
<i>palomino</i>, on the flank, and it trotted away. His rapier was
bared in his right hand, his broadcloth <i>poncho</i> with its
frivolous filigree silver embroidery trailed from his left.</p>

<p>"<i>Madre de Dios, Don Ramón!</i>" cried Panchito, raising the
loop of his reata. José pressed forward. "Don't be a damn fool!"
growled Andy, cocking his rifle.</p>

<p>"Stand back, it is a command!" cried Ramón sharply, "&mdash;and
you, <i>Señor</i>, I beseech it."</p>

<p>He advanced with mincing steps toward the bear. The animal,
nonplussed at this strange <i>démarche</i>, closed its jaws, half
rose on its hind legs, pricked forward its ears, peered through its
little eyes at this strange unknown creature advancing so
confidently. When at ten feet of distance, Ramón stopped, brought
his heels together, raised his rapier in the fencer's salute.</p>

<p>The bear was puzzled, even for the moment a little alarmed. The
unknown is always alarming, to both beast and human. The animal
knew four-legged but not two-legged creatures. It is possible that
his next reaction might have been one of retreat, were retreat
permitted by the horsemen; but before he could focus his slow mind
the man had sprung forward. The rapier blade darted twice, swift as
a snake's tongue, pricking each of the bear's fore paws. With
almost the same motion Ramón leaped back to resume his graceful
fencer's pose of <i>en garde</i>.</p>

<p>With a roar the great beast charged. Ramón sprang lightly to one
side; brushed the <i>poncho</i> across the bear's face; thrusting
again with the rapier, this time at the bear's chest. His sense of
direction momentarily confused, the bear stopped, shook its head,
roared, looked about for its elusive antagonist; charged again. And
again Ramón evaded the rush by a twist of the body, a cast of the
cloak, and again the rapier flashed in and out.</p>

<p>"Hah! <i>Oso!</i>" he shouted.</p>

<p>The bear was thoroughly aroused. It was overwhelming, the menace
of such fury and such power. Its eyes blazed, its jaws slavered,
its great body seemed to expand. A terrible expectation charged the
atmosphere as of the gathering of resistless force, like the power
of a hurricane. Panchito and José leaned forward against their
pommels, their brows knit, muttering to one another, shaking their
heads. The horses snorted and trembled, held only by the rigid
discipline of their riders' firm and accustomed hands. Andy's mount
was not so amenable. It plunged and bored at the bit. He had as
much as he could do to control it at all.</p>

<p>The strange combat quickened. The bear's rushes were shorter,
more purposeful. It struck savagely with its great paws at the
maddening, confusing <i>poncho</i>, trying to tear it aside that it
might more clearly reach his antagonist. Only by the most
astonishing agility did Ramón continue to escape. But escape he
did, though sometimes by so close a margin as to elicit from the
<i>vaqueros</i> a sharp involuntary cry of warning or alarm. And
never did the rapier fail to dart in and out like a flash of light.
The foam on the bear's jaws was now flecked with blood; and blood
trickled over its shaggy hide from a dozen wounds. Nevertheless, it
seemed to be as strong and as fast as ever.</p>

<p>With a curse at his fractious animal Andy leaped from his
saddle. He was wrought to a high and unusual pitch of excitement.
The thing was absurd, senseless, mad. Andy was too experienced a
frontiersman to be carried away by the mere excitement of a
situation, to be raised above its calculations and appraisals by
the exultations of mere glory. The terrain was rough, and a slip or
a stumble would disconcert Ramón's close avoidances. The bear,
though wounded, was apparently unchecked and was gathering fury and
adroitness as the combat proceeded. Thrice had Ramón saved himself
by an apparent miracle. Andy watched his chance until for a split
second the bear paused motionless, then delivered his shot with all
the speed and iron concentration of his long experience; and also,
be it confessed; with a fervent outrush of petition from his heart.
It was a good shot; a wonderful shot; and also, Andy realized with
deep thankfulness, a lucky shot. The bullet entered the animal's
eye, so accurately that afterwards it was found it had not touched
the eyelids.</p>

<p>The bear rolled over, pierced to the brain.</p>

<p>The <i>vaqueros</i> uttered a deep groan of relief. Panchito
expelled his breath loudly. Ramón wiped his blade on a tuft of
grass and turned reproachfully to the mountain man.</p>

<p>"That I do not take kindly, <i>señor</i>," said he softly. Andy
grunted obstinately, reloading his piece. Ramón surveyed the huge
carcass.</p>

<p>"This, <i>señor</i>, was a personal duel, you comprehend, a
personal duel with a grand antagonist. Shortly I would have touched
the heart." He shook his head. "Never have I known one to kill a
bear with a sword, <i>como el toro</i>."</p>

<p>"But I have known the bear to kill the man, <i>como el
aturdido</i>," said Andy dryly.</p>

<p>"You call me harebrained, <i>señor</i>?" demanded Ramón, rearing
his head.</p>

<p>"Well, aren't you?" demanded Andy in his turn, but with an
engaging smile.</p>

<p>"Si, <i>señor</i>!" approved Panchito fervently.</p>

<p>Ramón turned to stare at his henchman, But Panchito refused to
be subdued.</p>

<p>"<i>El extranjero</i> is right, Don Ramón," he insisted, "and to
that the holy saints are witness."</p>

<p>"I should have won the fight," insisted the young Californian to
Andy.</p>

<p>"May be, <i>señor</i>," returned Andy unmoved, "but your men
were doing nothing to help, and I will never stand by and see a
brave man so uselessly in such danger."</p>

<p>"Hah! a brave man," Ramón caught him up. "Then I am no longer a
coward, eh? You say that? It is all I seek." He touched the bear
with the toe of his <i>bota</i>. "As for Panchito and José, you
must not despise them. They are my men: they obey me to the
death."</p>

<p>"So I perceive," returned Andy dryly, "&mdash;even to your
death," he added.</p>

<p>Ramón threw back his head and laughed long and joyously. He
reverted to English. Indeed, it is henceforth to be understood that
both young men used now one language, now the other, as seemed to
fit the subject or their mood.</p>

<p>"It is good to laugh," he said presently. "I am delight to see
<i>la burla</i>&mdash;what you say, the joke&mdash;beneath that
face of yours so <i>serio</i>," He examined the bear with a growing
wonder, touching the wound made by the bullet, parting the unmarked
eyelids. "That was a miracle of shooting, <i>amigo</i>."</p>

<p>"Luck," replied Andy briefly.</p>

<p>"That I do not believe. Hah! you shall prove that."</p>

<p>He looked about him over the brown side hill. Halfway up to its
crest, near a scattered grove of live oaks, the earth had been
thrown into a multitude of scattered mounds by a colony of
squirrels. Here and there the little animals, driven below ground
by the turmoil of the combat, were beginning to emerge. One sat
atop its hillock, erect, its paws folded across its chest,
shrieking indignantly.</p>

<p>"Think you, you can hit me that beast?" inquired Ramón.</p>

<p>Andy estimated the distance.</p>

<p>"Why, I think so, <i>señor</i>," said he.</p>

<p>The <i>vaqueros</i> murmured incredulously; and even Ramón
permitted himself a skeptical smile which he instantly and politely
erased.</p>

<p>"You doubt, <i>señor</i>," said Andy, aroused. "See, I will do
better. I will clip you the top of his head."</p>

<p>To the long-practised marksman armed with the long rifle the
shot was not very difficult; but the Californians were unaccustomed
to firearms and acquainted only with the clumsy smooth-bore
<i>escopeta</i>, capable at that distance of about a two- or
three-foot group. The proposal seemed preposterous. They watched
Andy take his deliberate stance with the breathless interest of
children; and when he fulfilled his promise they exclaimed with so
generous an admiration that, in spite of himself, a new spirit of
happy, almost boyish satisfaction welled up in his heart.</p>

<p>"I should not care to have you shoot at me, <i>amigo</i>," said
Ramón. "If ever it were my misfortune to fight against you, I would
much prefer to entertain you at close quarters." He touched the
hilt of his rapier. "And this." He laid his hand on the coiled
reata at his saddle-bow.</p>

<p>In tacit answer Andy produced his other deadly trick.</p>

<p>That is to say, he unsheathed his knife and with it made one of
the marvelously accurate casts for which, in the mountain country,
he had been famous; sinking its point deep in the center of the
target of his selection, a lichen mark on one of the live oak
trees. And instantly he was ashamed of this braggadocio, this
display of foofaraw. It was exactly like a small boy showing off,
Andy thought. So when all three of the Californians expressed a
genuine wonder and admiration at the feat his manner became in
reaction gruff and repellent. Nevertheless, deep down within him
was a lifting satisfaction that refused to be abashed, a lightness
of irresponsibility that he had never experienced. You see boyhood
had been denied him, and in this warm and friendly atmosphere it
was coming naturally into a belated burgeoning.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>THEY rode on again. Whether from fatigue or reaction, Don
Ramón's ebullient spirits had dropped. For some time he said
nothing; nor did it occur to Andy's mountain taciturnity to break
silence. Finally Ramón aroused himself with a laugh.</p>

<p>"We ride like friars telling our beads!" said he. He turned to
Andy with engaging frankness. "Do you know, Don Largo," he said,
conferring on Andy his nickname, "I will tell you truth. I am sulk
like a child, because why? Because you have show me what you can do
and I cannot do these things. And I have not show you what I can
do. Is not that a foolish?"</p>

<p>"I think you've shown me considerable," Andy assured him
sincerely.</p>

<p>"Ah, that!" Ramón shrugged sadly, "but you say yourself that is
harebrain." He laughed at himself, but it was evident that his mood
was genuine, for small boys strange to one another must show off.
It is a necessity to making acquaintance; and obviously, for the
moment at least, these two had somehow slipped back to the magic of
that age. Andy had showed off last; now it was Ramón's turn, and
there was nothing to show off on.</p>

<p>As yet the two, though they had divined a natural affinity, knew
practically nothing of each other's circumstances. Outward details
had not yet assumed enough importance to have become the subject of
curiosity. That would come when the fundamentals had been properly
finished off.</p>

<p>For some time now the plain of the great valley had been
gradually dropping away to the left. The broken country encompassed
them. They were traveling along a winding dry watercourse from
which arose to right and left low hills, soft and round like the
flanks of brown beasts. On their slopes, scattered widely, grazed a
sprinkling of cattle. They were wild-looking creatures, with long
horns and staring eyes, and the nearest of them ran like deer at
sight of the horsemen. José and Panchito looked them over with
professional attention, commenting to one another low toned.
Ramón's eye lighted and he began to hum under his breath.</p>

<p>At this point the hill on one side had drawn too near the
watercourse and had, in consequence, been sheared away by flood and
wind until it stood over them as a cliff, or rather as a slide of
loose deep shale but little off the perpendicular. On its top stood
a lordly bull looking down at them, secure in his scorn of
inaccessibility.</p>

<p>"Hah!" said Ramón. "Stop here, and you shall see some
esport."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now?" demanded Andy uneasily. He was
beginning to distrust that word. What next? Was Ramón going to
tackle also this beast with his sword? But Ramón negatived that
idea by unfastening the weapon, which, with the guitar, he thrust
into Andy's hands.</p>

<p>"Guard these for me," he cried, struck spurs to the
<i>palomino</i>, and dashed away out of sight around the curve of
the hill's base.</p>

<p>"What will he do now?" Andy turned a troubled face to the
<i>vaqueros</i>. They smiled at him reassuringly.</p>

<p>"That you shall see, <i>señor: Paciencia</i>," returned
Panchito.</p>

<p>The bull continued to stare fixedly down on the three horsemen
below him. He was curious, and quite serene on his elevation. Once
his attention seemed about to wander, but José whistled, both
<i>vaqueros</i> moved their horses sharply, and it was
recalled.</p>

<p>Suddenly the quiet air was rent by a wild yell. Ramón appeared,
riding straight as a thunderbolt at the startled animal. The bull,
bewildered and frightened out of his wits, leaped straight forward
and over the edge, caught his footing, and half fell, half wallowed
down the precipitous shale. Without hesitation the <i>palomino</i>
leaped after him. It seemed that nothing could save him from
rolling over and over, his rider with him, to the foot of the
precipitous slope. But in midair the <i>palomino</i> gathered its
four hoofs together, sank back on its haunches. It struck the
precipice at exactly the angle of the slope, plunged ten feet with
stiffened legs, its head high, its rump fairly seated against the
rattling shale. At the same instant Ramón's reata hissed through
the air to encircle a hind leg of the staggering bull. Ramón threw
up his arm to tighten the loop. The bull fell, rolled over and
over, entangling itself, gathering speed and momentum in a fearful
tumble down the precipitous incline. And Ramón and the
<i>palomino</i> followed, the man coolly hauling in and paying out
the reata as occasion demanded, the horse, alert in every fiber,
even to his small quivering ears, following in a series of short
buck plunges, a marvel of grace and equilibrium.</p>

<p>The bull, now bawling with fear and anger, rolled out on the
flat ground in a cloud of dust and a rattle of loose stones. Before
he could scramble to his feet the reata was wrapped about the wide
pommel; the <i>palomino</i>, unguided, was backing away, holding
the slack. Ramón held up both hands. Andy, shaken from his
customary gravity, stood up in his stirrups and cheered.</p>

<p>After a moment Ramón spoke to his mount. The horse stepped
forward. Ramón flipped the slackened loop free. The bull staggered
to its feet and dashed away, thoroughly chastened. Ramón trotted
back to his companions, gathering in the coils. His handsome face
was alight.</p>

<p>"You like?" he asked.</p>

<p>Andy expressed his enthusiasm. Ramón glowed with satisfaction.
Everybody was happy. The small boys were quits at showing off. They
could now get acquainted.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>THIS they proceeded to do. Ramón reminded Andy of the
necessity.</p>

<p>"I say, long time ago, that we ride together for better
acquaintance," said he. "It is time. Do you know, <i>amigo</i>,
that it is foolish, but I do not even know your name."</p>

<p>"Andrew Burnett," supplied Andy.</p>

<p>"Andr-rew Burnett." The Californian savored this. "Don Andres.
But still I think you are Don Largo&mdash;the tall one. Me, I am
Ramón Rivera, to serve you. I have still other names, but they do
not matter. And now, Don Largo, you must tell me where you
ride."</p>

<p>Andy shook his head.</p>

<p>"I do not know, Don Ramón," he confessed; "I had thought to go
to San Gabriel&mdash;to the mission." He hesitated, unable in a
momentary return of his old controlled
taciturnity&mdash;immediately to bestow entire confidence. Then he
met Ramón's eyes fixed on his. "I wanted to rest," he said
finally.</p>

<p>"Ah," the Californian's voice was low and understanding, "you
have sorrow, <i>amigo</i>. Tell me."</p>

<p>And, to his own great surprise, Andy obeyed. He found himself
talking, talking freely to this stranger of only a few hours ago,
telling him of the old life beyond the mountains, of the Blackfeet,
of Kiasax his Indian friend, and of Nit-o-ke-man and the Little
Warrior, of Joe Crane and Flying Woman, and finally of Joe's murder
and the great battle and massacre that had taken from him the last
of his friends. He poured it all out in a torrent of long-pent
feeling, and Ramón listened, his head bent, holding the
proud-stepping <i>palomino</i> to the slower pace of the Indian
pony. And abruptly the iron hand of his mountain taciturnity fell
across his speech. He stopped.</p>

<p>"Now I understand&mdash;Cortilla," Ramón nodded slowly. "And
that I did not understand before. <i>Pobre amigo</i>."</p>

<p>At the tone of the young man's voice Andy's eyes filled with
tears. Instantly he brushed them away angrily, with an up rush of
contempt at himself. Was he a woman or a child?</p>

<p>"I had intended," he said in a hard and matter-of-fact voice,
"to live here. But now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now you would be more like to live in the <i>cuartel</i>, at
San Blas." Ramón laughed mockingly, quick to understand his
companion's reaction of mood. "I do not think Cortilla and his
Mexican friends would welcome you with open arms as a
<i>californio</i>. And our governors are from Mexico, you
understand. Some day we shall change that," he added.</p>

<p>"I know that. So I go to the Sierra. After that, I do not
know."</p>

<p>"That we shall see," said Ramón, "but for now there is no haste.
One of the <i>ranchos</i> of my family lies over the hills but a
few leagues from here. It is not much. Nobody but a Rivera would
have it at all, for it is far from the <i>presidios</i> and the
<i>gente de razon</i>, and very near the wild country and <i>los
Indios</i>. I think the Indians steal from it as many horses and
more cattle than we keep. Is it not so, Panchito?"</p>

<p>"Si, <i>señor</i>," agreed the <i>vaquero</i>.</p>

<p>"It is of little worth. I think my family keeps it for two
reasons, both of them excellent, however. The one is that others
are afraid to keep it, and the Riveras have always had a foolish
idea to do what others fear. That is one reason."</p>

<p>"And the other?" asked Andy, to end the pause.</p>

<p>Ramón threw back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>"The other? Why, I think the other is that they wish a place of
a certain remoteness to which to banish their dear son, Ramón
Julian Antonio de Quadra y Rivera, when from him, as at present,
they withhold entire confidence. And now," he added, "you have
heard all my names."</p>

<p>He glanced mischievously at Andy.</p>

<p>"I will tell you my story," he offered. "You are curious: that I
see!"</p>

<p>Andy, embarrassed, muttered a disclaimer.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not painful, I assure you!" cried Ramón. "Except, of
course, to my excellent family. Know, then, that I am conspirator,
traitor to my people! Yes, it is so, listen. I have fought against
them, been in great battles. It was last year. Mexico sent us a new
governor. They always send us new governors. What do Mexicans know
of Californians? Always we try to get them to appoint a
Californian. They will not do so. Me, I think it does not matter
that!" He snapped his fingers. "They live at Monterey; they talk.
The <i>rancheros</i> know nothing of them."</p>

<p>"This new governor is name Victoria. He is a soldier, and he
gives orders. The California people do not like orders. He gives
high offices to Mexicans and small offices to Californians. He puts
young silly ones, like Cortilla, in command, and makes old
Californians, whose beards have grown gray, to serve under them. He
sends some people he does not like to San Blas. Me, I think perhaps
most of them better at San Blas. A lot of people do not like him.
Hear them talk, you think him an ogre with two tails. José Carillo,
Juan Bandini, Pio Pico. They make a war against him down south.
They think they put back the old governor, Echeandia."</p>

<p>"Is Echeandia a Californian?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"No; that is the joke. He is Mexican, too. But he has been here
a long while. And he is tall, and thin, and cold all the time, and
thinks all the time how he is sick." Ramón laughed joyously. "He
live near a fire, and he give very few orders, and everybody do
what he like. So they have a battle near Cahuenga, and José Avila
kill Ronaldo Pachecho, and Victoria is hurt bad with lances, and
when he get well he go back to Mexico, and everybody go home, and
now they send us a new governor, Figueroa."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, me. Well, you see, I go with Victoria in his army, and
my family and all the Californians are on the other side, and that
makes me not so dear with my family, so they send me here." He
chuckled. "I ver' bad boy."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," persisted Andy, pardoñably confused.
"Why did you join Victoria? I thought you said he was a Mexican
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," said Ramón, "all these others with Echeandia are south,
long ways away, and Victoria, he's up north and near by. Too far to
go to join these others. So I go with Victoria. He's lots of fun,
these war."</p>

<p>Andy's jaw dropped. This was too much for him.</p>

<p>"But," he stammered at last, then gave up the main question,
"but how would you feel if you'd killed some of your own people or
friends?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I kill nobody," disclaimed Ramón airily, "and nobody want
to kill me. For why? What difference who is governor? Juan Bandini
and Carillo and some of those men very fierce and angry, surely;
and the Mexicans. All right. Let them kill each other if they want.
But not we others. No-no-no!"</p>

<p>Andy reined in his horse.</p>

<p>"Well, what, in the name of common sense, did you do? Run away?"
he cried, startled into rudeness.</p>

<p>But Ramón was not affronted. He relapsed into Spanish, the
better to express himself.</p>

<p>"No, of course not," said he. "That would be to miss all the
fun. One rides, and one shouts, and one shoots the <i>escopeta</i>,
and," he chuckled, "if one can catch the hind leg of a horse with
this," he touched the reata, "then there is a great fall and
laughter, I think," said he, "that if I had not so upset my very
solemn uncle in a so very deep hole of mud I might even yet, Don
Largo, be sleeping at the <i>hacienda</i>." Ramón chuckled at the
recollection; and the iron-faced <i>vaqueros</i> chuckled with
him.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned!" Andy could not quite gather his wits
after these disclosures. Ramón sobered.</p>

<p>"You think that is not war, <i>amigo</i>," said he. "That is
true; I know that. All the young men know that, too. It is only the
few old serious ones, and those who wish to hold power. They are
not many, and they are always very angry. It is only people who
care much who make war." He fell thoughtful. "I think all people do
not know this, as I do, who have been educated outside and who
knows the world there. But so it is. One does not kill friends and
<i>parientes</i> for a small idea. And, at bottom, as long as the
cattle eat, and the warm sun shines, and the <i>señoritas</i> have
bright eyes, what matter who is governor or what he does?"</p>

<p>"Then," asked Andy sensibly, "why mix up in it at all, and get
sent out here, as you say, away from it all?"</p>

<p>"Ah," sighed Ramón, "there you are right. But these war is such
fun! And soon they will miss Ramón and his <i>palomino</i> at the
<i>rodeo</i> and the <i>matanza</i>, and soon the <i>señoritas</i>
at <i>baile</i> and <i>merienda</i> will say, 'Where is that Ramón
and his guitar?' and, <i>poof!</i> all will be forgive!" He laughed
lightly. "But see, Don Largo, if it had not been thus, we should
not have met. So I am glad of it and not sorry!"</p>

<p>"So am I," returned Andy sincerely.</p>

<p>"For tonight you will ride with me to the <i>rancho</i>, and we
will talk of what is to be done."</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>THE ranch house, which they reached near sunset, proved to be a
long adobe structure roofed with tules. It stood bare on a low
hill. Not a spear of anything green lived within a hundred yards of
it. The roof had been extended the length of one side to form a
sort of veranda with an earth floor. From a smaller detached
structure smoke was rising. Beyond that stood a circular corral of
greasewood bound with rawhide thongs. That was the whole visible
equipment of the place. From a distance it seemed to be surrounded
by a wide ring of white. As they rode nearer Andy saw that this
ring was composed of bones, the bones of cattle slaughtered for the
ranch's use. A swarm of dogs bounded forth in greeting. Ramón and
Andy dismounted at the veranda. Following the example of his host
Andy stripped his saddle and pack and bestowed them on pegs beneath
the roof. Panchito and José drove away the horses.</p>

<p>To the veranda opened a number of doorways. There were, however,
no doors. The gaps, both of the doorways and the few windows, were
hung with <i>serapes</i> or hides. Ramón pushed one of these
aside.</p>

<p>"<i>Es tú casa</i>." He murmured the familiar form of the
conventional welcome.</p>

<p>The room was long and low. It was lighted by a number of crudely
made candles of tallow. Its floor was of earth that had been
watered and beaten until it was as hard as cement. Except for two
chairs made ingeniously from elk horns and rawhide, and a long
table, there was no movable furniture. Along one side ran a bench
of adobe, a mere thickening of the wall. On this four
<i>vaqueros</i> were lounging, smoking cigarettes. One fingered a
guitar softly. They arose to their feet, saluting Ramón and Andy
with the soft ceremonial <i>buenas tardes</i>, eyeing Andy with
veiled but avid curiosity. They did not remove their hats. After a
few moments Panchito and José slipped in and sat down. They joined
the other <i>vaqueros</i>. A respectfully lowered hum of
conversation arose, heads gathered close together. Andy could not
hear; but he knew himself to be the subject. He sat apart, smoking
his pipe philosophically.</p>

<p>Ramón's high spirits were not in evidence. He had flung himself
into one of the elk-horn chairs and was lost in a brown study, his
eyes abstracted, his brow frowning. After a while a squat old
Indian woman, clad apparently in a single garment and with bare
feet, pushed aside the <i>serape</i> and deposited on the table a
pile of earthen plates and a handful of spoons rudely fashioned of
horn and of wood. Two others, equally squat but somewhat younger,
followed, bearing a pot of beans, an earthen plate of meat, and a
great pile of <i>tortillas</i>. They set them also on the table and
withdrew.</p>

<p>Ramón apparently did not notice them. The <i>vaqueros</i> fell
silent, glanced uneasily at him. Finally Panchito ventured to stand
before him.</p>

<p>"<i>Comida, señor</i>," he said respectfully.</p>

<p>Ramón came to with a start.</p>

<p>Each helped himself on one of the earthen plates, took one of
the horn or wooden spoons, unsheathed his knife from the scabbard
in his garter. They ate standing, without removing their hats; but
Ramón motioned Andy to the other chair, so the two of them sat at
table. Still he had no conversation, and as Andy dwelt easily in
silence the room was quiet except for an occasional muttered remark
of one of the men to another. And as, after the meal was finished
and the Indian women had carried out the dishes, Ramón seemed still
lost in his thoughts, the men tiptoed out. So for an hour, while
Andy smoked placidly.</p>

<p>Then abruptly Ramón stirred.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, <i>amigo</i>," said he, "I am not discourteous. I
think. And I get nowhere. I search in my mind for this way and that
way. But there is no way. It grieves me to the heart. I would take
you to the <i>hacienda</i>. I would bring you to my father, saying,
'Here, Papá, is your other son,' and he would welcome you for my
sake, and soon we would go together to search you out a
<i>rancho</i>, and the governor would grant you leagues of land,
and you would become <i>californio</i>, and we would ride together
and find you a <i>señorita</i> who shall look softly upon the
so-great largeness of Don Largo&mdash;I would like that, <i>alma de
mi alma</i>." He turned his black eyes, aglow with frank affection,
toward the tall grave young frontiersman.</p>

<p>"I would like it, too," returned Andy, warmed to unwonted
demonstration. "Only I don't know about the <i>señorita</i>," he
added.</p>

<p>Ramón laughed.</p>

<p>"Not too soon. We are <i>bronco</i>, we two, eh? But some day.
Perhaps we find for ourselves sisters&mdash;with the gray eyes of
Castile, I think, <i>pequeñas!</i> That is nice for us, so tall
ones; so that the chin just touches the top of the small shining
head." His teeth flashed, and he blew a kiss from the tips of his
fingers. But instantly his animation died. "But that is espoil," he
said sadly. "I think and think, but I cannot see. My father, my
family, they are very great; but they are not so great as that; no,
not when you have beat with his own sword upon the behind of that
so great <i>papagayo</i> the <i>Señor Teniente</i> Don
Jesus-Maria-Corbedo-de-Cortina," he checked the names sneeringly
one by one on his fingers. "I love you for that, you understand,"
he said parenthetically. "It is impossible. But you must not go
away. You will stay here, no? It is rude. It is not the
<i>hacienda</i>. There are no <i>señoritas</i>, no <i>gente de
razon</i>, nothing, nothing! It is a barren land, a place of exile.
But it is safe. No one will know. My peoples are true. We will ride
together. I will make of you <i>ranchero</i>. And we shall see.
No?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward, searching Andy's face with the urging of a
real desire. Andy's heart warmed. His mind passed lightly by the
young Californian's depreciations. Hardships meant nothing to him;
indeed, this simple house seemed to his wilderness-trained mind
abundantly luxurious, adequate to every desire.</p>

<p>He nodded, unable to speak. Even Ramón's quick intuitions were
as yet unable to fathom the strength of his emotions so long pent
beneath an iron and stoic repression, nor his shamefaced
Anglo-Saxon reluctance to allow them to rise to the surface. Ramón
had no such inhibitions.</p>

<p>"Hoop-la!" he cried delightedly. He snatched the guitar from its
hanging place on one of the room's low beams. His fingers swept its
strings.</p>

<p>"<i>La vida es sueño</i>&mdash;" he sang sweetly, and vehemently
struck the chords flat with the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>"<i>La vida es sueño</i>&mdash;" he repeated the
words&mdash;"that song is wrong, <i>señor</i>. Life is a dream!
Bah! Life is not a dream. Life is esport, a game! And we shall play
it together, you and I!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter III. Reata</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>ANDY BURNETT was destined to receive his first impressions of
the California of his adoption at the rough outlying <i>rancho</i>
to which his new friend Ramón had been banished by his indignant
family. It was not representative of the California life of the
period, as Andy was later to find out for himself, but it was a
safe refuge. And it offered him a schooling in certain fundamentals
which he must learn if he was to live in this new county
successfully.</p>

<p>From Andy's point of view the <i>rancho</i> was not so bad. He
had been long in the wilderness. The bed to which Ramón led him the
night of his arrival was the first in which he had slept for ten
years. To be sure, it was only a low frame strung with rawhide, but
it was furnished with coarse sheets and a pillow. For hours Andy
did not sleep at all. Outside, the swarm of ranch dogs howled and
yelled at coyotes who howled and yelled back. But they did not
bother him, He simply could not get accustomed to the fact of being
in a bed. Then the next instant, it seemed, Panchito, the head
<i>vaquero</i>, was bending over him.</p>

<p>"<i>Lucero, señor</i>," he awakened Andy.
<i>Lucero</i>&mdash;Andy's appreciation, newly warmed by
friendship, reflected sleepily that it was rather pretty to be
roused by this simple statement: <i>lucero</i>&mdash;the morning
star.</p>

<p>But he never had trouble thenceforth with that bed. Likewise the
ranch itself. To Ramón it seemed the last word in primitive
simplicity, lacking all the elegancies of life so graciously to be
enjoyed at the great <i>haciendas</i>. But Andy knew nothing of
such elegancies, so he did not miss them. Here were commodious
shelter in a mild climate; plenty of hearty and variegated food;
game everywhere; horses to ride; new things to do and learn;
congenial company. And to him the countryside of rounded bare brown
hills among which wound boulder-strewn dry watercourses was a
pleasant land. It had not the wild rugged beauty of the mountain
country, nor the wide-flung sweep of the prairies; but its very
simplicity was grateful to him just now. Nor, even in this brown
ripe time of the year, was it devoid of its beautiful moments, as
when after sunset the clear margin of its crests was edged with a
thin defining line of gold. Sometimes cattle, singly or in herds,
wandered across the face of the slopes; or a band of elk migrating
from the tules; and always there were the colonies of ground
squirrels, scampering to and fro in crossing lines, or sitting bolt
upright, like picket pins, their small hands crossed on their
bosoms. A keen eye&mdash;and Andy's were very keen&mdash;could
distinguish other more furtive creatures, coyotes or wildcats,
perhaps, sneaking from cover to cover. Swarms of small seed-eating
birds&mdash;goldfinches, linnets, horned larks, juncos&mdash;rose
and whirled away like leaves before a wind. Meadowlarks fed busily
in flocks; or sat singly on the tips of outcropping rocks and
uttered golden songs, unmindful of the fact that this was supposed
to be the silent time of year. Rangy solemn jack rabbits
materialized from furrows where they had flattened invisible to
lope away in long deliberate leaps. At a sharp yell they laid back
their ears and scudded off at an astonishing speed. Overhead small
hawks hovered over one spot on rapidly beating wings, heads
downward, spying for field mice in the grasses. The cloudless sky
was of the same deep tint of blue from horizon to horizon. Sunlight
filled all the air, liquid, golden, pouring down steadily in an
unremitting grateful flood.</p>

<p>The low round hills slept beneath it like gentle beasts. Across
their flanks ran the interlaced cattle and game trails. In some of
the bottomlands between them grew a few scattered cottonwoods or
sycamores, small patches of sage or greasewood or willows. Here
lived the blacktailed deer and the crested quail. Here were the
rare water pools where the underground streams peered momentarily
above the surface. To these pools the trails converged. Some of the
larger of them were bordered with tules. On them swam to and fro,
in quick jerks, placid and confidential gray mud hens with white
bills. Occasionally a duck or so, strayed from the valley, leaped
quacking and demoralized by surprise. In the bordering tules were
rustlings and the harsh crakeing of the reed peoples. Blackbirds
with scarlet trimmings swung from their swaying tips whistling like
flutes.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to ride slowly through this country looking at
these things. The horses moved steadily and tirelessly at a fast,
shuffling walk that covered the ground almost as rapidly as a slow
canter. Their heads were up, their ears pricked back and forth,
they revolved ceaselessly with their tongues the wide rollers on
the spade of their bits. Between his thighs Andy could feel the
eager, restrained quiver of the muscles awaiting the lift of his
bridle hand, the touch of his heel.</p>

<p>The days were like that, spacious, simple, alike. They passed
swiftly. Andy, to his vague wonder, seemed to himself always to be
going to bed, or getting up, and another day gone. Yet they were
crowded with happenings, great or small, so that from sunrise to
sunset they spread wide as the blue distances of the valley upon
which sometimes he looked from the last of the hills. It was a
strange double consciousness of time.</p>

<p>Then, almost before he knew it, came rains drifting in graceful
long veils rent by the wind; and when they cleared, by magic,
overnight, the hills were faintly green.</p>

<p>Here and there blazed the deep rich orange of single poppies,
like little suns. The green strengthened almost as he looked. For a
brief season it was vivid, unbelievable; then darkened and
strengthened; and the cattle ceased licking up the burrs of the
clover and began eagerly to crop the new feed. The poppies lay in
blankets across the slopes. The paler yellow of wild mustard
sketched and accented the folds of the hills. Other birds began to
believe the meadowlarks' denial of seasons; the air was sweet with
perfume, melodious with song.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>LIFE, like time, was dual in nature; simple in its broad aspect,
yet filled with incident and even adventure. Its sole task, the
single reason for its conduct, was to permit the cattle to feed and
breed and increase. Yet in the furtherance of that task were
comprised many skills and knowledges to which Andy was a complete
stranger. In spite of his long wilderness training he discovered
himself to be in these things as ignorant as a child. And like a
child he plunged eagerly and zestfully into the new experience. It
was exactly what he needed. With a new friend and new things to
learn, life, so suddenly and so tragically emptied, began again to
fill. He was once more happy and satisfied. He missed nothing.</p>

<p>It began promptly that first morning when Panchito had called
him from sleep with his simple mention of the morning star. The
dawn had not yet broken, but by the time he had eaten a breakfast
of <i>carne asada</i> with gravy and onions, and beans, and
<i>tortillas</i>, and a sort of coffee made of dried peas, the sky
was lightening in the east. He accompanied Ramón from the
candle-lighted interior to the soft velvet gray-black of the
out-of-doors. Panchito, mounted, waited at the veranda, holding the
reins of two saddled horses. Andy found his Indian pony had been
replaced by a fine chestnut, and that his own saddle still hung on
its peg. In its stead his animal was equipped with one like
Ramón's, with the wide skirts, and the low flat pommel as broad as
a saucer. A rawhide reata hung at the bow.</p>

<p>Panchito dismounted to adjust the length of the stirrup
leathers. He handed Andy a pair of big roweled spurs. But these
would not cling to the young man's moccasined feet.</p>

<p>"<i>Fuera!</i>" muttered Ramón.</p>

<p>"I can get on without them," said Andy.</p>

<p>But Ramón shook his head.</p>

<p>"Wait," said he.</p>

<p>He returned from his own quarters with a pair of <i>botas</i>,
finished with the fringed leather protections at the heels.</p>

<p>"You and I, luckily, are of a size," he remarked.</p>

<p>They were ready to start. Andy took in hand the long rifle and
prepared to mount.</p>

<p>"You will not need that, <i>amigo</i>," protested Ramón. "No, I
tell you. It will be useless. You cannot ride the cattle with
that."</p>

<p>He disengaged the piece from Andy's grasp and took it indoors.
Andy was reluctant, uneasy. For ten long years he had ridden with
the Boone gun beneath his hand. He felt somehow naked, exposed to
the world.</p>

<p>Ramón slapped his own mount with his open hand, and as it darted
forward at full speed, sprang lightly to his saddle. Andy was
nearly unseated by the unexpectedness of his own animal's leap. He
was a good enough practical horseman, and could even, at need,
cling to the side of his horse, Indian fashion, and shoot from
beneath its neck; but he had not the rhythm and certainty of these
superb horsemen. Their bodies gracefully and easily erect, the tips
of their toes just touching the stirrups directly beneath them,
they seemed to be swooping through the air in a long glide
unaffected by the motion of the plunging beasts beneath them. At
full speed they swept for a few hundred yards, then brought up
suddenly with three stiff-legged buck jumps that scattered the
loose earth in a fan before them and again all but shook the
unsuspecting Andy from his saddle.</p>

<p>He found that they had stopped their headlong career only just
in time to avoid collision with a small band of cattle and a
smaller band of loose horses. The five other <i>vaqueros</i> he
made out as dim figures on the other side of the herd. Immediately
they began with shouts and urgings to get these cattle under
way.</p>

<p>Already the light was strong enough to see. Ramón spurred to the
lead, out of the dust, motioning Andy to join him. They proceeded
down through the hills toward the great valley, the cattle
following herded by the <i>vaqueros</i>.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked Andy at last.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I forget," Ramón apologized. "You remember, when we
ride in yesterday, we see a few cattle?"</p>

<p>"Where you roped the bull?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, those are our cattle, but they escape from our
<i>rodeo</i> and go very wild, like the deer. To seek them is why
yesterday we ride&mdash;I and Panchito and José&mdash;so far from
the <i>rancho</i> and so have the good fortune to meet you,
<i>amigo</i>, for which the saints be praise. And today we go to
drive in those we have found."</p>

<p>"Where are you driving these others to better feed?"</p>

<p>Ramón stood in his stirrups to look back. He laughed. "But no!"
he replied, "these are the <i>cabestros</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Cabestros?</i>" Andy repeated the strange word.</p>

<p>"Examine them well, <i>amigo</i>."</p>

<p>Andy turned in his saddle to look. He saw at once that a horn of
each had been bored to permit the insertion of a short stout
crosspiece of hardwood. He learned that this was used as a sort of
portable mooring post for other beasts.</p>

<p>"One cannot drive wild cattie," explained Ramón. "No horses can
hold many of them together in one band. They break here; they break
there. So we use the <i>cabestro</i>."</p>

<p>That day's ride taught Andy much. Each of the wild cattle
brought in must be run down in fair race, roped and subdued. Its
horn was then lashed close to the crosspiece in one of the
<i>cabestros</i>' horns. Thus he was held from escape; and thus,
when each <i>cabestro</i> had its traveling companion, the herd was
held together and driven to the ranch house. There it was
corralled, the animals separated. The newcomers were left overnight
to think about it. The faithful <i>cabestros</i> were cut out and
rewarded with salt. The <i>cabestros</i> were very gentle beasts,
kept so by much handling and kind treatment. They knew their job
and enjoyed it thoroughly, especially when first the wild cattle
were bound to their horns. The <i>cabestros</i> had done this thing
many times. They knew a trick or two. The undisciplined frantic
wild ones had no chance at all against their skilled cunning. The
<i>cabestros</i> held them by a slight angle of the horn, a turn of
the neck, a brace of the foot as required, with an occasional
vicious twist that inflicted punishment. In an astonishingly brief
time the captive was thoroughly subdued to the idea that it had
better go along peaceably. Soon it would have been difficult to
distinguish which was which, were it not for the eyes. Those of the
wild one were rolling to show the whites: those of the
<i>cabestro</i> were virtuous with smug satisfaction.</p>

<p>But before that happy solution there must be some pretty wild
riding, Andy discovered. At sight of the horsemen the wild cattle
curled their tails and departed. Then, save for one man who guarded
the <i>cabestro</i> band and the spare horses, all clapped spurs
and set out at full speed in pursuit. Andy hardly knew which most
to admire, the men or the horses. Wherever the cattle went, there
must go the pursuers, without hesitation, without check, without
thought for the terrain, nor heed for a fall, uphill, downhill,
through the low concealing patches of sage, across rock-strewn
slopes and boulder-choked stream beds, through treacherous squirrel
towns, hell bent, full speed. Where a cow could go, there could go
a man and a horse, though at times the feat seemed impossible. The
horses were marvelous. Often unable to see clearly more than a few
feet ahead, they were quick as cats in their avoidances, sometimes
leaping directly sideways as some unexpected boulder or hole
intervened, or plunging to a stop in two paces before the trap of
an eroded <i>barranca</i>, and again racing forward in a new
direction at top speed when even a few yards of clear ground
offered. Nor were the riders less admirable in their complete
abandon to the skill of their mounts, their complete concentration
on the fleeing quarry, the ease and grace with which they not
merely held their seats but remained throughout in poised control.
When one was near enough the rawhide loop shot forward to encircle
the widespread horns. No matter what the speed or how awkward the
moment's situation, not once did it miss. The trained horse stopped
short, and at the exact instant threw its weight at the exact angle
against the shock. The cow greatly outweighed the horse.
Nevertheless, it was the cow that went down with a thud.</p>

<p>It was permitted to rise to its feet. It plunged and reared,
buck jumping and struggling, while the pony, its ears virtuously
aslant, backed or yielded, as the situation required. Soon it was
able to tow the frantic animal slowly but inexorably to the waiting
<i>cabestros</i>.</p>

<p>Andy joined with exhilaration in this wild chase. He had run
buffalo on the plains and had done his share of rough-riding in the
course of his regular business as a mountain man. The first hundred
yards inspired him with complete confidence in the animal be
bestrode. He held even in the race; he kept his saddle. He was even
able on one or two occasions to be of some slight assistance in
turning the fleeing cattle.</p>

<p>After a half dozen or more had been thus pursued, roped, dragged
in, and tied, the men changed horses. Then they took breathing
space, squatting on their heels, rolling cigarettes of powdered
tobacco and corn husks, lighting them with a flint and steel
against a long string of cotton tinder wound for protection with a
strip of cotton cloth. Ramón clapped Andy on the back.</p>

<p>"But he rides, this one!" he cried. "We shall make of him a
<i>vaquero</i> surely, eh, Panchito?"</p>

<p>The head man nodded, also well pleased with the unexpected dash
of this <i>americano</i>. The only specimens of that race he had
heretofore encountered were the occasional sailors from the Boston
ships.</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>," he agreed heartily.</p>

<p>Andy was pleased. He discovered in himself an unprecedented
desire for good opinion. He wanted next to try his hand with the
reata at his saddlebow. He had, of course, learned to throw an
incidental and modestly skillful loop in the handling of his
mountain horses. But this Ramón would not have, and became very
grave and earnest about it.</p>

<p>"No-no," he cried, "not these <i>broncos</i>."</p>

<p>He told of the things that could happen, the horse and rider
dragged by superior weight and strength, a hand smashed between the
rope and the saddle, or a leg cut through by a wrong angle of
strain.</p>

<p>"You must not be offend, <i>amigo</i>," he assured Andy
earnestly. "These things are not learn in one day. See, when I was
so small I only just know to walk I begin."</p>

<p>He flashed his white teeth, laughing. "I have my reata. I begin
to catch first the kitten, then the cat, then the dog and pig. By
and by the calf. One time, when I was very small, I catch my papá."
He chuckled. "That was not good. I was put <i>en penitencia</i>.
You know that? No? I kneel on my knees on dry peas in front of a
estool, and on the estool a plate and a knife and a espoon. But
there was nothing on the plate; nothing. But here I estay while all
the others eat. But as soon as Papá go out of the room, my mother
and all my sister run to me and give me plenty food and
<i>panoche</i> and pet me much, so it is not so bad. But you will
learn quick; that I can see; for you ride well. But not on the
<i>broncos</i>. No, no-no!"</p>

<p>"I don't ride like you, Ramón," said Andy, with a faint
envy.</p>

<p>"Oh, me!" Ramón shrugged the compliment aside. "That too I begin
young. When I'm two or three year old. What you think I ride
first?"</p>

<p>"A pony? a burro?" hazarded Andy.</p>

<p>"A pig!" Ramón shouted delightedly. "And when I'm three-four
years old I sit in the middle on a horse and my little brother in
front of me and my little cousin behind me, and we ride fast
everywhere. Sometimes we all fall off together, and the horse he
run home, and we walk. Panchito, all <i>californios</i>, the same."
He was struck by a sudden idea. "He shall show you!" he cried.</p>

<p>So at command Panchito mounted, and a horse was cut out from the
spare herd, and the <i>vaquero</i> gave an exhibition. He threw the
reata with whirling loop, flip cast it from a stand, overhand or
underhand. He snared, at a gallop, any leg designated. He caught
all four together. The serious business of the day seemed quite
forgotten.</p>

<p>"There is always tomorrow." Ramón shrugged aside Andy's
conscientious observation that the day was passing. He had become
very earnest in his exposition of the reata, And successfully so.
Andy began to see it not only as an implement of industry but as a
serviceably deadly short-range weapon. Ramón explained its fighting
uses, and the defenses against it, as when one wards off its
threatening loop with lance or sword held horizontal.</p>

<p>"As you could have done with that long rifle of yours, had you
known," said he.</p>

<p>At length, after an hour, they went on about the business.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>ANDY took seriously Ramón's promise that Panchito should teach
him; and Panchito, pleased by the tall American's interest,
lavished pains on his education. Though, after his illustrated
explanations, the manual part of it was mainly a case of practise,
and practise, and practise, as Andy had, in the long ago, practised
throwing the knife. Andy's whole training had been in the line of
such dexterities, so it did not take him very long to master a
workable ability. That is to say, he could rope an individual horse
from the <i>remuda</i> without many misses; and he could be relied
upon to pull his weight in the routine work of the <i>rancho</i>.
His respect for the reata grew. Not only was it a combination of
deadly close-range weapon and indispensable tool for stock
handling, but its loop was dropped casually over the most
incongruous small jobs that required to be stirred from one place
or transported to another. So much of a third hand was the slender
supple braided rawhide that when, one evening, Andy dryly suggested
to Panchito, who was having difficulty in the threading of a
needle, that he do it with his reata, Panchito caught the idea
instantly.</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>," he agreed, "I think perhaps I could do it
better with that."</p>

<p>"It is a pity that Panchito must leave the reata behind when he
dies," said Ramón. "If he could take it he would undoubtedly be
able to haul himself out of hell, where he is surely going, and
into heaven, where he does not belong."</p>

<p>"Like all <i>californios</i>," agreed Panchito equably. "It may
be that the blessed Saint James will provide me one. I have burned
to him enough candles to grease it."</p>

<p>Everyone went to bed at eight o'clock or a little after; but the
days were now short. Andy enjoyed the evenings. Panchito was
teaching him smaller handicrafts that kept his hands busy. He
learned to braid the reata, to fashion the <i>honda</i> or ring
through which the loop was formed, to render it supple with
manipulation and much tallow. He learned also to make ropes and
<i>cinchas</i> of horsehair, using the white, the black, and the
chestnut or bay in pleasing patterns. These were not only gay or
ornamental but at times indispensable when a horse was to be tied
out at night. For this purpose rawhide was useless for the reason
that the coyotes, attracted by the tallow, gnawed it through. Ramón
possessed a hair rope of black and seal brown so soft that one
could crumple it in one's hands like a silken cord.</p>

<p>"Woman's hair," growled Panchito scornfully. "It has not the
strength."</p>

<p>"Strong enough to hold you, Panchito," mocked Ramón. "Ask
Vicenta, eh?"</p>

<p>This was over Andy's head; but he thought it well to change the
subject.</p>

<p>Sometimes Ramón, or one of the other men, sang to the
accompaniment of the guitar, simple little songs with sweet minor
cadences and beneath them nearly always a suggestion of the
foot-tapping <i>tiempo de bolero</i>. Their perfume was of love or
a faint memory of nostalgia for a Spain none of them knew. Nothing
would do but that Andy should learn the chords on this instrument.
He was not too keen.</p>

<p>"When you meet that <i>doncellita</i> of your heart you must
know how to woo her," Ramón insisted, "to woo her not as a
<i>mozo</i>, but as a <i>caballero</i> should, beneath her window,
and a small so-white hand that just flutters, like a dove, and
vanishes."</p>

<p>"No <i>doncellita</i> for me." Andy grinned at this picture of
himself.</p>

<p>"A <i>doncellita</i> for every man." Ramón was serious.</p>

<p>"Don Ramón knows," said Panchito unexpectedly. "He keeps a good
supply of hair for his rope."</p>

<p>"What mean you by that?" The young man turned on him.</p>

<p>"<i>Nada, nada</i>," Panchito shrugged. "I but urged Don Andres
to believe you, <i>señor</i>, he so admired your hair rope."</p>

<p>Behind his impassive face flickered a faint relish. Andy
perceived that he felt he had scored in return for Ramón's
reference to the mysterious Vicenta.</p>

<p>But he did fool with the guitar at odd times. At first he was
very clumsy, and he lacked confidence. Ramón laughed but encouraged
him.</p>

<p>"One time, in Monterey," he told Andy, "a man&mdash;we will call
him El Corbo&mdash;went with his guitar to sing under a window. The
window was of a woman who was marry. El Corbo thought the husband
was gone, but he come back. Me, I do not know why the husband no
stick El Corbo with a knife. Perhaps he afraid. But instead he call
El Corbo before the <i>alcalde</i>, whose name is Señor Casteñares,
I tell you his name because I like that judge and what he do. Señor
Casteñares is disgust that this husband bring this matter to court.
He think. Then he say to El Corbo that he play the guitar and sing
like he did for the woman. When he have finish he ask, 'Is that the
tune you play and the song you sing?' and El Corbo say, yes, that
is it. So Casteñares ask him, 'Is that the best you can play him?'
and El Corbo say yes again. Then say this good Alcalde Casteñares,
'Then I fine you six fat cow because you disturb the peace.'"</p>

<p>Andy laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm that bad, eh?"</p>

<p>But he enjoyed his efforts for all that. And shortly in another
direction he discovered his audience.</p>

<p>Andy had never before had an audience. Simply he had done
things, and let it go at that. But now he found himself in demand
as a story-teller. At first he talked of his adventures only in
reply to direct questions, and then briefly and almost
shamefacedly. But genuine interest stimulated him. He thawed. He
told them of the land the other side of the Sierra; of the
trapping, and the Indians, and the long hunts. That country and
that life were more remote from these men than is now to us any
part of the earth's surface. They hung upon his words, uttering
deep-toned ejaculations of wonder. Andy did not brag, did not play
up the heroic. He tried merely to give them an idea; and the very
sincerity of that endeavor built them a picture. They began to
sense him as a heroic figure come among them from the mists of
another state of being, so remote as to partake almost of the
mythical. Perhaps this appreciation was not ungrateful to the boy
concealed beneath the frontiersman's grave exterior, a welcome
counterbalance to his sense of present unproficiencies. Especially
was Ramón fascinated with the sign language. He exclaimed
delightedly over the significance of the graceful gestures, and
their appositeness. His quick intelligence caught the exact
illustrative quality of each, a quality that not only pictured the
idea to be conveyed, but made so easy the remembering of it. He
found it immensely amusing to carry on long conversations with his
friend through that medium.</p>

<p>"Now we can talk and no one understand!" he cried
delightedly.</p>

<p>An expansion was slowly unfolding Andy. The old hard, wary
tightness that had relaxed only in his few intimate relations was
loosening its grip on his heart. He was becoming a different man.
His very manner was losing something of its severe level gravity,
borrowing from his new companions a faint trace of liveliness, of
irrelevancy. This unfoldment was warmed further by the deep
underlying consciousness of something to which for ten years he had
been almost a stranger, the sense of security. He had not
appreciated how integral a part of himself had become his constant
wariness against ever present danger. Now the Boone gun rested on
pegs in the wall.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>THE business of the <i>rancho</i> required constant attention.
The day began with the morning star and ended with sunset. On the
other hand, it was carried forward in a spacious leisure that
permitted one at any time and anywhere to look upon a pleasant
world. It was conducted on horseback. No one walked even fifty
yards. Saddled animals stood always ready for the simplest errands.
If it was desirable to start before daylight, the first mounts of
the day trailed roughly made rawhide ropes all night the easier to
capture them in the dark. Spare horses were always at hand, to take
the place of those that had been wearied. There were many horses,
divided into <i>caponeras</i>, or small bands of about two dozen
head. They followed slavishly each its own gentle mare, usually a
pinto. These <i>caponeras</i> were all geldings, for saddle
purposes. Nobody ever rode mares, Ramón explained with horror. That
was very bad, a humiliation. The mares ran in bands of their own,
called <i>manadas</i>. They were wild and unhandled, except that
occasionally each <i>manada</i> was corralled and the manes and
tails cut to provide material for the hair ropes and cinches. The
integrity of the little bands was well maintained by the stallion
in charge. He saw to it that his ladies did not stray. Indeed, at
times, he attempted to add to their number by seduction from a
rival's harem. One of the ranch jobs was to referee the resultant
argument and to rope and drag apart the warriors if the battle
seemed likely to go too far. Then one of the <i>manadas</i> was
driven over the hills and far away, to relieve the fair ladies of
undue temptation. The manes and tails of the stallions were never
cut.</p>

<p>"Should that be done, the mares would abhor them," explained
Ramón quaintly.</p>

<p>One regularly recurrent task was rounding up the stock and
driving it to the <i>rodeo</i> grounds, where it was held for a few
hours and then turned loose. This was done twice a month or so,
simply to accustom the animals to being handled and to proceeding,
when driven, toward a definite spot. Otherwise they would soon run
wild, like those brought in by the <i>cabestros</i>, This was a
matter of easy riding over a great area of beautiful country,
singing, and shouting, occasionally dashing after some truant, but
in general with nothing to do but ride the ridges and watch the
long brown lines of cattle hurrying to the rendezvous. The other
regularly recurrent task was the breaking of fresh horses to the
saddle. The first processes were direct and rough; the finishing
was slow and carried on with long patience. At the beginning it
took two to do the trick. The selected animal was roped, thrown,
blindfolded, permitted to regain its feet. The heavy saddle was
tossed to its back, the swinging cinch hooked beneath its belly, by
means of a forked stick, to the grasp of the rider. In spite of the
<i>bronco's</i> kicks the <i>latigo</i> was hauled tight. A
horsehair hackamore was slipped, over the nose. It carried no bit,
but was provided with a broad band of leather across the forehead
which, by a thrust of the hand, could be shoved down to blind the
beast if necessity arose.</p>

<p>The rider's only other unusual protection was a strong bar
lashed crosswise on the saddle. This was to prevent the horse from
rolling; for once the rider was in the saddle he stayed there, even
when, whether through design or accident, the horse threw
himself.</p>

<p>But after the <i>bronco</i> had learned that his repeated
attempts resulted in nothing but punishment, his finer education
began. The rider was marvelously patient; as forbearing as before
he had seemed inhumane. The perfected mount was reined to turn or
stop by the mere lift of a hand, a pressure of the knee. These men
never used the bit at all except as an especial or emergency
measure; the reins hung loose and swaying. Indeed, Panchito rode
customarily with his reins crossed in front of his horse's chest.
Andy's appraisals were constantly wavering. Nothing could exceed
the gentle consideration of these men when engaged, after the first
"gentling," in the handling of the new mounts. And yet, once
trained, they were ridden without mercy or apparent thought of
suffering. It was not deliberate cruelty; it was merely something
that did not enter their consciousness at all. Ramón was no
different from the others in that respect. But every man possessed
a show or favorite mount which he never subjected to rough work or
harsh treatment. Like the <i>palomino</i>. This blind spot bothered
him, for Andy was a loyal soul. Those he accepted as friends were
to him as himself, and their deficiencies were as his own.</p>

<p>The cattle must be protected as well as handled, he learned.
Part of that protection was prosaic in character, as when, after
the rains, it was necessary to ride vigilantly the whole range,
searching animals bogged to the bellies in the softened adobe.
These were dragged out bodily by a loop over the horns. Sometimes
one was so deeply mired that it required two ropes and two tugging,
straining horses to extricate it. It seemed as though the neck of
the bawling creature must be pulled in two. And like as not, as
soon as it had reached firm ground, it charged its rescuers. The
horses dodged it nimbly; their riders regained their loops by a
deft twist of the wrist and rode away laughing at the indignant
snorting animal staring about it wildly for what it could destroy.
In spite of their vigilance it sometimes happened that the men came
upon mired beasts too late, evidently too far gone to survive.
These they abandoned. Andy shot them with a flintlock pistol he had
unearthed at the ranch house and which he had appropriated for that
purpose. Apparently this merciful expedient would never have
occurred to his companions.</p>

<p>In spite of Ramón's prediction, they were not, that season,
subjected to raids by the horse-stealing Indians. Nevertheless,
often they swung wide into the valley, riding fast and far, from
sunrise to dark, with no other purpose than to look for signs of
marauders.</p>

<p>Toward spring they were called upon to deal with a new menace.
From the wilder mountains to the south the bears began to venture
out into the open country. They frequented mostly the thick cover
of brushy and wooded draws, but occasionally one or more would be
encountered trundling about in the open country. These were
considered dangerous to the stock and must be killed. It was
primarily a matter of business; only secondarily of sport, though
all concerned enjoyed the pursuit hugely. But, then, these people
made of anything a sport. Andy wanted to take the long rifle from
its peg, but Ramón disapproved.</p>

<p>"It is dangerous to fight the bear with the gun," he said in all
seriousness.</p>

<p>The preferred weapon, was, again the reata. Certainly the chase
as so conducted seemed to Andy not wholly devoid of risk. But after
one or two experiences he had reluctantly to admit to himself that
something was to be said for Ramón's point of view. Even the
boldest of the mountain men, with the single small bullet at his
command, hesitated without sound reason to tackle the ferocious
"white bear." The encounter was always chancy. But when two of the
<i>vaqueros</i> set out to kill a bear the result seemed certain.
On catching sight of the quarry they immediately pursued him at
full speed, riding a little off the flank to avoid running into him
in case he should stop suddenly. When the bear bayed, as he always
did after a short dash, one rider engaged his attention while the
other roped him from behind. The first reata must snare a hind leg.
It was useless to cast at his head or forepaws. In such case he bit
off the reata as though it had been string. Usually the bear
struggled for a moment, then suddenly sat down. The horse backed
away, tugging as hard as he could, but without apparent effect on
the bear's great bulk. Sometimes the latter would turn and charge.
In that case the horse avoided him nimbly and easily. Sometimes he
would start away, dragging his tormentor after him for a
considerable distance. After he had struggled thus for some time
and had more or less exhausted himself, the second rider, who had
been keenly awaiting the proper moment, went into action. Like a
flash of light his reata encircled the bear's neck and was drawn
tight; and instantly the two horses were turned in opposite
directions and spurred to the limit of their power. This maneuver
must be executed very quickly. A moment's slack, permitting the
bear to get his forepaws over the second rope, would be disastrous.
But it was always so executed. In a few moments the bear ceased to
struggle. He had been choked to death. If a third rider happened to
be present he also cast his loop to bind together the victim's
forepaws. That made it simpler but was not necessary. The whole
affair was very businesslike. The men went about it as part of the
day's work, so to speak. Nevertheless, Andy found it tremendously
exciting. He was present merely as spectator, for he was not yet up
to this sort of thing. In this manner four bears were killed within
a week. Reluctantly he had to admit again to himself, in secret,
that Ramón was right, that in the hands of these men the reata was
a surer and safer weapon than the Boone gun. And he entertained a
sincere respect for their courage and skill, even though they
appeared to take the whole performance as a matter of course.
Andy's cool courage had been many times proved, but repetition
never abated his thrill at these close encounters with a raging,
bawling half ton of fury.</p>

<p>Only once that winter did Andy take the Boone gun afield. Then
he slipped away by himself with the idea of shooting one of the fat
bucks that had organized a bachelor's club in the bottomland. This
he succeeded in doing; but unfortunately, just after he had
delivered his shot, he was attacked by one of the range cattle.
Submissive enough to the man on horseback, these animals are more
dangerous than a grizzly to a man on foot; much more dangerous, for
they invariably attack at sight, whereas the grizzly is peaceable
enough unless disturbed. Could Andy have reached his horse he would
have been perfectly safe. But unfortunately he had tied that beast
when he had set out to stalk the deer. As the country was open,
without tree or projecting rock, he was in imminent danger of his
life. But Ramón, attracted by the shot, appeared in the nick of
time. He was mounted on the <i>palomino</i>. At full speed he
dashed at the steer from behind, leaned from his saddle, seized the
beast's tail. He shouted; the <i>palomino</i> leaped mightily
ahead; the steer was turned end for end, rolled over and over. It
scrambled to its feet, still full of fight. Ramón repeated the
maneuver. After the third repetition the chastened beast slunk
away.</p>

<p>Andy took his escape coolly. A miss to him was as good as the
width of the continent, and to a danger passed he never awarded the
briefest thought. Except to make a mental note not to be caught so
again.</p>

<p>But Ramón was excited and therefore a little exasperated. He
pointed out in no uncertain terms the folly of showing one's self
afoot to range cattle; of separating one's self from one's horse;
of the idiocy of bothering with deer when good beef was so
plentiful.</p>

<p>Andy took his scolding philosophically. He agreed with all Ramón
had to say, now that he had learned about it.</p>

<p>"The deer is not worth eating, anyhow," concluded Ramón.</p>

<p>Andy did not agree to this, but it was not worth while to
dispute.</p>

<p>"He is worth wearing," he returned equably, "and I must make me
some buckskins soon if I am not to go naked."</p>

<p>Ramón struck his forehead in his dramatic way.</p>

<p>"<i>Ay de mi!</i>" he cried. "I am a great fool! I never think
that you must have more clothes! But not the skin of the deer! No,
see! Soon we shall make the <i>rodeo</i>, the slaughter of the
year, the <i>matanza</i>, and from the <i>hacienda</i> will come
the <i>peones</i> for the hides and the tallow. They shall bring
you clothes. I shall send a message. That is agree?"</p>

<p>Andy nodded. He had no desire to go through the laborious
process of making buckskin if he could get anything else.</p>

<p>"I must learn that trick," said he.</p>

<p>"What trick is that?"</p>

<p>"Up-ending them by the tail that way. That was neat."</p>

<p>"The <i>colear</i>!" cried Ramón, enlightened. "Yes, that is
good treek. We use him much at the <i>rodeo</i> when the bull or
the cow want run away from the herd. After he get the <i>colear</i>
two-three times, then he be good."</p>

<p>"I should think he might," agreed Andy.</p>

<p>"He's good esport at <i>fiesta</i>," went on Ramón. "Some of
these cow know the <i>colear</i> pretty good. You laugh to see
them. When man on horseback come near, he tuck his tail tight
between his leg. He's a good treek, but you watch out when you try
him or you take a bad tumble. You begin on the so-small young cow."
He rode thoughtfully for a few moments. "I tell you," he offered at
last, "I teach you the <i>colear</i> if you put that gun of yours
on the wall and leave him there. I tell you he's dangerous. He's
all right for your country, but here, every time, he get you in
trouble!"</p>

<p>Andy laughed and promised. He learned to do the <i>colear</i>,
and the long rifle went definitely into retirement.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>ONE morning toward the latter end of March Andy snatched his
horse to a stand. At the moment he and Panchito were just topping
the crest of a hill. From the valley below, their ears were
assailed by a medley of shrill wailing shrieks, piercing,
diabolical, like nothing Andy had ever before heard from throat of
man or beast.</p>

<p>"What the devil!" he cried. "Something is being attacked!"</p>

<p>Panchito laughed.</p>

<p>"<i>Las carretas, señor</i>. They have come for the hides and
tallow. Now we will have <i>rodeo</i>. Come see."</p>

<p>They rode straight down the slope at the headlong pace Andy had
found to be the normal gait of the country when one wanted to get
anywhere. In the bottomland they soon discovered the cause of all
the hullabaloo. Three ox carts strung out a quarter mile or so
apart. They met the first. It was made of heavy timbers lashed
together with rawhide. Its wheels were merely cross sections of
huge trees, in the centers of which holes had been bored for the
wooden axles. These probably had fitted fairly well when new; but
wear had enlarged them to a diameter of as much as a foot. Thence
had arisen, and was still arising, the weird shrieking that had so
puzzled Andy.</p>

<p>The <i>carreta</i> was drawn by oxen yoked by the horns.</p>

<p>This was the first detail Andy noticed. It seemed to him awkward
and senseless, and very painful to the poor beasts. He said so to
Panchito as they rode forward. Panchito merely shrugged.</p>

<p>"But," insisted Andy, "they could pull so much more load with
their shoulders and would be a lot more comfortable."</p>

<p>"That may not be, <i>señor</i>," returned Panchito politely but
firmly. "Thus in Spain always, always have cattle been so yoked. It
is well known that the wisest people in the world live in Spain,
and if there were a better way of yoking cattle, undoubtedly they
would have known it."</p>

<p>By now the first <i>carreta</i> was so near that further
conversation was impossible until it should stop. It was driven by
an Indian and carried several others as passengers. These men
resembled their wild brethren in feature but were dressed in a
simple sort of uniform of loose blue trousers and coarse cotton
shirt, with a broad band confining the hair. Their expressions,
moreover, were informed with a certain placid intelligence.
Evidently they were some steps on the way to civilization. As the
horsemen approached, the driver brought the oxen to a halt, and a
blessed stillness fell, though in the distance the other two
<i>carretas</i>, slowly drawing near, continued to shriek blasphemy
against the outraged peace of the spring morning.</p>

<p>"<i>Ave María purísima</i>," the driver of the first
<i>carreta</i> greeted the horsemen. His eyes, alight with covert
curiosity, devoured the strange figure of the buckskin-clad
mountain man.</p>

<p>"<i>Sin pecado original concebida</i>," Panchito returned.</p>

<p>"<i>Mar a Dios</i>," said the Indian.</p>

<p>"<i>Madre de Dios</i>," said Panchito.</p>

<p>Whereupon the Indian set his beasts in motion again and
proceeded on his leisurely and ear-splitting way. The flat bed of
the <i>carreta</i> carried, besides its passengers, a few boxes and
bags.</p>

<p>The second was empty, and after the same formal greeting, also
continued its journey. But at sight of the third Panchito uttered a
loud ejaculation of surprise and perhaps of dismay.</p>

<p>It had been made into a crude sort of precursor of the covered
wagon by means of a cotton sun shelter stretched across
perpendicular stakes. On various boxes and bundles sat upright, as
though enthroned, a woman.</p>

<p>She was rather a fat woman, but with pleasing, comfortable,
humorous good looks of her own, and with intelligent snapping black
eyes that were really beautiful. These surveyed the obviously
crestfallen Panchito in mocking amusement that became tempered with
a veiled surreptitious curiosity as they stole toward Panchito's
companion.</p>

<p>"Vicenta!" cried the <i>vaquero</i>, as the cart groaned to a
stop. "What brings you here?"</p>

<p>"You are glad to see me, eh?" Her voice was soft and
musical.</p>

<p>"Always, <i>alma de mi alma</i>," Panchito hastened to reply.
"But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;is it wise?"</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;<i>los Indios</i>," she heaved a theatrical sigh,
"but what is danger when the heart calls? When I think of you here
suffering such hardship, such peril, all alone&mdash;ah&mdash;" She
rolled her eyes and sighed. Then, after a moment, briskly, and in
businesslike tones, "But be not alarmed for me, <i>querido</i>. I
return with the <i>carretas</i>, My business is not to braid your
queue." She turned a slow friendly smile toward Andy.</p>

<p>"My husband is so overcome with joy, <i>señor caballero</i>,
that he forgets to make us known."</p>

<p>"I am a friend of Don Ramón, <i>señora</i>, Andrew&mdash;Andres
Burnett!'</p>

<p>"And-r-r-ew," she repeated. "That is not so easy for my tongue.
I think I like better Don Andres. You are a friend of Don Ramón.
Yes: that I think most likely." She laughed, but without malice.
"It seems to me I have heard of you, señor. I think most people
have heard of you. And you are here. But that is droll."</p>

<p>"That is not your business, woman!" cried Panchito roughly.</p>

<p>"My business is not with you, <i>amigo</i>!" she said. "It is
with your betters. <i>Vaya!</i>" she commanded the ox driver. The
shriek of the <i>carreta</i> drowned any reply Panchito might have
made.</p>

<p>"<i>Diablo!</i>" muttered the <i>vaquero</i> uncomfortably,
"what does the woman here? I do not like it." He shook his head.
"She loves her ease. Señor, I do not like it."</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>THEY arrived at the ranch house near dark to find Ramón not yet
returned and the <i>carretas</i> unloaded and Vicenta established
in the outside kitchen from which she had ousted the Indian
woman.</p>

<p>"At least we shall eat," said Panchito, his gloom lightening
somewhat. "The woman can cook. But I must stop her tongue."</p>

<p>After a few moments of indecision he obviously took his courage
in his hands and departed for a conference with the lady. Those of
the <i>vaqueros</i> who had finished their day and returned seemed
highly amused at the situation.</p>

<p>Ramón himself, when he arrived, shared this amusement, but
appeared to be more surprised. He too visited the kitchen. He
returned enlightened but thoughtful and immediately drew Andy
aside.</p>

<p>"It is explained," he told his friend. "She comes with a
message. It is for me, from my mamá. I am no longer the bad boy. I
must return to the <i>hacienda</i> to eat of the young calf, like
the man in the Bible. All is forgive. Poor Vicenta, she has the
heart of gold. So long a journey, and the sun so hot, and the dust
so choke, and the <i>carreta</i> so shake the bone. If ever you
ride the <i>carreta</i>&mdash;which the saints forbid,
<i>señor</i>&mdash;you shall see. And la Vicenta so fat." Ramón
chuckled, then instantly became grave. "But that is a true
devotion," he said.</p>

<p>Andy agreed it was true devotion, but could not quite see its
necessity. Why not a simple message by one of the ox drivers? Ramón
tried to explain.</p>

<p>"But my papá, he could not tell me to come back!" he said.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Andy wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>amigo</i>, you are <i>americano</i>; you do not
understand the Espanish people," he cried. "My papá have been
angry; he send me away. He cannot tell me to come back. No, no-no!
He is proud. That is for mamá to say: that if I come back my papá
will be no longer angry. You see? That is woman business. That is
not man business at all! You see?"</p>

<p>But Andy's simple and direct mind did not see entirely. It still
seemed rather roundabout. Why did not Ramón's mother send her
message through one of the Indian drivers, then?</p>

<p>"No, no-no!" repeated Ramón in horror. "Did I not tell you this
is not man's business? And these Indians&mdash;they are servants.
This is family matter not to be done by servant."</p>

<p>"Well, Vicenta&mdash;isn't she a servant?" asked Andy
reasonably.</p>

<p>"But she is a woman," Ramón pointed out with a slight
impatience.</p>

<p>"She could send a letter just as well, couldn't she?" demanded
Andy, roused to persistence by Ramón's tone.</p>

<p>"<i>Mi madre</i> do not want to tell the <i>padre</i> these
thing to write," explained Ramón. "These are family matter," he
repeated conclusively.</p>

<p>"Why the <i>padre</i>?" Andy felt himself more and more
entangled.</p>

<p>"My mamá do not know how to do the write," said Ramón without
the least embarrassment at such a confession of ignorance; then,
catching a hint of Andy's astonishment, "For why should the
<i>señora</i> know how to do the write?" he asked reasonably.
"Always there is the <i>padre</i> to do it."</p>

<p>At this point Andy gave it up. He agreed that it was very
devoted of the so-fat Vicenta to undertake the Journey.</p>

<p>"You must be very glad, Ramón," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am glad. But, too, I am sorry. What of you,
<i>valedor</i>? How can I leave you, soul of my heart? I have ask
of Vicenta, and it is as I thought. Here you are safe. Vicenta will
not tell of you; a word to the men, they will not speak. But you
are hunted. All men are told to watch for you. Here must you estay.
It is to me very sad."</p>

<p>It was very sad to Andy also. They talked it over, but there was
no way out of the situation. Ramón must obey what amounted to a
command, even though so indirectly conveyed. Andy must remain.</p>

<p>He did not know whether he wanted to remain. Suddenly the sun
vanished. He had made a discovery: it was not the life of the
<i>rancho</i>, it was the friend. Andy was clear eyed; he never
fooled himself. The destiny of his brilliant companion could never
be long connected with this rude outpost, nor could there be much
ultimate satisfaction in such rare and brief visits as he might
manage. After Ramón had retired, Andy lingered in the <i>sala</i>.
He took the Boone gun from its pegs on the wall and laid it across
his knees. His eyes were blank to his surroundings, peering blindly
down an unknown trail.</p>

<p>At last he arose with a sigh and returned the piece to its
resting place. He had in the brief space reentered that gray land
of fatalistic acceptance to which the hard, quick life of the
mountains had accustomed his spirit, but from which he had thought
to have escaped. Still, sufficient unto the day; let the morrow
bring what it would. And the morrow of change was still at some
space distant. The immediate future at least was secure. The
<i>rodeo</i>, the <i>matanza</i>, hearty, eager weeks of
companionship shared. He would enjoy them to the full. And
thereafter? His mind slipped back to the phraseology of his
Blackfoot days. Thereafter was the affair of the Above People.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter IV Matanza</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>SUFFICIENT unto the day. Though it seemed inevitable that after
the spring <i>rodeo</i> Andy Burnett and his new California friend
must part, there remained several weeks, and tacitly they agreed to
enjoy them to the full. Probably that is why Andy made none of the
objections normal to his type and temperament when Ramón developed
a project that had been for some time near his heart. The ox-drawn
<i>carretas</i> that had come for the purpose of carrying out the
hides and tallow had brought in various simple supplies. Among them
were several personal boxes for Ramón. It appeared that he had,
after all, without consulting Andy further, sent for a full
equipment of clothes for the American, in California style, such as
Ramón himself wore. In spite of Andy's casual agreement as to the
replacement of his worn-out buckskin garments, Ramón knew his
friend well enough to anticipate some difficulty in inducing the
sober-minded mountain man to rig himself out in the glories of the
<i>californio</i>. But, to his surprise, Andy made no objection. He
wished to oblige the friend from whom he must soon separate. As for
his former austere aversion for foofaraw, that had greatly
weakened. There is something about the vitality of the Californian
scene that, even today, permits visiting Boston to wear reds and
yellows.</p>

<p>Ramón was delighted. He furnished out Andy completely, from top
to toe, even to such unessential details as a rosette on the chin
band that confined his hat. As the final touch he called in Vicenta
from the kitchen to braid a proper queue, augmented a bit by
horsehair, for Andy's own was not quite long enough. Even to this
he submitted with a certain relish, for his secret spirit liked
dress-up games; and also with a faint nostalgic sadness, for it
brought back to him the memory of the time when Kiasax and
Nit-o-ke-man had rigged him out in the full regalia of the
Blackfoot warrior and had taken him forth to visit the chiefs.</p>

<p>Ramón and Vicenta were delighted with the results of their
efforts; and the six hard-bitten <i>vaqueros</i> also admired
unreservedly Andy's appearance. Their pleasure was genuine and
childlike; so Andy was unembarrassed and also enjoyed himself and
was equally childlike. An exclamatory and pleasant time was had by
all. Indeed, with his black hair, and his black thick eyebrows
almost meeting across his forehead, and the bronze brown of his
complexion, Andy now looked more like a Californian than an
American.</p>

<p>"Except the eyes," Ramón eyed him critically, his head on one
side, "and the little whisker. And the knife. You should wear the
knife in the garter, <i>amigo</i>; not at the side."</p>

<p>"Not me; not if I'm going to use it," Andy grinned. "I'll wear
another in the garter, for looks, if you insist. But I want my own
where I can get at it."</p>

<p>"<i>Bueno</i>," agreed Ramón. "And the whisker, you shall start
him tonight."</p>

<p>Andy agreed cheerfully to start the whisker, without the
faintest pause of wonder at how astonishing, in him, this agreement
was, nor how impossible it would have been a few short months ago.
But he confessed the matter of the eyes was beyond him.</p>

<p>"But the Arrobas have eyes of gray," Vicenta pointed out to
Ramón, "as also many of the Noriegas. Me, I think Don Andres is now
a <i>caballero perfecto</i>."</p>

<p>So that made it reasonably complete. Ramón snatched the guitar
from its beam.</p>

<p>"A dance!" he cried.</p>

<p>In spite of Andy's protests he was pushed to the middle of the
floor opposite Vicenta. The <i>vaqueros</i> paired off. Andy, it
seems, was to extend his education. They took the matter seriously.
He was not an inept pupil, for his lithe powerful body was in the
balanced command that makes for grace, and Vicenta, in spite of her
too-fatness, was as light as a thistledown. Andy's first
embarrassed restraint gave way to a complete abandonment. He was
having fun, genuine fun, without reservation, without thought of
past or future. For the first time in his life he was living
whole-heartedly, light-heartedly in the present. His spirit as well
as his body arranged itself in foofaraw as a garment of pure
joy.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>BUT for the serious business of the <i>rodeo</i> and the
<i>matanza</i>, which began next day, some of the foofaraw must be
laid aside. He found that Ramón had provided also a second set of
garments, not different from the others, but plainer and more
serviceable, including a sort of divided apron of soft deerskin,
called an <i>armita</i>, which was to be worn as protection in the
rough riding through brush.</p>

<p>The work was hard and continuous, for this outlying
<i>rancho</i> was undermanned. Counting Andy there were, indeed,
only eight horsemen. They rode far and fast, urging the cattle in
toward the <i>rodeo</i> grounds to which they had been accustomed.
As fast as one horse was ridden tired, another was saddled. Once
gathered, the beasts were segregated according to class&mdash;the
unmarked calves with their mothers in one herd to be branded; the
steers to be killed, in another; those not wanted for either
purpose driven so far into the hills that they would not return to
embarrass the further operations. Here again the <i>cabestros</i>,
the tamed and gentle beasts kept habitually near the ranch house,
came into use. They were held in small groups as the nuclei to
which could be driven the selected animals cut out from the main
herd. The cattle were wild, obstinate to dash back to their
companions, inclined even to fight at times. The horsemen wormed
their way here and there in the bawling, pressing mob, quietly
following the selected beast that doubled and turned, seeking to
escape the persistent pursuit. The long-horned creatures rolled
their eyes wildly and jammed close, but offered no harm to the
mounted men, whom they would have killed instantly afoot. Little by
little the animal was edged to the clear. The horses were very
intelligent at this. A motion or two of the rider's bridle hand was
sufficient. Once they had identified the object of pursuit they
needed no further guidance. Then at the proper moment they dashed
into the full speed of pursuit. The hunted animal turned and
twisted, dodging back and forth, striving desperately to regain the
shelter of the herd. But once it had caught osight of the little
band of placid <i>cabestros</i> it galloped across the intervening
space to join them.</p>

<p>The cows were the most difficult to handle. They were worried
about their calves which, nevertheless, followed them closely. When
one was especially obstinate it was treated repeatedly to the
<i>colear</i>&mdash;the twisting upheave by the tail at full speed
by which it was upset and rolled over&mdash;until it was dispirited
enough to behave. Two men held the main herd; one was sufficient
for each of the <i>cabestro</i> bands. The others busied themselves
with the cutting.</p>

<p>Andy, to his pleasure, found himself of real use. At first he
contented himself with a job as a herdsman; but after a time he
insisted on trying the cutting-out. It was a fascinating
alternation of slow patient judgment and fast hard riding. He had
to keep his mind on it or he would have been unseated. At times his
horse turned so suddenly that his stirrup brushed the ground.</p>

<p>At nightfall four of the men rode to the <i>rancho</i> for food
and rest: the other four held the integrity of the segregated
bands. The cows and calves, however, were driven into the corral
and left to their own devices. And all day and all night long arose
the not unmelodious unremitting deep-toned bawling of the cattle to
fill the bowl of the heavens.</p>

<p>Andy took his turn at anything and enjoyed it to the full.
Especially was it pleasant to him in the hours after midnight when
the stars hung remote in a mantle of quiet, withdrawn and aloof
above the man-induced restlessness stirring in the crouching velvet
black of earth. The air was cool on his cheek, and the clean odor
of the cattle sweet in his nostrils. At this time the beasts became
somewhat quieter. Many of them lay down. He rode slowly around and
around the dim guessed mass of their forms, singing, swinging his
loop slowly back and forth from his right hand. At first he sang
because Ramón had told him that the cattle were soothed by the
sound of the human voice; then because something demanding floated
from his heart to his lips, something that must arise, like a mist
of the night, to the quietness of the stars. He hardly knew what he
sang; that did not matter&mdash;snatches of half-remembered
plaintive old-fashioned melodies from his boyhood, and before his
inner eye rose and dissolved unformed pictures, an old woman in a
rocking chair by an open window, brown earth turned beneath a plow,
and red-winged blackbirds fluting; minor savage half-voiced
cadences, and a fleeting vision of painted Blackfoot lodges against
a sunset; the quicker beat of trapper's ballad, and a strange
confusion of the red light of camp fires and sprawling figures at
ease and the feel of crisp air from mountain peaks. And in these
was no bitterness, no regret; he knew no pain of past nor
foreboding of future. He poised gratefully in the all-sufficiency
of the present moment. It filled him. He rode at peace, with upheld
cup.</p>

<p>After the cattle had been separated and the unmarked animals
branded, there remained only the business of the <i>matanza</i>:
the gathering of the annual crop. It was customary, Ramón
explained, for a well conducted <i>rancho</i> to slaughter about
four fifths of its increase each year. They were driven from the
<i>rodeo</i> to the <i>matanza</i> ground near the stream. Here
each <i>vaquero</i>, riding at full speed after his victim, struck
it skillfully with his knife in the back of the neck. Rarely did he
miss his first stroke, and rode immediately on after another. The
<i>vaqueros</i> were closely followed by three of the Indians on
foot, the <i>peladores</i>, who quickly stripped the hides from the
carcasses. Though afoot, they were protected by the herdsmen who
held together the main band. After them came, in turn, the
remaining Indians, the <i>tasajeros</i>, who cut up such of the
animal as it was desirable to save. A very limited amount of the
choicest of the meat was taken from each creature, perhaps fifty or
a hundred pounds, to be dried for emergency rations; but the tallow
was worth something. That nearest the hide, the <i>manteca</i>, was
especially prized and was dissected carefully away from the coarser
interior fat, the <i>sebo</i>. The <i>manteca</i> was of fine
quality; it could be used as cooking fat and made superior candles.
Any surplus was readily disposable to the Russians, there to the
north, who appreciated its superiorities. The <i>sebo</i> went to
the Boston ships, in trade. One could get as high as a dollar and a
half for each <i>arroba</i> (About 25 lbs) of it.</p>

<p>Behind the <i>tasajeros</i>, again, came the Indian women with
leather baskets to gather up the tallow and to load it on the
waiting <i>carreta</i>. On returning to the <i>rancho</i> theirs
the task of trying it out in great iron pots, procured from the
whalers, and running it into hide bags each of which would weigh,
when filled, some hundreds of pounds. The <i>sebo</i> tried out
easily; but the <i>manteca</i> was more delicate, required closer
attention to prevent its burning. Vicenta herself kept a distant
eye on the <i>manteca</i> kettle, and woe to its custodian if she
relaxed her vigilance for a moment's gossip!</p>

<p>As many cattle as could be thus cared for were killed each day.
The remainder were corralled for the night. They had drunk at the
stream, but had been given no opportunity to graze.</p>

<p>"It does not matter," Ramón answered Andy's expostulation. "They
are soon to die anyway." It was that puzzling blind spot again.</p>

<p>The <i>matanza</i> lasted for three days. Then the hides were
stretched for drying, the tallow tried out and run into the skin
bags, the meat cut along the grain into strips to be hung out for
jerky. The crop for the year was gathered. The <i>rancho</i> itself
would need many of the hide-strips for reatas, for building
corrals, for binding wagons, for a dozen purposes; it would use the
best of the tallow for candles, for soap, for cooking fat; it would
save a little of the jerked meat in case of expeditions beyond the
cattle country. All the rest was to be transported in the
<i>carretas</i> to the <i>hacienda</i>, there to be stored until
the arrival of a Boston ship for trade. And there, in miniature,
Andy had seen practically all the gainful business of the country.
There were, to be sure, a few productive avocations, but for
strictly home benefit. The missions and some of the more
progressive <i>hacendados</i> raised fruits, grain, a sufficiency
for themselves and everybody else, including the Russians to the
north, when they wanted to come and get it. But the majority did
not bother. Why should they?</p>

<p>There was already plenty to be had for the mere sending. The
Californians were, on the whole, rather fond of agriculture; but
what to do with more? There was no market. And Mexico, through its
governors, tried by every means to discourage foreign trade. They
clapped prohibition duties on all imports; they imposed the most
harassing regulations as to harbors and inspections. If Mexico had
its way, apparently, the Californians were to be deprived of every
luxury, every necessity, even, that could not be produced at home,
on the spot&mdash;or supplied at scandalous prices and in
inadequate quantity and quality from Mexico. That was the nub of
the situation. That was the underlying basis of the hostility, the
resentment of the Californian against the Mexican. Were it not for
a few informal local modifications, conditions would be
impossible.</p>

<p>Andy learned these things from Ramón as they rode together.
Ramón's foreign education had given him the advantage of a
perspective, an outside point of view. He was able, when he chose,
to discuss such matters intelligently. But he refused to take them
seriously as, he explained, did some of his countrymen.</p>

<p>"They get very mad," said he. "They say he's an outrage, that
Mexico keep the California by the throat and choke out of her the
life." He shrugged his shoulders and laughed. "That is
true&mdash;when you talk about it. But the <i>señorita</i>, she
have her silk and her lace and her <i>camisa</i> and her stocking
and her comb and her jewel and all those things; and the
<i>señor</i> he have all the thing he like; and in the <i>casa</i>
is mirror and table and bed and wine of France, and Spain and all
the thing people want just the same. Me, I think he's a joke to
talk that way. He's fix all right and comfortable for
everybody."</p>

<p>He went on to explain. Andy discovered, as other Americans have
been discovering ever since, that laws mean little if they run
counter to a people's feeling of justice. It was a fact that under
these laws the luxuries of living were impossible. Nevertheless,
there they were. Their presence was strictly illegal, of course,
but it was brought about very simply. A certain amount of plain
smuggling accomplished something: so smuggling had become an
esteemed occupation. But that was risky, and resorted to only by
the more adventurous, rather through love of excitement than from
necessity. Certain tacitly accepted customs were simpler, The
shipmasters carried only a portion of their cargoes readily
accessible for inspection, the rest being concealed in "secret"
places in the vessels. Or a portion of the cargo was transferred,
at one of the outlying islands, to ships that had already made
their entries and received their papers. Fictitious invoices were a
matter of course, and as no oath was demanded, even the most
puritanical Boston skipper did not hesitate to offer them.</p>

<p>Naturally these expedients were in reality very flimsy. They
would never have stood against real determination. The "secret"
hiding places on the vessels were actually merely a removal of the
goods from plain sight. Every Californian, even on the remoter
<i>ranchos</i> of the interior, was correctly informed when a
smuggler was to land on the beach at Refugio and was on hand with
his hides and tallow to purchase his fancy. As for the checking of
invoices, that was a farce, conducted at a cabin table over a glass
of wine.</p>

<p>Sometimes, a great many times, this complaisance was venial,
arranged on a percentage basis. More rarely it was a result of
common sense, when the Mexican official in charge realized
perfectly the impossibility of enforcing orders delivered
ignorantly from a perspective of thousands of miles. They made an
impressive show, as when one governor commanded that in no seaport
must any building be erected nearer to the beach than two hundred
<i>varas</i>, but no real effort toward enforcement. The regulation
named was supposed to discourage the illegitimate landing of goods.
Of course, it did nothing of the sort; but it looked well in
official reports to Mexico City.</p>

<p>But occasionally some simple-minded unimaginative
martinet&mdash;like Victoria&mdash;came along, who took things
literally. Then there was trouble. Otherwise Ramón could not see
why there was the slightest occasion for trouble. Things went along
all right. Naturally the government had to have some money to meet
its expenses. Naturally the officials wanted to make something for
themselves out of their offices. There were no taxes whatever, and
nothing from Mexico. The missions were there to contribute, surely;
but even the fattest cow gives only so much milk.</p>

<p>Andy was no great stickler for legality; but he had breathed in
with his boyhood the Anglo-Saxon passion for regulated form. He was
a little doubtful and even a trifle shocked at all this.</p>

<p>"You should talk to my cousin, Guadalupe," said Ramón
carelessly. "He reads books, and he get very excite over what he
call the rights of man. Why make the fuss?"</p>

<p>Andy did not really know. He was not even coherent enough to be
able to tell Ramón the real reason for their difference; that he
was of the race that makes a fuss about intangibles, and Ramón was
not.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>All that, however, had nothing to do with the <i>matanza</i>,
nor what must happen next. The labor was drawing to a close. On the
following day the laden <i>carretas</i> would begin their shrieking
journey back to the <i>hacienda</i>, and Ramón soon must
follow.</p>

<p>The last day Ramón, Andy, and all the <i>vaqueros</i> rode
together over the hills to the south, ostensibly for a look around.
Each was keenly conscious that this was their last ride; each still
avoided speaking of what must soon be discussed.</p>

<p>They returned to the ranch house to find it occupied by the
Mexican lieutenant, Cortilla, with a detachment of soldiers; and
the circumstances were such that they were not aware of this fact
until too late for retreat or concealment. Andy was able merely to
rein back into the group of <i>vaqueros</i> whence he could watch
for a chance to slip away before he was observed. He did not dare
make a dash for it on his wearied horse: besides which he had no
intention of leaving the Boone gun on the wall. The
<i>vaqueros</i>, understanding the situation, closed about him. If
it came to a showdown, there were as many Californians as Mexicans,
and Andy had confidence his new friends would prove stanch. He was
confirmed in his decision by Ramón, who was talking sign language
for his benefit.</p>

<p>So he rode quietly to the ranch house with the others, unsaddled
his horse, hung the equipment on its pegs. He kept himself as much
in the background as possible, held his head low. It seemed that he
need not have bothered. Cortilla was much too important in his own
eyes to do more than glance briefly at the <i>vaqueros</i>. His
attention was all for Ramón.</p>

<p>Andy could hear nothing of what they said to one another. He got
merely an impression of elaborate ceremony, in which he seemed to
detect a veiled hostility on the part of the soldier and a flavor
of irony on the part of the Californian. Then they disappeared into
the <i>sala</i>.</p>

<p>Since the <i>patrón</i> entertained a distinguished guest, the
<i>vaqueros</i> did not intrude. They ate their meal on the
veranda; Andy and the Mexican soldiers among them. The American
held himself silent and in the background. Nobody paid him any
attention. He learned from the conversation that it was supposed
that this was a patrol to inspect the state of the border. No one
really knew, except Cortilla, and he had not taken his men into his
confidence. Certainly it was not a campaign against the Indians,
for always they had slept at mission or <i>rancho</i>. Unless, of
course, they were now to proceed on across the valley. This was the
outermost <i>rancho</i>.</p>

<p>"Which saints forbid, and which I do not think," hoped the most
talkative. "I am a shrewd one: I have my idea."</p>

<p>"What is that, <i>amigo</i>?" inquired Panchito courteously.</p>

<p>The head <i>vaquero</i> leaned over to fill the Mexican's cup
with <i>aguardiente</i>. From some mysterious store a bottle of
that fiery liquor had appeared. Contrary to general belief, the
Californian of that day was abstemious, both as to food and drink;
and this was the first strong liquor Andy had seen since he had
entered the country.</p>

<p>"He seeks news," said the Mexican.</p>

<p>"Truly?" said Panchito. "And news of what?"</p>

<p>The Mexican did not answer at once. He arose, walked, humming
under his breath, to the veranda's edge, peered upward at the
stars, picked his way across the half recumbent forms to reseat
himself deliberately at Andy's side.</p>

<p>"Why," he remarked pleasantly at last, "of a tall devil of an
<i>americano</i> whom the governor would have arrested for travel
without <i>permiso</i> and whom the <i>señor</i> lieutenant would
like well to see for reasons of his own." He turned suddenly to
Andy. "You have seen none such, <i>señor</i>?"</p>

<p>Andy's muscles tightened.</p>

<p>"No, <i>señor</i>," he replied.</p>

<p>At this moment Vicenta thrust aside the hanging <i>serape</i>
and stood in the lighted doorway, peering out.</p>

<p>"Largo," she called, "Don Ramón summons Largo."</p>

<p>Andy hesitated, then arose to his feet and made his way through
the <i>vaqueros</i> and soldiers. He could see nothing of them but
the glow of their cigarette ends, but he seemed to himself to sense
a sudden electric tension. He stooped beneath the <i>serape</i> and
entered the <i>sala</i>.</p>

<p>Ramón and Cortilla sat at the table. Between them were bottles,
both of <i>aguardiente</i> and wine. Ramón leaned back, cool,
compact, and alert. Cortilla sprawled, half unbuttoned, obviously a
trifle drunk. Andy, blinking in the light, noticed these things;
and one other&mdash;that the long rifle had disappeared from its
pegs on the wall.</p>

<p>His mind was working rapidly and smoothly in the grooves of his
old wariness, coolly appraising the situation and its
possibilities. Except for his knife he was unarmed. Nevertheless,
he had no immediate fear of arrest. The people of the <i>rancho</i>
could easily see that did not happen; and it is significant that
not for one moment did Andy's faith in his friend's loyalty waver.
But that would involve them openly, perhaps render them, too,
outlaw. This must be prevented: but how? What was he supposed to
do? Through the other door of the <i>sala</i>, toward the kitchen,
he could step into freedom for the moment. But what then? Was that
what Ramón wanted him to do? Was that why he had been summoned? He
moved catlike to a position in the shadows behind the Mexican and
fixed his eyes on the young Californian, alert to catch a hint. But
Ramón summoned him, motioning him carelessly to stand before him in
the full light of observation. Andy hesitated. Surely this was
sheer recklessness. He glanced toward the bottles.</p>

<p>"Stand here, Largo," insisted Ramón impatiently. To hesitate
longer would be worse than obedience. Andy faced the two men.</p>

<p>"My head <i>vaquero</i>," said Ramón.</p>

<p>The Mexican glanced at him idly and with complete
indifference.</p>

<p>"Largo," said Ramón, "our guests depart in the morning. You will
see that they have fresh horses, of the best. Understand?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>."</p>

<p>"That is all." Ramón dismissed him.</p>

<p>Andy turned to the door toward the kitchens, his eyes fixed
keenly on his friend. The latter nodded approval. "Wait there," he
signed swiftly in hand talk.</p>

<p>Andy went out. Leaning against the wall, he smoked, staring out
into the velvet night. He did not trouble himself with idle
speculation. What would come must come. He merely held himself in
readiness.</p>

<p>After an hour Ramón joined him. The Californian was laughing
softly. He hooked an arm through Andy's elbow and drew him away to
some distance.</p>

<p>"Now there is a dumb-head, if you will," said he. "He looked
straight at you and did not know you. That I wished to see."</p>

<p>"Was that why you had me in?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"But surely. It is better to know. Then we cut our cloth."</p>

<p>"What if he had known me?"</p>

<p>"That is arrange. You come out that door. La Vicenta take you by
the hand. You find your horse, your gun, all your thing. You ride
away to the hill. Me, I am astonish. I saddle my horse, and all of
us&mdash;<i>el señor comandante</i>, his soldier, Panchito, and the
<i>vaqueros</i>, we ride like hell in the valley. We have fine
<i>pasear</i>; you have nice pick-a-nick. By and by you come back.
But he don't know you at all. Now soon they go away. You
remain."</p>

<p>"I think perhaps I'd better go away," said Andy. "It is
simpler."</p>

<p>"It is more simple, but he is not so much esport," said Ramón.
"See, in the morning you shall bring to el <i>señor</i> lieutenant
Jesus Maria Corbedo de Cortilla his horse, and you shall hold him
his estirrup for him, and it shall be one great laugh for us."</p>

<p>But Andy was not educated to that point as yet. He refused
firmly to lend himself to this exquisite jest. Furthermore, he
insisted on going at once to the corral and seeing for himself that
the arrangements described by Ramón were in order. He felt much
better when again the Boone gun was in his grasp. Ramón was frankly
disappointed.</p>

<p>"But, <i>amigo</i>," he pleaded, "think how we shall tell the
estory of how this so great Cortilla ride to seek you, and you do
hold his estirrup for him to mount; and I think maybe he give you a
<i>peso</i>." He moaned over the loss of so magnificent a
conceit.</p>

<p>But Andy was obstinate.</p>

<p>"Besides," he added, "I think one of his men recognized me."</p>

<p>"How was that?" asked Ramón, instantly serious. He listened
attentively to Andy's account of what had happened.</p>

<p>"I do not think so," said he, "but in the morning we shall
know."</p>

<p>Reluctantly he agreed that perhaps it might be well for Andy to
pass the night apart in the clear. But in the morning the American
must be at hand when the party rode off. Ramón was insistent on
this point.</p>

<p>"No, this time it is not for a joke," he became resolved; "it is
for an idea I have. You may sit upon your horse: you shall have the
<i>palomino</i> which is so swift no one shall catch him. This you
must do for me. I ask you, <i>como amigo</i>."</p>

<p>Andy at last had to yield, though he was disgruntled, and took
no pains to conceal the fact. The performance seemed to him inane,
idiotic, of a piece with Ramón's ordinarily engaging harebrained
recklessness. And to subserve no earthly good purpose. It speaks
much for the quality of affection with which the Californian had
filled his lonely heart that he finally agreed. Not that he lacked
confidence in his own escape, if escape proved necessary, as he had
no doubt it would. But Andy had an ordered mind: he disliked
useless hazards. He tried in vain to dig out of Ramón his "idea,"
but Ramón chose to be aggravatingly mysterious.</p>

<p>"That you shall see!" he cried. He was in higher feather over
Andy's reluctant consent, clapped his friend on the back, departed
chuckling.</p>

<p>Andy disgustedly but methodically made a few simple
preparations. He deposited the Boone gun and its ammunition and
some small necessities in a live oak fork whence he could snatch it
at speed. Then he lay down to sleep beneath another tree at some
distance from the <i>rancho</i>. In the morning he saddled the
<i>palomino</i> and mounted. For an hour he waited, sitting like a
statue on the well trained patient horse. From the ranch house at
last emerged the officer and Ramón. After a time all was ready. The
little command moved by. Ramón, in his capacity of host, rode at
Cortilla's left. He would, according to custom, see them over the
next hill crest. They jogged by Andy at the shuffling Spanish trot.
Cortilla did not even glance in his direction. Obviously he had no
further information as to Andy, and the latter had about concluded
the episode finished when one of the troopers turned his horse
aside. He rode directly to the man on the <i>palomino</i> and
reined it to a stop. Andy's muscles stiffened.</p>

<p>"You do not know me, <i>señor</i>?" murmured the soldier
silkily.</p>

<p>"No, <i>señor</i>," returned Andy.</p>

<p>"But we have made acquaintance." The Mexican eyed him. Andy
stared back stoutly. "Yet I knew nothing, nothing," continued the
trooper after a moment's pause. "I have said nothing. Why? Because
you have made in me a friend. Why? Because you have so well
chastised that one, and I have been there to see and rejoice. Why
have I rejoiced? Because that one is a pig."</p>

<p>"Blessed be pigs," said Andy in English.</p>

<p>"What is that you say, <i>señor</i>?"</p>

<p>"I say, <i>gracias, señor</i>."</p>

<p>"These things I desire that you know."</p>

<p>"Pedro!" bellowed Cortilla, turning in his saddle. "Cow of the
world! What do you with that man? Join your rank!"</p>

<p>"Coming, <i>señor</i> lieutenant!" The trooper turned his horse.
"And so, go with God, <i>señor</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Vaya con Dios</i>," Andy called after him.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>RAMÓN hurried back from his ride of courtesy as soon as he
possibly could. He was full of his "idea," and was very much dashed
at Andy's cold reception of the same. The "idea" was dazzlingly
simple. Since Andy had passed unrecognized in his "disguise" as a
Californian, further concealment was unnecessary, and he could now
journey at will whither his fancy called; which would be, of
course, the <i>hacienda</i> and the company of Ramón.</p>

<p>It was like slapping an eager child in the face to point out
that the thing would not work. Nor was Ramón easily persuaded. Andy
had to be almost brutal about it.</p>

<p>"I wish it could be," he said seriously, "but it is not sense.
Just because Cortilla did not look squarely at me is no reason I'd
escape recognition long," he pointed out. "Consider a moment how
many people would see me, would hear me talk. They would be pretty
dumb not to suspect. One of the soldiers knew me. Yes, I told you
he did. He told me so, but that he had said nothing because he
hated Cortilla. But he is sure to tell someone, his best friend, or
someone he drinks with, that I am going about dressed in California
fashion. And even at your home, a chance visitor, a traveler, one
of your Indians, anybody who is not a blind fool could see that I
am not what I seem, and once the news is afoot..."</p>

<p>Ramón had to yield at last to plain common sense. He did so
reluctantly, petulantly, with the resentment of a thwarted
child.</p>

<p>"<i>Diablo!</i>" He threw up both hands at last. "All right! all
right! Have it your own way. Stop the talk!&mdash;stop the talk!
Such a buzz of words! But this you admit: that so long as you ride
on the horse and do not pass near people or talk to them they will
take you for <i>californio</i>. That you admit?"</p>

<p>"Why, I expect so," Andy laughed, "but I can't go forever riding
at full speed up and down California, like the Flying
Dutchman."</p>

<p>"<i>Bueno</i>!" Ramón cried. "Then we go. Panchito!" he called
to the head <i>vaquero</i>, "a <i>remuda</i>, <i>pronto</i>! We go!
Come," he urged Andy. "Prepare! We go!"</p>

<p>"Where?" Andy wanted, reasonably enough, to know.</p>

<p>"We go to see Viador."</p>

<p>"Viador?"</p>

<p>"He is the <i>padre</i> at the mission of Santa Clara. We shall
go to see him. It is easy. It is not too far. If we go quickly we
shall arrive before vesper. You shall speak to nobody. We shall
sleep there. Then we shall return. It is very easy."</p>

<p>"But what good will it do to see him or anybody else?" Andy's
common sense persisted. "What could he do about it?"</p>

<p>"<i>Madre de Dios!</i>" cried Ramón, out of patience. "How can I
tell you that? If I knew that, why should I go to ask him? He is
<i>el sabio</i>, the wise one. You shall see."</p>

<p>Panchito rode up, driving a dozen loose horses before him.
"Come!" said Ramón. "We go!"</p>

<p>However, Andy was not to be rushed completely off his feet. He
would go. What could it matter? At least it would postpone the
inevitable for a day or two. Andy's vision of himself was very
clear. After this beautiful interlude, back to his old life he must
go, the only life he knew and to which he was fitted. Therefore, in
spite of Ramón's impatience, he rode to the live oak tree and
reclaimed the long rifle and the bundle of his necessities from
their hiding place. Ramón was in despair.</p>

<p>"But you cannot take with you that thing!" he expostulated. "You
who have the so-great and so-cold common sense. When the peoples
see that they must know you for what you are. No <i>californio</i>
carries such a thing. As well Panchito ride ahead crying in a big
voice that <i>el americano</i> is coming."</p>

<p>For once the common sense was with Ramón. Nevertheless, Andy was
obstinate, deaf to argument. He would not be separated from the
Boone gun. If he could not take it with him, he would refuse the
journey. Secretly he had no faith in it, nor that he would ever
return to the <i>rancho</i>. Ramón had to give in; but he did so
with ill grace.</p>

<p>"Always you get in trouble with that thing," he grumbled,
"always, always!"</p>

<p>He washed his hands of the affair. He refused to make
suggestions. He sulked. Panchito came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"I shall carry it, Don Ramón," said he, "wrapped in a
<i>serape</i>, and nobody will see."</p>

<p>"And everybody will wonder what a <i>vaquero</i> does with such
a bundle and what is in it," growled Ramón, unappeased.</p>

<p>"Nobody will care what a <i>vaquero</i> carries," replied
Panchito.</p>

<p>"Have it as you will!" cried the young man. "<i>María
Santísima!</i> Let us go! But it will make you trouble!" he
predicted gloomily; "that you shall see!"</p>

<p>For the first time Andy saw him genuinely out of temper.</p>

<p>That fitted in well enough with the somber bitterness of his own
mood.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>BUT even the worst of humors could not have withstood the
exhilaration of such a journey. Ramón shortly recovered his gay
spirits. Andy thrust the gray curtain of the inevitable enough back
to be able to enjoy the present while it lasted. They rode at a
fast gallop, never drawing rein except for the occasional change to
fresh horses from the <i>remuda</i>. This, Andy was to learn, was
the invariable method of travel in California, and by its means
enormous distances could be covered in a day. The season was well
advanced. The hills were awave with green grasses; bright with the
blue of lupin, the orange of poppies, the yellow of wild mustard.
The sky was blue; the air like wine. Birds, little and big, sprang
startled before the flying hoofs; jack rabbits scuttled away.
Cattle and horses threw up their heads to stare; but the wild
cavalcade had swept by before they could gather their scattered
wits to flight. Up the slopes, down the hills, plunging into and
out of the shallow streams without a check, the horsemen fled. The
swirl of their going was like a sudden wind through the leaves,
stirring life into momentary whirling fragments that settled again
to placidity when they had passed. Some of the fragments caught at
them, half attended, a snatch of bird song cut short, a glimpse of
a deer poised for flight, but gone astern before it had moved from
its tracks, a stream of consciousness rushing by, its components
stricken to immobility by speed. Steadily the countryside unrolled
before them. The grassy hills reared higher, were covered with
brush, then with a darker scattered forest. They closed to a cañon;
they opened to a narrow plain sloping to wide waters; and far
across them more hills, blue with distance.</p>

<p>Cattle became more numerous. Their trails cut the earth deeply
in many directions. Here and there, in the distance, Andy saw
groups of houses on the hills, and smoke rising. They passed a
number of <i>vaqueros</i> riding in pairs, who shouted at them a
greeting, and were answered. But they did not draw rein. Beyond the
foot of the bay they turned across flat lands, forded a creek,
perforce slackened pace among the tules where the wild fowl arose
in swarms, emerged to hard ground. In the distance showed the green
of a long double row of willow trees, and beyond them the red of
tiles and the white of numerous buildings and walls. Ramón slowed
his horse.</p>

<p>"Santa Clara," said he.</p>

<p>The sun still lacked an hour to setting.</p>

<p>They jogged forward at a more sober pace. Shortly they came to
cultivated lands. Indian men were at labor in the fields. They were
dressed in a uniform like that of the ox drivers who had conducted
Ramón's <i>carreta</i>s&mdash;blue cotton trousers, cotton shirts,
a head band. A few wore rough shoes of rawhide; but most were
barefoot. They stared stupidly at the horsemen, but one man, no
different in appearance from the rest, saluted them in sonorous
Spanish. This was the <i>capataz</i>, the overseer, Ramón
carelessly explained.</p>

<p>They entered the long avenue of willows that led to the walls of
the mission. A sudden loud clamor behind them caused them to draw
hastily aside. Andy stared astonished. Past him at full speed swept
a most singular equipage, a light-wheeled vehicle to which was
attached a large black mule. The mule was ridden by a small Indian
boy, presumably for its guidance, though at the moment he was
clinging desperately to retain his seat. The guidance was furnished
by a <i>vaquero</i> who rode in the lead, towing the mule by means
of a reata about the beast's neck. As the noose of the reata had
tightened partially to choke and therefore to bewilder the mule,
the said guidance was more by main strength than persuasion; nor
did the devoted animal, hanging back against its tormentors,
furnish much motive power to the vehicle. That was taken care of by
two other <i>vaqueros</i>, riding on either side, who had attached
their reatas to the front axle tree. What the black mule and the
small Indian boy were supposed to contribute, unless it might be
honor and glory, was obscure to Andy. The carriage slewed and
swooped wildly from one side to another in short lunges,
threatening collision with the trees until brought up short by the
bulk and weight of the mule. Perhaps that is what it was for. At
brief intervals it was rammed by the carriage from the rear.
Whereupon the lead <i>vaquero</i> spurred ahead to frustrate the
exasperated beast's obvious desire to kick the whole thing into
kindling wood. In spite of these subsidiary and interval reactions
the whole unit swept forward at an astonishing speed.</p>

<p>Andy caught no more than a glimpse of the carriage's occupant, a
fat white-haired man in priest's robe, with a benign and
undisturbed countenance. Obviously he had no spiritual connection
whatever with all this row and crash and headlong imminent
disaster. He might have been riding in a shallop drawn by swans. At
sight of Ramón and his companions he raised the two fingers of
benediction and was gone in a swirl and cloud of dust. Andy turned
round eyes of astonishment toward his friend.</p>

<p>"That is Father Viador," said Ramón.</p>

<p>"The man we have come to see?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Humph!" Andy grunted. Then a reluctant grin overspread his
face. "Obviously a very holy man," said he.</p>

<p>"That is true. But why say you that?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Andy dryly, in Spanish, "if he were not very holy
indeed, I do not think the saints would indulge him with the
miracle of riding in that thing safely."</p>

<p>Panchito grinned in appreciation, and Ramón shouted.</p>

<p>"Always it does the heart good to hear from you, the so-serious
one, the <i>burla</i>," he cried delightedly. "That is in all
California the only <i>calesa</i>. The good father is very proud of
it. You must compliment him on it."</p>

<p>"That I shall do," returned Andy, "for I think the <i>calesa</i>
another miracle that it has not flown to pieces long ago."</p>

<p>Ramón, with a thrust of his fist, cocked his hat jauntily askew
and, still chuckling, led the way through the mission gates.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>ANDY had scant opportunity to look about him, for the little
party was immediately surrounded by Indians of apparently the
better class. One held Andy's horse by the bit; another deftly
removed the large spurs from his heels; a third steadied his
stirrup while he dismounted, disengaged his <i>cantinas</i> from
the saddle. The moment his foot touched the earth, all the horses
and equipment were whisked away through the gate. A grave-faced
majordomo, probably a half-breed, Andy thought, stood before them
waiting.</p>

<p>"You are welcome, <i>señores viageros. Pax vobiscum</i>."</p>

<p>"And with you, peace," responded Ramón in Spanish. The man, with
a courteous gesture, turned to lead the way. The courtyard, as wide
as a field, afforded room for many activities. The mission church,
flanked by a long arched colonnade, to which opened doors and
barred windows, occupied all of one side. Two others were bordered
by buildings of various sizes, some of which seemed to be
workshops, and others were large enough to be used as dormitories
or assembly rooms. The fourth side was merely a strong adobe wall
crowned with the same red tiles that roofed all the buildings. A
flowing fountain cut from stone stood before the church. Indian men
and women were hurrying back and forth across the square. A number
of <i>vaqueros</i>; in whom Spanish blood predominated, squatted on
their heels against the pillars of the colonnade.</p>

<p>The majordomo led them down this colonnade to the end of the
wing, where he showed them the doors of two rooms. The Indians who
had been pattering along behind silently deposited the light
<i>cantinas</i> and departed.</p>

<p>"Here be the Travelers' Rooms. Rest with God, <i>señores</i>,"
said he, and turned to go, motioning Panchito to follow. But Andy
darted forward to reclaim the long rifle, wrapped in the
<i>serape</i>; nor would he listen to expostulation.</p>

<p>"Always that brings trouble," grumbled Ramón.</p>

<p>They entered one of the rooms together. It was clean, bare,
tiled, furnished most simply with bed, chair, and table. On the
wall hung a crucifix and a framed colored print of Santa Clara. The
only openings, the door and a window barred with iron, were toward
the court. An Indian woman brought a ewer of baked red clay filled
with water, and a basin of metal. Another set upon the table a
plate with two oranges and a flask of wine. To Andy this was almost
oriental magnificence; for the only oranges he had seen in all his
life were during his expedition with Jedediah Smith. Ramón was
pleased at his surprise; boasted a little the more to impress his
friend. He informed Andy that he could, if he wished&mdash;and if
there were no Cortilla, he interpolated&mdash;ride from one end of
California to the other and be received at the close of each day's
easy travel at one of the missions where he would receive similar
entertainment, without cost or price, for himself and his horses.
Indeed, at some of the more generous or more opulent
establishments, if his animals were over-weary, fresh ones would be
supplied at his departure. Or he could stay as long as he wished.
Not only were Travelers' Rooms, like these, kept for the purpose,
but the fruit came from the Travelers' Orchard, planted especially
for wayfarers. From it, a little later, Ramón said, they would have
had a great variety&mdash;figs, grapes, pomegranates, peaches,
pears&mdash;but this was not the season.</p>

<p>A bell began to ring.</p>

<p>"Come," said Ramón, "it is the vesper. We must attend."</p>

<p>The courtyard was a-crawl with groups of men and women
sauntering slowly toward the dark opening of the church door, into
which they disappeared. Soon the square was empty, except for a
half-dozen <i>vaqueros</i> hastily trying to finish some sort of
gambling game about which they were grouped. Ramón and Andy,
ascending the broad stone steps before the church door, stood aside
as the bulky figure of the hero of the <i>calesa</i> suddenly
emerged. His eye swept the spaces of the courtyard, fell upon the
intent <i>vaqueros</i> over by the wall. His nostrils widened to
emit a low trumpeting sound. Ramón laid his hand on Andy's arm.</p>

<p>"Wait," he whispered. "Here you shall see esport."</p>

<p>As though the snort emitted by the good <i>padre</i> had been a
signal, suddenly and mysteriously appeared the black mule, led by
the diminutive Indian child. Evidently the beast had been held
concealed behind one of the wide buttresses to the bell tower. It
had been divested of its harness and now was gayly caparisoned in
saddle and silvered headdress. The <i>padre</i> shortened the
skirts of his robe through his girdle and with astonishing agility
for one of his bulk swung into the saddle. From the hands of the
Indian child he took the handle of a long-lashed whip.</p>

<p>Then he guided the black mule stealthily across the court-yard
toward the unconscious gamblers. When within a few yards he visibly
gathered himself for action and suddenly charged down upon them
with a roar.</p>

<p>"Ha, <i>pesados!</i>" he shouted. "Ha, <i>impios!</i>"</p>

<p>He laid at them with the lash of the whip, continuing to bellow
most unecclesiastical imprecations. They scattered like quail,
scuttling toward the sanctuary of the church door. The <i>padre</i>
followed after as fast as he could urge the black mule, herding
them as one herds wild cattle, striving to reach them with the
braided lash. The mule bored at the bit, was obviously out of all
patience with so many changes of direction, turned too late if at
all, overran, generally carried the good father where he had no
desire to go, after the fashion of independent-minded mules
everywhere. The men ducked and dodged, laughing consumedly,
slipping under the threat of the whip, at last darting through the
door like rabbits into a warren. The <i>padre</i>, with some
difficulty, brought the mule to a halt, dismounted, trumpeted again
through his nostrils, pulled his robe down to cover his stout hairy
legs. He was puffing heavily from his exertions. Andy was amused at
the performance but also faintly contemptuous. It was this buffoon
who was to solve his difficulties!</p>

<p>Then, as the priest neared the doorway, his great body
straightened to a solemn dignity; he threw back his head. A spirit
seemed to descend upon him. Andy, shocked to a faint surprise,
instinctively bowed his head.</p>

<p>The small Indian boy slipped the reins of the mule's bridle
through a ring in the wall and followed close at the priest's
heels. His face was expressionless with the true Indian stolidity,
but as he passed Andy the young man recognized something familiar
lurking in the depths of the child's eyes. Shortly he remembered
it. It was the fatuous and supervirtuous complacency of the
<i>cabestros</i>, the tamed cattle used to subdue the wild
ones.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>THE interior of the church was narrow, high, and dark. Most of
the illumination came from the altar candles, though from a few
high windows a little of paler daylight filtered down through the
gloom. There were no chairs or benches. Men knelt on one side,
women on the other, with a narrow aisle between, up and down which
prowled ceaselessly the majordomo, watching behavior. When Andy's
eyes became accustomed, he made out crude paintings on the walls,
of saints and sinners in hell and in heaven.</p>

<p>Father Viador conducted the services with a transforming
dignity, even with a certain majesty. In the pure faith of his
office he stood transformed. Andy&mdash;or indeed any other of
those present&mdash;made nothing of the Latin; but no one, even the
dumbest savage of a new-caught gentile, but was perceptive of, and
to a certain extent uplifted by, the sheer piety and sincerity of
the man. Of the burly, bullying, reckless, swashbuckling master of
the black mule remained no trace.</p>

<p>Nor was this effect in the slightest marred by his vigilant
supervision of the church music. This was supplied by several
violins and guitars and two flutes. They were played by Indians,
very painstakingly and in the main correctly. Andy, of course,
could have no conception of what a triumph in training the raw
savage this represented.</p>

<p>The <i>padre</i> listened closely to the performance. Twice,
without ceremony, he stopped it abruptly to scold a performer for
missing the rhythm or for striking a false note. Once he even
darted forward, with the agility so astonishing in one of his bulk,
to rap a culprit sharply on the head with the knuckle of his middle
finger. When the thing went well, he listened, obviously pleased,
his head on one side, his forefinger unconsciously beating the
rhythm. Nevertheless, these schoolmaster interruptions in no manner
disturbed the high serenity, the lofty flow of the spirit in which
he moved. And the kneeling worshipers crossed themselves and bowed
their heads; nor smiled nor raised their eyes.</p>

<p>Andy's first amusement was sobered. To his own inner surprise he
found himself sinking&mdash;or rising&mdash;to the level of these
simple people about him. A faith crept into his heart, not of these
rites strange to him, not of any mystic meaning of what he was
seeing and hearing; but quite simply of the man. In spite of the
utter futility and the very real risk, he was glad now he had made
the journey. This was irrational, but it was so. Andy was not
accustomed to irrationalities. His life had taught him to face
practical difficulties in a practical manner, to depend for his
salvation on his own quick brain and his own keen eyes and his own
strong right arm; to trust no man's judgment above his own. A few
leaders he had followed had proved themselves to him as such by the
deeds of their days. Until that proof he had moved warily and
alone. And even to those leaders his independence bowed only in the
expedience of the moment: he still held himself proudly as the
equal to any. That independence was the very fiber of his being.
But here was a man, a fat man, in the despised robes of a priest,
with whom he had exchanged no word as yet, whose only observed
activities up to now had been to conduct a black mule rather badly,
whom Andy found himself unquestioningly ready to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Andy shook himself angrily; turned his head to stare at the
depiction above him of the sinners bathed to the waist in the
flames of hell. The crudity of the daub stirred his sense of humor.
The spell was broken.</p>

<p>The bells overhead began to ring. Ramón touched his elbow. They
arose stiffly from the tiles of the floor. The Indians waited
respectfully for the <i>caballeros</i> to pass.</p>

<p>On the flat stone platform before the door the two young men
paused. The walled square was darkening, and the figures of the
people pouring across it from the church became wraithlike, as
though they were of one substance with the dusk. Over the wall were
the tops of willow trees against the sky, and through a single gap
in their planting he saw the tops of eastern mountains, soft rose
color under the last caress of the sun. They were very beautiful;
but at sight of them Andy fell somber again. They brought back to
him too vividly his old solitary life&mdash;the traps in their
sacks, the buckskin on his back, the long rifle across his
saddlebow. Adventurous loneliness&mdash;he suddenly hated it, with
a strength of bitterness that surprised him.</p>

<p>Ramón turned aside to speak to an old Indian. And, unheralded,
out of the acuteness of his loneliness stole the shadow of
something familiar...It had happened to him before...The clear
crest of the Rockies under the moon...He must hold very quiet, very
still...</p>

<p>Gentle power, that was it, the feel of it...like his
grandmother...</p>

<p>He had obeyed it unquestioningly before. He had lived out his
life of the mountain man, had shared great deeds and from them
escaped unscathed. And in the end the vision of destiny had blurred
and broken like a spent wave in what seemed tragic futility. So he
had wandered on, uninspired, led only by an instinct for escape and
rest, emptied, the tide at ebb.</p>

<p>And here was that power again, lifting him mysteriously to a
perception of greater destiny to which his own was linked. There
was no vision, no clairvoyance of detail or circumstance. Gently he
was lifted on a mighty wave. New power, new anticipation, new eager
courage flooded his soul. And absolute certainty. Here he belonged;
and here he was to stay, to the fulfillment of further destiny
prepared. Gently the wave set him down again. Once more he stood on
the flat stone platform before the little church. The whole
experience had passed between two strokes of the sonorous bell over
his head.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter V. El Sabio</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>ANDY understood from Ramón that, so far from having any
influence, the missions were at outs with the civil powers. The
latter were busily passing new laws and exhuming old ones designed
to appropriate the mission lands, cattle, fields, and crops. They
did not call it that; they called it secularization; and they
rationalized so well that a great many disinterested people thought
it the proper thing to do. Ramón, whose foreign education had made
him clear sighted beyond the provincialism of his countrymen,
talked a little of it to Andy as the two sat on the coping of the
fountain, after vespers, awaiting the call to the evening meal.</p>

<p>"It is said," he explained in his own tongue, "that the good
friars should be relieved of the burden of temporal managements so
that they may give all their time and energy to the spiritual
duties. That is the argument for those who are of great piety. It
is also said that the Fathers have held the land only in trust for
the Indians until they should become civilized enough to manage
them for themselves; and that now they are civilized enough and
should be given charge of the riches they have made&mdash;under
direction of the <i>padres</i>. That is for them who make a great
point of law. It is said further that these Indians are the noble
savage with the soul equal before the sight of God, and they are
enslaved against their will, and I do not know what other argument,
all of which comes from France and a man there who writes books,
named Rousseau. Very few have read the books, but they talk just
the same of what they call the Rights of Man. That is for the young
idle men of generous spirit who sit about the wine table and argue
much. Then it is said that the <i>padres</i> are cruel to the
Indians, and beat them much, and torture them, and make them die in
great numbers. That is whispered. And it is made much of that the
<i>padres</i> are nearly all Spanish men, and that they work for
Spain against the Republic. That is for the patriot and also for
the man who is afraid. They make many kinds of talk for many kinds
of people."</p>

<p>"What do you think, Ramón?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>The young Californian laughed.</p>

<p>"Me? I think that the missions have many cattle and many leagues
of land, and that they are rich from trading and from the making of
things, and that in those riches is a magic that can make an
elephant of a flea."</p>

<p>He would express no further opinion; but he made it sufficiently
clear that from the Church, in the present state of affairs,
nothing could be hoped in the way of political influence. Rather
the contrary. It was, Andy reflected, rather late in the day to
tell him these things.</p>

<p>An Indian stood before them, bowing. "<i>Comida, señores</i>,"
said he respectfully.</p>

<p>They followed him to the long narrow room of the refectory,
where they took their places at table with Father Viador and three
other friars. Except for a grace said in Latin, the meal was eaten
in silence. The visitors attracted no especial attention. As long
as Andy was not called upon to speak, he passed well enough for
what he seemed. At the close of the repast, the <i>padre</i> Viador
signaled them to follow him. They accompanied him down the dusky
colonnade to a room at the far end, into which the burly priest
ushered them with a bow of ceremonial politeness. It was a large
apartment, plainly furnished, relieved from austerity only by a
number of comfortable chairs and a shelf of books, and by the fact
that on the table awaited a flask of wine and three glasses.</p>

<p>"Welcome, my son," said the friar to Ramón, "welcome as
always."</p>

<p>He uttered a formal benediction in Latin, to which Ramón
listened with bowed head, stooped to kiss the young man lightly on
both cheeks.</p>

<p>"And you, <i>señor extranjero</i>," he turned to Andy, "you also
are welcome, and may the good Lord bring you peace."</p>

<p>His manner was stately, exquisite with a high ceremonial of
courtesy. Then abruptly he dropped into one of the chairs, loosened
the cord about his waist, reached for the wine flask from which he
filled the three glasses. The formality fell from him. He turned
upon the two young men a quizzically humorous countenance.</p>

<p>"But sit!" he cried, "and tell me how it happens you are here,
<i>hijo mío</i>, Is all forgiven? Has the Señor Rivera laid aside
his dark spectacles? Are you free again to get yourself into more
troubles? Ah, you shall come to no good end, my Ramón! I must read
to you what is said of obedience." He sipped at his wine and
chuckled. "And now what mischief is afoot, and what penitence must
I place upon you next? Confess, now, and be absolved."</p>

<p>"There is no mischief, Father," replied Ramón seriously.</p>

<p>"No mischief? That I cannot believe. When otherwise did Ramón
ever turn to the Church?"</p>

<p>"This is serious, <i>padre</i>," said Ramón. "I come on behalf
of my friend."</p>

<p>Father Viador turned and examined Andy. All at once Andy
recognized that up to now the priest had carefully refrained from
looking in his direction, and realized that this pointed avoidance
was actually a subtle courtesy until Ramón should choose to explain
his presence.</p>

<p>"Ah, your friend," repeated the friar, "<i>el
americano</i>."</p>

<p>Ramón uttered a short ejaculation of disappointment,</p>

<p>Father Viador's eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"You do too little justice to my wits, my son," said he. "The
appearance is well enough; it will pass&mdash;for those who have
not thought that two and two make four. And who have not so often
heard the confession of Ramón Rivera."</p>

<p>He threw back his head in a great roar of jolly laughter at the
young man's puzzled expression. He held up one hand and touched its
forefinger with the forefinger of the other.</p>

<p>"Where mischief is afoot there is Ramón&mdash;that is two." He
touched the second finger. "The only mischief I hear of just now is
the so-great scandal that the <i>señor</i> lieutenant Cortilla has
been insulted by an <i>americano</i>. That is two more." He closed
the fingers together into his palm. "Therefore Ramón is with the
<i>americano</i>. That is four." He laughed again.</p>

<p>"Then you were only guessing?"</p>

<p>"Was it not a good guess?" countered Father Viador shrewdly.
"But be comforted. I think there are not too many who can add two
and two." For the first time he addressed Andy directly.</p>

<p>"I will hear your confession, my son, and you may go in
peace."</p>

<p>"My confession, <i>padre</i>?" repeated Andy. Father Viador
examined him keenly.</p>

<p>"Are you not of the Faith?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Both men looked toward him expectant. Andy was confused at this
swift deflection. He felt stupid.</p>

<p>"The Faith?" he again repeated the priest's words.</p>

<p>Then he understood. "I am afraid I am not a Catholic," he
confessed, "if that is what you mean."</p>

<p>The great form of Father Viador straightened in his chair. His
whole being underwent one of those swift and astonishing changes
that seemed to make of him a different being.</p>

<p>"A heretic!" he cried.</p>

<p>For a moment he sat silent, almost visibly gathering his forces.
Then abruptly he launched into a torrent of ecclesiastical argument
and exhortation that left Andy gasping and bewildered. This was no
longer the rollicking, magnificently vital master of the black
mule; nor the serene high priest of the temple, nor yet the genial,
faintly mocking host sipping his wine and poking sly fun at amusing
and harmless escapades. It was the missionary of the Cross, the
zealot who forty years before had with Serra braved the howling
wilderness to save a heathen land. Fire blazed from his eyes. Words
poured from him in a flood. Andy was overwhelmed. He knew not what
to say, how to stand his ground. But something racial, bred in his
very bones, held him fast. It was no tenacity of childhood faith.
Andy had little or no formal religion of his own; nor had he any
antagonism to this creed more than another. Merely his integrity of
being could not permit him to be rushed off his feet. He could not
get his breath. He could merely squirm and look helpless. Indeed,
so abject at last became his appearance that Ramón burst out
laughing. Instantly the <i>padre</i> turned his thunders upon the
young Californian.</p>

<p>"You laugh!" he cried, "and your friend standing at this moment
in the danger of hell's fires!"</p>

<p>But the imp of perversity was dancing in Ramón's eyes. "I think
it not amiss that <i>los americanos</i> go to hell," said he.</p>

<p>Father Viador checked, eyed him uneasily.</p>

<p>"Not amiss?" he repeated uncertainly. "What talk is that?"</p>

<p>"I think it very likely I shall go to hell myself," said Ramón
with mock gravity. "You have told me so often enough, <i>padre
mío</i>, and I should believe you. I have lived with
<i>Americanos</i>, as you know. They are wonderful. If enough of
them go to hell, they'll manage somehow to change the climate for
me."</p>

<p>Father Viador's face flushed. He choked, tried to check himself,
then abruptly he uttered his great shout of jolly laughter.</p>

<p>"You are the incorrigible one!" he cried. He shook his great
head at Ramón. "For this you shall come to me tomorrow and I shall
impose on you the penitence. See you do not forget."</p>

<p>"No, <i>padre</i>," said Ramón submissively, but he glanced
sideways at Andy.</p>

<p>"And you, my son," the priest sobered again, "we shall talk of
these things further."</p>

<p>"Willingly, Father," said Andy.</p>

<p>"And now," Father Viador repossessed himself of the half-emptied
wineglass, "we shall drink&mdash;to the salvation of your
soul."</p>

<p>"And incidentally of his body," supplemented Ramón.</p>

<p>"There shall be more penitence if you persist in impertinence,
my son!" warned Father Viador.</p>

<p>By another of the about-face changes that so abruptly
transformed the man, he was again the genial, somewhat worldly
host. No trace remained of the religious zealot. Even his face
seemed to have altered, its lines to have rearranged themselves in
some subtle manner. He listened in silence to Ramón's exposition of
Andy's dilemma.</p>

<p>"Why do you come to me?" he asked, when the story was done. "You
are no fool, Ramón; you know that, so far from being in a position
to ask favors, the missions are put to it to defend their own.
Indeed, I think you well know that it is sufficient for the mission
to make a request to cause the opposite to be done."</p>

<p>"Would not your prayers help, holy <i>padre</i>?" asked Ramón
demurely.</p>

<p>"Doubtless, if the Lord willed. But some things He has deemed
wise to place beyond the reach of the holiest of prayers, possibly
to prevent some busybody praying himself out of merited punishment.
One of these things is a Mexican official. Take care that you are
not added to the number, my son."</p>

<p>"To speak truly, we are at our wit's end," confessed Ramón, "and
we have come for your advice as to what we can do."</p>

<p>Father Viador made no immediate reply, frowning intently under
his heavy brows. When he spoke, it was abruptly, with
authority.</p>

<p>"You," he addressed Ramón, "shall proceed tomorrow on your
journey to the <i>hacienda</i> to make your peace. You shall return
here when I send you word. You," he turned to Andy, "shall remain
here. You will be safe, undiscovered. I shan cause it to be known
that you are <i>en penitencia</i>, a <i>caballero</i> from the
south, and that you are under a vow of silence to expiate a
fault."</p>

<p>"For how long and for what purpose, <i>padre</i>?" asked Ramón,
after a short silence.</p>

<p>"That I shall tell in due time."</p>

<p>Yet another personality seemed to inform the priest's bulky
body. The two young men faced their schoolmaster. He fronted them
uncompromisingly. They had come for advice: there it was. Take it
or leave it. Nor would he explain; and thus he remained until,
reluctantly, a little doubtfully, they decided to do as he said.
Then he became again the genial host, refilled the wineglasses,
sprawled comfortably in his chair. For an hour he conversed
brilliantly with Ramón, while Andy sat by, fascinated. He had never
before come in contact with an exchange of pure ideas for their own
sake. This facet of Father Viador's mind opened broadly to a wide
angle of comprehension and of tolerance. He considered the world
and all its works from a shrewd and temporal point of view shot
with a cynical humor that had nothing in common with the narrow
high blaze of fanaticism of his former mood. It was abundantly
evident that the many aspects of Father Viador's bewilderingly
varied nature were in watertight compartments, so to speak; that
his mind obeyed literally the Scriptural injunction, that its right
hand knew not its left. Andy knew little of the high politics or
the fine-spun theories of thought or of conduct with which the
conversation dealt. He felt himself profoundly ignorant; humble
minded. This was a new and unsuspected Ramón. But it stimulated
him.</p>

<p>In the seclusion of their chamber, however, Ramón proved devoid
of enthusiasm as to the outlook. He shook his head. "It may be as
you say," he acknowledged, "but I do not entirely rely on that
one."</p>

<p>Andy was astonished at this change of front. "Surely you do not
suspect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no-no!" disclaimed Ramón. "It is as he says; he will keep
you safe enough. Inside its walls the mission still has its power.
But do you know, <i>amigo</i>, what I suspect? It is this: that
purely and simply the good <i>padre</i> keeps you here to save your
soul, and here you shall remain until he has persuaded you to the
true Faith. He is of the old time, one of the companions of
Junipero Serra, of blessed memory. Look you. He is the kindest of
men. He is like you, <i>amigo</i>, or like the blessed San
Francisco who was the friend of all things. Yet it is known that in
early days he caused the wild Indians, the gentiles, to be driven
in like cattle and dragged to the church with reatas, and has had
them beat on their bellies with ropes, even until some have died.
For that he is cruel? No, no-no! For that he save their soul. The
body, he say, and what happen to it, is nothing; the soul is all.
He must be cruel to be kind, like the surgeon is. He enslave the
gentiles in this life to save them in the next. And in the
beginning, when the gentile is a wild beast, there is no other way.
As one breaks the horse for the saddle. You have seen the wild
Indian, <i>amigo</i>." Ramón shook his head. "Perhaps he is right.
Me, I like the body pretty well. He's lots of fun." He pondered for
a moment, then chuckled. "I tell you one funny thing. You know what
these <i>padre</i> say when they have one of these Indians whip?
They do not say to the <i>capataz</i>, 'Whip me this man.' No. They
say to him, 'Give this one spiritual relief.'" He chuckled again.
"Me, I think I like my spiritual relief other ways."</p>

<p>He finished his preparations and rolled between the rough
blankets on the bed.</p>

<p>"Agh!" he grunted. "These mission blanket no good. At the
<i>hacienda</i>&mdash;" He raised himself on his elbow. "No, my
friend," he concluded earnestly, "I make one mistake in coming
here. But you see I did not know you are heretic. That was estupid
of me. This <i>padre</i> will not think one think about what we
shall do. He forget all that because now he got one nice new soul
to save that he do not have to drag in with the reata. A nice new
white-man soul. And that is all he think of. And until he save you,
he will do nothing. So for love of me, <i>amigo</i>, hasten to be
save."</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>RAMÓN reiterated his plea when, the following morning, he and
Panchito resumed their journey.</p>

<p>"Me, if I was you, I'd be save today," said he.</p>

<p>But the fiber of Andy's sturdy being could not so readily twist
itself to expedience. He was troubled. In sheer unconscious
reaction he braced himself against immediate and frontal assault,
But nothing happened. He found himself in the position of a welcome
guest, without restraint of any kind. Men and women saluted him
respectfully, perhaps eyed him with hidden curiosity; but none
offered to address him. Evidently Father Viador had well fulfilled
his promise, had firmly established the supposed status as a
<i>penitente</i>. At first Andy ventured rather gingerly, uncertain
whether or not he was committing an intrusion; but soon he found
that he was welcome to go where he wished, to observe what he
would. No one directed or instructed him; but soon he learned to
fall in with the routine customs of the place. He arose at daybreak
with the rest; he ate, in the customary silence, at the refectory
tables; he attended the frequent religious exercises, not because
of any urging&mdash;apparently he was free to absent himself, if he
so chose&mdash;but through an instinctive feeling of courtesy and
deference to those who entertained him.</p>

<p>As for Father Viador, the friar appeared neither to seek nor
avoid him. Certainly Ramón must be wrong: he did not again touch
upon the question of religion. The nearest he came to it was in the
loan to Andy of some of the books from his shelves. These were
religious in character, but Father Viador did not emphasize that
point. Indeed, it might be imagined that he half apologized for it
by remarking that the reading of them might pass the time and would
be excellent to improve Andy's Spanish, "even though they do not
interest you much." But, on the other hand, it did not appear that
he was giving any practical thought to the temporal problem
either.</p>

<p>However, for the moment Andy was satisfied enough.</p>

<p>The life of the mission interested him; he was thankful for this
opportunity of ease, comfort, and above all security, a breathing
space before stepping again to the trail of his destiny. After so
many years of the wild life, complete inaction for a period was not
ungrateful. He walked here and there, his hands idle, but his mind
busy in the acceptances and appraisals of what he saw; and, unknown
to himself, the priest watched him.</p>

<p>For Andy's spiritual chemistry was astir in flux. This
California, from his very first day within its borders, had been
remoulding him. He was already a different person from I-tam-a-pi,
the Blackfoot Man. Certain elements of the land's genius had seeped
into the taut fibers of his being; and, working from within, as
components of his life's stream, were beginning to transform him to
new manifestations. It was something a little more than a mere
expansion or unfoldment from the compactness of the perilous and
the solitary. The essence of his spirit was changing, taking on the
color of his environment.</p>

<p>At first his judgments were puzzled. He saw contradictory things
which changed his mind for him a dozen times a week. He saw the
fields cultivated, rudely, it is true, and with implements absurdly
primitive, but to lavish fertility. He saw orchards and vineyards
bringing forth their fruits in season; and cattle by the thousands
on the hills. He wandered into workshops where were carpenters,
blacksmiths, weavers, saddlers, hatters, the tanners of hides, the
makers of soap, all busily productive. Outside the walls were pits
where men dug the heavy adobe, and poured water upon it, and mixed
chopped straw in the mud, and pressed it into wooden molds where
the hot sun hardened it into bricks. But also there were kilns
where the red tiles were baked. All these labors were done by the
Indians, the men and the women, under the vigilant supervision of
the <i>capataces</i>, most of whom were white men, or who passed as
such. Each workshop had one of the friars in charge as overseer and
instructor. By this means a great deal of actual wealth was
produced. New buildings were constantly under construction.
Warehouses were filled with grain and produce; and also with
various imported goods bought through trade with the Boston ships
and resold on occasion to the <i>rancheros</i>, the
<i>hacendados</i>, or more rarely the Mexican officials
themselves.</p>

<p>In contrast to the brutish savagery of the native tribes Andy
had encountered in the interior, the Indians attached to the
mission seemed to have been made a different race of beings. The
wild peoples were little better than beasts with, apparently, only
a groping intelligence flickering in a dumb haze of brutishness.
These were stupid enough, dumb enough, but in them stirred
something, it might have been bewilderment, but it was life. They
did things, efficiently and with purpose. They led an ordered and
productive existence. They wore clothes and ate regularly. They
were in no fear of enemies. Some few of them, such as the musicians
of the church, and the finer artisans of the shops, had even made
the long step into a civilization of a sort. Andy, watching, could
not enough admire the patience and understanding of those who
undertook to teach the few. It was indeed admirable when it is
considered that not one of the musicians had ever heard music until
they were called upon to play together; that musical instruments
were strange to them; that they must be taught to read music to
whom written or printed pages were wholly unfamiliar. Still, Andy
noticed, though those selected ones seemed apt enough in learning
both the arts and handicrafts, they did so only under the lash of
constant urging. Left to themselves they did nothing.</p>

<p>This was all to the good, but Andy was an observer. His keen
eyes noticed other things. For instance, no effort whatever was
made to teach anything to the rank and file, only to the few that
were required for the mission's own necessities. In spite of the
variety and abundance of production, the Indians shared little of
it. They received, he learned, a blanket each year, a pair of the
blue trousers, one shirt; women the material for a dress and a
petticoat.</p>

<p>For provision they were given corn, wheat, and meat, At night
they were herded into separate buildings; locked in until morning,
and the keys brought to the <i>padre</i>; the young men in one, the
young women in another called the <i>mujerio</i>. These buildings
were dark, dank, almost like dungeons. They were wholly
unventilated. In the morning their inmates, as soon as the doors
were unlocked, rushed forth gasping frantically for fresh air.
There was no sanitation. In consequence there was much sickness, to
which those in authority appeared almost indifferent, except that
the greatest precautions were taken lest death intervene before the
pronouncing of extreme unction. Indeed, several boys were kept on
constant duty, day and night, as messengers of death whose duty it
was to rush to the <i>padre</i> in summons lest any die without
sacrament.</p>

<p>Every detail of life was ordered, not only the risings and
retirings, the labor of the day, the goings and comings, but the
larger affairs as well. No man could quit the premises without
leave. At daybreak each must leave his couch, must eat his
breakfast of <i>atole</i>, a sort of gruel, must attend mass, must
go to his labor. Three times in the day the bells rang and all
heads were bowed in prayer. At eleven o'clock a cart with a
<i>refresco</i> of water, vinegar, and sugar went afield. This, in
some obscure fashion, was supposed to prevent sickness. It was the
single attention vouchsafed to the subject of health. At evening
mass again, and supper, and a muster when the <i>capataces</i>
reported progress to the overseer; and he in turn to the
<i>padre</i>. The latter then decreed punishment as it seemed
necessary. Then roll call as each entered the dungeon for the
night.</p>

<p>Those were the days, monotonous, almost without change. But at
irregular intervals, Andy discovered, as time went on, such of the
Indians as wished to do so were permitted to hold a native dance of
their former tribal state, but not within the mission walls. For
that purpose had been erected a long shed of poles with a tule
roof. The dances were very simple and also very pagan. At first
Andy did not understand why they were permitted; but after a little
he perceived again the profound practical wisdom of <i>el
sabio</i>. Always, in spite of the rigid discipline, the priest
remained sensitive to pressures, and yielded a safety valve before
the point of explosion was quite reached. Nevertheless, it was a
reversion for the moment. A fire was built in the center of the
shed. The men doffed their sober garments to appear in loincloth
and feathered headdress. They painted their bodies and faces with
lines of black and red and blue. In single file, long peeled staves
in hand, they circled the fire, stamping the earth, throwing their
bodies into contortions, grimacing horribly and shouting and
yelling at the top of their lungs. A drum, trumpets made of horns,
and small sticks clattered together furnished an accompaniment; or,
rather, added to the din, for there was little attempt even at
rhythm. Motion and noise; that seemed to be the whole of it. The
only break in the proceedings was the arrival from the outside of
an individual decked out from head to toe with huge plumes. He
bounded suddenly in from the darkness. At once the dance ceased,
and the howling died; but the drum, trumpets, and castanet-sticks
continued to thump, blare, and rattle. The newcomer whirled,
pirouetted, and squatted for some minutes, then rushed into the
darkness whence he had come. Immediately he had retired, the dance
resumed. Andy, withdrawing a little from the whirl and
ear-splitting din and general stink of the occasion, discovered
that the plumed gentleman had squatted behind a bush a hundred
yards away and was engaged in uttering without intermission
creditable imitations of the cries of various animals. Because of
the hullabaloo in the shed no one could hear him but himself.
Furthermore, the night air was cold, and he, save for his feathers,
naked. Nevertheless, he stuck conscientiously on the job. Whether
this was for some obscure personal satisfaction, or whether the man
was a martyr to a crude symbolism, Andy could not guess. If the
latter, it was the only touch of significance in the whole
performance. There was not even a culmination toward the excitement
of frenzy. They simply hopped and howled. Nevertheless, the
participants seemed to find in this some sort of outlet. At dawn
they filed back to the mission compound sleek and sleepy, like
sated beasts.</p>

<p>Andy returned with them. He had stayed up all night; why, he
could not precisely have expressed. There was no variety in the
performance; and, after the first ten minutes, no interest. He was
held by his own puzzled subconscious gropings for appraisal, for
understanding. He had known only the free, wild, clean-cut, proud
savages of the plains and mountains, and from his life among them
he had built a certain concept of the Indians, as such, into which,
unconsciously, he had been fitting his impressions. But these
people did not belong in that concept; and so his impressions must
be shifted. He looked curiously on the docile stolid workers
plodding to the fields; and for the first time he was able, though
dimly, to see them, not with the eyes of the Blackfoot Man, but
with the eyes of the priest. For all that day he could not rid
himself of the strange illusion that these were not men and women
but half-tamed wild animals, like the cattle on the hills. The
point of view did not long persist in its full purity, but its
influence endured.</p>

<p>The apparent severity of some of the punishments no longer so
completely perturbed him. Now he was able to perceive that they
were imposed with a certain discrimination and in accordance with
some sort of policy. Father Viador's judgments were sometimes
severe; sometimes extraordinarily lenient. Heretofore this
inequality had seemed based on caprice. Without help or explanation
from his mentor Andy made his own discovery of the difference
between venial and deadly sin, though of course he did not express
it in those terms. He did not understand the standards by which the
difference was judged; but he did understand that there was a
difference. Often Father Viador met the most annoying stupidities
or even malices of daily living with no impatience, indeed, with a
certain large and sardonic humor. As when the overseers, of a
frosty morning, were unable to turn the men out to labor in the
fields. The situation was really almost serious enough to
constitute a mutiny and might with full justice have been handled
as such. But, instead of whipping the sulking Indians to their
tasks, Father Viador caused all fires to be extinguished. The
shivering, thinly clad Indians found the only way to get warm was
to go to work. On another occasion three young men, with the
intention of a night out or perhaps even of escape into the hills,
dodged evening roll call and the usual lock-up by concealing
themselves in a shallow trench and covering themselves over with
dry grass. Unfortunately for themselves they had not done a very
good job of it, and their hiding place was discovered. This too, in
the eyes of the <i>capataces</i> and the majordomo, was a scandal,
a bad example, a direct affront to authority, and they eagerly
besought the good father's permission to put a stop once and for
all to such tendencies with a proper punishment, the wooden collar,
the <i>corona</i>, and a sufficiency of lashes well laid on. But
the <i>padre</i> would have none of it. He seized a brand from the
fire and, tiptoeing with a cat-like stealth extraordinary in his
huge bulk, he sneaked upon the unconscious truants' hiding place.
The dry grass burst instantly into flames, and the three surprised
Indians, with a howl of fright and dismay, leaped to their feet and
scuttled to their places.</p>

<p>Father Viador roared with laughter, slapping his great thighs.
And forgave them!</p>

<p>On the other hand, Andy saw what seemed to him inconceivably
cruel punishments inflicted; men held in the stocks for long
periods under the blazing sun and the chilly dews of night, without
food or water; men dragging heavy weights by chains about the
ankles, and the flesh raw and bleeding; men whipped across the
abdomen, fifty lashes well laid on, without mercy. One woman who
had lost her baby and whose grief was pitiable was compelled to
carry always in her arms a block of wood and must continue to carry
it for as long as she would have nursed the child. To this Andy
ventured a protest.</p>

<p>"My son," said Father Viador, "this must be, for through neglect
she permitted her child to die without the Holy Sacrament."</p>

<p>It was difficult to understand, even though Andy at last
perceived that the alternations of leniency and severity were not
the play of pure caprice. And he saw Father Viador, <i>el
sabio</i>, moving among his people, by turns boisterous, pious,
kind, harsh, benign, severe&mdash;but beloved. Of that there was no
doubt. Some of the people were dull, sullen, rebellious; some were
restless and defiant; a few even tried to make escape to the wild
tribes of the hills and were hunted down by the <i>vaqueros</i> and
brought back bound with rawhide. Beneath the stolid brutish
submission stirred the wild strain. But when the day's small
troubled doings were over and the waters stilled, when all the
people were gathered kneeling in the candle-lighted dimness of the
church, and Father Viador stood over against them, his countenance
transfigured, then Andy, looking about him, saw in the faces
uplifted a devotion, unreasoning, uncomprehending, profound. And
dimly he sensed something greater than he could understand, greater
than any inconsistencies of idea or conduct, something so inclusive
that all peoples&mdash;himself, the <i>padre</i>, Ramón, Cortilla,
the brutish Indians, the men red and white of the mountains and the
plains and of the cities&mdash;beyond them and over the
seas&mdash;were embraced within it; and all the deeds of men,
however dark or noble, had their due and proportioned places. It
was an experience which comes to men at a certain ripe stage of
their development, in degree according to capacity, but the same in
essence. It has been variously termed&mdash;illumination, cosmic
consciousness, finding God&mdash;but it is the same experience
under whatever name. Possibly perception of unity comes nearest it.
It was in that aspect that it presented itself to Andy, as was
natural in one who had known only individualism. After its brief
exaltation had passed remained still a feeling of belonging to
something, of no longer walking alone. It was purely an instinctive
feeling, however, a comforting inner warmth; for when Andy tried to
examine it he could not for the life of him summon a clear
thought.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>SO FAR <i>el sabio</i> left the young man strictly to his own
devices: he did not repeat the mistake of his first
over-zealousness. But his experienced hand had gauged the young
man's spiritual pulse. He judged the moment.</p>

<p>It was in the Travelers' Orchard, to which Andy often repaired
when he wished to be alone. Of late this had been often. Why, he
did not know. He did not think of anything in particular. His
consciousness hung in a moody brown study, apparently over nothing,
as when one is in a state of comfortable digestion; as indeed was
Andy's case, though not of the mission's good fare. He paced slowly
to and fro, back and forth between two trees of the orchard. At the
end of each ten paces of his short journey he plucked from the tree
trunk, where it was embedded, the heavy frontiersman's knife and,
turning, hurled it toward the other tree. The long blade flashed in
an invariable and lovely arc of accuracy to thud quivering almost
exactly into the scar of the previous casts. It was a pretty sight,
the lithe strong body poised in balance, the wide graceful swing of
the arm, the flight of glittering steel. Nevertheless, the act was
purely mechanical. Andy was scarcely aware of what he was doing.
The priest's voice startled him to consciousness of his
surroundings as though from a trance.</p>

<p>"That is beautifully done, my son," said Father Viador, "and I
do not doubt my olives will bear the better for a little
bleeding."</p>

<p>Andy was dismayed, conscience stricken. "Oh, I am sorry!" he
cried. "I did not realize what I was doing. It was habit&mdash;I
hope there is no damage!" He examined the broken bark
solicitously.</p>

<p>"There is no harm done," the <i>padre</i> assured him, "though
perhaps it would be as well to vary the target before you cut
through to the heart. But never have I seen such skill with such a
weapon. And it is a very curious skill." He plucked the knife from
the tree and balanced it in his hand. Then, as though on impulse,
he drew back his arm in imitation of the mountain man's action and
hurled the blade. The knife turned end for end erratically, missed
the tree, slapped another with the side of the hilt, and bounced
off into the grass. The priest gave vent to his great jolly
laugh.</p>

<p>"Now why was that?" he cried in apparent chagrin.</p>

<p>"Why, Father, you held it wrongly in your hand, and then too,
you must cast not with your arm only, but with the whole body; as
though&mdash;as though&mdash;" Andy cast about for an example.
"Look you, Father, have you seen the children sometimes, in play,
cast a green apple from the end of a willow switch?"</p>

<p>"Seen them? I have even done it myself, and no later than
yesterday, though this you must not whisper, for the dignity of the
Church."</p>

<p>"Well, it is like that, and your body is the switch that bends
back and forth from the very heels to give the power and the
smoothness to the cast."</p>

<p>"I see!" cried the <i>padre</i>. "Bring me the knife."</p>

<p>Andy retrieved the weapon, arranged it properly in the old man's
hand. But the second attempt was little better than the first.</p>

<p>"It is also a matter of the balance of the blade," Andy told
him, "and the <i>feel</i> of it, and that can only be gained by
trial. This is a twelve-foot knife, and that you could not
know."</p>

<p>"A twelve-foot knife?" repeated Father Viador. "Now, what mean
you by that?"</p>

<p>"Why, merely that it will turn once over in twelve feet when
thrown with a full cast. So that if you would have it enter point
first at six feet you must make a half cast, and if it is farther
or nearer you must judge the distance and the power to put forth.
That you must learn by practise."</p>

<p>"But I perceive I shall not master this art this afternoon,"
said Father Viador, "besides which I fear I am much too fat to
assume the role of a willow switch." He disposed himself, grunting
somewhat, on the sun-warmed sweet grasses with his broad back
against the olive tree.</p>

<p>"Sit, my son. It is very pleasant," he invited. "Let us talk.
This pretty trick must have lost you many hours. Is it of use to
you?"</p>

<p>Andy nodded assent to the first observation.</p>

<p>"It has served me," he said briefly to the second.</p>

<p>"How is that, my son?" asked the priest. "Come, you must humor
the old man. The sun is warm, the air is soft. You shall tell
me."</p>

<p>Andy hesitated, checked by the self-contained taciturnity of his
nature, a taciturnity which his wilderness life had emphasized. But
he looked up into the placid benignity of the <i>padre's</i> face.
Haltingly at first, he began to tell of the time when, as prisoners
of the Blackfeet, he and his companions, Kelly and Joe Crane, on
the point of escape had turned back to do battle on the side of
their captors against the raiding Assiniboines. To explain this he
had also to tell of his Blackfoot friend, Kiasax, and his woman and
of the Little Warrior. Returning to the conflict, he described the
moment when, closely beset by his enemies, he had by a happy
inspiration cast the knife over and beyond them to pierce the neck
of the Assiniboine chief, standing apart, and so had turned the
tide of battle.</p>

<p>"So that time, you see, <i>padre</i>," he concluded, "the trick
did me a service and was worth its pains."</p>

<p>"And again?" Father Viador pressed for more. "No, never mind
that: now you must tell me of these you call your friends," he
amended. "Tell me of them. What do you call them? The Blackfeet?
What kind of people are they? Are they like our Indians?"</p>

<p>"No, no, Father, not at all like." Andy was aroused. "They are
much better. Why, they are real&mdash;like you and me!" His tongue
was loosened by his eagerness that his adopted people should
receive the justice of appreciation. Guided by the priest's shrewd
questions he talked for an hour.</p>

<p>"But that is wonderful!" sighed the priest at last. "That is
like Homer! You know Homer? No? I read him in my youth." Then he
added hastily, "He was a pagan and is not for a good Christian to
read. But he told of such things." He crossed himself in some
confusion; dismissing the heathen singer of tales. "That is a wild
hard life you have led, my son. Why," he asked curiously, "did you
leave it to come to this quiet land?"</p>

<p>"My friends were murdered. I killed a man," said Andy.</p>

<p>"That is bad," said the priest gravely, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have killed men, of course," broke in Andy. "How else could I
live? I never thought of it one way or another. But this
one&mdash;it was not in battle: I gave him no chance. I did not
want to give him a chance. And when I had killed him I scalped him,
like any savage. I had never done that before."</p>

<p>"Why did you do that, my son?" asked the priest. His voice was
gentle.</p>

<p>"He had murdered Joe Crane, my friend. He had done it
treacherously. He was Joe's enemy, and he picked a fight with him.
A man I knew saw him empty the priming pan of Joe's rifle. Joe did
not know it, but he was helpless. This man shot him down in cold
blood, safely. I followed him and caught him unaware and empty
handed, and shot him as he stood, and scalped him. And when I had
ridden back I found that my people&mdash;and Kiasax my
friend&mdash;had been massacred by the trappers; and they had come
in peaceably to trade. And I found Nit-o-ke-man, the wife of my
Blackfoot brother, standing by his dead body; and before I could
prevent it a Crow Indian dashed her brains out. Why should such
things be?" he demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>Father Viador was silent.</p>

<p>"You asked me why I came to this land," concluded Andy, more
gently, after a moment.</p>

<p>"Did you kill also this other man, this Crow Indian?" asked the
priest.</p>

<p>"No," said Andy.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," said the mountain man wearily. "Of what use
more killing? It was done."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Father Viador. He pondered. "Do you repent killing
this other man, this one who murdered your friend?"</p>

<p>Andy threw back his head. "No!" he cried.</p>

<p>They sat for some moments in the humming silence of the
sun-warmed bees.</p>

<p>"'Vengeance is mine,' saith the Lord. That is what the
Scriptures tell us, my son. Vengeance is not ours but His. But His
ways are wonderful and past the finding out of our poor groping.
Who knows but for His vengeance he used you as His own right
arm."</p>

<p>Andy looked up quickly. "You mean?"</p>

<p>The priest arose to his feet, straightened his great body,
raised the two fingers of his right hand. After an instant's
hesitation Andy bowed his head.</p>

<p>"<i>Absolvo te</i>!" said Father Viador.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>BY A common impulse they began slowly to pace back and
forth.</p>

<p>"Have you found what you sought in our land?" asked Father
Viador.</p>

<p>"Partly&mdash;a friend&mdash;Ramón; And the life on the
<i>rancho</i>. But it slipped&mdash;there is in me an uneasiness.
It lies always below other things&mdash;I cannot explain it. It
sounds foolish."</p>

<p>"I understand, my son."</p>

<p>"I feel outside, somehow&mdash;" Andy's necessity for expression
forced him stumbling on&mdash;"as if I was looking on. No matter
what I did." He hesitated; but it was the atmosphere of
confidences, and, a little shamefacedly, Andy continued, "It is
curious, <i>padre</i>, but a few times I have lost that, and it has
always been in the church when you were saying the mass."</p>

<p>Father Viador's breath checked for a moment, but he controlled
the eagerness from his voice. "How was that, my son?"</p>

<p>"Why, I do not know how to tell you; But it was a feeling of
belonging&mdash;like belonging to a family, I should think. I never
had a family, only my grandmother, and she is long since dead. Of
course, there were Joe and Jim, and there was Kiasax. They were the
same as brothers, I suppose, and anyone of us would have died for
the other, but it was not quite the same. I told you I could not
tell you!" cried Andy, baffled.</p>

<p>The priest's eyes shone.</p>

<p>"You <i>have</i> told me, my son; and I have understood, as why
not&mdash;for it was indeed a Family whose communion you entered,
whose mother is the Church. Do you not see, my son, that thus she
is calling you to herself?"</p>

<p>The priest paused; but resumed instantly he perceived that Andy
was on the point of reply. His every nerve was sensitive to the
occasion he had so skillfully evoked. Undoubtedly he perceived
that, however impelling was his purpose, and however necessary was
the young man's emotional urge, it must take its place now as the
underlying, hidden, deciding factor; and that the Anglo-Saxon, the
mountain man, must be permitted his cooler surface rationalizations
beneath which to conceal his actual response. His whole being was
quivering with eagerness, but with an eagerness in leash. He forced
himself to speak as of one reasoning of simple and comfortable
things.</p>

<p>"If you are to live in California and here find happiness, my
son," said he, "you must become as the Californians. There is no
other way. As a stranger you will be apart and alone. Not otherwise
will my people trust you and take you to their hearts. Already you
have put on our garments. And deep within you have changed a little
from your old self. Is not that so, my son? Answer truly!"</p>

<p>Andy thought of Ramón; He nodded.</p>

<p>"And you will change more. That I know: for deep within
yourself, beneath the iron, you are <i>simpático</i>, and though
always your eyes are dry and hard and your face bold, your heart
can weep. But, my son, never can you be one with those for whose
love you secretly hunger while you sit apart."</p>

<p>Even the priest's keen acumen could not guess the unexpected
direction this appeal now took. Perhaps it was an instinct that led
him to touch upon what had been, in the homely community of Andy's
boyhood, a commonplace of custom, and so partly transferred the
situation from the uneasy ground of pure religious emotion to a
familiar parallel. For in the tiny Pennsylvania community a
new-come family, as a matter of course, had always first of all
joined the local church. And Andy's wild life had washed from his
being all the small distinctions, leaving in his soul's background
only the great simplicities of a reverence in which he abided but
which he never examined&mdash;God, the Sun, the Above People,
ordered mystery beneath which he moved in trust but to which he did
not raise his eyes. He had long since lost any sense of creed
loyalty. Though the practical side could not, in his fundamental
sincerity, be the deciding factor, it was a bit of solid earth
beneath his feet.</p>

<p>"But I am not a Roman Catholic, <i>padre</i>," said he.</p>

<p>Father Viador closed his eyes, and from his heart rose a brief
formless prayer for forgiveness of what he was going to do. Then
boldly he plunged.</p>

<p>"You are a true Catholic, my son," he stated, "in those things
that truly make the Faith. You have acknowledged our Lord, and have
in spirit entered into the holy mystic communion. And this very day
you have knelt before me and have confessed yourself and from me
have received absolution. At the very threshold of the door you
stand. Come with me."</p>

<p>He seized Andy's arm and led him out through the wicket gate of
the Travelers' Orchard, across the busy courtyard, into the cool
dimness of the church, deserted now, where burned only the feeble
flicker of the altar candles.</p>

<p>"Kneel, son!" he commanded.</p>

<p>He was panting heavily, as though he had run a race. He dipped
his fingers in the holy font, and toward the faintly smiling
painted figure of the Virgin cast imploring eyes.</p>

<p>"In Thy name," he muttered: then threw back his head and
proceeded with the ceremony of baptism.</p>

<p>"Rise, my son," he said gently, "and in the bosom of the Family
may you find that for which you seek. And now leave me, for I must
make my peace."</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>ALONE in the church Father Viador fell upon his knees. He raised
his eyes toward the faintly smiling Virgin.</p>

<p>"Mother of God, intercede!" he murmured. A groan burst from his
great body. He bent in the consciousness of guilt that thus, not
through the broad prescribed portals of instruction and
preparation, but through the small doubtful wicket of expediency he
had led this soul before the Throne. And yet the agony in which he
knelt sprang not from concern for himself, but lest because of
these bold irregularities the soul be denied and his effort have
been in vain.</p>

<p>Long he knelt, and the pale daylight faded, and the altar
candles flared high in the breathless air, and the smiling madonna
looked down on him, making no sign. Then slowly his heart swelled
within him, and from mystic sources came certitude and with it a
sweet enveloping warmth. The painted image still smiled down at him
its fixed smile, but to Father Viador's streaming eyes it seemed
that the wooden face had softened and the light from the candles
had invested it with a swimming golden haze. He bowed his head.</p>

<p>"For this, Thy grace, be praised," he whispered. He arose to his
feet and addressed himself solemnly. His deep-toned voice rang
strangely through the empty church.</p>

<p>"<i>Peccavi</i>," he intoned, "and forasmuch as Francisco Viador
hath gravely sinned against the prescriptions of the Holy Church,
I, the <i>Padre Ministro</i> of the Mission of Santa Clara, do
impose upon him the penitence that for three nights through shall
he kneel at the Altar of Our Lady, and that for thirty days shall
he each day upon his bare back scourge himself twenty lashes well
laid on, and so may his soul find peace, <i>Ora pro nobis, María
Santísima.</i>"</p>

<p>He crossed himself and strode masterfully down the echoing
church to the open door. Outside it the bell ringers awaited his
command for vespers.</p>

<p>"Ring, my children!" cried the priest. "Ring strongly this
evening, for in heaven the blessed saints rejoice."</p>

<p>The bell ringers looked curiously at one another. "His face
shines&mdash;<i>El Sabio</i>," said they.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter VI. Hacienda</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>ANDY had every reason to expect, now that Father Viador had
baptized him into the Faith, that the priest would at last turn his
wits to practical matters. That, after all, was why he was here: to
get a little advice on how to placate the unfriendly government
officials. Ramón had highly recommended the <i>padre</i> as El
Sabio, the wise one, who would be sure to find a way out of the
difficulty. But to his profound surprise he learned, two days
later, that the friar seemed to consider the job finished.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to stay if you wish it, my son," said Father
Viador, "but your place is not within mission walls but in the
world of men and action. There you must take your place and make
your way."</p>

<p>He was blandly unimpressed by Andy's dismayed expostulation that
really nothing had been done to alter the hostile situation outside
the said walls. Father Viador thought differently. He had done his
full part in leading Andy to the shelter of the Church and the
protection of the saints. Now it was their turn. To do him justice,
Father Viador firmly believed they would take over.</p>

<p>"Put your trust in the Lord and go forth boldly, my son," said
he. "Have faith, and a way will surely be opened to you."</p>

<p>So Andy packed his few belongings again in the <i>cantinas</i>,
wrapped the Boone rifle in its disguising <i>serape</i>, and bent
his head to Father Viador's parting benediction. It had been
decided that the first thing he should do must be to journey to the
family <i>hacienda</i> of the Riveras where he could consult
further with Ramón. To this end Father Viador had furnished him
with a half dozen of the mission's fleetest horses together with a
<i>vaquero</i> to herd them and bring them back, as well as to act
as guide.</p>

<p>The party had proceeded, at the headlong speed of the country,
barely a league from the mission's walls when it encountered a
similar <i>caballada</i> racing in the opposite direction.
Recognition was simultaneous. Ramón did not appear to share Andy's
surprise.</p>

<p>"But he sent for me, <i>el sabio</i>," said he, "saying that now
all was arranged. What is arranged, Andres <i>mío</i>? What is the
good father's plan?"</p>

<p>"I am to trust in the Lord and the blessed saints," said Andy
dryly.</p>

<p>"And besides?"</p>

<p>"Nothing besides."</p>

<p>Ramón looked blank. "But surely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly that," said Andy. "He seemed to think that once he had
joined me to the Church he had done the job."</p>

<p>Ramón turned to him a shining face, crossing himself
devoutly.</p>

<p>"Ah, blessed Mary be praised!" he cried with a sudden and
genuine depth of feeling that surprised Andy and made him just a
little ashamed of his momentary protective cynicism. "Then all is
well!"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," Andy persisted, "I'd like to know what is to be
done."</p>

<p>"He is wise, that one," said Ramón with entire conviction. "If
he says that now matters are arranged, then so it will be, for he
does not speak idly. What we shall do I do not know, but we shall
know all in good time. We shall first of all return to the
<i>hacienda</i>. My papá, he also is a wise one. Perhaps he shall
tell us. <i>Holá</i>!" He struck spurs to his horse and dashed
away. Andy raced alongside.</p>

<p>The two <i>vaqueros</i>, driving the little herd of remounts,
followed headlong, fifty paces to the rear.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>ALL that day thus they rode, almost without check, save for a
change of horses every three or four leagues. Toward mid afternoon
they surmounted the crest of a low range of grassy mountains to
look abroad over a wide flat valley. Across the way were other and
loftier mountains, dark blue with forest and with distance. Far to
the right hand, half discovered, half guessed, hazed by bright
mists, sparkled the sea. To the left hand the valley ran like a
broad river gradually rising, until, unguessed miles away, it had
blended smoothly into the encircling hills softened to vagueness by
the shimmer of rising heat.</p>

<p>The floor of the valley itself was stilled by the maplike
immobility of the elevation on which they stood; variegated in soft
changing colors of ripening grass. A slender thread of meandering
darker green of trees and bushes marked the course of a river. Tiny
dots that moved might have been cattle or game animals. Across the
way, beyond the river, on a low elevation close under the wall of
mountains glimmered a wide group of low white buildings, the red of
whose roofs caught the sun in a splash of color.</p>

<p>Ramón swept the flat of his hand to include, apparently, the
whole of the visible landscape.</p>

<p>"The <i>hacienda</i> of the Riveras," he said, with a touch of
pride, "and yonder <i>la casa</i>&mdash;where you shall have your
home, I hope."</p>

<p>They sat for several minutes, eased in their saddles, elbow on
pommel, while the horses were breathed after their sharp climb. The
air was soft and sun warmed, but from the west came a little breeze
that carried a faint far coolness of the sea.</p>

<p>Though obviously they followed a traveled highway, the descent
was accomplished within the hour. The trail was precipitous. When
the Californian set out to go anywhere, he went; with a minimum
regard for grades. The horses slid and buck jumped. The riders
leaned far back, yielding gracefully to each plunge. Regaining the
flat lands, they left the trail and again scampered on at top speed
over the open plain.</p>

<p>Only at the river the journey suffered a slight check. In the
bed of the stream the water ran swift, shallow, wide and muddy over
a sandy flat. Ramón and the <i>vaqueros</i> consulted.</p>

<p>"There is a hard ford, but it is a league above," Ramón
explained to Andy. "But we shall see."</p>

<p>The <i>vaqueros</i>, shouting, herded the loose horses, with the
exception of the two carrying the packs, to the crossing. The
animals were reluctant to enter the shallow water. Only repeated
urging and the flailing of the rawhide reatas forced them on. The
moment they had set hoof in the stream their instinct proved sound,
for they sank in the quicksand. They floundered violently, some
fell and with difficulty struggled to their feet. The
<i>vaqueros</i> were at their heels, yelling at the top of their
lungs, lashing them on, vigilant to keep them moving, for an
instant's hesitation must mean disaster. It was apparently a
foolhardy excursion; but somehow it was carried through, and men
and horses gained the other bank, splashed, wet, disheveled, the
beasts' flanks heaving. And at once the <i>vaqueros</i> dashed
around the little herd and forced it back the way it had come. It
was a wild sight, the plunging, snorting horses, the flying water,
the frantic <i>vaqueros</i>. Thrice was the maneuver repeated; and
the third time Ramón's <i>vaquero</i> shouted:</p>

<p>"<i>Preparada, señor</i>!"</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Ramón, "and hold his head up by the bit, and
use your spur! If he stops, you shall be very wet!"</p>

<p>The final crossing proved to be much easier than Andy had
anticipated, thanks to the trampling hard of the ford. Still, his
beautiful Californian costume was splashed and muddy. But Ramón
laughed.</p>

<p>"There are clothes at the <i>casa</i>!" he cried, "and we have
gained a league!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, night had fallen before they arrived at the ranch
house. The white buildings shimmered silvery under the moon, and
the flames from torches and the light from numerous windows, blazed
brilliant orange. Andy could not see much of the surroundings. The
<i>casa</i>, on this side, presented merely a long wall, in the
center of which was a door, and on either side small windows high
up. A number of people pressed about the horsemen, Californians
all, but most of them with an evident admixture of Indian blood.
They flashed white teeth of welcome to Andy and removed his spurs
from his heels, and at the last disappeared with all his
belongings, including the long rifle still wrapped in its
<i>serape</i> for concealment. Ramón laughed at the mountain man's
reluctance to part with the weapon.</p>

<p>"But you shall see it again," he mocked, "and my papá and my
mamá call it very bad you come arm&mdash;how you call it?&mdash;to
the teeth when you pay your respect."</p>

<p>Andy glanced down at his splashed garments; but Ramón assured
him he was supposed to present himself instantly, just as he
was.</p>

<p>They entered the door into a hall that extended through the
building. Other doors opened to right and left. Ramón thrust open
one of these.</p>

<p>Andy found himself in a long low room that occupied the whole
width of the building. Its floor was bare and polished like a brown
pool; its beams overhead were also brown and darkly rich. The walls
were white. Against them stood several carved brown chests, a
number of straight chairs whose seats and backs were of patterned
leather, painted and gilded. At regular spaces silver candelabra,
each with three candles, twinkled in their own light. The candles
were smooth and white and burned with a clear steady flame. They
were molded neither of the <i>sebo</i> nor of the <i>manteca</i>,
but were of genuine sperm, and so an evidence of great honor and
great wealth, had Andy known it, which he did not. Between them,
and at the wide blank end of the room, hung portraits done in oil,
of stern men and fair women, dim and stately and aloof behind the
dark mellowness of age. The whole center of the room was clear; nor
were there bibelots or tables, what-nots or other furniture to
detract from the simple, brown, dark, quiet richness. And at the
far end, side by side, stood a man and a woman. So still were they
that they might well have stepped from one of the frames above
them. The man wore simple dark clothes and knee breeches, but with
silken hose and jeweled buckles to his shoes, and a high flared
collar about which had been wound the folds of a black stock. The
woman, also in contrast to Andy's previous observations of the
country's costumes, was clad with equal simplicity in a gown of
heavy gray silk with flaring skirt, and a close-fitting jacket
buttoning to the neck, before which crossed the light folds of the
<i>rebozo</i>.</p>

<p>The two young men walked down the length of the room. Ramón
stepped lightly forward, bowed his head before the man, raised the
woman's hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"<i>Señor padre, permiteme presentarte un buen amigo, Andres
Burnett. Doña Engracia</i>," said he, "<i>aqui yo introdusco el
valedor mío, el señor Don Andres Burnett</i>."</p>

<p>Andy bent his body from the hips and straightened to find
himself the object of a veiled but keen scrutiny. Although an
appreciable time elapsed before Don Silvestre acknowledged the
introduction, the pause conveyed no faintest tinge of discourtesy
or embarrassment; rather it seemed the deliberation natural to a
high and rhythmic ceremonial. For several seconds Don Silvestre's
haughty eyes surveyed the bold and resolute countenance of the
young frontiersman waiting respectfully before him. Then they
softened in approval.</p>

<p>"<i>Sylvestre Carlos Jaime Rivera y Martinez</i>," he named
himself, "<i>servidor de usted</i>."</p>

<p>He presented his wife as Ramón had presented himself.</p>

<p>She curtseyed. "<i>Engracia de Rivera</i>," she murmured, "<i>a
sus ordenes en esta su casa de usted.</i>"</p>

<p>She extended her hand with a faint but pleasant smile. "You kiss
the hand, you do not shake him," warned Ramón rapidly in English,
at Andy's movement. Andy managed, somewhat awkwardly, it is true,
but in time, to alter his first intention. He murmured a few words
of appreciation and escaped without disgrace, following Ramón the
terrible length of the room, and imitating his friend's bow as they
at last reached the door. But he could not repress a sigh of relief
when once more they had gained to the hallway.</p>

<p>Ramón laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"You are escare!" he accused. "But there is no need. It is only
Papá and Mamá. Tomorrow you shall see. I think they like you ver'
much."</p>

<p>He led the way out the farther door and down one side of the
patio into which it opened, to a wing of the house where, in
another room, only a little smaller than the first, was a long
table set out for a meal with silver and china and glass. Here too
were the simplicity of dark and polished wood, and more portraits,
and white candles of sperm. They encountered no one; but somehow
Andy felt himself the object of scrutiny by hidden eyes, and once
he thought he caught the echo of whispering and of faint smothered
laughter, though the windows were dark and there was no sound but
the tinkling of a fountain. He felt awkward, constrained, ill at
ease, for he was not accustomed to this sort of thing. Suddenly
Ramón seemed withdrawn from him. A gap had opened between them.</p>

<p>But the Californian appeared to be unaware of it. He was in high
spirits, bursting with a scarcely restrained pride. Tomorrow,
tomorrow was the content of his cry. "Tomorrow you shall see! My
brothers, them I have told of you, and they wait eagerly to make
your acquaintance! And the <i>hacienda</i>; you will forget the
little rough rude <i>rancho</i> of the border when you shall see! I
have a horse for you that steps like a fairy of the winds!
And&mdash;" Ramón was struck by a sudden thought. He clapped his
hands. The young girl who had been serving them appeared. She was a
demure, pretty young creature whose shy friendly smile toward the
<i>extranjero</i> had been that young man's one comfort in a
growing uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Call Panchito," said Ramón to her.</p>

<p>The <i>vaquero</i>'s familiar face and the obvious pleasure of
his greeting were grateful to Andy, but Ramón's commands dismayed
him.</p>

<p>"Look you, Panchito," said he. "We shall make <i>fiesta</i> for
our guest. Send men to all who can be reached in a day's ride and
summon our friends for, let me see, five days hence. And see to it
that all is prepared. We shall have a dance, and a <i>merienda</i>,
and riding and games, and we shall have pleasure for all the
people. You shall see!" he cried enthusiastically to Andy. "There
are many young men who will come whom you shall love; and
<i>doncellitas</i>, ah, <i>doncellitas</i>!" he kissed the tips of
his fingers, "beautiful like the year-old cow, who shall love you,
my fighter of the Indian. Yes, and you shall have your accursed
rifle in your hand, that make you the trouble; and you shall cut
them, piff! the top off the head of the <i>ardilla</i>, the
esq-ee-rell like you do it for me, and you shall show them how
brave a friend have I! And we shall dance, dance all the night, and
the <i>doncellita</i> shall make the big eye at the so-handsome
<i>americano</i>. Eh?"</p>

<p>Andy was dismayed. The prospect threw him into a panic,
especially the <i>doncellitas</i>. He tried to stammer some sort of
protest; but Ramón would not listen.</p>

<p>"You hear, Panchito?" he cried. "You understand?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>," the <i>vaquero</i> agreed with relish. "Rest
easy. All shall be done."</p>

<p>"But, Ramón," expostulated Andy, when the <i>vaquero</i> had
withdrawn. "You have not asked your father, your mother. Perhaps
they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My mama? My papá?" cried Ramón, astonished. "But they like the
<i>fiesta</i>!"</p>

<p>"Doggone it!" cried Andy. "I won't know how to act!"</p>

<p>"Act? Act?" repeated the Californian. "What you mean, act?"</p>

<p>"I'm scared," blurted Andy.</p>

<p>"Escare?" repeated Ramón again. "Why escare? They nice peoples."
He pondered. "Oh, you mean Cortilla! My papá fix him some way.
Tomorrow we ask him. You shall see!"</p>

<p>Andy gave it up. But his panic was genuine. For a fleeting
instant he even contemplated flight.</p>

<p>Ramón stretched lazily and arose.</p>

<p>"Come, we will sleep," said he; "we have made the long
ride."</p>

<p>He led the way to still another room in the other wing.</p>

<p>At first glance that was in its way as formidable as the rest.
Andy had never known luxury. Especially was he appalled by the bed.
In the California of that day the one object of pride and luxury
was the bed. Even the pioneer house, meagerly or even poorly
furnished otherwise, boasted of its bed. So, naturally, in this
noble <i>hacienda</i> this was a noble bed, high and wide and
canopied. Its mattress was thick and soft, it supported two great
white pillows. It was covered by a marvelous spread of satin
heavily embroidered and ornamented with rosettes of ribbons. To
Andy's simple mind it seemed a profanation to disturb the thing. He
eyed it with distrust.</p>

<p>Ramón puttered about here and there examining the arrangements.
Andy stood rigid in the middle of the floor casting his eyes warily
about him. There were plenty of things whose use he could not
guess, and plenty of others, he told himself, he would not try to
meddle with. But on the table near the head of the bed was one
object that must have been misplaced and forgotten; a half-open
leathern bag full of gold coins.</p>

<p>"Oh, that," said Ramón carelessly. "No, I do not think you need
him. This is the traveler's room, you see. These is for the
traveler if he need him."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned," muttered Andy under his breath.</p>

<p>When Ramón had at last departed, he removed his garments and
gingerly inserted himself beneath the gorgeous coverlet. He did not
know enough to fold it and lay it aside. He was mildly
uncomfortable beneath its weight. His mind was uneasy.
Nevertheless, at last the low tinkling murmur of the waters in the
patio lulled him.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>FOR the first time since running away from the Pennsylvania
farm, Andy the next morning overslept; For the first time since
crossing the Missouri River he must have relaxed all, even
subconscious vigilance, for he found that someone had entered the
room undetected. His splashed and muddy garments had been taken
away, and in their place his elaborate holiday suit had been laid
out. As he unclosed his eyes a servant was entering the room
bearing a tray of chocolate and biscuits. Andy, much ashamed of
himself, dressed hurriedly.</p>

<p>He threw open the door looking into the patio and brought up
short on the threshold. Then he hastily withdrew out of sight.</p>

<p>The open part of the patio itself was a jumble of loveliness.
Around the lily-padded fountain in the center were giant ferns,
roses, carnations, sweet peas, great orange lilies brought from
Mexico; and climbing jasmine on the supporting pillars, and the
decorative awkwardness of cactus against the white walls. Yucca and
Spanish bayonet bristled vigilant as sentinels. Birds hopped
busily; butterflies fluttered; intent bees droned from bloom to
bloom. Through the resonant dappled brilliance of sunlight and
foliage and flower was a toddle of kittens and puppies and small
children. Under the veranda-like extension of the roof were many
women. Some of them were weaving at small portable looms; some were
bent over sewing and embroidery; some were tending or nursing
babies; some, great bowls between their outspread knees, were
preparing foods of various sorts for the fire. A hum of soft voices
and gentle laughter blended with the drone of the bees, the
twittering of the birds, and the golden flood of the sun in a
comfortable mixture of sound and warmth.</p>

<p>Andy did not know what to do. There was no way out of his room
except through the patio.</p>

<p>The women were all dressed alike, simply, in loose white waists
and colored skirts. Their sleek heads were bare, the hair cut
square across the forehead, gathered in nets, but with a lock
hanging on either side down the cheek. Some of the younger were
very pretty. All, old and young, were pleasant with the content of
entire good-humor. Some of the elders were fat; and some of the
oldest were incredibly seamed with a crisscross of wrinkles; but
even the most ancient had preserved still the attraction of
beautiful veiled eyes, of glossy abundant hair, and of flashing
white teeth. They bent over their tasks, or walked here and there
about their affairs; and the movements of their hands and arms, the
poise of their sleek heads, the carriage of their bodies had the
suspended fluttering grace and a little of the apparent
inconsequence of the butterflies in the garden.</p>

<p>After a moment this general impression steadied in Andy's mind
to a recognition. Near the great door leading into the <i>sala</i>
a smaller group of four sat apart. One of them Andy identified as
Doña Engracia, though she too now wore the simple house dress of
informality. At that instant one of the four arose and made her way
down the colonnade toward Andy's room. As she drew nearer Andy saw
that she was but ten or twelve years of age, with the child's flat
boylike figure, and the child's rounded face; but that no
otherwise, neither in dress nor in grace and dignity in carriage,
did she differ from the others, a grown-up in miniature. She stood
in the doorway and bent her knees in a deep curtsey, holding her
skirts spread with the tips of her fingers.</p>

<p>"<i>Buenos dias, señor</i>," said she demurely, "and my mother
begs you will be so gracious as to sit with her."</p>

<p>Her small face was gravely ceremonial, and from beneath her
lashes she surveyed the tall stranger with solemn curiosity. So
evident and so avid was this emotion that Andy's risibilities were
tickled.</p>

<p>"<i>Buenos dias, señorita</i>," he returned gravely, and bending
from his great height he raised her small fingers to his lips.</p>

<p>The child's eyes widened.</p>

<p>"So you are Ramón's little sister," said Andy.</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>."</p>

<p>"And what is your name?"</p>

<p>"Faquita, señor."</p>

<p>"Why, that is a pretty name. Mine is Andres."</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>."</p>

<p>She continued to stare at him wide eyed.</p>

<p>"Why do you look at me so?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>Her sedateness broke by ever so little. She hesitated. "But you
are not like they told me, <i>señor</i>," she said.</p>

<p>Andy grinned.</p>

<p>"And what did, they tell you I would be like?" he asked. "Come,
we're going to be friends, aren't we?"</p>

<p>She looked up at him sideways for a long searching moment,
scanning his face. Then her own broke in a slow sweet smile.</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>," she whispered shyly.</p>

<p>"Then if we are friends you must tell me what I ask," said Andy
with mock severity, "or I shall be very angry. You would not have
me angry, would you? I eat little girls when I am angry."</p>

<p>Suddenly she giggled and became wholly the child. "They said all
<i>Americanos</i> are <i>como el oso!</i>"</p>

<p>"Like a bear, eh?" Andy laughed. "And I am not like a bear?"</p>

<p>"No, <i>señor</i>," Faquita assured him earnestly. "You are like
a <i>californio</i>."</p>

<p>She laughed with him joyously.</p>

<p>"It was Carmel who told me that," she added.</p>

<p>"Who is Carmel?"</p>

<p>"She is my sister. She is <i>la favorita</i> with all the
<i>caballeros</i>. She is very beautiful. See," she took his great
hand in hers and drew him to the door, "that is she, who sits next
to Mamá. Is she not beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Very," agreed Andy.</p>

<p>"She said that all <i>americanos</i> are <i>como el oso</i>, and
Ramón, my brother, did not like it and was very angry with her."
She giggled again; looked up into Andy's gray eyes. "Then,
<i>señor</i>, she said," the child hesitated, then continued with a
rush, "She said, <i>señor</i>, that she had always wished for a
tame bear so she could make him do the dance like those at the
<i>fiesta</i>. But she would be very angry if she knew I told you
this."</p>

<p>"Then why do you tell me, Faquita?"</p>

<p>She stared at him in slow perplexity. "Did you not say we are to
be friends?" she asked gravely.</p>

<p>"Of course!" Andy was touched. He reflected a moment, his mouth
setting in grim and obstinate lines. "Come," he said, "we must not
longer keep your mother waiting."</p>

<p>He took the child by the hand and marched down the colonnade of
the patio. The soft chatter, the busy movements of industry were
suspended. Andy was not even aware of this attentiveness that, but
a moment ago, would have thrown him into an agony of embarrassment.
In his gala costume his tall form made a very fine figure of a man.
The <i>muchachas</i> by whom he brushed unceremoniously looked up
at him with a flutter of admiration. He had no eyes for them. The
Doña Carmel, seated among her spread skirts at her mother's left
hand, her shining head bent low over her embroidery frame,
apparently was unconscious of his approach. As a matter of fact,
she was acutely aware of the moment he left the doorway of his
room; and her veiled eyes, not without a certain surprise, had
taken in every detail of his appearance. Certainly its lithe,
smooth grace of movement, the correctness of its apparel revealed
none of the uncouth barbarity she had expected. She stole a glance
at his browned and resolute face, with its bold outline and the
strange square growth of the eyebrows. She could not see his eyes,
As soon as might be, she must see his eyes.</p>

<p>He was bending over Doña Engracia's hand and speaking to her.
His voice was not bad, nor his Spanish harsh with the twang of the
ships' supercargoes, who had visited the <i>hacienda</i> on
business. Doña Carmel bent lower over her embroidery frame,
apparently absorbed in the delicacy of her task.</p>

<p>Doña Engracia waved aside Andy's apologies, drew in her skirt,
inviting him to sit at her side. "But when one is tired one sleeps
until one is rested again," said she. "Soon Don Sylvestre and my
sons will return. They have gone to make the ride, as always. Now
you must talk to me while waiting."</p>

<p>"That is pleasing to me, <i>señora</i>," replied Andy.</p>

<p>He seated himself next her and looked about him boldly.</p>

<p>The child sidled to him and inserted her little hand in his
fingers. The third member of the group he recognized now as
Vicenta, the "too-fat one," the wife of Panchito the
<i>vaquero</i>. She smiled broadly at him but did not speak.</p>

<p>Doña Engracia offered no introductions, but continued to speak
in her slow placid manner.</p>

<p>"My son has said much of you, Señor Andres," said she, "and has
told us of your life there over the mountains and among the wild
people and the wild beasts. To me it all sounds terrible; and you
must know that you are welcome here and that you are <i>de la
casa</i>, and that you must find this a place where you can be
happy."</p>

<p>"<i>Gracias, señora</i>," returned Andy. "How could I be
otherwise?"</p>

<p>"You like the California?</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"That is well. But we are a quiet people. To one like yourself
who has traveled in so strange places, our life may seem dull."</p>

<p>"I know little of the life, <i>señora</i>, except what Ramón has
told me, for, as you know, I have as yet seen nothing but the
<i>rancho</i>&mdash;and a little while the mission&mdash;but it
seems to me far from dull."</p>

<p>"Ah, Ramón!" Doña Engracia laughed softly, but with a touch of
fond pride. "That one!" She sobered and laid her hand on Andy's
arm. "But he tells me, Don Andres, that you have saved his life.
And for that my heart thanks you, <i>señor</i>."</p>

<p>"I?&mdash;saved his life?" Andy was genuinely puzzled. "No,
<i>señora</i>."</p>

<p>"You are overmodest," Doña Engracia insisted.</p>

<p>"I have not the slightest idea what you mean!" cried Andy. "You
have been misinformed, <i>señora</i>."</p>

<p>Doña Engracia shook her head, smiling.</p>

<p>"Ramón has told me. The bear that was about to overcome him, and
he with only his rapier."</p>

<p>Andy's jaw dropped.</p>

<p>"Is that what he told you?" he cried. "Why, <i>señora</i>, it is
true that Ramón was fighting a bear with only his sword and his
cloak, and that I did shoot the bear, because I thought it a very
foolish and dangerous thing, but Ramón was angry with me for doing
so, saying that I spoiled his sport and that if I had not
interfered he would have killed the bear himself, as indeed I think
he might." He was blankly astonished at hearing this version of the
affair. Then he laughed aloud, so whole-heartedly that the whole
patio looked up.</p>

<p>"Do you know, <i>señora</i>," he cried boyishly, "I think that
Ramón told you that because he wished you to think well of me."</p>

<p>"What I think, me," said Doña Engracia placidly, "is that you
and my son are very good friends. And, <i>señor</i>," she added,
again laying her hand on his arm, "for that I am content."</p>

<p>Andy was touched. His bold eyes softened, and turned&mdash;to
encounter those of the girl glancing sidewise under her lashes.
They hardened. Her lashes fell.</p>

<p>"Do you know, <i>señora</i>," he pronounced with slow
deliberation, "what of all things has most impressed me in your
California?"</p>

<p>"No. Don Andres, what is that?"</p>

<p>"Why, it is just this matter of your men's courage in the case
of these bears. To us men of the mountains these animals have
always been beasts to avoid if possible, but the <i>vaqueros</i>
kill them with the reata, as I have seen many times. I have heard,"
his voice drawled the words one by one, "that they even tame them
to dance at the <i>fiestas</i>, which seems to me quite
extraordinary and not to be believed."</p>

<p>Doña Engracia did not at once reply. She glanced at him
speculatively. He was looking not at her, but at the girl bent over
the embroidery frame. She smiled secretly to herself.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I have seen just this thing," she answered at
last, "and perhaps you too shall see it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Andy, "but, <i>señora</i>, these must be the
small <i>oso negro</i>. The great white bears of the mountains must
be a different matter. What think you, <i>señorita</i>?" he
demanded suddenly.</p>

<p>Carmel raised her eyes. Her lips sketched a faint mocking
smile.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me, <i>señor</i>?" she asked demurely. "I know
little of bears&mdash;or of men."</p>

<p>Her eyes fell, but not before they had flashed a glance at
Faquita. Andy felt the child's fingers stiffen within his own. He
was dismayed. He had not intended thus to betray her confidence.
All at once the blaze of his reaction to challenge died. He
discovered himself, without defence, alone in a patio full of
women.</p>

<p>Fortunately at this instant Ramón's gay voice sounded in the
hallway, and a moment later the young man entered the
courtyard.</p>

<p>"<i>Holá</i>!" he cried, "the lazy one! And where do I find him?
As I might have known, like a sultan of the Turks with the women
all about him! What said I of the <i>doncellitas</i>? Are you
already caught?"</p>

<p>He glanced mischievously at his older sister. Carmel made a face
at her brother, covertly, which, nevertheless, Andy saw. On a
sudden inspiration he drew the child before his knees.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said he, his confidence returning with a rush. "Here
she is. She is my <i>doncellita</i>, and I am her <i>caballero</i>,
ready to defend her to the death!"</p>

<p>"<i>Holá</i>!" shouted Ramón, "but this is good, the so-serious
one! <i>Madre mia</i>, you cannot conceive of how so-serious this
one is. And when he makes the <i>burla</i> all the little smaller
angels clap their wings like the cock until the good San Pedro must
make them quiet like the schoolmaster."</p>

<p>He surveyed his friend, his head on one side.</p>

<p>"You shall see him, madre mia, as I first saw him, with his
clothes all so black and somber like the Judas in the <i>fiesta</i>
of the Holy Week, and his horse like the sheep that hang his head,
and his face like the saint of wood, so I think to myself his name
should be Don Doloroso, and his eye solemn like the dark water, and
no smile at all."</p>

<p>He laughed again contagiously. Doña Engracia smiled her slow,
indulgent smile. Andy's stern face lightened with amusement at this
description of himself.</p>

<p>"You shall see!" cried Ramón. "Soon we shall dress his inside
like his outside, and then he will be all <i>californio</i>. But
come, now you must see the horse I have for you to ride."</p>

<p>Succeeding the young man's departure a dead silence of several
minutes was broken at last by Vicenta's fat chuckle.</p>

<p>"What are you cackling about?" demanded Carmel sharply.</p>

<p>"A dog that starts many hares catches none," quoted Vicenta
cryptically.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>RAMÓN showed Andy the horse. Andy met, and liked, Ramón's
brothers, tall, grave, handsome, courteous&mdash;Ygnacio,
Cristóbal, and the young Felipe. He followed his host on an
inspection of the nearer activities of the community, and
everywhere was introduced with a high formality to all sorts of
people, great and small; and was by them greeted with a respectful
but familiar friendliness that seemed genuine and that warmed him
within. There were many industries forward, in a spacious and
leisurely sort of fashion, mostly in the hands of Californians of
lighter or darker hue. Only when the excursion had extended its
scope to inspect the <i>milpas</i>, the outlying cultivated
gardens, did Andy see any Indians. These were a dozen in number and
were performing their labors under the eye of a plump moon-faced
but nevertheless handsome man, in expression good-humored and in
manner of exquisite courtesy. He was discovered sitting comfortably
enthroned beneath an elevated shade of tules, watching the
activities of the Indians.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Benito," Ramón greeted him. "I have brought my
friend to see your <i>milpas</i> and to make your acquaintance."
The young man spoke carelessly, without formality, as to an
equal.</p>

<p>"You are welcome, <i>señor</i>," said Benito to Andy with grave
courtesy. "You find us at a busy time." Using the willow switch
which he held in his hand as a pointer, he began to tell of the
little domain over which he ruled. It was indeed a small domain, of
but a few acres, but evidently to Benito it was wide enough to
contain all life.</p>

<p>He spoke slowly, in sweet modulated accents, always with a grave
and deferential courtesy that invested the common-place with plumes
and ruffles. He told simple things. And yet by some magic of
personality he made of the tiny <i>milpas</i> a wide seigneury, and
of the homely affairs over which he presided grave matters of high
estate moving majestically. Andy was at once fascinated and drawn
into the illusion. With Benito he arose to a high rarefied air of
lofty converse, himself almost visibly growing plumed hats and
ruffles.</p>

<p>Andy was told that the yellow slugs had overrun the cabbage
patch, and he learned that fact with the concern appropriate to a
great lord who hears of barbaric invasions. In due and proper
sequence he heard also of what Benito had done about it, and he
knew the relief of a threatened populace saved by the wisdom of its
ruler. Having finished with the slug matter, Benito leisurely took
up bugs, squirrels, birds, rabbits, deer; and how at times it was
necessary to guard against the latter with the rattling of sticks,
and loud shrieks, and torches by night, until the peaceful
appearing <i>milpas</i> became to Andy's imagination, directed by
Benito, a field of drama. He was for the moment intensely a
partisan. He listened breathless to Benito's account of the swarms
of linnets swirling like clouds to the feast when the berries or
the smaller fruit's ripened. He wanted to do something about it:
something should be done. His mind cast about for expedients. Why,
he asked Benito, could he not use nets&mdash;or perhaps poisoned
grain&mdash;or&mdash;</p>

<p>But Benito spoke from the high comfortable plane of calm
tolerance.</p>

<p>"No, <i>señor</i>," said he, "that I cannot do. They get theirs:
I get mine. I just plant for two."</p>

<p>Finally Ramón indicated that the visit was at an end, but Benito
insisted that they must first visit his house.</p>

<p>"It is the hour of <i>comida,</i> señores," said he, "and my
house will be honored."</p>

<p>Ramón hesitated and turned to Andy.</p>

<p>"Will they not miss us at the <i>casa</i>?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"No," Ramón told him, "not for the noon meal."</p>

<p>So Benito led the way to a small adobe structure in one corner
of the milpa. It was a crude affair, with coarse <i>serapes</i> for
doors. A half-dozen dogs and twice as many small children tumbled
about together. The oldest of the latter was not over twelve years
of age. The smaller wore nothing at all; the larger, apparently,
only a single smock-like garment. They ceased their play and stared
and drew close about until waved aside by Benito's lordly
gesture.</p>

<p>He called, and instantly appeared a woman, also handsome, also
comfortably fat, with the sleek hair, the romantic eyes, and the
white teeth of her race. She was barefoot and wore only a coarse
linen waist and a short skirt of dark serge. But she greeted Ramón
by name and smiled at the stranger with no constraint or
embarrassment, and brought wine and little cakes until the meal
should be prepared, and stood by so graciously at ease that the
primitive crudity, for which neither she nor Benito offered
apology, sank to complete unimportance. After a moment she bowed
her sleek head and disappeared.</p>

<p>The children stared with great solemn eyes. Benito surveyed them
complacently. In answer to Andy's question he affirmed them as
his.</p>

<p>"That is to say, five of them are born of us two," he amended.
"The others also the good saints have sent to us from God."</p>

<p>As Andy did not understand this phrase, Benito went on in his
leisurely fashion to explain that these were orphans, adopted into
his family. He shrugged aside Andy's rather appalled amazement.</p>

<p>"The hen that has twenty chickens scratches no more than for
one," said he carelessly.</p>

<p>They finished their wine and cakes. Shortly they were summoned
inside, where the men ate of simple fare. The woman did not eat.
The place was bare, with hardened earthen floor. There was no
table. They sat in crude chairs of rawhide and wood and were served
in clay dishes, <i>cajetes</i>. When they had finished Ramón arose
and handed his <i>cajete</i> to the hostess.</p>

<p>"<i>Muchas gracias, señora</i>," said he politely.</p>

<p>"<i>Buen provecho, señor</i>," she returned graciously.</p>

<p>The two, she and Benito, stood side by side watching the
departure of their guests. Andy looked back. Instantly they
smiled.</p>

<p>"I like them," said Andy to his friend. Ramón nodded.</p>

<p>"They are of our blood," said he. "He is a Rivera. One of our
bastards," he added carelessly.</p>

<p>From the <i>milpas</i> they proceeded by easy stages down the
slope of the hill toward the line of cottonwoods and willows that
marked the course of the stream. But their progress was slow. There
were many things to see. Especially was Andy fascinated by
threshing operations that were forward in a small flat field fenced
in by palings of greasewood. Here the earth had been hardened and
beaten flat, and on it the grain had been piled to a depth of two
or three feet. At the moment of the young man's approach several
<i>manadas</i> of mares, over a hundred in all, were being urged
through the opening by mounted <i>vaqueros</i>. The gate was
closed; and at once the horsemen, shouting and swinging their
reatas, urged the mares to a run. Around and around the circle they
swept at full speed. The dust arose in clouds, in which disappeared
and reappeared again the flying half-guessed figures. The men
yelled, the mares nickered and squealed and were answered
frantically by their stallions outside. Faster and faster they
whirled. And then suddenly the men cut square across the arc.</p>

<p>"<i>Yeguas! Yeguas!</i>" they screamed.</p>

<p>The startled mares, headed in full flight; tossed, plunged,
jostled together, slid stiff legged, turned in the other direction,
overturning the piled-up straw to the very bottom. Thus the grain
was separated. Later it would be thrown from wooden shovels against
the afternoon breeze to winnow away the chaff. It was a wild sight.
Andy would have liked to linger, but Ramón led him on.</p>

<p>On the way to the stream they met the water carriers, the
<i>aguadores</i>, each perched on the rump of his donkey, and the
casks slung before him on either side. They had bedecked their
burros with flowers and were tearing up the slope as fast as they
could urge their obstinate animals, laughing and shouting. When
they saw Ramón, however, they pulled down, with some difficulty, to
a more sober pace, and tried to look virtuous. Ramón responded to
their greetings with a severity which obviously did not much
impress them, though they tried to look meek and penitent.</p>

<p>"To race is forbidden," Ramón told his friend, as they went on,
"for thus they break the water kegs; If it had been Don Sylvestre,
now; or Ygnacio, who is serious&mdash;but well the rascals know
that I&mdash;but here, you see, we make the brick for the house.
But you have seen that at the mission."</p>

<p>A group of men were feeding great lumps of adobe clay into a
wooden mill; others barefooted were treading the resultant powder
with water into the proper consistency; still others pressed the
mixture, bound with straw, into the moulds. But here the process
diverged from the mission practise. Into the soft bricks the
artisan pressed bright-colored pebbles and shells to form pleasing
patterns; and in one lot&mdash;gorgeous conception&mdash;had been
embedded cattle skulls with the horns out.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ramón, "the <i>padres</i> are the serious ones. We
are more gay."</p>

<p>Indeed more gay, Andy thought; for the workmen themselves smiled
at the young man as though sharing some secret joke or pleasure, in
marked contrast to the stolid brutishness of the Indians.</p>

<p>Their excursion ended at the stream side, where many women knelt
in a row, beating garments and linen against stones. Some were very
old and wrinkled; some young and very pretty; but all possessed of
a shrill gayety and a busy tongue. They were not at all abashed by
the holiday magnificence of the two young men, but shrieked rapid
impertinences which Ramón parried in kind, but which would utterly
have routed the bewildered Andy had he been alone. He was glad to
withdraw in fair order under cover of his friend. Ramón laughed at
his confusion.</p>

<p>"They are only <i>mozas</i>," said he. "There is nothing to be
escare of them. And I think you like some day we go to the
<i>fandango</i>, and you find they like you much. Some of them very
nice, and if they like you very much, they not so cruel as the
<i>doncellitas</i>." He glanced slyly at Andy. "How you like one
little Benito to take care of your <i>milpas</i> when he grow
big?"</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>ONLY at close of day did all the family assemble in the great
<i>sala</i>, Don Sylvestre and the Doña Engracia, the four tall
sons, the young woman and the little girl. No constraint rested on
the occasion; but, to Andy at least, its complete ease was a bit
stiffened by ceremonial. Don Sylvestre occupied a large chair at
the end of the room where he consumed a succession of cigarettes.
None of the other men smoked: that would have been considered a
mark of great disrespect. Doña Engracia and Carmel bent over their
embroidery frames. The young men exercised a wandering commission;
chatting with one another, teasing their sisters. After a little a
guitar was produced, and in turn and in unison they sang, very
sweetly, the haunting, minor-cadenced songs of Spain. Ramón tried
in vain to persuade Andy to sing one of the trappers' songs.</p>

<p>"But you should hear them as I have heard him sing them to the
cattle, at night," he appealed to the others. "They are wild, like
the mountains."</p>

<p>The others murmured their applause. But Andy was confused,
embarrassed at the mere idea. He muttered a refusal,
self-conscious, ill at ease.</p>

<p>For the first time Carmel raised her head from the embroidery
frame. "That I also should like to hear, <i>Señor caballero</i>,"
she said. "I beg of you."</p>

<p>Her expression was innocent. Her eyes looked full into Andy's
with a widened guilelessness. Nevertheless, he sensed a hidden
mockery, and his confusion fell from him. He returned her glance
coolly.</p>

<p>"I must stand excused, <i>señorita</i>," said he, with a level
iron finality. At the same time he inclined toward her in easy
politeness. She continued for a moment to stare at him, and a faint
line sketched itself between her brows. She was puzzled; as why
not? for all her preconceptions of the rough frontiersman, <i>el
oso</i>, were overset. Andy, it is true, had no schooling in formal
manners, but his nature was based on simplicity and directness, and
he had lived for years among the most ceremonial and dignified
people in the world, the Blackfeet Indians. A slow flush of mingled
surprise and vexation mounted her cheeks. The vexation was not
diminished by Ramón's fleeting but appreciative smile.</p>

<p>It was a small drama, swiftly played, but it was duly relished
by all the spectators. The surface gravity of the young men became
more profound; Doña Engracia permitted herself a veiled glance of
placid amusement; the child, Faquita, sidled over to clasp Andy's
hand. She looked up at him with an air of mature coquettishness
comical in so small a creature.</p>

<p>"But you will sing the song of the mountain to me, will you not,
<i>señor caballero</i>?" she asked assuredly. "Remember, I am your
<i>doncellita</i>!"</p>

<p>"You must not tease our guest," chided Doña Engracia.</p>

<p>But Andy smiled down at her gravely from his great height.</p>

<p>"Since you are my <i>doncellita</i>, I must sing for you alone,"
said he.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>FOR some reason Andy was again comfortable, at ease with these
pleasant people. Their manner, their grave ceremony, their luxury
of living no longer embarrassed him. His spirit was able to move
among them freely and confidently. His powers of analysis were not
sufficient to tell him why this was: nor could he have explained to
himself the glow of his expansion toward them. Possibly he had a
dim perception of approval; that their secret appraisal of him had
warmed. Don Sylvestre summoned him and talked to him for some time,
asking many questions. The conversation, in external aspects, was
so formal as almost to be stilted; yet the hidden residue of its
effect was familiar. The company rose at a very early hour, soon
after eight o'clock. Ramón accompanied his friend along the
colonnade of the patio to his room.</p>

<p>"You like the <i>hacienda</i>?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Very much," replied Andy.</p>

<p>"That is fine! And tomorrow we shall ride with Papá, and you
shall see the land and the cattle. My papá, he like you very much.
Yes, that is true. I know my papá. He is very great <i>hidalgo</i>,
and he say not much, but he look always, and he like you; that I
know. He will fix things. That you shall see. He do not escare you
any more?" asked Ramón shrewdly. "No? That is good. And my mama,
she like you very much; and my brothers, all, they tell it to me
that you are <i>como hijo de la casa</i>. Is not that fine? Are you
not glad? Me, I am very glad. Do you not like them? But yes, I see
that you like them. How you like Carmel?" he asked suddenly. "Is
not she beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Very beautiful," agreed Andy shortly.</p>

<p>"And she like you very much also," persisted Ramón.</p>

<p>Andy snorted, shocked into frankness.</p>

<p>Ramón lifted the candle and held it close to his friend's
face.</p>

<p>"<i>Amigo</i>," said he, "you are to me a very wonderful man.
You have live the life of danger and of fight, and you know the men
of the wild countries, and how to catch the beaver and kill the
beast, and you can do many things, and when you will talk and I can
listen I sit with my mouth open wide for the fly to come inside.
But one thing I think you do not know at all, not one little esmall
bit, and that is about women; and when I tell you somethings about
the woman, you will sit quiet and put on the little-boy face, and
you will say to me, 'Yes, Ramón,' and 'No, Ramón;' You understand
me?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" protested Andy.</p>

<p>"'But!'" mocked Ramón. "Is that to say 'Yes, Ramón,' and 'No,
Ramón'? I tell you, Carmel also like you very much."</p>

<p>Andy shrugged.</p>

<p>"All right," he agreed dryly. "She does! But if so, why should
she act the way she does?"</p>

<p>"Did I not say you know nothing of the woman?" cried Ramón. "Why
does she act that way she does! Why, because that is the way the
<i>doncellita</i> act."</p>

<p>Andy was sardonically skeptical, but he said nothing more. He
ascribed Ramón's statement to that young man's liking for himself.
He stretched himself between the cool sheets, when Ramón had gone,
with a sigh of sheer comfort, not as much of body as of spirit. It
is nice to be liked; it is even nicer to be told so. He himself had
sensed the young men's somewhat admiring secret approval; nor could
he mistake the placid and motherly kindliness of Doña Engracia. He
suspected the former to be a sort of hero worship engendered by
Ramón's' adventure narratives; and the latter to embrace all things
dear to a favorite son. Andy was clear eyed and hard headed when
the question was of practical estimations. Faquita was
whole-heartedly his: he smiled slowly in the darkness at the
thought of that youngster. Don Sylvestre was as yet an enigma. He
was meticulously polite; he engaged Andy in rather stilted
conversations apart; conversations that consisted of questions by
Don Sylvestre and answers by Andy, whom questioning made
uncomfortable. But Andy was content to accept Ramón's certainty
that he was well disposed. Though, Andy grinned to himself, he did
not show it! And he made no mention whatever of the business that
was, after all, the real reason for Andy's visit to the
<i>hacienda</i>.</p>

<p>There remained, of the family, only Carmel. Andy all at once
realized that he had wilfully put off thinking about Carmel,
dawdling through all the other members of the family, holding her
out as long as he could. And now that, in due order, he had
disposed of the others, he must come to her. What about her?</p>

<p>Why, he disliked her, of course. Did he? Why? She had described
him as a bear from the mountains and boasted that she would tame
him to dance for her. No man of spirit would stand for that. Now,
Andy was probably one of the least vain young men alive; but in
some respects the life he had led had left him younger than his
years, as in others it had made him far older. And a small imp
whispered that the remark had been made before she had seen him;
and that his California foofaraw became him pretty well; and that
he had borne himself not so badly, and that there was a faint
chance that Ramón knew what he was talking about. Scandalized, he
banished the small imp, but he had heard the whisper. Ramón was
right about one thing, anyway: she <i>was</i> very beautiful. As
for the rest&mdash;</p>

<p>As usual, when Andy had involved himself about so far in
introspection, he gave it up. His mind emptied itself for
sleep.</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter VII. Fiesta</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THE five days succeeding Andy's arrival at the <i>hacienda</i>
of the Riveras had been busy with preparation. <i>Caponeras</i> of
the best horses had been driven in for the use of the visitors, and
were now being held by the <i>vaqueros</i> in the bottom lands.
Rude shelters of tules had been erected, and conveniences for
camping had been arranged beneath the spreading live oaks. A wide
space in front of the great house had been roofed with branches
laid across poles. Three sides of this were enclosed in cotton
cloth which the women had been very busy decorating with ribbons
and with artificial flowers. The fourth side was barred off by a
strong rail, Andy, as always inquisitive for reasons for the things
that interested him, wanted to know.</p>

<p>"For the dance," Ramón told him; and as for the rail, that was
to keep the horses out. Andy wanted to know what horses had to do
with it; but Ramón was too busy for conversation. Everybody was
busy, cheerfully busy. The women swarmed in and out of the various
rooms in the <i>casa</i>; in and out of the kitchens; the patio.
Messengers darted to the <i>milpas</i> and back, bearing fruits or
vegetables. Men killed two steers, and skinned them and cleaned
them, and cut one of them up for the kitchen, and hung the other
whole from one of the live oak trees where it swung, free for
anybody who at any time cared to cut from it a steak. There seemed
to be a thousand things to attend to. Andy wanted to help but could
not even get instructions. So he wandered about alone until the
child Faquita joined him. And Faquita was much too excited to talk
of anything but the fact that for the first time she was to be
permitted to attend the festivities as a grown-up.</p>

<p>"Remember, you are my <i>caballero</i>!" she warned Andy over
and over.</p>

<p>The hurry and disorder rose like a storm until it seemed that
utter confusion must forever prevail. And then suddenly it fell to
a flat calm. Andy found himself, dressed in his best, standing
before the great door with all the Riveras, while the
<i>hacienda</i> waited in a peace of smiling welcome.</p>

<p>The first of the guests arrived a little after noon, and the
last just before sunset. They came in astonishing numbers. A great
many, the majority, were on horseback. The women and girls rode
men's saddles, but there hung across the saddle in the place of
stirrups a brilliant piece of silk of red or blue or green, at
least a yard in width, joined at the ends, puffed out like a bunch
of flowers at the fastening. They wore wide straw hats beneath
which, for coolness, flapped sun cloths embroidered at the four
corners with gold and silver beads. The ever present <i>rebozo</i>
was flung to the left side. Their faces had been whitened with
powdered eggshells. Nevertheless, what with their red lips and
sparkling eyes and their gay apparel and, above all, their assured
and expert use of all their advantages, they were very alluring. A
few of the horses carried double. The girl sat the saddle; the man
bestrode the <i>arqueta</i> behind her, holding her with one arm
and guiding the horse with the other. In such case she wore the
man's hat, her own slung at her side; while he rode bareheaded
except for his handkerchief of silk; and the spirited animal, neck
arched, ears slanted in virtue, stepped daintily as though proud of
his burden.</p>

<p>Arrived in the open space before the <i>casa</i> they drew rein.
At once the servants of the <i>hacienda</i> surrounded them. Some
held the horses by the bits. Others removed the spurs from the
heels of the <i>caballeros</i>, who flipped them silver coins. One
dignified, erect old gentleman with the lofty bearing of a true
grandee tossed the <i>mozo</i> gold. Then they dismounted and
advanced with the greatest dignity to their waiting hosts. The men
bowed from the waist; the women curtseyed. A few, men or women,
embraced Don Sylvestre and Doña Engracia, arms around, cheek to
cheek, looking smiling to left and right; but these were friends of
very long standing. They did not kiss. Andy bowed and bowed and
bowed again, looking into faces, looking into eyes sedate with
ceremony; but friendly, all friendly, and some with a flash of
curiosity or coquetry or of covert admiration. He heard the murmur
of names&mdash;Arrellanes, Carillo, Jimino, Yorba, Lugo, de la
Cuesta, Alvarado, Estudillo, Vallejo, Ramirez, de la
Torre&mdash;some of which later he was to remember well. Now they
caressed his ear liquid as the ripple of waters. Their owners
passed on and immediately disappeared; some under conduct by the
servants; others finding their own way with the assurance of
familiarity.</p>

<p>These were the <i>caballeros</i> and the <i>doñas</i> and
<i>doncellitas</i>. There seemed no end to them. But still other
parties, obviously of a humbler class, rode in, even more
numerously; men and women both. These dismounted without help from
the <i>mozos</i>, and bowed from a distance, and were bid welcome
by Don Sylvestre, and led their horses away.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. From time to time unearthly squeals and groans
warned of the approach of an ox-drawn <i>carreta</i>, From each
<i>rancho</i> and <i>hacienda</i> came one of these crude vehicles
heaped with baggage. But occasionally one carried guests: older
women, or bevies of girls who preferred this conveyance to the
saddle. Such <i>carretas</i> were canopied, and heaped with
cushions or sheepskins; and they, and the oxen, were decorated with
ribbons and flowers. Nevertheless, they jolted along shrieking and
springless; they moved in a cloud of dust; and Andy could but
admire the unquenched high spirits of their passengers. They came,
and still they came. The house swarmed with people. Beneath every
great oak was a group. Multitudes seemed to Andy's confused senses
to fill even the open spaces. He found himself wondering where they
were all to sleep; how they were all to be fed. But nobody seemed
to be worrying about that.</p>

<p>At length he recognized the tall figure of Panchito, who
approached and said something to Don Sylvestre. The latter nodded.
Ramón touched his friend on the arm.</p>

<p>"They have all come," said he. "Let us go."</p>

<p>The receiving line dispersed; the women to the <i>casa</i>, Don
Sylvestre in search of some friend of his own age and station. The
brothers and Andy strolled away to join one of the groups under the
live oaks.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>ANDY saw no more of the women until after dark. They disappeared
in the <i>casa</i>, together with the baggage brought in by the
<i>carretas</i>, Nor did any of the men venture to invade that
retreat. They arranged themselves in either one or another of the
temporary tule huts, or in the open under the spreading oaks. Some
were squatted about talking, exchanging news or arguing on some
point of politics. Others gathered about the possessor of a guitar.
A larger concourse had rallied about a cockfight. A few
connoisseurs had mounted horse and ridden to the bottom lands,
where they examined the <i>caponera</i> and commented on the
animals it contained. But already the choicest had been saddled
with guests' accoutrement and now stood near the <i>casa</i> just
in case, as was improbable at this late hour, anyone should fancy
to ride.</p>

<p>Ramón, followed by Andy, moved here and there from group to
group, everywhere hailed with enthusiasm. He paused for a moment
with each, exchanged a flash or so of repartee, and moved on. Andy
had anticipated for himself a certain embarrassment among
strangers; but there was none. The young men neither ignored him
nor too pointedly included him. Rather they accepted him
carelessly, so that when, after a little, Ramón disappeared, the
American found he could join any group, not as its guest or its
spectator, but as one of it; and that nobody noticed particularly
whether he talked or not; and that they turned to him for opinion
as easily and naturally as to each other. In short, he was made at
ease; and he liked these people; and be began to think he might
even like this dreaded <i>fiesta</i>. For the moment he had
forgotten the women, and was having a heartening masculine time of
it, so that when Ramón suddenly reappeared with the guitar and
commanded him to sing one of his trappers' songs, he complied
without hesitation. It was evident they liked it. One young man,
one of the Lugos, it seemed, took the instrument from Andy's hands
when he had finished, touched the chords tentatively, his head on
one side, humming the tune of the song. His musical memory was
astonishing considering the fact that he had heard the air but the
once, and that the type of music was so totally dissimilar to that
of the Spanish. From time to time he appealed to Andy.</p>

<p>"How goes it here, señor?"</p>

<p>And Andy would hum with him in unison. Shortly the young
Californian had it. He was immensely taken with the strange
lilt.</p>

<p>"But that is fresh: that is original!" cried Lugo. "But the
words: those I could never say. What mean they?"</p>

<p>He listened to Andy's rough translation and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Those things are strange to me," he said. "I shall make words.
What words?" He pondered for a moment. "That is not a song of love,
nor is it a song of war, nor yet a song of the swallow or the dove
or such things. Ha! I know! It is a song of you! I shall make it!
You shall see; and it will be the Song of Don Largo, as Ramón has
named you, tall like the mountains from which he comes, with the
eye of gray like the rocks, and the strength of the wild wind in
the peaks, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop, stop!" cried Andy, laughing.</p>

<p>"But no! I have it! Wait! Listen!" Young Lugo struck the flat of
his hand on the strings of the guitar and began, at first
hesitatingly, then with swifter assurance, to sing his
improvisation to the tune of the trappers' melody. It was not bad
impromptu verse; but unquestionably it was high flown, not to say
hifalutin, and its content should have embarrassed the modest Andy
to tears, if any of his old companions among the mountain men had
been present! but there were none; and somehow all this foofaraw
went naturally with all the other foofaraw, so Andy lay back on his
elbow and grinned happily and quite impersonally. The by-standers
listened, patting softly or nodding their heads in time to the
lively lilt. A few, then more, struck into the air with one ear
cocked for the words. At the final chord a shout of applause.</p>

<p>"<i>Bravo! Bravo! Holá!</i>" they cried. "Again! again!"</p>

<p>This time all joined in the air, catching at snatches of the
words as they remembered them, filling the gaps with humming. The
group was augmented by those within hearing. Over and over they
tried it, until the whole chorus was shouting out the Song of Don
Largo with enormous gusto. Nobody, for the moment, paid any
attention to Andy.</p>

<p>Dusk had fallen. Under the trees the servants had lighted fires.
Shortly came women bearing kettles of various food and flasks of
wine and cups and plates and spoons, which they set down. Each
helped himself. From the suspended beef they cut steaks which they
roasted over the fires, squatting on their heels. Young Lugo had
wandered away. Andy found himself surrounded by strangers; but he
did not feel strange. They addressed him easily and naturally as
one of themselves; or let him alone as the case might be. He was at
ease. Still the women did not appear.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>BUT now Ramón was at his elbow holding the reins of two saddled
horses.</p>

<p>"Come," said he.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"The dance begins," said Ramón.</p>

<p>Andy did not see why one should not walk the short hundred yards
to the pavilion, but he mounted obediently. Before the stout rail
they drew rein, and around them and behind them crowded all the
other young men, also mounted. From the elevation of the saddle
Andy could see the whole interior of the pavilion.</p>

<p>It was brilliantly lighted with hundreds of candles. At one end
an orchestra of guitars, violins, and flutes was softly tuning. The
older men, Don Sylvestre among them, flanked them on either side.
Against the other two walls of the room the girls and older women
were seated in chairs.</p>

<p>At first Andy was dazzled, and a little frightened by the
thought that he must shortly venture before this formidable array.
His impression was of color and light and slow movement. Then, as
Ramón showed no present intention of dismounting, he recovered
himself.</p>

<p>Doña Engracia was seated directly opposite to him, with older
women to her right and to her left. Farther down the room were the
younger women and the girls. They were dressed very much alike in
dresses whose colors blended and harmonized. Indeed, had Andy known
it, this harmony was the result of a close consultation as to what
each was to wear, for the baggage carried many costumes of many
colors so that an appropriate choice might be made. Feminine
standardization is not so modern, after all. All of these damsels
of an earlier day wore their hair cut square across the forehead; a
lock curled along each cheek. Nets of color or of gold confined the
mass of it in the back. A few, the more advanced in fashion, wore
the high comb, later universal, but as yet the very newest thing
from Mexico. All draped the silken <i>rebozo</i> about the head or
shoulder; all were clad in jackets of silk buttoned high in the
neck, but fitted to set off well the allurements of a beautiful
figure; all spread ample white skirts with wide embroidered hems
from beneath which peeped trim ankles red-stockinged in silk, and
low shoes with silver buckles. Around their waists were broad
scarlet ribbons whose golden ends nearly touched the floor.
Necklaces of pearls from Baja California and long eardrops
completed the costume. Except for the broad fan, which each waved
slowly before her breast, and which was the cause of Andy's first
impression of movement.</p>

<p>A personable young man stepped to the middle of the floor. His
appearance seemed to be a signal, for the musicians at once struck
up. At the same time the other young men outside began to rein
their horses to and fro in a slow weaving movement. However, Ramón,
as eldest son, and Andy as his guest, did not take part in this
maneuver, but sat immobile, facing the barrier.</p>

<p>The young man raised his hands and danced gracefully in time to
the music across the floor toward Carmel. He clapped his palms
together twice. She arose, placed her hand in his. He held it high,
and, still in time to the music, led her to the center of the
pavilion. There he stood aside. Carmel, holding her skirts
outspread, executed a dozen slow and languorous dance steps. Her
lithe body swayed, her little red-clad feet glided to the slow
tempo. The young man, aside, swayed also, and his feet moved, but
rather as though echoing the dance than as sharing it. His eyes
languished down at her in a disgusting manner. At least, that was
Andy's reaction. And her eyes, as she danced, peeped up at him from
beneath her lashes in a fashion which&mdash;to Andy&mdash;was
altogether too bold for modesty. Suddenly he knew he did not like
this young man. He looked effeminate; and his manner was too
assured. Andy felt himself already a member of this household and
privileged to resentment on its behalf. Certainly, if any sister of
his&mdash;</p>

<p>He looked toward Ramón, but that young man appeared to be quite
undisturbed. He caught Andy's glance and smiled.</p>

<p>"That is <i>el tecolero</i>&mdash;what you call?&mdash;the
master of the dance," he explained.</p>

<p>The exhibition, if such it was, lasted but a few seconds.
Already Carmel had resumed her seat, like a butterfly settling, and
the <i>tecolero</i> was clapping his hands before the girl on her
right. The latter, Andy now saw with considerable astonishment, was
his little friend, the child Faquita. He had not recognized her, in
her ceremonial costume, for in all respects she was a miniature of
those about her, even to the string of pearls and the long pendants
in her ears. With entire self-possession she duplicated her
sister's performance even to the languishment of the upturned eyes.
Only a certain exaggerated gravity of conscientiousness in what she
was doing betrayed the child in her. And it must be admitted that
<i>el tecolero</i> was just as devoted in demeanor as he had been
to her beautiful sister.</p>

<p>Thus one by one he led the bright butterflies forth to flutter
their instant in the center of the stage. The man was tireless.
Never for a moment did he cease following with the rhythm of his
feet and body the beat and throb of the music. The orchestra seemed
equally tireless. The music rose and fell, now whispering, now
swelling, like the wind in trees. Occasionally one or another of
the guitarists caught up a bar or two of the melody with his voice.
The fans waved slowly; the flames of the candles bent and
recovered; in the half darkness beyond the barrier the horses
weaved to and fro, in and out.</p>

<p>After each of the younger women had thus been given her turn
before the eyes of all, <i>el tecolero</i> danced his way to Doña
Engracia. But she merely arose, touched his uplifted hand, revolved
slowly twice, and reseated herself. And so with the other older
women, the <i>dueñas</i>, As the last of these resumed her chair
the orchestra leader cried loudly, "<i>Bomba!</i>" and the music
ceased. At once arose a chatter of voices.</p>

<p>"Now we shall dance," said Ramón, bending low to remove his
spurs. He leaped from his saddle, threw the reins over his horse's
head, and, hat in hand, entered the pavilion.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>MANY of the young men followed his example; but as others still
kept the saddle, Andy felt that he could do so also. He had no
desire to venture on the floor. He knew nothing of these matters;
it was better to watch.</p>

<p>The dances succeeded one another in bewildering and interesting
variety. Some of them were general affairs in which many took part;
others were solo exhibitions. The <i>tecolero</i> directed. The
young Felipe sidled his horse alongside Andy's. He was not yet
twenty, it appeared, and so was not permitted to take part in a
<i>sone</i> such as this; though, with his father's permission, he
might attend the less formal <i>baile</i>, and of course the
intimate small <i>valecito casaros</i>, the impromptu parties. Andy
was glad of his explanations, for without them the meaning of what
was going on was sometimes obscure.</p>

<p>For example, the dancers paired, the couples "balanced," formed
circles, the men passing in one direction; the women in the other,
until again the partners were opposite, It was a very simple dance,
but its performance required a certain majestic grace of movement
which raised it from banality to beauty. Felipe called it <i>la
jota</i>.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was in many of these dances a certain childlike
quality of simplicity, stark in structure, but lovely in the
clothing of grace and gayety. Thus equal numbers of men and women
formed a ring about a lone man in the center, around whom they
circled in time to the music. The orchestra leader sang the verses
of an apparently interminable song. At intervals all the men,
including him who was alone in the center, embraced the nearest
woman. Naturally, as the numbers were unequal, one must get left;
and he took the place in the center to a chorus of joyous cries,
<i>burro! el burro!</i> Felipe told Andy that the signal for these
changes was a certain catch word in the verses which each,
naturally, was vigilant to hear. A variation compelled the man thus
caught instantly to recite an original quatrain, supposedly
impromptu, celebrating the charms of the lady to whom the chance of
the moment had brought him opposite. A vote by acclamation decided
whether the effort was worthy, or whether the perpetrator should be
dismissed from the dance. It was a pretty test of wit; and Andy was
very sure he could never take part in it. Nor indeed, he thought,
in any of the others, as his eye followed with growing pleasure the
stately and enchanting grace of their movement.</p>

<p>In these general dances for the whole company the men chose
their partners. But the reverse was the case for the solos. Then
the girl snatched a man's hat and, perching it rakishly atop her
head, darted away pursued by its owner.</p>

<p>It was the challenge to dance. Some of these solos were
remarkable, but, Andy learned from Felipe, they were all known and
standardized and named, and their performance critically estimated.
One of the most astonishing, to him, was executed by Carmel.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Andy had found his eyes constantly
returning to Carmel, and the fact irritated him, though, if he had
paused to think of it, he would not have understood why. He did not
approve of Carmel. To his sober mind she was much too conspicuous.
She made eyes over her fan at everything in breeches that came in
range. In the dances she turned and twisted her lithe body after a
fashion that Andy thought immodest. She had daubed her face with
too much powdered eggshells. She was altogether too&mdash;well, too
vivid. She was having much too good a time: and Andy illogically
resented it. She danced promiscuously with everybody who came
along&mdash;and they swarmed about her. She danced continuously
with that <i>tecolero</i> popinjay. Andy entertained equally these
two ideas without a thought of their inconsistency. Now she had
clapped the popinjay's hat on her head and had scampered about the
place like a tomboy, and had been grabbed and mauled about and
yanked out in the center of the pavilion, and Doña Engracia sitting
there as placid as you please! Somebody might have asked Andy what
business it was of his, and he could have had no reply; but nobody
did, not even himself.</p>

<p>She signaled the orchestra.</p>

<p>"<i>La bamba!</i>" cried Felipe at the first strains of the
music.</p>

<p>A burst of applause; then dead silence. Arms outspread, Carmel
swayed gently to the rhythm. Someone handed the <i>tecolero</i> a
glass filled with water which he balanced carefully atop her head.
Then he knotted the ends of a handkerchief and laid it on the floor
at her feet. Carmel's movements quickened, her body swaying ever
the more widely, her outspread hands fluttering, her little feet
executing a complicated pattern of steps around and within the
circumference of a small circle in the center of which lay the
knotted handkerchief.</p>

<p>"<i>Holá!</i>" she cried sharply.</p>

<p>There was a quick flip of a foot, a swirl of wide skirts: the
handkerchief had vanished.</p>

<p>"<i>Holá</i>!" she cried again, and there on the tip of her
outpointed toe it hung.</p>

<p>The <i>tecolero</i> removed the unspilled glass from her
head.</p>

<p>A burst of applause burst forth, in which Andy, almost
unwillingly, joined. The younger people shouted, clamored in a wild
informality of enthusiasm; but the older women holding their hands
high over their heads clapped their palms together in the beat of a
measured rhythm.</p>

<p>When the noise had died down Don Sylvestre arose to his
feet.</p>

<p>"<i>Un rosario!</i>" he announced loudly.</p>

<p>Felipe told Andy that this meant a quarter hour's intermission.
In the old days it was called about once in so often, so that the
pious merrymakers might tell their beads; but now it signified
merely a recess. The musicians laid aside their instruments and
betook themselves to the refreshment table outside. The women, for
the most part, disappeared within doors. Ramón returned to reclaim
his horse. He was scandalized to find Andy exactly where he had
left him.</p>

<p>"But these <i>fiesta</i> is for you!" he complained, "and all
the <i>doncellitas</i> await to see you. They have ask me many
time, where is this, the one you speak so much of? Is he
<i>jorobado</i> that he does not show himself?"</p>

<p>"I reckon they'd find my dancing hump-backed even if I ain't,"
said Andy.</p>

<p>"But you make the dance very well with Vicenta at the
<i>rancho</i>. And you have not pay your respec' to my mamá and the
<i>dueñas</i>, That is escandal!"</p>

<p>"All right, I suppose I must do that," conceded Andy
reluctantly. "Your sister did that bamba dance wonderfully," he
said, to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Carmelita? Oh, yes, she do good enough," agreed Ramón with
fraternal indifference.</p>

<p>The ladies were drifting back into the pavilion. Andy saw his
friend's face light up and followed the direction of his eyes to a
girl. She looked to Andy very much like all the other girls of her
age, for he was unskilled in smaller feminine distinctions, and
found it as puzzling then as he would now to distinguish
individuals in the standardized product.</p>

<p>"Who is that <i>señorita</i> just now coming in?" he asked, but
merely because of his friend's obvious interest.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm with which Ramón rose to his question brought to
his lips an involuntary smile, which he instantly erased. But Ramón
caught it.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>amigo</i>, you laugh!" he chided. "You are so near my
heart you read it clear. But is she not beautiful? See, her hair
eshine as she move; and her eye, so deep that in it the soul dive
down, down, like in the sea! And she is <i>pequeña</i> like I joke
to you at the <i>rancho</i>, so that on the top of the so-small
head my chin he just touch!"</p>

<p>"How do you know? Have you tried it?" Andy laughed.</p>

<p>"She is <i>doncellita</i>," he said haughtily. "You must not say
such thing!"</p>

<p>"I am sorry." Andy was distressed at Ramón's heat. "I did not
mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the young Californian was already himself contrite. "No!
no-no!" he cried. "It is I who am sorry! I forget too many things.
I forget you are <i>americano</i>. I, who know, forget your
customs. I forget you do not know the custom of the Espanish
peoples. Forgive me, <i>amigo</i>."</p>

<p>"I was only joking," murmured Andy.</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! But when one loves," Ramón was unembarrassed by the
confession, "one does not touch, one does not espeak unless in the
presence of Mamá or la <i>dueña</i>. No! no-no! That is very
bad!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Andy, "I admit I'm a greenhorn, but it seems to me
that makes it a little difficult&mdash;and just a little
unsatisfactory."</p>

<p>"Unsateesfactory?" Ramón repeated the word. "<i>Ah, lo qué no
convence!</i> But no! I look; I breathe from the heart; and she
look back to me. And by and by, when the dance is finish, I take my
<i>guitarra</i> and I creep so soft to her window and I sing the
song of love!" He hummed softly a few bars of sweet minor cadences.
Abruptly his tone changed. "But I do not know behind which window
she esleep," he said savagely. "That I do not know; and I ask and I
ask and I do not find out. My mamá she just make the esmile; and
the <i>doncellitas</i> they laugh when I ask."</p>

<p>"Won't the young lady herself tell you?"</p>

<p>"Conchita?" Ramón was scandalized. "She tell? But that I would
not ask of her! That would be eshameless!"</p>

<p>"Sorry again!" but Andy could not suppress a chuckle over the
fantastic hopelessness of the situation.</p>

<p>Ramón smiled ruefully; then laid his hand on Andy's arm.</p>

<p>"But you shall do this for me, <i>amigo</i>!" he cried, struck
with a sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>"I? Do what!"</p>

<p>"Find out for me where she esleep."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you wanted me to sing to her," Andy grinned.</p>

<p>But Ramón was now much too serious for joking. He brushed this
aside.</p>

<p>"It will be like this," he proposed rapidly. "You shall make the
dance with <i>la muchachita</i>, with my little sister Faquita. She
will tell you if you do that, for she think you ver' fine and call
you her <i>caballero</i>, and she will be so flatter that she will
tell you all that you ask. She is only little girl, that I know,
but you will do this for me, eh?"</p>

<p>Andy nodded. It was not a bad idea. If he must dance, he would
rather make a fool of himself with the child than with any of the
terrifying <i>doncellitas</i>.</p>

<p>"You haven't told me the lady's name yet&mdash;if I may ask
that," he reminded.</p>

<p>"Ah, no?" Ramón was surprised. "It is Conchita: Conchita de la
Cuesta." The name rippled caressingly from his tongue with the
murmur of flowing waters.</p>

<p>"But that is a beautiful name!" cried Andy. "Ramón, yours is a
beautiful language!"</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Ramón. "But not so beautiful as the English."</p>

<p>"But English is not beautiful."</p>

<p>"But yes!" insisted Ramón, "I think the most beautiful two words
I know are English."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Cellar door," said Ramón; and as he pronounced
it&mdash;celadór&mdash;the syllables were indeed lovely.</p>

<p>His eyes, as he talked; never ceased following the fair
Conchita.</p>

<p>"See how she move, <i>amigo</i>!" he burst forth
again&mdash;"like the deer. And see her so-lovely eshape, and how
when she move this way and that way her so-small breast show itself
like the apple, and the silk so thin that if you look close you may
see the <i>pezón</i> which is undoubtedly like the bud of the
rose."</p>

<p>Andy perceived that this was indeed true. Indeed, he had not
been able to avoid seeing it, though, as a gentleman, he had
conscientiously tried. Now he was astounded to learn that he should
not try. It was too much for him. One must not touch or speak, it
seemed, but one may, quite unembarrassed, comment on a lady's
nipples, Ramón had spoken with entire absence of
self-consciousness.</p>

<p>He was spared further ecstasies by the appearance of a servant
with a tray of wineglasses, from which each horseman helped
himself. At the same time the music swung into a rhythmic lilt.</p>

<p>"Hah!" cried Ramón. "<i>La cachucha!</i>"</p>

<p><i>El tecolero</i> led the girl Conchita to the center and stood
aside. She struck an attitude, body bent back and sideways at the
waist, one toe pointed forward, her arms gracefully above her head.
For an instant she held it, then with a sharp snap of her fingers
started to dance. Ramón was staring with all his eyes.</p>

<p>"Hah!" he cried again, and struck spurs to his horse. Over the
barrier the <i>palomino</i> sailed like a bird plump into the
middle of the dancing floor, where instantly its rider brought it
to a stand. The <i>tecolero</i> leaped hastily to one side. Ramón
was leaning forward in the saddle, the filled wineglass, from which
not a drop had been spilled, outheld. Several of the women uttered
startled cries; the orchestra faltered a moment but immediately
resumed. Conchita flashed upward a smile. It was a pretty sight.
The girl swayed, whirled, advanced, retreated in the coquettish
symbolism of the dance; and Ramón, his reins held high, maneuvered
the horse in perfect complement to its intricacies, while from the
glass in his hand he sprinkled the wine before her as she danced.
His eyes blazed; and from time to time little cries escaped him of
inspiration and encouragement.</p>

<p>"<i>Holá</i>!" he cried. "<i>Va! Echela todos, mi alma!</i>"</p>

<p>Which last, had Andy lived in modern times, he might very
accurately have translated as "shoot the works."</p>

<p>The crash of the music in finale stopped Conchita short in a
back-flung pose. Ramón stooped from his saddle, lifted the girl by
the waist, struck spurs again to his horse, and over the barrier
they flew into the outer darkness pursued by a clamor of
<i>vivas</i>. He deposited her gently on the earth; at once,
laughing, she scurried back to her place in the pavilion.</p>

<p>"Thought you should not touch," observed Andy dryly.</p>

<p>"But thees was of the dance." Ramón was very earnest about it.
"And she return immediately: she do not estay here with me."</p>

<p>Which seemed to Andy only another of the fine distinctions.</p>

<p>"What you think? Is she not beautiful? Do she not do the dance
like the birds?"</p>

<p>Andy assented: but secretly he thought Conchita's performance
far below that of Carmel.</p>

<p>He entered the pavilion with Ramón to pay his respects to his
hostess and to the <i>dueñas</i>, He had to cross its floor exposed
to a battery of bright, curious, and somewhat critical eyes. The
anticipation of this had dismayed him; but now that the time had
come he moved with a composure whose surface, at least, afforded no
chinks of vulnerability. Andy's training in danger had developed in
him one precious faculty, that of rising to emergency by sheer iron
imposition of will. Furthermore, he was possessed of a certain
natural dignity, and a fierce pride that refused to let him down.
The effort he was making set his face into lines of sternness which
suited well his aquiline Indian-like cast of countenance. Andy
kissed Doña Engracia's hand, elaborating the gesture deliberately
into a foofaraw that was his defiance, but which, originating in
self-forgetfulness, resulted in grace. The <i>doncellitas</i>
fluttered and rustled behind their fans, whispering
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"You come belatedly, Don Andres," his hostess chided him.</p>

<p>"I am strange to your customs, so I watched. And I do not know
how to dance your dances."</p>

<p>"But that is foolish when so many would make you welcome. And
since all know that you are strange to our customs, no one must
blame mistakes. We wish to give you pleasure, <i>señor</i>. And as
for the dancing, you must not disappoint the young ladies who will
be joyful to teach you. It is all for pleasure, <i>señor</i>. If
you would please me, you will dance."</p>

<p>"Why, then I will do my best, <i>señora</i>," said Andy, touched
by her earnestness. "But I fear these ladies will find me clumsy as
a bear."</p>

<p>Doña Engracia looked up at him quickly. His grave face did not
alter by the flicker of an eyelash.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said she, "you move more like the puma. So go now
and take your partner. But this is one of our customs, which I
shall tell you, that first of all you should dance with a daughter
of the <i>hacienda</i>."</p>

<p>"That I find a pleasant custom, <i>señora</i>." He bowed and
turned away. Carmel looked down demurely in certain anticipation.
But he passed her by and stood before the child, Faquita.</p>

<p>Carmel flushed angrily and bit her lip. For an instant the fans
ceased their movement. Beneath an exaggerated decorum of demeanor
rippled a concealed surprise and a relished amusement.</p>

<p>"Will you dance with me, <i>señorita</i>?" said Andy with grave
formality.</p>

<p>Faquita glanced timidly toward her mother. That she was present
at all had been a tremendous concession. She was not supposed to
dance, for she was only a child. But Doña Engracia nodded. Faquita
arose with a delight she tried in vain to repress. Her cup of bliss
was full. The dance, probably by kindly instruction, proved to be a
figure dance, somewhat after the order of a quadrille, so that Andy
was able, by observation and by Faquita's eager help, to walk
through it without discredit. He blundered once or twice, turned
the wrong way, but there proved to be no embarrassment in his
mistakes. They set him right so gayly and with such kindly
good-humor that Andy laughed, and then they laughed too. Of a
sudden he was at ease and ready to do anything.</p>

<p>As soon as he had returned Faquita to her seat he was pounced
upon by Ramón.</p>

<p>"It is the third room in the west wing," Andy told him.</p>

<p>"Soul of my soul!" cried Ramón rapturously, though it is
uncertain to whom he referred.</p>

<p>Andy was bending forward to his friend's ear, his hands behind
his back. He felt his hat snatched violently from them, and turned
startled to see Carmel scuttling away down the length of the
enclosure, the hat perched rakishly on the side of her head. Andy
stared after her in dismay and back to Ramón in perplexity.</p>

<p>The latter was delighted.</p>

<p>"Go now, you must catch her. Go on, quick!" Ramón pushed him
with the flat of his hand.</p>

<p>Carmel had turned at the end of the room, her eyes cool and
insolent in challenge. Andy hesitated, then his jaws set.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," he muttered, "if that's your game!" Ordinarily
these affairs were merely a pretty pretense of capture, but Carmel
avoided Andy with what was evidently a determination to embarrass
him. She was quick and lithe, and for two moves evaded her pursuer.
A good many people were laughing, with entire good feeling, it is
true, but laughing just the same. Andy's eyes narrowed. He half
turned away, as though to abandon the chase, then suddenly whirled
and pounced. It was an extraordinary leap, from a stand, quick,
graceful, sudden, like the spring of a panther.</p>

<p>Holding his captive firmly by one arm, he turned to face the
room.</p>

<p>"Now what?" he demanded of Ramón.</p>

<p>"Now we dance," Carmel told him, "if you can!" She moved to
disengage her arm, but Andy tightened his grip. For ten seconds he
stood thus in thought. Ramón was watching him with delighted
interest. The <i>dueñas</i> and the <i>doncellitas</i> and the
older men at the end of the room were watching him too. The
musicians waited, poised for a signal. Doña Engracia leaned forward
to say something, but Ramón stopped her with a gesture of the flat
of his hand. Outside, in the darkness, the horses had ceased their
weaving to and fro.</p>

<p>Suddenly he came to a decision; and at once discovered he was
master of himself. He faced the attentive room with cold
assurance.</p>

<p>"<i>Señoras</i> and <i>señores</i>," said he, "I do not yet know
your dances. I am not yet entirely a <i>californio</i>; I am a
mountain man still. But dance I must, it seems, as this
<i>doncellita</i> makes plain to me. <i>Bueno</i>."</p>

<p>And suddenly he threw back his head and uttered the wild high
cry of the Indian warwhoop; leaped into the air; cracked his heels
together. Several of the women shrieked. The girl Carmel stared at
him round eyed, with parted lips.</p>

<p>"You shall dance with me a dance of mountain men,
<i>señorita</i>," Andy told her in level cold tones. He seized her,
almost roughly, by the waist. The orchestra, without order or
instruction, struck up a lively air. Its leader was one of the
house's bastards, as Ramón said, and was possessed of quick
intuitions.</p>

<p>Andy danced with the girl Carmel. He stamped his feet, he leaped
in the air, he flung his body, he whirled his partner violently
from one arm to the other, around and about. It was not a graceful
performance, for the refinements of grace could not have held
within their narrow containment the wild, barbarous up flinging out
rush of sheer animal exuberance after loneliness which was the
expression of this dance. But it had a contagion. Andy began it in
the coolness of defiance; but as the music quickened and his blood
mounted his present surroundings slipped away. Across the gap of
the vanished years the spark leaped. Taos: Estrellita with her
loose white <i>camisita</i> and her short swirling skirt, and her
smooth bare legs, and the flash of her dark and alluring eyes; and
the feel of her, soft against him; and the gleam of her sharp
little teeth; the murk and heat and odor of the low dim room; the
throb and beat of the guitars; the confusion of tall buckskin clad
figures leaping about&mdash;Howgh&mdash;owgh! Howgh&mdash;owgh!
Andy too was uttering the war cry, swept back in spirit to vanished
days. Faster! Faster! A dam had broken within him. He was riding
high on waters released. Howgh-owgh! Howgh-owgh!</p>

<p>Carmel could not catch her breath; could not have escaped if she
would. Things happened to her so rapidly she could not seize hold
on herself. She was squeezed close, flung to arm's length, whirled
about, at times swung clear off the floor. The man's muscles were
iron; his strength prodigious. And suddenly <i>crash!</i> she was
set down violently on her two feet; and <i>crash</i> the inspired
music ended; and the pavilion seemed to steady as from the
subsiding turbulence of waters. The man was holding her fingers
firmly in his own and bowing composedly to the assembly.</p>

<p>For ten seconds a doubtful and somewhat dismayed silence. Some
of the older women frowned; some of the younger men muttered. No
one knew quite what to think or do, whether to resent or applaud.
Certainly no <i>doncellita</i> had ever, in all the history of
California, taken quite so public a mauling. Was it a scandal, an
insult&mdash;or wasn't it. Carmel herself tipped the scales of
decision. She was shaken, her garments disarranged, her hair had
partly escaped from its golden net. A hint of resentment on her
part would have been sufficient. She disengaged her fingers from
Andy's clasp, spread wide her skirt, dipped low in a sweeping
curtsey, first to the audience, then to Andy, then again to the
audience, as one does who seeks commendation for a concluded
performance. Ramón applauded vigorously. At first uncertainly, then
with growing enthusiasm, the others followed his lead.</p>

<p>Under its cover Andy turned to lead her to her seat.</p>

<p>Abruptly, as the music stopped, he came to himself.</p>

<p>"<i>Gracias, señorita</i>," he said to her with all sincerity,
as they crossed the floor; and both knew that he was not thanking
her merely for her partnership.</p>

<p>She glanced up at him sidewise.</p>

<p>"But you are strong, <i>señor</i>!" she murmured breathlessly.
"I feel as though I had been in a whirlwind."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, <i>señorita</i>. I had not meant to be so rough. I
was carried away."</p>

<p>She gave him fully her eyes.</p>

<p>"No; <i>señor</i>, you must not say that," she said seriously,
"for it is I who must be sorry and who must say to you
<i>gracias</i>."</p>

<p>For a second her eyes held his, then into their depths flickered
a faint mischief: "I think that must be called <i>la danza del
oso</i>, the dance of the bear, is it not, <i>señor</i>?"</p>

<p>She fled the last few steps to her chair.</p>

<p>Andy grinned to himself. So the tame bear had danced for her
after all. But, he felt, honors were even.</p>

<p>And now Carlos Lugo had the inspiration which was to turn this
doubtful situation to a full triumph for Andy. Seizing a guitar
from one of the musicians he struck its chords and in full voice
swung into the barbaric lilt of the mountain man's song, the Song
of Don Largo. One by one others of the young men who had been of
the group under the live oak tree leaped the barrier to gather
close about the singer. The lusty full-blooded chorus swelled to a
shout. People laughed and applauded and beat time. Ramón was
clapping Andy on the shoulder. Everybody was looking at him;
everybody was smiling.</p>

<p>And Andy stood there, a little embarrassed, a little
deprecatory, but very much glad. Ramón was the best of friends;
Carlos Lugo was a fine fellow; these people, for all their foofaraw
of person and manner, were warm hearted and generous. He looked
toward Doña Engracia: she smiled at him. He looked toward Don
Sylvestre: the austere dignity of his face was relaxed. He looked
toward Carmel: her lashes were cast down, so there his eyes
lingered. Ramón was right: she was very beautiful. He had not
really noticed how beautiful she was. Her arms, raised to the
rearrangement of her hair, were soft and round. The attitude drew
smooth the silk of her high buttoned waist. Andy could not avoid
recollection of Ramón's naive comment as to another girl. His dark
face flushed, and he forced his eyes away. They met those of the
child, Faquita, gazing at him solemnly.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>BUT now Don Sylvestre arose to restore order to the confused
occasion. He announced the <i>canastita de flores</i>, the dance
that would terminate the occasion, and all joined hands in a great
circle, singing very sweetly, and at the last word of the song each
embraced the person next him. Then the men escorted the women to
the doors of the <i>casa</i> with the music of guitars, after which
they mounted and rode about for some time singing in the darkness
until their spirits were stilled and they sought rest at last.</p>

<p>The air was tepid and sweet at this season. The younger men
slept in the open beneath the great live oak trees, leaving the
small temporary huts of tules to the elders. The <i>casa</i> had
been turned over entire to the ladies. One by one the lights were
extinguished. The world was stilled, except for the shrill night
insects, and the cry of the little owls, and the faint tinkle of a
guitar, and with it the voice of Ramón beneath the third window in
the left wing.</p>

<p class="poem">"Tu tienes diamantes y perlas,<br>
Tu tienes los ojos divinos,<br>
Tu tiernos divinos los ojos.<br>
Que mas, oh que mas quieres tu?"</p>

<p>It was very sweet. A light flickered for a moment behind the
window's bars, flickered and was extinguished. Shortly after, the
shadowy form of Ramón stole through the darkness. The young man was
ecstatic. That single candle gleam had recompensed him; it was
shining in his heart. Beneath the covering of his broadcloth
<i>poncho</i> Andy stretched his long muscles luxuriously. He had
had a good time. Yes: undoubtedly he had made a star-spangled fool
of himself, but he had had a good time. A bird in the branches
overhead twittered sleepily. He was surprised. Was dawn so near?
Well, he was glad of it, for it meant another day and what it would
bring forth. What it was he did not know; but he was eager for it.
The air of Ramón's song echoed faintly in his memory like a little
breeze. <i>Qué más quieres tú</i>? What more did he want? He did
not know; but something avid was tingling within him. Life was
quivering, a-tiptoe.</p>

<p>"<i>Amigo</i>," Ramón was whispering, "you sleep?"</p>

<p>"No," said Andy.</p>

<p>"Is she not beautiful?" whispered Ramón.</p>

<p>"Very beautiful," agreed Andy again; but it was not Conchita he
was seeing.</p>

<p>And so ended this day which, because of these two young men, was
to be remembered. Long would those who had been present tell of
Ramón's <i>palomino</i> and the <i>cachucha</i>, but especially of
the dance of the mountain man, so that this <i>fiesta</i> was to be
famous as the <i>Fiesta de Don Largo</i>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter VIII. Merienda</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>A CALIFORNIA <i>fiesta</i> of the old days in externals little
resembled the trappers' rendezvous; but in many fundamentals its
spirit was the same. Therefore Andy was more familiarly at ease
than he would have believed possible. Thus, nobody appeared to
sleep much; and when awake, save for recurrent general assemblies,
like the dance of the evening before, each did exactly as he
pleased. Nobody had lain down for sleep much before dawn.
Nevertheless, soon after daybreak a few of the more exuberant were
afoot, and then a-horseback; after which the rest might as well
turn out.</p>

<p>Andy straggled down to the stream with the others, and plunged
his head in the cold water, and was as good as new. But he found
himself incapable of the explosive high spirits of these California
young men. At this hour they seemed egregious, even to the hardened
mountain man, to whom the loss of a night's sleep meant nothing.
They talked and argued and joked and laughed and sang snatches of
song and shouted for horses. The place rapidly turned into a
three-ringed circus. Mounted men scurried in all directions,
skylarking, or competing in impromptu races and games.</p>

<p>For a while Andy stood apart, watching gravely, but with great
interest, and an even greater admiration of the superb
horsemanship. After a time Ramón espied him and dashed up on the
<i>palomino</i>.</p>

<p>"But come!" he cried. "You must not estand thus! This is esport!
<i>Holé!</i>" he shouted. "Juan! saddle <i>el señor</i> his
horse!"</p>

<p>"Not I!" said Andy. "I'll just watch."</p>

<p>Ramón laughed mischievously.</p>

<p>"But it will be hours before the <i>doncellitas</i> they come,"
said he. "Now they sleep!"</p>

<p>His eyes followed Ramón and the <i>palomino</i> as they swooped
toward a group of horsemen who had been conferring. The confused
dashing about was steadying to some sort of game, a good deal like
ring-around-a-rosy, but on horseback. The horses' noses were turned
to a common center. Around the outside of the circle thus formed
one man rode slowly. He carried a peeled rod. Suddenly he thrust
the rod beneath the arm of one of the horsemen, who reined back and
at once pursued him. The first man ducked and dodged, striving to
dart into the vacated place. The other tried to head him off, and
at the same time to get near enough to beat him with the rod before
he could gain that sanctuary. It was a simple game, but it involved
considerable dash and skilled horsemanship and jostling and
plunging. They played this for a few moments, and then someone
appeared dragging a hide at the end of a reata, and the party
shouted acclaim of the new idea, and the game broke up. The hide
was spread flat on the ground. From a distance of about a hundred
yards one by one each dashed toward it full speed. Just before he
reached it he brought his horse to a plunging halt. The idea seemed
to be that this halt should be so accurately timed that the horse's
forehoofs should come to rest on the hide. Apparently it was miss
and out, for he who failed to do so, or who began to check his
horse too soon, or who did not cover the hundred yards at a speed
sufficiently headlong, fell out of the contest. Perhaps exhibition
might be the better word, for before the field was narrowed down to
a winner this game too was abandoned in favor of another. A
<i>peon</i> appeared afoot, dodging through the horsemen, carrying
a chicken under his arm. While the horses danced impatiently about
him, he proceeded methodically and without haste to bury the
unfortunate fowl in the loose earth, until only its head and neck,
shining with grease, were left exposed. Again one by one the
horsemen rode by at full run, swooping from the saddle at just the
right instant to snatch at the chicken. It was obviously no easy
feat. A swerve by the horse of even a few inches; a mistake in
timing of a fraction of a second; even a slight uncertainty of
grasp on the greased feathers were sufficient to cause a miss. The
rider swung gracefully to his seat, his clutching fingers empty,
and circled his mount back to a stand amid the good-natured
laughter of the by-standers. But an astonishing percentage of the
contestants succeeded. The demoralized fowl, snatched from the
earth, was tossed high and squawking through the air to the
outstretched waiting hands of the group of <i>peones</i> who had
gathered to watch the sport&mdash;and to acquire thus the makings
of something unusual and especial in the way of a feast. And
immediately a fresh chicken was produced for the next rider.</p>

<p>At this juncture appeared Don Sylvestre and some of the older
men, also on horseback, saluting the youngsters gravely and
sonorously, and by them greeted respectfully in a briefly imposed
decorum. The <i>hidalgo</i> and his friends sat their horses
sedately, looking on. But Don Sylvestre's appearance gave a new
turn to the proceedings. The chicken idea was abandoned in favor of
the silver coins which Don Sylvestre tossed to earth one by one.
The riders found even more difficulty in picking up the coins; but
when one was retrieved it spun and flashed through the air to the
eager <i>peones</i>. Needless to say the <i>peones</i> liked this
game. They shouted their encouragement lustily. The hullabaloo,
subdued for a moment by the arrival of the older men, rose again to
a clamor. Ramón was everywhere, a gay and vivid figure on his
"silver horse," the <i>palomino</i>. Everybody was good-humored; in
the highest spirits. Once only the occasion clouded. One of the
young men by a mischance not only missed his grasp at the silver
coin, but missed his seat as well and rolled over in the dust. Andy
perceived, with satisfaction, that this was none other than last
evening's master of the dance, <i>el tecolero</i>. The satisfaction
was unworthy of him. He could not have explained it, nor why he
disliked this young man, who was a harmless if somewhat
effeminate-looking individual. Possibly he was too foofaraw. He
laughed, and the <i>tecolero</i> saw him and scowled, though the
others too were laughing. However, he turned his exasperation over
the mishap toward Ramón.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, señor? I did not hear," said Ramón, with sudden
grave formality.</p>

<p>"I say I have not your luck, señor," reiterated the
<i>tecolero</i>, brushing the dust from his garments and remounting
his horse, which a <i>peon</i> had captured.</p>

<p>"My luck?" repeated Ramón. "What mean you by that?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you did not have luck last night, with the wine,
then?"</p>

<p>The reference was clear, for at the dance of the evening before,
Ramón, filled wineglass in hand, had leaped his horse over the
barrier to the center of the floor, and no drop spilled, to finish
the dance mounted, opposite the girl Conchita. Incidentally the
maneuver had jostled aside rather rudely her partner, none other
than this young man, who now, for the first time, gave vent to his
ruffled feelings.</p>

<p>Ramón stared at him a moment. Then he raised his voice.
"Antero!" he called.</p>

<p>One of the <i>peones</i> left the group to stand at his stirrup.
"You will go to Vicenta," Ramón instructed him, "and she will give
you twelve glasses of wine on a tray, and you will bring them to
me."</p>

<p>The man disappeared. They awaited his return in silence; the
young men with the eagerness of a restrained curiosity; the older
men in the profound noncommittal gravity of their years; the
<i>tecolero</i> sullen and uncertain. Only the horses moved
slightly, throwing their heads, stamping their feet.</p>

<p>Antero shortly reappeared with the glasses of wine. Ramón
balanced the tray on the tips of his fingers held high, turned the
<i>palomino</i>, and slowly paced it across the open space before
the <i>casa</i> to where the hill dropped away. He wheeled to face
them, poised motionless as a statue of stone. Then with a shout
Ramón struck home the spurs. The <i>palomino</i> snorted and
leaped. At full speed it raced, until within ten feet or so of the
uneasy young man.</p>

<p>"<i>Holá</i>!" cried Ramón.</p>

<p>Stiff-legged the <i>palomino</i> slid to a halt. Ramón lowered
the upheld tray; held it at arm's length toward the
<i>tecolero</i>; bowed.</p>

<p>"Don Gaston," he said in tones of silky politeness, "a glass of
wine with me to the luck of the Riveras!" The young man hesitated,
but Ramón held him with his eye. He took one of the glasses. Ramón
bowed again and slowly backed the silver horse, step by step,
across the open space to the <i>casa</i>. There he stopped for a
moment, then trotted forward again to distribute the remaining
glasses of wine to the nearest of the bystanders.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>HE RAISED his own glass.</p>

<p>"To the luck of the Riveras!" he repeated, "&mdash;and to the
friend that luck has brought me, Don Andres Bur-r-nett&mdash;Don
Largo." This was well received, for Andy was already popular. "And
now, my friends, you shall see something wonderful, which you have
never seen before, and of which I have not told you, because
without the seeing you would not believe."</p>

<p>He signed with his hand, and again the <i>peon</i> Antero
stepped forward. Evidently he had been already instructed, for he
carried Andy's long rifle, the Boone gun, together with the belt on
which were slung the knife, the powder horn, and the shot pouch of
the regular equipment. Andy took them, smiling good-naturedly. He
was perfectly willing to oblige Ramón. There was no spirit of
vanity in his willingness. Simply he possessed something curious
and strange to these people, who were being friendly to him, and he
was to show it to them as he would a strange and curious coin. He
loaded the Boone gun methodically. His eyes casting about for an
appropriate mark caught a momentary flutter behind one of the high
barred win dows of the <i>casa</i> where, officially, the
<i>doncellitas</i> lay sound asleep. For an instant the hickory
ramrod hesitated in the long sweep of its motion, then drove the
patched ball home. A great illumination came to Andy. Now he
understood a number of things that had been obscure&mdash;the why
of all this early morning high spirits, and this dashing about on
horseback, and all these brave feats of skill, and why they had
been performed so inconsiderately near to the slumbering
<i>casa</i>. He grinned secretly. Conchita had slept in the west
wing, which was on the other side of the house; but Andy had every
confidence that Ramón's feat of horsemanship had not been missed by
the one for whom it was intended. And he himself quite deliberately
modified his own first intention. He had thought to shoot at a
prosaic mark on a live oak tree. Now he had a better idea. Having
completed the charging of the Boone gun, he placed one of the empty
wineglasses at a distance of fifty or sixty yards and proceeded to
blow it into fine bits. This, for Andy, was an easy shot; but to
the Californians it was remarkable; and therefore it was completely
satisfactory as an exhibition. That was what Andy was giving, an
exhibition, so like a good showman he intended attempting nothing
of which he was the least uncertain. Indeed, so shamelessly gone in
foofaraw by now was he that he condescended to what any rifleman
would have recognized as trick work. He thrust a bit of paper over
the muzzle of the piece apparently to obscure the object of his
aim, and in spite of it broke a second wineglass. It looked like
blind work. Actually it was nothing of the sort. Andy kept both
eyes open. The left eye saw the object of his aim around the edge
of the piece of paper; the right eye aligned the sights; the laws
of optics superimposed these two separate images, as any reader of
these lines may prove by trying it himself. But to the spectators
it was a marvel, almost a miracle. Some of the <i>peones</i>
crossed themselves, a trifle fearfully. With a third shot Andy
split a block of wood which he had Antero toss straight up into the
air. Probably he would have been capable of this as a feat of plain
marksmanship; but he took no chances. He stood so that the sun
shone over his left shoulder. Then all he had to do was to point
the rifle in the direct perpendicular line of the billet, holding
his head high, his eyes fixed, not on the sights but on the brown
glossy surface of the barrel. At the exact instant when the shadow,
or rather the reflection, of the falling object darkened that
surface, he pulled trigger, and again the obliging laws of optics
sped the bullet to its mark. He dropped the butt of the long rifle
to earth, and grinned his engaging grin at the acclamations, and
stole a glance out of the corner of his eye toward the high barred
windows of the <i>casa</i>, for Carmel Rivera did not sleep in the
west wing. It was foofaraw, of course, but foofaraw was the order
of the day, wasn't it?</p>

<p>And Andy, the straightforward, direct mountain man, was not in
the least ashamed of himself, and no thought came to him of what
Jack Kelly would say to such a performance.</p>

<p>"The knife, <i>amigo</i>," Ramón pleaded. "For love of me, the
knife! Now you shall see something!" he promised them proudly.</p>

<p>He was urgent, but he did not need to be. Andy was quite
willing. He did things with the knife; even more marvelous things
than he had done with the rifle. Antero, who was a resourceful
<i>peon</i>, brought as a mark a fat ripe squash, which was just
the thing, for the blade cut into it in a most satisfying fashion.
Andy pierced it again and again, lengthening the range between each
cast, until the bright weapon, turning over and over in its
graceful arc, was hurtling through the air a full fifty feet. Then,
shortening the distance, he did the same thing with his left hand.
He cast sidewise across his chest; finally he turned his body and
threw over his shoulder. He was inspired; he could not miss.
Foofaraw, of course, but grand foofaraw, glorious foofaraw. Ramón
was as tickled as a dog with two tails. Andy for the last time
retrieved the knife from the mutilated squash, and wiped the blade,
boyishly pleased, and belatedly just a little diffident.</p>

<p>But now the men were laughing, shouting at him, calling his
attention toward the <i>casa</i>. From the barred window fluttered
a small white hand.</p>

<p>"Go, <i>amigo</i>!" cried Ramón. "You must take!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Andy was filled with embarrassment. He would have liked
well to efface himself. But even Don Sylvestre was smiling at him,
motioning him on. He crossed the open space, stood beneath the
window. From the white hand something fluttered to the ground. He
stooped to pick it up; then stood staring at it, his dark face
flushing.</p>

<p>He felt very flat, very foolish, very much alone exposed to the
ridicule of many eyes. For what he held was no pretty guerdon of
rose or jasmine, but a sprig of common sage, dry and powdery with
the season, a sorry mockery. He did not know what to do.</p>

<p>But Ramón, perceiving his hesitation, was at his side. "No! no!"
he negatived Andy's gesture, "you put him in the hat. You wear him
in the hat. What I tell you? Some of these <i>doncellitas</i> she
send you this as message."</p>

<p>"Message?" repeated Andy.</p>

<p>"But yes. All the flower, they say thing. Do not you know that?
And this one say this: 'I await for you.'"</p>

<p>Andy glanced up at the window. It was blank. The men, his
friends, were smiling at him, and their smiles were kindly.
Evidently they did not consider this a joke, or at least not one
maliciously intended. He thought of the child, Faquita. But that
was no child's hand. His eyes crossed those of Don Gaston, the
<i>tecolero</i>, and stopped with a shock. They glared at him with
a blaze of hatred. Andy thoughtfully removed his <i>sombrero</i>
and thrust the bit of sage beneath its band.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>A NUMBER of <i>vaqueros</i>, each leading three or four saddled
horses, rode to the door of the <i>casa</i> and stopped. Two
decorated <i>carretas</i> followed. The men abandoned their sports
to join the group. After a short wait the door opened and the women
emerged. Slowly and with much chatter and laughter the cavalcade
took form. Most of the young women, and some of the elder, rode
their own horses, sitting their saddles with accustomed grace,
their small high-arched Spanish feet resting daintily in the looped
broad ribbons that served in lieu of stirrups. Beneath the wide
straw hats the sun cloths stirred in the breeze, alternately
obscuring and revealing round cheeks, red lips, soft or sparkling
eyes; an effective substitute for the fan. A few of the
<i>doncellitas</i>, wearing their <i>caballero's</i> hats and
carrying their own over the left arm, rode a man's horse, which its
owner managed from his place behind the saddle; but this privilege,
Andy learned, was reserved for the suitor accepted, or at least
markedly favored. Several offered, and were refused, and fell back
with an air of resignation; though, Andy thought, some of the
refusals looked rather strategic than final. Ramón, holding
Conchita thus on the <i>palomino</i>, glanced triumphantly at his
friend. Andy saw his arm tighten, and the girl yield her soft body
ever so slightly to the pressure; and he could not help wondering
how that would feel, and his eye involuntarily wandered, seeking
Carmel, and he fetched himself up short, slightly scandalized; but
at once deliberately and recklessly turned back to entertain the
thought.</p>

<p>Remembering in time Ramón's explanation of its value as a favor,
he did not quite dare to invite Carmel to his saddle; but he did
spur forward to her side. And as he was the guest of the house, as
also the ostensible reason for all this merrymaking, the half dozen
or more young men about her fell back, leaving him a clear
field.</p>

<p>But just before the party set forth Ramón called him aside for a
moment.</p>

<p>"Here," said he hastily in Spanish, out of courtesy to Conchita.
"You must make reply. Yes, it must be: it is courteous. Place it
also in the hat."</p>

<p>He thrust upon Andy a sprig of jasmine. Andy took it but looked
doubtfully at his friend.</p>

<p>"What does it say?" he wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Ask the <i>doncellita</i>," Ramón laughed.</p>

<p>Andy turned in appeal to Conchita, but she shook her pretty
head, then nodded encouragingly.</p>

<p>"I must not tell you that, <i>señor</i>," she smiled. Her eyes
met his. Andy searched them; found in them reassurance. He thrust
the jasmine in his hatband.</p>

<p>For a fleeting instant Carmel's eye rested on the decoration;
but her face was inscrutable. Don Sylvestre gave the signal by
turning his horse. The procession started. Down the slope; across
the flat where the meadowlarks sang and the wild cattle stared;
toward the spreading white oaks and the sycamores of the bottomland
moved the cavalcade at decorous pace, colorful as a figured
tapestry. The horses arched their necks and stepped daintily in a
proud rectitude of restraint. The <i>carretas</i>, blooming like
flower baskets with the brilliant colors of the women's garments,
creaked soberly in the rear. A number of unattached young men
surrounded it solicitously. Still others rode slowly off the
flanks, playing guitars. Several of them, from time to time, edged
alongside Andy and Carmel. They did not look toward the couple,
and, after a few seconds, reined back or spurred ahead. The guest
of the <i>fiesta</i> must of courtesy have his clear field with
<i>la favorita</i>, even against the desires of the many.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that Andy's use of this consideration fell
short of the masterly. He did not know what to do with it. Carmel
rode composedly aloof, her eyes fixed on distant invisible things.
The situation was like a prickly pear. Andy had no small talk. His
few proffers of politeness sounded to him flat instantly they had
been voiced. He did not know that this was because the girl made
them so by deliberately permitting them to fall to the ground.
After a try or two Andy desisted. They rode in silence. But the
effect on the mountain man was not completely what Carmel may have
intended. For a little while only he writhed appropriately wormish;
for a little while more he flushed with a desirable anger. Then he
laughed aloud.</p>

<p>There had suddenly come to him a simple recollection, that
Carmel would not have understood, but a recollection so vivid that
it had for the moment almost the quality of a vision. It carried
him back a dozen years, to a leafy Pennsylvania woodland, and
opposite him the quaint bizarre figure of Joe Crane seated on a log
and holding forth to the open-mouthed youngster which was himself.
He could hear the words, as though spoken in his ears. "I might
well, thinks you, git me the foofaraw of proper dress; but, thinks
I, 'Joe Crane, never in all your life have you acted like anybody
but yourself. Do not make yourself out a fool by trying to ape
other folks now. Joe Crane you have always been, and Joe Crane you
still remain. Go ahead, Joe Crane!'" Andy chuckled again. "Andy
Burnett you still remain. Go ahead, Andy Burnett!" said he to
himself. He looked up into space. "Thanks, Joe," said he aloud.</p>

<p>"You laugh? Why do you laugh, <i>señor</i>?" The girl stared at
him.</p>

<p>"Why," said Andy, "I laugh at you and me." He drawled the words
in a fashion that would have warned her, had she known the
breed.</p>

<p>"You find us amusing, <i>señor</i>?" she demanded so haughtily
that Andy leaned forward in the saddle to look at her. In spite of
herself she stared for a breath-taking moment into steady gray eyes
that were far from dumb but rather filled with a direct primitive
force that swept her from all her practised moorings of defense.
For ten seconds they held her. Then a film of surface lights
obscured their depths. Carmel was shaken. She tried to laugh
naturally. Andy had made no reply to her question, which both had
forgotten. He seemed to come to a decision. From his hatband he
snatched the bit of sage and the sprig of jasmine and tossed them
aside.</p>

<p>"Foofaraw." said he.</p>

<p>"<i>Señor</i>?" gasped Carmel.</p>

<p>"Foofaraw," repeated Andy. "That is your game, Now we will play
mine."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Carmel faintly.</p>

<p>"You will," said Andy.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>THEY arrived at the stream bottom and dismounted. Here, it was
disclosed, were a number of <i>peones</i> and servants of the
<i>casa</i>, who had been on the spot since early morning, and who
had dug a pit, and in it roasted an ox, and had otherwise disposed
preparations for an elaborate feast beneath the trees. Andy
immediately sought out Ramón.</p>

<p>"Look here, Ramón," he demanded without preliminary, "what did
that flower you gave me mean?"</p>

<p>Ramón glanced curiously at his friend's face, then answered
directly and without hesitation:</p>

<p>"She mean, 'I do not wish you to become a nun.'"</p>

<p>"That's all right: I wouldn't wish anybody to become a nun. Now
tell me: it was your sister who threw me that piece of sage, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"That is for you to find out, is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Well, I am finding out. It was, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," acknowleded Ramón, after a moment.</p>

<p>"Are these things meant seriously by your women, or are they
supposed to be a joke? I want to know."</p>

<p>"Who knows what the <i>doncellita</i> mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, she'd better mean it, with me," returned Andy
brusquely.</p>

<p>"Why are you thus angry, <i>amigo</i>? Has Carmel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not angry," Andy interrupted. "I just want to know."</p>

<p>"Yes?" Ramón was thoughtful. "But what ails you,
<i>valedor</i>?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to marry your sister," said Andy bluntly, "You do not
approve?" he demanded at Ramón's astonished face.</p>

<p>"Approve? Approve? But, heart of my heart, I am delight!" Ramón
hastened, "There could be nothing I more desire. But you take from
me my breath! There are so many thing&mdash;Carmel, does she love
you?"</p>

<p>"If she does not, she'd better let me alone." Then for a moment
Andy's white blaze wavered. "Oh, Ramón!" he cried, "don't you
think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, yes," Ramón hastened. "I think. Didn't I tell you, at the
first, and you do not believe, that she like you much? Yes, yes, I
think. But there are so many, <i>amigo</i>; you do not know!
Carmel, she is <i>la favorita</i>. All these young fellow,
they&mdash;" He broke off with a chuckle. The expression of Andy's
face had wiped out all young California.</p>

<p>"There is Cortilla&mdash;those Mexican&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll attend to them," said Andy.</p>

<p>"And there is Papá and Mamá. First of all you must ask Papá and
Mamá. I think they like you much. But perhaps Papá he say, 'Where
are your land, your cattle, how make you <i>la casa</i> for my
daughter?'"</p>

<p>Andy was checked for a moment, but only for a moment.</p>

<p>He spread his great hands, contemplating them.</p>

<p>"I can keep my woman," said he briefly. His eye was somber. Then
suddenly he reared his head, visibly shaking off the swarm of
practical considerations and difficulties his friend's words had
evoked. Foofaraw, all of them. He was through with foofaraw.</p>

<p>"I'm going to marry your sister," he repeated decisively, and
turned on his heel.</p>

<p>Ramón looked after him for a moment. Then he chuckled
delightedly and sought out his sister.</p>

<p>"Carmelita," said he, "it just came to me a saying of our
Vicenta."</p>

<p>"What is that, hermano?"</p>

<p>"'He who runs with wolves must learn to howl,'" said Ramón.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>LACKING the key of understanding that fitted Andy Burnett's
type, Carmel must have been baffled and puzzled by the total lack
of developments after so exciting a beginning. To be sure, the
young man, throughout the progress of the <i>merienda</i>, sought
her company, so that he was recognized as her <i>caballero</i> for
the day. But that was all. He did not seem to understand that
something was expected of him; he did not seem to appreciate the
rare opportunity offered by the <i>fiesta</i>, and that once the
<i>fiesta</i> was over all communication must return to the
presence of the <i>dueña</i>. That, in the mind of Carmel, and of
all others of her age, was what <i>fiestas</i> were for. An
enterprising lover never failed to seize these fleeting moments;
for they were too few and much too fleeting. Andy appeared ignorant
of this fact; and, what was worse, he was either oblivious to or
ignored Carmel's leads. He could not, or would not, play the game.
Carmel could not make up her mind; and so, possibly, Andy's cause
with her was as much helped as though his tactics had been
deliberate. Ramón, a connoisseur of wooing, thought them
deliberate. He approved of keeping them guessing, and admired
Andy's resolution the more in that he himself had in the case of
Conchita signally failed to live up to his own ideas, and had in
consequence been led a lively dance.</p>

<p>But they were not deliberate: they were a by-product of the
mountain man's temperament and training. One puzzled out a trail
bit by bit; one met each day separately face to face and did not
live tomorrow until it came; when one tackled a job one
disentangled all its elements and arranged them in due order, and
took the first one first, and stayed with it until it was done, and
then&mdash;and not until then&mdash;went on to the second. That was
the way he had managed to survive.</p>

<p>So now. He loved Carmel: he must have her. This was a fact, that
had confronted him quietly, as one comes around a corner of the rim
rock upon something that has been there all the time. It was as
though he moved into a new country, where he belonged; and in it
waited strange exciting things that at odd moments stabbed through
him, disturbing his accustomed calm possession of mind. It had been
so when he crossed the Sierra into the Lovely Land. And in this
land too was the same feeling of inevitability, of certainty. He
recognized the feeling. In a few other occasions of life he had
experienced it, but never with such conviction.</p>

<p>But here he swung into the habit of his training. He bent his
head to the trail, turning his mind inward to the practical steps
of the way. He must act at once. The necessities arranged
themselves in an ordered and logical program of necessity, one
dependent on the other. He must arrange matters so he would be
permitted to stay in California: he must arrange matters so he
could take care of Carmel with honor and comfort: he must obtain,
if possible, Don Sylvestre's approval. Then he must win the girl.
That was the trail.</p>

<p>It must not be understood that all this presented itself to Andy
as above set down. He was not analytical; and certainly not as
cold-blooded as all that. The iron of his logic was instinctive,
subconscious. That was the way his nature worked, not his mind.</p>

<p>The party disposed itself on the grassy bank of the stream, and
the men sought the ox pits and the hampers, to fill plates with the
<i>carne asada</i> and the other food that had been prepared. While
they were thus occupied the women culled flowers and made quaint
tight miniature nosegays. Each young man offered himself&mdash;and
the food&mdash;before the lady of his choice, who signified her
acceptance of his company by presenting to him the nosegay, which
he thrust into his hatband, where it must remain until it had
withered and fallen to pieces. Andy, returning belatedly from his
foraging, found a half dozen standing before Carmel, awaiting her
pleasure. She sat, her skirts spread wide, toying with the little
bouquet, parrying vivaciously the gallant and rather elaborate
speeches of the young <i>caballeros</i>. She delayed her decision,
enjoying her little triumph as <i>la favorita</i> of many suitors,
perhaps a corner of her eye wandering in search of the tall figure
of the young frontiersman. Whether or not she intended favoring or
snubbing him perhaps she herself did not as yet know: but she was
given no choice. Before she realized what he was about Andy had in
the most matter-of-fact manner disengaged the nosegay from her
fingers, had inserted it beneath the band of his <i>sombrero</i>,
and had stretched his long body at her side, grinning up at her
confidently.</p>

<p>Completely surprised, she stared at him unbelieving.</p>

<p>The young men looked toward one another, scandalized at this
breach of convention, uncertain whether they should resent it. But
they made no comment. This was the guest of the house, an
<i>extranjero</i>, probably ignorant of the etiquette of occasions.
After all, it was Carmel who must decide. And she, still staring at
Andy's resolute face, hesitated, for she was confronted by a
situation so strange to her she could not gauge its consequences.
She could not guess that this strong young savage intended no
discourtesy, had acted from no spirit of aggression, but had merely
cut across the foofaraw; was only vaguely aware of the young men
waiting.</p>

<p>The latter withdrew, gracefully enough, all but one.</p>

<p>This was Don Gaston, el <i>tecolero</i>. Andy looked up to meet
his hostile eyes. His hackles rose, and he leaned forward, his
muscles stiffening. The Californian seemed to him about to leap at
his throat. But the young man retained control of himself.</p>

<p>"Doña Carmel has perhaps need of my help?" he asked softly.</p>

<p>Carmel shook her head faintly; and after a moment of glowering
hesitation Gaston turned away. But he did not, like the others,
seek out a lady of second choice. Down through the bottom he
stalked to where stood the horses waiting in charge of one of the
<i>vaqueros</i>. He spoke to the man who, after a moment, led
forward one of the animals. The <i>tecolero</i> leaped to the
saddle, struck home his spurs, and dashed away.</p>

<p>Carmel had come to her decision through no favor to Andy. Had
one of the Californians committed this&mdash;yes, this outrage, she
would have known well enough what to do. But the unknown frightened
her. She had not yet learned to howl with the wolves. She was
angry, of course; she was disturbed; but secretly she was thrilled.
She turned to the young man at her side.</p>

<p>But the thrill died away. Andy was monosyllabic. She could make
nothing of him. As a matter of fact, he was waiting at quite a
distant point of time for the present to catch up to him.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>CONCHITA, probably lest Ramón become too elated, elected to
return to the <i>casa</i> in one of the ox-carts. The young
Californian rode home with his friend. He had, of course, heard of
the lunch-time episode and was astounded to find that Andy had
totally missed its significance. To them came Panchito with news.
Ramón listened to him apart and shook his head.</p>

<p>"I like not that!" He turned to Andy. "Panchito tell me this
Gaston have been seen riding fast on the road to Monterey."</p>

<p>"Well," said Andy, "let him go. I don't like him."</p>

<p>"No, and he no like you. That is it," returned Ramón. "You know
what I think? No, I do not think; it is esure. He go to tell this
Cortilla you are here." Ramón struck his forehead dramatically.
"See!" he lamented. "Here on this <i>hacienda</i>, now, is many
peoples&mdash;peoples who belong to the <i>hacienda</i>, Riveras
and <i>mozos</i> and <i>vaqueros</i> and many, even <i>los
Indios</i>: and besides them other peoples from all about, and not
one of them would tell that you are here. Not one! Except this
Gaston. He is pig of the world! He do not like you; he do not like
me; always he do not like me! That I know, but I do not think that
ever, even he, would be traitor. I am ashame'!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has just gone home mad," suggested Andy.</p>

<p>"Then why he ride toward Monterey? He come from San Juan."</p>

<p>"What do we do about it?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"That we must ask my papá."</p>

<p>"Well," said Andy reasonably, "that is what we were going to do,
isn't it? You said yourself that I could not stay here long without
discovery."</p>

<p>"But <i>mañana</i>, <i>mañana</i>-!" cried Ramón, "not so quick;
<i>mañana</i>-! Now we do something <i>pronto</i>, right away,
quick! It espoil la <i>fiesta</i>." He peered into his friend's
face. "You are not sorry? You do not care? Perhaps you must go
away. You like leave Carmel?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am sorry," said Andy stoutly; but deep in his heart
he was not sorry. If the thing must be faced, he welcomed the
coming to grips. Once more he was feeling beneath his feet the
solid ground of action.</p>

<p>But on arrival at the <i>casa</i> the opportunity for consulting
Don Sylvestre, must be, for the moment, postponed. Here awaited
them an arrival of the day whose business attracted the eager and
instant attention of all. This was a short pale man dressed in
sober dark garments and accompanied by a lazy, insolent-looking
fellow in Californian costume. The latter announced himself present
as interpreter. Don Sylvestre looked him over and waved him
aside.</p>

<p>"My son Ramón will say what is needed." He stared the man down
haughtily until the latter withdrew. "Papá sure do not like the
Mexican," Ramón chuckled to Andy as he moved forward. "What would
you have me to say, <i>señor</i>?" he asked the little man.</p>

<p>It developed that the stranger had been sent by the captain of a
ship recently from Boston. What ship? The <i>Petrel</i>. Ah, yes,
Don Sylvestre nodded, the good Capitan Barclay. The stranger
introduced himself, Ethan Phelps, supercargo, at your service. Don
Sylvestre was honored, but what of the <i>Señor</i> Todd who was
supercargo, and also well known to the Don? Todd was out&mdash;too
slack, Phelps added gratuitously. The owners had put him in because
he was up to snuff and wouldn't have any monkey business. The
phrases puzzled Ramón, who turned to Andy for explanation.</p>

<p>"You speak English, too?" asked Phelps.</p>

<p>"A little," said Andy.</p>

<p>"That I regret," said Don Sylvestre with dignity. "Señor Todd is
a man who possesses my esteem. Ask this one to state his
errand."</p>

<p>Captain Barclay, newly entered, had, it seemed, heard of the
<i>fiesta</i>. It had occurred to him as a good idea to take
advantage of the gathering of so many scattered families. The
supercargo had brought with him a <i>carreta</i> of goods for sale.
This was a distinct departure from custom, for ordinarily all
trading was done aboard ship, and people traveled many miles to
market. Don Sylvestre was pleased at the good captain's
thoughtfulness, which he appreciated as a mark of the friendship
that had long existed between them. As a matter of fact, the idea
was not Barclay's but Phelps'; and was put into execution only to
anticipate a rival ship, with which the <i>Petrel</i> had raced all
the way to the Horn and which must soon arrive.</p>

<p>The short interview had taken place before the <i>casa</i> in
the presence of the picnickers, who had not yet dispersed. And when
the feminine portion understood what was forward, and that Don
Sylvestre was purposing a postponement of the market until
tomorrow, they protested. Tomorrow was too long to wait for Santa
Claus. The day was yet young. So finally the <i>carreta</i> was
unloaded and the bundles carried into the patio and there unpacked.
Captain Barclay, or perhaps his supercargo, had chosen from the
great variety in the <i>Petrel's</i> hold the lighter and more
compact articles of luxury that could be the most readily
transported and that would most appeal to the holiday spirit of the
<i>fiesta</i>. There were silks, laces, stockings, red shoes, fine
linens, ornamental combs, bracelets and bangles, satins, velvets,
earrings, necklaces, hand mirrors with carved frames, small
watches, a wealth of feminine foofaraw. These constituted the bulk
of the consignment. For the men there was little; and of the more
solid and bulky articles of general use none at all. These more
serious purchases would be obtained in the regular way of commerce;
or, Phelps explained, by order, if the purchaser knew exactly what
he wanted.</p>

<p>Don Sylvestre nodded abstractedly to this. He was considering an
idea of his own. Immediately the bundles had been opened and their
contents spread out, the women had pounced upon them, and already
the smaller objects were passing from hand to hand. No one waited
to be served. They helped themselves. The supercargo was
distracted. He darted from one group to another, trying in vain to
impose some order; to regain possession of his valuables, at the
very least to ascertain the names and the responsibility of those
who made off with them. This was the more difficult in that he knew
nothing of the language, his interpreter had disappeared, and
nobody paid more than momentary attention to his incomprehensible
excitement.</p>

<p>But now Don Sylvestre put his idea into execution. "Señoras!
Señoritas!" he called again and again, until the chattering died to
silence.</p>

<p>Don Sylvestre had bought the entire consignment, it seemed.
Would each lady accept her choice of it as souvenir of the
<i>fiesta</i>? And if anyone fancied that which was already chosen,
be added negligently, let her make the fact known, and duplicates
would be procured as fast as courier could make the journey to the
ship. Which arrangement not only was received enthusiastically by
the guests of the <i>hacienda</i>, but undoubtedly saved the sanity
of Phelps, the supercargo from Boston.</p>

<p>However, that young man's bewilderments were not yet finished.
The small matter of payment? Ah, yes, Don Sylvestre nodded when
Ramón translated this: what would be the amount? Phelps,
scandalized to the depths of his soul at this casual indifference,
named a sum.</p>

<p>"Very well," Don Sylvestre assented, "tell him we shall have
<i>matanza</i> by and by, and when next his ship comes to Monterey
I shall send to him the hides."</p>

<p>Phelps was astonished at this instant and careless acceptance of
the first price. He repressed a smile of satisfaction, for, in
expectation of bargaining, he had named a sum in excess of what he
was prepared to accept.</p>

<p>"Ask him when he wishes to sign the papers," he told Ramón.</p>

<p>"What papers are those?" Don Sylvestre wanted to know.</p>

<p>The papers recording the transaction.</p>

<p>"But I shall not forget," protested the <i>hacendado</i>. It was
only with the greatest difficulty that he was made to understand
what Phelps was driving at: that it was not merely a memorandum
against forgetfulness, but a guarantee of payment.</p>

<p>"I cannot return to my master without a guarantee!" protested
Phelps in despair.</p>

<p>At last Don Sylvestre comprehended. He drew himself to his full
height, and from his beard plucked a single hair, which he handed
to the bewildered supercargo.</p>

<p>"Take this to your master," said he grandly. "Tell him it is a
hair from the beard of Don Sylvestre Rivera. It will be to him a
sufficient guarantee."</p>

<p>He and Ramón turned on their heels and stalked away.</p>

<p>Andy took pity on the little man's honest confusion.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he assured him.</p>

<p>"But my owners&mdash;Captain Barclay&mdash;" gasped Phelps:</p>

<p>"I reckon the Captain will understand, if he's traded on this
coast before. This your first trip, eh?"</p>

<p>"But it wasn't business-like!"</p>

<p>"Maybe not. I don't know business. But it's California; I
reckon. You'll get paid."</p>

<p>"I hope so." Phelps was only partly reassured. "But you aren't
Spanish, are you?" he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"No: I'm American like yourself."</p>

<p>"Haven't I heard of you? Aren't you the one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I reckon so," Andy laughed.</p>

<p>"Look here," the little supercargo was very serious, "what you
doing here? Don't you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Andy.</p>

<p>"Well, what you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"That I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, if I was you I'd pull out, and pull out quick."</p>

<p>Andy shook his head.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Reasons of my own."</p>

<p>"Well, you know your business. But look here, if the time ever
comes&mdash;there's the <i>Petrel</i>. If you can get aboard her.
Of course, I'm only supercargo; but Captain Barclay no more than me
wouldn't want to see an American&mdash;Remember!"</p>

<p>"I'll remember, and thank you," said Andy. This wasn't a bad
sort of little man, after all. Simply he did not yet understand
foofaraw. Well, Andy had not understood foofaraw at first either.
He must tell him something about foofaraw.</p>

<p>Ramón was at his elbow.</p>

<p>"I have told my papá we must talk to him, now," he said in
Spanish. "He awaits us in the small room."</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>BUT Don Sylvestre failed for the moment to justify Ramón's
confidence in Papá as a fixer. Indeed, he proved to consider the
situation even more seriously than had the younger man. To be sure,
a Mexican could be bribed to accept almost any insult, Don
Sylvestre agreed contemptuously, but hardly a public spanking. And
when the Mexican has the official power&mdash;Don Sylvestre
shrugged. Nor was his own protection sufficient for more than
temporary asylum. Even inimical officialdom would hesitate to
molest anyone while actually a guest of the Riveras. But formal
demands would be made which could not be avoided.</p>

<p>All this the young man already knew, too well. Nor did Don
Sylvestre contribute anything new in the way of plan. Andy could
return to the mountains and his old life: the way was still open.
If he remained in the country it must be under the shadow of a risk
that would sooner or later close in on him.</p>

<p>So far Don Sylvestre had spoken impersonally, with grave
politeness. Now, having stated the case, he permitted himself a
warmth of manner as he laid his hand on Andy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"It desolates my heart that thus matters stand, <i>hijo
mío</i>," he said familiarly, "for I have watched your bearing,
which is of the true <i>hidalgo</i>, so that I would happier
circumstances permitted Ramón such a brother as yourself. And the
<i>casa</i>," he added with the bow of formal politeness, but
nevertheless with entire sincerity, "would be honored to welcome
such a son."</p>

<p>Obviously both he&mdash;and, reluctantly, Ramón&mdash;considered
that the subject had been covered. But Andy was not quite
satisfied. This new governor, Figueroa, sent from Mexico, had he
arrived? What was he like? Was it certain he would back Cortilla in
face of a strong appeal?</p>

<p>Yes, he had reached Monterey in January. Don Sylvestre did not
know much about him, except that he was in bad health, due it was
said to the hardships of military campaigns. It had not been worth
while to learn anything about him: nobody on a <i>hacienda</i>
cared what governors did. Nobody knew anything this one had done;
except that he had declared a general amnesty to those who had
taken part in the late revolutions. Undoubtedly he would back
Cortilla. These Mexicans stuck together.</p>

<p>"Could I get a hearing from him if I should go to Monterey?"
Andy wished to know.</p>

<p>That seemed to Don Sylvestre doubtful. More likely he would be
arrested out of hand and railroaded to San Blas through
subordinates. Besides, what could Andy proffer at a hearing? He
could not deny that he had spanked the excellent Cortilla.</p>

<p>No, he could not deny it, but it had been done with cause, Andy
insisted. The officer had been massacring innocent people, for
which act he should in justice be officially reprimanded as well as
unofficially spanked.</p>

<p>The victims were nothing but Indians, wild ones, gentiles. And
Cortilla was on campaign.</p>

<p>Andy hesitated, baffled. Obviously the innocence of his victims
registered nothing with his hearers; and if this consideration
carried no weight with friends, how much less with enemies? He
tried a new tack.</p>

<p>"But if your governor is a military man, as you say, then he
must see that this lieutenant has acted very badly, for he has
needlessly aroused a new hostility among savages who would have
been friendly except for his action. I know they were friendly, for
I stayed among them." Andy told of his experience in detail; and as
he went on managed to build up a specious and flimsy plausibility.
Ramón brightened; but Don Sylvestre listened doubtfully.</p>

<p>"That is well argued, <i>hijo mío</i>," said he when Andy had
concluded, "but its effect must depend entirely on one thing."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"The disposition of Figueroa. If by some chance this Cortilla
should not be favored by him, then what you say he might accept as
an excuse. But if, as is more than probable, Cortilla is in his
favor, then he will not listen at all."</p>

<p>"But there is a chance?"</p>

<p>"Of the very slightest."</p>

<p>But Ramón was not so sure the chance was of the slightest. This
Cortilla was the pig of the world. He was overweening, puffed up in
his own conceit. Any sane governor ought to be delighted at an
excuse to get rid of such a fellow. And, he reminded his father
with growing eagerness, had he forgotten one other thing that
Figueroa had already done&mdash;the appointment of Guadalupe
Vallejo, a Californian, to command of the military forces? Was not
that a sufficient indication? Ramón's enthusiasm kindled. It became
a certainty. On to Monterey!</p>

<p>Don Sylvestre brushed Ramón's enthusiasm aside. "I cannot
deceive you, <i>señor</i>, much as I would like to share my son's
confidence. He sees things always as he would like them. If you go
to Monterey, my opinion is that you will be placed in prison until
a ship sails for San Blas; and then you will be heard of no
more."</p>

<p>"But there is a chance?" Andy protested.</p>

<p>"Of the slightest," Don Sylvestre repeated, "but yes; a
chance."</p>

<p>"Then I shall go to Monterey," said Andy.</p>

<p>Don Sylvestre looked at Andy thoughtfully. He did not again
present the obvious alternative, nor attempt to combat the
decision.</p>

<p>"You are a very brave man," he said finally. "That I like. You
are also, I think, somewhat foolish. But that," he added
unexpectedly, "I like also. This much I can do: I shall journey
with you to Monterey. You shall speak yourself to the governor.
Until that is accomplished no one shall molest you. So much
Sylvestre Rivera can promise. But beyond that nothing."</p>

<p>"I will risk it," said Andy. "When shall we go?"</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p>HE LEFT father and son together in discussion of details.</p>

<p>He closed the door behind him. Carmel stood before him.</p>

<p>"I listened," she whispered hastily. "I could not but listen. I
must know. I am frightened for you. Why do you do this thing?"</p>

<p>Andy placed his two hands on her shoulders. "For you," he said
simply.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment devouring her with his eyes.</p>

<p>"For you," he repeated. "And, by God, there aren't Mexicans
enough in Mexico to stop me!"</p>

<p>He crushed her to his breast. She clung to him desperately for a
moment; then at Ramón's approaching step she tore herself free and
vanished. Andy's program was obviously getting to be
hind-end-to.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter IX. Monterey</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>SOMEHOW Andy did not associate the idea of prompt action with
his California friends. But now that it had been definitely decided
to visit Monterey, there was no suggestion of <i>mañana</i>. Ramón
and his father had settled it between them.</p>

<p>"You and Papá will go at once," Ramón told his friend. "I must
stay here until our guests of the <i>fiesta</i> shall wish to go
home. It is not courteous that both Papá and myself, who am the
eldest son, shall go away now. But I shall follow so soon as I
can."</p>

<p>"You mean right now?-tonight?"</p>

<p>"But yes: we have talk it, Papá and I. It is but six leagues to
Monterey, and the moon he rise pretty quick. You get in there by
midnight, maybe, and you go to the home of Alvarado, who is good
man and pariente to us; and no one shall know you have come until
it is fix for you to see this governor. And here is 'nother thing:
these Gaston ride for to tell Cortilla you are here. He get to
Monterey these afternoon. Now Cortilla come here quick as he can to
get you. Maybe he come tonight. But in the morning sure thing. If
he find you here, that's bad. But if you can get first to Figueroa
and he is not come back yet, that is good. So you ride
<i>pronto</i>, so soon as you eat a little."</p>

<p>Andy saw the close-reasoned common sense of this, but he was
still a little overcome at the thought of Don Sylvestre, an elderly
man, a grandee, called upon to do six leagues, horseback on top of
a long day which had been preceded by a very short night after the
dance of the evening before.</p>

<p>"My papá!" Ramón scoffed. "I bet you he ride you off
your&mdash;what you call him?&mdash;off your tail right now!"</p>

<p>The three ate a light, hastily served meal in Don Sylvestre's
small office, which was the only room in the <i>casa</i> not given
over to the women. It was agreed their departure was to be kept as
secret as possible. They slipped quietly across the patio. Panchito
and two other <i>vaqueros</i> awaited them with saddled horses and
a spare apiece. There was no baggage: that could follow if needed.
Ramón was unwontedly grave. At the last moment he expressed his
thought.</p>

<p>"I do not think so; but it just might be that I see you no more,
<i>valedor</i>," said he.</p>

<p>Andy laid both hands on his friend's shoulders.</p>

<p>"I shall see you again," said he. "I was never surer of anything
in my life. You shall see."</p>

<p>"You have the plan?" Ramón brightened.</p>

<p>But Andy had no plan. And he could not in two words have made
Ramón understand the truth; that somewhere within him existed, had
always existed, an area of certainty which occasionally opened for
his comfort at times of his greatest stress. And when once he had
set foot within that area he was serenely sure, no matter how
untoward circumstance might be. The experience was rare, it was
capricious. It might be described as a state of psychic attunement
with reality; or it might be called a hunch. But it was
authentic.</p>

<p>He was in the saddle. Panchito was handing to him the Boone gun,
the long rifle, and its equipment.</p>

<p>"I think perhaps you like this, <i>señor</i>," murmured the
<i>vaquero</i>.</p>

<p>"Good man, Panchito," said Andy who, indeed, was on the point of
demanding the weapon, though he was perfectly aware that arms could
help him little in this affair. For once Ramón had no objections to
offer. He touched Andy's knee. Andy bent to him.</p>

<p>"<i>Adiós, valedor</i>," murmured Ramón. "Be of cheer. And I
shall say to her for you what you would have me say for
farewell."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Andy gruffly. He crushed Ramón's hand in his
strong fingers.</p>

<p>They struck spurs to their horses and dashed away after the
headlong manner of California travel. As they topped the gentle
rise Andy looked back. The pavilion was alight, and outside it
dimly he could make out the lighted figures of the young men
weaving to and fro. The dance had begun.</p>

<p>At full speed they swept on through the soft night. The moon was
just rising, and the shadows were velvet dark.</p>

<p>Don Sylvestre rode ahead, an erect fine figure, the
<i>vaqueros</i> and the loose horses thundered along behind. No
word was spoken. Andy's spirit was serene. His mind did not even
consider the complications and the very real dangers of what lay
before him. Those things would present themselves in due time. He
savored the present; and it was sweet. In spite of the rapid
movement; he seemed to himself suspended in serenity. Somehow the
Boone gun beneath his hand had reestablished his contact with a
feeling he had left behind him beyond the mountains, a feeling of
larger destinies with which it linked him. They swelled within him.
Again he was moving forward with their current. He did not know
what they were or whither they tended; he did not strive to know.
Merely he felt them, and in some mystic fashion sensed his oneness
with them, so that as long as they endured he must endure. A
palpable power seemed to flow from the old Boone gun, through his
arm, to uplift his heart.</p>

<p>Thrice the journey checked. The first time was merely for a
change of horses. The second halt was called by Panchito, who
spurred forward to say something to Don Sylvestre. The two, with
Andy, left the <i>remuda</i> and trotted at a hand pace several
hundred yards to the left, to draw rein on the rounded summit of a
low hill. From the crest they overlooked a narrow winding valley,
dotted with live oaks, black and silver under the moon, and the
thread of a well traveled road.</p>

<p>"El camino real&mdash;the road to Monterey," said Don Sylvestre
in a low voice. For the first time Andy realized that their journey
had taken them over byways. And above the small sounds of jingling
and stamping of their own animals, he became aware of the measured
beat of other horses below.</p>

<p>"You have good ears, Panchito," Don Sylvestre complimented the
<i>vaquero</i>.</p>

<p>After a few moments a compact cavalcade came into view and
passed beneath them, small with distance.</p>

<p>"Cortilla, señor," Panchito grinned.</p>

<p>Followed by the other <i>vaqueros</i> they descended the slope
and resumed their journey boldly on the King's Highway. After a
time they broke from the hills and saw before them the curve of a
shore, and dark wooded ridges beyond, and a low headland where surf
gleamed white, and a straggle of white buildings and a ship
anchored in the silver tranquillity of a bay.</p>

<p>They rode into the slumbering town, remarked only by the clamor
of innumerable dogs. Past scattered smaller buildings built here,
there, and everywhere, without order, they made their way to a
central plaza composed of several long two-storied buildings and a
number of the larger type of dwelling houses. A fort with mounted
cannon stood beyond them on a low cliff. There were no streets. The
place was profoundly asleep. There was no movement of any kind, no
light showed; except that from the tall mast of the ship gleamed a
single lantern, and up the sands of the beach at long spaced
intervals a gentle wash crept lazily and receded with a sigh, a
somnolent breathing of the sea.</p>

<p>Before one of the houses facing the plaza they stopped.</p>

<p>Don Sylvestre dismounted, knocked. To one who finally answered
he conversed for some time in low tones. Then Andy was summoned.
The <i>vaqueros</i> disappeared with the horses. He entered the
house. The door was closed behind him.</p>

<p>Andy was bowing to his host. The latter was a slender man,
young, taller than most, with a remarkably white skin, of a simple
but commanding presence. At the moment he wore a heavy silk robe,
evidently donned hastily at the summons. He was dignified and
reserved in manner, but greeted the mountain man cordially enough.
Andy was at once struck by the fact that this was the first
Californian he had seen wearing his hair cut short. Don Sylvestre
introduced him as Don Juan Bautista Alvarado, a name that then
conveyed nothing to Andy, and was indeed as yet little
distinguished, but which later was to become well known in the
fulfillment of destiny.</p>

<p>There was no conversation. Alvarado showed no curiosity as to
his guest, apparently satisfied for the moment with what Don
Sylvestre had been able to tell him in their brief interchange at
the door; nor did he permit his glance to betray inquisitiveness or
other motive than that of a polite and exquisite hospitality.</p>

<p>Candle in hand, he led the way to sleeping rooms and there left
his visitors. Andy composed himself, tired after two days and
nearly two nights of incessant activity. He viewed another specimen
of the elaborate California beds with complacency; nor, after he
had stretched himself between its sheets, did he long lie awake.
The night was very still. Even the dogs had ceased baying the moon.
On the beach the wash whispered softly against the sands. Beneath
the silence beat the diapason of distant surf. From the ship in the
harbor a bell struck briskly twice.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>THE following morning his hosts seemed to be in no haste. They
sat with Andy in the patio and smoked cigarettes and talked. It
would have been very pleasant had it not been that Andy felt time
was being wasted. The sun was soft and warm, the small birds
twittered, sounds of the town were muffled by the walls. But
shortly Alvarado noted his uneasiness and reassured him. Cortilla
was out of the way for some days, at least: for he would conclude
that Andy must be in hiding near the <i>hacienda</i>, or a
fugitive, and the Mexican would not return without a search. The
hour was too early for an interview with Figueroa. So why not enjoy
the time of waiting?</p>

<p>Alvarado proved to be a fluent and intelligent talker, a shrewd
and practical judge of conditions. He spoke slowly, with a reserved
and formal courtesy, but beneath his manner Andy sensed the
movement of a restless and ambitious spirit. His outlook was
surprisingly wide as compared with the natural provincialism of his
country-men; and he seemed avid for new information and new points
of view. Possibly for this reason Andy found himself more and more
involved in the talk, until the conversation became a dialogue,
with Don Sylvestre apart listening.</p>

<p>Alvarado asked many questions. They were not the type of
question to which Andy had been accustomed. Most people wanted to
hear of adventure: this Californian was more interested in
movements. He inquired closely of Andy's own journeys, and was much
struck by the fact that the mountain man had been of Jedediah
Smith's party. He wanted details. He traced back through Andy's
individual experiences until his questions had evoked in Andy's own
mind a picture of a gradual opening of a country. For the first
time the young man saw the thing whole, for the first time realized
what had happened in the short dozen years of his Western life. At
their beginning the frontier stopped little beyond the Mississippi.
He himself had been one of the first to cross by the Cimarron to
Taos and Santa Fe, where now, Alvarado told him, flowed the
steadily increasing commerce of the prairies. He had been but a few
days behind those who had discovered the easy way of South Pass
through the great Continental Divide. In his time had been opened
the unknown of Green River, the Virgin, the Central Basin. He had
with his own eyes seen the supposed impassability of the Rockies
leveled by the stubborn enterprise of his fellows, so that
inaccessible solitudes had become neither inaccessible nor
solitary.</p>

<p>"You have twice crossed our Sierra, señor," said Alvarado. "Tell
me: do you think that you could do so again?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Andy. "The passage is indeed of some
difficulty, but a good mountain man could always accomplish it at
proper season."</p>

<p>"And on occasion you could lead others by the way you have
come?"</p>

<p>"That also I could do, señor, I think, if these others were
strong men and well found. Do you desire me to undertake such an
errand, señor?"</p>

<p>But this, it seemed, was not Alvarado's thought. He shook his
head, and changed the subject unexpectedly to speak of George
Washington. He knew much of George Washington, whom he greatly
admired; His knowledge was detailed.</p>

<p>Abruptly he veered to local politics. He took them much more to
heart than did any of the <i>rancheros</i> with whom Andy had come
in contact.</p>

<p>"That is our trouble: the indifference of men like yourself,
<i>tío</i>," he said respectfully to Don Sylvestre. "It is absurd
that we permit Mexico to send us their broken-down military men to
govern us. It is absurd that we submit to the laws they make for us
from these hundreds of leagues' distance." He turned to Andy. "They
believe any renegade who gets their ear, and they send us men to
rule us who have no sympathy with our problems. Not one
<i>penique</i> of Mexican money has ever been brought to this
country, <i>señor</i>; not one!"</p>

<p>"Nor do we send money to Mexico," Don Sylvestre reminded him
lazily.</p>

<p>"Except in the private pockets of some of these Mexican
officials," amended Alvarado. "That is the point I make: that we do
not contribute to or depend upon Mexico, so why should we not rule
ourselves? And we shall see this much, within a few years, that
Mexico will be forced to recognize a governor chosen from our own
people."</p>

<p>"Yourself, Juan," said Don Sylvestre indulgently.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," agreed Alvarado composedly, "or Guadalupe Vallejo, or
José Castro, or José Noriega or many another. That much will surely
come about; and then we shall have different laws of the trade, and
for the mission, and above all for the land."</p>

<p>"We get on very well," said the <i>hacendado</i>. "Matters are
perhaps not the wisest, but they suit us well enough."</p>

<p>"But how will they suit the others?"</p>

<p>"What others, Juan?"</p>

<p>Alvarado gestured toward the mountain man, who was listening
with lively interest.</p>

<p>"Those who follow him, will they be suited? They are the people
whom the great Washington led in revolt against just these things.
Have you not heard the things our friend here has told us? Have you
not seen the picture he has drawn? They but pause yonder, the other
side the Sierra. Soon they will find the way, as this one has found
it. What then? Send to Mexico for instructions?"</p>

<p>"Are there not instructions already?" Don Sylvestre pointed
out.</p>

<p>"Surely. And they change; and they are ridiculous. See what this
new man, this Figueroa brings. He is told," Alvarado checked the
items on his fingers: "To examine conditions&mdash;which means to
do as he pleases; to favor explorations&mdash;which means nothing;
to encourage the distribution of lands both to citizens and to
foreigners. Also, he must keep out Russians and English, who are
not foreigners, I suppose; and he must enforce strictly all the old
regulations which say, among other things, that one visiting the
country must obtain permission and must stay but a year, and all
the rest of the <i>absurdos</i> of Mexican origin. Which means
simply that Figueroa will do as he likes; and the one who succeeds
him will do as he likes, and we Californians will continue to say
'what does it matter?'"</p>

<p>"Well, <i>sobrino mío</i>," returned Don Sylvestre with
comfortable irony, "all that you will arrange when you become
governor."</p>

<p>Alvarado ignored the irony.</p>

<p>"Could I&mdash;could any of us?" he seemed now to be speaking
more to himself than to his companions. "Not single handed, nor
with the few who see. We can try; we shall try. But first we must
take our own business into our own hands: we must shake off
Mexico."</p>

<p>Don Sylvestre smiled at Andy.</p>

<p>"It is not comfortable to be <i>político</i>," he observed. "You
must not take my nephew too seriously. He is a good
<i>californio</i> just the same."</p>

<p>"You think that California will be an independent state?" Andy
was really interested.</p>

<p>"That cannot be: I am not so foolish. Consider: in all this land
there are but few thousands of <i>gente de razon</i>: California
cannot stand alone. With Mexico; yes, she might. But is that
possible? I do not know. We shall see."</p>

<p>His eyes became distant, and he uttered a prophecy (Attested)
remarkable at that time. "Don Andres," said he, "it is only a
question of time when our country will belong to your government. I
regret this, but it is undoubtedly a ruling of providence."</p>

<p>Something clicked in Andy's brain. For a fleeting instant the
years rolled back. A green untried boy he stood, hat in hand, in a
dim, richly furnished library. Before him paced a tall hawk-faced
man with blazing eyes, Benton of Missouri. He heard again the
fragments of words that man had uttered, a clear echo from the past
of long ago, "One people; one flag; a mighty civilization that
shall extend; that must extend, from sea to sea." "We are born to a
noble destiny," and again, "You are highly privileged, beyond
most." The words had lifted him high; but in the long years the
wave had fallen with forgetfulness. Now beneath his spirit he felt
once more its mighty surge.</p>

<p>It was but a confused moment that passed. He came to himself
slightly bewildered. Alvarado was still talking. Andy did not
clearly hear what he was saying. Don Sylvestre's indulgent tones
penetrated his consciousness.</p>

<p>"Some young men turn to gambling," he was addressing Andy, "and
some to wine and some to women. This one turns to <i>política</i>,
which is less amusing. These things may be as you say, <i>sobrino
mío</i>, but it occurs to me they are a matter of years, and I
shall not be here to observe. But now, at this moment, it is, it
seems, an affair of Figueroa."</p>

<p>"True, true!" Alvarado threw aside his preoccupation.</p>

<p>"Do you, <i>tío mío</i>, walk about a little with our friend. I
will pay my respects to my beloved governor and see what can be
arranged."</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>DON SYLVESTRE and Andy went out together. The <i>hacendado</i>
seemed diverted over what he called the vaporings of Alvarado. He
seemed to look upon them as manifestations of youth which would be
outgrown&mdash;but which now were evidences of an independent
spirit.</p>

<p>"Juan was always that way," said he. "When he was a young boy he
always wished to read, and he did not confine himself to the books
allowed by the <i>padres</i>. He read many contraband books,
displaying great ingenuity in eluding the vigilance of the friars.
You noted that he wears his hair cropped. He was the first in
California to do so. He cut his hair at the age of fifteen, 'to
show his independence,' he said. Now Guerra and Vallejo follow his
example. He may end by setting a fashion. Who knows?"</p>

<p>Andy had not before seen the <i>hidalgo</i> in so familiar and
discursive a mood. He encouraged the old gentleman in his
gossip.</p>

<p>Certainly it was a good hour for gossip. The little sprawling
town was in its time of animation. The plaza and the space beyond
the custom house were very busy. A squad or two of soldiers drilled
near the fort: gayly dressed <i>caballeros</i> trotted about at a
hand pace or dashed racing over the hard sands of the beach; a
motley crew milled about afoot or lazed against whitewashed adobe
walls. They looked like what they were&mdash;pearl fishers,
masterless soldiers of fortune new come from Mexico, bandits,
pirates, smugglers, and a few Yankee sailors rolling about from the
ship. Indians were all about. They seemed to Andy even more
primitive, if possible, than those he had encountered in the
valley; wearing only a breech clout, and their coarse hair hanging
down their backs to their waists. Some of them, when they came in,
carried bundles of skins of deer or beaver. These they took
promptly to a low adobe whence emerged a very fat pock-marked man
who bullied and bawled at them and finally gave them bottles and a
little money and took the skins. For this reason most of the
Indians were more or less drunk. Those sober enough squatted in
circles playing some sort of gambling game with sticks. The others
simply howled, like wild dogs, without intermission, until a
<i>caballero</i>, obviously maddened beyond endurance, emerged from
one of the houses, leaped on his horse, roped one of the savages,
and dragged him about in the soft dust of the plaza. Nobody but the
victim seemed to pay this performance much attention, but the
howling ceased for a little while.</p>

<p>A man rode into the plaza, and across it to the beach, dragging
behind him at the end of his reata a bundle of rawhides. This Don
Sylvestre explained was one of the smaller <i>rancheros</i> from
the immediate vicinity come in to do a little shopping, and the
bundle of cowhides was his purse. Nobody but Andy seemed to find
this quaint. The horseman rode ahead methodically, the dust rising
like smoke from the pack plowing along behind. People gave way to
him. At the beach, but just above high tide, he loosened his reata
and rode back to the adobe presided over by the pock-marked fat
man, into which he disappeared.</p>

<p>That adobe was the center of much activity. It was a public
<i>taberna</i>, said Don Sylvestre, of the lower order; and the fat
man was a foreigner&mdash;a Portuguese, he thought, or maybe
English, he added. But violent and shrewd, whatever he was. His
place was frequented by the soldiers and <i>vaqueros</i> and
<i>peones</i> and sailors, when they came ashore. In the evening
there were <i>fandangos</i>. Don Sylvestre shrugged his shoulders
disdainfully. It was a rough place, not to be noticed by a
<i>caballero</i>. As though to emphasize the roughness, at that
moment two angry men of the <i>vaquero</i> type burst from the door
into the open. Their emergence was not entirely voluntary, for its
motive power was the flat of the fat man's hand on the back of
each. Immediately the two flew at each other, swinging their heavy
spurs held by the end of the straps. These were weapons not to be
despised. But the fight was not permitted to reach the interesting
point. A girl, probably the cause of the trouble, darted from the
door, interposed between the combatants, shrieked a volley of
Spanish so rapid that Andy was unable to follow it. After a moment
all three reentered the tavern. A few of those within hearing
looked up languidly, but without especial interest. A woman,
obviously of the upper class, passed within ten feet of the rumpus,
without, apparently, even becoming aware of it. She was very
beautiful, dressed soberly in black, stepping in slow-paced
dignity, her head high. Two paces behind her followed an Indian
girl carrying a folded rug over her left arm. Her air was of one
entirely alone: the teeming life of the plaza seemed not to exist
for her. Nevertheless, she saw Don Sylvestre and inclined her head
to his sweeping salutation. Andy thought he had never seen a face
so sad.</p>

<p>"She is of the De la Vegas," said Don Sylvestre, "and she goes
to mass. There is mass said each hour, beginning at dawn, so that
those who require the consolation of religion may find always
opportunity to attend. I am told that one of the De la Vegas is
present at each mass."</p>

<p>"They must be a very pious family," observed Andy, in order to
say something.</p>

<p>"They expiate a mortal sin. I will tell you of it, if you wish.
Let us stop here for a time in the cool of the shade." They sat on
one of the adobe benches attached to the front of the custom house
fronting the water. Immediately below them began the arc of the
beach that curved away to the right, and so, across the way, to the
left again to encompass the sheltered part of the little bay.
Across its width Andy saw the gray-clad dunes, and beyond them the
rise of wooded hills through which he had ridden the night before.
A dark and rocky headland to his left cut the view of the open sea,
and beyond it he could hear the muffled beat of the surges that
swept past to break white on the distant shore line across the way.
But here within its protection the swell had fallen to a gentle
wash that crept up the strand and receded with a sigh. Bands of
tiny sandpipers followed its recession to its extremest ebb,
snatching hastily at invisible quarry during its brief hesitation,
only to twinkle away in retreat before the lazy surge of its flood.
Two pelicans soared on slow wing, their tremendous beaks pointed
downward in vigilance for their prey. They looked absurdly like
gigantic mosquitoes. Occasionally one or the other of them let go
all holds and fell like a plummet to hit the water with a
tremendous splash. Ribald gulls wheeled about them screaming,
snatching both at their prey and at the great dignity that informed
their grotesqueness. Of these pirates they seemed completely
unaware, but floated atop the water in serene buoyancy, like little
ships. And beyond them was the ship itself at anchor lifting and
falling gently, its spars and yards lined clearly against the blue
background of the sky. Small figures moved on her deck. A boat
bobbed and tugged alongside like an impatient child.</p>

<p>Don Sylvestre lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>"There was," he began abruptly, "in earlier days, when I was
young, a <i>doncellita</i> named Ysabel Herrera. I remember her
well. She was very beautiful; and all the young men of that time
sang beneath her window. Some of them did so because they loved
her. Others&mdash;and I was one of them&mdash;" Don Sylvestre
paused to laugh softly&mdash;"because it was the fashion. For she
was <i>la favorita</i>, you see. But one who loved her to madness
was a young man named Vicente de la Vega. Many wished to marry Doña
Ysabel, but she was a coquette, and she would not choose. So at the
last she said that she would marry the one who would bring to her
the finest string of pearls. When she had said this, Vicente de la
Vega disappeared and was no more seen for a very long time, but
when he returned he brought with him a string of pearls such as had
never been seen by any of us, a magnificent necklace, each pearl
perfect, worth a king's ransom. So Vicente and the Doña Ysabel were
betrothed, and a grand ball was given to celebrate the betrothal.
And just at the height of the festivities the door opened, and in
it stood a priest, a stranger to us all. I can see him now, tall,
gaunt, stern, his garments stained with travel. His face was such
that the music stopped short, and we all turned to stone.</p>

<p>"Sacrilege!" he cried.</p>

<p>"And so, <i>amigo</i>, we learned that this thing had happened
through the madness of Vicente de la Vega. You must know that for
many, many years, whenever one of the fishers of pearls in Baja
California had brought up a pearl of unusual perfection, he
journeyed with it to the shrine of Our Lady of Loreto, and there
before her altar he piously dedicated it to her. So that, one by
one, through these many years, Our Lady's necklace had grown to be
the wonder of the world. And this necklace it was that Vicente de
la Vega had brought to the Doña Ysabel, <i>la favorita</i>; and in
the rape of it he had stabbed to death the guardian priest.
Sacrilege indeed!</p>

<p>"You can imagine, <i>amigo</i>, the horror of us all. But this
Vicente was a bold spirit; and Ysabel Herrera must have been
touched by his same madness. Women are strange creatures. Before we
had recovered from our horror, they had fled together. In the
harbor was an English ship. This undoubtedly they hoped to reach
where, under protection of heretics who know not the blessed
saints, they might yet be saved in this life though undoubtedly
damned forever in life to come. But the soldiers, and many of the
others, pursued them close. They failed to reach the beach, and
turned along the cliff yonder. There, as they ran, Vicente was shot
dead. But as he fell Ysabel seized his body and leaped with it into
the sea. They were never found, <i>señor</i>; and so were lost
forever the pearls of Our Lady of Loreto; and so it is that, though
this was many years ago, one of the De la Vega women attends mass
each hour every day."</p>

<p>After a little bugles began to blow. They strolled together to
the <i>presidio</i> to watch the drill. Andy was not very much
impressed with either the numbers, the equipment, or the discipline
of the soldiers. Nor did the set defenses look formidable. The
cannon at their corners pointed every which way; Andy wondered
whether they were dismantled. The walls of the fort were flimsy,
vulnerable to the lightest cannon shot, or even the simplest
battering ram, in determined hands. By the gateway Andy saw hanging
a curious object which on examination proved to be a number of
dried human ears strung together on a cord. These, Don Sylvestre
explained, had been brought back to the <i>comandante</i> by
soldiers sent on campaigns against the Indians, as proof of
efficiency. Andy remembered the slaughter of the innocents which
had inaugurated his Californian experiences, but said nothing. Don
Sylvestre remarked that the cannon mounted on the rise at the edge
of the beach had some four hundred pounds of silver in its metal
and was said to discharge with a ringing musical note. "Though I
have never heard it," he added. "It consumes too much powder to be
fired idly." He was little interested in the military
establishment, but warmed up to tell Andy of old days when the
Spanish governors ruled.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," he told Andy, "that undoubtedly God intends
Monterey to be one of the great cities of the world. It has a
history of mystery. Vizcaino anchored in this bay in 1602 and
raised a cross beneath an oak, and the friars sang the mass, and he
sailed away to tell of the wonderful harbor he had claimed for the
King and for our Saviour. And then for a hundred and sixty-eight
years it was lost. No one could find it again. It became a legend.
And when Juan Perez rediscovered it, in all Mexico was great public
rejoicing. The oak of Vizcaino still stands."</p>

<p>The shrill shrieking of a <i>carreta</i> warned them to stand
aside. It moved in a cloud of dust, but was surrounded also by a
penumbra of yelling small boys and not a few grown-ups of both
sexes, but of the lower class. On the <i>carreta</i>, spread-eagled
to the frame of the cart, lay a living bear. The beast was bound
fast by rawhides, drawn so tight as almost to cut through the heavy
fur and the tough hide. It had given over useless struggle, for it
had been prevented the slightest movement; but its eyes glared red,
and the slaver dripped from its jaws. The boys, and occasionally
one of the girls, poked the helpless creature with sticks, or
darted in to pat it on the head. The <i>peon</i> drove stolidly;
but drew up when he observed the <i>hidalgo's</i> attention. Don
Sylvestre examined the bear with appraising eye. A man stepped
forward, taking off his hat.</p>

<p>"The bear is yours, then, Bartolo? You have good bulls?"</p>

<p>"Wild from the mountains, señor. You shall see a good fight.
After the hour of <i>siesta</i>, señor, if you will honor us." Don
Sylvestre nodded and turned away. He seemed, not indifferent, but
genuinely unaware of the poor beast's suffering. When Andy ventured
to remark on it, the Californian misunderstood his meaning,
assuring Andy that the bear would be permitted opportunity to
limber up before facing its antagonist. Andy gave it up. It was
again that blind spot that had so troubled him.</p>

<p>They returned to the house of Alvarado and sat at lunch.
Alvarado had made a little progress. Figueroa had finally consented
to an interview&mdash;tomorrow. He was not favorably inclined.
Indeed, at first he refused to have anything to do with the matter
until Cortilla's return, and only yielded to Alvarado's
importunities out of respect for Don Sylvestre's name. Alvarado had
not considered it wise to go farther. He had not attempted to urge
Andy's case in any way. So matters stood as before. The subject was
dropped. It was an affair of <i>mañana</i>.</p>

<p>Andy was silent, or nearly so, throughout the meal, but he
listened with interest and pleasure. He was as yet unaccustomed to
conversation for its own sake. Alvarado was a graceful and charming
host. He was of an active forward-looking spirit, with a theory for
every topic. To the restlessness of his mind Don Sylvestre's
comfortable conversation offered a pleasant foil. His dry comments
brought Alvarado's hobby horses to so dead a stand that the younger
man had perforce to laugh at himself, Thus when for five minutes
Alvarado had declaimed on the subject of education. He was educated
himself; he believed in education; he lamented the lack of schools;
he was scandalized at the present illiteracy; above all did he
consider it a disgrace that the women, especially of the better
classes, should lack elementary schooling. Andy remembered his own
feeling of shock when he had learned that Ramón's mother, that
gentle and high-born aristocrat, was dependent on the <i>padre</i>
to write her letters.</p>

<p>"You yourself must appreciate the value of education," Alvarado
insisted. "Otherwise why did you send Ramón to New York?"</p>

<p>"If a woman learns well four things she knows all she needs to
know," said Don Sylvestre placidly. "And in these four even you, my
<i>político</i>, must admit them well taught."</p>

<p>"And what are those?"</p>

<p>"Dancing, music, religion, and amiability," stated Don
Sylvestre.</p>

<p>Alvarado checked, hesitated; then laughed.</p>

<p>"Your cook could not have prepared a more exquisite dish than
this," said Don Sylvestre, helping himself again, "if he could
patter Latin like a priest."</p>

<p>"My cook, ah, yes." Alvarado lightly accepted the change of
subject. "Now, there is one! He is an Indian, and he is excellent,
as you see. But he is good only if I have him severely whipped
regularly once each month. And the diverting part of it is that he
himself knows this so well that he will come to me of his own
accord and beg me to have it done. That is true, I assure you. You
shall see."</p>

<p>The Indian, an elderly and wrinkled man, with extreme gravity of
countenance, came when summoned and stood in the doorway. He
solemnly corroborated his master's statement.</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>," he agreed; "that is indeed so. It is
undoubtedly a dispensation of the blessed saints."</p>

<p>After the meal his hosts retired for the <i>siesta</i>. Andy had
not yet come to this habit. Alvarado, questioned, thought it quite
all right for him to wander about as it pleased him. Except that he
negatived Don Sylvestre's suggestion that perhaps Andy might
accompany him, after the <i>siesta</i>, to visit the <i>Petrel</i>
in the harbor and make the acquaintance of the excellent Captain
Barclay, his countryman. If this were to be reported to Figueroa
the governor might conceivably consider it smacked obscurely of a
conspiracy of evasion.</p>

<p>So Andy took the Boone gun and tramped through the now somnolent
and deserted town to the wooded ridge that rose behind it, and sat
on a fallen tree, and breathed the soft air perfumed with heated
pine needles, and listened to the bawling of jays and the brisk
calling of quail, and thought of all the things he had seen and
heard.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>AFTER a time he descended the hill to the town. On the outskirts
he was drawn aside by a concourse of people gathered close about
the adobe walls of a corral. Some sat atop; others stood on rough
platforms permitting them to see over. A number were on horseback.
Andy climbed up and looked within.</p>

<p>(The bear fight is taken almost literally from contemporary
accounts of one such spectacle. See Davis, <i>Seventy-five Years in
California.</i>)</p>

<p>To a post in the middle of the corral the bear was tied. He had
considerable freedom of movement; nevertheless, he was firmly
shackled. Several strands of stout rawhide, possibly a yard or more
long, connected his two hind feet. To this a number of doubled
reatas were attached, the loops of which had been thrown over the
post. Thus the bear could move about the post within the circle
whose radius was determined by the reatas. A horseman armed with a
long pole maneuvered just out of reach. He kept poking at the bear
with the pole. His first object was to prevent the animal from
gnawing through his bonds, which otherwise he would very promptly
have done. As a by-product he had succeeded in arousing the beast
to frantic anger. After a few moments someone yelled. The horseman
instantly spurred out through the open gate, which was promptly
slammed shut behind him. At the same time another gate was opened,
and through it dashed a young bull.</p>

<p>This was no domesticated bull, even in the limited sense in
which that term might be applied to the range cattle; but a true
wild beast, a renegade that had long run the chaparral of the rough
districts of El Sur; long horned, slender barreled, as quick and
agile as a deer. He had been captured only after a long wait as he
crossed a tiny flat at daylight on his way to water. His kind and
the bear people were old acquaintances. By the very fact of
survival he had proved himself. He was instantly aware of the bear
attached to the post; and he was as swiftly cognizant of the fact
that he here encountered his hereditary enemy in an enclosed place.
In the open he would warily have fled at the mere scent of a bear.
Here he charged at once, and with what looked like irresistible
speed and power.</p>

<p>The bear had, at first sight of the bull, ceased its raging to
survey the newcomer through little eyes that seemed to twinkle with
calculation. Now, he rose to his hind legs and waited calmly until
the long rapier horns seemed almost to touch his chest. His body
looked to be utterly relaxed, almost somnolently indifferent. Then,
at the last split second things happened with lightning speed. The
bear's forepaws shot forward, clamped on either side the bull's
head. Andy saw the spread of the wide horns jerk to the vertical,
and then on over: almost to the horizontal again. The two beasts
went down in a cloud of dust. Instantly the bear was afoot again;
but the bull was dead, his neck broken.</p>

<p>Horsemen entered, cast their reatas about the dead beast's
horns, and dragged it out. The bear raged at them, straining
against his rawhide bonds.</p>

<p>The moment they had disappeared, a second bull was admitted.
This also was a wild captive from the chaparral. It was fully as
active and powerful as the first, but more formidably armed, in
that by a freak of growth its long horns, instead of spreading
wide, pointed forward almost like a pair of lances in rest.
Obviously the same tactics that had conquered the first bull must
result in the bear's impaling himself through the chest. The
spectators saw this at once and shouted in anticipation.</p>

<p>"<i>Viva toro! viva toro!</i>" they cried.</p>

<p>But they had not reckoned with the keen intelligence behind
those small red and blazing eyes. The bear had sized up the
situation as quickly as and more competently than had his audience.
He did not rise to his hind feet to meet the charge, but leaped
quickly sideways in avoidance; and as the bull passed he reared and
brought down his great paw so powerfully across its neck that the
bull was dashed to earth with such violence as to break off one of
his horns. Instantly the bear rushed at him, to pounce upon him
before he could rise; but was snubbed up short by his tether. The
bull was no less prompt in recovery. As he leaped to his feet he
brought his remaining horn sideways in a wide swipe that caught his
enemy, who had not recovered his balance, across the shoulder,
inflicting a long deep gash. The bear grabbed for the horn with
both paws, but again the hampering tether brought him up short. For
the third time the bull wheeled and charged, his single horn
pointed like a rapier. But this time the bear delivered the boxer's
blow from his paw, not at the bull's neck, but toward its knees;
and the bull, flinching from the threat, turned his head just
sufficiently to afford the bear opportunity for his head hold.
Again the horn tossed up and around; again the bull rolled over,
dead, its neck broken.</p>

<p>Once more the bear arose to his feet; but slowly. Blood streamed
from his shoulder, and he swung his head wearily. Ensued now a long
pause; and a wrangle the purport of which Andy could not fathom.
But after a little he began to understand. The man Bartolo
considered that the bear had provided his money's worth, to which
the crowd was entering a vigorous dissent. Its blood was up; it
wanted more. The argument was not with the spectators, however, but
with three other men, who crowded gesticulating about the owner of
the bear. Andy's neighbor, between excited shouts of <i>otra!
otra!</i> volunteered snatches of partial explanation. The three
men were, it seemed, the proprietors of other bulls they had
brought in for a try at the bear. They objected to being deprived
of their chance. Andy could not quite see how Bartolo&mdash;or the
owners of the bulls, for that matter&mdash;were making anything out
of what seemed to be a free show. Betting, the man said briefly;
and went on yelling. Andy could not see on what basis; but he gave
that up. Finally Bartolo seemed to abandon his objections. At last
he shrugged his shoulders and turned away. A moment later Andy saw
him on horse-back riding about, his hat outheld, receiving
contributions which those in the audience tossed him. He did not
solicit Andy. Andy did not know why. As a matter of fact, he was
taken for a <i>caballero</i> who was exempt, unless he happened to
feel generous.</p>

<p>The third bull was a larger animal than either of the other two,
thinner, rangier, and obviously in a frenziedly combative spirit.
His head swung from side to side; his eyes flashed green fire. Andy
did not know it, but before its admittance to the corral the animal
had been prodded to a fury. It wasted no time in preliminaries, but
charged at once. The bear met it as before; but a little more
slowly, a little less certainly, almost clumsily. It may have been
due to this: or possibly an unexpected twist of the head at the
last moment upset the nicety of the bear's calculation. At any
rate, the long straight horn passed through the bear's neck at the
exact instant the latter's paws closed about his antagonist's head
from above. There was a sharp snap, and the two hurtled violently
against the stout snubbing post. The bull was dead.</p>

<p>The crowd was shouting crazily. Andy's neighbor turned to him,
his eyes blazing.</p>

<p>"A fine bear, señor!" But neither he nor any of the others
seemed to have compassion for the beast. All were shouting
impatiently for the next bull, which was, his informant told him,
the last.</p>

<p>A slow anger was swelling in Andy's breast. This was not fair.
The bear was panting heavily; the blood was streaming from his two
wounds. Surely he had earned at least a respite. But already the
corral gates had swung back, and a great shout greeted the final
bull as it bounded vigorously into the arena. This time the bear,
though the blaze of his eyes advertised his undaunted spirit, was
obviously to be on the losing end. He was slow in standing up; and
as he made his customary snatch his hind foot slipped, so that he
missed his hold. The bull had charged with his head held sideways
to present one horn. It penetrated near the base of the neck, and
both rolled over together. Eyerybody cheered wildly for the bull.
No one&mdash;except Andy&mdash;seemed to have a thought for the
gallant stand of the wearied but undaunted old champion.</p>

<p>Both were afoot again, but the bear was now bleeding badly,
while the bull bounded high in exuberance, his tail lashing. It was
perfectly evident that the next charge must be the finish; that the
affair must be quickly, and at last mercifully, over. If Andy had
been in his sober mind he must have realized that fact. But he was
not in his sober mind. His anger wholly possessed him. He snatched
the long rifle to his cheek and shot the bull.</p>

<p>It is useless to speculate what might have happened had not
Alvarado and Don Sylvestre opportunely appeared. Possibly Andy
might have been lynched by the outraged populace and the licentious
soldiery. Undoubtedly, failing this, he must have landed in the
calaboose. Andy's act appeared to these people as gratuitous,
without reason or sense. They resented it.</p>

<p>Nor did his hosts, when finally a settlement had been made, find
it easy to get the idea.</p>

<p>"But that bear must die, señor, from his wounds," observed
Alvarado reasonably enough, "and that would happen quickly. Besides
which, the bull was a very fine bull."</p>

<p>This was entirely logical; indeed, Andy was forced by his common
sense to agree to it. Nevertheless, the illogical part of him was
stubborn; he was still glad he had shot the bull. Something of this
skepticism must have showed in his face, for he caught Alvarado
looking at him curiously. After a moment the Californian
laughed.</p>

<p>"You are still puzzled, <i>tío</i>," he said to Don Sylvestre,
"but I think I understand. Don Andres killed this bull for exactly
the same reason that he spanked our friend Cortilla!"</p>

<p>"Well, the bear had made a good fight," muttered Andy, "and the
whole world was against him."</p>

<p>Alvarado turned again to the <i>hacendado</i>, whose austere
face was relaxing to comprehension.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly our friend is crazy," said he, but there was in his
words no sting. "I think always you will find him fighting on the
weak side; and for that reason I think that always you will find
him in trouble. And," he added with half-affectionate amusement,
"for that same reason I think that always he will have friends to
get him out of that trouble."</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>NEVERTHELESS, the incident did not help. Public sentiment was
resentful, and this resentment must undoubtedly filter through to
Figueroa. Andy found the governor to be a thick-set swarthy man
below medium height with much black hair and a scanty beard. A
protruding lip and large prominent teeth were partly redeemed by
eyes of a peculiarly piercing quality. Contrary to Andy's
expectation, his manner was affable, even fascinating. He insisted
on making the occasion a social visit, although he had been clearly
enough informed of its purport. His greeting was courteous; he was
but recently come to the country; he was overjoyed at the
opportunity to become acquainted with a <i>hacendado</i> of Don
Sylvestre's wealth and reputation. Alvarado he already knew and
esteemed. As for Andy, Figueroa addressed him briefly but with no
less cordiality, affecting to believe that the whole matter was a
delayed application for the <i>permiso</i>, the <i>carta de
seguridad</i> without which no foreigner was supposed to remain in
the country. A small affair. It should be attended to by the clerks
with as little delay as possible.</p>

<p>"My lieutenant of troops should return within the day or two, if
it pleases your excellencies to amuse yourselves so long;"
Figueroa's teeth flashed in a significant smile.</p>

<p>"Cannot El Comandante Vallejo sign for the military?" ventured
Alvarado.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, El Comandante Don Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo is
absent on a mission toward Sonoma, beyond the bay." Figueroa
enunciated the words with meticulous nicety.</p>

<p>That was as near as the interview approached the vital subject.
After ten minutes of elaborate politeness the visitors
withdrew.</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>"WHAT think you, my <i>político</i>?" demanded Don Sylvestre as
they sauntered across the plaza.</p>

<p>"That I shall tell you in two words," said Alvarado. "The
governor will do nothing until Cortilla returns. That, I suspected.
But this you note: he made no offer of arrest. Our friend, here, is
still as free as the air. That is significant."</p>

<p>"Of what?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"Of one of two things. Either he hopes you will take advantage
of that freedom to flee and save him this trouble; or he hesitates
because Don Sylvestre appears to be your friend."</p>

<p>"He seems to me," offered Andy shrewdly, "to be a man of
decision, in spite of his manner."</p>

<p>Alvarado nodded vigorous acquiescence.</p>

<p>"He is part Aztec, that one. And, were he not a Mexican, I
should say that he means well by our country. But now I will tell
to you politics, my uncle, since you have called me
<i>político</i>, and you must listen. This governor is not having
so easy a time as you may think. He is not now popular in the
south. For why?" Alvarado shrugged. "You know the south,
<i>tío</i>. You remember how pleased they were when Echeandia,
because of his health, went to reside at San Diego, and so for a
while the actual capital was there, though officially it remained
still at Monterey, of course. They had hoped this arrangement might
be permanent. Now they resent the fact that Figueroa has returned
it to Monterey. That is one thing.</p>

<p>"Now for another. With Figueroa from Mexico came ten friars from
the school of Zacateca, which is in Mexico. These were to displace
some of our old <i>padres</i> of the missions, who are, as you
know, of Spanish blood and therefore viewed with suspicion by
Mexico. Also, it seems, he had definite instructions as to mission
lands. It is too long a story to tell you, though I know much of
it, for I myself, with José Castro, were of a commission to deal
with the subject. But the point is that Figueroa here too has
displeased the south, both in the things he has done, and above all
in the things he has not done. Myself, I think he has done the best
he can. Obviously he cannot disobey orders, which are to distribute
the mission lands to the Indians; but as obviously the Indians are
not as yet fit to own the lands, nor would they own them long.</p>

<p>"And for a third thing, and then I am finished with politics. It
is known that José Maria Padres had gathered in Mexico a large
number of people who come to California in the guise of colonists,
and it is strongly rumored that he may even have secret orders to
supplant Figueroa if the governor does not fall in with the policy
of despoiling the missions." Alvarado smiled. "Figueroa lets it be
known that he is in bad health and suffers from vertigo and the
dampness of the fogs. This is what I think: that if affairs go
badly this dampness may force him to take residence, like
Echeandia, in the south. If they go worse, the vertigo may cause
him, reluctantly, to resign. But if he finds the support he seeks,
then you will see his health improve." (As a matter of historical
interest, Alvarado was here in error. Figueroa actually died of his
infirmities after a brief administration whose wisdom seems to
indicate he might have been the best of the Mexican governors, had
he lived. )</p>

<p>"All of which is interesting, <i>sobrino mío</i>," submitted Don
Sylvestre, "but complicated to a <i>ranchero</i> who is not skilled
in politics."</p>

<p>"Why," said Alvarado, with a hint of impatience in his tones,
"it is simple. Figueroa must have the good-will of the north, since
he lacks that of the south. Even in small matters he must step
cautiously. I think he most heartily dislikes this whole affair.
Our friend here has most plainly put himself in the way of
imprisonment and exile: one does not interfere with an officer of
troops, and most certainly one does not chastise that officer with
his own sword. On the plain facts Don Andres should by now be
confined in the <i>calabozo</i> and by tomorrow be on the way to
San Blas; or even shot against a wall. But several things stand in
the way: your friendship, Don Sylvestre, for you represent a
sentiment unknown to Figueroa; the fact that he is my guest, and,"
Alvarado added with a gesture of deprecation, "I too am not without
influence. It is also a fact that Cortilla is turbulent, and I can
guess that Figueroa would like well enough an excuse to get rid of
him. You know what I think?"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Andy and Don Sylvestre together.</p>

<p>"That Figueroa awaits Cortilla's return so that it may be
Cortilla who shall be held responsible. But here comes <i>Señor</i>
Larkin. He has lived in Monterey only a short time, but already, I
think, he is very wise."</p>

<p>Thomas Larkin, destined to play an important&mdash;and a
sympathetic&mdash;role in the stirring later history of the times,
proved to be a dark, thin man who walked with a slight stoop. He
was dressed in European clothes, except for a <i>serape</i> across
his shoulder, and a <i>sombrero</i> with a silver cord and tassels.
He greeted Andy without surprise or emotion, his keen face devoid
of curiosity. Only his eyes flashed into his countryman's with an
instant's sympathy and understanding. He listened without comment
to Alvarado's recital, holding one hand behind his ear as if he
were a little deaf; a gesture habitual with him, though he seemed
to hear well enough on occasion. He nodded to Alvarado's
conclusions.</p>

<p>"I agree, Don Juan," he said, when the Californian had finished.
"And I will add this: that I think Figueroa would be immensely
grateful if you would do as he obviously hopes."</p>

<p>"What is that?" Andy asked.</p>

<p>"Why, simply, to mount your horse and ride east. I think I could
safely predict that you will not be too closely pursued. That is my
opinion."</p>

<p>"And mine," said Alvarado.</p>

<p>"Much as I regret it, it is also my own," said Don
Sylvestre.</p>

<p>"I will add what these gentlemen would never tell you," said
Larkin in English, "for they are your friends, and when a
Californian is your friend he will stick to you through anything.
But have you thought of the embarrassment you will cause them if
you force them to do so?" He laid his hand on the mountain man's
shoulder and gave it a quick shake. "I know how you feel," he said,
and in his voice was a world of kindliness. "But think!"</p>

<p>"I will," muttered Andy.</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and strode away.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>HE SAT again on the fallen log; and he did think; and his logic
and common sense brought him inexorably to the conclusion voiced by
Larkin. The only difficulty was, he did not believe it. That, his
reason told him, was because he did not want to believe it. But
reason had nothing to do with the matter. Again Andy was oriented
by one of his blind "hunches," which he had always followed, and
which he must follow now. It might be sheer obstinacy or
selfishness; it might unwarrantedly involve people he had every
reason not to involve; it might, very probably, land him in a
Mexican prison; but he must stick it out. He came to this
conclusion in no forlorn hope spirit of desperation. Quite to the
contrary, he swung down its current with a feeling of security
that, in anybody else, he would have designated as chuckle-headed.
He knew that feeling of old; and it had never failed him yet.
Somehow he always associated it with the old long rifle, the Boone
gun. It was his talisman through which on rare occasions somehow
flowed to him protections and leadings he sensed but neither
examined nor understood.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter X. El Politico</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>THE end of November approached, and the days were getting short.
So engrossed was Andy with his inner affairs, he did not notice
that the sun's rays had leveled through the pines, nor that he had
rounded the arc of the bay. He was brought to himself by the sounds
of hoofs and voices.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, a mountain man of a dozen years' experience
was rarely to be surprised by anything; certainly not sufficiently
to complete bereavement of his power of motion. Yet just so was the
case of Andy when, a moment later, the disturbers of his solitude
came into view.</p>

<p>The horses were three in number, each with its rider.</p>

<p>The latter were typical mountain men, long hair, shiny black
buckskin garments, moccasins, long rifles, and all. They were about
as congruous, in this gentle Californian coast forest, accustomed
to its pageant-like brilliantly dressed cavalcades, as a saxophone
in a convent. They rode close together, at a shuffling trot, and
their eyes wandered restlessly, never still for a moment. They
caught sight of Andy instantly, and stopped.</p>

<p>"Thar's one of them now," one of the riders said to the other.
"Mebbe so he'll tell us the way and how fur it is."</p>

<p>"How you goin' to ask him?" inquired the second
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Don't need to ask. Just say 'Monterey' and hunch up yore
eyebrows."</p>

<p>"That shines," admitted the second, "but wouldn't you think effn
they didn't l'arn white man's language they'd at least l'arn hand
talk!"</p>

<p>The third man did not speak. After a moment's attentive scrutiny
they set their horses again in motion.</p>

<p>By this time Andy had recovered from his astonishment.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Joe Walker," he said quietly. "Hullo, George." The
horses were again snatched to a halt.</p>

<p>"Who are you that knows my name?" said the third man
sharply.</p>

<p>"Take a look," advised Andy.</p>

<p>But the man he had called George uttered a wild shrill yell.</p>

<p>"Andy Burnett, by the 'tarnal!" he shouted. He cast himself from
his saddle, abandoning his horse recklessly, to seize the young
man's hand. "You horny toad you! What you doin' yerebouts? And whar
you from? And by the 'tarnal, boys, look at the foofaraw on the
critter! But I'd know that long barr'l'd piece of your'n among a
thousand! But what's your game, Andy? You settin' up for a Mex?
Jist <i>look</i> at the foofaraw!" All the time he was pounding
Andy exuberantly on the back.</p>

<p>"You might also take a look at that horse of yours," advised
Walker dryly.</p>

<p>"Doggone, I am always plumb fergittin' these yere California
hosses ain't broke to trapper ways," muttered George, setting off
in pursuit of the beast.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you again, Burnett," said Walker. "You know John
Price?" He waved his hand at the other member of the party. "What
you doing in this neck of the woods?" His eyes traveled over Andy's
get-up, and he grinned slowly. "That your war paint?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Purty good, eh?" Andy fell gratefully into the familiar
vernacular. "But where floats your stick, Joe? I'm sure surprised
to see you 'way over this side the ranges."</p>

<p>"Same to you," Walker pointed out. He swung leisurely from his
horse and squatted, frontiersman's fashion, on his heels. His
companion followed his example, and George, returning with his
recaptured horse, joined the group. Walker produced a short
stone-bowled pipe from his belt, filled it, pressed into the
tobacco a light from his tinder, and passed it to Andy. The latter
puffed strongly on it thrice and passed it to George. Until the
circuit was complete no one spoke further. Andy took part in the
little ceremony with an uprush of nostalgic pleasure that surprised
him. For the moment he was swept spiritually into a past he thought
he had closed away from him forever.</p>

<p>"You know where is this Monterey place?" Walker asked abruptly
when the pipe had been returned to him.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Andy.</p>

<p>"Is she far?"</p>

<p>"Just over the hill. I walked out from there."</p>

<p>"We're headed that-away. Want to get permission to winter."</p>

<p>"Hope you get it," said Andy. "They ain't very friendly to
mountain men just now."</p>

<p>"So?" said Walker. "Friendly enough over where we left the
boys&mdash;San Juan, they call it. Know the place?"</p>

<p>Andy nodded.</p>

<p>"How about you?" asked Walker. "How do you get to stay
here?"</p>

<p>Andy grinned ruefully.</p>

<p>"That's just it; I don't," said he.</p>

<p>He explained his position. They listened without interruption.
Only when he detailed his encounter with the lieutenant, Cortilla,
and how in reprisal for the latter's unprovoked massacre of the
harmless and confiding Indians he had spanked that official with
his own sword, did their attentive gravity break.</p>

<p>"That shines!" said John Price.</p>

<p>"So you see," concluded Andy, "looks like I might have to get
out. But doggone if I can make my mind up to it. And looks like you
boys might have trouble too."</p>

<p>In the interest of the narrative no one noticed that the dusk
had fallen. Mechanically, as though unconscious of what he was
doing, George Parker had scooped together a handful of pine needles
and dried twigs and had lighted a tiny fire. Walker for some time
made no comment, but considered, his brows knit. His companions did
not offer to break into his meditation. They waited, chewing
placidly. The orange glow of the little fire strengthened in the
dusk; began to reflect downward from the somber pine fronds
overhead. Behind the group the horses stood patiently, their heads
hanging, a hind foot tucked up, eyes half closed, dozing in
grateful rest after the journey.</p>

<p>"You speak this lingo?" asked Walker abruptly.</p>

<p>Andy nodded.</p>

<p>"That's good; none of us do. You can talk for us; We'll go see
this governor. He can't any more than refuse. All we want to do is
to winter here. If he does refuse, we can always go over toward the
big mountains until the snow goes in the spring. I reckon we'll
know how to take care of ourselves. There's nigh onto sixty of us,"
he told Andy.</p>

<p>Andy whistled.</p>

<p>"Sixty!" he was astounded, "Anybody else I know?" he asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>"We're workin' for Captain Bonneville," interpolated John Price
swiftly. "Sent us to take a look west of the Big Lake, and we got a
little furtherer than we meant to and had to keep a comin'."</p>

<p>Walker brushed aside further explanation for the moment. "We'll
go see this governor," he repeated, "you can talk for us."</p>

<p>"There are several who can do that," said Andy: "an American
named Larkin; and there's an American ship in the harbor."</p>

<p>"Yes, we saw her in the big bay up north&mdash;Captain's named
Baggshaw, (He meant Bradshaw, captain of the <i>Lagoda</i>.) isn't
he?"</p>

<p>"No, Barclay," amended Andy.</p>

<p>"Same man probably. Doesn't matter. But you better talk for us.
You're a mountain man yourself. You needn't be scared they'll hold
you. I reckon we can take care of that. And if they do get funny,
the rest of the boys will be over in a couple or three days to see
about it."</p>

<p>"I ain't scared," said Andy, "but don't get the idea you can
fight California, even with sixty long rifles. I used to think
these people no good that way, but I changed my mind."</p>

<p>"I reckon we can fight this part of California long enough to
get ourselves away, if we want to," said Walker grimly.</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Andy. He was in the current of events. He no
longer, even in his thoughts, attempted to guide them. "I was going
back anyway."</p>

<p>He got to his feet to lead the way, but Walker did not
immediately arise.</p>

<p>"We got a piece of venison," he decided at last. "Reckon we'd
better stay here till morning. Bad medicine to go in now. Mout make
trouble. Better by daylight. What think?"</p>

<p>They built up the fire; picketed the horses in an adjacent patch
of grass; made their simple dispositions for bivouac. It was, to
Andy, like old times. He took part with a zest that astonished him.
After a meal of the venison roasted on the ends of green branches,
once again they lighted the pipes, stretched themselves comfortably
at full length about the fire. The night was mild. Sweet odors of
pine needles evoked by the day's sun hung suspended in the tepid
air.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>IT WAS Andy's turn to ask questions. A thousand dormant
curiosities had awakened within him. A closed door had opened, and
through it blew sweet bitter cold from the mountains. George did
most of the talking, though John Price cut in from time to
time.</p>

<p>What had happened in the fur country? Why, many things. It was
mostly a mess.</p>

<p>"Heard about Vanderburg and what happened to him a'ter you done
lit out from Rendezvous a'ter the fight?" George wanted to
know.</p>

<p>"I told you, I've heard nothing, nothing at all," said Andy.</p>

<p>It seemed that the representative of the American Fur Company
had made up his mind to cut in on the territory of the mountain
men. To that end Vanderburg and Drips followed Jim Bridger and
Fitzpatrick after the close of business at the summer's rendezvous,
and came up with them on the Jefferson Fork.</p>

<p>"They meant to hog things," struck in Price. "Jim and Bad Hand
acted decent; they offered to divide up the kentry with them. But
they wouldn't do it. So Jim and Bad Hand left that kentry to them
and moved up to another place they knowed of. They figgered there
was enough for everybody. And danged if them other two didn't show
up thar a'ter a little!"</p>

<p>"That made Bad Hand and Jim so mad they couldn't spit," George
took up the recital. "So they sez to one another, if he wants to
foller something, we'll gin him something to foller. And they
starts out. And they sure led them a chase! Landed them finally
into the Blackfeet kentry. The Blackfeet swarmed out and killed off
Vanderburg, and that finished that! Fitz and Jim managed to git out
of it; but they was attacked too on their way out, and Jim tuk him
an arrow in the back, and he ain't been able to dig out the head
yit: she's stuck in the gristle."</p>

<p>"How about the Blackfeet?" Andy brought himself to inquire at
last.</p>

<p>"Those red imps of hell!" exploded Parker, but checked and spat
embarrassedly. "I done forgit you're a Blackfoot man, Andy," he
grinned shamefacedly. "If a man kain't cuss his friends, who can he
cuss?" he submitted. "The Blackfeet? Wall, they're hostile yit to
trappin' in their kentry. Bill Sublette made a round with nigh onto
two hundred men. They was too many, so the Injuns didn't attackted
them. They say the American Fur people is gitting to trade some
with them up on the Marais. I dunno."</p>

<p>"Two hundred men!" cried Andy. "Two hundred!&mdash;trapping in
one party!"</p>

<p>"Sure; that's the way they're doing things now. The days of us
old lone wolves is about done. We hunt in packs now. Lookahere,
Andy, while I tell you who was at Rendezvous this year. First of
all they was us, of course I mean the old mountain men, Bill
Sublette's company. Then they was the A. F. C. And then there was
Wyeth."</p>

<p>"I remember him," said Andy, "and his New Englanders. They were
about as green and helpless a lot as I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Wall, he l'arned. He's only <i>purty</i> good in the mountains;
but when it comes to trade he's an old he-coon and no mistake! Then
thar's Captain Bonneville and his outfit."</p>

<p>"Who's he?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"Ain't you run across him? Why, he's that army man that goes
projecting around the mountains a leetle of everywhar. He does a
leetle trapping and considerable trading and a hell of a lot of
just plain ramming around, but whether he's on gov'ment business or
his own, I dunno. Maybe Joe here knows. He's a sort of
<i>burgeway</i> for the Cap'n, him and Mike Cerre."</p>

<p>"I am in his employ," said Walker briefly, but volunteered
nothing.</p>

<p>"Well, so'm I," Parker laughed loudly, "so's Jack: and many
another mountain man that you wouldn't think would be workin' for
nobody but hisself. That's the way things is shaping."</p>

<p>"The Rendezvous," Andy reminded him.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Well, besides these they was another outfit yet, from
St. Louee, got up by Bob Campbell, that had just come out to make a
start. That was all the big outfits, but that was enough to one
time. Then they was a couple dozen or so free trappers, us mountain
men, that hadn't got hired yit. And one other outfit you wouldn't
guess at not effn I let you guess from now to Christmas."</p>

<p>"Then I won't try to guess," said Andy.</p>

<p>"They was a feller that called hisself a cap'n too; but he was a
Britisher. He knew something of the mountains," acknowledged
George, "though I don't know whar he l'arned. But he had with him a
party&mdash;say, yo're some on foofaraw yourself, Andy; but yore
foofaraw's got some style to her. But this foofaraw these fellers
had, why, it was just plumb funny! It'd make an Injun laugh. Funny
pants; funny coats with more pockets than a leg has hairs; funny
caps, some on 'em, with a front and a back roof to 'em&mdash;wall,
you jist ought to have seed them. When they come ridin' in', with
this yere Britisher leadin' the way with a two-shootin' rifle, you
could have collected you a bushel of eyes by jist goin' round and
knockin' 'em off us with a stick. And what you suppose they come
for? For nothin'! They jist come to shoot game! No trappin', no
tradin'&mdash;nothing with nothing in it for them. They was making
nothing from it. Contrariwise they was payin' this Britisher to
bring 'em! Now can you figger on that?"</p>

<p>Andy's mind harked back to boyhood days, and breathless moments
with the old Boone gun&mdash;larger than himself&mdash;steadied
across a fence rail. He thought he could; but he did not say
so.</p>

<p>"Those were what they call sportsmen, George," Walker cut in
dryly.</p>

<p>"They were what I call crazy," said George, "and I bet the
Injuns git 'em, or a mule rabbit bites 'em. I talked with one of
'em. He was proud as a bull ellick because he'd done clumb right to
the top of some mountain or other, right above timber line, whar
thar warn't even a whistler, let alone ary game. 'Why,' he tells
me, 'I was the only man ever done it!' All them sportsmen seemed to
think a lot of that. I was tellin' somethin' about that Hole I
trapped in up beyont the Rocky Fork. 'Why;' sez one of them, 'Mr.
Parker, you was the only man in that kentry, wasn't you?'" George's
voice became a mincing falsetto. "'Hell,' sez I, 'that was no great
shakes. I didn't even have a nigger to boss. I come within one man
of bein' nobody.' That," he resumed after a moment, "is why John
yere and I, and a passel of others, tuk up with Joe when he hired
out to Cap'n Bonneville."</p>

<p>"On account of the sportsmen?" asked Andy, amused.</p>

<p>"On account of the way things is goin'. Why, Bad Hand went over
to the Crow villages jist to ask 'em could he make his fall hunt in
their kentry, like he always done&mdash;the Crows, mind you, that
never bothered nobody yit, to amount to anything. And right off
they tuk everything he had and turned him loose; robbed him clean.
And a'terwards he found out they done it because the A.F.C. people
hired 'em to do it. That's the way things are gittin' to be, If a
man hires out to one company and then changes over next year to
another company, chances is he is killed for doin' it. Ain't that
right, Joe?"</p>

<p>"It's a good deal so," admitted Walker. "The Indians are getting
more and more demoralized by this attitude of the whites toward one
another. And they are using a lot of liquor."</p>

<p>"Makes me plumb sick," said Parker. "Gittin' so they in't room
for a man to take exercise."</p>

<p>For a time they smoked in silence, contemplating sadly the
passing of the good old days. This was in the year 1833. The
"explorers" were not to appear until another decade had passed.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>ANDY roused himself finally to inquiry of a more personal
nature. Now Walker took up the story. Andy listened to a first-hand
account of an expedition that has since become famous: the journey
west from Salt Lake across the barren starving country&mdash;Andy
nodded understandingly, for with Jedediah Smith he had made this
trek; the headwaters of the Humboldt, down whose course they had
followed hopefully, only to encounter disappointment when, instead
of flowing on into the Pacific, as they had hoped, it ended in the
"sink." Some trouble with the miserable Indians of the country.
They were so ignorant they did not know the power of firearms. Had
to be taught.</p>

<p>"Some of the men got out of control," Walker confessed. "More
were killed than I wanted."</p>

<p>Usual starving times. They had killed their last buffalo on the
fourth of August; they had eaten the last of the dried meat by the
time they had reached the east side of the Sierra, two months
later. Until they had crossed the great range they encountered no
game bigger than a rabbit. They got along on the flesh of the
emaciated and exhausted horses, which they shot. When the matter of
subsistence was at its lowest, one of the party came upon an Indian
carrying a basket. The Indian dropped the basket and fled. It
contained acorns. Joe Walker talked at some length concerning the
acorns. They were larger than those back East, he claimed, some of
them as much as three inches long; and they tasted a lot better
than any chestnuts you ever ate. For several moments he held forth;
then checked himself with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Reckon a diet of lean hoss meat didn't leave me much of a
judge," said he.</p>

<p>It took them nearly two weeks to struggle through the Sierra.
Walker described in detail their difficulties. Andy did not realize
until later years that he listened to the first description of
Yosemite. But it was a hard country to get through; to get out of.
At one place, failing any other way, they had to lower the horses
over rock cliffs by ropes.</p>

<p>"It was easier where I came over," submitted Andy, "but that was
a little earlier in the season," he added.</p>

<p>The party had also come upon trees of incredible size. "I mean
<i>big</i>," said Walker earnestly. "Bigger than you ever saw
before in your life."</p>

<p>"I saw some pretty big ones where I crossed," said Andy. "Bigger
than anything in the Rockies."</p>

<p>"How big?" demanded Walker.</p>

<p>"Must be at least eight foot through."</p>

<p>"Some of these we saw was over twenty," stated Walker.</p>

<p>Andy politely made no comment. But later in life he understood
that he must have heard a first account of the Big Trees, probably
the Merced or the Tuolumne groups. Two claims always aroused his
indignation in after years: those of other "discoverers" of
Yosemite, and the pretensions of the "explorers" and "pathfinders"
who not only followed the routes of the mountain men, but were
actually guided over them by the latter. At this moment, recalling
the imposing proportions of the sugar and yellow pines through
which he himself had passed, he allowed himself a silent
reservation as to anything larger.</p>

<p>After that, Walker said, there was little more trouble.</p>

<p>They had found plenty of game. After a while they had reached
salt water, the Bay of San Francisco. Here this Captain "Baggshaw"
had been anchored. Acting on his advice they had turned south to
Monterey&mdash;</p>

<p>John Price raised his hand in emphatic warning. Walker bit off
his sentence. Distinctly, but distantly, the sound of drumming
hoofs became audible, a body of horse, coming in their direction
and at full speed.</p>

<p>With catlike agility the mountain men leaped to their moccasined
feet, rifles in hand. All but Andy, who kept his place.</p>

<p>"Just a bunch of these Californians going somewhere," he told
his companions. "They always travel that gait, day or night."</p>

<p>They looked at him doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Yo're gittin' keerless, Andy," chided George Parker. "Fust
thing you know you'll lose yore ha'r."</p>

<p>Down through the trees, below the slope, shortly could be made
out the glimpsed streaming mass of a considerable body of riders.
Obviously their course would carry them far below the bivouac. The
mountain men relaxed.</p>

<p>"They shore are hard on hosses!" muttered Parker. But now it
became evident that the horsemen had pulled down to a halt and that
one was riding toward the camp. The three mountain men watched his
dark figure warily; but Andy recognized the <i>palomino</i>, the
"silver horse," which was the favorite mount of his friend.</p>

<p>"Ramón!" he shouted.</p>

<p>The <i>palomino</i> leaped forward, plunged short. Ramón flung
himself from the saddle.</p>

<p>"<i>Valedor</i>!" he cried; "But it is you! I see the so-esmall
fire." His fine eyes swept Andy's companions and widened with
surprise. The mountain men were leaning on their rifles in typical
attitude, waiting, their eyes blank and noncommittal. "These are
friend of you?" asked Ramón. "How they come?"</p>

<p>"Over the mountains, as I did," said Andy. He turned to the
Americans. "This is the man I was telling you about, my friend,
Ramón Rivera. These are mountain men, Ramón: Joe Walker and George
Parker and John Price."</p>

<p>"<i>Señores</i>!" Ramón swept a bow.</p>

<p>"You the one that fit the white b'ar with a sword?" asked
George.</p>

<p>Ramón glanced toward Andy with comical vexation. "Always he tell
that foolishness!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was plumb foolish," agreed Parker candidly. "Leastwise,
I wouldn't want to tackle it. But doggone if it didn't take nerve!
Shake!"</p>

<p>Ramón shook. Walker and Price stepped forward and with great
solemnity grasped his hand.</p>

<p>"What's up? Who's that with you?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>Ramón did not immediately reply. He whistled shrilly.</p>

<p>The horsemen, who had been waiting in the dimness below the
hill, set their mounts in motion of approach.</p>

<p>"You know them," he replied to Andy's question, "they are our
guests of the <i>fiesta</i>."</p>

<p>The mountain men viewed their approach uneasily.</p>

<p>There were a great many of them. Left to themselves, they would
never, in a strange country, have permitted this. But Andy
understood their misgivings and reassured them with a muttered
word. He himself was recognized with obvious surprise, but with as
obvious pleasure. They shouted greetings to him and eyed with avid
curiosity the strange and picturesque appearance of his three
companions.</p>

<p>"See," said Ramón, "we are all here!" He waved a comprehensive
hand. "All!" He eyed Andy's blank face with amusement. "The
<i>fiesta</i> is finish," said he, "so we make the esport."</p>

<p>"Sport?" repeated Andy, groping.</p>

<p>"But yes. The <i>fiesta</i> she is finish; all the young men is
together. So we think we ride to Monterey. There is always esport
in Monterey. You have seen the governor? Eh? What he say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much yet," said Andy. "He is waiting for Cortilla to
come back."</p>

<p>Ramón nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is as I thought. The so-excellent lieutenant
is&mdash;what-you-call?&mdash;chasing the wild goose up the
Salinas. He come back some day. And these <i>señores</i>, your
friend, they are here with <i>permiso</i>?"</p>

<p>"That is what they have come to get, for themselves and their
party."</p>

<p>"There are more?"</p>

<p>"At San Juan," said Andy, "fifty or sixty of them."</p>

<p>"So many! And what says Figueroa to that?"</p>

<p>"They have not seen him yet. We shall go in tomorrow. These do
not speak Spanish. I am to talk for them."</p>

<p>"All these so many!" Ramón chuckled. "But that is something for
Figueroa to think about!" He thought for a moment; then chuckled
again. "<i>Holá</i>!" he shouted, and with one leap was in the
saddle. "<i>Mañana</i>! In Monterey!" He struck spurs to the
<i>palomino</i> and was off down the slope through the trees,
followed headlong by all his company, leaving behind them a scatter
of pine needles and dust that eddied in the swirl and settled
slowly.</p>

<p>The Americans looked at one another.</p>

<p>"Is that fellow crazy?" George broke the silence at last. "He
sure acts it."</p>

<p>But Andy shook his head.</p>

<p>"Crazy like an owl," said he loyally.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was troubled. What mad prank was this? The
situation was delicate enough as it was.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>FIGUEROA received them promptly, and with his customary
politeness, though his eyebrows went up for a moment at sight of
Andy. He listened to the request for permission to winter.</p>

<p>"Why have they come to California?" he asked.</p>

<p>Walker explained that, being instructed to explore the country
to west of the Big Lake, the party had gone so far into the deserts
that it could not return but was forced to push on over the
mountains. This statement was not entirely ingenuous. From Jedediah
Smith and others it was already sufficiently known that the areas
west of Salt Lake were not beaver country. Indeed, several of the
men, Joe Meek among them, had joined this expedition solely because
it was headed toward the Pacific. Having crossed the Sierra, Walker
added, it was obviously impossible to retrace their steps, now that
the winter had set in. Therefore they begged permission to spend
the season in California.</p>

<p>Figueroa sat for some time drumming a forefinger on the polished
table.</p>

<p>"There are threescore of these men, you say?" he asked Andy
finally.</p>

<p>"About that, <i>señor</i>."</p>

<p>"Do they fight?"</p>

<p>"I do not think they wish to fight; but, naturally,
<i>señor</i>, they would fight if they thought they had to do
so."</p>

<p>"You do not understand me," said Figueroa. "What I mean to ask
is whether these threescore are all armed fighting men, like these
before me."</p>

<p>"All men from across the mountains are fighting men,
<i>señor</i>," said Andy. He was beginning to think that the size
and the character of the party were having their effect. After all,
even sixty American rifles were not to be taken lightly. But the
governor's next words would seem to indicate that this thought was
not uppermost in his mind.</p>

<p>"My orders from Mexico are exact, <i>señor</i>. It is my duty to
compel these men to leave the country; or, failing that, to place
them under arrest."</p>

<p>"They cannot cross the Sierra now," said Andy.</p>

<p>"The way south is open, to Taos and Santa Fe," Figueroa pointed
out. "Would it be unreasonable, after a short period of rest, to
require them to take that route?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Señor</i> Walker says that might be done," Andy
translated back, "but the journey is distant and perilous, and he
would prefer to rest here. He says also that he is prepared to
resist arrest."</p>

<p>"You better tell him, Andy, that we're also prepared to see you
get a fair deal, and that when we go we intend to take you along
too," said Walker.</p>

<p>At this moment the door was opened by an attendant, and Ramón
entered the room. Figueroa turned toward him a frowning brow.</p>

<p>"I am, as you see, occupied, señor," said he coldly.</p>

<p>Ramón bowed profoundly. "It is not an intrusion, señor, as you
suppose," said he. "I am Ramón Rivera, at your service. I speak
well the language of these strangers. I may be of assistance."</p>

<p>Figueroa eyed him steadily for some moments.</p>

<p>"You are welcome, Don Ramón," he said at last, with the air of
having come to a decision, "and I am pleased to make the
acquaintance of another of your illustrious family. And," he added
graciously, "to receive the benefit of your counsel in this
affair."</p>

<p>"At your command, my governor." said Ramón, bowing again.</p>

<p>"I debate with myself," Figueroa spoke with soft deliberation,
"whether immediately to send these <i>americanos</i>, who have
arrived to the number of threescore at San Juan Bautista, out of
our country by way of the trail of Anza, as a strict interpretation
of my orders indicates&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And one of course obeys orders as a good servant of the
government," observed Ramón.</p>

<p>"&mdash;or to use the discretion that is undoubtedly mine and
permit them to remain until spring, when they may return as they
came."</p>

<p>"A course which is, as you say, undoubtedly within your
discretion as the personal representative of the Republic,"
supplemented Ramón.</p>

<p>"It is my duty to consider all aspects which are to the
advantage of our country," went on the governor. "Undoubtedly there
are among these strangers many who possess skill in the crafts
whose knowledge might prove valuable."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, señor."</p>

<p>Andy listened to this interchange with some bewilderment, for he
sensed beneath its banality an undercurrent of some sort which he
did not understand. Nor did certain incongruities escape him. Why
should Figueroa ask advice of a young man whom but a moment ago he
had set eyes on for the first time? A young man furthermore whose
reputation must have been well known to him?</p>

<p>But at this moment a confusion on the plaza outside drew the
attention of all. Through the open window could be seen a great
concourse of horsemen who paced slowly across the open space and
came to a halt outside the governor's house. They were talking and
shouting to one another, but as they drew rein the confusion
steadied. Someone raised his voice in song. One by one others
caught the air and joined in, until at last the chorus was lusty
and full voiced. The three trappers glanced at one another
startled.</p>

<p>"Why!" cried George Parker. "That thar's the 'Trappers' Song,'
or I'm a horny toad!"</p>

<p>Andy nodded. "I taught it to them," he explained.</p>

<p>"Wall, I wondered! But I don't git the cute of them words."</p>

<p>Andy did not explain the cute of the words, which were, indeed,
a celebration of himself as composed by that gay minstrel, Carlos
Lugo, nor that this version was not known as the "Trappers' Song,"
but as the "Song of Don Largo." Figueroa listened, without
expression, to the end.</p>

<p>"Who are these young men?" he asked Ramón.</p>

<p>"My friends," replied the latter. "They come with me to
Monterey. You see, my governor, we have held the <i>fiesta</i> at
the <i>hacienda</i> of my family; and that <i>fiesta</i> is
finished; and now, since we are all together, we come to
Monterey."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly the names of many of them should be known to me,"
suggested Figueroa.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, señor." Ramón paused; then began slowly, one by
one, as though calling a roll, to give their names&mdash;De la
Cuesta, Lugo, Vallejo, Martinez, Salvatierra, De la Palma,
Guitierrez&mdash;dozens and dozens more of singing syllables, on
and on without pause for breath; and Figueroa listened attentively
to the end.</p>

<p>"Monterey is honored," he said then, "and the hearts of our
ladies will be stirred at thought of so many distinguished
<i>caballeros</i>."</p>

<p>"And when we shall return, <i>señor</i>, then shall the
<i>caballeros</i> kiss their hands," said Ramón.</p>

<p>"Return?" said Figueroa. "Then you make a journey?"</p>

<p>"We make a revolution," said Ramón lightly.</p>

<p>A blank silence for a moment.</p>

<p>"Revolution," then repeated Figueroa sternly, "What mean you by
that word? Revolution against whom?&mdash;against what?"</p>

<p>"Why, that we do not as yet know," said Ramón with an air of
engaging frankness. "It is now good weather for revolution. I think
it will not rain for a long time yet. Is it possible you might
suggest something, my governor? Have you no enemy for us? Los
Angelenos? Los Diegans? Anyone <i>de la otra banda</i>? But no: I
talk foolishness. That would be to make the war but not the
revolution. I forget: revolution is to fight against the
government, is it not? Well, perhaps we shall not make the
revolution after all. That is a pity; it is such a fine weather for
revolution. We shall see."</p>

<p>During these long colloquies in a strange language the three
mountain men had waited stolidly. Now their curiosity got the
better of them.</p>

<p>"What's all the palaver, Andy?" they asked him apart. Andy shook
his head. Beneath Ramón's light tones he thought to catch the clash
of steel as though of rapiers engaging.</p>

<p>"I can't make out," he replied in low tones. "Seems like Ramón
is threatening him with a revolution if he don't let us be; but
that don't make sense."</p>

<p>"Well, with us to back him I bet we'd get up a right tidy little
revolution," asserted George stoutly.</p>

<p>"For a while," admitted Andy, "but that handful couldn't fight
all California and Mexico. I hope Ramón isn't that foolish. And
Figueroa doesn't look to me as if he scared easy. No, I feel
there's something else behind it that I don't get."</p>

<p>Nor did he get what followed. Suddenly Figueroa leaned back in
his chair.</p>

<p>"It desolates me, Don Ramón," he was saying, "to disappoint so
eager and so gallant a body of <i>caballeros</i>, but I can suggest
nothing further. If a campaign against the Indians seems to you
undesirable, there is nothing more. Should occasion arise, I shall
call upon your company, and I hope they may come to my banner with
the same zeal that now animates them."</p>

<p>"I hope that may be the case, <i>señor</i>," said Ramón. He
seemed to be waiting in expectancy.</p>

<p>Figueroa slowly drew toward him a sheet of paper, dipped the
quill, painstakingly wrote a dozen words or so, signed his name
with an elaborate flourish, sprinkled the wet ink with sand. A
second sheet he likewise inscribed; and ac third. Then he looked
up. After several seconds he handed one of the papers to
Walker.</p>

<p>"Tell him that is the permission he desires," he instructed
Andy.</p>

<p>He tinkled a silver bell, and to the clerk who answered it he
passed the second of the papers.</p>

<p>"This order for the lieutenant Cortilla," he commanded. "Send
horsemen with it at once to search for the lieutenant until he is
found. Following its receipt he will without delay and without
return to this post proceed to the <i>presidio</i> at San Diego,
where he will there take up his duties."</p>

<p>The clerk bowed and went out.</p>

<p>"This is for you, señor," said Figueroa courteously to Andy.</p>

<p>He arose from his chair.</p>

<p>"For the moment, señores, I must be excused. But," he addressed
Ramón, "I cannot permit these <i>caballeros</i> to disappoint the
ladies of Monterey. I must beg of you, <i>señor</i>, to request
them to keep me in their good graces."</p>

<p>"At your service, señor," Ramón bowed. "In this as in all other
things," he added.</p>

<p>The governor bowed in return and, before the Americans could
gather their wits to express their thanks, he had vanished through
the small door that opened at his back.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>ANDY stared at the paper in his hand. He was slightly dazed. The
thing was too suddenly and too simply resolved. He had the same
feeling he had often experienced in the mountains when groping and
lost in a fog. One moment he was involved in a situation so serious
that to it he must devote all his craft and caution lest he be
destroyed; the next, as though by magic, the mists had disappeared.
Ever since his first appearance on the valley plains of California,
the young man had lived under the shadow of a situation that looked
impossible of resolution; He could see no way out. And all at once
the way through opened, quietly, without the clang of melodrama.
But with the bewilderment was also a warm glow of satisfaction that
again the "hunch" on which he had persisted had held good. But
still it was to him incredible. The paper Figueroa had signed was
not merely a passport for a temporary visit: it was a permission to
become a resident, should he be so inclined.</p>

<p>Ramón, naturally, was elated and jubilant, as were the young men
outside. It took Andy some time to extricate himself. He did so as
soon as he could; for his mind was still unsatisfied. Walker and
his companions early slipped away.</p>

<p>"See you by and by, Andy," Walker told him, "when things are
quieter."</p>

<p>He saw them a few minutes later in a small boat bobbing across
the bay toward the just-arrived <i>Lagoda</i> and their friend
Captain "Baggshaw."</p>

<p>At length he and Ramón made their escape. They found Don
Sylvestre and Alvarado in the patio, conversing, smoking, and
obviously waiting for news. They listened to the young men's joint
recital in silence, but with evident approval.</p>

<p>"What is your opinion, Señor Alvarado?" asked Andy when they had
finished.</p>

<p>"My opinion? What should it be, except that all things have come
out most fortunately for you&mdash;and for us all."</p>

<p>"But why did the governor so suddenly change his mind?"</p>

<p>"He did not change it; he made it up," said Alvarado.</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Is not the reason evident?" queried Alvarado. "Here within less
than a score of leagues are a half hundred or so of your countrymen
with their long rifles, who, it might be supposed, would take your
part. Here also is our dear Ramón with all his youthful
<i>compañeros</i> breathing revolution against the tyrant. Is not
that combination enough to convince Figueroa he must yield?"</p>

<p>"But surely!" cried Ramón.</p>

<p>Alvarado laughed at the expression of stubborn doubt on Andy's
face. Ramón too saw it, but Alvarado checked the young
Californian's impatience.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Your friend is not stupid, Ramón, he is on the
contrary <i>sabio</i>. He sees farther than you. He sees that which
you do not see."</p>

<p>"No, I don't see it," disclaimed Andy, "but I feel it, and I
want to know."</p>

<p>"See what! know what, <i>nombre de Dios!</i>" cried Ramón,
exasperated.</p>

<p>"Why, just this, my cousin," replied Alvarado. "That, brave as
is the <i>americano</i>, and armed though he may be, fifty men is
only fifty men and may not stand against the power of a state; and,
brave as are your companions, they are after all but few and bear
no arms. Is not that it, Don Andres?"</p>

<p>Andy nodded. "And also that Figueroa seems to me a man who would
not yield to threats," he supplemented.</p>

<p>"<i>Viva!</i>" Alvarado cried approvingly. "You may not be
practised as a <i>político</i>, Don Andres, but I perceive you read
men well."</p>

<p>"All this talk is confusing to a simple <i>hacendado</i>,"
complained Don Sylvestre. "Would it please you, <i>sobrino mío</i>,
to say plainly what is in your mind?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said Alvarado. "It is very simple. You recall
what I have told you: that this new governor is not popular with
the south?&mdash;that he is there threatened with an enmity that
needs but an excuse? As for your friend <i>Señor</i> Walkaire and
his people, I think it is a satisfaction to the governor to know
that all of this winter there are at hand, if he needs them, sixty
good rifles. Even if he has no occasion to use them, their presence
is known."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is simple and understands itself," agreed Don
Sylvestre.</p>

<p>"But not so simple as all that!" warned Alvarado. "The
<i>americanos</i> would be a very welcome addition to the military
forces at Figueroa's command; but they, none of them, would mean
anything without one other thing."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Andy, as Alvarado paused.</p>

<p>"The support of the <i>californios</i> of the north. That is why
Figueroa hesitated. He did not know: he must find out. With both
north and south against him, he would be lost. How does the north
look upon these strangers?"</p>

<p>"I begin to see!" cried Andy.</p>

<p>"Which I do not," grumbled Ramón.</p>

<p>"Why," said Andy, "&mdash;and I beg of you, <i>Señor</i>
Alvarado, tell me if I am wrong&mdash;thus it seems: it is as I
thought, Figueroa did not yield to your threat of revolution,
Ramón. But from it he became certain how the <i>californios</i> of
the north felt in this matter. It taught him what he wished to
know. Is that what you think, <i>señor</i>?"</p>

<p>"I think you are not bad as a <i>político</i> yourself, Don
Andres," said Alvarado. "And," he added, "I am beginning to believe
this Figueroa, Mexican though he is, is a shrewd man who may govern
well. And I think, would he at this moment give us his confidence,
we would find him as well pleased as ourselves, for what with his
own forces and the great families of the north&mdash;whose names,
Ramón <i>mío</i>, you recall he had you say to him&mdash;and these
<i>americanos</i>, he can face south with a tranquil mind."</p>

<p>(Figueroa's policy as respects the Walker expedition has never
been explained, save on the vague ground of friendliness to
foreigners. This is not completely adequate in view of the strict
treatment of Jedediah Smith a short time before, and the
immediately following attitude of hostility to subsequent
immigration. Yet this governor not only accorded permission to
Walker to remain over the winter, but offered him a tract of land
seven leagues square if he would remain in the country. Only the
political situation above ventured seems to make this
understandable.)</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>AFTER a time Ramón and Andy took their leave and went out to the
plaza for the purpose of finding some of their friends. At the door
stood Panchito with their horses, in case they should wish to ride.
The <i>vaquero</i> was all smiles, for already the rumor of the
situation was abroad.</p>

<p>The young men mounted. Both were in the wildest spirits. To the
astonishment of the bystanders, unaccustomed to that boisterous
type of demonstration, Andy pounded his friend on the back.</p>

<p>"You turned the trick!" he cried, "you and the others! Let's
find them! If it had not been for you&mdash;It was just what was
needed-in the nick of time! It was a happy idea!"</p>

<p>"But not mine," Ramón disclaimed. "No, <i>amigo</i>, I could not
have thought of it. Even I," he made a comical face, "even I, the
so-foolish one; would not have thought it anything but
madness&mdash;why, consider, <i>valedor</i>, to come to Monterey,
so few, so empty of the hand, and be gobble up <i>pronto</i> by the
soldier if Figueroa tell them." He laughed and shrugged his
shoulders. "You think I am so foolish I do not see that? And these
others, are they so foolish also? No, no-no, you must not think
that!"</p>

<p>Ramón, for the moment, seemed wholly intent on defending his
reputation for sanity. Andy was puzzled and a little dashed.</p>

<p>"It was that Carmel," explained Ramón gloomily.</p>

<p>"Carmel!" cried Andy.</p>

<p>"Yes. Imagine to yourself, <i>valedor</i>, how she act. She talk
to us like washer girl. She call us coward. She demand we do
something. We ask her, what can we do? She say she don' care, but
do it quick. It is one escandal for the <i>doncellita</i> to act
this way. Mamá, she try to estop her. No good. She is wild. She say
if we do not go quick, she will go alone, by herself. So we say,
all right: we will go; and then she want to go too, but that is too
great a escandal, and Mamá would not permit. So then Carmel send us
off. We ask, can we eat before we estart, and she estamp her foot;
so we go without the eat." Ramón laughed. "At the last she want us
to esteal the governor and tak' him in the mountain until he
promise to let you stay! What you think of that? And do you know,
<i>valedor</i>, if it do not come out so good the other way, I
think maybe we do it! We got to do somethings, That Carmel say if
you do not come back she go to be a nun, sure!" Ramón stopped
speaking, and his jaw dropped. He stared after a billowing dust
cloud which marked his friend's headlong departure from the plaza.
Then he struck his spurs to his own horse and followed.</p>

<p>Even the swift <i>palomino</i> had difficulty in overtaking
Andy's much slower mount, so urgently was the latter pressed. And
even then Andy refused to check at Ramón's summons. Finally the
Californian leaned from his saddle, seized the reins, and by a deft
feat of horsemanship brought both animals to a half-circling halt.
Andy's face was dark with momentary anger, but he was helpless
against Ramón's practised skill at this sort of thing.</p>

<p>"You will tell me where you go!" the latter persisted. "No, I
will not let you go until you do tell me!"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, take your hands off!" cried Andy. "I'm just
going back to the <i>hacienda</i>. Come along, if you want to; but
let go."</p>

<p>The horse plunged and struggled, but the Californian's wrists
were iron, and the <i>palomino</i> stood braced, its ears laid back
in virtue.</p>

<p>"But for the love of me, <i>valedor</i>!" pleaded Ramón in
despair. "Listen, for one little minute listen; then you shall
go."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>Ramón released the reins and sat back in his saddle with a
sigh.</p>

<p>"What is it?" repeated Andy, gathering his reins in
impatience.</p>

<p>"If you do go to the <i>hacienda</i>, you will not see Carmel,"
said Ramón.</p>

<p>This directness had its effect. Andy's face fell. "Not see her?
What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Now you must listen: just for one minute you must listen!"
pleaded Ramón. "You shall not see Carmel. I know my peoples. It is
already a so-great escandal. Nothing like this has ever been
before."</p>

<p>"What are you driving at? Spit it out."</p>

<p>Ramón shrugged in despair. How make this direct young savage
understand in two sentences the elaborate, graceful, delicate
fabric of etiquette and ceremony so rudely rent by the
circumstances of the past few days? How make him understand that
consequently those conventions would in reaction more rigidly
obtain? He could not. So he stated bluntly the bare facts.</p>

<p>"After what has occur," he told Andy, "it will not be permit
that you talk with Carmel until you are engaged to be marry."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think I'm going there for?" demanded
Andy.</p>

<p>"But there is Papá!" expostulated Ramón.</p>

<p>"Well, what about him?"</p>

<p>Finally Andy was made to understand that this thing was not
merely an affair of personal agreement between himself and Carmel;
that Don Sylvestre must first of all give his formal permission for
Andy to begin to pay his addresses, after which, in due and
appropriate time&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is that all!" cried Andy, and was gone in another cloud of
dust, this time in the return direction toward Monterey.</p>

<p>Ramón looked after him in comic despair. He did not attempt to
pursue, but put the <i>palomino</i> to the shuffling Spanish trot.
Let him discover the rest from Don Sylvestre. No one better
qualified than the old grandee to bring Andy's impetuosity of
ignorance to an appreciation of the spaced and prescribed
elegancies of proper courtship.</p>

<p>But he had no more than emerged from the fringe of pines above
the town when he discovered his friend, still at full speed,
returning headlong. This time, however, Andy pulled up as they
met.</p>

<p>"It's all right!" cried the latter joyously. "He consents."</p>

<p>"How? I do not understand." Ramón was bewildered.</p>

<p>"He says it's all right."</p>

<p>"You ask my papá, and he says it's all right," repeated Ramón
stupidly. "Just that?"</p>

<p>Andy was gone.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>RAMÓN rode on. It was too much for him, beyond all belief. In
the village he sought out the head <i>vaquero</i>.</p>

<p>"Panchito," said he, "you will take three horses and you will
ride on the road to the <i>hacienda</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>."</p>

<p>"After a time, I think, you will overtake Don Andres, who will
be riding very slowly on a very weary horse. It may be you will
find the horse dead by the road and Don Andres walking. But you
will find him going toward the <i>hacienda</i>&mdash;of that I am
certain."</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>." Panchito's eyes were twinkling.</p>

<p>"You will mount him on one of the fresh horses, and you will go
with him to the <i>hacienda</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>," said Panchito.</p>

<p>"That is all, Panchito. Do this at once."</p>

<p>"<i>Si, señor</i>," said Panchito.</p>

<p>But as Ramón remained lost in thought, the <i>vaquero</i>
awaited his dismissal.</p>

<p>"<i>Señor</i>," he ventured at last.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I stood with Don Sylvestre receiving orders. Don Andres rode up
at full speed. Without dismounting, he said to the master, 'Don
Sylvestre, I wish to marry your daughter, Carmel.' Don Sylvestre
answered him, 'That is well. God be with you, my son.' Then Don
Andres rode away. That was all: no more, no less."</p>

<p>"Why do you tell me this, Panchito?" said Ramón.</p>

<p>"Why, Don Ramón," said the <i>vaquero</i>, and the carved brown
gravity of his face became more wooden, "all my life have I prayed
the blessed saints that I might behold a miracle."</p>

<p>"It occurs to me that the blessed saints have answered your
prayers," said Ramón.</p>

<p>"So it seemed to me," said the <i>vaquero</i>.</p>

<p>The two men looked into each other's eyes. Then suddenly both
burst out laughing.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter XI. Casamiento</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p>ANDY saw no reason why he should not marry at once. He was no
longer in danger from the government since Figueroa had issued his
permission to remain: Carmel loved him. It might have been natural
for the latter to wish for delay enough to prepare for the
elaborate wedding Andy understood all women desired; but, as a
matter of fact, Carmel proved to be as impatient as himself. The
greatest coquette of her time as long as her heart was untouched,
she became utterly devoid of caprice now that she was genuinely in
love.</p>

<p>The family council smiled indulgently at the ardors of
impatience. All but the little girl, Faquita. Her smile was of
lofty disdain. Andy had promised definitely to be her
<i>caballero</i>: he had deserted her for her older sister, and
both of them were behaving like untaught children who had never
heard of what is proper. Faquita looked down on them from the
serene heights of scorn. In like circumstances she would have known
correctly her role; while Carmel, who was older and presumably
practised in the social graces, was acting like an ignorant
<i>moza</i>. Not that Faquita would ever be called on to use this
knowledge; for she had decided to be a nun. She crossed her feet
and her hands and gazed at her sister with cool and clear-eyed
contempt.</p>

<p>Only with difficulty was Andy brought to an understanding of how
completely, up to now, he had overset all tradition, and that,
really, there must be a line drawn somewhere. The Riveras, again
with the exception of their youngest member, were quietly amused at
his total lack of comprehension. Ramón finally begged permission to
explain in English.</p>

<p>"But consider these, <i>valedor</i>," he told Andy, "what you
have done. You see my sister; you love; <i>pronto</i> you want
right off quick to marry her. You act just like she was
<i>moza</i>, and she is a <i>doncellita</i>, a <i>hildalga</i>.
Already what you do is like a escandal, but that is forgive because
you are <i>americano</i> and do not know; but more cannot be
forgive, because we are Riveras, and we do know."</p>

<p>"But what is the matter?" cried Andy. An enlightening idea came
to him. He thought now he had it. It was stupid of him! Of course!
He explained carefully to Don Sylvestre that in spite of
appearances he was not without resources.</p>

<p>In fact, he was well prepared to take care of a wife. He carried
with him a not inconsiderable sum of money from the last
Rendezvous. In addition he had with the Company, in St. Louis, a
much larger credit, the balance of what had been due him, as well
as the savings of his years in the mountain country. Through one of
the returning Boston ships he would make arrangements for a
transfer of this credit. Andy elaborated happily. He was amazed at
his stupidity. Naturally, no sensible man would wish to confide his
daughter to a man without resources.</p>

<p>But he was still more amazed at Don Sylvestre's reception of
this gratifying intelligence. The latter seemed to consider it
wholly unimportant. He waved his hand.</p>

<p>"But there is always plenty of money and plenty of land, my
son," said he.</p>

<p>Andy turned to Ramón in despair. "What more does he want?" he
asked. Ramón was laughing.</p>

<p>"Now, listen, soul of my heart," said he, "while I do tell you
all the things you must do if you were Espanish man. First of all,
you must ask the consent of the papá before you do speak to the
esweetheart at all of the getting marry."</p>

<p>"Well, I did that, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you ride back and you say, '<i>Señor</i>, I want your
daughter. That all right?' and then you ride off quick. Now, if you
are Espanish man you do not ask for yourself at all. That is very
bad. Your papá, or your <i>compadre</i>, go to ask for you. And the
papá of the <i>doncellita</i>, he do not give the answer right
away. He wait a week; maybe ten days. Then he say all right; maybe.
Then there is a ceremony of the betrothal. And after that you wait
two years, and you do not talk to the esweetheart except there is
present the mamá or the <i>dueña</i>."</p>

<p>"Two years!" repeated Andy blankly.</p>

<p>"Two years," said Ramón firmly. "All that time you are what is
call <i>novio</i>; and some of that time you must live in the
household of the papá of the esweetheart, and you must work for him
if he wants you to. And then there's a lot more things to do. And
then maybe you get marry."</p>

<p>"But say&mdash;look here&mdash;two years!" Andy's face was so
eloquent of his dismay that the Riveras burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"I have told him what is customary for the <i>novio</i>," Ramón
explained in Spanish, They enjoyed Andy's evident discomfiture. But
Doña Engracia's kind heart would not permit her to prolong the
joke. It need not be so long in this case. As Andy was a foreigner,
Don Sylvestre had, after consideration, decided that the full
rigidity of the etiquette might be softened, especially in view of
all that had already happened. But some concession must be made to
the dignity of convention.</p>

<p>"How long?" asked Andy.</p>

<p>"Six months," said Don Sylvestre.</p>

<p>The statement was obviously final. Carmel smiled ruefully at
Andy. The child Faquita was still scornful.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>SIX months seemed at first a long time; but they passed, and
they proved to be not entirely barren. To be sure, the rule as to
the mamá or the <i>dueña</i> was rigidly enforced; but there were
many things to do. The ranch life interested Andy. He found he was
able to carry forward certain plans and preparations for the life
he was to lead. Some of these took him away from Carmel for various
periods; but her absence was partly compensated by the fact that he
was doing things for her.</p>

<p>Thus, after long consultations with Don Sylvestre and Ramón and
his brothers, it was decided that the new household should
establish itself on some of the unclaimed lands up the valley. They
made an excursion on horseback to look them over. It turned out to
be quite an expedition. Besides Don Sylvestre and his four sons and
Andy were Panchito and two other <i>vaqueros</i> to take care of
the horses, and three servants to cook and make camp. At the last
minute the courtly moon-faced Benito joined them uninvited.</p>

<p>"These others know the grass and the range for the cattle,
<i>señor</i>," he told Don Sylvestre, "but as for the soil and the
frost and the sun, they do not know enough of these things to break
a plate. For the honor of the Riveras, <i>señor</i>, it must not be
said that we have placed the daughter of our house where she must
eat only meat and the fruit of the cactus. I go to select the
<i>milpas</i>."</p>

<p>"And how will your own <i>milpas</i> survive your absence,
Benito?" teased Ramón.</p>

<p>"That is in the hands of the saints, <i>señor</i>," replied
Benito piously. "Also I have carefully beaten each one of <i>los
Indios</i> that they may be heated to vigilance; for it is well
known, <i>señor</i>, that flies do not seek a boiling pot!"</p>

<p>He rode, far in the rear, on a mule; and seemed placidly
indifferent to the indignity.</p>

<p>They picnicked through the country for five days before they
found what they wanted, in the rolling oak-grown hills a few
leagues from the Mission of Nuestra Señora de la Soledad. There
were green lands, and brush-covered foothills, and eroded deep
<i>barrancas</i> with living streams, and a semicircle of brooding
dark mountains. Wide meadows spread flat between the hills. On
them, spaced apart, were great white oaks, their branches bare at
this time of year, in which perched thousands upon thousands of
band-tailed pigeons whose rising was as the roar of a waterfall.
Benito shook his head and knit his brows, already worried as to the
defense of a garden not yet begun. There were a great many of these
flats, elliptical in shape, bordered by low hills whose sides were
aromatic with sage, in which called multitudes of quail, and whose
bare tops waved high with rich grasses. An ideal cattle country
with dry and wet season ranges, and here the grounds for the
<i>rodeo</i>, and there for <i>matanzas</i>. Benito grubbed about
in one of the flats and found the soil good. He was much flattered
and pleased that Andy spent so much time in his company. Indeed,
for two days, after the general situation had been decided, Andy
devoted himself to Benito.</p>

<p>"You know more about the cattle business than I," he told his
hosts.</p>

<p>Andy's boyhood was stirring in his blood. The intervening years
of adventure had cleared away the early complexes born of his
stepfather's harsh treatment. He had been raised as a farm boy. His
ideas were expanding beyond Benito's <i>milpas</i>; though he had
every intention of raising as great a variety as possible of both
fruits and vegetables. But there seemed to him other possibilities.
Some of this soil looked to him like grain land&mdash;wheat,
barley, rye. Grapes ought to do well, if the sage could be grubbed
from the side hills. And he would not plow with a sharp stick,
either! He made a mental note to request Captain Barclay to bring
back proper plows. His mind once started on this train of thought,
he was reminded of other similar desirabilities. He began a list.
He did not speak of these ideas to anyone but Benito.</p>

<p>They returned to the <i>hacienda</i>, and messengers rode back
and forth to Monterey; and after a time Andy found himself duly
entitled to five leagues of land. Figueroa made no difficulty in
the grant. Things had settled down politically, and the governor
knew his policy had won. For a time he favored foreign colonization
of the skilled sort, being especially eager for settlers possessed
of mechanics or the crafts. On their return from Monterey, after
completion of the legal formalities, Andy and his Californian
friends found John Price waiting. He was welcome; but it instantly
developed that he had not come as a guest. Price was a sturdy and
independent character who refused to be beholden or to disguise a
purely business visit. He had decided he wanted to stay in the
country, and before going to Monterey he wished to consult Andy's
friends as to procedure.</p>

<p>"Why, I think the governor will make no difficulty," said Don
Sylvestre, "provided this man can show the governor he is valuable.
What can he do?"</p>

<p>"Do?" said Price, when this was translated. "Oh, a good many
things."</p>

<p>"The governor, I think, does not want many things,'" said Don
Sylvestre shrewdly. "What can he do that no one now here can
do?"</p>

<p>This rather stumped John for a moment.</p>

<p>"Doggone!" said he to Andy, "what kin I do? I reckon they don't
need Injun fighters or beaver trappers. I tell you: I can make
shingles."</p>

<p>Andy had no Spanish word for this, so he repeated it in
English.</p>

<p>"Tzn-tzn-tzngles?" said Don Sylvestre. "And what is that?"</p>

<p>Andy tried to explain; but succeeded none too well. "Well," said
the <i>hacendado</i> sensibly, "let him make some tzngles and we
shall see."</p>

<p>John was furnished Indians, <i>carretas</i>, whatever he
desired. He contrived himself a serviceable froe; he made an
excursion to the near-by mountains in search of straight grained
pine. In due course he returned with a load of very serviceable
shakes. Don Sylvestro was as delighted as a child with a new toy,
once the use of the new roof covering was demonstrated on some of
the smaller outbuildings. This was something nobody else had. He
wanted more tzngles; and it is probable he might even have ripped
from the roof of the <i>casa</i> its beautiful and serviceable red
tiles had not Andy begged Price as overseer of construction for his
own new buildings.</p>

<p>These were rapidly taking shape on the site he had selected for
them between the confluence of two streams atop a low rounded hill
on which grew several magnificent spreading live oaks. Contrary to
custom and against the earnest wish of all but Carmel, he insisted
on preserving these trees. He saw no sense in cutting them out, of
clearing bare the immediate surroundings after the fashion of all
the Californian ranch houses. The habit had probably originated as
a measure of defense in the early days, and had been continued
senselessly ever since until it had become a convention. So the new
adobe structures, crowned with John Price's tzngles, spread widely
and comfortably beneath leafy branches in which birds fluttered and
sang. They took shape rapidly; as did all the necessary corrals and
irrigation ditches and the other multifold appurtenances of a
proper establishment; for there were many hands employed. Indeed,
the regular business of the <i>hacienda</i> must have suffered. Its
own labor was certainly pared down to the absolutely necessary
minimum. Horsemen and <i>carretas</i> wore a deep road between the
<i>hacienda</i> and the new <i>rancho</i>; between the
<i>hacienda</i> and Monterey. Captain Barclay was astounded at the
sudden and varied demands on his cargo, especially for small nails.
He did not know about the tzngles.</p>

<p>The regular labor of the <i>hacienda</i> at last was almost at a
standstill. Its <i>vaqueros</i> drove in cattle from somewhere.
They disappeared for a week to return with a great taking of wild
horses from the valley. Andy would have liked to have a part in
this expedition, but he could not be spared; so Ygnacio Rivera went
instead. That kind of hunting must have been fun. They waited at
the watering places and rode the animals down, riding without
saddle for swiftness' sake, with a loose rawhide surcingle to which
to attach the reata. When caught, the wild horses were tied
together in pairs, the easier to drive them home. They were then
thrown in with tame stock and handled until they had been
accustomed. Where the tame stock came from Andy was never quite
sure; nor the bands of cattle that seemed continually to be
drifting in under charge of strange <i>vaqueros</i>, who sometimes
remained for a time to familiarize the beasts with their new range,
and sometimes rode away again at once. The whole affair seemed to
have gathered a momentum that swept it beyond his understanding. He
never paid anybody anything; he never signed any papers; he never
knew whether or not he had anybody to thank. It was out of his
hands. At first he tried to get some information; protested
vigorously. He was assured it was all tight. In due time the
business end of it would be arranged. He hoped profoundly that
someone was keeping track of all this. He was just a little
frightened at times, for he could not even begin to guess how deep
his obligations were getting to be. Ramón, cornered, gave him only
the vaguest satisfaction.</p>

<p>"The cattle?" said he. "Why, they are for make you the beginning
for the <i>rancho</i>. You must have about two thousand horses and
about fifteen thousand cow before you are <i>ranchero</i>."</p>

<p>"But where do they come from? Whom do I pay?" insisted Andy.</p>

<p>"Some come from the mission; some from the <i>hacienda</i>; some
come from the other <i>rancho</i> where are friend of the
Riveras&mdash;and also of you, Don Largo. You do not pay for heem.
After five year you give heem back. By that time they breed you so
many you have enough of your own."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," said Andy.</p>

<p>"Why, these&mdash;they just lend them to you," said Ramón. He
seemed incapable of understanding that this amounted after all to
an outright gift of the increase.</p>

<p>"But they get them all back," insisted Ramón. "What is lend a
few cow? If someone ask you to borrow a few cattle, you would
surely not refuse!"</p>

<p>In the same way, it seemed, most of the labor that swarmed to
the construction had been "borrowed"&mdash;the Indians from the
missions, the <i>vaqueros</i> from the other <i>ranchos</i> round
about. Ramón failed to see any great obligation in this.</p>

<p>"They work anyway," said he. "What difference whether they work
here or somewhere else?"</p>

<p>Andy gave it up. The whole thing had passed out of his hands. He
made one last despairing effort.</p>

<p>"But how do I know to whom I am to return these 'borrowed'
cattle and horses?" he demanded. "I ought to keep a list. How do I
keep track?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that all right," Ramón assured him comfortably. "You don't
have to keep track. Each one will remember all right, and will tell
you when it is time."</p>

<p>Benito was in his glory. He had a small army of "borrowed"
Indians at his disposal, and he utilized them in constructing the
irrigation ditches and checks of a super-<i>milpas</i>. Andy had
discovered that the <i>Petrel</i> carried a number of plows
destined for Hawaii, and these he had managed to buy. After the
<i>milpas</i> had been turned over, he continued the cultivation
over the broad flat. Here was something he himself could boss. It
was a refuge to him for his sense of independence. Here he intended
to sow a crop of wheat and barley. Nobody but Benito seemed even
interested. But Benito was a comfort. He seemed to be the only one
who understood the significance or the possibilities. At first he
was doubtful. The cattle, the wild game would be sure to destroy
the crop. <i>Vaqueros</i> could not keep them out, barring a
day-and-night watch, which was not practicable. There were no
fencing materials within many miles.</p>

<p>"There are Indians, many of them, right here, Benito," returned
Andy. "You shall see."</p>

<p>He set the Indians to digging a ditch, so wide and so deep, that
it must prove an effective barrier. Benito was filled with
admiration. His last doubts vanished.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>ANDY saw comparatively little of Carmel. He could not make out
whether he liked this or not. The <i>dueña</i> business was most
embittering to a young man of Andy's direct temperament. Some might
get satisfaction in polite and stilted speeches with such
surreptitious side glances of adoration as occasion permitted. But
not Andy. And not Carmel, who was naturally a rebel against
conventions.</p>

<p>At times it seemed to Andy that he would almost rather not see
her at all; and he welcomed the hours of business which took him so
much from the <i>hacienda</i>. But as soon as he was out of her
sight he wanted to see her again. He was constantly inventing
errands that none could do but himself; so that the size of the
<i>remuda</i> necessary to keep him in horseflesh was a joke. Ramón
was unsympathetic.</p>

<p>"You are very lucky," he told Andy, "for you wait six month
only, and already three are pass. I have still the year to wait,
me."</p>

<p>"I think it's all damn foolishness!" cried Andy angrily. "Don't
they think I can be trusted?"</p>

<p>Ramón opened his eyes wide. "But, <i>valedor</i>, me, I would
consider it not a compliment at all that one should think <i>I</i>
could be trusted! No, no-no!"</p>

<p>Not that the condition of affairs outlined above was unbroken:
By no means. That would indeed have been out of character with the
whole spirit of the people. Andy's impatience sometimes thought
there were more holidays than working days, and all of them must be
celebrated. Andy hoped they had a good time. He spent them on the
road, arriving at the <i>hacienda</i> toward sunset, and leaving
again the next morning at dawn. Nobody but Carmel could see any
sense in the way he drove himself. She understood. Ramón thought he
did.</p>

<p>"But you are too fierce, <i>amigo</i>," he expostulated, "too
<i>serio</i>, These other now will do the work all right without
you. Juan Price is there. Better you walk with me and talk with the
<i>mozas</i> who make wash the clothes."</p>

<p>But Andy was single hearted; a one-woman man, incapable of the
lighter relaxations so natural to one like Ramón. Indeed, he did
not even comprehend what Ramón was driving at; so Ramón shrugged
and gave it up.</p>

<p>"It seems," he confided to Panchito's wife, "that for a time I
must resign myself to madness."</p>

<p>"It were better if you were touched with a little of that
madness yourself," said the privileged Vicenta.</p>

<p>Ramón shrugged again. "I like better the ass that carries me
than the horse that throws me," said he. Like all Californians, he
would make Conchita a model husband&mdash;when the time came.</p>

<p>From time to time small parties of the trappers, encamped for
the winter at San Juan Bautista, drifted through the
<i>hacienda</i> on sightseeing tours. Andy heard of them, but for a
time his visits did not coincide with theirs. Some of them left
messages for him. He fully intended to ride over to San Juan, but
somehow never quite got around to it. The iron grip of impatient
circumstance held him. He was spiritually tight-muscled, driven
inexorably in a groove, incapable of letting go. Of course, he
wanted to see them all; would do so&mdash;<i>mañana</i>&mdash;.
After all, Andy had no intimates of old days among these men. Most
of them he had never heard of at all. Nevertheless, they were his
people, his kind. He would surely find time to ride over there
shortly. Something always came up to prevent. By chance he was at
the <i>hacienda</i> when Joe Walker and Zenas Leonard passed
through. He had a satisfactory evening with them. He felt better
after it. The mountain men appeared to understand perfectly; to be
mildly envious of his good fortune. Andy sent messages by them.</p>

<p>When the weather settled, along toward spring, the women, in
<i>carretas</i> and on horseback, journeyed to the new
<i>rancho</i>, where they camped out in such of the buildings as
were completed. This was better. Though the <i>dueña</i> idea was
unrelaxed, Andy and Carmel had now something they could talk about,
could do, in common, It was no longer necessary to sit stiffly in
chairs and utter platitudes. They could plan things. They were
enabled at least to press closer against the invisible inflexible
barrier that separated them. For a week Andy almost had a good
time. Then Doña Engracia announced that they must return. She shook
her head in smiling denial of Andy's pleading.</p>

<p>"But the home now is all prepared," she pointed out, "and there
is still much to do at <i>la casa</i>. And I think you have not yet
thought of <i>las doñas</i>. Is it not so? Then I think you must go
to Monterey."</p>

<p>"<i>Las doñas</i>?" repeated Andy.</p>

<p>"I think you may ask Ramón," said Doña Engracia.</p>

<p>Ramón was chagrined that his friend had not thought of, had not
known of las doñas; he was even more chagrined that he had himself
overlooked the matter.</p>

<p>"But always that is the business of the <i>novio</i>!" he cried,
"always! always!"</p>

<p>Andy learned that though of course the bride would come to him
well equipped with trousseau&mdash;had the confounded women been
doing anything but sew, he wondered?&mdash;nevertheless, certain
articles must, by rigid convention, be furnished by the groom. They
must ride to Monterey, where such things could be procured from
whatever ship happened to be in the harbor. Or if there were no
ship, then from the <i>padres</i> of the mission, who kept a
certain store of such things; though, as the excellent fathers were
shrewd and expected a goodly profit, that was more expensive. They
set out at once to remedy the oversight. The <i>Petrel</i> had not
yet sailed. Captain Barclay knew exactly what was required, and he
and Ramón and Phelps, the supercargo, took Andy's purchases in
charge.</p>

<p>So he bought one black and one white mantilla, and a piece of
fine lace, three bright-colored Roman sashes, a comb of shell bound
with gold, a rosary of amethysts, a necklace of topaz, a string of
pearls from Baja California. "How big is your girl?" asked
Phelps.</p>

<p>"How big?" repeated Andy.</p>

<p>"Yeh; how big around?"</p>

<p>He was rummaging in a chest and now produced an armful of
garments. Ramón was laughing at Andy's expression.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want the finest?" Phelps asked. "We've got
others." He laid out on the transom, in a row, a number of
<i>camisas</i>, fine as cobweb, transparent, trimmed with lace.</p>

<p>"Take your pick," said he. "There's different sorts and
different sizes."</p>

<p>Andy stared at the dainty garments. He had never dreamed of
anything quite like them. He turned helplessly to Ramón.</p>

<p>"No, you must pick them," said Ramón, "it is ver' bad luck if
anyone pick those but yourself."</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>ANDY never knew how it happened; but suddenly the time of the
wedding was at hand. The months had seemed interminable; he had
been caught in an acquiescence of time that could never end. And it
had ended! He came to realization of the fact belatedly, as one
comes into daylight around the corner of a tunnel, almost with a
sense of panic. There were so many things he had intended to do.
Time had been too long: now it was too short. He had not even
fulfilled his intention of a visit to the mountain men at San Juan
Bautista. What must they think of him! What must he think of
himself! He hastened to send a messenger with an urgent invitation
to attend.</p>

<p>Andy seemed to himself to have entered a dream world of which he
was a part and yet a spectator. He moved and spoke and saw; and yet
at the same time he lived in a suspension of reality. People
gathered, as for the <i>fiesta</i>, people, people, and yet more
people. He knew them and greeted them and saw them do things, and
did things himself with an appearance of competence and
intelligence, but only a smaller portion of himself seemed to be
involved. They had a feast. They had ceremonies of some sort.
Through Ramón the <i>doñas</i> were formally presented, and
unwrapped, and laid out for the admiration of all. All but those
blessed cobwebby camisas. These Ramón had laid aside. Andy came to
for a moment of relief. But shortly after he was made to pack the
things in rose leaves and himself to bear them to the bride as the
final gift, and everybody applauded decorously. Carmel was
beautiful, her cheeks bright with color. Faquita stood at her side,
very dignified, but in obvious excitement. Andy's mind played him
tricks. He caught himself wondering how the things would fit; then,
fantastically, whether the whole performance were not some kind of
a nightmare joke for his embarrassment; and incongruously there
flashed across his mind a solitary camp he had once made high in a
hanging meadow beneath the cold austere peaks of the Grand Tetons,
and a longing for that camp that lasted but an instant until Carmel
gave him her eyes in a trust and worship that emptied his heart
toward her.</p>

<p>Then everybody was drinking wine; and there were a number more
of confused happenings; and it was starlight, and the
<i>hacienda</i> was settled in slumber.</p>

<p>Ramón came to him at dawn; and a <i>moza</i> with chocolate.</p>

<p>He was assisted to dress in his gayest garments. When the two
young men emerged into the gray first light of day he found to his
surprise the space before the <i>casa</i> crowded. Everybody, old
and young, was there. Panchito led up Ramón's "silver" horse, the
<i>palomino</i>. It was bridled in silver; and bore a carved and
silver saddle with a pillion of broad aprons embroidered with
colored silks and silver and gold, around whose edges depended a
string of alternating pendants and little plates of polished steel.
Panchito held the <i>palomino</i> by the bits. Carmel appeared, and
Andy's heart stopped, then raced tumultuously. She was all in
white, with a high comb in her hair and over it draped a mantilla
of finest lace. She mounted a horse before the old gentleman who,
Andy understood, was her godfather. He himself took before him in
the saddle a dignified elderly lady whose name he did not know, but
who, he was told, was godmother to the bride. They rode down the
slope of the hill across the plain; and after them slowly paced a
long, colorful procession: on horseback; in <i>carretas</i> gayly
decorated with colored coverlets, with silk kerchiefs and ribbons,
with branches and flowers; the humbler even afoot, so that at last
the <i>hacienda</i> was left deserted by every living thing but the
chickens and the dogs.</p>

<p>The sun crept over the mountain rim; the mists of the
bottomlands melted. No one spoke. Only the subdued shrieking of the
<i>carretas</i>, especially greased with soap for the occasion, and
the songs of the meadowlarks, and the soft fall of hoofs broke the
silence, a silence, however, embroidered with the golden thread of
distant mission bells.</p>

<p>And then, without intermission of journey or distance, as it
seemed to Andy, they were dismounting before the grim and
fortress-like structure dedicated to Nuestra Señora de la Soledad.
Things happened like that: one moment here, the next moment there,
at a leap, without time interval. Then next Andy was kneeling
before the altar and Carmel beside him; and the stir and rustle of
decorous multitudes back there in the incense-blued dimness; and
before him shining spiritual as the moon the benign and lovely face
of Father Seria. To right and left stood Faquita, Conchita de la
Cuesta, Ygnacio and Felipe Rivera. They placed about the necks of
the couple a silk tasseled cord&mdash;there were things
said&mdash;there was music sounded&mdash;the newly married pair
were standing before the doorway in the brilliant sunlight, and
there was a great burst of musketry and shouting, and lively music
struck up, and friendly people crowded about.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>AS THE couple emerged from the doorway of the church Andy came
to a definite focus of his surroundings. It was as though he
awakened from automatism. He looked about him in recognition of the
company with a certain surprise. Alvarado was there&mdash;he did
not remember to have seen Alvarado before; though the
<i>político</i> must have been present all the time. And Captain
Barclay of the <i>Petrel</i> had made the journey from Monterey to
see married his countryman and the daughter of his old friend. And
young Carlos Lugo, who had composed the song of Don Largo&mdash;and
many another of Andy's acquaintance whom now he greeted as though
he saw them for the first time. But he looked in vain for the
mountain men, Joe Walker's party, and a little pang shot through
the brightness of the occasion. He reproached himself belatedly for
his neglect of them.</p>

<p>All the company were mounting their horses. Andy found that on
the return journey from the church he was to take Carmel before him
on the saddle. As he sprang to the pillion behind her, she leaned
back for an instant against his chest in a quick birdlike pressure
of caress, then straightened to the grave and ceremonial dignity
that befits the bride. Across the flower-starred plains the
colorful procession moved. A little group of young men with musical
instruments playing gay and lively airs preceded them for a few
miles; then fell back to give place to others who converged on them
from concealments in the willows along the route.</p>

<p>But, it proved, the objective was not the <i>hacienda</i>, as
Andy had thought it would be; but a smaller <i>rancho</i> nearer at
hand; a rude affair of adobe, with hardened earth floors, but
dignified for the moment with the beautiful hospitality of its
owners. Here all dismounted. The horses were led aside by the
<i>mozos</i>. Carmel disappeared within, in company with her little
sister and Conchita. The company sipped wine and ate little cakes,
chattered and laughed. Strangers were brought forward to shake
Andy's hand.&mdash;A very gorgeous, fiercely moustached person in
gold-laced cocked hat and strapped trousers bent stiffly before him
and made a little speech. Andy gathered that this was the personal
representative of the governor, Figueroa. Everybody was very gay,
very kind. Don Sylvestre did not leave his side. The old
<i>hidalgo</i> said nothing; and stood very erect, very dignified,
very much the grandee. But from time to time, almost
surreptitiously, he patted Andy on the arm. Doña Engracia, too,
hovered near, smiling at him gently, her eyes misty. Andy's heart
swelled within him.</p>

<p>Ramón touched him on the elbow.</p>

<p>"She is prepare," he whispered. "Come."</p>

<p>Together they entered the little ranch house. Carmel had changed
from the pearly loveliness of the wedding garments to a riding
costume. From beneath the wide straw hat, with its half-concealing
sun cloth, her eyes stared wide and solemn, a little frightened.
She looked more of a child than did the little girl standing at her
side. An uprush of tenderness filled his throat. He swept her into
his arms and kissed her on the mouth.</p>

<p>For the briefest instant she clung to him, then pushed him away
with a gasp. Faquita was staring at him with horrified eyes.
Conchita uttered a small shocked exclamation. But Ramón uttered a
crow of delight.</p>

<p>"<i>Holá</i>!" he cried. "This it is to be <i>americano</i>! I
think I shall be <i>americano</i> myself!"</p>

<p>He made as though to seize Conchita; and laughed at her
scandalized expression.</p>

<p>"But come; the day moves, and it is far to go. If you would
arrive before sunset, you must go."</p>

<p>"Far?" repeated Andy, for the <i>hacienda</i> was a scant three
leagues distant.</p>

<p>Ramón surveyed him in comic despair.</p>

<p>"This one has not heard one word of what I have told him two,
yes, three times!" he complained. "Do you mean to tell me that you
do not know that yet, today, you must ride to your <i>rancho</i>?"
he inquired with elaborate patience.</p>

<p>"No," confessed Andy sincerely. "Did you tell me that?"</p>

<p>"Did I tell you that!" Ramón mimicked him. "Where else should
you pass this, your first night? At the <i>hacienda</i>, I suppose,
where shall be the music and the dancing all the night through? You
think you like that better, eh? If you do, I think you're very
funny. Where have you been all this time I have talked to you?
Asleep?"</p>

<p>Andy grinned a little shame-facedly; then sobered. "Yes," he
said, "I think I have been asleep. All my life I have been asleep.
I have but now awakened."</p>

<p>He looked steadily at Carmel. She made a little impulsive
movement toward him. Their eyes clung together.</p>

<p>They went outside. Panchito held three horses by the bridle. One
of them was the <i>palomino</i>. Ramón took the reins of this
animal and placed them in Andy's hand.</p>

<p>"This is my gift to you," said he simply. "No, no-no," he
answered the trouble in Andy's eyes. "Heart of my heart, how can I
give you less than the dearest of my possessions? He will bear you
well, for in all the Californias there is not another like him.
Kiss me, <i>valedor</i>."</p>

<p>Andy kissed him, before them all, and felt no Anglo-Saxon
shame.</p>

<p>They mounted. There was a moment's pause.</p>

<p>Andy looked from one to the other of their friendly faces. His
eyes stopped on the figure of the child, standing near his stirrup.
It seemed to him a little forlorn. On a sudden impulse he leaned
over and raised her bodily from the ground, pressing her close to
him and kissing her on the cheek.</p>

<p>"Now you are my little sister, remember!" he whispered, and set
her down again.</p>

<p>Her face was shining.</p>

<p>Don Sylvestre raised his hand. They bowed their heads. He
blessed them. Doña Engracia was crying softly. They rode away down
the slope. Panchito followed. The people fluttered their hands.</p>

<p>"Go with God!" they cried. "Go with God!"</p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>THERE is no more beautiful landscape in the world than one of
the California valleys in spring. There is no more ecstatic
experience than to ride through them with one beloved. There are
few more satisfactory experiences than security after danger; calm
after storm; repose after stress. Andy rode the <i>palomino</i> in
body, but clouds of ecstasy in spirit. And yet through that ecstasy
ran one little thread of uneasiness. Andy periodically forgot what
it was, but it lay beneath the surface of consciousness as an
influence. He wished the mountain men&mdash;some of them, at
least&mdash;had come to his wedding. He wished he himself had not
been so self-absorbed. In his present great happiness this regret
had little power: it merely represented a missing ingredient to
perfection. Carmel noticed the shadow that flitted across the
depths of his eyes. Andy must tell her; and in the telling
discovered himself just a little hurt. Carmel did not try to combat
or deny the feeling.</p>

<p>"We now have each other, <i>querido</i>," she said simply. "What
else matters?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Andy fervently; but deep within was the small
remote pain, like a pin prick, or a burr, that one can ignore, but
which nevertheless persists.</p>

<p>They traveled slowly; that is, according to Californian
standards, cantering for a mile or so at a time, then falling to
the steady shuffling Spanish trot. They were wholly absorbed in one
another. It was Panchito who spurred alongside respectfully to call
attention to a strange cavalcade surmounting a hill a quarter mile
or so to their left. They pulled their horses to a halt.</p>

<p>"What is it, <i>querido</i>?" asked Carmel, a little
breathless&mdash;"robbers?"</p>

<p>Andy shook his head, unable to answer. After a moment he found
his voice. "The mountain men," he shouted joyously.</p>

<p>"I am a little frightened," confessed Carmel. "They look so
wild!"</p>

<p>Andy laughed, and in his laughter there was a lilt of pride.</p>

<p>"I was exactly like that when I came to California," said
he.</p>

<p>"If they are like you, then I am not frightened," said
Carmel.</p>

<p>Their hands stole together and clasped briefly with quick
pressure.</p>

<p>The mountain men were riding in single file, slowly, with great
dignity. Their winter's sojourn in San Juan Bautista had added
considerable delightful foofaraw, but their sturdy independence had
refused to alter fundamentals. Indeed, a considerable number of the
more conservative-minded had made no alterations at all, but rode
in full buckskins, their heads bound in handkerchiefs, their long
rifles across their saddles. These were the old-timers, long
haired, shaven faced, the <i>hivernants</i> of already vanishing
days. But among the bearded newcomers here and there gleamed a bit
of color from <i>serape</i> or sash, or bobbed a <i>sombrero</i>
with tinsel band, or glittered the silver of Spanish spur or
bridle. They paid no attention whatever to Andy's eager shout of
welcome, but came steadily on, their faces expressionless.</p>

<p>George Parker rode at their head. He shook Andy gravely by the
hand.</p>

<p>"Good luck to you, Andy," said he. He bowed, a little awkwardly,
to Carmel, eyeing her flushed face with veiled curiosity and
admiration. "Howdy, Missus Burnett," said George. "You got ye a
good man."</p>

<p>He reined his horse aside to give way to the next behind him.
One by one they passed before the bridal couple, austere, silent,
grave. Each clasped Andy's hand; each made his bow to Carmel. It
was a ceremony, a serious ceremony. Except for the curt greetings
and the formal good wishes, no other word was spoken. They sat
their horses unsmiling, like graven images.</p>

<p>But after the last horseman had made his bow, the formality
broke. George Parker, and a few of the bolder men who had known
Andy in the Rockies, crowded about the pair. The rest chatted low
voiced to one another covertly devouring the Spanish girl with
their eyes.</p>

<p>"We figgered to cut you off about here," said George.</p>

<p>"Had to see you and wish you luck, Andy."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come to the wedding?" Andy wanted to know.
"Didn't you get my message?"</p>

<p>"We got the message, all right," said George, "and much
obleeged. We did think some of coming; but the boys talked it over,
and we figgered we wouldn't do you too proud with your new people,
and mebbe we'd better not."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" cried Andy heatedly. "I reckon my friends are good
enough for anybody."</p>

<p>"I reckon ary American's good enough for ary of these
yere&mdash;" began Parker in cool level tones; then bethought
himself that these were now Andy's people and broke off. "It wasn't
that, Andy," said he, "but we figgered if we went to the
celebration we'd shore git drunk."</p>

<p>They talked for a little time. Andy urged them strongly to ride
on with him to the new <i>rancho</i>. Parker grinned and shook his
head. "We'll ride with you a little spell," said he, "but we ain't
goin' to hang around no bride and groom."</p>

<p>"I'd like you to see my place," persisted Andy. "You can camp in
the bottom of the creek, if you insist; and we can kill a beef,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We seen your place," George interrupted him. "We rode up thar
yisterday for a look-see. She's a fine place. No, we got to be
gittin' back. Cap'n Walker aims to pull out. He'd a-come himself,
but he's busy gittin' a good ready. Told me to tell you."</p>

<p>They set their horses in motion and the strange procession
proceeded for a mile or so on its way. Then Parker called a
halt.</p>

<p>"Do they go?" Carmel inquired. "Tell them this, Andres
<i>mío</i>, that always our house is theirs, and that sometime they
must come."</p>

<p>"Tell the missus much obleeged," said Parker, when this was
translated, "and we, some of us, may take her up and glad to. We
like this kentry. And now, reckon we must be leavin' you. So long,
Andy. Be good to yourself. Raise you lots of cows, and don't fergit
to throw in a few young 'uns while yo're about it. <i>Adiós</i>,
Missus Burnett. You shore picked you a fine gal, Andy. Come on,
boys, let's git moving."</p>

<p>They turned off the trail, amid a chorus of farewells. Andy
watched them go. His eyes were misted. Something in him was
accompanying them. It tugged at his heart.</p>

<p>On the skyline they stopped, raised their long rifles at arm's
length. A scattering volley rang out. The skyline was empty.</p>

<p>Carmel's hand was on his arm. He wrenched his gaze from the
empty horizon to meet her eyes.</p>

<p>"I like them," she said. "They are strong. It is that which made
me love you, the strength and the wildness. So you must ever be.
Promise! Promise!"</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>THEY arrived at the <i>rancho</i> shortly after sunset. Three
more surprises awaited Andy. The house was lighted with candles.
The <i>vaqueros</i> and the Indians dressed in their best were
grouped in welcome. But there were old familiar faces as well. The
round-faced Benito stepped from the shadows to greet them; Vicenta,
the wife of Panchito. Andy was astonished. He thought to have seen
them among the wedding guests. That was true, they smiled at him;
but they had ridden fast. Vicenta on a horse! Benito on a horse;
for it was evident his beloved mule could never have made the
journey so quickly! Benito waved the matter aside disdainfully: it
was nothing. But Vicenta made a comical face and tried to conceal a
limp.</p>

<p>"I am to be of your household, señor," Benito smiled. "Don
Sylvestre has so arranged. And you shall see how the <i>milpas</i>
and the new fields of grain shall grow!"</p>

<p>Vicenta enveloped Carmel in a vast embrace.</p>

<p>"And I, <i>chiquita</i>!" she cried. "Is it not wonderful! To be
sure, there is that one!" she added with a scornful toss of the
head toward Panchito, whose carved brown face broke into a slow
smile.</p>

<p>"You too are with us, Panchito?" cried Carmel.</p>

<p>The <i>vaquero</i> nodded.</p>

<p>"Si, <i>señora</i>," he replied. "So the master has ordered.
And," he added, "for that I am very glad, for though it is said
that a little gall spoils much honey," he glanced side-wise at
Vicenta, "it is also true that the ox that tosses often throws one
into a better place."</p>

<p>Carmel's eyes were shining.</p>

<p>"Panchito first taught me to ride," she told Andy, "and Vicenta
to walk! And Benito! Benito," she repeated affectionately, "has
made me to love all things. Is it not wonderful?"</p>

<p>"Wonderful indeed," said Andy.</p>

<p>They entered the <i>sala</i> together, arm in arm. This was
their place, their very own. It was as yet new, crude, almost
unfurnished; but it was spacious, nobly proportioned. It awaited
its mellowing fulfillment of living; solid, substantial, enduring;
so that faintly, from the dimness of its shadows, whispered elfin
echoes of generations to be born. The <i>sala</i> of the
<i>hacienda</i> had seemed to be filled with the past; this with
the future. For a moment the pair stood in the doorway looking
about, Then Andy uttered a cry of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Where did that come from?" He turned to Vicenta, who stood
behind them, glowing with pride.</p>

<p>"That, <i>señor</i>," replied Vicenta, "the <i>señor</i> Juan
Price fashioned, before he left, as a gift to you."</p>

<p>By the window stood a rocking chair of the type known in the
East as the "Boston Rocker."</p>

<p>"Sit in it, Carmel," said Andy.</p>

<p>She flung aside her sun hat and did so; and began to rock,
gurgling joyously like a child, for rocking chairs were a novelty
in the California of that day. But shortly she looked up.</p>

<p>"What is it, <i>querido</i>?" she cried anxiously. "Why look you
thus? What is the matter?"</p>

<p>Andy aroused himself and smiled at her reassuringly. "Nothing is
the matter, dear one," said he. "My mind was remembering."</p>

<p>"Remembering what, <i>querido</i>?"</p>

<p>"Another woman who sat in just such a chair, by another window,
and rocked back and forth quickly just as you are doing now."</p>

<p>"Was she beautiful, this woman?" asked Carmel.</p>

<p>"Very beautiful," said Andy gravely. "She was a very great lady,
Carmel, and she loved me very much; so much that she gave me that
long rifle standing there against the wall and sent me away from
her forever."</p>

<p>Carmel had stopped rocking.</p>

<p>"And why did she do this, your so-beautiful one?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"That I might live true to my blood, she said; for my forebears
did great things in the wilderness. I too was to do great things."
Andy sighed. "I do not know&mdash;but it has brought me here; and
to you, darling."</p>

<p>But Carmel, continued to sit stiffly upright in the motionless
rocking chair.</p>

<p>"And you did never see her again?" she asked.</p>

<p>"She died, that very year."</p>

<p>"But still you love her?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" Andy was astonished for an instant, but swept on,
engrossed in a desire for sympathy in a thought he had never before
expressed, even to himself. "There have been times," he continued
almost bashfully, "times of danger, or when I had to make up my
mind&mdash;well, when things were really important, you
know&mdash;when it has seemed to me that I have felt her very near
me&mdash;or, not her, exactly, but her love&mdash;like a warm air
all about me." He gave it up hopelessly. "It must sound foolish to
you, sweetheart. It does to me as I say it. But it is as real as if
Grandmother were actually there." He stopped at the expression on
Carmel's face. "What is the matter, <i>querida</i>?"</p>

<p>"<i>Nada, nada</i>." Carmel choked a little, then laughed.</p>

<p>"You think I am foolish," said Andy.</p>

<p>"But no!" Carmel sprang to her feet and drew close to him. "See,
my head reaches just to your heart." She laid her cheek against his
chest and closed her eyes. "Hold me close, <i>querido</i>," she
murmured. They stood some moments in silence. She looked up at his
glowing eyes. "We are to be happy, you and I," said she with a
tremulous laugh. "You shall teach me to speak the English language,
and I&mdash;I shall teach you many things you do not know."</p>

<p>Simultaneously they became aware of Vicenta smiling in the
background and drew apart in a slight confusion.</p>

<p>"<i>Comida</i> is ready, when <i>señor-señora</i> desire to
eat," suggested Vicenta demurely.</p>

<p>"Presently, when we have washed," replied Carmel, with dignity.
"But what is this?"</p>

<p>She fluttered like a bird to the other end of the room where,
against the wall, and hitherto unremarked, stood a gay and
remarkable object. It was composed of beautiful aromatic
smoke-tanned buckskin, stretched over a light frame, ornamented
elaborately with beadwork, colored quills and little bells; a
wonderful piece of craftsmanship. Carmel examined it curiously, for
she could not guess its purpose.</p>

<p>"It is a baby basket," explained Andy, laughing, "such as the
Indians of the plains and the mountains use. The women carry it on
their backs."</p>

<p>"The <i>americanos</i> who were here left it as a gift for the
wedding," supplemented Vicenta. "They talked, but none spoke our
language. There is a paper," she pointed out.</p>

<p>Andy unfolded the paper.</p>

<p>"<i>We made this for you and the Missus</i>," Andy deciphered
the rude characters. "<i>See that you keep it bizzy, you old horny
toad</i>."</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p>THEY had eaten, and Vicenta had cleared away the dishes. After a
time. Andy extinguished the candles. The room fell into the silver
and black of moonlight patterned through the windows by the trees.
They talked little, overtaken by a sudden breathless shyness.</p>

<p>"It is very late," said Andy at last.</p>

<p>Carmel arose without reply and glided to the bedroom door.</p>

<p>"Wait here, <i>querido</i>, I will call," said she in a small
voice. Left alone, Andy stood, his back to the moonlit window,
thinking of many things. After a little he crossed the room to take
in his hands the long rifle, the old Boone gun. He carried it to
the fireplace, in which the dying embers glowed, and laid it gently
across the two pegs he had caused to be imbedded in the adobe of
the wall.</p>
