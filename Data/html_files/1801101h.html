<p class="first"><i>The news spread like wildfire: Hugh Rawson was
back in Klickitat! Three reasons brought him: He had to find the
coward who had ambushed him. He had to uncover the gang that had
made the trails unsafe for the precious gold shipments. And he had
to see for himself if his friend, George von Stern, had pirated his
claims on beautiful Evelyn Harvey. One wild night, with a quarter
of a million in gold in his stage, Hugh Rawson finds the answer to
all three!</i>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>PART 1.</h2>

<p class="first">AT the upper deck's railing Hugh Rawson watched
the <i>Annie Conser</i>'s bow swing shoreward to search for
Klickitat's landing stage. An ink-dense bluff rose behind the
river, crowding the town into a single street whose lights lay out
upon the water like the pickets of a yellow fence. Against the
night's enameled black, star masses made their foamy glittering and
the clear winds of spring blew lightly in from the empty reaches of
Eastern Oregon. In Portland, where he had spent a month abed, the
climate was a heavier and a sleepier thing; this mild air blowing
against him was the fragrant breath of a woman gladly whispering
him home.</p>

<p>Rawson lifted his carpetbag and took the forward stairs in a
sidewise manner to protect a left leg not yet dependable. He moved
ashore with this cautiousness, but in a moment his hustling habit
got the better of him and he put out a hand to make his way through
the crowd toward the Klickitat House standing fifty feet from the
river. He signed the register and went up the stairs and along a
dim hall to a room. There, he removed coat and shirt, unbuckled the
money belt around his hips, washed away the day's dirt, and dressed
again. His skin had the olive tint of an active man too long
indoors; his mouth was broad with small creases across its center
meatiness, his nose was heavy, his cheekbones were flat and high.
His face needed filling out and in fact he needed twenty more
pounds all about his body to bring him back to the hundred and
eighty pounds he had been. When he turned to the bed, he placed too
much weight on his left leg and woke its unhealed nerves. He
murmured, "Dammit," and drew his .44 with its holder and belt from
the carpetbag, but he laid it aside while he rummaged the bag for a
derringer. Cinching the money belt beneath his coat, he turned to
the lobby.</p>

<p>Both lobby and bar of the Klickitat were crowded. Klickitat was
a depot town; the boxes and barrels and bales of merchandise
dropped by steamboat at the landing were picked up and carried on,
eastward and south-eastward, to the mining camps far beyond the
Snake, along the Powder and the Malheur, into Boise Basin, over
flinty hills and through colored gorges into Central Oregon, to
solitary ranches on the high desert, to prospectors' settlements
ephemerally lodged beside the gravelly bars of the John Day.</p>

<p>A denied appetite came powerfully upon him and the rear view of
a familiar figure at the bar&mdash;a tremendously upholstered shape
within a shabby blue suit tailored like a square tent&mdash;drew him
forward. He created a place at the bar by shouldering Jake Mulvey
into a smaller area.</p>

<p>"Get my letter?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Mulvey, and used a finger to catch the barkeep's
eye. He smiled then; his mouth was benign and small and bride-red
behind the ragged screening of a mustache. He was at least
fifty-five, yet youngness seemed to have been permanently caught
within the preservative lard which padded him head and foot. He
looked at Rawson's leg.</p>

<p>"You're pushin' that too soon. You need a lot of feedin'.
How."</p>

<p>They drank and crossed the lobby to the dining room. Rawson saw
an empty table at a far corner; half over the room he heard his
name called and swung to catch sight of George von Stern at another
table&mdash;von Stern and Evelyn. He said to Mulvey, "Go on, I'll be
with you in a second," and made his way toward these two. Von Stern
got up and reached for Hugh's hand, and shook it thoroughly.</p>

<p>"Hughie, glad to see you&mdash;glad to. You all right?"</p>

<p>"Will be."</p>

<p>Evelyn said, "Don't ignore me."</p>

<p>The room's lamplight broke into brilliant splinters against her
eyes. Her hand closed firmly around his hand and her glance
searched him with a warming curiosity. Her lips were plush cushions
against her skin, placid but falsely so, for she was not a placid
woman. A yellow hat lay on hair which was the lightest possible
brown, and her dress was a rusty gold, if gold could rust, the
upper part of it cleverly broken and reshaped, she being the
dressmaker. She was a large girl with a pleasant composure, but a
contradictory vigor sparkled in her eyes and around her mouth a
restless charm fugitively hovered, waiting escape. She was a
light-loving woman, not calm, not cool; variety pleased her&mdash;the
unexpected changes and contrasts which variety brought.</p>

<p>"Your friends," she said, "intended to make a party and come to
Portland to see you, but the road out of Ophir's been so terrible."
She drew her hand away; her interest hung on. "Eat with us."</p>

<p>"Business with Mulvey."</p>

<p>"It's a fool question," said von Stern, "but have you got a
notion who shot you off the seat?"</p>

<p>Rawson swung his body back and forth. "Listen. Hear the hip
joint squeak? When I'm driving I won't know whether it's the coach
rattling or me."</p>

<p>He smiled at Evelyn and he brought her smile back. He watched it
grow and hold steady, and he tilted his head and seemed to observe
it from a distance; then he made a motion with his hand and turned
away. Evelyn watched him go between the crowded tables, slightly
limping, now and then touching a table to steady himself.</p>

<p>She said, "If that's permanent I'll never again think there's
anything kind in this world." She said it with a force that brought
von Stern's glance to her. He said, "I thought this might sober him
up. It didn't. He doesn't give a damn about anything."</p>

<p>The girl drew her glance from Rawson; she placed her hands on
the table and tipped her head. "Oh no," she said, the words
feather-soft, "he's changed. George, who'd hate him enough to shoot
him while he was driving? He doesn't have that kind of
enemies."</p>

<p>"They were after the express box."</p>

<p>"Could it have been a Piute?"</p>

<p>"An Indian's not interested in gold."</p>

<p>"Gold's a terrible thing," she said.</p>

<p>The color of von Stern's eyes, a thick coffee brown, was a rich
mud behind which his emotions lay well covered; even when they
reached surface they were never entirely free from a certain hint
of reserve. He had a grave and coppery face, he was rawboned and
strong-muscled with handsome and curled black hair always a little
tumbled about his head, and he dressed himself carefully and kept
himself shaved and groomed; a diamond ring, the great stone held in
a gold snake's-mouth mounting, circled the index finger of his left
hand. Softly speaking, he turned the diamond from side to side,
watching the imprisoned flame flash. "Gold can do anything, and men
will do anything for it. Greatest creator&mdash;greatest destroyer. I
know of nothing with its power, and power's what we all want."</p>

<p>Rawson said, "I'll ride to Head of the Mountain and take the
reins as before."</p>

<p>"Lay around a couple of weeks in Ophir and feed up," said
Mulvey.</p>

<p>"I'm going after that fellow."</p>

<p>"It was six weeks ago and the country's full of drifters and
there'd be no trace, unless you know who did it."</p>

<p>"I never saw him. He was behind a tree when he fired."</p>

<p>"Maybe he meant to fire a warning shot and hit you by
mistake."</p>

<p>"At twenty feet? Nobody can shoot that poor. And if it was just
the express box he wanted, he'd not shoot the driver and stampede
the coach to hell and gone down the road. Maybe he wanted the box,
but he wanted to kill me first. We'll be carrying a lot of dust out
of Ophir this year. He'll try again&mdash;same idea as he had
before&mdash;and I'll be on the box. Unless I catch him, he'll catch
me."</p>

<p>"Rough game," said Mulvey,</p>

<p>Rawson used a thumbnail to scratch lines back and forth upon the
tablecloth, closely watching the traveling of his hand and
searching for a thought that would stand fast long enough to be
captured by words. He was twenty-five, yet his face was the sort
that experience did not edge or harden and his eyes, exceedingly
blue, were tranquil. He shook his head. "This man's a pair of red
eyes watching me from the brush. He missed once, but he's prowling
and he'll try again. He's the same as telling me I'm not bright
enough to stay alive. I'm interested."</p>

<p>"You stayed in bed too long and thought too damned much. You
swallowed the hook. Wait till marbles start rollin' around your
belly and your eyeballs feel full of pitch and needles."</p>

<p>"I'll take back the run from Bart Lennon," said Rawson, "but I'd
like to use him for relief man when I want to prowl."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Mulvey. He sat back in the chair,
finger tips making a tepee before his eyes. He sighted across the
finger tips to Rawson. "Couple years ago we never had much trouble,
maybe a holdup or two, but nothing to worry about. I see it getting
worse. It's the old story. Soon as a camp shows up rich the bad
ones come from everywhere and the small crooks get together and
pretty soon you've got a gang with some smart fellow running it. I
think that's what we've got."</p>

<p>Leaving the dining room, Rawson noted that Evelyn and von Stern
had already gone. Mulvey said, "I'll see you in the morning," and
crossed the lobby while Rawson returned to the bar to buy himself a
supply of cigars. He lighted one and left the bar, intending to
settle his supper with a stroll along the town's main street.
Passing the parlor he looked in and saw Evelyn Harvey there, her
face to the lobby; she was alone.</p>

<p>He removed the cigar when he went in, holding it cupped in his
hand; he looked down and noticed the uncertainty around her mouth.
She made a small gesture and he settled himself and swung to face
her, and at that moment a sensation went through him, as leaves
would be lifted by a spiraling wind. She said, "I thought it would
be nice to get out of Ophir for a bit. George had to make a trip so
I just came along. But three days around here's enough. I'll be
glad to get back."</p>

<p>He stared at his cigar. A month in bed had lightened his hands
and had softened the calluses across his palms. It was clear that
she wanted him to know, as soon as possible, why she and George
were in town together. He raised his head and noticed how carefully
she watched his face. He nodded. It surprised him that she felt it
important to explain anything to him; she was old enough to run her
own life.</p>

<p>She pointed to the cigar. "You want to smoke that thing. Let's
walk." She took his arm and they passed into a street speckled with
yellow lamplight. He looked at her, his smile coming through the
spotty shadows. "Things been all right with you during the last
month?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "and it's nice you're interested. Wait a
moment."</p>

<p>She turned into a store. He thrust his hands into his pockets
and laid a shoulder against the doorsill, watching the inside
scene. The lights of the store, striking her bronze dress built up
a sparkling glow around her. She made her purchases and came out
and took his arm.</p>

<p>"Night's so lovely," she murmured, accommodating her pace to his
steady stepping. They followed this street until the shop lights
and the rough sounds of the town dropped back and the shadows of
outlying sheds came upon them, the streets becoming a road whose
ruts were deep as plow furrows.</p>

<p>"Pain's an awful thing," she said.</p>

<p>"After it goes away a curtain comes down and you can't bring
back how bad it was. Otherwise we'd all be cowards."</p>

<p>"It leaves something behind. Your voice isn't the same.
Neither's your smile."</p>

<p>"That's from lying in bed thinking too much. How's everybody?
How's Ad Carrico?"</p>

<p>"Somebody's got to talk to him."</p>

<p>"That again? Well, it's Easterline's wife, not mine."</p>

<p>"It's sad. Sad for all of them."</p>

<p>"I don't know who's wrong there, Ad or Beth Easterline."</p>

<p>"I'm not talking about anybody being wrong."</p>

<p>They turned and walked back toward the beginning of the sidewalk
and the first muddy stain of the town lamps. He halted and swung
her around, her arrested body becoming a slight weight pushing
against his hand. She was still, and smiling, and watchful.
"Somebody's got to be wrong," he said. "She made a bad bargain with
Easterline and you think she should keep it. That's the wise thing,
but she won't be wise. She knows it can't last, for Ad will be
transferred someday, but it's like dying&mdash;she won't die till she
must."</p>

<p>"If it's that serious," he said dryly, "maybe they'd better skip
the country together."</p>

<p>"He'd ruin his career as an Army officer no matter how they
worked it out."</p>

<p>He reached out with his other hand and now held her arms, trying
to catch sight of her expression through the shadows, still
receiving the mild inward insistence of her body. He dropped his
hands and saw her check herself and heard the quick trembling of
laughter in her throat. He laid his arms around her and she came in
at once, lifting her head until he saw the distinctness of her
smile; laughter seemed to bubble through her when he kissed her,
her palms lodged lightly on his shoulders and her mouth met his and
remained a moment and then fell away. She turned him and walked on
with him into the clearer glowing of the house lights. "Welcome
home, Hughie."</p>

<p>Later, alone in her room, she faced herself at the dresser's
mirror; she put her hands on the dresser top, bent forward, and
watched her features come back to her. Her lips were heavier, they
were like sponges slowly being saturated; her face was alive, not
simply pleasant but sharpened as though a stinging air had touched
it; the pupils of her eyes were large and had a heavy glow in them.
That was the face of a woman who had been roused too much, who
hoped for too much. He had no idea what he had done to her; at this
moment he was no doubt at the bar, amiably wasting his time with
other men, the scene forgotten.</p>

<p>But she couldn't blame him for not knowing something she herself
hadn't known. Corning to Ophir, the year before, she had met him
and had liked him, yet had not considered him to be more than a
careless, good-looking young man contented with his job. The rest
of it had grown without her knowledge until the time of his
accident. That, and his absence, had shocked her; the sight of him
walking into the dining room had made a greater effect on her than
she thought possible, and the fact that she deliberately waited for
him in the hotel parlor was a warning that something had happened
to her.</p>

<p>She swung from the mirror, restless and not at all happy. This
was too uncertain; it was bound to hurt. For, looking at von
Stern's friendship with her and her acceptance of it, Rawson had
acquired a certain wonder concerning her. He was courteous, but she
had felt its presence.</p>

<p>She moved to the window to let in night's cool sweet air and,
curious about all things, watched the night marshal trudge along
the block and turn the corner. At that corner George von Stern
stood before a little man who talked steadily, von Stern listening
with an occasional prompting nod. A thousand times, in Ophir she
had seen him in that attitude, dredging men for what they knew, and
as he repeated this scene she saw some small new thing to push her
closer to a final judgment of him. The solid strength which had
originally attracted her was, after better knowledge of him,
something else; and out of the quiet places of his nature, once
lending him a maturity and a mystery, came now the queer current of
hidden thoughts which troubled her. She had liked him for his
gallantry, his knowledge of the world, and his understanding of
her, and it was a sad thing to see that go. He had changed, and so
had she; and so had Rawson. Nothing remained the same.</p>

<p>Shaved and fed and cheerful, and a cigar fragrant between his
teeth, Rawson stepped into a chilled bright morning to find the
stage at the door of the Klickitat House, a shaken Concord coach
hitched to four half-wild horses surging against the harness. On
the driver's seat, Barney Rheinmiller held them in check with the
reins. Barney was a Dutchman with lumpy shoulders, stone grey eyes,
and a square face which had no more animation than tanned leather.
Sixty miles of road between Klickitat and Head of the Mountain was
a phenomenally exact picture in his mind, every bend and grade and
chuckhole and draw, and in the blackest night he read the road
shadows as other men read a printed page. He grinned down at
Rawson.</p>

<p>"Got a hole in your head so you come back to drivin'. Where's
the passengers?"</p>

<p>They came from the hotel&mdash;a drummer from Portland, Ack Trubo who
was a cattleman in Skull Valley, von Stern and Evelyn. The other
passengers entered the coach and Rawson climbed to the high seat.
Rheinmiller threw off the brakes and issued a rough shout which
exploded the horses into an immediate rushing run down the street;
the road bent around a corner&mdash;which the coach took with a violent
careening&mdash;and climbed the face of the bluff behind town.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the road reached the rim of the high country
and put gorge and river behind. Southward a seemingly unbroken
sagebrush plain rolled mile on mile toward the charcoal streak of
mountains, and across this the road pressed, two ruts furrowed foot
deep in an ashlight soil. The bright sun sailed up, sucking away
the morning's chill, and a lightly variable wind blew.</p>

<p>"Damned fine day," said Rheinmiller.</p>

<p>"Any day's fine if you can stand up to see it," said Rawson.</p>

<p>Rheinmiller sat in loose disregard for the constant careening of
the coach on its fore and aft straps; he cursed the individual
horses conversationally and kept them at a steady eight miles an
hour through the wriggling ruts. Rawson eased himself on a seat
which for him, after a month in bed, was hard as stone. The stage,
grumbling on at its maintained pace, wrote a straight line of dust
through the sunlight, it hanging motionless as far as the eye
reached. At Bird's, where the horses were changed, the last of the
settled country fell behind and the road plunged into drowning
space, pointed arrow straight at the mountains so vague in the
distance.</p>

<p>At four o'clock the road dipped into a lava break running like a
trough across the flats and came upon another roadhouse hidden
beneath the wind, and presently the new relay hurried the coach on
through late afternoon's changing light toward a visual
breakthrough point. The distant mountains took on solid shape and
moved gradually forward until at seven o'clock the desert broke
upon timbered foot slopes as sea breaks against headlands. The road
made its first turn in fifty miles and disappeared into tiers of
pine which rose into an enormous yonder ruggedness. A creek came
down from the heights, immediately to lose itself in the desert's
sucking earth; beside the creek, backed against the timber, sat
O'Fallen's roadhouse.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes behind," said Rheinmiller. "That Bessie mare
soldiered on me."</p>

<p>Rawson dropped from the coach to stamp life into his dull legs.
The passengers descended owl-sober and jaded, von Stern turning to
offer Evelyn his hand. She came lightly to the ground and looked at
once to the hills, her face quickened by the view of those hulking
heights. "Mountain change&mdash;I smell it." The house light briskly
flickered in her eyes. <i>Light, any kind of lights, sought her
out</i>, Rawson thought.</p>

<p>They entered the single room of the roadhouse and sat down to
supper. Rawson spoke to Evelyn. "That's a pretty dress."</p>

<p>"It's time you noticed."</p>

<p>"Not my business to notice," he said and lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>"It's every man's business to notice."</p>

<p>"Some man's, but not every man's."</p>

<p>Von Stern sat silent with his coffee, watching these two with
his withdrawn manner. The room's warmth, the ride, or the heaviness
of his thoughts seemed to have tired him. Now and then his glance
settled on Rawson. Evelyn touched his arm. "Hugh's making a speech
to me."</p>

<p>"Hope you understand it. I don't."</p>

<p>"I understand it," she said.</p>

<p>Barney Rheinmiller stacked coffee cup and saucer on his plate,
laid knife and fork over them, and left the table. "Anybody coming
with me, better come," he said.</p>

<p>Evelyn rose and walked from the room, followed by von Stern,
Rawson, and the drummer; the rancher and the stranger remained,
both to strike out by horseback in early morning along a forty-mile
trail into another part of the mountains. Night laid its full back
weight upon the land, the stars were very bright, the mountains lay
blackly lumped before them. O'Fallen waited beside the new horses,
reins in his hand. Von Stern climbed over the wheel to sit beside
Rheinmiller. The drummer walked straight by the girl and into the
coach. Rawson spoke to O'Fallen.</p>

<p>"Piutes moving around?"</p>

<p>"Too early. They ain't got the winter crimp out of their backs.
Saw one last week. Took a shot. Long shot. Missed."</p>

<p>Rawson cast his cigar aside and followed Evelyn into the coach.
"I'll sleep a little."</p>

<p>"Sit here. I've got the robe."</p>

<p>He settled beside her on the back seat and braced his long legs
under the jump, the sudden forward rush of the horses throwing him
against the cushions. O'Fallen shouted his farewell, the house
lights died, and the coach swung into the climbing mountain road,
into the profound darkness and the biting chill of the mountain's
timber. In the small hours Evelyn's restless turning woke him, and
he doubled his half of the robe back over her shoulders, and heard
her small protest. He said, "No point in both of us being
half-miserable." He hunched his shoulders against the drafts and
watched morning's first light dilute the dense night. At Roughneck
Creek the trees began to stand out individually; by five o'clock,
crawling up the hairpin turns of Jumpoff Joe, day washed the world
with a sunless, pearled clarity. The coach, reaching the summit of
this grade, entered the narrow turns of Echo Canyon and at seven
rolled into the meadow at Head of the Mountain and stopped before
Lasswell's roadhouse.</p>

<p>It was the end of Rheinmiller's run and he, chilled red face
showing above a bulky Army overcoat, threw the reins down to the
waiting Lasswell and came off the coach like a cranky bear backing
out of a tree. Bart Lennon, silver hair and silver mustache against
a peaceful brown face, stepped through Lasswell's doorway as soon
as he saw Rawson. He took Rawson's hand and gave it a vigorous
pumping. "Didn't expect you for a week. You well?"</p>

<p>"Fine as a frog in a puddle." Rawson turned and supported Evelyn
as she descended. The shaking of the ride and the stiffness of her
body unsettled her and for a moment she held to Rawson, laughing at
herself. "Hello, Bart."</p>

<p>"You soak up some coffee and some heat," said Bart Lennon.</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes for breakfast," said Rawson. "From here on
you're behind a highball driver."</p>

<p>"You or me?" said Bart.</p>

<p>"You think I came back to take in laundry?"</p>

<p>Von Stern and the drummer stood by in short-tempered silence.
Bart Lennon's faded blue eyes surveyed Rawson and his mouth made
its old man's kind smile. "All strutted up to crow, ain't you? And
ready to peck. Get your breakfast."</p>

<p>Away from Lasswell's the mountain corridor ran, its spring
grasses glazed by a dew which glittered in fractured brilliance
under the sun. Cupped in by pine slopes all around and touched by
the shadow of summits rising still higher against the blue, it lay
as one of a hundred such miniature natural parks scattered through
these tangled hills. The road, straining on for Ophir, made a
yellow track across the meadow, now and then passing through small
clumps of scattered timber. The last chill left the air, and the
smell of the mountains&mdash;pine resin and fragrant forest carpet and
damp coverts in which ten thousand years of forest mold sunlessly
lay&mdash;came strongly around Rawson, well-remembered, greatly missed,
and now savored in silent relish. Rawson drove with his body
swinging to the coach; he called briskly to the near wheeler slyly
soldiering in the harness. "Any changes, Bart?"</p>

<p>"Marsh is pretty wet. This comin' back your idea, or was it
Mulvey that pushed you to it?"</p>

<p>"Mine."</p>

<p>Lennon bent down to relight his pipe under the flap of his coat.
He settled on the seat, crossed his legs and laced his hands behind
his neck. "Never caught any sight of that fellow before he
shot?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Might have been one man or a dozen back there in the trees that
day. Poor show, Hughie. What's your intention?"</p>

<p>"Go after him."</p>

<p>"You don't know who you're lookin' for."</p>

<p>"I'll play for the break."</p>

<p>"Sittin' up here three times a week, cold meat? That makes no
sense whatever. He was twenty-five feet away when he fired. I
hunted up the tree and measured. So it was too close to be an
aecident, and I can't see why he didn't hit you straight. Who hates
you that much?"</p>

<p>"I think it was a cripple shot intended to scare me off the run.
That makes it more than one man. I think it's a gang, planning on
the future."</p>

<p>"That's what I believe, too. We don't carry dust more than once
every four trips. How could a man out in Camas Marsh know which
trip was worth holding up unless he had somebody spotting for him
in Ophir? That makes at least two&mdash;the spotter and the man who did
the shootin'. We don't pack the box till the morning we go. So
nobody knows till then. But when we lift the box to the seat it'd
be easy for anybody to tell if it was heavy or light. That's five
minutes before we pull out. The spotter, using a ridge trail, could
short-cut us to the marsh by half an hour."</p>

<p>"This gold business is pretty fat. It's not a small man's
game&mdash;it's a smart man's game, and he's got help. I want to tell
you what I think, Bart, later in camp."</p>

<p>"I might be in it, and then you'd tip your hand to me."</p>

<p>"At sixty-five what would you want with that much money? I had
six weeks to separate the sheep from the goats. I separated you
quick. I've got to trust somebody, or this is a pretty miserable
world. I'll start with you."</p>

<p>"Better end right there. You like to believe in your friends,
but it won't do. It'll kill you."</p>

<p>"I limp a little and maybe always will. A limping man's not the
same as a kid with nothing on his mind."</p>

<p>"Hughie," said Bart Lennon, "are you comin' back this time just
to prove to Ophir you've got nerve? That's a hell of a reason."</p>

<p>"I expect to be a rancher in this valley the rest of my life. If
I quit this job I'd have a reputation for backing down and every
neighbor in the hills would try to take a fall out of me for the
next fifty years. It won't do."</p>

<p>The valley grew narrower as it ran eastward, heavy hills rising
to left and right, and during early afternoon the road approached a
dark barrier of trees directly forward. At this barrier's edge,
and, hugging the road sat Fay Miller's, its newly peeled logs
shining in the sun; out upon the grassy open land some cattle
grazed. Since it was not a stage stop, Rawson ran by the cabin.
Behind the cabin, a young man turned a saddled horse, placing his
back to the coach.</p>

<p>"Who's that new one?"</p>

<p>"Drifted in a month back unknown to me. Don't see Fay's horse,
so he's in the hills. Hughie, this place don't signify."</p>

<p>"Not for a ranch," said Rawson. "It's too close to the marsh. Be
a good place though for a man that wanted to duck in and out of
cover in a hurry."</p>

<p>A hundred yards beyond Miller's dust ceased to rise from the
wheels and the coach passed into the timber, into a strong-flavored
shade, into another world. This was the low end of the valley; it
was a sump into which the creeks of the surrounding hills fell and
sluggishly played in search of an outlet long since clogged by
beaver dams. The result was a quivering black-soiled bog four miles
wide, covered with timber alive and dead and dying, and so
interlaced with fallen snags and faint-traced animal trails that it
seemed like a piece of prehistoric jungle surviving in the heart of
the hills. The road turned constantly in search of solid ground,
roughened by the corduroy logs originally on the surface but now
sucked below a mud which flew loosely away from the feet of the
horses.</p>

<p>Half through the marsh the road swung about the perfect circle
of a lagoon in which skinny-necked birds stood on their stilted
legs; farther on a piece of semidry ground appeared and a trail led
away from the road to some unknown place in the swamp.</p>

<p>"This is the place," said Lennon.</p>

<p>"He was behind that tree with the crooked foot," said
Rawson.</p>

<p>It was a two-hour passage through the place. At five o'clock
they broke clear of it and came upon Pennoyer's roadhouse in its
meadow. A considerable group of men stood in the yard, drawing
Lennon's interest.</p>

<p>"Something up."</p>

<p>Rawson lifted the horses into a last run and brought the coach
to a spectacular stop before the antler-studded wall of Pennoyer's
roadhouse, and before Pennoyer himself who waited here to catch the
reins Rawson dropped to him. Slightly beyond the house half-a-dozen
miners faced four cavalrymen and a tall lieutenant who had one hand
draped over the shoulders of a small man.</p>

<p>Rawson said, "Hello," to Pennoyer and dropped to the ground. It
was a casual greeting and neither man offered to shake hands.
Rawson's voice caught the lieutenant's interest and he strode
forward with a delighted wonder. "Hughie, I'll be damned."
Laughing, he laid his two hands on Rawson's shoulders and shook
them.</p>

<p>"Well," said Rawson, "you're wintered down." He gave this
lieutenant, Adna Romillys Carrico, 3rd Cavalry, a short shove and
grinned at him. "You're skinny from riding around interfering in
other people's business."</p>

<p>Von Stern and Evelyn came from the coach and Evelyn watched the
hearty show of affection between the men. Carrico was of much the
same build as Rawson, slightly under six feet, long legs and chest,
small hips, a fair skin and curled yellow hair which, though he was
only thirty, showed a streaking on his temples. What set him apart
from Rawson was an electric energy which warmed his face and glowed
from his wonderfully blue eyes. His uniform was mud-splashed and a
day's growth of whiskers darkened his jaws. Seeing Evelyn, he
removed his forage cap and made a bow toward her. "I've missed
you."</p>

<p>"That's nice," she said.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant," called a trooper.</p>

<p>Evelyn turned into the cabin. Carrico moved across to the group,
Rawson and von Stern and Bart Lennon with him. The trooper spoke
again. "What was your order, Lieutenant?"</p>

<p>Troopers and civilians made a loose ring around a dejected and
bitter-eyed little man of about twenty-five. He had no hat, his
clothes were crusted with mud, and a new scar crossed one side of
his face. Rawson spoke to him. "What's up, Potter?"</p>

<p>Potter shrugged his shoulders without looking directly at
Rawson. Carrico pointed to the group of prospectors. "These fellows
chased him down from Muddy Bar. He was just ready to join his
ancestors when I came along. They think he's been fooling with
their sluice boxes."</p>

<p>One of the prospectors said, "You just go home, Carrico. Your
business is to chase Piutes."</p>

<p>"You can't hang anybody around here on suspicion," said Carrico
patiently. "Sergeant, take Potter to Camp Wilson and lock him up.
When this blows over we'll see he gets a trial."</p>

<p>"I know your style," said the miner. "You'll turn him loose. It
won't do any good. We'll catch him again." He looked around and
nodded toward von Stern. "What would you do, George?"</p>

<p>Von Stern had been watching Potter with a gloomy disinterest. He
stared at the miner a moment, half-surprised by the question, and
again studied Potter, as though the latter were scarcely mere than
a carcass of beef. He shrugged. "Hell," he said, "hang him and be
done with it."</p>

<p>The answer was clearly a shock to Potter who stiffened his body
and gave von Stern a piercingly direct stare; strong emotion placed
a moment of resolution on his otherwise weak face and he drew a
deep breath. But, on the edge of speech, the fire went out of him
and he dropped his chin to resume his slack indifference.</p>

<p>"And what would you do; Hugh?" said the miner, pressing his
advantage. Rawson shook his head. "Carrico's right."</p>

<p>"Sure, sure," said the miner in discontent. "You'd stick with
him. But of all men, you ought to know a damned sight better." He
fumed, looking beyond the group to a man leaning against the trunk
of a near-by pine in the yard. "Fay, what you think?"</p>

<p>With the shadows of the tree upon him, Miller had rested quietly
back, unobserved by the people of the coach, and when Rawson's
glance turned to him he met it with a directness which was both
guarded and alert and in a degree insolent. He had one hand, the
left hand with its crooked fourth finger, jammed into a trouser
pocket; his rough and tumble shoulders rested against the tree and
he seemed to be only a spectator liughing at the audience. Yellow
hair, far yellower than Carrico's, lay like hanks of yarn beneath
his hat. He gave Rawson no more recognition than Rawson gave him,
but he studied von Stern for a moment before he shook his head at
the miner.</p>

<p>"None of my business," he said.</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Carrico, "take Potter to camp. That's the end
of the nonsense."</p>

<p>"The hell it is," said the miner. "You can lock him up, but wait
till he gets out. Come on."</p>

<p>The prospectors, soon on their horses, ran out of the yard and
the troopers swung up and waited for Potter to pull himself from
his listless manner. He said, "Thanks, Lieutenant," and nodded to
Rawson. Then the venom of outrage gave to this weak man his moment
of incalculable wickedness and he stared at von Stern out of
flat-lighted eyes and turned to his horse. Never once did he look
toward Fay Miller.</p>

<p>Rawson said, "We're wasting time," and walked to the washbasin
on its table at the corner of the cabin. The rest of the party went
inside, Miller joining them. When Rawson had scrubbed up he stood a
moment, listening to Pennoyer as the latter cursed the new relay
horses into harness. Westward he saw clouds gathering for a violent
spring storm; the day's fine light had begun to catch late
afternoon's amber shades. Then he went in to the supper table; he
spoke to Mrs. Pennoyer who moved about with the food.</p>

<p>The trip had worn on von Stern's nerves and his voice was rough.
"Someday that marsh road's going to drop right out from under the
coach."</p>

<p>"Beavers keep backing it up with their dams," said Lennon. "One
good ditch or a few sticks of dynamite would drain it quick."</p>

<p>For some reason the comment drew Fay Miller's interest. He
raised his head from the plate. "What for? Nothing wrong with the
road. Why change it?"</p>

<p>"To make it safe," said Lennon.</p>

<p>"Safe now."</p>

<p>"We ain't talkin' about the same, thing," said Lennon
quietly.</p>

<p>"I'm talking about the road," said Miller. He sat back on his
chair, right hand lying in view, the crippled left hand out of
sight. Discontented vitality gave his smile its edge of malice and
made his voice unpleasantly blunt; he seemed to be inwardly
laughing at them and still he was like a man waiting for something
to be said that he might challenge.</p>

<p>"It's not a ditch the marsh needs," said Rawson.</p>

<p>"Now there's a good driver talkin'," said Fay Miller. "And proud
of it, too."</p>

<p>Von Stern sent a quick cloudy glance toward Miller and withdrew
it. Lennon watched the man with steady mildness while Carrico, a
seemingly detached spectator, was mildly amused.</p>

<p>"What it needs," said Rawson, "is a couple of bullets well
used."</p>

<p>"In that stuff," said Fay Miller, "you'll need both hands for
swimmin', but maybe you're one of these fellows that can swim and
shoot at the same time."</p>

<p>Rawson patted the salt cellar and seasoned his meat.</p>

<p>"No, I'll do what the fellow did who shot me&mdash;I'll stand on
solid ground behind a tree. But I won't be as nervous as he was. I
won't miss at twenty-five feet." He ate on, paying no attention to
the others.</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Miller, his voice continuing with its small edge
of sarcasm, "the man got somethin' in his eye when he fired, or
maybe he was aimin' where he meant to aim. At twenty-five feet I'd
say he ought to give up shootin' if he really missed."</p>

<p>"One thing or the other," said Rawson, "it was his mistake."</p>

<p>"Think it worries him a lot?" said Miller.</p>

<p>"So long as there's trees for him to hide behind, maybe he
doesn't." Rawson finished his coffee and reached for a cigar. He
took his time lighting it; his face showed the fine enjoyment of
the smoke's fragrance: "I've speculated on that fellow. Don't
understand him. He likes to cripple his game before he kills it,
never willing to let the game get a look at him. Matter of nerve, I
guess. I don't think he's got any. I think he's yellow from his
socks to his hat." He hunted for the words he wanted with evident
enjoyment, He hadn't looked toward Miller, the girl noticed, but
now he settled his glance on the man, an unruffled and mild glance.
"I'm hunting for him and he shouldn't be hard to find. Not many men
of that kind around here. I don't think he thought this up by
himself. I think his britches are bought and paid for by somebody
else, and there's another man I want to see. That's what I came
back for. I propose to find both men."</p>

<p>The passengers came out and stepped into the coach.</p>

<p>Carrico stopped in the yard, Fay Miller watched from the
doorway, and Lennon crawled over the wheel to his side of the high
seat. Carrico said, "I'll be in Ophir tomorrow&mdash;I want to talk to
you."</p>

<p>Evelyn called from the coach. "You and Hugh and George are
eating with me tomorrow night. Get your drinks before you
come."</p>

<p>Rawson kicked the brake and shouted the team forward,</p>

<p>Lennon said, "You do surprise me, Hughie. That was your war
whoop, no mistake. You lighted a bonfire."</p>

<p>"Two bonfires," said Rawson.</p>

<p>"It ain't that certain."</p>

<p>"No, and I'd like to be wrong about some of it. We'll see, Bart.
We'll soon see."</p>

<p>They had left Pennoyer's at five-thirty. Two hours later, from
the ridge summit, another valley opened below them, running into a
gulch whose two walls rose high against the shadowed sky. Along the
gulch the first evening lights of Ophir were twinkling and beyond
Ophir the heavy hills slowly darkened.</p>

<p>Lennon mildly summed it up. "There must be two hundred thousand
in dust stacked up in the saloon safe and in Easterline's safe.
This spring the miners will take out an easy quarter million more.
All of it's got to go to Klickitat in this coach. That's the honey
drawin' the bears. It's the stacked up two hundred thousand we got
to worry about. It's too big a jaw now and we got to move inside
thirty days before it gets any bigger. There's your chore, Hughie,
everybody knows it and there ain't a hell of a lot of people
bettin' you can do it."</p>

<p>They left the ridge and rushed over the basin into the jaws of
two high ridges; and at eight-thirty that night, thirty-seven hours
from Klickitat, Rawson ran down Ophir's single street and drew in
before the crowd which always waited for a coach arrival around
George von Stern's saloon. A voice called, "Hello, Hugh&mdash;back for
the fun?" Then another voice said, "Throw down the mail sacks." He
tossed the reins to a hostler below, climbed from the box and
walked toward the cabin, ten doors distant, which was both his home
and the express office.</p>

<p>Rawson rose at five and lighted a fire in the steel-cold room,
and took his bucket and stepped into the frigid shock of an early
mountain air slowly stained by the unraveling smoke of five hundred
tin chimneys. He crossed the street, passed between two log
houses&mdash;Easterline's Store and von Stern's Paradise Saloon&mdash;to the
creek, caught his water, and returned to shave. Then he went over
to the saloon for his beans, bread, and coffee. There was no
restaurant in town, but von Stern's Chinaman could always furnish
breakfast from the free-lunch leftovers of the preceding night.</p>

<p>Von Stern presently joined him; dark skin red-glossed from
shaving, white shirt stiff with starch, his curled and heavy hair
well brushed. He said in the idlest way, "I didn't get that play
against Fay Miller. You know something, or just speculating?"</p>

<p>"Could be one thing or the other."</p>

<p>Von Stern shrugged his shoulders as if it were of no importance,
but his next question jolted Rawson.</p>

<p>"You took a walk with Evelyn in Klickitat. Did she say anything
about me?"</p>

<p>"No," Rawson said. "Something on your mind, George?"</p>

<p>Von Stern studied him closely. "No, nothing."</p>

<p>There was this moment between them, a moment in which things
were not as they ought to be. Rawson rose, irritated at von Stern
for bringing up the girl's name. "You play your hand your own
way."</p>

<p>"Always have," said von Stern in a completely neutral voice; the
statement could fall any direction. Then he added, "See you at
supper. Come in beforehand and we'll have a drink."</p>

<p>Rawson walked along the crooked street, with von Stern's
question inflicting its nettle sting. Von Stern hadn't really meant
it as a question, for the man was much too close-mouthed to open up
his private affairs to anybody else; what it amounted to, actually,
was a suggestion to Rawson to stay away from Evelyn. As soon as he
understood it, Rawson grew very thoughtful. The long friendship was
dying: It had begun to die the moment he had begun to suspect that
George might be in the holdup business. He didn't wish to believe
it and greatly hoped events would show him to be wrong; yet even if
it turned out so, the original suspicion would have killed the
friendship. Nobody could undo that change. George had sensed it;
his reaction was to issue his warning. He stepped into Easterline's
Store; he shook hands with Ruel Easterline and ordered a few
groceries and said, "I'll pick up the dust you've got in the safe,
tonight or tomorrow," and waited while the storekeeper got his
order together, vainly trying to summon up a decent interest in
this colorless man. At thirty-five, Ruel Easterline might as well
have been fifty or sixty for all the difference it made. Grave and
neutral, with a visible anxiety to please people, he evoked no
strong reaction of any sort from Rawson, who felt that it was
difficult to pity Easterline for having an unfaithful wife. But
neither was it possible for him to condemn Beth Easterline for
wanting something her husband could not supply. It was one of those
bad deals which happened to people.</p>

<p>Rawson walked to the side arch of Bailey Powell's blacksmith
shop and stepped into the racket of Powell's hammer swinging down
upon the anvil. Powell swung the ironwork back into the forge fire
and came about to catch Rawson's hand with a fist as hard as the
hoof on which he worked; his saddle brown eyes sent out a favorable
beaming. "Good boy, Hugh," he said. "Limpin'?"</p>

<p>"Maybe it'll straighten out."</p>

<p>"Hope so." He lighted his pipe, and sat down on an upended tub,
great arms slack over spraddled legs. "Back to drivin'?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Powell, and gave his head half a shake and half a
nod. It was impossible to know whether the gesture meant assent or
regret for, with the beard so wholly covering him, Powell was a
faceless giant made further dumb by a lack of ability with
words.</p>

<p>Rawson strolled past the forge to the shop's rear doorway, it
opening up on a gravel bar not much more than ten feet from the
creek's high springtime stage. Across the creek a log barn sat on
the narrow gravel strip, with a pole corral enclosing a dozen wild
and runty horses which Veen Tilson, the Texas horse trader, sold to
the miners after a casual breaking. Zigzag trails ran up the face
of the mountain and disappeared into the thick hill timber. At this
moment Tilson sat on a bench before his barn, warming himself in
the first strong sunlight and seeming to study something higher
along the gulch. Rawson presently spoke over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Tilson still ride that calico horse with the marble eyes?"</p>

<p>"He does."</p>

<p>Rawson's attention moved to staggered pathways of the mountain's
side. "Bailey," he said, "how often do you shoe that calico
horse?"</p>

<p>"Maybe every month."</p>

<p>"Pretty often," said Rawson. "Means a lot of riding."</p>

<p>He returned to the street and met Bart Lennon coming down from
the upper part of camp. He made a motion at Bart and the two,
turning, swung into the stiff-pitched wagon road which climbed the
north wall of the gulch to a burying place on the summit flat. The
ground at the bottom of Ophir gulch, containing gold, was too
expensive for the dead. Halfway up, the cabins well below, the two
squatted against the incline.</p>

<p>"Easterline's out of it," said Rawson. "He's not tough enough to
be a crook. But Tilson won't lie straight in my head."</p>

<p>"He could be the fellow carryin' the news from here to somebody
in the marsh."</p>

<p>"There's only two places on the road to worry about, the
marsh&mdash;which is a perfect spot for a holdup&mdash;and in the timber
between Head of the Mountain and the desert. We're going to try
something, Bart. You take the stage out in the morning. Tonight
I'll draw some of the dust from Easterline's safe, nobody else
knowing, load it in a couple of saddlebags and make a round-about
run. I'll meet the coach at Head of the Mountain&mdash;in the canyon.
Rheinmiller can take it from there."</p>

<p>Lennon shook his head. "That's just a little jag. Won't make a
dent in the stuff stored up. I don't see any way to sneak it
through. We've got to put it on the stage and make the run."</p>

<p>"It's just a fooler, Bart. I'll tell George what I'm doing, If
the news leaks, we'll know how."</p>

<p>Bart looked squarely at Rawson. "Feel bad if he's in it?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't like it, Bart." Rawson snapped a stunted grass stem
and put it in a corner of his mouth. "He's been my friend for a
long time."</p>

<p>At suppertime, Rawson crossed to the saloon, and found von Stern
and Carrico waiting for him at the corner table. "You've delayed my
drinking," said Carrico. "Where've you been?"</p>

<p>"Riding around."</p>

<p>Von Stern filled the glasses around and Carrico said, "How," and
they downed the whiskey. Von Stern had shaved again, his face
showing the ruddy glow of hot towels, fresh shirt straining against
his coat. He said to Rawson, "Ride up the gulch?"</p>

<p>"Here and there," said Rawson.</p>

<p>Carrico smiled. "The information just pours out of him." He
observed the settling of von Stern's expression, and his own manner
grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>Veen Tilson shouldered himself from the crowd around the bar and
walked to the table, drawing back a chair as if to join the others;
at that moment von Stern's eyes struck him with a hooded
irritation, the effect of it like a strong push, and Tilson checked
himself. He was a small, wire-drawn man with a cowhand's sprung
legs and a dry face deeply corroded by seams of rough living. He
stood half-faced about, and his smile, reaching Rawson from this
angle, was sly and overfriendly. "Glad to see you, boy. I was
thinkin'&mdash;that bay of yours is old. You ought to let me trade you a
better horse."</p>

<p>"No," said Rawson. This man was no friend of his, and he knew
it, and yet used the familiar manner deliberately; he was a cheap
scoundrel with no reputation and too much brass, and secretly
contemptuous of those upon whom he imposed. Behind him, Rawson
suddenly noticed, Fay Miller stood near the bar, watching this
scene with his flushed and acidly amused countenance. If his guess
were right, these three men were against him&mdash;Miller and Tilson and
George. What brought them together under one roof? Veen Tilson,
still smiling, walked around the table and clapped his hand briskly
on Rawson's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, boy, you need a better horse."</p>

<p>Rawson turned to catch von Stern's expression, and found only a
shrewdly dulled poker mask. <i>Might find out something here</i>,
he thought, and said aloud to Tilson, "Take your damned hand off
me."</p>

<p>The man's smile remained, growing tighter until the lips were
fish-creased. <i>Maybe</i>, thought Rawson, <i>he wants to make a
sucker out of me in front of the camp. There's some reason for
this. His reason, or Miller's or George's</i>. He shifted his body
and gave Tilson a full-armed shove which sent the man backward and
off his feet to the floor. Rawson bent forward on the chair, hands
propped against his kneecaps for a quick jump. Tilson rose from the
floor, the skin of his face grey and wrinkled; he passed a hand
over his skull, he looked quickly around&mdash;it might have been toward
Miller, or von Stern, or anybody. In his eyes the furnace doors
were wide open. <i>There</i>, thought Rawson, <i>danced the
devil</i>.</p>

<p>"I ought to stamp your guts out," said Tilson.</p>

<p>Rawson shoved himself from the chair, watching Tilson's arm whip
behind his coat toward his trouser band; he came in quickly to stop
the knife he knew was there, he hit Tilson flat-fisted on the face,
he clubbed the man's trapped arm downward, and caught him and
rushed him backward against the saloon wall. He drew him away from
the wall and threw him into it with a full shove of back and
shoulders. The horse trader dropped on his knees. He coughed and
let his head bob, but he said, "I'm goin' to kill you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Von Stern's voice leaped at him. "Shut up, Tilson. You can't
come in my place and pull a ruckus."</p>

<p>Tilson came off the floor, breath rustling through a wide-open
mouth. He said, "All right&mdash;all right," and brushed himself, and
touched his face, and looked at his finger tips. He avoided
Rawson's eyes and sent a quick, strange glance at von Stern.
<i>That's it</i>, thought Rawson, <i>there's his boss</i>. He said
to Tilson, "Keep away from me. Next time you try to make me look
foolish in front of a crowd, I'll break your neck." He passed into
the crisp night, waiting there. Carrico and von Stern presently
joined him and the three moved toward Evelyn Harvey's cabin.</p>

<p>Carrico said, "What was that all about?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"That was poor judgment," said von Stern. "You made an enemy.
What for?"</p>

<p>Evelyn's door stood open and she came from the rear room. "Have
you had your drinks?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Carrico. He removed his hat and stared at her with
open, admiring directness.</p>

<p>She turned to Rawson and von Stern. "Why are you solemn?"</p>

<p>Carrico said, "Hugh went out in the open market and bought
himself a fight," and explained it to the girl. "George and I don't
know why."</p>

<p>"I do," she said.</p>

<p>Von Stern said, "Why?"</p>

<p>"Because," she said, and touched Rawson's arm, the light dancing
brightly in her eyes. She was again for him like crystal, all color
and motion, and her presence squeezed sensation out of strange
places into his nerves and this sensation ran fully through him.
Evelyn said, "Sit down," and turned into the kitchen. The three men
settled themselves, crowded between the table and the dress dummy
and the shelves of bolt goods along the wall.</p>

<p>Early springtime darkness flowed into the canyon while they ate,
and lanterns bobbed past the house. Somewhere in the camp's upper
part the music of a guitar and fiddle unevenly rose and fell. Von
Stern looked at Carrico. "I guess we better let go on Hugh."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>"Hugh," said von Stern, "you've got no show. You're out in the
open&mdash;other fellow's in the brush. No sport in camp would lay three
to one money on your lasting ninety days if you try to drive
through to Klickitat with the dust. It's maybe a matter of pride
for you to prove you can't be bluffed. Go ahead and get killed to
prove it, and what good is that to you? It's a bad deal. I think
it, Ad thinks it. All your friends do. So does Evelyn."</p>

<p>"I haven't said," she put in. "Anyhow, you're using the wrong
argument on him."</p>

<p>"What's a better one?"</p>

<p>"None. He made up his mind in Portland."</p>

<p>"I wasn't aware of that," said von Stern, coolness in his
tone.</p>

<p>Carrico tried his luck. "It takes a certain kind of man to
survive this business, the kind who thinks all other men are dogs
out to bite him. You're not that kind."</p>

<p>"That's closer," said Evelyn, "but it won't change him."</p>

<p>Von Stern pointed a stiff forefinger at Rawson. "You want to
start a ranch in Deer Valley. You're working to build up a stake,
but at two hundred a month it'll be forever. Quit driving and I'll
stake you up to $2500. Pay it back when you make the grade."</p>

<p>Rawson shrugged his shoulders. "Nice to have friends. You can
dig my grave when the time comes."</p>

<p>"I'll talk to him," said Evelyn. "You two go away." Carrico
turned and put his hand on von Stern's arm, drawing him to the
door; before passing through he looked back, now entirely smiling.
"The strategy is clever."</p>

<p>She burst into laughter. "Oh, Ad, you're half a sinner and half
a saint."</p>

<p>"Which is better?" he asked, and pulled a silent von Stern into
the night.</p>

<p>Rawson watched her manner swiftly swing. She showed restlessness
and moved to the door and watched the street. Then she turned. "You
think a lot of things about me. I wish you'd say some of them so I
could put you right."</p>

<p>He rose and stacked his dishes and walked into the kitchen.
"Come on."</p>

<p>"I'll do that later. I want to talk."</p>

<p>"Talk with your hands in water." Then he turned to her. "You
worried about George outside and me inside? Maybe I'd better
go."</p>

<p>She came into the kitchen with a short-tempered expression. She
put on her apron and filled the dishpan while he got a towel. She
said, "You're dumb at the wrong times."</p>

<p>They finished the job in silence. He hung the towel back of the
stove and got an armload of wood from the shed for the woodbox. He
sat on the woodbox, full and comfortable and sleepy contentment was
a drug turning him wonderfully stupid. She had left on the
coffeepot and now poured a cup for both of them.</p>

<p>"You'll be set like iron in your ways when you're an old man,"
she said. The night air, coming through the front door, chilled her
and she rose and closed it and came back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>He said, "George will be here ten minutes after I'm gone&mdash;sore,
That why you're doing this?"</p>

<p>She turned, her mouth honey-smooth with its amusement, Shock
came again to him and he held her glance until the amusement
withdrew from her and the aloofness vanished. He closed his eyes,
the fire's warmth soaking into his bones until he weighed a
thousand pounds. He had no thoughts at all, only the sensation of
complete well-being.</p>

<p>She said, "A fine thing, sleeping in my woodbox. Go home to
bed."</p>

<p>He rose and went to the door. "You and George having a little
trouble?"</p>

<p>"Turn around and tell me what made you ask."</p>

<p>"He wanted to know if you'd said anything about him on our walk
in Klickitat."</p>

<p>She was silent and in argument with herself; by the tightening
of her features, he saw her go over some disagreeable jump. "That
sounds as though he has rights, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"George is no Carrico for light nonsense. He's jealous."</p>

<p>"Do you think he has any rights?"</p>

<p>"You want to know what I think?"</p>

<p>"I know what you think. I want you to say it."</p>

<p>"Well, hasn't he?" He turned away. She said nothing when he
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>She walked to the back room, poured herself another cup of
coffee, and sat on the kitchen chair. She looked into the cup as a
gypsy looks into a magic brew, her face turned peaceful. She
thought of the friendship between Hugh, Carrico, and von Stern, and
realized it was dying. Men were strange creatures to whom
friendships meant much, and when friendship vanished they were
saddened without saying so. She had known for many weeks that Hugh
had looked at her with his private thoughts and yet, because he
believed her to be von Stern's choice, he had stayed quiet, That
was friendship. Yet she knew too that when these two men no longer
trusted each other&mdash;and she saw that suspicion beginning&mdash;Hugh
Rawson might still stay quiet; for he had other thoughts about her
which put a barrier between. There was nothing she could do about
it.</p>

<p>She heard the sudden solid fist on the door, three blunt raps
identifying George. She sat still. She thought: <i>I ought to end
this now. I ought to let him in and tell him.</i> She heard him
speak. "Evelyn, I'd like to talk to you."</p>

<p><i>No,</i> she thought, <i>I'll wait.</i></p>

<p>"I'm in bed, George."</p>

<p>There was no sound from him and she visualized him rankly
angered in the darkness, half-disposed to quarrel; his temper; when
roused, was like dull red iron sullenly shining. Presently she
heard him turn away.</p>

<p>From the window of the store's living quarters, Beth Easterline
watched Evelyn's place until she saw Carrico leave it with Von
Stern. She thought: <i>Damn you for wasting time in her place,</i>
and haste got into her and she finished the supper dishwashing as
fast as possible. She threw on her coat and stepped into the store.
Easterline was at his account book, the yellow light not kind to
his face, She said, "I've got to get out of here&mdash;I'm going for a
walk."</p>

<p>"There's a drunk or two around. Be a little careful."</p>

<p>"I'll be careful," she said.</p>

<p>Directly beyond the store she turned into the rough road which
led to the burial grounds at the top of the ridge. She walked so
rapidly that she was out of breath when she reached the summit and
saw the shadow of horse and man a short distance away. She went
immediately to Carrico and stepped into his arms with a sighing
delight at his roughness.</p>

<p>He untied a blanket behind the saddle and threw it to the
ground, the two settling on it. He said, "This is miserable
business."</p>

<p>"I don't mind. At least we have this much."</p>

<p>"Something's got to be done," he said. "The camp's going to
start talking. I can't have you muddied up by that. I've been
trying to think a way out of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>She said, "There's no way. Don't worry. It doesn't matter, I
don't care if Ruel finds out&mdash;that's how far I've gone. When I see
you, I'm happy. In between, I'm dead."</p>

<p>Her lips hunted over his face with hot liveliness and found his
mouth and pressed heavily against it. He pulled her nearer, and
locked his arms about her. She shook, she made a queer sound in her
chest, and was afterwards still. The grazing horse drifted
away.</p>

<p>The moment Rawson stepped into his cabin the sensation of danger
prickled through him. He stopped, one foot ahead of the other, and
swung his head to orient the man he knew was there.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said a voice. "I'm in your back room."</p>

<p>"Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Potter."</p>

<p>He struck a match to the table lamp and saw the man's pack-rat
face hooked around the casing of the kitchen door. He turned the
lampwick down to a thin rind of light: "How'd you get out of
Carrico's guardhouse?"</p>

<p>"He opened the door and told me to walk."</p>

<p>That would be Carrico's way, to balance this small human being
against the crowd and to decide against the crowd. "You're not
smart," said Rawson. "You're fair game for any man's gun."</p>

<p>"You did me a favor&mdash;and I can do you one. I need some
grub."</p>

<p>Rawson found a linen sack and walked to the grub shelf. He
dumped some flour into the sack and a two-pound chunk of bacon; he
threw in his small sack of coffee, a bag of salt, and his can of
baking powder. "That'll take you to Klickitat; and if you're smart
you'll not stop till you get there."</p>

<p>Potter said, "You know why you got knocked off that coach?"</p>

<p>"You tell me."</p>

<p>"They figured there'd be no more shipments for awhile. That
backs up a lot of dust here and when you load the express box,
it'll be a big load. They want that&mdash;not a lot of little jags
slippin' through their fingers trip after trip, but one big chunk
of gold they can grab and run with."</p>

<p>"Who's they?"</p>

<p>The little man teetered one hand back and forth. "They're here
in Ophir, and out on the road. I never was in with 'em, but I see a
lot, riding around."</p>

<p>"You're guessing, Potter."</p>

<p>Potter shook his head. "If you see enough, you can guess pretty
straight. They know it too. You think it's the miners I'm worried
about? Not a bit. It's the other crowd that I'm duckin'!"</p>

<p>"Better start then."</p>

<p>Potter rose and slipped to the door. "Take the trail along the
ridge and cut off toward the marsh. See what you find." He slid
through the door and closed it quietly.</p>

<p>Rawson whipped out the light, and left the cabin, going directly
to the stable. He saddled, moved fifty yards along the street, and
stepped into the gap between Easterline's Store, went in, and came
out again in fifteen minutes with two saddlebags filled with dust
from Easterline's safe. There were no lights in Tilson's barn when
he crossed the creek and moved up the trail, but at the summit
corral he saw the shape of Tilson's calico. He passed into the
thoroughly black trail.</p>

<p>Tilson, during that time, squatted halfway up the east wall of
the gulch, waiting to identify the walking shadow he had earlier
noted climbing the cemetery road, Having this bird's-eye view, he
saw a man come from Rawson's cabin, reach a horse, and angle up the
hill. When he crossed the cemetery road, he was within ten feet of
Tilson who, flat on the ground; identified him.</p>

<p>He had no gun, or he would have shot Potter at that moment. He
lay silent until Potter disappeared, then scrambled down the hill
and walked briskly to the saloon. He stepped into the crowd and
moved around until he caught von Stern's attention. Immediately
afterward he left the saloon, circled to a rear door, and entered a
small room back of the bar, this being von Stern's bedroom. Von
Stern presently came in, closed the door quickly behind him.</p>

<p>"I don't like this, Veen."</p>

<p>"I saw Potter. I think he came out of Rawson's. He's gone
now."</p>

<p>Von Stern's face settled. He shook his head. "He didn't know
much, but it won't do."</p>

<p>"Might know more than we think. He was always sneakin' around
the trail, watchin' for an easy miner to pick. I think he's got it
sized up. If he's scared he'll head for Klickitat&mdash;but he's told
Rawson something."</p>

<p>"I'll think about it," said von Stern. "You stay out of it. What
were you trying to do tonight?"</p>

<p>"Damn the man&mdash;he can't shove me."</p>

<p>"Stay out of that, too. Every time you move you tip your hand,
or mine. Where's Fay?"</p>

<p>"He started back."</p>

<p>"All right," said von Stern, and watched the horse trader open
the door, pinch himself through the crack, and disappear. That, he
thought, was the trouble&mdash;the bad judgment of the men he had to
work with in this proposition.</p>

<p>Riding through the hard-shadowed mountains, Rawson went on until
he was certain he had passed the mouth of the side trail to
Portuguese Camp, drew off the trail, and rolled into his saddle
blanket. He was in motion again at first daylight, a chilled man on
an irritable horse. The sun rose right above the pine tops, but in
this constant shade the deep chill remained. Below him, though he
couldn't see it, the military post of Camp Wilson lay, a half-dozen
cabins and a stockade housing Carrico's skeleton company of
cavalry.</p>

<p>Half an hour more of riding brought him to another side trail
swinging down the mountain and this, remembering Potter's advice,
he took. Three miles onward the trail forked, right-hand prong
aiming directly for the swamp now not far away, left-hand prong
swinging west of the swamp&mdash;and probably coming out behind Fay
Miller's cabin.</p>

<p>He followed the right fork down the final pitch of the mountain
directly into the edge of the swamp and found himself facing what
seemed an impassable area. The trail ended here; yet when he looked
more closely he saw it twisting from one semisolid hummock to
another, skirting fallen trees and disappearing into rank brush. A
black and odorous water lay everywhere, edged by an ancient,
dull-shining mud; the horse, lowering his head for a better sight
of such footing, stood still until he spurred it.</p>

<p>Cautiously traveling, he made a quarter mile before the
resistance of the horse stopped him. He was on a miniature island
twenty feet wide, looking across a ten-foot strip of dead water to
another such island; the trail went into the water and came out
again, but when he looked into the water he saw no fording place.
He dropped from the saddle, got a yard-long dead branch, and
plunged it through the slack pool into the bottom mud; the pole
went full length and touched no bottom.</p>

<p>He crossed the brushy hummock to its other side and at once saw
he had misread the trail; it came this way, followed the causeway
of an old beaver dam, touched another hummock, and, by one devious
turning and another, reached the island he saw across the strip of
water. The mistake jarred him and he circled the hummock to find
his back trail. In any direction, the view was the same&mdash;snags and
thicket and live trees dying and these small steppingstone bits of
solid earth surrounded by black-glittering water. He thought he
sighted the way by which he had come and went immediately to his
horse and turned about.</p>

<p>He lost himself twice again before finally reaching firm ground
at the edge of the hills, and came out a good hundred yards from
his entry point, quietly sweating.</p>

<p>Nothing but experience would do in that place and, when the
shadows began to settle on the marsh, not even experience would be
much of a comfort. Yet whoever had shot him had come from the
marsh, had used it for a shelter.</p>

<p>He returned to the trail on the crest of the ridge and followed
this until, during the afternoon, it carried him gradually downward
into Deer Valley behind Lasswell's place. He let the horse graze
and settled himself to catnap through the mild day; toward
suppertime he saw the stage break into view on the valley floor,
and he rode a wide circle around Lasswell's to the stony gap which
ran through Head of the Mountain and waited there.</p>

<p>He transferred the saddlebags to the stage when Barney came
through an hour later, and turned back to Lasswell's for his
supper. Bart Lennon, finished with his run, had already eaten and
sat peacefully in the yard with his pipe, enjoying the soft-falling
twilight; and after his meal, Rawson joined him for a smoke, giving
his horse time for a bag of oats, As soon as that was done, Rawson
turned homeward on the road.</p>

<p>Fay Miller's cabin was dark when he passed it. Within the marsh
he was closed about by silence which was not silence&mdash;the
surreptitious wake of things moving, without echo, of a yeasty
stirring beneath the mud, of nostrils flared to catch his odor as
he passed, of living things turned to moment's stone when he rode
near. The tension of the place worked on him so that the Pennoyer
meadow, when he came upon it, was a relief. It was midnight, but a
light burned in the cabin and a pair of horses stood at the door:
He rode to the leanto, unsaddled, and walked back; when he entered
he saw Pennoyer rising from a chair with a quick expression of
surprise&mdash;of unusual surprise. Fay Miller and the stranger who
stayed with Miller sat at the table, drinking coffee.</p>

<p>Pennoyer said, "I'll get some more coffee," and turned to the
kitchen. <i>Caught him off guard,</i> Rawson thought. Was it
surprise or something else? He moved to the fire and put his back
to it. The stranger with Miller was a kid with a bony face, big
eyes, and a bad look about him, and his clothes were dirtier than
anybody's clothes ought to be.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pennoyer brought in the coffee to the kitchen. Rawson
thought, <i>Pennoyer doesn't want to show up in this, whatever it
is</i>. Fay Miller was idle, closely thinking, and rank vitality
simmered in him and put its sullen shining in his eyes. "Why don't
you stay in your own country?" he asked.</p>

<p>"When did we start settin' up different countries?"</p>

<p>"That swamp," said Miller, "is part of my ranch. Keep out of
it."</p>

<p>"When did you file on it at the land office?" asked Rawson. He
drank his coffee, watching Miller over the cup's rim.</p>

<p>The younger man, rising, began to circle the table toward the
fire. Rawson spoke gently to him. "Don't get behind my back."</p>

<p>The younger man stopped; he turned his head toward Miller.
Miller nodded at him. "Don't let anybody give you orders."</p>

<p>"I think that's bad advice," sind Rawson.</p>

<p>"Turk," said Miller, "go around him if you want."</p>

<p>The younger man remained indecisive in his tracks, half-turned
and half-strained by the position.</p>

<p>Miller said, "You bluff that easy?"</p>

<p>"Maybe he's smart enough not to carry another man's bucket,"
said Rawson. He rose, made half a swing, and stepped to the fire;
he laid his back to it, keeping both men before him, and he began
to think about Pennoyer somewhere around the cabin, or maybe
outside looking through a window. He had to figure three to one if
anything blew up.</p>

<p>Miller said, "You threw something at me the other day at the
table. I didn't care much about it. Made me look funny in front of
people. What was on your mind?"</p>

<p>"When somebody crowds me," said Rawson, "I crowd back."</p>

<p>Miller rose and came around the table. He stood three paces from
Rawson with impulse and caution chasing each other across his face.
He was close to a showdown. His wild temper carried him toward it,
his coolness held him back. He threw a glance toward Turk who,
after a moment's hesitation, walked around the table and paused
near the kitchen door; this placed him at a more extreme angle of
Rawson's vision, and Rawson called him.</p>

<p>"Don't stand there, Turk, Unless you mean to start
something."</p>

<p>"I'm just walkin' around," said Turk.</p>

<p>"Walk toward the front door," said Rawson, "where I can see you
better."</p>

<p>"Do as you please, Turk," said Miller.</p>

<p>Rawson lifted his voice. "Mrs. Pennoyer, I think you'd better
get out of the kitchen. You're in my line of fire."</p>

<p>Turk said, "Never mind," and walked over and stopped by the
front door, behind Miller.</p>

<p>"What you made of&mdash;mush?" said Miller. Anger pushed him beyond
his restraint. "Let's mix it right here. Drop your gun and I'll
drop mine."</p>

<p>"I'll keep mine."</p>

<p>"I can take a fall out of you any day in the week," said
Miller.</p>

<p>"Don't think you can. Want to try?"</p>

<p>"Just fists?"</p>

<p>"So long as that's your limit," said Rawson promptly. "If I see
anything funny I won't stop to argue. Turk, stay where you
are."</p>

<p>"I ain't moved," said Turk.</p>

<p>Miller stepped in, his hands idle; he stopped within reach of
Rawson, firelight yellowing his eyes. What Rawson watched for was
the signal of coming motion around Miller's mouth&mdash;the instant of
lip pressure by which men betrayed themselves&mdash;and when he saw it
he turned his body and knocked down Miller's left hand as it came
in. He struck Miller in the stomach directly below the center
joining of the ribs. It hurt Miller enough to stop him a moment and
Rawson threw a punch into the man's face, and side-stepped and
tried a far-swinging wallop into Miller's stomach. Miller's fist
came out of a blind spot and seemed to blow off the top of his
head.</p>

<p>He threw up his arms and was badly beaten around the ribs before
he got his guard down; he jumped back, Miller furiously rushing
him, and he whirled aside and threw his shoulder at Miller, as the
latter went by. He was too slow to catch the man; he turned and saw
Miller pull himself around. He jumped Miller, he slugged him in the
belly and drove him against a chair which, catching Miller at the
back of the legs, threw him. He landed on a shoulder, rolled
catlike, and came up. He stood a moment, both arms feinting. He
said, "I'm going to put you back in the hospital for another
month." He dropped his head, rushing. Rawson knocked his arms down
and took the full impact of the lower head on his chin. He gave
ground, he hooked Miller in the face and got the man's head raised.
Miller's beating blows knocked him left and right and swayed him.
He rammed his skull into the man's nose and mouth, and jumped
aside. Miller's quick feet danced around and he rushed, reaching
and missing and crowding in. Rawson whirled, flung an arm about
Miller's neck, and gave a sharp, turning, downward heave. He got
behind Miller and locked his grip and stepped backward, dragging
Miller off balance. The man's falling weight came upon his own neck
and he began to kick out with his feet, striking nothing. His
backward arm swings went by Rawson. Rawson held him thus suspended
and watched him grow a deeper red. Then he dropped him and circled
to keep Turk in his view.</p>

<p>Miller stood up, his eyes strained out and his mouth opened to a
suckling circle; he bent over with a moment's agony of wanting
wind, and thus left himself wide-open. Rawson ignored the target,
for suddenly he had enough of it. His bad leg seemed a column of
flame from ankle to hip. "That will be enough, Fay."</p>

<p>Miller was a mean bull, stunned for the moment but still
dangerous, his face the face of a man looking into some deep place.
But then the insolence and the changeable mockery came quickly
back. He turned and walked to the door and paused a moment to stare
at the younger man. He spoke with a heavy sarcasm. "If you're not
afraid of the dark, Turk, we'll ride home." He opened the door and
stepped into the night. Turk, following, shut the door behind
him.</p>

<p><i>That,</i> thought Rawson, <i>is his second try at scaring me
off the run.</i> He was as certain as he would ever be that Miller
had taken the shot at him. It explained this business completely.
From the corner of his eye he saw Pennoyer in the kitchen
doorway.</p>

<p>Pennoyer said, "You stayin' here tonight?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Pennoyer pointed to the corner room. "Use that," he said, and
returned to the kitchen.</p>

<p>George von Stern, the following morning, left Ophir before
daybreak, climbing the hill west of camp; steadily traveling
through the rain, he reached the burn and at the next turnoff to
the left he passed into a rough and heavily timbered gulch. A mile
of this brought him to a mass of cabin-sized rocks tumbled into the
gulch from the ridge parapets above and though the trail skirted
these and followed the gulch to its head, he swung left again to
follow the track of the slide until it struck the base of the
ridge.</p>

<p>In some long-gone time these thousands of tons of rock, soil,
and pine had tumbled down to lodge one upon another, now overgrown
with another generation of timber. A vague pathway carried him
directly toward an obvious dead end at the barrier of the slide;
then, sharply swinging, it went around one of the rocks, passed
through a stony aperture and stopped in a natural room created by
the slide. It was large enough not only for von Stern and his horse
but also for Fay Miller&mdash;who waited there&mdash;his horse, and a small
fire Miller had built. The smoke curled upward, was caught by a
current of wind and sucked deeper into the rock pile.</p>

<p>Miller said, "I been waiting two hours&mdash;damn dismal place."</p>

<p>"What happened to your face?"</p>

<p>"Had a fight with Rawson last night. What was he doing at
Pennoyer's? It's up to Tilson to keep track of him."</p>

<p>Von Stern settled on his heels and laid his palms over the fire.
"This dust business will break soon. He's got to get it out to
Klickitat. If he tries to scatter a little bit on each trip he
won't be able to cut the backlog down. He'll do what I'd do&mdash;load
it on one run and try to make the drive through with four or five
men riding guard in the coach."</p>

<p>"It's going to be lively," said Fay Miller.</p>

<p>"I expect you to figure the thing in such a way that there can't
be any fight."</p>

<p>"Now, George, use your head. Of course there'll be a fight." He
pointed a finger straight upon von Stern. "How much you think
there'll be on that load?"</p>

<p>"About two hundred thousand. I don't want trouble, Fay."</p>

<p>"You're mixed up, George. You expect me to shoot around a man,
but not hit him at a time like that when hell's apt to be comin'
down the hill on a greased skid? Not possible."</p>

<p>Von Stern's muddy brown eyes rose on Miller. "That nervous
finger of yours did it. The shooting wasn't necessary. Rawson's a
well-liked man around camp, and all the sympathy's on his side. The
upshot of it is the camp's wondering what goes on. You already
started one piece of business you've got to finish in a hurry.
Potter's loose. Carrico let him out of the guardhouse, and night
before last Tilson saw him come from Rawson's cabin."</p>

<p>"He don't know much," said Miller. He grew thoughtful; he shook
his head. "But the little weasel's probably picked up something by
watching the trails."</p>

<p>"You take care of that," said Vall Stern. "And do it fast."</p>

<p>The hard rattling of rain on the cabin roof made the stove's
warmth particularly cozy and comfortable. Evelyn had a pillow on
the floor and knelt before Mrs. Easterline with her tape, measuring
the woman for a dress. Mrs. Easterline stood patiently. "What day's
this?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Friday," said Evelyn and looked up to see the giveaway
expression around the mouth.</p>

<p>The fitting ended, Evelyn made a pot of tea and the two sat in
the front room for idle chat. "I envy your skin," said Mrs.
Easterline. "Mine's rough. It's the weather. I dread to think what
I shall be like at forty."</p>

<p>"That's a long way off."</p>

<p>"Too close. Oh, well, it's of no account. Everything's accident
anyhow, and even the good accidents come too late." Her eyes fell
toward her cup. "Is there any talk around camp about me?"</p>

<p>Evelyn said, "Why don't you leave Ophir?"</p>

<p>"My husband makes a living here."</p>

<p>"Then go alone. You're certainly miserable, in this place."</p>

<p>"I'd be more miserable away."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you and Ad do something about all this?"</p>

<p>"He does what the Army tells him. I couldn't ask him to resign.
It's his profession. I couldn't divorce Easterline. That would be
against Ad's record if he married me and I'd not be socially
accepted in the Army."</p>

<p>"It sounds as though you've not asked Ad to do anything. Perhaps
he would."</p>

<p>Beth Easterline shrugged her shoulders and met Evelyn's gaze
with a matter-of-fact directness. She considered a moment and
said:</p>

<p>"We'll just go on till something happens. He'll be
transferred&mdash;that's the normal thing. Or he'll grow tired, or
perhaps I will." Her smile came swiftly and sharply through her
dramatic soberness. "I'll tell you something in confidence. I have
no intentions of divorcing or leaving Easterline."</p>

<p>Suddenly she laughed at Evelyn and left the cabin.</p>

<p>Evelyn washed the teacups and returned to the front room to
continue work. But the desire had left her, the room was stuffy,
and Beth Easterline's talk disturbed her. She wrapped a shawl
around her head, covered herself with a heavy coat, and stepped
into the rough afternoon to work off the accumulated pressure of
thinking. A heavy stove smoke rolled from the chimney of Rawson's
cabin. She had noticed him enter town an hour earlier and go by her
door, clothes muddy and in need of a shave. Something of interest
had kept him out in the hills for two days and she hoped he meant
to stop in after he had taken care of himself and speak of it. But
that she oughtn't to expect. He was in a hard game and couldn't say
very much to anybody. She thought to herself: <i>Speak or not, just
come.</i> Suddenly, two days was a long time to be away from a
person one needed.</p>

<p>Two men with a loaded packhorse behind them rode up to the
blacksmith shop; and men began to come up from various parts of the
camp until there was half a crowd around the place. It was then at
the beginning of the day's first greying; the wind had risen and
the rain fell harder. Evelyn, still restless, walked on back to her
cabin. She stuffed the stove with wood and lighted a lamp. Then,
scarcely hungry, she brewed a pot of coffee, found a strip of
cooked bacon from breakfast, and ate this with a bit of bread and a
dish of boiled apricots. She found herself listening for someone at
the door; but when somebody's knuckles <i>did</i> rap&mdash;-the hard
three raps of George von Stern's hand&mdash;a wave of shock went
disagreeably through her. She drew a breath, said, "Come in," and
watched him walk through the door.</p>

<p>He closed it and stepped toward her, the claylike gravity quite
pronounced on his face. She knew the sign of temper; he had made up
his mind on some subject and meant to bring it into the open. She
motioned toward the room's other chair. He shook his head. "No,
Evelyn. I want this settled. I've put in too many years at the
poker table not to know change when I see it. I want to know what's
changed with us."</p>

<p>She said, "Who was in the blacksmith shop&mdash;who'd they bring
in?"</p>

<p>"Just another dead man. A little bum. Potter. Somebody shot
him&mdash;over in Mulehide Gulch."</p>

<p>"The one Ad Carrico took away from the miners?" She remembered
the scene. "That's sad."</p>

<p>"What's sad about a man like that? For all the good he's done,
or for the use in him, he might as well not have been born."</p>

<p>"You've not got much sympathy, George. I'd think you would have,
seeing so much sadness in your saloon."</p>

<p>He still watched her, the somber shrewdness hanging on. "Where's
the change, Evelyn?"</p>

<p>The insistence pressed upon her until she felt herself cornered.
Her heart quickened. She had to push the words quickly out. "Don't
come here any more."</p>

<p>"Why? Is it Hugh?"</p>

<p>"Nothing's been said about that."</p>

<p>"But is it?"</p>

<p>"George, don't embarrass me by speaking of it to him."</p>

<p>"You know he's got his doubts, don't you?"</p>

<p>She said, "Yes," then added, "but how do you know? Have you two
talked about me?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Not necessary. I know what's in his
head."</p>

<p>A moment of hope made its lively break over her face. "George,
do you think you could say something to him to make that
straight?"</p>

<p>"From me?" he said. "Why should I do it? Would he believe me if
I did?"</p>

<p>She made a little gesture. "No, it wouldn't do. Never mind."</p>

<p>He plunged both fists into his pockets and stirred heavily
around the room and stopped in the corner behind her. "Evelyn," he
said, "you're not a woman to spend your time in a shanty. You were
made for beautiful clothes, a fine house, and all the trinkets.
It's all over you. I can do that&mdash;Rawson never will."</p>

<p>"Those are not the things I want most."</p>

<p>"They were once," he said. "In the beginning you were fond of
me."</p>

<p>"No, never quite. I was attracted. I thought about it&mdash;I've
thought about you until quite recently, but never the way you
wished."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Nobody can explain why that happens."</p>

<p>He stared at her and she thought she saw the slow dark fire in
this man brighten to a hotter emotion. She had suspected he could
be dangerous and now she was sure of it. He hadn't grace enough or
tolerance enough to be forgiving; he had so little of the humane
qualities. Nodding, he turned through the door.</p>

<p>He stood outside the door a moment and then returned to his
saloon. He saw Rawson at the bar and joined him. He motioned to the
barkeep, got bottle and glasses, and silently poured two drinks. He
made a short dip of the glass at Rawson, drank and pushed the
bottle aside.</p>

<p>"Never noticed you drink at this time of day," said Rawson.</p>

<p>"Always comes a time when a man gets damned good and tired of
his old habits." He laid his arms on the bar, resting the weight of
his upper body on them. He nodded toward the safe. "That thing's
getting full. New stuff's coming in, You want to put some of it in
your safe?"</p>

<p>"I'll work it down, trip by trip."</p>

<p>"Better start. I don't like to keep that much dust around."</p>

<p>"Already started," said Rawson. "I took ten thousand from
Easterline the other night and carried it horseback to Head of the
Mountain. Rheinmiller carried it through from there."</p>

<p>"Don't do that. If it's found out, you'll never ride anywhere
without the chance of being knocked over." He turned off to the
small room in the corner, shut the door, and began a steady
tramping back and forth, cigar smoldering between his teeth.</p>

<p>After von Stern's departure there was no more work left in
Evelyn. She sat a long while in the chair, reviewing the talk and
made unhappy by the inconsistency she must have shown George. The
scene had left her tired; yet the restlessness held on, and a
feeling of being adrift grew strong. She rose to make herself
coffee, and stood in the back room to drink it. But that didn't
help and she got into her coat and left the cabin. She hadn't
walked far in the rain, though, when she met Rawson, who had just
left the saloon. "Not at night, Evelyn&mdash;it's not quite that safe,"
he said.</p>

<p>He took her arm and walked her back to her cabin, She opened the
door, moved into it, and swung about, She wanted to talk to him,
she wanted the talk to go on and on until it came out that she had
broken with von Stern, but this was a more difficult thing than it
had been and she stood irritably helpless, yet smiling and wishing
to please him, "Where've you been?"</p>

<p>"Ramming around the hills,"</p>

<p>She said, "I've got to see Mrs. Jeffroy someday at Portuguese
Camp."</p>

<p>"If it's anything you want to take her, I'll do the chore for
you in the morning. I'm going in that direction."</p>

<p>"No, I just promised to go see her. Is the trail all right?"</p>

<p>"Good enough: I don't know that you ought to go alone."</p>

<p>"Then let me ride with you."</p>

<p>"I won't be back until late."</p>

<p>"I'll come back alone&mdash;or wait."</p>

<p>His expression told her he was thinking of von Stern.</p>

<p>She waited, strongly hoping he'd mention it; then she could tell
him. Instead he nodded and said, "It will be early. Five in the
morning."</p>

<p>"Come here first and I'll feed you."</p>

<p>"All right," he said. He remained a little longer, not anxious
to go and perhaps wishing to come in. But now she had to be careful
with him and she said, "Good night, Hugh," and closed the door. She
was unaccountably happy and looked at Mrs. Easterline's dress with
the first energy of the day within her. "Now, you," she said, and
sat down before it and began to work.</p>

<p>Rawson went into his cabin, walked directly out of it again by
way of the shed door, and stepped along the back side of several
cabins until he found a dark patch in the street, there crossing to
Easterline's Store: He entered the rear way and stood a moment in
the kitchen with Beth Easterline while the storekeeper filled a
pair of saddlebags with dust from the safe.</p>

<p>Mrs. Easterline said, "Could I make you some coffee?"</p>

<p>"I've had a drink of pretty decent liquor&mdash;straight from von
Stern's private bottle&mdash;and I want to keep the taste of it."</p>

<p>Easterline returned with the heavy saddlebags, and Rawson
dropped back into the darkness, retracing his route to his own
cabin. Bart Lennon was in the front room waiting for him. He
watched Rawson toss the saddlebags into the safe and spin the dial
on the door.</p>

<p>"I told von Stern tonight what I was doing," said Rawson.</p>

<p>"About this load?"</p>

<p>"No, about the last load. But if he's got a spotter he'll know
about this one."</p>

<p>"Hell's fire," said Lennon. "You've asked for trouble. If they
bushwhack you out in the timber, what good's it going to do you to
discover von Stern's a crook? You'll be dead."</p>

<p>"No I won't, Bart. Decided not to die."</p>

<p>Bart Lennon was not satisfied by the answer and sat with his
glumness showing. "Well, where you going to meet the stage
tomorrow? Head of the Mountain again?"</p>

<p>"Not that far. I'll be in the second stand of timber you pass
through beyond Miller's. That's about two o'clock. It takes us
beyond the marsh&mdash;and the marsh is the only spot I'm much worried
about."</p>

<p>"Don't lean too heavy on that. But this won't do. You've got to
make twenty trips by horse at this rate to pull the accumulated
dust out of Ophir. The odds against you get too damned heavy."</p>

<p>"This is the last one. Next trip we pile it all on the stage and
make a run of it."</p>

<p>"There's your county fair for certain."</p>

<p>"We'll have a crowd on the ride. You and I. I'll get Rheinmiller
to come through and ride back with us. We'll get another
couple."</p>

<p>"Find the other couple willing to do it," said Bart Lennon.
"That's your problem."</p>

<p>"Carrico and half-a-dozen troopers."</p>

<p>"Against Army regulations."</p>

<p>"To do it in the open, yes. But there's nothing in the book to
prevent his being at a certain place on the road at a certain
time."</p>

<p>"Where'll you have him be&mdash;the marsh? You can't be that sure
you're going to get hit there. It might be a long way off&mdash;then
Carrico's squatted in the wrong place, no help to you."</p>

<p>"There's only two places we can be hit," said Rawson. "We go
through the marsh by daylight, but there's cover enough there for
an attack to be made. Beyond that it's open country and daylight
all the way to Head of the Mountain&mdash;so we'll be let alone. That
leaves us in trouble during the night run, somewhere between Head
of the Mountain and the foot of the desert. There's your second
place. We can work it out. Carrico will be in the marsh at the time
we go through, hidden. If nothing happens to us, he can pull back
into the hills and be beyond Lasswell's waiting for us during the
night. He can follow us down the grade to the desert. That's all
the protection we need."</p>

<p>"Will he do it?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>Lennon got up. He said, "Your ride tomorrow I don't like. If I
don't see you at two o'clock, what am I to think?"</p>

<p>"Just keep on and forget about it. But I'll be there."</p>

<p>Lennon nodded and left the cabin. As he went down the street
toward his cabin he noticed the men in the blacksmith shop, but
passed by without stopping; and beyond Easterline's Store he saw a
single shadow against the stable wall, too obscure to be
identified. After he had gone on, the shadow moved away from the
stable and skirted Easterline's Store, the light of the store
catching Tilson's narrow cheeks and sprung body. Tilson reached the
saloon, stepped inside through the darkness to the rear door of the
saloon. He waited five minutes before von Stern came in from the
front.</p>

<p>"Rawson came out of Easterline's with a couple loaded
saddlebags. What's he doing?"</p>

<p>"Again?" said von Stern, and thought of it a heavy moment.
"That's dust he's carrying by horse."</p>

<p>"All the way through?"</p>

<p>"No, to the stage beyond Lasswell's."</p>

<p>"You want something done?"</p>

<p>"Leave it alone. It's small stuff."</p>

<p>"Small or not&mdash;it's dust," said Tilson.</p>

<p>"He knows I know about it. If he's held up he'd figure it came
from me." Then he froze into a long motionlessness, his glance
pushing into Tilson with a surprised farsighted expression. "And
that's why he told me. By God, laying a trap for me. No, leave that
alone."</p>

<p>Tilson, leaving the saloon, crossed the creek to his lean-to
stable and stood within its shelter a short time. He had his orders
from von Stern, yet he couldn't take his mind from the saddlebags,
<i>Little or big, dust is dust</i>. Why let it go by? This could be
his own private deal, nobody the wiser.</p>

<p>He climbed the hill to the rim corral, brought down the calico,
saddled it, and left it in the lean-to; then he crossed the creek
and cruised along the street, to look through Rawson's window as he
passed. Rawson was still inside. At the livery stable he turned
against the wall, squatted in the thick shadows, and calmed himself
for however long a wait he had to endure.</p>

<p><br>
The rain had quit during the night, but the sky at five-thirty was
so thick with heavy clouds that daylight had yet to break through.
They climbed the gulch trail and rode immediately into the dense
black of the timber.</p>

<p>He said, "You have a heavy coat? It'll rain again. Not a good
day for a trip."</p>

<p>"I had to get out of camp."</p>

<p>A dismal dawn crept into the hills an hour later and he swung on
the saddle to find her watching the mealy shadows with her pleased
interest. She wore a plaid coat whose collar rose around her cheeks
like the dark petals of a flower. The wet morning laid its film on
her face, her eyes were sharp blue in this low light, and she had
an expression about her eyes and mouth which always attracted
him&mdash;a light gravity ready to break into smiling.</p>

<p>They came upon the burn and stopped a bit for the view, the
valley below overhung by low clouds now spilling out rain. He swung
wider in the saddle to watch her. "Big raindrop running down your
cheek. You'd look beautiful crying."</p>

<p>"Never cry. That's weak nerves. I'm strong as a horse."</p>

<p>"I didn't say it right anyhow. Things show around the mouth, not
on the eyes."</p>

<p>They rode on to the Portuguese Camp turnoff. They turned into
the gulch, followed the winding trail for two miles and came upon a
settlement of six cabins, all but two abandoned and stripped of
their chimneys, squatted in the gravel piles and stumps of a once
flourishing camp. Played out, there was nothing here now but Pearl
Jeffroy and her husband. She stood in her doorway as they came up,
a very dark woman past middle age in a nondescript dress; her face
was smooth, her eyes alert and prying, her expression younger than
her years.</p>

<p>She said, in greatest pleasure, "Now, Evelyn, I just knew it. I
can tell when somebody's comin' up that trail. I can just tell,
long before I ever see 'em." A heavier rain began to break around
them. "You come right in." Then she looked to Rawson. "I know you.
You drive the stage." She passed her glance from Evelyn to Rawson
and a warm suspicion began to delight her.</p>

<p>Rawson got down to help Evelyn from the saddle. He said, "I
ought to be back by six. We could make it to Ophir by nine."</p>

<p>"I'll wait for you."</p>

<p>The brown woman said, "We'll fix a good supper," and her
attention clung to Rawson as he went back to his saddle and rode
back along the trail. Without looking to Evelyn, she asked. "Your
man?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You want him?"</p>

<p>Evelyn laughed. "Why, Mrs. Jeffroy!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>PART 2.</h2>

<p class="first">RAWSON spotted the man's tracks as soon as he came
upon them for with him, as with any riding man, the day and its
changes was a book of great interest, whose sometimes cryptic
passages challenged his ability to understand them, The extra horse
prints were mixed with those of Evelyn's and his own; the fact that
they came this far and turned abruptly back was a warning he obeyed
at once by pushing the horse into the timber. From that sheltered
place he noted that the stranger's tracks moved up the trail at a
walk and retreated at a run. That horse had small feet; small
horse, maybe small man.</p>

<p>He could not be sure he was being trailed, but with the gold in
the saddlebags, it was the only guess he could safely make.
Probably the fellow had spotted him coming down from the Jeffroy
house and wanted to draw back a distance to get set for a jump. He
pulled farther back into the trees and searched for a passable way
through them, The rain made some racket and the wind rustled up
small echoes in the pine tops, these sounds covering whatever noise
his horse made. Water sprayed him when he shoved aside the
overhanging pine branches; the horse flinched as this cold stuff
struck and, making no sense of such blind progress, wheeled back
toward the trail. Rawson shoved it on. As he fell downgrade at this
slow gait he watched the area to the left, and he passed each tree
carefully, and swept each new vista, and moved on with his nerves
losing their slack.</p>

<p>Half an hour&mdash;a very long half-hour&mdash;brought him to the main
Ophir trail. Rain mist dropped down until this silver haze cloaked
both trail and timber beyond a hundred feet and though the
Portuguese Camp turnoff was less than that distance to his left, he
couldn't see it. He thought: <i>What would I do if I were that
fellow!</i> He put himself into the man's skin; he became a man
hunting another man. That wasn't satisfactory; there were too many
variations. Going to the right, he skirted the trail until he was
well away from the Portuguese Camp turnoff; then he crossed the
main trail quickly, swung left and threaded the trees until he
stood directly across from the turnoff, looking along it for a
matter of a hundred feet.</p>

<p>He saw the man's tracks come down to the main trail and swing
into it, but here they made a churned pattern on the spongy ground
and disappeared in the pines across the way. That meant nothing,
The man now knew he'd been spotted. The surprise was gone. What
would he, do now&mdash;quit or drift on and try for a fresh surprise?
Rawson, having himself to make a decision, gave his horse a sharp
spur, and rushed over the main trail into the farther timber,
muscles stiffened against a half-expected shot.</p>

<p>He relaxed with difficulty and moved forward, following the
print of the man's horse in the soft forest humus. At the end of
three hundred yards he was still skirting the trail and from that
he judged the man meant to drift in this manner; out of sight yet
commanding the trail for whatever might come along.</p>

<p>Before him as he so slowly cruised, the foot of Mulehide's east
ridge appeared, making a kind of bluff against the trail, and
presently he faced its side and saw it rise, timber continuing with
it, to a commanding point. Here he stopped. The prints of the
unknown man avoided the slope, seemed now to pass into the trail,
apparently electing the easy route around the ridge foot. Yet, as
he looked at that high ground, Rawson, became uneasy with it.</p>

<p>His slicker was unbuttoned and his .44 hung close at hand in its
holster. He reached forward to pull the rifle from its saddle boot
and lay it across his lap. The more he studied the bluff, the more
definite its risk seemed; but his restlessness rose up and he
thought: <i>The hell with waiting,</i> and angled deeper into the
timber to approach the ridge by a more covered route.</p>

<p>The timber was still with him as he struck the face of the ridge
and began to climb, but within fifty feet of the summit he was
exposed in a stand of young seedlings. He swung to gain better
shelter and, at that moment, the sense of danger close by was as
real as the scent of a dead carcass. He bent far down in the
saddle, and kicked the horse into a run. The shot's echo came
before he got his heels out of the horse's flank, the bullet's
track certainly wasn't far behind him, and the slug slapped a tree
close at hand. His horse had urging enough and went up the rest of
the grade in long, grunting lunges, passing behind a better screen
of small trees.</p>

<p>He went out of the saddle, struck the ground on his knees and
crouched there an instant, remembering how the shot had sounded and
from what quarter it had seemed to come. He rose to slide through
the small pines until he had a view of the broken and partially
clear area directly ahead. At the far side of this open space, in a
similar thicket of young pines and with his back to the drop-off to
the trail, the man somewhere lay waiting for a second shot. The
rain meanwhile had thickened and the light was too poor for decent
seeing. Rawson took his short look, and ran back to the horse. He
retreated far enough into the timber to give himself protection,
rode down the far side of the ridge, and worked his way through a
rough gully to the trail.</p>

<p>He was now behind the man, and followed the trail back until he
saw the small bluff, the young trees crowding its edge and the
shape of a spotted horse zigzagging down the side of the bluff. The
horse was plain in the muddy light, the runt-sized calico beast
belonging to Tilson, and the man sat crouched and bobbing in the
saddle. On that jumping target Rawson threw his bullet. The miss
was what he expected, since his own horse shook him with its run.
By the time he was ready for a second try, Tilson was in the
shelter of the timber, rushing on.</p>

<p>Rawson came up, turned, and followed the man in. He saw Tilson's
swaying back disappear behind the screening pines and he sent a
whooping cry after the man. He was roused, he was careless, he
wanted a kill. A branch caught him across the face, carried away
his hat and shook him so hard on the saddle that, half out of it,
he tightened the reins; the checked horse stumbled, went half down
and threw Rawson clear.</p>

<p>He landed on one shoulder, feet high in the air, the rifle still
in his band; momentum carried him onward and the muzzle of the
rifle cracked him across the head and when he came to a stop he was
on his hands and knees, looking directly at the rotten bark of a
deadfall. He was stunned; he tasted blood and saw it dripping on
his hand. He was shaking, not from the fall but from a continuing
anger, and, when he heard the pulpy echoes of Tilson's horse
returning, he thought, <i>Thinks he's got a cripple,</i> and, stood
up from the shelter of the log. <i>If this muzzle's jammed with
dirt,</i> he thought, <i>I'm in a hell of a fix.</i> Tilson and the
calico were drifting, in and out of his sight, past one tree into a
clear alley, past another tree. The man had his gun, raised,
waiting for a shot. Rawson had neither time to look at the muzzle
of his own gun nor caution enough to care. He stepped aside as he
took aim, saw the man's gun swing and stepped aside again. He fired
directly into the sound of the other man's gun, the two sounds
making a single stairstep explosion. Afterwards, in, furious
disappointment, Rawson saw Tilson wheel and run.</p>

<p>It was late when Rawson reached Portuguese Camp, a single light
from Mrs. Jeffroy's cabin towing him on. He got down, gave the door
a drum with his knuckles.</p>

<p>"It's Rawson," he said and led his horse to the rear shed and
tied and unsaddled it.</p>

<p>When he returned, Evelyn was at the doorway.</p>

<p>"I knew you were in trouble somewhere," she said, and pulled him
into the cabin.</p>

<p>She was dressed. The older woman, half ready for bed, had thrown
on a wrap as florid as a thousand sunsets, against which her plain
brown face and pulled-back coarse grey hair made a considerable
contrast. Her lively glance surveyed him, and darted to Evelyn. She
said, "We had a nice supper, too. Well, some of it's left, and
warm. Jeffroy's sleeping in the other cabin."</p>

<p>She clucked her tongue at the wetness of his upper body and the
pools of water collecting around his soaked boots. "You'll need a
strong dryin' out. There's no stove in the cabin where Jeffroy's
sleepin'." Her eyes turned their innocence on Evelyn. "So then I'll
sleep with Jeffroy. You sleep in the bed, Evelyn, and he can keep
to the kitchen. That's modesty enough this far back in the hills.
The goose-down quilt will make a mattress." She opened the door
and, as an afterthought, she said, "There's a bottle of poor
whiskey under the bed," and the narrowing gap of the doorway
bracketed her laughing eyes.</p>

<p>Evelyn said, "We won't do the dishes tonight. Are you dry?"</p>

<p>He wore one of Jeffroy's shirts, his own steaming behind the
stove; he stood barefooted with his back to the fire, the meal and
the whiskey giving him a wonderful looseness. He moved his boots
farther from the fire. "They'll be iron by morning."</p>

<p>"What happened to you?"</p>

<p>"Tilson was following us. I saw his tracks and had a run for it
but I never got him cornered."</p>

<p>She said, "Did you suspect him?"</p>

<p>"I had him in my mind. Nothing sure&mdash;but he was one of the men I
put on the wrong side of the ledger when I was thinking about it in
Portland."</p>

<p>"How many do you have in the ledger?"</p>

<p>"Not many. It's rough to suspect people."</p>

<p>She went into the front room and took the top quilt from her bed
and returned to spread it on the kitchen floor. "You're tired
enough to be discouraged. It'll be better in the morning. You know,
I've never seen you discouraged before."</p>

<p>"Until now," he said, "I never amounted to enough to be
discouraged."</p>

<p>"What are you now that you weren't before? I want to know. What
was it that happened to you? It must have been in Portland."</p>

<p>"I thought too much." He shook his head. "I sound like a damned
fool. I'd like another drink. Drink with me."</p>

<p>She got the bottle, half-filled his cup, and measured herself a
sparing drink. He circled his finger through the air, prompting
her. "A little more in mine&mdash;and in yours, That stuff kills the
good and the bad alike. It's the bad I'd like to rub out now."</p>

<p>"What particular bad?" Her eyes were deeper blue than indigo;
the expression in them could have been anything he wanted to
believe, anything in the whole run of things, top to bottom. She
was von Stern's woman, she was nobody's woman. It was innocence he
saw there, or the devil; he didn't know and never had known and
though he wanted to know, it wasn't likely he'd ever find out. He
drank the whiskey straight down and motioned again to her. "Don't
sip at it, Let it slide all at once. That's what it's for."</p>

<p>She finished, mouth pressed tight, eyes closed, body shuddering.
She laid the cup on the table and opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Each time I think about you," he said, "I think the same thing.
You're like that cut-glass bowl in the Klickitat Hotel. The light
breaks against it and comes back brighter than before. The light
goes in one color and comes back every color."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "you're reading things into me you want to read,
making a mystery of nothing. Men do that more than women. That's
why they get disappointed sooner than women. A husband expects too
much. Then he finds it's not there, and he quits expecting
anything."</p>

<p>"Your eyes are peaceful, but your mouth isn't. You're some of
this and some of that&mdash;you're anything you want to be."</p>

<p>"I'm twenty-three and nothing you can't understand. I ought to
have fifty nice years of living in me. If I'm lucky, maybe that's
the way it'll be. It's so uncertain. I wouldn't dare hope for as
much as you do. I expect less, but I'll be much happier with it
than you'll be." The serenity was disturbed by a gathering
discontent. "You talk about a woman's eyes and mouth. Let me tell
you something. When you get interested in a woman, you'd better
trust what you see in her eyes, or her lips will taste very bitter
to you." She changed the subject. "Who's on the wrong side of your
ledger, Hugh?"</p>

<p>He thought: <i>How do I tell her this&mdash;I ought to tell her.</i>
But he said, "Half the men in camp. Hard to sort 'em out."</p>

<p>"You're lying to me."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I'm lying."</p>

<p>"I wish you trusted me."</p>

<p>"It isn't that at all."</p>

<p>Then she was certain he had George von Stern on the list and she
was sorry enough for him to cry; she wanted to reach out and touch
him, so acute was the feeling of pity, "I know you've got some
friends on that list. That's why you don't want to say anything.
Friendship's a way of being blind, Hugh. If any of them are in
this, they never were your friends."</p>

<p>"I know,"</p>

<p>"Don't let sympathy or loyalty, or anything like that, make you
soft about it."</p>

<p>He rubbed his hands together in a slow circular motion.</p>

<p>His head dropped and his hair, still damp, glittered against the
lamplight. Jeffroy's shirt was much too small on him; it cramped
his motions. He said. "Never killed a man. Driving stage, you think
what you'd do if the thing came to that. But thinking and doing are
two different things. Still, I know what I'll do."</p>

<p>"Do it well."</p>

<p>He looked up to her, interested rather than surprised. "When the
bets go down," he said, "I believe a woman's tougher than a
man."</p>

<p>She stood up swaying; she supported herself on the table and
surprise quickened the laughter on her face. "You and your whiskey.
Help me. Or can you?"</p>

<p>He rose from the wood box, where he had been sitting, to catch
her arm. She moved uncertainly to the bed in the front room; she
sat down, and looked to him. "Oh, Hugh," she sighed and slowly
dropped on her side, curling small. "It was a nice party. Who was
it for?"</p>

<p>"You can't sleep that way."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of it."</p>

<p>She put her hands together and slid them under her cheek; she
turned her head to watch him with an oblique attention. Sweetness
was thick around her mouth, but her eyes were alleys of darkness
leading back into her mind and he saw nothing there but shadow. She
was a contradiction.</p>

<p>"You're all right?"</p>

<p>"I hope so. I am, aren't I? Don't you do this to me again." Her
expression became wary. "Why did you? You scheming?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Men do scheme."</p>

<p>"So do women."</p>

<p>"That's different. There's a purpose to it." She withdrew a hand
from beneath her cheek and pointed to the kitchen. "You go. Blow
out the light. Don't burn yourself on the stove."</p>

<p>He settled on his heels so that his face was at the level of her
face. The tunneled expression grew more pronounced in her eyes, She
shook her head. "You don't believe in me."</p>

<p>"When a bullet kills a man, it could kill a lot of other things
it didn't mean to touch."</p>

<p>She was thinking: <i>That's as close as he'll come. It's not
close enough, for if I tell him what I believe about George, he'll
think I'm not faithful to anything.</i> She shut her eyes and saw
no way out of the trap.</p>

<p>He said, "Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"I hear. You just do what you've got to do."</p>

<p>He laid both hands on the edge of the bed to steady himself. He
looked long at her, giving himself away. When he swayed forward she
drew a hand across her mouth as a gate. She shook her head and her
eyes were as wide as they could become.</p>

<p>"Please," he said.</p>

<p>She moved her shoulders; the hand fell aside. "You ought not use
so nice a voice on me. It's unscrupulous."</p>

<p>His mouth came in to shut off the rest of her talk. He kept his
hands at the edge of the bed, he held back the rush of his feeling
and kept himself gentle. Her head stirred, brushing her mouth
across his mouth; he drew away before his wishes grew more
demanding, as he knew they would. "That's the truth of the matter,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Damn you," she said, so mild, so far away from him, "now you're
against me forever."</p>

<p>He rose, uncertain, reluctant to leave. He said, "I don't
follow."</p>

<p>"Go away. Turn out the light."</p>

<p>He walked into the other room and whipped his hand over the lamp
chimney. The stove's red compound eyes brightly watched him; the
cabin shook to the rough wind and intermittent gusts of rain dashed
against the outer wall. He settled on the quilt, hearing nothing
from her. "Evelyn&mdash;undress and get under the blankets."</p>

<p>"I am. Will you be too hot there?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He heard her small, whispering laughter. Then she drew a long
breath. "It was nice."</p>

<p>He said, "Mrs. Jeffroy will be disappointed."</p>

<p>The rhythm of the storm swung him to sleep.</p>

<p>Rawson had just left Evelyn at her own cabin, the next day, when
Carrico came into sight, striding forward. Rawson turned the horses
into the stable and waited. He took Carrico's arm. "I want to talk
to you."</p>

<p>Carrico walked with Rawson to the latter's cabin and sat in
silence, none of his arched confidence about him, while Rawson
lighted a fire. His delft blue eyes lacked their usual sparkle and,
though his features were much too open and boyish to hold anything
like a sullen expression, his shadowed spirit outwardly stained him
with a discontented gloom.</p>

<p>Rawson stood at the stove, looking back. "Too much riding,
Ad?"</p>

<p>Carrico shrugged his shoulders. "It's the futility of
it&mdash;kicking these Indians from place to place for the damned greed
of a few prospectors. Who eventually gets the gold? Von Stern and
the storekeepers, So I am nothing better than von Stern's houseman
riding around in brass buttons."</p>

<p>"It's one race against another, Ad. It's happened before&mdash;one
pushes and one dies. Maybe someday there'll be some other race
driving us over the cliff&mdash;and that will be justice to please you,
when you see it from your place underneath the apple trees of
heaven." He smiled at his next thought. "Seated beside some pretty
woman."</p>

<p>"Is that my reputation?" asked Carrico, wistfully. "Am I so
damned transparent?"</p>

<p>"A beautiful woman is the music you'll always dance to."</p>

<p>"Not anybody's beauty," protested Carrico. "Not every cheap
little beast or lifted skirt hem. I'm not an entire fool." He sat
forward in the chair, shoulders down, arms rested across his knees;
and the onset of difficult thought made its creases across a
forehead seldom broken by such lines.</p>

<p><i>Carrico</i>, thought Rawson, <i>was a boy when he should long
since have been a man.</i> "Ad, I'm going to take the dust through
next trip, That's Tuesday morning."</p>

<p>Carrico took a moment to reshape his thoughts. "All the dust?
Hell of a big package."</p>

<p>"I'll have Lennon, Rheinmiller, and maybe one other man riding
with me. It might be enough&mdash;but if they laid the trap right, it
might not be. I need your help. Can you give it?"</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I'll leave here the usual time; six in the morning. The place I
expect trouble is in the marsh. Could you drift down from your camp
before daylight with a half-a-dozen men very quietly and wait in
the timber by Pennoyer's until we arrive? Then follow us through
the marsh?"</p>

<p>"Be careful. Always assume the enemy's trying to out-think you.
Your attention has been drawn to the marsh&mdash;which might be a
deliberate plan. Next time you may get hit elsewhere."</p>

<p>"The marsh is a perfect hiding spot."</p>

<p>"I'd not want to use it. It can be surrounded&mdash;and there I'd be,
cut off until I had to come out or starve."</p>

<p>"A regiment couldn't surround it," said Rawson. "And ten
regiments couldn't penetrate the place. If we're held up by
daylight, that's the only logical spot. If it's to be at night,
they might wait until we're beyond Lasswell's in the mountains.
Follow us through the marsh with your detachment," said Rawson.
"Then disappear, but meet us after dark, when we leave Lasswell's,
and keep us company down the mountain to the desert. The rest is
safe."</p>

<p>"Is there any other possible place of attack?"</p>

<p>"Not in Deer Valley by daylight. There's no cover. Not in the
desert. No cover there either. No, it will be the marsh by
daylight, or in the mountains after dark. The timing is important.
You'll be at Pennoyer's when we get there&mdash;and at Head of the
Mountain as soon as dark comes?"</p>

<p>"My word on it," said Carrico. "How's your leg?"</p>

<p>"Still lame."</p>

<p>"We're a pair of cripples," said Carrico ruefully. "Your leg and
my spirits." He moved toward the door. "Perhaps I'm depressed
because I have my orders for change of station. On the first of the
month I report to Fort Whipple, Arizona."</p>

<p>Rawson shook his head. "I'll hate to see you go."</p>

<p>"We'll get drunk on that," promised Carrico. "I've told nobody
else yet, so keep it confidential." He drew a deep breath. "It will
be difficult to break it&mdash;to at least one other person."</p>

<p>Out on the street, he moved past Easterline's casually, but
didn't look toward the store; he stepped into the stable for a
moment, left it, and crossed to Evelyn's and knocked on the door.
Her voice invited him in. As he opened the door and stepped
through, he swung to see Beth Easterline cloaked against the
weather, come from the store. Her glance caught him; he nodded,
closed the door, and removed his forage cap before Evelyn.</p>

<p>She had been at work before the dummy; paused now, she watched
him, smiling but critical. She shook her head. "Ad&mdash;Ad."</p>

<p>He colored, straightened, and dressed his shoulders as though he
were at ease on the parade ground, hands and cap behind him. "I
wish," he said, "you didn't think so poorly of me."</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;I don't at all."</p>

<p>"Give me credit for knowing something about women's thoughts."
He became easier and his blue eyes openly appreciated her. "Here I
am, maybe a rascal in some respects, knowing you a good deal better
than Rawson does, who is no rascal at all. I guess the rascals
always do know women better."</p>

<p>"A man who makes a profession of women ought to learn something
about them."</p>

<p>"There's your opinion of me. It jumped right out of you. You may
be right. What I wanted to say was that I'd trust you completely,
I'd never question anything about you. I wish Hugh knew as well as
I do how honest you are. But he thinks about George&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the need of talking about it, Ad?" Then she changed her
mind. "No, talk about it. Perhaps you can do me some good."</p>

<p>"Well, you want him."</p>

<p>She said restlessly: "Don't make it sound so naked, so
predatory."</p>

<p>"Evelyn," he said in his kindest manner, "suppose a fight comes
on and it turns out Hugh kills George&mdash;the man you liked very well
once and may still like as a friend. Then how would it be with you
and Hugh?"</p>

<p>"I'm surprised you don't know the answer. I think I could kill
George myself, if he aimed at Hugh. Women don't split their
loyalties like that."</p>

<p>He said, slowly, "Then you know George may be in this?"</p>

<p>"I've sensed it. Is Hugh certain?"</p>

<p>"I believe he is. There are only so many people in this camp who
can be suspected. Evelyn&mdash;there's nothing left of George in your
system? Nothing?" When she shook her head he shrugged his
shoulders. "I wish Hugh knew it. I like you two very much."</p>

<p>"Can you think of anything I can do?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "That's what people always do to each other&mdash;make
confusion they can't clear up." He turned to the door and laid a
hand on the latch, looking back with his half-smiling regret. "What
I wished to discover was whether or not you knew George was
involved. That's the way it looks. There'll be trouble, rather
soon. I'm afraid of it."</p>

<p>He walked directly to the stable, got his horse and rode up the
cemetery trail through the rain-sliced gloom. He made no pretense
at subterfuge, but went directly to the cabin and stepped inside.
Mrs. Easterline stood in the cold and empty place with a restless
disfavor on her face. "You've been long enough." When he closed the
door he could scarcely see her; she swung swiftly into his arms,
her hands pulling his shoulders toward her with impatience.
Presently he broke the kiss and removed his overcoat and spread it
on the cabin's dirt floor. Settling on it, she held his arms and
brought him with her; a great, relieved breath came out of her.
"You needn't make such a game of going to Evelyn Harvey's."</p>

<p>"We ought to keep some caution. The more you and I get along
with this, the more we ignore everybody else."</p>

<p>"Is that so wrong?"</p>

<p>"Not wrong&mdash;but the camp's not blind."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, carelessly, "never mind the camp."</p>

<p>He slid his hand under her head, he felt her breath warm on his
cheeks. Her features were vague before him, her hand was at his
back. He said, "I wish I could see your face."</p>

<p>"It's here&mdash;it's yours&mdash;you can guess what's on it. Someday it
will be an old woman's face, no use to anybody, wrinkled and dry.
I'm glad you see me as I am now. I wish&mdash;I wish you'd leave a
bruise, a scar, on my mouth. I really wish so. Then I'd have it. A
memory, Ad."</p>

<p>He dropped his head to her mouth and they lay silent; yet the
coldness of the cabin got into him, and his heart's warmth was
less, and his mind stood apart from this scene and saw it too
critically. It was her hand's insistence that broke the affair. He
remembered other hands which had pressed, other eyes in which the
upleap of raw fire had burned away the shadowed mystery he
worshiped, other lips suddenly turned from tenderness to heat. He
had come to another ending and the very moment he knew it his body
lost something. She knew it, too, for she drew back her head.</p>

<p>"You're not comfortable?"</p>

<p>"It's all right."</p>

<p>A rising concern sharpened her voice until it was almost
unpleasant to him. "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>He said: "I'm sad, Beth. I've got my transfer orders."</p>

<p>In the six o'clock darkness of a bad day, Rawson walked to the
saloon, got a bottle and glass, and settled at a table. Von Stern
joined him presently; this was as though nothing had happened
between them, von Stern carrying on his affable part well. He said,
"You want something to eat?" and waved a finger at the bar. He
dipped his whiskey glass to Rawson; over the rim of the glass his
eyes were direct and chilly. The barkeep brought two plates over
and came back with cups and a coffeepot.</p>

<p>"Anything new?"</p>

<p>"No," said Rawson. "Not much."</p>

<p>"Riding around?"</p>

<p>"Took another trip with a pair of full saddlebags."</p>

<p>"I don't think that's wise."</p>

<p>"The last one," said Rawson.</p>

<p>"That's good," said von Stern and went at his meal. Evening's
crowd moved into the saloon and the air grew warm and close with
its smell of sweat, tobacco and wet wool. "My God," said von Stern,
"I smell it in my sleep. It will be a good thing when I get away
from it."</p>

<p>Rawson set back his plate, drank his coffee, and sat idle a
moment, debating the wisdom of warning von Stern. He had decided to
do so; now the thoughts were coming in again, the dampening layers
of uncertainty, of wonder at his own judgment; and, suddenly he
grew disgusted with them. His original idea had come straight out
of impulse. <i>Then go on with it.</i> "George, let's step into
your back room."</p>

<p>Von Stern was too controlled a man to exhibit any definite
reaction. "Certainly," he said, and rose and led the way. "Want a
rye chaser for those beans?"</p>

<p>"No." Rawson worked on his pipe and lighted it. He swung half
around the room, hands plunged into his pockets, and came about to
confront von Stern. "Monday night I'll move all the dust from your
safe and Easterline's over to mine. It goes out Tuesday
morning.</p>

<p>"That's a heavy slug for one trip."</p>

<p>"I'll have four men riding shotgun in the coach."</p>

<p>"You still can be caught off balance. Might be half-a-dozen men
waiting for you around the wrong bend of the road. Might be ten.
Might be a dozen."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. There could be three. There could be four. At
a stretch, five. But that's the extent at the crowd, I'm
certain."</p>

<p>"What else you certain of?" asked von Stern, and fell to work
trimming a cigar.</p>

<p>"They can't make it, George."</p>

<p>"That's a flat statement," said von Stern. "Nobody can be so
sure."</p>

<p>"I'll make another statement. They won't live through it."</p>

<p>"You had some luck, once. Don't lean on it." Von Stern lighted
the cigar and came about, his full stare striking Rawson.</p>

<p>"I wish they wouldn't try. Some of these men I know."</p>

<p>Von Stern settled into the room's one chair, facing Rawson. He
blew a great breath of smoke before him, and another, until the
smoke was an uneasy screen through which he stared. Nothing more
could happen to his face; it had settled as far as flesh or bone
would let it. The change Rawson saw was a thing of small shadings
coming from inside, a truculence, a contempt, a willful man's
disposition fixing itself. Now, Rawson thought, he understands what
I'm telling him.</p>

<p>"You damned fool," said von Stern, making no fuss with the
words. "I like you. I did what I could to keep you out of it&mdash;but
you've got to get into it. I never thought much of your brains. I
don't now."</p>

<p>"All right, George. I made a mistake coming here."</p>

<p>"You did," said von Stern. "A sucker move for a greenhorn. You
just can't play poker in fast company." He sat passive, his stare
pushing against Rawson with its mud-dark strangeness. "As for
Evelyn&mdash;you've got her, if it does you any good. Damn a man that
breaks up another man's run and changes a woman's mind."</p>

<p>"Did she say that?"</p>

<p>"She came back from Portuguese Camp to give me my time. What did
you do up there?"</p>

<p>"That will be all, George."</p>

<p>"I guess that's all we've got to say to each other," said von
Stern.</p>

<p>"It was too much, George," said Rawson. "I'm not sorry for you
any more." He waited a moment, curious to find in the big man's
face the trace of some spirit which justified his old-time
affection. He saw nothing. He had no regret and found none anywhere
on George, and he left with the knowledge that friendship could die
and leave nothing, not the least memory, behind.</p>

<p>Late Sunday night the inbound stage rolled before Von Stern's,
Lennon driving and Barney Rheinmiller riding beside him. From the
coach stepped a single passenger, lowering his short and over-fat
body carefully to the ground; it was Mulvey, overcoat thickening
him to even more impossible dimensions, rifle crooked under an arm
as though he were a hunter. The mail was thrown down, the reins
tossed to the stable hostler.</p>

<p>Rawson joined the three. "What you here for?" he asked
Mulvey.</p>

<p>"To ride back with you fellows."</p>

<p>"You don't make the load any lighter."</p>

<p>"Just give me something to draw a bead on," said Mulvey, "and
I'll pay my freight. I'm dry, I'm hungry, and these two crazy
drivers ain't left me a solid bone."</p>

<p>They walked into von Stern's for a drink, and for beans and beef
from the lunch counter. Lennon saw von Stern across the room and
nodded; the cool nod he got back interested him. "George got a sore
corn?"</p>

<p>Rawson nodded and, after eating, moved to his cabin with the
three. He stoked the fire while the others settled themselves
around the main room. Mulvey found a quart of whiskey in his coat
and placed it on the table. "I don't drink mining-camp liquor if I
can help it." He threw the coat in a corner; he noted the single
bunk in the kitchen. "So I guess I sleep in my coat on the
floor."</p>

<p>"Jake," said Rawson, "this may be rough; You're past such
business. Shouldn't be along."</p>

<p>"Damn the pure arrogance of young men," said Mulvey, mildly.
"You think the world's made just for you, and anybody past
forty-five's supposed to shoot himself."</p>

<p>Rawson shook his head. "You're just talking, You shouldn't be in
this party."</p>

<p>Lennon still had his mind on von Stern. "What's wrong with
George?"</p>

<p>"He's the man," said Rawson. "And he knows I know it."</p>

<p>Lennon said, "How does he know you know it?"</p>

<p>"I talked to him last night."</p>

<p>Mulvey said, "You tipped it? For the love of sweet God,
why?"</p>

<p>"To let him back out and call off the showdown."</p>

<p>Lennon said, "You still got some pity in your system for
George."</p>

<p>"Not now. He had his warning. He won't call it off. There'll be
a fight&mdash;you can count on it&mdash;and we've got to break that crowd for
good. I want it ended. Don't want to be ducking bullets every trip
the rest of the summer!"</p>

<p>"Let's talk how we're going to do it," said Mulvey.</p>

<p>"Start Tuesday morning and go straight through. Carrico will
meet us with six troopers at Pennoyer's and go through the marsh
with us. Then he'll fade, but pick us up again beyond Lasswell's
and follow us down the mountain to the desert. The rest is open
country."</p>

<p>"That's good," said Mulvey, and rose. "Let's have a drink." He
scouted the kitchen for cups and came back to pour a round, filling
his own cup three-quarters full. "That's for the quality of the
driving I've put up with."</p>

<p>Rheinmiller said, "how many men goin' to shoot at us?"</p>

<p>"Miller, a stranger with Miller and Tilson. That's all I'm
certain of."</p>

<p>Lennon shook his head. "That's sendin' a boy after a man.
They'll do better than three."</p>

<p>Mulvey said, "Von Stern knows Carrico's your friend. Might guess
Carrico will help, mightn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So he must have an ace buried. It'd help to know what it
is."</p>

<p>After Monday's breakfast, the four of them began the chore of
transferring the dust from Easterline's and von Stern's to Rawson's
cabin. They laid the buckskin pokes on the table, one propped
against another, each with its owner's tag tied to it.</p>

<p>"That's too much for one express box," said Rawson. "We couldn't
lift it, all four of us."</p>

<p>He went to Easterline's and brought back a load of wooden boxes,
with a hammer, a saw, and two pounds of small nails. It took the
rest of the morning to rebuild the boxes, pack the pokes into them,
and nail on the covers. In addition to the express box, they had
five small boxes, each weighing better than a hundred pounds,
Mulvey eased himself into a chair and put his feet on a box. Lennon
said, "That's no manners to show a young fortune."</p>

<p>"Never understood the stuff," said Mulvey, "and don't now. Who
started the idea that gold was worth anything? It's all in the
head."</p>

<p>"Because it's hard to get," said Lennon.</p>

<p>"I know things harder to get."</p>

<p>Stepping outside, Rawson saw Carrico coming down the zigzag
trail on the south gulch wall. He waited for Carrico and when the
lieutenant stabled the horse and walked forward, Rawson took his
arm and walked with him. "The only thing I want to know," he said
to Carrico, "is that you'll be at Pennoyer's when we get
there."</p>

<p>"I'll leave here after dark tonight, go back, and pick up the
men and be at Pennoyer's before you arrive. Why don't I escort you
straight through from here?"</p>

<p>"Nothing will happen short of Pennoyer's. It's too close to
Ophir and there'd be no surprise. I want to catch these fellows off
guard and end the thing."</p>

<p>"Who do you think it is, Hugh?"</p>

<p>"George."</p>

<p>"That's bad. A lot of things go down the chute."</p>

<p>"I wonder how many."</p>

<p>At six o'clock, the morning lights of camp glittered through
rain and shadow and a dozen men stood on the street to watch the
coach go. This amused Lennon, he riding shotgun guard beside
Rawson. "Reminds me of women filing past the coffin before the
lid's put on. Sin and death draws everybody; they're closer to us
than anything else. These fellows expect to say they saw us the
morning we started on our last ride." A misting rain cloaked the
camp as soon as they reached the foot of the gulch and entered the
short valley whose ponds of rain water cast off a low shining. The
first hills were a muddy streak ahead. "It could come quick," said
Lennon, "It could be on the first ridge."</p>

<p>"Too close to camp."</p>

<p>"Don't know how they'd lug away this much in gold if they got
it."</p>

<p>Mulvey's cursing came up from the coach. It had been his idea to
lash the boxes on the seats against the side panels of the coach,
to provide added protection; gouged by their sharp corners, he made
his discontent known. Half across the valley, a first light began
to silhouette the ridge ahead and when they got to it, thirty
minutes later, the road was a grey tunnel through dripping black
timber. A small gust of wind ran over the treetops, discharging
sheets of bough-collected waters upon them. Lennon wiped his face
and, catching sight of an obscure shadow, raised his rifle on it
until it faded behind. Little by little, pines took independent
shape. Two hours out of Ophir the day moved in, heavy mist breaking
against the hills and threading through the timber. They came to
the ridge crest and fell down the quick mud-greasy loops of the
road into Deer Valley, reaching Pennoyer's before ten o'clock.
Pennoyer had the new horses standing ready.</p>

<p>Rawson said, "Where's Carrico?"</p>

<p>"Not here. Supposed to be?"</p>

<p>Rawson and Lennon climbed down. Rheinmiller came out of the
coach, shaking his head. "I don't like to be a passenger. Never
know what the hell's going to happen." It took Mulvey longer to
reach the ground. "What we got to eat?"</p>

<p>"Pie and coffee," said Pennoyer,</p>

<p>"Carrico's not here yet," said Rawson.</p>

<p>Mulvey shrugged his shoulders. "Let's have the pie and coffee."
They moved into the house.</p>

<p>Evelyn stood in her cabin's doorway to watch the stage go and
was depressed by Rawson's failure to stop in for a moment with her.
She returned to the back room to make breakfast and while eating
she heard the voices of men rise on the street. Through the window
she noticed a group leave the stable and cross the creek with a
horse. She went to the doorway, presently catching a man hurrying
toward the lower part of camp. "What was that?"</p>

<p>"Carrico's up there on the ridge, dead. Bullet in him."</p>

<p>She stood shocked. She thought, <i>Oh, no&mdash;not to him.</i> A
light came on in the store, and Easterline appeared. Somebody
walked from the stable to speak to him. He nodded his head and
dropped it and then Evelyn heard Beth Easterline's voice rise from
the back of the store. Easterline turned slowly and spoke to his
wife, and faced the street again; his shoulders dropped, his head
tipped, and he seemed to grow small. She heard nothing more from
Beth Easterline.</p>

<p>Carrico, she remembered, had told her he would be helping Hugh
on the trip; that was why he had left so late at night&mdash;and that
was why he had been shot. She stepped to the back room and threw on
her coat and tied a heavy shawl around her head. This was
automatic, for not until she was in the street, hurrying toward the
stable, did she catch up with her intentions. Hugh knew nothing of
this and ought to know; by now the stage was half an hour on its
way, but she could still catch him at Pennoyer's if she used the
ridge trail.</p>

<p>The group had returned from the ridge with Ad's body. When she
reached the stable she saw it lying in the darkness. She called to
Borden Pendexter. "Please saddle my horse."</p>

<p>Somebody in the stable said, "Where's von Stern's horse?"</p>

<p>"He went out last night," said Pendexter.</p>

<p>"Never came back?"</p>

<p>"Not to here he didn't."</p>

<p>Somebody ran from the stable toward the saloon and a moment
later Powell Bailey left, the blacksmith shop and went in the same
direction, walking faster than she had ever seen him walk.
Pendexter brought out her horse and gave her a hand up. "Listen,"
he said, "be careful where you ride today. Where you going?"</p>

<p>She said, "Just a little way."</p>

<p>She waited until Powell Bailey came from the saloon.</p>

<p>He waved his hand and shook his head at the men walking toward
him. She heard him say. "No, he's gone." Easterline watched her
from his doorway, face so grey, so old. She turned between Stable
and blacksmith shop, crossed the creek and took to the hill. She
knew it would have been wiser if a man were going on this trip, but
everything was shot through with suspicion and she didn't know
anybody she could thoroughly trust.</p>

<p>"It's been two hours, straight up," said Rawson.</p>

<p>"Do any good for one of us to ride to Camp Wilson and see?"
asked Lennon.</p>

<p>"That would make two more hours, coming and going," said Rawson
"No. Something's happened." He turned to Pennoyer, "Anybody been
around here or through here, last night or early today?" Pennoyer
turned his head from side to side. Mulvey said to Rawson, "Want to
go back and wait till we get this straightened out?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Want to wait longer?" asked Mulvey.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The four stood loosely together, staring at the dim wall of
trees at the end of the meadow. Steam rose from that dense, dank
morass in fat spirals which flattened to mushroom-shaped caps at
the top.</p>

<p>"Well," said Rheinmiller, "what the hell?"</p>

<p>Mulvey spoke to Rawson, "You're drivin'. You're the pigeon."</p>

<p>"Come on," said Rawson, and walked to the stage. He swung up and
caught the reins from Pennoyer. Lennon settled beside him and put
the rifle between his knees while he unbuttoned his coat to make
the .44 on his hip more accessible. Rheinmiller stepped inside; the
coach sagged low on one side as Mulvey's bulk bore down. "A fat
man," said Mulvey, "sure carries a cross."</p>

<p>Rawson spoke the horses into a run over the short meadow. The
first muddy shadows of the marsh timber closed around them and the
road grew worse at once, the broken corduroy chunks sinking deeper
into the black-bubbling mud when the coach weight came upon them.
Rawson heard Mulvey say, "You take right, Barney&mdash;I'll take
left."</p>

<p>Lennon's gun lay over his knees, muzzle forward, both hands
quiet on it; he watched the forward bends of the road, swinging his
body to catch a view around them. Rawson turned to his own rifle
lying on top of the coach and reversed it for better seizing. He
said quietly, "Fanny&mdash;Maude." No horse liked this place.</p>

<p>"Little chunk of ground ahead&mdash;that's their first chance," said
Lennon. He slid to the far side of the seat and faced half-around;
the muzzle of his rifle rose. They followed a long bend and passed
into a slightly firmer area; Lennon, steadying himself, stood up
and peered through the matchstick tangle of trees and shook his
head and sat down. "Now," he said, "the center patch, where the
trail goes off."</p>

<p>Rawson heard a sound in the distance and slowly swung his head
to catch it flat on his eardrum. The coach dropped a full foot in
the broken road and threw both men forward. "Maude, get over." His
glance reached forward to the heart of the marsh which now came at
them, to the semisolid island which occupied perhaps a quarter mile
of space and out of which came the trail he had earlier explored.
He called down to Mulvey and Rheinmiller. "Watch here," and he
began his own close search. He felt Lennon's tightening nerves.</p>

<p>The coach rolled past the trail, and Lennon relaxed, "This is
half of the damned thing&mdash;two miles more to go." Suddenly he swung
and looked behind him, and let out a tremendous breath of wind.
"That gave me a jolt."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Just the notion I hadn't looked behind me for half a
minute."</p>

<p>The trees grew thick and healthy as they approached the margin
of Deer Valley, making an excellent shelter for hiding men. One
wheel went deep into a hole, tossing Lennon violently against
Rawson; he righted himself as that side of the coach lurched
upward. An old plank cracked and balls of mud flew back, spatting
against both men, speckling their faces. Open country appeared
ahead, seen as through a tunnel, and ten minutes later the coach
left the marsh behind. Fay Miller's house stood ahead, no lights
showing in the two o'clock grey, no horses around the place, no
motion anywhere. Lennon put his gun on the place simply as a
precaution as the stage ran by; then they were in the valley's
clear stretch.</p>

<p>Lennon said quietly, "I am two hundred and fifty years old," and
found himself a cigar.</p>

<p>Rawson buttoned his coat against the rain and set the relay to a
steady run. The wind had dropped, the rain fell in leaking lethargy
from slate clouds now becalmed on their easting run. He watched the
land ahead, and the edge of timber against the hills. "Carrico's
too much a campaigner to miss a skirmish. This sort of thing's his
business."</p>

<p>"May be waiting at Head of the Mountain."</p>

<p>Rawson shook his head. "He missed the meeting place. Bad
sign."</p>

<p>At five o'clock, the night sifting down its first layers of
grey, Rawson sent the coach into Lasswell's yard at Head of the
Mountain and let the horses come to their willing stop. He dropped
the reins to Lasswell's oldest boy; he lowered himself over the
wheel and stood a moment as the other three men gathered around
him, hungry, road-shaken, and made edgy by a risk waited for and
not yet come.</p>

<p>"We will have one hell of a long drink before supper," said
Mulvey.</p>

<p>When they had eaten, the four men moved out into the yard again.
"You want to wait here till daylight?" Mulvey asked.</p>

<p>"The night's as good for us as for them," said Rheinmiller.
"Better. We'll make less of a target."</p>

<p>"You expect Carrico to be waitin' in the trees for us?"</p>

<p>Rawson shook his head, and Lennon permitted himself a rare
moment of open disapproval. "Damn a man that won't keep his
word."</p>

<p>Rawson said, "No question but we'll be hit. And we'll have no
help. We could stop right here and not go on until we found
Carrico. But if he's failed us, there's a good reason. We might try
to recruit half-a-dozen men around the hills to make a posse. We'd
be wasting our time&mdash;men won't lay themselves open to trouble. They
know what happened to Potter. I see no way of making this any
better by waiting."</p>

<p>"All right, senator," said Lennon, "you've made your speech.
Who's drivin'?"</p>

<p>"My run," said Rheinmiller.</p>

<p>Rawson said, "I'll ride shotgun with you."</p>

<p>"Bart and me sit with the dust," said Mulvey. "I never was so
poor-opinioned of anything as that stuff." He looked at the men
around him, bending his head to see them well. "Anybody got any
notions where the fun starts?"</p>

<p>"I'd guess within the first ten miles," said Rawson.</p>

<p>The coach groaned when they loaded themselves on.</p>

<p>Lasswell's boy tossed the reins to Rheinmiller and he&mdash;always
challenged by the hope of a record run down this mountain&mdash;broke
the horses out of their standstill. "Yaaah, hup-hup-hup!"</p>

<p>"Slow down at the point of rocks," said Rawson. "That's the
place Carrico's to meet us."</p>

<p>"But he won't."</p>

<p>"No. It went bad before now."</p>

<p>The road ran west over the meadow toward the wall of timber now
blackened by the closing night. A mile distant, Elizabeth creek,
crossing the valley foot at a slant, swung beside the road and
moved with it into the beginning of the small canyon which was the
gateway to Head of the Mountain; and creek and road slid into this
natural water-level corridor, passing between rock walls forty feet
high. Above these bluffs the mountains rose tier on tier, dripping
black, shadow compounded on shadow. It was a four-mile passage to
the break-off of the mountains.</p>

<p>They were a mile into this mountain alley when Rheinmiller
pulled the relay to a walk, crossing a small pocket in the
otherwise narrow place. Presently he stopped the coach. Mulvey
called out, "What's up?"</p>

<p>"Carrico&mdash;if he's here," said Rawson. Then he added, "Not here.
No use waiting."</p>

<p>Rheinmiller used his words as a whip and the relay yanked the
coach on. From the lower distance of the canyon a sound began to
form over the racket of coach wheels and traveling hoofs&mdash;the
shuddering report of a falls&mdash;and the canyon lost its directness
and worked to left and right, following the track of waters which,
ten thousand years before, had cut this trench.</p>

<p>Rheinmiller called down to Mulvey and Lennon, "Quarter mile to
the ford."</p>

<p>Rawson climbed from the seat to the top of the coach; he hooked
one boot over the low guard railing which ran about the edge of the
coach top, and braced his other foot inside the railing, He
flattened on his stomach and laid his rifle stock at his cheek. The
steady jouncing of the coach knocked his ribs around, and scrubbed
his pelvic bones hard against the wood underneath.</p>

<p>"If we're stopped, Barney, go over the side. They'll nick you if
you try to bull through."</p>

<p>"They'll have to persuade me," said Rheinmiller.</p>

<p>There were no stars, no light whatever below the crowding mist,
below the curdled opaqueness of pines and rocky bluff; the creek's
broken water had no white reflection, the horses were shapeless
ahead. They were making a small swing away from the creek and they
were turning broadside into the ford, Rheinmiller holding the
horses to a run. Beyond the ford the road made a hard twenty-foot
climb to the chest of the south rim and entered timber. Rawson
braced himself against the fall of the front wheels into the creek.
He gripped the rifle and his chin slammed into its stock.</p>

<p>Leaders, swing, and wheelers hit the water with a long crash;
the first violent bounce of the coach, hub deep in the creek,
lifted Rawson and threw him to hands and knees&mdash;and a voice sailed
out of the bluff's rim directly above.</p>

<p>"Hold in there&mdash;right there!"</p>

<p>Bamey Rheinmiller let go his yell. "Hup-hyaah!" The horses
rushed toward the incline at the creek's far side and the coach,
now athwart the creek, shook violently. A shot broke above the
rattle of harness and wheels, and muzzle light bloomed and died
against the solid black. The off-lead horse, barely on the incline,
went down, its full weight dragging against the others, and the
coach, thus violently halted, slowly surged upward. The other
horses, in full panic, fought forward and backward, until the
coach, swayed beyond the center of its own gravity; capsized into
the yard-deep stream.</p>

<p>Rawson hung to the uppermost rail, rifle gripped under his arm,
and his feet dangled in the current. He was wide-open for any
chance bullet ripping through the flimsy coach paneling, and
suddenly he released his grip on the railing and dropped hip-deep
in the water. Rheinmiller was on all fours directly in front of
him, half strangled as he fought to rise. Rawson caught him at the
arm, and hauled him upright.</p>

<p>A full volley came from the bluff, orange light points blooming
again. A bullet whined on the water, a bullet made a breathing
sound in passing through the coach panel, and inside the coach
Mulvey spoke a very gentle word. Lennon's voice was louder. "Jake,
hang onto me."</p>

<p>"Get out of there," said Rawson.</p>

<p>The firing set in, scattered; steady, bearing down. Rheinmiller
squatted deep in the water. "Mulvey," he said, "get out of
there."</p>

<p>A bullet struck an iron tire with a whacking wallop, and a wild
fragment of lead ticked Rawson's hat peak. Rheinmiller, still
squatted, worked his way toward the far bank. Rawson spoke. "Jake,
you want help?"</p>

<p>Lennon got out of the coach, slid over the canted top, and
dropped against Rawson; he lost his footing and began to fall.
Rawson caught and steadied him.</p>

<p>"He's sittin' in there," said Lennon.</p>

<p>"Got to get him out."</p>

<p>"He's sittin' dead."</p>

<p>Rawson ducked. He slid his feet across the rocks and through the
current and reached the bank; he ran on ten yards and squatted,
hearing Rheinmiller breathing, hearing Lennon come on. They
crouched in the road at the base of the bluff and listened to the
steady firing of the yonder guns.</p>

<p>"Revolver's soaked," said Rheinmiller. "We'll have to do it with
rifles."</p>

<p>Rawson counted the rifle flashes he saw. "Seem to be four there.
No&mdash;somebody's crawling down the road to the horses."</p>

<p>He saw nothing, but he heard the gritting of boots on the gravel
near the water, directly across the way; he thought he heard more
than one man. He murmured, "They'll get into that coach in a
minute. Spread out. We'll wait a little while."</p>

<p>"Don't hit them horses," said Rheinmiller, and moved away.
Rawson retreated until he struck the rock wall; he crawled along
it, a naked target if these searching bullets found him. Over there
in the black gut of the road a voice spoke, very small above the
boiling racket of the creek on its shallow fording stones, and
quickly afterward the gunfire ceased. Men were moving yonder; he
saw nothing whatever but he caught the nearer murmur of more than
one voice, and he turned his head to catch the sounds and place
them. They were around the coach.</p>

<p>He raised his gun on the coach, and heard a voice sharply say,
"Now." For a moment he failed to identify the sound which came
after the word&mdash;the brisker grinding of some object on the rocks,
the splashing of out-poured water, and the sharp fall of a heavy
weight against the gravel. In that waiting space, with his eyes
strained against the nothingness ahead, he thought he saw the coach
shadow swell larger and change position. Then he knew that these
men, all together, had heaved the coach back on its wheels. He
fired low to miss the horses and to catch the men still in the
water.</p>

<p>Lennon and Rheinmilier, from their own hiding places in the
dark, followed suit, their guns beating the dark; a voice started
to speak, out by the coach, and died on an incompleted word. The
horses were in motion, the coach rattled across the ford, and the
sharp bark of another man's voice got the animals into a run. He
lifted his gun on a blind target, and didn't know whether he hit
short or high. A splinter of rock jabbed his face.</p>

<p>He dropped, crawled two yards, and heard another slug strike the
cliff. The flash of the appearing gun across the water was somewhat
to the left, in the trees at the rim of the bluff. He got to his
knees and took a blind aim, waiting. Lennon, on his right, tried a
shot and drew one from the opposite man; on that small stab of
brightness, dead actually before he turned the muzzle of his gun.
Rawson placed a shot, immediately rising to shift position. He got
an answer.</p>

<p>The coach was at the top of the grade, in the timber. He rose,
thinking to cross the creek, and remembered Rheinmiller and Lennon;
if he got out there and made a noise, he'd be their target. He
called, "Bart&mdash;Dutch, come in." Rheinmiller was suddenly at his
side, having made no sound at all. Lennon's wet boots squealed near
by.</p>

<p>"I'm going over there. Shoot high if you shoot."</p>

<p>"We'll all go over," said Rheinmiller.</p>

<p>"Wait till I cross." He moved to the water and pushed his boots
softly along the rocks; the running stream rustled around his legs,
louder to him than the crash of the coach had been. He went
hip-deep into the center of the creek and slid forward a foot at a
time, braced against the current's push; as soon as he reached the
far gravel he sank to one knee. The sound of the holdup crew had
shifted to the right. A hand touched his shoulder from behind and
Rheinmiller murmured, "What you hear?" In a moment Lennon's feet
struck him.</p>

<p>The unseen road went up its short grade to the top of the bluff,
turned to the right, and ran along the rim, in and out of the
crowding timber. The coach was somewhere beyond the bend of the
road. Rawson touched both Rheinmiller and Lennon and moved with the
rising road, they following. At the top of the grade he heard the
men more clearly, and horses breathing. Somebody said, "Fay&mdash;come
on back." The voice was blanketed by the creek's dashing sound, but
there was enough left to bring back the owner. That was George.</p>

<p>The knowledge astonished Rawson. He had underestimated von
Stern, never thinking him capable of doing this rough business
himself; it was a streak of plain outlawry George had kept hidden
behind his manners, behind the fresh shirt and neat clothes.
<i>I'll never be sure of my judgment of any man again,</i> Rawson
thought. Lennon's finger poked him warningly in the right ribs and
he held himself still, gun half-lifted. Somebody came quickly from
the trees to the left of the road, crossed not more than fifteen
feet in front of them, and moved toward the coach.</p>

<p>Rawson fired, catching the blast of both his partners' guns as
the same instinct moved them. The man gave out a short, shocked
cry, and Rawson, running toward the shelter of the near-by trees,
heard him fall. Rheinmiller and Lennon were close at hand,
flattened against the pines.</p>

<p>"Turk!"</p>

<p>Nobody answered. Von Stern's voice came more clearly from the
foreground. "Turk!" Horses began to move away through the timber
and a firing started from the coach, striking the trees near
Rawson. He slid half around a pine and sent a speculating shot
forward; but the horses were running away and the voices, more
freely calling back and forth, were at a greater distance.</p>

<p>"Now let's don't get separated," said Rheinmiller.</p>

<p>"That fellow dead, or possum?" said Lennon.</p>

<p>Rawson took half-a-dozen steps and touched the man's boots
below. He pointed his rifle directly downward and kicked the boots
and got no answer. He bent, found the man's arm, lifted it, let it
go. "Not possum, Bart."</p>

<p>The three stepped forward along the road until the shadow of the
coach began to rise before them. Rheinmiller moved ahead. Rawson
turned to the coach and put his head through the door. Mulvey was
still inside, his body lying full length on the floor and one arm
thrust out. Rawson's face struck the man's cold fingers, the shock
of it sending him backward. He said, "Goddammit," and then said,
"Mulvey, you alive?" It had seemed that Mulvey reached for him. He
touched the hand and slid his arm forward. He heard Rheinmiller
speak to the relay horses. "They didn't take the road," he heard
Lennon say. "They went west." He rose to the coach step, explored
seats and floor and came out.</p>

<p>Rheinmiller said, "Anything in there?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;they took it."</p>

<p>"Pack animals," said Lennon. "I heard too much racket for
five-six riders. Where's Mulvey?"</p>

<p>"Still in the coach."</p>

<p>Rheinmiller and Lennon drifted back and the three men stood
together, chilled and thoughtful, listening to the last echoes of
the horsemen die in the timber.</p>

<p>"They've got ten hours to run before good daylight," said
Lennon.</p>

<p>"Pack string will slow 'em down," Rheinmiller pointed out.</p>

<p>"They won't run straight," said Rawson. "They'll hole up and
pick their time. They've got a long way to go&mdash;six or seven hundred
miles before they can sell that dust anywhere without getting into
trouble."</p>

<p>"We can't do anything before daylight," said Rheinmiller, "and
we need something to ride on."</p>

<p>"Better go back to Lasswell's."</p>

<p>It took a quarter hour to turn the coach. Rawson unhitched the
orphan horse from the lead team and cast it loose; knowing it would
follow. "I'll go ahead and roll that fellow off the road."</p>

<p>"I don't mind running over him," said Rheinmiller, "but the
horses have better manners."</p>

<p>Rawson caught the coach as it went by, climbing beside
Rheinmiller. Lennon rode inside with Mulvey. They crossed the ford,
swung along the gorge and, less than an hour later, were in
Lasswell's yard. The Lasswells, hearing them at a distance, were at
the door, but they knew what this was and said nothing while Rawson
jumped down to unhitch. He motioned Lasswell forward to take the
horses and joined Rheinmiller and Lennon. The three brought Mulvey
out of the coach.</p>

<p>"That potato cellar's a dry place," said Rheinmiller. They laid
him on the cellar floor, closed the door, and walked to the
stagehouse. Mrs. Lasswell had the fire built up and the coffeepot
on.</p>

<p>"Where's the bay?" Lasswell asked.</p>

<p>"Dead in the creek."</p>

<p>"Best horse we had."</p>

<p>"Tell Mulvey," said Rheinmiller in an extremely soft tone.</p>

<p>Evelyn was familiar with the ridge trail as far as the big burn
and knew that the side trail into Deer Valley was directly beyond.
It seemed impossible to lose her way; but riding by day, and riding
by night were two different things, and though she watched the left
side of the road for the Portuguese, Camp trail&mdash;which she knew she
had to pass&mdash;she was able to see nothing in this gloom, and after a
time she wondered if she were riding in a circle. The night worked
its tricks with her and when at last she reached the wide gap of
the burn an enormous relief lightened her. Remembering Rawson's
description of the country, she crossed the burn and hunted for an
opening to the right.</p>

<p>Her horse found it. From this point onward she knew nothing of
the country, but felt that any trail going down the mountain would
soon or late strike the stage-road; once there she was certain she
would know the direction to Pennoyer's. She had already discovered
that time went slowly during the night and that distances stretched
twice as long; so it seemed now as she followed the interminable
windings of this faint thread through the pines, steadily
descending. The ground was rain-slick and the horse picked its
footing with caution, sometimes checking his forward motion to take
short mincing sidewise steps around a bend.</p>

<p>Shortly, the smell of the encircling night grew ranker, the wind
had a different sound, and the shadows were of another cast. The
horse slipped and gave a small jump that took her half out of the
saddle. It slipped a second time, it turned, struck its rump
against a tree and emitted a trumpeting blast of wind. She hadn't
straightened. herself. She reached for the horn, missed it, and the
next moment was thrown clear; she fell against the base of a snag,
fell on a sharp limb, and the horse touched her with one foot as it
made an almost complete circle. Heavy sucking sounds came up from
its feet and a thick water splashed her; she heard the deepening
labor of its breath, the quickening panic as it fought the bubbling
mud into which it had slipped. Then&mdash;its pure terror infecting
her&mdash;it emitted a clogged and strangling blast and fell still.</p>

<p>They ate breakfast before daylight and brought out three relay
horses, two of which had once been used as saddle stock; the third
was of unknown disposition. "He came from the desert," said
Lasswell. On that horse Rawson put one of the saddles; the beast
took the bit stolidly and laid back its ears when the headstall
went over them. Rawson stepped into the saddle quickly and the
horse, at a heel touch, broke into a brisk run. Rawson rounded him
back to the yard. "You're both old men," he said to Rheinmiller and
Lennon. "Take the saddles. I'll ride hackamore and bareback on
this."</p>

<p>They returned to the cabin to pull the wet charges from their
revolvers and reload with Lasswell's dry powder. They borrowed his
caps, the remaining powder and rifle shells. They stepped out into
the yard again.</p>

<p>A solemn young man, red-cheeked and round-eyed from a night
ride, drifted into the cabin's lamplight. He said: "Mornin' folks,"
and climbed down. "My God, I'm hungry."</p>

<p>"Going anywhere?" asked Rheinmiller.</p>

<p>"The Dalles."</p>

<p>"In a hurry?"</p>

<p>"Like to get there," said the young man.</p>

<p>"A day or two's delay matter too much to you?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the young man, "I would like to get there sooner."
The glittering directness of Rheinmiller's glance worked its way on
him. "Might be a little delayed without much harm done. Why?"</p>

<p>"You've just lost a horse and saddle for that length of time,"
said Rheinmiller.</p>

<p>Rawson shook his head. "Only the saddle," and, walking to the
young man's mount, he transferred saddle and bridle to the fresher
relay horse waiting by. They were ready; they got into their
overcoats and swung up to face a morning whose first light was the
color of coffee brewed from old grounds. The road ran twenty yards
down the meadow and disappeared; the mountains were still smudged
shadows without the backdrop of a sky. Rawson looked down upon Mrs.
Lasswell at the door. "Would you have anything to eat you could
throw in a sack?"</p>

<p>She delayed, turning long enough to tell them her reluctance,
and disappeared into the cabin. Lasswell said most gently, "You'll
have to excuse the woman, boys. She's had a hard life."</p>

<p>The young man had been thinking about his gear. "Where do I get
that saddle?"</p>

<p>"In Ophir," said Rheinmiller, "in a couple days." Lennon stared
at Rheinmiller a moment; and the creases of humor sprang around his
eyes. "Maybe in a couple days&mdash;and maybe in Ophir."</p>

<p>Rawson said, "Can you drive four horses?"</p>

<p>"I can drive anything," said the young man.</p>

<p>"Drive the stage into Ophir. Lasswell can help you hitch and put
Mulvey in."</p>

<p>"Who's Mulvey?"</p>

<p>"He was a man."</p>

<p>There was light enough at the ford when they reached it to
search the waters. "I'm certain," said Rawson, "we hit one of those
fellows when they were shoving the coach back on its wheels. I
heard him grunt." But they saw nothing; either the shot hadn't
seriously hurt this unknown man or, if it had killed him, he had
been washed well down the creek.</p>

<p>They found Turk lying at the bend of the road above the ford; of
the three shots fired almost in unison in the blind black, one had
registered&mdash;the bullet striking him under the left ear and passing
out at about the same place on the right side. The night's rain
soaked his clothes and bleached the skin of his face and he lay as
a shabby, crooked shape on the earth with no more dignity about him
than a dead animal.</p>

<p>"What was his name?" asked Lennon.</p>

<p>"Turk. Don't know his other name."</p>

<p>"Sort of a kid that didn't need another name," said Lennon.
"Half a name was enough for all the business he had to do
here."</p>

<p>"We hit somebody else," said Rawson. "Over there." He walked
into the trees at the left of the road and made a futile search.
The other two had gone to where the coach had been and when he
joined them he saw both heels and hoof marks in the loosened mud,
moving back, and forth, interwoven, superimposed upon others until
the small area was like a page of print blurred by a scrubbing
hand. Lennon and Rheinmiller walked westward, each man trying to
catch the story on the ground.</p>

<p>Rheinmiller said, "I can't tell, but I think we got five riders
ahead. And six pack horses."</p>

<p>"The pack horses," said Lennon, "mean they knew we'd be carryin'
the whole jag. Somebody in Ophir had to figure that out."</p>

<p>"George did," said Rawson.</p>

<p>They got their horses and set out on the trail of the scrambled
tracks. It led west a few hundred yards, reached a level section of
the hills and looped around to parallel the gorge, returning
eastward to Deer Valley; short of the valley, however, it retreated
to deeper timber and by ten that morning, angling up the face of
the ridge which overlooked the valley, it fell into the ridge
trail. In that direction lay Ophir. Well along in the afternoon the
prints took them to the burn and there started down the mountain
toward the marsh.</p>

<p>"I'll be damned if I understand why," said Rheinmiller.</p>

<p>"These tracks will drop right out of sight and leave you talking
to yourself."</p>

<p>"Just show me the tracks I can't follow."</p>

<p>The surcharged clouds were dense and sullen-colored; there had
been no sign of sun all day and as they worked through the burn and
reached the well-defined trail leading from ridge to valley the
rain began in drops fat enough to indicate a heavy downpour.
Daylight was withdrawing when they reached a fork and saw the
prints swing right. Rawson pointed to the left-hand prong of the
trail. "That comes out to the stage road at Miller's." He led the
way along the rough bottom slope of the ridge, in and out of
smaller pines and thickening brush; the ground grew wetter beneath
the horses, as though underlain by hidden springs. Perceptibly; in
the space of a quarter mile the timber sickened, some trees showing
death at the tops and others, long dead, standing stripped of
needles and bark, a silver pallor upon them. The trail made a short
turn, skirted a little island of land and ended without warning
before a motionless, bilious pool of water. Beyond, other small
islands rose, and the dead and dying timber, tilted or fallen, made
a gaunt jungle as far as the eye reached.</p>

<p>Rheinmiller looked at it a long while, and studied the tracks
which so definitely ended at the edge of the water. "They sure
didn't ride into it. Got to be tracks somewhere."</p>

<p>"That's our little chore," said Rawson. "But look at it. If you
put a thousand miners in here to hunt they'd all end up marooned on
these islands shouting for help. When George wants to pick his time
he can slip out and run in any direction. There's four sides to
this thing and by the time we found the tracks they might be a week
old."</p>

<p>"There's got to be a trail and there's got to be tracks," said
Rheinmiller.</p>

<p>"Too late today to hunt," said Rawson.</p>

<p>The rain had thickened and wetness crept through his overcoat;
the other two sat gloomy and thoughtful. "Don't relish sleeping
out," said Lennon.</p>

<p>Rawson said, "Let's circle around to Miller's house. It's a
shelter."</p>

<p>By the time they got back to the fork of the trail there was
scarcely a hatful of light left in the sky; it was full dark when
they came out upon the valley floor and sighted Miller's lightless
cabin ahead. They drifted in, keeping the lean-to between
themselves and the cabin. Rawson got down and moved forward. He
tried the back door and stood aside a moment, listening. He called,
"All right," and stepped inside. Presently Rheinmiller and Lennon
came on. Rheinmiller had the sack of food.</p>

<p>"I could use a fire," said Lennon. "But it won't do. Let's try
that grub."</p>

<p>They ate in the darkness and found drinking water in a bucket on
the wash bench back of the cabin. When he had finished, Rawson
turned to the door. "George never liked to be cold&mdash;and maybe
they'll have a fire. I'll ride down the road and see if I can
locate any sign of it."</p>

<p>"That's not too good," said Rheinmiller.</p>

<p>"If I see anything, I'll come back." Then he changed his mind.
"No, if I see anything, I might try to get closer. Follow my tracks
in the morning if I don't come back." He went to his horse, reached
the road and, a hundred yards from the cabin, pressed into the
marsh. There was no light at all.</p>

<p>The first shock of the accident passing, Evelyn threw aside the
feeling that she was about to slide into the water and relaxed
pressure of her hands and body against the earth, somewhat
disgusted by the panic which had for that short while dominated
her.</p>

<p>She sat up, catching the ache of her bruised side, and slid
forward until her foot touched the yielding mud. Her immediate
reaction was to draw back and pull her feet beneath her while a
second, smaller fear went through her. She turned and crawled
forward but immediately she stopped and ran a hand along the ground
to establish some mark which would identify this one place of which
she was certain. She touched a rotted stump and moved on. She
thought, <i>I can't stay here all night,</i> and tried to remember
from which direction the horse had brought her. It seemed to be at
her left, but she knew the horse had made part of a turn before
throwing her and perhaps she was wrong. She crawled to the right
and again found mud; she retreated to the stump to orient herself
and now tried the left. She went farther, and for a moment thought
she had found her way, but the ground began to fill with water
under her hands and knees and, reaching out to either side she felt
the near-by mud.</p>

<p>The rain fell, soft and wet, and by morning her clothes would be
soaked through. It was ten hours or perhaps more until she could
find her way out, and she had begun to shiver.</p>

<p>She couldn't control the shaking of her body; she brought her
arms across her chest and buried her hands under her armpits. Her
face felt stiff, as though frozen under a thick pack of mud. Since
she couldn't keep her interest on anything, she deliberately tried
to make her mind blank. Some time afterward she ceased to shake and
felt momentarily warm. The exertion tired her and she knew she'd be
drained of all energy before day came. She tried to judge the
passage of an hour. She cut the night into its other hours and
could not imagine their ever ending. She moved restlessly; she grew
too numb to move. She sat motionless and endured.</p>

<p>The thousand years crawled on and the stray creatures of the
swamp, sensing daylight, began to stir; what she first saw was the
blurred outline of a snag before her, then the corridors began to
lead her vision farther back and the water around her darkly
glistened. She rose, dull-minded, and put a hand on the near-by
tree to support herself. The small chunk of land on which she stood
seemed to be entirely surrounded by marsh, yet she knew the horse
had crossed somewhere and she stepped around the place until she
saw where the blackness of the water gave way to something green
lying directly below the surface. She found a short stick and bent
over to prod that place; the bottom was sticky but not as soft as
the mud elsewhere. Beyond this green-cast gap, at six feet or more,
stood another hummock and beyond that there seemed to be firm
ground.</p>

<p>She drew on her courage and stepped forward into the water. As
soon as she felt her shoe sink she withdrew and stood a moment in
complete uncertainty. <i>But if I take one long step I can jump the
rest of the way.</i> She laid her foot into the water again,
without weight, gathered herself and took two rapid steps. She went
to her ankles, grew afraid and rushed on so quickly that she fell
full length on the solid ground before her. When she rose to look
ahead she discovered that the way was no better than before, for
water surrounded this miniature island as well. Then, completely
disheartened, she thought she understood. The night-long rain had
lifted the level of the marsh, drowning out what had been a poor
path at best.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the distance there was a sound, but this she
disregarded, long before having grown accustomed to other sounds
which meant nothing. She thought she must be facing east for the
light behind her seemed stronger; if that were true she was moving
toward the Pennoyer meadow&mdash;and since the marsh was four miles deep
and she had entered it at the halfway point, and certainly had
traveled a mile within it, she ought not be more than a mile from
safe shelter. The sound first heard came again, and held on. She
stopped, turning her head to place it and, through the cluttered
snags, she thought she saw a string of men and horses quartering
over the marsh. She drew a long breath to cry out, and checked
herself, <i>That's silly&mdash;I'm seeing things.</i> She began to
tremble, half afraid of her, mind, half hopeful. She closed her
eyes, but the sound grew until she heard voices. She opened her
eyes and saw the string clearly. <i>That's impossible&mdash;it's mud and
water over there.</i> Yet the outfit approached as though on a
solid trail. She bent forward, counting four men, and when she
recognized the foremost rider she checked the forming cry and let
her breath softly spill out; she dropped flat on a log; she watched
the file go by forty feet distant and move on, George von Stern in
the lead, Fay Miller and Tilson behind him, and a fourth man, whom
she didn't know, at the end of the procession, using his voice to
prod six pack horses, on each of which a box was lashed.</p>

<p>She remained until they faded into the shadows on her left. She
heard the last murmuring of their voices and she thought,
<i>There's a trail through this place. It's right ahead,</i> and
she rose on the log and began to work her way forward, now fearful
she might miss it; for the grey twilight, so slowly advancing, now
came in rapidly.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes or thereabouts after he entered the marsh,
Rawson saw the fire; not a clear image of it but only a glow&mdash;and
not even a distinct glow, but rather a disturbance in these shadows
which were otherwise so unrelieved by black. The location of it was
to his right and apparently a great deal deeper in the swamp, and
as he rode forward it slightly strengthened. He went on another
mile, which was half the distance through the drowned area,
steadily checking the fire's origin until it lay directly over his
right shoulder. Here he stopped, having reached that point in the
road from which the side trail took off for its mysteriously
incomplete run through the marsh. This was the only approach to the
fire he knew about, yet he had no liking for it, remembering that
it had brought him to a dead end on his earlier exploration. The
horse, liking the prospect no better, turned slowly away. He
brought it around again. The fire was the best compass he would
ever have and, by daylight, would be gone. Without some such
telltale point he might ride within fifty feet of those men and
never see them.</p>

<p>He forced the horse into the trail which, for a short way, was
easy enough to follow since it rested on the solid ground. There
was not much of it and as soon as the horse felt the earth grow
unstable it came to a determined halt, no amount of persuasion
sending it on. Rawson retreated a short distance, led the beast off
the trail and tied it to a snag; then he took the rifle from its
boot, checked the amount of loose ammunition he had in his pocket,
and set forward afoot. Three steps onward, he remembered the lariat
coiled to the saddle thong and went back for it, and set out again.
He too felt the ground change beneath him, but there was a definite
groove to mark the trail and by shuffling his feet occasionally he
managed to trace its edges and to follow its increasingly tortuous
progress from one hummock to another.</p>

<p>Sound came through the dark, rising from nothing with such
suddenness that he wheeled at once and stepped behind a snag, his
feet in water and slowly sinking until they struck the hard support
of a root. A voice came in: "Let the horse have its head," and the
hoofs splashed not far away. He looked into the glow and saw no
shapes, and turned his head toward the darker quarter of the marsh,
and heard the travelers quite close by. One shape came dimly in
from the nothingness, followed by a second shape, both so near him
he could have touched the horses; in another moment they were back
of him, going toward the stage road. The speaker's voice seemed to
be Tilson's; that of the second man, now complaining, wasn't
familiar. "Don't go so damned fast."</p>

<p>Rawson stepped to the trail and moved on. Now he had two men
behind him and perhaps two or three in front of him. The light was
no longer directly ahead but toward the right, and the farther he
followed the trail the more it swung away. Perhaps the trail made a
long loop on its way to the fire, and certainly the two riders must
have come from the fire; yet at the end of a quarter hour's
creeping progress he was farther from the glow than he had been
before, and at that point decided he must have overshot another
branch of the trail. He turned and retraced his way until he was
about where he had been during the passage of the riders. Judging
from the glow, this was the nearest point to the fire and he began
to walk back and forth in search of a path which would cut across
the marsh to it. He discovered nothing and for a little while he
sat crouched and tried to unravel the puzzle, meanwhile listening
into the night.</p>

<p><i>No,</i> he thought, <i>this trail must loop back,</i> and he
rose and went ahead. Once more the glow swung behind him as he
traveled, but in a little while he felt the trail turning. It made
half a circle around a hummock and bent again. His elbow scraped a
log and his knees struck another; he got down on his haunches,
sighting the low ground against the glow and saw the silhouette of
fallen timber everywhere, the logs canted at crazy angles. A wind,
striking this rotten patch, had laid everything flat. Through it
the trail passed, sometimes squeezing narrowly between logs and
making such sharp turnabouts that he wondered how a horse could
manage to make passage. He was again approaching the fire, the glow
now acquiring a definite center. Over there, behind a partial
screen of thin brush and stunted pines, there seemed to be an
island of greater size standing above the muck, a hideout made
secure by the waters around it and approached only by this trail.
As he moved on, sliding through a log-crowded alley which shifted
its direction every ten or fifteen feet, he began to catch an
occasional glimpse of the fire itself through the tree spaces, a
small fire made extraordinarily bright by the night's thickness.
The trail pointed directly at it for a short time, came near enough
to it that he finally saw two men lying about the blaze, and
afterwards veered off; then he struck a log, chest high, and though
he searched patiently for at least five minutes he could find no
opening. Somewhere he had passed the proper turning and had reached
this dead end.</p>

<p>He rose to a log and crept along it, directly toward the fire.
The log led him downward into the water; he retreated a few feet,
crossed to another log and followed this until it ran out, then
dropped to the swampy ground, one hand hanging over the log for
support. Ahead of him the capsized root system of a snag stood
against the fire's glow, its dozen broken roots reaching out of the
swamp like the desperate fingers of a sinking giant. He judged it
to be ten feet away from him, across a strip of watered mud which
might be as soft as mush, as deep as China. He didn't know what it
was like, but he had been creeping through this place too long and
he was too close to the fire to stop now.</p>

<p>He shifted gun and rope to one arm, stepped forward with a hand
still hanging to the log; the mud was soft, yet not too soft. He
released his grip on the log and stepped ahead and suddenly he was
down to his knees in it; the fright chilled him and he bent his
body and hauled at one foot with all the force he had and pulled it
out and planted it ahead. He strained so hard his crotch hurt; he
got his rear foot lifted, flung it forward, and swept his arm
outward to catch the snag. He missed. He was below his knees in the
mud and still sinking, and when he freed one leg he had to bend
aside to bring it ahead. He couldn't get the other leg free; he
pressed his mouth together, he gripped gun and rope, dumbly holding
these things which were no good to him at the moment, and he
reached for the snag and this time caught one of its roots. It
snapped under pressure. He forced his body to a greater slant and
got another grip on the root, and hung to it. With his weight off
his legs he ceased to sink; he worked himself nearer the log, so
low that his chest skimmed the mud. He got his knee on the solid
ledge of ground which had supported the snag and hauled his other
foot after him, Pushing himself around the snag's roots he now
looked directly across a strip of dark mud and debris to a chunk of
higher ground on which the fire burned. He saw the horses standing
beyond it. Fay Miller squatted before it, his face turned full on.
He saw von Stern rise from the flame and make an inspection of the
surrounding shadows and ask Miller, "You hear that?"</p>

<p>"In this place," said Miller, "you can hear anything. Some of
it's real and some of it's in your head. George, why'd you send
Tilson and McLarney back to my cabin?"</p>

<p>"To pick up your extra grub. We're apt to be here awhile."</p>

<p>The fire's light illuminated the skeptical amusement on Miller's
face. "Why'd you send those two? Why not me? You afraid I might
cook up something while I was gone?"</p>

<p>"You might," said von Stern. "We've got enough dust here to turn
any man's head."</p>

<p>"They can get ideas as well as me," said Miller. "They could
crawl back here, stand off in those logs, and fix us fine with a
pair of shots."</p>

<p>"Possible," said von Stern.</p>

<p>"You understood that when you sent em away. Now, then, George,
let's have it."</p>

<p>"I believe," said von Stern, "we'll cut this party to two."</p>

<p>"Then it's just you and me to worry about each other."</p>

<p>"No," said von Stern. "You and I can't afford to quarrel. It
won't take four to get out of the country, but it will take
two."</p>

<p>"They're thinkin' the same thing."</p>

<p>Von Stern pointed beyond the fire. "They'll come back from that
direction, won't they?"</p>

<p>"That's the mouth of the trail," pointed out Miller. Von Stern
looked down to the seated Miller. His voice was mild. "In a little
while we'd better step away from the fire and wait. That all right
with you, Fay?"</p>

<p>"I was waiting for you to suggest it," said Miller. "You're all
right, George. I had my doubts&mdash;but you're all right."</p>

<p>The island on which the two stood was at least three feet above
the swamp and its near edge came within fifty feet of the snag
against which Rawson stood. Between snag and island lay a channel
of water-covered mud which seemed impassable; no intervening
hummock furnished him with a steppingstone and the snag had fallen
parallel to the island, supplying him with no approach. He circled
the root fan to its shadowed side, hooked an arm over the snag and
moved along its diminishing trunk. He heard von Stern speak.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon we'd better let this fire die down."</p>

<p>"Not too much," said Miller. "That would make 'em wonder. Tilson
thinks pretty fast."</p>

<p>"Tilson's a damned fool."</p>

<p>"Man gets mighty smart when he's thinkin' of his skin."</p>

<p>Thirty feet down the length of the snag, Rawson stopped to
search the surface of the mud. A fringe of brush along the margin
of the island screened the fire so that the marsh cast off an
oil-dark shadow; across this shadow a streak lay, like a hidden
rib. He let his feet down into the mud and felt them sink and
strike hard bottom; that was another log lying below the marsh
surface. He balanced himself on it and moved forward. He touched a
knot with his shoe and spent a rough moment teetering; he crouched
to steady himself, and went on monkey fashion. The farther he
traveled the deeper the log carried him until he was pushing
foot-deep through the mud; a dead limb stuck up from the log and
when he worked around it his searching boot found no more hard
surface beneath. He had reached another dead end twenty feet from
the island. He shook out the rope and tied an end to the dead limb
and gave it a testing jerk. The limb held. He lowered himself into
the mud, slowly sinking until he was beyond his hips. He rocked his
weight up and down and seemed to drop no farther&mdash;that was bottom
apparently, unless he struck a soft pocket along the way. Squaring
himself around, he worked his legs against the rubbery resistance
of the mud, half a foot at a time.</p>

<p>Von Stern said, "I've got to make some more coffee. Can't get
the chill out of my bones."</p>

<p>"You been leadin' a soft life."</p>

<p>Rawson seemed to be pushing half the swamp before him and the
effort cramped unused muscles somewhere below his hips. He stopped,
at once beginning to sink, and knew he couldn't risk stopping
again; there was a soft spot under him. He paid out the rope as he
moved on; wondering if the snag's dead limb would hold against much
pressure in the event he had to haul himself back. Far away he
heard a pair of light, thin explosions, then two more, then one. He
thought, <i>They ran into Rheinmiller and Lennon.</i> He knew the
answer to that one&mdash;they were dead and wouldn't come back. His feet
struck harder bottom and he rose with the solid shore of the
island.</p>

<p>"Trouble there," said von Stern.</p>

<p>"Rawson must of been watchin' the cabin."</p>

<p>"I thought he might," said von Stern.</p>

<p>Rawson spread the brush before him, sliding sidewise through it.
He dropped to one knee, looking directly over the flat center of
the island to the fire, to von Stern's back, to Miller's tilted
face. He lifted the gun, supporting one elbow on a cocked knee;
then he dropped the rifle for a moment to wait out the trembling of
his overused leg muscles and to settle his breathing.</p>

<p>"They caught up with us fast," said Miller. "I expected they
would. But they won't get much closer."</p>

<p>"Rawson know anything about these trails?"</p>

<p>"Not much."</p>

<p>Rawson settled the rifle on his knee and aimed at von Stern's
back. "George," he said, "you're covered. Turn around. Stand up,
Fay."</p>

<p>Miller exploded as an overstrained spring, plunged both feet
forward to scatter the fire, and immediately rolled away. Von Stern
leaped aside and went to the ground in a flat dive. Rawson's bullet
missed him.</p>

<p>The kicked-apart fire ceased to throw its light across the
island; the hundred small eyes burning along the ground cast off
thin, small beams. He lost sight of von Stern, the latter somewhere
in the fringing brush at the island's far side, but Miller was
still within sight, still rolling. He laid a shot on the man and
heard a cry. He had registered a hit but he knew it wasn't serious,
for Miller's words came up with their insolent intemperance.
"George, this man's my meat&mdash;I'm goin' to kill him and skin him
out." Then the temper died and his voice changed. "You shot me in
the leg." He fell silent and Rawson, staring through the increased
shadows, saw nothing of him; he had crawled beyond the light's
reach. There was no sound from George.</p>

<p>Miller spoke again, a rising trouble in his tone. "Rawson, I've
got to get something around this leg before I bleed dry. Here&mdash;I'll
throw my gun at the fire." It struck the ground near the fire and
the fire coals leaped around it. Rawson turned his head from side
to side, listening for motion from von Stern.</p>

<p>"Rawson," said Miller, "I've got to get over there where I can
see. Can't wait. I'm out of this."</p>

<p>"Where's your rifle?" said Rawson. He retreated from the brush,
moved to his right and crouched low to catch whatever moved against
the dying light.</p>

<p>"Rifle's on my horse," said Miller. "Don't shoot at me&mdash;I'm
crawlin' toward the fire."</p>

<p>Rawson shifted to the right again. He went on all fours, the
brush screening him from the center of the island. He came to a log
and settled against it.</p>

<p>"That all right, Rawson?" called Miller. "I'm going to
move."</p>

<p>He caught the light breaking of a stick behind him and turned
and saw a shadow grow up from the brush. The shadow swung,
thickened, swung again, and a gun's light was a lance thrust
straight at him. The bullet struck hard by, whacking the log like a
flat hand; he rolled over the log and threw two shots at the
shadow, meanwhile hearing Fay Miller's boots pound the earth and
Fay Miller's voice rise high: "Get 'im, George&mdash;bust him!" The man
was on his feet, no bad leg, and rushing forward; he fired when he
reached the brush and smashed through it and was a close high shape
when Rawson shot him; his feet carried him as far as the log and
there he fell.</p>

<p>Rawson looked beyond the log, saw nothing, and crawled around
Miller, reaching and moving beside the edge of the brush until he
was where Miller had been a few moments before. Here he crouched,
slid into the brush, and waited. George had used Miller's rush to
shift position. This was the George he hadn't known about, this
tiger business coming strangely out of a well-fed man who wore
white shirts and preferred the comforts of his saloon.</p>

<p>He brought his rifle higher and laid a finger on the trigger,
gently swinging it; he was a duck hunter waiting for a bird to
break. He listened and heard the small squealing of mud under
George's weight, softly begun, soon stopped. George was foxy,
George was waiting for him to turn careless. He sat still, but the
stillness was too much and he hated himself for squatting in the
brush as the hunted instead of the hunter, and suddenly he stood
up, took three quick steps and dropped.</p>

<p>Von Stern's rifle cracked in his ears, the bullet skimming over.
He rolled over and brought his gun around. He saw another flash in
the brush, this bullet wider than the first. He took his shot on it
and he rose and moved forward and side-stepped and fired a second
shot and saw von Stern's shadow rising. He put a third shot at the
man; that one he knew went home; but he wondered why George hadn't
done a better job. He pulled the trigger again and heard no report
and, standing in his tracks, he saw von Stern go back to his knees
and sink down, the brush breaking his fall. He walked forward, bent
to catch von Stern's rifle, and threw it aside. "George," he said.
"George."</p>

<p>It was the moment he had looked forward to with dread. This man
once had been close to him and if friendship had any power it ought
to leave something behind&mdash;a memory of what the good days had been
like, or the bitterness of knowing that no loyalty stood against
time or change or the trickery of ideas. But nothing was left. He
had been a foolish young man who had made friends too carelessly.
Now he knew better; he wasn't a young man any more.</p>

<p>"Hugh," said a small voice far away. "Hugh, I can see you. Come
and get me out of this."</p>

<p>He whirled and ran over the clear ground and through the brush
to the black margin of the island. He said: "Where?"</p>

<p>"Here, on a log."</p>

<p>Twenty feet away, she sat straddled at the very end of a log,
the weight of her shoulders sagged against her propped arms; the
rising firelight showed a sleepwalking look on her face.</p>

<p>"Can you hang on?"</p>

<p>"I'm awfully tired, Hugh."</p>

<p>He couldn't reach her from this direction. He ran along the edge
of the island until he found a narrow ridge moving into the
darkness. The trail began here, carrying him farther from Evelyn,
until she was out of sight; but by now he had got accustomed to
this indirection, and he watched the left side of the trail for the
first sign of a break.</p>

<p>She dropped at the fire as soon as she reached it and lay half
curled, hands stretched to the flames, eyes shut and her face so
loose that she looked like some other woman. He moved over to the
horses, uncinched a pair of saddles and came back with their
blankets. He laid them against her, lifted her and rolled them
beneath. She was a dead weight in his hands, murmuring through the
onset of sleep. "Is there any water?"</p>

<p>He picked up a black coffee bucket capsized near the fire, moved
to a pack lying on the ground, and discovered their grub supply. He
shook enough coffee into the pot for a crowd and found his water in
the marsh. She was asleep when he laid the bucket against the fire,
everything about her loose except her hands; they lay toward the
heat, doubled up, as though she had to keep some part of her body
on guard. Her clothes steamed and little patches of mud began to
turn grey as they dried; her shoes were solid cakes of mud, and her
clothes, arms and face were smeared with it. He watched small
ripples of expression cross her face while she slept&mdash;the surface
waves of strange storms beneath. He let the coffee boil hard for a
good fifteen minutes and set it aside; then cruised the island for
wood. He found a snag with a big dead limb and when he broke off
the limb it sent out a sharp report which wakened her.</p>

<p>He brought coffee to her, holding the bucket while she drank.
"Oh, that's good. I love that stuff&mdash;I love it, Hugh."</p>

<p>"How'd you get here?"</p>

<p>"I hate to tell you this. Carrico was killed on the trail
leaving town last night&mdash;no, the night before...George left town
before you did, but you didn't know it. I wanted to tell you, but I
took the ridge trail and got in here. I was out there on the log. I
saw everything."</p>

<p>She made a little gesture with her shoulders and settled on the
ground, closing her eyes. She slept; but though the fire warmed her
on one side, she was trembling and her face seemed anxious. He
dropped beside her, drawing the blanket over; she stirred and put
her arms around him and he watched her mouth smile. He bent his
head, kissed her, and lay still.</p>

<p>In the first break of morning he was wakened by a voice ringing
roughly through the marsh; and he sat up to answer, recognizing
Rheinmiller. He answered, but before he got to his feet he looked
down at her and saw her waking; she was loose and warm and her
