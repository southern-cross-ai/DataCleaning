<p><i>"His right hand shall be his enemy. And the son of another
shall sit in his seat. I will encourage his right hand to destroy
him. And I will bring the unborn through the Gate of Life. And they
shall lean upon me. And I will enrich them, and guide their feet
and strengthen their hearts. And they shall laugh in his gardens,
and sit down in his pleasant palaces."</i>

<p><b>THE NOTE</b>
</p>

<p>We got some great men from England in the old day. They don't
permit us to forget it...Well, we can counter on them. They got
Robert Harmscourt, the present Duke of Bradmoor, from us. And he is
to-day beyond question, the ablest man in the British Empire. They
can say that this American family is only the English branch, and
cite their court decision giving it the title, should the English
line become extinct. But it won't do! The man's an American. And he
would have remained an American but for the will of a god. No, the
expression is correctly written: not the will of God as we are
accustomed to say it&mdash;the will of a god! Keep the distinction in
mind.</p>

<p>And it wasn't Lady Joan! True, she sent for him at once, after
old Bradmoor's death, and assembled at her table the three
remarkable men concerned with the mystery. But it wasn't Lady Joan
that transformed this American into a peer of England. She'd have
gone to America with Harmscourt&mdash;she'd already promised...You can't
doubt it. It wasn't Lady Joan: it was the will of a god! You can
read what Harmscourt says about it. It's the very strangest thing
that was ever printed.</p>

<p><b>THE NARRATIVE</b>
</p>

<p>The very dining room was extraordinary.</p>

<p>The walls were of bare stone, and the floor had originally been
the tamped earthen floor of the cottage. There was a wide, smoked
fireplace, and an ancient beamed ceiling.</p>

<p>But the room had been made over by a deft hand.</p>

<p>It was a transformation with a slight expenditure of material;
but it was that tremendous transformation which an excellent taste
is able to accomplish with even primitive material. The ceiling had
been permitted to remain; but the walls had been covered with a
blue-gray wash&mdash;some dye, I imagine, with a calcimine. An iron
grate had been set in the fireplace, and a board floor laid. It was
a floor scarcely better than the wood platform of a tent; but one
saw little of it, for it was covered with old rugs&mdash;ancient,
priceless rugs.</p>

<p>There was an immense mahogany table, a long mahogany sideboard
against the wall, with silver knobs, their exterior presenting
laurel wreaths inclosing a coat-of-arms carved in relief. The
chairs were carved rosewood. There was no cloth on this table; but
there was a gorgeous piece of brocade laid right across it, in the
center of which was an immense bowl filled with roses. The silver,
the glass, every article on the table was exquisite. It was the
contrast between these superb furnishings and the crude room that
impressed one, as though one should find a jewel mounted in the
hull of an acorn.</p>

<p>For a moment the small-talk drifted vaguely by me. I was looking
at the empty chair beyond, across the table. It was drawn back, and
half-turned away, precisely as the girl had left it when she got up
and went out, leaving me to her extraordinary guests, and their
strange mission. Extraordinary is not a word inapplicable to them.
I think if one had looked over all England, he could not have
selected three men to whom that word would more appropriately
apply.</p>

<p>To my right was Henry Marquis, Chief of the Criminal
Investigation Department of Scotland Yard. When one says that long,
awkward sentence&mdash;with "Scotland Yard" at the end of it&mdash;one brings
up the image of a conventional character in the penny-dreadfuls, or
the hatchet-faced detective of Baker Street, with his hypodermic
needle; a thin, lemon-colored person, with dreamy eyes, and the
like. But&mdash;one would not look to see Henry Marquis.</p>

<p>A middle-aged Englishman, with short-cropped gray hair, and the
typical figure in the hunting field. There was nothing peculiar
about him except his rather long, pale face, and the strong
formation of the jaw. One felt that it would be difficult to
prevent this man from carrying out any plan upon which he had once
determined. But&mdash;one would not associate him with mysteries. If one
had been selecting a character to illustrate a personality
concerned with mysteries, he would have selected Sir Godfrey Simon,
who was sitting farther along to the right of the chair now empty.
He was a big, old man. His head was entirely bald; there was not
even a faint suggestion of a fringe of hair around the bald
head.</p>

<p>The head was immense.</p>

<p>He had a large, crooked nose; shaggy eyebrows; eyes that seemed
never open&mdash;they were always slits&mdash;narrow, like a cat's eyes; and
a big, firm-lipped mouth. He looked like a sphinx. He was the
greatest alienist in England. He spoke just then:</p>

<p>"The man was under a curse," he said; "that's what killed
him!"</p>

<p>I realized suddenly that the conversation had drifted into the
thing that these men had been asked here to explain to me. It had
begun, and I had missed a little of it. I moved in the chair, and
brought my attention swiftly back from the girl who had gone
out.</p>

<p>The third man, seated at my left, had half turned to the fire.
He had poured out another glass of whisky. When I try to describe
this man, I am always embarrassed. Nature took an unreasonable
advantage of him. He was the Thirteenth Earl of Dunn, and he looked
like a bookmaker at Ascot, in the paddock with the sporting
set.</p>

<p>No clothes could disguise it.</p>

<p>He was in the best evening clothes that one could buy in Bond
Street; but he was the bookmaker from Ascot, awkwardly put into
them. He was one of the most charming men in England; but there he
was, with his coarse shock of hair, his red face, his heavy jaw,
his large, harsh voice, and his abrupt, physical vigor. He was a
big-game hunter, and one of the most noted explorers in the
world...He used to say: "There's six million square miles of the
earth's surface that nobody knows anything about"&mdash;then would come
his harsh laugh&mdash;"except me."</p>

<p>He was replying now to the oracular pronouncement of Sir Godfrey
Simon.</p>

<p>"A curse, eh! What?" he said. "It was characteristic of you,
Simon, to sit perfectly still, like a joss, blink your eyes, and
say the man was killed by a curse, when the thing happened. It
would have been reasonable if you had meant that the outraged
divinity, or hell-factor, or whatever you wish to call it, that old
Bradmoor looted, had found a way to turn on him; but that was not
what you meant."</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey did blink his eyes. They batted an instant. He added
another sentence:</p>

<p>"I meant, of course, precisely what I said."</p>

<p>Henry Marquis took the conversation up then. He realized that I
did not understand it, that it would have to be presented from the
beginning. He touched the polished mahogany table with his fingers,
as though they were smoothing out a cloth.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "that you will get a more accurate
understanding of this thing if we give it to you precisely as it
impressed us at the time it happened: the facts, and then what we
thought about them&mdash;what we still think about them...You will
probably have to imagine what Sir Godfrey Simon means, if he means
anything."</p>

<p>He laughed, and his firm, capable hand continued to smooth out
the invisible cloth on the table. There came a slight, facetious
note in his voice.</p>

<p>"I suppose, in fact, it is not essential that an alienist should
mean anything. It is the pose that counts in his profession. 'The
man was killed by a curse!' Sir Godfrey does not need to mean
anything, provided he goes no farther...It is a fine, creepy
explanation, and it precisely suits the average Briton with the
Early Victorian novel in his mind. The lord of the manor was always
under a curse, when the beautiful milkmaid got into trouble, in
those stories...Is there a family in England that has not a curse
on it?"</p>

<p>The big man by the vacant chair spoke again:</p>

<p>"This family has a curse on it."</p>

<p>Lord Dunn turned toward me. He made an abrupt gesture, precisely
like a bookmaker sweeping aside a betting offer:</p>

<p>"There you have it," he said. "Set a madman to catch a madman;
Simon is in the right profession; old Bradmoor was killed by a
curse!"</p>

<p>The massive face did not change, but the mouth opened as though
worked by a wire: "He was," he said.</p>

<p>Henry Marquis made a vague, abrupt gesture:</p>

<p>"Before we go again into our old quarrel," he said, "our friend
here must understand the thing. It is mysterious enough, God
knows&mdash;the whole awful business&mdash;when you understand as much as
there is to understand about it."</p>

<p>He turned toward me.</p>

<p>"This is what we found," he said. "It was in the afternoon. It
had been very dry&mdash;that long, unprecedented drought in England.
Then there had been rains in the north; the streams had come up.
Fishermen were beginning to get out their tackle; the water would
be 'right' that evening. So the thing that old Bradmoor had been
concerned with at the moment of his death was precisely what one
would have expected. He was a keen sportsman, and next to Dunn, he
was the best all-round explorer in the world."</p>

<p>The Earl of Dunn made another of his abrupt, bookmaker
gestures:</p>

<p>"Bar nobody," he said, "old Bradmoor was the best explorer in
the world, and he was a good man with a rod, none better; but he
could not ride a horse. He was a damned poor hunter; he had sense
enough to give it up. And he was not a firstclass shot. He could
handle a heavy gun&mdash;a big double express; but he was no good with a
magazine rifle...I don't know what killed him, unless it was that
damned Baal from the plateau of the Lybian Desert. It's like
Dunsany's story of the Gods of the Mountain&mdash;green stone Johnnies
who finally came in to avenge their imitators. It might be the
explanation here. How do we know? A thing does not cease to exist
because some one says it isn't so. Would the Old Bailey cease to
exist because a little sneak thief in Margate did not believe in
it?"</p>

<p>Henry Marquis came back to his narrative:</p>

<p>"What we found," he said, "was this: Old Bradmoor was dead. He
had been shot through the chest. It was a shot at the heart, but it
had missed it. It was four inches to the right, and a hand's-width
high; but the bullet was so big that the man was instantly killed.
The bullet had gone through the back of the chair and lodged in the
wainscoting. We cut it out, of course; but it was too battered up
to say much about the sort of firearm it came out of.</p>

<p>"Old Bradmoor was sitting in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>"He was at least seven feet from the wall in any direction. He
was facing a narrow window; in fact, it was a narrow slit cut in
the wall. You know the sort of slit they made in the old days for
archers. It is perhaps a yard high, and nine inches wide. The stone
sloped on either side of the slit on the outside of the wall so
that the archers could shoot to the right or left...You know how
they are cut, and how the house stands out into the open sea."</p>

<p>He made a gesture toward the fireplace&mdash;toward the great house
across the road to the south.</p>

<p>I nodded. I knew all about the house, and especially that wing
of it. The sea had come sheer in against it. It had tunneled in a
deep eddy, against the wall. The dead Duke of Bradmoor had been
forced in his time to supplement the foundation by putting in
another wall straight down to the rock bed of the shore. That
stopped the sea current from chiseling out the foundation; but it
bored in here against the wall, on its stone floor. There was a
sheer wall of fifty feet from the room with the archer's slit, to
the open sea.</p>

<p>I understood exactly the description Marquis was giving me. I
could see precisely what they had found. He went on making every
detail visible. "Bradmoor was facing this window; his chair was in
the center of the room, almost precisely in the center of it. There
was very little furniture in the room. It was more a sort of
storage room where he kept the junk gathered up on his
explorations. There were maps on the wall, and a lot of tin boxes
about, a theodolite, a compass or two&mdash;in fact, the traps an
explorer would carry about with him. Bradmoor kept his fishing gear
in this room&mdash;all sorts of rods, flies and the like.</p>

<p>"As I have said, he was sitting in a chair in the middle of the
room, facing this narrow slit in the wall; he was exactly ten feet
away from it, and he was almost an equal distance from the door and
the walls in every other direction. He had a fishing rod in his
hand&mdash;in his right hand. It was tightly clutched in his hand. It
was a long, heavy rod, fitted with a reel and line. He had some
flies in his left hand; the thumb and finger of his left hand were
closed on a particularly brightcolored fly. The man was in the act
of attaching this fly to the line. His hat was on the floor beside
him, with a number of flies hooked in it. There was a book of flies
open on his knee.</p>

<p>"It was perfectly clear that the man had been killed suddenly,
without warning, while he sat unconscious of any danger, engaged
simply with the selection of a fly.</p>

<p>"The door to the room was locked, and it was bolted on the
inside. All the windows in the room were closed, and had not been
opened. No one of them had been opened. We were able to tell this
on account of the metal fixtures. They had been turned to hold the
windows firmly closed, and they had rusted in that position. The
windows could not have been opened unless they were turned, and if
they had been turned, the rust would have been disturbed.</p>

<p>"We sent an expert down to make sure.</p>

<p>"He went over it very carefully with a glass. It was certain the
windows had not been opened. Besides, when we did open them, we
were able to do it only with difficulty, because they had remained
so long closed.</p>

<p>"The markedly strange thing about the situation, so far as
Bradmoor was concerned, was that the door had been so carefully
fastened on the inside. Of course, whatever it was that ejected
Bradmoor out of life, may thus have fastened the door. But if so,
how did it get out of the room? The bolt does not connect with the
lock. It is at least two feet above the lock. It is a heavy oak
door. The hinges were sound&mdash;the door had not been tampered with;
the lock was right, and solid. The door had simply been strongly
secured on the inside, and that was all there was about it. The key
was in the lock on the inside.</p>

<p>"There was no way to get into this room, or to get out of
it.</p>

<p>"The walls were all solid. It is true that the walls were
wainscoted, paneled in heavy oak; but there was no chance of a
secret exit; we took the panels all out, and went over every inch
of the floor and ceiling. We could not have been mistaken&mdash;there
was not any way to get into that room, or out of it, that we could
conceive of; and yet here in the center of the room, on this hot
afternoon, sat Bradmoor in a chair, shot through the chest&mdash;with a
fishing rod in one hand, and a bright-colored fly in the other.</p>

<p>"Of course, we took the rod to pieces.</p>

<p>"But it was an absurd thing to do. It was the usual big fishing
rod, about twelve feet long, and rather heavy. There were not any
secret rigamajigs about the rod, nor about anything else connected
with the dead man, that we could find. He had simply been preparing
for an evening's sport, when something killed him!</p>

<p>"You will not have failed to notice that I keep saying
'something,' and I suppose we shall have to keep on saying 'some
thing'&mdash;the curse of Sir Godfrey, over there, or Dunn's God of the
Mountain out of the Dunsany story...I don't know what it was!</p>

<p>"We had no clue to any assassin. Bradmoor had been pretty hard
up, at the end&mdash;no one realized how hard up, until the complete
collapse after his death. The servants had gone into the village.
Of course, we looked them up&mdash;the cook, to visit her daughter who
was ill, and the old butler to do the marketing. There was no one
about the place, except the butler's mother, in a little cottage in
the garden&mdash;an old woman, practically unable to move from her
chair.</p>

<p>"She was the only witness we had to anything; and her evidence
included two features only: she had heard a sound, which she
thought was the back-fire of a motor car&mdash;that, of course, was the
sound of the shot that killed Bradmoor; and she had heard something
leap into the water.</p>

<p>"Of course, she had a theory.</p>

<p>"All old women of her type have theories to explain mysterious
happenings: the Devil did it! She heard him leap into the sea! Of
course, she gradually supplied details, as such persons invariably
do&mdash;details that could not possibly have had any basis in fact! The
Devil climbed the wall, shot Bradmoor and leaped off into the sea.
Well, no one but the Devil could have climbed it; it is a sheer,
smooth wall, and descends fifty feet from the window to the
water.</p>

<p>"Of course, we went over the wall. We scaffolded up from the
bottom, and examined, carefully, every inch of it. There was not a
mark on the wall! It is bare of vines, to begin with&mdash;and there is
a thin green fungus over the whole of it. I do not mean a lichen. I
mean the thin fungus that presently covers a damp stone. If there
had been any attempt to scale this wall, we would have found the
marks&mdash;and we did not find the marks; there was not a mark on it in
any direction.</p>

<p>"We did not stop at the sill of the window. We went up to the
roof. Nothing could have descended from above. There was a lot of
dust on the roof&mdash;it had been long dry, and one could have made a
mark on the tiles of the roof and on the gutters. We were minutely
careful.</p>

<p>"There was not a mark or a scratch, either above or below that
narrow slit of a window. No human creature could have climbed the
wall and killed Bradmoor. The old woman's theory was as good as
any&mdash;it must have been the Devil.</p>

<p>"But she was profoundly disappointed that we did not find seared
hoofprints on the wall. They must be there. We had not looked close
enough! She wished to be carried out in her chair, so that she
could examine it herself. She stuck to her theory. Of course, she
could be persuaded out of her details&mdash;her amplifications of the
thing. But she held stoutly to one fact&mdash;she had heard the Devil
leap off into the sea!</p>

<p>"I put some of the best men from the Criminal Investigation
Department of Scotland Yard on it at once; and they gave it up. Of
course, we tried to get at it by the usual method of elimination.
One had to consider every theory and see how it fitted the facts.
How could anyone have murdered Bradmoor when it was impossible to
get out of the room after having done it, or to get into the room
if Bradmoor had himself locked the door?</p>

<p>"And how could the man have taken his own life?</p>

<p>"There was no weapon to be found; his right hand was clutched
around a fishing rod; and his left hand was full of flies&mdash;with a
bright-colored one between the thumb and finger. These things must
have been in his hand before his death, and at the time of his
death, for they were still clutched in his convulsed fingers.</p>

<p>"The wound was hideous. The man must have died instantly. He
could not have moved after the thing happened. Every nerve must
have been paralyzed. It was clearly beyond reason to formulate any
theory which would have depended upon any movement of the man after
the wound was made. The surgeons simply laughed at the idea.</p>

<p>"He could not have moved after the bullet struck him; and there
he sat with his fishing tackle gripped in his hands. There could
not have been anything else in his hands; and as I have said, there
was no weapon.</p>

<p>"I don't think we omitted anything in our efforts to get at a
solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>"Everybody in the country about was put in inquisition. There
had been no one in the neighborhood of the house on that afternoon.
We knew the names of each person, and his mission, who traveled the
road that afternoon. We knew every motor car that went over it, and
every workman that walked along it. We knew where every man, woman
and child in the community was that afternoon. There was simply no
clew to an assassin...And there was no explanation."</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey Simon's eyes batted again.</p>

<p>"Except mine," he said.</p>

<p>Marquis laughed. "Or Dunn's&mdash;the Stone God stumping down out of
the mountain; or the old woman's theory. The country accepted that.
It was even more popular than the theory Sir Godfrey advances.</p>

<p>"We have had a variety of mysteries at Scotland Yard during my
time as Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department, and from
Mayne's time down; but the Mystery of the Letts, the Rising Sun
postcard, or the affair of the Chinese Embassy were nothing to
this.</p>

<p>"In every other mystery with which we have been concerned, there
was always some possible explanation. One could make a hypothesis
that did not outrage the human understanding; but one could not
form a hypothesis in this case that did not outrage it.</p>

<p>"Now, that is an appalling thing when you stop to think about
it! The human mind is very clever, very ingenious. When you present
a mysterious case, it will furnish you with some solution; but it
can't furnish a solution for this case.</p>

<p>"Arrange the facts before you, and try it!</p>

<p>"A man is found dead in a locked room; there is no weapon; the
fingers of both of his hands are gripped about objects that could
have had nothing to do with his death. There is no way into, or out
of, the room. There is a great, ragged hole in his chest. The sound
of the shot is heard; and there you are.</p>

<p>"If you can formulate an explanation, you will be cleverer than
the whole of England. There is nothing that the British public
loves like a mystery; and when the details of one are given to
them, every individual in the kingdom sits down to formulate an
explanation. You can't stop him&mdash;it's an obsession. It's like a
puzzle. He goes on doggedly until he gets a solution. That's the
reason why, when Scotland Yard wishes to remove a mystery from
public notice, it gives out a solution. The whole interest of the
country lies in solving the mystery; once solved, it is
forgotten.</p>

<p>"But even our best experts could not give out an explanation in
this case; we wished to do so because we wished to keep the thing
quietly in our hands until we could work it out. But we could not
put out a solution; there wasn't any!" He paused in the narrative,
and selected a cigarette from an open box on the table but did not
at once light it.</p>

<p>"When it became certain," he went on, "that no assassin could be
connected with this incomprehensible tragedy, we turned back upon
the details of the only witness who was able to furnish us any fact
whatsoever. But with every day's delay, and with each complication
of the matter, the old woman's story had become more involved. It
was so decked out with fanciful imaginings that it became difficult
to realize that the whole extravaganza was pure fancy, outside of
two evidences.</p>

<p>"These two evidences stood alone as the only concrete features
in the case; one, that she had heard a sound, which could have been
the explosion of a weapon; that she took it for the back-fire of a
motor car at some distance away indicated that it was a loud
explosive sound.</p>

<p>"This fact seemed to be unquestioned.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor had been killed by a shot, and the sound of the shot
had been heard. Of this we were certain; but that something had
leaped off into the water was an evidence more in doubt. We were
convinced that the woman had heard the sound of the shot that
killed the old Duke, but we were by no means convinced that she had
heard a splash in the water. That element of her story seemed
always too closely associated with her theory&mdash;that the whole
tragedy was at the hand and instigation of the Devil. Around that
idea she presently built up her fantastic explanation.</p>

<p>"With every interrogation of her, she became more elaborate,
more profuse in her details, and more extravagant in her assurance.
She had heard the Devil leap into the sea. It was not a heavy
splash&mdash;such as the body of a man would make; it could not have
been the body of a man. It was a thin, slight, sharp splash,
precisely what the slender body of a Devil's imp would make as it
leaped lightly from the edge of the window into the water&mdash;its
pointed feet descending, its arm up." Henry Marquis laughed!</p>

<p>"She had every detail of it now. It must have given her an
immense interest in life. Imagine that startling melodrama cutting
into the monotony of uneventful days in a padded chair by a window.
And from being a neglected and forgotten derelict, she was
presently the heroine of a vivid romance, a person of importance to
the countryside. The cottage was crowded, and she had the glory of
a story-teller of Bagdad.</p>

<p>"The result was, of course, that she presently became useless so
far as any further inquiry was concerned. That was clear. She was
of value to us for two facts only&mdash;and one of them in doubt. That
she had heard the shot was certain. We felt we could depend on
that; but the splash was likely fancy. And the more we considered
that element of the case, the more we were convinced that this was
one of the colored details requisite to her theory.</p>

<p>"There was no ledge to the window. There was no way in which an
assassin could have climbed there in order to leap off into the sea
after the crime had been committed. There was no place beyond that
window from which the shot could have been fired. There was only
the open sea lying beyond it.</p>

<p>"Of course, there were improbabilities suggested&mdash;one of them
was that the shot had been fired from the high mast of a sailing
ship; but there had been no sailing ship on that afternoon. The
officials of the Coast Service were able to assure us of that; they
kept a record of everything. No sailing ship had been on the open
sea on that afternoon inside of this point.</p>

<p>"Of course, we considered everything.</p>

<p>"Some crank sent us an anonymous letter, saying that the shot
had been fired from an airplane, or a seaplane; and we looked into
that. But there had been no such craft in the neighborhood on that
afternoon. So those possibilities were excluded. They were so
unlikely that it seemed almost absurd to inquire into them. But
when you stop to think about it, they were the only theories that
in any way indicated a rational solution of the matter; and that
they were not the solution, there was, as it happened, conclusive
evidence. There had been no sailing ship, and no aircraft, near the
place on that afternoon."</p>

<p>Marquis paused again. He lighted his cigarette at one of the
candles on the table, drew the smoke through it an instant, and
then came back to his narrative.</p>

<p>"I have been giving you this case in extended detail," he said,
"because I am trying to make you realize the difficulties that it
presented, and how carefully those difficulties were considered. I
wish you to understand, as we presently came to understand, how
incapable the thing was of any solution. We returned again and
again to it, as I have returned here in my narrative again and
again to it, because we were constantly assailed with the belief
that we had overlooked something. There must be some evidences that
had escaped us&mdash;a way into that room, or a way out of it, by which
an assassin could have encompassed Bradmoor's death. But we got no
further. There was no way into that room, nor any way out of it,
and there was no way from above it in which an assassin could have
killed Bradmoor; and yet there he was, shot to death in his
chair!"</p>

<p>Henry Marquis laughed. It was an ironical chuckle of a
laugh.</p>

<p>"The butler's mother was the only person with a theory, and by
Heaven, there were evidences to support it. She assembled them and
fitted them together. She convinced the countryside. The very
impossible things we found connected with the irrational
explanations of the matter, were the strongest evidences of her
theory.</p>

<p>"One had to consider them, no matter how practical one was.</p>

<p>"The very fact that we were able to show that old Bradmoor could
not have been killed by any human agency of which we had any
knowledge, proved, as she pointed out, that he could have been
killed by a supernatural agency only. Certainly only a Devil's imp
could leave no marks on a wall, and could leap off, disappearing
into the sea. Besides, Bradmoor had been afraid of the Devil!"</p>

<p>Henry Marquis hesitated a moment. He broke the cigarette in his
fingers into fragments, crumbling them on the table.</p>

<p>"Now, there," he said, "one came upon a series of evidences that
had to be admitted. Bradmoor had been noticed to act queerly for
some time. It was only after his death that the various trivial
instances were precisely recalled, and fitted together. But they
had been beyond doubt observed, and, now when they were connected
up, they took on an unquestioned significance.</p>

<p>"The man had been afraid of something!</p>

<p>"He would lock himself into his room at night; he never sat long
in one position; he would not stand before a window, nor sit with
his back to an open door. It was recalled that he had been clever
with an explanation of these idiosyncrasies&mdash;extremely clever. It
was a draft he avoided before an open door. Or his eyes were
sensitive to the strong light of a window; or he was nervous&mdash;too
many pipes&mdash;he must find a milder tobacco, and so forth.</p>

<p>"The explanations covered the peculiarities while the man was
living, and there was nothing to create a suspicion of some unusual
motive; but after his death they became signboards that all pointed
in one direction&mdash;the morale of the man had been gradually breaking
down under an increasing monomania of fear!</p>

<p>"These evidences were all bright-colored threads for the Devil
theory. Bradmoor had been afraid of the Devil! And he had not been
afraid without a reason! The butler's mother had a fine, lurid
theory that pleased the countryside."</p>

<p>Henry Marquis suddenly smote the table with his hand.</p>

<p>"But it could not be considered by us. There is only one thing
of which I am absolutely certain, and that is that the supernatural
does not exist. This is a physical world. Every problem in it has
an explanation. The Devil is a myth.</p>

<p>"There was one thing only to do now," he pursued, "and that was
to go back over the man's life to see if it contained any adventure
that might be in any way connected with the tragedy. We began to
investigate his life."</p>

<p>The face of Sir Godfrey Simon beyond him at the table lifted
unmoving, like a mask:</p>

<p>"There is where you made a mistake," he said; "it was not enough
to go back over Bradmoor's life; you had to go farther than
that."</p>

<p>"Farther than Bradmoor's life?" Marquis interrogated. "How could
we go farther than that? What was farther than his life?"</p>

<p>A faint smile appeared on Sir Godfrey Simon's face, but he made
no reply.</p>

<p>Henry Marquis was annoyed.</p>

<p>"You mean the curse that killed Bradmoor!"</p>

<p>"Precisely that," replied Sir Godfrey, his face unmoving.</p>

<p>"If you had come to me, I could have predicted what would happen
to Bradmoor. He could not escape it."</p>

<p>Marquis interrupted.</p>

<p>"Then you knew it was going to kill Bradmoor?"</p>

<p>"Surely," he said. "Had it not killed his father and his
grandfather?"</p>

<p>"But his grandfather was drowned on the Northwest Coast,"
continued Marquis. "He was shooting brant, and the plug came out of
the boat." "Some one pulled the plug out," replied Sir Godfrey.</p>

<p>"And his father fell from the steeple of the chapel here."</p>

<p>Again that vague smile, like a bit of sun on a painted image's
face.</p>

<p>"Did he fall?"</p>

<p>Henry Marquis swore under his breath. "Damn it, man," he said,
"you are a companion for the butler's mother, only the old woman is
more satisfactory; she gives an explanation with her theory, and
you never give an explanation. If you know what killed old
Bradmoor, why don't you tell us how it killed him?"</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey Simon looked calmly across the table at the Chief of
the Criminal Investigation Department of Scotland Yard. The mask of
his face had now the expression of a man of experience regarding
the futile chatter of a child.</p>

<p>"Marquis," he said, "you sometimes profoundly annoy me. Because
one understands one feature of a matter, does it also follow that
one must understand equally every other feature of it? I have made
this explanation until I am monotonously weary of it: I know what
killed the old Duke; I do not know how it killed him. You do not
see the interest in this case as I see it. The interest to me lies
exclusively in the fact that it did kill him. I am not concerned
about the means it took. I don't care. I am not interested. That is
for you to find out, if you care."</p>

<p>He took up the glass of whisky beside him, tasted it, and put it
down again. He acted to me like an amused man, at a quarrel among
children.</p>

<p>"If you find out how the old Duke was killed, you will see that
I am right&mdash;if you ever find out."</p>

<p>Marquis shrugged his shoulders. He turned again to me and said:
"We finally reached the dead point. There was no solution to the
thing!"</p>

<hr>

<h2>II</h2>

<p>Lord Dunn now took up the narrative. He had been silent in his
chair, moved back from the table. He had lighted a cigar, and
enjoyed it while Henry Marquis had been talking; but he enjoyed it
like a bookmaker. It was tilted at a rakish angle in his mouth; and
he blew the smoke about him like a stableboy. He now took the cigar
out of his mouth, and threw it into the fireplace.</p>

<p>"But there was something in his life," he declared.</p>

<p>"It was the last exploration old Bradmoor undertook, the one
that used up the remnant of his fortune. I mean that terrible push
into the Lybian Desert. He was too old to undertake it, and he was
too poor. It broke him down in every direction. The man came out a
wreck&mdash;a worse wreck than we realized; one could see the physical
evidences on him."</p>

<p>He made a big, awkward gesture with his hands, precisely like a
bookmaker rejecting a bet.</p>

<p>"I don't ask anyone to believe it," he said. "I don't know that
I believe it. I judge, in fact, that I don't believe it. Of course,
it's a crazy notion; but this whole business is full of crazy
notions&mdash;nothing but damned crazy notions."</p>

<p>He paused to light another big cigar.</p>

<p>"Anyway, I know the facts, and what happened. I know them better
than any other living person, because I considered that expedition
before Bradmoor did. The German came to me first; then he went to
the old Duke. I was not interested in the Lybian Desert just then.
Deserts don't amuse me. Women go through them and write books about
it. I was going into Yucatan, so I sent the German to Bradmoor.</p>

<p>"I could not determine whether he was a liar, building on some
facts, or whether he had been with Rohlfs' expedition. You know
about that&mdash;or has everything that happened before the Great Mad
War been forgotten? Rohlfs persuaded Kaiser Wilhelm to fit him out
with an expedition to explore the plateau of the Lybian Desert.
Rohlfs had a theory that the country now desert had been once well
watered&mdash;the theater of an immense civilization, antedating the
later civilizations of which we have any knowledge. He got the
professors to back him up. They prepared a monograph for him, and
it was published everywhere.</p>

<p>"Rohlfs persuaded the Kaiser to send him in.</p>

<p>"Of course, we don't know how much bluff the Germans were
putting up. It is possible that the Kaiser was merely taking a look
at Egypt, and the English possessions beyond it, and that the
expedition was a scouting party. That would be an explanation of
the wide publicity given to the monograph the professors put out,
and the money the German Government spent on the expedition. But I
don't believe that was Rohlfs' motive. I think Rohlfs was really on
the trail of a civilization, and that he was sincere about it.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, the expedition went in, and everybody knows what
happened to it, and where it broke down. Rholfs went on with a
fragment of what he could get together, and he found some evidences
of what he expected to find&mdash;not a civilization like that of the
Egyptian Nile, but something more like what I found in Yucatan. At
least, that's the story the German came to me with. I mean
Slaggerman. He turned up here, a sort of roustabout on a North
German Lloyd ship; and he hunted me up.</p>

<p>"I suppose he saw the name in the newspapers.</p>

<p>"I sent him to Bradmoor," Lord Dunn went on. "He had a
drawing&mdash;very well done. He said Rohlfs made it. It showed a path
along a stone ledge. There was one strange feature about the path
that he pointed out. He would hold a glass over it, and then he
would get excited, and fall into the German language. The path was
sunk in the stone of the ledge, but it had not been cut there; it
had been worn there. It must have been eight or ten inches deep,
and wide enough for a man to pass along it.</p>

<p>"And it was worn into the ledge!</p>

<p>"'Ach,' he would say, 'it was feet, human feet that wore that
path down. How long did it take&mdash;one thousand, two thousand, five
thousand years? And how many feet&mdash;how many generations of
feet&mdash;and why did they travel on that path, and where did they
go?'</p>

<p>"He said that Rohlfs, after the expedition had gone to pieces,
had escaped from the surveillance of the desert sheiks, and had
gone on, with only Slaggerman, disguised as an Arab cook. They had
pushed on for a fortnight before they were overtaken and brought
back. He said they reached the peak of a mountain, ascending out of
the sand to the southwest.</p>

<p>"It was not a range that extended like a geological formation
across the whole plateau. It stood up abruptly out of it, as though
a peak of mountain had thrust up suddenly from below. He said that
it was possible to travel around it, that the native tribes did, in
fact, travel around it. There was no reason for anyone undertaking
to ascend it, in the opinion of the desert tribes.</p>

<p>"It was evidently a peak of barren rocks, without water or
vegetation. The stone was hard, and rose-colored. The sharp peaks
at a distance, the German said, with the sun on them, looked like a
beautiful rose-colored cathedral. There was a certain harmony in
the outline at a distance. Rohlfs thought it was a mirage. Neither
of the two men had any other idea until they finally arrived at its
base. They had time enough to go entirely around it before they
were overtaken.</p>

<p>"There was no way to ascend it; in fact, they did not think of
the possibility of anyone going up until by chance Rohlfs
discovered this path. They were amazed, but they had no opportunity
to follow the thing up. They were overtaken by the desert tribes
and hurried out of the region. Rohlfs made a drawing of the path
that night, while the memory of it was fresh in his mind. It was
correct, Slaggerman said. He helped him with the details."</p>

<p>Lord Dunn put his cigar on the fruit plate before him. It was
half burned out; the long ash crumbled, and a thin line of smoke
ascended, rippling at the top like a fantastic flower. He seemed to
reflect on the story he was telling. His voice was firmer, less
harsh.</p>

<p>"When you come to think about it," he said, "there could have
been nothing that would so pique the curiosity as that bit of
drawing. There was just enough of it. One's imagination winged off
at once with every sort of extravaganza. In the waste places of the
earth two things have an unfailing fascination for the lone
explorer&mdash;a human footprint, and a path. If one finds a human
footprint, or a path, one can never turn aside from it; one must
find out whither it leads.</p>

<p>"I remember the effect on me when the German got out his
drawing.</p>

<p>"I was not much interested before that. I was considering a
method to dismiss him. But that fragment of drawing attached my
interest. The whole picture at once came up in vivid detail, with
its absorbing enigma!</p>

<p>"Well, as I have said, I sent him on to old Bradmoor. We know
what happened. The old Duke went bankrupt on an expedition to go
in; and he did go in. It took a lot of time, and endless
negotiations. He had to get the permits from the English
Government, and from the Egyptian authorities, and the rights to
pass, from the sheiks of the desert tribes. The English Government
was willing to help him. They wished to verify Rohlfs' narrative.
The report had not been translated into English; but it was in the
German language, in the bulletins issued by the learned societies
at Berlin.</p>

<p>"It took a lot of money.</p>

<p>"In fact, as we know, it cleaned old Bradmoor out, and
encumbered his estate as it now stands&mdash;on the verge of the
bankrupt court. But the old Duke had the patience of every great
explorer; once on the way, once taken with the big idea, he stopped
at nothing.</p>

<p>"Of course, everybody knows what he found. It's in the monograph
he furnished the Royal Society; but everybody does not know all
that he found. Bradmoor talked it over with me when he returned. He
came to see me. He was very much perplexed. He asked me what he
ought to do. I told him to make a conventional report to the Royal
Society, covering what the exploration discovered, and omit the
remainder of it&mdash;keep it to himself.</p>

<p>"My reason for urging Bradmoor to this decision was not only in
the interest, as I pointed out, of his own reputation, but it was
in the interest of the reputation of all persons engaged in
exploration. It was necessary to retain the public confidence in
the accuracy of our explorers. Anything taken to be incredible, or
improbable, or fantastic, would not only injure Bradmoor before the
great English reading public, but it would injure every other man
who undertook a like exploration.</p>

<p>"We talked it over.</p>

<p>"The result was that the old Duke's monograph contained only the
journal of the expedition, and the general verification of what
Rohlfs had reported&mdash;that is to say, no evidence of any ancient
civilization on the plateau.</p>

<p>"He found precisely what one would have expected him to find in
the desert.</p>

<p>"The only unusual thing which his monograph indicated was the
peak of rosecolored stone which stood up out of the plateau; and
this, under my suggestion, he described from the unimaginative view
of the geologist.</p>

<p>"He tells us that he found this stone formation precisely where
Rohlfs said it was, and with the physical characteristics set out
in the German report. He had the same difficulty that confronted
Rohlfs; the desert tribes would not permit him to make any very
careful examination of it. It was only with extreme difficulty that
he was permitted to approach it. He was not able to learn why they
objected to this inspection. He was impressed that it was merely
the accumulated suspicion which would attach to any expedition
going into that region&mdash;only one or two white men had ever entered
it.</p>

<p>"He reported also the death of Slaggerman on the way out. He had
strayed from the expedition, and been killed. And that was all!"
Lord Dunn leaned over in his chair, got the half-burned cigar out
of the plate, and relighted it.</p>

<p>"But that was not all: Rohlfs' drawing was genuine, and
Slaggerman had told the truth. Bradmoor said that when the peak of
stone began first to form itself before him, he was amazed beyond
any words to express it. The thing did look like a cathedral, like
an airy rose-colored Gothic thing in the sky. In spite of
Slaggerman at his elbow, he was quite sure, as Rohlfs had been,
that the thing was a mirage. It could not be anything else.</p>

<p>"It was too delicate, too artistically perfect to be anything
real.</p>

<p>"It was a fairy mosque, raised by some enchantment&mdash;like a
Bagdad story; and as they traveled toward it, it grew more clearly
outlined. It was only at the very base of the thing that one lost
the illusion; then it became the peak of a mountain thrusting up
through the desert sand, composed of some hard, reddish stone.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor said they had only a day; the sheik of the desert
tribes treated him precisely as he had treated Rohlfs&mdash;he gave him
a day. But he was luckier than Rohlfs. He did not put in the time
traveling around this stone formation. He set out with Slaggerman
alone, leaving a guard in his camp.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor said that the German went at once to the path he and
Rohlfs had discovered. It was there precisely as the drawing showed
it.</p>

<p>"They at once set out on this path.</p>

<p>"It was narrow, worn into the stone, as Rohlfs' drawing showed.
The wearing was uneven, as though the rock had been softer in
places; but the path was at no point worn in the stone to a less
depth than eight or ten inches. Bradmoor was able to go along it,
but the big German traveled with extreme difficulty.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor thought the path had been made by persons of a smaller
stature than the modern European.</p>

<p>"The path wound about among the peaks of stone until it reached
a beetling ledge at the top."</p>

<p>Lord Dunn paused, ground out the lighted end of the cigar on the
plate, and put it down.</p>

<p>"I forget the precise details," he said. "Bradmoor had them
minutely. I suppose by the very accuracy of his detail he hoped to
make the story so realistic that it could not be doubted. Anyway,
what he found was a small chamber, cut out in the highest peak of
stone, and an image on a sort of stone bench.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor said this image was carved out of blue ivory. Of
course, there isn't any such thing as blue ivory, and there could
have been no piece of ivory in the world large enough. The image
was about four feet high, and in proportion.</p>

<p>"He said the thing profoundly puzzled him. He could not
understand where a piece of ivory that size could have been found
in any age of the world. And then, when he began to examine it
carefully with a magnifying glass, he found that it was made of a
number of pieces, fitted together so that they interlocked.</p>

<p>"He thought the ivory had been dyed. But it was a dye of which
we have no knowledge, for it had entered the grain of the ivory,
and soaked through it. Bradmoor thought it was blue all the way
through&mdash;at any rate so far as he could determine by scratching it
with any implement that he had. He said that the image sat on a
sort of bench cut out of the red stone, with its hands together,
the palms up, extended between its knees. He said that the
features, and the whole attitude of the figure, very closely
resembled the Baal or Moloch of some of the early Sumerian
tribes.</p>

<p>"There was an inscription cut on the face of the stone below the
image. It was in the wedge characters of the old Sumerian priests;
it was partly defaced&mdash;the opening lines had scaled. Bradmoor and I
got his copy of the inscription deciphered. It ran like a verse of
Isaiah.</p>

<p>"'His right hand shall be his enemy, and the son of another
shall sit in his seat. I will encourage his right hand to destroy
him. And I will bring the unborn through the Gate of Life. And they
shall lean upon me. And I will enrich them, and guide their feet
and strengthen their hearts. And they shall laugh in his gardens,
and sit down in his pleasant palaces.'</p>

<p>"You see," Lord Dunn went on, "it was a threat against anyone
who should disturb the god.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor said the expression on the face of the image was one
of inconceivable menace, an expression of eternal calm&mdash;a vast
Satanic serenity&mdash;laid down over features exquisitely cruel. The
menace in it struck one as with the impact of a blow.</p>

<p>"It stopped even old Bradmoor and Slaggerman when they came to
the top of the path before it, and sent their hands to their pistol
holsters. The old Duke said he had to compose himself a bit before
he could go in.</p>

<p>"Now, that was a good deal for Bradmoor to say. He was a
cold-blooded, hard-hearted man on an expedition&mdash;not a person to be
affected by an image.</p>

<p>"The thing must have been pretty bad.</p>

<p>"They found nothing in the cell with the image. The bench on
which it sat had been cut out of the red stone, and there was
nothing about in the place, except the partly defaced inscription
and a hole in the bench of stone directly under the extended, open
hands of the image, between its knees. The hole was circular&mdash;about
six inches in diameter, and smooth. It seemed to descend into the
stone. Bradmoor said he was profoundly puzzled about what this
opening could mean. They had nothing with which to explore it, and
the whole chamber about them was entirely bare. He went outside
where the path began to ascend, and with a small hammer broke off
some fragments of stone, and dropped one into the opening. He heard
it tumble against something at a short distance, as though it were
a piece of parchment&mdash;there was a crackling as of paper.</p>

<p>"He bared his arm, and put it down into the opening.</p>

<p>"The hole was perfectly smooth, and descended for about two
feet; then it made a slight turn toward the face of the image. Here
his fingers came in contact with something that felt like a piece
of parchment. He got hold of it with difficulty, and finally
brought it up.</p>

<p>"It was a bladder, containing a handful of something that
rattled like pebbles.</p>

<p>"It had been dropped into the opening, but had been too large to
make the turn to the front as it descended. They cut the bladder
open. It was partly full of rubies. They were magnificent
rubies&mdash;big, pigeon-blood stones, such as are now only found in
Burma; and there was a whole handful of them.</p>

<p>"The reason for the hole descending into the stone was now
clear. It was a contribution box for the god. The position of the
hands open between the knees of the image was also clear&mdash;anything
placed in them dropped into his contribution box.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor tried it with fragments of stone. They fell out of the
hand into the open hole below, and descended. He said he could hear
the pieces of stone rattle for a long distance. He could not tell
how far. He had no line, and no method of judging how far the hole
descended; but it was evident that it was some sort of chute
leading to a treasure house, and that it descended for a great
distance.</p>

<p>"It had been only by accident that the rubies contained in the
bladder had lodged at the turn where he had found them. There was
nothing else to be found. The hole was as smooth as glass. Neither
Bradmoor nor Slaggerman were able to make a drawing of anything. A
rough map was the best the old Duke could ever do with a pencil,
and the German knew nothing at all about drawing. They had no
camera.</p>

<p>"They had experienced the same difficulty with respect to all
implements that happens to every explorer in the desert&mdash;the
natives always attach some sinister design to them, and they have
to be abandoned. Rohlfs had to give up his implements, and Bradmoor
had to cache his before he got very far in. A camera could not be
used. Even the notebooks had to be written up at night in a tent.
One was lucky to be able to take a modern weapon.</p>

<p>"The old Duke copied the inscription, and they put in the
remainder of the day trying to get some clew to the treasure house.
It must be somewhere below. He said that human understanding
staggered when it began to think about what the treasure house
might contain. It was evident that the cult of this god had been
immense, covering a vast period of time.</p>

<p>"Slaggerman's conjecture was evidently correct. Human feet had
worn down the path bringing offerings to this god; and these
offerings had all descended into his contribution box beneath him.
The enormous treasure thus assembled over an incredible period at
the hands of innumerable worshipers was beyond any sane
conjecture.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor said the conception was so overpowering that neither
he nor Slaggerman thought very much of the handful of rubies at the
time. He put them into his pocket, and the descending night found
them hunting for the treasure house.</p>

<p>"But they never found it.</p>

<p>"In fact, they were never able to get out of the path by which
they had ascended, and when night came they were compelled to
return to their camp.</p>

<p>"There they found themselves practically prisoners. The desert
sheik had followed with his retainers&mdash;their permit of a day was
up. They were unable to move the sheik; their solicitations only
made the tribes more determined, more suspicious. So they had to go
back.</p>

<p>"Now, that's what Bradmoor found. He told me all about it, as I
have said, when he came to make up his monograph for the Royal
Society. He told it with accurate and elaborate detail&mdash;much of
which I have omitted; and then he asked me my opinion.</p>

<p>"And I advised him to leave it out.</p>

<p>"I saw clearly what the result would be. The critics favorable
to him would regard the story as the imaginings of a man broken
down by fever, or overwrought at the end of an immense journey and
great hardships; the unfavorable critics would merely say that it
was a fantastic lie! In either event the man's reputation would
suffer; and as I have said, the reputation of everybody else who
undertook to make a serious exploration would suffer also.</p>

<p>"There was another thing Bradmoor told me that I advised him to
leave out. It could do no good to give the correct report of it,
and it might do a great deal of harm. When Slaggerman deserted the
expedition on its return march, he took two things with him that
the old Duke does not mention in his monograph&mdash;the big double
express rifle, and the rubies.</p>

<p>"The German knew where the rubies were. In fact, Bradmoor had
made no effort to conceal them from him. When they had leisure to
examine them, they were amazed at the size and beauty of these
jewels. Bradmoor had never seen anything like them. The German said
that they were equal to the Crown jewels, both in size and
luster.</p>

<p>"The two men frequently discussed them. It was a fascinating
subject, and they speculated as to where the treasure house was
under that peak of red stone, and what it contained&mdash;if these
jewels were samples.</p>

<p>"As the two men were the only persons in the expedition who had
any knowledge of the jewels, Bradmoor carried them in the medicine
box, rolled up as though they were a package of bandages. The
double express was the only rifle the expedition now possessed.</p>

<p>"When the German disappeared, Bradmoor stopped and endeavored to
find him. He did not at the time think that Slaggerman had
undertaken to make away with the treasure they had found. When he
discovered the loss of the rifle, he imagined that the German had
set out on some hunting expedition. Then he discovered that the
German had taken his camping equipment with him, and some of the
personnel of the expedition&mdash;evidently bribed to accompany him.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor did the only sensible thing possible. He offered a
reward to the sheik of the district to bring the German in. Two
days later he did bring him in, dead. He had been shot through the
chest with the double express.</p>

<p>"The Arabs were not very definite about how the German came to
be killed. It was clear, of course, that they had located his camp,
crept in on him and shot him with his own gun. But they did not
admit that. The sheik knew too much to be involved with the death
of a white man.</p>

<p>"They had a very good story. They said they found Slaggerman
dead, shot through the chest with his own gun. It was an accident,
they supposed. They did not know. It was the will of Allah!</p>

<p>"They brought the gun, and every item of equipment which
Slaggerman had taken, but they did not bring in the rubies.
Bradmoor himself carefully searched the body, and through every
part of the equipment, but he could not find them. He searched the
camping place where they had found Slaggerman, and his other
camping places; but there was no trace of them.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor said there was no use to ask the sheik or any of his
people. If they had them, they would, of course, not give them up;
and if they did not have them, it would make only useless
complications to advise them now that he had found such a
treasure.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless Bradmoor did not go on. He remained in camp for
several days, and he continued to search through the clothes and
equipment the German had taken away. He said the thing got on his
nerves. He got to thinking about the German and the menacing blue
image in its cell of rose-colored stone!</p>

<p>"And then he would put the Arabs to inquisition again on the
manner of Slaggerman's death. But he learned nothing further. He
never found any trace of the rubies; and presently he set out on
his return trip."</p>

<p>Lord Dunn stopped in his narrative. He made his characteristic
gesture, putting out his hands like a bookmaker dismissing a
worthless bet.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "that is what happened to Bradmoor. Marquis
thinks there was no adventure in his life connected with the
mysterious character of his death. When you come to think about it,
wasn't this adventure connected with it? Wasn't the old Duke shot
through the chest precisely as the German Slaggerman was shot, and
apparently with the same sort of weapon?</p>

<p>"Bradmoor said that he recovered the double express rifle. I
never thought to ask him what he did with it; but he evidently
brought it back with him, and put it into the gun case in the room
where he was killed. It is not in the gun case there; it's gone,
and I believe it's the weapon with which Bradmoor was killed.</p>

<p>"Now, here is a coincidence, if you look at it in one direction.
Of course, if you look at it in a direction equally convincing and
probably more sensible, it isn't a coincidence. The Arabs shot
Slaggerman; and we don't know who shot Bradmoor. But isn't there
another side to it&mdash;the appalling menace in that ivory image, and
its threat cut beneath it on the stone bench!</p>

<p>"It had guarded its treasure over an incredible period of time.
Of course, it is easy to laugh at the notion; but we don't know
what sinister influences were at one time abroad in the world, or
what control they were enabled to enforce over events. All the
religious legends of every race are crowded with stories of it.</p>

<p>"You can't dismiss them with a gesture.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor did not feel altogether at ease about it. He said he
could not get the notion of the deadly menace of that strange blue
image out of his head! There it sat in its eternal Satanic calm
above its threat cut in the rose-colored stone: 'His right hand
shall be his enemy. And the son of another shall sit in his seat. I
will encourage his right hand to destroy him. And I will bring the
unborn through the Gate of Life. And they shall lean upon me. And I
will enrich them, and guide their feet and strengthen their hearts.
And they shall laugh in his gardens, and sit down in his pleasant
palaces.'</p>

<p>"And what became of the rubies? The German was no fool.
Everything he did was practical and well-planned. He got his
counter-expedition together carefully and slowly, and he did not
leave Bradmoor until he was sure he could get out. He took the only
rifle the expedition had, and he took the rubies.</p>

<p>"Now, what became of the rubies?</p>

<p>"It was an immense treasure. Bradmoor said he and Slaggerman had
estimated the value pretty carefully. The German knew what such
stones were worth in Europe; they could not have had a less value
than one hundred thousand pounds sterling.</p>

<p>"The German did not take any chance with such a treasure. Before
he robbed Bradmoor's medicine chest, he had figured out how he
intended to conceal these jewels, and where he intended to conceal
them. There could have been no doubt about that. There was only one
place where he could have concealed them, and that was somewhere
about himself. He could not have cached them in the hope of
returning for them; and he could not have risked them anywhere
except near to his own hand. That is the reason Bradmoor had not
found them when he searched the body.</p>

<p>"But there is another hypothesis: suppose the Arabs did not find
them? And that touches upon another theory with respect to his
death. How do we know that the sinister influence expressing itself
so appallingly in the physical aspect of that blue ivory image and
its deadly threat, did not, in some manner, concern itself with the
death of this German, who had helped to outrage its treasure
house?</p>

<p>"And when you get into that idea, does it not follow along to
the death of Bradmoor? After all, he was the main offender. He
instigated the outrage, and he carried it out. If the blue image
got Slaggerman with the double express, may it not&mdash;let's venture
on the idea, anyway&mdash;have got the old Duke with the double
express?</p>

<p>"The gun is gone, and we find Bradmoor shot through the chest!
Of course, I am not advancing any theory about it. My position is:
I don't know. If I were as bold an adventurer into the fantastic as
the butler's mother, I would say the blue image got Bradmoor, just
as it got Slaggerman.</p>

<p>"Let's consider some of the evidences that the old woman
attached to her theory, the items which we know to be correct. The
old Duke was afraid of something, and that fear developed, and
finally got to be a kind of monomania.</p>

<p>"Now, what was he afraid of?</p>

<p>"He was not the sort of man to be afraid. No one could have
undertaken the things he undertook in explorations if he had been a
timid person. Any natural menace would not have put old Bradmoor in
fear.</p>

<p>"Was it an unnatural menace?</p>

<p>"I don't know. But when you can't think of anything else, when
no other hypothesis gets us anywhere in any direction, are we not
driven back against that sinister inscription?</p>

<p>"'His right hand shall be his enemy. And the son of another
shall sit in his seat. And I will encourage his right hand to
destroy him. And I will bring the unborn through the Gate of Life.
And they shall lean upon me. And I will enrich them, and guide
their feet and strengthen their hearts. And they shall laugh in his
gardens, and sit down in his pleasant palaces.'</p>

<p>"Only," he added, "I don't understand the promise in it."</p>

<p>Now, this is the story as Lady Joan's guests related it to me on
that night. There was some desultory talk after Lord Dunn had
concluded; and then the party broke up. Sir Godfrey Simon, at the
step of his motor, handed me a folded paper: "Read that," he said,
"not now&mdash;to-morrow, when your head's cool."</p>

<p>I had noticed him writing, on a tiny pad, with a thin silver
pencil, while Lord Dunn was in the body of his story. I thrust the
paper into my pocket, and Sir Godfrey Simon's motor turned out into
the highroad.</p>

<p>I retained the memory of his big, inscrutable sphinxlike
face.</p>

<hr>

<h2>III</h2>

<p>We went outside, Joan and I, when the discussion of the mystery
of Bradmoor's death had been given over for the evening, and Lord
Dunn, Sir Godfrey and Marquis had gone.</p>

<p>Joan slipped a light opera cloak over her evening dress. It was
a heavenly night. There was a great white moon over the sea.</p>

<p>We walked through the formal gardens from the cottage, passed
the great stone house, to the sheer rock where the current of the
Atlantic ran in under the window&mdash;where the mystery of Bradmoor's
death had been enacted.</p>

<p>The ancient house was sinister, with the white moonlight on the
walls. It stood on the rock, sheer over the sea. The grounds about
it had been laid out by a king's gardener, but it had fallen by
neglect into a wild beauty. The hedges were uncut, the walks
overgrown with grass, the shrubbery sprawled in great clusters.
With the moon on it, it was like the deserted gardens of some dead
city in a Bagdad tale.</p>

<p>The house had been taken over by the old Duke's creditors, in
the financial wreck after his death. Joan had gone to live in the
lodge cottage at the land end of the place. The beautiful things
from the house&mdash;her own possessions left to her by her mother at
her death&mdash;had been transferred into it. It was the magnificence of
these things that contrasted so markedly with the crudities of the
cottage.</p>

<p>She was not the dead man's daughter. He had married, late in
life, the widow of the Marquis of Westridge; he had no children.
The girl was Westridge's daughter. But she had lived on here after
her mother's death, and it was evident that a great love for the
place was in her.</p>

<p>She had grown up in its magnificence&mdash;the magnificence of a
fairy story&mdash;and in a belief that it would always remain...She
spoke softly, gently, affectionately about it, as we stood there in
the white moonlight above the sea, looking down into the dark water
that moved in against the black, smooth-worn cliff below the tragic
window.</p>

<p>The moving of the water stimulated a subconscious query in me,
and I uttered it aloud.</p>

<p>"I wonder," I said, "what would become of anything that leaped
into the water here; would it be carried out into the sea, or would
it be cast up somewhere?"</p>

<p>The girl replied that long ago, when she was a little child, a
fisherman had been drowned in the sea under the window, and his
body had been discovered later in the sand of an inlet some quarter
of a mile farther along the cliff. She pointed to it. We could see
a patch of white where the sand extended, in a brief arc of beach,
to the water.</p>

<p>I don't know that I mentioned actually in words the suggestion
that moved vaguely in me&mdash;the nebulous idea that the thing that had
accomplished Bradmoor's death might have drowned in the sea here,
and its body gone ashore like that of the dead fisherman. I don't
think I even undertook to imagine what the thing might be. Perhaps
it was only the will to walk on with the girl in this mystic
fairyland into which the witchery of the moon had changed the
world. At any rate we went along the path through the neglected
gardens, down the broken ledge, until we came out on the arc of
sand. The girl sat down on a bit of wreckage, her hands clasped
about her knees, looking at the sea; and I walked about in an
indolent inspection of the inlet.</p>

<p>But the thing of particular and vital interest to me was this
girl, silent here in the moonlight; her dark hair drawn back from
the beautiful oval of her face, her great eyes fixed on the sea
beyond her, her lips parted, her body motionless. I had not seen
her for three years; and it seemed impossible that the thin,
greateyed girl&mdash;who had laughingly promised to go with me to
America, when I should come again for her&mdash;had grown into this
magnificent creature! And my mind ran back to the one time I had
kissed her. I recalled it as an hour out of a fairy day.</p>

<p>It had been three years ago, on my visit to England. Joan was
only a slender slip of a girl then. We had ridden to a distant
village along a highway bedeviled with motor cars, and we had
determined to come back across the moors above the sea.</p>

<p>I remember the narrow sheep path that led up from the valley
onto the plateau of the moors, and the long, almost sheer descent
falling away a thousand feet into the valley below&mdash;not a ledge of
stone, but a smooth slope grassed over with turf.</p>

<p>But it was as deadly dangerous as though it had been spikes of
stone; there was barely width for a horse, and a misstep would have
sent horse and rider rolling into eternity. We came at the top into
a fairy cove, golden soft in the sun, and looking out over the sea.
We stopped and got down and stood a moment by the horses.</p>

<p>Joan began to fondle the silky muzzle of her horse. And all at
once I realized the heavenly creature she would presently
become.</p>

<p>"Joan," I said, "will you go with me to America when I come
again?"</p>

<p>She did not reply. She pressed her face against the horse and
looked out shyly at me.</p>

<p>And I caught her up into my arms, and kissed her.</p>

<p>For a moment she was relaxed, soft like an armful of blossoms,
and then she tore away, swung into her saddle and raced over the
moor...And ten days later, in the middle of the Atlantic, I got a
wireless message of three letters: "Yes."</p>

<p>No name, no address, only that single word materializing out of
an Arctic fog.</p>

<p>For a long time there was no word between us now.</p>

<p>I stood looking down at the girl, flooded with the soft
moonlight, the white sand stretching from her feet to the dark
water, where the tide went slowly out. All the events in this
complicated tragedy seemed to remove themselves, and to leave only
the charm of this girl&mdash;alone here, as in an abandoned world.</p>

<p>Finally I spoke: "You will keep your promise to me now, Joan;
you will go with me to America?"</p>

<p>Her voice, when she replied, was low, even, without emotion.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "that is precisely what I never can do,
now."</p>

<p>I stood in a sort of hypnotic apathy, and she went on in that
level, dead voice.</p>

<p>"You are not free," she said, "and so you cannot decide this. It
is I, who am free, who must make the decision for us. It is not a
pleasant thing to say, but the fact is, now, that you are not free
to make a choice...A bankrupt peer of England would be an
intolerable thing. You must find a wife, now, who can bring a
fortune."</p>

<p>I made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>"But I do not intend to take this title," I said. "I shall
return to America, to my profession, and you shall go with me."</p>

<p>She cried out in sharp protest:</p>

<p>"Oh, no...England has desperate need of the sort of man you are,
Robin. You are an Englishman; after all, you cannot abandon
England. The curse of this land is an aristocracy that thinks only
of amusing itself. It needs the energy, the vigor that men like you
would bring to it. The law in America is not the narrow profession
that it is in England. One goes to the head of affairs in it, in
America, as you are going. One becomes there a directing
intelligence of great affairs, a guiding factor in all the national
events that enable a civilization to advance."</p>

<p>She paused a moment; then she went on in the same dead, even
voice:</p>

<p>"You are going to the head of affairs in America; but you must
give it up. You must come back to England. You must take the
position which this title will give you, and you must bring your
energy and vigor of intellect to the aid of the land that needs
you. And&mdash;and you must marry some one with a fortune...Our dreams
are ended, Robin."</p>

<p>She stood up with a whimsical smile.</p>

<p>"Besides, there is the promise of the Blue Image&mdash;the promise to
you, included with a threat against the dead man."</p>

<p>And she repeated the strange words vaguely, as one repeats
something in a distant memory:</p>

<p>"'His right hand shall be his enemy. And the son of another
shall sit in his seat. I will encourage his right hand to destroy
him. And I will bring the unborn through the Gate of Life. And they
shall lean upon me. And I will enrich them, and guide their feet
and strengthen their hearts. And they shall laugh in his gardens,
and sit down in his pleasant palaces.'"</p>

<p>She went on, a little quaver in her voice, hard-held, I thought,
but with a courage that would not fail:</p>

<p>"You see, Robin, you are to sit in his seat, for you are the son
of another. There is no common blood in the two branches of this
house, as everybody knows. This line was the pretender, as your
grandfather's suit made clear. But it had the right of possession,
and the conservative English law would not put it out.</p>

<p>"And so, Robin," the hard-held voice went on, "you must get a
rich wife, and 'laugh in his gardens, and sit down in his pleasant
palaces.'"</p>

<p>I came over a step nearer to her.</p>

<p>"Joan," I said, "this is all the veriest nonsense. I love you.
Will you go with me to America?"</p>

<p>Her voice, when she replied, had returned to its vague, even
note, to its quality of memory.</p>

<p>"You must sit in his seat," she said. "It has been foretold in
this strange affair."</p>

<p>"Then," I cried, "I shall sit in his seat with you."</p>

<p>I laughed and went on: "I put the thing up to the Blue Image. If
he wishes his prophecy carried out, let him see to it. If he
enriches us, and guides our feet, and strengthens our hearts, then
I will sit in the dead man's seat, and we shall laugh in his
gardens, and sit down in his pleasant palaces. If the great God of
the Mountain is able to do this, let him do it, and if he is not
able to do it, then you will go with me to America. Shall we
declare it is a bargain with him?"</p>

<p>I stooped over, took her hands and drew her gently to her feet.
But before I got her into my arms, she cried out, and pointed to
the beach, where the water was creeping slowly out.</p>

<p>There was something emerging from the sand, like the end of an
iron rod. We went down to it. In the clear moonlight I was able at
once to see what it was. It was the heavy barrels of a rifle.</p>

<p>I drew it out of the sand. It was the double express that had
disappeared on the afternoon of Bradmoor's death.</p>

<p>A surge of interest in the mystery returned. One phase of it, at
least, was explained; whoever had assassinated Bradmoor had thrown
the gun into the sea, and it had washed ashore here. We took it
back with us to the lodge in a breathless interest, for we had a
clew to this mystery; and incoherent explanations began to present
themselves.</p>

<p>We took it into the dining room, and put it down on the great
table. We lighted the candles, and sat down to examine it. It was
rusted from the sea water. It was difficult to work the mechanism
of the rifle in order to throw open the breech; and we searched
among the articles brought into the cottage for oil, and implements
to clean the barrels, and a screw driver. I had to take the rifle
apart in order to find if it was loaded. The double barrels
contained two cartridges, I found: one of them had been fired; the
other remained loaded.</p>

<p>It was a heavy gun, with a big, hard rubber butt plate like that
to be found on the modern shotgun. I made a discovery when I took
the weapon apart:</p>

<p>The catch on the triggers had been filed.</p>

<p>Now, as a matter of fact, the pull on these heavy rifles is
usually some ten pounds; but the catch on the triggers on this
rifle had been filed until they were practically hair-triggers.</p>

<p>This rifle could be fired with the slightest touch on the
triggers.</p>

<p>This seemed incomprehensible to me. A rifle like this with a
hair-trigger would be an impracticable and dangerous weapon. No big
game hunter would have ever thought of so filing the triggers. It
must have been done with a deliberate intention&mdash;for some
particular reason.</p>

<p>It was clear that this was the weapon with which the old Duke
had been killed, for one barrel had been discharged. It was,
therefore, more than probable&mdash;it was, in fact, certain&mdash;that the
rifle had been made thus to fire at a touch, for the express
purpose of this tragedy.</p>

<p>But who could have wished it to fire at a touch?</p>

<p>Who filed it, and for what definite purpose? I put the rifle
together again, and we stood beside it where it lay across the
table, the butt toward the stone fireplace. We were both aflame
with the possibilities of this discovery. I winged out on the first
suggestion that came into my mind.</p>

<p>The triggers had been thus filed for a phantom finger, a finger
with no power of this world in the crook of it; and the threat of
that old forgotten god&mdash;on his bench of rose-colored stone&mdash;cut in
the wedge writing of the Sumerian priests, came up before me.</p>

<p>We could dismiss ancient religion with a gesture. These sinister
gods were impotent images. How could they influence events? But
after all, when we looked at the matter fairly, how did we know?
The sacred books of every religion in the world were crowded with
examples&mdash;especially the sacred books of the Jews, upon which our
modern religions were all basically founded. What sinister power
over events had the magicians of Pharaoh, the witch of Endor, the
dead prophets of Yahveh!</p>

<p>And I could see this hideous idol of blue ivory moving about the
doomed man, invisibly.</p>

<p>But I could not see it as Lord Dunn imagined, stumping heavily
down from its seat of rose-colored stone to destroy the man who had
outraged its dignity and looted it of its treasure. It seemed a
nimble, insidious thing like that Devil's imp around which the
butler's mother had built up her fantastic theory. I could see an
avenging agent, of this sinister image, like that. Taking the
doomed man at the moment of his unconcern&mdash;with a trigger filed to
its phantom finger&mdash;and then slipping through that narrow slit in
the wall to leap off into the sea, casting away the rifle as it
descended!</p>

<p>And then the accident happened that unlocked the mystery of
Bradmoor's death, like a key turned in the lock of a closed
door.</p>

<p>So many involved suggestions were moving in my mind, that, I
fancy, I failed to remember the change that had been made in the
mechanism of the rifle, and I no longer thought about it. The old
established knowledge of such weapons must have taken the place of
what I had just discovered, for in resting my hand on the table
beside the rifle, I touched one of the triggers with my finger.</p>

<p>I had forgotten that the opening of the breech had thrown back
the hammers.</p>

<p>There was an explosion. The big lead bullet flattened against
the stone of the opposite wall, and the gun leaped back from the
table, the butt striking the stone corner of the chimney.</p>

<p>Joan cried out, and I stood for a moment astonished.</p>

<p>Then I realized another thing that threw a ray of light into
this mystery. The heavy recoil of this gun would carry it backward;
and it carried it backward with enough violence to cause it to be
thrown entirely off the table. It was Joan who caught the meaning
of this thing.</p>

<p>"Did you see that?" she cried. "How it leaped back of itself,
without being touched?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "These rifles all have a heavy recoil. They are
apt to bruise the shoulder unless they are tightly held."</p>

<p>"But it leaped back," she cried. "It leaped back of itself!"</p>

<p>Then she came around the table to me.</p>

<p>"If that rifle had been lying in the narrow slit of the window,
it would have leaped out into the sea&mdash;it would have leaped out of
itself!"</p>

<p>She took hold of my arm.</p>

<p>"Think about it! What does it mean? What does it mean that the
gun has been made to fire with a touch?"</p>

<p>What did it mean?</p>

<p>I began to think madly along the line her suggestion
indicated&mdash;the gun in the loophole&mdash;in the slit in the window: it
would leap out into the sea when it was fired&mdash;and it would have
leaped out, as she said, without being touched, without the
assistance of any human agency!</p>

<p>I caught at the suggestion.</p>

<p>"That is true," I said; "it would have leaped back out of the
window of itself, without being touched by anybody."</p>

<p>"After it was fired," she said. "But it had to be fired
first...Now, what did it mean that the mechanism was so filed that
a touch would fire it? And what touch fired it? Who was it that
wished the rifle to disappear after it was fired?"</p>

<p>She went on, her eyes wide, her face white, the tips of her
fingers straining against the edge of the table:</p>

<p>"Not an assassin, for he could have thrown the rifle into the
sea; it must have been someone who could not have thrown it in. Who
after the shot was fired had to depend on the recoil of the rifle
itself to cause it to disappear?"</p>

<p>Again I winged out into fantastic regions.</p>

<p>That old sinister god at his work of vengeance would require a
slighter materialization than I had imagined. The heavy double
express would itself leap into the sea if it lay in the slit of the
wall and the triggers were touched by a phantom finger. But it
would require to be placed there and trained on the doomed man
seated in his chair, concerned with the preparation of his fishing
tackle.</p>

<p>How had the Blue Image managed it?</p>

<p>Granted that it could move invisibly about Bradmoor on that
afternoon, could it also move this heavy weapon invisibly about?
And if it could also do that, why require that the triggers should
be filed for a phantom finger? If it, or its invisible agents,
could thus handle the heavy double express, would a ten-pound pull
disturb them?</p>

<p>But had they handled it? And a line of that sinister threat cut
in the rosecolored stone returned to me:</p>

<p>"I will encourage his right hand to destroy him."</p>

<p>The threat was not that this old, dread, mysterious, forgotten
god would do the deed himself.</p>

<p>"His right hand shall be his enemy. I will encourage his right
hand to destroy him."</p>

<p>It was thus that the threat ran.</p>

<p>It was the doomed man's own hand that the Blue Image would set
about this deadly work. It was his own hand that should carry out
all these material preparations.</p>

<p>And then I saw the answer to Joan's query.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor!" I cried. "But how could he have fired the
rifle?"</p>

<p>Joan looked at me a moment, her face tense in its
abstraction.</p>

<p>"There was the fishing rod in his hand; he could&mdash;he
could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And then I saw the whole thing as the old Duke had so carefully
planned it. He knew that the recoil of this heavy rifle would carry
it out of this window into the sea after it was fired. He had filed
the catch on the triggers until a touch would fire it; then he had
placed the rifle carefully, adjusting its position so the bullet
would strike him in the chest near the heart; and sitting down in
the chair in the middle of the room, on that afternoon, he had
touched the trigger with the end of the fishing rod. The great lead
bullet had plowed its way into his chest; the gun had leaped into
the sea; and Bradmoor's body had crumpled in its chair&mdash;some flies
in his left hand, and the fishing rod gripped in the fingers of his
other hand.</p>

<p>And he had left behind him a mystery that no man could
solve!</p>

<p>The splash that the old woman had heard, sitting in her cottage,
was caused by the heavy double express descending into the
water!</p>

<p>And then I remembered the penciled note that old Sir Godfrey
Simon had handed to me, when, after the dinner, he had got into his
motor:</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he had said, "when your head is cool, read it." I
brought it out of my pocket now, and tore it open. There were a few
lines in a clear, fine hand like copperplate.</p>

<p>"Bradmoor killed himself, of course," the note ran. "I don't
know how he did it, but in some clever way. They have all gone out
like that&mdash;his grandfather, who left his death on the West Coast to
look like an accident, and his father, who pretended to fall from
the steeple of the chapel. There has always been a monomania of
fear preceding the act. It is a common symptom. I said they were
all under a curse. A streak of insanity is a curse. It is the worst
form of curse, because it cannot be prayed off in a
meeting-house."</p>

<p>I read the note and put it down on the table before the girl.
She moved her head slowly, her eyes wide, her face still in its
tense abstraction.</p>

<p>"The Blue Image carried out his threat," she murmured. "It was
the dead man's right hand that destroyed him; it was his right hand
that was his enemy! How awful!"</p>

<p>But the Blue Image, as a directing factor in this tragedy,
seemed all at once a remote, fantastic notion, like the devil
theory of the old paralytic helpless in her chair.</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey Simon had been right&mdash;alone of all the theorists
right. The curse on this family had extended itself to Bradmoor.
Sir Godfrey had seen it on the way. He had marked the evidential
signs of it, the monomania of fear that preceded it, and the care
to give the act the distinguishing features of a criminal
agent.</p>

<p>Bradmoor's father and his grandfather had staged their
self-directed act for accident, the tragedy of chance. But the old
Duke had gone a step beyond them, and with a stroke of genius had
put his exit beyond a conjecture of self-direction. It was the
cunning of the unbalanced mind in a moment of inspiration.</p>

<p>And it had sent the keenest intelligence of England to fantastic
theories. Henry Marquis and his hard-headed experts had stopped
against a wall; the countryside had gone full cry after a devil
theory; and men like the Earl of Dunn, accustomed to the somber
realities of life, had seen no solution except through the
supernatural agency of a Dunsany god on his bench of rose-colored
stone.</p>

<p>And yet how snugly the whole thing ran in the grooves of this
fantastic theory!</p>

<p>It held, it enveloped the girl, beyond me. And how lovely, how
desirable a thing she was! And the bargain with the god, struck in
that mood of half humor, on the arc of sand, under the moon, before
the sea, returned to me.</p>

<p>If there was any virtue in the legend cut in the wedge
characters of the ancient Sumerian priests on the bench of
rose-colored stone below that sinister image, let it now appear. If
it was the moving factor in this affair, let it go on. If it had,
as its threat ran, encouraged Brad-moor's right hand to destroy
him, let it carry out the remainder of that legend. And the words
of it returned striding through my memory:</p>

<p>"His right hand shall be his enemy; and the son of another shall
sit in his seat. I will encourage his right hand to destroy him.
And I will bring the unborn through the Gate of Life. And they
shall lean upon me. And I will enrich them, and guide their feet
and strengthen their hearts. And they shall laugh in his gardens,
and sit down in his pleasant palaces."</p>

<p>The thing was like the pronouncement of a fate. And Bradmoor's
death awfully confirmed it.</p>

<p>But was that one fact merely a sinister coincidence&mdash;or would
the thing go on? If it required faith, here was the faith of Joan,
and here was the bargain I had struck.</p>

<p>But the beauty, the charm, the fascination of the girl
overwhelmed me. She became in that moment above all things, in any
world, desirable, and I said aloud what I had already determined in
my heart:</p>

<p>"If the God of the Mountain is so great a god, then let him
carry out the remainder of his prophecy, for I shall never give you
up."</p>

<p>For a moment there was utter silence. The girl looked about her
vaguely, like one in a dream, like one expecting a visitation; and
the beauty and the charm of her seemed to extend itself, to fill
the empty places of the room.</p>

<p>Then suddenly something on the stones by the hearth came within
the sweep of my eye. It looked like a red bead.</p>

<p>I went over and picked up the heavy double express from the
hearth. The hard rubber butt plate, striking against the stone
corner of the fireplace, had been broken to pieces, and a stream of
rubies poured out.</p>

<p>The explanation was clear.</p>

<p>Slaggerman, when he had robbed Bradmoor in the desert, had
unscrewed the butt plate, hollowed out the stock, and concealed the
treasure in it. As in a sort of dream I gathered up the handful of
great gleaming rubies, and put them on the table.</p>

<p>Then I turned toward the girl, standing with her arms hanging,
her lips parted, her eyes wide with wonder.</p>

<p>She came with a little cry into my arms.</p>

<p>"You shall sit in his seat," she said. "The God of the Mountain
has carried out his prophecy."</p>

<p>I drew her in against my heart.</p>

<p>"But not all of it," I said. "I hold him to the letter of that
contract. 'I will bring the unborn through the Gate of Life.'"</p>

<p>But her face crimson with blushes was bedded into my shoulder,
and her hand creeping up, covered my mouth.</p>
