<h2>The Garden In Asia<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Melville Davisson Post</h2>

<hr>

<p class="letter">"Come to the land where men grind their wheat in
the sky!"</p>

<p>It had come on to rain. Night was approaching, and I was lost. I
had been a guest of the Marquis de Brie at the hunt in the
southeast of Belgium. The meet at the château had been in the
afternoon for the convenience of the guests of the Marquis, who
came out from Brussels. It was late before the hounds picked up a
fox, and then there had been a mad run.</p>

<p>I was unfamiliar with the country, and by one of those accidents
common in the field, I had got separated from the hunt.</p>

<p>There had been a high timber jump. In the take-off my horse
slipped, and I feared that he had received a strained tendon. I got
down to look, for I valued the horse, and in my concern the field
passed. The horse seemed all right. But I was unable again to come
up with the hunt, and I was lost.</p>

<p>I set out to return to the château, following that instinct of
direction which every man imagines himself to possess. But it was
an unfortunate undertaking as is usually the case with these
vaunted instincts.</p>

<p>I had the feeling that I passed more than one time through
fields that I remembered. At any rate, night was coming on, and a
worse thing presented itself. The hunter had been injured in that
unfortunate timber jump. He began to save his leg a
bit&mdash;everybody knows the indications.</p>

<p>Of course I was not in a deserted country. There were peasant
houses about, and the great windmills&mdash;that primitive
institution of the flat country, serving the peasant farmer as the
mountain torrent served to turn the grist mill of the Virginia
settler. Our fathers had big conceptions of the uses of the
elemental forces. They harnessed the water and the winds.</p>

<p>But I could get no direction from the Belgian peasant.</p>

<p>The Fleming and the Walloon spoke no language that I could
understand; and, of course, English was a simian jabber to
them.</p>

<p>I have no idea in what direction I traveled, nor precisely how I
came into the road I determined to follow. It was not a highway. It
was a sort of lane running along by an immense wood, carpeted with
grass and unkempt, for occasionally there was the branch of a
forest tree in it.</p>

<p>I had gotten down out of the saddle. It was all the horse could
do to limp along, and I at least had two good legs under me.</p>

<p>I walked by the horse's bridle.</p>

<p>The road continued; and presently, in the dim light, I observed
that it followed a great fence: a fence of iron spikes as high as a
man could reach sitting in the saddle. It was fastened into cement
pillars, and it seemed to enclose all the lands off to my
right.</p>

<p>I took it to be a great parked estate. The wood beyond the fence
was cleared of brush, and I could sometimes see the extension of a
meadow. It was beyond question some great estate.</p>

<p>And I took courage from that observation.</p>

<p>There would perhaps be some friend of the Marquis, or at least
someone with a knowledge of the hunt, and if I were not put up for
the night, I would at least get some direction that would set me
intelligently on the road.</p>

<p>I followed along the great spiked fence, expecting to find an
entrance. There would be some way to go in at no inconsiderable
distance. But the hope dwindled. We went on&mdash;the unused road
paralleling the great parked estate, but shut out by this immense,
forbidding fence.</p>

<p>I must have traveled for several miles along that fence
enclosing this estate, but I never found a place that a fox could
go through or a mark that indicated that any human creature had
ever endeavored to pass.</p>

<p>And there was no gate.</p>

<p>I began to wonder what the accursed thing could be that this
immense wall of spearheads enclosed, and I felt myself confronted
by one of two discouraging alternatives: to sit down on a fallen
log by my horse until the day arrived or walk on in the rain.</p>

<p>I walked on.</p>

<p>Discomforts do not seem to be so acute when they accompany us in
action. I could not sit in a Belgian drizzle with a miserable
horse. And that wall of spikes went on, as though it were a sort of
wall of the world, as though I had come by some door through the
hill to the boundary of a forbidden country.</p>

<p>Finally I did find a light off to the left, and I turned out
toward it. I could not have gone on, at any rate, for the road
turned that way. The tangled wood that I feared to find, in fact,
appeared here as the outside border of the great spiked wall that
went straight on as though it had been surveyed from the French
border to the North Sea.</p>

<p>I supposed I followed the road for a mile at right angles to the
estate. I was now able to see the light. It was like a gleam of a
candle in a window; sometimes the brush, or a turn in the road,
shut it out. But it seemed always before me at the end of the road;
and there was, in fact, nothing to do but go on. It was now so dark
that I was hardly able to keep in the road&mdash;I with the
miserable, lame horse. I was wet to the skin and a rather ugly
human creature when I finally came to the light. It was a house
sitting on the rise of a hill.</p>

<p>I had a strange feeling as I pounded on the door with my riding
crop. The house was lighted, and the angles of it had shut off from
the road all but one light in the window by the door. My impression
of it was that I had wandered out of modern reality into some
romance. The thing did not seem real. I felt as though by some turn
I had got out of the world as I knew it.</p>

<p>It was a tavern with the setting of Dumas. The door was opened
by a little Walloon, dressed like a miller, except that his cap was
off and he wore an apron. Behind him, seated by a big oak table
that stood out in the room from a peat fire, was the strangest
human creature I have ever met. He was a big, old man with an
immense head; a head as bald as a gravestone&mdash;there was not a
fringe of hair on it. He had a heavy face, a big crooked nose, and
sharp eyes. The eyes were heavy-lidded; but there was no mistaking
the alert intelligence that they indicated.</p>

<p>The man was waiting for his dinner. I don't think he was pleased
to see a stranger enter. For a moment he looked surprised, I
thought, or disconcerted: put out in some manner. Perhaps it was
only annoyance. And then, when he had a better look at me, he got
up.</p>

<p>I had given my horse to the Walloon. He said he had stabling and
fodder for it. I seemed to be able to understand the sort of French
he gabbled in. In dreams and in the countries of romance we always
understand in any dialect that is spoken. At any rate, I understood
the Walloon, and I trusted the horse to him. And then I stood in
the door, my riding boots spattered with mud and the rain running
in tiny rivulets from my top hat and the creases of my riding
coat.</p>

<p>The old man leaned on the table and looked at me.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said. "There will be dinner for two and a fire to
dry you. It will be better to be wet inside than out on a night
like this." I thought he was going to laugh, but it was only the
shadow of a laugh. It began along the border of his great
thin-lipped mouth. It was a firm mouth, for all the heavy face.</p>

<p>The mouth and the eyes determined me. I began to explain what
had happened; how I had managed to arrive here.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me into what part of the world I have wandered?" I
said. He did laugh then: a laugh that did not disturb the massive
features; a laugh like a shadow passing over a wall.</p>

<p>"You have wandered into Asia," he said.</p>

<p>I thought the man was mad, but not entirely mad. You will have
to try to understand the state of mind I was in. You see, that
feeling of unreality had very nearly dominated the whole of my
intelligence. You will have to think about that to get any
conception of how this reply impressed me, I did not wholly reject
it. I had explained pretty fully all that had happened to me and
the way I had come. I put another query before I asked him to amend
his answer. "What is the great estate to the right of the road: the
one with the huge spiked fence along it?" The smile repassed over
his face. To be accurate, it came back over it.</p>

<p>"That is not an estate," he said: "that is a garden."</p>

<p>"A garden," I echoed.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "the Garden of Eden...You are in Asia."</p>

<p>I took off my wet top hat; I put my riding crop down beside it
and went over to the fire. The old man sat down in his chair before
the table. He continued to regard me sharply through the corners of
his heavy-lidded eyes, but he did not say anything. He gave some
directions to the Walloon, who came in just then. And that creature
of romance placed a second chair beyond the table and put out his
plates for another guest for the dinner he was roasting in his
kitchen. The odors of it came through the door. The dinner would
compensate for any sort of madness.</p>

<p>I think the big old man had been waiting a long time for that
dinner to be prepared. And the Walloon had taken a lot of care with
it, as for an imperial guest. Fortunately, it was abundant, for it
served two&mdash;a hungry man who had ridden to hounds and this
other.</p>

<p>My host was courteous.</p>

<p>"I know the Marquis de Brie," he said, "and the hunt, but it
does not belong here. It is in the world. It is on the Continent of
Europe...It is in Belgium." He made a gesture, as of one indicating
something beyond the land he was standing in.</p>

<p>"I am glad to be host to a guest of the Marquis," he said, "even
when he wanders into Asia."</p>

<p>He paused. "Do you believe the Bible story of the Garden of
Eden?"</p>

<p>I had a sudden flare of annoyance.</p>

<p>"I am not young enough to believe it," I said.</p>

<p>He looked at me a moment through his heavy-lidded eyes.</p>

<p>"You mean you are not old enough."</p>

<p>He beckoned me to the table, and we sat down. The wonderful
roast fowl, the old wine, the incomparable salad put me in a better
humor. The host permitted me to eat. I thought he was highly amused
with me, but he did not take his amusement with a hungry man.</p>

<p>It was some time before he began to talk.</p>

<p>"There is a man and a woman in that garden," he said, when I had
the comfort of that dinner and the warmth of a fire to put me in a
better mood.</p>

<p>"Not the first man and the first woman...but it is the same
garden."</p>

<p>Then he put a sharp query: "Do you believe in any of our
mysterious religions?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," I said.</p>

<p>He passed his hand over his face at that.</p>

<p>"You don't know; you are too young. One has to be old to know.
Perhaps one never gets old enough to know precisely."</p>

<p>He smiled again.</p>

<p>"Our greatest religion begins with a Garden in Asia. That is the
base of it; that is the point it starts from, and it carries a
warning that the young forget, but the old remember...There was the
witch of Endor, and there were the creatures with familiar spirits;
there was the magic of Pharaoh's magicians.</p>

<p>"You think it is not true? Have you ever considered the evidence
to support it&mdash;the testimony of the Scriptures and the witness
of every other early race?</p>

<p>"You know what the Akkadian Magi said about it: that all these
formulas of magic&mdash;formulas by which the natural world was
changed; by which the forms of men and beasts were changed, such as
the magicians of Pharaoh assembled&mdash;were all written down in
gold characters on six thousand ox hides and stored in the palace
of Darius at Persepolis...But they were lost!"</p>

<p>He made a gesture with his hand over the table.</p>

<p>"I quote the Magi. 'The barbarian Alexander, penetrating into
Asia, burned the palace at Persepolis with its contents, thereby
wiping out in a day the sum of all human knowledge.'"</p>

<p>He removed his hand. It was hidden by the cloth. There was a
cheap cloth on the table with an Oriental design.</p>

<p>"I wonder why we assume that all the early historians were
liars. Are we so truthful ourselves?</p>

<p>"There is the testimony of every one of them to the things I
say: the Scriptures, legends of early races; Arabian stories that
have come down to us and the writings of every wise man.</p>

<p>"Take Herodotus if you like, or take the greatest modern legal
mind in England...I mean Sir Matthew Hale. He said in his most
famous opinion that there was nothing so thoroughly established in
the world as witchcraft, for three reasons, which he named in their
order. First, that it was so stated in the Scriptures; second, that
all nations had made laws against it; and third, that the human
testimony in its favor was overwhelming."</p>

<p>That shadow of a smile returned for an instant across his
face.</p>

<p>"Do you know who I am?" he said.</p>

<p>I had been thinking all the while that I knew, but I could not
precisely place this extraordinary personality. I remembered
instantly when he said the name. Sir Godfrey Simon! Of course I
knew him! Everybody knew him. He was the greatest alienist in
England.</p>

<p>I regarded him now with a sort of wonder. What did he mean by
all this Delphic discourse: witches, magic, a Garden in Asia?</p>

<p>Here was one of the cleverest men in the world; one of the
shrewdest men; one of the hardest men to mislead in the world. He
was at the head of one of the most difficult professions in the
world: a profession that had to weigh and consider all kinds of
delusions, all kinds of fairy belief, all kinds of imagined
wizardry; a profession that must discover it and reject it; a
profession that must discriminate, clean-cut and accurately,
between the conceptions of sanity and the vast, shadowy realm of
madness.</p>

<p>And he sat here in this fantastic place commending me to a
belief in the most impossible legends; commending me to a belief in
magic, in witches, in familiar spirits, in the properties that
belong to the stories coming down to us from the baked earth in
Arabia.</p>

<p>And he laid it all in our modern life, in our age of trams and
spindles!</p>

<p>I tell you the story as he told me the story. You can believe
what you please about it. But it was true. I am able to write my
signature under that assurance. When you get on to the end you will
believe me...</p>

<p>You have all heard of the Countess of Heatherstone&mdash;that
unusual romance reversing the order of such adventures&mdash;an
American girl who married an English title and a lot of money with
it.</p>

<p>It is the only case I ever heard of.</p>

<p>The thing is usually the other way about, so you may remember it
for that conspicuous element. But the Countess is not in this
story. It is her brother, Arthur Letington, the American, that we
are concerned with. Some of you may have met Letington about. He
was not a usual person. He belonged with his sister to one of our
old Southern families, a family with a queer streak in
it&mdash;neurotic and not always normal.</p>

<p>I think it was his outdoor life that kept Letington fit. He went
in for sports. He was keen after hounds, and he was one of the best
polo players in the country; one of the best in England.</p>

<p>He was usually in England with his sister.</p>

<p>The Earl of Heatherstone was a canny Scotchman about his money.
He did not like to see it get away from him, and usually it did not
get away. He was one of the best men of business in England, for
all of his being an earl.</p>

<p>And that is one of the causes, the inciting causes, as one might
say it, of the extraordinary adventures I am coming to.</p>

<p>You see, Letington had no money and he had no profession. I
suppose he had a bit of an income from somewhere, but nothing to
speak of. I imagine his sister kept him going; mounted him in the
hunts and backed the polo at Roehampton and Ranelagh. It might have
gone on like that, but the earl had a notion that everybody should
be useful, and so I suppose the thing in a manner adjusted itself,
as such things have a way of doing.</p>

<p>At any rate, Letington found himself presently included in a
business venture. Heatherstone had every sort of iron in the fire
all over the British Empire; among other things, a little railway
in a section of timber land in Canada. It was a short line, built
primarily to bring out hemlock from lands over which the white pine
had been removed. It was not very much of a railway, but it had one
value: it was a link in one of the great transcontinental lines
across Canada to the Pacific.</p>

<p>I don't think the English stockholders realized very handsomely
from the manufacture of hemlock lumber. They could not compete with
the mills of the Americans.</p>

<p>Still, that was not the thing that got Heatherstone and his
stockholders going. It was the big economic situation in England. I
mean the lack of employment for labor. English labor was out of
work. It was the business of great commercial adventurers like
Heatherstone to find employment for it.</p>

<p>The government called him in.</p>

<p>They began to "put it up," as we would say, to the business men
of England like Heatherstone. The government had an inventory, a
sort of list of every English enterprise in the world, especially
the ones which employed foreign labor, and Heatherstone's little
railway was on the list. It was operated entirely by Italians.
There was not an English laborer on the plant.</p>

<p>It seemed queer to think of a lumber plant and a bit of a
railway, in a cold waste of Canada, operated by Italians. But there
is a point about this race that one must always consider. It will
go any place if it goes as a colony. And that is precisely how it
got into this sector of Canada. It had gone as a colony. It was a
portion of southern Italy laid down in a section of the north.</p>

<p>I don't know how the thing came about. I think the early advance
of the war was perhaps behind it; England and her dominions had no
man power to spare, and so the Italian colony came in. At any rate,
it was there, attached to the soil, a fixture in that wilderness,
as permanent as the villages of Salerno.</p>

<p>And it manned the whole plant, manufactured the lumber, stripped
the bark, operated the railway, and moved the great
transcontinental train that went over this line once in every
twenty-four hours. I mentioned that a moment ago. It was the one
industrial fact that made this piece of railway important. It was a
short cut on one of the big transcontinental lines. It was not a
permanent part of the line. It was never designed to be a permanent
part of it; but the main line through was being rebuilt and in the
meantime their fast passenger train went over this connecting link.
Heatherstone's road coupled the line together. They were paid
handsomely for the use of the road, but there was a condition. They
had to guarantee the safety of the train and its equipment while it
was on their line.</p>

<p>That gave Heatherstone and his stockholders some concern. But
they never had any trouble about it.</p>

<p>There was no complaint of the Italian colony. It did its work
well. They are the best stonemasons in the world. The large tunnel
on Heatherstone's line was a model in its way, wonderfully
stone-arched, Sir Godfrey Simon said.</p>

<p>So these were not the things that bothered Heatherstone and his
stockholders. It was the insistence of the government that they
should displace this Italian labor with labor from England. It was
a sort of national eviction they were after. And the government was
farsighted. It knew the only solution was to scatter the
unemployed; to spread them out over the Empire; that is to say,
over the world.</p>

<p>And it put its thumb on Heatherstone.</p>

<p>Now, that is how Letington came to get into the thing.</p>

<p>Heatherstone and his stockholders met, determined to send
somebody out to Canada to take charge of the enterprise and to
substitute English labor for the Italian.</p>

<p>Here was his brother-in-law, "idling," as the poets used to
write it, "between tennis and the bath;" that is to say, between
the shooting in Scotland and the polo at Roehampton; and so the
earl sent him.</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey Simon said that Letington was the last man to send,
if you looked at him from one angle.</p>

<p>He was not a man of business. He was a sportsman and he was a
dreamer. Any one would have seen this but the hard-headed earl. On
the other hand, he had a certain courage that fitted him for such a
venture. He was a big-game hunter; he had gone on all sorts of
expeditions into waste places of the earth; he knew how to handle
men, and he was not concerned about hardship.</p>

<p>But he was a sentimentalist.</p>

<p>At any rate, that was Heatherstone's final opinion and the
opinion of his stockholders.</p>

<p>The methods of these men were direct. They were not concerned
with circumlocutions. The order to Letington was to move that
Italian colony out&mdash;boots and baggage&mdash;and substitute
English labor for it!</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey Simon made an impressive picture of the situation
Letington found himself in. He saw at once how difficult the thing
could be.</p>

<p>The resolution directed him to remove from this Canadian forest
what was, as I have said, a complete section of Italy set down in
it. It was a difficult thing to undertake, and it was a brutal
thing.</p>

<p>Letington saw that the moment he went over the line.</p>

<p>Here were these foreign people with their families, their homes,
their gardens, their churches, their shrines; graves of their dead,
their schools&mdash;their civilization, in fact.</p>

<p>Where would they go? How would they continue to live when they
were ejected out of this New Italy? Where could he place them? That
was not a thing that Heatherstone and his stockholders had
considered. It was not a part of the English business problem. It
was, as I have said, sentimentalism. They were practical people.
Considerations of humanity had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>But humanity did have something to do with it.</p>

<p>Letington saw what he was "up against," as we would say, and he
made a protest. He sent in a report to the earl. He pointed it all
out to him.</p>

<p>It was a good paper, Sir Godfrey Simon said&mdash;a good paper
for impractical people who confused sentiments of humanity with
their business affairs. But it was a poor paper for the earl and
his stockholders. They gave Letington a pretty curt answer. He
would do what he was told! He was not there on God's business.</p>

<p>He was there on the affairs of an English company. He would
carry out the directions they gave him and leave his sentimentalism
to the ulterior Authority that considered the sparrow.</p>

<p>I do not mean that this was the message of the directors. It
never could have been the message of the Glasgow solicitor who was
secretary of the board. But it was the message as edited by Sir
Godfrey Simon.</p>

<p>Letington went over the line; over the plant.</p>

<p>It was a strip of railway well kept up; its bridges solid; its
one big tunnel a fine example of stone work. Everything was in
order: the little switches running out to the bark sheds; the mills
in the mountains; the Italian village, where the whole dependency
lived. The road was over a little valley, burrowing at one point
through a shoulder of a mountain. It was a mountainous country;
winter was on the way; snow would come presently, and then it would
be a sector of Switzerland. It was in the late autumn when
Letington went out.</p>

<p>There was nothing that Letington could do after he got the reply
of the Glasgow solicitor. He had either to go ahead or give the
thing up, and there was something in the man that balked at
failure. He was not a success in any way that our commercial age
would be apt to measure him. But he did not give things up. That
was the quality that made him one of the best sportsmen in his
class. He was not afraid, and he did not weaken.</p>

<p>So he called the Italian colony together and explained his
directions. The Italians said almost nothing at the time. I suppose
they could not realize it. But the idea began to move in them, and
they finally understood what the English company intended. When
they got the thing in their heads the whole colony was by the
ears.</p>

<p>They sent a committee to wait on Letington. They put the case
before him in their protest. They wished him to put their protest
before the company. He took a good deal of pains to make them
understand him then. He had put the matter before the company. He
got out his report, the report he had sent in to the earl and his
stockholders, and read it to them. He read it carefully and slowly.
And then he showed them the reply.</p>

<p>There must have been some sensible persons on that Italian
deputation. A common workman often has a clear head; an
understanding heart he nearly always has. They said nothing more,
and they went out. Letington was misled. He imagined the colony had
accepted this decree of eviction. It was a profound error. The
Italians had merely realized that it was of no use to make further
protest. The English company would not change.</p>

<p>Two or three days later an extraordinary thing happened.</p>

<p>An Italian woman, accompanied by two or three laborers, came in
to see Letington.</p>

<p>They wished a private conference with him, and they were
admitted to his office. The woman looked like a Neapolitan peasant.
She wore the picturesque costume of Salerno. She was of middle age.
But there was something about her that profoundly impressed
Letington when he came to observe her closely. Her big, determined
features gave him the impression of a powerful personality who by
an accident of birth had arrived from a low racial origin.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the fact that she was an extraordinary
person. She did not speak English, or, at any rate, only a few
words of it.</p>

<p>The men with her began to explain.</p>

<p>They used a lot of words and gestures, and they interrupted one
another in their effort to make their meaning clear in a language
in which they felt themselves to be deficient. But they finally
made Letington understand. He did not understand the Italian word
they used, but he did understand what they were meaning by it. The
woman was what we would call in our plain English tongue a witch.
She had a familiar spirit. She had a control of what we call
supernatural forces, or, rather, to be more accurate, a
supernatural control of what we call natural forces, and when they
got that idea before Letington they coupled their threat with
it.</p>

<p>They said if he undertook to put his policy into effect, this
woman would cause the great engine that pulled the transcontinental
train over the line to disappear. They elaborated the threat with
the figures of their Italian tongue and with vague gestures. The
engine would vanish.</p>

<p>Of course Letington was not misled about it. He thought he
understood perfectly what was behind all this theatrical property.
The thing was just a plain threat to wreck the train!</p>

<p>This was serious. As I have said, the English guaranteed the
safety of the train over this line: to wreck it would be to destroy
the company.</p>

<p>But the threat carried farther. If the engine were wrecked,
would the crowded passenger coaches escape? The thing might carry
murder with it. He could see all sorts of disasters extending
themselves from this threat, and he said what he thought.</p>

<p>The Italian workmen with the woman protested with great vigor.
No one would be hurt; no part of the great transcontinental train
would be injured; there would be no scratch on paint of a coach;
there would be no battering of a bolt in the engine. Nothing would
be injured.</p>

<p>The great engine would simply disappear.</p>

<p>This woman, this witch, this person with the supernatural
control of the natural forces of the world, by her magic would
simply remove that engine from sight and hearing. The train would
remain! That was what they meant.</p>

<p>They went out with the promise that they would return and show
Letington what the woman could do; that is to say, she was going to
give him an example of the power she possessed.</p>

<p>What precisely did this mean? Was it, in fact, what he first
imagined, a veiled threat to derail the great train? That would be
simple enough and not outside of probability. Not, in fact, outside
of a possible event&mdash;there was precedent enough for it.</p>

<p>The Latin was racially influenced to revenge.</p>

<p>It was with him a form of human injustice. Northern races,
logically and coldly, might adjust their difficulties in
third-party tribunals, but revenge is an act of the Latin. It is a
conception of justice common to peoples of a hotter blood. It is an
old, deep-seated instinct. When one received an injury, one
returned it. When a village or a family received an injury, it
returned it. This seemed the adequate explanation, if, in fact, the
threat meant anything. It was hardly likely that even ignorant
Italians were moved by the idea that they could frighten an English
company out of a plan on which it had decided or that they could
frighten its manager here.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon was not easily intimidated. You could not,
usually, move him with a threat. And yet these explanations, when
one undertook to apply them to the event, did not seem wholly
adequate. There must be something more behind this extravagance.
Frankly, the man was puzzled; he was also alarmed, but he was not
in fear. He was not the sort of person to be easily put in fear.
Still, he could not rid himself of a sort of concern about it. The
thing must mean something, and he recalled the indirections and the
extravagant innuendo of the Italian speech. He expected something
to happen, but the thing that did happen was alien to any idea in
the man.</p>

<p>The Italians said they would return and this woman, this witch,
this person with the familiar spirit would show him what she could
do.</p>

<p>And she did return.</p>

<p>Some days later they came in again to Letington&mdash;the
Italian workmen and this woman. It was rather late in the
evening&mdash;twilight, in fact. Night was descending. Letington
was alone. He had remained to go over some reports of the office.
The man was, in fact, conscientious about the business of this
company, and he was endeavoring to get up the details on it; going
back to see how his predecessor had managed the business. This is
how he came to be alone and in the office of the company at this
late hour.</p>

<p>Three persons entered.</p>

<p>But there was now with them a fourth person&mdash;a little, old
woman, feeble and not able to walk. The Italian laborers carried
her in gently and put her into a chair at the end of the room. She
was dressed in the deep, somber mourning of the Italian women in
the bereavement of death. Without being able to see any feature of
her, Letington said it was impossible to escape the conviction that
the woman was immensely, incredibly old and of such frailty that
the slightest exertion would eject her out of life. With the others
was the big, sturdy Italian woman, in the dress of a peasant of
Salerno.</p>

<p>She stood in the center of the group, a figure of strength and
vigor.</p>

<p>She had, as I have said, and as Letington continually insisted,
the dominance of uncultivated persons, who by some strange order of
nature seemed foreordained for a certain direction of events;
having, in fact, a certain authority of action in the presence of
unusual events. I gave some examples a while ago. You have all met
with these examples. You know what Letington meant, and you know
what I mean here in my effort to put this extraordinary story
before you.</p>

<p>The group said very little.</p>

<p>Letington never could recall any significant conversation. The
Italian workmen, who carried in the woman, made some usual
salutation. They bid him "Good evening," or something of the sort,
and they may have uttered some expression to indicate the object of
their arrival: that they came to verify what they had said, or the
like. He thought they did say something of this character.</p>

<p>He was not certain.</p>

<p>What happened was too extraordinary. The verbal passages
preceding it did not sufficiently impress him. At any rate, they
were not important. They had, in fact, come to give the
demonstration, as one would call it; to show what the witch could
do before she undertook the thing she threatened&mdash;to put teeth
into the threat, as we would say. If the approaches to the event
were not recalled in sharp outlines, we must believe that the event
itself was sufficiently vivid. Letington may have forgotten what
they said; but he never forgot what happened.</p>

<p>The big peasant woman made him a curtsy. He said it reminded him
of that exaggeration which a certain old dancing master in London
used to demonstrate to the American women about to be presented at
the Court of St. James. It had an Old World, out-of-fashion aspect
about it.</p>

<p>Something in a fairy story was the idea I got; the kind of
extreme gesture of the Foreign Envoy at the Court of the King of
the Golden Mountains! I can only present the thing by this
indirection. You know what I mean.</p>

<p>Letington said another thing about it that makes the
illustration I suggest a bit more apt. He said it was ironical, as
though it were made before a mock authority; as though superior
persons presented themselves before a pretender. It would be the
way a jinni would bow before a mortal king in an Arabian story
before he produced his magic city or his winged horse.</p>

<p>After that curtsy, the woman took out of the bosom of her dress
what appeared to be a ball of grass made up with resin. She held it
in the palm of her hand. One of the Italian workmen ran forward,
got a coal from the fire, and touched it to the ball of resin.</p>

<p>The thing began to smoke.</p>

<p>It smoked feebly at first, after the manner of a wet wisp of
hay, scarcely afire. The smoke arose like a fantastic flower, a
thin stem curling and expanding at the summit. Then it extended
itself. It extended itself vaguely until the whole room was filled
with an aromatic odor, a sort of haze. Letington said the thing
went on until the ball of resin in the woman's hand was consumed,
and the result was that strange aromatic odor filling the whole
space and a haze as though one had caught and confined here the
sort of blue-gray haze observed on our mountains in the autumn, in
what we call Indian summer.</p>

<p>There had been no sound.</p>

<p>There was absolute silence in the room. Letington said he did
not move. He looked on as if at some extravaganza, but he was
impressed. The thing got him, as we might say, into a sort of
atmosphere. The strange thing was that it did not seem to be
absurd. It seemed to be a sort of phenomenon of some character
appearing with a certain aspect of dignity.</p>

<p>We cannot understand, I fear, precisely how he thought about it.
At any rate, the peasant woman standing thus, surrounded with this
impalpable smoke haze, as of something arising from the earth about
her, suddenly cried out, extending her hand.</p>

<p>Letington said it was a harsh cry. He often thought about it
afterward. It was not in any language that he knew. He did not
think the words the woman uttered were of the Italian language. He
thought it was an older, harsher language. And it was a sort of
formula. It was a cry that seemed to shatter or, as one would say,
break down a barrier already thinned or weakened. That is an
inadequate explanation of the effect. But Letington said he had
some sort of vague conception of that character. He had no idea of
what would happen, but the thing that did happen was beyond any
conception that he could have had.</p>

<p>I have said that the Italian laborers brought in an old woman
and put her in a chair in the corner of the room. Now, at this cry,
the feeble figure in the chair rose. It came up stiffly to its feet
like an image of wood, and then it began to sing.</p>

<p>Letington said that he remained immovable with wonder.</p>

<p>The singing was something heavenly. The rich, deep, beautiful
voice filled the room: extended itself; seemed to fill the
world.</p>

<p>He said the thing was incredible beyond any winging of the
fancy.</p>

<p>He had never heard such a voice. It was not the volume of it,
for it lacked great volume; it was not the vigor of it nor any
unusual note. There was a haunting music in it, an appealing
sweetness&mdash;something that got into one's spirit and there
awakened every romantic fancy.</p>

<p>It was incredible. It belonged in a fairy story; in the
properties of romance. It seemed to the man that he was hearing
something that he had read about in the poets of old time, in
ancient romances, as though the practical world had turned
backward&mdash;revolved backward&mdash;into a world of wonder.</p>

<p>It was the golden-snooded muse, singing in the Seven-Gated City
of Thebis! He could see the fairy city in the air&mdash;a mirage of
gilded towers and veiled brazen gates on a cloud island; and the
voice coming from an interminable distance, but losing nothing,
neither its vigor nor any tone!</p>

<p>It had that marvelous quality.</p>

<p>It was far away, and it was not far away. He said he could not
differentiate the singing from the conceptions of romance that
arrived with it. It was something singing behind the horns of
Elfland in some kingdom of faërie: singing among the stars in
unending summer, in undying youthfulness! He said every extravagant
expression that he could think of paled before the wonder of that
heavenly reality.</p>

<p>Then the figure collapsed. The big peasant woman caught it. They
wrapped it up in a shawl and carried it out.</p>

<p>Letington did not move. He remained in his chair behind his
table, that plain oak table, with the records of the company
littering it before him. He sat there for a long time without
thought, as he used to try to express it, and without motion, as
one recovering from a drug or a hypnotic envelopment. He did not
know what had happened to him. The thing was too unreal; it was too
improbable; it was too utterly beyond all human sense.</p>

<p>The footsteps of the Italians carrying out the ancient, feeble
woman grew vague, and ceased. There was again silence; the haze in
the room disappeared. The aromatic odor thinned out, ceased to
exist. But the man remained in his chair. Finally he put his hand
up and passed it over his face, as though by that gesture to remove
an illusion.</p>

<p>That, of course, was the only explanation he had. That was the
only explanation anyone could have. Of course there wasn't any
explanation. What sane person could believe in witches or in a
magic that transported one from a modern, workaday world to a land
of fairies; that took an ancient, feeble crone, so old that she had
to be carried about, and forced her by a harsh cry to sing like a
fabled siren in faërie lands forlorn!</p>

<p>Of course there wasn't any explanation.</p>

<p>The man went out after a while, but he said that he did a thing
that any one of us would have done. He said that he went about the
room touching objects in it, replacing chairs, adjusting the table,
trying the door latch.</p>

<p>You see what he was after!</p>

<p>He was trying to convince himself that he was in a world of
reality&mdash;just what any of us would have done&mdash;that he
was, in fact, here in this place; that the place had not changed;
that it was the same place.</p>

<p>After that he went out.</p>

<p>There was only one explanation of it that didn't overturn every
landmark of our common reason. He believed himself to be a victim
of some hypnotic influence, as the traveler in some city of the
East, in an enclosed courtyard, sees a rope thrown into the air by
a juggler, and a lad climb it into the sky, disappearing, a tiny
figure in some cloud haze. That was the explanation Letington
finally got about it. He had to take that or go adrift. But it
seemed neither an adequate nor a true explanation of the
phenomenon.</p>

<p>It was the voice that he could not escape from. That voice was
real. The singing was real. He could differentiate the effects from
the voice. The effects were illusions, but that haunting, heavenly
voice was a reality! He could no more doubt the reality of it than
he could doubt the reality of the sunlight, or the outline of the
forest in the distance, or his hand. The voice was real, and it
affected him as had no other singing in the world.</p>

<p>He never heard a voice like it.</p>

<p>He could not escape from the lure of that voice. It seemed to
have entered into every fiber of his body: something he had long
sought; something he had hungered for; something he had waited for
from the time he was born&mdash;and from beyond that&mdash;from the
beginning of the world.</p>

<p>I am taking a lot of pains to try to make these impressions
clear to you, for they are a vital part of this extraordinary
thing. Perhaps you can, in some manner, realize how the thing
impressed this man. I suppose one would have to call it an
exclusive personal element. There was a feeling that the voice had
something to do with himself, as differentiated from other persons;
as though no one but himself could have heard it, or as though it
could have been intended for no other person. It was his due:
belonged to him out of some other existence.</p>

<p>That is as near as I can get it out of the elaboration that Sir
Godfrey Simon gave me. At any rate, that was the end of it. Things
went on. Letington imagined himself to have been present at an
inexplicable phenomenon, a sort of hypnotic phenomenon. It had put
his reason out of dominance. He had a feeling of anxiety about
events now that he could neither define nor control.</p>

<p>And it was a correct premonition.</p>

<p>He went ahead endeavoring to put into effect the policy of
eviction that he had been sent here to accomplish. The Italian
colony made no further protest. It carried out the preliminaries of
his direction. The notices posted were not disturbed. The orders
for inventories on materials and tools were carried out. The first
preliminaries of the eviction went forward, and there was no
disorder. There was not even discourtesy.</p>

<p>Everywhere he was received with the same deference; his
directions were received with the same silent acquiescence. But it
was a calm that had too much serenity in it. He did not like it. He
would have felt safer if he had found groups of men talking
together; evidences of violence here and there; protests, or ugly
threats echoed after him as he passed: that is to say, the usual
thing that one expects and can understand. But he did not find it.
The whole colony was composed, silent and obsequious. It got on the
man's nerves.</p>

<p>And then suddenly the thing happened.</p>

<p>Winter was beginning to arrive. At twilight one evening the
great transcontinental was stopped by an emergency signal. Snow was
beginning to fall. It was on a slight grade beyond the Italian
village. When the train stopped there was an insistent call for the
fireman and engineer to come to the rear of the train. They got
down and went back along the coaches. It was now coming on to snow
heavily. They passed down on either side of the coaches to the end
of the train. But they could find no reason for the emergency
signal. No official in the coaches knew anything about it, and no
one could be found who had called. The conductor joined them. They
went to the extreme end of the train, but they could find nothing
to indicate why such a signal should have been given.</p>

<p>And when they returned the engine was gone!</p>

<p>It had disappeared. The train officials released the brakes and
ran the passenger coaches back into the village. Letington,
awakened at one o'clock in the morning, was told of this mysterious
event.</p>

<p>Don't forget where I was when I got this story. Keep that in
your mind. I was before a peat fire in an inn in Belgium, as I told
you in the beginning. I had turned about from the table. I was wet,
and my clothes steamed, but I was comfortable with an excellent
dinner. There was a bottle of wine on the table, and Sir Godfrey
Simon on the other side of it. You will remember what I said about
him. A big, old man with a perfectly bald head&mdash;a head as bald
as an ivory door handle&mdash;a crooked nose; a wide, narrow-lipped
mouth; little, sharp eyes under craggy eye pits; shaggy, arched
brows over them.</p>

<p>It is his story that I am trying to tell you&mdash;not mine.</p>

<p>I know nothing about it, except what the man said. That I
precisely know. I remember every detail. No word of it escaped me.
It was the most extraordinary tale I had ever heard, in the most
extraordinary setting, surrounded by the most extraordinary
suggestions.</p>

<p>I was lost, and I had turned up as by the directions of the
fairies at this inn, by this Garden in Asia and the long,
iron-spiked fence that seemed, as I have said, to stretch across
Belgium, across Europe, across the world.</p>

<p>That was the hard background behind all this extravaganza. It
was the thing at my back. That is a pretty good expression. It was
the Garden in Asia at my back that made the whole of this story
such a wonder.</p>

<p>I go back to Letington and the disaster he was awakened out of
sleep to meet. Of course there could, in fact, be no mystery to
speak of about the matter. A great passenger engine could not
disappear. Stop a moment and realize it: a thing of complicated
machinery weighing five hundred thousand pounds. It was a late
model of the American passenger engine, one of these huge monsters
built to haul a long train over mountains across a continent.</p>

<p>Such engines are unknown in any European country.</p>

<p>It would weigh, as I have said, some two hundred and fifty tons.
Try to get a conception of such a mass of metal. And it was
valuable. It was worth a hundred thousand dollars. It could not be
made to disappear at the will of a peasant woman burning a ball of
aromatic grass and uttering a verbal formula.</p>

<p>Of course it had been cut off from the train and run forward in
the absence of the engineer and fireman, who had been drawn back to
the rear of the passenger coaches by what they took to be the call
of the conductor.</p>

<p>It was a clever trick in a snowstorm.</p>

<p>But where could the engine have been taken? It was a
single-track road, and short, connecting the two branches of the
transcontinental line. As it passed through the valley one saw from
it only the little mills that dotted the lumber yards; the great
sheds under which the hemlock bark was stored for shipment to the
tanneries, looking like immense hillocks covered with roofs of
bark; the scattered villages of the lumbermen; the narrow river;
and beyond the vast mountains that seemed to extend into the
sky.</p>

<p>The engine could not have gone back, because the passenger
coaches were behind it. These coaches had been released and run
down the grade to the Italian village. The engine had to go
forward.</p>

<p>As I have said, there could not be very much of a mystery about
it, and, in fact, there was not any mystery about it.</p>

<p>There was a tunnel through a shoulder of the mountain just
beyond where the engine had been cut off. Letington and his track
crew, going over the line in the morning, found the entrances to
this tunnel shot down.</p>

<p>It was clear now what had occurred.</p>

<p>The engine had been run into the tunnel and the ends of the
tunnel shot down with explosives to prevent it from being taken
out. The whole thing had been done cleverly and with Italian
cunning.</p>

<p>But there was no mystery about it.</p>

<p>The agents carrying the thing into effect had selected a night
of storm, one of those nights of early winter when heavy snow was
approaching. They had given an emergency signal. It would be easy
to do that. Any one of them could have boarded the train as a
passenger and given such a signal precisely as the conductor or
officials in the rear of the train might have given it. And they
could have called the engineer and fireman to the rear of the
train, precisely as the conductor might have done. There was no
difficulty about this part of the business.</p>

<p>There was no particular difficulty about the other part. The
Italian colony operating the plant contained more than one
competent engineer. Any one of them could have handled this engine,
or any engine. They could cut it loose from the train and run it
forward in the absence of the engineer and fireman, especially in a
snowstorm in the night. And that was precisely what had been
done.</p>

<p>Letington was not misled about it.</p>

<p>He knew what had happened, and when he found the entrances to
the tunnel on either side of the shoulder of this mountain shot
down with explosives, as though there had been a landslide, he knew
where the engine was. In fact, the thing was all so simple that the
man began to wonder at the circumlocutions of pretended magic that
had accompanied it. That, however, would be the Latin mind. But to
the hard Anglo-Saxon intelligence it seemed a sort of child's
play.</p>

<p>What value, in fact, was to be obtained by all this extravaganza
surrounding so evident and practical a fact?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was the situation to be met.</p>

<p>The great train could not go over the line, and the engine was
sealed up in a tunnel. The work had been done thoroughly.</p>

<p>As I have said, the approaches to the tunnel looked as though
they had been covered with a landslide. The persons who undertook
this thing carried it out effectively. The shoulder of mountain on
either side of the tunnel had been shot down to cover the entrance.
It was a big undertaking to clear it, and besides the snow made the
work more difficult. It continued to fall. It was one of those
heavy storms that bring winter into this north country.</p>

<p>Letington was very much concerned about this disaster, and he
put everybody on inquisition, but of course he could discover
nothing.</p>

<p>No one in the whole colony knew anything about it. They had seen
nothing; heard nothing.</p>

<p>There was not a word, a gesture, or an incident that he could
get hold of that could connect the affair with anybody.</p>

<p>Every man in the colony demonstrated that he was about his usual
affairs at this hour. Everybody could establish an alibi. There was
not a court in Christendom that could have found a clew to connect
anybody in the colony with this affair. There was no one in this
Italian settlement who would admit any connection with the affair,
with the single exception of the Italian peasant woman. She
admitted it.</p>

<p>She came into the office where Letington would be holding his
courts of inquiry, and she would stand there and look at him with
her strange, ironical smile.</p>

<p>She laughed at his explanation; at the effort he was making; at
his practical solution of the difficulty. He would never get his
engine out from under the mountain. She had made that engine to
disappear!</p>

<p>And this gave him further anxiety.</p>

<p>He took it to mean that the engine had been destroyed in the
tunnel. He was now greatly alarmed. The safety of the train and the
contract of the company to secure the daily safe passage over the
line would bankrupt the enterprise, already heavily involved. The
man saw complete disaster before him.</p>

<p>Of course there was only one thing to do, and that was to
uncover the approaches to the tunnel and get the engine out as soon
as he could. Here he was met with a further concern. The Italian
labor, which he must make use of, would perhaps either refuse to
work or it would hinder his efforts in some way. This meant that
the undertaking would go forward slowly; and in the meantime, if
the engine were not already destroyed, it would be seriously
injured. The tunnel would be damp; the delicate machinery of the
engine would be injured by the rust.</p>

<p>At the best he could hope for, there would be great delay, a
violation of the contract with the transcontinental line and injury
to the machinery. But could he, in fact, get it out? Could he
depend on the Italian labor for this service?</p>

<p>When he considered the whole matter he was firmly convinced that
he could not. But in this conclusion he was conspicuously mistaken.
He had not the slightest difficulty with the Italian laborers. They
went to work at his direction to uncover the approaches to the
tunnel. But the great snow delayed them, and after that was cleared
away there were still tons of earth to be removed. It was like
making a new cut into the shoulder of the mountain.</p>

<p>Letington was uncertain what to do.</p>

<p>He reported the accident briefly, by cable, to the English
company. And then he made out a report of what had occurred. He had
to send this report by mail. That would mean practically a month
before he had a reply. The answer to his cable was to make no
concession to the Italian colony; to put the tunnel in shape, and
to go forward with the policy of eviction as he had been
instructed. The English company would make whatever adjustments
were necessary with the transcontinental line with which they had
their agreement of carriage. Letington went forward under that
instruction.</p>

<p>One of the logging engines pulled the coaches back to the
junction with the main line, and they went around in another
direction to the main line beyond. In the meantime Letington went
forward with the work of opening the tunnel. This work, as I have
said, advanced slowly.</p>

<p>The heavy winter weather continued. Snow fell and had
continually to be removed. The shoulder of the mountain at the
opening of the tunnel was sheer; the earth kept slipping in.
Letington put every man at his disposal to work on the thing, and
although he had no reason to complain of either the individual
effort or the unity of effort of his crew, the advance was
slow.</p>

<p>Neither did he abandon his effort to discover who had been
connected with the affair. Every morning at daylight he was with
the crew at their work before the tunnel, and every night he
conducted his court of inquiry in the office. The men, the women of
the colony were examined; even the children were interrogated; but
it was entirely useless.</p>

<p>He never discovered anything.</p>

<p>Everyone professed utter ignorance in the affair. They were just
as much astonished and amazed as he was. When he asked them what
had become of the engine they merely shrugged their shoulders: How
did they know?</p>

<p>And always the sturdy peasant woman was in the room with her
strange, ironical smile. What was the use of all these inquiries or
this questioning of men and children? She could tell him all about
it. What had happened was precisely what she had warned him would
happen. Why go forward with his ridiculous efforts to discover the
author of this disaster? The author was before him. She had
accomplished the thing. It was her work. She admitted it.</p>

<p>She had caused the engine to disappear.</p>

<p>And then she would add her Delphic sentence:</p>

<p>"You will never get your engine out from under the
mountain."</p>

<p>The thing got on the man's nerves, and finally he abandoned any
further effort to discover who were the criminal agents in this
affair. He closed the office at night, gave up his courts of
inquiry and devoted himself to the effort of opening the
tunnel.</p>

<p>I suppose a man never made a greater or more persistent effort
than Letington did to drive a heading into the tunnel. He was, as I
said, profoundly disturbed. He was not puzzled. He knew where the
engine was, and the intent of the thing was all clearly before him.
But the veiled threat in the continually repeated sentence of the
Italian woman more and more impressed him.</p>

<p>"You will never get your engine out from under the
mountain!"</p>

<p>That might have two or three meanings. It might mean that the
engine was not under the mountain. But that phase of the oracular
expression he could at once dismiss. There was no other place that
it could be. It could not have been run on over the line. It would
have been discovered, of course. The line in a southern direction
connected with the transcontinental line ahead. It could not have
been taken in that direction. Nobody could conceal an immense
passenger engine on a track. And there was no other place to take
it.</p>

<p>When one stops to think about it, what could be more conspicuous
than a passenger engine?</p>

<p>One could not put it in one's pocket like a bauble nor tuck it
under a board. The thing was, of course, out of the question;
besides, here were the ends of the tunnel shot down. This feature
of the matter did not concern him. He dismissed it precisely as you
or I would have dismissed it. But the thing that did concern him
was whether the engine was destroyed.</p>

<p>"You will never get your engine out from under the
mountain!"</p>

<p>That would mean either that he would never get the tunnel clear,
and therefore could not get it out, or it meant that the engine
was, in fact, destroyed, and therefore he would not get it out.</p>

<p>There was anxiety enough in either of these two
alternatives.</p>

<p>Of course his first impression was that the woman meant that he
would not be able to uncover the openings of the tunnel. She could
very well depend on that. He had only this Italian labor to use for
the undertaking, and all of it, he could well assume, would be out
of sympathy with his effort.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, he was mistaken in that.</p>

<p>He was looking for some indication of that intent all the time,
but he never saw the slightest evidence of it. He had no complaint
to make. He observed the men on day and night shifts. He thought,
in the beginning, that when he went away from the work at night to
sleep he would find in the morning that his night crew had done
nothing or that it had done something to impair the work that had
gone forward in the day. He was amazed when he found this was not
true. The work of the crew at night had been as efficient and
apparently as sincere in its efforts as the crew that he handled in
the day.</p>

<p>I made a point of this because it had a bearing on the
essentials of the story. It puzzled Letington, and it puzzled me
when Sir Godfrey Simon got a little farther on with his narrative.
It puzzled me because in this extraordinary story we came
continually, it seemed, in contact with things that were what one
would call out of reason or out of the usual experience of men.
This was one of the features of it.</p>

<p>The whole story is out of reason.</p>

<p>It is out of the common experience of men. I suppose the
profound impression it made on me was merely the cumulative effect
of all these details bearing the same aspect. One does not get a
great impression of wonder or unreality out of the influence of a
single event. It is built up. It is made of a variety of smaller
events. It is the converging point of a great mass of
trivialities.</p>

<p>I don't give you that as my conclusion.</p>

<p>It was Sir Godfrey Simon's conclusion, and if you want to value
the weight of it, think for a moment who he was, who he is to-day;
the greatest alienist in England: that is to say, the greatest
authority on the orderly procedure of the human mind, or would I
better say the greatest authority on the disorderly procedure of
the human mind?</p>

<p>At any rate, you understand what I mean.</p>

<p>I mean it was his business, his profession, to discriminate
between the normal activities of the mind and those that were not
normal. And he stood above every man in his profession. He has not
an equal in the world. Anybody who knows anything about that
profession knows that Sir Godfrey Simon is at the head of it. I
think I told you all this in the beginning; that it was some time
before I recognized the man when I came into that Dumas Inn with
the Garden in Asia behind me. I did not know him for a while. I had
a haunting memory of a face. And then, when he told me who he was,
I remembered. I think I said that. Here before me at the table was
Sir Godfrey Simon, the greatest alienist in England.</p>

<p>This digression is not a matter of inadvertence.</p>

<p>I put it here for a purpose: with a profound purpose, as you
will realize in a moment. Carry it in your mind when you note the
next thing that happened. I pass over the long labor of driving a
heading into the tunnel. But the point I wish to consider is that
when the heading was finally driven, the engine was not in the
tunnel!</p>

<p>I leave you to realize what Letington thought when he crawled
through the opening of the heading and went with a torch to the
other end. The whole tunnel was clear. The headings were driven in
practically at the same time. There was nothing in the tunnel!</p>

<p>The thing was absurd, incredible. It was fantastic. It was
anything you wish to say. There is no language, in fact, to express
the incredibility of such an event. But there it was.</p>

<p>An immense passenger engine, weighing five hundred thousand
pounds, and as big as a peasant's house, had simply disappeared,
vanished!</p>

<p>The thing was a vast preposterous impossibility.</p>

<p>You cannot imagine what Letington's impressions were. He was
like one before a reversal of the order of nature: trees that
moved; animals that uttered words, or anything you like. There was
no explanation! You can see that. What explanation could one give?
Suppose you had been with him; suppose you had been, in fact, the
man himself when you had crawled through the hole of one heading
and gone with a torch along that single track, and crawled out into
the air through the hole of the other heading, and found nothing in
the tunnel. What would you have thought about it?</p>

<p>But, as I have said, there it was!</p>

<p>A huge piece of machinery weighing five hundred thousand pounds
had vanished at the will of a peasant woman burning a ball of
aromatic grass! Letington went back to the office of the company in
the little village and sat down.</p>

<p>He did not know what to do.</p>

<p>He did not even know what to say to his English company; what to
say to anybody. Who would believe this extraordinary thing?
Heatherstone and his board of directors would come to one of two
conclusions: that the man was as mad as a March hare or that he was
in collusion with the Italians. One could not blame them. This is
exactly what you would have thought. You might have thought, of
course, that a simple-minded person had been tricked. But Letington
was not a simpleminded person.</p>

<p>I have told you precisely what happened.</p>

<p>Now comprehend it in every detail, and see what you would have
done in his place; where your intelligence would have been superior
to his, or where any trick about it could have come in. Sir Godfrey
Simon shot that query at me, and I considered it pretty carefully.
I considered it for a good while, sitting there in the Dumas Inn,
drying my riding clothes before the peat fire. I could not see
anything, any precaution, any effort that I could have made that
Letington had not as well or as adequately also made.</p>

<p>That is how I ask you to think about it.</p>

<p>And think about another thing. What would you have done when you
came to meet the problem of giving these facts to the English
company; to the sane world? I think any of us would have been in
precisely the position Letington was. We would not have known what
to do. I am going to tell you what he did do.</p>

<p>It was not a sudden determination. He thought about the thing a
while. He thought about it while the work of clearing up the tunnel
went forward. They got all the earth out of the way, the stone
arches up, the track cleared.</p>

<p>The man could not keep away from the work.</p>

<p>He kept walking through that tunnel. He could not believe what
had happened, and it was time, it was delay that built up the state
of mind to the point where he was receptive of the measure which he
finally undertook.</p>

<p>He called in the sturdy peasant woman.</p>

<p>Now, that sounds like absurdity!</p>

<p>She repeated her preposterous offer. She would cause the engine
to materialize again, provided Letington would agree not to evict
the Italians. She would make the engine appear&mdash;re-appear, to
be more accurate&mdash;perfect as it was on the night that it had
vanished out of sight and hearing; not a scratch on the paint.
Letington did not say anything at the time. But the pressure on him
increased, and finally he agreed to the terms. And almost
immediately the engine appeared, precisely at the place on the
track where it had vanished, in perfect condition, under full
steam.</p>

<p>He did, as a matter of fact, make a pretty full explanation of
the matter to the English company, and it was received precisely as
he foresaw. They did think he was insane.</p>

<p>But that is not a point in the story I wish you to consider
here. It comes in a little later. Letington was haunted by that
wonderful singing voice. He wanted to hear it again. And, having
packed his luggage&mdash;prepared himself, as one would say, to
escape out of this land of unreality&mdash;he determined to have a
further experience of it.</p>

<p>He sent for the peasant woman.</p>

<p>He asked to see the ancient singer; to hear her again. He put
the profound problem that disturbed him, the problem that could
have no adequate explanation. How could this singer be old, senile,
feeble, at the end of life, and still possess this heavenly,
sensuous voice of adolescence?</p>

<p>The peasant woman made a gesture.</p>

<p>It was all the business of magic. The form was nothing; youth
and age were alike merely manifestations of the spirit! The formula
that caused the spirit to take on a physical aspect could produce
it as easily in one aspect as in another. That physical aspect
could not be changed, but the thing at any period in its former
existence could be reproduced.</p>

<p>Let me give an illustration out of the one book with which
everybody is familiar.</p>

<p>When the Witch of Endor called up Samuel she could have called
him up at any age of his life period: when he was a youth serving
in the temple, at mid-life or at the end of it.</p>

<p>That's the explanation the Italian woman gave Letington.</p>

<p>She did not give him this illustration of it. I put that in
here. She was trying to make Letington understand that the form of
this mysterious singing woman that she had called up was merely an
incident. She could call her up at any period: in youth as well as
at the very end of her life. Letington had been permitted to hear
the voice, but not to see the singer.</p>

<p>And then she uttered a significant sentence: "You can be made to
see her, but the agencies behind the world sell their gifts: to
gain great treasure one must suffer great sacrifice."</p>

<p>Then she gave him a Delphic promise:</p>

<p>"You may win your way to this woman&mdash;young, perfect, as
beautiful as a dream&mdash;if you should lose the sun."</p>

<p>Letington did not understand what she meant.</p>

<p>He understood later on, but that is going ahead of the story. He
did understand that the woman was repeating in a vague way those
esoteric expressions which the performers of magic have brought
forward from the day of Pharaoh. The physical thing visible to our
eye, audible to our ear, is merely an illusion.</p>

<p>The human spirit alone is a reality!</p>

<p>At its will and according to formula, carefully worked in the
morning of the world, all physical manifestations presented
themselves. At any rate, she promised Letington that he should hear
the voice again and that he should see the singer.</p>

<p>She took him to one of the remote Italian villages, adjacent to
the mountains. It was an empty village. The Italian workmen had
removed to the line of the railway. There were only abandoned
houses here, as though some plague, or some fear, had removed the
inhabitants. Beyond this village a narrow path led into the
forest.</p>

<p>Letington and the woman were alone.</p>

<p>She strode along in front of him, a big, sturdy peasant. And he
followed. They entered the forest, traversed it for some time, and
finally came out into a little meadow where some pioneer had once
cleared a farm.</p>

<p>Across the meadow beyond them at the edge of the forest was a
cottage. The afternoon sun had removed the snow from the meadow,
and the cottage lay naked against the bosom of the forest toward
the south.</p>

<p>It was a scene from a fairy story&mdash;the tiny meadow in the
heart of the forest, with the sun on it, and the little cottage
with the blue wood smoke ascending from its chimney. Two hundred
paces from the door of the cottage the peasant woman stopped.</p>

<p>She turned about to Letington.</p>

<p>Would he promise to remain where he stood until this singing was
ended and then go to his ship? He gave the promise. Then she
repeated the former details of her magic. She took a ball&mdash;the
ball of grasses and resin&mdash;out of the bosom of her dress,
lighted and burned it. The aromatic odor appeared, extended itself.
There was silence.</p>

<p>There was not even, as it appeared, motion in the world. The
tiny thread of smoke from the aromatic grasses ascended and assumed
the fantastic shape of a flower, as it had assumed in the office
that day before him. The haze appeared. Then the woman cried out
that same harsh, shattering formula, extending her hand.</p>

<p>It seemed again to Letington to be the precise form of magic
used by those magicians in the Hebrew Scriptures who undertook to
control spirits&mdash;to call them up out of the underworld or to
materialize them out of the air&mdash;the extended arm, the crooked
fingers and the loud cry.</p>

<p>And immediately a figure appeared in the door of the cottage,
but it was not the aged figure that had appeared before him at the
first manifestation. It was a slender figure in its glorious
youth.</p>

<p>He was too far away to get details of it.</p>

<p>The face was indistinct, but the hair was golden, and the image
had the figure of a dryad. Other details the distance blurred. But
the one immense fact was youth. This woman was young, like the
daughters of faërie in the morning of the world!</p>

<p>And again that heavenly voice reached him; that wonderful,
haunting voice in its incomparable music. The man was transported
into fairyland, as through a door in the hill, beyond time, beyond
space.</p>

<p>He was in a world of wonder.</p>

<p>And the young, alluring fairy figure was singing to him. It was
to him that the voice called. It brought a message of wonder to
him; a longing to him, as though the singer had waited through an
interminable age for him to arrive; had been seeking him through
the world. Time was nothing; distance was nothing; age was
nothing!</p>

<p>These things were all illusions.</p>

<p>The reality was the longing for him; the search for him. And now
that he was found, the joy of that final ending of the search could
not be concealed.</p>

<p>It ran a subdued note through the music.</p>

<p>The man stood in some land of unending summer, of undying
youthfulness, seized with all the longings of all the lovers that
had ever lived. Here was something mysteriously synchronized,
divinely, to his own spirit.</p>

<p>Then it ceased.</p>

<p>The figure entered the cottage, the door closed, and the peasant
woman took him back, as in a dream, to the world of reality.</p>

<p>He went to his ship and to England.</p>

<p>Letington took up the old life with his sister, the Countess of
Heatherstone. He hunted that winter in the Midlands. There was not,
perhaps, a great change to be noted in the man. He was never a
voluble person. But he seemed more reticent, and perhaps more
interested in the hunt. He was out nearly every day with some
master of the hounds. He rode hard, and he was less careful either
of himself or his horse. There was little change, as I have said,
to be observed in the man. Perhaps when one knows that one has been
connected with an extraordinary event, or is under the shadow of
some mental illusion, one marks details as signboards on the way.
But if one does not have this knowledge about him, no notice will
be taken.</p>

<p>The spring came, and Letington took up polo. One day at
Roehampton, in a scrimmage, he was by accident struck on the temple
with a mallet. The injury at the time did not seem to be important.
He did not get down from the pony, and the game went on.</p>

<p>But the injury was, in fact, serious.</p>

<p>The optic nerve congested, and his sight began to fail. He went
to all the experts in England. They were all quite agreed about it.
There was an obscure injury of some character to the optic nerve.
They could do nothing. And the appalling thing about it was that
the failing sight was not confined to the eye on the side of the
temple injured. It appeared in both eyes. In plain truth, the man
was going blind.</p>

<p>And then he got a mysterious message:</p>

<p>"Come to me if you lose the sun!"</p>

<p>He did not know where the message came from nor how it happened
to arrive. He said that he was in Piccadilly Circus one afternoon
in London. He had been up to see one of the experts. He was getting
into a taxicab. There was a crowd at this point, held up by the
traffic and someone whispered the words to him.</p>

<p>He could not see who it was.</p>

<p>He was pretty blind by now. The world was passing. He got no
idea who had been near him. He was facing the door of the taxicab
at the moment. It was not certain that he could have seen the
speaker if his eyes had been all right. In the condition they were
in he did not know who had spoken to him. But he heard the message
precisely, and he knew whence it came.</p>

<p>It was the Delphic promise of the peasant woman. He knew now
what she meant by that oracular expression:</p>

<p>"You may win your way...if you should lose the sun!"</p>

<p>Well, he was on the road to losing the sun. That was one way to
put the case.</p>

<p>As this blindness went on the sun would disappear.</p>

<p>But the thing cheered him like a bugle.</p>

<p>If the way to this heavenly creature lay through the dark only,
then he was glad of the dark. He welcomed it. It was the thing he
wished above all other things, and his manner changed. He no longer
complained against his blindness.</p>

<p>He no longer cared.</p>

<p>He welcomed it!</p>

<p>The only thing that concerned him in the message was the
uncertainty of it. How could he go to her when he had no knowledge
of where she was? How could one reach a fairy creature, a dryad
singing in a sacred grove?</p>

<p>Where was the door in the hill through which one entered into
this magic country? He was on the way to lose the sun; that was
certain. That way was clear enough. But how was he to get his feet
on the other way? It was all a mystery. But he had an incredible
uplifting of the spirit. The way in the end would be made clear to
him. But did it mean that he was to go out of life? Did it mean
that to come to this heavenly creature he must go out of the world
of consciousness, of sight, of hearing? Was it the door of death
that he was called to go through? That was the only thing that
disturbed him.</p>

<p>He wished to find that heavenly creature in this life, while his
strength and his youth were with him. He was in every way strong
and in vigor, with the exception of this blindness, and he did not
care for that. He recalled what the peasant woman had said: the
agencies behind the world sold their gifts; sold them at a price.
And for a gift so excellent this price was not excessive.</p>

<p>He did not haggle about the price.</p>

<p>He was willing to pay it, glad to pay it, anxious to pay, if he
could win his way to this woman of dreams!</p>

<p>And so it came about, as I said a moment ago, that the man's
attitude toward things changed. He seemed pleased with the disaster
that was overtaking him. And this manner, the incredible events
that he had reported to the English company, and his now marked
unconcern in the face of an appalling disaster, convinced everyone
about him that he was insane; that, on the way to loss of vision,
he was also on the way to a loss of sanity.</p>

<p>They called in Sir Godfrey Simon.</p>

<p>Everybody believed Letington on the way to madness; that is to
say, everybody about him but the one person who was an authority on
that subject.</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey Simon did not believe it.</p>

<p>He knew the man was not insane. He knew it for several reasons,
complete and satisfactory in themselves. You see, there was a
series of coincidents in this thing.</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey Simon, as it happened, had a knowledge of these
events. He had a larger knowledge of them than this actor in them.
He knew the extent of them, their ramifications and whither they
led, while Letington knew only the result of them. He had a larger
knowledge of the whole business than Letington; and that, for one
reason, convinced him that the man was not insane.</p>

<p>But he said very little about it.</p>

<p>He let the whole of England go on believing what they pleased.
Still, he never misled them. When they put the pointed query at
him, he said no. But he took a profound interest in the case. He
took what one would call a fatherly interest in it. He got the
man's confidence, and he encouraged him in his attitude before the
disaster that approached.</p>

<p>It was incredible, like everything else in this incredible
story.</p>

<p>Here was a man, ordinarily a normal man, in youth, in the
strength and vigor of youth, encouraged to welcome, impatiently to
welcome, a ghastly disaster because by that sacrifice he would win
a way into some world of dreams.</p>

<p>Of course his sister, the Countess of Heatherstone, did not give
him up. She kept sending him back to the London experts. It was of
no use. The man was blind! The optic nerve was ruined. There was no
hope for him. There was nothing an expert could do. Letington did
not wish to go to London. But he was glad of the insistence that
sent him to the experts the last time. An event happened for which
he had been hoping.</p>

<p>He got another message!</p>

<p>It was in Regent Street, as he was getting down from the
Countess' motor before the door of one of the experts. Someone
spoke to him and passed on. He could not see who it was. He could
not see anything now, except the vague presence of light. He knew
when it was day and when it was dark, and that was about the extent
of it.</p>

<p>It was another Delphic message like the first one:</p>

<p>"Come to me in the land where men grind their wheat in the
sky!"</p>

<p>I want to stop here a moment until we can assemble the
essentials of the story. Get the whole thing, as one might say it,
within a sweep of the eye.</p>

<p>I have said that Sir Godfrey Simon was the deus ex machina in
this whole affair. He had not only a grasp on the whole thing but
also had the direction of it. I do not mean a direction by
accident. I mean a direction by the will&mdash;direction like a
providence. When one realizes this controlling fact, one is on the
way to an accurate conception of the whole thing.</p>

<p>The Earl of Heatherstone has a big country seat on the
Teith.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful suite in the east wing of it. Sir Godfrey
Simon was there with Letington after the event I have just related,
the arrival of that last Delphic message. It's a wonderful room: a
big sitting room, bright with chintz, looking out over a sweep of
meadow descending to the dark, rapid river, with a wood beyond.</p>

<p>Letington was profoundly disturbed.</p>

<p>Where was this land&mdash;the land where men ground their wheat
in the sky? How could he go there? It was like a line out of a
fairy story; like a message sent in an Arabian tale.</p>

<p>He began to wonder about it.</p>

<p>Was he, after all, merely the victim of an illusion? That was
the only thing that disturbed him. He was not concerned about the
night that he had entered. There was a symbolism in that. It
comforted and sustained him. When one thinks about it, there is
always the dark to be traversed before one comes into any form of
life. One arrives at a new day only by passing through the night
before it.</p>

<p>The wonderful, incredible fairy life before him lay through this
night.</p>

<p>He was not afraid of the night.</p>

<p>If he could be certain that the thing he longed for was to be
reached by traversing the night&mdash;and he had that
assurance&mdash;he didn't care for the world of reality. What was
the dark to him if he could win his way to this alluring woman! But
the fear haunted him that the land he was beckoned toward was not,
in fact, one of living man. And it was as a living man that he
wished to possess this alluring, heavenly creature. He wanted her
in life; in this life. He didn't care about sight and hearing, so
long as the living sense of feeling remained.</p>

<p>That was the whole thing.</p>

<p>The consummation of every great emotion, of every ecstasy of
emotion, after all, was in nearly every instance accomplished in
silence and in the dark. Sight and hearing added nothing to it! It
was the sense of feeling that elevated human emotions into an
ecstasy. But one had to be alive; to be a living man in the land of
the living. There was nothing to be depended on outside of the
world he knew. He wanted this woman now, alive, in this world.</p>

<p>That was the thing that brought Sir Godfrey Simon to sit with
him in the great room overlooking the Teith. And it was Sir Godfrey
Simon who gave him the key to the mystery, who read the riddle for
him:</p>

<p>"Come to me in the land where men grind their wheat in the
sky!"</p>

<p>That night Letington disappeared.</p>

<p>He disappeared wholly out of England, as though the earth had
opened and received him. No one ever know what became of him. No
one ever saw him again. He left a message, on the table, for his
sister, written large and crudely, for he couldn't see:</p>

<p>"I have gone to the land where men grind their wheat in the
sky."</p>

<p>That was all anyone, except Sir Godfrey Simon, ever knew. He
gave me a little verbal picture of what happened, as one might look
for a moment, through the crack of a door, into fairyland.</p>

<p>Letington crossed a stretch of water in the night, like Arthur
on his way to Avalon. He came to a shore beyond it. He was met by
an old peasant with a dog harnessed to a cart. He was taken with
his luggage on a road he could not see. He could not see! It was
all night to him.</p>

<p>They stopped after a while before what seemed to be an immense
metal gate. The old peasant had a good deal of trouble to open it.
It seemed to be morning and in a land of sun. The peasant led the
blind man through the gate, but remained himself outside. He told
Letington to go forward, and he did go forward on what appeared to
be a gravel path. And presently beyond him he heard the heavenly
voice that he had heard in the Canadian forest; that haunting,
alluring, mysterious voice.</p>

<p>He groped his way toward it.</p>

<p>He found the singing woman. He took her in his arms, he passed
his fingers gently over her face, her hair, her exquisite,
beautiful body. It was clear to his delicate touch that she was
young, lovely, and as perfect as a dream! He had lost the sun, but
he had come to what he longed for in the land where men grind their
wheat in the sky!</p>

<p>They disappeared among the trees, in the distance, beyond the
great metal gate. The man's arm was around the slender,
golden-haired girl, as in the morning of the world the first man
and the first woman wandered away in the Garden in Asia!</p>

<p>Go back with me to the opening of this story.</p>

<p>You know where I was; in that inn out of a page of Dumas,
conducted by a Walloon to whom I had intrusted a hunter worth a
thousand pounds sterling. I was lost, and it was raining outside.
The night had descended. I was drying my clothes before a peat
fire, and Sir Godfrey Simon was going forward with his story. He
shot now a pointed query at me:</p>

<p>"Suppose you had had that oracle to interpret. What would you
have done?"</p>

<p>"I would have given it up," I answered. "Men do not grind their
wheat in the sky, and there is no such land, except in the kingdom
of the fairies."</p>

<p>"In the Kingdom of the Belgians!" he said. "What did you pass
to-night on your way here?"</p>

<p>I told him what I had passed: meadows, ditches, an abandoned
road, and a great spiked iron fence.</p>

<p>"And what else?" he said.</p>

<p>I tried to think about it.</p>

<p>"Some peasant cottages, a village now and then, a sluggish
stream."</p>

<p>"And what else?" he said again.</p>

<p>"And a windmill," I answered, "now and then in the
distance."</p>

<p>He brought his great hand down on the table.</p>

<p>"There you have it," he cried. "Grist mills turned by the wind!
It is the land where men grind their wheat in the sky!"</p>

<p>He made a great gesture.</p>

<p>"Everywhere else in the world men grind their wheat on the
earth. But not so in the Kingdom of the Belgians."</p>

<p>A thing is a mystery because we do not understand it. It is no
mystery when we see it to the end.</p>

<p>Ten minutes of explanation cleared the thing up&mdash;cleared up
every fabulous thing in it. I thought about it as I rode back in
the morning to the château of my host, the Marquis de Brie; as I
returned along that abandoned road beside the immense fence.</p>

<p>Sir Godfrey Simon's brother, dead and buried, and leaving a
great estate, had married an Italian operatic star in Vienna. He
had one daughter with a golden voice. The girl had prepared to make
her début, and on the first night of the opera a piece of scenery
caught fire, and her face was burned. She was placed in the care of
the greatest experts, who succeeded in restoring the lovely contour
of her face and its delicate skin. But they could not remove the
horrible red discoloration that underlay the skin. It made the
girl, otherwise physically perfect, repulsive to the eye. As a last
experiment they turned to Hilderback's treatment of subjecting the
delicate flesh to extreme cold. The girl would not go to
Switzerland on account of the crowds of tourists everywhere. The
peasant woman who had been her mother's maid and companion knew of
this Italian colony in Canada and persuaded the girl to go there
for the winter. And so came this extravaganza in the Canadian
forest. All the pretended witchcraft was only clever playacting.
For example, the passenger engine was merely cut loose from the
train, run through the tunnel and switched into one of the great
bark sheds. The hemlock bark was taken down and set up again around
it. The fall of snow covered everything. The ends of the tunnel
were shot down as a blind.</p>

<p>And Sir Godfrey Simon, with the immense wealth that his brother
had bequeathed to the girl, had purchased this estate in Belgium
and cut it off from the world with its immense iron-spiked
fence.</p>

<p>He had directed events. He brought the two persons together. He
had by that direction of events turned a disaster into a heavenly
thing. Like a genie in a tale, he had transported a girl with a
horror of aspect and a man with a horror of blindness into the
Garden in Asia!</p>

<p>I thought about it in the morning sun on my way to the château
of the Marquis de Brie; as I rode southeast over fields and
ditches:</p>

<p>In the land where men grind their wheat in the sky!</p>
