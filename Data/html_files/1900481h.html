<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1">CHAPTER 1</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE Assistant Commissioner of New Scotland Yard
listened for a moment at one of his telephones, told the man at
the other end, it happened to be Superintendent Maybrick of
Hampstead, to hold on a moment, and sent one of his constable-clerks in search of Chief Inspector Pointer.</p>

<p>It was then just a little before nine of a Tuesday morning. A
tall, lithe, lean young man came in with a step that suggested
the kilt and the springing heather.</p>

<p>"Look here, Pointer. Suppose you hand over the reins of that
case you're on to Clark. He can carry on all right now.
Superintendent Maybrick of Hampstead wants help. Or rather, I
think he needs it. He's just been called in to a horrid mess, a
murder, in one of the flats in his district. From certain things
he thinks it's an anarchist plot gone wrong, 'biter bit' sort of
thing," Major Pelham said vaguely; "he's got into touch with the
Foreign Office already. So by this time there's sure to be some
F.O. man sprinting along to have a first look. Go and see what
you think of it, will you? If it isn't a foreign spy job, then it
should be a fine problem for you to solve. Here's the address."
He handed a chit to the Chief Inspector, who left the room with
his swift, unhurried stride that covered such an amazing amount
of ground.</p>

<p>Pointer drove to the place mentioned&mdash;a large block of
flats with a view over Hampstead Heath.</p>

<p>The head porter, after a keen glance at the Chief Inspector
when the latter asked for "Mr. Maybrick," saluted, and took him
up in the lift. The only information which he volunteered was
that none of the residents had an idea of what had happened.</p>

<p>"These are all service flats, sir, and news gets around
terrible fast unless one's very careful. As a rule illnesses are
'maternity cases' when possible. Deaths are 'measles,' to account
for the body being took away, but murder&mdash;the owners haven't
given instructions about that. Not yet." The porter stopped the
lift at the third floor, and stepped forward to ring the bell of
a flat marked fourteen, which had no card in the little glass
case beside the door. Pointer stopped him.</p>

<p>"A moment!" His eye ran over the door and mat and landing, as
well as up and down the staircases. Then he nodded. The porter
rang. The door opened an inch. The Superintendent inside, in
plain clothes too, inspected them both cautiously, then he stood
back and Pointer entered.</p>

<p>Maybrick saluted. He was one of Pointer's many policeman
admirers. What a pity, he thought, that there was nothing here
for the Chief Inspector to get his teeth into, those teeth that
never let go.</p>

<p>"A moment!" Pointer said again, as he switched on the light
and gave one swift glance around the square hall, a glance that
nothing visible escaped. Then he nodded.</p>

<p>"Now lead the way."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you first what I know, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not if any one from the Foreign Office is on the trail,"
Pointer said promptly. "They're quick workers. And I like to have
my clues untouched, as far as may be."</p>

<p>"No one's come yet, sir. Not even the doctor. And the clues
aren't ones that can be disarranged." Maybrick was about to
expand into detail, but Pointer stopped him.</p>

<p>"Then this way, sir." Maybrick led down to a door at the
farther end of a little passage. Pointer stepped into a tiled
bathroom. In the bath-tub&mdash;it was not a pleasant
sight&mdash;lay a man's body, stripped and headless.</p>

<p>"Where's his head?"</p>

<p>"Not on the premises, sir. Gone. Like his clothes. All
gone."</p>

<p>Pointer knelt down in the doorway and looked sideways across
the floor.</p>

<p>"Rubber-soled shoes. Man's heel marks. Apparently only one
pair. What's that?" He advanced now, and bent to a tiny splash of
something white on the tiles under the raised china bath.</p>

<p>"Powder they use to clean the tub, sir. Shall I tell you what
the head porter&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again Pointer stopped him.</p>

<p>"Has the body been touched by any one, as far as you
know?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Not the kind of thing to get touched by any sensible
man."</p>

<p>"Have you photographed it?"</p>

<p>"Films are being developed at the station now."</p>

<p>Pointer lifted each of the hands in turn.</p>

<p>They were slender, beautiful hands, that looked as though they
would be clever at whatever they did. Hard work had never been
asked of them.</p>

<p>"Wore a ring on the middle finger of the right hand. Broad,
thick ring. Signet ring very likely. Cigarette smoker. Gentleman
certainly from the care of the whole body."</p>

<p>There were no marks of blood-stained hands either on the bath,
or on the fitted basin beside it, or on any of the taps, nor
finger prints of any kind.</p>

<p>Pointer stepped on into a bedroom opening out of the bath-room. Then he returned to Maybrick.</p>

<p>"We can wash our hands in the bedroom. The basin in there's
not even been dusted. This one has been used."</p>

<p>A ring came at the door. Maybrick answered it. A small, quick-stepping, alert-eyed, gray-bearded man stepped into the flat. He
was of the type to pass easily for English in England, French in
France, Spanish, or Eastern, according to where he was met.
"Many-tongued Tindall," a great international sleuth or sleuther
of sleuths, was an amateur. A man of means attached to the
Foreign Office, when he was not on loan to the Home Office. In
manner he was very quiet, in speech very direct.</p>

<p>"I've come to see if the dead man's one of our birds," he
said, after shaking hands with Pointer. "But you here?" He eyed
the Chief Inspector with mock distrust. "No poaching, you
know!"</p>

<p>For a second Tindall too stood looking about him with swift,
piercing glances.</p>

<p>"Now for the story"&mdash;he turned to the Superintendent.
First eyes, then ears, was Pointer's way. But Tindall was as high
in his branch as Pointer was in the C.I.D., and was, moreover, a
much older man. So Maybrick led them into the drawing-room, where
the dust lay thick, and where the blinds still shut out the
daylight.</p>

<p>The story, as known to Maybrick, was exceedingly simple. The
flat belonged to a Mr. Marshall, a senior clerk at Lloyds who, as
usual, wished to let it furnished while he was away on a four
weeks' holiday. He had left last Thursday. On Friday, about six,
a man had presented himself to the head porter with a view card
from the house agents, which gave his name as a Monsieur
Tourcoin. The flat was shown him, and a little later the head
porter was informed over the telephone by the agents that Mr.
Tourcoin had taken the flat for a friend, a Captain Brown.
Captain Brown would "take possession" on Tuesday or
Wednesday.</p>

<p>On Monday evening something went wrong with the lock of an
upstairs flat. The porter thought it a good opportunity, when the
locksmith arrived this morning, to have him run his eye over the
front door of Number Fourteen as well. Mr. Marshall had
complained of its not always catching properly when hastily shut.
He also remembered a difficulty with Marshall's bathroom bolt,
and took the man in there first. He had his own pass-key, of
course.</p>

<p>"They didn't stay to look at any bolts," Maybrick said dryly.
"Nasty sight that body in there. They rushed to the telephone and
called us in."</p>

<p>"What body in where?" Tindall asked impatiently. He was taken
to see it. His face paled as he looked carefully at it and at the
room.</p>

<p>"Horrible!" he muttered. "Horrible!"</p>

<p>He turned to Maybrick.</p>

<p>"What made you 'phone to us&mdash;made you think the crime
political?"</p>

<p>"This, sir." Maybrick passed into a sitting-room, which, like
the bedroom, opened out of the bathroom. He pointed to a
newspaper on the table. It was a <i>Times</i> of Friday, heavily
scored at a few passages. Maybrick pointed to these. Tindall read
aloud <i>"Anti-royalist plot suspected in Madrid</i>. I see he's
underscored that <i>'suspected</i>.' What's this next? <i>King
Alfonso's yacht Esmeralda to be ready by a certain date</i>. A
question mark is pencilled beside the date. Indeed! Indeed! And
here's something about King Boris's coming trip to Sofia heavily
marked at the side. Except for that last, the items are only
Spanish..." Tindall perched on a chair in a way that suggested
flight rather than rest.</p>

<p>"Man's clothes missing...Papers in them gone too, of
course...Head taken away...Identity to be concealed,
or&mdash;Anything else made you think the murder political beyond
the marked paper, Superintendent?"</p>

<p>"These." Maybrick lifted up the waste-paper basket. "I screwed
them up as nearly as possible as I found them. They're funny
reading together with those bits in the paper and that dead
body!"</p>

<p>In the basket lay what looked like two crinkly <i>eggs</i>.
They were wads of paper that had been crushed into little balls.
Opened out, they showed as two sheets of plain letter-paper,
headed with the address of the flat. On each were some lines of
writing in a pointed, very sloping, foreign hand. The first
ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">You have betrayed the change in the crew of the
"Esmeralda." But I give you one chance to explain. Come here to-night and clear yourself if you can. If not&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p>The rest of the sheet was blank. Apparently this draft had not
pleased the writer. It had been screwed up and tossed away. The
second was a complete note. It ran:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">You are a traitor, but I give you one more
chance to explain why you have not carried out the orders I gave
you at "Iguski Aidé." Take it. Or it will be the end. Come to
this address tonight. If you do not come you know the penalty.
Expect it without mercy."</p>

<br>

<p>The last two sentences had been scratched out. There was no
signature, but a little drawing of the outline of a house with a
V inside.</p>

<p>"That scratched out bit about the penalty is why he copied out
the note and threw this away," Maybrick explained like a
showman.</p>

<p>Tindall's eyes were shining. He stroked his beard with a hand
that quivered a little.</p>

<p>"These settle it." He spoke calmly but with the calm of one
who forces a layer of composure over a seething mass of red-hot
feeling.</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> a political crime! Or an act of justice, if you
will."</p>

<p>"You know what that signature stands for?" The Chief
Inspector's tone made the remark a statement, not a question.</p>

<p>"The V within the outline of a house? Etcheverrey, Pointer.
Yes. Etcheverrey, the great anarchist. Or rather anti-royalist
agitator."</p>

<p>Pointer said nothing. Maybrick gave a cluck of delighted
amazement. The police of every country knew, and were on the hunt
for that name, that man.</p>

<p>"That's his secret signature," Tindall went on. "Only used to
his own men. Only known to us at the F.O. And <i>Iguski
Aide!</i>&mdash;'Sunny Corner'! That's Etcheverrey's well-hidden
Basque refuge, deep in the heart of some Pyrenees ravine, not yet
located. The mere name is only known to a chosen and picked few
among his followers. We at the F.O. have only just&mdash;only
<i>just</i> learnt it."</p>

<p>"He's French, isn't he?" Maybrick asked.</p>

<p>"Officially, yes. But there's not a drop of French blood in
his veins. Basque father. Catalan mother. Speaks all languages.
Brains of the devil. And up till now his luck."</p>

<p>"Do you think Etcheverrey's the killer, or the killed here,
sir?" Maybrick asked again.</p>

<p>"The killed. The dead man," Tindall said, after a moment's
deep thought. "Etcheverrey would have taken those scraps of paper
away. His slayer is not identified by them. I think that the
tables were turned on the Basque for the&mdash;first and
last&mdash;time in his life, by the man he summoned here. And I
can make a good guess at that man's name. You know my slogan." He
turned to Pointer. "What the brain can't see, the eyes can't
either. Eyes won't solve this problem. Not even yours. Now what
has cost Etcheverrey his head, literally is, I think, his last
break."</p>

<p>"His attempt on the Shah of Persia?" Maybrick knew every one
of Etcheverrey's unsuccessful efforts by heart. "Pretty near
thing for the Shah!"</p>

<p>"And for Etcheverrey," Tindall threw in grimly. "He was all
but caught. As it was, they got a good view of him. The only time
he's been really seen. And since then there's a fine price on his
head at Ispahan. On the real, solid head. Duly delivered. That's
why the descriptions we get from there are so vague. All we know
of his appearance is that he has unusually small feet, and really
beautiful hands."</p>

<p>"First thing I noticed about the corpse." Maybrick was sorting
his notes. "Here it is. Par seven."</p>

<p>"Yes," Tindall was talking half under his breath, "Mirza Khan
is over here, we know. He's the Shah's secret agent. It's his
head or Etcheverrey's, I understand. We know that Etcheverrey is
in London again. Sir Edward Clifford rather inclines to the
belief that he's been here for years, carefully hidden in some
commonplace identity, and that he only leaves London for some
swift flight and one of his lightning efforts, and then comes
back again and takes up his seemingly everyday existence. I don't
agree with him, but that's Sir Edward's view."</p>

<p>Sir Edward Clifford was Permanent Under Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>"Every man jack of us has been living on a volcano, with the
King of Spain on his way here next month." Maybrick drew a deep
breath.</p>

<p>"Etcheverrey nearly got him in Spain last year," Tindall went
on, "just as he had a hard try for our Prince of Wales in South
America." He was examining the room carefully as he talked. There
was little to discover. A smallish, still damp splotch of blood
on the thick carpet near a little table on which stood a reading-lamp. A few drops of blood had dried on the wooden edge of the
table. Smaller ones yet were found on the parchment lamp-shade,
and a hint of a trickle down one leg of the arm-chair standing
near.</p>

<p>"There's been no struggle?" Tindall looked at Pointer.</p>

<p>"No sign of any," Pointer said cautiously.</p>

<p>"Just so. Yet the man summoned by such a letter as that would
have been on the alert and would have struggled. Etcheverrey, on
the other hand, would not dream that the tables could be turned
on him. He was either shot, or more probably slogged on the head.
Dragged to the tub, beheaded, and the head's now on its way to
distant Ispahan in the care of that good old hater, Mirza Khan.
But all that's for me to find out."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," Maybrick slipped a band over his bulging note-book, "as you're quite sure that the murder was political, I hand
it over to you."</p>

<p>The Superintendent was aware that he had done very well. But
he knew when he was out of his depth. Nor had he any intention of
wasting his time over a case of which the honours would all go to
the Foreign Office. They had their own men. It was all very well
for the Chief Inspector, who had already, young though he was,
risen so high, but he, Maybrick, had more paying matters from the
point of view of promotion waiting for him at his police station.
And so with a salute, he passed from the scene&mdash;to his never
dying regret.</p>

<p>"Now for the porters," Tindall continued, when the two were
alone. They learnt nothing which could explain the crime itself
from them, though they gained a clear idea of how the flat could
have been entered and left by any one unobserved. The building
had several lifts, the corner ones being automatic and worked by
the residents. There were many staircases. There was a restaurant
on the ground floor open to the public. There were billiard rooms
and reading rooms.</p>

<p>The estate agent, for whom they telephoned, repeated in fuller
detail what Maybrick had already told them about the taking of
the flat. Monsieur Tourcoin had paid for the four weeks in
twenty-four one-pound notes, and the transaction had been
completed on the spot.</p>

<p>"No references asked for?"</p>

<p>"Not in a case of this kind. A furnished flat let for a month.
The porters here keep their eyes open. And undesirable people
would be asked to leave at once. We find that simpler and better
than bothering with references," the house-agent explained.</p>

<p>"Now as to this Mr. Marshall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We know all about Mr. Marshall. Our firm has known him and
his parents, they lived in one of our houses, for twenty years.
Just as we've known the head porter here about that long. There's
nothing wrong with Mr. Marshall, I'll go bail, any more than
there is with Soulyby, the head porter."</p>

<p>"How did this Mr. Tourcoin learn of the flat?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"Saw our advertisement in the paper, I suppose."</p>

<p>"When was it advertised?"</p>

<p>"Friday morning for the first time."</p>

<p>"And the paper?"</p>

<p>"<i>The Times</i>."</p>

<p>"And he spoke broken English," Tindall murmured.</p>

<p>The agent laughed. "Rather!" He gave them a very good copy of
the man's accent.</p>

<p>"On leaving, he nipped into a taxi which some one was just
paying off, and called to the chauffeur. 'To the station at
Charing Cross. Arrest yourself there for one little minute while
I learn what time train for Paris he start.' The driver winked,
and said he'd arrest himself all right if need be."</p>

<p>"What clothes was the man wearing?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Motor cap&mdash;he apologised very civilly for keeping it on,
but he had a bad attack of head neuralgia&mdash;big brown and
orange check motoring coat. That's all I remember."</p>

<p>"Young man?"</p>

<p>The agent thought so, but as he had seen many men yesterday
afternoon he could not be quite sure. The whole affair was so
small compared with most of their business that he had not paid
much attention.</p>

<p>"Do you remember his hands, when he signed those papers,"
Pointer went on, "were they large hands?"</p>

<p>The estate agent could not remember anything about them. More
details of the conversation were asked, and as far as possible,
given. Then the agent took his leave&mdash;a very agitated
leave.</p>

<p>The head porter had not noticed the appearance of the M.
Tourcoin to whom he had shown the flat, except that the man wore
a motoring ulster of orange and brown tweed, and a brown silk
scarf. He had an impression of a young man, but as he had already
on Friday afternoon shown the flat to several friends of Mr.
Marshall's, he could not even be sure of that.</p>

<p>The man had barely glanced over the flat.</p>

<p>"I never thought he meant what he said about taking it, but
within half an hour the agents phoned up to me that the flat was
gone. Taken by the monseer for a month. As to seeing him
again&mdash; not unless that's him in there. But the chap I
showed the flat to, looked a bigger chap. Bigger and brawnier,
though I never saw his face. Not to <i>see</i> it."</p>

<p>"Was he smoking?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Briarwood pipe. One of these new comfort pipes?</p>

<p>"What kind of tobacco? Any kind you knew?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." It was a kind that the head porter particularly
liked when he could afford it. A well-known British make. "I says
to myself," the man went on, "France is all very well for wines,
but when it comes to pipes and baccy&mdash;there's nothing like
Us!"</p>

<p>"Umph," Tindall murmured, when the two were alone. "Tourcoin
takes the flat for a Captain Brown. He or this captain Brown can
be seen in it therefore. If need be. One of the two is
Etcheverrey. Almost certainly he would be Brown. The Unseen. Now
is Tourcoin the man to whom the summoning letters were sent? Is
he the man who killed Etcheverrey? Is he, in fact, Mirza Khan,
who speaks French&mdash;and English too for that
matter&mdash;like a Frenchman?" There was a short silence broken
by the Chief Inspector, who had been standing looking down at the
toes of his shoes, hands loosely clasped behind him. He looked up
now.</p>

<p>"Those papers found in the basket"&mdash;he spoke
thoughtfully&mdash; "are they in Etcheverrey's writing?"</p>

<p>"He had some thirty different kinds of writing."</p>

<p>"And on the blotter," Pointer went on musingly, "there are no
marks except from the two notes we found torn up..."</p>

<p>"None. Why should there be?" Tindall asked, with a faint
smile. "You police always want so much for your money."</p>

<p>There was another pause. Tindall eyed Pointer whimsically.
Pointer looked back at him with his tranquil, steady gaze. The
detective officer had fine dark gray eyes, pleasant, though at
times rather enigmatic in expression.</p>

<p>"To stake the effect of a political crime would be a capital
red herring, wouldn't it, to drag across the trail of a private
murder."</p>

<p>Tindall smiled still more. A smile of real amusement at this
doubt on his own reading of the case from a man young enough to
be his son.</p>

<p>"We're like two Harley Street specialists, Pointer," he said
good-humouredly, "each reading a case according to his own
special lines. I say heart. You say liver. You're welcome to
treat the case for liver, of course. But it's a heart case.
Believe me, it's heart. In other words, I've been studying
Etcheverrey so long that I have no hesitation in saying that this
murder belongs to me. Don't waste your valuable time in hunting
for this poor chap's head. I see that search being organised
already."</p>

<p>Pointer laughed a little. Tindall was right. He was already
charting his course.</p>

<p>"It's on its way to distant Ispahan," Tindall continued. "Pity
Mirza Khan has such a start. Well, he knows my methods. They're
lazy, compared with yours, but they're quick."</p>

<p>"They often lead to splendid results," Pointer said honestly.
In what might be called society crimes, thefts, stolen letters,
the finer shade of blackmail, Tindall had done wonders, besides
winning many a triumph in his own field&mdash;the political
field.</p>

<p>"I leave the details of the flat to you." Tindall despised
hunting for clues. "The exact spot where the murder was
committed...which way the man faced...and so on."</p>

<p>Pointer nodded, let him out of the flat, telephoned to
Scotland Yard for their expert locksmith, and then rang for the
head porter. That worthy was asked to institute a sort of house-clearing. Fortunately he was at one with the Scotland Yard
officer in wanting to make sure that the missing head was not
hidden somewhere on any premises for which he was
responsible.</p>

<p>"I'll see to my part of it. Every nook shall be turned out.
Every cupboard moved, or I'll know the reason why," Soulyby
promised, "and every parcel opened."</p>

<p>"As soon as the doctor has examined the body we shall have a
rough idea of about what time the murder was committed. As it is,
we know that it must have taken place between seven on Friday
evening, and eight this morning. Ask cautiously about whether any
one was seen coming into, or going out of, this flat during that
time."</p>

<p>Pointer dismissed him and telephoned to Lloyds. Marshall had
been with them for fifteen years, he learnt. Came straight from
London University. His present address was Bastia in Corsica. But
as he had spoken of mules and guides...Yes, the man answering the
telephone was a friend of his and quite willing to act as his
reference if necessary. The firm would act as another. But he
believed the flat was taken. The inquiry was about Marshall's
furnished flat, of course?</p>

<p>"Just so," Pointer murmured, as he turned away. "Of
course!"</p>

<p>He now began his own patient investigations. The bathtubs, he
had learnt, were cleaned with Sapolio. The little smear of white
under this one seemed to him to be plaster. He scraped it into a
stoppered bottle and labelled it before putting it into his
attaché case. Then he bent over some mark on the tiled
floor&mdash; marks such as a dull lead pencil might make if it
had been rubbed with a broad, circular motion over the spot.
Pointer decided that a tin had been placed there, and been
pressed hard down while it was moved round and round.</p>

<p>Then he turned his attention to the fitted basin beside the
bath. The taps had been turned off and on with a towel, he
thought. Unfortunately the hall porter could not say, nor could
the housekeeper, how many towels had been left in a warm cupboard
just by the basin. Pointer looked about him for a pail. But
failing that, he took a bronze jar from the living-room and set
it beneath the basin. With a spanner he unscrewed the trap in the
outflow pipe, and let the contents run into his receptacle. A
thickish, reddish mixture came out. Ammonia told him that the
reddish colour was blood, the whitish part he took to be more
plaster. It looked to him as though the murderer or murderers had
washed their hands here. He bottled some of this mixture too, and
turned away after replacing the fixture. He started on the
bedroom. Here he found nothing except proofs that the room had
not been used last night. He passed on to the sitting-room. At
that moment the doctor arrived.</p>

<p>"Going to have your work cut out this time, Chief Inspector,"
he grunted. "Even you must be up a tree with this body."</p>

<p>"Any help to give me?"</p>

<p>"The man was probably about forty. Good condition. Nails show
he's had no operations, is no victim of any chronic disease. A
gentleman, I take it."</p>

<p>"And the head was severed?"</p>

<p>"With two or three hard, downward blows." He gave some medical
details. "As to whether the man was dead or alive
first&mdash;can't be sure till I've examined the lungs, but
probably dead."</p>

<p>"Had the man who cut off the head any knowledge of
anatomy?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. A sixteenth of an inch lower would have made
the job half as easy again. Tremendous violence was used. Must
have been a strong chap, and used something on which he got a
good purchase which had a very firm edge."</p>

<p>"How long would it have taken do you think?"</p>

<p>"To cut off the head?" The doctor meditated. "About fifteen
minutes, I should say."</p>

<p>"And the death occurred, at a rough guess?"</p>

<p>"Some time last night, I should judge. That cut's about twelve
hours old. Certainly not more."</p>

<p>He left at that, and Pointer went on with his work. There were
no signs of any bullet having entered a wall or piece of
furniture. Nor did the man seem to have been shot in a line with
any of the windows, supposing him to have been shot&mdash;as
Pointer did, partly from the size of the blood stain, chiefly
from the fact that the chair down which a rivulet of blood had
run was the only one in the room that had a very high, spreading
back. It was the last kind of a chair to choose had a blow been
intended.</p>

<p>Feeling the carpet, going by the stain, Pointer replaced the
chair as it had probably stood. The bedroom door was to one side
and a little behind it&mdash;an ideal position for a shot. This
bedroom door had odd pin-marks in the wood near the handle, two
on one side, two on the other, about the same distance apart.</p>

<p>Pointer finally decided that a strip of some thin but strong
material such as tape had been fastened with drawing pins taut
across the tongue, so as to prevent the rather noisy latch from
acting, and let the door be opened by a touch, though it might
look closed.</p>

<p>He drew the curtains and switched on the lights. The side of
the door that interested him was then thrown into deep shadow by
a Chinese lacquer cabinet. So that, provided that the strip had
been white, for the door was white, it might pass undetected by a
casual glance, or by a short-sighted person. Pointer thought this
last idea very probable. It explained the otherwise venturesome
silencing of the door, it was borne out by the position of the
reading-lamp that had been drawn to the extreme edge of the
little table, and close against the left side of the chair.</p>

<p>Pointer stared at the pin marks. To him they were a very odd
detail, one that was quite out of keeping with the rest of the
crime as known so far. Primarily they showed that the man who had
been murdered was evidently not hard of hearing, since they
spelled care that no snap of the catch could be heard. But they
meant more than that. Those pin-pricks meant a quick job. Just as
they showed that probably there had been no sounds&mdash;music,
talk&mdash; during which the cautious opening of the door could
pass unnoticed. It looked as though the victim had been alone.
But alone or not, Etcheverrey must be always on the alert, ever
suspicious. A man wanted by the police of all the world, a man
with a price on his head, a man who had never yet been caught,
would not have let any door pass uninvestigated, let alone one
that stood half in shadow. Incongruous in any case, the tape
seemed to Pointer doubly so in connection with the much sought-for, wily Basque.</p>

<p>It came to this, he thought, if Etcheverrey had been the man
in the flat, he could have taken sufficient time to silence that
door in some better way than by means of a hastily fastened-on
strip. If the man was not Etcheverrey, then the anarchist would
have noticed it.</p>

<p>A search found a bath mat in a hall cupboard. Where,
apparently, a loop of tape had been sewn on, now only an end
dangled; a roughly cut-off end, cut with a knife, not scissors.
The piece that remained was the width indicated by tie pin
pricks. So the murderer had not come provided with tape. He found
a few drawing-pins in a drawer which left just such marks as
those on the door. Pointer again tested each object in the room.
But still only the carpet, the chair, the table edge, and the
lamp-shade showed marks of blood. On none of these, moreover, had
there been any effort to clean away the marks. As for the
crumpled papers in the waste-paper basket, of which, each
promising the other a photographic copy, Tindall had kept one,
and Pointer one, the Chief Inspector found a few more sheets in a
drawer. It looked as though they had been left there by Marshall.
The writing had been done with a pointed fountain pen, which,
like the ink&mdash;Pointer intended to have the latter tested at
the Yard&mdash;seemed of quite an ordinary kind.</p>

<p>The lock expert arrived from the Yard at this point. A close
scrutiny of the Yale lock now taken off the front door told him
that though it was old and badly in need of new
springs&mdash;failing entirely to catch now and then&mdash;yet it
had not been forced, or picked, or opened with any other but its
own rightful key. The house agent had said that he had handed
Marshall's two keys to Monsieur Tourcoin.</p>

<p>The ambulance arrived and the body was taken away. Pointer
went back to the bath and scrutinised the bottom. With what had
those two deep gashes been made? The flat had no kitchen. No
suitable knife or weapon hung on any of its walls.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>

<p class="first">POINTER strolled down all the stairs and let
himself up and down in all the lifts. Finally he stopped beside a
couple of workmen who were doing some plastering on the ground
floor, near the foot of the stairs that led up to Number
Fourteen. He had noticed the bags and the tools when he arrived
just now.</p>

<p>"I borrowed some of your plaster last night," he said
pleasantly, "how much do I owe you for what I used?"</p>

<p>"That's all right, sir," one of the men said civilly, "me and
my mate was just saying that one of the porters must have done
it. Quarter of a bag, wasn't it, sir. If you like to call it a
shilling, that'll be all right."</p>

<p>Pointer liked a half-crown better, and so apparently did the
men.</p>

<p>"Hope I cleaned the spade off all right," Pointer chatted on,
lighting a cigarette. A cigarette which he took care not to
inhale.</p>

<p>"Lord, sir, there wasn't no call to clean it that-away!
Staggered Jim here it did to see it cleaned up. We only uses it
for mixin'. Why, you sharpened the thing, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"No. Not beyond cleaning it." Pointer's cigarette was in his
hand. He flicked its ash over the handle and stood looking down
at it while talking. The ash, "finger-print cigarette" ash,
showed no marks except those of a gloved hand. The workmen not
touched it. So some one had scraped it and cleaned it since they
had used it last.</p>

<p>And, according to the men, some one had sharpened it as well.
It certainly was quite sharp enough now to have done what Pointer
believed it had done. A couple of blows from it would account for
the marks on the bottom of the tub. The murderer must have found
his grisly task lightened unexpectedly by the implements left in
the building. Or had "Tourcoin" noticed them, and laid his plan
accordingly?</p>

<p>"I think I put everything back as it was," he said again;
"messy work, plastering. When you aren't used to it. Miss
anything else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir."</p>

<p>But Pointer seemed still uncertain.</p>

<p>"Let me see...didn't I take a tin?" He was thinking of the
marks on the bathroom tiles.</p>

<p>"That old tin isn't no loss, sir. You're more than welcome to
it. We found it on the dust-bin, and was going to throw it out
again when we was finished."</p>

<p>"Still," Pointer reminded them, "a tin comes in handy, I
expect. What size is it? I borrowed another from one of the
porters."</p>

<p>"Seven pound biscuit tin, sir. Stove in a bit at one side. It
comes in handy for plaster we've sieved and don't want to use
immediate, as you say, sir. But there's no hurry!"</p>

<p>"I'll send it down. Did I take its lid too?" he asked, peering
about him.</p>

<p>He was told that he must have, as the lid was kept on the
box.</p>

<p>Pointer tipped them, "in case the tin shouldn't turn up," and
went slowly out of the building, an hour after he had first
entered it.</p>

<p>If Tindall was right, and the body found was that of
Etcheverrey, then, as far as he was concerned, the case was over.
Some Special Branch man at the Yard would be told off to assist
the Foreign Office, and Pointer would take up another tangle. But
was it Etcheverrey? Was it "political" at all?</p>

<p>Very great care had been taken to dispose of all personal
effects. Nothing but those scraps of paper in the basket had been
left to tell who the man was. And, supposing the scraps of paper
to have been faked, then no clue whatever had been left. For the
flat was a furnished flat, shedding no light on the character of
its present occupier. As far as identity went, if the papers in
the basket were what the Force calls "offers," a trail laid to
deceive, then it was as if the police had found a body stripped,
and without a head, lying in an empty room.</p>

<p>Each great case, and Pointer nowadays was concerned only with
great cases, groups its facts in such a different way from any
other, that it becomes an entirely new problem. Pointer had never
had one like this before, where all the usual means of
identification of murdered man and missile used had been taken
away. Of course Tindall might be right. Probably he was. But
supposing he were not, how the dickens was he, Pointer, to find
out who the man had been? And above all, who the murderer had
been? Somewhere there was a weak spot in the crime. There always
was. There always would be. Where was it in this case?</p>

<p>The detective officer's every nerve tautened at the idea of a
murderer escaping. Pointer never saw his work as a game of brains
against brains, where, provided only that the one move was
cleverer than the other, it ought to win. He was a soldier,
fighting a ceaseless battle where no quarter could be asked or
given. The battle of light against darkness. Right against Wrong.
If the other side won, it would be all up with the world. Pointer
had never failed the side of justice yet. He would not fail it
now, if he could help it.</p>

<p>But could he help it? Tindall was working at the case from his
end. Pointer was not sure that he wanted to follow the other's
track. He must make his own path therefore. If Tindall were
right, the Chief Inspector's road and that of the F.O. man would
meet in due course, the two ends of a well-dug tunnel.</p>

<p>He went up to his rooms at Scotland Yard and did some
telephoning. By that time the analyst's report, on the bottles
which had been sent in, was ready. One contained nothing but
plaster mixed with water. The plaster was a very coarse kind used
by plumbers for certain face-work. The other contained the same
plaster, some water, and a mixture of blood.</p>

<p>Pointer walked up and down his room. He was not the Chief
Inspector now, but a man who had committed a murder; a man to
whom it was absolutely vital that the corpse should not be
recognised, or that the weapon used should not be identified.
Pointer had an open mind as to which of the two reasons compelled
the taking away of the head. The clothes might have been taken
for the purpose of confusing the issue.</p>

<p>"Yes," he murmured to himself, "I've put the head in a biscuit
tin, mixed and poured in plaster to keep it from rolling around,
and now what?"</p>

<p>In the absence of all known hiding-places, he finally, after a
short chat over the wire with the Home Office, sent a coded
message to every post office throughout the United Kingdom that
all wrongly-addressed or uncalled-for parcels were to be reported
to him at once. He thought it very possible that the murdered
man's clothes, and the towels used by his murderer, had been made
into small, convenient parcels, and sent to various fictitious
names and non-existent streets in some home-town. Abroad would be
out of the question.</p>

<p>All omnibus headquarters, taxi stands, garages, and railway
stations were warned to keep an eye out for similar but unmarked
parcels which either had been left in vehicles some time last
night or might be left in the near future.</p>

<p>Similar instructions reached the L.C.C. dustmen and all parcel
deposit offices. The river police were not forgotten. They had
found nothing so far which could interest Pointer, but they
promised to be even more on the alert than usual, if possible.
Then he telephoned to the police surgeon who had first seen the
body. He learnt that nothing had been found to explain the cause
of death. There were no signs of a struggle. Death had been
absolutely instantaneous. The doctor thought that a bullet
through the head would account for the facts. "But, of course, as
Mr. Tindall suggests, a blow might be equally swift." At any
rate, the head had been certainly severed after death. But not
long after it. The death itself had taken place somewhere around
midnight on Monday night. Pointer put down the telephone and went
to the mortuary chapel, a grimly sanitary place.</p>

<p>The finger prints had already been taken, and definitely
<i>not</i> identified at Scotland Yard, as those of any known
criminal.</p>

<p>Flashed by wireless photographs to the continent, the same
answer had come from each capital in turn. So the body was still
nameless. And as long as it remained so, the murderer was
safe.</p>

<p>Pointer looked the body over very carefully yet once again.
Especially the beautifully shaped hands. Hands that in life must
surely have done many things well. In whose life? What things had
they done?</p>

<p>As he studied them, he remembered their quick examination by
the doctor. He knew that on the arrival of an unconscious patient
at any hospital, the medical men run their eyes over the nails
for any trace of recent operations, illnesses, chronic
complaints, or even nerve shocks. Pointer, calling in a constable
to help him, scraped the inside of each well-kept nail with his
penknife on to a small glass slide. Having carefully covered and
marked each slide, he took them back with him to the Yard. There
the slides were examined. The result was handed to him almost
immediately.</p>

<p>Both hands showed fluff of white paper made from esparto grass
of a kind that is usually only sold for very superior typewriting
purposes. One nail had lightly scraped a sheet of carbon paper.
One&mdash;the first of the right hand&mdash;showed traces of
sugar.</p>

<p>In other words, the dead man was almost certainly a writer, or
a typist. But probably a writer who was only in occasional
contact with sheets of carbon paper. He might be a secretary. He
might be a clerk. But the nails of the feet showed that he had
last worn black socks of a most expensive silk. That suggested
not a clerk. The sugar on the right hand suggested an
investigating finger among lumps in the sugar bowl, which in its
turn suggested the free and easy ways of a man's own home.
Probably his after-dinner coffee. No china had been used in the
flat where the body was found. No sugar-basin filled there. The
complete picture as filled in by the police surgeon's and the
analyst's reports and Pointer's own reading of the room in which
he believed the murder to have taken place, was that of a well-to-do author, possibly a journalist, one used to sudden alarms,
who, after his dinner at home, had gone out unsuspectingly to
meet his terrible death. A writer of about forty years of age, in
good health and circumstances. Not blind, for he had probably
drawn that reading lamp towards him, but very likely short-sighted, for he had drawn it close. Not deaf, as the muffled door
showed.</p>

<p>Pointer took a turn around his room. It was a step forward.
But it looked like being the last step for the moment.
Unless&mdash; Pointer stared at his shoe-tips. Then he went back
to the mortuary chapel.</p>

<p>There was a tiny scar on the sole of one foot, such as might
clinch an identification but not suggest one. He studied it
afresh. No, that would not help him. There was nothing peculiar
about that tiny mark. Again he picked up the hands, looked at the
uncalloused palms. The man was no sportsman. Not a hard spot
anywhere. Surely there was more to be learned. But how? The hands
were the only chance. The only possible chance...</p>

<p>The lines on the palms were singularly clear, and not at all
like his own. Apart from palmistry in the sense of prophecy, of
charlatanry, some people claimed that you could tell a person's
character, even their profession, from the lines in their
hands.</p>

<p>Pointer thought of Astra. The police knew all about her.</p>

<p>Astra was the professional name of an American, a Mrs. Jansen,
who had amazed London by her skill in reading the character of
men and women from their hands. She was no teller of fortunes.
But she did tell what lay dormant, or wrongly applied. Parents
brought her their children in large numbers, and Astra would
examine the little palms, and then give the parents a very
truthful, sometimes appallingly truthful, list of their drawbacks
and their talents. She would proceed to point out that this must
be encouraged, that repressed. In what the child should succeed,
in what he was bound to fail. With elder people she was as
forthright. "Your gifts are these&mdash;your bad qualities this
and that." Astra was amazingly honest, and amazingly right. She
was no pessimist. "Change your life, use your gifts, keep under
the evil in you, and the lines will surely change," was her
sermon. "Each of us is our own enemy. Fight that enemy." And she
would give clear particulars as to where and how that fight
should begin.</p>

<p>The two police inspectors who had been sent to test her, for
you must not prophesy for money in England, had come back
genuinely impressed. She had not prophesied, but she had hit off
each man's character very neatly. Pointer had not much hope in
the issue of any interview with her, but she might classify these
hands still more narrowly than the microscope had done, and the
microscope's testimony would serve to check her statements, if
indeed she made any.</p>

<p>He took very careful imprints of the palms on tablets of
thick, warmed, modelling wax, brushing a little red powder over
them to bring out the lines. He wrapped each tablet in paraffin
paper and fastened them side by side in his case. Then he
telephoned from a call office for an appointment in the name of
Yardly, an immediate appointment. As it was not yet twelve, he
was successful. He drove to a house in Sloane Street, and was
shown into a cubicle. Mrs. Jansen's clients did not see each
other. After a few minutes waiting he was taken into a cheerful
room, where, in a window sat a well-dressed woman with a thick
mop of curly gray hair held back by combs. A pleasant, keen pair
of eyes looked up. A pleasant, firm hand shook his.</p>

<p>Pointer took a seat facing the light, laying his lean brown
fingers on two black velvet cushions. He would try her first with
his own hands. Her reading of them might end the interview&mdash;
probably would.</p>

<p>With a magnifying glass the American bent over them, turning
them now and then. She nodded her head finally as if
satisfied.</p>

<p>"I wish all the hands that have lain there were as pleasant
reading," she said, slipping the glass back into its case. "They
are the hands of one who, in any walk of life, would go to the
top. Your chief characteristic is love of justice. Your dominant
quality, penetration."</p>

<p>She went on to give an extraordinary accurate analysis of the
Chief Inspector's character. Pointer, who was a thoroughly nice
fellow, and very unassuming, actually blushed at the flattering
picture drawn.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you can guess the nature of my work? my trade? or
my profession?" he said, when she had done. "Or isn't that a fair
question?"</p>

<p>"It's a difficult one. But sometimes I hit the nail on the
head. I should say that law in some form was your branch. You
could be a barrister and a great one&mdash;you could be great in
any branch that you took up&mdash;only that the gift of a flow of
words isn't yours. Nor have you that kind of personal magnetism.
The friends you win are won by your character. Also, I don't
think that you work for money. I mean, I don't think that your
income depends on your work. So not a barrister...You're too
young to be a judge. Solicitor?...No, not solicitor. As I said
when I read your hands, you deal with tremendously important
issues. Your life is very varied, yet not by your own choosing.
The decisions you make are important ones. You're used to
constant calls on your physical courage. Used to it, and are
going to have plenty more of it...I should think the army but
for&mdash;" She bent closer.</p>

<p>"You know, if you were older and had an ecclesiastical bent,
from certain things in your hand I should guess you some Superior
in the Jesuit Order. Even Vicar-General..."</p>

<p>This did amuse Pointer. He showed it. But it gave him little
hope of any good issue from this wildest of forlorn ventures for
a Scotland Yard man.</p>

<p>"It's nearer the mark than you think," Mrs. Jansen said
shrewdly. "It would have suited one side of your character very
well. By your laugh I see that you're not even a Roman Catholic.
Then what about&mdash;" She frowned, gazing at the erect figure
sitting so easily in the chair. Pointer could not slouch.</p>

<p>"Law...danger...executive ability," she murmured. "Police! And
since your hands show that you are a man doing work that
thoroughly suits your talents, I should say some big man at
Scotland Yard. How about the C.I.D.?"</p>

<p>She leant back and looked up inquiringly. Pointer gave a
nod.</p>

<p>"You've hit it, and very clever of you indeed! You did that so
neatly that I wonder what you'll make of the owner of these
hands." He laid down his tablets. "It's to be paid for as a
separate visit, of course. Do your best with them, won't
you."</p>

<p>She glanced at the tablets. Then she looked a little vexed.
"Really, Mr.&mdash;eh&mdash;" She paused. "I know the Assistant
Commissioner by sight. Are you the Commissioner?"</p>

<p>"No, no! I'm from the ranks. But you were saying?"</p>

<p>"If you take the trouble to glance through my book on
Practical Cheirography, you'll see those palms analysed in
Chapter Ten. Mr. Julian Clifford kindly let me use his hands in
my chapter on authors."</p>

<p>Pointer felt as though he had had a severe punch. For Julian
Clifford was England's greatest living author.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure these tablets are imprints of Julian
Clifford's hands?" he asked tranquilly.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite! His are as unforgettable, as unmistakable, as
Sarah Bernhardt's. See. Here they are!" She drew a book from
under the table and opened it at a couple of plates. Pointer's
head was all astir. But he scrutinised them through her
magnifying glass. The illustrations seemed identical with his
tablets, even to a slight enlargement of the top joint of the
left forefinger.</p>

<p>He thanked her and prepared to go. She stopped him with an
exclamation. She was bending over his tablets with her glass.</p>

<p>"These were not taken from the hands of a living man! Julian
Clifford must be dead!"</p>

<p>"What an idea!" he scoffed.</p>

<p>"A true one! There's a lack of spring, of elasticity about
them that's unmistakable. Julian Clifford dead! What a loss to
the world! Was it in some accident?"</p>

<p>There was a pause. Mrs. Jansen's reputation was that of an
absolutely trustworthy woman. Besides, her face vouched for her.
Or rather, her aura. That immense, impalpable Something, woven of
our thoughts, our desires, that surrounds each one of us, that
never leaves us, that perhaps is most truly "us"&mdash;<i>en
Nefss</i>, as the Arabs call it&mdash;having its own way of
making itself felt, its own warnings, its own dislikes,
attractions, and guarantees.</p>

<p>"I wanted you to help us identify a body," he said simply.
"Apparently you have. I wonder if there is anything more you can
tell me&mdash;about Mr. Clifford, I mean."</p>

<p>She interrupted him.</p>

<p>"That's no good with me,&mdash;I've seen your palms,
remember&mdash;I mean that air of a child asking to be helped
over the crossing. Besides, why are you here? You weren't in the
least interested in your own character. You were keenly
interested in those tablets. I don't think it's merely the
identification"&mdash;her eyes widened&mdash; "has
something&mdash;something criminal&mdash;happened to Mr.
Clifford? Has he been&mdash;killed?" she asked in a low,
horrified voice.</p>

<p>"And supposing something 'wrong' has happened to him, Mrs.
Jansen?" He gave her back a long, steady stare. "Mind you, all
this is in strictest confidence. I'm Chief Inspector Pointer of
New Scotland Yard. Of the C.I.D. The whole of this conversation,
of my inquiries, must be kept absolutely to yourself, just as the
Yard will treat anything you tell me about Mr. Clifford as
confidential. Why did the idea come so quickly to you that his
death may be due to a crime? You have more to go on than merely
my coming to see you."</p>

<p>She looked at him over her horn spectacles for all the world
like a modern witch.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clifford came to see me himself a week ago last
Thursday," she said finally. "He wanted to know whether I would
look in his hands and tell him if any danger threatened him. He
was kind enough to say that I had impressed him as truthful when
I took the photographs of his hands for my book two years ago. I
had only seen him that once before. In Cannes."</p>

<p>"And you?"</p>

<p>"I told him that that was out of my line. Nor could any one
have answered that question for him. His hands only showed
character and talents...That sort of thing. There are people
whose hands do record events...His didn't. Events outside him
didn't enter into Julian Clifford. What mattered to him came
always from within. Death, for instance, wasn't marked on his
palms. Death means very little to him. His personality was quite
distinct from his body. With some people it is bound up in it.
Even a toothache is marked on their palms."</p>

<p>"What did you tell him? May I know?"</p>

<p>"I told him just that. He seemed rather disappointed. He asked
me to look again. 'I'm on the eve of
something&mdash;well&mdash;important.' He hesitated before using
that word. I thought he chose it finally rather as a cloak. I
don't think 'important' was the word he would have used in
writing."</p>

<p>"You think Clifford the man was not so honest as Clifford the
writer?"</p>

<p>She did not reply for a moment. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have an idea that he was undecided about something. Or
perhaps hesitating before doing something would be a better
word."</p>

<p>Again there was a silence.</p>

<p>"Is that all you can tell me about him?"</p>

<p>"Everything," she said, with a frank look into the detective-officer's face.</p>

<p>Pointer stared at his shoes.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jansen, I wish you'd tell me Mr. Clifford's weak
points&mdash;as you see them. Suppose something untoward has
happened to him. Something that needs investigation. As a rule a
man's good qualities don't lead to that necessity. Was there
anything in Julian Clifford's character&mdash;as shown in his
hands&mdash;that could have brought about, or led to, or
explain&mdash;sudden death? Mind you, I ask this in strictest
confidence."</p>

<p>She nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"In strictest confidence," she repeated, "nothing in his hands
could explain any end other than a happy and honoured one. His
was a fine character, noble and generous. He had faults, of
course. There was a certain ruthlessness where his work was
concerned. He would have sacrificed his all on that
altar...unconsciously or even consciously."</p>

<p>Still Pointer looked at his shoes.</p>

<p>"Was he a man of high morality, would you say?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he had ever been tempted. He was fastidious by
temperament, and his wealth made high standards fairly easy."
Mrs. Jansen rose. "And that, Mr. Chief Inspector, is all I can
tell you. Mr. Clifford sat a moment there in that chair you're
in, peering at his own palms. He was very short-sighted. Then he
looked at me half in vexation as he got up. 'What did the
ancients do when the oracle wouldn't oracle?' And with that he
said good-bye."</p>

<p>"Can I call upon you, in case of need, to identify the hands
from which I took these wax impressions as those of Julian
Clifford?" Pointer asked, rising.</p>

<p>"I will identify them any time, any where, as his Hands are to
me what faces are to most people&mdash;the things I go by."</p>

<p>Pointer paid the moderate fees and drove off. His whole being
was in a turmoil under his quiet exterior. Julian Clifford, the
great author, younger brother of Sir Edward Clifford of the
Foreign Office, to be that headless trunk!</p>

<p>Back at Scotland Yard, within half an hour, the plates in Mrs.
Jansen's book were enlarged and compared with quickly-taken
photographs of the dead man's palms. Again they seemed to be
identical. Every whorl and loop, which showed in both
tallied.</p>

<p>Pointer meanwhile looked up Clifford's town address. It was
given as Thornbush, Hampstead. A moment more, and he was asking
over the telephone if he could speak to Mr. Clifford&mdash;Mr.
Julian Clifford.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clifford is away, sir," a servant's voice answered.</p>

<p>"Away!" Pointer's tone marked incredulous surprise. "But he
had an appointment with the Home Secretary at eleven!"</p>

<p>"He's not here, sir."</p>

<p>"But surely he gave you a message, or a letter when he left?
It's Mr. Marbury of the Home Office who is speaking."</p>

<p>Pointer's tone suggested that Mr. Marbury was not accustomed
to be slighted.</p>

<p>"I'll inquire, sir," a crushed voice replied.</p>

<p>There was a pause, then the voice came again, very
apologetically.</p>

<p>"No, sir. No message was left. Mr. Clifford left early this
morning before any one was up."</p>

<p>"Most extraordinary!" Mr. Marbury said stiffly. "I think I'll
call and see some one about the matter." He hung up.</p>

<p>So Julian Clifford was supposed to have left his home before
any one was up. That probably meant that he had not been seen
since last night. Since last night, when a murder had been
committed in Heath Mansions.</p>

<p>What about Julian Clifford's brother! He might have some
information. But an inquiry at the Foreign Office for Sir Edward
told Pointer that the brother was not in town. A few questions to
his valet in Pont Street added the information that Sir Edward
had left town yesterday, Monday, evening after dining with his
brother, Mr. Julian Clifford, at the latter's house. He had gone
to his cottage in Surrey, a peaceful spot where the telephone was
not.</p>

<p>Pointer opened his <i>Who's Who</i>. He reviewed the well-known facts of the novelist and playwright's life. Clifford was a
little under forty-five, the younger son of the late Sir James
Clifford of Clifford's Bank, long since incorporated in one of
the big general banks; he had had a brilliant career at Eton and
Oxford, and was the author of an imposing array of novels,
poetry, plays, and serious works. He had been twice married, the
first time to Catherine Haslar, daughter of Sir William Haslar,
High Commissioner of Australia, and, some years after her death,
to Alison Willoughby, daughter of Mr. Willoughby of Sefton Park.
Clifford had no children.</p>

<p>That was all very well as far as it went. But again it did not
go far.</p>

<p>Pointer smoothed his crisp hair which always looked as though
it would curl if it dared. Then he pressed a bell. Could Mr. Ward
come to his room at once? Apparently Mr. Ward could, for in
another moment there appeared in the door a vision to delight a
tailor's eye. Ward, sartorially speaking, was It, even in a royal
group. His quaint pen-name adorned many a weekly paper. Always
up-to-date, invariably correct in all his reports, for two hours
of every week-day Ward occupied a small room in one wing next to
the Assistant Commissioner's.</p>

<p>"About Julian Clifford&mdash;not his literary side, I suppose?
Just so. A description of his appearance? Especially of his
face?"</p>

<p>Ward gave a very good pen-picture of the great man, after
which he repeated briefly what Pointer already knew about
Clifford's family.</p>

<p>"Present wife had intended to become a Pusey Sister. Changed
her mind and took to divining rods and crystal balls instead. Is
on the committees of all the spook societies. People say she's a
wonderful clairvoyante. But then they always do say that if the
person concerned talks enough to enough people. She usually
carries a crystal ball around with her in her bag."</p>

<p>"Supposing," Pointer began, lighting his pipe&mdash;that
beloved pipe of his which he always denied himself while on the
scene of a crime&mdash;it might blot out other scents.
"Supposing, Mr. Ward, that Julian Clifford had suddenly
disappeared from his circle, where would you look for him
first?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know. Clifford does this sort of thing every now and
then, you know, when he wants some new material for a book. But
he always returns to the surface within a week or a month."</p>

<p>"But supposing you had reason to think that something had
happened to him&mdash;that something was wrong with his
disappearance this time?"</p>

<p>"Good God!" Ward's light manner dropped from him. "You don't
mean to tell me, Chief Inspector, that anything serious has
happened to Julian Clifford?"</p>

<p>Pointer nodded. "I do." He did not insult Scotland Yard, nor
Ward, by asking him to regard that as confidential. Everything
that was said within these walls was always confidential to the
men considered sufficiently trustworthy to be consulted
there.</p>

<p>"You mean that he's&mdash;dead?" Ward asked in a hushed voice.
"You think there's been foul play?" He spoke in the tone of a man
who asks a monstrous question.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to say that I'm sure of it. And so, I want you to
think whether you've ever heard any talk, any hint, anything that
could explain his murder." Pointer gave the few terrible facts.
Ward felt that headless body as an additional horror.</p>

<p>"Incredible!" he murmured. "No I know nothing whatever that
can explain this crime. It must have been the work of a
maniac."</p>

<p>"He was a wealthy man, I always understood?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"A very wealthy man apart from his literary work. And a quite
sufficiently wealthy man apart from his private fortune."</p>

<p>"Who are the inmates of his household, not counting servants,
do you know?" was the next question.</p>

<p>Ward had often been the guest of the Cliffords.</p>

<p>"All of them beyond suspicion. First there's Adrian Hobbs.
He's Mrs. Clifford's cousin, and acts as Clifford's literary
agent. Clever chap. Thoroughly good business man. Really he's
wasted in his present surroundings. Hobbs ought to 've started
life with half a crown and a huckster's barrow."</p>

<p>"Straightforward?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, I should say. That is&mdash;eh, well&mdash;of
course, he's a good business man, as I told you."</p>

<p>Both smiled.</p>

<p>"What's he like to look at?"</p>

<p>"Big, powerful build. Heavyweight." Ward described Hobbs'
looks. "Then there's Clifford's regular secretary. A poor fellow
who lost his memory during the war. Blown up once too often. Just
at the end too. Hard lines, eh? Name of Newman. Clifford ran
across him at a base hospital, and gave him a try. He's very good
indeed, I believe."</p>

<p>Again, at Pointer's request, he gave a snapshot of the
secretary's appearance. Slim, but very strong, he thought
him.</p>

<p>"How do these two men and Mrs. Clifford get on? You say they
both live with the Cliffords?"</p>

<p>"She bores her cousin, Hobbs, stiff. And I think she secretly
bores Newman too. Though he's a chap of whom it's very difficult
to know what he thinks."</p>

<p>"Were the Cliffords attached to each other?"</p>

<p>"As far as I know, very much so. But of course&mdash;there's
that talk about Mrs. Orr, the Merry Widow."</p>

<p>"Widow? Grass or sod, as the Americans say."</p>

<p>Ward laughed. "Oh, a genuine widow. As though you hadn't heard
of the beautiful Mrs. Orr. As beautiful and far swifter than the
latest eight-cylinder. Julian Clifford is supposed to
be&mdash;was supposed to be&mdash;putting her in his next novel.
All I know is he's been haunting her society lately. In season
and out of season."</p>

<p>"And what does Mrs. Clifford say to the hauntings? Hasn't she
tried to lay the spirit?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford is quite unperturbed, apparently. She goes on
smiling her faint smiles and dreaming her dreams, and hearing her
voices and seeing her visions in her crystal. She's one of the
few women who haven't begun to cold-shoulder Mrs. Orr of late.
Rather the other way."</p>

<p>"More friendly than usual?"</p>

<p>"I saw them driving in the park together only last Friday.
Never saw that before."</p>

<p>Pointer hurried off. It was one o'clock. Gossip, even very
relevant gossip, must wait until he knew whether it were really
wanted or not.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>

<p class="first">AN elderly-looking, round-shouldered man, whose
stoop took from his real height, walked up to the gates of
Thornbush half an hour later.</p>

<p>Pointer had looked out the hours of postal deliveries. He had
timed himself so as to be on the drive when a postman overtook
him. He turned.</p>

<p>"Any letters for me&mdash;Marbury?" he asked pleasantly. "And
I'll take on any for the household at the same time."</p>

<p>The postman thanked him, told him there were none for him, and
handed him four for the house.</p>

<p>Though Pointer looked a typical civil servant from his neatly-trimmed beard to his neatly-adjusted spats, he knocked at the
front door with the four letters&mdash;three for Julian Clifford,
Esq., and one for Mrs. Clifford&mdash;in his pocket. He might re-post them after the briefest of delays&mdash;or he might not.</p>

<p>"I telephoned to Mr. Clifford just now, and was told that he
is not at his home." The very way in which Pointer felt for his
card-case suggested near sight and a certain precise
fussiness.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clifford is away, sir. But will you see Mr. Hobbs? Mr.
Hobbs said he particularly wanted to see you, sir." The butler
led the caller into a room near by. A young man rose civilly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marbury? From the Home Office?"</p>

<p>"I called to inquire why Mr. Clifford failed to keep an
appointment he had this morning with the Home Secretary. Can I
see him a moment? The matter is connected with the Metropolitan
Special Constabulary Reserve, and is very urgent. We are drawing
up our lists."</p>

<p>Hobbs seemed puzzled. "Did Mr. Clifford have an appointment? I
think there's some mistake."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Pointer broke in. "I'm sure there is. Kindly let me
know where I can reach him on the 'phone."</p>

<p>Hobbs stroked his smooth black hair. Then he stroked his
smooth blue chin.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector was by nature and training a remarkably
astute reader of faces, but he was looking at one now
which&mdash;like his own&mdash;hid completely the character
behind it. Like himself, Adrian Hobbs looked about thirty, more
or less. Like himself, too, he suggested an out-of-door man. Like
himself, Hobbs was exceedingly neat in appearance. From his hair
to his well-shod feet he satisfied the most fastidious eye. His
mind, again like Pointer's, was clearly a tidy mind. But beyond
that even Pointer could not size him up. The eyes were large and
wide apart. Were they frank or merely bold? The nose was long.
Was it predatory or merely self-assertive? Was the large mouth
frank? Or was there something just a shade sinister to it when he
smiled?</p>

<p>"I really can't understand it," Hobbs said finally. "I had no
idea that Mr. Clifford took any interest in the
matter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is precisely why I must trouble you for his address. Or
a telephone number that will reach him," Pointer again put in
swiftly.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Hobbs smiled slightly, "impossible to give you
either. Mr. Clifford has gone off in search of local colour, and
where he gets it is always his own closely-kept secret. He left
no address. He never does. In good time&mdash;a day, a week, two
weeks&mdash;he'll be back."</p>

<p>"But a man doesn't make an appointment a week ahead with the
Home Secretary and not keep it!" Pointer ejaculated; in the tone
of a man whose patience is wearing thin.</p>

<p>The truism seemed to worry Hobbs. He nodded, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>"I feel sure that he has left some word with some one. He must
have!" Pointer urged.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clifford's engagement-book shows nothing for this
morning," Hobbs said finally.</p>

<p>"When did he leave?"</p>

<p>"This morning. I got down to breakfast to find that he was
gone. There was a note for me to say that he had left to explore
some Chinese haunts. Liverpool rather than London, I fancy."</p>

<p>"Incredible!" Pointer murmured. "But"&mdash;an idea seemed to
strike him&mdash;"would you ask Mrs. Clifford to spare me a few
minutes? I must try and get this straightened out."</p>

<p>"Do you mind seeing if Mrs. Clifford's in the garden?" Hobbs
turned to another man who was writing at the farther end of the
large room where he and Pointer were talking. A man whom Pointer
knew, by Ward's description, to be Newman, Julian Clifford's
private secretary, and whom he had been secretly watching. The
Chief Inspector had purposely lowered his voice so that what he
was saying should only be partly audible to Newman. He noticed
the intent look on the secretary's face, not when he entered the
room, but when he spoke of Julian Clifford in a purposely raised
voice. The look that came then, was that of a man straining his
ears. Ordinary curiosity might explain this with many men. But
Pointer did not think that curiosity was a trait of the dark
young man with the close-shut mouth, and the deep-set, reserved
eyes. Newman's ordinary interest, or he misread him greatly, was
concentrated in some inner life of his own. A life so interesting
in its close seclusion that he lived there almost exclusively.
True, he would, he must, come out into some other court for
business purposes, to buy and sell. The many who penetrated thus
far, might indeed think that they had the run of all that there
was to the man. But Pointer felt sure that there would be walled
courtyard within walled courtyard and lock after lock behind
which the real man stood on guard.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'd better go myself," Hobbs said, after a
second.</p>

<p>Alone in the room, Pointer thought over the two men,
especially the secretary. There were great potentialities in that
face. Newman had lost his memory in the last year of the war,
Ward had said. But was the face at which the detective officer
had just glanced, so apparently casually, the face of one with no
memory reaching back beyond 1918?</p>

<p>Pointer had seen men who had lost all recollection of their
lives up to a certain point. In the eyes of each had been a look
impossible to forget or mistake. A piteous, searching look. The
look of those who feel that they are the consequences of days
that they cannot remember, that in their characters they are
reaping what, as far as their surface intelligence is concerned,
they have not sown. But Newman, strange though the effect was
that he produced on Pointer's keen scrutiny, had not that look.
Those watchful eyes...the iron reserve of the face...Nothing
could give that last but year on year of rigorous self-control. A
self-control that was never set aside for a moment. Great
business men sometimes have it, statesmen occasionally. Pointer
had invariably seen it on those privileged to attend on
royalties.</p>

<p>His thoughts passed on to the effect which his questions about
Clifford had had on the men. Hobbs, Clifford's literary agent,
had shown no emotion. But Newman? Newman was startled. Pointer
knew that as well as though he had been one of these modern
instruments which record heart beats. The man's rigid, sudden
immobility had but one cause.</p>

<p>Yet, though Pointer could jump to conclusions when he could
alter them, he was a very wary man when, as here, his conclusions
were fundamental&mdash;were the basis on which he must build.</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened. Though Pointer did not know
it, it was Julian Clifford's librarian who now looked in. A young
man called Richard Straight, who, wandering rather aimlessly
about the house, collecting missing volumes from library sets,
had just met Hobbs. He had turned and stared after the literary
agent. Hobbs' face was strangely set. Straight promptly popped
his head into the room which the other had just left. He saw
nothing to explain Hobbs' look. A stout, elderly man was trying
to disentangle his glasses from his watch-chain. At sight of the
librarian, the elderly caller rose.</p>

<p>"Mr. Newman, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No." Straight came on into the room. "No, but can I be of any
use? I'm the new librarian here. Very new, I'm afraid. I only
arrived yesterday&mdash;from Melbourne."</p>

<p>"I called," Pointer explained wearily, "on a very urgent
matter. I must get into touch with Mr. Clifford. I'm from the
Home Office, I should mention, and Mr. Clifford was due at a
meeting to discuss the lists of the Metropolitan Special Reserve
Constabulary. We want him on the committee." He looked
questioningly at Straight, who looked questioningly back at him.
"Mr. Clifford is absent, it seems. The Home Secretary is
waiting!" Pointer's tone was inimitable as he pronounced those
five words.</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Clifford?" Pointer went on irritably, "kindly
let me have his address, and I will do what I can to straighten
out this most deplorable mistake."</p>

<p>"I haven't it," Straight said promptly. "Mr. Clifford
apparently never leaves it when he goes off to collect new
material for his work. He only left this morning."</p>

<p>"This morning!" Pointer's tone suggested that here was indeed
the last straw. "Why, the appointment was for today!"</p>

<p>Straight merely smiled and shook his head, as though to say
that he was not responsible for his employer's habits.</p>

<p>Hobbs returned. He shot a swift glance from Straight to
Pointer. An inquiring glance.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford knows no more than I do, but if you feel that
you would like to see her, she is willing to give you a few
moments, Mr. Marbury."</p>

<p>Hobbs showed Pointer into a large quiet room with bookshelves
shoulder-high running around it. A big writing table stood by one
window. A Koran stand, various old carved reading-desks, and
lecterns, and broad tables such as architects use, were here and
there. It was Clifford's own room, and admirably suited to its
purpose of writing. The men stood desultorily talking of the
weather, which, after having given a selection of winter airs for
the past week, had remembered that July was the tune which it was
booked to play, and seemed at last endeavouring to provide
something suitable.</p>

<p>After a minute or two the door opened. Pointer had never seen
any one quite like Alison Clifford. He had expected beauty, for
Julian Clifford had written of many a lovely heroine. But this
was not beauty as he understood it.</p>

<p>She was very tall, very slender, and very pale. Lint-white the
short, soft hair, so fine that, as she turned to shut the door,
it stirred above her head like thistledown. With every movement,
with her very breathing, it seemed to rise and fall like the hair
of a spirit. Her skin was white too. White and smooth, with a
sheen as of a lily's petals. Even her lips were but a hint of
colour. Her eyes were a clear aquamarine, veiled by lashes so
white that they looked as though thickly floured. Something about
the face made the Chief Inspector think of a face seen under
water, or through a veil.</p>

<p>Pointer explained again about the meeting at the Home
Secretary's.</p>

<p>"So sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Clifford, but I thought that
perhaps you might remember some trifle which would help to locate
Mr. Clifford&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford regretted that she could be of no use. "My
husband often disappears for a short time. Generally, of course,
he lets me know where he will be, but not always. And I'm afraid
he has a very poor memory for engagements."</p>

<p>"Sometimes he's writing, or dictating, and gets to a passage
which needs local knowledge," Hobbs put in, "when he'll stop,
think a moment, and without a word leave the room, take down his
hat and topcoat, and be off. To return with the necessary
information and atmosphere perhaps after a week."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford smiled acquiescence. "I'm afraid we must possess
our souls in patience. He left me a note saying that he might be
delayed until Friday."</p>

<p>"Delayed?" Pointer wondered at that word.</p>

<p>"I've heard, of course, of your wonderful powers," he went on
politely. "Couldn't you ascertain by means of them where Mr.
Clifford really is?" It was a test question. What would the
woman's reply be?</p>

<p>"I've been watching him in my crystal off and on all morning,"
she said at once, smiling faintly with down-dropped
lids&mdash;lids so thin that Pointer could see the colour of the
iris through them.</p>

<p>Even as she spoke she touched the antique silver clasp of a
small black velvet bag beside her. Within it Pointer saw a ball
of what looked like glass. Bending lower she looked into it. He
watched her. Seen like this, with the light on her silvery hair
and amber frock, he saw her charm for the first time. There was
something very alluring about the picture which she made. She
looked like a tree sprite talking for a few moments to a
mortal.</p>

<p>"There he is now!" she exclaimed suddenly. "I can always get
results quicker if I am with some one who wants to see what I do.
Yes, there he is!"</p>

<p>She half turned a shoulder so that both Pointer and Hobbs
could look. Pointer saw but the shifting light beautifully
reflected in the ball. Hobbs had stalked to the window, and stood
with his back to the room, disapproval in every line of his
body.</p>

<p>"What is Mr. Clifford doing? Where is he?" Marbury asked,
gaping. Was the faint smile that curved her pale mouth
mischievous or malicious?</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there's no address given in a crystal. I only see
a street...a very winding street..." She was staring into the
ball with what looked like concentrated attention, turning it now
and then in its nest of velvet.</p>

<p>"Gables," she went on, "built like steps running up into
heaven, are on both sides of him. Now he's lighting a cigarette.
He's pulled out his watch. Now he's gone!"</p>

<p>"Gables built like steps running up into heaven?" Pointer
echoed. "What sort of houses would they be on?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford shot Hobbs a glance from under her lids as she
shut her velvet bag. Pointer fancied that she regretted those
words, and hoped that her cousin had not heard them.</p>

<p>"Oh, just irregular gables," she said hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" Marbury fairly gaped; "really wonderful! Thank
you so much. And when Mr. Clifford returns, will you ask him to
have a message sent me? We may clear up the mystery then. For I
confess I find Mr. Clifford's unexpected absence a mystery."</p>

<p>His rather yellow eyeballs&mdash;there are drops, very
beneficial to the eye, which yellow the balls for the rest of the
day&mdash; turned vaguely towards the figure of a young woman who
had just sauntered down the gravel path towards them past their
window. At his words, spoken very clearly, even though in
Marbury's little staccato voice, it stopped with the small head a
little forward on the long neck, the large eyes glancing into the
room at Mrs. Clifford&mdash;at Hobbs&mdash;at their visitor.
Dwelling on each in turn for a length of time that meant
uneasiness to Pointer. By what, or by whom, was the uneasiness
caused? "Is that Miss Clifford?" Marbury asked, taking a step
towards her, "perhaps she&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no Miss Clifford," Alison said, while the girl
outside stood still. No one made any move towards mentioning her
name.</p>

<p>"What! No help towards solving the puzzle of where Mr.
Clifford is! Dear, dear!"</p>

<p>Mr. Marbury dropped first one glove then the other. The girl
outside in the garden had stiffened where she stood. Now she
passed on.</p>

<p>"That's a Miss Haslar, a niece of Mr. Clifford's," Hobbs said
quickly, and turned towards the door.</p>

<p>Diana Haslar walked on as though deep in
thought&mdash;unpleasant thought. Tall and slender, she looked a
mere girl, but she was close on thirty. She had a fascinating
rather than a pretty face. There were subtle lines in it. There
was both mockery and mischief in her smile. And her large eyes
looked as though few things would escape them. Had there been a
greater warmth in it, her face would have been more universal in
its charm. Yet there were hints of fire in the tawny eyes, in the
beautiful lustre of her close-clipped, wavy hair, in some tones
of her rather deep voice. At last, still apparently lost in
thought, still unpleasant thought, she stepped into one of the
rooms, and laid a hand on the young librarian's shoulder.</p>

<p>Richard Straight, as he had told Marbury, had only landed
yesterday from Australia. He had been head librarian in a large
Melbourne civic library. Julian Clifford had met him while on a
world's lecturing tour, and had been struck with his original
views on how private libraries should be, and could be, run. On
his return, the author had offered him the post of his librarian.
A small position, but one that could bring Straight into contact
with many people worth meeting. Straight had thought it over for
a month, and finally accepted it. Had he known what Diana Haslar
carefully did not tell him until his decision was made, that the
great writer was a connection of hers, Straight would not have
hesitated for a day. He had been a constant visitor at the big
Haslar house in Melbourne. A friend of Arnold Haslar's, it was
not his fault if he was not by this time his brother-in-law. As
it was, he still hoped to win Diana.</p>

<p>"Dick!"&mdash;the two were about the same age, and Christian
names come easily in Australia&mdash;"tear yourself away from
first editions, isn't a man from the Home Office the same as from
the police?"</p>

<p>Richard Straight tore himself away from books very promptly at
the tone in which that question was put. He looked at her in
surprise.</p>

<p>"You'll be had up for slandering the Force if you mean that
benevolent old dear in the morning-room. He certainly can't be
the same as a policeman. Why?"</p>

<p>Diana seated herself on the table and ruffled the pages of a
book in a way to set a conscientious librarian's teeth on edge.
Dick did not seem to mind.</p>

<p>"He came about Uncle Julian...I heard him say his absence was
a mystery..."</p>

<p>"Well?" Dick asked easily.</p>

<p>Diana looked at him a moment in silence. Then she turned away.
Straight knew that a door had been gently shut in his face.</p>

<p>"How do you think you're going to like your work at
Thornbush?" she asked, after a moment.</p>

<p>"I think I'm going to like it very much here." This was high
praise from Straight. He was an ugly, clever-looking young man
with a certain air of quiet self-possession. An air which still
annoyed Diana Haslar exceedingly at times. "I should like any
place where I could be near you," he added rather fatuously.</p>

<p>She gave him a rallying smile.</p>

<p>"Any place? I really can't imagine your liking <i>any</i>
place, Dick. You're rather a particular young man. Besides, when
Uncle Julian has finished his Life of my grandfather, I'm off.
It's only the fact I can check the family dates better than any
one else can that keeps me here, though I like the work." She
finished thoughtfully with a certain critical note in her
voice.</p>

<p>"But not the house?" he asked, quickly looking up.</p>

<p>"We're so frank 'down under,'" she said a little wistfully,
"dreadfully frank, you used to think when you first came out. And
Thornbush&mdash;" She seemed to seek for the right word.</p>

<p>"Thornbush isn't?"</p>

<p>"Not frank. No. Not lately. I seem to be always interrupting
people in most private conversations. I think I shall be glad
when the Life is finished and I'm free once more. Though I love
being with Uncle Julian."</p>

<p>"He's a splendid chap, isn't he!" Straight said warmly. "His
welcome to me was kindness itself."</p>

<p>"He is kind. Yet he can be hard. When it's a question of his
work."</p>

<p>Again there was a tone to her voice that intrigued him.
Straight was fond of conundrums.</p>

<p>"Your uncle said in the notes he left each of us this morning
that he had gone for local colour. Is it possible that you think
'local colour' should be spelled Mazod Orr?"</p>

<p>This time it was Diana's expression that puzzled Straight as
she looked at him. She was far too modern a young woman to be
shocked at the suggestion. Yet there was a something in her
eye...</p>

<p>"I see that Arnold has been repeating the silly tittle-tattle
which is going the round in some quarters," she said scornfully.
"Why, Alison and Mazod Orr are tremendous friends&mdash;she is
seeing her off herself for Paris this morning."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"And how's Arnold?" Straight asked; "was it anything serious?"
The name of Mrs. Orr had suggested that of Arnold Haslar to him,
for Diana's brother was madly in love with the widow. Straight
knew that Diana had had a telephone message early this morning
that had made her hurry home, a message about Arnold having been
found beside his breakfast table in a state verging on
collapse.</p>

<p>"The doctor says it's trying to be 'flu. I wanted to stay, but
Arnold's not to see any one. If he remains in bed and keeps
absolutely quiet, the doctor thinks he may escape and be up to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Odd if Arnold should catch 'flu," Straight thought. "He
always seemed to be immune. He looked all right last night."</p>

<p>"The doctor says he must have had a shock of some kind, or
some great excitement. Do you know of anything?" She looked at
Straight rather narrowly. He did not, and said so.</p>

<p>"Must have happened when he was called out of town last
night," he suggested. "It was a business call, he told me, else
we had planned to celebrate my arrival, as you know, by some
crimson paint. If it isn't due to business worry, then it may be
remorse at his having cut me dead this morning. Absolutely
dead."</p>

<p>"Where was this?" she asked sceptically.</p>

<p>"Just outside a huge building on the corner of a main road
near here. I got lost trying to take an after-breakfast
stroll."</p>

<p>"Heath Mansions." Diana tapped her fingers on the table
restlessly. "He didn't see you evidently," she went on in a
rather absent-minded, ruminative voice.</p>

<p>"That's just it," he retorted. "Arnold shouldn't moon by
daylight. I waved a friendly paw, and he fled as though it held a
writ. Probably he was feeling ill. He looked perfectly
ghastly."</p>

<p>Once more an odd look crossed Diana's face.</p>

<p>"And he left you early last night?" she asked, as though
worried by that fact.</p>

<p>"Nearly as soon as I got there," Straight said, with a smile.
"But in response to a telephone call, which made it less of a
snub direct."</p>

<p>She did not smile. A silence fell on the room.</p>

<p>Suddenly Diana drew back farther into the shadow. Newman, her
uncle's secretary, was walking past the open window outside. He
looked up. Their eyes, his and hers, met. Newman's cigarette-case
dropped with a sharp tinkle, as though something in her glance
had startled him. He retrieved it instantly, and passing on, lit
a cigarette rather hastily.</p>

<p>His movements were singularly free from hurry, as a rule. Like
his face, they suggested plenty of reserve power. There was
something foreign about his appearance: a little in his easy
grace, more in his seldom-seen, faintly ironic, smile, most of
all in the melancholy of his dark, brooding eyes, which rarely
looked up. Newman had a habit of carrying on a whole conversation
with his eyes on his cigarette, or looking out of the window. In
build he was exceptionally lean and lithe, with small, strong
bones.</p>

<p>"I must ask Newman about these Spanish books," Straight
murmured. "Mr. Clifford told me in that talk we had last night
after dinner, that he's making himself into quite an authority on
Spain."</p>

<p>Diana said nothing.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clifford seemed to think him very clever, but&mdash;"
Then Straight too decided to say no more.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is!" Diana spoke with a certain grimness, "so clever
that one wonders why he remains content with life at Thornbush
year after year. There's some reason why he refuses every offer,
and he's had some good ones. Just as there's some reason why he
cultivates Arnold as he does. Mr. Newman does nothing without a
reason."</p>

<p>Diana spoke half under her breath.</p>

<p>"You sound afraid of him!" Straight gave her a very sharp
glance.</p>

<p>Diana's laugh failed to achieve carelessness.</p>

<p>"I loathe him. I can't think why he should try so tremendously
to ingratiate himself with Arnold, who, unfortunately, has taken
the most tremendous fancy to him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the fact that Arnold's your only brother," Dick
suggested.</p>

<p>"Mr. Newman and I feel alike about each other," Diana said
shortly, "mutual dislike. On my side, distrust as well. Profound
distrust."</p>

<p>"I must keep out of his way," Straight said lightly.</p>

<p>"On, he won't bother you! You're of no importance to him.
There's nothing to be gained by cultivating you"&mdash;she
flushed at her own rudeness and added hastily, "except the best
of pals. And possibly Mr. Newman may scent the rising man in you
that you are, Dick. However, even so, you'll be safe. I can't
imagine any one pulling the wool over your eyes."</p>

<p>"I'm done brown quite often," he murmured sadly.</p>

<p>"Not you!" she scoffed. "I always know that if ever any of us
gets into a hole you'll get us out." She bit her lip, as though
the words had slipped out. "Edward Clifford thinks the paper you
sent in to the Libraries Association a masterpiece. He said he
was going to keep an eye on you."</p>

<p>"A benevolent or a watchful eye?"</p>

<p>Both laughed. Straight looked down into her face not so far
below his own.</p>

<p>"Were you pleased?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"For your sake&mdash;very much." She laughed again, but
Straight did not laugh back.</p>

<p>"Can't you manage to love me, Diana?" he asked, with a sudden
passion in his voice.</p>

<p>"I thought we talked that over in Melbourne." She turned away,
not shyly&mdash;Diana was never shy&mdash;but with something
almost of impatience in her big eyes.</p>

<p>"Love!" she repeated under her breath. "Who does love, really?
What is it? How does it come? How do you know when it's real,
when it's not? I like you, Dick. I respect your character
immensely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then give me a chance Give me a try-out!" he urged again.</p>

<p>Diana only shook her head.</p>

<p>"I'll make you love me"&mdash;he spoke as though vowing a vow
unto himself&mdash;"with the real love. The love that stands by a
man when all else drops away. You have it in you, that I'll
swear. You <i>could</i> love, Diana!"</p>

<p>Diana was very pale.</p>

<p>"Not with the love that calls the world well lost." There was
a note of contempt in her voice. Was it for herself? or for the
subject of their talk? It was hard to tell with Diana.</p>

<p>"I haven't that in me. For your own sake, make no mistake! But
apart from that, I could be a good helper to an ambitious, rising
man. If ever I do agree to marry any one, I'll back him up
well."</p>

<p>"But you won't agree to marry&mdash;any one&mdash;now?"
Straight asked in his usual, rather measured voice.</p>

<p>"Not yet. Perhaps I shall never have any better answer. It
won't be any loss, believe me. I'm not deep. I'm shallow.
Shallow, and pleasure-loving, and greedy for good things." Her
tone was trivial again. "And now, let's talk of something else. I
mean it." Her eyes warned him not to press her for the
present.</p>

<p>"Well, then, let us discuss whether the Foreign Office secret-service men will catch that chap Sir Edward talked about so much
yesterday at dinner. The anarchist with the odd name..." Straight
looked to Diana to help him out. She did not glance up.</p>

<p>"Et&mdash;Etch&mdash;Sounds as if I were sneezing!" he said
crossly. "Etche&mdash;What <i>was</i> it?"</p>

<p>She made no suggestion.</p>

<p>The door opened. A girl looked in. It was Maud Gillingham, a
great admirer of Alison Clifford's.</p>

<p>"Di&mdash;but how white you are! Or is it that frock? Mrs.
Clifford has a message for you. A very important one. She's out
in the garden."</p>

<p>Maud Gillingham slid an arm through Diana's, and the two
sauntered out on to the lawn to where, under a cedar tree, Mrs.
Clifford lay in a long garden-chair looking more like the sketch
of a woman than actual flesh and blood. She lifted her strange
aquamarine eyes as the two came up to her.</p>

<p>"I have a message for you from your grandfather, Diana." She
spoke as casually as though she had just met the dead man in the
street. "From Sir William Haslar. It spelled itself out on my
Ouija board. I would have sent for you at once, only some
tiresome person came in about an appointment of Julian's...But
this message&mdash;'Tell Day' it began. Evidently you are
Day."</p>

<p>Diana started. That was her grandfather's name for her, not
heard for many a long year, and certainly not known to Alison
Clifford.</p>

<p>"...not to mind whatever it is that you are minding," Mrs.
Clifford went on. "That it will all come right. That he could see
the end, and it will all come right."</p>

<p>She signalled to Newman, who was standing watching them, to
come closer.</p>

<p>"Come along, Maud!" Diana turned to the girl beside her,
"let's take a stroll around the rosary. You know"&mdash;Diana
began when they were out of earshot&mdash;"there are times when I
can't bear Alison. Spiritualists can be so smug, and generally
are!"</p>

<p>"It's like talking to a woman from Mars sometimes," Maud
agreed, "but she can be wonderful. With Mr. Newman, for instance.
But I forgot&mdash;you don't like your uncle's secretary."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for him," Diana said rather reluctantly.</p>

<p>Maud Gillingham nodded. "Naturally. Anybody would have to be
sorry for a man who lost his memory in the war. But instead of
pitying him, as we all do, Mrs. Clifford makes him feel that what
he's lost is so tiny a thing in the immensity of our eternal life
that it really isn't worth while fretting over."</p>

<p>"Yet don't you think she'd fret if she lost <i>her</i>
memory?" Diana checked herself. "Maud, I never can quite make up
my mind about Alison. Is she posing, or is she quite
sincere?"</p>

<p>"Heavens, Di, if she weren't sincere she'd have to be an utter
liar. Surely you don't think that of her?" Maud was aghast. She
was an honest soul who knew no half-tones. You were white or you
were black to Maud.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no. No, of course I don't think that." Diana spoke
rather as though dropping a trap-door on something within herself
that wanted to peep out. "No, of course not. Every one knows that
Alison, however mistaken, has a beautiful mind. But that message
from my grandfather..." There was a pause.</p>

<p>"<i>Did</i> he call you Day?" Maud asked curiously.</p>

<p>"He did. But..." There was another pause. "This message from
him for me: Maud, doesn't it ever strike you that Alison always
gets the messages from the other world that she wants to get?
Hears the things she wants to hear?"</p>

<p>Maud reflected a moment.</p>

<p>"I think there's more than that in it, Di. Oh, much more! Look
at this last Saturday afternoon. But I don't think you were in
the room. Mrs. Orr was here, and was scoffing as usual in her
laughing way at something I said about Mrs. Clifford's powers.
But I stuck to it that she could 'see'&mdash;sometimes&mdash;with
her hands. Mrs. Orr whipped out a letter from her bag, folded it,
and held it folded on Mrs. Clifford's knee, and said, 'Read this,
then, Alison darling.' And she did! Mrs. Clifford did! She
pressed her hands hard down on the letter and read out a whole
sentence. 'If you keep your end up, no one will suspect us.' She
would have gone on, only Mrs. Orr put the letter back into her
bag. It was from a friend on her honeymoon. Even she looked
startled. And no wonder! If that wasn't white magic, what
is?"</p>

<p>Now Diana had been in the room; had heard and watched the
whole strange little scene. But what had struck her most had been
Julian Clifford's face as his wife began
slowly&mdash;laboriously&mdash; like some one reading a distant
signpost, to almost spell out the words. If Mazod Orr had looked
startled, so had he. Diana thought that his hand had palpably
twitched to snatch the envelope with its contents from under his
wife's fingers. He and Mrs. Orr had drifted on into his study to
look at some new prints which he had bought, and Diana saw again
Mrs. Clifford's equable smile as she looked after them. Yet there
had been a new element in her expression. Diana's perceptions
were very quick. In Alison Clifford's eyes was a look almost of
sarcasm. It was the smile with which skill might watch
transparent make-believe through which it sees absolutely, but
from which, for reasons of its own, it prefers not to tear the
cloak away. It was not an unkind smile&mdash;Alison never looked
unkind&mdash;but it had made Diana wonder. The two girls were
back again by the cedar tree now. Mrs. Clifford was talking to
Newman.</p>

<p>"But even so, why not let me get into touch with your
forgotten memories? They're not important, but still, why not
have them? I might be able to lift the veil for you."</p>

<p>Newman flicked the ash off his cigarette with an impatient
gesture which had something almost of contempt in it. There was a
certain haughty, hawk-like look about his whole face.</p>

<p>"I'd rather not. Thank you immensely for caring, Mrs.
Clifford. But I have a very definite feeling against having the
veil lifted that way. Your powers are very wonderful, but
something tells me, warns me, if you like, not to use them for
this purpose."</p>

<p>Diana gave him a long, long look. It amounted to a stare. "I
should never be able to resist the chance if I were you!" panted
Maud.</p>

<p>"You mean if <i>I</i> were <i>you</i>," Newman said looking at
her under his heavy, brooding lids&mdash;lids that lifted slowly.
There was something watchful about his gaze always&mdash;not
suspicious&mdash;just watchful.</p>

<p>Dick Straight joined the group, and when they moved towards
the house, sauntered after them with the secretary, of whom he
asked a question or two about a couple of old Spanish works on
the shelves. They were soon discussing Spanish bindings, and
Straight found that his companion was indeed well up in the
subject. Diana passed them again.</p>

<p>"I'm off to see how Arnold is, though he hates me to fuss over
him." She made her remark exclusively to Dick Straight.</p>

<p>"Interesting girl, Miss Haslar," Dick said casually as she
walked on.</p>

<p>"Most girls are," was the equally casual reply. Newman's dark
eyes glanced for the barest second at Straight's face; that face
was not usually considered a tell-tale one, yet Dick felt certain
that the man beside him was aware from it of the state of affairs
between himself and Diana.</p>

<p>Straight took an instant dislike to the man.</p>

<p>"Dago blood of some sort," he told himself, as Newman left him
with a civil excuse, and turned off into the hall.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4">CHAPTER 4</a></h2>

<p class="first">POINTER meanwhile, on his way back to Scotland
Yard, had opened the four letters handed him by the postman on
the Thornbush drive. The three to Mr. Clifford could have no
possible connection with the case. The letter to Mrs. Clifford
was different. It was from town, dated yesterday, and
ran&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Allison</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">A linelette to say that should you be asked
questions, be sure you know nothing. Remember we count on you to
put people off. Miles off. Till to-morrow morning.</p>

<p class="letter">In great haste,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Mazod Orr</span>.</p>

<p><br> That letter was put back in the Chief Inspector's letter-case. The others were fastened up and dropped in the nearest box.
"We count on you to put people off," he murmured. "Not always so
easy, my lady!"</p>

<p>Back at New Scotland Yard, during a belated lightning lunch,
Pointer asked Mr. Ward to be good enough to come into his room
again for a moment.</p>

<p>"Ever heard of Mr. Clifford's new librarian? A young man
called Straight?" he asked briskly.</p>

<p>"Librarian? I thought Newman had that job. But as Hobbs is
going for a six months' big game shoot in the autumn, I suppose
he's going off duty now&mdash;he has some private means, as well
as a whacking salary and commission&mdash;the new librarian may
be a sort of stop-gap. First I've heard of him."</p>

<p>"And who could a tall young woman be with handsome, rather
bitter eyes, and a face that should be beautiful but isn't. She
looks a lot younger than her years, I fancy." Pointer went on to
describe her colouring. He wanted to verify the name that Hobbs
had murmured. "I have a snapshot of her in my glove button, but I
can't develop it for the moment."</p>

<p>Pointer's glove stud, a thickish stud, furnished a complete
minute roll of films, and was a perfect tiny camera by the touch
of a nail on the edge.</p>

<p>"That'll be Miss Haslar, Clifford's niece. She's helping Mr.
Clifford with his Life of her grandfather, Sir William
Haslar."</p>

<p>"Very fond of gossip, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Diana Haslar? Not half as fond of it as I am," chuckled Ward.
"No, she's rather a high-brow."</p>

<p>"Is she attached to her uncle? Mr. Clifford would only be her
uncle by marriage, of course."</p>

<p>"Worshipped him. Absolutely worshipped him."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Arnold Haslar an electrical engineer in a big way, the
head of the Wellwyn Company of Melbourne, a relative of
hers?"</p>

<p>"Only brother. Only relative, as far as I know. Her father's
dead."</p>

<p>"And this brother, was he by way of worshipping Mr. Julian
Clifford too?"</p>

<p>"Until he and the widow got so friendly. Mrs. Orr is
absolutely ripping, you know. If rumour tells the truth she has
ripped through a good deal in a fairly short time, but she's
connected with all the peerage that counts, royal god-mother, and
so on. So what would you? It'll take a lot to sink her little
boat definitely. Haslar is tremendously in love with her. He's of
no family, but he's wealthy. She can't do better. Wonder is, she
can do as well. For he's the last chap to stand some things. Yet
they say it's she who's lately holding off. No one can understand
it. Clifford's interest is purely academic. She's a type to him.
That's all. But why Mazod the Fair should be apparently turning
Haslar down is the mystery. Clifford can't marry her even if he
wanted to, which he doesn't. Haslar wants to. Unless she tries
him too far. He's not the sort to make a good dupe. The woman
can't have lost her very alert wits..." Ward ruminated over the
problem.</p>

<p>"What sort of man is this Arnold Haslar?" Pointer finally
asked.</p>

<p>Ward pondered.</p>

<p>"Well, not the sort of chap I should select with whom to wipe
the floor. Not without a tussle. All correct to the outward eye,
of course. But there's wild blood in his background. Botany Bay,
in fact. Not for anything terrific. Well-deserved manslaughter we
should call it nowadays&mdash;at least I should." Ward corrected
himself hastily. He and the Chief Inspector had crossed swords on
that point before. "You know the retort his grandpa made when
Lord Boodle wrote an article during the last election hinting at
his family's past? Old Sir William, as he was later, wrote back
that it was quite true. His ancestor had been deported for not
enduring what his, the honourable writer's, ancestor had been
ennobled for standing. To any one who knew the Boodle pedigree it
was a bit sledge-hammer, but very amusing. Australia crowed."</p>

<p>"So that there's ill-feeling between him and Clifford over
Mrs. Orr?" Pointer repeated meditatively.</p>

<p>Ward nodded. "Said to be."</p>

<p>"Does Miss Haslar know of the attachment between her brother
and Mrs. Orr?" This Ward did not know, but he felt certain that
if she did so, Diana would very much object.</p>

<p>Pointer stood with bent head, hands deep in his pockets, eyes
on his shoes. It was a favourite position of his when deep in
thought.</p>

<p>"What about Sir Edward Clifford, Mr. Julian Clifford's
brother? What is his reputation among his own set?"</p>

<p>"None better," was the expected reply. "A stickler for
conventions, but that's all to the good in a man of his
position."</p>

<p>"Were the two brothers on friendly terms?"</p>

<p>"On the very best. Always. Even though both wanted to marry
the same young woman, and though Julian Clifford carried off the
prize, it made no difference in their friendship. I'm speaking of
the present Mrs. Clifford."</p>

<p>And that finished Ward's information.</p>

<p>Pointer pressed a knob. A light shone out on the table of one
of his constable clerks in the next room. The man came in.</p>

<p>"Get me the address of the Wellwyn Company's London warehouse.
Find out if it has any others in Great Britain."</p>

<p>In a few minutes Pointer had an address in Thames Street. The
only warehouse, or office, of the great Australian firm in the
United Kingdom.</p>

<p>To it Inspector Watts was sent, to find out by dexterous
questions whether any parcel or package had arrived there since
last night, except such as were to be handled and opened in the
usual way of trade.</p>

<p>Next, a woman detective was sent to call on Mrs. Orr for a
subscription to a quite genuine orphanage, and incidentally to
find out from whoever would be in the house where that lady had
been last night.</p>

<p>That done, an inquiry was put through to Mr. Arnold Haslar at
his office in Thames Street. Warehouse and office were in the
same building. The inquiry was intended to lead up to a polite
request to allow Mr. Marbury to come and see him with a view to
adding his name to the same M.S.C. Reserve in which, apparently,
Mr. Julian Clifford had been so interested. Pointer learnt that
Mr. Haslar had not been at his office all day&mdash;that he was
down with influenza. And from the butler at his house in
Hampstead, Pointer heard that complete quiet had been ordered him
and a day in bed. Yes, the attack had been very sudden. Mr.
Haslar had been all right yesterday. He had come down ill this
morning.</p>

<p>This morning! Pointer was interested. So much so that a plain
clothes man was despatched to keep an unobtrusive eye on the
invalid's house. And an order was left that the telephones of it
and of Mrs. Orr's house, and of Thornbush were to be all
connected with New Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>As for Thornbush, just a little over an hour after Mr. Marbury
left it, a red-haired, very freckled, lantern-jawed man from the
gas company was knocking at the back door.</p>

<p>They were installing meters farther down. Something had blown
out. The pipes here must be looked to, or there might be trouble.
The butler was dazed by a string of the latest bye-laws&mdash;so
Pointer called them&mdash;rattled off at to speed, and promptly
let the man make a tour of inspection.</p>

<p>The gas man was very thorough, even though he worked amazingly
swiftly. Every cupboard was opened and swiftly scanned. The top
glanced over. Every movable article was lifted quickly. Pointer
had found out at the Yard, before he started, the average weight
of a dead man's head. He had had that weight dropped into a
seven-pound biscuit tin, filled with plaster of Paris, and lifted
the whole several times, registering the weight.</p>

<p>He found few packages or parcels at Thornbush heavy enough for
what he wanted. These few were carefully inspected. He even took
one swift turn over the roof. And besides being keenly on the
watch for biscuit tins ostensibly filled with plaster, he kept a
look-out for weapons of any kind. He drew a blank in both
respects. But within ten minutes he found what he was primarily
after. Finger-prints on a dozen articles of Julian Clifford's
were unmistakably the finger-prints of the man in the
mortuary.</p>

<p>Pointer was outwardly unmoved, but his pulses beat quicker. He
had won the first round. In vain had the head of the murdered man
been cut off, the clothes taken away. No longer could a doubter
say that the man whose hands Mrs. Jansen had photographed at
Cannes, and the man who had come to her office in town, though he
called himself Julian Clifford, might be an impostor. Here was
the proof that the author and the murdered man were one and the
same.</p>

<p>As for the rest, neither Clifford's room, nor his wife's, nor
Hobbs', had anything important to tell the Chief Inspector. Nor,
strictly speaking, had Newman's. Yet in one way the secretary's
room interested Pointer greatly. Newman had lived many years now
with Clifford, yet the bedroom and his working room were as bare
of personal effects as hotel rooms. There was not so much as a
calendar which seemed the personal choice of the secretary. The
only books were from a circulating library unless they belonged
to Clifford.</p>

<p>Pointer stood looking about him, his bag of tools in his hand&mdash;intentionally bare. Intentionally devoid of all marks of individuality was his verdict. Nothing here to help any
detective. Choice or necessity? Newman was a conundrum.</p>

<p>A chat in the kitchen told Pointer that Mr. and Mrs. Clifford
were considered a most devoted couple by their servants, and that
the latter were not in the least surprised at only one more of
their master's many short disappearances.</p>

<p>"It's just his way," one maid said airily. "He goes off like
that all of a sudden, when he gets fed up with writing. Mr.
Trimble here he says that Mr. Clifford goes to find out more to
write about, but is that likely?"</p>

<p>A few questions about last night, when the gas man thought
that he had seen Mr. and Mrs. Clifford at a restaurant in company
with Sir Edward Clifford, told Pointer that the dinner at
Thornbush, where Edward Clifford and Maud Gillingham had been the
only guests, had been a cheery meal; that the two guests had each
left immediately after the meal, and that as far as the servants
went, Mr. Clifford had not been seen after the butler took him in
a glass of iced barley water about ten. Mr. Clifford had told him
that "that was all"&mdash;his usual words of dismissal for the
night. Back on his Yard-bound 'bus, Pointer thought over the
household&mdash; over Julian Clifford, who had gone to Astra's to
have his fortune told, as he might have gone to a gipsy.</p>

<p>He had gone recently. And he had asked the palmist to tell him
if danger was marked in his hands. A strange question from a man
who apparently within the month had passed to where that word has
no more meaning.</p>

<p>Yet if it was his body that Pointer had seen, as the Chief
Inspector believed that it was, he had not investigated that
flat. He did not seem to have noticed the fastened back lock of
that door. It looked as though he had had a definite idea of
where the danger lay, and did not expect it to meet him
elsewhere.</p>

<p>What was the best course now? Open or secret?</p>

<p>As a rule, an inquirer in a murder benefited by the rare
chance of the murderer thinking his crime was still undetected.
But here? Dared Pointer let him think himself safe? If that cut-off head was cut off with the idea of blocking the investigation,
then it and those carefully laid trails by the Basque anarchist
looked, Pointer believed, as though something was brewing which
the knowledge of Clifford's death would spoil. Some business
seemed to be on hand which must stop if it were known who it was
that, on this last night, had been lured to a strange address,
there murdered, and stripped and beheaded. They might not all
belong together&mdash;the murder, the beheading, the stripping.
But some vital necessity must have ruled to make a man risk any,
or all, of them. No one goes to such terrible lengths unless
driven. What was it which necessitated, perhaps, the killing of
Julian Clifford, but certainly the remaining unknown of the fact
that it was he who had been killed?</p>

<p>Back at Scotland Yard, he arranged for a couple of his men to
be installed in a road-mender's hut just outside
Thornbush&mdash;men who understood tapping a telephone wire. They
were instructed to do as little damage as possible with the
maximum amount of effect. The point was that one or other was to
be permanently on guard. And a message was sent to the police
stations concerned which would be passed on at once to every
constable on his beat, that any oddity noticed at the houses
where lived Sir Edward Clifford, Mrs. Orr, Arnold Haslar, and
Julian Clifford was to be at once reported directly to the Chief
Inspector at New Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Then he went swiftly to the Assistant Commissioner's rooms.
Tindall, to whom he had telephoned, was just entering. Without a
word, Pointer laid before the two men a sheet of paper with some
red finger-prints on it. He had obtained them by dropping
collodium in thin films over the fingerprints on a metal tube of
tooth-paste in Clifford's dressing-room, then carefully peeling
them off one by one when set, leaving them awhile in a red-tinted
hardening solution, and finally pressing each carefully out on to
unglazed paper.</p>

<p>"You agree that they're the same as these?" he asked. "These"
were prints taken from the hands of the dead man, and enlarged on
squared paper.</p>

<p>"They're identical," Tindall agreed, after very carefully
comparing the two. Major Pelham said the same, and the Assistant
Commissioner was an authority on finger-prints.</p>

<p>"How on earth&mdash;where&mdash;whose?" Tindall was all but
inarticulate.</p>

<p>"I got these red prints from marks on Mr. Julian Clifford's
tube of tooth paste. Equally clear are those there taken off a
lamp switch beside his bed. The tube of tooth-paste I have with
me. And here's some of Mr. Clifford's manuscript paper. It's
esparto grass paper. In other words I'm sorry to say that the
murdered man in Heath Mansions is Mr. Julian Clifford the well-known author." Pointer detailed the somewhat odd steps of his
investigations.</p>

<p>"Sir Edward's brother!" Tindall murmured, as one half
stupefied. There was a long silence. Tindall strode to the window
and back. Then he wheeled.</p>

<p>"These prints, of course, absolutely settle the question. So
Etcheverrey was the killer this time, and not the killed! But why
should Etcheverrey kill Julian Clifford? What took Clifford into
that most dangerous man's inner circle? However, let me
congratulate you, Chief Inspector. This was good work.
Marvellously good. Considering how you at the Yard are so bound
by red tape. You need a royal warrant or an Act of Parliament
before you dare step an inch off the beaten track. With us, of
course, it's different. But frankly, I can't think how you get
the results that you do."</p>

<p>"We have to rely more on routine," Pointer agreed sadly, and
let it go at that, while Major Pelham wrestled with a refractory
cough.</p>

<p>Tindall bent over the finger-prints again.</p>

<p>"And to think of a Scotland Yard man going to a palmist!" he
all but chuckled.</p>

<p>"Astra isn't what's generally meant by that word, or we
wouldn't let her alone as we do," the Assistant Commissioner
reminded him. "She's not a fortune-teller."</p>

<p>"It was a most amazing piece of luck that she had photographed
Clifford's hands," Tindall said almost grudgingly. Pointer
nodded. It was.</p>

<p>"It wasn't good luck that made the Chief Inspector go to her,"
Pelham pointed out.</p>

<p>"What would you have done if she'd never seen Clifford?" the
Foreign Office man asked with real curiosity.</p>

<p>"I think she might have been as good at placing him, or his
interests, as she was with mine. I tried her with my own hands
first. If so, what with her suggestions, and the clue furnished
by his fingernails, I think we should have run him to earth in
time."</p>

<p>"I wish you were wrong for once," Tindall pushed the sheets of
prints away. He spoke with genuine emotion. "Quite apart from my
having been a little off the true, I wish with all my heart that
you were wrong. Why, his coming novel is said to be one of the
finest things even Julian Clifford has ever done! It's not
finished yet. I must be the one to break the news to Sir Edward,
of course." Suddenly he straightened. "I wonder! Is <i>he</i> the
link between Julian Clifford and the Basque? There's no man
keener on having Etcheverrey caught than our Chief. And there is
a great resemblance between the brothers. But first of all, I
must hurry to the French Embassy." He glanced at his watch. "Four
o'clock. I've been there until now. Etcheverrey&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pelham stopped him.</p>

<p>"Just a moment, Tindall. We must lay this before the
Commissioner. I've told him the facts as far as they went."</p>

<p>He took the two into another room. The prints were laid before
an elderly, shrewd-faced man with singularly steady, piercing
blue eyes.</p>

<p>"You think, Tindall, that Julian Clifford may have been killed
because of Sir Edward's inquiries, or because the younger was
mistaken for the elder brother?" General Brownlow asked
finally.</p>

<p>"I can see no other possible link. No other gap to cross such
a bridge as that between a Basque revolutionary and Julian
Clifford."</p>

<p>Tindall looked at Pointer. All three looked at Pointer, who
looked at his shoe-tips.</p>

<p>A silence fell on the room. Then General Brownlow spoke.</p>

<p>"I don't for a moment doubt your result, Chief Inspector. None
of us do, or can. But it rests for identification of the body
only on palm and finger-prints. Juries and coroners don't like
that kind of evidence. We must go step by step. I think we must
keep back from the public our belief, our certainty rather, that
the murdered man is Julian Clifford until we get the usual proof.
I mean until we get the actual head. As to the family&mdash;that
must, of course, depend on what Sir Edward says; or on the course
of events."</p>

<p>Again there fell a silence.</p>

<p>"'We count on you to put people off. Miles off,'" Pelham
murmured suddenly. Pointer had given every fact, as known to him
so far, with the most meticulous care. It was only his
conclusions that he had kept to himself. "That's a most
extraordinary letter under the circumstances!"</p>

<p>"I don't know about Mrs. Orr, but Mrs. Clifford is absolutely
incapable of murder," General Brownlow said firmly, "or of being
connected with a crime of any kind. I've known her off and on
since she was a child. Nor is there the slightest motive here.
She has a life interest under her father's will that must bring
her in a clear thousand a year. A thousand to Mrs. Clifford is
like five thousand to most people. More than ample for her needs.
You might as well suspect Sir Edward of having had a hand in
Julian Clifford's horrible end."</p>

<p>And with that the conference broke up.</p>

<p>Pointer's next objective was the Hampstead branch of the St.
James Bank. Before leaving Scotland Yard a few inquiries over the
telephone at all the branches near Thornbush had told him that
Mr. Clifford had a town account there. And Pointer was always
interested in the banking account of men who died suddenly, let
alone of men who were murdered.</p>

<p>The reason for that cut-off head might lie quite near home.
Clifford was not a racing man, or Pointer would have thought of a
horse. But was there any large cheque outstanding of his which
his death, if known of, would have invalidated, or at least held
up?</p>

<p>In that case, since Julian Clifford was killed last night, any
such cheque would have been presented to-day as soon as the banks
opened. This did not oust Etcheverrey from his place in the heart
of the mystery surrounding the death of the great writer, but
Pointer believed that mystery to be complex, not single.</p>

<p>Pointer had his private doubts as to whether it was quite fair
to the bank manager to let him cash a dead man's cheques, for
others might be presented, innocently or not. But the Chief
Commissioner had decided that nothing should be done for the
present which would let the world at large know that England's
foremost author was dead. Pointer rather deprecated that
decision, but it had been made. Though by now it was past banking
hours, a telephone message to the manager had found him still on
the premises, and Pointer was shown in at once on his arrival.
Detective Inspectors do not ask for appointments every day.</p>

<p>"Do you mind if my chauffeur waits outside in the passage?"
Pointer asked, as he shook hands. There was only the one
door.</p>

<p>The manager was too full of anxiety to have any room for
objections.</p>

<p>"A man's body has just been discovered," Pointer began, "in
circumstances that suggest foul play. He was an acquaintance of
Mr. Julian Clifford's. We have discovered some notes among his
papers which make us think that he had in his possession a large
sum of money of Mr. Clifford's. That he was only just in
possession of it. A business venture pure and simple, but on a
large scale. Mr. Julian Clifford is out at his home. Now this is
the point. Was any large sum paid out very recently by Mr.
Clifford? We think the payment of which we're speaking was
originally by cheque, and probably was presented to you early
this morning as soon as the bank opened."</p>

<p>The manager reflected a moment. He had started at the last
words.</p>

<p>"It's in strictest confidence, of course?" he asked.</p>

<p>Pointer had to tell him that as the sum might possibly be the
motive for an attempt at murder, it was not possible for him to
promise secrecy.</p>

<p>The manager reflected a little longer.</p>

<p>"You say Mr. Clifford's away from home?"</p>

<p>"His family tell me he's off on one of those expeditions of
his when he leaves no address. Getting up facts for his next
book," Pointer said promptly.</p>

<p>More meditation on the part of the manager.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm in rather a difficult position," he murmured. "Why
don't you get into touch with Sir Edward Clifford?"</p>

<p>"He's out of town. Also un-get-at-able."</p>

<p>"A depositor&mdash;and such a large depositor as Mr. Julian
Clifford," murmured the manager uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Still&mdash;murder, you know!" Pointer threw in. And the
manager made up his mind.</p>

<p>"Well, a very large cheque of Mr. Clifford's was presented
early this morning," he said slowly.</p>

<p>Pointer nodded. "For how much?"</p>

<p>"Seventy thousand pounds."</p>

<p>Having said that much, the manager made up his mind to be
quite frank.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clifford had spoken to us of that cheque. About a month
ago he had us make the necessary arrangements to pay a hundred
thousand into his current account. He told me that he would draw
on it by a very large cheque, and that he wished the cheque
cashed without any further formalities or delay."</p>

<p>Pointer nodded.</p>

<p>"This morning, as soon as we opened, Mrs. Clifford presented a
cheque of Mr. Clifford's drawn to a Mr. Selfe for seventy
thousand pounds. It was duly endorsed, and of course we cashed it
at once. That is the only large sum which had been paid out of
Mr. Clifford's account lately."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford. I see. Was she alone?"</p>

<p>"No. A lady was with her in her car. I happened to be coming
in at the moment the car drew up."</p>

<p>"Did you recognise whoever was with her?"</p>

<p>"It was Mrs. Orr."</p>

<p>"You know her?"</p>

<p>The manager hesitated again. "No," he said finally, "but
seeing it's you, I don't mind passing on a bit of gossip. My son
Gerald is a barrister. Junior to Mr. Robinson. He tells me that
they're briefed in a case coming on shortly. Smart society
divorce. It's to be heard as soon as the courts open. Mrs. Orr is
cited in it by name. No chance of a defence. The wife intends to
get her knife into her. Gerald showed me some photographs of Mrs.
Orr. That's how I recognised her at once. Odd companion for Mrs.
Julian Clifford."</p>

<p>"May I see it? A Selfe is a sort of partner of this man who
was shot."</p>

<p>"I see. You think&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It's too early to think yet," Pointer returned, as though
that were with him always the last resort. "But of course I must
have a look at it. If only in the way of routine."</p>

<p>He was shown the cheque. It seemed in perfect order. It was
made out to R. Selfe, Esq., and endorsed R. Selfe. The date was
last Thursday.</p>

<p>"I must ask you to let me have this for an hour or so."</p>

<p>The manager agreed, provided that it be returned next day.</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk over the finding of this body more than
I can help with Mrs. Clifford. It's a harrowing subject,
especially if we're wrong, and this money has nothing to do with
our case. How did she take the money?"</p>

<p>"In notes of a hundred pounds. Here is the list of the
numbers. Mr. Clifford had requested that the money should be held
ready for him in just that way. They were handed to Mrs. Clifford
in seven packages of a hundred notes. The cashier asked, of
course, if she shouldn't send it out to her car by our
commissionaire, or lend her the man's services, but she declined
both suggestions."</p>

<p>Pointer thanked him and left. He had much to think over. A
cheque for a fortune...an uncrossed cheque...a cheque to R.
Selfe...and cashed by Mrs. Clifford as soon after her husband's
death as it could be presented...with Mrs. Orr waiting in the car
outside...a cheque which Julian Clifford had expected to be
presented, and which he wished paid without any trouble being
made to the person who should present it.</p>

<p>Not a simple case this...complex...very.</p>

<p>Pointer had the cheque photographed, and the photograph
enlarged. Then he saw what he expected to see. The final <i>e</i>
was not continuous with the <i>f</i> of <i>Self</i>, but had been
carefully added. So carefully, so exactly, that only the enlarged
photograph showed the break and slight overlapping of the
strokes. The endorsement on the back presented no breaks. There
<i>Selfe</i> was one word, written swiftly and with a dash. Under
the camera too the initial <i>R</i> on the face of the cheque
showed a certain waviness of line due to slow and careful
writing...so did the <i>Esq.</i> On the back the initial was
swiftly penned. In other words, the camera showed that, as
Pointer had suspected, the cheque, originally made out by Julian
Clifford&mdash;for the signature was his without a doubt, hastily
and carelessly written&mdash;had been to <i>Self</i>...to Julian
Clifford. Some one into whose hands it had fallen, had
ingeniously altered it to a not uncommon family name. And the
alterations had apparently been made with Julian Clifford's own
pen and ink. There was a little peculiarity about the nib used
which showed throughout.</p>

<p>Pointer docketed these new and most important facts, then he
reached for the telephone. He mentioned to Sir Edward's valet
that it was "Mr. Marbury of the Home Office" who was
speaking.</p>

<p>"I understood that Sir Edward left yesterday evening to join a
commission at Chequers on the Sudan Cotton Areas, but I find he
hasn't been there. Do you know where I can reach him over the
telephone at once?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say, sir, that there is no telephone at Sir
Edward's cottage at Weybridge, where he is spending the day."</p>

<p>"His cottage"&mdash;Marbury seemed perplexed&mdash;"are you
sure? When did he leave town?"</p>

<p>"Sir Edward left about nine yesterday evening, sir. He changed
into tweeds, and took nothing down with him but a gun and
cartridges. That always means the cottage, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you know which gun, and what number cartridges?" Pointer
asked in the sudden tone of a man who has a clue.</p>

<p>"He took his old 12-bore gun, sir, and a bag of Numbers 4 and
6 cartridges."</p>

<p>"Did he drive down himself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, that certainly seems to settle it," murmured Marbury.
"When do you expect him back?"</p>

<p>"In time for dinner, sir. Eight o'clock."</p>

<p>Marbury rang off, after thanking the man. It was now just
after five. A wire would be useless. Sir Edward Clifford,
Julian's only brother, had taken a gun and a bag of cartridges
away with him yesterday about nine o'clock...easily identifiable
shots in some circumstances...under a loose ulster a gun could be
strapped to the body with comparative ease, if a man drove his
own car...</p>

<p>Pointer hastily got into his gas-man make-up again, looked
around for his tool bag that contained other things beside tools,
pushed his cap a little farther on one side, touched it to a
sergeant coming in at the main entrance, and swung himself on
board a Hampstead bus.</p>

<p>The Haslar's house was a bare five minutes' drive from that of
Julian Clifford. When the latter had married Catherine Haslar,
Sir William Haslar had built the two houses, and given the larger
as a present to his new son-in-law.</p>

<p>An inquiry of the gas company had told Pointer that on the
principle of the shoemaker's barefoot children, the Haslars had
gas fires in all their rooms.</p>

<p>Bag on shoulder he lounged up to the basement door.</p>

<p>The butler was appealed to. "Certainly not!" he announced.
"You can't go making a noise just now. There's illness in the
house."</p>

<p>"Well, of course, sir, if you want to be all blown up by a
blocked pipe, carry on!" The man spoke nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"You won't make any noise?" The butler was no keener on
explosions than are most people.</p>

<p>"Not so much as a mouse nibbling cheese." Pointer came in and
looked about him. He chatted as he sorted out his pliers. Chatted
of a gas explosion farther down early this morning which he was
surprised to learn had not brought in any complaints from Mr.
Haslar.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, of course if he came in abaht four in the morning,
he couldn't have heard it. It was at three." Then he went on to
tell of Mr. Clifford's house, where he had just been. Mr.
Clifford had lost his umbrella. One of the servants at Thornbush
had said in Pointer's hearing that he must have left it at Mr.
Haslar's house last evening...an insinuation which was loftily
repudiated by Wilkins. Mr. Clifford had not been to the house for
a month past.</p>

<p>Pointer, who wore the full uniform of the gas company, was
allowed to roam the house by himself. He went first of all to
Arnold Haslar's bedroom. There he knelt for the briefest of
seconds by the hearth, staring at the bed where lay a young man
with his eyes closed. Haslar looked very white. But was he really
ill or only keeping out of the way? On the mantelpiece was a
much-used New Comfort pipe. In a rubber-lined pocket of a
waistcoat hanging in the dressing-room was some tobacco of the
kind which the head porter at Heath Mansions had noticed was
smoked by Mr. Tourcoin last Friday evening.</p>

<p>Pointer tiptoed to the wardrobe and opened it noiselessly. The
man on the bed had not seemed to pay the slightest attention. But
he suddenly turned over and barked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What the devil are you doing with my clothes?"</p>

<p>"Gas smell, sir," Pointer said, immediately coming up to the
bed and taking a good look at the man in it. "There's a gas leak
somewhere. We can't locate it. But if it leaked last night say,
and the wardrobe was open, you'd smell it when it was suddenly
opened, and think something was wrong again. It smells pretty
strong."</p>

<p>He put his head into the wardrobe and sniffed several times.
There was an ulster, or some coat of similar texture, hanging on
the last hanger. Pointer put out his hand as though to steady
himself, and sniffed again. The last coat was an orange and brown
check tweed. Without an apparent glance at it, he shut the door
and sniffed in a farther corner of the room, working down to the
floor in a most convincing way.</p>

<p>Haslar seemed to fall into a heavy slumber. Pointer stood a
moment photographing the face on his mind. He noted the big
frame, the masterful, rather overbearing jaw, the eyebrows
meeting over the bold nose&mdash;secretive eyebrows
these&mdash;and the mouth firm yet passionate. Then he melted
from the room and slipped downstairs to the ground floor. Here he
found a telephone in what was evidently Haslar's own particular
room. One end of the large library shut off by folding doors from
the book part proper.</p>

<p>Pointer asked for a number that would have meant nothing to a
listener. But it was the secret number used by the officers of
New Scotland Yard, and insured instant connection and
precedence.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector murmured a few short sentences. Decoded
they meant that one of his men, got up as directed, was to ask
the "watcher" outside Haslar's house for a card. It would be one
of Arnold Haslar's own cards, that Pointer had just taken from a
drawer in the writing table. It was to be used according to
instructions.</p>

<p>Pointer wanted that brown and orange ulster at once. If Haslar
continued to sleep well, it might be at the Yard by six
o'clock.</p>

<p>Then he took up his own work of going swiftly but carefully
over the house.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5">CHAPTER 5</a></h2>

<p class="first">WHILE the Chief Inspector was roaming Arnold
Haslar's house, Julian Clifford's new librarian and Diana had
been looking at some rare books at Sotheby's. Straight was
expressing his disappointment at Julian Clifford's absence.</p>

<p>"He has left me neither instructions nor a free hand. Hobbs is
too busy to question Mr. Clifford's preferences. He certainly is
a worker! And Newman, apart from your warnings, dislikes me.
Jealousy, I suppose. No man likes to be supplanted."</p>

<p>"Supplanted? Newman?" There was joy in Diana's tone. She had
been looking rather bored by Straight's little outburst.</p>

<p>"So Mr. Clifford hinted in our after-dinner talk last night.
He's thinking of letting Newman go. But that's in strictest
confidence. What concerns me at the moment far more is when he is
coming back. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>A passing newsboy waved his papers at them.</p>

<p>"French anarchist killed in Hampstead flat! Headless man in
Hampstead!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Hampstead?" Straight bought two papers.</p>

<p>"Why it's Heath Mansions! The building near us!" Diana said,
aghast as she caught sight of a photograph on the front page.
Straight said nothing. He was reading. Suddenly Diana gave a low
cry. She went livid.</p>

<p>"Here! you're ill!" Dick said solicitously.</p>

<p>"A taxi," she murmured. "I'm all right. Don't come with
me."</p>

<p>"Certainly I'm coming with you." He signalled to a taxi, gave
the man her home address, and jumped in beside her. But Diana
sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"No! I want to be alone. I must be alone." She spoke in a
strange, wild voice. She looked around for another taxi. There
was none.</p>

<p>"Dick, I want to be alone. You can't come with me." She seemed
unable to find other words.</p>

<p>"Sorry to force my society on you," he said quietly, "but I'm
coming. You've had a shock."</p>

<p>Diana looked at him with dilated pupils. Her eyes suddenly
looked enormous in her pale face.</p>

<p>"You must keep out of this, Dick," she said again in the same
firm tone. "You of all men. I know how you would hate to be mixed
up in anything disagreeable."</p>

<p>"No more than the next fellow," he assured her. "And when
you're in trouble, you don't suppose blows would drive me from
you, do you? What frightened you in that paper?"</p>

<p>"You're quick," she said in a low tone; "I'm glad no one else
was with me. Dick, something awful has happened. I knew evil was
bound to come of&mdash;I must go home at once. I mug see
Arnold&mdash;" She pulled herself up.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Dick reminded her. "What was it the doctor said? He
must have no shocks. So Arnold being out of court, suppose you
face the fact that you're driven to turn to me?"</p>

<p>Diana passed a hand across her eyes. She shivered.</p>

<p>"Murdered like that! Decoyed, and then butchered!" she said
under her breath. "Give me the paper again!" She took it from him
hurriedly, and read as though every unnoticed punctuation mark
might make a difference.</p>

<p>Straight, too, dipped into his sheet. There was enough and to
spare to hold his attention in the columns. When he came to the
description of the man who had taken the flat, he gave a start.
The house agent had remembered something more than he had told
the police. He had now remembered and described to a reporter an
unusual ring which the man had been wearing on the little finger
of his right hand&mdash;a black opal very highly rounded. Two
gold snakes were coiled about it, their coils making the ring,
their heads apparently holding the stone in place between them as
they nearly met across it. The serpents were carved in great
detail and in the round.</p>

<p>At first the house agent, though he had remembered the ring,
had not placed the man who had worn it. He was now sure that it
had been on the hand of the mysterious Tourcoin. His clerk, too,
remembered it, as well as the check ulster which the man had
worn.</p>

<p>Straight felt Diana sag in the corner beside him as she came
to the description of the ring and the overcoat.</p>

<p>"We both know a ring like that, but has Arnold such an ulster
by any chance?"</p>

<p>"A ring like that...Such an ulster...!" she repeated under her
breath. "It is Arnold's ring and ulster that are described here.
As to the ulster&mdash;." She drew in her breath sharply, with a
shudder.</p>

<p>"It's a damnable business," Straight said, after a moment's
deep thought. "All we can do is to keep our own counsel&mdash;as
long as we can," he added grimly. "What about the name? The name
of Tourcoin?"</p>

<p>"Some one in a French town of that name, or Belgian, I don't
know which, asked him to advise them about some new electrical
plant not long ago. The name would still be fresh in his
mind."</p>

<p>"But why in the world should Arnold have given a false name
when looking over the flat? What possible connection is there
between him and a Basque communist?" he asked, looking
bewildered.</p>

<p>Diana sprang to her feet, rocking with the speed of the
taxi.</p>

<p>"I can't stand it! I can't stand it!" She turned a distorted
face on Dick. "There's another taxi!" She waved to it. "I can't
endure to hear it talked about. To speak of it!" She motioned
again. But the cab had it's flag up and passed on. Diana sank
back into her seat as though her legs gave under her. Straight
bit his lip. The incident showed him how little he counted with
her in Diana's inner life. "You saw him yourself this morning
coming out of the place&mdash;Heath Mansions," woman-like Diana
could talk of nothing else. "Others may have seen him too!"</p>

<p>Straight looked at her warningly. "Forget that, Diana! I have&mdash;completely!" A newspaper boy with a later edition than the one which they had seen ran past. Straight got a copy.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">WHO WAS THE MAN WHO TOOK THE
FLAT?</span>" was now the heading. Diana and Straight, heads
together, scanned it. The description, pieced together by an able
reporter, fitted Arnold Haslar with appalling closeness.</p>

<p>Neither spoke until they turned into Arnold's garden. Newman,
Clifford's secretary, was just being admitted. Diana gave a
sudden cry, a cry of sheerest terror, and clutched Dick's arm
with fingers that hurt. Her hands were colder than he had
imagined living hands could be. He thought that she had fainted.
Her face with its eyes closed looked so white. But in a second
the lids lifted. She squared her shoulders as the cab stopped.
She seemed to pull herself together with a great effort. She
looked more like sinking to the ground where she stood than
walking up the steps, but she went forward very steadily,
refusing help. Wilkins came out hurriedly. "Are you ill, Miss
Diana? Let me call Alice. Let me assist you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paid no attention to him. Newman had gone on into the
hall.</p>

<p>"Mr. Newman?" she asked quickly, imperiously.</p>

<p>"Mr. Newman is here, Miss Diana. He insists on being allowed
up to see Mr. Haslar for a moment. I told him that the doctor's
orders were to the contrary." Wilkins had obviously not yet heard
of the murder, nor of the man with the black opal ring and the
check ulster.</p>

<p>Diana stepped in swiftly, and laid a hand on the newel post.
She still looked as though she needed its support.</p>

<p>Newman turned at her entrance; he was just mounting the
stairs. He, too, was very pale. The eyes were far back in their
sockets, but they were still as unreadable as ever. He and Diana
faced each other in absolute silence for a long minute.</p>

<p>"I didn't expect to see you," she said in an oddly shaken
voice.</p>

<p>"I'd like to go up and speak to Arnold for a moment," was his
only reply.</p>

<p>"No one can see him," Diana said in a firmer voice. Newman
seemed to hesitate.</p>

<p>"He's feverish, I understand. Is he light-headed?" he asked in
a lower tone, though Wilkins had already gone on down the
hall.</p>

<p>Diana did not reply at once. Then she asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why should he be? You've seen the evening papers?"</p>

<p>Newman nodded.</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better talk in here?" He glanced towards a
room.</p>

<p>Diana' did not seem to hear him. She was speaking in a very
low, very stony voice.</p>

<p>"You saw about the murder in Heath Mansions?" she asked
again.</p>

<p>Once more he nodded.</p>

<p>"Did you read the description of the ulster the man was
wearing? Of the ring?"</p>

<p>"I read them. Yes." Newman was standing with his head bent.
His eyes only were raised and were fastened on Diana. As before,
Straight could make nothing of their expression. Was it inimical
or merely intentionally blank? Then Straight looked at Diana.
Never would he have believed her face capable of showing such
passion. The girl seemed to be swept by a fury&mdash;a fury that
was shaking her where she stood&mdash;a fury which was in spate
but which she was damming back.</p>

<p>"Why?" Newman asked gravely.</p>

<p>"Because Arnold has a coat and ring exactly like them."
Straight frowned. Women were the most imprudent of beings.</p>

<p>"Because coats and rings can be borrowed, Mr. Newman."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;?" Newman still spoke very quietly, rather
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"That my brother had no interest in murdering anybody. But
that might not be true of&mdash;Sanz Etcheverrey." She spoke the
words in a low, tense whisper.</p>

<p>"The man who was killed?"</p>

<p>"No. <i>Not</i> the man who was killed."</p>

<p>Straight looked quickly from Diana to Newman, and back to
Diana. What did this scene mean? Newman did not glance at her
now. He was looking meditatively at the black and white marble
squares of the hall.</p>

<p>Diana swept past him. Her brother's valet came down the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Mr. Haslar's asleep, miss. He's been asleep nearly all
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Good." Diana hesitated. Straight took a step forward. Could
he slip up and get that ulster? He had looked in the cloakroom
just now, and it was not there.</p>

<p>"The tailor sent a man for an overcoat of Mr. Haslar's a
little while ago, miss. I got it out without waking him," the man
continued. "He had a card of Mr. Haslar's, saying that his new
check motor coat was to be handed to the bearer, miss. I did
quite right, I hope? I didn't wake Mr. Haslar," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Quite right, Smith," Diana said rather faintly. She turned
suddenly and came up to Newman, who was moving towards the
door.</p>

<p>"A moment! I want to speak to you outside."</p>

<p>When they were clear of the steps she said in a low, bitter
voice, "I think it only fair to warn you that I may have to tell
all I know to the police."</p>

<p>"Warn me?" Newman asked, as though not understanding her.</p>

<p>"Arnold may have gone to that flat or you may have gone in his
things," she went on, "but I am convinced that in some way you
are mixed up in the affair. I heard you tell Arnold only last
week that that flat was to let. If Arnold gets drawn into the
crime I shall speak out. Please don't go on with the farce of
having lost your memory." She looked at him with eyes that seemed
to scorch what they looked at.</p>

<p>He looked bewildered. "Farce? I only wish it were," he said
heavily.</p>

<p>"You have not lost it," she repeated firmly "I've known it all
along."</p>

<p>Now he gave her a measuring look. The look that a fencer gives
another when he steps forward, foil in hand.</p>

<p>"Have you told Mr. Straight as much? Not yet? I see. Not
yet."</p>

<p>He nodded thoughtfully; almost, Diana felt, as though she, and
what she was saying, had retreated into the background of his
thought. Almost she could imagine that he was hearing some other
voice speak, and was listening to it rather than to her. The
feeling chilled her.</p>

<p>Turning towards her, he made a gesture almost of
dismissal.</p>

<p>"Do what you feel you must do," he said coldly, and raising
his hat, walked on past her.</p>

<p>For a second she stood with clenched hands, then she turned
back to the house. She went into the room where Straight stood
waiting for her. It occurred to Diana for the first time, that
possibly she had not appreciated Dick at his proper value. There
was a certain measured, and measuring quality about the young man
which had a little amused her, and a little chilled her, out in
Australia. Yet she felt suddenly very glad that he was in
England, and at Thornbush just now. Dick was never spectacular,
but she felt, a little self-reproachfully, that his was the kind
of character to which one turns in moments of trouble. If only he
were not at other times something so perilously approaching a
prig!</p>

<p>He closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>"What in the world?" he began. She raised her hand.</p>

<p>"That ulster has gone&mdash;taken&mdash;fetched! But by whom?"
There was terror in her face now.</p>

<p>"We'll test it. Who's your brother's tailor? Rivers of Saville
Row?"</p>

<p>He rang up, and after a moment dropped the receiver back.</p>

<p>"No one was sent from there. But, of course, the fact that
your brother gave a card looks as though it might have been some
local presser...some regular man he employs."</p>

<p>"Dick, do you think it could have been Newman whom you mistook
for my brother this morning, coming out of Heath Mansions?"</p>

<p>Dick did not answer for a moment, then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why should it be Newman, Di?"</p>

<p>Now it was her turn not to reply.</p>

<p>"Why did you connect him with this dead anarchist?" he asked
again.</p>

<p>She shook her head. Her eyes were closed. He had never
expected to see Diana look so broken.</p>

<p>"I'm only groping," she said faintly.</p>

<p>"What do you know of your uncle's secretary that makes you
link him with this Etcheverrey murder?" he persisted. "You ought
to tell me, Di. If there's any chance of helping Arnold out of
this unholy mess it will be that you and I pull together."</p>

<p>"I can't tell you, Dick," she said, after another long moment.
"I didn't mean to say as much as I did before a third person. But
it welled up. Nothing will make Mr. Newman speak out. Nothing!
He's like some creature hiding in his lair. He knows that he's
safe there, and won't come into the open."</p>

<p>A passion of hate sounded in Diana's voice. Straight gave her
a very searching, not over-pleased look. No man cares to hear the
woman whom he hopes to marry speak like that of another. It takes
too much to explain it. Diana walked to the window and stood
drawing a deep breath.</p>

<p>"If things get worse, if suspicion falls on Arnold, I must go
to the police and tell them&mdash;what I know. But not to you,
Dick&mdash; not yet. If that's why Newman has seemed so strangely
fond of Arnold&mdash;" she stood biting her lip and quivering
afresh against the sharp light of the window.</p>

<p>"You won't tell me what the secret is between you and him,
then?" There was an edge to his voice.</p>

<p>She did not reply. His face flushed.</p>

<p>"I had hoped that I could be of some use to you and Arnold,
Di. I am sorry that I overrated your confidence in me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick"&mdash;she held out a quivering hand&mdash;"be
generous!"</p>

<p>He took it&mdash;a shade stiffly.</p>

<p>"Let me warn you for both your sakes, to think over every step
before you take it. In this affair, you can't accuse Newman
without involving Arnold. At least, I'm afraid so. The whole
affair is really too grave." He went on in a kinder tone, "You
see, it was Arnold whom I saw slipping out of what I now know is
Heath Mansions this morning. And"&mdash;again he hesitated, but
the danger of a misunderstanding on her part was too
real&mdash;"and the doctor thought he had just had a terrible
shock, remember. What about the servants? Are they to be
trusted?"</p>

<p>"The butler has been with us since father's days. So has the
housekeeper. I think they'd stop any of the servants chattering.
But of course it's bound to leak out sooner or later. So many
people have seen that ring."</p>

<p>She seemed about to leave him, but he detained her.</p>

<p>"Diana," Dick's eyes were very gentle, "I repeat that I think
you ought to tell me what you know about Newman. Evidently you
know something very important, very much to the point, in this
awful affair."</p>

<p>She looked irresolutely at him. Even though she felt sure that
Richard Straight was a good man to go to for advice, Diana was
terrified of a false step, for the waters were deep. Yet she knew
that the very things in his character which kept her from being
in love with him, as she thought, his caution, his
imperturbability, a certain coldness in his judgment of his
fellow men could be an advantage at times&mdash;at such a time as
now, for instance.</p>

<p>"I must think things over first," she said finally.</p>

<p>He made a gesture of "as you please."</p>

<p>"But be careful!" he warned.</p>

<p>When she left him Richard Straight paced the room. Had it
merely been Diana who had connected Arnold and that flat, all
would have been well. She might have turned to him, and Dick
would have had a magnificent chance of winning her enduring love
by standing between her brother and the result of whatever it was
that he had done.</p>

<p>He had been proud to marry Diana Haslar as things were. But
how long would it take for things to change? It seemed a far cry
from Haslar to a Basque anarchist, but that brown and orange
check ulster, that snake ring, might yet bring the whole police
pack out in full cry after their owner. So Straight feared. It
was an intolerable thought, that because Arnold Haslar should
have been such an utter fool as to wear them when taking the
flat, because he had been such an utter idiot, Diana was to be
mixed up in the business, if it ever came out. Why, he too,
Richard Straight, might yet be dragged, through them, into the
affair.</p>

<p>This idea came like a blow to him. He was as good as engaged
to Haslar's sister. He had arrived but a few hours before the
crime had been committed. The police said that the man in the
flat had been murdered last night. He, Dick, had no alibi for
last night. He could tell people that he had been fast asleep
from about ten till he was roused next morning, but would they
believe it?</p>

<p>Dick did not share Diana's suspicion that possibly it was
Newman who had worn her brother's things and taken the flat. Yet
it was maddening to think that if only Diana would tell him the
whole of what she evidently knew or suspected, about her uncle's
secretary, it might be sufficient to free Arnold from all but the
blame of a foolish fancy for taking flats under assumed
names.</p>

<p>Diana came back into the room.</p>

<p>"Arnold's still asleep. I didn't wake him but I took his ring
out of the drawer where he keeps it, and now I'm going to
Thornbush. I must speak to Newman again. What's that, Wilkins?
Can a gas man come into the room for a moment? Certainly."</p>

<p>They passed a tall, lanky figure with a shock of dark-red hair
as they went out. His bag was in their way, so that there was a
second's delay as he moved it more hastily than tidily, for half
the tools spilled out, and in his very civility to pick them up
Pointer blocked the passage still more, and incidentally got two
very good photographs. Straight merely looked very worried, very
perplexed, and thoughtful, but Diana's face was a travesty of her
usual one. Gone was that effect of radiant youth, gone the cool
aloofness of her glance. She had recovered a measure of
composure, but in her eyes was something desperate, frightened,
very nearly cowed. Neither Dick nor Diana spoke on the way to
Thornbush, where Diana learnt that Newman had not yet returned.
Diana stood a moment thinking deeply, then went on to her own
room with a heavy, dragging step. Dick decided that the best
thing for him to do would be to try and get some work done.</p>

<p>Outside, a couple of boys&mdash;they looked about
fourteen&mdash;were hunting through the garden. "Sir Raymond
Tirrell's nephews," so they had explained to Trimble, had lost a
pet dormouse. The little chap, taken for an airing into the
garden, had developed an unexpected sprightliness. The tips of
his ears had last been seen disappearing through Mr. Julian
Clifford's hedge. Might they search the garden? They would be
careful of the beds. Sir Raymond was Mr. Clifford's nearest
neighbour, so Trimble wished them good luck, and volunteered to
keep the cat shut up. The lads must have been very fond of that
dormouse. Inch by inch the garden was searched. Two spots where
flowers had recently been changed were noted, and reported later
on to the two road-menders outside. The boys went off finally
with their recaptured pet, so they told a servant.</p>

<p>Pointer meanwhile was looking through some locked drawers in
Haslar's study. They yielded nothing of interest to him except
some letters of Mrs. Orr's.</p>

<p>Evidently there had been, if there was not now, an engagement
between the two. She wrote as though she definitely counted on
becoming mistress of the Hampstead house, even though only to
have it sold.</p>

<p>Suddenly the telephone bell rang. A servant entered, making
towards the instrument at a leisurely gait. But Pointer had
reached it at the first tinkle.</p>

<p>"'Alf a tic! It'll be for me. From the boss. Speaking from the
head office." He took the receiver and nodded. "It's 'im all
right. Yes, sir. This is Mr. 'Aslar's."</p>

<p>"Who's speaking?" called a sharp voice: the voice of a very
angry, or a very excited man.</p>

<p>"Me, sir; Long."</p>

<p>"I want your master at once on the 'phone. Is he in?"</p>

<p>"'Alf a mo, sir." Pointer passed a hand over the 'phone. He
worked very hard at the trick. Inside the mouthpiece was now
another one that blocked it completely so that nothing could pass
through to the ears listening at the other end. Nothing showed.
The thin rubber mould fitted easily. "It's my boss all right,"
Pointer turned to the manservant; "wants the foreman." A touch of
Pointer's finger and the india-rubber lining to the 'phone
disappeared into his palm. "'E's not 'ere now, sir. 'E's out.
What number shall I tell 'im to ring up?" was the next best move
to asking who was speaking.</p>

<p>"Westminster 1876? Oh, very good, sir." Pointer heard the
receiver slammed down at the other end, and continued, "You'll be
at the works, I suppose, sir? And what about those three-quarter
fittings? They don't seem to work quite right. Mr. 'Aslar 'ere
seems to 've made no complaint, but farther down the road the
smell is somethink awful. Very good, sir. Yes, sir. At once!" and
Pointer turned away.</p>

<p>"I'll send along my mate to go on 'unting for that escape. I
must 'urry. The boss is on his 'ind legs." And Pointer made for
the nearest telephone outside the house.</p>

<p>Here he rang up Westminster 1876. He got the number at once.
Pointer was a capital mimic, thanks to hard work and lessons from
the best mimic on the London music halls. In a hoarse voice, as
like Haslar's as he could make it, he wheezed into the tube.</p>

<p>"Just got back with a damned bad cold. Who's at that end?"</p>

<p>"Me!" came in menacing tones.</p>

<p>"Who the devil's 'me'?" croaked the pseudo Haslar.</p>

<p>"Brown!" came in the same tone. "Now do you understand?"</p>

<p>Pointer coughed into the receiver by way of gaining time. He
was doing double-quick thinking.</p>

<p>"I'm in a hurry," he croaked finally.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose I'm in? I want to see you at once. <i>At
once</i>, understand!" Haslar might have been the mysterious
'Brown's' slave. "Same place as before."</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I'll come," Pointer retorted.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you will!" There was an ugly menace in the voice.
"Oh, yes, you will! I know everything. Understand?"</p>

<p>Pointer did not reply.</p>

<p>"Now do you get me? Come at once. Same place as before."</p>

<p>"Can't. Not to the same place," Pointer said
doggedly&mdash;and truthfully.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Dangerous."</p>

<p>"Where, then?" growled the voice at the other end.</p>

<p>"How about the grill-room of the Savoy?" Pointer asked, as a
feeler in that hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"How about the throne room of Buckingham Palace!" came the
retort. "I don't think you quite realise what you're in for, my
clever young friend. I've got you in a cleft stick. One shift of
a finger and you're crushed."</p>

<p>"I suppose you're aware that this is not an automatic
exchange?" Haslar's voice asked roughly, thickly. "Either speak
sense, or dry up!"</p>

<p>"I'll talk sense fast enough. Now listen. There's a Spanish
feeding place off Shaftesbury Avenue. Fuenta Castellana. I'll be
there outside the door at seven to the moment. And look here,
Haslar, don't keep me waiting. If I got bored I might stroll into
that police station near by. Get me?"</p>

<p>"I've a mind to send Newman," Pointer hoarsely confided to the
wire.</p>

<p>"You come yourself!" was the retort, "and don't forget your
pocket-book. You'll need it, by God! No cheques, mind."</p>

<p>"I shall get Straight to come too."</p>

<p>"What Straight? Run straight yourself!" The facetiousness did
not extend to the voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right. But I shall be in disguise. Aged man. Two
crutches. Look out for me." Pointer did not dare hang up for fear
of the Brown at the other end ringing up the real Haslar. He
waited till the other had expressed his burning opinion of such
monkey tricks, and repeated the injunction to bring a well-filled
note-case with him. Pointer made for his own rooms at the Yard,
and turned to his book of disguises.</p>

<p>"Old Gentleman&mdash;crutches" was Number Fifteen. In a slit
of a cupboard numbered fifteen was the complete outer man of what
might have been the Chief Inspector's great-grandfather.
Pointer's difficulty was to give himself a touch of Haslar as
well. Also his disguise had to look like a disguise. The effect
was to be that of an amateur at the game. The bushy white
eyebrows palpably put on, the Father Christmas beard obviously
added.</p>

<p>He finally took a taxi, driven by one of his own men, and got
out at the little bit of Spain indicated by the mysterious
"voice."</p>

<p>He could almost have smelled his way thither. <i>Gazpacho</i>
of true Iberian strength was evidently one of the dishes of the
day.</p>

<p>Outside the door four men were waiting. One was thin. The
voice over the telephone had not been that of a thin man. One was
young. Nor that of a young man. The third, though stout and
getting towards middle-age, was obviously Spanish. The man
speaking had not been a foreigner. The fourth was&mdash;good
Heavens! It was Cory! Major Cory of the Holford Will Case. A case
fought out some dozen years before, where the major had been
accused by the daughter of undue influence in causing old Mrs.
Holford to leave every farthing to him and nothing to her only
child, a middle-aged spinster. In spite of his expressed sympathy
with the prosecutrix, the judge, as well as the jury, had had to
let the major bear off the spoils. Pointer had heard with great
joy that they did the man no good. Racing and Monte Carlo had
helped to run through the money in a couple of years.</p>

<p>Cory was one of those men in whom our police take an abiding
interest. For the Metropolitan Police have still a great deal to
learn when it comes to appreciating those who, like certain rare
orchids, seem able to live on air.</p>

<p>So Cory had wanted Haslar on the telephone all morning. Cory
gave his name as Brown. Cory knew Newman, but did not seem to
know Straight. Humph...Pointer tottered out of the taxi and
hobbled up to him.</p>

<p>"Here I am, Cory, where shall we go?"</p>

<p>Cory eyed him, as a dog eyes a man before biting.</p>

<p>"Think yourself clever because you're got up like an organ-grinder? Your voice gives you away, Haslar, though. I'd know you
anywhere."</p>

<p>"Would you?" Haslar's voice asked in chagrin.</p>

<p>"Anywhere. But now&mdash;" The other, who seemed in a very
high and mighty mood, steered Pointer to a table in a corner. He
ordered a bottle of 1896 port, mentioning gracefully that there
was no point in not having the best that the house kept, as
Haslar would foot the bill.</p>

<p>"And now look here, Haslar," Cory began, as soon as they were
alone. "I know all! <i>All</i>. Get me?" Cory bored a pair of
bold eyes into the old gentleman's. "Now, how much is it worth to
you not to have me&mdash;" Suddenly the "gallant major" stopped,
shot one glance at Pointer that made the latter get his right
hand ready, and slipped with extraordinary swiftness out of the
place.</p>

<p>Pointer looked about him. A man, a police officer by his
smart, alert bearing, had entered in company with a companion who
looked like a needy artist in search of copy. The two had taken a
table not far from Pointer. The Detective Inspector wondered
whether ever any of his criminals had more regretted meeting
Inspector Bradly than did he at that moment.</p>

<p>Pointer caught his eye and gave the signal of the C.I.D. as he
threw a match away. Rising, he handed a bank note to his waiter
and said he would be back for the change in a moment. Bradly
strolled after him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gaskell, I believe?" Bradly said politely, touching him
on the arm, "Mr. Gaskell from Leeds?"</p>

<p>Pointer shook hands with the air of a countryman overjoyed to
see a familiar face in a strange town.</p>

<p>"You saw Cory leaving?" he asked under his breath.</p>

<p>Bradly nodded.</p>

<p>"Saw one of your men after him too, sir. Did I frighten him
away? Too bad! Mr. Tindall wanted to see if he couldn't find out
something down here about a Spaniard who has been to the mortuary
to identify this Etcheverrey who's just been found killed. Thank
Heaven, if I may say so! He said he couldn't identify him at all.
Might be him, might not. But Mr. Tindall was told that he looked
at that foot as though expecting to find a scar on the sole. Mr.
Tindall thought he might have come on here. So he might. But 'a
tall, slender, dark young man with a big drooping moustache'
would fit a dozen chaps in that very room. Still, Mr. Tindall
asked me to come along and point out a couple of dagoes who are
ready to sell any one to either side."</p>

<p>"You were in that Holford Case, weren't you, Inspector?"
Pointer asked presently.</p>

<p>Bradly nodded. "Yes, sir. Before your time, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Ever heard the name of Haslar mentioned in connection with
it?"</p>

<p>"Haslar?" Bradly thought hard. "I don't remember that name
cropping up."</p>

<p>"Nor Clifford?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Clifford was one of the chief witnesses against Cory. He
all but dished him. Mr. Julian Clifford, the great author, I
mean. He was a friend of old Mrs. Holford's. He maintained that
Cory had stolen a later will and burnt it. Knew the very hour he
stole it. But he couldn't prove anything. Though he saw to it
that every one knew what he thought, so that there should be no
hanging on to clubs or society afterwards for Cory. It did me
good to hear him in the witness-box."</p>

<p>Suddenly Bradly clicked his fingers. "Mr. Clifford's nephew!
Australian boy. Yes, Haslar was his name. It was in the holidays,
and he used to come into court with his uncle, Mr. Clifford, and
ask me no end of questions in between whiles."</p>

<p>"You're keeping an eye on Cory, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Bradly said that during the twenty-four hours about sixty
police orbs were more or less focused on the major.</p>

<p>"He's evidently up to no good," the police officer went on,
"he never is, of course. But I mean that he's evidently up to
something he can get into trouble over, or he wouldn't have faded
away like that when he saw me. I don't deny that I would give a
year's pay to jug him, and he knows it! That poor old Miss
Holford in an Institute sticks in my crop."</p>

<p>Pointer let Bradly return to Tindall, and walked off. That
telephone message from Brown...the whole, tone of Cory's
conversation with the supposed Haslar...a previous grudge against
Clifford...a boy, now a man, who knew of that grudge...</p>

<p>Pointer walked on deep in thought, leaving his change for some
other time.</p>

<p>Clifford&mdash;Haslar&mdash;Cory...Linked, though but loosely,
by the old crime of the stolen will. Clifford as principal
witness, Haslar as a young, eager listener, with the retentive
memory of a boy for what interests him, Cory as the accused man.
Were these three once more linked closely, for all time, by a new
crime, by the most terrible of all crimes?</p>

<p>Pointer returned at once to New Scotland Yard where he learnt
several things. No one could be found who had seen any stranger
entering or leaving flat fourteen, where, according to the head
porter, some silver ornaments had been stolen.</p>

<p>Nothing of any importance had been listened to along either
Mrs. Orr's, Clifford's or Haslar's telephones, except his own
conversation with "Brown."</p>

<p>The woman detective who had been sent to Mrs. Orr's house
reported that that lady had an impeccable bill of health as far
as last night went. This morning she had left for Paris by the
eleven boat train from Victoria, and Mrs. Clifford had been among
the little group of friends to see her off.</p>

<p>Inspector Watts sent in word that no packages of any kind had
been delivered at Wellwyn and Co.'s warehouse in Thames Street
after closing time yesterday, until a vanload of wireless masts
had arrived this morning about ten. Detective-Inspector Watts had
been assured that no mistake was possible.</p>

<p>Finally came the account of a very pretty bit of wizardry that
had been performed in the office of the house-agent while the
Chief Inspector had been finishing his investigations among
Haslar's effects. Arnold Haslar's voice had been reeled off by a
tiny microphone phonograph which had been in the gas man's bag.
The house-agent had identified the "What the devil are you doing
with my clothes?" as undoubtedly the voice of Monsieur Tourcoin,
who had taken Marshall's furnished flat on Friday last. The same
performance had obtained the same result from the head porter. So
Tourcoin was now fairly well proved to be Arnold Haslar.</p>

<p>Was it quite true that no packages whatever had been left at
the warehouse? There could be no question of a "burglary" there.
Every building in that street had its night watchman. Pointer's
ruminations were interrupted by still another piece of
information. It was from the man who was trailing Cory. The wily
major had taken a bus to some flats, had walked up to the third
floor, had shot down in a lift for one storey, and there caught
another on its way to the roof garden, while Pointer's man was
covering the door nearest to the first shaft. After the roof
garden all trace of Cory was lost.</p>

<p>Pointer had given his man very strict instructions to lose him
rather than let him see that he was followed. He did not want the
major to leave London. The police had half a dozen funk-holes of
his on their list, to one of which he was sure to return once he
believed that no one was trailing him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6">CHAPTER 6</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT was eight o'clock. Pointer began to think
that he might waste a few minutes of the case's time in eating a
dinner, when a message that reached him along his telephone wire
whisked that prospect away once more.</p>

<p>"Is that Chief Inspector Pointer? Police-Constable Caldicott
speaking. Acting in accordance with instructions received at the
station, I am reporting directly to you, sir, that Mr. Haslar has
just been murdered."</p>

<p>Pointer's lips tightened. He had not expected this. Yet, at
the same time&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was called in by the butler at four minutes past eight,
sir. Just two minutes ago"&mdash;P.-C. Caldicott was evidently an
accurate young man&mdash;"Mr. Haslar was shot in his study. Don't
know yet how it happened, sir."</p>

<p>It was not many minutes later when Pointer was hurrying with
the speaker up the winding drive.</p>

<p>"Left a man in the house, I hope?" the Chief Inspector
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. P.-C. Bacon. I whistled for him at once."</p>

<p>Bacon stood in the hall waiting for them. The servants were
evidently battened down below hatches.</p>

<p>"Mr. Haslar isn't quite dead, sir, as we thought at first. The
doctor found some signs of life. He insisted on having him
carried to his bedroom."</p>

<p>Pointer ran upstairs, and with one constable went thoroughly,
but swiftly, over the house and through the garden. No one was in
hiding. Then the Chief Inspector turned the handle of Haslar's
room very gently.</p>

<p>A young man looked up as he entered without a sound.</p>

<p>"Medical man?"</p>

<p>Pointer laid his card on the table.</p>

<p>"You'll have to be quick, Chief Inspector," the doctor
whispered. "We've just sent for Sir Hercules Hawkins. Not that he
can do anything. Bullet went in here and is still in." He pointed
to a spot just above the right ear. The injured man lay on a
table pulled between the windows. Sheets had been spread on it,
sheets covered him. Pointer did not waste more than one long look
at the head and face. The doctor had cleaned the wound too
carefully for him.</p>

<p>"Singed hair?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Singed hair and blackened skin," the doctor assured him.
"Revolver must have been fired pressed against the head."</p>

<p>"No hope of his speaking?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't say that for some brief moment consciousness may not
come back. It often does just before the end. The final flicker.
But that's the merest chance. Ah, here's Sir Hercules, with a
couple of nurses!"</p>

<p>A gray-haired man entered hurriedly. Pointer slipped from the
room as silently as he had entered it.</p>

<p>"Who's he?" the surgeon muttered; "splendid-looking chap!
Knows how to put his feet down. Boxes, I'll bet."</p>

<p>Downstairs Pointer went into the study, the room where the
injured man had been found. He stood with his back to the door
closely eyeing the whole before he took a step forward.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard the front door open. Stepping into the hall,
he saw Diana come hurrying in. Straight was with her.</p>

<p>Both stopped appalled as they caught sight of the constable
who rose from his seat in the hall. Diana's face, already pale,
grew ghastly. Then she saw Pointer at the study door. She took a
step towards him. Something in its swift motion suggested the
pathetic effort of a mother-bird between her nest and a robber.
She knew at once that this man with the sun-browned face and the
steady, very clear, gray eyes was in command. As she looked at
him, she felt a sudden sense of his power, of his ability to
surmount difficulties that would stop a smaller man. And with
that sense came a sickening knowledge of her brother's
danger.</p>

<p>"Miss Haslar? I am Chief Inspector Pointer of New Scotland
Yard. Can I have a word with you in the next room? This gentleman
is&mdash;?" He eyed Straight as though he had never seen him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Straight. My uncle's secretary," Diana said swiftly. "He
merely accompanied me to the house when I could not make out a
telephone message just now. But please don't wait." She turned to
Dick very resolutely. She did not intend to involve him in her
brother's disgrace, for she feared that an arrest had been
made.</p>

<p>His answer was to open a door. The three stepped in.</p>

<p>"What is wrong?" Diana asked in a toneless voice.</p>

<p>Something in the grave kindness of the face looking at her
frightened her more than any words would have done. She read
Pointer's look rightly as profound pity. Pity for this young life
caught up into the swirl of dark passions, she who should have
been a creature of sunshine and happiness. Somehow, Pointer felt
that so far the lines had not fallen unto Diana in very pleasant
places.</p>

<p>"Miss Haslar," Pointer broke the painful silence, "your
brother has met with an accident. The doctor and a surgeon are
with him upstairs. He has been shot in the head."</p>

<p>"Shot!" Diana wheeled. She made for the door, but Pointer
stopped her.</p>

<p>"No one is allowed to enter his room. They are trying to
extricate the bullet."</p>

<p>"He's not dead?"</p>

<p>"Not when I was there a moment before the surgeon came. He's
very badly wounded, but he was not dead."</p>

<p>"Who shot him?" Diana asked, putting out a hand and grasping
the back of a chair. Whom did she suspect? The dread in her eyes
told the keen eyes that barely seemed to glance at her that she
suspected some one.</p>

<p>"I know nothing about the case yet," Pointer said quietly.
"You probably can tell me who was Mr. Haslar's enemy?"</p>

<p>"He has no enemy. No open enemy," Diana said slowly.</p>

<p>"A so-called friend, then," Pointer said swiftly. He hoped to
get some name out of her in her agitation. But she only turned
away with a weary, yet resolute, gesture.</p>

<p>"He has a host of friends whom I don't know."</p>

<p>Pointer glanced inquiringly at Straight, who promptly passed
the look on to Diana. But she met his eyes stonily.</p>

<p>"Who sent for you?" Pointer asked, after a pause.</p>

<p>"I don't know. A telephone message just reached me at my
uncle's, Mr. Julian Clifford's house, saying that something had
happened to Mr. Haslar. I couldn't make out what."</p>

<p>She had not tried to. She had guessed an arrest, not a fresh
crime. Whose crime?</p>

<p>"If you and Mr. Straight could wait for me in the drawing-room, I should like to come on up in a few minutes, and ask some
questions," Pointer went on.</p>

<p>She looked at him like a creature caught in a snare. Then she
nodded, and followed by Dick mounted the stairs as Tindall
arrived hot-foot. The Chief Inspector had telephoned him the news
before starting out.</p>

<p>Tindall, like Pointer, looked keenly about him. There was no
sign of a struggle except that one chair had been pushed
violently back against the table behind it&mdash;a chair on the
farther side of the big writing table which only a couple of
hours ago had been the object of Pointer's own interest.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector opened the door and said a word to the
constable. A moment later and Wilkins came in. He looked what he
was, a dependable, honest man. He was pale now and trembling.</p>

<p>"Who telephoned to Miss Haslar?"</p>

<p>"I did, sir. Just before you arrived. Or rather I got the
constable to telephone her something guarded."</p>

<p>"Where did you find your master's body? I see. You heard no
shot?"</p>

<p>Wilkins' face twitched. His eyes filled.</p>

<p>"No, sir. But of course with the noise that cars make
nowadays, one bang more or less&mdash;" Wilkins waggled a shaking
hand helplessly. "I've been in service here since Mr. Arnold was
a boy at school, and to think that I sat reading the paper! To
think that not one of us downstairs raised a hand to help him!
Just up from a sick-bed too!" Wilkins quite broke down for a
minute or two.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Haslar&mdash;was he tidy? careful about cigarette
ends, matches, and so on?" Pointer asked to steady him.
"Remarkably so, as a rule, sir."</p>

<p>"Who are Mr. Haslar's enemies?" Tindall asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Why, he hasn't any, sir." Wilkins spoke with dignity. "Why
should he have? At least, he's none in England. I can't, of
course, speak for Australia."</p>

<p>That was all that was wanted of Wilkins for the moment. As
soon as the door closed behind him, Tindall wheeled.</p>

<p>"So Haslar was remarkably neat and tidy, eh? Just so. And I
thought you hadn't yet seen that burnt paper under the desk,
while&mdash;Hallo!"</p>

<p>Pointer had lifted the flounce of a chair cover and both men
now saw a revolver lying under the seat near an open window.
Holding it in place with one gloved finger, the Chief Inspector
ran a chalk outline around it. Then he lifted it with the
greatest care. It was a .25 automatic. From some faint marks in
the barrel, Tindall thought that a very light silencer might have
been used. They found no finger-prints on the metal. Two shots
had been fired.</p>

<p>"Two shots!" Both men looked carefully around the room again.
They found no bullet or blood spatters.</p>

<p>"Went wide, probably out through that window, or the other man
has the bullet. Carried it away in his body, though that's
unlikely, as there's no blood trail. Look here"&mdash;Tindall was
down on his knees&mdash;"that revolver was flung. Flung so as to
look as though the murderer had got out into the garden." He
pointed to a long streak on the polish of the parquet floor which
had stopped at the little snub-nosed thing Pointer was now
wrapping in tinfoil.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have been flung here, from where Haslar was found
lying. That disposes of any idea of suicide. Besides, two shots
were fired from it. No. Haslar must have fired the first at his
opponent, and then had the revolver wrenched from his hand and
got the second in his own head, practically killing him. That
done, the murderer stepped away from the falling body, and flung
the revolver towards the window from about here." Tindall stood
'here.' "And then left, either by the front door or by the other
window. I believe there's a connection between this murder and
Julian Clifford's. Uncle and nephew. What do you say, Chief
Inspector?"</p>

<p>"A connection? Oh, yes; I, too, think there may be one.
Probably a close one."</p>

<p>Tindall joined Pointer, who, after strolling around the room
again, touching this, feeling that, even testing the earth around
a palm, and lifting the pot up and down in its brass jardinière,
was now bending over a small heap of charred remains of paper
which lay under the desk, a match among them. Both stood up after
a long scrutiny. Not even the magic of modern science could
reconstruct that black dust.</p>

<p>"Some one ground it into the carpet after burning it," Tindall
murmured.</p>

<p>"Haslar. His right heel shows it. I looked at his shoes
upstairs," Pointer replied. He was down on his knees minutely
examining the carpet in front of the pushed-back chair, running a
tiny but very powerful vacuum cleaner over it. The gadget was
barely the size of his hand, but it did its work well.</p>

<p>Tindall watched him with secret impatience.</p>

<p>"The eyes of the mind, Chief Inspector, are the ones that see
farthest. As soon as you've done sweeping, I'd like to question
the servants again."</p>

<p>"By all means." Pointer put the little patent back in his
case. They called the butler in again and then the valet. The
rest, of the servants knew nothing.</p>

<p>At half-past six this afternoon Arnold Haslar had rung: said
he was fed up with bed, and intended to get up. He was in a very
grim mood; but he had been tending that way, for a fortnight
past, both men agreed.</p>

<p>The butler thought it was due to the coming attack of the
'flu, but the butler, under Tindall's careful pressure, was
inclined to connect it with the arrival of a couple of letters by
this morning's post. Wilkins had a nephew who collected stamps,
and he therefore kept an eye on envelopes from abroad. One of the
letters, in a very odd, bold writing, had come from Spain. He had
not noticed the other.</p>

<p>"Spain!" Tindall cocked an eye at Pointer. "What place in
Spain?"</p>

<p>But Wilkins could not say. The butler connected that Spanish
letter with Mr. Haslar's illness because, after breakfast, he had
found a letter scattered over the table and floor, torn into tiny
shreds, and his master sitting as though stunned beside the
table. He had had to be helped into bed, and the doctor summoned.
No. The butler had not spoken of this to any one, not even to
Miss Diana. He had "thought it better not." The later letters
which had come from Mr. Haslar today had been sent down to the
office.</p>

<p>The valet had more to tell. About seven, after saying that he
would dine out, Mr. Haslar had gone downstairs. About half-past,
or perhaps a quarter to eight, he could not be more exact, Smith
had heard his master's voice in the north library, which was his
own study, raised as though in anger. The words, "You've got to
do it, and do it at once!" reached Smith, but he was too far up
the stairs to catch anything but that one passionate roar. On
that had come what he, as well as Wilkins below, had believed to
be a motor-cycle starting up its engine outside with a set of
terrific bangs. A few minutes later, Wilkins, coming into the
library to see if all was well with his young master, found him
slipped to the floor by his writing-table chair apparently dead,
a little red wound still trickling blood above his ear. No one
had seen or heard any one enter or leave the house. But Haslar's
friends generally let themselves in and out with careless ease.
The latch of the front door was caught back by day. Questioned as
to strangers who had been to the house lately, Major Cory's
photograph, among six others, was picked out unhesitatingly by
Wilkins as that of a man who, giving no name, had first come to
see Arnold Haslar last Thursday evening. He had come on Friday,
and also last night, and had then for the first time given the
name of Captain Brown. Wilkins' eyes met those of the Chief
Inspector and the man from the Foreign Office with a certain
dignity.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you the exact truth, sir. Things can't be worse"&mdash;which incidentally spoke volumes for Wilkins' idea of the police.</p>

<p>The man had arrived each time at about the same hour on
Thursday and Friday and yesterday. Somewhere around nine.
Questioned closely, Wilkins said that there had been no signs of
any trouble between his master and the man whose photograph he
had identified, but he had noticed that on no occasion had Mr.
Haslar offered to shake hands with his visitor, who had stayed
over an hour on the first two occasions, though but a bare half-hour last night. On the first occasion, at any rate, the
conversation must have been of a very private character, because
he, Wilkins, had had some business that took him to the library
at the same time, and had only caught a low murmur.</p>

<p>"A very unusual thing with Mr. Arnold Haslar talking in his
study, sir. As a rule, you have to hear every word, whether you
want to or not. It and the library are really only one room,
partitioned off."</p>

<p>Pointer referred to some coolness between Mr. Haslar and his
uncle, Mr. Julian Clifford. But obviously the butler knew nothing
of any such feeling.</p>

<p>Both he and Smith unhesitatingly identified the automatic
found by the window as Mr. Haslar's. More important still, the
valet swore that it had been in its usual place when his master
was having his bath. He had opened the drawer to drop a penknife
into it. Smith had an idea that he had heard Mr. Haslar come up
and go into his bedroom while he, the valet, was tidying up in
the dressing-room. He must have taken the weapon then. As far as
Smith knew, Mr. Haslar had never taken the automatic downstairs
before.</p>

<p>"So Mr. Haslar expected trouble," Tindall mused. "Knew when it
was coming, and got ready f or it. Was he a good shot?"</p>

<p>"He was apt to get over-eager, and spoil his aim." And just
out of bed, he, Smith, wouldn't be surprised if his master had
missed the man entirely, worse luck. Smith knew nothing about any
caller last night, but he did know that about ten Mr. Haslar had
driven off in a great hurry, telling Wilkins not to let any one
sit up, as he would not be back till very late. Smith had an
idea, only an idea, that Mr. Haslar had rushed off in answer to a
telephone message that had seemed to vex him very much.</p>

<p>"Any one in the house who knows more than you and Wilkins do?"
Tindall asked, pulling on a glove.</p>

<p>"No. None of us knows anything really. It's tough!...not
knowing...not being able to do something." And Smith left
them.</p>

<p>"Strange case!" Tindall mused; "strange and deep. Etcheverrey
like a spider in the middle of the web. I wonder what Sir Edward
Clifford will say. He must be back by now. It's close on nine.
There's the devil of a lot to do. To bridge the gap between
Clifford and Haslar, and link both with Etcheverrey!"</p>

<p>Caldicott, the constable, came in.</p>

<p>"Gentleman of the name of Dance to see you, sir. Mr. Haslar's
manager. Said you just telephoned him."</p>

<p>Pointer had.</p>

<p>Dance was a stout, frank-faced man with a strong Australian
accent. He was considerably older than Haslar. Just now he looked
consternation personified. He was of no help, except that he
scoffed at the idea of a business enemy of Arnold Haslar's.</p>

<p>"This has nothing to do with business," he maintained. "Search
for the dame! Fortunately at the office Haslar's supposed to be
still ill with 'flu. He'll stay ill with it too. We're a good
firm. A darned good firm. But shootings&mdash;whew!"</p>

<p>"There's a strong-room built into one end of this study,"
Pointer said finally, "would you open it for us? I want to see
inside it." He did&mdash;very much indeed.</p>

<p>Dance hesitated.</p>

<p>"You know the code word?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know it. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The butler told me Mr. Haslar keeps no valuables on the
place."</p>

<p>"That's right. Still, you see, after all, a code
word&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer and Tindall stood with their backs to Mr. Dance who,
even so, held his hat over what he was doing. Finally he called
to them.</p>

<p>"Door's open."</p>

<p>The opening showed a fairly large strong-room, large as a big
cupboard. Dance glanced at the shelves, on which dusty deed boxes
were stacked.</p>

<p>"Nothing's gone. Haslar keeps six-year-back accounts, and
papers, and so on, here. Like his grand-dad. The boxes are
unlocked. There's nothing else in them."</p>

<p>Pointer found that there was nothing else in them. He looked
very, very carefully. So did Tindall, catching his idea.</p>

<p>"And about a package," Pointer went on, after the door had
been locked with the same coyness on Mr. Dance's part, "a package
that Mr. Haslar, or a friend of his, sent, or brought down, to
the warehouse late last night"&mdash;Pointer ran over the
possible times and sizes&mdash;"will you inquire for it and send
it along to me?" He gave his name and home address, for Pointer
believed that Watts might have been deceived. "We think it will
help us, give us a line about this affair. I should expect the
parcel to be marked 'to be kept in a cold place.' You haven't a
furnace, have you?"</p>

<p>To his relief he learnt that the warehouse was only a between-station for electrical parts and material on its way to or from
Australia. There was no furnace.</p>

<p>Mr. Dance would obviously have liked a fuller explanation of
many puzzling points, but this was a very busy evening with him,
and as all Pointer's hours came under that heading, the meeting
quickly broke up. Tindall too shook hands and hurried off.</p>

<p>Pointer looked at his boot-tips for a long second. Then he had
Smith in again, and offered him a cigar and a chair.</p>

<p>"There's a confidential question I want to put to you," he
said slowly. He waited.</p>

<p>"Confidential it is," the ex-Anzac said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"What was the quarrel about between your master and Mr.
Clifford?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Clifford?" For a second Smith stared as a man does who is
suddenly, unexpectedly, wrenched around to face another way. Then
he looked a little dubious.</p>

<p>"Though you may not see the connection, that quarrel may give
us a line on who it was who shot Mr. Haslar," Pointer said very
quietly.</p>

<p>Smith eyed him with respect.</p>

<p>"That so?" He straddled his chair and clasped the carved back
in a medititive embrace. "That so," he repeated thoughtfully.
"Well, I don't know what it was about, but it was a pretty hot
affair. You're referring to last Wednesday evening, of
course?"</p>

<p>Pointer nodded.</p>

<p>"You didn't hear anything?"</p>

<p>"Nope. I never was much of a listener-in," Smith said
carelessly, and Pointer regretfully believed him. He did not look
it.</p>

<p>"Only as Mr. Haslar flung the door open he nearly caught my
toe, and I had to step back to let Mr. Clifford pass out. Mr.
Clifford looked very calm, I must say. Quite unruffled. But Mr.
Haslar called after him, 'If you <i>do</i> do it, look out for
yourself!' That's all. Not much of a clue there, is there? But
it's funny"&mdash;Smith sat up straighter&mdash;"it's funny that
then he threatened 'If you <i>do</i> do it,' and to-day he was
shouting that 'You've got to do it!'" He looked keenly at
Pointer, who shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, Smith. It wasn't to Mr. Julian Clifford that he spoke to-day. I wish it had been," he added cryptically.</p>

<p>Smith got up rather sheepishly. "Of course, sleuthing can't be
as easy as that, I suppose. And, of course, Mr. Julian Clifford
had nothing to do with any shooting."</p>

<p>He went away to make other and more startling combinations
yet, of the two sentences, while Pointer went up to the drawing-room where Diana and Straight sat waiting for him.</p>

<p>Straight looked as though he very much wished himself well out
of it all. Murders, or shootings, were not at all what he had
expected when he had landed in Portsmouth only yesterday as
Julian Clifford's librarian. Straight felt that he had a
grievance against fate. Here he was, a plain, common-sense sort
of young man, only desirous of doing well in the world, of
getting on, being drawn into a very black, deep, and dangerous
affair. What was the reason for that bullet which had all but
killed Arnold Haslar?</p>

<p>"You have no idea who fired that shot at Haslar?" he had just
asked Diana.</p>

<p>She only stirred as though in pain.</p>

<p>What did Arnold know? Had he learnt something? Did he guess
something? Was it because of some incautiously shown curiosity
that&mdash;these were the knives at which she was staring,
wondering which of them was about to be plunged in her heart.</p>

<p>The door opened and Pointer came in.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear your brother speak of a man of the name of
Cory?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. Straight, too, shook his when Pointer
turned to him.</p>

<p>"And you, Mr. Straight, have you by any chance ever heard Mr.
Haslar speak as though there were any especial person with whom
he is on bad terms?" Straight never had.</p>

<p>Pointer next ostensibly asked each about the other persons at
Thornbush this afternoon. In reality he was obtaining from Diana
and Straight a time-table of their own actions.</p>

<p>They were simple. When Wilkins had telephoned to Diana they
had ostensibly been having tea together. In reality Dick had had
the tea, and tried in vain to coax Diana to have some.</p>

<p>After another careful glance in every room, Pointer drove away
from the house to stop and question his watcher at the
corner&mdash;a taxi-driver with a cab that would not go, tinker
though he might.</p>

<p>The man had seen no one enter, or leave, Arnold Haslar's
house, but he was not a picked man. The coming royal visitor kept
every good man busy combing through the aliens' quarters of
London. Also, nothing is harder than to watch a place for hours
on end. Especially if, like this man, he had to pretend to attend
to other interests as well. Doubtless he had done his best, yet
Pointer knew that at least one person&mdash;a man
probably&mdash;had come, and therefore gone, from Arnold Haslar's
house. This person had left a plentiful sprinkling of yellow sand
on the carpet in front of that dashed-back chair.</p>

<p>Now the paths in Haslar's garden were gravelled with red
gravel. The roads and pavements around showed only the usual town
dust. At Thornbush, however, the paths were all of yellow sand,
rolled for the most part into compact ribbons. But one little
walk, cutting off a corner of the drive&mdash;a corner that
shortened the distance to Haslar's house too, was freshly sanded,
and soft as a country lane. It looked, therefore, as though a
person from Thornbush had been the man&mdash;or woman&mdash;who
had pushed back that chair.</p>

<p>Diana and Straight had been in each other's company. They were
out of the question. Mrs. Clifford was at a Spiritualist meeting.
Hobbs was located in the Ritz dining with some South American
film magnate. There remained Newman...Newman...Pointer had a
theory of what had happened in that study. But his theories were
always subject to modification, should facts not fit them without
having to be twisted. Had Major Cory, after he had given his
trailer the slip, made his way to Haslar's house? Pointer thought
that he had.</p>

<p>He himself drove to Thornbush and stopped in the garden. In
his hand was what appeared to be a stereoscopic camera. It was an
uncommonly good binocular. He chose a position against a plane
tree and donned dark gray gloves. His cuffs, too, were tucked
well up out of sight. A casual eye from the house could hardly
notice him at this hour of gloaming against the snake markings of
the trunk, as he carefully studied a certain open window facing
him.</p>

<p>Newman was bending over a well-lit table on which a paper
sprawled, by its ungainly size an English paper. He was reading
it avidly. Pointer recognised a picture in it. Newman was reading
an account of the "Heath Mansions Mystery," as it was now called.
A moment, and he had tossed it to the floor and spread out
another from a pile beside him. Suddenly he stopped, turned his
head towards the door, and called cheerily, "Come in!" Pointer
could hear his voice easily through the open window. As he
called, Newman, working with noiseless speed, shoved the several
papers into a drawer of his writing table with an amazing
stealth. Not a crackle reached Pointer; not a crackle could reach
the door of the room.</p>

<p>Newman now called, "Oh, is it locked?" in a tone of great
surprise, closing the drawer. All without any noise. Then with an
"I'm so sorry, I'd no idea!" he strode to the door. A servant
entered. Pointer went around to the front and rang the bell.</p>

<p>He sent in his name as Pointer, without prefixing his
position. Newman saw him at once. Pointer introduced himself to
him as of Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"I've come about the accident to Mr. Haslar," he began.</p>

<p>"Accident?" Newman started, or seemed to.</p>

<p>"He was shot at dose range just about the time you dropped in
to see him this evening."</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling me what happened?" Newman asked coolly,
but his lips had a white line around them.</p>

<p>Pointer told him the bare facts.</p>

<p>Newman sat with his head leaning on one hand. He had an
unusual power of absolute immobility.</p>

<p>"Miss Haslar must be in great trouble," Newman said, when
Pointer had finished.</p>

<p>"She's not so much in trouble as she's keen on getting the man
who shot her brother. She thinks he was shot, you see."</p>

<p>"Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. Haslar might have meant to commit suicide.
Might have all but succeeded," Pointer said, apparently not
looking at the man.</p>

<p>Newman's hand gave a little quiver before it steadied
again.</p>

<p>"Why should he do that?" he asked without raising his
head.</p>

<p>"Ah, why! Can't you suggest anything?" Pointer asked. "You
were the last person seen with Mr. Haslar."</p>

<p>"Was I indeed?" Newman seemed lost in thought. "No, I can
suggest nothing."</p>

<p>"What time exactly did you see him?" Pointer went on.</p>

<p>"Somewhere around seven, or a little after."</p>

<p>"Did you see any one coming or going to the house?"</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>Newman did not mention that he had called earlier and had been
refused permission by Diana to speak to Arnold.</p>

<p>"How about tome one having shot him who has a grudge against
him? A man of the name of Cory, for instance?" Pointer suggested
idly.</p>

<p>"Cory!" Newman repeated reflectively. "I seem to 've heard the
name before. But where&mdash;"</p>

<p>Newman was no fool; Pointer had not thought him one.</p>

<p>"And you think this same Cory&mdash;?" Newman queried, as one
at sea.</p>

<p>"One or two things were told us that show that he had a grudge
against Mr. Haslar. That he felt that he had been drawn into
something," Pointer said vaguely. As a boxer, he watched always
the feet of the person to whom he spoke. Newman moved no part of
his body above the table, but his feet shifted now.</p>

<p>"According to what was told us," Pointer went on in his quiet,
ruminative way, "this Major Cory was acting for Mr. Haslar in
some way."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Newman looked politely interested, but no more.</p>

<p>Pointer rose. He had met a wall. For the moment he thought it
best to retire. It would be sheer waste of time to ask this man
of what he and Haslar had talked, or why he had called on
him.</p>

<p>At the nearest telephone he learnt that a message had just
reached the Yard asking the Chief Inspector to come to Sir Edward
Clifford as soon as possible. He also listened for a minute to
the report from one of his men concerning the same gentleman.
Then he hurried off in his swift gray car.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7">CHAPTER 7</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT was close on ten when Pointer was shown into
the room where Sir Edward sat talking in low tones to Tindall.
The Chief Inspector found a man who, under his surface calm,
looked as though he had had a tremendous shock.</p>

<p>For the rest, Sir Edward was a typical diplomat in appearance.
That is to say, a man who kept his real self completely out of
sight. Urbane, courteous, non-committal, he was a pleasant talker
who could speak for hours without betraying one private
opinion&mdash; a man who never made a positive statement in
public in his life.</p>

<p>Pointer's police glance sought the man behind the arras. He
seemed to see a gentle and affectionate nature with a strong
sense of duty, of right and wrong&mdash;not a man of hot blood,
nor one given to swift action. Tindall was with Clifford. He had
been waiting for Pointer.</p>

<p>"Sir Edward has a very striking theory," the F.O. man began,
as soon as Pointer had sat down. "He thinks that though
Etcheverrey would not commit an ordinary murder, yet he might if
he thought he was being spied on, or if, even more, Mr. Clifford
had ever&mdash;say for some literary purpose in the
future&mdash;got into his organisation in some way. You see? You
remember that while the Cliffords were at St. Jean de Luz two
years ago, Etcheverrey's name was in every paper?"</p>

<p>Pointer nodded. The anti-royalist Basque had given a sort of
free pardon to the ex-Empress Zita through the press.</p>

<p>And the effrontery of it had amused, or infuriated, the whole
of Europe.</p>

<p>"You think Mr. Clifford had some such literary interest in
Etcheverrey?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"I do"&mdash;Sir Edward spoke heavily&mdash;"I do. I have for
some time past had a very definite idea that my brother was
revolving the idea of using Etcheverrey as material, and in the
near future."</p>

<p>"Suppose Mr. Clifford had probed deeper than we know?" Tindall
struck in. "He had practically unlimited money, a most inquiring
brain, invincible courage, or he wouldn't have gone on a whaler
as he did once, as one of the crew, too. Suppose he had actually
joined some band of Etcheverrey's agents, and been discovered?
Betrayed himself in some way, and been murdered; or, as
Etcheverrey would consider it, executed. Beheading is the method
of execution among the Basques, you know."</p>

<p>Pointer said nothing, he merely listened with close
attention.</p>

<p>"And as to Haslar," Tindall went on, "Haslar may have been a
go-between between Etcheverrey and Clifford."</p>

<p>"And Major Cory?"</p>

<p>"Also a member of the band, I think," Tindall said slowly.
"Possibly he learnt that Haslar was weakening, might give the
show away, and shot him."</p>

<p>Pointer smoked on in silence.</p>

<p>"How do you account for Cory?" Tindall asked, with a touch of
impatience.</p>

<p>"You F.O. men always want so much for your money," Pointer
quoted gravely under his breath, though Clifford was obviously
not listening.</p>

<p>"You're working on another line?"</p>

<p>"I intend to to-morrow. We were only called to Heath Mansions
this morning. To-morrow will see a big step forward, or all the
signs deceive me. I don't think this is a case that can stand
still. There's hurry in it, to my thinking. Did Mr. Clifford ever
say anything to you, Sir Edward, on which you base your idea of
his being particularly interested in Etcheverrey?"</p>

<p>Sir Edward roused himself from a deep reverie which was too
deep for Pointer's taste. Men do not usually go off into brown
studies when their own theory of their brother's murder is being
discussed.</p>

<p>"My brother. Julian never referred to Etcheverrey at Thornbush
as if he had any personal knowledge of him. Though he seemed, I
often thought, amazingly well up in his life story. But then, my
brother was well up in so many things." Clifford spoke in a voice
of deep regret.</p>

<p>"Who beside Mr. Clifford referred to Etcheverrey at
Thornbush?" Pointer asked. "Can you remember any one else who
ever questioned you about him?"</p>

<p>"No one but Miss Haslar; and she merely because as a girl she
had heard a good deal of him during the war, when she once spent
a summer at Hendaye."</p>

<p>There was a short silence.</p>

<p>Tindall rose and took a sympathetic leave. He had many new
lines now to follow up. Pointer went with him into the street,
and stood a second beside his car.</p>

<p>"How did Sir Edward take the sight of the body in the
mortuary? Did he identify it?"</p>

<p>"It was a frightful shock to him. Naturally."</p>

<p>"He recognised the body quite definitely?"</p>

<p>"He did. Quite definitely."</p>

<p>"Did he recognise it quickly?" Pointer persisted.</p>

<p>Tindall pulled at his beard.</p>

<p>"I pretty well insisted at the Commissioner's on being the one
to break the news of Julian Clifford's end to Sir Edward, and on
taking him to the mortuary afterwards..."</p>

<p>Pointer nodded.</p>

<p>"So I think I owe you the truth. I don't think Edward Clifford
particularly wanted to identify that body. I think he wanted to
be not quite sure. Natural perhaps. It's a horrible end to the
brother you've been good friends with all your life. At any rate,
he seemed unable, or unwilling, to be certain that it was the
body of Julian Clifford, since the head was missing. But I
remembered something he had told me himself apropos of one of my
boys hurting himself while diving, that Julian had pierced his
foot with a stake once while treading water. I showed him that
scar. Either that clinched it, or that decided him to recognise
the body. I'm frank with you."</p>

<p>There was a short pause.</p>

<p>"You may not have been the one after all who broke the news of
Mr. Julian Clifford's terrible end to Sir Edward Clifford,"
Pointer said in his turn. "Perhaps Mr. Hobbs did that. At any
rate, Mr. Clifford's literary agent was followed into the train
at Surbiton, the same train that brought Sir Edward up to town.
He travelled up with him in the same compartment. They had it to
themselves. That means a long talk. At Waterloo, Mr. Hobbs
hurried back to Thornbush without a word or glance at Sir Edward,
who got out of the train more slowly. By the way, Sir Edward
wasn't apparently expecting any one at Surbiton. He was buried in
a pile of papers, so my man says."</p>

<p>"Hobbs! but surely you don't suspect&mdash;but I suppose like
a good Scotland Yard man you suspect every one!" Tindall was
rather bored by such zeal.</p>

<p>"Whatever it was that brought Hobbs flying down to meet Edward
Clifford has nothing to do with Etcheverrey, therefore nothing to
do with me." He went on "I happen to know that Hobbs hadn't even
heard of the man's name, except as Sir Edward talked about him at
Thornbush. Of course all of us at the F.O. are full of nothing
else these days. No, what brought Hobbs would only be some family
worry. Or"&mdash;he stopped a moment&mdash;"I wonder! Hobbs
hinted once to me, not so long ago either, what one might call
his suspicions as to Clifford's reasons for leaving home every
now and then. But Hobbs had had a glass too much, and I thought
nothing of it. But it's possible that he really thinks Clifford
is mixed up in some scandal. Or may be mixed up in some. And that
would exactly explain Edward Clifford's manner by the coffin. He
didn't want to rush things. He wants time to think them over. He
does, you know. 'Slow and sure' is said to be his motto. But it's
not mine!" And Tindall jumped into a taxi.</p>

<p>Pointer was shown in again.</p>

<p>"When you spoke to Mr. Clifford of Etcheverrey, was any other
person present?' Pointer asked after a sympathetic pause.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I often spoke of him when all the Thornbush
household was there. And this last time&mdash;after dinner
yesterday&mdash; only yesterday!" His voice shook.</p>

<p>"Who was there then?"</p>

<p>"The whole Thornbush household."</p>

<p>"Did you ever speak of Etcheverrey's diagram-signature, or of
the name of his refuge in the Pyrenees?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"Do you think Mr. Clifford knew of it?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot say." Sir Edward seemed to be thinking back.
"Tindall has told you, I suppose, of my general impression of my
brother being much more up in the facts of Etcheverrey's
activities than I should have expected. A word or two here and
there&mdash;I did not notice them at the time&mdash;but by them,
and by the questions which he did not ask, I now feel sure that
he knew more than one would have expected him to."</p>

<p>"Now about Mr. Clifford's will," Pointer went on, "do you know
if he had made one? And if so, where he kept it?"</p>

<p>"He made a will only a couple of years ago. It's at Thornbush.
A copy is at his bank, I believe."</p>

<p>"I'd like to see that will. If possible I'd like to have 'a
look at it to-night. My car is outside, may I drive you to
Thornbush?"</p>

<p>Sir Edward hesitated.</p>

<p>"It's a terrible position&mdash;to know what I know
and&mdash;However, I believe she is out to-night. Yes, I know she
is."</p>

<p>"She?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford, of course. You shall see the will, Chief
Inspector, if it's still there and still addressed to me, and if
I can get it without letting Mrs. Clifford know. I understand
that she has no idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We've told her nothing," was the guarded reply.</p>

<p>"The shock may kill her. She and my brother were a most
devoted couple." He led the way out.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea as to the contents of Mr. Clifford's will?"
Pointer asked, when they were off.</p>

<p>"He read it to me. If it's still the one which he made two
years ago, as I think it is, I'm sole executor and residuary
legatee. There are a few legacies to relative; ten thousand to
Hobbs; nothing to Mrs. Clifford, at her express desire."</p>

<p>"I've been wondering," Pointer said, "whether Mr. Clifford had
any unexpected valuables on him. Any large sum of money..."</p>

<p>Sir Edward seemed to sit rather still for a second. Pointer
felt as though in some way he had given the other a jar.</p>

<p>"My brother never mentioned such a thing to me," he said
finally, with his eyes now intently fixed on the Chief
Inspector.</p>

<p>"Can you hazard a guess as to any dangerous thing that Mr.
Clifford was on the eve of doing?" Pointer went on.</p>

<p>"You mean those words of the palmist's&mdash;though it's
hardly fair to call Mrs. Jansen that. I think Julian referred to
something connected with Etcheverrey. Obviously, one might even
say."</p>

<p>"I'm always rather distrustful of the obvious," Pointer said
quietly. "You didn't see Mr. Clifford yesterday after
dinner?"</p>

<p>"No, I left Thornbush about nine and went to my rooms here,
where I changed, and drove down to my cottage at Weybridge. The
wood pigeons needed thinning out if any of my blue peas were to
be saved."</p>

<p>Now Pointer was a country boy. The gun taken, the cartridges
chosen, were such as a man would choose for this purpose. But, as
a rule, wood pigeons come and go between the hours of five and
nine of a July evening.</p>

<p>"Did you shoot many?" he asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"You mean this afternoon? I forgot to take my long-distance
glasses down with me. I am as blind as a bat a couple of yards
off. So, though I blazed away for half an hour or so, I only
succeeded in hitting one of my own decoys."</p>

<p>"But did you meet any friends at your cottage, Sir Edward?"
Pointert did not disguise the fact that he was questioning the
other, asking for his alibi.</p>

<p>Sir Edward did not seem to notice what he must have known lay
behind the questions.</p>

<p>"No, I never take friends down with me to Weybridge. I only go
to my cottage when I want to be alone. Driving down a tyre burst.
I had a spare wheel. By jogging along slowly I crawled to the
cottage on the rim, getting to Weybridge nearer one than ten. I
slipped in without waking my housekeeper or her husband, who acts
as my butler-valet. Everything I need is always put up ready for
me in the dining-room. Cold supper, electric kettle. So, as so
often before, I went to bed without any one in the house being
the wiser, after leaving a note on the hall table telling them at
what hour to serve breakfast."</p>

<p>"And the car?"</p>

<p>"My chauffeur put on a new wheel."</p>

<p>They drew up at Thornbush. Sir Edward Clifford rang the bell.
Mrs. Clifford was out, he was told, with Mr. Hobbs. Mr. Newman
was out too; so was Mr. Straight.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Trimble. I shall be in Mr. Clifford's
library with this gentleman." Sir Edward led Pointer quickly into
the room and tried a drawer. It was unlocked. From the back he
drew a sealed envelope addressed to himself. It was marked "The
Last Will and Testament of me, Julian Clifford."</p>

<p>"You think I had better open it?"</p>

<p>Pointer looked the envelope over with his glass. It had not
been tampered with. He handed it back.</p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p>Again a quiver passed over Sir Edward's face. It looked like
intense emotion as he read the address to himself. In other
words, it was just the look that a clever man would assume at
such a moment. And Sir Edward was considered clever in a quiet
way. He glanced it over.</p>

<p>"This is a new will. Made only some six months ago. I'm still
the sole executor and residuary legatee, but the bequest of ten
thousand which my brother told me he was leaving to Hobbs is
halved. Five thousand goes to Newman. And only five thousand to
Hobbs. To Newman 'if still unmarried' is the wording. A thousand
pounds he asks Mrs. Clifford to distribute among the servants as
she thinks fit. He adds, after some very moving words of
gratitude to her, that he leaves her nothing at her express wish,
as she strongly objects to inheriting anything from him on his
death, and is otherwise amply provided for."</p>

<p>He handed the will to Pointer, who read it through.</p>

<p>So Sir Edward was his brother's heir. And both he and the dead
man were believed to have loved the same woman, a woman whom her
husband's death would set free...</p>

<p>Pointer did not suspect Sir Edward Clifford, but no position,
however worthily won, no reputation for personal integrity, could
undo these facts.</p>

<p>"Five thousand seems a lot for Mr. Newman," was his only
comment.</p>

<p>"Umm...I don't suppose Julian ever expected it would be handed
over. There's not so much difference between them in years, you
know."</p>

<p>"There was no ill-will between Mr. Clifford and Mr. Hobbs, you
think?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. Simply Julian knew that Hobbs is doing
uncommonly well out of his literary commissions, and so on."</p>

<p>"May I copy out the gist of the will?" Pointer asked. He
wanted to stay on at Thornbush until Mrs. Clifford should
return.</p>

<p>Sir Edward nodded and sank heavily into a chair in a dark
corner.</p>

<p>Head on hand he sat there, apparently deep in thought. Pointer
too was thinking hard. He was busy with the will. So Mrs.
Clifford was left out of the will, and knew it. She did not
benefit in a monetary sense by her husband's death. Not in the
ordinary way. But Mrs. Clifford had cashed a cheque for seventy
thousand pounds as soon after her husband's murder as the banks
were open. To that extent, merely going by the facts, she had
benefited to the tune of a large fortune.</p>

<p>And the will gave Newman as well as Hobbs five thousand
pounds. Seeing that that young man was, as far as was known,
unmarried.</p>

<p>Curious proviso that. Yet both men lost their legacy, or could
not claim it, as long as Clifford's death remained uncertain.
Whoever had cut off Julian Clifford's head had believed that he
had rendered recognition of the corpse impossible. And Pointer,
though he had not an ounce of vanity in his nature, knew that
with nine out of ten detectives the ghastly device would have
succeeded.</p>

<p>He asked Sir Edward a few questions about the papers in the
desk as he looked them over. The other gave rather absent-minded
but apparently carefully truthful replies.</p>

<p>It was not far short of eleven when a ring came at the front
door. A voice, it sounded like Straight's, but if so it was tense
with excitement, asked if by any chance Sir Edward Clifford was
at Thornbush. The servant showed him in, Straight's usually
impassive face was working. He looked intensely, painfully
stirred.</p>

<p>"Can you get a message through to Mr. Clifford, Sir Edward?"
he asked in the same eager voice.</p>

<p>"No," Sir Edward said dully; "no, I can't. Why?"</p>

<p>"Miss Haslar wants him fetched if it's humanly possible. She's
just had an awful shock. Haslar's spoken. He's recovered
consciousness. I've come from his house. I had walked over to
find out if anything fresh had been found out. They fetched
Diana, who had gone to bed early&mdash;" Straight seemed to be
unable to continue.</p>

<p>"And what did Mr. Haslar say?" Pointer asked quietly, in that
steadying voice of his. He guessed what the injured man had said
from the perturbation which Straight showed.</p>

<p>"I was in the room, asking the night-nurse how Haslar was
doing, when he suddenly opened his eyes. 'Fetch Diana,' he said
quite rationally, only very feebly. The poor girl came on the
instant: she thought she was to receive some last word or message
of affection. But when she knelt clown beside his bed Haslar only
gave a fearful cry and struck at her. It was like a ghost trying
to strike. And he shrieked out, 'I did it all for nothing I've
killed Julian Clifford! There's his head. Take it away I Bury
it!' And with that he fell back dead. At least I think he's dead.
I rushed off for you, Sir Edward. They told me at your flat that
you were here. Diana insists that Mr. Clifford must come to
Arnold at once. She thinks it's the only thing that can save her
brother. Heaven knows why!"</p>

<p>Edward Clifford had risen and stood facing this unexpected
visitor.</p>

<p>"Arnold Haslar! Arnold Haslar!" There followed a silence short
but poignant. "Did <i>you</i> know this?" he asked, turning on
Pointer. "Did you know that it was Haslar who had killed my
brother? But what reason? What motive?"</p>

<p>It was Straight now who jumped.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clifford isn't killed. Haslar was delirious." The new
librarian at Thornbush looked as though the whole world had gone
mad. Pointer eyed his shoe-tips for a full second.</p>

<p>"We believe that the body found with its head cut off early
this morning in Heath Mansions is the body not of Etcheverrey,
but of Mr. Julian Clifford," he said finally.</p>

<p>Straight collapsed into a chair.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;!" He stopped and stared first at
Pointer, then at Sir Edward. "I <i>knew</i> it was delirium!" he
said, as though to himself. "For, of course, the man who murdered
Mr. Clifford murdered Arnold Haslar too!"</p>

<p>"There is a man who might have tried to kill both men,"
Pointer agreed, "a Major Cory."</p>

<p>"Cory!" Edward Clifford recognised the name on the instant.
"He certainly hated Julian, and with reason. You mean, of course,
the Major Cory of the Holford Will case. But where would Haslar
come in?"</p>

<p>"We know that Cory and Haslar knew each other," Pointer said
cautiously. "Here's his picture." He pulled it out of his pocket
and handed it to Straight. "It was taken some years ago, but it's
a good likeness. Did you happen to <i>see</i> this man at Mr.
Haslar's last night?"</p>

<p>But Straight had not seen whoever it was that had been
closeted with Arnold Haslar in his study when he had walked over
to Haslar's house after dinner at Thornbush. He explained that
Haslar had come out and asked him to wait a few moments, adding
that the caller wouldn't stay long.</p>

<p>After the man left, Arnold had spoken of going to a music hall
and a dance club afterwards, but he, Straight, thought his friend
was looking ill, and would be better for a quiet evening. As
Haslar was indignantly denying either looking ill, or any
intention of staying in, the telephone bell had rung. His friend
had gone back into his study&mdash;they were in the
library&mdash;and had listened to a rather long message. He had
hung up the receiver after saying grudgingly, "Very well; I'll be
there. But it's damned inconvenient." To Straight he had
explained that a very urgent business summons would take him out
of town for some hours. They arranged to postpone what had been
intended as a sort of welcome-back-to-England celebration for
himself till to-night.</p>

<p>"And to-night&mdash;" Straight began, when he turned to the
door. They heard the swish of a car driving up. A minute more and
Diana came flying in.</p>

<p>"Uncle Edward, where is Uncle Julian? You must tell me. I must
find him. If you don't know, Alison must speak."</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Haslar?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Tell him, Dick." For once Diana was not equal to a task.</p>

<p>"I have told them. They believe with me that the same&mdash;"
He stopped short.</p>

<p>"Uncle Edward, Arnold's raving! But if we could only find
Uncle Julian and bring him to his bedside&mdash;There she is.
That's Alison!" She ran out of the room again. Those inside,
openly listening, heard the front door open, heard Diana's quick,
feverish sentences telling Mrs. Clifford of what her brother
Arnold had just said.</p>

<p>"Of course Arnold was delirious. He was shot just after
reading that awful account in the paper about the headless man
found near us, and Uncle Julian being away, he has confused the
two all up as one does in a nightmare. But if Uncle Julian comes
at once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Diana dearest!" Mrs. Clifford was speaking in a very kind
tone as she came on into the room.</p>

<p>"You here, Edward? What have you been saying to frighten
Diana? Julian's safe and well, thank God. But I can't reach him,
Di, He gave no address in that note he left for me. But he said
he would be home in time for lunch on Thursday."</p>

<p>Her eyes went to Pointer.</p>

<p>"This is Chief Inspector Pointer of New Scotland Yard," Sir
Edward introduced him.</p>

<p>Pointer bowed.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you must prepare for bad news, Mrs. Clifford," he
said very quietly. "We of the police believe that an accident has
happened to Mr. Clifford."</p>

<p>"An accident?" For a second her colour, always pale, grew
whiter still. Then she recovered.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said confidently, "I should have known of it at
once. When do you think this&mdash;accident&mdash;happened to my
husband? Why do you think it is to Mr. Clifford?" She spoke with
an air of bearing with the stupidity of a child.</p>

<p>"The accident happened last night," Pointer said gravely. "It
was a mortal accident." Then he added, after a little pause, "The
body has been identified beyond any possibility of doubt, Mrs.
Clifford, by the finger-prints."</p>

<p>"But not as my husband's," she said with certainty.</p>

<p>"We believe," Pointer went on, "that a body found near here at
Heath Mansions this morning, and taken at first to be that of a
Basque anarchist, was really that of Mr. Julian Clifford. There
is no possibility of a mistake this time, I am sorry to say."</p>

<p>"Uncle Julian!" Diana gave a cry. "Uncle Julian!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford stared at Pointer, her head held very high. "A
body? Anarchist? You don't mean that headless body of which the
evening papers are full?"</p>

<p>Pointer said that he did mean that. Her eyes darkened to
green.</p>

<p>"What appalling nonsense!" she said indignantly. "Do you think
that I shouldn't have known immediately&mdash;felt it at
once&mdash;if anything had happened to him! How abysmally
ignorant you people are of the things of the spirit!" She turned
on her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"You too, Edward! You too think I wouldn't know! Julian will
laugh when he gets back on Friday!"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford," Pointer said solemnly, "from where he is,
there is no coming back."</p>

<p>Alison flushed a deep rose flush. She drew herself up.</p>

<p>"It's incredible! It's almost as though you all wished&mdash;"
Then she checked herself. "Forgive me," she turned to Edward
Clifford, "poor Edward, you look so worn! But your grief is all
for nothing. Julian is alive is well...is happy."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" Pointer asked, with something of sternness in
his voice.</p>

<p>She gave a careless twitch of her slender shoulder. "You will
know all in good time."</p>

<p>"I am afraid we must take our own measures then," Pointer
replied.</p>

<p>"You mustn't do anything that Julian wouldn't approve of when
he gets back," she said quickly. "Edward, I trust you to see to
that."</p>

<p>"I want to look into his money matters," Pointer said
slowly.</p>

<p>Alison Clifford started palpably.</p>

<p>"Certainly not! That is my cousin, Mr. Hobbs', affair. He is
my husband's literary agent. Julian would never forgive such a
thing. You must wait, Edward"&mdash;she spoke with
urgency&mdash;"Julian will be back by Friday."</p>

<p>"May I see the letter left for you this morning?" Pointer
asked. "I understand that a note was left for each person in the
house."</p>

<p>"I have destroyed my letter," the answer was instant, and Mrs.
Clifford left the room with an air of deep displeasure.</p>

<p>"How about you, Miss Haslar?" Pointer turned to the slender
figure shrinking, almost cowering back away from the others.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know where mine is," Diana said in a
strangled voice.</p>

<p>"Could you give us an idea of its contents?"</p>

<p>She seemed to force herself with difficulty to speech.</p>

<p>"It was only a line to say that Uncle Julian wanted to verify
some topographical point, that he would be back on Friday at
latest, and would I meanwhile go on with my grandfather's
letters."</p>

<p>"And dated?"</p>

<p>"It was dated yesterday." Diana had turned to Edward Clifford
while speaking. He avoided her eye.</p>

<p>So he believed that his brother was dead. He believed that
Arnold was responsible, that those wild words...</p>

<p>Suddenly she stepped up to Pointer, laid her hands on his arm,
and looked dumbly up into his face. An agonised question was in
her eyes. It would have been touching had it been any woman, but
from Diana Haslar that mute appeal was very moving.</p>

<p>"I see," she said hoarsely. "There is no hope. He is dead. Oh,
God!" It was a prayer, not a mere ejaculation.</p>

<p>Straight stepped forward as she made for the door and took her
hand. Sir Edward looked on with no softening lines of his set
mouth.</p>

<p>"I'd like a word with you, Mr. Straight, as soon as you've
seen Miss Haslar into her car," Pointer suggested.</p>

<p>Straight came back, looking years older than the young man
whom Sir Edward had met for the first time only last
Saturday.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Straight," Pointer began, "we know you've only just
landed in England, but it seems that Mr. Julian Clifford had
talked with you after dinner last night"&mdash;the gas man had
learnt that from the butler&mdash;"his last dinner. Did he seem
to have anything on his mind?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think he had," Straight said judicially. "Of course I
thought then that he probably was always a little
<i>distrait</i>."</p>

<p>"Julian was <i>distrait</i> at times," Edward Clifford
murmured, with what struck Pointer, as a rather wary look at
Straight.</p>

<p>"At any rate he was so then. Long silences. Just a word now
and then."</p>

<p>"And those words were about?" Pointer asked. And Edward
Clifford's face grew blankly inscrutable, as though he were
preparing to hear something which he might not like.</p>

<p>Straight did not reply on the instant. He looked as though he
were trying to think himself back to yesterday's quiet talk with
the man now lying dead.</p>

<p>"About my work. A little. He left an impression on my mind
that he would be shortly going away from Thornbush for a while,
though he didn't say so in so many words. He said something about
working out my own ideas. Especially not continuing exactly along
Newman's lines. Newman had been librarian as well as private
secretary, you know." Straight paused. "It's awkward to say now
that murder's been done, but Mr. Clifford struck me as&mdash;" He
paused, hesitated.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;as what?" came from Edward Clifford sharply.</p>

<p>"As afraid of Newman," Straight said simply.</p>

<p>"Julian afraid of Newman!" Sir Edward echoed
incredulously.</p>

<p>"It wasn't what he said," Straight said slowly, "it
was&mdash;his face? his voice? I don't know. But I thought so.
Yet, as far as I can remember, all he said was, 'I shouldn't go
to Newman more than I could help, if I were you.' I said
something about Newman seeming very willing to be of help, and he
gave me a queer look. A very queer look," Straight repeated
solemnly. "Struck me even then as such. 'Let's hope you'll find
him so to the end,' he replied, and again it was the tone that
was odder than the words. I repeated 'to the end, sir?' And after
a long silence he said very curtly, and in a very low voice, 'Mr.
Newman is leaving me. But that is strictly confidential. But now
you see why I should prefer you to find your own feet?' I forget
what I replied. And then he rose and joined Mrs. Clifford in the
walled garden. But just as he stepped over the sill, I thought he
was going to ask my advice about something&mdash;or wanted me to
help him in something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Julian!" repeated Edward Clifford, in palpable amazement.</p>

<p>"I'm only giving my impressions. And the impressions of a
stranger may be all wrong. But that's what I thought. I was going
to say something like 'Is there anything I can do?' But of course
I thought that if there was, he'd have said so."</p>

<p>Straight stopped. He looked as though half minded to say no
more, half inclined to add something to what he had said.</p>

<p>"Well?" Pointer prompted.</p>

<p>Still Straight hesitated. "It's rather difficult to go on. You
don't know me. I might be an imaginative chap...given to
romancing...I'm not. I'm the opposite. But you don't know
that."</p>

<p>"Well?" Pointer asked again.</p>

<p>"You'll think I've fear on the brain&mdash;but I thought Mr.
Clifford not at all keen on the short absence from Thornbush of
which he spoke. Or rather, to which he referred. The first time
was in the course of some directions as to what he wanted done.
He said&mdash;as nearly as possible&mdash;'I've a lot of foreign
books, most of which I don't care about, yet some of which are
quite worth having. Pick out those you would propose to keep.
Then leave the rest for me to look over. I may be away for a
short time from Thornbush, but I'll glance them over when I get
back.' There he stopped. There was a long silence. Then he said
to himself, '<i>when</i> I come back.' And his face and voice
sounded like a man very doubtful of his coming back. That was all
then. Another moment came in the course of a few words about
Australia, and travels in general. He said&mdash;after another
long silence&mdash;'Yes, travelling is pleasant. If you want to
go, and are sure you'll get back safely.' That's all I have to go
on. Just those two remarks. But both, and especially the latter,
sounded to me as though Mr. Clifford was nervous of something
that lay before him. I thought at the time, until just now, in
fact, that he must be a poor traveller, bad sailor, and so
on."</p>

<p>"Julian! Well, Straight, thank you for telling us this. You
certainly have surprised me." Sir Edward sounded genuinely amazed
and also a shade relieved, Pointer thought. "It's as unlike my
brother as though you had been talking of a stranger. I suppose
it really <i>was</i> Julian? You saw his face?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." Straight laughed at the idea of a substituted
Julian Clifford. "He sat on after dinner and went out into the
garden...joined you...I heard your voices dimly."</p>

<p>There was a little pause.</p>

<p>"And here," Straight rose, "is the note which I received,
ostensibly from Mr. Clifford, this morning." He handed a folded
piece of paper to Pointer.</p>

<p>"Did you keep it for any especial reason?" the Chief Inspector
asked, reading it.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;know," Straight said slowly. "I suppose I
should have kept it in any case, but&mdash;well, the note struck
me as odd."</p>

<p>"In what way 'odd?'"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;unlike his words of the evening before. Here he
tells me to turn to Hobbs and Newman."</p>

<p>Edward Clifford looked the letter over very carefully. It was
dated yesterday.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr.
Straight</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">A passage in my novel needs verification on the
spot. I expect, however, to be back at Thornbush by Friday. I
should like you to begin with the subject index as you planned.
Newman will give you any help in his power. So will Hobbs, of
course.</p>

<p class="letter">Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Julian Clifford</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>"You think this is Mr. Clifford's writing?" Pointer asked Sir
Edward.</p>

<p>"I should say so. Certainly. The very way the punctuation
marks are made is his. And that signature. It's on his own paper,
too."</p>

<p>It was more than that, thought Pointer. Like the additions to
the cheque, it was written with Julian Clifford's own pen, or its
exact mate. But as to whether the dead man had written
it&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you see Miss Haslar's note?" he asked Straight.</p>

<p>"Yes. She showed it me. Hers and mine were lying on the hall
table when I went out for a walk before breakfast. I noticed them
lying there along with two for Hobbs and Newman."</p>

<p>"She expressed no surprise at her letter?"</p>

<p>"None," Straight did not add that she had looked very uneasy
and had scanned it in silence more than once. Instead he said
good-night.</p>

<p>He left a profound silence behind him.</p>

<p>"His conversation with Mr. Straight&mdash;the tone of
it&mdash;was very unusual on Mr. Clifford's part?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"My brother must have been deeply disturbed," Edward Clifford
replied in the tone of a man taking swift mental soundings.
Pointer thought that some little part of what he had heard fitted
in, perhaps very badly, with something else. Edward Clifford,
supposing him to be honest, had not exclaimed at the idea of
Julian Clifford dreading his journey as he had at the idea of his
being afraid of his secretary.</p>

<p>"Afraid of Newman," he repeated again. "Amazing! Under
ordinary circumstances I should say Straight was romancing, but
as it is&mdash;!" He sighed profoundly. "Well, I have always
known that my brother's secretary is a queer fish. But this
throws a new, and a most sinister light on his queerness."</p>

<p>"In what way queer?" Pointer asked, as though Newman had
struck him as a type of the commonplace.</p>

<p>"In every way. Of course I know about his lost memory, and so
on, but I used to watch him very closely after Julian first took
him up, and I came to the conclusion that he didn't want his past
to come back to him. There are exercises, founded on the Freudian
theories, of getting into touch with the submerged half of the
mind. He never would allow them to be tried on him.
I&mdash;Well&mdash; frankly I sometimes doubted whether his
memory was entirely gone. And I'll tell you another person who
more than doubted, and that's Miss Haslar. She never said so, but
I'm sure of it. She distrusted Newman from the first, and
insisted that Julian was doing a foolish thing to keep him on.
But Julian was one of those men who, when they back a side, can
only see that side. He never backed it lightly, I'm bound to say.
But once his stand was definitely taken, nothing could shift
him."</p>

<p>"Could I speak to Mr. Newman?" Pointer asked. Sir Edward rang
the bell. But Mr. Newman was out. When had he left? Directly
after "this gentleman" had called to see him. About half-past
nine.</p>

<p>"This gentleman," otherwise Chief Inspector Pointer, rose as
soon as the door shut behind the servant.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8">CHAPTER 8</a></h2>

<p class="first">"I THINK we had better have a look at Mr.
Newman's rooms. Will you show me where they are?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>Sir Edward took him up. The secretary's bed-room presented a
scene of wild disorder. Coats and clothing had been flung here
and there. A bag stood half packed, and then abandoned. A gaping
suit-case too had been apparently discarded at the last moment as
too hampering.</p>

<p>"Flight!" Edward Clifford looked about him with a slow pallor
creeping over his face. "Does this mean that we're standing in
the room of the man who murdered my brother and mutilated his
body so horribly? If so, it'll be&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer said nothing. He was looking intently about him.</p>

<p>"If so"&mdash;Edward Clifford's tone changed: it
hardened&mdash;"if so, Chief Inspector, then that legacy was the
motive." He spoke in a quiet but authoritative voice. Pointer
wondered what other possibility he was definitely shutting
out.</p>

<p>"Five thousand pounds might tempt a poor man," Pointer
agreed.</p>

<p>"And, as you know, Newman has a salary of only two hundred and
fifty pounds a year. Ample, but not if he were of extravagant
tastes. If Newman killed my brother, there is no other motive
possible."</p>

<p>"It will be a shock to Mrs. Clifford, I'm afraid," Pointer
murmured, "I mean this apparent flight."</p>

<p>"A frightful one. She believed entirely in the man's good
faith. So much of a shock that I think it should be kept from her
for the present."</p>

<p>"If possible," Pointer said non-committally.</p>

<p>"I think it will be quite possible. But&mdash;if Newman is
guilty, what are we to think of Haslar's cry?"</p>

<p>"It's a very intricate case this, Sir Edward," Pointer said
thoughtfully, as he too glanced all around the room. "One step at
a time is all that we can hope for."</p>

<p>"I suppose Newman will be followed if he really has tried, as
this room suggests that he has, to escape?"</p>

<p>Pointer set his mind at rest. One of his best men was in
charge of Newman. He swiftly made up a parcel of the absent man's
clothing&mdash;a very complete parcel.</p>

<p>"They give us his measurements," he explained in answer to
Edward Clifford's inquiring stare. "Part of the regular routine.
You knew Mr. Newman well?"</p>

<p>"I lived at Thornbush for five months after he first came to
Mr. Clifford. While Cleave Ford was being fitted with central
heating."</p>

<p>"What about his time off? Regular time on which he could
count, I mean," Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"His evenings were generally his own. So were Saturdays as a
rule. And Sundays always."</p>

<p>"Do you know what he did in the evening, or over the week
end?"</p>

<p>"Evenings&mdash;I think he never went anywhere except to
Arnold Haslar's. He became tremendous friends with him from the
first. But on Sundays he vanished utterly and completely. We used
to chaff him about it until we saw that he didn't like it much."
Sir Edward stopped.</p>

<p>Pointer had stepped to the fireplace. All the grates at
Thornbush were concealed by handsome, wrought-iron double doors
like small casement windows inset within the marble of the
fireplace. It was the neatest way of dealing with small stoves,
or grates, that Pointer knew. He believed it to be a Belgian
idea. At least, he had often come across it in Brussels. He now
opened the little doors and stooping down, felt the bars. Then
his eye travelled up the wall. He stepped quickly into the
bathroom, and came out with a small nickel shaving-cup in his
hand. He detached a water-colour picture from the wall. Then he
dragged a table across the fireplace, placed a chair on it, and
stepping lightly up, held the picture, glass-side up, as a tray,
while he gently blew something on to it off the picture
rail&mdash;a small wisp of charred paper, so black that no
writing showed on its thin film. Then he drew out the cup from
his pocket and carefully turned it down over the fragment,
holding it all very level as he stepped down on to the floor, and
put it on the table.</p>

<p>"Mr. Newman burnt something in that grate. The bar is still
warm. Nothing big. He crushed it all into fragments, but this one
bit must have escaped his notice and blown up there. I'll send a
man with it and Mr. Newman's clothes to the Yard at once. We may
learn something from them."</p>

<p>From below came the sound of a banged door. And then
another.</p>

<p>"That must be Hobbs." Clifford listened for a moment. "He must
be told, of course; about Newman, I mean. But I think Mrs.
Clifford should be kept in ignorance of what has happened. After
all, Newman may return to the house. It's just possible that this
room does not mean what it seems to mean. Don't you think so,
Chief Inspector?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he'll come back," Pointer said thoughtfully,
following Clifford down the stairs and into the library, after
handing his parcel to his chauffeur, and placing the cup and
picture with extreme care in an attaché case which he strapped
over an air cushion on a collapsible table in the car.</p>

<p>Julian Clifford's literary agent was standing with his legs
far apart, swaying slightly. He looked savagely up at them as
they entered.</p>

<p>"Well, what d'ye want?" was his greeting. "What's up now?"</p>

<p>Clifford looked at him with thinly veiled disgust. The man had
been drinking.</p>

<p>"Something has happened to Julian," was Sir Edward's short
reply.</p>

<p>Hobbs stared. White streaks like dead fingers showed on his
cheeks. He seemed trying to pull himself together.</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean?" he asked a trifle less surlily. "I thought I
told you..."</p>

<p>"He's been killed&mdash;murdered." Edward Clifford could be
terse too. "This is Chief Inspector Pointer of New Scotland Yard.
He's investigating the case."</p>

<p>Hobbs's dropped jaw all but prevented his nodding to Pointer.
He certainly looked an amazed man.</p>

<p>"It was his body that was found near here in Heath Mansions
this morning. That headless body." Edward Clifford gulped at
those last horrid words.</p>

<p>Hobbs seemed sobered. His face grew mealy white. He was a
handsome enough man in a big, burly way. He seemed to shrink a
little now.</p>

<p>"I say, this is going too fast! How do you know if it has no
head&mdash;how do you know it's Julian?"</p>

<p>"There is no doubt possible," Pointer assured him. "And now
Mr. Hobbs, would you mind explaining just where you thought Mr.
Clifford was when you assured an official of the Home Office this
morning that he was collecting local colour, probably in
Liverpool?"</p>

<p>Edward Clifford was looking intently at Hobbs. Hobbs looked
back at him. A blank, non-committal look. And yet he sent a
message to the other.</p>

<p>"I thought he had gone, as he so often does, for literary
material. But I can't grasp this awful news It's incredible.
Surely there's been some mistake. If his head is off, I repeat
how can you be sure it's Julian's body?"</p>

<p>Pointer explained about the identified finger-prints.</p>

<p>"And the thickened finger-joint is his. So's the scar on the
sole of the foot," Edward Clifford finished.</p>

<p>"You're absolutely certain it's Julian?" Hobbs asked, biting
his lip.</p>

<p>"Certain? Absolutely," the dead man's brother assured him.</p>

<p>Hobbs grew paler yet.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it!" he said thickly. "I can't realise it."
Suddenly he straightened up.</p>

<p>"My God! Haslar was all but murdered too!" He turned a white,
wild face from one to the other. "What does it mean? Why these
two?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hobbs," Pointer asked again, instead of replying, "where
did you think that Julian Clifford was? Have you no idea where he
might be expected to be, supposing he had really gone away of his
own free will yesterday morning?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," Hobbs said promptly&mdash;a shade too
promptly. He looked hard at Sir Edward.</p>

<p>There was a silence. Pointer noticed that Edward Clifford did
not seem any more anxious to question Hobbs than he had been to
question Straight, though he listened with an even more strained
attention.</p>

<p>"Have you had any unusual visitors at Thornbush lately?"
Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" Hobbs looked this time hard at the detective
officer. "There was a man&mdash;refused to give his
name&mdash;asked for Newman. Saturday morning around twelve.
Newman was out. He then asked for me by name. I had him shown in,
of course. Didn't care for the look of him. Wrong 'un, if ever
there was one. Ex-cavalryman type. He talked on about his
admiration for Clifford's works and that. I thought he wanted to
sell me a typewriter, or get some translation rights for nothing,
he was so vague. Finally he asked to see Clifford himself. I said
Clifford never saw any one without an appointment. He said, 'Tell
him I'm come from Haslar. Mr. Arnold Haslar. Then he'll see
me.'"</p>

<p>There was a pause in the narrative. Hobbs looked as though he
were trying to be very exact in his account.</p>

<p>"Did Julian see him?" Edward Clifford asked at last.</p>

<p>"What! Disturb him of a morning! I didn't send in any message,
of course. I went out into the dining-room and marked time with a
sandwich. Then I reported that Mr. Clifford regretted that he was
unable to see Mr.&mdash;&mdash;I waited for the name. None came.
So I went on, 'Unless Mr.&mdash;&mdash;' &mdash;another pause,
but still no name forthcoming&mdash;would state his errand. Did
you say I came from Haslar?' he asked. I assured him I had
forgotten nothing. He looked rather taken aback, I thought, gave
me a look over as though he was about to propose something shady.
If so, he decided against it. Hesitated for another moment, and
said sneeringly, '<i>You</i> don't seem to be much in Mr.
Clifford's confidence,' and left, knocking his hat over one
ear."</p>

<p>"Was this the man you saw?" Pointer produced the photograph of
Cory.</p>

<p>"That's the man."</p>

<p>"Did he say nothing else?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing of any importance. Nothing I remember. But the
emphasis on the 'you' made me wonder if he thought some one else
knew more&mdash;of whatever his errand was."</p>

<p>"Newman?" asked Edward Clifford 'sharply. Hobbs said nothing,
but his silence was a "yes."</p>

<p>"But you know," he went on, after another pause, during which
he stood again jingling some change in his pocket, "I don't think
a shady caller had anything to do with Clifford's murder. We have
too many of them. I think"&mdash;he hesitated, and drummed on the
mantel-shelf&mdash;"well what I told you in the train, Edward. I
met Sir Edward in the train by accident this afternoon," Hobbs
explained to Pointer, "and told him that I think Julian Clifford
has a separate establishment somewhere."</p>

<p>Edward Clifford looked intensely indignant.</p>

<p>"Impossible! I repeat, quite impossible!"</p>

<p>"Why so?" Hobbs jingled some keys in his pocket. "He was away
from home pretty frequently. Why impossible?"</p>

<p>"The idea is quite untenable to any one who knew the plane of
life on which Julian lived." Edward Clifford spoke with apparent
sincerity.</p>

<p>"And where do you think this establishment was?" Pointer asked
quietly.</p>

<p>"Not an earthly," was the prompt reply. "But I've thought it
for some time."</p>

<p>"Any reason for the suspicion?"</p>

<p>"Human nature. My cousin Alison would bore any husband stiff,"
Hobbs said in a contemptuous undertone to Clifford, who looked at
him as at a reptile.</p>

<p>"We'll discuss this matter to-morrow when you're more
yourself," he said in an icy tone, turning away as though hardly
able to trust himself to look at the insolent grin on Hobbs's
face.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Orr is a widow, I understand?" Pointer said, apparently
out of the blue.</p>

<p>Edward Clifford looked, if possible, more indignant than ever;
but he listened for Hobbs's reply. It did not come for a full
minute. And then Hobbs said in a thick, low voice, hoarse with
passion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's Mrs. Orr to do with this? I was speaking of a possible
separate establishment of Julian's. Not of friends of himself and
his wife."</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. Hobbs, one question," Pointer went on coolly,
"where were you last night from, say, ten onwards?"</p>

<p>"I went out to post a letter at ten or half-past," Hobbs said
easily enough. "I was talking with Mrs. Clifford and writing at
the same time, till my cousin went up to bed. Then, as I said, I
went out to post a letter, found it a marvellous summer night.
Came back and sat on in the garden for a while, then went to bed.
It was just short of twelve when I wound up my watch. This
morning I found I'd caught a chill out under the trees. When I
got down about eleven I found a letter for me from
Julian&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You kept that letter?"</p>

<p>"Don't think so. I'll look, of course; but, as a rule, I never
keep any but important letters."</p>

<p>"Did you hear or see anything of Mr. Clifford before you went
to bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard him in his library, I thought. I feel certain I
left him there when I went out to post the letter. Afterwards I
didn't come through the house at once. By the time I went up to
bed all was dark downstairs."</p>

<p>He was not able, or appeared not to be able, to add anything
more except just as he was turning away. "Wait a bit&mdash;I seem
to remember a telephone ringing in the library as I sat talking
to Mrs. Clifford. I have a fancy that I heard Clifford reply.
That's what made me certain he was there when I went out."</p>

<p>"You can't remember any words of his reply?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"Not a syllable. We were talking at the moment."</p>

<p>"Though you may not remember the words, have you no idea of
the manner of his reply? Was it friendly? or was it business-like? or was it annoyed at all?"</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't swear to it, but I have a hazy notion that
he was rather impatient. Not like Julian to be that. But I don't
think I've mixed it up with any other time." He rubbed his face
wearily.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go for a walk now, and see if the fresh air
won't help my head. This has been an awful shock. What about
Alison?"&mdash;he was speaking to Edward Clifford.</p>

<p>"Frightful!" Sir Edward said under his breath. "When she's
convinced of the truth it may well kill her."</p>

<p>"What will kill her will be not having known that anything had
happened to Julian, when she was seeing him alive and well in her
crystal," Hobbs said callously, and turning, left the two
together.</p>

<p>Pointer thought that Sir Edward would have liked to follow him
out, but if so, the latter checked the impulse.</p>

<p>"I must let Tindall know at once of Newman's flight. He'll be
in his rooms at this hour." Sir Edward reached for the telephone
and passed on the news.</p>

<p>"He's coming as soon as he can get here." He hung up the
receiver. "But a word about Hobbs. You don't suspect him, do
you?"</p>

<p>Pointer did not reply.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't," Clifford said firmly. "Hobbs is far too
shrewd a business man to be a criminal. As a literary agent my
brother considered him unequalled."</p>

<p>He was not too good a business man to drink, nor to have a
very dangerous temper, was Pointer's private comment on that. But
he said nothing.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately he's developing a habit which will be the ruin
of him unless he checks it," Edward Clifford went on, "a habit of
taking more than is good for him. But he's not a criminal. On the
other hand, he's a man who lives a fast, careless life. That idea
of his about my brother's absences"&mdash;Edward curled his
lip&mdash;"put it quite out of your head, Chief Inspector.
Anything dishonourable would be impossible to&mdash;" And then
Edward Clifford came to a full stop. He flushed scarlet.
"Er&mdash;er&mdash;his private life was absolutely exemplary." He
finished hastily, and getting up began to walk up and down the
room, apparently getting deeper and deeper into a brown
study.</p>

<p>Pointer was certain that Julian Clifford was engaged in
something not strictly legal when he had met his death. It had
seemed a strange thing of which to suspect the great author. But
there was his odd question to Astra. There was Hobbs...Hobbs knew
something, or thought that he did. So did Mrs. Clifford. Edward
Clifford's flush of just now, all bore out the same idea.
Besides, though he was apparently grief-stricken at his brother's
terrible fate, he also seemed absolutely without any ideas as to
how, and where, the search for the murderer should be started. He
was as one lost in bewildered helplessness. Pointer had come to
the conclusion that Sir Edward did not want the circumstances of
Julian Clifford's death probed, except as they concerned
Etcheverrey. He either knew, or feared, that any other line of
inquiry would open up painful details&mdash;painful to the
living. He must have some reason for this. It was not one that
would have occurred offhand to any reader of Julian Clifford's
lofty books. He had turned down Hobbs's idea of an intrigue, with
scorn. But what other idea did he hold himself?</p>

<p>Pointer had believed at first that if he could find the head
of Julian Clifford and establish the identity of the murdered man
beyond question, that he would get all the members of his family
to speak, and so come on the clue to this most strange death. But
not if this idea were right. In that case, even then, he could
look for no help from the Thornbush circle. Nothing would bring
back the dead, they would argue. Pointer knew how egoistic people
can be when it is a question of a family scandal. Better, they
would think, that ten murderers escaped than that one just man
should have cause to wince. Pointer did not agree. But that being
the case, the whereabouts of Julian Clifford's head faded into
the second place beside the question of what the writer had been
doing, what planning, what other interests he had, besides his
interest in Etcheverrey?</p>

<p>How could he, Pointer, locate the place where Clifford was
supposed to be, if he were honestly supposed to be alive? That
vision of him in her crystal which Mrs. Clifford had thought that
she saw, or had pretended to see...Houses with "gables like
steps" mounting into heaven. He believed that those words had
really slipped out. If so, they might help to orient the search.
But how could the Chief Inspector get on the track of those
gables? Where were such gables? English they were not. Nor
Basque. Nor French. Nor Spanish. Pointer ran through a long list
of the impossibles. Yet apparently they were in the street where
Mrs. Clifford thought that her husband was&mdash;supposing her to
be innocent.</p>

<p>Tindall was shown in.</p>

<p>"So the secretary's run away! Being trailed, of course."</p>

<p>Pointer said that he sincerely hoped so.</p>

<p>"Can I see his room?" Tindall surveyed the wild scene
thoughtfully. Then he returned to the two men in the library. He
closed the door carefully, even though a detective was on duty in
the hall.</p>

<p>"Sir Edward, a thought has been growing in my mind since you
'phoned. What about Newman being the man we're after? Being
Etcheverrey himself? This idea would link Clifford and Haslar for
certain, and doubtless Cory. We have learnt that worry and
depression were common to both Mr. Clifford and Haslar these last
weeks. It was common to both of them, because it sprang from a
common cause&mdash;from Newman. You know, Sir Edward, you
believed that Etcheverrey might be hiding in some quite
commonplace identity. How about that identity being your
brother's secretary?"</p>

<p>Sir Edward had wheeled, and now stood staring at him.</p>

<p>"What a possibility!" He seemed to consider it. "It's a
brilliant guess. What ghastly irony, if so, that I myself should
have spoken of my idea before him. Let me see...When Etcheverrey
was in Persia, Julian was in Australia. Just he and Mrs.
Clifford&mdash;over six months away. Hobbs worked on as usual,
but Newman took a holiday for the whole time. It was the winter.
He was supposed to be in Rome looking up facts for Clifford about
the Fascist suppression of newspapers...And then that time when
the Prince was in South America...that wouldn't fit Newman, but,
of course, he may have worked through an agent more often than is
believed. The attempt on the King of Spain&mdash;yes. Newman was
free then. Julian thought him climbing in the Lake district. I
must go into this in more detail with Hobbs, and check dates.
What do you say, Chief Inspector?"</p>

<p>"If I thought Newman were really Etcheverrey himself," Pointer
said slowly, "I should be inclined to wonder if Mr. Clifford were
not trying to bring him into some book of his, and in trying, had
not got nearer to the truth than Etcheverrey liked...Nearer to
publishing it, I mean. Just now, Sir Edward, you told me that the
central drawer of his writing table contained Mr. Clifford's work
of the day, the finished chapters being in the left-hand drawers,
the notes for the future parts, or for the whole, in the right-hand ones. I took the liberty of glancing at the contents of the
middle drawer"&mdash;for the second time, he might have added.
"Mr. Clifford has apparently stopped at the very last line of a
page and in the middle of a sentence. Of course I don't know, but
I should have thought that an author would finish a sentence,
especially this one. It runs: 'Roberts felt that the'&mdash;I
can't imagine even a boy in school of a summer day when the bell
rang leaving a sentence hung up like that. And Mr. Clifford has a
pile of untouched manuscript paper in the same drawer."</p>

<p>"My brother would have finished writing down his thought while
the boat sank beneath him!" breathed Edward Clifford tensely.
"But the remainder of the sentence&mdash;the next page&mdash;may
be in a blotter." Hurriedly he led the way into the room where he
had handed Pointer the will. He pulled open the central
drawer.</p>

<p>There, in a neat pile, lay Chapter nine of <i>The Soul of
Ishmael</i>. There lay the third page with its typing running
down to the very margin of the lowest edge. As Pointer had said,
it ended with the unfinished sentence, Beside it was a carbon
copy. It, too, showed no further pages.</p>

<p>Tindall and Sir Edward hunted skilfully, minutely, as men hunt
who are used to searching for papers. Neither they, nor the Chief
Inspector, found any completion of the phrase. Apparently Julian
Clifford had stopped his typewriter at "the" and never touched it
again.</p>

<p>"Some one his taken the page, or pages, following!" Edward
Clifford muttered, as he straightened the piles again; "Newman
probably."</p>

<p>Pointer was examining a sheet of carbon paper in front of a
mirror.</p>

<p>"Here's proof or at least strong presumptive evidence of the
fact that there were more pages on that pile. That sheet there is
page three. Here are a whole bunch of superimposed numbers,
that's certainly an eighteen. Mr. Clifford is hardly likely to
have torn up so many pages?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. He worked page by page, not leaving one until
it was perfect in his eyes. I wonder"&mdash;Sir Edward tapped the
table nervously&mdash;"if it was his next chapter for the
<i>Arcturus</i>. If so, it would be nearly finished by now, I
fancy. He was never behind with his work. Where's the last
<i>Arcturus</i>?" He spun round on his heel and pulled the
monthly in question out of a revolving bookstand. "Yes. Chapter
eight was the last. What can you make out on the carbon sheet,
Chief Inspector?"</p>

<p>Pointer explained that chemicals and photographs would get the
full value. As it was, he could only read a few sentences.
Tindall, more experienced at such work, did a little better, but
he soon flung it down.</p>

<p>"That all takes place in England! That's no good!" Then a
moment later he gave an exclamation that brought Pointer and
Clifford to his side. He held up a slip of paper with some
sentences scribbled on it. They were in Julian Clifford's small,
close writing.</p>

<p>He read them aloud.</p>

<p>"'Have Roberts next go to Capvern, and meet E. Join E.'s
band&mdash;England having become dangerous. Get necessary details
as to organisation of E.'s band.' There we are!" Tindall waved
the paper in front of Sir Edward, who nearly snatched at it, and
then tried to read it upside down. He nodded when he had scanned
it.</p>

<p>"Get necessary details as to organisation of E.'s band," he
repeated. "Julian's way, when a thought occurred to him, was to
jot it down on the 'first thing that came to hand which he would
drop into that drawer. Unfortunately he never made any rough
drafts. Still, I think your discovery, Chief Inspector, about the
unfinished sentence, is vital. Vital! How did you come to look
for it? For, after all, these sheets were under a pile of unused
paper."</p>

<p>"It was only natural," Pointer said diffidently. Praise always
made him shy. "When a jeweller's been killed, you think at once
of jewels in his possession. If it's a banker, you turn to his
bank first of all. Or a statesman&mdash;you think of state
papers. In each case you ask yourself, what was peculiar to the
man. In Mr. Julian Clifford's case it was his books, his writing;
so, merely as a matter of routine, I looked at his manuscript, or
rather his typescript."</p>

<p>"It was a master-inspiration!" Sir Edward repeated. "Let me
see," he mused, "I wonder if Bancroft could help us. He's
Julian's publisher. I'll see him at once to-morrow. I'll explain
that I'm worried about Julian"&mdash;Sir Edward's face
twitched&mdash;"and that I wonder whether in his talks with
Bancroft he suggested going to any particular spot."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's where Mrs. Clifford thinks her husband is!" broke
in Tindall, with the air of a man who has solved the riddle to
his own satisfaction. "Investigating some part of the Basque
country. He would, of course, ask her not to speak of his
whereabouts. Pointer, well played again!" He turned to the
detective officer with the words that used to echo from one side
of the football ground to the other in the days before Pointer
joined the Force.</p>

<p>"And the gables that I think may have been in Mrs. Clifford's
mind, the gables that she therefore 'saw' in the crystal? The
gables that climbed into heaven like steps?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Basque houses have so varied an architecture quite apart from
their own," Tindall reminded him. "Many of them, when they return
home, build something in the style of the country where they made
their money. But now about this idea of yours. I think we shall
score this time. Team work does it. That, of course, was why Mr.
Clifford asked Mrs. Jansen the question about possible danger.
Playing with dynamite wasn't in it with probing too deeply into
Etcheverrey's organisation, or into his past."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Julian suspected the truth, or what we believe to
have been the truth, at the end?" Clifford said, coming out of a
deep reverie. "If so, that would explain why he wanted quietly to
get rid of his private secretary, why he warned the new librarian
of Newman. He might well! Poor Julian, he might well! And if only
suspicious, Julian would not speak of it to any one&mdash;least
of all to me&mdash;about a man who might be innocent, who might
really have lost his memory."</p>

<p>"That lost memory was a master-stroke," Tindall murmured
appreciatively. "Now I'll confess something that's been
disturbing. me not a little." Clifford shot a glance at Pointer.
"Julian asked me about"&mdash;he seemed to think a
moment&mdash;"about two months ago, how one could best make a
large payment to a foreigner in such a way that it couldn't be
traced back to oneself. I naturally showed surprise. I suggested
letters of credit, but he insisted that the money must be
untraceable. I couldn't help him with any advice. Bonds to bearer
seemed the only way out, since he said that a large sum of money
might be in question. But when I pressed him as to what he was up
to, he looked at me thoughtfully and finally said that I had
better know nothing whatever about the matter.</p>

<p>"I confess I asked no more. I was startled, uneasy. No one
likes to hear a member of his own family put questions like
those. No one occupying a responsible post in the country, that
is. Not with the Labour Party always ready to sling mud at us. I
confess I thought of a subsidised paper for distribution in
Italy&mdash;to be printed in Switzerland, independent of Fascist
censure. Julian had some such idea in his mind, I know. I was, of
course, strongly opposed to it. But now I see that he was
probably thinking of Etcheverrey or some lieutenant of his.
Perhaps that was partly in Hobbs's mind when he talked to me this
afternoon in the train. He told me that he believed Julian was
away on an errand which it might be as well not to investigate.
He told me that, apropos of a man from the Home Office who had
called at Thornbush this morning. A man called
Marbury&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer bowed with a faint smile. "I was Marbury."</p>

<p>"Hobbs said that he hoped he would not insist on investigating
where Clifford really was. Warned me that he was afraid that
Julian had got mixed up in something&mdash;well, something of
which it might be as well not to speak in the market-place at the
moment. Then he even suggested, as he did again before you, that
Julian was mixed up in some vulgar intrigue."</p>

<p>Edward Clifford took a turn up the room and back.</p>

<p>"That discovery of the Chief Inspector's about the
page&mdash;his idea about the coming revelations in Julian's
novel&mdash;they do indeed open up vistas. Julian lunched with
Bancroft only last week, I know. I know too that he talked very
freely with his publishers. Bancroft may have some precious piece
of information to give us to-morrow. You'll come with me, of
course, Tindall, and you too, I hope, Chief Inspector."</p>

<p>But Pointer could not promise. He arranged for a telephone
report in case he were detained.</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Clifford in the habit of talking over what he was
writing? In his own home, I mean?"</p>

<p>"As far as I know, never. He liked to get away from his work
in his leisure hours. But, of course, to his secretary he would
doubtless refer to his work. Probably discuss it&mdash;dreadful
thought&mdash;with him."</p>

<p>"And the person who took the remaining page or pages of the
chapter that Clifford was writing"&mdash;Tindall was deep in
conjectures&mdash;"would be that same private secretary, who, if
we're right&mdash;as we most certainly are&mdash;was the very
character that Clifford was about to introduce. Newman may have
sent that telephone message to Clifford which Hobbs thinks he
heard. The message might easily have asked Clifford to come to
Fourteen Heath Mansions to meet some one whom Newman might have
assured Clifford was an expert Basque scholar. But an invalid,
say. Yes, that all fits in quite well into the known facts."</p>

<p>"And Haslar?" Edward Clifford frowned, "what was Haslar's
rôle?"</p>

<p>"Haslar," Tindall replied thoughtfully, "was, we know, or
rather is, supposed to be a great friend of Newman's. He may be,
instead, merely his tool or his prisoner. But Haslar, we may take
it, acting according to his instructions, takes the flat."
Tindall paused, evidently getting together some more straw for
his next brick. "Cory&mdash;like a vulture, his presence with
both men means that something's wrong, he's the very emblem of
death throughout&mdash;Cory who was to figure as Captain
Brown...as the Basque expert, perhaps"&mdash;Tindall's cheeks
were flushed as he reconstructed his scene&mdash;"Cory, we learn
from Hobbs, was sent on Saturday morning to Thornbush to get a
general idea of Mr. Clifford. Perhaps he was to invite Mr.
Clifford to Fourteen Heath Mansions then. At any rate, that fell
through. Etcheverrey miscalculated there. Or Cory outran his
instructions. But about Haslar&mdash;are we to take Haslar's
ravings as merely empty words? Or have they a substratum of
fact?" He addressed this directly to Pointer.</p>

<p>"Not as empty words, merely," Pointer thought decidedly. "I
believe the relations between Mr. Clifford and Mr. Haslar have
been a little strained of late?" he asked, turning to Sir
Edward.</p>

<p>"They have seen less of each other," Edward Clifford allowed.
"Like Hobbs, Haslar is prone to put the worst construction on the
most innocent things. My brother was interested as a character in
a coming novel, in a friend of the Haslars. In the Mrs. Orr whom
you mentioned, and whom, for once, Hobbs had the grace to defend.
Arnold Haslar took it upon himself to resent my brother's
interest."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Haslar was in love with the lady," Pointer
suggested artlessly.</p>

<p>"Very likely. But as my brother was in love with his own wife,
he need have had no fears on that score," Edward Clifford replied
curtly.</p>

<p>There was a short silence broken dreamily by Tindall, still at
his weaving. "Was Newman's the hand that actually fired the shot
at Haslar? What do you say, Chief Inspector?" He wished that
Pointer would join a little more freely in the discussion. After
all, though not the Foreign Office, the Yard does good
work&mdash; quite good work.</p>

<p>Pointer told the facts of Newman's probable visit to Haslar's
house as revealed by his tiny vacuum sweeper. But he made no
comment on them. Instead he seemed to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Apart altogether from his own work, did Mr. Clifford have any
papers or letters in his possession which Mr. Haslar wanted, or
may have wanted?" he asked unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Sir Edward stared.</p>

<p>"Papers? Letters? I don't quite see...Oh, yes, of course, Cory
made you think of that! No, I don't see how there could be any
such question here, Chief Inspector," Clifford said decisively.
"Certainly I know of none such."</p>

<p>"I think Etcheverrey may have played one of his very clever
games. May have got Haslar to choose Cory without explaining why
he wanted him," Tindall said now. "Etcheverrey would count on
Cory exceeding his instructions. Suppose Clifford were handed
over to him, as it were."</p>

<p>Sir-Edward made a gesture that looked like uncontrollable
anguish.</p>

<p>"Etcheverrey may have counted on Cory taking his revenge,"
Tindall went on gently but remorselessly, "being a Basque,
revenge would be the first thing he himself would take in Cory's
place. I think&mdash;so far&mdash;that Haslar took the flat with
no intention of harming Clifford, simply acting under orders. Who
knows what trumped-up reason was given him. That of the Basque
friend, say. Haslar takes the flat, Etcheverrey as Newman lures
Clifford there, Cory is told to kidnap Clifford. He does just
what Etcheverrey counts on his doing: he shoots Clifford. Shoots
him, as Cory would shoot him, from the back. Haslar falls ill.
When he sees the evening papers to-day with the account of
Etcheverrey's supposed murder, he guesses the truth. When Newman
comes in he knows it. He tells Newman that he must confess.
Newman tries to murder him and practically succeeds. I think that
is a workable hypothesis. Even those torn-up pieces of paper with
Etcheverrey's signature on it which you boggle at"&mdash;he
turned to Pointer&mdash;"fall into line. Etcheverrey, safely
ensconced at Thornbush, left them as a true, yet false trail. For
they led directly away from Thornbush. As for the head&mdash;my
new hypothesis may be a trifle weak there yet." Tindall looked
almost wistfully at Pointer, who was staring at his own shoe-tips.</p>

<p>"I wonder," Pointer said suddenly, "if you would allow a
chartered accountant to go through Mr. Clifford's accounts, Sir
Edward?"</p>

<p>Clifford stared. "You think&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I think they ought to be very carefully looked into," Pointer
said, rising, "merely as a matter of routine, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I see. Of course. I heard my brother say, by the
way, that Straight was a chartered accountant before he took up
librarian's work."</p>

<p>"Good. Perhaps you would see him about it. I would like it
done as soon as possible. The thing can't be done secretly, of
course, since the accounts are under Mr. Hobbs, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Entirely. As I told you, Julian was more than satisfied with
him. Besides having a splendid knowledge of where to place work,
he's a wonder with figures. He was Third Wrangler, you know."</p>

<p>And on that Pointer took his leave.</p>

<p>"Fine fellow, Pointer," Tindall said, as the door closed. "One
of the best brains at Scotland Yard. Quite a marvel for his
years, but the police routine sets its seal on a man's mind. They
can't get away from it." And he plunged into the necessary steps
to be taken to follow up and prove his theory.</p>

<p>Pointer meanwhile drove back to his own rooms at Scotland
Yard. Night and day were but figures of speech to him when need
was. Various men had been routed out of bed and some modern magic
as soon as his car had reached Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>When Sir Humphry Davy saved the papyri of Pompeii, he blazed
the trail he blazed the trail for the treatment of all charred
papers, though that trail has turned many a corner since
then.</p>

<p>In this instance the paper was heated again and photographed
the second before it crumbled to a white ash. Charred paper so
heated gives off minute quantities of gas which fog certain
specially prepared plates. Ink, however invisible to the naked
eye, acts like a screen between the paper and the camera,
shutting off the action of the gases, so that when developed the
plate is foggy except in the places marked with ink.</p>

<p>Pointer was finally handed a photograph of that small island
of salvaged paper, which a touch would have turned into black
dust, on which now he read</p>

<pre> I know the danger discovered your secret wife </pre>

<p>The last word was very doubtful. It might have been
<i>knife</i> or <i>life</i>. The writing and the paper and the
ink were all those of Julian Clifford.</p>

<p>Pointer sat for a second lost in meditation. Tindall would be
pleased to see this. He had a copy sent over to his flat.</p>

<p>Compared with this feat, the deciphering of the carbon paper
was child's play. Heated, treated, rolled, photographed,
enlarged, one of Pointer's men had typed page after page from it&mdash;ten pages in all&mdash;with only here and there a blank word. Evidently Clifford used a very good brand of carbon paper. It showed that there had been twenty pages in all, finishing the
chapter. As Tindall had thought, they were entirely concerned
with England, but copies would none the less be sent to him and
Sir Edward, along with the copies of the two sentences extracted
from the burnt paper that had flown up on to Newman's picture
rail.</p>

<p>Then Pointer turned to another report, concerning Newman's
clothes, which he had sent to the Yard at the same time. These
had one by one been put into as many paper bags, sealed, beaten,
and the dust then microscopically examined.</p>

<p>A certain gray waistcoat had yielded, among other usual
trifles such as cigarette dust, lead pencil dust, quite a
knob&mdash; microscopically speaking&mdash;of fiddler's rosin,
more properly called colophane; a rosin, that is, which is used
by violinists to give their bows more bite on the strings. The
analyst had added a note to say that this special rosin was
"black rosin," such as is used exclusively by players of the
double bass.</p>

<p>The microscope had also found on the knob several bits of very
fine quality Wilton carpet wool of a deep, soft blue. In other
words, the waistcoat had been worn by some one who played the
double bass in a room where there was a blue Wilton pile carpet.
The same message came from one of the coat sleeves.</p>

<p>So Newman played the double bass. It suited his grave face,
his slender hands and wrists, that Pointer thought looked made of
whipcord.</p>

<p>Double bass and blue carpet...</p>

<p>It was not an address, but it was something.</p>

<p>An inquiry over the telephone brought confirmation of the
terrible words gasped out by Haslar to his sister. Words heard by
the night nurse as well. But Haslar was not yet dead. He still
breathed. Pointer's plain-clothes man added that he himself was
sitting in the room behind a screen.</p>

<p>And finally there came yet another message for the Chief
Inspector before he left the Yard.</p>

<p>It was from a very unhappy wight, who explained that he had
lost Newman&mdash;lost him hopelessly.</p>

<p>"Clever of you, Black," Pointer murmured. "How did you manage
it? Or is it a patent process?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> didn't do it, sir," the man breathed apologetically,
"it's not the first time that chap's given a trailer the slip.
Not by a long chalk. He left Thornbush immediately after you. I
followed him on to a bus. He got off at Charing Cross post
office, and posted two letters. Then he went into a cinema."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Pointer, "just so!"</p>

<p>"But he didn't try the usual trick of walking in one door and
out another," the detective explained resentfully. "I was
prepared for that. No. He must have doubled back on his own
tracks in some way. Sat down for a second and then slipped out by
the door he came in. All I know is, he has gone. Gone
completely."</p>

<p>Pointer was not pleased. But no man, not even a detective, can
do more than his best. And after all, the Yard had the blue
carpet and the double bass to cling to.</p>

<p>He wrote out a description of Julian Clifford's missing
secretary for insertion in the <i>Gazette</i>, the police daily
paper which no civilian may read. In it, and over the telephone
to all police stations, orders were given that the constables
were to report any place, where they heard, or had heard in the
recent past, stringed music regularly played, especially on a
Sunday.</p>

<p>They were told to pass on the request to all milkmen and
postmen on their beats or in their neighbourhood. The stringed
instrument especially suspicious was given as the double bass,
but as Pointer was not sure that a constable's ear could be
certain of distinguishing it properly, he also included the whole
range of fiddles, preferring to sift all information later.</p>

<p>A snapshot of Newman was enlarged for the paper and printed on
a grating so that every deviation from the absolutely regular was
at once noticed. They were very trifling, very few.</p>

<p>Ordinary enlargements of the snapshot were got ready to be
taken to-morrow by detectives to all musical societies, all
instrument dealers, and musical supply stores. A double bass
presupposes chamber music, or membership of some orchestra, or
musical society. A telephone call was sent to all taxi stands and
garages asking any men to report at the Yard who had recently
carried a double bass. It was barely possible that they had
carried one to-night. Newman, even though he thought his home
address undetectable, might have changed it, and his instrument,
to a fresh place. Here was one of those points that no amount of
reasoning could settle. No deductions in the world would discover
where that place was. But the dust beaten out of his waistcoat
pocket and examined under the microscope might yet find it. Then
Pointer called it a day, and went to bed.</p>

<p>But at dawn he was up again, and out at Thornbush, watching
with the two road-menders the summer sun wake the garden. Nothing
on earth is more lovely. When it grew light enough to see, the
men shook off the spell, and fell to work on the places which had
been marked by the two "lads after their dormouse," as having
been recently disturbed. They found nothing, let alone a tin box
with plaster&mdash;and a head&mdash;in it.</p>

<p>Then Pointer whizzed along to Haslar's garden. The same
dormouse had escaped there too, it seemed. Places of disturbed
earth had been marked. So the same search took place here too,
with the same negative result.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9">CHAPTER 9</a></h2>

<p class="first">POINTER was at breakfast at eight o'clock when
he received a letter rushed up to him by a motor cyclist from
Scotland Yard, where it had just been delivered. It had been
posted the previous evening at Charing Cross. It was signed A.
Newman, and ran:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">To <span class="smcap">Detective Chief
Inspector Pointer</span>.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="letter">I know that you have had your suspicions of me,
and that it is only a question of days before the trap closes if
I stay at Thornbush. I prefer to slip away while I can. The
headless body found in Fourteen Heath Mansions, and
identified&mdash;publicly, at any rate&mdash;by the police as
Etcheverrey, a Basque anarchist, is Mr. Julian Clifford's. I
killed him last night for reasons which concern no one but
myself. I took the flat for a month, under the name of Tourcoin,
and induced Mr. Clifford to come there late last night. The rest
you know. Haslar guessed what had happened when he read the
description of his coat and ring, borrowed by me; as well as from
some things that I let slip. I shot him to prevent his going to
the police. I did not intend to hurt him severely. My intention
was to inflict a slight wound to disable him until I could make
my arrangements.</p>

<p class="letter">Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">A. Newman</span>.</p>

<p><br> Pointer had barely finished this when his telephone
buzzed. It was one of the men whom he had left at Arnold Haslar's
house. He was speaking from a near-by telephone. He read out to
the Chief Inspector the letters which he had just taken from the
postman. None interested Pointer except one from Newman.
Practically a replica of his own letter, informing "Dear Miss
Haslar" of the same terrible facts and ending up "yours very
truly."</p>

<p>The letters were duly re-fastened and delivered.</p>

<p>Newman evidently believed that he had got clear of the police,
or this letter would not have been written&mdash;not yet. So
Pointer read the situation. But had Newman really escaped? Time
alone would tell. As for the telephone message to the taxis, no
information was brought in overnight that fitted Newman, nor was
his portrait identified by any of the men.</p>

<p>Pointer himself drove at once to Thornbush and had a short
talk with Sir Edward, who had spent what remained of the night
there. Clifford read Newman's letter with a puckered brow.</p>

<p>"It fits in with our idea of last night, and with that
deciphered bit of burnt paper. 'I know the danger,' Julian wrote.
But that was evidently just what my brother did not know. Of
course the last word on that fragment is either <i>knife</i> or
<i>life</i>. Certainly not <i>wife</i>. I see no necessity of
even suggesting that third reading."</p>

<p>Pointer agreed that until they knew more, either of the two
words might be substituted.</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>"This confession of&mdash;we will continue to call him
Newman&mdash;is an extraordinary document. Is it a genuine
confession, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Very difficult to say, Sir Edward."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford came into the room at that. She looked very
composed. Yet Pointer thought that she had not slept well. He
handed her the letter from Newman. Sir Edward had decided that
that ought to be done. She read it, and let it fall to the
ground. For a second she stared at him with eyes dilated by
horror, then she sat motionless in the chair which Clifford
brought forward. So motionless, that she scarcely seemed to
breathe. Finally she looked up, outwardly at any rate quite
calm.</p>

<p>"This is all some wild mistake. Arnold began it with his
ravings, and now Mr. Newman writes this with some idea of saving
him from suspicion. Suspicion of&mdash;oh, it's too horribly
grotesque! I wish I could make you understand, both of you, that
Julian is perfectly well, and never has been in any danger, at
least not in danger of his life. I had a letter from him only
this morning. I kept it to show you, Edward. Though he expressly
asks me to destroy it. I'll get it."</p>

<p>"It's not possible that Julian wrote that letter, Alison,"
Edward Clifford said sadly. "My dear, there's no doubt whatever
that our Julian is dead&mdash;none."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford bit her lip.</p>

<p>"I'll get his letter. That'll convince you..."</p>

<p>A minute later she returned looked rather flushed. "I must
have dropped it somewhere. I thought I had locked it in my
bureau, but it's not there."</p>

<p>"What was in it?" Pointer asked bluntly.</p>

<p>"Just vague generalities," Mrs. Clifford said casually,
"except that he repeats that he'll be back for certain on Friday
at latest."</p>

<p>"Still no address?" Pointer asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Still no address," she said coldly. Pointer stood looking
down at her. His face was very grave.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford, I don't think you realise the position at
all," he said finally. "We at Scotland Yard believe that your
husband was murdered. I believe that he was murdered by some one
in, or closely connected with this house. We know that he is
dead. I'm sorry to say, we <i>know</i> it. You yourself are not
free from suspicion. No one who is in any way connected with Mr.
Clifford can be. Yet you persist in an attitude which cannot but
be considered suspicious, for it tries its best to hold up the
search&mdash;to put it off. As Sir Edward says, that letter of
which you speak is a forgery. We must see it&mdash;if it is to be
found. It is most unfortunate that it should have
been&mdash;lost."</p>

<p>Clifford listened as though each word hurt him. He all but
interposed once, then he caught the Chief Inspector's warning eye
and kept silent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford looked absolutely unmoved. Her rather rabbit-like mouth set itself perhaps a shade firmer.</p>

<p>Clifford leant forward and took her hand.</p>

<p>"Alison, I wish I could spare you. If there were a doubt
possible..."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford looked at him very pleasantly, but apparently
she was not to be shaken from her attitude of absolute conviction
that Julian Clifford was well, and would return by Friday
evening.</p>

<p>"That's only the day after to-morrow," she pointed out, "do
wait till then, Edward, before doing anything. Anything
whatever."</p>

<p>Trimble came in. Chief Inspector Pointer was wanted on the
telephone. It was Richard Straight's quiet voice this time.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Chief Inspector Pointer? Could you come at once
to Mr. Haslar's? I walked over before breakfast to hear how he
is. He's still alive. But Miss Haslar is in trouble. She's just
had a letter from Newman, and has something to tell you about him
that she thinks you ought to know. She may change her mind. I've
had a great deal of difficulty..."</p>

<p>Pointer could not fly to the house, but he did his best to get
there before Diana should have done anything so unkind.</p>

<p>He was shown at once into her sitting-room. She sat in a big
chair looking oddly small and pinched. Her face was very white
and still. Before her was an open letter. Straight was pretending
to read the morning paper. He jumped up and shook hands.</p>

<p>"Miss Haslar wants me to stay... She has something to tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you had a letter from Mr. Newman too?" Pointer asked
her.</p>

<p>"Yes." Diana spoke tonelessly. Her voice was the tired voice
of one wearied with a long, long struggle. "Mr. Newman is really
Sanz Etcheverrey, Chief Inspector."</p>

<p>Straight jumped.</p>

<p>Pointer only looked at the toes of his shoes.</p>

<p>"You're sure?"</p>

<p>"I was engaged to him. It was a secret engagement. But I was
engaged to him."</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>"Do you feel like telling me more about it?" Pointer asked.
"Except the mere fact of your identification, I think the details
can be kept quite confidential."</p>

<p>Diana seemed wrapped in some cloak of remembered sorrow. Even
when Straight went over to her and took her hand, she quietly but
firmly disengaged her own. Just now she was locked among her
memories. No one could enter. "It was the second year of the
war," she began again.</p>

<p>"Why, you were only a kid, Diana," Straight interjected.</p>

<p>"I was nineteen. He was twenty-one. I was at Hendaye with some
relations called Riply. Mr. Riply enlarged the harbour at
Melbourne," she explained to Pointer.</p>

<p>"Sir Karri Riply, the engineer?" he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"He was dying. The ship he came over on had been torpedoed and
exposure in a boat for three days had given him pneumonia. All
the hotels were being used as military hospitals along the coast.
But we finally took a villa, his wife and I, at Hendaye. Just
this side of the Spanish frontier which was practically unguarded
just there. Even long after the Bolo affair, a five-franc or
peseta note, as the case might be, would get you over the line
and no questions asked. There were lots of Spaniards swarming
everywhere as far as Bordeaux. Sanz Etcheverrey was one of them.
He called himself Senor Rosa. But he told me in strict confidence
that his real name was Sanz Etcheverrey, then an unknown name to
me, and to everybody outside a very small circle. Well, he and
I&mdash;" She gave a half shrug. "I adored him. He seemed to
adore me, though he refused to have our engagement made public.
He said that as he was on a very private and dangerous mission it
would injure him if it became known that he was attending to
anything else but his orders. He never pretended&mdash;to
me&mdash;not to be a secret service agent. But I didn't guess
that what he was after were the Melbourne Harbour plans which
Mr.&mdash;he was Sir Karri only the night he died&mdash;Riply
always kept with him.</p>

<p>"Sanz used to ask me all sorts of questions about those plans
too. Where Mr. Riply kept them, and so on. I, like a fool, used
to consult him as to the best place." Diana gave a hopeless
gesture of her hand, then she let it fall back into her lap.
"Karri Riply died quite unexpectedly. I hurried home from the
hospital where I helped, to find Mildred, his wife, holding him
up in her arms while he fought for his last breath. Suddenly I
thought of those plans. Sanz Etcheverrey had been talking about
them only that day. And at that moment, as though I at last had a
ray of sense, I remembered that he had got the password to the
safe out of me&mdash;oh, very cleverly! But for the first time I
had, as I say, a ray of sense. I hurried to the room where the
safe stood, opened the door, and there, working with an electic
torch, with a beret pulled down over his eyes to his cheek-bones,
was Sanz.</p>

<p>"I knew him at once, though I had never seen him in his Basque
dress before. I screamed at him. But he&mdash;he hit me!" Diana
covered her face with her hands. "I suppose he meant to kill me.
He knocked me senseless. He must have picked me up and carried me
to my room and locked me in. When I came to I had an awful pain
in my head, but I got out through the window. There was no use
trying to get help. The servants could not be spared at such a
moment. I saw the marks of a car, two cars to be exact, which had
just left the villa. They were both going the same way. I knew
Sanz's tyres. I got out a motor-bicycle and followed them. I
followed them all night until dawn found me in Spain, at
Pamplona. There I caught up with him in a sort of locanda&mdash;a
strange little place. And Etcheverrey was in the midst of the
wildest-looking lot of brigands! He was giving them their orders,
I think.</p>

<p>"I asked for the plans back. I still never dreamt that he
wouldn't give them to me." Diana's smile told how she judged that
action now. "They tied me up and carted&mdash;it wasn't
carried&mdash;me to an upper room. After about an hour
Etcheverrey climbed in from the roof. He told me that the others
wanted to kill me because I had found out their meeting place,
and because they thought I had heard their passwords. He wanted
me to come with him. I refused. When I should have distrusted him
I had trusted him. Now when, as it happened, he was honest with
me, I distrusted every word. He got me out by carrying me on to
the roof and letting me down, bound and gagged, to the ground.
Then he put me in a car. And at that I did believe him, for some
of the men caught sight of us and fired. It wasn't what I should
call a car at all. It was a sort of motor float that carried oil
to the coast for the submarines. He laid me on the floor and
covered me with a rug and drove like mad. How we bumped and
swayed!</p>

<p>"Another car went after us, but Etcheverrey hit its tyres when
it gained too much. They only hit one of our petrol tins and set
it on fire. We just beat them into France. He had a British
passport, it seems&mdash;a military passport! And I had mine! It
was our papers that got us over the border. Because, after all,
when it came to shooting, the French guards turned out to a man
in a solid line across the road, on their side of the bridge.
Etcheverrey ran me on to Bayonne, where he dropped me at our
consul's. Then he turned the car and dashed off. I never saw him
again&mdash;until I saw him come into the drawing-room at
Thornbush in the wake of Uncle Julian, and heard that his name
was Algernon Newman, and that he had lost his memory in the last
year of the war while fighting on our side in a Surrey regiment
at Saint Quentin!"</p>

<p>Again there was a silence.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell us this before," Straight asked stiffly,
"when first you heard that Etcheverrey was supposed to, have been
murdered?"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose I can make you understand." And she turned to
Pointer as though there was more chance with him than with
Richard. "If he <i>had</i> really lost his memory, it seemed an
awful thing to bring up a past when he was a spy against us...And
he saved my life...Whatever he did as well, he saved my life that
day at Pamplona. He was wounded saving me."</p>

<p>"Did you ever tell Mr. Clifford about your belief that Mr.
Newman was Sanz Etcheverrey the Basque anarchist?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"No. If he had really lost his memory&mdash;that was the
dilemma. Had he lost it, or had he not?"</p>

<p>"You couldn't be sure?" Pointer was looking at her apparently
casually but in reality very keenly.</p>

<p>"Not for certain&mdash;though I doubted it. But though I tried
him over and over again, I could never trip him up. He never gave
himself away in all these many years."</p>

<p>"Did you ever tell Mr. Clifford who you thought his secretary
was?" Pointer repeated.</p>

<p>"No. I did my best, without telling him, to get him to let Mr.
Newman go."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Clifford?"</p>

<p>"He thought I was prejudiced."</p>

<p>"When Sir Edward spoke of Etcheverrey, did you tell him what
you have just told us?"</p>

<p>"No. I told no one."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Newman know you suspected him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He used to treat it as something funny. I never accused
him in so many words of being Sanz Etcheverrey, but I as good as
told him that I didn't believe he had lost his memory. Or that he
was an Englishman. Or that he had ever fought on our side in the
war."</p>

<p>"And he?"</p>

<p>Diana flushed. "He used to jeer at me. It amounted to that. He
used to beg me to tell him of his past, not to tantalize him with
vague hints. You know Mr. Newman's gibing way. A way that he
never had at Hendaye," she ended on a soft note.</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Etcheverrey musical?"</p>

<p>"Very. He could play anything with strings&mdash;'Cello,
violin, anything with strings."</p>

<p>"Did he ever play the double bass?"</p>

<p>She could not say.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Newman. Was he musical?"</p>

<p>"No. He always insisted that he couldn't tell whether they
were playing Wagner or Blackpool."</p>

<p>"Was Mr. Clifford interested in Etcheverrey&mdash;I mean, of
course, as distinct from Mr. Newman, his secretary?" Pointer
asked next.</p>

<p>"I thought so. Lately it seemed to me that he was always
talking of him, to Mr. Newman of all men! Uncle Julian spoke as
though he got all sorts of ideas about him from Mr. Newman."</p>

<p>"Do you think Mr. Clifford intended to make any literary use
of the knowledge. Expected to put Etcheverrey himself in a
book?"</p>

<p>Diana stared in horror.</p>

<p>"That thought would have been the last straw!" she said in a
low voice. "Reckless as Sanz Etcheverrey&mdash;as Mr. Newman is,
he wouldn't dare to chance that! Yet&mdash;" She bit her lip.</p>

<p>"You think it would appeal to him?" Pointer finished.</p>

<p>"It might," Diana agreed, "he loved to play with danger."</p>

<p>"But you yourself had no idea of any such intention on Mr.
Clifford's part?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. Nor have I now, I'm thankful to say." The
answer came with convincing sincerity. So she had not taken those
missing pages of Mr. Clifford's unfinished chapter. A suspicion
that had crossed Pointer's mind just now.</p>

<p>Pointer turned to ask Straight the same question, but the look
of absolute stupefaction on that young man's face was answer
enough. Obviously he had not heard of any idea of introducing the
anarchist into the author's work.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he breathed, "what a coincidence that Mr.
Clifford should have been murdered by the man! I suppose it
<i>is</i> a coincidence?"</p>

<p>"More probably Mr. Clifford stumbled on some truth," Pointer
explained.</p>

<p>"I see," Straight still looked amazed, "and Etcheverrey,
finding himself discovered, killed him."</p>

<p>This was Tindall's and Sir Edward Clifford's suggestion too.
And like a warning notice not to keep to the wrong side of the
road, two sentences stood out before Pointer's mental eye. Two
sentences that had been burnt to a brittle cinder: "I know the
danger" "discovered your secret."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no!" Diana burst out, with a sound to her voice
as though it came tearing from her very heart itself, "not that!
Etcheverrey would never have killed Uncle Julian for any personal
reason. If it's true that he killed him, then it was for some
other, some political end."</p>

<p>"I believe you love him still," Straight said harshly, looking
at her in open indignation.</p>

<p>"And if I do&mdash;can I help myself?" she asked passionately.
"Can you cure yourself of cancer by wanting to be cured? Don't
you suppose I've told myself all the facts over and over again?
Of <i>course</i> it's glamour and only glamour. Of <i>course</i>
I've had a lucky escape&mdash;but I can't tear it out." She was
all but whispering. Tears stood in her eyes as in a child's, but
these were the tears that scald.</p>

<p>"And I thought you loathed the chap!" Straight looked
bewildered and hurt. "You always said you loathed him," he
repeated accusingly.</p>

<p>"Of course I said so, because I didn't," Diana retorted
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;women are the devil," was the morose and very
feeling reply. "And only now that he has murdered Mr. Clifford
and tried to murder your brother, you think the time has come to
speak out?" Straight snorted. "And I thought it was love of
justice! To tell me to my face that you still love this
murderer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's not a murderer." Diana was white but decided. "He's a
man acting for his government. If he&mdash;if he&mdash;had
anything to do with Uncle Julian's death it was as an agent as a
secret service agent"&mdash;she hid her face in her
hands&mdash;"obeying orders as a soldier does."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"And now, Miss Haslar, to pass on to another point"&mdash;the
Chief Inspector looked very grave. "It was not Mr. Newman who
took that flat, 14 Heath Mansions; it was your brother, Mr.
Haslar. He has been identified beyond any doubt."</p>

<p>"He was all muffled up," Diana began quickly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Haslar has been identified by his voice&mdash;an unusual
voice," Pointer said quietly, inexorably.</p>

<p>Diana gazed in dumb misery out of the window. A lovely day
seemed to mock human suffering. A thrush, even though it was
July, the month of flowers, not of birds, tried a few notes. Then
he fell silent, as suddenly as though he were a friend and had
seen her face. But the calls of the gold-finches flashed to and
fro across the roses; and on a sudden, sweet and clear, a wren's
song rang out like a silver bugle, as gay, as spiritually alive,
as in spring. The little brown singer popped back into its shady
nook, but something in the gallant strain had helped Diana. She
turned around.</p>

<p>"When you first read in the papers of the murder of
Etcheverrey, what did you think?" Pointer went on. "You could not
then have thought that it was Mr. Newman who had taken the flat,
since you say that Mr. Newman is Etcheverrey?"</p>

<p>"I thought it was Arnold then, of course, who had taken it,"
she agreed. "I thought&mdash;he had learnt of Sanz's
treachery&mdash;and had&mdash;killed him."</p>

<p>"Because of you?" Pointer asked gently.</p>

<p>"Because of me, and because of the taking of the Melbourne
Harbour plans. Straight understood that drive back to Arnold's
house now. That cry of fright when she had seen the man, of whose
terrible death she had just read, standing on the steps."</p>

<p>"And when you saw Mr. Newman?" Pointer pressed.</p>

<p>"I knew then that it was he who had killed&mdash;not been
killed. I thought that he had taken Arnold's ulster and ring. But
I never guessed that the unknown, murdered man was Uncle Julian!
And in spite of what he writes in those letters, I can't believe
it. I can't!" Diana ended on a strangled cry.</p>

<p>Straight jumped as though something had stung him.</p>

<p>"I can't stand your grief for this anarchist," he said hotly.
"You're not even pretending to&mdash;to cast him off. If you were
disgusted with him, it would be different. But, as it is&mdash;I
told you that I loved you. I told you that I wanted nothing
better than to make you my wife. That I would wait years for you
to say yes." He paused dramatically.</p>

<p>"Well?" Diana&mdash;it is regrettable to record the
fact&mdash;snapped at him.</p>

<p>"I won't trouble you any more," he said coldly. "I withdraw
any pretensions to winning your affections. I could hardly hope
to carry the day against such a rival as this Basque murderer
evidently is."</p>

<p>He stalked from the room. Diana burst into an unmirthful,
cackling laugh.</p>

<p>"Jilted by the second man," she murmured. "Really I seem to be
most unfortunate!" But her laughter died out as suddenly as at
had come. Her head resting against her folded hands, she lay
quite still in the chair, looking very forlorn all of a sudden.
She had counted on Dick Straight. She had not loved him. She had
known he could be severe, but she had counted on him.</p>

<p>The door opened again. Straight held it shut behind him. "But
if ever you should need me&mdash;" he began a little
sheepishly.</p>

<p>"I don't need you. I never have, and never shall," Diana
retorted. And this time Straight banged the front door behind him
in earnest.</p>

<p>Diana turned to Pointer, who had apparently been looking at
his shoes as a man does when two people forget that they are not
alone.</p>

<p>"You had no idea that your brother and this Mr. Newman were
concocting any scheme together in which your uncle, Mr. Clifford,
figured?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>The blood seemed to leave Diana's face.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;knew they were together a good deal," she
temporised.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Newman ever seem to you to take a high hand with Mr.
Haslar?"</p>

<p>"With Arnold? On the contrary, he always fell in with
everything&mdash;" Diana started. She had spoken too quickly.</p>

<p>"I couldn't say what went on when the two were alone
together," she corrected herself.</p>

<p>"You had no idea of anything being planned which concerned Mr.
Clifford?"</p>

<p>"No." It was an obvious lie. So something was on foot which
she had noticed!</p>

<p>"Miss Haslar, your brother is in a most dangerous position,"
Pointer said in a low and gentle but very decided voice. "I'm not
trying to trap you into some admission. During this interview I'm
really only trying to see if he might not have taken that flat
for some other reason&mdash;for a quite different
purpose&mdash;than what seems the obvious one."</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"You know of none? You can think of no reason?"</p>

<p>"None," Diana said firmly&mdash;much too firmly. Real
ignorance would have hesitated, have cast about...So the reason
of which she knew, or at which she guessed, told against her
brother, and probably did concern Julian Clifford, her uncle.</p>

<p>"What papers were they which Mr. Haslar wanted taken from Mr.
Clifford?" Pointer asked immediately.</p>

<p>He had hit some mark. Diana's eyes widened, as do the eyes of
a man before he drops, who has been struck over the heart.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean?" She was gone, before Pointer
could intercept her, slipping out of her chair and through a door
like swift running water.</p>

<p>Pointer had had an outline of the Holford Will case hunted up
at Scotland Yard, and had read it through&mdash;once. What was
there in it which had made Haslar pick out Major Cory? What
purpose could such a man serve? Supposing always that Haslar had
selected him of his own free will&mdash;and Cory, in the few
minutes when he talked to Pointer, had not spoken of any common
master. He had, indeed, seemed to feel for Haslar the resentment
a man feels for one who has personally tried to dupe him, to
entangle him.</p>

<p>Why, then, had Haslar selected Cory? All that was shown of the
major by the evidence at the trial, was that he was an
unscrupulous blackguard who would have sold his grandmother to
make glue were he offered a good price for her. He had stolen a
will very cleverly though&mdash;for that Cory had stolen old Mrs.
Holford's will, Pointer did not doubt after he had read the
inside police information&mdash;and he had stolen it so cleverly
that the best brains in England had not been able to bring the
crime home to him. He had done it by a trick. He had returned
what purported to be the new will to the family solicitor, but
when the envelope was opened, it showed quite another, relatively
unimportant paper.</p>

<p>Yes, Pointer had decided, Cory was the last man whom any one
who had sat through that trial would pick out for a capable
assassin. He had shown up as a white-livered whelp. But if any
one wanted a paper stolen...Clifford's missing manuscript pages
did not affect this. They were taken to be destroyed, not
preserved. They were not stolen in Pointer's sense; nor, if it
was anything to do with Clifford's work, would Haslar have had
need of an outside thief or furnished flat, so that if, as he
believed, Haslar had deliberately chosen Cory, Pointer thought
that he held one end of the very tangled coil which surrounded
the murder of Julian Clifford.</p>

<p>Back at Scotland Yard, Pointer had not finished his swift
notes on the latest development of the Clifford Case when yet
another telephone message reached him.</p>

<p>Thirty-three constables, five milkmen, and seven postmen had
already reported stringed enthusiasts along their usual beats.
One postman even claimed that the instrument in question had been
most certainly a double bass. It proved to have been a piccolo,
but at one of the addresses&mdash;a block of chambers off Gray's
Inn&mdash; Newman's portrait was recognised as that of a Mr.
Pollock, Mr. Algernon Pollock, who had had rooms in the building
for some five years now. Mr. Pollock was a country gentleman, the
porter said, who only came up to town now and then, about once a
week it might be, and always over the Sunday. Great musician, in
the sense that he was very fond of music. Many a ticket for a
concert, or the opera, had been bestowed on the porter. Pointer
had arranged that each of his men should represent himself as a
buyer of old stringed instruments, who was trying to locate the
contrabasso used by the great Domenico Dragonetti, which was
believed to be in private hands in London. Each of the detectives
went on to say that a gentleman had been described to him by a
musical-instrument mender as the possessor of this particular
treasure. And he in his turn described Newman. In this case the
description fitted&mdash;fitted perfectly. Could the collector of
musical instruments see Mr. Pollock? Mr. Pollock was away; he had
telephoned up yesterday evening late to say that he would be out
of England for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Pointer had a very curious volume in his library at Scotland
Yard. He turned to a chapter headed Window-cleaners. Every
reputable firm supplied him with a list of the houses for which
they worked. A little later, and the head porter of the chambers
was called up by a man who told him over the wire that he was the
manager of the particular window-cleaners company who had a
contract for the building. There was talk of a strike. Rather
than incommode their most valued customers, the Window
Association were sending out a couple of their best men to do the
windows this week, so that, should there be any question of
trouble, the Gray's Inn flats at any rate would not suffer.</p>

<p>The hall porter told them to send the men along, and within a
quarter of an hour a tall, lanky, bearded man, with another
smaller companion in the well-known uniforms, carrying the proper
appliances, arrived. The one had been a regular Window-cleaner,
at least for a while. Pointer had picked up tips from him as they
came along&mdash;the best of which was a bottle of methylated
spirit. Even so, he was no speed-fiend at the work. A glance at
the board told him that Mr. Pollock had one of the top flats.
Pointer promptly left his assistants to begin with the ground
floor, and started up the stairs. A maid unlocked the little
suite. There were three rooms. The gray music room had a harebell
blue Wilton carpet; a fine piano was in one corner, a double bass
stood against one end.</p>

<p>The bedroom, the next room into which Pointer stepped, was
painted to represent an opening in a beech forest. It was
beautiful in colour, but it told Pointer nothing. The third room,
the living-room, was furnished with a luxury which made him stand
a few minutes considering it very carefully. Those Heppelwhite
chairs with their carved wheat ears, and shaped rail backs were
genuine. They were not to be picked up for a song; nor that
sideboard to match; nor those Waterford tumblers; nor the
Spengler Chelsea figures standing on both sides of an early
Worcester jar, whose green tinge spoke for its honesty. A rare
old Pretender goblet faced Pointer. Its crowned cypher I.R. had
an Amen engraved below it. Behind it was a beautiful piece of
Beauvais tapestry. Or was it from Mortlake? In either case, it
was a lovely though sombre thing, and far beyond most purses.
Pointer stepped to some candlesticks on a superbly carved
writing-table, and looked at the hall mark. York silver, and a
Paul Lamerie tray, on the table of a man whose salary was £250 a
year! And then Pointer saw something coiled on the wall over the
writing-table, which kept even him rigid in his place for a
second. It was a hangman's noose.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10">CHAPTER 10</a></h2>

<p class="first">POINTER knew that especial twist of rope, and
knew that knot. He stared at it fascinated. What was its meaning?
He examined the top of the rope with his lens. Its dust suggested
many months in the same position. An ice-axe had been thrust
through the loop. On each side were snapshots of glacier
climbing, but that was not a climber's rope. Nor a knot used for
any other purpose in the world. Nor in any prison but a British
prison. What did it mean? Placed where the eyes of the man at the
desk would always see it&mdash;<i>must</i> always see it&mdash;in that room where everything else was a joy to look at.</p>

<p>Pointer went over the many books. Mr. Pollock had not come
back here to "tidy up" last night. Evidently he was afraid of his
hiding place being discovered, and preferred to make yet
another.</p>

<p>One whole wall was given over to Spanish works alone. Many of
these were political. The books were mostly blank as far as name
went, but here and there was an Algernon Pollock in Newman's very
characteristic writing.</p>

<p>Pointer found three names in an address book, which skilful
telephone inquiries soon showed were the names of the other
members of a musical quartet which met every Sunday afternoon at
Pollock's flat for chamber music. Each had known his host for a
varying length of time, but all only since the end of the war. A
few more well-planted questions showed that Mr. Pollock had by no
means lost his memory of what went on during, or before, that
great event. The Chief Inspector next unlocked the drawers of the
writing-table. He found nothing that bore on his hunt, until he
fished a roll of pink tape out of a drawer. It was wound around a
postcard to serve as a core. Unrolling the tape, Pointer smoothed
out the card. The top had been cut off at some time to permit of
its going into a frame. So at least Pointer thought from the
little marks on the edges. At the back, one line of writing alone
survived the shears. A rather faded "you an idea of the place."
The words were in Mrs. Clifford's writing, but that was not why
Pointer stared at the card.</p>

<p>"Gables like steps running up into heaven," that was how these
roofs were built. The picture was of a street in some
town&mdash;not an English town&mdash;and those peculiar
gables...Pointer put the card carefully into his letter-case.
Then he glanced over the bathroom, and went out into the hall,
told the porter that he was feeling ill and that his mate would
carry on, and hurried back to New Scotland Yard. Here he changed
and went in his own person to interview the proprietor of the
flats, and to explain to him that Scotland Yard feared, "from
information which had come to hand," that a robbery was being
planned on some of the rooms in the chambers. He wanted,
therefore, to introduce two of his men in the guise of a night
and a day porter. They would require no pay. The proprietor was
enchanted with this proof of the wide-awake attitude of our great
detective force, and Pointer's men were accepted on the spot.
Only the proprietor and the head porter were to know the
truth.</p>

<p>In his car he studied the little picture postcard again&mdash;
studied it through his glass. The architecture, all brick, was
new to him, and was quite charming. It was a definite style,
Pointer saw, and an old style&mdash;one that had grown. A house
or two showed it in its entirety, but all of them in some
particular. In every case the gables were high, and rose in
steps, generally seven or nine, on a side to the peak, another
step. The windows were high. Some of the houses showed each
window enclosed in vertical mouldings crowned with arches, which
were again enclosed in one large moulding carried up into the
gable. The doors were many of them of slatted wood. Some were
studded. Pointer the man quite forgot Pointer the detective-officer as he came on item after item of charming design and
work. Where was this place where the builder was still a
craftsman? He studied each detail anew. The houses were all of
brick&mdash;small Tudor bricks, and all the courses&mdash;Pointer
got his first clue.</p>

<p>"Flemish bond," he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>That is to say, the rows did not, as in "English bond,"
consist of bricks laid alternately longways and endways,
"stretchers and headers," as a builder would call them. But each
row was alternatively composed of all headers or all stretchers.
And the whole of every house all down the side of the curving
street which the postcard showed, was built in this way. Only
Flemish bond...those fireplaces at Thornbush had told Pointer
that probably some one there knew Belgium.</p>

<p>Pointer took the postcard and went to see one of his many
friends. He had them in all walks of life. It was to a priest
that he turned now. Father Warbury had given a lantern lecture to
some of the young plain-clothesmen only a little while ago, which
Pointer had attended. He had Lectured on the architecture of
Holland, and at one point in his very interesting address, he had
made a little leap into Flemish styles before pulling himself up,
and saying that that was a subject in itself, and a most
fascinating subject.</p>

<p>Pointer found the priest in, and showed him the postcard. He
looked at it for a bare second.</p>

<p>"Bruges. Charming town. Don't know it? I'm pained. I thought
you knew all that we ordinary mortals do 'and then some,' as the
boys say. Yes, Bruges." He looked again at the little piece of
cardboard. This time the word seemed a talisman. Bruges to the
good father meant but the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and
stood, not for a town of misery and horrors, but only for a
little square which, running from the Pont des Augustins to the
Pont Flamand and the Porte d'Ostend enclosed a world of art and
genius the like of which could not be matched then, or later. To
him it meant van Eyck painting in the Main d'Or, Menlinc in the
rue St. Georges, with Bourbus and Gerard David near by; and
Caxton bending over his presses. At any other time Pointer would
have been delighted to be conducted into this submerged city of
old, but now he was only anxious to get away. The priest noticing
this, picked up the card again and turned to modeen times.</p>

<p>"Yes. This is a picture of the rue de l'Aiguille in Bruges.
There's no other architecture in the world quite like
it&mdash;not even in Belgium. Leopold II. had sense when he
wouldn't let the modern mason spoil his Nüremberg...'the Venice
of the North,' as some call it...ridiculous, of course. Bruges
hasn't the colours of Venice, but neither has Venice such
skylines."</p>

<p>Father Warbury again lost himself in a disquisition. Beginning
cheerily this time with broken, redented bows, to pass on over
perpendicular string courses, brick lace work, decorated key
stones, and relieving arches, to the gloom of disappearing
timpans, rounded frontons, and plastered door cases.</p>

<p>Pointer hurried away as soon as the last word was said.</p>

<p>Bruges? What could be supposed to be taking Julian Clifford to
that town?...supposing that Mrs. Clifford's slip about the gables
that climbed into heaven was a genuine slip, and it was so slight
that Pointer believed it to be genuine. He got a guide-book, and
soon saw that had she wanted to direct his attention to Bruges,
she would have described the <i>beffroi</i>, or the cathedral, or
the canals. Yes, Pointer believed the slip to have been a true
one. What illegal action then could Clifford have been, or have
been supposed to be, engaged in at Bruges? Bruges is very near
Ostend&mdash;a few minutes by train or car. Could Ostend be the
real objective? But Ostend has no streets where the gables climb
into heaven in converging sets of steps that meet at the gable
point.</p>

<p>Pointer called Ward in again.</p>

<p>"Anything going on in Bruges to draw such a man as Julian
Clifford there, and have him want his presence kept secret?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Ward pondered.</p>

<p>"Plenty to draw any lover of the beautiful to Bruges. In spite
of its trippers, and its drinking water that may, or may not, be
typhoid. But to have Julian Clifford want his presence kept
secret"&mdash;his face lightened&mdash;"of course! Mrs. Orr! Her
mother, Lady Winter, married a Belgian. Baron van der Bracht.
They live just outside Bruges."</p>

<p>"Family respected? The van der Brachts, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Very Much so. Tremendously hit by the war, but he's one of
the Court Chamberlains. Mrs. Orr is supposed to be over there,
I've heard to-day."</p>

<p>Pointer pondered over the idea after Ward had gone. Mrs. Orr?
Mrs. Orr and Julian Clifford? That idea might conceivably be
stretched to explain Clifford's murder by some one, Haslar or
another, who was in love with Mrs. Orr. But it would not explain
Mrs. Clifford's attitude. There were plenty of things to take an
artist or a collector to Bruges. Collectors walk in very dark
places sometimes. Did Julian Clifford collect? His house did not
show any such taste. His wife, so Ward had told him, professed a
dislike of most old things.</p>

<p>Still&mdash;Pointer decided to try another "friend." Mr.
Aronstein was back in town to-day, and Aronstein was the buyer
for the great American millionaire and collector, Wallend
Seaborn.</p>

<p>"To a collector," Pointer began over a lunch to which the
other had insisted on carrying him off, and whose amplitude made
the abstemious Chief Inspector shudder, "is there anything now
going in Bruges which is really worth while&mdash;worth while on
a large scale, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Bruges," Aronstein toyed with some more foie gras, "relic of
the Holy Blood, of course. That's unique. Brought back from the
Holy Land by a crusader, but apart from the money to buy it,
which would run into several fortunes, the town would rise as a
man if the authorities even hinted at such a sacrilege, and tear
buyer and sellers to pieces. The same is more or less true of the
crystal shrine in which it's shown. Diamonds and sapphires and
solid gold figurines. Then, of course, there's the Chimney of the
Frank. Marvellous piece of carving. That, too, the town would
never sell."</p>

<p>"Anything it would sell?" Pointer persisted, "in some
roundabout, secret way?"</p>

<p>Aronstein shot a long, lazy but very keen glance at Pointer.
"You're far from being a <i>little</i> pitcher, but you certainly
have the longest ears of any man I know."</p>

<p>Pointer looked very astute.</p>

<p>"One hears things," he murmured modestly.</p>

<p>"This talk is strictly confidential, of course? Oh, I know
you, Chief Inspector; I haven't forgotten the Josephine necklace.
Still, I'd like your word."</p>

<p>"Would anonymous be sufficient?" Pointer pleaded, "any
information I get will be for use, not show. That do?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. Now what do you want to know? Open out."</p>

<p>"Is there anything buyable in Bruges that would take, say,
three or four days to get hold of, would cost a pot of money,
would be risky to get out of the country, or at least get the
purchaser into serious trouble if he were found out?"</p>

<p>"There is. More properly there are. Several things. Bruges,
like many another Belgian town, wishes to sell a few of its
treasures&mdash;but you know all this, of course."</p>

<p>"Just assume that I know nothing whatever. Why shouldn't the
town sell?"</p>

<p>"The government doesn't want the nation's treasures cast out
wholesale. It's passed a very stiff law to that effect, and it's
very much on the alert. I've had several things offered me, from
this very town we're speaking of, provided I would take all
responsibility if things went wrong."</p>

<p>"All responsibility if things went wrong," murmured Pointer
thoughtfully. "How wrong could they go?"</p>

<p>"Prison. Long term. Theft. And theft of church property,"
Aronstein said briefly. "The agent who approached me, made it
quite clear that the town council would disown all part in the
affair&mdash;would never have heard of any offer. But privately I
would be put into touch with the right people who would let me
have the various articles&mdash;at a price, mind you&mdash;if I
would take all risk of the government getting on the track of
what was going on. It wasn't good enough for me. I don't need to
do things in that style. <i>Caveat emptor</i> in an ordinary way,
yes. But prison! Though I don't say that if <i>l'agneau
mystique</i> from Ghent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Could you tell me in detail what was offered from, or by,
Bruges?"</p>

<p>"Several pictures..."</p>

<p>Pointer shook his head. He did not think that pictures would
account for the mystery at Thornbush. Mr. and Mrs. Clifford had
sent a large number away to homes, and down to their brother's
place at Cleave Ford.</p>

<p>"A couple of tapestries well worth having from the cathedral.
A gold monstrance. Possibly&mdash;doubtful that&mdash;but
possibly the St. Ursula shrine. A missal..."</p>

<p>Pointer shook his head at each item.</p>

<p>"And, low be it spoken, the Charlemagne Crystal."</p>

<p>"The Charlemagne Crystal?" Pointer pricked up his ears.
Aronstein lit a cigar nearly as fat as himself. He loved to
lecture.</p>

<p>"Genuine Charlemagne. Genuine crystal. Supposed to have been
the reason for Charlemagne's successes...saw things in it. Saw
Ronceval, but too late. Eginhard, his secretary, mentions it. So
do all the <i>Romans de geste</i>. Charlemagne willed it to Luis
of Aquitaine, his third son, who took it to Aquitaine. The legend
runs that Joan of Arc is supposed to have consulted it at Rheims
and seen her awful end, and that was why she tried to give up
politics. Unfortunately for the legend, before her day it had
left France. How did it get to Bruges? Well, after the <i>Bruges
Matins</i>, when the town rose against the French, and the
gutters ran red with his soldiers' blood, Philippe-le-bel, the
then King of France, took the crystal with him as a talisman to
aid him in the great reprisal against the city. Though one would
have thought three to one would have been sufficient preparation
without magical aid.</p>

<p>"Anyway, when he was defeated at the Battle of the Golden
Spurs, the crystal fell into the citizens' hands and became
Church property. So did the king, pretty nearly. The crystal has
remained in Bruges to this day. Unless it's been sold secretly,
since it was offered to me for Mr. Seaborn. The town took charge
of it after they dissolved a Dominican monastery. But, mind you,
it would still rank as Church-owned."</p>

<p>"When was it offered to you?"</p>

<p>"Nearly two months ago, on June first or second."</p>

<p>"How would any one set about purchasing the crystal?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"Very cautiously, if he were wise," laughed Aronstein. "But
Bruges at last has built a splendid new museum. The great West
Flanders Museum, and appointed a new director. A Mr. de Coninck.
He's willing to deal, if the purchaser can get the stuff out of
the country, and will take the risk of prosecution should he be
caught. Some men might be tempted. I'm not."</p>

<p>"How much is the crystal worth?"</p>

<p>"You'd have to pay something around sixty, or possibly seventy
thousand. Even I should have to fork out fifty."</p>

<p>"Mr. Julian Clifford collects, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of. But Sir Edward attends a sale now and
then. He has some good things down at Cleave Ford."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I understand that Mr. Julian Clifford's secretary, a
man called Newman, buys for him."</p>

<p>"Newman? I've met Newman. Wonderful chap on Spanish bindings.
But I've never seen him at a big sale."</p>

<p>"Would Julian Clifford be likely to hear of these things on
offer at Bruges?"</p>

<p>Aronstein laughed.</p>

<p>"I wondered how much of this you already knew!"</p>

<p>"The agent's name?" Pointer suggested trying to look
omniscient.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Orr. Ah! I thought you knew it. Yes, she's a sister-in-law of Coninck's&mdash;or at least her half sister is Madame de
Coninck."</p>

<p>As soon as the lunch was over, Pointer wirelessed an inquiry
to Bruges as to the Charlemagne crystal. The reply came back at
once. The crystal was very well, thank you. Why shouldn't it be?
Could the Chief Inspector have a look at it? Was it on view? It
was. Case number sixteen. First room on your right as you entered
the museum. Yes, that fitted quite nicely into Pointer's mosaic.
It was the answer that he expected.</p>

<p>So there was a great prize to be bought at Bruges. Did Julian
Clifford's mysterious secretary know this too? Did the collector
in him&mdash;for the chambers near Gray's Inn were those of a
real collector&mdash;covet that crystal as well?&mdash;for
himself? Or as a gift to some one who would prize it highly?</p>

<p>A complex case this.</p>

<p>By hurrying up his work, Pointer was able, after all, to
accompany Sir Edward and Tindall to Julian Clifford's publisher.
On the way he told them of the alteration in the cheque cashed by
Mrs. Clifford early yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Sir Edward hurried on for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>"I'll look the matter up, of course. Thanks for mentioning it,
Chief Inspector. I'll look it up. But I have an idea as to what
it refers. In strict confidence I was told something last night
which explains that cheque. In any case it had nothing whatever
to do with my poor brother's awful end. It was a purely family
matter."</p>

<p>"Of seventy thousand pounds?" Pointer echoed in a surprise
which he made very obvious.</p>

<p>Clifford changed his step.</p>

<p>"And what about the fact that the cheque was made out
originally to Self? That the <i>e</i> and <i>R</i> and
<i>Esq.</i> were added afterwards?"</p>

<p>"I understand your natural anxiety to clear up every point,"
Sir Edward spoke soothingly, "but in this case there is no need
to worry. I can assure you that the cheque was altered by Mr.
Clifford himself, and that it, and the reason for it, have
nothing whatever to do with his death."</p>

<p>"But have they nothing to do with his head having been cut
off?" Pointer asked, without apparently glancing at Sir
Edward.</p>

<p>The man he was questioning almost tripped.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;how could it be connected with that terrible
mystery?"</p>

<p>"If the cheque were not yet presented when Mr. Clifford was
murdered, his death would delay, or prevent, its being cashed.
The only way to get that money quickly would be to avoid any
suspicion arising until after the money was paid out by the bank,
that the man killed was Julian Clifford. Given certain
circumstances, it is not easy to think of a better way of
preventing that identity being known than the one taken here.
Given the circumstances of a murder, for instance, or a death in
town, where a body is hard to dispose of."</p>

<p>They were in the empty, quiet Temple Gardens, and Clifford
stood still. Tindall, too, stopped and tugged at his beard.</p>

<p>"A very natural thought, Chief Inspector," Sir Edward said at
last, "but one which does not apply here. I can assure you that
the money was not needed in any particular hurry. On the
contrary, had those at Thornbush had any idea that my brother was
dead, it would never have been presented at all, and a great deal
of trouble would have been saved."</p>

<p>Pointer looked unconvinced.</p>

<p>"I should like to hear the explanation given you of that
cheque," he said finally. Pointer generally got his own way. His
was a compelling personality, perhaps because it was so quiet as
a rule.</p>

<p>"Suppose we take a cab for a few minutes' talk. We're before
our time." Clifford lifted his stick to one passing on the
embankment.</p>

<p>As they settled themselves, Pointer asked: "I suppose that Mr.
Straight is at work on Mr. Clifford's accounts?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;not to-day. No. I think I must talk the matter
over with Hobbs first. In fact&mdash;in fact the accounts are
rather connected with the affair of which I was informed last
night."</p>

<p>"By Mr. Hobbs, Mr. Clifford's literary agent?"</p>

<p>"By his cousin, Mrs. Clifford, in the first place. She
confided to me her belief that my brother has got himself into
some trouble&mdash;abroad. I can't be more precise. She would not
give names of places, even supposing that she knew them. It's not
exactly an illegal thing which he intended to do, and which,
therefore, she and Hobbs believed he was actually doing over
there this week. But, on the other hand, it's one which would
perfectly explain her and Hobbs's attitude. You see they thought,
and she still thinks, that in Julian's own interest, by his own
express commands, nothing must be said of where he is. She told
me enough to let me see that we must go very carefully indeed.
For unfortunately certain negotiations have already been opened
up. It's a question of the purchase of something which is not
allowed to leave the country&mdash;openly. Hobbs, whom I
immediately tackled, assured me that he is putting things right,
and that by the end of this week, all danger will be over of my
brother's name being mixed up in any scandal, provided we do
nothing to make a scandal inevitable.</p>

<p>"That cheque is quite in order, Chief Inspector. It's for the
purchase of this&mdash;object; a huge sum, but I understand not
beyond the worth of the object, and after all, Mr. Clifford could
afford to gratify the only request of the sort that his wife has
ever made. Hobbs cabled last night to stop the deal. He thinks he
was in time to prevent its actually leaving its own country, and
that being so, he has every expectation, certainty almost, of
having the money refunded&mdash;in time. The money was sent off
to an intermediary yesterday morning. But any investigation on
our part, Chief Inspector, would do irreparable mischief just
now. Quite irreparable. My brother's name would be brought into a
most deplorable prominence. Hobbs went so far as to assure me
solemnly that were he alive&mdash;and were the facts to become
known&mdash;my brother, Julian Clifford, would be liable to
imprisonment! Of course, I myself would have to resign at once at
the mere whisper of such a thing. Now, this whole affair has
nothing whatever to do with Julian's death, nor with the terrible
taking away of his head. As I say, Hobbs believes that he sees
his way to put things back exactly as they were. Mrs. Clifford
will not get her wish&mdash; for the moment. But if only matters
can be adjusted, she, when she knows the facts, as she must very
soon, will look at the matter exactly as we do."</p>

<p>"And the alteration on the cheque?" Pointer asked rather
dryly.</p>

<p>"Hobbs spoke of it to me. The cheque was first drawn out to
<i>Self</i>. Then, when Mr. Clifford decided not to appear so
directly in the matter, and learnt that one of
the&mdash;ah&mdash; intermediaries was called Selfe, he himself
merely added an <i>e</i>, and so on. The alterations did not
show, and Julian did not initial them."</p>

<p>"I see," Pointer said. "Mr. Hobbs seems to 've thought of
everything." He spoke in a tone of real appreciation.</p>

<p>"Our aim now," Sir Edward went on, "is to uncover the reason
for Etcheverrey's murder of my poor brother, and how far Haslar
was guilty, or accessory to the fact. It's a hard enough task
without adding other tangles to it. That discovery of yours
points to the only solution of this riddle, I do
believe&mdash;the discovery that my brother was going to write
something which Etcheverrey felt that he must stop. Add to that
Mr. Tindall's remarkable guess as to the identity of Etcheverrey,
and I think we may safely feel that we are on the right
road."</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>"What was it, what <i>could</i> it have been that my brother
was going to write which caused his death?" Edward Clifford
repeated ruminatingly.</p>

<p>"I've a notion that only a betrayal, real or fancied, would
have made Etcheverrey kill a man," Tindall said, "unless it was
all a ghastly mistake."</p>

<p>Mr. Bancroft proved to be a pleasant, business-like man, an
old acquaintance of both Tindall and Sir Edward.</p>

<p>"Necessary to reach Clifford at once...and you think...yes, I
see the idea. I know he is away from home. Mrs. Clifford told me
as much when I 'phoned to her yesterday. For Clifford had made an
appointment. He was going to bring us in the next chapter of
<i>The Soul of Ishmael</i> himself some time during yesterday
morning. We had been discussing it last time he and I lunched
together. We're bringing it out in parts in our monthly magazine
as you know. We suggested a little more&mdash;eh&mdash;well,
adventure&mdash; incidents&mdash;" Bancroft looked apologetic at
having to mention such words. "The public taste is so depraved
nowadays that it insists on high seasoning. Over-seasoning. And
even such a giant as Julian Clifford who leads the masses, has to
take account of it."</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i> follow the mob, because I lead them." Tindall
quoted the French revolutionary's words.</p>

<p>"Ex&mdash;actly! As it happens, Clifford was turning over in
his mind a very dramatic idea. His&mdash;I really cannot call
William Roberts a hero&mdash;his chief character, let us say,
being forced to leave England, was to go abroad and find an
outlet for a quite unsuspected side of his character with a
notorious Basque anarchist. The anarchist was to be drawn from
life if possible. Clifford gave me an outline of what was to
come." Bancroft here unlocked a drawer. "I think he meant to take
these notes with him, but he jotted them down at my house and
left them behind him, and I confess I could not resist the
temptation to keep them. They are so exceedingly
interesting&mdash;so clear. But possibly you may find in them
some suggestion as to where he would be likely to go first. He
refers to Capvern once or twice. And to a place called
Guizep&mdash;really these Basque names are worse than the
Welsh."</p>

<p>Bancroft laid an envelope in front of Sir Edward, who took it
gladly.</p>

<p>"Let me have it back when you've done with it. Cliffordiana,
you know," the publisher said smilingly, "and Clifford may yet
ask me for it. By the way, when, or if, you do reach him, ask him
to let us have the next instalment as soon as he can, will you?
Newman says that no chapter was handed to him to be sent on, so
he prefers not to risk a mistake. So do we! And as Clifford is
expected back by Friday&mdash;Mrs. Clifford seemed certain of the
day&mdash;at a pinch we can wait till then."</p>

<p>"When did Mr. Clifford leave the notes behind him?" Pointer
asked.</p>

<p>"When? About a fortnight ago. Week ago last Friday." Bancroft
flipped some pages over in his engagement pad.</p>

<p>Finally, after nearly an hour, the three took their leave.</p>

<p>"Well," Sir Edward said, as they stood a moment before the
house. "Bancroft has been very helpful. Some of those suggestions
he remembered&mdash;and that precious envelope with Julian's own
notes. They, I think, had better be photographed at once. Three
copies, please, Tindall, tell the clerk. And let each of us have
one to pore over as soon as possible. There may be nothing in
them. But one can but hope."</p>

<p>Pointer shook hands. He had left his gloves in the publisher's
private room. Mr. Bancroft was still alone. Pointer found his
gloves, and stood a moment chatting.</p>

<p>"You're bringing out a life of William Haslar shortly, I
understand?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We hope to. But the proofs are still at Thornbush. As a rule,
Mr. Clifford is most prompt in returning them."</p>

<p>"Interesting book to write," Pointer rambled on in the tone of
a lover of books, which he was. "Still, for even a distant
connection, there must have been some difficulties. What letters
to leave out...what incidents to suppress..."</p>

<p>Mr. Bancroft agreed. But he only agreed. He added nothing to
Pointer's knowledge.</p>

<p>"Miss Haslar is helping him with them," Pointer went on. Mr.
Bancroft again agreed.</p>

<p>"Arnold Haslar came down with flu yesterday," Pointer went on.
"High fever. Odd thing is, he keeps calling out to Julian
Clifford to let him have 'the paper.' Implores us to 'take the
paper' from him. We don't know what paper. No one knows what to
make of it or what to do. The doctors seem to think we're keeping
something back. But how on earth can any one tell what paper, or
what letter it is, which Haslar wants to get away, or get back,
from Clifford?"</p>

<p>Mr. Bancroft was interested, but he could not help. He could
only instance a distant relative who had also behaved in an
eccentric manner during a high temperature. So a disappointed
fisherman had to leave, with no fish, large or small, of the kind
that Pointer thought would alone, explain the choice of Major
Cory by Arnold Haslar.</p>

<p>The photographed copies of Julian Clifford's notes were
quickly sent on to him, and Pointer glanced them over. Then he
went on with his telephoning&mdash;telephoning that took him all
the rest of the afternoon and evening.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when he was disturbed by a report from
one of his road-menders.</p>

<p>"Hobbs has just left, sir. Walking. Direction of Haslar's
house. Wright's following."</p>

<p>Pointer was off in his car within a few minutes. He stopped it
a little to one side of the house and went on on foot. Outside
the gate he lit a match, and tossed it away in a peculiar
curve.</p>

<p>A second later a hand touched his arm.</p>

<p>"Wright speaking, sir. He's inside. Came straight here."</p>

<p>Wright melted away, to return to his post outside Thornbush,
and Pointer let himself into the house with a latchkey which he
had slipped off Arnold Haslar's own key ring. Below the door of
the library a light showed. The room was locked. The key blocked
the key-hole completely. Even with his sound accumulator on,
Pointer could only hear low voices&mdash;a man's and a woman's
voice. At last they came nearer. The door was very cautiously
opened. Diana Haslar put her head out and looked up and down the
hall. Pointer stood just inside the door of the next room, which
he held ajar.</p>

<p>"Weren't you seen coming here?" she asked fearfully.</p>

<p>"No. No one's on the look-out at Thornbush, and I crept in too
quietly here to be heard. I'll leave you to shut the front door
after me. Till day after to-morrow then, at Thornbush. If the
boat's in on time, you'll be back by half-past five at
latest."</p>

<p>She nodded, and closed the door with infinite caution behind
the man, looking like an Eastern page in her short cherry silk
dressing-gown and slippers. Pointer followed her upstairs at a
safe distance. She went into her brother's room. The door was
shut, but he found another door leading into the bathroom open,
and peeping in he saw Diana sitting by her brother's bed with a
book on her lap. But she was not reading. On her face was a look
of intense excitement, intense joy. One of Pointer's men was in a
distant arm-chair by the window, ostensibly as an assistant
nurse. Round the leg of his chair was a cord, the colour of the
wood, which ran through eyelets in the wainscoting to each of the
doors. In the day-time it was taken away, but slipped on at night
by the man on duty.</p>

<p>Pointer stooped down and gave it two quick tugs.</p>

<p>A minute later, and the man stepped out with an empty glass.
He followed Pointer to his own room and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Has Miss Haslar left the room at all?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. She went down about twelve for a snack. She's
taking the watch till two, as I reported to you, sir. She came
back just now, at ten to one. I suppose she dozed off a bit."</p>

<p>"You didn't hear any sounds at all just before she went
down?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. No sound at all."</p>

<p>Pointer melted away. Merely as a matter of routine, genuinely
so this time, he stepped into the library, shut the door, and
switched on the light.</p>

<p>Sometimes people in a very engrossing conversation left odd
things behind them, and the low voices which he had heard had
sounded very absorbed.</p>

<p>The room looked as usual, except that a couple of chairs had
been moved from one side to the centre of the room. They were not
very near each other. Neither they, nor their position, suggested
intimacy.</p>

<p>Pointer looked beyond them at the place where they had stood.
Moving them had left free an old knee-hole writing-table, which,
so Pointer had found yesterday, was used as a hold-all for odds
and ends. Just now the table too stood a little away from the
wall at one end. Pointer eyed it curiously&mdash;closely.
Something caught that keen eye of his lying between one of the
feet of the table and the wall&mdash;something that had prevented
that end of the table being rolled back true as it had stood
yesterday and this morning.</p>

<p>It was the ferrule of an umbrella&mdash;rather new-looking.
Now umbrellas are not much used in libraries at any time, let
alone in a dry July. Pointer turned it over very thoughtfully.
Hobbs had not carried an umbrella when he left here just now, nor
when he left Thornbush. His trailer had told Pointer that he was
carrying nothing in his hands.</p>

<p>But Julian Clifford had taken his umbrella with him when he
left his home night before last. The butler was certain of this,
for on going up to bed he had noted its absence as well as that
of his master's soft felt hat. Besides, Clifford was one of those
men who always carry an umbrella. Pointer had sent one of his men
to the house with a gamp this morning which purported to be one
that Mr. Clifford had left in the post office. The butler had
rejected it promptly. The detective, by clever doubts and
beliefs, had obtained a close description of the author's
umbrella&mdash;a fairly new one, a recent present&mdash;among
other more praiseworthy peculiarities it had a loose ferrule, one
that threatened to drop off at any moment. Mr. Clifford had
caught it in tram points the first day of carrying it. Trimble
mentioned that Hawkins meant to have it seen to, but Hawkins
never saw to anything before he had to.</p>

<p>Pointer laid the little thimble down on the writing-table and
studied that piece of furniture intently. The chairs moved away
from it meant that the whole table had been swung out. He swung
it out. Behind it, the papered wall showed no opening, nor did
the carpeted floor. The wainscoting ran unjointed past the spot.
There remained the table itself. But to open any of its drawers
it would not have been necessary to move the chairs away. Pointer
took out the drawers and laid them on one side. Then he examined
the remaining skeleton. Yes, there was a place running the width
of his hand all along the back. Pointer promptly up-ended the
table. There are not many ways of opening secret places in such
pieces. He finally found that by screwing one of the feet around
twice out jumped the back of a panel like the door of a cuckoo
clock. He put his hand in and pulled out an umbrella, and then
its handle, then a couple of letters tied with red tape and
addressed in a faded handwriting to a Mrs. Walton in Yorkshire.
The date was nearly thirty years ago.</p>

<p>The umbrella handle exactly tallied with the description of
Julian Clifford's which had been given to Pointer's man. The
umbrella looked as if it had been violently
treated&mdash;possibly in the effort to cut off the
handle&mdash;possibly before. The handle had been hacked off with
some blunt instrument, the cane crushed and splintered.</p>

<p>Yes, with such an instrument, for instance, as a sharpened
spade.</p>

<p>He took his finds away with him, and but for them, left
everything as he had found it. Then he went home.</p>

<p>So Miss Haslar and Hobbs were to meet the day after tomorrow
at Thornbush after a boat got in, and had met tonight in the
library of Arnold Haslar's house!</p>

<p>Intricate case this! He decided to watch Diana Haslar himself
to-morrow, for the hour of the rendezvous and something in the
tone of Hobbs suggested that it was to be the finale, or the
wind-up of, or, at any rate, the report on some piece of business
on which Diana would be engaged. Mrs. Clifford's cousin, Julian
Clifford's literary agent, had spoken in the tone of a man who
would be waiting, but the look on the face of the dead man's
niece was that of one who has promised another that he can count
on her, of one who is to do something.</p>

<p>Pointer was sorry. He had planned a very busy and very early
morning at her brother's warehouse as a rat-catcher, with a wiry-haired marvel from the Yard&mdash;a champion ratter. No night
watchman and no warehouseman in Britain could resist the offer
that he intended to make.</p>

<p>However, after due reflection, he decided on "ladies
first."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11">CHAPTER 11</a></h2>

<p class="first">AND that was why, on the morrow, when Diana got
down at Bruges, a chauffeur followed her out of the train and
into the town&mdash;a chauffeur who had crossed to Ostend with
her, had taken a ticket to Bruges just after her, who had
arranged with the Bruges police to have a taxi-cab waiting for
him outside the station. But Diana was walking, so he made a sign
to the man at the wheel and walked on after her.</p>

<p>Bruges, ringed and intersected by canals, is interesting, and
can be charming; but not in July, when it is crowded with British
trippers who surge noisily in serried ranks along its main
streets, avoiding its art treasures but crowding its cake
shops.</p>

<p>As it happened to be a saint's day, or a wedding, or a
funeral, the bells of all the churches, above all the great bell
of Saint Sauveur, the massive cathedral, were shattering the air
with swift, jarring peals. The bells of Bruges are now rung by
electricity, and need not even pause for tired muscles.</p>

<p>It was the half-hour. And the <i>beffroi</i>, that beautiful
tower that lifts its coronet high into the air above Bruges' big
<i>place</i>, was giving one of its quarter-hour selections of
carillons. Melodies may sometimes be suitable for being played on
bells; this one certainly was not. Barrel organs were grinding
merrily within a few feet of each other. Trams banged their gongs
all down the curving street.</p>

<p>Diana, who looked a little dizzy with the clamour of Bruges-la-morte, turned into the rue Sud de Sablon. Being July, her
English ears did not miss the songs of birds in this country that
eats them.</p>

<p>The roof lines of the constantly winding streets were
enchanting. Dentellated, crenellated, they rose against a sky
whose colours told that the waves of Zeebrugge, the harbour of
Bruges, or Brugge, as the Flamand calls it, were very near.</p>

<p>She walked on, glad of the exercise.</p>

<p>"<i>Pas op, mejuffrouw!</i> (Look out, miss!)" a white-hatted
gendarme, who was regulating traffic, said quietly.</p>

<p>Mistaking the Flemish word for the equivalent of "Pass on,"
Diana stepped forward. She nearly "passed on" altogether. A car,
dashing around the corner, taught her the perils of ignorance.
But a long arm swept her back into safety. A chauffeur, a tanned
man in a trim uniform, with a pleasant flash of white teeth below
his drooping moustache, touched his cap with a "Pardon,
Madame!"</p>

<p>She turned at the French, for Bruges is Flemish speaking. She
saw him step towards a taxi from which a man had just slipped,
and take the wheel.</p>

<p>"Is that your taxi? Can you drive me to the Béguinage?" she
asked in the same language.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Madame!" and shutting her in the cab, he drove off
into a side street, where he pulled up, and got off, apparently
to do something to the back of the hood; in reality to open a map
of Bruges and take a long look at <i>Ten Wyngaerde</i>, The
Vineyard, as the town calls its Béguinage.</p>

<p>The Béguinages of Belgium are peculiar to this corner of
Europe. From the thirteenth century on, women solved the question
of domestic difficulties and dangers by living a community life
which gave them all the protection of a convent, but where they
could have almost the liberty of the world. The Béguines, who
dress at a glance like other nuns, in white and black, sometimes
take no vows, sometimes all but that of poverty. Their money is
their own to use and leave. They dwell, not in narrow cells under
one roof, with every hour of the day mapped out for them, but
live, if they so prefer, in little houses, alone, or with another
Béguine friend, set in the encircling, protecting wall of the
Béguinage.</p>

<p>In the centre of the Béguinage at Bruges&mdash;a small affair
compared with that of Ghent&mdash;is a quiet green. Tall elms,
elms that saw men set out on the last crusade, give it a thin,
elderly shade. Orchards and vegetable gardens lie behind it.
Inside the little houses a simple austerity must nowadays reign,
just as all the inmates are women of the highest character. For
the rest, they live pious lives under their chosen Superior
beloved by the poor, given over to good works. The chauffeur
drove the car to the arched entrance over a bridge that spanned
one of the canals. Here he had to stop. Before them, like a city
within a city, lay the Béguinage, its little red roofs dotted
among the greenery. In front the water mirrored the curve of its
gray wall. Artists sat sketching it. To one side was the
Minnewater, Bruges' much overrated beauty spot. For though the
town has charming corners, they lie in quiet nooks, off the main
roads. But here at least was peace. Softly the carillon floated
down, melodious sounded Saint Sauveur's tireless majestic
bells.</p>

<p>Diana got out. No carriage may mar the silence of the Sister's
home. She made to pay her driver.</p>

<p>"I'll wait for Madame," he said promptly.</p>

<p>But Diana told him that she had no further need of his
services, paid him, and walked on quickly under the domed gate,
past the crucifix where the Béguines kneel, coming and going. A
sister met her going swiftly towards their church.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle van Bracht?" Diana asked.</p>

<p>"Over there. The white house with the geraniums in the green
windows, Mademoiselle," and the Béguine hurried on. "But she's at
service just now," she added over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Diana did not seem to be put off her intended call. The
chauffeur, who had lounged in after her, with the vacuous air of
a man staring at unfamiliar sights, saw her step on as swiftly as
before. He saw her rap at a little green-painted door.</p>

<p>"Baronesse van Bracht? Soeur Thérèse?" Diana asked.</p>

<p>"I am Sister Thérèse. Won't you come into my sitting-room?"
the sister said in French. Diana followed her into a little back
room on the ground floor, furnished plainly but comfortably, and
so dark that the light had to be kept switched on beneath a
statue of Sainte Begge.</p>

<p>The chauffeur tried the latch of the door. It opened under his
careful hand without a sound. In his rubber-soled deck shoes he
passed into a tiled passage with two doors on either hand. A door
at the end of the passage showed the canal, quiet and deserted.
He turned, and softly opened the first door on his left. He stood
in a neat kitchen. As he hoped, a door led into the next room,
where he could hear the two women. Noiselessly he drew the
curtains shut over the window, then he cautiously opened the
communicating door. Diana was just handing an envelope to the
Béguine, who was saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will see that it is passed on at once to my sister, Madame
de Coninck. She will do the rest. By this evening all will be put
right. I will give you a receipt if you will step into this
balcony&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant the light went out. Soeur Thérèse called out
in English, and in English English too.</p>

<p>"Who's that? Who's holding my hand?" Then she screamed.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Diana called quickly. "I'm here, Sister.
What's wrong?"</p>

<p>There came a knock on the door leading into the passage. The
same moment the Béguine switched up the light. She glared at
Diana like a mad woman. The knock came again. Her white headdress
awry, the sister tried to pull it straight; she tugged at the
black veil which shadowed her face and which, as a rule, is laid
aside indoors.</p>

<p>The door opened, and the chauffeur looked in shyly.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Mesdames, but is anything wrong? I was knocking to
ask the young lady whether she left this scarf in the cab, when I
heard a cry&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sister looked from him to Diana and back to him with the
swift, ferocious look of a panther.</p>

<p>"It's a plot, is it?" she said in a low, dangerous voice. "I
see!"</p>

<p>Diana stared at her. The chauffeur stared too. Hiss hair
seemed to stand up with surprise. His mouth open, he looked from
the sister to the English girl.</p>

<p>"She's mad," he said in French. "Come with me, Madame. She's
quite mad, eh?"</p>

<p>"Stop!" The Béguine held out her hand. In it was something
that glittered.</p>

<p>"Make a move either of you, and I shall shoot. I want that
package back. I intend to have it back, so&mdash;"</p>

<p>Diana was quick of eye, but just what happened she did not
see. The chauffeur did not seem to move a finger. Yet something
shot across the room full into the sister's face. It was his cap.
The man sprang after it. He seemed to use no force whatever. He
only put out one hand, but the automatic fell with a smack
against the opposite wall.</p>

<p>"We must go for help. She is evidently quite mad." He spoke
pityingly as the woman turned and twisted in his arm. "Go on to
the car below, Mademoiselle. I will follow in a little minute.
<i>Pardieu, la pauvre soeur!</i> I will notify the police on the
way to the station."</p>

<p>"No," Diana said quietly, "I don't leave her like this. What
package is it you miss, sister? The one I brought?"</p>

<p>For a second the sister stared at her, then she said, "I
thought you were in it. I see you're not. This man has that
letter you brought. I'm sure of it. I'm certain he opened the
door from that next room, switched out the light, and twisted the
package from my hand before he pretended to knock at the other
door. It's only a step between them."</p>

<p>She spoke in English. The man goggled stupidly.</p>

<p>"<i>Quoi?</i> She says?"</p>

<p>Diana translated all that was necessary.</p>

<p>"A letter has been lost? Then why not telephone to the
gendarmerie at once? There is a telephone at the portress's
lodge. I saw the wires as I passed it. We can all three go there
if the sister doubts me. But she is mad. The poor lady!"</p>

<p>Diana looked at the sister, whose face was white with red
circles on the cheek-bones&mdash;circles of fury. She looked like
a horrible clown.</p>

<p>Diana, with an odd look of uncertainty in her usually self-possessed glance, did not move.</p>

<p>"If you will be so good as to open that wooden shutter over
there we could see better," the chauffeur said again. "I do not
like to let her go. She may do herself a mischief. Throw herself
out of that window, for instance." He gave the sister a look in
which there was something mocking and something very stern. "The
window that is open," he went on, "the window of the little
balcony. A slip, and one would be in the canal. And the canal
just here is choked with weeds, and quite deep enough to drown
the sister, especially if by any chance that sort of iron raft
were to fall down which I see is only stood against the window
just below, so that a push from an outstretched hand would send
it in too. It could so easily pin any one who had fallen in down
among the weeds; and it is quite a deserted stretch."</p>

<p>Diana did not stir, but her jaw tightened.</p>

<p>"This man is a government spy," the sister said fiercely. "We
must get that letter back. We must act!"</p>

<p>"You are acting, Mrs. Orr," the chauffeur answered blandly,
"and acting very well. But I don't think you'll get that package
back."</p>

<p>Diana jumped. It was the voice of the Chief Inspector from
Scotland Yard. And what was that about "Mrs. Orr"?</p>

<p>"I am Sister Thérèse," the Béguine said very calmly now. "Mrs.
Orr is my half sister. We are rather alike. Miss Haslar, you know
what hangs on recovering that envelope."</p>

<p>Diana seated herself.</p>

<p>"I'm going to understand this," she said, and she meant
it.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that would take longer than you think. But
this"&mdash; Pointer dived into an inner pocket and held out
something&mdash;"is what you brought, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Why should you take that?" Diana asked indignantly. She
looked prepared to snatch it from Pointer herself.</p>

<p>He gave her an apparently swift but very searching glance.
"Miss Haslar, I think you know that I'm not tricking you when I
assure you&mdash;<i>assure</i> you&mdash;that it is where it
should be. Who gave it to you?"</p>

<p>Diana did not answer. She looked at him. She looked at the
Béguine whom Pointer still held by one hand on her arm. It was
unlike Diana to let things drift. But she made no move, and she
turned very pale.</p>

<p>Again he looked at her, with a rather enigmatic look.</p>

<p>"A train back to Ostend leaves in half an hour. I want you to
take that, Miss Haslar."</p>

<p>She intended, he knew, to spend the night in that flamboyant
resort. Her telegram to the Royal Hotel there for a room had been
read this morning at Victoria before it was sent off. Two rooms,
adjoining, and with a communicating door between had been engaged
instead. Though this she would never know. A woman detective, who
had accompanied Pointer, would be beside her. New Scotland Yard
was doing its best to watch over Diana.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are crossing back to-morrow?"</p>

<p>She was.</p>

<p>"When you get back to town go straight to your brother's
house. Don't go to Thornbush until I have had a talk with you.
And don't telephone to any one there that you are back in
London." She started. He looked her squarely in the eye. "Don't,
on any account, go to or communicate with Thornbush, Miss
Haslar," he repeated, "until I have called. I will try to get to
you as soon after you reach home as I can. You have been in
greater danger to-day than you quite realise." His eyes went to
the window overlooking the canal, to the Béguine, and back to
Diana.</p>

<p>"Danger&mdash;to me? I don't understand." She didn't.</p>

<p>"When a murder has been committed, and a head cut off, those
who have gone as far as that are not likely to be playing for low
stakes. You mustn't come between a tiger and his kill, and expect
mercy," was the Chief Inspector's only explanation. His manner
was very grave.</p>

<p>Diana shivered. She was looking very different now from the
girl who had taken the cab.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me the truth when you come to-morrow?" she
asked, not as one making a bargain, but desperately.</p>

<p>"What I tell you will be strictly the truth. And I expect from
you strictly the truth," he said quietly. "And now, I think you
had better start."</p>

<p>"But this&mdash;this sister&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" Pointer gave a queer little smile, "this lady and I have
a few things to say to one another."</p>

<p>Diana left the little cottage where all should have been
peace, and where she had just spent a most violent few minutes.
Something seemed to have given way in Diana. She looked as though
something vital had been taken from her.</p>

<p>After an uneventful but sleepless night she left by the boat
next morning, quite unaware that the rather severe-looking young
woman beside her on the deck had anything to do with her. Her
train was to the minute. She had nothing but a suitcase for the
Customs, and five o'clock found her quietly letting herself into
her brother's house. She peeped into his room, and saw with
infinite relief that he was drawing deeper breaths than when she
had left him yesterday morning.</p>

<p>She decided to have tea in the library. Its doors were
practically sound-proof. No sound from there could possibly
disturb the sick man. The room was empty, but from the other end,
Arnold's study, she heard a stir.</p>

<p>She stepped towards the communicating door. As she did so, she
accidentally clicked her bag against a chair. Instantly all was
silent. Opening the door, she saw to her surprise that, though
she could see no one, yet the strong-room was open. Had some one
been tampering with the deed-boxes ranged along its shelves? She
had a vague idea of their number and position. She stepped into
it to look closer. On the instant the door slammed shut. She
heard the click of the locks falling into position. She was a
prisoner in a sound-proof, all but air-tight metal safe.</p>

<p>It was at that precise moment that Mrs. Clifford was very much
bored. She was at a concert. The Albert Hall was stuffed from
stall to roof. A great violinist had given of his best, and the
enthusiasm had been delirious. Encore after encore had been
demanded and generously given. It was long past the usual time
when the last item was started. It was a Vivaldi Concerto. Mrs.
Clifford disliked Vivaldi, even when played by a master.</p>

<p>The concert room was quiet and not too bright. Idly she pulled
out her crystal ball and sat looking into it, her arm pressed
against her neighbour's, for a voluminous lady overflowed from
the other seat. Suddenly she gave a little gasp, and leaning
still more to the right, got a better view of the crystal. The
players were attacking the Rondon. Mrs. Clifford turned to the
man beside her, a man who had twisted around in his seat when she
had taken the one beside him, and buried himself still deeper in
his music folios, so that his back was practically turned to
her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Newman! Something is happening to Diana Haslar! She's in
danger. Can you telephone to Mr. Straight? I can't use
telephones, you know."</p>

<p>"Sh-h-sh!" hissed the music-lovers around them
indignantly.</p>

<p>The man beside her flung his music books on to his seat, and
swiftly, with a hand under her arm, led her out into the corridor
outside.</p>

<p>"Go at once! Or telephone to Mr. Straight, he's nearer." Mrs.
Clifford seemed quite unmoved by Newman's presence, as he was by
the fact that she had known her husband's secretary in spite of a
very remarkably good disguise&mdash;a very professionally made-up
disguise.</p>

<p>"What did you see? Where is she?" he asked swiftly. Mrs.
Clifford sank on a settee and went on staring at her ball.</p>

<p>"I've lost her! No, there she is!" Newman was behind Mrs.
Clifford. He, too, was bending over the ball, his arms on either
side of her.</p>

<p>"She's locked in an iron cell. There's very little air. She's
pounding on the wall. She seems to be calling for help. It's all
dark. Outside some one is standing listening. He's in the shadow,
yet he seems familiar. Why, it's Arnold's study! Then that cell
must be his strong room. And the word that opens the door must be
lost. But what&mdash;" Newman had gone.</p>

<p><br> <br> Pointer came over on the same boat and train with
Diana, heard her give her taxi driver her brother's address, and
then turned into the buffet for a hasty sandwich. He telephoned
to the Yard for the day's reports. There were several. From
parcels addressed to non-existent streets and people Mr.
Clifford's clothes had practically all been retrieved. Along with
them was a blood-stained and beplastered hand towel. The clothes
had been identified by Mr. Clifford's tailor.</p>

<p>Pointer felt as though his boat were drawing in, drawing in
all the time.</p>

<p>Last of all he learnt that ten minutes ago Hobbs, Mr.
Clifford's literary agent, had left Thornbush and had been
followed to Haslar's house. He was still there.</p>

<p>On the instant Pointer was out of the telephone booth, and
speaking to the sergeant in charge of the station-police. In
another he was on one of their motor-bicycles which are fitted
with silencers as perfect as expense can make them.</p>

<p>He whizzed off for the Haslar's house at a speed which only
his steering made possible. Even so, one tabby never returned to
its home.</p>

<p>Arrived at the house, Pointer looked at the gravel of the
drive. It showed that a car had just turned at the front door, a
car with the same tyres as the taxi which Diana had finally
captured at Victoria. Driving away, the car had been lighter than
when coming. Probably, therefore, it was empty and all was in
order. He let himself in with his annexed latchkey. Noiselessly
he ran up to her bedroom and listened. All was silent. He tried
the door. It was unlocked. The room was empty. So was her
boudoir.</p>

<p>He glanced in at the sick room in passing, through the door
into the bathroom, but he gave his man no signal. Diana was not
there, nor in either drawing-room. On the ground floor, dining-room and morning-room and library were all empty. Remained only
the study. As he jumped for the communicating door, it opened,
and Hobbs came out.</p>

<p>"Miss Haslar's in there," Pointer said swiftly but very
easily. "I've followed her here from the station. I must have a
word with her."</p>

<p>Hobbs fell back. His face turned green, his jaw slackened.
Pointer's unexpected appearance, his swift yet casual words, his
absolute certainty as to where Diana was, seemed to rattle
Hobbs.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;eh&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pointer did not wait. He stepped in and glanced once around
the room. Then he was at the safe door. He knew the password,
thank God. Pointer had connected up the safe dial with a certain
well-hidden burglar's dial before sending for Haslar's manager
last night. It had marked every letter he set. The word had been
Visit. Pointer now turned the five letters&mdash;tried the word.
The door refused to budge. So some one, Hobbs probably, had
changed the password.</p>

<p>Pointer, his ear to the safe, tapped with the end of his watch
chain, sharp swinging blows. He caught a faint tap-tap from the
inside.</p>

<p>"She's in there! Good heavens, man, you must have locked the
door on her, never guessing that she was inside. Quick, Mr.
Hobbs, the password!"</p>

<p>Pointer was throwing the man a rope. But the colour was coming
back into Hobb's face.</p>

<p>"Miss Haslar's upstairs in bed, I take it. I haven't seen her,
nor do I know anything about the safe or the combination lock. I
dropped in to look up a technical point in one of Haslar's
electrical books. I was in the library when I heard a tremendous
thud. It took me a second to realise that it was the door of the
strong room that I heard. At least, I suppose it was. I'm not
certain even of that much."</p>

<p>He rattled off the speech at top-speed. His words were not
exactly blurred, but there was a thickness about them that made
Pointer's heart sink. Hobbs was the worst for drink, and the only
chance for the girl locked in would have been a clear-headed,
shrewd Hobbs, a Hobbs who would have known when he must cut his
losses. Pointer knew from yesterday what Hobbs could be like when
he was not sober, and to-day he was more nearly drunk than
yesterday&mdash;much more nearly.</p>

<p>Pointer <i>gave</i> a whistle like a blackbird's when a
poacher blunders too close at night. A man clambered in through
the open window. He said a word to him. The man moved to Hobb's
side, who looked as though he were watching something awful come
up to him.</p>

<p>Pointer jumped to the telephone. He was taking no chances. He
might yet get the password out of Hobbs, but meanwhile he was
telephoning the Yard to send him the safe-expert with his most
up-to-date tools to open a strong room door, which
was&mdash;Pointer gave the makers' name and the size of the door.
But the master-cracksman was away. No one knew when he would be
in. Another man would, of course, be sent, but there was no
second Cockerell.</p>

<p>Pointer felt certain that it was Hobbs who had altered the
code word, but he might be wrong. He tried for Haslar's manager,
but Mr. Dance was out. Then he got Thornbush. No one there was
in. Mrs. Clifford was out. Mr. Straight was out; it was believed
that he had gone to Sir Edward Clifford's. Mr. Hobbs was out.</p>

<p>Pointer turned again to Hobbs.</p>

<p>"Come, Mr. Hobbs, try and think if you can't remember the code
word. It would mean a lot," Pointer's eyes dwelt on the other. "I
was over in Bruges yesterday with Miss Haslar. I have the letter,
by the way, safe and sound, which you gave her to take to Mrs.
Orr."</p>

<p>Hobbs's face twitched as though an electric shock had passed
through him.</p>

<p>"She might have had a bad time in Bruges...But a good turn
cancels a bad one&mdash;sometimes. I'm sure she wouldn't remember
Bruges if she got out of that strong room at once...Nor would
I!"</p>

<p>Pointer was exceeding the law, and doing it most unwillingly,
but the need of the entombed girl was paramount. Hobbs looked as
if a terrible struggle was going on within him. The sweat stood
out on his white face. But he set his teeth.</p>

<p>Pointer turned away. Was Hobbs gambling on the chance that
Diana Haslar would never speak? But Hobbs was no fool. Whatever
Diana knew could not be equivalent to rejecting the life-line
that the Chief Inspector had thrown him. There was a greater
reason than fear of what she might say, might suspect. Suddenly
Pointer guessed it.</p>

<p>He turned and gave the man in the chair a long look. Hobbs
caught it, read it, leapt in his seat, and then sat rigid, his
eyes staring glassily.</p>

<p>The door burst open and Straight rushed in. Behind him,
hesitating, as though disliking to set foot in Arnold Haslar's
house, came Sir Edward.</p>

<p>"What's this about Haslar's strong room and Miss Haslar?"
Straight asked.</p>

<p>"Know the password?" Pointer asked, but without any hope.
Straight only shook his head with a look of horror.</p>

<p>"You mean to say it's true? That she's been locked in there?"
he asked under his breath. "Isn't there a way of telling the
right word by listening to the fall of the tumblers?"</p>

<p>"Not with this safe," Pointer said gravely, "but there's still
time." His eyes rested for a fraction of a second on Hobbs&mdash;
"Still time."</p>

<p>Hobbs half stepped forward. Almost, Pointer thought, his hand
went towards the dial, but the neat brandy that he had drunk made
him wheel about and return to a chair in the shadow by the
window.</p>

<p>The safe-breaker arrived from the Yard. He set to work at once
with a pneumatic drill. Chemicals were out of the question
because of the girl inside.</p>

<p>"How did you hear of what had happened?" Pointer asked
Straight above the roar of the drill.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford got some one to telephone me. A commissionaire
at a concert hall, I understand. She seemed quite certain of what
had happened...But surely Miss Haslar can be got out all
right?"</p>

<p>"We must hope for the best," Pointer said none too
encouragingly. "If the safe had been standing wide open for a
little time before it was closed, she may have a better chance.
Our man is quite good as a rule. Sir Edward was with you, I
suppose?" Pointer finished.</p>

<p>"No, I ran into him in the garden outside," Straight explained
absently.</p>

<p>"I had something very important to say to Miss Haslar," Sir
Edward explained at once, retreating with Pointer to the farthest
end of the room; "I will tell you about it later, Chief
Inspector. A fact has come to my knowledge which makes me
wonder...However, Miss Haslar had not returned when I asked for
her at half-past four."</p>

<p>"You waited in for Miss Haslar?" Pointer asked, watching his
man try another way of tackling those immovable tumblers.</p>

<p>"No, I decided to call again later."</p>

<p>"Did you think the servant who let you out looked as though he
had just come in from outside?" Pointer asked next.</p>

<p>"I let myself out, so I cannot say. Looked as if he had come
in&mdash;?" Sir Edward began to repeat Pointer's odd question, a
question which had served its turn of learning that Clifford had
not been shown out.</p>

<p>Sir Edward looked round. Hobbs was out of earshot if he spoke
low.</p>

<p>"Hobbs is under arrest? So you know?"</p>

<p>"Know what, Sir Edward?"</p>

<p>"Straight came to me about it. It seems he <i>did</i> go
through the books yesterday and to-day. Straight suspected
Hobbs's accounts from something that Diana told him about a
letter which she opened by mistake. Straight says the books are
cooked: cleverly done, but he's certain they're cooked. He wants
another chartered accountant to go through them with him. He
speaks of something like fifty or sixty thousand not accounted
for. Of course in ten years..."</p>

<p>The man from the Yard approached Pointer.</p>

<p>"I'm beaten, sir. This latest pattern is beyond me. There's a
chap in Bermondsey, Silly Billy, he might do it. He's just out of
a stretch. Not a bad sort."</p>

<p>Bermondsey! From Hampstead to Bermondsey and back!</p>

<p>And to find Silly Billy. Meanwhile what of Diana? Pointer too
was very pale. It was an awful thing to be standing there
helpless and think of the agony just beginning so close beside
them. Must they chance gray powder, and the effects of it? Death
by chemicals was no worse than death by suffocation.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bookish, gray-haired, spectacled man, a typical
musician from his appearance, stood in the room. So swiftly, so
silently had Newman come in that only Pointer had seen him
enter.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12">CHAPTER 12</a></h2>

<p class="first">MRS. CLIFFORD hurried in after Newman. For once
she looked in great distress.</p>

<p>"Is Diana still locked in?" she asked before she was in the
room.</p>

<p>Straight jumped for her.</p>

<p>"The word, Mrs. Clifford! The new code-word. Do your by any
chance, know another word than <i>Visit?"</i></p>

<p>She shook her head in silent horror, then she turned to
Newman.</p>

<p>"Do you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know any other code-word than <i>Visit</i>." Newman
had flung down a box that was all but beyond even his wiry
strength. He tore it open, and began to lay out strange, bulky
things on the carpet with desperate speed.</p>

<p>"That word won't open it now." Pointer alone had not shown any
surprise at the return of the
secretary&mdash;disguised&mdash;accompanied by Mrs. Clifford. "I
can't reach Haslar's manager, nor could he help. The word has
been deliberately changed. Going to use electricity?"</p>

<p>Newman nodded. His eyes were unmistakably those of the master
of the situation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clifford had turned to her brother-in-law and
Straight.</p>

<p>"Mr. Newman telephoned to you? Oh, Edward, what shall we do?
What can we do? If only Julian were here, as he will be shortly
now, for this is Friday. Adrian, don't look so terrible," she
glanced at her cousin's awful face, "I'm sure we'll get her out
yet."</p>

<p>"Clear the room, please." Newman jerked out a box full of an
odd, gritty powder with a strong rust smell.</p>

<p>"You want no help? Our man, Burton, is a trained engineer,"
Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"I want the room cleared, that's all."</p>

<p>"Burton," Pointer turned to the man who had tried his hand at
the door and been beaten, "go below and stand by the main
switch." Pointer wanted no tampering. "Sinclair, you and Mr.
Hobbs go into the room opposite. Mrs. Clifford, if you and Sir
Edward&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll wait upstairs. I'll concentrate, and send down my
spirit to help."</p>

<p>"Thank you so much," Pointer said gravely, "and I'm sorry, Mr.
Straight, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Straight lingered.</p>

<p>"<i>Can</i> you do it?" he asked Newman imploringly, "a
blunder would only make it harder for the right man..."</p>

<p>"I shall not blunder. I was in the Secret Service, Mr.
Straight. You will see Miss Haslar out very soon, I hope." Newman
was already running his hands over the door.</p>

<p>"Mind if I watch you?" Pointer asked, when they were
alone.</p>

<p>Newman lifted his heavy lids and let them drop. "Rather you
didn't. I'm a nervous chap."</p>

<p>Pointer stood with his back to him and did not use a mirror.
But Newman did not sound nervous. Quick and sure, Pointer could
hear his movements at the safe. Burton had already knocked out
the spindle, Newman now began plugging the hole with desperate
speed, using the powder which he had brought with him. Then he
tested something with an electric apparatus which he put on the
table and connected with a wall-plug. It looked like some sort of
dwarf thermogenerator.</p>

<p>Next, after some calculations which he made swiftly but very
carefully on a little machine in his odd box, Newman started work
of a kind that Pointer could not follow. The expert from the Yard
arrived breathless.</p>

<p>"Am I too late? Can I do anything?"</p>

<p>Pointer indicated Newman.</p>

<p>"He thinks he can open that door. The code word's lost.
Evidently he's not trying to drill holes. What about it? It's
beyond me."</p>

<p>Cockerell stepped forward. He asked a few questions. Newman,
without slackening his lightning work, answered curtly enough. By
this time strange blue flashes were crackling around the dial
box, and forked lightning seemed to answer from the edges of the
closely-fitting door.</p>

<p>Cockerell looked excited.</p>

<p>"I've never seen this before&mdash;or have I? Wait a
bit...Where did I see work like this...that must have been done
on some such method&mdash;ordinary electricity was used then, of
course, but where...when?" The safe-breaking expert went off into
a deep study.</p>

<p>"Does he know his job?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"Rather! And yet&mdash;I should say better theoretically than
practically. Where did I once see something that reminds me of
this?..."</p>

<p>Suddenly Newman gave a little exclamation. His <i>crackle,
crackle</i> stopped. The blue and the yellow flashes no longer
seemed to fight each other. In the air was still the strange
electric smell of an X-ray room, but Newman was now pulling at
the door with cloths over his hands. It opened. Diana lay huddled
on the floor. Newman darted forward and picked her up. His
disguise had gone by this time. Wig and beard had been pulled off
in the heat of the work, and the sweat had washed the make-up
from his hands and face.</p>

<p>Diana clung to him.</p>

<p>"Sanz!" her arms went round his neck, "I called you, and you
came! I called you the whole time...with all my heart and all my
soul."</p>

<p>Her face was transfigured. Her beautiful hair clung in damp
curls to her finely-shaped head as a baby's does. She was pale.
Under her lids were purple shadows, but her eyes were like
stars.</p>

<p>"If you won't hold me fast, I shall you." She spoke with a
strange solemnity.</p>

<p>This was no laughing meeting of lovers. Diana knew what the
hand to which she clung might have done. Yet she clung to it.</p>

<p>"In spite of&mdash;everything?" he asked her gravely.</p>

<p>"In spite of&mdash;beyond&mdash;through&mdash;everything.
Don't put me down, Sanz. Don't let me go again."</p>

<p>He only looked at her&mdash;a searching look to which the
foreign sharpness of his features gave something rapier-like.
Standing there still holding her, he had a dark, virile beauty
which struck those watching him afresh.</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes fell on Pointer. A look of terror swept down
upon her face, putting out the light in it.</p>

<p>"I forgot; I betrayed you!" she stepped back from him, "and
then I called you and you came! Oh, Sanz, I've lured you into
their hands!"</p>

<p>"How do you mean that you betrayed me?" he asked quietly.</p>

<p>"I told them who you are. After your letter I&mdash;I thought
it was a love of justice, but I couldn't bear that they should
think you&mdash;it&mdash;a murder!" She whispered the last words,
her face gray again.</p>

<p>"But supposing it was one?" he interrupted in a hard
voice.</p>

<p>Diana made a helpless gesture.</p>

<p>"It's no use. I've tried to hate you for these years past,
I've fought till I'm tired. Life wasn't worth living. In there,
when the door banged shut, and I thought I should never see it
open again, I've learnt the truth."</p>

<p>He stopped her. He was as pale as she under all his dark
colouring.</p>

<p>"You forget that I'm wanted for murder. You forget the murder
of your uncle&mdash;the shooting of your brother." He spoke
almost roughly.</p>

<p>And at that Diana broke down.</p>

<p>He came across to her and took her face for a second between
his slender dark hands, gently, as one takes a flower. Then he
turned away.</p>

<p>Diana looked at Pointer.</p>

<p>"I must see him before he goes."</p>

<p>"You shall."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"Alone." Pointer passed her and went on into the strongroom,
carefully scrutinizing the boxes. It was dark inside here, except
for his lamp. The work on the door had put the lights inside out
of action. But there was something in here which he expected to
find...Suddenly his hand actually trembled for a second, when his
long, lean fingers felt over a well wrapped-up tin marked in a
scrawl:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">A. Haslar.</span></p>

<p class="letter">Not wanted forward. To be stored in a cold
place.</p>

<br>

<p>There was a dent in one side. It was heavy for its size, and
the size was that of a seven-pound tin.</p>

<p>Pointer carried it out. Then he saw that Mrs. Clifford was
back in the room, her arms around Diana. Pointer put the tin on a
table behind him, but his thoughts did not leave it. Inside it
was, he knew...</p>

<p>Alison Clifford would have helped the girl up to her room, but
Diana refused any help. Mrs. Clifford, smiling a little, moved
back. She caught her foot in a rug. To steady herself she laid a
hand on the tin which Pointer had just set down. There came the
oddest sound from her&mdash;a gasp, followed by a sort of
strangled cry. She fell forward across the table grasping the tin
in her arms.</p>

<p>"Julian! Oh, Julian!" She gave a frightful scream and tore at
the wrappings with her fingers, shrieking like a demented
woman.</p>

<p>"Hush, Mrs. Clifford," Pointer said firmly but very gently,
"for the sake of the sick man overhead, for your own sake, you
must not scream like that."</p>

<p>She had her hands still on the box, and the look in her eyes
frightened Diana, who had run to her. She thought that her reason
had gone.</p>

<p>"It's Julian's head!" Mrs. Clifford said in a strange,
horrible whisper to Sir Edward, who had come in hastily. "In
there! In that tin! His!"</p>

<p>This time Diana screamed&mdash;a low, horrified cry.</p>

<p>"Is she mad?" she whispered in mingled terror and pity.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford," Pointer said gravely, "I'm so sorry for this
horrible shock&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His eyes are closed," Mrs. Clifford was murmuring now in a
wild whisper.</p>

<p>Pointer forcibly lifted the box out of her grasp. He could not
let her continue to "see" what that face must look like now. Not
yet earth&mdash;no longer flesh.</p>

<p>"You know the truth now," he said gently.</p>

<p>Alison knelt on, trembling violently.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford," Pointer said again, "I must take this away
for a little while. You shall see your husband's body shortly,
believe me. But not like this! Not&mdash;" She did not seem to
heed him. Pointer thought that she had fainted. He would have
left her to the care of Diana and Sir Edward, but when he turned
away she clutched his sleeve. She almost tore the stout cloth of
his cuff.</p>

<p>"Give me that back! It's mine! Mine by every law of God and
man!"</p>

<p>"It is yours," Pointer said with real emotion, "but you must
let me put it where it belongs. You must give us"&mdash;he
glanced at the clock then at Sir Edward&mdash;"just one hour.
Then you shall see your husband's body, if you still wish to do
so, to-night."</p>

<p>She let him go at that and sat staring in front of her with a
terrible expression on her face. At once wild and lost, as of a
woman who felt the very foundations of her soul rocking within
her.</p>

<p>"I'll bring her. To the mortuary chapel, I suppose? Where
exactly is it?" Clifford asked. He himself was a ghastly
white.</p>

<p>"I'll leave my car. My man will know." Again Pointer turned
towards the door, that precious tin clasped in his arm.</p>

<p>This time it was Newman who stopped him.</p>

<p>"Aren't you forgetting me?" he asked shakily, "your prisoner?"
Like every one else in the room, whether they understood it or
not, he looked profoundly moved by what had just happened.</p>

<p>"No," Pointer said easily, "oh, no, Mr. Newman, I'm not
forgetting you. I must ask you to return to your old rooms at
Thornbush until I have an interview with you." Newman would be
better watched this time, Pointer knew.</p>

<p>Outside he saw Diana talking to Wilkins, her face convulsed.
He motioned to her to come into an empty room. She all but
refused.</p>

<p>"How did that tin come to be in this house at all?" he asked
her.</p>

<p>"It came from the warehouse early this afternoon," she replied
in a quiet, dull voice. There are points beyond which sensation
becomes numb. "Wilkins put it on the hall table thinking it was
sent up by mistake, or that I had asked for it. That is all he
knows about it. And all I know about it."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector gave a few more directions to the man in
charge of Hobbs. Then he drove off with his precious
tin&mdash;the tin for the sake of hiding which, so he believed, a
half-sober Hobbs had been willing to let Diana Haslar die a
frightful death.</p>

<p>The Commissioner and Major Pelham were present when the tin
was opened. The plaster was carefully sprayed away until that
appeared which they had expected to see, and which Mrs. Clifford
had apparently already seen in some strange way&mdash;the head of
Julian Clifford.</p>

<p>It had a bullet mark behind one ear.</p>

<p>An hour later, Mrs. Clifford followed with Sir Edward. The
head had been carefully joined to the severed neck, and a cloth
laid over the juncture. The face itself was made as little
repulsive as possible. The plaster had done much to preserve it,
and the warehouse chill had helped.</p>

<p>Sir Edward brought her in finally when word was sent out. She
tottered to the coffin, and stood bending over it for a long time
in silence. Then she dropped to her knees beside it.</p>

<p>"Ferryman, take me across? Oh, Ferryman, take me across!" The
choking cry brought tears to the eyes of a very stolid-looking
young policeman who was on duty in an unobtrusive corner.</p>

<p>"Poor soul! Mad, quite mad!" he said to himself; "talking
about ferries here."</p>

<p>Pointer could not let this tormented soul gather itself up in
peace, if tormented it really were. For Duse could have acted as
Alison Clifford had done here and at Haslar's house. Sarah
Bernhardt equalled that cry of pent-up passion bursting all
efforts at control. Gently he touched her arm.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford, who fired that shot?" he said insistently.
"Who killed your husband from behind without giving him a chance
to save himself?"</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear him.</p>

<p>"I was wrong," she murmured under her breath, adjusting the
sheet with what seemed like loving fingers. "'For here rolls the
sea, and even here lies the other shore. Not distant. Not
anywhere else." She turned and faced Pointer as though he had not
spoken, looking at him as at a strange and rather meddlesome
stranger.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford," Pointer repeated quietly, "no one Admires
Tagore more than I do. But he would be the first to say that here
lies duty as well. 'Here in this everlasting present.' And duty,
your duty to your dead husband, to the civilisation which has
sheltered you, which gave him the chance to become what he was,
is to aid us&mdash;or rather Justice&mdash;"</p>

<p>The widow sank into her chair. She covered her face with hands
that looked almost translucent. Edward Clifford watched her, his
own face drawn and haggard. When she finally showed hers again,
it was serene.</p>

<p>"I cannot help you, Chief Inspector. Please don't
misunderstand me." Her eyes on him, she paused. Keen, searching,
were the last words to apply to their gaze. Yet Pointer felt as
though she could see far&mdash;were seeing far. But he knew his
own face to be an impenetrable mask when he chose. It was so
now.</p>

<p>"I cannot help you," she said again, almost as to a child. "Or
rather what you stand for&mdash;the law, man-made law&mdash;man-made and therefore to me blind and cruel. My husband has passed
into another phase of life. Had he 'died,' to use your
expression, by what is called an act of God, you would not have
me try and avenge his death. Then why now? The result is the
same. All your efforts cannot light the empty lantern. The light
is shining where you cannot see it for the moment. Julian would
say the same."</p>

<p>"And the man who killed him?" Pointer asked coldly.</p>

<p>"The man who did it will suffer&mdash;will pay in another way.
I will not help you to make him pay in your way."</p>

<p>"Then the next murder he commits will be on your soul, Mrs.
Clifford," Pointer said very gravely.</p>

<p>Sir Edward started as though to speak, but checked himself.
"Justice is necessary," the Chief Inspector went on, "and human
punishment is necessary. Or we should be back among the head-hunters in no time. The wheel won't turn forward unless we put
our shoulders to it." He spoke intentionally in a matter-of-fact
voice: "Your husband was murdered, remember. Slaughtered as a
beast is slaughtered."</p>

<p>He paused. Her lids flickered and her eyes widened. She drew
in her breath sharply.</p>

<p>"He lies there crying to you for justice," Pointer ended
passionately.</p>

<p>"His body lies there, Chief Inspector," she corrected, but
apparently with an effort. "Julian Clifford is as much as ever he
was; as near! as dear!" Suddenly two large drops rose and hung on
her lashes. They gave the finishing touch to her face. Even
Pointer felt his anger melt within him. Surely this woman was
what she seemed.</p>

<p>"What was the reason for which Mr. Clifford left his home on
Monday night? Why were you so sure he was in safety?" he
continued.</p>

<p>She gave a cry at that and wrung her hands.</p>

<p>"Did you think he was in Bruges buying the Charlemagne
crystal?" he persisted.</p>

<p>She interrupted him. "To think I believed him safe! To think I
thought I saw him in the crystal! Then what did I see? How did I
see?" She stared wild-eyed at Pointer.</p>

<p>She looked shaken to the heart. Pointer said nothing. If this
were not acting, then he realised that the woman must have had
such a shock as to be near the confines of what could be
borne.</p>

<p>"I who thought I could see further than others!" she murmured.
"But I <i>did</i> see Julian in the crystal...just as I saw Diana
a little while ago. She was there where I saw her. Then why not
Julian? Why not my husband?" she asked wildly.</p>

<p>"You have very wonderful gifts, Mrs. Clifford," he said
quietly, "but you could not see what was not there, the dead
among the living. I think your own imagination, your own belief
as to where your husband was, projected itself into that
crystal."</p>

<p>She was, or seemed to be, too exhausted to be questioned
further, and he helped Sir Edward put her into her car and take
her home to where a "nurse" from Scotland Yard was waiting to
look after her&mdash;with a most vigilant eye.</p>

<p>Her objections to helping him find the criminal, were they
solely as she represented them?</p>

<p>Pointer's profession, one he greatly respected, led along so
many dark and twisted paths of the human heart. As a doctor
spends his days at sick beds beside diseased bodies, so did the
Chief Inspector's work take him among diseased minds. It was
inevitable that he should distrust appearances as much as any
mystic. Given hesitation on the part of the angel Gabriel,
Pointer would have distrusted him. What, then, of Mrs. Clifford?
She had cashed that cheque for notes, some of which Diana Haslar
had taken to Mrs. Orr. Pointer believed that Diana had been given
them by Edward Hobbs, Mrs. Clifford's cousin.</p>

<p>Tindall came hurrying in. The telephone had brought him the
news. Both men were waiting for the police surgeon to make a
summary examination of what had been hidden in the tin.</p>

<p>"Amazing about Mrs. Clifford," the F.O. man said tensely. "Did
she know beforehand what the tin contained? Or did she 'see' into
it? If the former, she knew that it would be opened within a very
few minutes."</p>

<p>"She may have seen what I was seeing, and seeing tremendously
keenly," Pointer suggested. "My mind was full of what I felt sure
was inside that tin, what I guessed I should find on the shelf in
that strong room. Just as sitting close beside Mr. Newman at a
concert she got the message which Miss Haslar says she was
sending him. Certainly she could not have known by any ordinary
means that Miss Haslar was locked in that safe. I shouldn't
wonder if whenever she reads a sealed letter, as they tell me she
can do at times, or sees into a locked box, if there were some
one in the room who knew what the letter or the box contained.
She saw through Newman's disguise apparently, but then Newman
would have recognised her at once, and must have been very
conscious of her presence beside him."</p>

<p>"Thought-reading, in short?" Tindall asked dubiously.</p>

<p>"Always supposing it's not guilty knowledge," Pointer agreed.
"I noticed her cousin Hobbs walked away to the window while she
looked into the crystal, and 'saw' the stepped gables&mdash;saw
her own thoughts, I take it, supposing she's innocent."</p>

<p>"This is going to be a slow, intricate case," Tindall said
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Intricate, certainly, but Pointer did not think it would be
slow. He made no reply.</p>

<p>"How did Miss Haslar come to be locked into the safe, and who
in the world put the head there?" Tindall asked, almost tearing
his hair.</p>

<p>Pointer only turned to take the doctor's report which a man
had just brought in.</p>

<p>The bullet had just failed to pass entirely through the lower
part of the back of the head from left to right and was easily
taken out. It was the kind to fit a .25 automatic, and had been
fired from too far off to singe or blacken the skin.</p>

<p>"It fits Haslar's automatic," Pointer murmured. "No one else
at Thornbush seems to own a weapon of any kind, except Sir Edward
Clifford. He, too, has a .25&mdash;a common enough type."</p>

<p>"Haslar's warehouse&mdash;Haslar's revolver!" murmured
Tindall. "I've taken the liberty, by the way, of putting one of
our men as well on guard outside Thornbush. I confess I expected
Etcheverrey to be detained. Or are you leaving him to me?"</p>

<p>"I'd like nothing done about him till to-morrow," Pointer said
thoughtfully, "just as I want to keep my own counsel for that
time."</p>

<p>"After his accomplices, eh? Good! So Etcheverrey's under our
hands again. Rather fine of him coming hack to save Miss Haslar,
after that confession of his. Sort of thing he might be expected
to do, though. Twisted nature his, with odd streaks of generosity
in it."</p>

<p>Tindall accompanied Pointer to his rooms in Scotland Yard. Sir
Edward had spoken of going there as soon as he had seen Mrs.
Clifford home. Evidently he had something important to say, and
something important to ask. He did not keep them waiting
long.</p>

<p>"Now Chief Inspector, how did you learn about the Charlemagne
crystal and Bruges?" Edward Clifford began at once. "Mrs.
Clifford only told me that in strict confidence last night. Hobbs
had hinted at it in the train, and obviously Julian had had it in
his mind when he questioned me about paying over large sums so
that they could not be traced. But how did you learn of it?"</p>

<p>"In the course of some routine work," Pointer said evasively.
"I expect, however, to get fuller details from Mr. Hobbs
presently."</p>

<p>"Hobbs!" Sir Edward made a wry face. "Yon certainly let no
grass grow under your feet in his case either. Straight had only
just told me of the defalcation. Straight found"&mdash;Sir Edward
now turned to Tindall&mdash;"Straight found that Hobbs has cooked
the books for the last ten years or so. And to the tune of a
large fortune. He wants a first-class man to go through the books
with him. The Chief Inspector was right in his suspicions of
Hobbs."</p>

<p>They had not been suspicions with Pointer. The belief in the
existence of heavy defalcations was the bed-rock of one half of
Pointer's theory as to what had happened to Julian Clifford.</p>

<p>"And what about that cheque?" Sir Edward again addressed
himself exclusively to Pointer. "Did Hobbs pay it over? He handed
it to Mrs. Clifford to cash yesterday morning, telling her that
Julian had enclosed it in the note which he had left for him.
Hobbs's story is that in that letter Julian wrote that he had
received word too late of some urgent necessity, some hitch,
which only his own presence over in Bruges would smooth out, and
that he was leaving at once, shortly after midnight on a
returning fruit-cargo boat. Julian had all sorts of odd friends.
The boat would get to Zeebrugge at eight Tuesday morning, and my
brother would be at de Coninck's house by ten. He had to leave
the cheque for Hobbs to cash and forward the money. Hobbs had a
very busy morning ahead of him yesterday, and asked Mrs. Clifford
to go to the bank for the money. She knew what was on foot.</p>

<p>"My brother intended the crystal as a surprise for her, but
she had, it seems, overheard some words of his to Mrs. Orr which
had told her what he was about. But as he had set his heart on
surprising her, she kept up, before him, the pretence of knowing
nothing. So Mrs. Clifford cashed her husband's cheque at once on
Tuesday morning, and handed Hobbs the money. He assures me that
there really is a Selfe assisting Mrs. Orr at the Bruges end, and
that the cheque is perfectly in order. Mrs. Clifford, when I
asked her a few questions, she cannot talk much about it yet,
confirmed all this. She added that Mrs. Orr pressed her very hard
to let her take the money over. She, too, was going to Bruges,
and was, as I suppose you know too, acting in the affair for her
sister, the wife of the newly-appointed director of the West
Flanders Museum, that great building that's just been built
outside Bruges. The director was not to appear in the affair at
all. But Mrs. Clifford preferred to carry out what she believed
to be Julian's instructions. Were they his instructions?" Sir
Edward looked hard at Pointer, who only stirred his tea
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"If not," Clifford's hand shook a little, "the murderer must
be&mdash;But I confess I find Julian's death a deeper and deeper
mystery the more I study it. I, too, found out a piece of
evidence yesterday&mdash;not bearing on Hobbs, however, but on
Haslar. Mrs. Clifford handed me Julian's diary when I pressed her
for dates and hours. In that diary there's an entry about the
discovery in an old bureau that belonged to Sir William Haslar's
private secretary, or at least was always used by him, of two
copies of letters which had been sent to the writer's wife, some
thirty years ago now. He was killed in a carriage accident. She
died shortly afterwards. In them this man, Walton was his name,
accuses Sir William of very terrible things. Subversion of party
funds, and what practically amounts to blackmail. They're
poisonous imputation though there have been whispers at times
that Sir William did sail very close to the wind now and then. My
brother makes a note to say that he intends in fairness to the
public to have these letters inserted as an appendix in his
coming Life. He notes down the indignation of Diana, but
especially of her brother Arnold. Diana, according to Julian, was
certain after the first shock, that no one would credit the
allegations. But Arnold Haslar took it differently.</p>

<p>"There is an entry only this last Thursday in which Julian
records that Arnold practically threatened him with violence if
he dared to defame a dead man by printing those libels. My
brother apparently was quoting Arnold's exact words. I have no
idea where the letters are. I asked Hobbs, and he told me the
very disquieting fact that Julian had had them on him when he
left Thornbush&mdash;carried them on his person. He distrusted
Miss Haslar, believed that in spite of her apparent acquiescence,
she might steal the letters. And after all, family pride is a
very strong chain. Now, Chief Inspector, where do we stand? I
confess I am puzzled. Here are the defalcations&mdash;not yet
proven, it is true&mdash;but Straight says he'll go bail that
he's right, and believes it's not far short of a hundred thousand
pounds has gone. Julian never lived up to his income, I knew.
Here's the fact of these Haslar letters with the fury of Arnold
Haslar at the idea of their being published&mdash;Arnold Haslar,
who called out that he 'did it for nothing!' Arnold Haslar, who
knew about the missing head, and who the murdered man was, when
the only printed information was that the corpse was Etcheverrey!
But then, what about Etcheverrey himself?"</p>

<p>Still Pointer did not reply. He only nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Are we wrong about those destroyed pages in my brother's
manuscript: the pages pointing straight to Etcheverrey&mdash;to
Newman?"</p>

<p>This time Pointer did look up.</p>

<p>"It's a very intricate case," he agreed, "but I think&mdash;I
<i>think</i> that the pages of Mr. Julian Clifford's coming novel
were taken and destroyed because of what was in them. And I think
that because of the information shortly to be published through
them, Mr. Clifford was murdered." And Pointer inhospitably rose
and with an apology ended the few minutes' talk. He was at work
before the door closed behind them. The paper in which the tin
box had been wrapped was of an unusually good quality. It matched
some which Pointer had seen at Thornbush&mdash;paper in which his
publishers sent Julian Clifford his proofs. Who would open Mr.
Clifford's proofs? Newman probably. And the string...Pointer
found within the half-hour that the string was the same as the
ball on Newman's writing table.</p>

<p>Pointer drove on to the warehouse. He found the night watchman
just closing shutters and gates. From him he learnt that the box
had been handed to a pensioned-off night watchman very early
Tuesday morning. The man was only called in for extra duty when,
as then, the regular man was busy on some especial job. This
extra watchman had put the box in the cellar, but had forgotten
to mention the fact to any one. It was only by chance that to-day, Friday, he had learnt of Mr. Dance's inquiry, and by that
time, unfortunately, the foreman had mislaid the address given
him by the manager to which any such parcel was to be sent. The
men preferred not to mention this fact to Dance, but sent the
package to Mr. Haslar's house, believing that though down with
the flu, he could still see about his own parcels.</p>

<p>Pointer went to interview the ex-night watchman. He left him
not much the wiser. A car had driven up to the gates of the
warehouse about three on Tuesday morning. The driver had got down
and handed him a parcel, saying that Mr. Haslar wanted it taken
care of according to instructions which he had written on it. But
he did not want it entered on the books, as it would not be left
for long. With that the man had clambered back into his seat,
turned the car, and driven off. Stanley, the man who took the
tin, had marked it K for the cold storage, and, after putting it
in the appropriate cellar, had forgotten all about it until to-day. His belief that it was Mr. Haslar's chauffeur who had called
in the car rested on mere assumption. He had too little to do
with the warehouse nowadays to know Arnold Haslar's car or
driver. He could not even describe the latter. He might have been
Arnold Haslar himself, and he might not.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13">CHAPTER 13</a></h2>

<p class="first">POINTER drove to the police station where Hobbs
was lodged in a comfortable enough room. The shock of the arrest
had cleared his brain. He was quite himself again now, and had
ordered, and eaten, a very good dinner.</p>

<p>"Why am I being detained here? Why is bail refused, if it's on
any charge for which you have a right to detain me? Why am I not
allowed to communicate with my solicitor?" he began in the tone
of a man who had determined to take the upper hand.</p>

<p>"Bail is never allowed on a murder charge, Mr. Hobbs." Pointer
took a chair.</p>

<p>Hobbs was holding himself in with some difficulty.</p>

<p>"Murder? Whose murder? What murder?"</p>

<p>"The murder of Julian Clifford. And, if we see fit, the
attempted murder of Miss Haslar through a plan concocted together
with Mrs. Orr in Bruges where she posed as her unmarried half-sister, a Béguine there called Soeur Thérèse. Mrs. Orr was really
quite talkative when I explained how things stood over here. She
had no idea Julian Clifford was dead."</p>

<p>Hobbs's face twitched.</p>

<p>"You don't think you can get away with this sort of stuff with
me, do you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It's the truth, Mr. Hobbs. Mrs. Orr is not the kind to throw
good money after bad. She gave us every help, like the sensible
woman that she is. We have, as I told you, the money you sent her
by Miss Haslar. Five thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Ay, yes, the money that was sent to straighten things out, if
necessary. Sir Edward told you about Mr. Clifford's proposed
purchase of the Charlemagne crystal. Needless to say, the money I
sent her, except her own promised rake-off of one thousand, was
only deposited with Mrs. Orr, so to speak. She was expected to
account for it very strictly. As to her own commission, I saw no
reason why she should be the loser because Mr. Clifford's
terrible end had cut short the negotiations."</p>

<p>"Especially after she had inserted that personal in the
<i>Times</i> of yesterday, Tuesday? 'Hobby. Five needed instantly
as promised. No letters. May.' She says a small official in the
new museum had heard something about the proposed sale. And the
money found on you when you were searched just now! A nice sum,
Mr. Hobbs. The remainder of the cheque for seventy thousand, as
well as some bearer bonds."</p>

<p>"I was carrying that sum according to Julian Clifford's
instructions," Hobbs retorted. "It now returns to his estate, of
course. Now that I know, what I did not believe until this
afternoon, that he is dead. You know why that cheque was cashed.
Whatever happened to Mr. Clifford after he wrote those notes
which each of us at Thornbush got Tuesday morning, I was only
carrying out instructions."</p>

<p>Pointer shook his head. "It won't do, Mr. Hobbs. We've had an
accountant looking into the books. According to him you've had
altogether not far short of a hundred thousand pounds already out
of Mr. Clifford's fortune."</p>

<p>Hobbs did not question the figure.</p>

<p>"The new librarian, Straight, was the accountant, I suppose? I
thought that was his game! But you'll have to have reasonable
proof, better proof than that before arresting me for
murder."</p>

<p>"We have ample proof of motive," Pointer said tranquilly.
"Really quite good. Just let me run the facts over to you, Mr.
Hobbs. There is the systematic robbery extending over many
years&mdash;about ten, Straight thinks. Mr. Clifford evidently
made some discovery&mdash;you determined to kill him at once. You
were already getting ready to leave England with Mrs. Orr. She
had determined to throw in her lot with you when she found that
her name must be published in a coming divorce suit. But before
you both went off to subsist quite pleasantly on the money you
had accumulated, you thought that the Charlemange crystal would
give you the opportunity for additional loot. You never intended
Mr. Clifford to get the crystal. What you did intend was to see
that Mr. Hobbs got the seventy thousand which you and Mrs. Orr
claimed was being asked by the town for it. You have no alibi for
Monday night. You lured Mr. Clifford to Fourteen Heath Mansions,
or you took advantage of some one else's having lured him there,
followed him, and murdered him. You cut off his head, packed it
in plaster in a biscuit tin, wrapped it in some paper in which
Mr. Clifford's proofs had been sent home, tied it with string
from Mr. Newman's ball, and took it to Mr. Haslar's warehouse,
rightly thinking that in the ordinary course it would not be
detected there for a long time&mdash;long after you had left
England. How much chance will you have in the dock against that
story, Mr. Hobbs? Remember your palm prints on the spade handle
through the opening in the gloves you carefully wore."</p>

<p>That last improvised touch did it. Hobbs sagged down in his
chair, his mouth working.</p>

<p>"I'm innocent!" he said at last in a hoarse voice, "innocent
of all the charges."</p>

<p>"You <i>can't</i> be innocent of both the charge of
embezzlement and the charge of murder, Mr. Hobbs. Your one chance
to clear yourself of the capital charge is to prove to me that
Mr. Clifford's death absolutely disarranged your plans."</p>

<p>Hobbs sat a moment, then he straightened up. He had feared as
much from the beginning of the interview, but had hoped to avoid
a confession.</p>

<p>"I warn you, of course," Pointer went on, "that anything you
say about Mr. Clifford's death may have to be used in evidence,
whether against you or another, but anything that you tell me
about other matters will be considered as confidential, except
where it touches on the murder."</p>

<p>"What does Edward Clifford say?"</p>

<p>"I haven't discussed the matter with him. The only bargain I
can make with you, Mr. Hobbs," Pointer said with steel in his
voice, "is that one lie, and you may find yourself arrested on a
capital charge. But, on the other hand, if you tell frankly all
that you know, we may waive the accusation of attempted murder. I
can make no promises, of course."</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you exactly what happened," Hobbs said finally,
"it's my best chance with you, I see. It may help&mdash;I think
it will. Monday night I sat out in the garden till about ten.
When I came in, I found a note on the telephone pad for me from
Mr. Clifford asking me to go after him to Fourteen Heath
Mansions, where he would wait for me. No name was given of the
flat's owner. I was rather surprised, for I had no idea that he
knew any one there. But I went to the address, used an automatic
corner lift&mdash;I had a friend who lived there once, so I knew
my way about. As I stepped out of the lift on to the landing, my
scarf caught in the lift door. I stopped to put it right. Had to
peel off my gloves, and stepped over to the window ledge to lay
them down. That brought me to one side of the landing in the
shadow. While I was rewinding the scarf, the door of Number
Fourteen opened suddenly, and a man thrust his head out, looked
around, and then slipped out and closed the door, standing still
again for a moment to listen. I was just going to move towards
him when he ran down the stairs as light as a cat. Well, I was
startled. I stepped to the door and caught hold of the little
brass knocker. It gave&mdash;the door was open. Apparently the
lock hadn't caught. I couldn't understand the affair at all. But
I knew that Clifford had the Haslar letters with him in a letter-case. I called his name. No one answered. I walked into the first
room to my right and there I found
him&mdash;dead&mdash;shot&mdash;sitting with his head sunk
forward on his breast...he was quite warm. There was no weapon to
be seen.</p>

<p>"Well,"&mdash;Hobbs stopped and lit a cigar with a match that
quivered&mdash;"I was appalled. There's no use pretending that
Julian Clifford's death wasn't the end of things for me. Edward
Clifford, or any other executor, would run a very careful eye
over accounts. I couldn't cover my tracks under a couple of days'
intensive work, and I wasn't ready to fly at once&mdash;I daren't
with a murdered man. Then there was the cheque for seventy
thousand pounds which Clifford carried ready to cash when
necessary, and which, as you know, we'd been working for. I
thought of taking his body off with me, but you can't carry dead
people around town. I thought of all sorts of things. Then I
remembered that on coming in, I had come by a corner door&mdash;I
had noticed some workmen's tools and sacking. I thought of a
sack, and of dumping the body into the river somewhere. I went
downstairs and found that there was no empty sack. But there was
an empty tin, a tin large enough to contain a head. I went back
to Thornbush, got my car out&mdash;by some lucky chance the
chauffeur had the evening off&mdash; took along with me some
paper and string, left the car not far from Heath Mansions,
walked in by the same way, still without meeting any one. The
porters and people were all in the big, central, well-lit part. I
took the tin and a spade up with me. The spade went under a loose
topcoat which I had put on at Thornbush when I went back for the
wrapping material. I had left the door with the latch caught
back. I went in, took off Clifford's clothes, did them up into
two parcels, and addressed them to fictitious names&mdash;I've
forgotten what names, or where, for then I took the head..." His
voice shook. "I don't need any punishment for having done that.
It's punishment enough. I see it night and day. Shall see
it...You can't do a thing like that and be the same man
afterwards. However...I poured plaster into the tin, and so on,
as you already know. And after some thought I decided that the
best place for it would be Haslar's warehouse. He had once told
me how things got snowed under in the cellars, do what they
would. Besides, I thought then that there was a poetic justice
about it, for I believed that Haslar had killed Julian
Clifford."</p>

<p>"But we found the tin on a shelf in Mr. Haslar's strong room,"
Pointer said doubtfully.</p>

<p>Hobbs swore at himself. "Like a fool I put it there when I
went to Arnold Haslar's this afternoon and found it on the hall
table."</p>

<p>"And what took you to Mr. Haslar's house?"</p>

<p>Hobbs kept sullen silence for a moment. Then, "I had found the
Haslar letters Wednesday night which had been on Mr. Clifford
before his death, and for which I had been looking everywhere,
letters which only interested Haslar, in a secret drawer in his
library along with Clifford's umbrella. I forgot the letters
while talking to Miss Haslar, and getting her to take some money
across for me to Mrs. Orr. I knew quite well that I was watched
by day, but I thought I could slip across at night and get them.
They were better destroyed."</p>

<p>"That version won't do, Mr. Hobbs," Pointer said decidedly.
"You took those letters from Mr. Clifford's body&mdash;from his
dead body you maintain&mdash;when you took the cheque. Just as
you&mdash;not Haslar&mdash;took the umbrella, hacked it into
pieces to get it into a parcel with the clothes, and then found
after all that it was too awkward to manage."</p>

<p>This was only the sounding of a pilot going carefully in
difficult waters.</p>

<p>"You went out for a walk on Tuesday morning as soon as you
came down. You walked over to Mr. Haslar's house, let yourself
in, or found the door open and walked in, and put the umbrella in
that secret partition. You could easily hide the umbrella on you,
or carry it in a roll of maps or papers...Then when the whole
affair began to get unpleasantly hot, you decided that the
letters which you were carrying on you must be hidden somewhere.
Somewhere known only to yourself. Some hiding-place, moreover,
that would tell against the person in whose presumed possession
they were found, should they be found. Mr. Haslar is not likely
to open any of his drawers for a long time, so to Mr. Haslar's
old bureau you carried them Wednesday night. Miss Haslar caught
you with them in your hand. You pretended, of course, that you
had just taken them out of the place where her brother had hidden
them."</p>

<p>That Diana had actually seen Hobbs with letters in his hand
which it was known that Julian Clifford had been carrying on
Monday night, the night when he was murdered, was one of the
things that explained why she ran so much danger in going to the
Béguinage. Why, once her help was no longer needed, it was not
intended that she should return to England.</p>

<p>Pointer reasoned&mdash;rightly&mdash;that when Hobbs had to
send the money to Mrs. Orr by some carrier who he believed was
not being watched, he was in a quandary. Whoever was taken into
his counsel, however slightly, would be a permanent danger to him
and to Mrs. Orr. That person had therefore better be silenced.
Hobbs, so Pointer believed, chose Diana both because she could be
easily induced to take the letter, and because she would be as
well out of the way. She knew too much. She had opened a letter
meant for Hobbs, Sir Edward said. One that had made her suspect
that the literary agent's entries were not accurate. She was a
grave menace. Once let the idea that Hobbs had been robbing his
brother take root in Sir Edward's mind, and&mdash;supposing that
he himself knew nothing of the crime&mdash;then, in spite of
Newman's confession, Hobbs's chance of getting away with, or
without, the money for the crystal would be small.</p>

<p>"You decided this afternoon to get back those letters in order
to frighten her into silence if things went wrong," Pointer
continued, "that is, if she should by any chance return from
Bruges. And that was why you went to Mr. Haslar's house when you
fancied yourself unwatched. You evidently have a latchkey. You
let yourself in this afternoon, and the first thing you saw was
that tin in the hall. You put it in the strong room whose
password you knew, like most of Mr. Haslar's friends. And because
it was there, Miss Haslar had been locked in by you when you
thought she had gone in after it&mdash;you refused to say to what
word you had set the dial." Pointer bit back with difficulty his
comments on what had happened.</p>

<p>"I forgot the word." But Hobbs's eyes did not meet the
other's. "Besides, I'd had a glass of brandy. Neat too. Who
wouldn't, when they found that damned tin resurrected, and
staring at them from a hall table? Ever since that night in the
flat I've only kept going by&mdash;" He pulled himself up and sat
biting at his cigarette.</p>

<p>"And the crystal was never intended to be really a sale?"</p>

<p>Hobbs set his teeth for a second. "No, just a plant. We had
decided to burn our boats, Mrs. Orr and I. As soon as we got hold
of the notes for the cheque, I was to leave England and join her.
But I couldn't get off at once, things had come too much in a
rush for that. And by Tuesday evening I was told by Edward
Clifford and you that the body had been identified."</p>

<p>"Did Newman know about the crystal?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not! He was our greatest danger. Of course had I
had an idea of the truth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What truth?" Pointer asked casually.</p>

<p>"Why, the reason for which he killed Julian Clifford. That he
was in love with my cousin. Mrs. Orr had long suspected as much.
I had always laughed at the idea."</p>

<p>"It was Mrs. Orr's notion to get Mrs. Clifford into things
too? So that if they went wrong there would be your cousin to
fall back on?" Pointer asked in his most colourless voice.</p>

<p>"That was the idea," Hobbs said shortly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford believed the crystal was to be genuinely
bought?"</p>

<p>"Oh, lord, yes! Only thing she had ever wanted. She had seen
it in Bruges some years ago, and told Julian then that she would
give her eyes to possess it. That was quite enough for him. He
wanted it as a sort of peace-offering for his frequent absences,
I think."</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Clifford believed that Mr. Julian Clifford left for
Bruges on Monday night?"</p>

<p>Hobbs nodded.</p>

<p>"And the letters left in Julian Clifford's name?"</p>

<p>Hobbs hesitated. "It's a bad business. But it's not murder. I
wrote the letters, of course, the letters signed by Clifford's
name. There's nothing easier than what's called forgery. No one
ever thinks of doubting a letter when they see a familiar name at
the foot. I had to do something to keep people from suspecting
what had happened. I knew about what to say in each, of course.
Fondest love to Alison. Poor girl. General directions to Newman
to carry on. Same to Diana. Straight was to start on the subject-index I'd heard Clifford speak of. I wrote the notes Tuesday
morning after leaving the tin."</p>

<p>"You think Mrs. Clifford had no doubts throughout as to the
genuineness of the two she got?"</p>

<p>"None whatever. A baby in swaddling clothes could deceive my
cousin."</p>

<p>"And was it usual with Mr. Clifford to leave her like
that&mdash; with only a written note for good-bye?'</p>

<p>"He had done it at least once before, I knew, when he was at
work on a serial. He never worked out his serials beforehand. I
remembered that on that occasion he had scribbled her a line,
poked it under her door, and been out of the house when she got
up."</p>

<p>Pointer nodded. "I see. Now, as to the cheque? We know, of
course, that you altered the name to Selfe. But how did you
account for the name to Mrs. Clifford, I mean?"</p>

<p>"I told her Selfe was the man through whom the crystal would
actually be purchased."</p>

<p>"And the second letter, also in Mr. Clifford's writing, the
letter which Mrs. Clifford received Wednesday morning at
breakfast? The letter posted in Bruges by Mrs. Orr?"</p>

<p>Hobbs grinned sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Well, naturally, I had to take it from her desk and destroy
it. It wouldn't have deceived either of you. It wasn't meant to.
It was meant to do what it did. Keep my cousin, Mrs. Clifford,
quiet."</p>

<p>Again here was a silence.</p>

<p>"Now about the man whom you saw coming out of the flat at
Heath Mansions. Did you recognise him?"</p>

<p>Hobbs gave him a long look. "You're clever, Chief Inspector,
damned clever. But you'll get a surprise. The man I saw was
Straight."</p>

<p>"The new librarian? The man who has just found out the
defalcations?" Pointer murmured equably. "Indeed. You saw him
clearly enough to swear to?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been any one else? Any one of about his
height and general appearance?"</p>

<p>"You mean Edward Clifford? It might easily have been. He's
always been in love with my cousin. But as it happened, it was
Straight."</p>

<p>Pointer sat on a moment, looking at his shoes.</p>

<p>"One thing more, Mr. Hobbs. Mr. Clifford made some notes on
his novel, the novel that is coming out in the <i>Arcturus</i>.
They're not among his papers. Do you know where they are?"</p>

<p>"I've nothing to do with any notes of Clifford's," Hobbs said
impatiently, "if they're lost, it's no use coming to me."</p>

<p>"Would Newman know about them?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"He might. But Clifford, as a rule, saw to everything to do
with his writing himself. Newman's work was social. Clifford, of
course, got invitations and letters by the ton."</p>

<p>"But I suppose Mr. Newman typed out Mr. Clifford's
manuscript?"</p>

<p>"No. Clifford did his typing himself. He revised too,
constantly. As a rule his work went straight from him to his
publishers. Though Newman would have the actual sending or taking
of it, after I had settled about terms."</p>

<p>"Would Newman know beforehand what was coming in a novel?"</p>

<p>Hobbs yawned. His face was lined with weariness&mdash;nerve
weariness.</p>

<p>"Couldn't say. Clifford had taken to discussing his coming
book <i>The Soul of Ishmael</i> with him lately."</p>

<p>Again there was a silence...of utter fatigue on Hobbs's part.
Pointer rose.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Hobbs, of course I must verify your statements as
far as possible. Meantime you're at liberty to return to
Thornbush. Sorry, but I must insist on its being Thornbush. Sir
Edward has not spoken. Straight can be trusted not to speak when
he's asked not to. Until to-morrow, when other arrangements can
be made, the household at Thornbush must remain as it is. No
restrictions will be put on any reasonable outings."</p>

<p>Pointer saw Hobbs off, and then telephoned to Thornbush. Was
Straight there? He was. So was Miss Haslar, who had not yet
returned to her brother's house.</p>

<p>Pointer found them deep in talk.</p>

<p>"Maud Gillingham would be just the wife for you," Diana was
saying as Pointer stopped for a second outside the door.</p>

<p>"I want you two to see more of each other. I shall never
marry. I shall wait for Sam and another life. But Maud is ever so
much sweeter tempered than I am, and she's biddable, which I
should never have been. Also she's got pots more money."</p>

<p>"Diana!" Straight protested, without any over-vehemence. After
all, Diana had openly chosen the Basque anarchist.</p>

<p>Pointer entered and asked Straight for an interview. Diana
turned to Richard.</p>

<p>"Please let me stay! Oh, Dick, please let me hear the worst. I
know&mdash;I know that&mdash;that it may be hard hearing, but I
can't be kept out of this. For Arnold and Sanz both keep me in
it. In its heart. Please, Chief Inspector, let me stay."</p>

<p>"It rests with Mr. Straight," Pointer said at once; "if he has
no objection, I have none."</p>

<p>"Stay, then, Diana, but you mustn't mind if I have to say
things, and say them in a way that may hurt you," Straight warned
her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Straight," Pointer began promptly, "we have just had a
piece of information which concerns you."</p>

<p>Straight had not expected this. He sat up.</p>

<p>"You were seen last Monday night leaving Fourteen Heath
Mansions after Mr. Clifford was shot, and leaving it in a hasty,
almost furtive manner. Can you explain this?"</p>

<p>Diana gave a gasp of resentment, but Straight silenced her
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Patience, Di!" He turned to the detective officer. "I left
Heath Mansions after Mr. Clifford arrived, but not after he was
shot. Your witness is lying there. It's an odd story; but it
won't help the case forward at all."</p>

<p>"It should have been told me," Pointer said stiffly.</p>

<p>"And it would have been told you. But I like to think things
over. Also, it implicates a friend."</p>

<p>"Arnold?" breathed Diana.</p>

<p>"Arnold," the name came reluctantly.</p>

<p>"And the story?" Pointer asked. Still Straight hesitated.
"I'll try not to jump to conclusions," Pointer promised.</p>

<p>"Well, as I told you, I dropped in at Haslar's on Monday after
dinner, but found that he was unexpectedly called out of
town."</p>

<p>Straight paused.</p>

<p>"Did he give you any idea of why and where?"</p>

<p>Pointer had asked this before. Then Straight had given an
evasive reply, now he said, "None. I think he was inclined to,
but he finally said, 'You're too straight-laced a chap, Dick, my
son. We will not blacken your innocent soul with the night's dark
deeds.' I decided to go for a walk, it was a heavenly evening,
and turn in early. I had only landed that morning. I walked about
the heath at random, and then made for Thornbush. Passing what I
now know to be Heath Mansions, I ran into Mr. Clifford. He
stopped me, asked me if I'd mind dropping a couple of letters in
a pillar-box for him, and then coming on after him to flat
Fourteen in the building to which he pointed. He
added"&mdash;Straight looked at Diana as though asking her to
forgive him&mdash;"he added that he expected to have rather an
unpleasant interview with Arnold Haslar. Would I mind coming
up?"</p>

<p>"He had left a message for Hobbs, but Hobbs mightn't get it in
time. I wasn't very keen on an unpleasant interview between my
friend and my employer. Mr. Clifford evidently read as much in my
face, for he said, 'It's all right. I only want to borrow your
eyes. Haslar has just telephoned me that he has a friend who
lives there and who can prove that certain letters which I
believe to be genuine are forgeries.' With that he turned in at
the gates of the flats. I didn't find a letter-box at once.
Doubtless I passed several. When I got back, I walked up the
stairs and to my surprise found the door of Number Fourteen ajar.
I rang, and then, as no one came, I walked in. The door of a room
on my right was open. There sat Mr. Clifford at a little side
table beside a lamp, reading a letter. He glanced up and said,
'It's all right, Straight. I shan't need you after all. Sorry
to've given you the trouble of coming up here for nothing.' I
murmured something and went out. As I closed the door, Mr.
Clifford said something which I didn't quite catch. But I
think&mdash; I only <i>think</i>, mind you, Chief Inspector, that
it was 'Newman's here. I shall be quite all right.'"</p>

<p>"Newman!" Diana echoed in a little gasp.</p>

<p>"I may have heard him incorrectly. His back was to me and he
spoke hurriedly. At any rate, I went on out. In the doorway I
heard"&mdash;again he glanced at Diana&mdash;"I heard a sound
like Haslar's cough. I stopped to listen. I wasn't sure whether
it came from behind me&mdash;from inside the flat, that
is&mdash;or from outside the flat&mdash;from the stairs. I looked
out of the door, up and down the landing and stairs. I couldn't
see any one. I went to the lift-shaft to press the button for the
lift, and as I did so, I thought I caught sight of Haslar's
ulster below me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Going down or coming up?" Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"I couldn't say. I thought I saw it on a landing. I ran on
down, but I saw nothing of Haslar. So I returned to Thornbush and
bed. Next morning I heard that Mr. Clifford had left. I saw
nothing improbable in that. Next I heard of the Etcheverrey
murder in flat Fourteen. That did stagger me. But obviously there
could be no connection between Mr. Clifford and a murder. It
wasn't as if <i>he</i> had been announced as murdered. I should
have come forward at once then, of course. Next, I learn that
Etcheverrey's body was claimed by you and Sir Edward to be that
of Mr. Clifford, but that Mrs. Clifford and Hobbs denied that it
was he, and were certain that he was safe and sound. Obviously I
had to think things over. I decided that my tale would add
nothing to the facts. I found Mr. Clifford alive, and I left him
alive. I confess that the thought of being mixed up in a
crime&mdash; It was a terrible position...I would have had to
bring in my friend Arnold Haslar. Altogether I decided to wait a
little while longer and see."</p>

<p>There was a little silence.</p>

<p>"And one thing more," Straight went on, "I stood outside the
door listening, as I said, to see if I had really heard Haslar,
and how I could not have seen any one if they had been standing
<i>outside</i> the fiat, or on the landing&mdash;" Straight shook
his head.</p>

<p>"You think whoever saw you was inside the fiat, not outside?"
Pointer asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think," Straight replied, "it's too
terrible a case to decide on quickly."</p>

<p>There was another silence. Diana sat with her head resting on
her hand, her face shaded, her lips tightly pressed together.</p>

<p>"And you, Miss Haslar, you knew of this meeting on Monday
night between your brother and Mr. Clifford?"</p>

<p>She looked at Pointer, tightening her lips still more.</p>

<p>"I'd like a word alone with you if you would let me have it,"
Pointer said.</p>

<p>Straight rose reluctantly at her glance. He stepped up to
Pointer before opening the door.</p>

<p>"Be gentle with her," he murmured under his breath, "she's
going through a frightful ordeal."</p>

<p>When the door closed behind him Pointer began again.</p>

<p>"Suppose you chance it, Miss Haslar, and trust me to see the
truth through all the maze of misleading events and side issues.
I don't see how you can do any harm by speaking out. Nothing can
make matters worse for Mr. Haslar, and knowing that, suppose you
take heart."</p>

<p>"Then you don't believe in Mr. Newman's confession?" she asked
eagerly and yet with dread in her voice.</p>

<p>"Until all the facts are cleared up, it's not possible to be
certain who was an accomplice and who not," Pointer said
truthfully. "We know your brother took the flat. But it's
possible that he may have taken it simply as the first step in a
rather elaborate plan to get back those letters blackening your
grandfather's character which Mr. Clifford intended to include in
his coming biography of Sir William Haslar. We have the letters
themselves."</p>

<p>Diana looked sceptical. But her look changed as Pointer drew a
note-case from his pocket and took out of an envelope
photographic copies of the two fateful notes. She was startled.
Yet, oddly enough, it gave her courage. Here was a man who wanted
but the truth. A man who had the knack of getting it, moreover.
Diana searched his face again. It was the face of a man of high
personal character. There were brains in it. But it could be an
absolutely unyielding face. She sat through another agonised
moment of silence. There was danger whatever she did or said.</p>

<p>"I think he may have taken it in order to lay a trap for Mr.
Julian Clifford," Pointer said again, "a trap to get possession
of those letters. Am I right? I've thought so all along. But it
wasn't easy to get the proof, to find out what he wanted."</p>

<p>Diana surrendered the position.</p>

<p>"I think so too," she said slowly. "I know nothing definite.
But I think he meant to&mdash;well, keep Mr. Clifford there for a
few days."</p>

<p>"Against his will?"</p>

<p>Diana nodded.</p>

<p>"That, at least, was what I feared when I heard on Tuesday
morning that Mr. Clifford had left Thornbush so suddenly before
breakfast. And when a man from the Home Office called during the
morning, and spoke of Uncle Julian's absence as such a riddle.
Seemed so amazed at it! But Mrs. Clifford and her cousin appeared
so certain that they knew where Uncle Julian was, that I thought
how silly I had been...But you see Arnold had just been taken ill
that morning, at the breakfast table, and the doctor had spoken
of some excitement or shock." She bit her lip.</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell me everything you know about your brother's
taking that flat," Pointer suggested. "How did he learn of
it?"</p>

<p>Diana hesitated. Pale, she grew whiter still. So it probably
was, as Pointer thought, through Newman.</p>

<p>"I really <i>know</i> nothing. Not even that he had a plan,"
she said finally. "It was only that when Uncle Julian refused to
promise not to use the letters, when Arnold could not budge him
from his intention of adding them to the Life which was already
being proof-read, I felt sure that Arnold would try something. He
got the position he holds because of his daring plans, and the
absolute fearlessness with which he goes ahead and carries them
out. You see, I know him so well that I can guess a good deal of
what's going on in his mind. Besides, one day when I said I'd
steal the letters if I could&mdash;and so I would
have"&mdash;Diana's eyes flashed&mdash;"they were cruel lies
about one of the best and kindest men that ever lived. And lies
about him when he was dead and could no longer defend
himself&mdash;Arnold told me not to worry. Just that."</p>

<p>"When did he say that?"</p>

<p>"Last Friday."</p>

<p>"You two were alone?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"You had no idea of what his plan was?"</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Edward&mdash;Sir Edward Clifford, I
mean&mdash;was chaffing a friend that night at a dance club where
Arnold and I were. He accused the boy of having kidnapped the
examiner and taken the exam papers from him. Arnold started, and
gave Sir Edward the look of some one who thought for half a
moment that his secret had beets guessed. I knew then what his
scheme was, or at least suspected something of it. There weren't
many things you <i>could</i> do to get those letters." She spoke
with an unconscious irritation which would have amused Pointer at
another time.</p>

<p>"You were on his side, of course? You thought anything fair
under the circumstances?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not towards Uncle Julian, no. I wasn't on Arnold's side at
all. Uncle Julian hated publishing those letters. But he thought
it the right thing to do. When people have to do dreadful things
because they think them right, what is there one can do?" Diana's
tone was infinitely sad and hopeless. "However dreadful, what can
one do? Besides"&mdash;her voice changed&mdash;"besides, I was
afraid that Arnold would overreach himself. You could no more
bully or frighten Uncle Julian than you could Arnold
himself."</p>

<p>"Did you attempt to dissuade him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Coming home from the Havana. But he only got
impatient, and told me I was all wrong. That there was no
question of personal violence in his mind, nor of bullying. He
told me to be quite sure of that; said he wasn't an absolute
idiot."</p>

<p>"You think he meant what he said?"</p>

<p>"Arnold always means what he says."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear the flat referred to?"</p>

<p>She did not reply.</p>

<p>"I wish I could spare you these questions," Pointer said
regretfully, "but truth is your best course, believe me. The very
best course&mdash;for every one."</p>

<p>She flashed him an eager look. There was a sparkle of almost
painful hope in it.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you mean?"</p>

<p>Something in Pointer's eyes encouraged her.</p>

<p>"I think I must have heard Arnold refer to it over the
telephone last Saturday evening. I heard him say, 'He can't come
till Tuesday, but the flat's taken for a month, so that's all
right.'"</p>

<p>"Do you know to whom he was talking?"</p>

<p>Diana hesitated.</p>

<p>"Was it to Mr. Newman?"</p>

<p>Her silence was answer in itself.</p>

<p>"Mr. Straight is a great friend of yours and your brother's, I
believe?"</p>

<p>"Very great."</p>

<p>"Did he know about the letters&mdash;I mean about their
existence?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," she said earnestly. "Mr. Straight is the
last man to permit himself to be drawn into a family
squabble."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Newman?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Newman was with Uncle Julian when they were found. He and
Adrian Hobbs both knew of them."</p>

<p>"And Sir Edward Clifford?"</p>

<p>"I begged Uncle Julian not to tell him. Sir Edward has always
been most unjustly critical of my grandfather's policy about the
Australian navy."</p>

<p>"And now&mdash;how did you come to go to Bruges, Miss Haslar?
You found Mr. Hobbs at that desk in your brother's study, didn't
you&mdash;at the secret drawer?"</p>

<p>"He had the letters you've shown me, in his hand. And Uncle
Julian's umbrella too. He told me that he had only just found
them in that old concealed double back, after hunting for them
all day. But I hardly cared about the letters, for he told me
something else. I thought it too good to be true, and yet, I
believed it!"</p>

<p>"That Mr. Julian Clifford was alive after all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that you had made a mistake about identifying the body
found in Heath Mansions as his; that Alison was right, that Uncle
Julian was safe and sound only in a most awkward position. I
would rather not tell you about that," Diana said, pausing.</p>

<p>Pointer assured her that the police knew it already.</p>

<p>"And you? Did you <i>know</i> that the nun was Mrs. Orr?"
Diana asked. "Or did you just suspect it?"</p>

<p>"I suspected it so strongly that I knew it," Pointer said, a
trifle grimly, "chiefly from her manicured nails. They positively
glittered. And a little from the marks of having worn rings very
recently on her fingers, especially the dent of a wedding
ring."</p>

<p>"And was it really her intention to&mdash;or was that about
the window and the canal only to frighten her?"</p>

<p>Pointer did not answer. He thought that the less said about
that the better. He had practically had to promise as much to
Mrs. Orr before she would speak. He had only his suspicions on
which to go.</p>

<p>"And did Adrian Hobbs intentionally shut me in that strong
room?"</p>

<p>Pointer did not answer that either.</p>

<p>"And about Sanz," she said, after a pause, in a low voice;
"what is going to be done with him?"</p>

<p>A door had just opened in the east library. Pointer had heard
it and recognised the step. Not so Diana.</p>

<p>"You would never have known that he was Etcheverrey, but for
me!" Suddenly she sprang up. Diana's spirit was ever for action,
weary though her body might be. "Chief Inspector, I feel as
though somehow you were my one hope. Sanz Etcheverrey
<i>couldn't</i> have killed Uncle Julian. I know he traded on my
love for him to take those Melbourne plans, but that was
different&mdash;that was political. He was against us all during
the war, and I thought I hated him. I told myself I did. I lost
my only other brother though he was a chaplain, in the war. But
this is quite different. In spite of all, I <i>know</i> he didn't
kill Uncle Julian."</p>

<p>Pointer looked at her. She read his look.</p>

<p>"You mean that I think that because I love him?" She seemed to
think over that possibility. "I do. And in that awful strong room
last night I learnt that nothing in the world is more worth while
than being able to love. It's a miracle. To be loved is
nothing&mdash; that's easy; that's chance. But to be able to
love! And I had been trying to crush it out of me all these
years. I thought hatred finer. For years I've been trying to
think that Sanz was playing some deep game of his own here at
Thornbush. But he didn't play a game when he came back, in spite
of his confession, to get me out last night. He offered up his
life for mine. Has he&mdash;has he given up his life for
mine?"</p>

<p>Diana asked the dreadful question with indescribable
anguish.</p>

<p>"That coming back to rescue you stands to his credit whatever
the issue." Pointer would not say more.</p>

<p>"And that confession?" Diana was in an awful position. Her
brother stood on the one side, her lover on the other.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing to doubt everybody and everything in a case
of this kind," Pointer said vaguely but kindly.</p>

<p>Diana looked at him imploringly. A very strange look to see on
Diana's face. But nothing of the thoughts behind them were
mirrored in the Chief Inspector's inscrutable gray eyes. He was
as usual aloof, remote, and tranquil.</p>

<p>"But if he didn't kill Uncle Julian, then he must have written
that letter to save some one. To save Arnold. Not that Arnold
needs saving," Diana added hastily, "but I've wondered whether
Sanz didn't think he did, and so jump in to the rescue. I was mad
to think Sanz could have tried to shoot Arnold. I wanted to think
anything bad of him, so as to&mdash;" She seemed to recollect
herself. "Forgive me ranting like an Adelphi heroine. I'm not
taken that way often. But what's his fate to be? Mind you," she
came a step nearer, "nothing will alter my feelings towards Sanz.
Imprison him for life, hang him&mdash;I shall always love him,
always wait for him! For no matter what his ideas of duty force
him to do, however horrible his political opinions, he
himself&mdash;Sanz Etcheverrey the man, not the
anarchist&mdash;is a hero!"</p>

<p>The communicating door between the two libraries opened
sharply with a jerk. Algernon Newman, as he still signed himself,
came in very gravely. He hardly glanced at Diana.</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector, I've come to clear up a few things&mdash;no,
not directly concerned with what interests you, but only personal
matters. No, please stay, Miss Haslar!"</p>

<p>"Miss Haslar? It wasn't 'Miss Haslar' whom you got out of the
safe last night, Sanz," Diana threw back at him. There is no
confidence in the world greater, no power surer than that of a
woman who is talking to the man whom she knows loves her. And
Diana had looked deep into the eyes of her rescuer last night.
She knew his heart.</p>

<p>"It wasn't Sanz Etcheverrey who opened the safe," Newman said
heavily. "Sanz Etcheverrey is a more or less romantic figure, at
least in a woman's eyes. There's nothing romantic about me." He
paused. Diana said nothing, but she was obviously with him in any
change of name or personality which he might be going to
make.</p>

<p>Newman looked ill and very tired. Evidently some fierce
fighting had gone on within him. "I'm only a crook's son.
Worse&mdash; a murderer's son."</p>

<p>Diana half rose. He stopped her with a weary lift of his
eyes.</p>

<p>"You mustn't sacrifice your life to a sham romantic personage.
You are romantic, you know. There's no romance about being the
son of Henry Cadby, embezzler, forger, thief, and finally
murderer. That was where I learnt how to open safes&mdash;at
home." He turned to Pointer. "Oh, I know Cockerell recognised my
father's invention of packing with powdered aluminum and iron
oxides and then using electricity in a totally new way. But it
wasn't because of Cockerell I'm telling the truth now. I could
have pretended that I'd caught Cadby once, and so on...But
<i>you</i> mustn't go on thinking me anything but what I am: mud;
the scourings of the street." He was talking only to Diana now.
He came up to her chair. "Thank you for saying what you did just
now. It was what Padre Haslar's sister would say. It helped me to
do&mdash;what's lot harder than coming back last night." He
finished with a half smile, an unconscious flicker of his lips
that lent the foreign leanness of his face a touch of ironic
vividness. In it was experience, suffering, and bitter wisdom.
"Then you were in danger," he went on softly. He stopped as
though struck by the phrase. "Perhaps, after all, the danger was
as great just now. Anyway, you know the truth&mdash;the reason
why I would never let you become engaged to me. You engaged to
<i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>"How can I know the truth when I don't understand it?" Diana
spoke with unexpected coolness. "Why did you tell me you were
Sanz Etcheverrey long ago at Hendaye? And those men at Pamplona,
they called you by that name."</p>

<p>Newman sat down.</p>

<p>"I'll begin at the beginning. I learnt to speak Spanish as a
baby, for I was born at Barcelona, where my father was a rather
well-to-do mining engineer. Cadby and Penfold was the firm. My
mother died when I was born. My father had spent several years in
the tin mines of Cornwall. That's where he and Penfold decided to
start together in the Catalan capital. When the firm got into
difficulties after Penfold's death, my father came to England. I
believe there was a fire, and he started with the insurance money
as manager in a biggish firm. Anyway he began to speculate, lost,
and borrowed the firm's money; to conceal these he forged
entries, stole more money, and so on&mdash;the usual thing. He
was convicted and sent to prison. Meanwhile he had married a
woman in the set into which he had by this time sunk. Crooks, all
of them. My father came out of prison&mdash;I was twelve by that
time&mdash;and went from bad to worse. He now made his living as
a safe breaker, a cracksman. He invented a wonderful way of
opening safes; had he been honest he might have risen high, I
sometimes think. He made a great deal of money, stole it, in
other words. Lived in great style. Called himself Baron de
Ribiera from Argentina. Then came the war. I was just short of
eighteen, but I joined up, thankful to get free. I had tried
several times to earn my own living, but something always gave me
away. My father would find out where I was, or some friends of
his recognised me, or the police warned my employers whose son I
was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> weren't a thief!" Diana said with
confidence.</p>

<p>"Not I! I'd have starved first. I hated the life, the whole
horrible family life&mdash;I enlisted under the name of Pollock,
my mother's name. Then came the news that my father had murdered
one of his accomplices who was about to give him away. He was
caught red-handed, and hanged. You remember the case, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>Pointer had been looking it up. Cockerell had finally
remembered where he had seen a safe that had been opened on lines
similar to those followed for that strong room door last
night.</p>

<p>"Man called Strachey?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>"Just so. Well, I slogged away at soldiering. They put me into
the quartermaster's office because I was quick at figures. No
chance to do more than jog along...And then in 1917 I got hold of
some information through a friend in the Foreign Legion, a chap
who came from Malaga, about Sanz Etcheverrey, a Basque who at
that time was rather on the German side. He was against all the
countries of the war, but now he would help one, now the other,
for his own reasons, his own price. This information was that a
certain official high in the Spanish Government had promised
Etcheverrey an amnesty for some followers of his who were dying
in Spanish prisons, if he would get hold of details about the
Anzac troops and troopships. The official's wife was a von Buck,
by the way. They had heard of Riply's escape from the torpedoed
ship, and they knew of those plans. Etcheverrey had agreed. The
chap from Malaga didn't tell me all this, of course. I had to
piece things together. I worked out a plan for catching
Etcheverrey and laid it before the quartermaster-general. It was
turned down. I was told to stick to figures. I deserted. When I
went off in 1914 my father&mdash;he was always a generous man
with money, and always kind to me, put a thousand pounds to my
credit in Cox's bank as a parting gift. I told him I was leaving
home for good. I hadn't touched the money, and didn't mean to.
But I drew on it now, brushed up my Spanish, came down to
Hendaye, and started in great style.</p>

<p>"I let it be known that I belonged to the Spanish Secret
Service. I got into touch with two of Etcheverrey's men and more
or less induced them to think that I was Etcheverrey himself.
He's double my age, but looked only half his years. I looked a
lot older than I was. Besides, they'd never seen him. He kept
himself absolutely in the background. I didn't claim to be him,
of course. I merely didn't deny it. Little by little I guessed
that the Melbourne Harbour plans were the objective of these two.
But it was only that night, the night that Riply died, that I was
certain. I had just half an hour to forestall them. I couldn't
trust two women to guard those papers from these Catalans. They'd
have cut you both into strips to make you give them up." Newman
threw this to Diana over his shoulder. He was talking to Pointer,
but he included Diana from now on.</p>

<p>"I had to get you out of the way before they could come. Once
let them see you in that room, and they'd suspect that you had
the papers. I stunned you and got you into your room. The two
Catalans came along before I got clear. I called out that I was
off for Pamplona, Etcheverrey's supposed headquarters. I knew
Etcheverrey was expected there. Well, the two hung on to me. But
they had an accident with their car at a turning when we were
almost in Pamplona. I had to go on. As it chanced Etcheverrey was
working in Nice, and the rumour that he was coming was spurious.
I passed myself off as him with the crew I found there, supplying
U-boats with petrol, they were part of a sort of pipe line that
ran to the coast. Then you blew in." He looked ruefully at
Diana.</p>

<p>"However, we got clear. Only unfortunately they hit a petrol
tin on our car over which my coat sleeve hung down. Tin and coat
went up in a blaze together. You got the fire under, but the
Melbourne Harbour plans were smoke. They were in a pocket of that
coat. That meant that I had nothing to show for my absence but a
very thin tale of adventure; but I gave myself up and decided to
tell it, leaving out the purely personal part, of course. There
was a court-martial, but&mdash;well, the news was just out of my
father's execution. They were very decent. They decided to
believe me. I asked for a front line job, and this time I got it.
I chose a Surrey regiment, because your brother was chaplain to
their division, so you had told me at Hendaye." He was speaking
only to Diana now. This might be his last talk to the girl,
except for the tragic leave-taking that the Chief Inspector had
promised her.</p>

<p>"That's what you meant by Padre Haslar?" Diana had hardly
noticed the reference before. He nodded.</p>

<p>"It was next best to being with you. Life was a bit grim those
days. Your brother was a man in a million. He"&mdash;Newman made
a gesture of inability&mdash;"but what's the good, you can't
describe a man like him!"</p>

<p>"He was a dear!" Diana said, with a catch in her voice "he
loved the whole world."</p>

<p>"He loved God," Newman said seriously. "It takes a very good
man to be able to love God. But he did. You knew he was killed
trying to get a couple of wounded soldiers out of a shell-hole
that was filling with water? Hit just after he got them through
our barbed wire."</p>

<p>Diana nodded. She guessed what was coming.</p>

<p>"I was one of the two. We had been three days in that shell-hole."</p>

<p>There was a long pause.</p>

<p>"When I woke up in hospital&mdash;I had collapsed at the
wire&mdash;I found that no one knew who I was. My identity disc
had been cut off when they dressed my arm at a clearing station.
So had my few remaining rags. We had all to be evacuated quickly
and my things were left behind. I was too weak to be questioned.
And I didn't care to talk. I had heard the Padre had been shot
helping poor Wingate to make a last effort. Wingate was much
worse wounded than I was. I didn't want to live. But in the ward
was a chap who had lost his memory. It struck me that he was a
lucky devil. And then I pretended to've lost mine. Only to be
left in peace, at first. But I began to think what a wonderful
thing it would be if I really had lost it&mdash;for ever. The
memory of that circle of crooks, of the underworld, of all I
loathed, of my father whom I secretly loathed too. Though, as I
say, he was always kind to me&mdash;kind and forbearing. To be rid of
it all! To drop it of like a dirty shirt. It seemed a heavenly
thought. I played it. It worked. No one suspected me. You see, I
had been studying the poor fellow in the ward who really had lost
his memory. <i>He</i> wanted it back. Lucky man! Then Mr.
Clifford came along, and spoke of Padre Haslar. Spoke of him as a
friend. I couldn't claim to've known him, but that made me accept
Mr. Clifford's offer to see what he could do for me. What I could
do for myself was how he put it. Well&mdash;the rest you know.
Any one of the name of Haslar could wipe their boots on me
for"&mdash;he pulled himself up&mdash;"for Peter Haslar's sake,"
he finished hastily. But he had intended to bracket another name
with the dead chaplain's.</p>

<p>"And now, Chief Inspector, what are you going to do about me?
Nothing of this alters my confession. Diana, Miss Haslar, is
going too far there. I give myself up for the murder of Julian
Clifford and the shooting of Arnold Haslar." Newman spoke in a
steady, firm tone. "I stand to that."</p>

<p>Pointer said nothing. He seemed lost in a profound conviction
that his bootmaker had sent him two rights or two lefts, and that
a closer scrutiny of his shoes would reveal the mistake.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me?" Newman asked again.</p>

<p>"Have a word in private, I think, first of all," Pointer
suggested.</p>

<p>Diana got up. She looked as though she felt the need for
thought. This Newman was another man. Son of a crook, son of a
murderer, and yet...Diana felt that life could be extraordinary
difficult. Suddenly she wheeled.</p>

<p>"Then if you're not Etcheverrey, why did you kill Uncle
Julian? If it's not political, if you're not&mdash;" She did not
finish either sentence.</p>

<p>Newman's face hardened. His jaw line showed more clearly. He
said nothing, only stared with expressionless eyes out of the
window as she left the two men together.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14">CHAPTER 14</a></h2>

<p class="first">"WHAT about Mr. Pollock's flat?" Pointer asked.
"Where did Mr. Newman get the money for such furnishing?"</p>

<p>Newman looked fixedly at him.</p>

<p>"Quick work! Yet I haven't gone near the place since all this.
I thought you were more than usually clever when I first saw you.
Or have I been under surveillance all these years?"</p>

<p>"No, the address was only discovered in the course of some
routine work on this case. But about the things there?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" Newman's smile was bitterness itself. "Family traits
proving too strong for me might explain them, mightn't
it&mdash;to a Chief Inspector? Just as what I might call Home
Hints made it easy for me to get away from your men, and to
disguise myself afterwards. If you're a criminal it's handy to
know the ropes from childhood."</p>

<p>Pointer's eyes were apparently on his shoes.</p>

<p>"I see. Yet with that explanation of your furniture, how was
it you worked on with Mr. Clifford as his secretary so long?"</p>

<p>"Thornbush was home to me, Chief Inspector. At least, let us
put it that the motive for murder kept me there."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clifford?" Pointer asked bluntly.</p>

<p>Newman leapt from his chair.</p>

<p>"Who dares say that?"</p>

<p>"It's what people always wonder when a man kills a married man
for no apparent reason. And in your case, it was suspected for
some time before."</p>

<p>The iron self-control broke in Newman's face.</p>

<p>"It's a lie! A foul, infamous lie! Mrs. Clifford? She's a
saint! Perhaps that's why, to my shame be it said, Chief
Inspector; and though she has been kindness itself to me, she
bores me even more than she does Hobbs. And that's saying
something! Mrs. Clifford wasn't the reason why I&mdash;killed
Julian Clifford."</p>

<p>"Then what was the reason?"</p>

<p>Newman lifted his dark eyes for a second to the window.
"Neither to you, nor to any one else, will I give the reason,
Chief Inspector." He spoke with absolute finality.</p>

<p>"The prosecution will be based on a clandestine love affair
between you and the lady. There's no other motive possible."
Newman looked darkly at him.</p>

<p>"The reason I killed Julian Clifford was because he had
stumbled on the truth about me," he said slowly; "and on
something disgraceful in my past as well. Something which he
intended to tell." The sentences, came out slowly, as steel is
drawn out inch by inch. Newman's face was impassive as ever. The
words rose before Pointer, "I know the danger"&mdash;"discovered
your secret." Words in the murdered man's handwriting found burnt
in this man's room.</p>

<p>Pointer said nothing for a while.</p>

<p>"And about Mr. Clifford's general knowledge of Etcheverrey?
And his special knowledge of his signature and the name of his
home?"</p>

<p>"I learnt all I could while planning to get hold of him at
Hendaye. 'The plan that failed!'"</p>

<p>"Because of Miss Haslar?"</p>

<p>"Well, obviously it tore it when she and I fled together."</p>

<p>Newman's swift, sardonic smile came and went, leaving his face
as grave as ever.</p>

<p>"And you told Mr. Clifford what you knew?"</p>

<p>Newman looked at him thoughtfully. "Little by little. When he
began to be so interested in the fellow, I let him think I had a
Spanish anti-revolutionary friend with whom I talked over week-ends. Mr. Clifford liked to get hold of something that Sir Edward
didn't know. I think he wanted his book to surprise him."</p>

<p>"Was this information confidential?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. But I'd rather not discuss Mr. Clifford.
Not with you, Chief Inspector. Not with anybody, but least of all
with you. Your questions aren't always what they seem on the
surface." Newman's voice was dry. "I had hoped, of course, to get
clear away and stay clear away, after my confession."</p>

<p>"I see. And now, Mr. Newman, Mr. Clifford made some notes on
that novel of his that is coming out in the <i>Arcturus</i>.
They're not among his papers. Do you know where they are?"</p>

<p>Unlike Hobbs, Newman did.</p>

<p>"The only notes I know of were some he left by an oversight
about two weeks ago at his publisher's house. But as he
afterwards decided to shift Etcheverrey's headquarters to the
Spanish side of the Pyrenees, he decided that they would be of no
use to him."</p>

<p>"And about the novel itself? You know, I suppose, what he
planned to do? You have an idea of how the story would have
run?"</p>

<p>"I have an idea of the main outlines. But&mdash;" Newman
checked himself. "I refuse to discuss Mr. Clifford, as I have
already said once before."</p>

<p>"Pity. Well, should you decide to make a clean breast of
everything, though I shall not be available, the Assistant
Commissioner will always be there. I may have to go away on an
investigation at once. As long as you confine your strolls to
this neighbourhood, not farther than Haslar's house say, you can
come and go as you like&mdash;for the present. Of course you'll
be followed, and by a good man. I needn't say what any attempt to
shake him off would entail."</p>

<p>Newman gave a short and very bitter laugh.</p>

<p>"There are a few more questions I must have answered if Mr.
Haslar is really to be cleared." Pointer went on. "First, who was
in the room when you spoke to Mr. Clifford of the diagram
signature of Etcheverrey's and of the name of the Basque's
home?"</p>

<p>Newman seemed to think. "No one but Hobbs. But he wasn't
paying any attention. He was hunting out some mistake in
royalties that he'd just found out."</p>

<p>"And when was this?"</p>

<p>Newman could not say for certain. Some time the latter half of
last week.</p>

<p>"And now about Mr. Haslar himself. We know, of course, all
about his connection with the flat. But was it you who first
mentioned the flat to him?" Newman thought a moment. Pointer felt
sure that he was going to give an evasive reply, or refuse to
answer.</p>

<p>"I hope we can clear Miss Haslar," he said sadly.
"Unfortunately, she seems mixed up in that business of the
flat."</p>

<p>"Miss Haslar?"</p>

<p>"She was heard talking of it to her brother before he took it.
We are sure that he had some helper there. I'm afraid that that
helper could only have been his sister. He wanted her to get the
letters away from Mr. Clifford, we think, or rather we are fairly
certain."</p>

<p>"I told Haslar of that," Newman said briskly.</p>

<p>"Is Marshall a friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"No, a mere acquaintance. But he happened to mention to me
when I met him by chance in the tube last week, that he wished to
let his flat furnished. So, as I say, when there was a question
of a furnished flat being wanted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By Miss Haslar, I suppose."</p>

<p>"By Haslar himself," Newman corrected shortly. "Miss Haslar
knows nothing of the flat. Or, if she knows of it, it's only been
after the event."</p>

<p>"But she was to help her brother about the letters. It's no
use, Mr. Newman, attempting to shield her, we know that Mr.
Haslar had a helper. Had a plan to get those letters of his
grandfather's away from Mr. Clifford. No one but Miss Haslar
could have helped him."</p>

<p>"I take back about having thought you more than usually
brilliant," Newman said curtly. "There are other people in the
world, Chief Inspector, than this little circle here and around
Thornbush. There is, or was, for instance, a man called Captain
Cory. You asked me about him yourself once. He's a man who has a
grudge against Clifford. He's also a man who had showed himself
uncommonly skilful at getting hold of papers, Haslar had been
present at his trial. When he concocted the plan of the flat, or
rather&mdash;" Newman waited a moment. Then he said: "I think
absolute frankness is best here. I don't want you to think that
there was any mix-up between the taking of that flat and Haslar's
arrangements about the letters and my part in the matter; that
is, the death of Mr. Clifford. Haslar took the flat for one
single purpose only&mdash;that of getting back the letters with
Captain Cory's assistance. I used the flat for my own purpose.
That clear?"</p>

<p>"Did you meet this Cory yourself?"</p>

<p>"No, Haslar telephoned me Friday evening that Cory wouldn't
get to the flat till Tuesday, but on Saturday morning Cory
himself came to Thornbush. He asked for me, but I was out. I
rather think he came to find out if Mr. Clifford carried the
letters on him, always. Or possibly he intended to double-cross
Haslar in some way. Get hold of the letters and sell them at a
stiff price. He only saw Hobbs, as it happened."</p>

<p>"Was Haslar going to be present in the flat when the letters
were taken?"</p>

<p>"We both were. We didn't trust Cory an inch further than we
could see him."</p>

<p>"The plan was not one that included violence?"</p>

<p>"Haslar's plan? Certainly not. We were to be there to prevent
anything of that sort. That at least is what Haslar thought."
Newman gave his unmirthful smile. "The taking of the papers was
to be entirely Cory's part. I believe the idea was that Haslar
would telephone to Mr. Clifford that he had met a man who could
prove that the Haslar letters were forgeries, if Mr. Clifford
would bring them to Fourteen Heath Mansions. Then Cory, made up a
little as Major Brown, would receive him, look at the letters,
and&mdash;the rest was left to him, as to how he intended to
trick Mr. Clifford into thinking he returned the same letters to
him."</p>

<p>"When was this plan arranged?"?</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know. Thursday and Friday, I think. I wasn't
present."</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know that the doctors are as hopeful this
morning about Haslar as they were pessimistic up till now?"
Pointer asked. "You know they think that he took a most
unexpected turn down the right road to-day?"</p>

<p>Newman said nothing.</p>

<p>"They're trying the latest craze, no nurses to-day," Pointer
went on half-absent-mindedly. "Once an hour a nurse slips into
his room and gives him a capsule. Strychnine. For the rest of the
hour he's left in absolute stillness and darkness. Funny thing
medicine. One capsule an hour makes for recovery, while three
would kill him before he could swallow them. He'll be able to
speak to-morrow. To tell us the real story. For, of course, Mr.
Newman, until he does that, it's hard to believe that he was not
more implicated in the murder than you represent him."</p>

<p>Newman's face had darkened at the good report of Haslar.</p>

<p>"And that rope on your sitting-room wall," Pointer went on; "I
recognised it as one of ours, of course. From inquiries I find
that the rope that hung Cadby is missing. They are always kept,
as you know, together with a death mask of each man. You tipped
some out-going sergeant of police a little too freely, I'm
afraid. But it belongs to us, Mr. Newman. You must let us have it
back."</p>

<p>"You can have it any time you like," Newman said through his
teeth. "It's served its turn. I put it there to remind me of who
I am. But as Miss Haslar knows the truth now, it can go. She'll
be wise and take the respectable side of the road. Oh, life is
damnation!" The sudden outburst was repressed as soon as it
flashed out.</p>

<p>Pointer looked at his shoes for some moments.</p>

<p>"That rope belongs to us," he repeated slowly. "I suggest that
you have a talk with a Superintendent of Police whom I've asked
to come here as soon as he can. He's a man who was sent over to
Barcelona in connection with the Strachey case."</p>

<p>Newman's face grew more sombre still.</p>

<p>"I don't want any last messages," he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>"You'll want this one. You'd have had it long ago but for your
change of name. Pollock was posted as missing, of course. The man
who murdered Strachey was not your father. Your father, so Cadby
swore in a duly witnessed statement which he made to the governor
the day before his execution, was Penfold. The statement was
investigated and found to be correct."</p>

<p>"Penfold? His partner?" Newman could hardly speak
articulately.</p>

<p>"His partner&mdash;a civil engineer&mdash;a man of the highest
character; of whose integrity there never was any question. You
are John Penfold, only child of Henry Penfold, a very honest
gentleman, and of Isabelle Treherne, daughter of a solicitor.
Both of them of Penzance, Cornwall. She had Armada blood in her,
which I think accounts for something in yourself which puzzled us
all a bit&mdash;though as a Devon man I know a Cornish man when I
see one. However, to go on&mdash;that fire in Barcelona was
Cadby's doing, to cover up some falsifications in the books as
well as to get the insurance money. Unfortunately your father, to
whom he was sincerely attached, had gone to the office. Cadby
thinks he must have suspected him, and gone to have a quiet look
at the books. He was burnt to death. With all his bad qualities
Cadby was never the same man again, or so he said in his
confession. You were an orphan, your mother had died when you
were born. Penfold's money was lost with the firm's smash. Lost
by Cadby. Cadby took you back with him to England, passing you
off as his son. He thought that if people knew that he was
bringing up the son of his late partner, some suspicion might
arise that he felt himself in some way responsible for your
father's death.</p>

<p>"Also, he had a sort of feeling that through you, to you, he
might atone. It wasn't a feeling that kept him straight, but it
prevented his ever willingly letting you want for anything, or
letting you go.</p>

<p>"You never thought of inquiring in the Barcelona records whose
son it was that was born there. We did, of course. Cadby had no
son. Penfold had one boy who is duly entered on the registers,
was duly baptized at the English Church there. Your sins are on
your own head. Whatever you have done, now that you know the
truth, you will not be able to plead that it was your father's
blood that was too much for you, family traits too strong for
you. Copies of the papers concerning your parentage will be
handed you by the Superintendent when he comes."</p>

<p>Newman stood staring at him. All the colour had drained from
his face. Before his mind's eye passed his miserable, desperate,
hate-filled boyhood in surroundings from which his honest fibre
revolted. He thought of his efforts to get out of them, of the
years at Thornbush, happy years had he been leading a true life.
And now! He shut his eyes for a second.</p>

<p>"But for your confession you could walk out of this house with
a lighter heart than I dare swear you've known before," Pointer
went on.</p>

<p>"You're a devil!" Newman said passionately. "What you've told
me alters nothing." There was something desperate in the tense
voice and in the eyes that stared out at the sunshine. "Alters
nothing! I <i>did</i> kill Julian Clifford and shoot Haslar. But
not a word of this news of yours about myself to Miss Haslar, nor
to any one."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly. It's entirely your own affair," Pointer
agreed.</p>

<p>Newman, very pale, stood biting his lip, swallowing hard.</p>

<p>"It was Mr. Clifford I understand who wished Hobbs to leave
him?" Pointer asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Newman stared for a second as though he could hardly hear the
other through the tumult in his head.</p>

<p>"The other way around," he said absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>"I asked, because, but for your confession, Mr.
Newman&mdash;since you wish me to continue calling you
that&mdash;we at the Yard would wonder whether he might not have
just found out that Hobbs had been systematically robbing him. We
could go on to wonder whether Hobbs had not murdered Mr. Clifford
to save himself from prosecution, and all that that would mean.
Mr. Hobbs, we might say, had learnt of Arnold Haslar's plan about
the flat on Saturday morning from Major Cory, who sold him the
information, and had gone to the flat Monday night&mdash;Cory had
been given a key which he might have handed over&mdash;and there
Hobbs murdered Mr. Clifford after luring him to Heath Mansions.
He would have a dozen pretexts. That is what the police might
think. They might look on Mr. Haslar's injury as an accident. In
fact, but for your confession, the whole case might assume a very
simple aspect."</p>

<p>The skin on Newman's face seemed to tighten as a wet drum
tightens, till it stretched taut across his high
cheekbones&mdash;the cheek-bones of a man of action. For the
first time Pointer saw his hands shake as he clenched them.</p>

<p>"You're the devil himself!" Newman said hoarsely, in a tone of
anguish, and turning, he stumbled from the room as though the
floor were pitching and tossing beneath his feet.</p>

<p>Sir Edward looked in. Straight was with him. Seeing Pointer
alone, they came on in.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are arresting Newman?" Sir Edward asked. "It's
very trying meeting him face to face&mdash;at
liberty&mdash;around this house. The house of his victim."</p>

<p>"Mr. Newman won't be here to-morrow, I fancy. But, Sir Edward,
I thought you were doubtful of his confession?"</p>

<p>"I'm doubtful of everything," Clifford said wearily. "This
news about Hobbs, frightful! A cousin of Mrs. Clifford's. A
member of my brother's family, so to say. He cannot be
prosecuted, of course. Mrs. Clifford would refuse to do so in any
case and my hands are tied. Why, he would only so gladly
broadcast my brother's unfortunate idea of purchasing the Bruges
Crystal. My sister-in-law believes that he will surely be
punished in some esoteric way. I'm afraid I should find jail more
satisfactory."</p>

<p>"It may come to that yet, Sir Edward, and more," Pointer said
slowly. Then he changed the subject, and told Clifford the good
news of Haslar's expected, or at least hoped-for recovery. Sir
Edward seemed delighted at the prospect of hearing from the
injured man exactly what had happened.</p>

<p>"He'll at least be able to name his assailant, it was broad
daylight when he was shot." Straight said that according to the
latest bulletin, Arnold Haslar was expected to be able to both
speak and answer a few questions by to-morrow morning. Until then
the doctors wanted him kept in silence and absolute stillness.
Straight was beginning to look himself again. Diana had known
best all along. He did not claim to be heartbroken at her
definite turning-down of any idea of marriage between them. After
all, there was something to be said for not being engaged to a
girl who had a love affair with a Basque bandit, and a brother
who, wearing flamboyant coats, took a flat in which people were
afterwards found murdered.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock another and a startling bulletin came from
the sick room. It stated that Arnold Haslar had recovered
consciousness and asked for Chief Inspector Pointer.
Unfortunately Pointer was not to be found at the Yard, nor in any
of the places suggested by his clerks. So the sick man had
contented himself with a few laboured words only, but these were
startling enough.</p>

<p>Haslar had been in the flat at the moment when the murder was
committed. He had actually seen Julian Clifford shot.</p>

<p>The bulletin finished with the news that he had just fallen
back again into a profound sleep which must on no account be
broken.</p>

<p>An hour went by. Then another. There was no sound or stir in
that darkened bedroom where on a narrow white bed it took keen
sight to make out a shape lying motionless. A head so bandaged
that it was scarcely distinguishable from the pillows into which
it sank. A chalk-white hand lay inert on the metal brocade of the
blanket. Light, and slow, and faint, came the breaths from
between lips but a few degrees less colourless than the bandages,
than the linen.</p>

<p>The nurse had come and gone, the patient had had his hourly
capsule, and had immediately seemed to slumber on&mdash;if
slumber it could be called.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when the door opened slowly&mdash;slowly
but not furtively. In came a man. He stood a second to get his
bearings in the dimness of the one light that shone like a large
pearl above the table on which stood the medicine. He stepped up
to the bed. Then he moved to the little table and looked at the
box of capsules&mdash;read the label, the directions, and stood a
second quite still. He switched off the light and crossed to the
window. Looked out. Rearranged the curtains and turned up the
light. Then he went to a huge walnut wardrobe&mdash;opened it and
felt inside. Once more he came back to the bed. Something in his
circling suggested a vulture about to settle. His hand went out
to the box. He opened it and counted out six of the little
objects inside. From an envelope in his pocket he shook out six
other capsules into the box, the same as the others in
appearance. Now he paused, listening intently. Then bending over
the bed, he pressed shut the nostrils which a bandage loosely
covered. The mouth under Haslar's toothbrush moustache opened.
Into it the man swiftly dropped the capsules taken from the box.
Instantly the breathing stopped half-way. A faint shudder ran
through the body. The hand drew down in a spasm beneath the
sheet. The whole body seemed to straighten itself. The head
slipped sideways off the pillows on the farther side. The man
waited a second. Then he laid his hand on the man's heart. There
is an elementary trick in Ju-Jitsu by which a hand so placed is
held by a grip above the elbow, while the body on which it rests
bends forward all but breaking the wrist. This happened now. The
man screamed like what he was&mdash;a trapped animal.</p>

<p>"Take it quietly," said the man whom he thought dead.
"Tindall, Doctor Evans, and an Inspector are in the next room
watching you.</p>

<p>"Richard Straight, I arrest you for the murder of Mr. Julian
Clifford last Monday night." The usual warning was given by Chief
Inspector Pointer&mdash;in bandages, lavish chalk make-up, and a
shirt which fastened up his back by tapes.</p>

<p>"Inspector Watts, you can take away the Japanese
cinematographic camera from the top of the wardrobe. It's a
camera that works in the dark, Mr. Straight."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" Straight had some difficulty in getting his lips to
shape the words. "Why, I had only met Mr. Clifford an hour or so
before&mdash;what earthly motive would I have had for killing
him?" He tried for a note of derision.</p>

<p>"Motive? His novel <i>The Soul of Ishamel</i> is coming out in
monthly parts in the <i>Arcturus</i> magazine. Either you had met
Mr. Clifford before, or he had come on your story by some chance,
without knowing your name. You might have met without either of
you recognising the other again for he often dressed in a
disguise when he was on his investigations, and he was very near-sighted. At any rate, in <i>The Soul of Ishmael</i>, the reason
why the chief character has to leave England, is the same as that
which made you leave England. Only you went to Australia, while
the man in the book was to go to the Pyrenees and join
Etcheverrey's band. And that reason was appropriation of money
which the town council thought was properly invested. With a
swindle to cover the tracks&mdash;a clever swindle. Your tracks
were carefully covered, I admit&mdash;so carefully that another
man went to prison for what you did. But the tracks are
there&mdash;down in Bedford. And the tale as told in Mr.
Clifford's novel is so exact, the steps so carefully given, that
any acquaintance on reading it, knowing you of old, knowing about
the money which you claimed had been left you as a legacy, could
not but link you with the story, had it gone on for but one more
chapter. And that linking up by an intelligent reader would have
meant prison for you, Mr. Straight&mdash;a long term&mdash;prison
and an end to all your ambitions. You were quite safe so long as
the little connecting link could not be brought home to you. Mr.
Clifford's novel showed how this could be done."</p>

<p>"Preposterous!" But Straight looked as though his spine were
crumbling inside him. "What about Newman's confession? What about
his being the anarchist of whom Clifford was writing? And how
should I have known anything about the flat at Heath Mansions?
Your tale's a tissue of absurdities."</p>

<p>"That flat? You were sitting in the south library downstairs
here after dinner at Thornbush, while Mr. Haslar was talking to
Captain Cory on Monday in his study. Every word they said must
have been heard by you through the communicating door. The whole
plot was gone over for the last time.</p>

<p>"How Mr. Clifford could be lured to the flat by the message
about the Haslar letters, of how Cory was to steal the letters,
and so on. You heard Cory say that he could do nothing until
Tuesday."</p>

<p>Pointer was guessing the unknown by the known facts. But the
trial of Richard Straight for Julian Clifford's murder proved
that he was right.</p>

<p>"But this is lunacy!" broke in the man under arrest. "I had
only parted from Mr. Clifford after my first dinner with him, and
on the best of terms, as the servants, as every one at Thornbush
can testify."</p>

<p>"Quite so. Therefore it was probably after that dinner that
you read the current number of the Arcturus. A number in which
the story breaks off just before the crucial point&mdash;for you.
A few more pages and it would be too late. An <i>Arcturus</i> was
lying on the table in the library where you sat while waiting for
Mr. Haslar's visitor to go. You read it, saw your danger, it's
imminence, and heard a plan being finally run through beside you
which you thought would save you. That was why you shot Mr.
Clifford in the flat to which you lured him by just such a
telephone message as you had heard suggested. You doubtless
imitated Haslar's voice, or claimed to be speaking for him. And
afterwards you took away from his writing-table drawer the
typescript pages which would have betrayed your story.</p>

<p>"It was you, not Mr. Haslar, who postponed the planned
gaieties of last Monday night. You probably alleged some work
for, or talk to, Mr. Clifford. Or your own fatigue after your
journey. That telephone call that you told us arrived after you
got to the house and which hurried Mr. Haslar into the country,
came from you yourself as soon as you left him. You sent another
to Mr. Newman. So that neither man could stray into the flat. And
also so that if things went wrong, neither man could have an
alibi. I think you used Cory's name for that purpose, and let
them think they were to meet him for some urgent reason. After
the murder, Mr. Haslar would of course think those bogus
appointments confirmed Cory's guilt. To Mr. Newman it would look
like Haslar's doing. The key to flat Fourteen you took from Mr.
Haslar's ulster hanging in the hall before you left the house.
You also took his automatic which you know from his habits in
Australia he kept beside his bed. You were friends enough to
chance being found upstairs. Then you went to the flat. You
thought it might be as well to leave some sort of a trail. Little
dreaming how Mr. Hobbs would help you by taking away everything
that would ordinarily identify Mr. Julian Clifford. You
remembered hearing at dinner about Etcheverrey and the hunt for
him. You passed the time until Mr. Clifford could get to you by
writing a couple of notes which you crumpled up in a way that you
always do crumple your thrown away paper, a tight, egg-shaped
ball. You could not know, that they would bring the trail looping
back to Thornbush, and Mr. Clifford. When Mr. Clifford came, you
let him in, doubtless saying that Haslar or the supposed owner of
the flat would be back in a moment. You left Mr. Clifford seated
by the lamp looking at some book placed there to catch his eye.
You went into the bedroom, pushed the door open, and shot him
with Mr. Haslar's pistol to which you had fitted a cardboard
silencer&mdash;an Australian dodge which you had evidently
learned out there. Hobbs saw you leaving the flat after the
murder. In your agitation you forgot to notice whether the
defective catch of the front door shut properly. Your account of
meeting Mr. Clifford, of leaving him alive, is of course pure
invention. Just as was your tale of Mr. Clifford's fears of
Newman, and his dread of his coming journey. You were careful not
to overdo it. You only <i>thought</i> you heard Mr. Haslar's
cough. But to run on, after you left the flat, you put Mr.
Haslar's revolver back in his room. And then went quietly to bed
under the roof of the man whom you had just murdered. To-day,
when you heard that Arnold Haslar had been present in the flat,
and claimed to have seen the murderer, you decided to silence
him."</p>

<p>Straight made no further remark except to swear that he was
innocent and that this was but the invention of Scotland
Yard.</p>

<p>He maintained this at his trial, but when his appeal against
the death sentence passed on him was disallowed, he wrote a
letter to the Chief Inspector, one of those long, detailed
letters that men of his temperament often do write at such a
time. In it he confessed that Pointer's theory of the motive; a
theory proved up to the hilt at the trial was right; that Mr.
Clifford in the course of talking to him after dinner on Monday
about his work had let fall that he was going to take the coming
instalment of <i>The Soul of Ishmael</i> to his publisher's next
morning. This was an item which had meant nothing to Straight at
the time but which had spelled disaster, full and complete, when
he had read while waiting in Haslar's library the last published
chapters of the novel. Straight knew then that he had only a few
hours in which to avert discovery&mdash;practically only Monday
night.</p>

<p>After many digressions, Straight went on to say, in this final
confession, that he had probably himself given Julian Clifford
one half of his own story long ago,&mdash;on a boat going to
Corfu,&mdash; when he, Straight, had met a man who claimed to be
a commercial traveller in dried fruits. It was after a dinner at
which Straight had taken too much to drink. The drink and a
gorgeous night unloosed his tongue, and half the tale of a clever
swindle on the council funds was told to the commercial traveller
as a good yarn.</p>

<p>Next morning a very sober Straight found that the commercial
had left the ship at dawn. Straight never touched stimulants
again. He hoped, and believed, that the part told by him would be
forgotten. In any case it was fairly harmless as long as the man
to whom it was told did not come upon the other half and put two
and two together to make a most unpleasant four&mdash;a four that
could mean prison. Unfortunately for himself this was what had
happened. Julian Clifford had come upon the other half of the
story which had been told him by a stranger in the dusk of that
Mediterranean night, an utiacen stranger who stood to him merely
for a base, but intriguing tale. And Julian Clifford, with the
flair of the true artist, had welded the two stories together in
his yarn as they had been welded in fact. He had even given the
swindler a character strangely like Richard Straight's.</p>

<p>As to Straight's knowledge of Etcheverrey's signature and
home&mdash;Julian Clifford, during the after-dinner talk, had
jotted down a few suggestions for some minor headings in the
subject index which was to be the new librarian's first task. On
the back, as Straight was putting it away in his pocket-book, he
called the writer's attention to a V in a tiny outline of a
house, and two incomprehensible words.</p>

<p>Clifford had peered at them, mentioned that he was very short-sighted, and explained them with a laugh as Etcheverrey's code
signature, and the name of his home in the Pyrenees, something
that even Sir Edward did not know.</p>

<p>Straight had the paper in his pocket, when the idea of using
Etcheverrey as a trail occurred to him in the flat. A trail that
as Pointer had said, he imagined would lead far afield.</p>

<p>"Any time you have another case like this on, let me know, and
you're welcome to sign my name again to whatever bulletins you
like," Doctor Evans assured Pointer before he hurried off to see
to Haslar. The sick man's bed had been secretly rolled into
another room. The only truth in the last bulletins, which Pointer
had written, was that Haslar was making a wonderful recovery.</p>

<p>On the stairs the Chief Inspector met Tindall hurrying up.
Telephone messages had been trying to reach him for hours.
Unfortunately the F.O. man had come upon a most promising short
cut to Etcheverrey and had taken his Chief with him on a
fruitless excursion into the suburbs.</p>

<p>"Straight instead of Etcheverrey!" Tindall could not read just
his ideas for a moment. "By the way, you telephoned us that you
had absolute certainty that Newman was after all not Etcheverrey.
You're sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the reasons are confidential."</p>

<p>"Humph&mdash;well&mdash;he had a most amazing knowledge of
Etcheverrey's secrets if it's true that he was Julian Clifford's
source of information on the Basque."</p>

<p>"Mr. Newman checkmated Etcheverrey once during the war." The
door opened. Sir Edward came in slowly. Heavily.</p>

<p>"I've just told Mrs. Clifford the news," he sank into a
chair.</p>

<p>"And how does she take it?" Tindall asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she thinks that my brother is giving her a message
from the other world to his slayer. A message of forgiveness. A
promise that expiation in this world will wipe the slate clean,
and that Julian will be there ready to greet him as a friend when
he 'passes over."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" was all Tindall could murmur.</p>

<p>"It must be a wonderful help to be able to believe that sort
of thing," Sir Edward said a little wearily, a little wistfully,
and a little impatiently. "I confess I found it for once hard to
sympathise."</p>

<p>There was a short silence. Then Tindall turned to Pointer.</p>

<p>"I've heard you say, Chief Inspector, that the game's never
lost until it's won. You've certainly won this one. And won it
well. Clues versus deduction, eh? Well, for once they have
scored."</p>

<p>"I never knew a case where deductions alone could have led one
much further afield," Pointer said thoughtfully. "Only clues,
pure and simple, could get one out of such a labyrinth."</p>

<p>"So Julian's notes, which to us, seemed to point full to
Etcheverrey, to you pointed to Straight? Odd!" It was Sir Edward
speaking.</p>

<p>Tindall made a grimace.</p>

<p>"His carbon sheet, rather? Eh, Pointer? The sheet I turned
down."</p>

<p>Pointer nodded.</p>

<p>"Still, that phrase in the notes about 'England dangerous'
struck me very much. Seeing that I had Straight in my mind as the
probable criminal. I wondered if Roberts's past, instead of his
future association with Etcheverrey, might not be the danger, the
cause of the murder. And the five pages on the carbon sheet gave
us just the clue we needed. On the very last page of the chapter
as it was meant to be.</p>

<p>"We have two men who are very good at that sort of an
investigation. By the help of it, they soon worked back to the
truth. Incidentally Newman, who I found knew about the notes left
nearly a fortnight ago with Mr. Bancroft, had made no effort to
get hold of them."</p>

<p>"You suspected Straight from the first!" Clifford asked, "On
what grounds?"</p>

<p>"I suspected everybody," Pointer said a little dryly. Tindall
smoothed away a grin under cover of stroking his beard. He knew
quite well whom Pointer had included in his suspicions.</p>

<p>"Of course Hobbs' telling you that you saw Straight come out
of the flat was a plain enough tip," he murmured, "but I imagined
you didn't believe the tale. Hobbs himself thought so.</p>

<p>"Hobbs had to think so. He was going to be under the same roof
as Straight, and had a tremendous grudge against him. Which was
why I had to question Straight about the incident, for if he had
learnt from Hobbs that I knew of it, he would have known by my
silence, that he was suspected."</p>

<p>Tindall nodded to each point in turn. "But what set you on
Straight's trail in the beginning?" he pressed. "You talk of
clues. Surely it was reasoning rather. Reasoning from the facts,
not to them. Pointer too preferred the latter way when possible,
but it had not been possible in the Clifford affair. In other
words reasoning from a clue I found."</p>

<p>"Which clue? Where?"</p>

<p>"The tape pinned across the door catch. If the murderer was
one of the narrow circle at Thornbush, in which circle I included
the Haslars, that pointed to some very hurried, very improvised,
plan.</p>

<p>"Whoever did that, knew that only a short time could elapse
between the arrival of the victim and his death. Else so clumsy a
precaution would have aroused suspicion. But evidently the man
who came was not, and was not expected to be, suspicious. Here
was where the oddity lay. For apparently, too, he did not know
the fiat well enough to roam about it. That tape looked to me
very unlike the work of whoever had taken the flat. Let alone the
work of Etcheverrey. For, they would have had ample time to
silence the lock invisibly. It certainly did not look like the
work of an engineer, let alone an electrical engineer of Arnold
Haslar's standing. It looked to me like some sudden arrival to
the Thornbush circle, and the choosing of Monday night, also made
the crime seem the work of a newcomer. For if the criminal knew
of the flat, he would probably know that Cory, who never runs two
enterprises simultaneously&mdash;he had some pigeon-plucking to
finish&mdash;might come in by Tuesday. But why should any one
wait until the last night when the flat would be free unless he
couldn't help himself? Unless that was his first opportunity? For
Mr. Clifford might have refused to come to Heath Mansions, or
some hitch might have occurred. On the other hand, if a new
arrival, it must be one who knew that Mr. Clifford was short-sighted, or he would never have chanced that tape.</p>

<p>"Also, supposing I was right, and those paper scraps in the
basket were the work of the murderer, he would have to be some
one who could have heard of Etcheverrey. Straight fitted all
these provisos. In short all this pointed so directly to him, as
the only newcomer to Thornbush, that I very carefully
investigated all other possibles for fear lest I had got an idea
into my head. Getting an idea into one's head is a detective's
nightmare."</p>

<p>Pointer did not add that he had also suspected&mdash;in the
absence of any other known motive&mdash;the new librarian of
having known and loved Mrs. Clifford in the past, and that,
therefore, he had been very doubtful of her too, for it was only
in the last few hours that his men had been able to prove his own
idea right, and working by the clues on the carbon sheet, get
hold of the real reason for the murder, and so free all the other
inmates of Thornbush, except Straight, from suspicion.</p>

<p>"Yet, otherwise, after the crime, Straight never gave himself
away?" Tindall thought. "Until just now. When he fell into your
trap."</p>

<p>"That trap was the only thing that could catch him. The only
thing that would prove who the murderer of Mr. Julian Clifford
had been. He had left no clue behind. It might be Newman, after
all, or Hobbs, or any one. I might be all wrong. But Straight
gave himself away once&mdash;badly. When he described to me how
Mr. Clifford was sitting beside the little table in the flat.
Unless his story was true, the mere fact of his knowledge of Mr.
Clifford's real position marked him as the probable murderer.
And, too, I think, I should have suspected him anyway after a
little scene which I witnessed between him and Miss Haslar. It
was a sort of lover's quarrel. At least that was the impression
at which Straight aimed. He acted like an impetuous, quick-tempered young fellow who was jealous, and intensely hurt by a
girl's preference for another. Now impetuous and quick-tempered
Richard Straight certainly is not. Even without any previous
suspicions, I should have asked myself why Straight should take
the trouble to act&mdash;before me."</p>

<p>"And why did he?" Sir Edward demanded.</p>

<p>"He wanted to get free. From the man who had worn that ulster
and taken that flat. Free because of him even from Miss Haslar in
spite of her large fortune. Then came the news that the truth was
out. That we knew that the dead man was Mr. Clifford. After that,
Straight wanted to be known to be in love with Mr. Clifford's
devoted niece and about to enter his family circle. But when he
found finally that she definitely turned him down, he was quite
willing that she should smother in that strong room. He told me
that he didn't know the code-word. Yet when Mrs. Clifford came,
he hastened to ask her if she knew of no other word but
<i>Visit</i>. No one had mentioned Visit. That was a bad
slip."</p>

<p>"He would have let her die? Good God! Why?"</p>

<p>"If she wouldn't marry him she was a possible
hindrance&mdash;a restraint. Straight knew that he might yet be
pushed into a tight corner. Hobbs suspected him. And with Miss
Haslar and Arnold Haslar both out of the way, he could be free to
say what he liked. Just as Mr. Clifford's death left him free to
give us that extraordinary improvisation about his after-dinner
talk with him. Straight had no intention of murdering either Miss
Haslar or her brother, of course. Murder is dangerous. Its
advantages must be great, therefore. But Straight would have
stood by and let things run their course this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Straight!" Tindall muttered again as one mutters a riddle's
unexpected solution. "That little rat! I always wondered what
Miss Haslar could see in Straight, even for a short time."</p>

<p>"I think she never saw anything in him but a steady, reliable
character, a good guide through life! I think she did her best to
like him, and never succeeded because of an inward voice that
refused to be told how sterling a character was his."</p>

<p>"Straight must have been slightly bewildered when he heard of
Clifford's head being missing." Tindall said under his breath to
Pointer.</p>

<p>"When he was told that Newman was Etcheverrey, I fancy he
thought that he had only forestalled another criminal by a few
minutes."</p>

<p>"You never suspected Haslar at any time?" Edward Clifford
asked coming out of a reverie.</p>

<p>"If murder were Mr. Haslar's object, I couldn't see why he
took a flat. Took it in a way that he might fancy would throw any
ordinary inquiries off the track, but which he would know as well
as any other man would not put a detective off. That coat! Also
like you, Mr. Tindall, I couldn't see why the murderer should set
himself the horrible task of cutting off a head, when there were
so many easier ways of concealing the body's identity. That
looked to me only the desperate resort of some one who found the
man dead, and to whom it was of the most vital importance that
the death should not be suspected, at least for a time. Once
granted that Julian Clifford was the murdered man, then, if not
an outsider, Mr. Hobbs was clearly marked as the probable
disguiser of the identity, provided there were heavy defalcations
in his books&mdash;so heavy that the death of Mr. Clifford and
the subsequent looking into his affairs would spell ruin for
him&mdash;a ruin far beyond any legacy of five thousand pounds to
put right. The cheque was confusing, of course. So was the effect
of Mr. Clifford's supposed endeavour to purchase the Charlemagne
Crystal. Then there was always the question of collusion&mdash;of
helpers. Altogether, it's been a most puzzling case."</p>

<p>"Yet Newman never puzzled you?" Tindall wondered.</p>

<p>"As a personality he did indeed. And also as to what, or how
much, he knew. But apart from suspecting Straight at once, I soon
saw that Mr. Newman knew too much to have left that Etcheverrey
trail behind him on the scene of the murder. For he alone of the
Thornbush circle was aware that Mr. Clifford intended using the
anarchist in his work, and had talked the idea over with Mr.
Bancroft. To Straight that news came as a fine shock. He thought
he had been so clever!"</p>

<p>"When did he hear of it?"</p>

<p>"When Miss Haslar told me that she believed Mr. Newman to be
really Etcheverrey. A belief that seemed to me to rest on a very
shaky foundation."</p>

<p>"Chief Inspector!" It was Diana who burst in on them. "Who
shot Arnold? It wasn't Mr. Straight, for he was in the library at
Thornbush with me at the time! Horrible, horrible thought!" Her
face blanched.</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't Straight. He of course insisted that the same
man who killed Mr. Clifford had tried to kill your brother,
because he had an absolute alibi during the time when Mr. Haslar
was shot."</p>

<p>"But who did try to kill him?" she demanded frantically.</p>

<p>"Suppose you had done what your brother had done," Pointer
began gently; "taken a flat for one purpose. Made your
arrangements for that purpose. Suppose some one else used those
arrangements for quite another purpose. For murder. And you
learnt the awful truth. Not the report in the papers. Saw
yourself implicated very deeply. Believed that you could not
clear yourself. Knew that you had opened the door to life-long
blackmail. Suppose you were suffering from an illness which
peculiarly affects people's nerve. Couldn't you imagine yourself
going up to your room, getting your revolver, and telling
yourself that you must use it, and use it at once. 'Do it' were
the words Mr. Haslar used. 'Do it, and do it at once!'"</p>

<p>"Arnold does talk to himself when he's very much stirred."
Diana was half dazed. "You mean that Arnold shot himself?" There
was horror, and there was boundless relief, in her voice.</p>

<p>"Just so. With the second bullet in his revolver. The first
had been fired by Straight, who used a silencer. The faint mark
is on the revolver still. I think that your brother had but that
moment come downstairs and learnt from Mr. Newman, who had rushed
in to tell him the terrible truth&mdash;the truth he had to
know&mdash;of who it was that really been murdered in Heath
Mansions. Then Mr. Newman had to leave him for fear lest through
his presence that truth be suspected, and Thornbush be connected
with the brown and orange ulster. Probably your brother let Mr.
Newman out. In the letter-box he saw a letter which Major Cory
had just dropped in. I've had a chat, rather unwillingly and one-sided, perhaps, with that gentleman. It was a peculiarly menacing
letter from a man who felt that he had been intended for a
scapegoat. It was, I fancy, the little heap of charred paper that
Mr. Tindall and I found under Mr. Haslar's writing-table."</p>

<p>"But how did Mr. Newman know who the dead man was?"</p>

<p>"When Mr. Clifford left his home so abruptly, Mr. Newman, I
think, suspected that Mr. Haslar had had a hand in his absence.
And even on being told by your brother that he had nothing to do
with that absence, I think he still had his doubts, and had
tipped a porter at Heath Mansions to let him know when the new,
temporary tenant of Mr. Marshall's flat arrived. The man let out
the truth that a murdered man had been found there, and told him
of the taking away by the police of the body. Mr. Newman, I
think, stuck on a big black moustache, and going to the mortuary
chapel posed as a Spaniard who might be able to identify
Etcheverrey. We know that such a man called. I think Mr. Newman
recognised Mr. Clifford's very remarkable hands, and recognising
them, hurried at once to your brother's house&mdash;was met by
you and left. Returned again, and had a word with Mr. Haslar. We
shall soon learn if my ideas are fairly right."</p>

<p>They proved to be absolutely correct.</p>

<p>"But how do you know&mdash;did you suspect from the
first&mdash;I mean, that no one had shot Arnold but himself?"</p>

<p>Pointer looked across Diana at Tindall.</p>

<p>"There was a palm in a pot. The palm had been watered that
morning&mdash;it was all wet. The brass pot, in which the
earthenware one stood, was dry and even dusty. Yet when I tried
to lift the inner one out, it couldn't be done because of a deep
dent in the jardinière, a dent that obviously could not have been
there when the maid last took out the palm, a dent cause by that
revolver crashing against it when it fell from Mr. Haslar's hand.
Deflected by the brass pot, the weapon skidded along the floor to
near the window. I think Mr. Haslar utilised a moment to fire
when a motorcycle outside his house was starting up its
engine."</p>

<p>"But those awful words of Arnold's," Diana broke out: "'I did
it for nothing!'"</p>

<p>"He had shot, but not killed himself. And when he said he had
killed Mr. Clifford I think he believed that by devising that
plan for Cory to get the Haslar letters away from Mr. Clifford,
he had handed Julian Clifford over to a man who had killed him in
revenge for what had happened years ago&mdash;happened and never
been forgotten by Cory. The rest was but the effect of the shock
of the lurid descriptions in the papers, and of his knowledge of
whose that missing head was."</p>

<p>"Straight seemed shocked enough at what happened to Haslar,"
Tindall pointed out.</p>

<p>"Because he guessed the truth&mdash;that Mr. Haslar shot
himself. Straight <i>knew</i> that there was no murderer at large
but himself. And that meant that Mr. Haslar had learnt who it was
that had been killed in Heath Mansions, and did not believe in
the Etcheverrey trail. And if Mr. Haslar, then why not others?
When Mr. Haslar called out those words that night, Straight saw
that his best chance&mdash;there was no question of concealing
them&mdash; was to take his stand beside Miss Haslar. For a
while."</p>

<p>Again came one of the short pauses which people need when they
are trying to keep up with information that quite upsets their
own ideas.</p>

<p>"Then it wasn't my brother whom Mr. Straight had seen near
Heath Mansions?"</p>

<p>"I should say not, Miss Haslar. I think that was part of a
plan of Straight's to frighten you about your brother's
connection with the murder for his own ends. To play the part of
the faithful friend."</p>

<p>"But Arnold must have had some shock, so the doctor thought,
to account for his state that morning."</p>

<p>"That was probably administered by Mrs. Orr. In our talk at
Bruges after you left, I learnt from her that she had
written&mdash; well&mdash;a farewell little note to Mr. Haslar
from Paris. It reached Hampstead Tuesday morning. He found it
lying on the breakfast table for him. It was a very cruel little
note.</p>

<p>"A definite break. Mrs. Orr did not want your brother coming
on after her, and interfering with her quite well-laid
plans."</p>

<p>At any other time Diana would have made a scathing comment on
Mazod Orr giving up her brother, but now all she cared for was
that Arnold was cleared, and that Newman was cleared. Tindall and
Sir Edward left the room.</p>

<p>Diana took a deep breath. Her eyes were softly luminous. No
one could say that her face was cold now.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Newman took everything on himself!" There was a
little pause. "Oh, if only I dared! Does blood&mdash;even such
blood matter really. After all, we Haslars&mdash;he is all that's
fine. Surely if he could come unscathed from out of such a home,
others could. Under better, happier circumstances."</p>

<p>"Come along and let's see what Mr. Newman has to say,"
Pointer's tone had something boyish in it, as he led her into a
room where Newman was standing, his face like the face of a
crusader who has won through to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>"Well, Chief Inspector, I take off my hat to you! Especially
after I&mdash;I'm glad you know now that I didn't kill Julian
Clifford. A man I place second only to Peter Haslar. To whom I
owe&mdash;all that I do owe him. You are right all along the
line. Even as to my being the man who called to see Etcheverrey's
body. I never imagined any one could unravel this tangle!"</p>

<p>"Especially"&mdash;Pointer spoke grimly&mdash;"after you had
twisted it up still more by that so-called confession of yours.
Oh, I know why you did it. To pay back the debt you owed to the
dead brother. For Miss Haslar's sake, too, probably. But I hope
the thought that you might easily have gone to the gallows
instead of Richard Straight, will keep you from ever doing such a
thing again. Your improvised motive to me this evening was really
alarmingly pat."</p>

<p>It was a very official eye that looked frostily at the other
man.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;at the time it seemed the only chance. I knew Arnold
would never have done it in cold blood, of course. But I was
afraid that some discussion about his grandfather's
letters&mdash;And when you nearly broke me down with what the
police might think but for my confession, I didn't dare speak
without thinking it all over. I&mdash;well, frankly I thought it
might be a trap. Though there was the ghastly chance that it
might all be true. It was&mdash;it was&mdash; "</p>

<p>With a deep sigh, Newman tossed what it had been, away from
him for ever.</p>

<p>"It was my duty to break down what I firmly believed to be a
spurious confession," Pointer said, inwardly a little amused at
the positively ferocious glare that Diana was fixing on him. "Now
I really would like to hear your explanation of two things.
First, Mr. Pollock's furniture."</p>

<p>Diana stared. But Newman looked faintly self-conscious. "Ever
heard of <i>The Knight's Dream</i>?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You mean the musical comedy that's been running for a couple
of years?"</p>

<p>"I wrote it&mdash;words and music. It's a gold-mine
apparently. I'm working on another. My agents only know me as
Pollock, of course. And the only address they have are my bankers
and the Musicians' Club in Wigmore Street. And your second
question, Chief Inspector?"</p>

<p>"We found a charred piece of a letter in your room at
Thornbush on which we deciphered in Mr. Clifford's writing, 'I
know the danger,' discovered your secret,' 'wife.' At least I
believe the word to be wife. Now those sentences looked rather
damning, but wasn't the secret that Mr. Clifford thought he had
discovered your love for Miss Haslar?"</p>

<p>Diana gave a gasp. "What a dreadful scrap of paper to
find!"</p>

<p>"It was puzzling!" Pointer agreed.</p>

<p>"Yes," Newman said, screwing up his eyes in thought. "Yes, the
whole sentence ran somewhat after this fashion. I know that
letter by heart," he added turning round with a look new to
Pointer&mdash;a look that changed him into the lad Diana had
loved at Hendaye.</p>

<p>"'I know the danger of jumping to conclusions, but I feel sure
that I have discovered your secret of hoping to make Diana some
day your wife.' And Mr. Clifford went on in the kindest way to
tell me, that in justice to Diana herself, that must not be. I
might be married already."</p>

<p>"When did he write this?"</p>

<p>"Two years ago."</p>

<p>Two years ago was the time when Julian Clifford had altered
his will so as to leave Newman, if still unmarried, a
competency.</p>

<p>"And you replied?" Pointer thought it as well to take
advantage of this moment to know all that there was to be
known.</p>

<p>"I told him he was utterly mistaken in my feeling for you,"
Newman flashed a grim, yet fond smile at Diana, whose eyes were
brimming. "I kept the letter as an additional help to&mdash;stick
to my guns. But I wonder that such a sentence, found in such a
case, didn't hang me," he threw at Pointer interrogatively.</p>

<p>"You were so careful to make your flight look suspicious,"
Pointer said with a half unwilling smile in reply. "You had gone
to so much time and trouble in your bedroom to take down a
suitcase, and get a bag off your wardrobe top, and strew so many
garments, each of which you had to take from its place, around
the room, that it seemed odd you should have burnt this letter if
it really was incriminating.</p>

<p>"But Miss Haslar is waiting to hear what it was that the
Superintendent told you. My best wishes, Mr. Penfold." And
Pointer closed the door behind him.</p>
