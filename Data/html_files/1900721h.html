<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER 1. &mdash; AT THE AMERICAN
EXCHANGE</h2>

<p class="first">AS soon as he entered Portland, Logan Stuart
stabled his horse at the Fashion Livery on Oak and retraced his
way along Front Street toward the express office. A violent
southwest wind rolled ragged black clouds low over the town and
the flatly swollen drops of an intemperate rain formed a slanting
silver screen all around him, dimpling the street's watery mud
and dancing a crystal dance on glistening rooftops. The plank
walk-ways across the street intersections were half afloat and
sank beneath his weight as he used them; at two o'clock of such a
day the kerosene lights were sparkling through drenched panes and
the smell of the saloons, when he moved by them, was a rich warm
blend of tobacco, whisky and men's soaked woolen clothes.</p>

<p>Three or four sailing ships lay at the levee with their bare
spars showing above the row of frame buildings on Front. Beyond
Seventh, in the other direction, the great fir forest was a black
semicircle crowding Portland's thousand people hard against the
river. Tradesmen's shingles squealed on their iron brackets and a
raw wild odor&mdash;of massive timbered hills and valleys turned
sweet by rain&mdash;assailed Logan Stuart and as he turned into
the express office he saw a stocky shape, vague in this agitated
twilight, wheel abruptly through a saloon's doorway ahead of him.
A four-horse dray came up Front at the moment, the great wheels
of the dray plunged half to the hubs; the teamster's cursing,
issued with vigor, was instantly lost in the steady tempest.</p>

<p>The express office was warm and quiet once the door had closed
behind Logan Stuart. He dropped his saddlebags on the counter and
watched a young man with a dry, cool visage rise and come
forward. The young man, Cornelius van Houten, wore a pair of
steel-rimmed glasses in whose lenses the room's yellow lamplight
bloomed.</p>

<p>"Damp day," said van Houten. "How's Jacksonville?"</p>

<p>"Lively," replied Stuart and opened the saddlebags to lay upon
the counter a dozen gold pokes crowded skintight with nuggets and
dust. With the drawstring clinched at the end of each, they
looked like fat summer sausages.</p>

<p>"Credit to account?" asked van Houten.</p>

<p>"I'll take back specie. We're shy on cash at the diggings.
What time do you open in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow's Sunday."</p>

<p>"Put the specie in the saddlebags. I'll get them before you
close tonight and keep them in my hotel room."</p>

<p>"I'd guess you've got seven thousand there&mdash;and that's no
trinket to be left loose in a hotel room."</p>

<p>"Cornelius," said Stuart with a smile that broke the rough
reserve on his face, "gold is only yellow gravel."</p>

<p>"Ah," said van Houten, agreeably dissenting, "but the yellow
color makes a difference."</p>

<p>"Butter's yellow, too, and you can spread it on bread. Ever
try that with gold?"</p>

<p>"For a man of business," commented van Houten, "you have got
odd notions. Were I a banker, as I someday shall be, I should
conclude you unsound and lend you nothing."</p>

<p>"A man can choose his gods, Cornelius. What are your
gods?"</p>

<p>"What?" asked van Houten.</p>

<p>Logan Stuart returned to the intemperate day.</p>

<p>The rain had thickened until the buildings across the street
squatted half vague in the sparkling downpour and ropy cascades
splashed upon the sidewalk from gorged eaves. Out in the middle
of the street a man stood on the surface of a stump with a set of
muttonchop whiskers wetly plastered to his jowls and watched the
yellow mud slowly flow around him. Stuart turned into a store at
the corner of Alder, bought himself some dry clothes and made a
couple of purchases for the Dance family away down the Oregon-
California road, and thereafter walked a narrow plank across
Front Street and entered a barber-shop near the American Exchange
Hotel.</p>

<p>He had a bath, a shave and a haircut; and with a cigar
fragrantly ignited between his lips, he went on to the American
Exchange, got a room and ascended to it. He laid his wet clothes
over a chair, walked a restless circle around the room and
brought up at one of the two windows in the room to watch the
storm-battered street below him. Above him, the peak of the hotel
roof emitted a dull organ tone as the wind struck it With one
shoulder tipped against the windowsill he achieved a moment's
stillness not characteristic of him. He was a man of loose and
rough and durable parts, like a machine intended for hard usage;
there was no fineness or smoothness about him. His long mouth was
expressive only when he smiled and his heavy nose swelled
somewhat at the base to accommodate wide nostrils. He had the
blackest of hair, lying in long chunks on his head; his eyes were
sharp gray and well-bedded in their sockets&mdash;and all this
made a face which in repose held the mixed elements of sadness
and strong temper. Only when that face lightened did it show any
sign of the rash streak which he possessed. He was a little under
six feet, long of arms and meaty of legs, with a chest that had
breadth rather than thickness. A scar shaped like a fish hook
stood at the left corner of his mouth, the relic of some fist
fight he had been rather eager to indulge in when younger. Now at
twenty-eight he had better control of himself.</p>

<p>He could stand still only for a short while, and suddenly
turned from the window, left the room and descended the stairs to
the saloon which adjoined the American Exchange's lobby.</p>

<p>Henry McLane saw him at once and beckoned him over for a
drink. "Just to keep the chills out," said Henry. "How's things
at the mines?"</p>

<p>"Brisk," said Logan Stuart and heard the hoarse whistle of a
steamboat in the river; that would be the <i>Belle</i> coming in
from the Cascades run. He made room for himself at the crowded
bar, beside Henry McLane, who removed his stovepipe hat and
thumped it like a drum to catch the barman's attention. At five
o'clock there was no natural light left in this drowned
world.</p>

<p>"What are the Indians going to do this year?" asked Henry
McLane.</p>

<p>"It is, so far, quiet and uncertain."</p>

<p>The barroom was at this hour of a bad day crowded, smoky and
cheerful. Portland was a new and small town on the scarcely
explored northwest coast, therefore Portland was still largely a
town of bachelors arrived in search of the business chance; and
the American Exchange bar served them both as a club and a
commercial meeting point. Here were the plain types of a new
land: the ship captain with his benign mutton chops and his
frosty eyes; the farmer stained with the back country's mud
roads; the emigrant whose manner was brisk and blunt and hearty
and whose voice was pitched to Oregon's deep timbered reaches and
long open plains; and the New Englander, so sharp and so cool,
who had come here specifically for the mercantile advantages to
be had in a fresh land and who meant to seize them and make his
fortune. There was an Eastern twang in the room's talk, mixed
with Iowa, mixed with Missouri, and mixed with Virginia's
softness.</p>

<p>"Logan," said Henry McLane, "I have got a consignment of goods
from the brig <i>Alice,</i> to be delivered to Clay and King at
Jacksonville. I shall ship by the boat <i>Canemah</i> to Salem.
Do you wish the business of packing it from there? General
hardware, a few bolts of cloth, buckets, tin dishes, rope."</p>

<p>"How many mules will it make?"</p>

<p>"Twenty, I suppose. What's your freight?"</p>

<p>"Three dollars the mule per day."</p>

<p>McLane studied it a moment and nodded his head. "Agreeable. It
will be at Salem on the twentieth of the month."</p>

<p>The deal having been made, Logan Stuart bought the second
round of drinks, after which McLane excused himself. "I have got
to see if George Miller can take a load of windows out toward
Gale's creek."</p>

<p>"Windows&mdash;windows with glass?"</p>

<p>"We are becoming civilized," said McLane and moved away to
intercept a man in muddy boots, round fur cap and a huge army
overcoat. "George," he called through the steady confusion of the
saloon. "George!"</p>

<p>The place was packed. Logan Stuart pressed his way through the
crowd and circled a group who were deep in reminiscences
concerning the emigrant trail. Five of Portland's leading
businessmen sat at a poker table, closely engaged with some
business speculation of their own; and a ship captain near by was
in half an argument with another man. "Lumber's selling sky high
in San Francisco and you'll make a handsome profit. You have got
to let other men make a little. Don't haggle so damned much over
the freight, my friend, or I'll pull out of here in ballast."
When he left the saloon, Logan Stuart observed that Henry McLane
was at the bar again, sealing another bargain.</p>

<p>He crossed to the clerk's desk. "Miss Lucy Overmire
arrived?"</p>

<p>"In Ten," said the clerk, "just off the Cascades boat. She has
been asking for George Camrose."</p>

<p>Stuart walked up a stairway whose red plush runner was stained
with the day's fresh mud.</p>

<p>He turned down the hall and he stood a moment in front of her
door, visualizing her face with a keen start of interest; then he
knocked and heard her voice murmur, "Come in, George."</p>

<p>She was in the center of the room when he opened the door and
she had a smile on her face. But it was a smile meant for Camrose
and he now observed the smile change character. Something went
out of it, he didn't know what; and something came into it, nor
did he know what that quality was.</p>

<p>"George knew I was coming up, and asked me to bring you home.
He had a sudden trip to make toward Crescent City."</p>

<p>"Will you mind having me on your hands, Logan?" Then quite
unexpectedly she broke into a small, free laugh. "That was a
foolish question. You don't mind women on your hands."</p>

<p>"Who has given me that reputation?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Rumor."</p>

<p>"Rumor borne by George Camrose," he said. "The man is building
up his faithfulness at my expense. Have you got stout clothes? We
leave before daylight and the weather is foul."</p>

<p>"I do not mind," she said and watched him with her lips
retaining the smile in their corners.</p>

<p>There was a speculative light in her eyes and the shape of
judgment on her face&mdash;and this too was something familiar to
him. They knew each other very well. She wore a brown and
beautiful dress and her black hair was softly, shiningly plaited
back of her head. She was a filled-out and mature woman within
her clothes.</p>

<p>"Supper?" he said.</p>

<p>She moved to the bureau mirror to give herself a swift glance;
and, catching up a shawl-like wrap, she moved down the stairs
with him into the dining room. Talk made a great racket in the
place; at the bachelors' table in the center of the room Logan
Stuart saw Henry McLane, turned pink and dignified with his
business trips to the bar.</p>

<p>She sat across from Stuart, pleasantly still; she was aware of
her surroundings and occasionally her eyes showed curiosity and
some vagrant thought stirred her face. Then he found her
attention on him, once more with its deep and well-guarded
interest. Sometimes warmth lay between them, strong and
unsettling, and his own expression would sharpen; and at times
like these the bare repose of his face would break, giving way to
smiling restlessness. It was these times when she looked at him
most observantly, trying to read him.</p>

<p>"How was your visit?" he asked. "How was The Dalles?"</p>

<p>"Quiet," she said. "But, Logan, there are a lot of cattle and
horses up there which have been abandoned by the emigrants when
they came down the river. They could be gotten for very little.
Perhaps it would be profitable to buy and drive them to Southern
Oregon."</p>

<p>"See any mules?"</p>

<p>She sat still, trying to remember, and for an instant he saw
in this stillness a quality that struck roughly through him.</p>

<p>"No," she said. But she observed the change of his expression
and her guard lifted again. They ate a silent meal and moved back
to the stairs. He walked up to her door with her and paused a
moment.</p>

<p>"Five o'clock," he said. "And dress warm. We'll make Salem the
first day and the head of the Long Tom the second. We ought to be
in Jacksonville Friday afternoon. Is that traveling too fast for
you?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I suppose you're going down to play a little
poker now."</p>

<p>"I guess not. Good night."</p>

<p>Her answering "Good night" followed him. He went past the door
of his own room and stopped at the stairs, looking back. She
still stood by her door, the hall lamp showing the outline of her
face.</p>

<p>"A woman, Logan?"</p>

<p>He laughed, and saw a sudden gust of anger come to her. She
turned in and closed the door. He had been amused at her
suspicion but, going down the stairs, he no longer found
amusement in her judgment of him. He was restless, he was
irritated and he thought: "George must have made me out a hell of
a fellow. I shall have to speak to him." He heard the beat of the
rain on the hotel wall and he went back up to his room for his
coat and hat; afterwards he walked along the black gut of Front
Street and crossed over to the express office. Van Houten had
delayed closing time for him; and now brought the saddlebags out
of the big company safe.</p>

<p>"Sure you want to keep this in the hotel room?"</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Stuart and slung the bags over his
shoulder. He waited while van Houten snuffed out the lamps and
damped the cast-iron stove. Van Houten took up a dragoon pistol
from behind the counter and locked the office door. He said
something which was washed away by the tidal wind, and put
himself between Stuart and the building walls as they walked back
toward the American Exchange. He fell from the narrow crossing
plank, up to his boot tops, and bitterly swore. At the hotel's
doorway he stopped and said, "Luck." By the light glowing through
the doorway Stuart saw that the young man had carried the dragoon
pistol cocked and presented all the way from the express
office.</p>

<p>"Keep your feet dry," said Stuart and watched van Houten
vanish completely three steps onward; it was that black a night.
He crossed the lobby and tramped up the stairs, at the upper
landing he paused and then went on to Lucy Overmire's door. He
knocked and heard her voice, still cool, call him in.</p>

<p>She stood by the window, now turning to look at him and show
him the same reserved judgment he had seen before. "No," he said,
"it wasn't a woman."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so, then?"</p>

<p>"You're marrying George, not me," he said.</p>

<p>"Why should I tell you where I'm going?"</p>

<p>Suddenly they were laughing at each other. She came across the
room, the room's light richening her cheeks; she looked up at
him, speaking with a blended sharpness and softness. "I'd never
want a woman to make a fool of you, Logan."</p>

<p>"Do you question George like this?"</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "it has never occurred to me to doubt
him."</p>

<p>"I am flattered by the distinction," he dryly said.</p>

<p>"George is less vulnerable than you, with women. He judges
them more critically. You have too much compassion in you, Logan.
You're fair game."</p>

<p>"Am I?" he said. "Yet he's engaged, and I am not."</p>

<p>"What have you got in the saddlebags?"</p>

<p>"Gold coin."</p>

<p>"I watched you from the hotel window. There was a man standing
at the corner of Alder as you passed. He followed you across the
mud."</p>

<p>"Good night, Lucy," he said and left the room. Noise came
robustly up from the lobby and saloon. In his own room he put the
saddlebags beneath the mattress at the head of the bead. He
stripped to his woolen underwear and drank from the water
pitcher, and then braced a chair under the door's knob. There
were no catches on the two windows, but they were both fifteen
feet or more above the street level and not to be worried about.
He slid his revolver under the pillow, turned out the light and
lay flat on his back, listening to the steady slash of the rain
against the hotel; now and then a harsher gust of wind shook the
whole structure. For a moment he thought of Lucy as she stood in
her room, a fairer woman than any man had a right to expect; he
remembered her face as it lightened with laughter, and the tones
of that laughter, and he remembered how still her eyes could be,
how deep in them were the strange things she felt. He fell
asleep...</p>

<p>He was a man who slept without dreaming, and who slept light.
Thus when a gust of cold wind touched the back of his head his
eyes came instantly open. He lay with his back to the side window
and he had his arms beneath the bed covers so that he could not
easily reach his revolver. There was a faint sliding sound in the
room, and the sibilance of a man's heavy breathing. The breathing
diminished for a little while, and then it grew greater and
Stuart felt a hand move gingerly along the bed's edge. Stuart
pictured the man's location&mdash;and swung and raised himself
and seized the heavy shadow before him. His arms went around a
thick body; he was carried off the bed by the man's rapid turn,
and he was dropped to his feet. He hung on. He butted the top of
his head against the prowler's chin and heard it crack; then the
prowler's forearm came down on the back of his neck with all the
power of a club. It stunned him and sent him falling backward
upon the bed. He got his feet up and he plunged them full into
the prowler's belly as the latter was about to fall upon him. His
head ached in full violence, and flashes of light danced before
his eyes. He heard the prowler stumble backward and curse under
his breath; and then he reached under his pillow and seized up
his gun. He righted himself on the bed for a shot. He fired at
the man's moving shadow and in another moment the prowler,
rushing low across the room, went out through the window, taking
sash and glass with him.</p>

<p>He heard the man fall in the alley below. When he reached the
window he saw nothing in the alley's black strip below him, but
he caught the last swashing echoes of the man's steps as the
latter ran through the pure mud toward the river.</p>

<p>Cold wind poured through the window and there was a racket in
the hotel's hallway. The chair blocking the door capsized and the
door wheeled open, letting in the sallow light of a hall lamp. A
man peered through the doorway. "What the hell's going
on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Stuart. "Close the door and go away."</p>

<p>The door swung shut, blocking the violent gust of wind. Stuart
stood still a little while, slowly turning his neck from side to
side. "A funny one," he thought. "He must have had an arm like a
chunk of oak. Damned near tore my neck apart." He settled down on
the bed, he lay gingerly back, favoring the steady ache; he lay
flat, staring up to the black ceiling. "It might have been
Bragg," he said to himself. "It might have been."</p>

<p>The door opened again and Lucy's voice came across the room,
gently disturbed. "Logan."</p>

<p>The light was faintly on her and he saw her tall-shaped in her
robe with her hair braided down behind. He saw the vague
silhouette of her face as she walked toward him and stood over
his bed. "Logan."</p>

<p>"Nothing at all," he said. "He got away. It was a bad try."
His head quit aching; it ceased to pound as abruptly as it had
begun, and presently he felt good. "Lucy, get out of here."</p>

<p>She stood wholly motionless, looking down at him. She said:
"Did you get hurt?"</p>

<p>"No. You go on."</p>

<p>He watched her as she retreated; he saw her turn and look back
a moment, and then close the door.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER 2. &mdash; LUCY'S MAN</h2>

<p class="first">THEY left Portland at six o'clock of a rain-
drowned morning, crossed the ferry and moved through the fir
timber's dense twilight all the way to the Clackamas. Beyond
Oregon City they came out upon the flat Willamette Valley,
bordered eastward by the Cascades and on the west by the Coast
Range. Ranch houses stood at lonely distance, low and dark in the
rain fog, and now and then the pure mud road skirted the porch of
a store or a rough frame cabin serving as a tavern for passers-
by. At dusk of a weeping day they reached Salem, whose few houses
were the outgrowth of a Methodist mission, and there slept.</p>

<p>The rain held on, turning the valley greener before their eyes
as they pushed south. They ferried the Santiam at Syracuse City
and spent the second night at the Harris Claim. The third day
took them through Skinner's and on down to the valley's narrowing
foot; and the fourth day saw them through the Calapooyia's rough
and timbered ridges&mdash;by way of the military road&mdash;and
on to Jesse Applegate's house. The dark fir timber began to give
way before oak and madrona and pine, and the rain ceased and the
land grew warm and brown. They traveled fast, passing wagons
loaded deep with settlers' household freight; they came upon mule
trains and single travelers on horseback. On the fifth day they
crossed the Umpqua at Aaron Roses's store and in the late
afternoon they reached a little settlement built at the narrow
mouth of a canyon whose sides rose up in increasing sharpness,
heavy-clad with trees. All the country before them was massive
and broken.</p>

<p>Cliff Anslem came out of his cabin while Stuart unsaddled.</p>

<p>"One miner killed on upper Graves Creek two nights ago,"
Anslem said. "It was Limpy's Indians, I think. There's a cavalry
outfit somewhere in the canyon now, under that young fellow
Bristow. Pack outfits have been going through doubled up for
safety. Tomorrow morn-in' you'll have plenty of company."</p>

<p>"Too slow," said Stuart. He turned to the girl. "We'll make a
night ride of it and reach Dance's by daylight, if you can stand
it."</p>

<p>Lucy nodded and walked into the cabin while Anslem drove the
horses into his compound.</p>

<p>Four or five cabins lay scattered in the little meadow at the
base of these rough hills and a steady current of wind came out
of the canyon, cool and wild. A last sunlight streamed over the
meadow, strengthening the pungency of its natural hay. Stuart sat
down on the edge of the dusty road; he leaned back and lighted
his pipe and he heard the tinkling approach of a pack outfit's
bell mare. Twilight began to flow off the mountain as the pack
outfit, out of Scottsburg's settlement for the mines, arrived and
halted to make camp. It was a Howison string, loaded with sugar,
coffee and salt. A campfire blossomed in the shadows as Anslem
called Stuart to supper.</p>

<p>The cabin was a single room with a bed, a table and a
fireplace. Lucy lay on the bed, half awakened from her short
sleep. She had her glance on the ceiling directly above her and
the yellow lamplight of the room danced in her eyes. Stuart
paused by the bed, his head dropped as he looked upon her. She
lifted a hand to him; he took it, swinging her upright, and
suddenly she laughed at him and made a quick turn away to the
supper table. Mrs. Anslem gave these two a quick and slyly warm
glance and afterwards served supper&mdash;venison and beans and
biscuits. Horsemen fell out of the canyon at a whirling run and a
sharp voice gave a command. Anslem rose and walked to the
door.</p>

<p>"Supper's ready, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>The lieutenant, when he entered, was stained by a hard day's
riding; he had a full beard to cover a youthful face and his eyes
were dancing bright. He said: "Hello, Logan&mdash;Miss Over-mire,
how do?" and he took his place and made no ceremony about his
meal.</p>

<p>"What's up there in the canyon?"</p>

<p>"A lot of tracks across the Cow Creek meadows."</p>

<p>Anslem said: "I'll saddle for you, Logan," and left the
house.</p>

<p>"You're going now?" asked the lieutenant. "Limpy and his bucks
are somewhere, but I don't know where. Maybe we'll have a quiet
year."</p>

<p>Mrs. Anslem, standing before the fireplace's crane to watch
the coffeepot, looked around at him. "There's never a quiet
year."</p>

<p>Anslem had the horses waiting outside. Stuart rose with Lucy
and as the two of them walked toward the door, Mrs. Anslem
murmured: "Give my hello to the Dances and say I'm lonesome for
talk."</p>

<p>Full dark was a cape loosely thrown over the mountains and
upon the meadow and the baying of Anslem's dogs woke echoes far
through the furrowed hills. Lucy's smile came down to Stuart as
he handed her up to the saddle. He adjusted his saddlebags, he
slid his rifle tentatively in and out of its boot and he passed a
hand across the butt of his revolver. He said "So long" to Anslem
and moved away with Lucy beside him. The canyon's breath was damp
and cold upon them. The trail tilted up and the soft dust
absorbed the sound of the horses' pacing. A creek ran hard beside
the trail, musically brawling over its stones, and a night-
prowling animal crossed fugitively before them and slipped into
the timber. The sky was a steel-blue alley edged by the ragged
shadow of timber. An hour from Anslem's they paused and rested
and were still; and went on. A rising quarter moon painted dull
silver patches on the canyon walls, and glinted against the creek
and glowed dully on the bleached trunks of fire-killed firs.
Another hour brought them to the head of the canyon and dropped
them out upon a mountain meadow lying as a dark and half-hidden
lake against the bulky shores of the mountains round about. A
keener wind blew against them. Paused to rest, Stuart listened
for whatever the wind might bring. He was sharp and he was wholly
roused, but when he looked at Lucy he was smiling. Her voice came
to him in careful smallness. "You are never happy except when in
motion."</p>

<p>He said, "Hark," and thought he heard a running rumor in the
night. Far over the meadow&mdash;a mile away&mdash;there seemed
to be a party traveling. The horses were still, their heads
alertly pointed; they were breathing deeper, they were scenting
for something which interested them. Then the sound ceased.</p>

<p>They forded a shallow creek and turned into the meadow,
crossing over. The creek's willows idly danced in the light wind
and the creek was a pale and crooked streak. The massive
blackness of the mountains closed presently down upon them again
and they began to climb steadily along a sightless lane between
huge, still fir columns. Here he stopped once more to rest the
horses.</p>

<p>She said: "A house, an office, or a woman you've known more
than a week&mdash;these things grow old to you. You ride into
Jacksonville, spend a night, and you are gone."</p>

<p>"My business needs a lot of riding."</p>

<p>"You ride for business&mdash;and you ride just to be
riding."</p>

<p>"How is it you know that much about me?"</p>

<p>"No woman can look at a man two years without knowing
something of him."</p>

<p>"You know more about me," he said, "than I know about
you."</p>

<p>"Women are always more observant&mdash;and more
interested."</p>

<p>He swung his horse around, caught the rein of Lucy's mount and
moved off the trail. A sound grew greater above them and became
the rush of a single rider flinging himself through this blind
corridor without caution. He passed them at arm's length; he was
making a small singing sound as he rode, as though breaking his
loneliness. They heard him run downgrade and long afterward they
made out the tattoo of his horse in the meadow below. Stuart and
Lucy returned to the trail. He still remembered her question; he
thought of it a long while as he rode.</p>

<p>"I want my business to grow," he said at last. "I want to see
a Stuart &amp; Company pack outfit stringing along every road.
When stages come, I want them to be Stuart &amp; Company stages.
I guess I am ambitious."</p>

<p>"Even ambition would not push you so hard. You are not quite
happy. Something bothers you. It may be something you look for,
or something that dissatisfies you."</p>

<p>He rode on without comment, his mind half on her talk, half on
the sounds and sensations around him. He heard her voice, so low
and seriously soft, come through the blackness. "Is it a
woman?"</p>

<p>"Damn George Camrose for giving me a bad reputation," he
murmured. "Must it always be a woman who makes a man lie awake at
night?"</p>

<p>"When the time comes, don't let it be an ordinary woman. Don't
let it be a calm woman."</p>

<p>"Why not?" he said.</p>

<p>"You'd come to hate her," she said. They rode in silence,
through midnight and the pit-black hours while the trail carried
them higher into the mountains and a canyon deepened below them
on the left, felt rather than seen. Once they caught a moment's
view of a light burning far down at the canyon's bottom. "Ed
Blackerby," he murmured. The air was thin and cold and the odor
of the mountain was stronger and stronger; it was a wildness
flowing from unknown reaches, out of places never seen since time
began. Somewhere half between midnight and first dawn, he stopped
for a longer rest and lifted Lucy from her saddle; her weight
came down against him and she stood passive in his arms for a
moment, and her face tilted upward, so near to him that he saw
the weariness on it. He dropped his arms and took a backward step
to his saddle, unlashing an overcoat tied behind the cantle. He
laid the coat on the trail and watched her sink down and curl
upon it. He crouched near her and pulled the edges of the coat
around her, meanwhile searching a coat pocket for his pipe. He
held the pipe cold between his teeth while he listened to the
forest, to the fugitive murmurings all about, the sibilance of
disturbed brush, the faint abrasions of padded feet, the velvet
whirring of wings, to all the undertones of this massive
earth.</p>

<p>She was sound asleep when he bent down, half an hour later,
and placed his hand on her cheek. He said, "Lucy," and heard her
answer from her sleep. Her name was a pleasant echo, it was soft
on his tongue and he said it again, "Lucy," and watched her sit
up and turn her head in the darkness.</p>

<p>He helped her to the saddle and rolled his overcoat and lashed
it fast. Resuming the march, they moved steadily through the low
hours, through the world's ebb time, bending with the trail and
dipping with it, into glen and up sharp slope and down sudden
grades. The moon, pale and futile during the night, now vanished
behind the massive western ridges and the blackness was greater
than before. This was the time before dawn, when the vitality of
all things burned fitful and uncertain. By degrees he began to
feel the nearness of open country. The weight of the timber mass
pressed less heavily against him and the color of the foreground
grew paler, until finally the trail came out of the timber and
descended in long, turning loops to a lower country. Just before
daylight he saw a single light shining in the distance.</p>

<p>Morning twilight was breaking when he came before the cabin of
Ben Dance and helped Lucy to the ground. Dance's dogs were
shouting around him and the smell of woodsmoke and coffee laced
the thin air. The cabin door opened and a flood of yellow light
gushed out and a man took a quick step through the door and moved
aside from it. He had a rifle across his arm, ready for use; when
he identified these two people he let his robust voice fall upon
them. "Come in&mdash;come in. Breakfast's waitin'. Asa, come out
and get these horses."</p>

<p>Lucy went directly into the cabin. Stuart stood a moment with
the saddlebags over a shoulder, watching morning spread over the
eastern ridge tops; it moved in formless waves, spreading like
mist, water-colored, trickling over the high summits and
spreading downslope through the black hill creases. The sky began
to grow blue, the stars slowly to fade. Young Asa took the horses
away.</p>

<p>"The young lieutenant passed here yesterday," said Dance.</p>

<p>"One miner dead."</p>

<p>"Peaceful for this time of year," said Dance.</p>

<p>Stuart ducked through Dance's door and faced a bright fire on
the open hearth. There was a table at which Lucy now sat; two
more Dance boys sat by it, eating without lifting their heads.
Mrs. Dance, scarcely forty, turned a pan of cornbread onto a
platter and gave Logan a brisk smile. "How's Portland,
Logan?"</p>

<p>"A thousand people, and raining."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mrs. Dance and shook her head. Her skin was dark
and her features were practical and pretty. "How can anyone live
in such a crowd?"</p>

<p>Dance came in with a question. "You want me to change horses
for you now?"</p>

<p>"We'll sleep till noon."</p>

<p>"Caroline," shouted Dance, "fix the beds."</p>

<p>A girl came out of the cabin's adjoining room and gave Lucy a
nod and Stuart a longer glance.</p>

<p>Her even "Hello" covered both people. She was near twenty with
her mother's blue eyes and her mother's mass of light-brown hair.
Her round arms were bare to her elbows, and her mouth was calm
and full.</p>

<p>"I've got something for you," said Stuart. "What?" said the
girl.</p>

<p>"If you've got on your brown dress at noon I'll give it to
you."</p>

<p>Caroline Dance tipped her head aside as she studied Stuart,
and her lips showed a warming interest. "Perhaps," she said in a
skeptical tone, and left the room.</p>

<p>Lucy rose from her breakfast and walked into the other room.
Stuart loitered over his coffee and his pipe; the Dance boys rose
and silently departed, like young hounds bound for a fresh scent.
Dance sat at the table awhile to supply the week's gossip and
then Stuart tapped out his pipe and stepped into the extra room.
There were three beds in it and a rag rug on the dirt floor. Lucy
lay already asleep, her hands doubled in front of her face. He
watched her a moment, and then lay down on the adjoining bed.</p>

<p><br> <br> At noon there were three horses waiting in the yard
instead of two. Caroline Dance sat in the saddle of the third one
when Stuart and Lucy came out of the cabin. Dance explained this
in his vigorous voice: "Ma's sending Caroline down to Megarry's
place. Missis Megarry's come to her time." Mrs. Dance stepped
from the cabin with a plump package and handed it up to Caroline.
"Now that's everything you need."</p>

<p>Stuart said: "You want me to send Dr. Balance back from
Jacksonville?"</p>

<p>Caroline shook her head. She was in her brown dress and she
had her hair done neatly up. "I can do everything necessary," she
said. "For sure," added Mrs. Dance, surprised there should be any
question. "It's only a baby. You stay at Megarry's tonight,
Caroline, and come home tomorrow."</p>

<p>The day was hot and still and the trail ran southward up and
down a series of rounded knolls and ridges which were the ragged
extension of the heavier mountains to the east. They slid into a
short valley half surrounded by hills and passed a small
settlement sitting beside Rogue River; they crossed the ferry and
went briskly along the river. A few miles beyond the ferry,
Caroline Dance drew in her horse before a cabin which was
scarcely more than a lean-to. This was Megarry's. A woman came to
the door and tipped her hand across her eyes against the sun. She
said: "Caroline, you ain't much time."</p>

<p>Caroline sat still in the saddle, facing Stuart. She wasn't
smiling but anticipation made her mouth quietly expressive. He
had teased her with his delay, and she knew it, but it didn't
trouble her.</p>

<p>He drew a small package from his pocket and he took his time
unwrapping it. He held it concealed in his hand and rode his
horse near her and bent to put his hands around her head. He
swayed back on the saddle and watched her as she looked down to
the cameo brooch hanging from its thin gold chain around her
neck.</p>

<p>"Why," said Caroline with pleasure in her voice, "it's like my
Missouri grandmother's heirloom brooch."</p>

<p>The woman at the Megarry cabin called in sharper tone:
"There's no time, Caroline."</p>

<p>Excitement brightened Caroline's face and although she was not
an impulsive girl impulse nevertheless stirred her toward Stuart.
Then she remembered Lucy's presence, gave her an oblique glance
and swung down from her horse, at once going into the cabin.</p>

<p>Stuart and Lucy went on, pointing toward the opening bay of a
valley ahead. The river was beside them but the ridges slowly
receded to form a valley; the trail rose gradually from the
valley and began to cut its way southwestward along the bench.
Fort Lane showed in the distance, its log houses squatted under a
full bright sun on the north side of the river.</p>

<p>"You would have had your kiss, if I'd not been present to
interfere," Lucy commented. "Yes," said Stuart, amiable.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I caused you to miss it." She gave him a veiled
inspection. "She's twenty you're twenty-eight."</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?"</p>

<p>She met his eyes and she saw his smile; suddenly she began to
laugh. "Oh, Logan."</p>

<p>The trail took them around the breast of a hill and, at
sundown, brought them to a creek with its miners' brush lean-to
shelters, its canvas tents and flimsy log structures. They
crossed the creek and moved through a grove of pine and oak and
at last came out into the irregular lane which was Jacksonville's
main street.</p>

<p>It was a settlement of perhaps sixty houses built of logs and
riven cedar shakes, all scattered along the creek and up the side
of the surrounding hills. Supper time's smoke drifted out of tin
chimneys and men strolled the street, stained by the yellow-green
clay of the diggings. Riders drifted in and a pack train wound
down the slope of the hills from the west.</p>

<p>Stuart and Lucy passed a pair of saloons and Howison's big hay
shed; they skirted Stuart's own store and moved up toward a large
log-and-shake cabin on the hill slope. Jonas Over-mire stood
waiting for them with his hands in his front pockets and his
stovepipe tipped well forward to give his daughter a hand down
and he raked back his beard before he kissed her. Mrs. Overmire
came out to embrace her daughter, and then a shout reached them
and they saw George Camrose leave his cabin and walk rapidly
upgrade.</p>

<p>Stuart leaned his arms on the saddle horn to watch this scene.
Lucy had turned about to meet Camrose as he approached. He was a
high and handsome man, light of complexion and carefully dressed.
There was no mining-camp roughness on him at all, none of the
exaggerated mining-camp temper in him. He was cool and held
himself on tight rein, so that even now, approaching Lucy, he
carried himself with negligent restraint, as though he had seen
her but an hour before.</p>

<p>Lucy, Stuart noticed, seemed to match that temper and that
composure. She was unruffled and as certain of herself. She had a
smile for Camrose and she looked at him directly; yet Stuart saw
no great fire of impatience in either of them, no impetuous
wanting. He said to himself, "Is this the way a woman looks at a
man she loves?" He pushed his hands heavily against the saddle
and wondered what went on inside the girl. She murmured, "Hello,
George. Are you glad to see me?" Camrose put his arms around her,
smiling down. "You are always good to see," he murmured, and
lowered his face to kiss her.</p>

<p>She did a strange thing. She turned her head and she looked at
Stuart for a short moment with the gravest kind of an expression
on her face and for that instant he saw some kind of shadow in
her eyes. It was a thing quickly happening and soon passing, so
that he was not certain of what he saw. She looked back to
Camrose and took his kiss and stepped away.</p>

<p>Stuart said: "Is that the best you can do, George?"</p>

<p>Camrose stared at Stuart with a controlled grin. "Could you do
better?"</p>

<p>"A hell of a lot better," answered Stuart and rode away. A
gust of irritation unaccountably moved through him.</p>

<p><br> <br> He cooked supper in the small room behind the store;
he cleaned his dishes and strolled through the store's long main
room, around the boxes and kegs and bales of merchandise stacked
on the floor, past harness and lanterns hanging from the log
beams. He gave a glance to the well-stocked shelves and he
stopped a moment to watch his head clerk, Henry Clenchfield,
weigh out gold for a miner. A breeze came through the store to
stir up the sweet and musty and pungent odors of all this
merchandise.</p>

<p>He paused at the doorway and lighted a cigar. Voices softly
traveled through the night's bland warm air and the lamps of
Jacksonville winked tawny in the dark. A guitar somewhere sent
forth its lively tune and men drifted in from the dark creases of
the hills to break a long week's loneliness in the town's
deadfalls; and families arrived from their donation claims along
the Rogue.</p>

<p>He walked back into the store and sat down on a box. "Where's
John Trent?"</p>

<p>"He'll be in from Crescent City day after tomorrow," said
Clenchfield. "I sent forty mules on the trip. Burl McGiven left
two days ago for Yreka. Twenty mules. Jack Card left this morning
on the Applegate trip. Murrow and Vane Blazier will take the
Scottsburg string in the morning."</p>

<p>"Put this on the book," said Stuart. "Thirty mules to be at
Salem on the twentieth for Henry McLane's freight, off the boat
<i>Canemah."</i></p>

<p>"Where will you get the mules?" asked Clenchfield. "You have
got too much business now."</p>

<p>"Maybe it is time to buy a few more."</p>

<p>Clenchfield was an old country man, stiffened by years of
clerking. He was angular and bald and precise; and he had a good
head clerk's feeling of owning his job. Steel-rimmed glasses rode
low on a sharp nose and a high turkey neck rose through a collar
considerably too large.</p>

<p>"It is time to take some money out of the business instead of
putting it all back in. You have got a hundred thousand dollars
of equipment."</p>

<p>"Why, Clenchfield, we must be rich."</p>

<p>"This firm," said Clenchfield, "is too big a boat for the
water it floats in. If you had a bank to borrow on, it would not
matter, Since there is no bank around here, you should be your
own bank. You ought to have thirty thousand in gold coin laid by
for trouble. You have not got it."</p>

<p>"What trouble?" said Stuart.</p>

<p>Clenchfield shook his head. "For the trouble that always
comes. But you are a young man and trouble must beat you over the
head before you understand. How did I get here, six thousand
miles from Liverpool?"</p>

<p>"How did you get here, Clenchfield?"</p>

<p>"Once I was young and had a business, good as this. But I was
like you and I went broke."</p>

<p>"Henry," said Stuart, "there is a difference. Liverpool was an
old town, finished growing. This is a young town in a young
country. It will never stop growing for a hundred years. We sail
with the tide. It is a long tide. There will be no ebb in my
time."</p>

<p>"All Americans think that," said Clenchfield. "They think the
tide flows forever for them. But mark me: gold veins run out and
crops fail and men starve and wars come and businesses fail, and
towns die, and the hopes of men always run too fast and too
far."</p>

<p>"If everything fails," said Stuart, "everything will start
again."</p>

<p>"Well, you will buy the mules," said Clench-field.</p>

<p>"So I will. The fun is in growing. Not in having thirty
thousand in the safe."</p>

<p>"Wait till you're old."</p>

<p>"Never wait, Henry. Never wait for anything."</p>

<p>Young Vane Blazier, who was one of Stuart's packers, came
slowly through the doorway, all legs and neck and wild black hair
bushing down his head. He looked back of him into the night with
an air of worry. He reached into his pocket for his tobacco plug;
his long white teeth flashed as he bit into it. He replaced the
plug in his pocket and tilted his frame against the doorsill,
undecided.</p>

<p>"I'll take the Scottsburg ride with you, Vane," said Stuart.
"We'd better be on the road by six."</p>

<p>"All right," said Blazier. Hard thoughts drew his eyelids half
together and cut a notch in his forehead. Suddenly he seemed to
resolve the problem, straightened his shoulders and returned into
the night, passing Camrose and Lucy Overmire as they stepped into
the store.</p>

<p>Both of them smiled when they saw Stuart, as though the sight
of him sitting inactive were a humorous thing. Lucy sat down on a
drygoods box, facing him. "You were supposed to eat supper with
us."</p>

<p>"It occurred to me you and George might like to eat without
me," he said.</p>

<p>"A tender sentiment," said Camrose in a softly jeering
voice.</p>

<p>"George," said Stuart, "when is this woman marrying you?"</p>

<p>"I doubt if she has decided," said Camrose and turned to Lucy,
looking at her with his half-serious, half-smiling negligence. It
was a kind of mask, this negligence, covering the man's real
feelings. Whatever his real feelings were, they seldom broke
through the screen he placed over him. "When are you taking me,
Lucy?"</p>

<p>"Do you like poetry, George?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Must I like poetry to be your husband?"</p>

<p>"We shall be married when the leaves fall," she said. These
people, Stuart observed, were again matching moods&mdash;her
lightly indefinite manner against his smiling indifference.</p>

<p>"You string me up and let me swing," murmured George Camrose.
"The leaves of the maple which fall early, or the pine needles
which never fall?"</p>

<p>Stuart rose and jammed his hands in his front pockets; and the
expression on his face drew Camrose's chuckle. "Our friend
disapproves of us, Lucy."</p>

<p>"I have known both of you a long while," said Stuart, "but
these are times when you puzzle me. You are both acting like a
pair of people at the edge of a river, afraid to cross."</p>

<p>"Why damn you," said Camrose, still smiling yet slightly
stung. "You're a bit too blunt."</p>

<p>Lucy watched Stuart with closest attention, as though at this
minute she had observed something new in him. Camrose was
meanwhile embarrassed by the unfriendly strain of the scene and
gave out a quick laugh to bring things back in better humor. "If
you so highly approve of the state of matrimony, why not try it
yourself?"</p>

<p>"The idea has occurred to me," said Stuart, and began to
grin.</p>

<p>"Here, now," put in Lucy. "I should like to know about that
beforehand."</p>

<p>"To help choose the girl? George, tell this woman she can't
run both of us."</p>

<p>"Your judgment isn't very good," said Lucy. "You're
impressionable. It would be like you to marry a widow with seven
children, out of pity."</p>

<p>George Camrose found this extremely funny. He began to laugh
and kept on laughing until tears got into his eyes. Out on the
street a voice shouted and men began to run by the door toward
Howison's hay barn; and a little miner paused at the door to say,
"It is Honey Bragg and Vane Blazier." Logan Stuart walked to the
doorway and had his look down the street; then he cut back,
moving fast to the rear room. When he returned he had his
revolver tucked in his waistband and, thus armed, he left the
store. Camrose moved after him immediately; and Lucy Overmire
said, "Wait," and caught Cam-rose's arm and walked with him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER 3. &mdash; OBSCURE
MEETINGS</h2>

<p class="first">JACKSONVILLE'S idle men made a circle on the
street, drawn by the sound of trouble, drawn by the hope of
trouble; and lanterns hung high to make this drama visible to
hungry eyes. Stuart heard someone softly begging with his voice:
"Go at him Vane, he's offerin' you a fight don't refuse it." He
laid the edge of his shoulder against the ring of men and roughly
shoved a way through until he was inside the circle. In the
center of this circle stood Vane Blazier, his black hair
streaming over a hatless head, his arms down and his body
motionless as he faced Honey Bragg. Honey Bragg had already
struck, for a single furrow of blood made a track on the boy's
jaw. At the present moment Honey Bragg waited back, smiling.</p>

<p>"Boy," he said, "never crowd me."</p>

<p>"Nobody crowded you," said Blazier.</p>

<p>"You got in my way," said Honey Bragg. "You wanted a fight, I
guess."</p>

<p>"The hell I did," said Blazier. "You walked across the street
at me."</p>

<p>"Well," said Honey, his words rising and falling, "now you
call me a liar. I am going to bust you up proper, boy. I am goin'
to scar you. I'm goin' to cripple you good. I'm goin' to gouge
out your eyes and kick you in the belly till you walk straddle. I
am goin' to smash your teeth to snags and bust your nose flat, so
you'll whistle when you breathe."</p>

<p>More lanterns danced in the night, dipping and swaying in
eager hands. Vane Blazier's eyes were bitter-black, his face gray
and grown old. He stood fast because his pride would not let him
move, but his legs trembled. He was afraid yet dared not show
fear.</p>

<p>Honey Bragg saw all that too with his bright attention.
Smiling, he pulled his lips flat against his heavy teeth; the
smile was a crushed half-moon against an olive-dark skin faintly
shining with sweat. He had short hair curled against a round head
and an extremely short neck joined into huge shoulders and arms.
He was pleased with himself and his nostrils were sprung open and
he tilted his head back to study the boy in the way a man might
measure an ox for a slaughter-house sledging; the feeling of it
came out of him, the malign enjoyment was quite clear.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Vane Blazier, scarcely audible. "Let a man
alone. I didn't pick this fight."</p>

<p>"He's calling me a liar again," said Bragg. "I don't like
that, boys. You know me. You know I couldn't take that even from
a kid that don't know better. I am going to drive him around a
bit and break him up before I drop him. Give me room and I'll
show you some fun."</p>

<p>The eager miners crowded nearer, shoved up by others lately
arriving. The greasy lamplight flickered and flashed on all those
eyes so narrowly watching for the promised brutality so that
Stuart saw the lust for violence there, the greed for raw action,
the fetid stirring of jungle wants. They were good men, with
stamina and courage and kindness. Individually they were, but
they were in a pack now, and the smell of the pack was on them as
the uniform expression of the pack was on their faces, making all
faces alike&mdash;the hollow-eyed expectation, the partly opened
mouth, the tensed cheek muscles.</p>

<p>Honey Bragg had his fascinated and hostile audience in the
palm of his hand. He had no friends here, for he was a man
suspected of many things; in the heart of every onlooker was the
hope that Vane Blazier would cripple him&mdash;a hope that had no
foundation in view of his skill. Honey Bragg understood all this,
and it pleased and amused him as he stood poised for the
butchering. Vane Blazier knew it, too, and now cast a starved
glance around him, whereupon Stuart moved across the open space,
took place beside Blazier and faced Honey Bragg.</p>

<p>Honey Bragg had not been aware of Stuart's presence. This
quick change of the scene set him physically back; he had been
poised to attack, his heavy legs slightly spraddled, his round
head tipped forward and his elbows crooked. His first reaction
was to draw up his head and drop his arms; then he straightened
and the smile went off his face while he watched Stuart with a
moment's most profound attention. If it caught him off guard, it
likewise startled the crowd. The murmuring, the advice, and the
listless shifting ceased until there was no sound whatever around
the circle.</p>

<p>"A little trouble here, Vane?" asked Stuart, casually. He
dropped a hand on Blazier's shoulder and he glanced at Bragg with
a face quite heavy, quite homely.</p>

<p>"Hello, Honey," he said.</p>

<p>Honey Bragg stirred from his preoccupied silence. His grin
came back to him. "Why, Logan&mdash;how are you, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Hear you've been away."</p>

<p>Honey Bragg mentally picked the question apart through a
moment's silence; he covered the silence with his continued
cheerfulness. Presently he gave out a short laugh. "I'm here and
there," he said. "I'm a restless man, always moving."</p>

<p>"How's the horse ranch, Honey?"</p>

<p>"Fine as silk. No horses now. Ain't seen you go by the place
last few days."</p>

<p>"I've been away, too, Honey," said Stuart. "Well, you're a
restless man, like me," said Honey, repeating his brief
laugh.</p>

<p>"I notice you favoring your right leg," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"Horse bucked me off."</p>

<p>None of this talk made sense to the crowd which, hungering for
a fight, now looked on with ill-curbed attention. All these
roundabout men listened with closest interest, their glances
darting from Logan to Bragg, and back to Logan. They waited for
Logan to go on speaking, or for Honey Bragg to answer, but the
moments dragged while Stuart stood idle and wordless. Bragg's
narrow-placed eyes rolled from side to side as he cast a
speculative glance around the circle. He stared a moment at Vane
Blazier and brought his attention and its grinning brightness
once more to Stuart.</p>

<p>He covered himself well, Stuart thought; there was a full
anger in this man but, save for the fugitive shadows which chased
themselves in and out of his mouth corners, he kept his mask of
humor well in place. He would be calculating whether or not to
push the issue, he would be balancing the fight and all that it
might mean very cleverly in his head. Meanwhile Stuart said
nothing; the burden was on Honey Bragg.</p>

<p>A small flurry of motion went through the crowd which now
realized how things were going; Honey Bragg raked that circle
with a glance which quickly suppressed the discontent. Then the
smile came easily back to Honey Bragg. He said: "I'll see you
sometime, Stuart," made a turn and broke a path through the ring
with a violent use of his shoulders and arms.</p>

<p>He got to his horse and swung up, waited a moment for a pair
of men to join him&mdash;and thus he ran out of town.</p>

<p>A muffled and exasperated grumbling ran around the circle.
Somebody said, "Well, by God, it was a freeze-out." Then with a
thoroughly unsatisfactory scene irritating them, the various
miners drifted toward Jacksonville's deadfalls. Stuart said
something very quietly to Vane Blazier who turned up the
street.</p>

<p>He himself stood a short while longer on the street, listening
to the three horses of Honey Bragg's party run eastward toward
the valley, toward the ranch which Bragg operated some five miles
away; and he was thinking: "He was afraid to bring it to a head.
He's not ready."</p>

<p>"Well, Logan," said somebody, "you found out, didn't you?"</p>

<p>He turned to see Joe Harms and Jonas Over-mire&mdash;Lucy's
father&mdash;in the shadows hard by Howison's hay shed. Joe Harms
sat, as he usually did, on a bench in front of the shed, a
radical little man wearing a shabby suit, a head of thin white
hair and a white goatee on a frail chin. This bench was Joe
Harms's pulpit, on which he spent most of his day, and from which
he dispensed his acid comments on the injustices of the rich and
the ignorance of the poor. Overmire made a strange partner for
him, being a lawyer, a man of some property and considerable
education; yet the two were frequently together. Argument,
amiable or heated, was a bond between them.</p>

<p>It was Joe Harms who had spoken. Walking toward Howison's,
Stuart saw the little man in his favored position, stooped over
with his arms propped on his legs, his head thrown back to Stuart
with his sharp and dissenting glance.</p>

<p>"What did I find out, Joe?"</p>

<p>"That he'll back down."</p>

<p>"No," said Stuart, "that wasn't what I found out."</p>

<p>Joe Harms inquisitively cocked his head and waited for an
explanation that didn't come. Then he added: "You know somethin'
about him. That's why he backed down. What do you know about
him?"</p>

<p>Logan said, "You figure something out, Joe," and walked toward
his store.</p>

<p>After he had gone on beyond earshot, Over-mire murmured: "He
put the weight on Honey Bragg, and Honey broke."</p>

<p>"Honey's nerve is good as any man's. Good as Stuart's. But you
notice him stop and think, whilst he was watchin' Stuart? He
added somethin' up&mdash;and it didn't add right. So he backed
off."</p>

<p>"What would that be?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to know," said Harms. He brooded upon it awhile and
presently added in a tone that was arbitrary and wholly beyond
doubt: "Stuart's got to fight him."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Harms with his continuing certainty, "the town
won't have it any other way. The boys were promised a fight and
they didn't get it. Stuart's got to do it."</p>

<p>Camrose and Lucy were up the street and as Stuart went toward
them he thought: "He disclosed his hand in backing away. It is
well to remember." He stopped before the pair, and he observed
Lucy's face to be stained with trouble.</p>

<p>"Playing a little poker tonight?" asked Cam-rose.</p>

<p>"No," said Stuart. "I'm going out to Scotts-burg early in the
morning. Good night." He started into the store, but Lucy reached
out and took his arm and said, "Walk up the hill with us."</p>

<p>"You know," said Camrose, as they ascended the gentle grade,
"I believe you would have enjoyed a rousing battle with
Bragg."</p>

<p>"I was disappointed," admitted Logan. "But not for that
reason."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Camrose. "The town's got it right, after all."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I heard the boys talking as they came back. They thought it
was all very queer. Something under the woodpile."</p>

<p>"It will give the boys something to discuss on idle
nights."</p>

<p>"You bet it will. They'll talk you two into a fight."</p>

<p>"Don't say that," said Lucy with some sharpness.</p>

<p>They had reached the Overmire house, and Camrose turned toward
Lucy to say good night.</p>

<p>Stuart stepped aside and made it a plain business to fish out
his pipe and go through the motions of filling it. He had no wish
to witness the intimacy between them; it was their affair, in
which he had no proper part. But a renewed irritation went
through him when he heard Camrose say so calmly to her: "I shall
see you tomorrow. I have missed you."</p>

<p>"That's nice of you, Georoge," she answered, and once more
Stuart caught that balanced and faintly formal thing between
them. It was like a ceremony they had learned. He lifted his
attention from the pipe and watched George bend forward to salute
her with a brief kiss. George was smiling and his comment was
faintly malicious.</p>

<p>"Logan disapproves. I see it all over him."</p>

<p>Logan said brusquely: "You ought to do your kissing in
private, George. And you ought to do it better."</p>

<p>"Well, Logan, I shall ask you again: Can you do better?"</p>

<p>Stuart took the pipe from his mouth. An impulse rolled through
him and made him reckless and then he was smiling down at Camrose
and at Lucy. "George," he murmured, "you're making a
mistake."</p>

<p>He waited for Lucy's voice to end this nonsense, to settle it
at once by a rebuke that would send both of them away. He watched
her, expecting it, and saw that it would not come. She had not
moved. She was looking at him with her face lifted, her lips
motionless. He saw the quick rise and fall of her bosom, he saw
the moonlight whiten her throat and he came hard upon her,
drawing her toward him with one sharp gesture. Even then he
waited for her protest and was astonished that it did not come;
and he bent his head and kissed her, and despised George Camrose
at the moment. Her mouth was firm when he touched it but the
firmness dissolved before his rough handling and a warm wind
whirled through him, and he felt the lightly clinging touch of
her hands behind his shoulders. She steadied herself and did not
pull away.</p>

<p>George Camrose's idle voice came from the outer distance: "You
see, Lucy. Rough and clumsy in all that he does. There is no
skill to the man at all."</p>

<p>Stuart stepped back. He had his pipe clenched in his hand and
he had pressed it against her, and now he wondered if he had hurt
her with it. She stared at him, saying nothing at all. Suddenly
George Camrose turned down the hill with his laughter coming back
in full echo, as though he had witnessed a great joke. He was
still laughing when he reached the main street and turned east
upon it.</p>

<p>"Logan," murmured Lucy, "I guess I don't like you."</p>

<p>"I should not blame you. Good night."</p>

<p>She reached out and caught his hand. He was sweating and his
hand was damp and it embarrassed him that she should discover
this. "Wait," she said. "I don't like you when I think of you
kissing other women as you did me. Do you know what you'll lead
them to believe? Do you know what they'll expect of you?"</p>

<p>"The truth is," he said, "that you and George are both wrong.
I have had no affairs with women."</p>

<p>The information seemed to shock her. She looked keenly at him
through the darkness, she put a hand on his coat and the sharp
pressure of her fingers bit into his arm. "Logan," she whispered.
"Oh, Logan." Then she wheeled quickly and went into the
house.</p>

<p><br> <br> Camrose moved through the street's lamp-stained
shadows at a rather rapid pace, eager to have his feet under Jack
Lestrade's poker table. The scene between Stuart and Lucy had
passed out of his head as a thing which, while temporarily
amusing, had no importance. He dropped a casual nod to Overmire
and Joe Harms in front of Howison's barn, and he stopped a moment
before the Bolden &amp; Wilson Express Company's office&mdash;of
which he was local manager&mdash;to try the door's lock and to
test the solid wooden shutters which covered the windows. He had
just stepped away from the door when a miner came out of
Blacker's deadfall across the street's dusty surface, saw him,
and came quickly over. "Looking for you," said the miner. "Be all
right if you open the safe and let me have the dust I stored with
you?"</p>

<p>It was Johnny Steele who had prospected along the Applegate,
had left a well-filled poke at the express office for
safekeeping, and had announced he would be gone on a trip for a
couple of months. Camrose thought, "What the hell brings him back
so soon?" and his mind ran rapidly from one excuse to another.
Steele saw his hesitation and was somewhat apologetic.</p>

<p>"I realize it is a nuisance at this hour. But I've got some
poker to play tonight."</p>

<p>Camrose made a show of agreeableness. "That's all right," he
said, and reached for his keys. When he got inside the dark
office he lighted a lamp and turned back to Steele. "I'll have to
ask you to stay outside while I open this thing. You understand
it's a company rule."</p>

<p>"Sure, sure," said Steele and backed from the office.</p>

<p>Camrose locked the door and moved around the counter to the
massive safe with its gilded eagles. He crouched down and rapidly
twirled the knob, a tighter expression now on his face. When he
got the doors open he glanced at the window shutters to reassure
himself that they kept out curious eyes, and he rummaged through
a heavy layer of buckskin gold pokes&mdash;each with its owner's
name and the amount of dust it contained attached to
it&mdash;until he found Steele's. He looked at the tag and rose
to lay the poke on the gold scales. "Eight ounces," he said to
himself in a toneless murmur.</p>

<p>He looked again into the safe, his mind spurred to
extraordinary swiftness by a faint sense of desperation. He
thought: "Jackson, no. Bellemyer, Stroud, McIver." McIver.
Perhaps. McIver was away down at Kerbytown and probably wouldn't
be back for a month. He took up Mclver's pouch, opened it, and
was careful to sift out upon the scales only the fine gold. This
he transferred to Steele's poke until he was within two ounces of
the required weight; then he found a small envelope of
particular-shaped nuggets which, in originally borrowing from
Steele's poke, he had taken care to remove and save. Now he
replaced them at the top of the poke, weighed it again, spilled
in a small quantity of additional dust to make the weight
correspond with the tag, and cinched it.</p>

<p>Having returned McIver's poke to the safe, he went over to let
in Steele. "There you are," he said, and pointed to the miner's
poke still lying on the scales.</p>

<p>Steele gave the scales and the tag a casual glance. "Thanks
for the trouble," he said, and opened the drawstrings to have a
look at the top nuggets; he picked out one with thumb and
forefinger. "See that? I remember where I found it. Damnedest
thing. It was inside an old Indian skull. Well, I'm obliged. Owe
you something?"</p>

<p>"No," said Camrose, "glad to do you the favor," and watched
Steele replace the nugget.</p>

<p>Steele's head was bowed over the poke for a moment, and Steele
seemed thoughtful, and a smallest expression of puzzlement came
to him. Then he cinched up the poke and left the office.</p>

<p>Camrose closed and locked the safe and stood for a moment with
his arms on the counter, his face somewhat flushed and
preoccupied. He thought: "What did he see that bothered him? What
did I do wrong?" A slow fear moved small and distant somewhere
within him. Presently he extinguished the light and left the
office, locking the door behind him, and continued toward
Lestrade's.</p>

<p>Lestrade's cabin was a few hundred yards beyond the
settlement, built in a shallow canyon and surrounded by pine
timber. When Camrose got to the place he found Neil Howison, Dr.
Balance and Lestrade already seated at a poker game. Since they
were all old acquaintances who met here almost nightly, there was
nothing much to be said by way of greeting. Camrose simply sat
down in a chair, received chips and cards, and began to play.</p>

<p>"Where's Logan?" asked Neil Howison.</p>

<p>"Probably asleep. He's going out tomorrow to Scottsburg."</p>

<p>"Always on the move," commented Howison. "I guess I haven't
got the energy he's got."</p>

<p>There was a small fire on the fireplace hearth and a pot of
coffee suspended from the crane. Mrs. Lestrade sat by the blaze
and from his place at the table Camrose watched the flame color
her face and increase the mystery he always found upon it. She
was, he thought, far too beautiful and polished a woman for these
rough parts; she was meant for gentler places and she had come
out of far pleasanter surroundings. Faithfully she had followed
her husband in his search for health, silently enduring his
strange tempers.</p>

<p>"Energy," said Lestrade in a half-mocking voice. "Well, I envy
any man the possession of it."</p>

<p>He sat back, the room's heat lightly flushing normally
colorless cheeks. He wore a jaded and disillusioned air, as
though he understood the world pretty well and had little use for
it. His face was of the brittle, narrow and handsome sort and he
never failed to keep himself in the best of clothes. Apparently
he had money and apparently excellent connections somewhere. His
interest in life had pretty well narrowed itself down to a search
for health.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said, "that Logan and Honey Bragg were
pretty close to a fight."</p>

<p>"Bragg backed down," said Howison. Lestrade showed a tinge of
interest. "Never heard of him doing that before."</p>

<p>"I don't understand Logan's interference," said Howison. "He's
been around here long enough not to step into another man's
quarrel."</p>

<p>Dr. Balance, older than the rest of them, reached for the
whisky bottle and poured himself a comfortable jot. Always a busy
man, he came here to relax his middle-aged bones, to hide out for
a short while from the incessant calls upon him; he had white
hair, a well-larded figure and a pair of eyes which had a good
deal of power. "It may be," said he in a dry manner, "that he
disliked seeing young Blazier slaughtered. The rest of you, being
intent on a Roman holiday, perhaps did not consider that point of
view."</p>

<p>Howison made his frank admission. "I don't know of anyone
around here who cares to meet Bragg. It would be a grisly
business."</p>

<p>"A comment on this town," said Balance, "that Stuart should be
the only one."</p>

<p>Howison shook his head. "It was an odd approach. I don't
recall Logan made any challenge. It was softly done, by George it
was. Then it was entirely up to Bragg. I got the distinct feeling
there was considerably more to it than what we saw."</p>

<p>Lestrade lifted his head, now definitely interested. "What
would that be?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Howison.</p>

<p>They played on in this manner, sometimes talking, sometimes
silent. Later Lestrade came back to the subject, speaking to
Camrose. "Better tell Logan to walk softly with Honey Bragg."</p>

<p>Camrose said: "Let Honey Bragg walk softly."</p>

<p>"Bragg's a sort of friend of mine. You can't fight white man's
style against a damned beast. I shouldn't like to see Logan
crippled."</p>

<p>"You've got some queer friends," suggested Dr. Balance.</p>

<p>Lestrade said amiably: "I did not say I liked him, or trusted
him, or would defend him. I only said he was a friend."</p>

<p>"Good God," said Camrose, "what's your definition of a
friend?"</p>

<p>"Any man, I suppose, whose character lends support to my
belief that the human race is a great mistake." He was seized
with a fit of coughing and bent forward in the chair, his face
coloring from the effort. Dr. Balance observed him
professionally, but said nothing. Lestrade murmured: "It is
always cold and damp. Is there no heat anywhere in the
world?"</p>

<p>"You ought to live in the Southwest," said Camrose. He watched
Marta Lestrade rise from her chair, turn around the room and
pause in a corner. Her hair was silk-fine and as black as the
blackest thing in nature; her features in repose were clear and
settled and sad. The sadness, he had observed, was a constant
thing, tinging every other expression her face revealed. Her eyes
touched him and he thought&mdash;as he had thought
before&mdash;that beneath her faithfulness a great fire
burned.</p>

<p>"Why run from pillar to post?" said Lestrade. "The day of
ending comes soon enough. It might as well come here as
elsewhere."</p>

<p>Boots trotted through the night and a fist struck the door,
and the door opened to show a miner. "Balance," he said. "There
was a cave-in up at Happy Camp. We brought a man in. He's got a
crushed chest."</p>

<p>"I'll be there. Go back and get his shirt off."</p>

<p>The miner went away at the same time gait while Balance cashed
in his chips. "Marta," he said, "could I have some coffee?"</p>

<p>"You're cool about it," observed Lestrade. "And in no
hurry."</p>

<p>The doctor stood up and accepted the coffee. He made a bow to
Mrs. Lestrade and sipped at the drink gingerly. "No, I'm not in a
hurry. I work long, but I keep a pace. Otherwise I would die. As
for the man, if his chest is really crushed there is no need to
hurry. I can do little for him. And of course I am cool. Only a
fool would get excited." He put the cup down, smiling away the
rebuke he now proceeded to give Lestrade. "But although I may be
cool, Jack, I am not cynical. If I were an amateur philosopher
with time idle on my hands, as you have, I might afford that
luxury."</p>

<p>"Why, damn you," said Lestrade with good-natured venom. "Do
you mean to say, after all your experience with the sweaty, dirty
carcasses of people, their dumb brute follies, their
superstitions and ignorances and crooked cheap passions, that you
still regard them with any degree of pity or sympathy?"</p>

<p>The doctor's tongue could be sharp when he chose to make it;
he made it so now. "You're no realist. You're a dabbler. I know
more about people in a minute than you do all year. I know what
they're made of and I know what they can do when their resources
are strained. I do more than pity them. I respect them." Having
said it, he calmly continued sipping his coffee.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Lestrade, with an impatient wave of his hand.</p>

<p>Camrose said: "Death comes sooner if a man gives up. I think
you've already made your surrender."</p>

<p>Lestrade stared at him. "You're no better than I am for
sympathy. Mostly you are out for George Camrose. You do not waste
energy in any other direction."</p>

<p>Camrose smiled. "You may be right. I presume it is fortune we
are all after. So then it becomes a matter of how it shall be
soonest reached."</p>

<p>Marta Lestrade watched him as he talked. He was conscious of
the force of her dark, wary eyes. Lestrade likewise studied him
with considerable calculation. "It is a series of figures nicely
lined up in your ledger. I wish you luck. It is a brutal world. A
world meant for fighting and survival. The Christian virtues are
for the meek and mild&mdash;to console them in their
failures."</p>

<p>"There is a tide," said Camrose, "and the thing is to go with
the tide."</p>

<p>"Do not float on this tide too long," warned Lestrade. "The
first two years of any mining camp are always the best. After
that the slack sets in." He put his arms negligently over the
back of his chair. "You are the complete opposite of your friend
Stuart."</p>

<p>"He requires different things of this world."</p>

<p>"What does he require?" asked Lestrade.</p>

<p>"A good fight, a good laugh, a good run. He has the common
touch. Most people will love him where they will care little for
the likes of you or me. Perhaps it is his vitality."</p>

<p>"A pretty sermon," commented Lestrade and rose from his chair.
"Pretty enough to put me to bed. But, remember, fortunes are not
made on sentiment. Fortunes are made by rude and rough ways.
Fortunes are seized, and when you close your hands upon them, you
must necessarily smash something else, and somebody else."</p>

<p>"I have dwelt even upon that somewhat," murmured Camrose,
still smiling.</p>

<p>Lestrade stood at the doorway of the cabin's second room,
seemingly frail in the lamplight, yet humorously contemptuous of
frailty. "You have dwelt on many things, apparently."</p>

<p>Howison got up from the table. "It is a dull conversation. The
both of you are worrying a dead rabbit around the floor."</p>

<p>"Certaintly they are," said Dr. Balance and laid down his
empty cup.</p>

<p>"I'll walk to the camp with you, Doc," said Howison. "I'm of
poor sorts tonight."</p>

<p>"What's your trouble?" asked Balance.</p>

<p>"I sent Bill Brown as express to Yreka tonight, carrying
considerable gold. I'll feel better when I know he has gotten
safely through."</p>

<p>Balance stood a moment, watching Lestrade and Camrose with his
dissecting attention; it was as if he had seen symptoms of a sort
about these men and now took the time to hunt down causes.
Presently his lips folded together and with a nod at the room he
turned out of the place with Howison.</p>

<p>Lestrade, posed at the edge of the cabin's adjoining room,
smiled faintly at Camrose. "The doctor does not like us tonight,"
he observed. He made a graceful flourish of his hand toward his
wife, said, "Entertain our guest, Marta," and closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lestrade placed her back to the fire and drew both hands
behind her, the effect of which was to pull her body straight and
slim within her dress. She looked across to him and he thought he
observed once more the suppressed rebellion within her. "Do you
believe all the strange things you've been saying?" she said.</p>

<p>"As between men I do," he said. He rose and walked toward her,
excited by her. "As for a man and a woman..."</p>

<p>He was not certain of himself, or of her. He paused, on the
edge of daring, on the verge of adventure. She seemed to be
waiting for him to continue; her silence pushed him forward as
much as anything else. He turned back and got his hat and said,
"I shall be going." Then he came before her again and struggled
with the notion of seizing her and kissing her. It occurred to
him she must be seeing that impulse in him, but if she saw it she
made no attempt to restrain him. He held himself tightly
together, his voice dropped low. "Who knows what happens between
a man and a woman? It can't be explained. Good night."</p>

<p>He swung and left the house. Mrs. Lestrade moved around the
room, picking up the dishes on the table. The inner door opened
and Les-trade appeared there, watching his wife with an odd
critical glance. "Gone already?"</p>

<p>"Had you expected him to stay?"</p>

<p>He had become a harder man, merely by his passage in and out
of the other room. There was a sharpness on him now to replace
his former weary invalid's manner. He took his hat from its wall
nail and moved to the door, Marta's glance following him. She
said: "To Bragg's?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Marta&mdash;be nice to Cam-rose."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked. "So that he will keep coming here to lose
more money?"</p>

<p>He searched her face and weighed her darkly reserved manner.
It amused him to say: "When I am dead he might make you an
excellent marriage."</p>

<p>"At least," she answered, "it would be a marriage."</p>

<p>Balance and Howison walked in complete silence all the way to
the middle of town, at which point the doctor turned toward his
office. Howison called after him: "See you tomorrow night for
another game."</p>

<p>Balance paused and turned about and shook his head. It
occurred to Howison that the doctor carried something in his head
which he had not meant to speak of, and it was clear that he
overcame some doubts in order to say what he at last did say.
"No, Neil. Not tomorrow night. Nor the night after&mdash;or any
other night."</p>

<p>"Quitting poker?"</p>

<p>"At that place, yes. I would advise you to do the same."</p>

<p>"The conversation bored me, too, Doc. But it was a passing
thing."</p>

<p>"Neil," said Balance, "I should like to tell you something.
Our friend does not have consumption."</p>

<p>"What is it, then?" asked Howison.</p>

<p>"That is the point. He by no means is an invalid."</p>

<p>Howison had the extreme desire to question the doctor further,
but before he could do so Balance swung and moved on to his
office.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER 4. &mdash; THE SECOND
WOMAN</h2>

<p class="first">THE least variable habit of Logan Stuart's life
was his hour of rising&mdash;which was at four-thirty. For a man
who was scarcely methodical in any particular, this set rule was
more or less a way of demonstrating to himself that he could
follow discipline if he chose. In only one other particular did
he deliberately test his own will: during one month of the year,
and always in February, he quit smoking.</p>

<p>On this morning he shaved and cooked his breakfast while the
town still slept, and afterwards walked through the store's
pungent shadows to open the front door. A thin night-chilled air
came against him with its dry and sweet and winey odors, and day
moved in broadening bands out of the east and the first echoes of
the waking town were magnified by the hour's intense stillness,
the hollow impact of an axe on its chopping block, a metal stove
door slamming, a man's spongy coughing. Smoke rose straight from
chimney tops; the tarnished silver dust of the street showed a
thousand agitated prints of the previous night's liveliness, and
a man lay asleep in this dust with no protection at all save for
the furry hide of a dog who lay against him. Looking at him for a
curious moment, Stuart identified the sleeper as John Steele.</p>

<p>Under the roofs of this town men slept with their common
dreams and wakened and walked abroad with a common hunger and a
common crankiness, and felt the same morning hopes stir through
them and were lifted by some kind of ambition. Some were brave
and some were scoundrels and some were smart and some were fools,
and all of them reached a level largely of their own making. They
were equal only in that they came of the same clay and would
dissolve to the same dust; yet at this hour he felt his closeness
to them, knowing that he was whatever they were.</p>

<p>He turned back into the store and sat up to Henry
Clenchfield's desk, and he lighted his pipe and began his chore
of going through the bills, the accounts and the ledgers of his
freighting and mercantile business which was a thing scattered
throughout Oregon's southern half the money owed and the money
due, the pack outfits scattered along one trail or another, the
goods oversupplied and the goods needed, the hay and oats in the
barn, repair bills, the gold dust received for shipment and the
credits therefor made. He bowed his shoulders and went through
all of this. He had the sharpest kind of memory for details; he
knew the characteristics of each mule in his service and the load
it could carry, he knew all the roundabout trails, the fordable
river crossings and the kind of bottom each ford possessed; he
always knew where grass and water were best for a camp.</p>

<p>Stuart &amp; Company had begun from two mules carrying a stove
up the Applegate; now as Clenchfield had mentioned, it had a
hundred thousand dollars in stock and equipment. It was a
personal venture, and everything was in the venturing, and very
little in the having. The town now was fully awake and the sun
arisen. Down the street he heard Vane Blazier swearing the
Scottsburg pack outfit together. Clenchfield came in, shaved and
neat and sour.</p>

<p>"I expect," said Stuart, "it will be the <i>William Tell</i>
arrived and unloading at Scottsburg. What can we use?"</p>

<p>"No hardware. Get gingham, soap, wool cloth if they've got
any. Woman's stuff. But don't overbuy. You always overbuy."</p>

<p>"We always oversell."</p>

<p>"There's an end to that, soon or late."</p>

<p>This was the old argument which never had a conclusion. It was
ended this morning by John Steele who had risen from the dust
with his torn and gritty clothes. Steele was of Stuart's age, a
normally cheerful and sensible young man; but he had come into
Jacksonville with a month of lonely prospecting behind
him&mdash;and he had had his fun. He stood in low spirits before
Stuart, his face scratched from fighting and his eyes bloodshot.
He managed a small and wan smile.</p>

<p>"I must have had a hell of a good time. Don't remember a thing
about it, though. Shouldn't a man have a few memories for a
thousand-dollar bust?"</p>

<p>"You were honey bait for the bears," commented Stuart. "I'm a
little surprised. You know these deadfalls, Johnny."</p>

<p>"Sure I do," agreed Johnny. "Still, when a man works like a
horse for a year and then one day asks himself why he's working,
and gets no answer, it is a disturbing thing. So I thought I'd
loosen up, and maybe I'd find out why I was working."</p>

<p>"Did you find out?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Johnny, "I did. But I wish I hadn't. Now, I'm
going to buy out Billy Clay-ford's claim on the creek. I'd like a
stake for it, Logan. Five hundred dollars. Think I can pay it
back ounce a day."</p>

<p>"Henry," said Stuart, "put Johnny Steele down for five
hundred."</p>

<p>Clenchfield said, "Ah," and managed to put into the single
expression his complete disgust; he moved on out of the
building.</p>

<p>"You got a Scotchman there," said Steele. "Thanks, Logan." He
plunged his hands into his trouser pockets and suddenly brought
one hand out with a small nugget. "Well," he murmured with mild
surprise, "not clean busted," and stared at the nugget. It seemed
to remind him of the previous night and gradually his lids crept
across his eyes until they were half covered. "Logan," he said,
"how long does it take to open a safe?"</p>

<p>"Half a minute&mdash;mine at least."</p>

<p>"Ten minutes would be pretty long wouldn't it?" commented
Steele, and left the office.</p>

<p>Stuart took up his pipe after Steele left and thoughtfully
repacked it and lighted it. He thought, "What safe? Camrose's?"
and slowly shook his head. He rose and moved around the counter
and went into his quarters to catch up his saddlebags and his
rifle; when he came back into the big room he found Clenchfield
returned.</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars," said Henry. "At no interest. If you
have got to loan, make it at a profit."</p>

<p>"Henry," said Stuart, "we're making money, are we not?"</p>

<p>"It is no argument. You've not got a hard head."</p>

<p>"Always let the other man make some money, too. Never try to
get it all for yourself. I'll be back in ten days."</p>

<p>He went out in a fine frame of mind; the day was good and the
prospect of being in the saddle pleased him greatly. Vane Blazier
and Zack Murrow were even then lining the pack mules through
town, the bell mare plodding wisely at the head of the
procession. He moved on to his barn and saddled the red gelding;
he was ready to lead it out when Neil Howison came in and looked
carefully around the barn, obviously wanting privacy. Howison
looked extraordinarily depressed.</p>

<p>"Logan," he said, "Bill Brown was held up last night near the
Mountain House."</p>

<p>"How much are you out?"</p>

<p>"He was carrying twenty-five hundred dust."</p>

<p>"You want help, Neil?"</p>

<p>"No, I can stand the loss. But listen. Either the road agents
are simply waiting for whoever came along, or they found out what
Bill was carrying and were waiting for him in particular."</p>

<p>"How could they know? You tell anybody?"</p>

<p>"I mentioned it in only one place&mdash;last night at the
poker game. There were just four people. Balance, Lestrade and
his wife, and Camrose. If I cannot trust them, who shall I
trust?"</p>

<p>The light of the barn was quite dull and Logan Stuart had
lowered his head against the gelding to give the latigo a last
pull. He finished the chore and turned to meet Howison's
searching glance. Howison wanted an opinion from him; when he
failed to speak, Howison's face slightly hardened. "Who can I
trust then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"Balance told me last night he proposed not to play cards at
Lestrade's in the future and suggested I follow suit. What's up,
Logan?"</p>

<p>Stuart freshened the light of his pipe and for a moment
Howison caught the expression on the man's face; it was something
like the look he had showed Honey Bragg the night before,
watchful but deliberately bare. "For twenty-five hundred dollars,
Neil, I guess you're entitled to suspect anybody you choose."</p>

<p>"Balance also said Lestrade did not have consumption&mdash;and
was scarcely an invalid."</p>

<p>"So?" said Logan.</p>

<p>Observing this lack of surprise, Howison suddenly grumbled:
"Am I the only blind one around here?" He saw that he would get
no additional information from Stuart, and added: "I propose to
send Bill Brown out again, as a decoy, with no great quantity of
dust on him. I propose to tell one less person in that group each
time, until I narrow the thing down to one man."</p>

<p>"A good idea."</p>

<p>"Suppose it turns out to be the wrong man?"</p>

<p>Stuart walked the gelding from the barn and stepped into the
saddle. He settled his hatbrim against the sharp sun streaming
low from the east and he stared at the distant rim of the
mountains. "If you find the wrong man, Neil, that man is
nevertheless a thief."</p>

<p>"Disagreeable business."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stuart. "For your information, I gave up poker at
Lestrade's last week." He turned after the pack outfit which,
having crossed the flat part of town, now rose along the side of
a ridge and curled gradually around it to the northeast.</p>

<p><br> <br> Leaving Jacksonville, the trail cut over the point
of the foothills which bordered the valley's flatness. Out on
that flatness stood Table Rock with its spectacular level top
and, in the foreground, the rectangle of Fort Lane. From the fort
the valley broke into lesser fingerlike valleys which in turn
were at last absorbed by the heavy mass of the Cascades. Here and
there in the visible distance the log but of a settler sat lonely
and small.</p>

<p>They crossed the Rogue ferry and followed the trail through
willow, pine and oak as it ran smooth and ran rough and all along
this way the three men&mdash;Stuart, Blazier and Murrow kept
sharp lookout; for this was on the reservation which, empty as it
seemed, contained the mercurial Rogues, whose motives were never
known. In the middle of the afternoon the pack outfit paused at
Dance's, where Caroline poured buttermilk out of an old Wedgwood
jug and looked on at Stuart with her thoughtful smile, while he
drank.</p>

<p>"Scottsburg?" she said. "You travel a lot, Logan."</p>

<p>"Caroline," he said, "when will you be twenty?"</p>

<p>She looked at him with an attempt to read the reason for his
asking. Behind her calm manner a liveliness had its sudden way
and her lips mirrored the change. "I am already twenty," she
said.</p>

<p>He said, "Mighty old," and stepped up to his saddle while
Blazier and Murrow lined out the mules.</p>

<p>She was accustomed to his mild teasing; she had usually a
steady sort of smile for it, and sometimes a distant gaiety of
her own to match his manner. But she was essentially a sober girl
and this was a sober subject with her. "Why yes," she said, "I
have been old for three years almost. It is a pity. I shall be
late starting my family."</p>

<p>He folded his hands on the saddle horn. "Why, Caroline, you
have got plenty of choice in the valley. I can think of twelve
men, offhand."</p>

<p>"So can I," she agreed, "but it isn't a thing where you count
eeny-meeny-miny-mo, is it?" Her eyes were a powdery gray; they
regarded him with a firm attention, to see if he was laughing at
her, and once again some inner excitement showed its brisk motion
in them. "You go on, Logan," she murmured. "The day's wasting and
I've got butter to make."</p>

<p>She stood before the house with her hands across her apron and
watched him depart; and when he turned, just before entering that
belt of dark timber which marked the beginning of the trail's
laborious passage of the Umpqua Mountains, he turned and waved
back to her and her own hand lifted in answer&mdash;not rapidly
but with a certain hesitation, as though she were not sure she
ought to do it. Her father saw this from another part of the yard
and now moved over to her.</p>

<p>"Caroline," he said, "you like him?"</p>

<p>"I guess I do," she said, most calmly.</p>

<p>Dance scrubbed a hand across his whiskered cheeks and studied
his daughter with a desire to give her proper advice; it was a
hard thing to do with a girl who had grown into a woman too
young, who was as mature as his own wife.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he said, "if you want to catch a man you have
got to work at it."</p>

<p>She still watched the trees into which the pack outfit had
gone, and from which the bell of the lead mare sent its musical
and diminishing sound. "I'd want no man I had to catch," she
said.</p>

<p>"Why, sure," he agreed. "You catch him and he catches you. But
you got to do your share. A man always figures he does the
catchin', but the truth of the matter is it is the woman who
brings him up on the rope, him not quite knowin' it."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a solemn interest. "Is that the way you
got Mother?"</p>

<p>"I fought for your mother," he said at once. Then he saw the
contradiction and gave out a cheerful laugh. "But your mother
give me sign enough to go ahead and fight. You got to give a man
the sign."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's so," she said. Behind the composed expression, a
little-girl eagerness vaguely stirred and vaguely displayed
itself.</p>

<p><br> <br> Four and a half days out of Jacksonville, Stuart's
pack train reached the Umpqua's head of navigation. The river,
searching for the sea, had here cut a notch through the Coast
Range and had left only a narrow strip of meadow between mountain
and water. On this cramped flat spot was Scottsburg, its cluster
of houses sprung up on the strength of the pack-train trade. The
ship <i>William Tell</i> lay by the bank with a gangplank thrown
over to the back doorway of Poole &amp; Hutchinson's store.</p>

<p>Stuart made his purchase from the ship's stock, loaded his
pack mules and started on the return trip. All the way from
Jacksonville Johnny Steele's remark concerning the Camrose safe
had been on his mind; and now, homeward bound, he came to grips
with an issue he had long refused to meet.</p>

<p>In this country most men were rough and plain and direct since
they could be little else. George, alone of his friends, held to
his polish, his light cynicism, his complexity of character.
George always walked Jacksonville's streets with the manner of a
man strolling along the city park on a pleasant Sunday afternoon.
It seemed necessary to him to be a little gay, a little sardonic,
yet never to reveal his full emotions; and in fact he never
presented himself fully to anybody. Still, under it all, there
was a charm to the man which laid its bonds upon those he chose
to like.</p>

<p>Friendship was an entire thing, or else it was nothing;
therefore it made Stuart uneasy to be looking into George Camrose
as critically as he now was. What lay behind that
charm&mdash;substance or weakness? Was the man's laughter
something human and generous, or a shallow echo out of a mind
that had no strong faith? And what was that indifference which
always guided George Camrose's words and manner even in those
scenes, as before Lucy, when the sight of her and of all that she
meant should have swept aside the conventional mannerisms of his
life? If he could not be roused then, what was there in him to be
roused?</p>

<p>These were the questions he asked as the pack train steadily
footed its way down the trail, made camp, and went on again.
Silent in the saddle, he added up the little stories which had
singly come to him concerning Camrose, the stray suspicion which
Johnny Steele had dropped, the losses at poker which he knew
Camrose had sustained, his friendship for Lestrade who was, as
Balance had said, not the sick man he pretended to be. By night,
squatted before the campfire, he nursed his pipe and pried away
at Camrose with his questions; wrapped in his blanket, he watched
the starshine and came slowly to his conclusion. It was not
possible to judge a man completely, it was never certain what lay
real and unchangeable at the farthest corner of a human heart; as
for George Camrose, there was some weakness in him but since Lucy
loved him, there must be worth in him other eyes could not wholly
see. In any event Lucy had taken him and that was the end of the
story.</p>

<p>He grew more and more silent until at last he scarcely heard
the few words Vane Blazier spoke to him during the day. If a man
had the picture of a woman in his mind, and heard through all the
hours of the day the tone of her voice, and caught the fragrance
of her at any odd time in any odd place, why shouldn't he fight
for her? What was George Camrose's indifference before his own
never still desire for Lucy? He remembered Camrose's idle
amusement as he, Stuart, had kissed Lucy and had stepped back to
hate George for that foolish humor and now he wondered what
Camrose's depth could be, to remain unmoved at such a sight.</p>

<p>All the way to Canyonville he was thus wrapped around.
Suddenly, as they started through the mountains, he was through
with speculation and he knew what his part was; it was what it
had been before. Now he began to talk, and to be cheerful. Zack
Murrow and Vane Blazier both looked at him with considerable
surprise. "What's been eatin' you?" asked Blazier.</p>

<p>"The next forty years," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"Why," said Blazier, "a man can't look that far ahead."</p>

<p>"Not as far off as you think."</p>

<p><br> <br> The canyon passage was quiet, with young Lieutenant
Bristow and his twenty dragoons camped in boredom at Wolf Creek.
"Peaceful," he said. "You who knows about these people? I feel
them somewhere in the timber, watching. They are a brooding
race." By twilight of the fourth night the pack train halted at
Dance's and Stuart and Blazier and Murrow took their ease at the
supper table. The three Dance boys, wild and shy, ate without
speech and rose and silently departed into the shadows. Dance sat
back to enjoy himself with his pipe. Mrs. Dance and Caroline were
at the supper dishes.</p>

<p>"The lieutenant," said Stuart, "doesn't know what to make of
the quiet spell."</p>

<p>"He's just ridin' back and forth, makin' the trail broader,"
said Dance. "The Rogues can hear him for miles. It's a way of
passin' the time, I suppose, but if trouble starts he'll get
himself bushwacked first off. He don't know Indian style."</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell him?"</p>

<p>"He's got a little brown book. If it don't come out of the
book, it ain't true."</p>

<p>Murrow rose and departed to his blankets outside the house.
Van Blazier, following suit, stopped at the doorway to look in
Caroline's direction. Interest held him there even though shyness
kept him silent. He watched her as she moved around the room and
presently, when she became aware of his interest and looked to
him, he flushed and left the room. Dance, observing it, gave his
daughter a sly grin; she returned to her chores.</p>

<p>"Ben," said Stuart, "you're ten miles from a neighbor, and
right in the track of trouble if it breaks."</p>

<p>"Why," said Dance, "I have got a stout house if they strike,
and I have got three sons who will know by morning if an Indian
has been within two miles of this place. Mark me, I put no trust
in the peace treaty with 'em. It was their land we're on and they
don't forget it. When they come here and talk easy, I know what's
behind their eyes&mdash;it's ordinary hate. But we got strength
and they can't beat us unless they do it by plain surprise. They
know that and they'll remain still&mdash;unless a medicine man
stirs 'em up, or unless some white man commits a murder that
starts them off."</p>

<p>"Both possible."</p>

<p>"We are sitting on a powder keg," said Dance, and found
nothing in the foreboding statement to disturb his comfort. "If
they struck quick they could wipe out every settler between Evans
Creek and Anslem's."</p>

<p>"You'll know it beforehand," said Stuart. "They'll start
moving around. They'll get bolder when they ask for food. They'll
get insolent. That's the time for you to fort up."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dance, having finished her work, now quietly moved into
the bedroom. The curtains sang sharply on the wire when she
closed them, drawing Dance's attention. He said, "This is my fort
and damned if I budge," and then he sat still a moment, fingers
pulling at his beard. Presently he rose with a great yawn and
moved over the puncheon floor in his moccasins, dropped a covert
grin to his daughter, and vanished behind the curtains. There was
always a little deviltry in this man and it now made him say
loudly to his wife: "Anna, even the chickens ain't gone to roost
yet."</p>

<p>His wife's calm voice had a good enough retort. "You've got
more mind than chicken, I do trust."</p>

<p>Caroline swept the floor and stood a moment in the center of
the room, considering what had been done and what was to be done.
She laid out that next day in her mind so that when it came she
would rise early and be at her work without the need of stopping
to plan. Presently she removed her apron, with a lighter humor
replacing the fixed graveness of her cheeks. She took a round
reed basket from a shelf, it containing torn stockings and
darning thread, and sat down in the rocker. When she had gotten
well at this chore she paused a moment and lifted her head to
look at Stuart with a glance that he was wholly unable to make
out.</p>

<p>He knew her to be the calmest of girls, always disposed to
take the practical view of things; he knew her to have her own
will, and a great deal of self-confidence. Beyond this, he was
not certain. She was mature in so many ways; yet now and again
when he saw the graveness leave her face, and the sparkle of
little-girl excitement come to her eyes, he wondered where
youngness ended and maturity began. Sometimes it seemed to him
her quietness contained the sharpest kind of wisdom, but at other
times he thought the quietness might hide a great deal of wonder
and a great deal of soft, warm dreaming. She was to him a
frequent contradiction.</p>

<p>"Logan," she said, "do you really think the Indians will break
out?"</p>

<p>"Always possible. They've caused trouble each year so
far."</p>

<p>"It will be nice, someday, when we don't have to worry about
that any more."</p>

<p>"Someday there'll be town all along the valley."</p>

<p>"Now that," she said, "I'm certain I'd not like. This is best,
the way it is."</p>

<p>She usually liked things to be as they had been. It was a
strong, conservative streak in her. She suspected change and was
made uncomfortable by it. He let the silence continue while he
pulled at his pipe and kept her close in his mind. If she married
him, she would follow him, for that was in her nature; yet would
she like the kind of life he gave her? Would she ever discover
that though he might bring her much, one thing would be
missing?</p>

<p>She had meanwhile gone on with her darning, the heat of the
room coloring her cheeks. She was prettier, he thought, than he
had before noticed her to be; she was sweeter, her features
warmer and more expressive. Suddenly she stopped her knitting and
looked up to him and he saw once again that trace of fugitive
excitement play across her face.</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't like it. This is a nice place. My father built
it and I want to live in it. I'd like all my children to grow up
here. When they get old enough I want them&mdash;if they are
boys&mdash;to take land near by. If they are girls I want them to
marry neighbors and not move off. It isn't good for people to
always move and be torn up. I like to get up early and watch the
sun come over the mountain. I like to watch the mist lie on the
meadow at night. I like to hear people, away off&mdash;their
voices coming ahead of them when it is quiet. When I am dead, I'd
like to know my children stand where I stood and see the same
things."</p>

<p>"The man you get," he said, "might not want to stay here."</p>

<p>She lowered her head to the darning. "I know," she murmured.
"But at least it is good to think of, if it is never anything
more than that."</p>

<p>"Make you unhappy to move away?"</p>

<p>She went on darning for a short while, thinking carefully of
it. Then she said, quietly, "No, not unhappy. My grandmother
moved and my mother moved. I can make a new home as well as they.
Only, I would hate to move too much. It would be hard to be
always fixing a new cabin or starting a new garden."</p>

<p>Her mind went at once to these things, solid and permanent and
useful. He knew as much about her then as he thought he would
ever know, the next moment he knew less, for she said something
that puzzled him.</p>

<p>"I miss my grandmother. She was such a smiling woman. I always
liked to watch her sit and rest. Her hands were pretty and her
face was so smooth. She had twelve children and they all grew up
and they all went away and now she's alone in Kentucky. I feel so
sad for her being alone. People ought to be close. Families
should stay together. It would be a delight to sit down to
Christmas dinner with everybody there. I remember Mother saying
the Boyd family, back East, once had eighty-three to
Thanksgiving. It must have made all of them feel good."</p>

<p>The little things, he thought, were close to her; the little
things were big to her and she made her world out of them. He
rose and tapped the ashes of his pipe into the stove and refilled
it and sat down again. She had ceased to work. She sat still,
directly watching him, and he thought she wanted to say something
to him. It was a clear and bright urge in her eyes; it made all
her face hopeful. This was Caroline, as much of her as she cared
to let anybody see.</p>

<p>"What, Caroline?"</p>

<p>She said, "Do you like Jacksonville?" It was not the thing she
had meant to say, he realized. "It is a place to do business in,"
he said.</p>

<p>She resumed her knitting, and spoke again. "You're not a
religious man."</p>

<p>"I don't get to church much, maybe I should."</p>

<p>"When it's handy," she said, "you should. Not that I'd care
for an extra-religious man. They all look so dry and hungry."</p>

<p>He sat back in the chair and quietly laughed. Her glance came
up to him, pleased that he was pleased. Afterwards, in the still
idle voice, she went on: "Are you very thrifty? Folks say you
make money but don't keep it."</p>

<p>"I don't pay much attention," he said.</p>

<p>"Men are not much in that habit," she said, as though meaning
to excuse him. "But you are restless. Everybody says so."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I guess I must be."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is easy to be that way if you have nothing much
to do at home but bach." Now, still with her head lowered, she
added an irrelevant question. "When is Lucy to marry George
Camrose?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I don't think I'd want him," she said and looked up at him
with a rather quick swing of her head. It was then that he felt
his uncertainty rise again. He smiled at her, saying,
"Everybody's got a taste of some sort," and at the same time he
wondered what things stirred behind her simplicity. Forty years
lay right here at this moment. How was anybody to know what the
wise thing was, or the good thing, or the honest thing? There was
only one thing certain&mdash;which was that the forty years would
not wait.</p>

<p>He got up, knowing he had the decision here and could not
delay it. So he said, "I understand everybody's going down the
Applegate tomorrow night to raise a house and see Gray Bartlett
and Liza Stone married."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He moved once more to the stove and knocked out his ashes. He
said, "I'll be there," and turned around to watch her.</p>

<p>She sat with her hands still on her lap, looking across the
room to the wall. Her face was as clearly expressive at this
moment as he had ever seen it&mdash;nor did he ever again see it
so graphically register the light and the shadow of her
feelings&mdash;the pleasure his words had brought, the wonder and
the fullness of heart which followed, and the strange, small
stirring of sadness which came after. She lifted her shoulders
and looked around to him, smiling at him and smiling for him.
"Yes," she said, "I'll be there, too."</p>

<p>"Good night," he said, and moved out of the house toward his
blankets. He heard the soft bell-like echo of her voice come
after him. "Good night, Logan."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER 5. &mdash; DOUBT
BEGINS</h2>

<p class="first">AFTER the sun dropped behind the hills west of
town, there was by summer a long and beautiful hour in which both
shadow and light seemed to stand still. Sauntering up the gentle
grade to the Overmire house, George Camrose now and then looked
back to see supper fires burning along the creek and the smoke
rising into the pearl-colored air. The town's streets were empty
during this hour and a feeling of loose ease came over it as
though all men, paused from sober work, now waited for evening
and the excitement of evening. "Shedding righteousness and
embracing revelry," he thought with his usual sardonic twist of
mind. The two had two characters: by day it was sweaty and
impatient and grimly at labor; by night it turned bawdy. Often he
had thought of this, and often had decided that men who toiled so
long for their riches and spent those riches with such swift
abandon were fools scarcely to be pitied.</p>

<p>Lucy was at the door to meet him with her calm pleasantness.
He ate with the family and for a little interval sat in the room
while the lamps were lighted and the conversation moved casually
from one thing to another. In a little while Lucy rose and looked
at him, and the two passed into the darkness and strolled along
the edges of the town, the hot day's odors quite strong around
them.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it's been just another dull day. Nobody
killed, nobody robbed, no ten-pound nuggets."</p>

<p>"We always live on the edge of expectancy, waiting for big
things to happen."</p>

<p>"Typical mining-camp feeling. Always expecting a big tomorrow
that never comes."</p>

<p>"Yet I do love this country. I am quite happy here."</p>

<p>"Ah, Lucy," he said, "there's so much of this world we're
missing. This is only one lonely little spot of it. We're three
thousand miles off the main road."</p>

<p>"You sound rather jaded," she said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I'm partial to mansions with plush furniture and God knows
what I'd give to step into a restaurant and have music with my
dinner. I'm anxious for the next move."</p>

<p>"What will that be?"</p>

<p>"Either to be transferred to the company's office in San
Francisco&mdash;and I'm sure you'd like that&mdash;or else to get
into another kind of work. I know mining and mining towns and I
fancy I might someday go East and place myself with some of these
big houses which handle mining interests." Then he added
something else, without changing the expression of his voice.
"When are we to be married?"</p>

<p>They were arm in arm as they walked silently forward. Her lack
of instant answer caused him to look at her; and then she said:
"I had not known you were very impatient about it."</p>

<p>He kept his lightness, his faint air of amusement at himself.
"I am not the rough and overwhelming kind, like Logan."</p>

<p>She spoke quickly. "Let's not grow too serious."</p>

<p>"I'm trying to tell you something, Lucy. I'm not the kind of a
man Logan is. He is not responsible for his character and neither
am I for mine. We happen to be what we are, nothing more or
less."</p>

<p>"Have I ever questioned it?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes I feel you make a comparison which leaves me at a
disadvantage. But, Lucy, I do love you very much."</p>

<p>"Why, George."</p>

<p>He saw that he had succeeded in profoundly stirring her, and
he drew her forward and kissed her. It was a soft kiss, soon done
with; immediately afterwards he stepped back to observe her face
in these velvet shadows. "Should I be rough and violent? I think
you expected it. Should it be fury and thunder to be real?"</p>

<p>Her voice had a sudden energy in it. "Why do you always pick
things apart?"</p>

<p>"It is a streak in me, I guess. Or a fear that I may not be
rough and bruising enough."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to tell me you resented the way Logan kissed
me? After all, you brought that on rather deliberately. Why did
you do it?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and only said, "It irritated Logan
to have me do it."</p>

<p>"You didn't show it."</p>

<p>"I never show myself." He laughed a little and took her arm,
the two of them retracing their route toward the Overmire house.
"You two are much alike," he said. But he was rather gay, his
little gust of emotion having passed, and at the doorway of the
house he removed his hat. "Let's not wait too long. I'm very
lonely."</p>

<p>"George," she said, as serious as he had seen her at any time,
"don't make things complicated between us. Don't be so filled
with wonder and doubt. Let everything be simple and
straight."</p>

<p>"My thoughts seldom ever travel a straight line," he said.</p>

<p>"Doesn't your affection travel in a straight line?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Yes, I believe it does."</p>

<p>"Then let it be straight. You must not confuse me."</p>

<p>He bowed to her with his outward cheerfulness; he searched her
face with a moment's care, seeking some fugitive expression which
might betray other emotions she might be hiding from him. Then he
walked down the hill, turned at Stuart's store and passed from
sight, eventually to appear again on the pathway to Les-
trade's.</p>

<p>She knew where he was going and she thought: "He would rather
play poker than stay here." It was a thing that should have made
her both resentful and jealous, but it did not. She folded her
hands across her breasts, remembering that once tonight he had
greatly moved her for the first time in many days. It took her
back to the beginning when she had been so sure of him and so
sure of herself, when everything had been wonderful between them,
when she waited for marriage with a terrible impatience.</p>

<p>She was shocked by the realism of her present thinking. She
was angry at him for taking this clear thing which had been
between them and muddying it with his questions, his
indifference, his odd inflections. She recalled the guarded
remarks people had made about his poker-playing habits&mdash;said
in jest and quickly dropped, yet deliberately intended as
warnings. She saw his face, its charming handsomeness and its gay
changeability&mdash;and then she saw the little things she had
not noticed before, the narrowness of that face and the sharp
edges of it. She checked herself at once. "I must stop this." If
he was what she had thought him to be a year before, he must
still be the same man now. And this was the thing that unsteadied
her the most&mdash;this doubt of her own judgment; she had been
made changeable and fickle and cheap in her own mind.</p>

<p>And it hurt her to think how great and powerful a sensation
Logan Stuart's kiss had shot through her&mdash;how vivid and how
lasting it had been, how unsettling it was even now. "I should be
ashamed of that," she thought. "I should be ashamed to realize
another man could create that feeling in me." Sometimes she was a
stranger to herself, astonished at the things she had not known
were in her, and as she faced the night she had a very real fear
of the future. Some unlovely thing was happening to her. She
hated it and resisted it, but could not stop it.</p>

<p><br> <br> On his way down the street, Camrose passed Joe Harms
who, as usual, sat on the bench in front of Howison's hay barn.
He had no greeting for Harms and Harms had none for him; the
truth was that Camrose had always distrusted the frail little
man's manner of sitting spiderlike in the shadows, spying upon
the town. At the express office he turned in, locked the door
behind him, and lighted a lamp. Then, casting a glance at the
window shutters to be sure they were tight-closed, he worked the
safe's dial and swung open the heavy door.</p>

<p>The gold dust bought by the company lay on the upper shelf,
waiting convenient shipment, and the gold coins used in daily
business were all carefully stacked there; on the lower shelf
stood the fat pokes of the miners, held for them as a matter of
safekeeping only and returnable to them on their demand. McIver's
poke was the one from which he had been currently borrowing and
now he lifted it and set it on the scales to refresh his mind as
to the quantity he had already borrowed.</p>

<p>A slight grimace stirred his face as he watched the scales
dip; and he stood in considerable thought, his elbows on the
counter. McIver was supposed to be on a prospect somewhere down
the Rogue and therefore not due back for some time. Yet suppose
he came suddenly in, as Steele had done? The truth was, the game
got increasingly risky; one could not go on forever juggling
dust, and forever hoping for a night's luck at poker to balance
the account.</p>

<p>He restored McIver's poke to the safe and stood in thoughtful
debate. A good night's winnings would change all this, and sooner
or later that was bound to come. There was also another
possibility, which was that one of these miners who had left gold
here for safekeeping might die in some sudden accident or brawl,
leaving the gold unpossessed. He had thought of it steadily for
the past two weeks, turning the prospect over and over in his
head. McIver's death, for example, would be for him a stroke of
luck. He shrugged his shoulders and, with some slight qualms,
slipped a hundred dollars of the company's gold coin into his
pocket and locked the safe. Presently, with the office closed
behind him, he continued toward Lestrade's.</p>

<p>A few moments later Joe Harms walked from the narrow space
between the express office and Howison's barn; all during the
recent minutes he had stood in a crouched position against the
express-office wall with his eye pushed against a knothole in the
building's rough walls; it was a very small knothole, yet it had
given him an excellent view of Camrose's actions.</p>

<p>The Lestrades and Howison were comfortably gathered around the
fire when Camrose arrived; and Mrs. Lestrade rose to mix him a
hot whisky punch. "Really," said Lestrade, "we've not got enough
customers for a game. Logan's out of town and Balance is off
somewhere on mercy's errand. Drink your punch, George, and call
it a day."</p>

<p>He was never a genial man whose sense of hospitality reached
out to warm others; and this night he seemed more indrawn than
usual, almost to the point of waspishness. He sat close to the
fire as though unable to get warmth enough into his bones, and
his face was tired. Mrs. Lestrade was, Camrose thought,
definitely oppressed by her husband's temper; she was very quiet,
very sober. Howison, seeming also to sense this lack of
pleasantness, suddenly finished his punch and got up to depart.
"Tomorrow's tomorrow."</p>

<p>"There'll be an end to tomorrows soon enough," said
Lestrade.</p>

<p>"Very cheerful thought," said Howison dryly. "You're full of
self-pity."</p>

<p>Lestrade lifted his head to rake Howison with an embittered
glance, whereupon Camrose observed for the first time that
Lestrade's eyes were considerably bloodshot, as though the man
had been heavily drinking.</p>

<p>"Now, now," said Camrose. "This is scarcely the way to begin
or end an evening."</p>

<p>"End it any way you please," retorted Les-trade, and fell into
a spell of coughing.</p>

<p>Howison had gone to the door. Following him, Camrose turned to
observe that Marta Lestrade watched her husband quite closely and
with almost a complete absence of expression. She lifted her eyes
and met Camrose's glance and held it over a long moment. After he
left the house, joining Howison, he tried to fathom that glance,
and a small excitement ran through him as he played with the
notion that she was silently speaking to him.</p>

<p>Howison went glumly along the path, still obviously out of
sorts. Camrose said: "We have got to make allowances for a sick
man, Neil. He's dying."</p>

<p>"Is he?" said Howison briefly, and swung toward his own
cabin.</p>

<p>Camrose called after him. "Tomorrow night, Neil?"</p>

<p>"No, think not."</p>

<p>Camrose strolled on alone with his evening at loose ends. He
had gone to Lestrade's eager for poker and he had come away with
the eagerness unabated. It was an appetite he could not control
and suddenly he turned into Hobart's deadfall, found a blooded
game in progress there and made a place for himself at the table.
This night, he thought, would be better; this night his luck
would change.</p>

<p><br> <br> Lestrade rose up from his chair with a changed
manner and reached for his hat. He grinned at his wife. "Do you
think I play the part of a petulant invalid well, Marta?"</p>

<p>"Too well. They left here disliking you."</p>

<p>"They don't come here out of affection for me at any event,"
he said. "Balance comes to escape the pains and aches of his
customers, Howison comes because he is a bachelor with no better
place to go, and Camrose is drawn by the hope he'll make a
killing at cards. Or perhaps&mdash;" and he gave his wife a cool
appraisal&mdash;"to watch you for a sign of approval. Do you give
him a sign of approval, Marta?"</p>

<p>"You are nasty tonight."</p>

<p>"I am a realist, and all realists are nasty when they jar the
romantic myths people like to wrap around themselves to cover
their shabby sins."</p>

<p>"Are your sins any less shabby, Jack?"</p>

<p>"I am honest about them. I do not pretend."</p>

<p>"You are always pretending. You think that by admitting your
sins you are being a very strong character."</p>

<p>He was at the door. He paused there to look back with his
sharp and antagonistic glance.</p>

<p>"You are pretty blunt."</p>

<p>"I thought you admired honesty."</p>

<p>He showed a slight color and confusion, which was rare to him.
"There is such a thing as faithfulness."</p>

<p>"I suppose," she said, "you are going to Bragg's to tell him
what Howison told you about Bill Brown tonight."</p>

<p>He wheeled through the door and slammed it behind him; and
presently she heard him ride away to the northeast. She stood
before the fire, the blaze throwing its light on the frozen
calmness of her face; but as time went on the heat seemed to thaw
that expression until her lips and her eyes were loose with
despair. Turning, she left the house and walked on through the
scattered timber; she was scarcely conscious of her direction and
when she reached the creek and found it barring her way, she
stopped and something broke within her and she began to cry.</p>

<p>Johnny Steele, walking abroad in the night, heard the sound of
this crying and came on until he was near enough to recognize
her. He said: "Anything I can do, Mrs. Lestrade?"</p>

<p>She seemed unaware of his nearness; she remained erect, both
hands cupped to her face, racked by the increasing violence of
her crying. She had started and she could not stop; the spasms
grew greater and greater and her breath lifted and fell in
swifter, sharper gasps. Johnny Steele was appalled by it. A
woman's tears were foreign to him and a woman's grief was a
terrible thing to witness. It came to the point where he could no
longer be a spectator, and so he stepped forward and put his arms
around her.</p>

<p>Then he knew how bad it was with her. He was a stranger,
touching her, and she was so blind and heartbroken that she
wasn't aware of it. She turned in his arms and laid her forehead
against his chest and continued to weep; he tried to hold her
tight enough to stop her shuddering but he could not, and that
was a thing that got into him and shook his nerves. He thought to
himself: "Goddamn whoever did it," and an extraordinary pity went
through him and he became this woman's fiery partisan.</p>

<p>He had no idea of how long he stood in that position. Time ran
on considerably and at last he noticed the lessening of her
body's shaking. It was, he thought, like a violent southwester
blowing itself out; and afterwards her weight rested more heavily
against him, as though she had been exhausted. Presently she drew
back and became aware of him.</p>

<p>He was embarrassed at what she might think of him. He said,
"I'm Johnny Steele," and regretted the rough appearance he must
be making. "I heard you, and came up. Anything I can do?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. He had of course often seen her in camp
and often had observed her prettiness, now it was more than
prettiness to him and he felt somehow obligated and bound to her.
Meanwhile, she had taken her time to study him and had reached
some sort of conclusion about him. She turned away but in a
moment she swung back. "It was good of you. You'll say nothing
about it?"</p>

<p>"I'll say nothing. But if it's any kind of trouble I can
fix&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," she answered in her soft and depressed voice, and
disappeared in the trees.</p>

<p>He turned toward the street with the keenest memory of his
arms holding her. He paused before Corson's deadfall, then swung
away from it with no appetite for a drink. "Probably that damned
husband of hers," he thought and was considerably enraged at the
man. He reached a small shack on the town's western side and
stepped in, lighting a lamp; and his immediate move was to have a
look at himself in the mirror. What had she seen? One more
miner's sunburnt and ragged face, marked by its occasional scars?
He thought: "I have been a big fool. What the hell is there to be
proud of in a thousand-dollar drunk? It's time to settle down."
Then he thought: "I ought to shave every morning."</p>

<p><br> <br> Honey Bragg's cabin lay beside a wandering, half-dry
creek four miles from Jacksonville, largely hidden in a thicket
of willow and scrub oak. Coming through this thicket Lestrade
picked up the glitter of Bragg's light and took care to send a
call ahead of him. A pack of dogs rushed out of the shadows, all
baying, and Lestrade began to curse at them as he got down from
his horse; then Bragg's voice moved up from the deeper shadows,
calling off the hounds. Lestrade stepped into the house, with
Bragg coming behind him.</p>

<p>Lestrade irritably said: "If those curs ever dig a fang into
me, Honey, I'll slaughter the whole damned pack." There were
three other men in the small, earth-floored cabin. Lestrade gave
them a quick glance and a nod and wheeled to face Bragg, whose
fleshy lips and brightly dancing eyes had an easy smile. Honey
was affable when he chose to be. Honey was a schemer who could
meet a man with any temper he chose, and now he chose to be
pleasant.</p>

<p>"They're to keep strangers from slippin' up on me." He gave
the three men a signal with his hand, whereupon they moved out of
the cabin. When they were beyond earshot, Bragg said: "What's it
now?"</p>

<p>"Howison is sending Bill out again as messenger. Same
road."</p>

<p>Bragg turned to the doorway at once and called, "Boys, get up
the horses."</p>

<p>Lestrade said: "What's between you and Stuart?"</p>

<p>Honey Bragg came about, smiling but alert. "Nothing at
all."</p>

<p>"He had something on his mind the other night when he faced
you."</p>

<p>"He stepped in to protect the kid. He didn't want to see
Blazier busted up, because Blazier works for him."</p>

<p>"You backed away from a fight. That's not your usual
style."</p>

<p>Bragg ceased to smile and his temper, always a treacherous
thing, grew unstable. "Don't ask questions."</p>

<p>"So, then," said Lestrade coolly, "he's got it on you. You
were all set for a scrap, and when you're set for a scrap it is
something you've got to have right away. But he came along and
you dropped it entirely."</p>

<p>Bragg's nostrils swelled wider and his face, in line and
shadow, began to distill the basic cruelty within. "Never mind,"
he said in the briefest of tones.</p>

<p>"If he drives you out of the country, it would spoil the good
thing we have now. Better leave him alone entirely."</p>

<p>"If I fight him I'll do the driving," said Bragg.</p>

<p>Lestrade shook his head. "You can't drive him anywhere. You
ought to be able to whip him, but you can't drive him. In a brawl
you might kill him. If you did, you couldn't stay here a minute.
The whole camp would be after you. Maybe that's why you avoided
the fight."</p>

<p>Bragg showed his irritation. "He made a fine play of it. He's
got the camp thinkin' him the best rooster on the street." He
stood still, unsettled and vindictive, as he reviewed the event.
It was a thorn in him which gouged and festered. "I should have
done it. Got to be done sometime."</p>

<p>"Why?" pressed Lestrade.</p>

<p>"Because. That's answer enough for you." Bragg pointed a
finger at Lestrade. "You find out when Stuart is going to ship
gold."</p>

<p>"I told you about the Portland trip. You had no luck at it.
You never have luck when it's Stuart."</p>

<p>Bragg stared at Lestrade so steadily that the latter presently
shrugged his shoulders and departed. He was always glad to have
these meetings done with.</p>

<p><br> <br> At the end of an hour Camrose was considerably ahead
of the poker game; whereas before he had made up his mind to play
only until he had recouped his losses and afterwards to abstain
from gambling, he now forgot his fears and his self-lectures and
once again planned on running his luck to the farthest point.
Talk went on endlessly around him as men came in, drank, and
departed. A quarrel sprang up and blew over. The smoke got
thicker in the deadfall and the temperature rose until sweat
shone like oil on all the surrounding faces. There was discussion
to be heard concerning pockets and lodes and drifts, of
Sterling's richness as against Coyote Creek, of a little nameless
gulch west of the Applegate wherein somebody had discovered and
lost gravel so rich it had a yellow cast in the sunlight. There
was talk of women, of memorable drunken sprees, of food, of
Indians, of fights and fighters. On that subject an argument
presently rose concerning Stuart's skill as against Honey Bragg's
brute power.</p>

<p>Camrose's luck had once more taken a turn downgrade and he was
irritably intent on the game; even so, he listened to this
talk.</p>

<p>"He backed off from the scrap, didn't he? He was afraid of
Stuart."</p>

<p>"Ever see his arms when he ain't got a coat on? I seen him
once when he put a sack around his fist and busted a piece of
lumber six inches wide. I seen him break four of George Dyer's
ribs. He ain't afraid. He don't need to be."</p>

<p>"Then why didn't he fight?"</p>

<p>It had begun as a private argument, but it soon became a
subject of general argument, to be analyzed and guessed at, to be
enlarged, to be magnified with stray suspicions. Bragg's fights
were cited and his strength was recounted. Logan Stuart's height
and weight were added to the record, and surmises made as to his
quickness.</p>

<p>"No long-necked man can beat a short-necked man his size.
Stuart would get his head torn off."</p>

<p>"I saw Stuart step around a balky horse once," said another.
"He's fast. Bragg would rush him, but Stuart wouldn't be there.
He'd weave and whirl."</p>

<p>One more man put in his contribution. "All you fellows are
talkin' about Bragg bein' afraid. Maybe it's Stuart who's afraid.
He didn't offer a fight."</p>

<p>Several voices came down on him at once. It sat ill with the
men in the saloon to hear Stuart's courage questioned. "By God,
what you think he stepped up to Bragg for? He opened the door and
he left it open. Bragg never walked through it. You a friend of
Bragg's?"</p>

<p>"I never said I was. I only asked a question."</p>

<p>"It was a damned-fool question."</p>

<p>"Makes no difference. He can't lick Bragg. Nobody can."</p>

<p>"You think so? About how much money you want to put up on
it?"</p>

<p>"Well now, brother, if you're so proud of your money, you name
the amount."</p>

<p>"A hundred will suit me."</p>

<p>"That's fine."</p>

<p>The two stepped to the bar with the crowd and called on Hobart
to hold stakes. Hobart said: "All right. Let me get this. Johnny
Ball bets Ira Mullins one hundred, even, that Stuart can't whip
Bragg. Any time limit on this?"</p>

<p>"Let it ride. The fight's not far off."</p>

<p>"Suppose it comes out a draw?"</p>

<p>"A draw?" said the Bragg man. "Not a chance. If Stuart's on
his feet when Bragg walks away I'll consider I lost."</p>

<p>There was, even in this crowd so partial to Stuart,
considerable murmured assent to that conviction; the brutal
record made by Bragg impressed all of them. Camrose, now steadily
losing, got up from the table in bad temper and walked to the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Just what makes you gentlemen so damned sure of a fight?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>The saloonkeeper, Hobart, answered fot the crowd. "Why,
George, everybody knows there's got to be a fight."</p>

<p>"How do you know it?"</p>

<p>"Well, good God," said Hobart, "one's best man and one's
second best&mdash;and it's got to be settled, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Does it occur to any of you that you're pushing Stuart to a
hell of a beating just to satisfy your curiosities?"</p>

<p>"Then he shouldn't of set himself up before Bragg in the first
place," said Hobart.</p>

<p>"If you fellows are so dead set for a fight, why don't some of
you have a go at Bragg? I'll lay an open bet there isn't a man in
the house who can whip Bragg. Five hundred dollars on it. Let's
see your sporting blood."</p>

<p>There were no takers and Hobart passed off the offer with a
wave of his arm. "You're just standing on your sore corn, George.
Stuart can handle himself."</p>

<p>"A very easy thing for you to say since it is not your skin.
Want to bet five hundred Stuart will whip Bragg?"</p>

<p>Hobert looked momentarily thoughtful. "No," he said, "I
wouldn't go that far. But you wouldn't bet against your friend,
anyhow, George."</p>

<p>Camrose looked around the crowd, hating everybody in the room.
He said with deliberate intent to throw a scare into them: "I
think Bragg ought to know who is doing all this betting and
talking. It might interest him."</p>

<p>He had not realized, until then, how oppressive a threat
Bragg's name was. The two betters at once swung away, and the
rest of the group immediately lost interest in the subject. He
had some hard looks from the group, and Hobart said: "If you
don't like this camp, why do you stay here?"</p>

<p>Camrose returned to the game, but it went no better. At
midnight he placed an I.O.U. for five hundred dollars in the
hands of Gordon Thackeray and left the deadfall. The wind,
brushing his sweaty face, brought a sharp reaction of coldness
and he walked toward the express office in blackest spirits. "I
should have quit when I was ahead," he told himself.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER 6. &mdash; NEW CABIN ON
THE ROGUE</h2>

<p class="first">STUART reached Jacksonville with the pack train
around noon of Saturday; at two o'clock he was once again riding
the trail this time bound for the cabin-raising down the Rogue.
With him were Lucy and Camrose, both in the lightest of moods;
and also with him were Vane Blazier and Mrs. Lestrade.</p>

<p>"Where's Jack?" asked Stuart.</p>

<p>"He's not been feeling well," said Mrs. Lestrade.</p>

<p>"Sorry to hear it," commented Stuart. Mrs. Lestrade looked at
him with a moment's close interest. She was in a most attractive
dress, its color brightening and heightening the charm of her
face. She was a woman soft of manner, speech and gesture; in her
own way she was as striking as Lucy Overmire, yet in every
respect those inward qualities which reflected themselves through
her features were more pliable than those of the other girl. She
had not the definiteness of expression, the sense of robust
emotions under discipline, the feeling of strong will. It was as
though, loving warmth, she was numbed by coldness.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when they reached the pile of
rough lumber and logs which marked the future house of young Gray
Bartlett and Liza Stone. Bartlett had picked a long narrow meadow
which lay against the river and the river's willows; and being
practical, he had also located himself beside the California
trail, to combine farming with chance profits from accommodating
travelers.</p>

<p>The settlers&mdash;there were a hundred of them had come from
thirty miles around, drawn not so much by the fact of a marriage
as by the need they felt for an occasional cheerful gathering.
Saddle horses and wagons stood idle in the meadow and men were
already notching and setting up the log walls of the cabin while
others, with saw and wedge and froe, were riving out the cedar
shakes to be used on the roof. There was a lively argument going
on between two men, concerning the advisability of slanting the
window frames for better protection against Indian attack.
Another crew had set about erecting the fireplace which, being a
matter of some delicacy, had been put in the charge of the man
who seemed to know most about the depth and width necessary to
assure a proper "draw."</p>

<p>"You got no draw," he said, "and you got no cabin. I wish I
had some animal blood to mix with this clay." Slightly down the
meadow, a separate group was throwing together a temporary lean-
to to serve as a barn.</p>

<p>This was in effect a holiday effort of the neighbors, over
which young Bartlett had no control. He had indeed put in a
request that the cabin have only one door, but was overruled by
older heads. "You want two doors, in case trouble comes." Young
Bartlett said, "Well, all right," and offered no more
suggestions. It was much the same with Liza Stone who sat
prettily on the brown meadow grass while the neighbor ladies,
walking around the interior of the cabin, much to the irritation
of the builders, made plans as to the disposition of the
furniture. Liza smilingly agreed to all their proposals; and to
herself said: "I'll move it the way I want it when they're
gone."</p>

<p>In the meadow a fine fire cheerfully burned while women
bustled about making a community supper, and other ladies came up
with their own particular specialties&mdash;pickled peaches,
huckleberry pie, blackberry pie, cider, fresh butter molded in
pretty patterns, homemade cheese, summer sausage, Indian relish,
and cucumbers in cream and vinegar, and jellies and jams and
fruit butters, all of these compounded out of old recipes brought
from Vermont and New York, from Missouri and Kentucky.</p>

<p>Shortly before sunset the house was done and perspiring men
came out with the heavy log ends with which they had beaten down
the earth floor, which Liza Stone's mother had insisted on in
preference to puncheons "because the earth is more healthy." The
wedding gifts began to move in: a four-posted cherrywood bed
which had traveled two thousand miles overland, homemade chairs
and table, dishes and cooking utensils, a feather mattress and
pillows and a patchwork spread, a barrel of sugar and a barrel of
flour and sides of cured meat; and all the trinkets and objects
of a home. The ladies made the last touches. A fire was
lighted&mdash;the superintendent of the fireplace construction
narrowly watching the smoke lift from the chimney&mdash;and the
bed was made. A rug was laid down and a lamp placed on the table
beside a Bible opened at the Psalms. The dishes were put in the
cupboard and a brush broom tipped against the wall. A man drove
up with a wagon and a team; in the wagon were a plow and a
harrow. He got down and tied the team to the house door.</p>

<p>"Now," said Liza Stone's father, "let's have the wedding."</p>

<p>The minister stood bareheaded in the meadow, the two people
came before him, and the crowd made a circle around. The sun
dropped west and the hour of water-clear light was upon the land,
with its fragrance and its stillness so complete that the
minister's voice moved round and resonant all down the meadow. He
married them and he pronounced his benediction, and then he put
his Bible in his rear trouser pocket and stood back while young
Bartlett, considerably unstrung by his audience, accepted his
wife with a vigorous kiss. The new Mrs. Bartlett was smilingly
composed; she bent forward and kissed the minister.</p>

<p>"Supper," called Liza Stone's father. "My God, we got
aplenty."</p>

<p>Stuart got his supper and walked over to where the Dances had
gathered on the grass. Vane Blazier had previously joined this
group, and had taken his place beside Caroline. He had been
talking, but now he fell silent and seemed ill at ease. Lucy and
Camrose and Mrs. Lestrade presently arrived. Johnny Steele walked
past the group and said "Hello, Logan," and went quickly on. He
was shaved and wore a white shirt and a good black suit&mdash;and
he looked pretty substantial.</p>

<p>"I ain't had such a good time since I don't know when," said
Mrs. Dance. "Folks do get awful alone-feelin'."</p>

<p>"It occurs to me," said Camrose, "that the Bartlett couple are
pretty much by themselves. No neighbor closer than three miles,
and the reservation right across the river."</p>

<p>"There'll be too many neighbors inside of a year," said
Dance.</p>

<p>The fall day had been warm. Now coolness flowed from the river
as the shadows came; the big fire was replenished and the flames
grew yellow against the forming darkness. With supper done,
people sat lazy around the meadow, their talk and their laughter
freely running, and youngsters raced through the willows, all
crying out.</p>

<p>"I must get that chow-chow recipe from Mrs. Bartlett," said
Mrs. Dance in a dreaming voice.</p>

<p>Stuart stretched back on the grass, so turned that he saw
Caroline's face, its youngness inter-mixed with its unplumbed
maturity. She felt his glance and met it; she held his attention
with as much deliberate intention as he had ever seen in her. It
was as though she felt something deeply, and wished him to feel
it as well; she was speaking to him in this way, saying those
things she would never bring herself to say openly.</p>

<p>Camrose spoke in his idle, detached fashion. "The illusion of
peace is upon us."</p>

<p>It was not the kind of talk, nor was he the kind of man, these
people understood. His manner was not quite frank and plain
enough for these direct settlers. Only Mrs. Lestrade seemed to be
affected by his remark, her dark eyes turning on him and
remaining a moment.</p>

<p>Lucy's only answer to Camrose was a half smile; afterwards her
attention traveled to Caroline and became thoughtful. Suddenly
Dance let out a whoop and rose from the ground to shout: "Buck,
where's your fiddle? Where's Simon to call for us? Come on
now&mdash;come on! We got to dance off these provisions before we
go home!"</p>

<p>The stars were brightly glinting in a sharp-black sky. Dance,
still shouting, disappeared in the river's direction; he was gone
a little while and then came laughing back toward the fire with a
keg under his arm. He got a bucket and he poured the contents of
the keg into the bucket, and walked into the house for a dipper.
He came back with a second bucket and, with both buckets and the
dippers, he made his rounds.</p>

<p>"Whisky or water? Can't dance without sweatin'. Whisky or
water?"</p>

<p>The fiddler found himself a seat on the wagon standing near
the house and tuned his instrument; the caller took his station
and slapped both hands sharply together. "Partners form your
sets! We got room for two sets at a time."</p>

<p>"Caroline," said Stuart and rose. He took her hands and
brought her up. "It is time to be foolish."</p>

<p>She studied his face and weighed his words; her answering
smile was uncertain and gently stirred by excitement. "I guess it
is not so foolish, is it?"</p>

<p>All the group looked on, Mrs. Dance with her quietly anxious
interest, Vane Blazier in dark resentment, Mrs. Lestrade whose
mouth sweetened at what she saw, Camrose with his sudden knowing
grin&mdash;and Lucy Overmire. Lucy's attention was closely on
these two and her expresison was one which seemed to be half
startled by what she saw here. Camrose turned to her: "Let's join
them," and got to his feet.</p>

<p>Couples moved toward the fire as the caller sang out, "Form
and balance all! Let 'er go Jed!" The fiddler sank his bow on the
fiddle's strings and swung into a reel. The two sets
formed&mdash;four couples to a set&mdash;near the fire. The
caller's voice whipped them around; they stepped over the
summer's slick grass, out and back. "Oh take your girls, your
pretty little girls," suggested the caller while the onlooking
spectators brought their palms together to beat out the music's
rhythm. "Virginia is a grand old state. Come on boys, don't be
late."</p>

<p>Somebody threw fresh wood on the fire and sparks flashed with
white brilliance against the night; the sets turned and wheeled
and the steady hand-claps made a hard pulse all through the
night. The fiddler on the wagon seat drew out his bow upon the
last note, and laughter boiled and new couples ran into the light
to take their turn. The fiddler cried, "Where's that bucket,
Dance?"</p>

<p>Suddenly a man spoke one sharp word which arrested all of
them, which turned them around to see the six Rogue bucks
standing beyond the fire, their naked upper bodies shining like
dull copper.</p>

<p>A man trotted toward the wagons, clearly with the intent of
getting his gun. Dance brusquely called at him. "No, Pete. No."
Dance put down his buckets and faced the Indians, calling to them
in their own blunt language; the motion of his arm drew them
forward until they were well within the circle of light, all lean
men with their ribs making rippled patterns against their skin,
all with lank hair hanging down about their heads as a frame for
their coarse and unsymmetrical faces. Light touched their eyes,
vaguely flashing on those muddy surfaces, and their lips formed
sharp downward curves. One of them pointed at the whisky
bucket.</p>

<p>"No," said Dance.</p>

<p>That same one pointed to the new house and talked quickly,
bitterly. When the Indian was done speaking, Dance stood still
and a heavily strained silence fell, the settlers looking upon
the six Rogues with their memories of past disasters and
treacheries, of families lying butchered in remote cabins, and
the sudden crack of guns out of ambush, and the wild whoop of
attack. These were memories luridly alive; the six savages
standing here personified the uncertainty and the never quite
extinguished fear which hung over them.</p>

<p>Dance began to talk, using his hands to make smooth motions
through the air; he was calm and easy about it and almost
smiling, but positiveness went with his words. Meanwhile Logan
Stuart had picked up a muslin sack from somebody's supper basket
and now went around the grass, filling the sack with leftover
food. He handed the sack to Dance and watched the wary eyes of
the Rogues drop to it and steadily stay upon it. Dance said a
last word and tossed the sack to the spokesman who, casting a
last brightly intolerant glance around the crowd, stalked off
with his people.</p>

<p>The fiddler said: "Let's go&mdash;let's go."</p>

<p>"We were careless," said Dance. "Where's my boys?"</p>

<p>His oldest son came trotting in from the dark like a lean
hound. "We been watchin' em for half an hour," said the boy.
"It's all right. They got no guns. There ain't any more around.
We're watchin'."</p>

<p>"That's better," said Dance and was broadly pleased as he
watched his son wheel away. Dance picked up his bucket and banged
the dipper against it. "Water's all gone, but whisky's just as
good for sweatin'!" The fiddler swung into a tune.</p>

<p>Caroline Dance, during this scene, had stood alone with
unruffled interest. Coming back to her, Logan saw once more on
her face the reflection of an inner hardihood, stronger than any
other quality she possessed. The appearance of the Rogues had
made her grave, but she had not known fear. Her glance came to
him and her smile woke at his smile; and suddenly he took her arm
and moved away with her into the shadows.</p>

<p>"Caroline," he said, "what were you thinking about?"</p>

<p>"It is such a nice house Liza and Gray have got. If it were my
house, I'd have a storeroom added. A kitchen ought to be
big."</p>

<p>It was the practical things which captured her mind; her
thoughts were direct and simple ones. The fire was a bright cone
in blackness and the music came out to them brisk and lifting,
with the steady shouting of the settlers and the clapped-out
rhythm of their hands moving through the dark. Fall's smell was a
thick fragrance around them, rising from the lush earth, from the
hills so darkly ridged beyond them, from the river&mdash;all this
stirring Stuart's wonder. Around him was the timelessness of this
universe&mdash;these wild odors which had been here since the
beginning, this slight wind and those blackly suggested hills
farther away; and the arch of the sky above. There was something
in it for a man to understand; there were hints in it, and now
and then a feeling came out of it to touch him and to set his
mind alive. Something waited for him somewhere, but what it was
he never could know; for when his thoughts moved close to the
mystery, the mystery retreated and left him puzzled. Was a man
for walking and riding, or was he for thinking? Was he meant to
hope for what he could not have or was he meant quietly to work
out his day?</p>

<p>"Logan," said Caroline, "you're not always so quiet."</p>

<p>It occurred to him then that he knew little about her, and
that she knew little about him. Would he hurt her for not
bringing more to her than he could, or would she know? It was not
a question ever likely to be answered. "At this moment," he said,
"I'm wondering if you like me well enough to make a marriage out
of it." Her answer had long been in her mind, ready for him if he
ever asked for it. It came promptly to him now in a voice small
enough, and yet cool enough&mdash;and quite certain. "Yes."</p>

<p>He kissed her, healthily and hard, and he felt her arms grow
tight against his back. Afterwards she pulled her head down until
her cheek was against his chest; she stayed that way a long
moment, not speaking. The pressure of her arms remained until,
made curious by her silence, he drew away. She lifted her face to
him, with all its tremendous seriousness visible to him even in
the darkness.</p>

<p>"I wish," she said, "nothing would ever change, that it would
always stay the same&mdash;no more people or houses or new
things. Everything just as now."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Everything's good now. It could never be better."</p>

<p>"Don't you want a good road over the mountain, a nice town
near by&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked at him, smiling at her opinions. "I know it will
change," she said. "But I can wish for it not to, can't I?"</p>

<p>The music began again and the figures of the dancers moved
against the dull red cast of the dying fire. Caroline and Stuart
walked slowly back to the little group lounging on the grass.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dance said, "Caroline, it is about time to pick up and
go." But this wasn't on her mind as she eagerly read her
daughter's face. Caroline saw the question. She said, "Yes," and
quietly laughed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dance got up with an excited gesture and gave Stuart an
impulsive kiss. "You're a good man, Stuart. You've got a good
girl."</p>

<p>Camrose, half asleep on the grass, rolled around and sat up.
He said, curiously, "What is this?" Then he saw what it was and
got to his feet and seized Stuart's hand. "Damned glad to hear of
it." Mrs. Lestrade had risen, her face soft and stirred. People
began to come up, catching the scent of news. Dance, made brashly
cheerful by his bucket and dipper, sent a long halloo to the
black sky.</p>

<p>Stuart watched people come to Caroline, watched Caroline meet
them with her composure. She would already be thinking of the
house and what the house should contain; she would be making her
plans, quietly and with sureness, and placing the little objects
about her which she treasured so much. He had not looked toward
Lucy. He had kept his eyes from her. But he saw her now, standing
before Caroline and speaking her words with care, with that grace
upon her which she always possessed. "Caroline," she said, "I am
so happy for you."</p>

<p>He saw Caroline's face grow firmer, he observed a shadowed
wisdom come to it. Caroline was a woman at this moment, closely
staring at another woman, and Caroline's words had reserve in
them. "That's nice," she said. Lucy turned away, never looking at
him.</p>

<p>People stirred around, catching up their possessions, and
began to move out of the meadow. Stuart gave Caroline a hand to
the seat of her father's wagon and stood with his hat removed
while the wagon rolled into the night. Then he went to his own
horse, and joined the Jacksonville party waiting for him. A small
group of relatives tarried in front of the new cabin, and voices
of the departing settlers came back through the night as they
called out their last farewells.</p>

<p>Stuart joined Mrs. Lestrade and Lucy and Camrose, and found
that Johnny Steele was returning with them. These five moved
south without talk, until Stuart remembered Blazier.</p>

<p>"Where'd the youngster go?"</p>

<p>"He pulled out alone," said Camrose. "Don't you know why?"
Camrose's voice was easy and laughing. "Lucy, tell our friend
why."</p>

<p>Lucy was riding beside Camrose, with Stuart back of them. He
saw Lucy's face turn toward Camrose and he saw its silhouette. He
could not see more and he could make nothing of her tone, which
was plain and colorless. "Don't be unkind, George."</p>

<p>"What's unkind?" asked Camrose jovially. "You broke Blazier's
heart, Logan. He thought Caroline was his girl."</p>

<p>Lucy's voice sharpened: "Let it be," and when Camrose, still
enjoying his own cleverness, started to speak again, she cut him
off with a still more abrupt manner. "Let it be."</p>

<p>"What have I said?" asked Camrose with some surprise. Then
Mrs. Lestrade, sensing what Camrose did not, began to speak
softly of other things.</p>

<p>Stuart rode without talk and was alone with himself. A thin
moon lay askew in the low south and the river's surface near by
was a dull silver ribbon freckled with the shadows of its
willows. A coyote sounded in the hills and a quiet wind blew. He
thought of many unrelated things, without much interest, without
buoyancy.</p>

<p>Nor did Lucy speak again during the trip. She was asking
herself&mdash;in so insistent a way that she even feared Camrose
might catch the current of her thoughts, "Why&mdash;why?" This
night had done what Stuart's kiss had not done; it had revealed
something within her which she had suspected and had not wanted
to know. But it was too late an answer. Her own original error
could have been mended, had she been sure it was an error; now it
could not, for it was no longer her error to mend. And again she
asked herself: "Why&mdash;why did he? Why should he? It isn't
what he thinks it is. We are both fools, and we are both
wrong."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER 7. &mdash; BLOOD LUST</h2>

<p class="first">FINISHED with his morning inspection of the
ledgers, Stuart got to thinking of the coming winter, and of the
spring to follow, and of the years beyond. Each new
cabin&mdash;such as young Gray Bartlett's&mdash;was a dot on the
land's former emptiness. Wherever those dots began to cluster, a
settlement was taking shape; some would grow and some would die,
and it was never clear which would survive. Rich little valleys
lay untouched until a venturesome family, risking the Rogues,
moved in. Then another equally venturesome man erected a
gristmill and a community was born. It was a guessing game and
this was the fun of it&mdash;the guessing and the planning and
the riding; afterward it was Clenchfield's job to count the
shelves and add up the bills. But Clenchfield was in one
particular completely right. Stuart &amp; Company had grown so
fast that it had no fat on its bones; if it were to grow farther
it would need some kind of money in addition to that which it had
in the till.</p>

<p>Clenchfield had steadily argued against venturing; all his
words were colored by the conviction that a man who dared too
much inevitably met disaster. But Clenchfield was from the Old
World&mdash;and the Old World had trained its children not to
dare beyond their proper place. Clenchfield did not understand
that America was all motion and change, that failure was never
permanent unless a man deliberately made it so, that disaster was
something to meet and forget and walk away from. America had no
limits except those a man placed upon himself. The yesterdays
Clenchfield loved did not exist here at all. The todays
Clenchfield labored so hard to keep balanced and exact would soon
be dead tomorrows. When a man tied himself to a piece of time,
that piece of time, always moving backward into the mists, took
him with it until both the man and the piece of time were dead
and forgotten.</p>

<p>But Clenchfield was right in saying that Stuart &amp; Company
needed more money. Its growth perpetually starved it; what it
needed was a substantial line of credit from a banking house, and
there was none nearer than San Francisco. It was, Stuart thought,
about time to go south and secure some kind of commitment from a
financial institution like Crawford &amp; Company.</p>

<p>Neil Howison, stepping into the store, found him thus plunged
in contemplation, with a cold pipe clenched between his heavy
teeth. "What's up?" said Howison.</p>

<p>Stuart leaned back and lighted his pipe. "Just figuring."</p>

<p>"You're always figuring. Ever get anything settled for
good?"</p>

<p>"Never try."</p>

<p>"Logan, I have made a disagreeable discovery. I laid my trap
and caught something. Bill Brown was held up again in the
mountains."</p>

<p>"You've got it pinned down? No mistake?"</p>

<p>"Only one man knew about it," said Howison. "I hate to think
of him as a crook. I've played a lot of poker at his table. I've
drunk a lot of his liquor. Whom can I depend on? Doesn't
friendship mean anything? Is everything rotten in this
world?"</p>

<p>"You have made a painful discovery," said Stuart. "You will
make more."</p>

<p>"A common road agent. A thief. A night rider. Giving me a
smile and meaning nothing by it. It makes me sick."</p>

<p>"The gentleman does not do his own dirty work," said Stuart.
"Bragg's in it, too."</p>

<p>"If you knew all this, why have you been playing poker in
Lestrade's house?"</p>

<p>"So that I could draw my conclusions about him."</p>

<p>It rather nettled Howison to think that he had been walking
through situations without being aware of them. "How much do you
know? What do you know about Bragg?"</p>

<p>"We all know about Bragg."</p>

<p>"Not enough to make him back down from a fight as you did,"
pointed out Howison. "You know something else that's got him
worried." He waited for Stuart to shed light on the subject. When
it did not come he spoke again. "Bragg will not be satisfied to
have you running around with information that might cause him
trouble."</p>

<p>"Maybe you have noticed," said Stuart, "I usually have a gun
when I meet him."</p>

<p>"If he wants to kill you badly enough he can always find ways
of doing it. You're in a poor situation."</p>

<p>"Say nothing about it," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"We'd better tell Camrose to quit playing cards at
Lestrade's."</p>

<p>"Let him find out for himself. He wouldn't believe us."</p>

<p>Stuart started to speak further, and forbore. Howison noticed
this and his thoughts briskly rummaged the relationships between
the various members of this group. Then he thought of Marta
Lestrade and he recalled the way George Camrose occasionally
watched her. Here was something else he had in his innocence
overlooked. He was about to mention it when he checked himself
with a definite feeling of embarrassment. The ground got thinner
and thinner under him as he recalled the friendship of Stuart and
Camrose, and Camrose's engagement to Lucy&mdash;and here another
possibility began to uncover itself&mdash;Stuart's friendship for
Lucy. Stuart's eyes were closely scanning him so that Howison had
the feeling that Stuart followed his reasoning. The big man's
face was barren, and that in itself was a warning. Howison
thought, "I've got to back out of this before we get worse
ground." Then he said aloud: "Better tell George to quit playing
poker. He lost a hell of a lot of money the other night at
Hobart's. Thackeray's got his note for five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"I didn't know that," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"For a man whose business is handling money, he's too
careless."</p>

<p>Henry Clenchfield came in and Stuart surrendered the high
stool to him. "No grubstakes so far this morning," said Stuart,
and turned to the doorway. Sunlight ran fresh and fine through
the town, flashing against window panes, cutting long, sharp
shadows against the dust, and brightening the dust's velvet-gray
carpet. Stuart tilted his hat against this sun, cast a glance
down the street and presently wheeled back into the store. He
lifted his revolver from the holster kept on a peg near the
doorway&mdash;snugged it in his waistband beneath his coat, and
walked out again.</p>

<p>The scene arrested the attention of both Clenchfield and
Howison. The latter immediately stepped through the doorway to
have a look.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Clenchfield.</p>

<p>"Bragg," said Howison and stood watching the street.</p>

<p>Stuart moved east on the street, passing Ling Corson who was
at the moment sweeping out his saloon; the outcoming air of the
deadfall made a stagnant pool in the fresh smell of the day.
Bragg was near the foot of the street and now walked forward at a
rolling gait, his whole body made grotesquely formidable by the
great breadth of his shoulders. His shirt collar lay open,
exposing the dense hair which matted his chest. He kept his eyes
on Stuart and he had pulled his lips away from his teeth in a
kind of smile. He stopped at a distance of ten feet. He said,
"Hello," and his eyes ran up and down Stuart's shape with a close
attention. "You're up early."</p>

<p>"What's on your mind, Honey?"</p>

<p>Honey Bragg gave out his short half laugh and wrinkles sprang
around his temple corners as his eyes grew narrow. He was sly and
unpredictable and his impulses might carry him in any direction,
and these impulses were working on him now, behind the spurious
humor. Stuart saw them shuttle back and forth on the man's face
and make faint changes on the fleshy lips. Then Bragg lowered his
cropped bullet head and momentarily stared at the ground. Wind
ran strongly in and out of him and the muscles of his arms
stirred beneath the flimsy shirt. Stuart noticed the black tufts
of hair growing above the man's wrist bones. Then Bragg's head
lifted swiftly to show the heat running through him, urging him,
making him restless. Brutality throbbed in the man&mdash;and that
too was a sign on his face. Almost anything would make him jump
into a fight, Stuart guessed.</p>

<p>"Let's have a drink," suggested Bragg.</p>

<p>"Too early," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"Well," said Bragg, "I'm thirsty, early or not." But he
remained still, half inclined to fight, half inclined to be
cautious. Stuart reached into his pocket and got out his pipe and
tobacco. He filled the pipe and lighted it, and felt the steady,
strong beat of his heart; it was a sound back of his ears and a
steady drumming in the middle of his belly. Honey Bragg's stare
was a continuing thing, the laughter abating, the pressure
increasing. Only a small thread of caution restrained the man,
and now he beat at Stuart with his eyes, watching for weakness
that would set him into motion.</p>

<p>Logan took a long drag on his pipe and removed it. He tapped
out the ashes and put the pipe in his pocket. He had never liked
pressure from any man; the push of a man's hand, the sound of an
ill-meant word, the sight of hostile eyes&mdash;these things were
quick to rake him. He drew his teeth hard against his lips and
let Bragg see how things stood with him. Yet it occurred to him
that he was holding himself in more carefully than of an earlier
day. When he had been younger he would have spoken out at once.
He said, "Am I getting old, or am I afraid of this man?"</p>

<p>Bragg let go with his brief laugh. He said, "Well, a drink's a
drink," and moved around Stuart.</p>

<p>Stuart continued to the foot of the street, observing that men
had appeared from the town's houses to witness this scene.
Trouble was an odor that passed through any kind of wall and
shook men alive, swaying the educated and the ignorant
alike&mdash;for all men worshipped strength, even the gentle
minister who thought of righteousness as a sword to slay
evil.</p>

<p>He came to the long shed which was his mule barn and
storehouse and found Vane Blazier mending harness. The boy heard
him but held his head down as he worked. "Vane," said Stuart,
"you'll pull out for Salem in the morning with thirty packs.
Henry McLane has got a consignment there waiting for us."</p>

<p>"All right," said Blazier.</p>

<p>Stuart walked through the shed, appraising the piled-up goods;
some of this stuff would be all right when rain and snow came,
but the rest of it needed to be put into the store for
protection. He said, "Hitch up the wagon," and he thought to
himself, "I'll have to keep Vane under sight today. Bragg may try
to break him up."</p>

<p>Presently Blazier backed the wagon into the shed and the two
of them fell to work loading and carting merchandise to the
store, and unloading. The town came alive and disturbed dust
trembled in the full sunlight. On the second trip to the shed
Stuart peeled off his coat and laid his revolver aside, drawing
Blazier's first direct glance. Blazier asked: "Bragg in
town?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"Don't buy any trouble on my account," said Blazier. He spoke
it in a voice which contained a small quality of offended pride.
Stuart straightened from his work.</p>

<p>"This is a matter which started before you came into it at
all."</p>

<p>"I can fight my own battles," insisted Blazier. He had a chip
on his shoulder; he was a young man thrown off his balance by
ideas that wouldn't let him alone.</p>

<p>"Vane," Stuart said, "if you've got something to talk out, let
it rip. You've been making a speech to yourself all morning."</p>

<p>Blazier threw Stuart a tough stare. "I can tell you this. She
don't like towns. She don't like big things. She don't like
movin' around or changin'. You'll run her from pillar to post. I
don't like it."</p>

<p>"It was her choice," pointed out Stuart, gently.</p>

<p>"It ain't right," said Blazier. "You're not the man for her.
You'll make her miserable. You don't look at her the way I do."
He stopped himself quite suddenly and walked from the shed.</p>

<p>Stuart sat silent on a box of goods. "That boy," he thought,
"loves her. Yet that's not the answer, for if she had felt the
same way toward him she would have taken him, not me." It was a
queer business&mdash;this confused wandering of people towards
things they wanted and could not have, this waste of hope, this
silent resignation to less than they wished. Nobody truly knew
anybody else. It was a world wherein people walked with their
desires and seldom attained them. But it was all in silence, held
away; and men walked soberly by other men, concealing themselves;
or laughed together, and held away their real thoughts.</p>

<p>Vane Blazier returned to the shed, and made a brief apology.
"I had no right to mix in your personal affairs."</p>

<p>Stuart said, "I am sorry the way it turned out for you." He
stood up and laid a hand on the boy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I'll have to swallow my medicine with less fuss," said
Blazier.</p>

<p>"Well, let's load boxes."</p>

<p>Joe Harms crouched on his heels at the base of Stuart's store
wall, half asleep under the sun, when Stuart came up with the
next load. Out of this motionless posture his warning softly
emerged:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bragg's up at Stutchell's deadfall."</p>

<p>The town had begun to fill up; the word was out, the word was
traveling. Making his backand-forth trips, Stuart watched the
audience grow and discreetly station itself at doorway, in
deadfall, and along the shaded building walls. Joe Harms, never
changing his position, issued his reports as Stuart came by.</p>

<p>"He went toward the creek, back of Howison's."</p>

<p>Stuart cooked his noon meal and afterwards lay on a row of
boxes in the store's main room with a cigar, making the most of
the hour. Clenchfield said: "The lads are bettin'."</p>

<p>"Where are the odds?"</p>

<p>"Against you," said Clenchfield. "Don't let him bruise you.
He'll get your eyes if he can. You remember Paul Gerritse, with
nothin' in his sockets but tears? Kill him and be done with
it."</p>

<p>Clenchfield was old and mild, yet here he was with first
instincts growling through him. Stuart watched his clerk and
marveled at that rejuvenation of a dry husk. Some things were
deeper than learning, some things broke the flimsy bindings of
civilized conduct. This was one of those things, and love of a
woman was another. What did it prove? A man was a mysterious
thing, knowing himself no better than he knew others; a fugitive,
a shadow, a being that knew greatness but made itself little out
of fear; man was a seed caressed by the sun and rain. Man was
anything he wanted to be. The winds at night whispered his
destiny to him and the sky beckoned him and all things in nature
conspired to make him big; but he would not be big. Stuart lay
quietly back, the taste of the cigar and the smell of the cigar
good to him.</p>

<p>George Camrose came hurriedly into the store, troubled and
with a thin sweat on his light face. "If Bragg had taken a drink
and gone back to his ranch, it would have been all right. But he
knows the crowd is watching him. He knows he can't back down the
second time."</p>

<p>"Henry," said Stuart, "go hunt up Blazier. I want him out of
Bragg's way."</p>

<p>Camrose said: "You'll have to stop him with a gun. You can't
match him with your fists."</p>

<p>"He knows that, too," said Stuart. "I can't use my gun if he
has none. And he'll not have one."</p>

<p>"Here's the town pushing it on. By God, I'm ashamed of the
human race!"</p>

<p>"It's better than that," said Stuart, carefully putting his
words together. "They've seen Bragg win his fights too long. It's
made them doubt there is such a thing as justice. They've got to
know if there is such a thing."</p>

<p>"So they're willing to see you cut to ribbons. Is that
justice?"</p>

<p>"They'd rather see me cut up than see the idea lost," said
Stuart. He rose, watching Clenchfield pass out through the door
to the street. "George," he said, "how can you afford to lose
five hundred dollars?"</p>

<p>Camrose stared at him with a moment's embarrassment. Then it
passed away, leaving him watchful. "If I couldn't afford to lose
it, I wouldn't be playing, would I?"</p>

<p>"You can't afford it if you give out I.O.U.'s."</p>

<p>Camrose displayed a touchy temper. "I wish this town would
keep out of my business. It is a damned whispering gallery."</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said Stuart. "A lot of whispers can feed on five
hundred dollars. Jacksonville is wondering about a man in your
position losing at poker. You've got to watch yourself."</p>

<p>"Who spoke to you about it?" demanded Camrose, obviously
touched on a tender spot. Stuart, watching Camrose, saw him throw
up his guard; he saw a faint pulse of apprehension. George, he
thought to himself, had the thing on his mind, for he added:
"I've got a right to know."</p>

<p>"There are too many men thinking it's queer," said Stuart
bluntly.</p>

<p>"Do you think it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stuart.</p>

<p>He saw Camrose balance between anger and injured feeling; then
he watched this old friend inwardly shrink, and at that instant
Stuart knew more than he cared to know.</p>

<p>"Did it ever occur to you," said Camrose, "that I've played a
lot of poker, and may have built up a stake?"</p>

<p>"Your luck around this camp," said Stuart, "has been bad.
Everybody knows it."</p>

<p>A slack and sallow expression showed on Camrose's light
features, as though he had been struck in the stomach. "Is it
being said I've borrowed the money from the safe?"</p>

<p>Stuart said with a deliberate severity: "You had no other
place to get it. How much are you shy on your books?"</p>

<p>"If you think that about me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucy Overmire came into the store. She said "Gentlemen," in a
light voice and smiled at them. She was quick to observe the
preoccupation on Camrose's face. "Am I interrupting something?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"This isn't Saturday is it? The town seems full of men."</p>

<p>"I guess they all got lazy at once."</p>

<p>Johnny Steele stepped into the store. He said, "Logan,
he's&mdash;" Then, seeing Lucy, he ceased to talk. The girl was
now definitely aware of the unusual atmosphere; she ceased to
smile. "Is it Honey Bragg?"</p>

<p>"Where is he now, Johnny?" asked Camrose.</p>

<p>"At the foot of the street, leaning against the corner of your
place." Johnny Steele looked long and questioningly at Stuart.
"Everybody's expectin' you out there." He waited a moment and
added in a sharper voice: "You're goin' out there ain't you?"</p>

<p>"You got a bet on this, Johnny?" asked Stuart.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, a small one."</p>

<p>"Which way?"</p>

<p>"Why damn you, Logan, which way you think I'd bet?"</p>

<p>"Then I suppose I'd better go win it for you," said Stuart.
Camrose grumbled under his breath and walked from the room, with
Johnny Steele following. Stuart rose from the packing box. His
cigar had burned down to a stub and now he gave it a regretful
glance and dropped it on the floor; he put his shoe on it and
looked over to Lucy. He smiled slightly at her.</p>

<p>"Why can't they let you alone?" she demanded. "It's
cruel."</p>

<p>"Temporary cruelty. It will pass. That's better than things
which stick on and never quit hurting."</p>

<p>"Are you trying to tell me something?"</p>

<p>"It was just words," he said.</p>

<p>"You don't just talk words." It was the first time since the
night of the cabin raising she had looked at him with the old
familiar interest. That night had done away with an expression in
her eyes and it had taken a warmth out of her voice, as he had
wished. Even so, this moment brought some of that back and
revived in him the same sudden physical shock. He had never been
ashamed of that before; now, engaged to another woman, he
was.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd tell me what you have in your mind," she
said.</p>

<p>He saw Johnny Steele at the doorway, anxiously looking in.
Johnny expected something of him&mdash;as all this town
did&mdash;and his slowness disturbed Johnny and the town. "Lucy,"
he said, "stay in here," and walked to the door.</p>

<p>Johnny Steele said, "He went back to Stutchell's."</p>

<p>The sun was on the western side, throwing Stuart's shadow
before him as he walked toward the foot of the street; heat
warmed the back of his neck and the rich odor of dust was in his
nostrils. He passed Joe Harms and the dry little man stared at
him and the man's lips moved, saying something without force
enough to make it heard. Behind Stuart, at some distance, a man's
words were quite audible in the stillness. "He's goin' into
Stutchell's." Swinging into the place, it occurred to him the
town would be disappointed if this fight would finish and end
where it could not be seen.</p>

<p>The deadfall was a single-story log building thirty feet long
by fifteen wide&mdash;the roughest kind of place, cluttered by
chairs along the walls, a table in the center of the room and a
bar across one end. Stutchell was behind the bar and Honey Bragg
stood against it. He was half turned and therefore saw Stuart at
once; his fleshy mouth stirred slightly and a muscular reaction
rippled along his body, stiffening his shoulder. There was a
bottle and glass in front of Honey Bragg but it didn't appear to
Stuart that the man had been drinking very heavily during his six
hours in town.</p>

<p>Stuart spoke to Stutchell. "Put out a bottle for me,
Harry&mdash;a full one." Stutchell's breath ran short and fast
and fear made him pallid as he placed the bottle on the bar.
Stuart was sorry for the man and he said: "You want to stay in
here and watch this, Harry?" Stutchell said nothing.</p>

<p>During this short time Bragg had kept his round head half
lowered and his glance on Stuart. A half smile remained, lips
drawn back from his massive yellowed teeth; there seemed to be
some kind of amusement in the smile, Stuart thought. But
something else was in the smile as well&mdash;a saturnine
pleasure, a savage stain of expectancy. He spoke briefly to
Stuart. "I've got no gun. Put yours away."</p>

<p>"I'll keep it where it is."</p>

<p>Honey Bragg dropped his arm from the bar and made the
slightest turn. The strange, dancing smile was a bright screen
covering the lightless evil in him. He said, "Let's keep this
thing a fair fight. I've got nothing against you. It's the boys
that want the fun. Let's give 'em a good fight, no hard feelings
about it."</p>

<p>"What the hell are you lying for, Honey?"</p>

<p>"What have you got against me?" asked Honey Bragg, smooth and
inquisitive. "I blow off steam. I'm handy with my fists. But what
have you got against me?"</p>

<p>"You'd like to know exactly how much I know, wouldn't you?
It's been on your mind a long while. You'd feel a lot easier if
you could find out."</p>

<p>Honey Bragg's laugh ran short through the room. "Ah, you're
talking riddles to me, Logan." Then his head dropped until his
glance was half screened by his eyebrows, and all the good nature
left him. "What's in your mind?"</p>

<p>"The picture of a tree, you swinging from it."</p>

<p>It seemed enough to verify the man's suspicions. He drew a
gusty breath and let it fall; he stood dark and brutal before
Stuart. "You're making a mistake keepin' that gun on you. I've
got to figure you're going to use it. So I guess I have got to
break your neck before you get the chance. Stutchell, remember I
warned him. You hear, Stutchell?"</p>

<p>Stutchell murmured with a wholly frightened voice: "I
hear."</p>

<p>"Look at Stutchell," said Honey Bragg. "Look at him,
Logan."</p>

<p>Stuart's hands rested on the bar idly, close by the bottle he
had ordered. He turned his head half toward Stutchell, and then
swung it back in time to see Honey Bragg gather his thick body
together and jump forward. It was what Stuart had guessed the man
would do&mdash;and what he had ordered the bottle for. His hand
swept up the bottle by the neck. He stepped back to avoid Honey
Bragg's outstretching arms; he aimed the bottle at Bragg's round
head and brought it down, lifting on his toes to get force into
the blow. Launched in full attack, Bragg could do no better than
jerk his head slightly aside. The bottle struck him slantingly
above the ear and broke, and the ragged remnant scraped down the
side of his face, leaving its deep red track.</p>

<p>The steam went out of Bragg. He wheeled and seized the bar to
support himself; his mouth opened from the shock and he clung to
the bar, his face dull and his hand dropped. Stuart saw the man's
ear half torn away, hanging loosely down. Suddenly Stutchell was
yelling at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"You got him&mdash;you got him! Kill him now!" Jacksonville's
citizens were crowded at the door, staring in, and boots stumbled
around the deadfall as men sought to station themselves at the
windows for a fair view.</p>

<p>Stuart wheeled about and seized a chair. He raised it over his
head, watching Honey Bragg who should have been unconscious on
the floor but was not. This man was a burly brute with bones like
those of a grizzly, with an oxlike vitality. All his victories
came from this thick-shield of bone and muscle, this
insensitivity to injury. Bragg cursed as he came around; he was
alive and stung and dangerous as he pushed his legs apart. He saw
the chair come at him and raised his hands against it. The legs
of the chair struck him first and broke away; he went backward,
he swayed and brought his arms against his head. Stuart had the
remains of the chair in his hands&mdash;back and seat&mdash;and
he swung once more and caught Bragg on the head with the edge of
the seat. The sound of that blow went out from the deadfall,
clear enough to make men yell at it.</p>

<p>"You got him!" cried Stutchell. "Beat his brains out! Poke his
eyes out!"</p>

<p>Bragg said in a growling voice, "The hell I'm out. Stutchell,
I'll kill you." He turned his back to Stuart deliberately and
pulled his head down, making a shield of his back; he put
pressure on the bar with his arms and sidestepped to the corner
and he came around with a hard, grunting sound, propped against
the wall and waiting for his legs to hold him. Blood ran rich-red
down his cheek and his curly hair was wet with it; he shook his
head steadily to clear wool out of his brain, and through this
wool he peered patiently and blackly at Stuart. He was murmuring
in a coarse voice, in a voice made terrible by its conviction, by
its unchangeable intent. "That's all right, Logan. That's all
right. I'll get you in a minute. I'll put my arms around you and
I'll break your back. That's all right."</p>

<p>Stuart struck him again with the chair seat. Bragg took the
blow on a raised arm but the force of it sank him to the floor.
The chair fell apart in Stuart's hands and he walked away and got
another and came back, watching Bragg turn and seize the edge of
the bar with his hands and crawl erect. Suddenly Bragg whirled
and made an impetuous rush at Stuart. Stuart took a rapid step
aside and plunged one leg of the chair into Bragg's mouth,
crushing the man's lips and flinging him back upon the bar.
Bragg's vitality was a frightening thing; he had suffered badly,
he had taken blows which would have killed a frailer man, and yet
he remained erect, largely past the power of deliberate thought
but sustained by a sheer animal force. He held his odd grinding
tone: "That's all right, Logan. I'll get you in a minute. I am
goin' to get you on the floor and step on your guts and break
'em. That's all right, Logan." He seemed to be fighting off a
drowsiness. Logan lifted the chair and measured Bragg with the
coolest kind of attention; he feinted with the chair and he saw
Bragg's arm swing up in defense, and then he brought the chair
swinging down on that arm. He heard the bone snap and he saw the
chair break; he threw the chair aside. "Now we can close in,
Honey."</p>

<p>Bragg stared at his crippled arm. He moved his arm at shoulder
and elbow; he brought it up and saw the bend it made below the
elbow. He let it fall again and studied it as though he were a
distant spectator to something that puzzled him. He brought his
good hand slowly across the wreckage of his face. "You think I
won't do it, Logan?" he asked, and pushed himself away from the
bar, his good arm lifted.</p>

<p>This man was a bull, primitive and unchanging; his mind was
nothing but a pulpy core surrounding a single hunger&mdash;to
attack, to destroy. The fear of pain was not in him or, if it
was, the need to smash was so great that it destroyed pain. He
struck out with his good arm, strange sounds clogging his throat.
Stuart met his attack directly parrying the blow and stepping in
for a hard punch to Bragg's stomach.</p>

<p>Dull a man as he was, Bragg had a fighting slyness; he had not
put all his weight into the attack and now he wheeled and struck
again, catching Stuart flush on the mouth with his fist.</p>

<p>It was a disaster running down Stuart's spine. It seemed to
crack his neck and it sent a roar through his head. His eyes lost
focus, so that for a little while he could not see Bragg and
therefore he moved slowly away, with the smell of blood strong in
his nostrils. Bragg sensed his chance and rushed forward,
striking again. He missed a direct blow, came hard against Stuart
and rammed his knee into Stuart's belly. At this close distance,
Stuart flung an upward punch at Bragg's solid chin; he lifted
himself to get weight into the blow and he felt the shock
register on the nerves of his arm. Bragg's head tilted back; he
began moving away, weaving as he moved, waving his heavy arm
before him like a stick. Stuart went at him, driving the arm
down. He hit Bragg in the flank, he struck under the burly man's
heart, he drove a blow hard into the pit of Bragg's stomach and
saw the man's face grow loose. Bragg, in retreating, at last got
his back to the bar and once more his slyness came to his rescue.
Sliding aside along the bar, he raised a foot and plunged it into
the lower part of Stuart's belly.</p>

<p>It sent Stuart backward off balance. He struck the small table
in the center of the room, and fell with the table dropping on
him. He rolled again, knowing himself in great danger, and he saw
Bragg rush to the nearest wall and seize up a chair with his one
good arm. Bragg yelled, "By God, I got you!" Bragg stumbled
forward and tried to kick the obstructing table aside. He failed
and, yelling again, he threw the chair with all the strength left
in him.</p>

<p>Stuart rolled, hearing the chair smash beside him. He kept
rolling and sprang up, and wheeled away as Bragg charged him.
Bragg struck the saloon's end wall and slowly came around. Stuart
was in the middle of the room waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Time to put out the lights, Honey," he said, and lifted
another chair.</p>

<p>Stutchell stood pale and numb in a corner, cringing against
the logs. Honey Bragg suddenly became aware of his presence and
turned and struck him to the floor with one blow. Bragg kicked at
him and drew Stutchell's scream; at this moment Stuart brought
the chair fairly down on Bragg's head and shoulders and stunned
him. With the chair jammed over his head, Bragg dropped and
slowly tried to free himself. His breathing had grown hoarse and
heavy and he kept murmuring to himself as he worked. Finally he
got the chair away from him and he sat on the floor, staring out
of eyes that were filmed with blood; he tried to clear them with
his hand. His vision remained bad and then he began to groan and
to talk to himself as he turned to the wall and rose. He faced
the wall, scarcely knowing it; he cocked his fist and struck the
wall.</p>

<p>"Not there," said Logan.</p>

<p>"Come up to me," said Bragg, turning about. "Come up and make
it even. Come on."</p>

<p>Stuart walked over the room, watching Bragg's arm draw back.
He feinted at Bragg and drew a last blow from the man; then he
stepped in and beat Bragg on the side of the face, swinging this
bloody, indestructible hulk slowly around. Bragg touched the wall
again and bent his head against it, wholly exhausted and wholly
helpless.</p>

<p>"Come around, Honey," said Stuart. "I haven't started working
on your eyes yet."</p>

<p>Bragg wheeled to the door and found it blocked by
Jacksonville's men. He said in a heavy voice, "Get out of my
way." The crowd backed off from it to give Bragg all the
clearance he wanted. "Damn dogs," he said. "Damn yellow dogs." He
had his head down and so saw the prone Stutchell. He kicked
Stutchell again and left the deadfall.</p>

<p>Stuart followed him down the narrow lane of miners as the
latter moved at a drunken, ambling pace toward his horse near
Howison's hay barn.</p>

<p>Once Bragg turned about and for a moment it appeared that he
intended making another stand, but he shook his head and swung
off when Stuart closed on him; and continued to his horse. He
untied the reins and put a foot in the saddle; he gripped the
pommel with his good arm and made two false tries before he
reached the saddle; and here he sat, drenched in his own blood,
with his ear flapping against his cheek and the broken aperture
of his mouth revealed as he sucked hungrily at the warm afternoon
air. He looked down at Stuart with his hurts beginning to show on
him, with his agony starting; even so, the primitive cunning
still pulsed in his mind and treachery still lived in him. Stuart
drew his gun and pointed it at Bragg.</p>

<p>"Don't try to run me down."</p>

<p>Bragg let the half-lifted reins go loose. "You know what I'm
going to do?"</p>

<p>"I know what you'll try, soon as you're able."</p>

<p>"I'll close your mouth for good," said Bragg in a dead soft
voice. "I'll catch you. There's a thousand places to catch you.
I'll catch you."</p>

<p>"By the bend of the river, Honey?"</p>

<p>Bragg gave him a steady stare. "That might be a good place,"
he said, and turned the horse, walking it slowly from town with
his broken arm swinging at his side.</p>

<p><br> <br> Weariness deadened Stuart as he walked up the
street. The nerves of his arms began to ache violently and his
mouth hurt him. Part of the crowd began to move with him toward
the store and voices came at him with hearty approval. A man
slapped him on the back and he looked up to see Johnny Steele
talking. "It was good it was good," said Johnny. "Nothing like it
ever was or ever will be."</p>

<p>"That's fine, Johnny," said Stuart. "Now you can collect your
bet."</p>

<p>Steele understood him; he felt the force of the remark and he
went silently along a little distance thinking about it. At last
he lifted his head and made his defense, which in a way was a
defense for the camp as well. "Maybe it seems hard to you," said
Steele, "but we've seen the day when Bragg was licked. It wasn't
a day we thought we'd ever see. That's something, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I guess that's something, Johnny," agreed Stuart and passed
into the store. Lucy was at the doorway, turned stiff by her
watching; her face was harsh and the harshness was slow to
dissolve as she looked at him. He went by her, to the rear room;
he sat down on the edge of his bed and reached for his pipe. He
filled and lighted it and took a drag of smoke and pulled it away
with a sudden distaste. The smoke burned in the cuts of his lips.
He bent over and propped his head on his hands and stared at the
floor, bracing himself against the waves of pain which came in a
steady tide. He found himself tensing up as they arrived, and
relaxing momentarily when they went away. He had taken more blows
than he thought&mdash;and all of them were harsh ones; he would
have been a mass of beaten pulp had he not crippled Bragg at the
beginning. He felt low and dispirited: he felt disgusted at
himself, he felt dirty. "I'm old enough not to roll in the dust
like a mongrel," he thought.</p>

<p>Lucy came quietly into the room. She put her hand under his
chin and drew it up until she had a full view of his face and he
saw her eyes travel over his face carefully. She still had that
frozen, repressed expression. "You'll have to go to Dr. Balance."
Suddenly she sat down beside him on the bed and put an arm around
him, drawing his head against her shoulder. "Logan," she said,
"Oh, Logan!"</p>

<p>"Never mind," he said. "It will pass."</p>

<p>"He'll be at you again. Why didn't you kill him?"</p>

<p>Camrose shouted across the length of the store and came
rapidly on. He stopped at the room's doorway and observed the
scene. He said quickly: "How bad is it?"</p>

<p>"Not bad enough to die," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"Bad enough," said Lucy, and held her arm in its place. She
looked up at Camrose. "Is the town happy? Are you all
pleased?"</p>

<p>"Why, Lucy," said Camrose, "I never pushed this thing."</p>

<p>Lucy rose and moved to the door. "You ought to heat up a tub
of good hot water and sit in for an hour. It will take the
soreness from your body. George, start up a fire. Bring him up to
the house when he's through."</p>

<p>Camrose said, "All right," and then thought of something else.
"What was that you said to Bragg about the bend of the Rogue? If
you know something, you'd better turn it over to somebody before
you're shot off your horse."</p>

<p>Lucy left them. Stuart listened to her steps cross the floor,
and then he raised his head and said, "Shut the door, George."
Camrose turned and gave the door a push.</p>

<p>"Now," said Stuart, "how much have you borrowed from the
safe?"</p>

<p>The question caught Camrose off guard. He met Stuart's dark
stare with a sudden irritation. "That's my business."</p>

<p>"No, it is not. It is the business of the company whose money
you've borrowed. It is also the business of the girl you propose
to marry. You have got a habit of fooling yourself."</p>

<p>"Nothing's out of the way," said Camrose stubbornly.
"Everything's all right."</p>

<p>Stuart rose and felt the fresh leap of pain in his body; it
shortened his temper. "Nothing's all right. The money in that
safe is trust money. You had no right to touch it. The moment you
touch it, even if it is only for fifteen minutes, you've got
yourself on the wrong track."</p>

<p>"Are you suggesting I'm crooked?" asked Camrose with growing
antagonism.</p>

<p>"I'm saying it, not suggesting it. You have got to quit poker
cold and you have got to quit wishing for easy money. If you do
not, you'll wind up with an empty safe and a charge of
embezzlement against you. Either you'll be in jail or you'll be a
fugitive."</p>

<p>"Here, here," said Camrose, "I can't let that
stand&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stuart brought the flat of his hand hard against Camrose's
chest, knocking his friend against the closed door. "By God, you
laugh at too many things, you take too many things easy. There's
an end to that. You've got yourself half argued into stealing.
That's plain enough, isn't it? Stop trying to excuse
yourself."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said Camrose in a cool, furious tone.</p>

<p>"You're always sliding away. You've always got an excuse,
you've always got a smile or a shrug of your shoulder. You think
you can tell this to Lucy and smile it away? You think she'll
smile it away?"</p>

<p>Camrose moved to a window and put his back to Stuart. He kept
his back stiff, making it express his outrage. "Logan," he said
at last, over his shoulder, "how long have you known this about
me?"</p>

<p>"Six months or better."</p>

<p>"You haven't got a high opinion of me, have you?"</p>

<p>"How much are you short?" said Stuart.</p>

<p>"Two thousand."</p>

<p>Stuart opened the door and walked into the storeroom.
Clenchfield sat bowed over the high desk, making it quite obvious
that he was busy with his own chores. Stuart said, "Give me two
thousand, Henry," and he waited at the counter while Clenchfield
counted it out. Stuart looked straight at Clenchfield and said,
"A grub-stake, Henry."</p>

<p>"So it is," said Clenchfield and added nothing to that.</p>

<p>Stuart went back to the rear room with the gold in his
pockets. He dumped the coins on the table. "That's my opinion of
you, George."</p>

<p>He saw pride form its refusal in George Camrose's eyes; then
he saw something get at that pride and bend it. He stood there,
bound by friendship to this man, yet a spectator to the easy and
plaint and half-cynical workings of Camrose's nature. He knew the
smile so well when at last it came, charming and smooth in the
way it washed everything away.</p>

<p>"All right, Stuart. You were always the Puritan. You don't
understand the Cavalier."</p>

<p>"Speeches are no good. Stand up and do the right thing. You
know what it is."</p>

<p>A few moments before it would have invoked George Camrose's
anger; but now Camrose was in the full swing of his new mood. "I
know," he said cheerfully. "I shall set it straight. There never
was any evil in it, but I shall clear it up." He put the money
into his pockets, achieving a kind of disinterested air and thus
making the gift less important than it was. "Now," he said, "you
are going to tell me to play no more poker."</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"I shall do it," said Camrose. "Though it will be a damned
dull world."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with this world? It's big enough for you isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"The voice of the Puritan again. Coming to the house for
supper?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Lucy will give me hell," said Camrose and went away. He
passed Clenchfield without giving the clerk a glance; he was
acutely aware of the man's possible knowledge of him, but he
walked straight on, got to the street and turned toward Hobart's
deadfall, finding George Thackeray idle at a table.</p>

<p>"I'll take up that I.O.U. now," he said to Thackeray.</p>

<p>Thackeray thrust a hand into his pocket. "Flush tonight?"</p>

<p>"Flush enough."</p>

<p>"How about a little game?"</p>

<p>Camrose considered the matter, negligently accepting the note
and tearing it across. "George," he said, "I like poker. I'd
rather play a game of poker than eat. Yet in my job I'm supposed
to be like Caesar's wife."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"Above reproach&mdash;above suspicion."</p>

<p>"It's a free country," said Thackeray. "Man can do what he
damned pleases."</p>

<p>"When a man handles money as a business, he's got to be
careful."</p>

<p>"Suppose we play at my cabin&mdash;nothing said and everything
quiet."</p>

<p>"That's better," said Camrose, and turned from the deadfall.
The weight was off his mind, and he felt entirely cheerful.
Thackeray was disposed of and Stuart's loan would permit him to
replace his borrowings from the safe. Then he thought: "If I get
in that game tonight and a good hand comes up I ought to have
enough cash in my pocket to push my luck. Six good hands in the
course of an evening would set me up." So, with that decision
made, he walked toward the Overmire house.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER 8. &mdash; AT THE
CREEK</h2>

<p class="first">AT ten o'clock that night George Camrose walked
from Thackeray's cabin and felt the warm night's air to be quite
cold against his face. He ran a hand along his forehead,
squeezing away the oil-sweat, and he spoke to himself with a dull
bitterness: "I'll never learn to let well enough alone." He had
lost his cash, and Thackeray held his note for another thousand.
All of them at the poker table had looked at him in a rather odd
way when he rose to leave. They would be wondering how he could
stand those losses, and they wouldn't keep it a matter of
confidence forever. The camp would presently know the story; in
due time Stuart would know it.</p>

<p>He walked into Hobart's deadfall and downed two substantial
drinks of whisky; he heard a man call his name and turned to
discover Mack McIver grinning at him&mdash;that same McIver who
was supposed to be down the Applegate prospecting. He said,
"Hello, Mack," and gave the man a smile, but a loose sensation
rushed through him and he grew confused as he thought of McIver's
gold poke lying half empty in the office safe.</p>

<p>"No luck," said McIver. "I just wore out my shoe leather.
Let's have a drink."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Camrose, "but I've got to go see Stuart."</p>

<p>McIver said, "Well, I'm going to get drunk. See you
tomorrow."</p>

<p>Camrose walked into the soft night, remembering Mclver's last
phrase. He got out a handkerchief and scrubbed his forehead. He
thought: "Does guilt show on a man's face, or is it something he
always imagines? God damn Thackeray! How did the bets get so high
so fast?" He saw Joe Harms seated in his cramped position before
Howison's shed and passed the man without speaking and unlocked
his office door. He barred the door behind him and cast a glance
at the shutters. It had never been like this before&mdash;never
this trapped sensation, this incoherent back-and-forth shuttling
of his thoughts, this morbid self-condemnation, this physical
sickness in his stomach.</p>

<p>He knew to an ounce how much he had taken from Mclver's poke;
yet he opened the safe and got out the poke and weighed it. Then
he counted the company's gold coins stacked on the upper shelf.
He closed the safe and stood back with both elbows hooked on the
counter. "He'll be here first thing tomorrow for his poke. As for
the gold coin, I've got a week or two before anything could
happen." Then he was struck by the coincidence of two miners
within the last few days coming to reclaim their gold dust. Was a
grapevine rumor going through the camp about him?</p>

<p>He left the office, locking the door behind him, and turned
toward the Lestrade cabin. He thought he heard some kind of noise
to the rear and turned sharply about, but he discovered nothing
in the black shadows. "I'm in a hell of a position," he told
himself, and with all this on his mind he knocked at the Lestrade
door and heard Marta's subdued voice invite him in.</p>

<p>She was in the rocking chair by the fire; she looked up at him
with the usual engraved darkness on her face, the usual shadows
in her eyes. Camrose closed the door and put his back to it. He
said: "Where's Jack?"</p>

<p>"Riding," she said.</p>

<p>"Always riding," he commented. "Balance or Howison show up
tonight?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "How is Logan?"</p>

<p>"Battered."</p>

<p>"Somebody ought to shoot Bragg," she said with a lift of
resentment in her voice.</p>

<p>He gave her a closer glance. "You like Logan pretty well.
Wonderful thing to have people like you."</p>

<p>"Natural people are always liked," she said. "We're all
natural are we not? I'm natural, am I not?"</p>

<p>She turned the subject. "You look pale. Don't you feel
well?"</p>

<p>"Well enough," he said. But he thought to himself: "It shows
on me," and the chill sensation went through him again.</p>

<p>She rose from the rocker and stood gracefully against the
wall, and continued to observe him. He was aware of the blend of
softness and hot desires in this woman, the emotions capable of
so much violence and yet held under such rigid control.</p>

<p>"You seldom smile, Marta. Why not?"</p>

<p>"George, could I say something to you?"</p>

<p>He thought quickly, and with elation, "She's making the first
advance," and he moved toward her. She shook her head at him.
"Stay there. You've tried to read things in the way I've looked
at you. The things you think you see," she said quietly, "are not
there. You have got Lucy. What more could you want? Why should
you try to be adventurous?"</p>

<p>"I need your friendship," he said quickly. "That's not what
you have been thinking," she said.</p>

<p>He showed color. "Have I been that crude?"</p>

<p>"You're greedy and you're unfaithful. Don't come here any
more."</p>

<p>He said: "Are you afraid to have me near you?" He closed the
distance and he got his arms around her. He felt her suddenly
resist him, but he dropped his head and kissed her&mdash;and
stepped back. Her expression hadn't changed, but her voice was
hard.</p>

<p>"You're a fool."</p>

<p>"I think," he said resentfully, "you have used your eyes on me
at times." Then he felt cold and desperate and trapped. "Marta,
we've been friends a long while. Why should it change?"</p>

<p>"Balance and Neil and Logan have been friends also. But have
you noted they don't come any more?"</p>

<p>Now he was alert and suspicious. "Why not?"</p>

<p>"Good night," she said, "and don't come again."</p>

<p>"Here," he began. "I'd like&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was stopped by the cold repulsion on her face. It
astonished him that so much force of character could come from
this softly-tempered woman. He had the feeling as he opened the
door and looked back to her that he was involved in a mystery of
which he knew little; and in this frame of mind he closed the
door and walked quite slowly toward the center of the town.</p>

<p>She listened to his steps die away. Afterwards she turned to
the fire and sat in the rocker, crouched forward in a strained
and tense attitude and staring at the heart of the flame. "The
story will be the same here as it has been elsewhere," she
thought. "But at least Lucy won't be hurt."</p>

<p>Lestrade sat in the smoky light of Bragg's cabin and watched
the bearlike man with an interest that had no sympathy in it. The
other three riders, all stray figures out of nowhere, stood by,
likewise silent and curious and unmoved. Somewhere distant in
Lestrade's mind was a keen side-thought concerning this. "Hell of
a thing for a man to be so much of a savage that nobody gives a
damn."</p>

<p>Bragg lay on the bed, full of pain. Balance had been here
earlier, before Lestrade's arrival, to set the broken arm and to
perform rude surgery on the cut ear; but there was nothing much
to be done about the splintered front teeth or the torn lips.
These had swollen, making his face incredibly ugly. He had taken
a terrible beating but, after the manner of his kind of man, he
was fortified now by a pride at his own endurance. "Can't kill a
fellow like me," he murmured. Pain caused him to move his feet
along the bed; it made him slow and thickheaded.</p>

<p>"I told you to keep away from him," said Lestrade. "Now you're
laid up for God knows how long. It plays hell with our business."
He had been cautious on previous occasions before Bragg's three
followers; he seemed unconcerned now. "What was the remark he
made about the river? He's got it on you, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"What?" said Honey, his eyelids creeping together.</p>

<p>"Would it be that pair of fellows bound for California last
winter? The two found dead in the creek willows?"</p>

<p>He watched Honey's face closely and witnessed the little
changes of expression. He grinned at Bragg. "Once in a while you
let your foot slip. You're smart enough up to a certain point.
After that you're a damned bear running wild without brains.
You'll be lucky if you don't get chased out of Jacksonville. Or
hung."</p>

<p>Bragg softly and cautiously framed a single word on his lips.
"Wait."</p>

<p>"You're thinking of Stuart," said Lestrade. "If you killed
him, you'd have to run for it. This town likes him. They'd string
you up in a hell of a hurry."</p>

<p>Honey shook his head. "It won't do. He knows more than I
like."</p>

<p>Lestrade said: "What else does he know?"</p>

<p>Honey made a pointing motion to himself and then to Lestrade.
The latter said with challenging tone: "About us? How would he
know? And how do you know he does?"</p>

<p>"That draws you, don't it?" said Bragg. He was sharp enough to
witness the changed manner it produced in Lestrade and he enjoyed
what he saw. "Different now, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"You'd like to get me in deeper, wouldn't you Honey?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're deep enough. High-tones like you make me laugh. I
can take care of myself in trouble. Can you?"</p>

<p>"We'll both take care of ourselves," said Lestrade smoothly.
"Let Stuart have his fun. We'll be doing business here for quite
a while yet."</p>

<p>Bragg said: "Find out when he's going to take another load of
dust to Portland."</p>

<p>Lestrade left the cabin, got on his horse and wound through
the willows. Reaching the trail, he paused a moment to look back
at Bragg's cabin lights, and then he moved on. But he had stopped
long enough for a lone-watching man, crouched not ten feet way,
to identify him. Johnny Steele, slowly grown suspicious of George
Camrose, had come here to see if Camrose had secret connections
with Bragg; and now he had discovered this other thing. He sat
still, listening to Lestrade's horse drum away. "Why," he
thought, "the man's a plain crook. That's why his wife was
crying. She knows it." He turned it over and over in his mind.
"Bragg and Lestrade. And maybe Camrose, too. Well, I'll find
out."</p>

<p>Lestrade put up his horse and went into the cabin to find his
wife before the fire.</p>

<p>"Anybody been here?"</p>

<p>"Camrose. I sent him away."</p>

<p>"You should be kind to our customers, Marta. He's been a good
meal ticket." He grinned at her and moved to the wall cupboard
for the whisky bottle. "Bragg took the worst beating I ever saw.
He's badly cut up."</p>

<p>"Good," she said. "Good."</p>

<p>He gave her a side glance and drank the whisky in one long
gulp. "It's odd that none of the other boys have been here for a
week."</p>

<p>"Is it so odd?"</p>

<p>He straightened and gave her a penetrating glance; he stood
still, with a thoughtfulness coming to him. "Where have I
revealed myself, Marta?"</p>

<p>"People sense things like that. We'd better leave before they
really know. I'd like to leave a few decent memories behind
me."</p>

<p>"I thought it was my safety you were worrying about." He moved
into the adjoining room, presently calling to her in his lightly
skeptical way. "At times I have thought you might be fond of
Camrose."</p>

<p>"He is a weak man," she said.</p>

<p>"Marta, is there any man in this town you look upon with
desire?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me that?"</p>

<p>He came rapidly out of the other room and caught her arm and
pulled her from the rocker.</p>

<p>His face was rough with temper. "You didn't answer my
question." He drew her forward and kissed her; then he stepped
back to look upon the unyielding calm of her face.</p>

<p>"Even when you loved me," he said, "you also hated me. You can
hurt a man merely by not speaking to him. I feel your judgment
now. It is disillusioned, it is condemning. Would it be possible
to change it&mdash;to start over again?"</p>

<p>"You could not change," she said.</p>

<p>"Am I as weak as Camrose&mdash;is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"Let's not talk about it."</p>

<p>His one revealing moment passed on and he pulled himself
behind his covering skepticism. "I presume it is too late," he
said quietly, and stood silent a long while, watching her and
wondering about her. "Did you ever stop to think how close heaven
is for all of us&mdash;and yet how far it is when we lift our
hands to touch it?"</p>

<p><br> <br> Camrose strolled up the street, noting that Joe
Harms had at last abandoned the seat in front of Howison's
stable. This was now near midnight, with the deadfalls still
active; otherwise the lamps of the town had begun to wink out one
by one, and miners were slowly walking toward their cabins and
tents and brush shacks along the creek. There was a light in the
rear of Logan Stuart's place, and Camrose stopped at the front of
the store, with his problem going around and around in his head.
The thing seemed to be turning him unreasonable; he kept jumping
at the same blind barriers, running up the same alleys of hope
and finding the same futile endings. How was he to make up his
losses? How was he to take care of McIver's half-emptied gold
poke? What was he to say to Logan Stuart when the latter
discovered what had become of the loaned money?</p>

<p>He looked toward the Overmire house and observed a light still
shining from the window. "If I had only played it safe when I had
the chance." Now it was that he realized how dangerous a game he
played&mdash;and the fatal consequences of that game; he passed a
hand across his forehead and gave out a small, soft groan. "God,
if I could just turn the page back!"</p>

<p>A party of miners came from Hobart's all drunk, and stood
noisy and contentious in the street until at last one man pulled
away and walked east toward Howison's. One of the others called
after him. "Where you goin', Mack?"</p>

<p>It was McIver, ragged and round-shouldered against Hobart's
lights. McIver barely was able to keep on his feet. He yelled: "I
am goin' to hide in the brush before the Injuns jump this
camp."</p>

<p>George Camrose's heart began to beat harder against his ribs
as he watched McIver weave along the dust. The rest of the miners
were loudly debating the wisdom of going after McIver; they were
debating Indians. Then the group turned in the other direction
and at last drifted into another deadfall. McIver was a shadow
down by Howison's, still traveling on.</p>

<p>Camrose put a hand to the gun he always carried inside the
trouser band, and a dizzy feeling came upon him and coldness
filled his belly. He drew shorter and quicker breaths and he
turned, stepping along the building walls in McIver's direction.
Then he stopped and looked closely around the street, and
suddenly moved between buildings to the rear of town and rapidly
made his way to his own office. Here he came upon the dark street
again, and heard McIver threshing around the brush, farther on.
He heard McIver say to himself: "I'm too smart."</p>

<p>Camrose found himself walking fast on the balls of his feet;
he found himself crouching and trying to make himself smaller. He
kept looking around him, he kept listening. He drew his revolver
as he got nearer McIver. Then he stopped and stared at the street
behind him and he was saying to himself: "A cave-in, a bullet or
an Indian will get him sooner or later. What's the difference how
he dies?" Far away in his brain there was a protest and a
warning; but by now the wave of desperateness had pushed him too
far and he resumed his stalking.</p>

<p>He heard McIver's boots grind along the creek gravel and he
saw McIver's shadow sink into the night; then he heard McIver
making sucking sounds as the miner lay belly-flat and drank the
creek water. Camrose quickly slid the revolver back under his
trouser band and crossed the gravel strip with a catlike
quickness. He made some sound as he came upon McIver. He dropped
on McIver, plunging his knees into the man's back as the latter
tried to turn and lift himself from the water; he flattened
himself on McIver's violently agitated body and he laid his
forearm on the back of the man's neck and forced his head down
into the water and against the gravel. He fought against McIver's
great muscular spasms and he felt them grow smaller; he heard the
strange frothy bubbling of water come up from McIver's
mouth&mdash;that sound so grisly and unnatural that it sickened
and weakened him. It wasn't long. Lying on top of McIver he
presently felt all motion and life go out, and when he knew he
had at last killed a man he rose up and plunged back into the
darkness, striking a tree in his blind fright. That stopped him
and for a little while he stood still while a great shuddering
tide of terror had its way with him. A little later he crept to
the rear of the office, got into his own bachelor's quarters and
there in the complete darkness he lay on the bed and reviewed his
actions&mdash;testing them for error and the chance of
discovery.</p>

<p>The cold feeling was in his stomach again, and now he realized
it would always be there.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER 9. &mdash; THE SEEDS OF
DOUBT</h2>

<p class="first">JOHN TRENT and Burl McGiven left Jacksonville by
early morning with thirty Stuart mules, bound for Crescent City.
Stuart had not intended leaving town that day but the sound of
the lead mare's bell was a stroke of restlessness through the
quiet dawn, to remind him of the bright sun upon the land, the
cool lanes of timber, and the motion of the horse beneath him. By
noon the temptation was too great; he went at once to the barn
for his horse and by six reached the Dances' and joined them at
the supper table.</p>

<p>"Where bound?" asked Dance.</p>

<p>"Just riding."</p>

<p>"You're a movin'-around man," said Mrs. Dance.</p>

<p>Dance stroked his rusty beard and showed his cherry lips as he
laughed. "The hound that rustles always gets the best
rabbit."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dance considered the remark calmly. "True enough. Men
that sit around the house are mostly shiftless. Still, there are
hounds always thin and hungry from running too much." Dance
winked at Stuart. "Aimed at you."</p>

<p>The sun disappeared from a still and fragrant land; and the
earth seemed to pause for a brief period before it went rolling
massively down into the pit of night. Afar, Dance's ranging
hounds found scent and their voices came back in bounding,
musical echoes. Caroline, sweetly filled with her silence, rose
and lighted the lamps of the room. Coming around the table, she
refilled Stuart's coffee cup and remained near him, her hip
touching his shoulder as she looked down on the black and heavy
surface of his hair; her eyes grew blacker. Dance's shrewd eyes
frankly looked upon that scene. "Possession," he said, and let
his laugh ring out.</p>

<p>The boys were up and away, lean and restless, and soon out of
sight. Dance went to the door and watched them disappear. He
called at them: "Take a look a Goose Canyon before you come
back." Caroline and Mrs. Dance were at the dishes, but presently
Mrs. Dance gave her daughter a shake of the head. "Do you think
Logan came up here to see you work?"</p>

<p>Caroline removed her apron and came over the room at Logan;
she touched his arm and drew him up and went out of the house
with him. Darkness had suddenly come. There was a small wind and
the odor of dust and thicket and dry meadow stubble was a heavy
blend in the shadows. They paced together along the trail.</p>

<p>"Now, Logan," she murmured, "whom did you fight?"</p>

<p>"Bragg."</p>

<p>"He's a great bully. I hate the sight of him. I'd rather trust
a Rogue." She let that subject drop, but she was more than
usually talkative this night, and spoke again. "Logan, where are
we to live?"</p>

<p>"You don't like Jacksonville, do you?"</p>

<p>She gave him a sober answer. "I will live where you wish to
live. If it is to be Jacksonville, I'll be happy. Will it always
be Jacksonville?"</p>

<p>"My business will always go where trade is. I do not know
where that will be ten years from now."</p>

<p>She had, he realized, hoped for better news.</p>

<p>She hated change and uncertainty. "It will be Jacksonville as
long as possible," he added, but he realized that this was a poor
offering. "You don't like me riding away so much. It would be
better for you if I were farming."</p>

<p>"You're not the kind to farm. You like to reach out. You're
happy when you're moving around." She went on, slowly parting
with some of her longest-held notions. He knew it was a
tremendous struggle for her and when she said, "I'll be happy,
Logan," he stopped and kissed her. She came close upon him and
gripped his arms and he felt the impulsive fire of her emotions.
Then she stepped back and he saw that she was smiling.
"Everything will be nice," she said.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "when shall it be?"</p>

<p>"I have got nothing to wait for," she told him. "I'll wear my
mother's wedding dress. If we move to your store, we won't need
to build a cabin. There is nothing to delay us."</p>

<p>"Only one thing. I'm going to San Francisco to borrow
money."</p>

<p>The information surprised her. "Is there trouble?"</p>

<p>"None at all. I'm doing very well."</p>

<p>"What do you need to borrow for then?"</p>

<p>"It's like a young boy outgrowing his pants. The business goes
ahead so fast that I'm always strapped for ready cash to get
mules and supplies with."</p>

<p>She said, "I see," gravely, and sighed&mdash;and didn't
entirely see it. "When do you go and when will you be back?"</p>

<p>"I'll leave day after tomorrow. I should be back in two
weeks."</p>

<p>They were a quarter mile from the house when a shadow rose
from the nearby brush and the voice of one of the boys came at
them. "Wouldn't go that way. Rogues around here tonight." Stuart
turned Caroline about and they moved, now in silence, toward the
cabin's mellowed splash of window light. The wind softly roughed
up the leaves in the thicket and the smell of the land, rising
with the earth's dissipating heat, whirled in streaky currents
through the dark.</p>

<p>The main room of the cabin was empty when they returned.
Settling in a chair, Stuart heard the elder Dances murmuring
beyond the curtain in the extra room. He stretched out his legs
and lay back in the chair, watching the stove fire flicker
through the iron crevices.</p>

<p>"The Rogues been around here much this summer?"</p>

<p>She had taken up her darning basket and now sat half occupied
with her chore. "This is the first time since May." He watched
her square and pliable hands in deft motion; she was much as her
mother was&mdash;never wholly content unless busily filling in
each day, and sleeping content with that day well done, and
rising refreshed to take up the new day.</p>

<p>He lighted his pipe and he laced his hands behind his head and
closed his eyes. The teakettle sang and the mild heat of the
stove made him sleepy and the smells of the room&mdash;the
ancient household odors of a frontier cabin were all comforting.
In this cabin a man could make a lifetime's home and never know
unhappiness; and from this meadow and the hills about he might
find a living and a life rich as any that could come of cruising
the world over. To sleep in this warm and well-filled shelter, to
cruise the timber by day with his hounds baying down the timbered
reaches ahead of him, to stand in the door and watch the lean and
the restless travelers go by on their perpetual search, to grow
old without care and one night to drift out to space and the
silence beyond the stars&mdash;why wasn't this enough for any
man?</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and saw that Caroline watched him, her face
warmed by the close and pleasant world she was building for them
both. He knocked out his pipe and rose.</p>

<p>"If people would not change," she said in a wistful tone, "if
they would be content with what they had, if they would only see
how good each day is and never want for another day&mdash;" She
put the darning basket on the table and walked to the corner,
catching up a pair of quilts. She brought them back and when he
took them he saw the hunger behind her seriousness. He lifted the
blankets and threw them over her head and drew her forward; he
heard her laughing when he kissed her and then she whispered
something he didn't quite catch. He drew back. He said, "What was
that?"</p>

<p>She looked up to him, smiling and suddenly embarrassed. "To
the barn for you. The muley cow will keep you company." She made
a face at him and closed the door and stood before the stove a
little while, her face settling and losing its happiness.</p>

<p><br> <br> Early in the morning he started back toward
Jacksonville. He reached the Rogue and followed its silver
flashing for a matter of miles; and in this manner, moving
through a fair world, he was entirely content. "Little things
satisfy a man," he thought. "Great ambitions only disturb him."
Little things, like the sight of the river shallowly playing on a
gravel bed, like the lifting and falling of the horse beneath
him. He had Caroline in his mind for a while, wondering about her
and appreciating her; and then Lucy came to him quite
suddenly&mdash;as she so often did&mdash;and he was no longer
pleased with the day. "I ought to get the last hope of her out of
my system." It would be better when she was at last married to
Camrose. Then she would be entirely beyond his reach&mdash;and he
would no longer struggle with those furtive small hopes
concerning her. He thought, too, of George Camrose, and found
that subject not entirely pleasing; and so, with one thing and
another idling through his head, he came upon an area of willows
and passed into it. The patch was perhaps a hundred feet in
length and halfway through it he came unexpectedly upon four
young Rogue men standing silent on the trail. They had heard him
from a distance and they were waiting for him in this covered
place.</p>

<p>They wore moccasins and white men's pants and from the hips
upward they were bare, with stringy black hair indifferently
matted on their heads. They had a certain physical symmetry, but
less than some other tribes possessed. In the bony and coarse
contours of their faces was some kind of story of racial
intermixture or racial poverty; they had not the clean dignity of
the Sioux or the handsome openness of the Crow. Like the Klamaths
east of the mountains and like the tribes along the Coast, these
Rogues were undependable and faithless. One thing remained
constant in them: a vindictiveness toward their enemies either
white or red; now they were at peace according to
treaty&mdash;but a treaty meant nothing. They would rise again
when they saw a chance of success. Their nature was one of savage
inconstancy. These four all carried guns and looked upon him with
their half-veiled contempt. Since he traveled so frequently
through their country he realized they recognized him, yet they
gave him no sign. He reined in.</p>

<p>"Hello," he said.</p>

<p>They simply stared at him; and suddenly they looked at one
another, exchanging some signal. Then, all of them giving him a
hard and insolent survey, they swung deeper into the brush and
presently disappeared. He listened to their departure, urged on
his horse and came out to a meadow beside the river; presently
reaching Evan's Ferry, he crossed over.</p>

<p>"Four bucks back in that willow grove," he told the ferryman.
"They seem edgy."</p>

<p>"The chief of the Siskiyou band has been here visitin' and
talkin' trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, fall's here. It's fall and spring when they think of
trouble." He reached Jacksonville shortly after noon and from
Clenchfield he heard of Mack McIver's being found dead in the
creek.</p>

<p>"Apparently was drunk and fell in and drowned in six inches of
water."</p>

<p>"Henry," said Stuart, "I'm leaving for San Francisco tomorrow.
Ought to be back in fifteen days."</p>

<p>"Logan, lad, do you know you're walkin' around like a cat in a
cage?"</p>

<p>Stuart brought himself to a standstill. He grinned at
Clenchfield. "That's true. But don't I always move around?"</p>

<p>"You're worse. You can't stand still." The elderly man, seldom
stepping beyond his own defined bounds, now did so. "Poison can
be a liquid, a powder, a gas&mdash;or it can be somethin' in your
head. Whatever it may be, you'd best have it out."</p>

<p>Stuart stared at his clerk. There sat Clench-field, old and
dry, content to sleep and eat and spend his wakefulness at a
desk. Had he always been that way or had he, as a young man,
possessed a young man's fevered wants? Had the air once held its
wild smells to him, had a woman's face evoked for him the strains
of music and visions of beauty? Had he ever felt time's cruel
swiftness, or watched the stars and felt wonder? Was it that some
men never felt the keen lash of wanting; or was it that all men,
full of wanting, were slowly shriveled by age and disappointment
until they clung only to little comforts and stray bits of
security? Was there a memory in Henry Clenchfield which even now,
by its recollection, burned him; or were the memories of old men
gray and without heat, the lusts and beauties of life so
ephemeral as to be briefly felt and then to be forgotten?
Clenchfield said: "Do not rack yourself. Do not hope for things
which never are."</p>

<p>"Was there ever a time when you felt that there was a thing
just beyond the reach of your fingers which, by the stretching
out of a hand, you might seize?"</p>

<p>"It is never out there beyond your fingers. Do you know where
it is? It is here&mdash;" and Clenchfield reached up and touched
his head. "Man is a very strange creature, making images in his
mind and then rushing over this world to find that image
somewhere real. You had better take your beer small, for there is
no beer as strong as you think."</p>

<p>Stuart suddenly smiled. "You had me worried for a moment. No,
my friend, you have forgotten."</p>

<p>Clenchfield said: "Is there more than I can see? Damn you,
Logan, let an old man alone."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, do I hear swearing, or may I come in?"</p>

<p>Lucy Overmire came through the doorway, her gingham rustling
as she walked. She looked at Stuart's face. "The cuts were rather
deep. I'm afraid you'll have scars. Did I interfere in an
argument between you two?"</p>

<p>"No," said Stuart. "I simply reminded Clenchfield he had
forgotten something."</p>

<p>"I was never the one to be poking my finger through shadows,"
retorted Clenchfield. "It is more than I can say for you."</p>

<p>Clenchfield turned his glance to the girl. "He rides too much
and thinks too many things. Now he goes to San Francisco in the
morning."</p>

<p>"I had intended asking you for supper tomorrow night," said
Lucy. "It is your birthday."</p>

<p>"You have a long memory."</p>

<p>"My memory is full of pleasant things I could scarcely
forget&mdash;and unpleasant recollections I wish I could
forget."</p>

<p>"One balances another."</p>

<p>"One leads to another."</p>

<p>Clenchfield, resting his hands on the high desk, observed that
they had forgotten him. He noticed how quiet they were with each
other, how softly their words fell, how sober they had turned.
She was a handsome woman, an uncommonly striking woman.</p>

<p>"I am like you, Logan," she said. "I always want to see what
is over the next hill. Don't get in trouble with the vigilantes
down there."</p>

<p>"I'll bring you a pair of jade earrings for your wedding
gift."</p>

<p>At that point the talk ceased and Lucy, after a moment of
silence, turned from the store.</p>

<p>Stuart watched the doorway a short while and then walked into
the rear room. Clenchfield thought to himself: "That was a queer
thing," and he sat pondering it. There was a twinge in
him&mdash;a stray current of something out of the far past, a
half-warm regret and a pale sentimentality.</p>

<p>A small crowd turned out to bury McIver, and afterwards most
of that crowd moved toward the town's deadfalls. Four men
remained behind Johnny Steele, Joe Harms, Dick Horeen, and a man
called Lester. It was Johnny Steele who brought up the subject of
money.</p>

<p>"I heard Mack say he had three or four thousand in dust."</p>

<p>Horeen smilingly shook his head. "All miners are hell for
lying. But let's just go ask Camrose if Mack has got anything in
the safe."</p>

<p>"No," said Joe Harms. "Don't ask Camrose if Mack has anything
in the safe. Ask him how much Mack's got in the safe."</p>

<p>"What's the difference?" Horeen wanted to know. But Steele
stared at Joe Harms, recognizing what the little man suspected.
The four of them turned to the express office and filed in one at
a time.</p>

<p>Camrose stood at the far end of the room. The moment he saw
them, a change came upon his face&mdash;the beginning of a sharp
reaction which he at once checked. Harms and Steele, both with
suspicion making their eyes inquisitive, saw that instant of
shock.</p>

<p>"George," said Dick Horeen, "we got to talkin' about poor old
Mack. How much did he leave in your safe?"</p>

<p>Camrose's glance ran from man to man. He moved to the counter
and he drew in deeply on the cigar and expelled the smoke, thus
creating a haze around his face. He grew visibly cooler.</p>

<p>"He left nothing, boys."</p>

<p>Horeen turned to his friends. "There you are. Mack was just
makin' himself big."</p>

<p>But Lester said: "I was with him last night. He said he'd left
his poke here."</p>

<p>"So he had," agreed Camrose. "But he picked it up."</p>

<p>"When?" asked Harms.</p>

<p>Camrose took the cigar from his mouth and stared beyond the
group, evidently in careful thought. "It was ten o'clock last
night." Then, turning his attention to harms, he quickly
corrected himself. "No, I wasn't here at ten. Must have been
eleven."</p>

<p>Harms said: "How much did he have?"</p>

<p>"I'd guess about twenty-five ounces."</p>

<p>"Why, by god," said Horeen, "Mack wasn't lyin'."</p>

<p>For quite a while the group stood silent, each man taking the
story apart and putting it together again. Harms and Steele both
had quicker and better minds than either Horeen or Lester; but if
they reached their conclusions earlier than the other two, they
failed to indicate it. Horeen was first to speak. The information
had sobered him. "Well, Mack picks up his dust, walks to the
creek and falls down. When we find him there's no money on him at
all. That's a hell of a long jump from an accident, boys."</p>

<p>Harms held his magpie attention on Camrose. "George, why
didn't you say something about this, instead of lettin' the camp
think it was just a case of a drunken prospector, with nothing in
his pocket, fallin' in the creek?"</p>

<p>Camrose showed Harms a nettled expression. "I don't slide
around the shadows watching people. Therefore I don't know how he
died."</p>

<p>"You knew he had dust."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. He may have spent it, or given it to
somebody else."</p>

<p>"Odd you wouldn't have mentioned it anyhow," said Harms,
stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Odd to you perhaps," answered Camrose. "But I keep my nose
out of other people's business. What happened to McIver or his
dust was not my affair at all."</p>

<p>"Seems odd," repeated Harms, unable to leave it alone.</p>

<p>Camrose was now in bad temper. "I guess I'll have to make it
clearer, Joe. I am not your kind of man. I don't go sliding
around the dark, looking through windows at people. You're a
damned Peeping Tom."</p>

<p>Harms flushed but made no answer. Horeen said: "No use of
anybody being offended," and drew the party out of the
office.</p>

<p>Camrose moved to the rear of the room, watching through the
window as the four moved toward Stutchell's, stopped at the
deadfall's doorway and fell into sober conversation. Then Joe
Harms broke away and recrossed the street, vanishing from
Camrose's sight. He would be resuming his pulpit seat in front of
Howison's stable, Camrose thought. Presently Horeen and Lester
went into the deadfall while Johnny Steele turned back to join
Joe Harms.</p>

<p>Camrose dropped his half-finished cigar to the floor and
stepped on it; when he brought weight down on his leg he felt his
knee shaking. In his mind a phrase turned around and around,
endless and bitter: "If I could only go back to before this all
happened! If..."</p>

<p>Joe Harms tipped his bench back against the wall of Howison's
barn, his short legs not quite touching the ground, his pointed
and ungenerous face half concealed by the forward slope of his
hat. Johnny Steele crouched on the street and slowly winnowed the
dry dust between his fingers.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Not at eleven o'clock. There wasn't no light in his office
then. He came down the street around ten. I was sittin' here. He
went into his office. He was there fifteen minutes. There wasn't
anybody with him. He went out, going to Lestrade's as usual. He
came back and he went up the street. That was when McIver walked
out of Hobart's deadfall."</p>

<p>"Where was Camrose then?"</p>

<p>Joe Harms raised his head so that Johnny Steele clearly saw
the expression of chagrin on the man's features. "That's what I
could shoot myself for. I don't know. I lost track of him while I
was watchin' McIver. You got some kind of a suspicion against
him, Johnny?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Steele with reluctance. "I sort of thought it
queer when I went to get my dust from him. Something seemed a
little out of joint."</p>

<p>"There was," said Joe Harms.</p>

<p>Steele said: "What was?" and hung his arrested glance on
Harms's fox-sharp features. But he got no answer from the little
man, who was reluctant to admit that he spent his time crouched
against the office knothole.</p>

<p>Steel continued his pondering and his steady winnowing of
dust. He was a fair man, not given to quick conclusions; he was
also a man of firm mind and convictions. Therefore he went
through the thing from beginning to end, and arrived at something
new.</p>

<p>"When we looked through Mack's pockets," he said, "we figured
it just an accident. So we weren't looking very hard. We might
have missed something. I think we'd better look again."</p>

<p>He rose and stamped his legs. "Meet me tonight. I'll bring
along a couple shovels. Better be just the two of us. It is sort
of dirty business, and I'd not like to be tagged with it, if we
don't find anything."</p>

<p>"You know Camrose has been losin' a lot of money at
poker?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Steele, "I know all of that. But I'm not going to
start thinking what you think until I've got more to go on.
Tonight."</p>

<p>Steele walked away while Harms straightened the chair and
assumed his characteristic posture, arms across his lap, body
half bent over, one leg swinging in a steady motion across the
other. Thus cramped, the little man viewed the town from beneath
the brim of his hat, his eyes darting about, full of slyness,
full of skeptic wisdom, full of ferret-like curiosity. He saw
Overmire coming down the street and his ungenerous little mouth
changed shape. Overmire was an educated man and a lawyer of some
importance in the Territory and it flattered Harms's vanity that
he could do injury to such a man.</p>

<p>"Overmire," he murmured, "Lucy's engaged to Camrose, ain't
she?"</p>

<p>"That's right," said Overmire and waited for the little man to
come to the point. He knew Harms very well; for if it pleased
Harms to reduce Overmire's worth to the common denominator of
Jacksonville's least occupied citizen, it likewise pleased
Overmire to study the queer impulses and quirks which made Joe
Harms what he was.</p>

<p>"Well," said Harms, "he lost a couple or three thousand
dollars last night in a poker game. Thackeray's got his I.O.U.
for one thousand of it."</p>

<p>The little man, of course, wanted to shake him as well as warn
him; and this was a pleasure Overmire did not propose to give
him. "Joe," he said calmly, "it has often puzzled me to know how
one small man could absorb so much gossip. But, then, you do work
hard at the business. It is a triumph of perseverance."</p>

<p>He laughed at the warm resentment on Joe Harms's face, and
went away; but as soon as his back was turned, he ceased to
smile. Other stray bits of news and gossip had frequently come to
him concerning Camrose, making the picture of a man who had a
taste for the pleasant sins of life. So far there had been
nothing that Overmire, himself a man of the world, could honestly
carry to his daughter. But this information was serious, and
something to be weighed. Abreast Stuart's store, he wheeled in
and walked to the rear, finding Stuart there.</p>

<p>Overmire seated himself on the edge of Stuart's bunk and
observed this man he greatly admired. Himself a person of
considerable force and resolution, he recognized in Stuart the
same qualities. In silence to himself he had often debated his
daughter's choice and had often wondered at the closeness which
seemed to exist between Lucy and Logan. Yet that closeness never
appeared to pass a given point, a thing which puzzled him; for
after all his daughter was a desirable woman in any single man's
eyes and Logan Stuart, though not handsome, had action and
gallantry enough to excite the average woman. In such a
situation, certain attractions and compulsions should be at work,
and Overmire had watched for this to happen with the eye of a
realist and the sentiments of a father wishing his daughter a
good match. Why had it not happened?</p>

<p>"You ought to be a traveling man by trade," observed Overmire.
"Selling medicines from a wagon up and down the country. You have
too much energy to be still."</p>

<p>"I'm going to San Francisco to set up a line of credit."</p>

<p>"Sensible. The want of capital strangles development in this
country." He secured himself a cigar from a breast pocket,
trimmed it, lighted it and placed it between his broad lips. Then
he came nearer to what lay on his mind. "Do you think it a
particularly good thing to be playing cards at Lestrade's?"</p>

<p>"I do not play there any more. Neither does Howison or
Balance."</p>

<p>"I had not realized it was entirely that certain a thing."</p>

<p>"Lestrade is not the invalid he makes out." Then Stuart gave
Overmire a direct glance. "You're thinking of Camrose. I told him
to stay clear of the place."</p>

<p>"It occurs to me," said Overmire, "you are usually the first
one around here to smell changes in temperatures." Afterwards he
added a most casual phrase. "You're loyal to your friends, and I
suppose George Camrose is the closest friend you've got."</p>

<p>Stuart was careful with his words. "This is a dull camp for
George, and the dullness makes him restless. Whether he would be
happier somewhere else or not, I don't know. There are spots of
him I have not fathomed. My guess is he needs to be whipped to
get the best out of him. He's not the kind of man I am, Jonas.
Maybe that's why I'm fond of him. It is a fine thing to be able
to laugh, to see the foolish side of life."</p>

<p>Overmire rose. "Better advise him to quit poker."</p>

<p>"I have his promise on that."</p>

<p>"When did he give it to you?"</p>

<p>"Day before yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>Overmire had not intended to say more, but the information
upset him; suddenly it shed a different light upon George
Camrose. "That same night," he said slowly, "he lost two or three
thousand dollars."</p>

<p>He had thought, during this talk, that Stuart's private
knowledge of Camrose was greater than he was willing to disclose.
Now, in observing Stuart's change of expression, he felt certain
of it. The tall man before him showed anger rather than
astonishment.</p>

<p>"He signed an I.O.U. for a thousand," added Overmire.
"Therefore he lost a thousand or two in cash. Where did he get
the money?"</p>

<p>"It didn't come out of the company safe. It was his own."</p>

<p>Overmire had a dry answer. "I did not know he possessed that
much wealth. How can you know it?" Then he said very bluntly:
"Why do you protect him?"</p>

<p>"He's all right. He's got too much spirit for this camp."</p>

<p>"Well, by God," said Overmire, "if he's going to play poker
every time he gets bored during the next forty years he'll never
leave the table. Come to supper tonight."</p>

<p><br> <br> At six o'clock, Camrose locked the office door
behind him and stood still momentarily to view a street along
which he had traveled for a matter of two years; he saw the
miners drifting in toward the deadfalls, the chimney smoke
rising, the solitary riders coming down the short hill from the
Applegate trail, the same dogs sprawled in the dust, the same men
standing at the doorways of their shops. All this he had
witnessed so many times, yet tonight he was no longer sure of the
town or the people. Therefore he crossed the street, moved along
the wall of McKebbin's warehouse, and took a round-about path to
the Overmires'.</p>

<p>Dinner was on the table and Logan was here. Camrose paid his
usual respects to the family and he smiled his usual smile at
Logan. Then fear touched him when he thought he saw the shadow of
disapproval in Stuart's eyes. He said to himself: "It is in my
mind. The world is exactly the same, but I see it differently."
He sat up to the table with the rest of them, he bowed his head
to Overmire's brief grace, and he took his part in the idle talk
that went around. He forced himself to eat heartily and he made a
point of being somewhat gayer than usual. Now and then he
observed Lucy's eyes show a slight speculation; even behind her
smile there seemed a question. That also, he thought, was his
imagination. When did a man control these shadows, these fancies,
these apparitions which unaccountably flung themselves across his
brain? When did memory build a wall around the sound of McIver's
strangling breath in the water?</p>

<p>In the fall of twilight Overmire and Stuart walked from the
house to sit with their cigars. Camrose did not join them as
formerly. He looked at Lucy and he murmured, "Let's have a look
at the mountains." He took her arm, moving away along the
footpath toward the southern side of town. Overmire and Stuart
were talking in the yard. He listened to the tone of their voices
drop away, half expecting some quick whisper between them, Lucy
said: "Is something troubling you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "What would be?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, of course."</p>

<p>"Look at the shape of the mountains against the sky," he
said.</p>

<p>"George, couldn't you be happy here?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I couldn't. I want to marry you as soon as
you'll permit. Then I want us to leave here. How soon can we do
it?"</p>

<p>The wind rose small and cool and the stars were pale pinpoints
in the sky. Lucy pointed upward, her voice quite soft. "Did you
ever have your thoughts stretch out until it seemed you were
almost touching the top of the sky? You get up there and you
float against a kind of ceiling. It is soft and bumpy, like
velvet cloth not quite stretched tight."</p>

<p>He stopped and faced her. "I'll be damned if I beg. I'm sick
and I'm lonely. I've got to have you inside four walls with me,
knowing you're mine. I walk this town like a beggar, owning
nothing and owned by nothing. I can't bear to think you've lost
faith in me. I do not know what I should do. Do you imagine I've
got no feelings, no wants?" He seized her, finding no other words
which would express his sudden desperation. He brought her hard
against him with neither delicacy nor manners; he kissed her with
this fury upon him and he knew he hurt her and could not help it.
When he stepped back he was breathing quickly and the strength
had gone out of his knees.</p>

<p>"George&mdash;George," she murmured, "why haven't you done
this before? Why have you been so terribly afraid of expressing
yourself? This is better."</p>

<p>"When shall it be?" he said, impatient and urgent.</p>

<p>She took his arm, turning him back. She walked in step with
him, her hand warm on his arm; and again the silence lengthened.
"I did not realize," she said at last, "you had feelings that
deep. You've never shown them." She was again silent, walking
forward with her thoughts, and then at last he heard her voice as
from a far distance. "Whenever you want."</p>

<p>"Sunday would be a good day. This Sunday."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I shall have to make a dress."</p>

<p>"Is a dress a marriage?" he asked. Her hand lightened on his
arm and he had the impression he had hurt her. They went in
silence to the cabin and found Overmire smoking out his cigar.
Stuart stood in the kitchen drying dishes while Mrs. Overmire
washed them.</p>

<p>Lucy held her hand on George's arms and said: "We have news,
Father."</p>

<p>Mrs. Overmire, hearing it, came at once from the kitchen,
folding her wet hands on her apron. She said: "When is it to
be?"</p>

<p>"On a Sunday quite soon. Perhaps in two weeks&mdash;if I can
get a dress made by then."</p>

<p>"Lord love us," said Mrs. Overmire, "there's no material for a
dress in this camp, and nothing much in Portland."</p>

<p>Overmire sat with his hands over his stomach, soberly
considering his daughter's expression.</p>

<p>He found it unexcited and much too calm, too fixed. Meanwhile
he kept his own feelings entirely hidden and slowly rocked back
and forth. Presently it occurred to him Stuart had said nothing
and he glanced toward Stuart, who was in the kitchen doorway.
Overmire saw nothing there, either; then it occurred to him that
his daughter had not looked at Stuart, nor spoken to him.
Suddenly Overmire unlaced his hands and brought one palm
vigorously down on the table top. "A long time ago I said that
when my girl got married I would see it done right. It has got to
be the finest wedding in the Territory. I'll get the governor to
come down. We'll have a holiday in the camp."</p>

<p>"You'll have everybody in the camp drunk," said Lucy
humorously.</p>

<p>"You go to San Francisco with Logan," said Overmire. "Get the
best to be had. There's some good French dressmakers down there.
I shall give you a draft on a bank. When you return, I'll sent a
wagon to Scottsburg to pick up the plunder."</p>

<p>He knew this was strong lure, both to Lucy and to his wife;
they were surprised by the offer, but they were intrigued by it.
Mrs. Overmire said slowly, "Well, I don't know. It is a long way
to go for a dress, but it is dreadful to live in a land full of
men and dust and horses and saloons&mdash;and no nice places to
get things."</p>

<p>"Go along with her," said Overmire. "Make it a holiday."</p>

<p>"You remember what a terrible time I had on the clipper from
New York? I made a vow I'd never leave land again&mdash;and I
won't. But as for Lucy...Lucy, what do you think'?"</p>

<p>For the first time during this scene Lucy looked directly at
Stuart. "Would it trouble you too much to have me along?"</p>

<p>Both of them were sober and both on guard, Overmire noticed;
they were more like strangers than old friends. From the
beginning the relations of these two&mdash;by turns so close and
laughing, so frank, so angered at each other, and now so stiffly
cool had greatly puzzled him. All he could definitely say about
them was that they had seldom spared one another.</p>

<p>"Come along," said Stuart, considerably restrained. "We shall
be in San Francisco four days. Would that be time enough for
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, still watching him. "That would do."</p>

<p>George Camrose stood by and felt his isolation. He was a
spectator, his own advice unsolicited. A rush of temper urged him
to speak up, but he restrained the impulse for fear that he would
only betray himself further. A kind of fever burned in him and a
sense of catastrophe washed its steady wave of emotion all
through him. He was deeply afraid.</p>

<p>"It is an impulsive thing," said Lucy. "I ought to think
carefully of it."</p>

<p>Stuart walked to the door. "Come along, George. This is a
family matter." He touched Camrose's arm and the two left the
house.</p>

<p>"Now," said Lucy to her father, "is it the dress, or something
else?"</p>

<p>"A month away from him would do you no harm."</p>

<p>"Do you think I am at all uncertain about it?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't given it a thought. Certain or uncertain, you're
going to be married to this man a long time. Better make your
journey to Mecca while you've got the chance."</p>

<p>"You weren't really thinking of the dress," she murmured, and
studied him a longer moment, clearly showing that she wished she
knew what was in his mind. Then she turned and left the cabin.
Mrs. Overmire, going to the door, saw her daughter stroll on into
the darkness with her head dropped thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Overmire said: "You didn't want me to go with her, did
you, Jonas?"</p>

<p>"No. Do you think she'll make the trip?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Overmire, "she made up her mind the moment
you mentioned it."</p>

<p>"Then I don't think she is deeply bound to Camrose. Do
you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Overmire sighed. "I do not understand this new age. They
talk different and they act different. But she has seen Logan
every week for two years. This trip will not change anything.
What have you got against George all of a sudden?"</p>

<p>He avoided that subject. "Why wasn't it Logan? I don't
understand. At times I've seen them look at each other in a
damned intimate manner."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Mrs. Overmire most gently, "he never asked
her."</p>

<p>"Why not?" challenged Overmire. "She's woman enough for any
man."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was because she was already engaged."</p>

<p>"That means nothing to an aggressive man like Logan." Then he
paused and shook his head. "It's true," he admitted. "George
stands between them. Logan would always defend George&mdash;he
always has." He got to thinking of it and afterwards said: "But
if Lucy's fond of Stuart, why doesn't she break off with George
and make everything open again, so Stuart would have a clear
field?"</p>

<p>"It is too late now. Logan's going to marry Caroline
Dance."</p>

<p>He stared at his wife with disbelief. "Do you intend to tell
me Lucy would marry a man she didn't love just because she
couldn't get Logan? I don't believe it."</p>

<p>She said, "I don't know how she feels toward Logan. I do know
she was once in love with George. Whether she now is, or whether
she's not certain, or whether&mdash;" She shook her head and
added, "I don't know, Jonas."</p>

<p><br> <br> Camrose and Stuart went down the hill in entire
silence. At the store's doorway Stuart said, "Come in a moment,
George," and walked through to the rear room. Camrose followed,
waiting for Stuart to light the lamp, and suddenly fearful of
what Logan might know. The light bloomed yellowly upward in the
lamp chimney and Stuart swung about, showing to Camrose that
rocky, drawn expression which always came to him when he faced a
fight or a disagreeable thing.</p>

<p>"God damn you," he said, holding his voice down to a
conversational tone. "I ought to break you up and make you crawl
down the street on your hands. Maybe that would make a man of
you. I don't know. I don't care much."</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;here," said Camrose. The rough handling braced
him; it stirred his temper. "Keep your tongue off me, Logan. I
can't permit you to talk like that."</p>

<p>"You have been a sucker in this camp for any man with a deck
of cards. You're a tinhorn. Any cheap sport in town can trim you.
You've made a hell of a nice living for the boys, George.
Thackeray ought to give you a pension. You've set him up well
enough."</p>

<p>"Who keeps you informed&mdash;Joe Harms?" asked Camrose in a
jeering voice.</p>

<p>"You suppose any man can drop as much as you did without the
camp knowing it? You're a prime tenderfoot. How do you suppose
Thackeray makes his living? Did you think you could out-play him?
If God gave you any sense, you might know he could deal himself
pat with one hand tied behind him. Did you expect to win?"</p>

<p>"I can't take that talk," said Camrose in a dogged voice. "I
can't do it, Logan. I have got to warn you to quit."</p>

<p>"Explain to me, then, why you took the money I gave you, made
a promise to quit playing, and blew it over the poker table."</p>

<p>"You're very pious about it, are you not? Very smug. You want
the sinner to confess. Grovel and cry his weakness and his
sorrow. I shan't do it. If it were in my power to raise the money
and return it, I should do so. Then, clear of the obligation, I
should tell you to go to hell."</p>

<p>Stuart stood at the corner of the room, the weight of his
judgment pressing upon Camrose. The latter began to feel a change
in this man he so well knew&mdash;a closing out and a drawing
away&mdash;until at last the silence was worse than the unsparing
speech. "Logan," he said, "how can I explain it to you? You have
got your business. You are happy at it. Perhaps you will make a
fortune at it. You gamble each time you send out a train. Why do
you gamble? To make a million dollars. I haven't the chance of
gambling that way. So I do it the only way I can. Where is the
difference?"</p>

<p>"Damn-fool talk," said Stuart. "You know better."</p>

<p>"Well," said Camrose, "let it go. It happened because I'm the
kind of a man I am. I am sick of this damned dull place. I never
belonged here. There is your answer."</p>

<p>Stuart put a hand to the wall; he dropped it, and shoved both
hands into his pockets. He shrugged his shoulders. "Maybe it is a
good answer," he said. "I can't judge you. I'm sorry for
you."</p>

<p>"It will all wash out," said Camrose, greatly relieved at the
turn of affairs. "Let's have no more hard words. The place is
dreary enough without that."</p>

<p>"You've tried to make it easy before, and each time it comes
out worse. If you mean to make your life a thing of running and
hunting, you had better think of Lucy."</p>

<p>"We'll pull out of here and live somewhere decent," said
Camrose, full of assurance. "It will be better&mdash;it will be
fine."</p>

<p>"Always tomorrow&mdash;always the next thing. You never face
it. You'll marry her, you'll move on. You'll find nothing that
pleases you. You'll play for your million and you'll get into
another scrape. The hell with it, George. You stay right here and
work this piece of ground. I will not think of you carrying her
from pillar to post."</p>

<p>Camrose's temper swung up. "I'll decide that."</p>

<p>"Your decisions are bad. You'll play no fake games with
Lucy."</p>

<p>For the first time in his long association with Logan, Camrose
felt a suspicion. "Does she concern you that much?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Stuart, "she does."</p>

<p>"That's too damned much. What are you covering up on your own
account?"</p>

<p>The remark touched Stuart far deeper than Camrose imagined it
would. Stuart came quickly across from the corner of the room; he
flung out his arm, using the butt of his palm to jolt Camrose in
the chest; and then he raised his hand and slapped Camrose across
the face. Camrose recovered himself and lifted his arms, laughing
in a rash way. "Now we're going to have a fight, Logan."</p>

<p>"You talk too much," said Stuart and struck him on the chest
again. Suddenly he took two long steps backward, hearing Lucy's
voice call through the store.</p>

<p>She came into the room somewhat excited by the decision she
had made. Then she observed the bony expression on Stuart's face
and she cast a quick look toward Camrose, who stood with his
light hair fallen down on his forehead and his chest moved by
swift breathing. She saw all this and her rapid mind grasped some
of its meaning at once. But before she could comment on it,
Camrose recovered himself quickly and assumed a smile.</p>

<p>"What is it to be, Lucy?"</p>

<p>"I came to tell Logan I was going with him."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Camrose. "You will be in good company."</p>

<p>"Have you two been quarreling?"</p>

<p>"We often quarrel," said Camrose, recovering some of his easy
manner. "Then we forget it. You ought to know Stuart's positive
disposition."</p>

<p>Whether or not she believed the explanation, she made a show
of accepting it and turned to Stuart. "I shall be packed and
ready in the morning."</p>

<p>Stuart, less changeable, still held his rough expression. He
said, "All right, Lucy. We'll leave at seven."</p>

<p>He watched her leave, he listened to her steps go along the
store; then he stared at Camrose with his hard insistence.
Suddenly he turned to a corner shelf of the room and took down a
whisky bottle and two glasses. He set the glasses on the table
and half filled them with whisky. He sat down and he pointed to
the other chair, and he continued to watch Camrose as the latter
took place opposite him; he laid his heavy arms on the table and
hunched his shoulders, and he took up his glass and dipped it at
Camrose, and drank his whisky.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "you're still shy two thousand dollars out of
your safe."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Camrose, immensely relieved. "But that's all
right."</p>

<p>"Nothing's right," said Stuart. "I'll cover it when I get back
from San Francisco. As for Thackeray&mdash;don't pay that I.O.U.
It was a crooked game. As soon as I return I am going to wring
that man dry. I'll get it back from him, or I'll whip him out of
camp."</p>

<p>Camrose relaxed in the chair. Stuart was assuming the problem,
Stuart would find an answer&mdash;and this knowledge eased him
and he thought: "I am safe with him behind me."</p>

<p>"George," said Stuart, and leveled his finger on Camrose, "you
have got to stand fast. Don't shift around and don't duck. You
can't run away from anything."</p>

<p>"All right," said Camrose. "I'll do it. I'll do it,
Logan."</p>

<p>"We'll forget all this," said Stuart. "Drink 'er dry."</p>

<p>Camrose upended his glass and put it down. He rose with easy
humor restored. "I'm going to bed," he said and left the room
with a casual wave of his arm.</p>

<p>Stuart remained at the table. He put more weight on his elbows
and he dropped his shoulders nearer the table and used a
forefinger to push the two empty glasses around idly. This had
been bad, this night. Nothing would be the same between them
again, for some good thing had died the moment he struck Camrose;
and now he admitted a fact he had hitherto refused to face:
Camrose was a weak man who would never stand entirely
straight.</p>

<p>He wished he could tell Lucy that, but he realized he never
could. She had made her decision in favor of Camrose long ago,
and nothing would change her. There was nothing for him to do,
Stuart now understood, but to make Camrose stand straight.</p>

<p><br> <br> Leaving Stuart's Camrose discovered Lestrade at this
moment walking down the street. The two fell in step and Lestrade
presently said: "Little game tonight?"</p>

<p>"Not in the humor for it," said Camrose. "Tomorrow night,
then," said Lestrade. "I'll rustle up the boys, Stuart, too."</p>

<p>"He's leaving town in the morning for San Francisco."</p>

<p>"A long and dreary ride."</p>

<p>"Not that way. He's catching the boat at Scottsburg."</p>

<p>They reached the foot of the street, whereupon Camrose said,
"Good night," and turned to his office. Lestrade continued on to
his cabin, thinking to himself: "Stuart will probably take the
opportunity to carry dust. He usually does when he makes a trip.
This is what Bragg wants to know." Deciding that, he saddled and
rode at once to Bragg's cabin, calling the man to the door,
delivered his message and immediately returned to his own
place.</p>

<p>It was a quick and quiet trip, yet two men had witnessed his
going and his returning, Howison, who had been watching Lestrade
ever since the last holdup of his gold messenger, had noticed him
walk down the street with Camrose&mdash;and had followed him to
Bragg's. Pulled off in the timber as Lestrade cut back for town,
Howison thought to himself: "I have got as much evidence as I
could possibly want."</p>

<p>Johnny Steele, walking the night with his vivid recollections
of Mrs. Lestrade, had been near the creek when Lestrade passed
over it, outbound. Afterwards, Johnny strolled on until he was
near the Lestrade cabin and he stood with his shoulder tipped
against a tree and watched the cabin's light with his thoughts
taking him into strange places. She was a beautiful woman tied to
a crook, and she knew it and had her private tragedy. The memory
of holding her in his arms never ceased to affect Johnny Steele;
it had materially changed his life, taking some of the
carelessness out of him. He had reviewed himself critically, his
faults and his possibilities, and the recollection of his
thousand-dollar drunk greatly humiliated him. He had not stepped
into a deadfall since that memorable night at the creek; and
since that night, too, he had nourished wishes concerning Mrs.
Lestrade which he realized were impossible. Still he could not
stop those wishes. Standing there, he observed Lestrade's return
and he had a pretty good guess as to where the man had been.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER 10. &mdash; BLACK
NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">TRAVELING at no great speed, Stuart and Lucy
reached Dance's near suppertime the first day out of
Jacksonville. The hospitable Ben Dance made a considerable
ceremony over Lucy, and Mrs. Dance was reservedly cordial.
Caroline showed a mild surprise until the reason for the visit
was explained. It was Lucy who took pains to explain it in
considerable detail to Caroline, who said, "Why that's nice," and
went about her work with no additional show of interest.</p>

<p>After supper the three Dance boys rose and ranged into the
night while the others sat comfortably in the little room. Lucy
offered to help with the dishes and was politely refused. Dance
had a story to tell about a cougar&mdash;and at the end of the
story he added: "That was two days ago. I found Injun tracks at
the head of Goose Canyon, Stuart. You take care goin' through the
mountains tomorrow."</p>

<p>Then, and how or why it was Stuart could not understand, the
ease went away from this group. Dance felt it and his glance went
shrewdly around the woman and came over to Stuart with a flicker
of comprehending humor. Mrs. Dance spoke briskly of the latest
news, and inquired of people in Jacksonville. Caroline worked at
her darning, saying nothing; now and then she lifted her head,
when Lucy spoke, and watched the girl with a narrow attention. It
was the same expression, Stuart remembered, that had been on her
face when Lucy had wished her well at the raising of Bartlett's
cabin somehow stiff and resisting.</p>

<p>He rose and stepped into the night, and stood with his pipe to
watch the stars and the great black bulk of the mountains. Dance
presently came out, his humor working to the surface. He
murmured: "Air's sort of close in there."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Stuart.</p>

<p>"You can't mix women, Logan. I remember a long time
ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>Caroline stepped from the cabin and looked with suspicion at
her father. "What makes you laugh?" she asked and then, not
waiting for an answer, put her hand on Logan's arm and drew him
down the road.</p>

<p>She walked fast, with her face firm and her glance pointed
ahead. She was angry, and the anger came out of her like heat.
Stuart kept pace with her, waiting for the tempest to break upon
him; he braced himself for it and wondered how he was to meet it,
and how he was to smooth it away. But it never came. Her steps
began to slow down and her temper seemed to leave so that she at
last stopped and looked at him through the darkness, and reached
up to pull his head down. She kissed him, speaking softly. "I
should not be jealous, should I? There is nothing to be jealous
about is there?"</p>

<p>"No, Caroline."</p>

<p>She listened to his words and debated them in her mind. Her
face was softer than it had been, but it was also touched by a
reserved wonder. He could not be sure of her thoughts, he could
not follow them as she stood still and went far off from him.
Perhaps, he told himself, she knew more about him than he
realized. Perhaps everything in him was glass-clear to her, so
that she knew precisely what he offered her and what he could not
offer. He was wholly uncertain about it, and once more he asked
himself if he was just to her, but came no nearer the answer than
he had before.</p>

<p>"When will you be back, Logan?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks."</p>

<p>"I'll think of you," she said and returned to the cabin with
him. She stepped inside and presently reappeared with a pair of
quilts. Now she was cool and self-contained and her "Good night,"
as she turned away, was almost impersonal.</p>

<p>Stuart and Lucy were on the road at sunrise, soon passing into
the heavy hills. It occurred to him as they traveled along they
were no longer the free-and-easy people they had been on the last
trip together through this mountainous way. The fun and freedom
between them was gone. Somewhere during the morning Lucy
mentioned Caroline. "I should not have gone on this trip.
Caroline is not pleased. I do not blame her so much."</p>

<p>"It will pass," he said.</p>

<p>"Not too easily. Logan&mdash;would you care to tell me why you
and George quarreled?"</p>

<p>"I gave him some advice which he took poorly. But it will blow
over."</p>

<p>"I didn't expect you'd tell me," she said.</p>

<p>"We've quarreled before and will again. The thing to remember
is that I'll always do whatever I can for him, and for you."</p>

<p>"There'll be little chance of that. We're moving away."</p>

<p>"That's what the quarrel was about," he said.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon they put up at Anslem's and on the
following day passed the Umpqua at Rose's Ferry and continued to
a house some fifteen miles north. The next morning, Stuart left
the main trail and took a shortcut through a land of broken hills
and short valleys. It made a long ride but it saved half a day.
Beyond noon they camped while Stuart cooked up a meal; afterwards
they rested back in the warm sunshine.</p>

<p>"Logan, why doesn't he like this country?"</p>

<p>"He's got different tastes than the rest of us. I can
understand why he might get lonesome for other things. I imagine
you'll like the East."</p>

<p>"Is he going there?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you talked it over with him?"</p>

<p>"Not much."</p>

<p>"Odd," he said. He rose and helped her to her saddle, her
nearness troubling him, her eventual departure from the country
leaving a huge gap in him. A narrow canyon brought them before
the Umpqua again at a point where Stuart had remembered a
suitable ford; but though the river had receded from its solid-
rock bottom, the main channel still ran quick and deep and too
wide for Lucy's risking. He said "Bad guess. We'll have to follow
this around to Elkton. It will be a long ride and a late
one."</p>

<p>"We've ridden late and long before."</p>

<p>He observed the moment's smile, the moment's break of her
reserve; it took him back, it brought up all that he felt about
her and made every memory uncomfortable. "I've put you through
some rough times."</p>

<p>"You're usually rough." She was lightened by her thoughts and
once more made gay. "I recall when George introduced you to me.
He said, 'This is Logan Stuart, a particular friend. He has just
been in a fight&mdash;look at his knuckles.' I wondered at the
time what George saw in you. It took me several months to find
out." She grew curious and said suddenly: "What did you think of
me, that first meeting?"</p>

<p>"I said to myself, 'Damn George Camrose.'"</p>

<p>Warmth came over her face. "You have a rare moment now and
then," she murmured, and looked away from him. He straightened in
the saddle, with the goodness of the moment gone.</p>

<p>The detour took them off the trail and it became a matter of
finding a passable route between river's edge and timber's edge
as the afternoon wore on. They crossed several small creeks, and
occasionally found clear going on a natural meadow whose wild hay
stood amber and tousled. The river made great roundabout loops on
its way to the sea, and occasionally the face of a cliff came
down to block them, whereupon they took to the hills and slowly
crossed over. At sunset Stuart halted, started a fire and cooked
up bacon and coffee.</p>

<p>A long ride called for a long rest, and he had seen some
weariness on Lucy's face. Therefore he lighted his pipe and kept
the fire going while dusk came on. "I should imagine we've got
ten miles ahead of us," he said. "Lucy, why did you tell me not
to marry a calm woman?"</p>

<p>The question caught her off guard. She gave him a quick glance
and shook her head. "It was just something I said. It didn't mean
anything. I guess you've made a squaw out of me. I like
this."</p>

<p>"So will you like Fifth Avenue, George in a red plush
waistcoat and you in a most elegant red dress."</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said soberly. "I don't really know." A
fish broke the river's surface, that sound carrying through the
still air in a widening ripple, and somewhere a deer made a
racket in the brush on its way to water, and the crickets all
were singing. "I wouldn't say I'm a linsey-woolsey frontier
woman, but I couldn't say I am a woman meant for elegant drawing
rooms, either. I shall go where George goes and I shall no doubt
be happy wherever that is. But I am quite happy here, at this
moment. I am..."</p>

<p>Dusk drifted in, thinly shadowing the world; the small fire
brightened against this darkness, and the light of the fire
danced in her eyes as she watched him. She had spoken in a
detached and unstirred voice. Yet she was not as cool as that,
for somewhere within her an emotion strongly worked and left its
fugitive impression upon her face. He saw it on her lips most
clearly; it was her lips which always first betrayed the changes
within her. He thought: "I do not know anybody as well as I know
her. Nobody knows me as well as she does. A damned strange
thing."</p>

<p>"I guess," she added in a flatter voice, "I am simply an easy
woman to please."</p>

<p>The deer still stirred the brush, now closer. He listened to
it a moment, his mind only half on it. "That's wrong," he said.
"You're slow to change, slow to forget, and you don't give up
what you've got or what you believe."</p>

<p>She said quietly: "You should know."</p>

<p>Then he heard the rustling progress of the deer in the brush
once more, and the disinterested part of his mind began to pay
attention. The sound stopped, the sound began; and it grew nearer
each time he heard it. He was resting full-length, propped up on
an arm, with his head turned to the flames. He moved around
slightly to watch the black edge of the brush and timber fifty
feet beyond him. He thought: "Not quite right for a deer." The
fire was a small one, burning on its last few branches. He
thought, "Time to go," and sat up; then he was flooded with
warning as his mind fully woke and he swept his hand across the
fire's ashes and flung wood and sparks in a scattered shower
through the shadows, and he rolled against Lucy, knocking her
back to the earth.</p>

<p>The shot came immediately after, striking close by and
throwing a clot of dirt against him. He saw the flash of the gun
in the thicket and he rolled again as he drew his revolver from
his trouser band. He had lost his bearing on the thicket but he
still heard a body moving through it, faster and more carelessly.
The shadows were deepening along the meadow and the mule and two
horses, all on picket, uneasily walked around.</p>

<p>The hidden marksman, maneuvering beyond the screen of brush
and shadows, now ceased to move; and by that sign Stuart knew the
second shot was due. The sound of the shot, when it broke, seemed
huger than the first, but the aim was poorer. Stuart thought he
heard the scuff of the bullet a good distance back of him, though
he was not listening for it; he had seen the man's gun flash and
he steadied his gun on that spot and tried a shot of his own.</p>

<p>The answer was unexpected. The marksman broke into a run,
through the brush, keeping close to its edge; and thereafter he
made an abrupt halt and fired three times, with a considerable
delay between shots. The first shot struck one of the horses and
dropped it. Stuart had risen and was rushing at the nearest brush
when the second bullet broke. He skirted the edge of the brush
and saw the third flash of the gun scarcely more than twenty feet
from him. He fired on the flash and drew a swift answer. He
thought: "That ends the loads," and rushed straight into the
thicket.</p>

<p>The man was in full retreat before him, grunting and
hardbreathing as he smashed through the brush and into the
blackness of the timber; and suddenly Stuart understood the
uselessness of his chase and turned about. When he got to the
meadow he still heard the man somewhere in motion, apparently
circling away. He passed the animals and noticed all three on the
ground; he went forward to the scattered ruby glitter of the
fire. "Lucy," he said.</p>

<p>She had drawn back toward the river. Her voice drew him
forward until he found her crouched on the gravel. She said,
"Here," and caught his arm and pulled him down. "Don't go back
there," she said. "It was Bragg. I know. It couldn't be anybody
else." She was shaking. She put her other hand on him, thus
holding him with both. He saw the pale outline of her face in the
night. "It was Bragg, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>He got up. "It was Bragg. I'm going to the horses."</p>

<p>"They're dead."</p>

<p>"I know," he said, and moved over the meadow again. He came to
the animals and crouched down. He uncinched each horse and pulled
out the blankets from beneath each saddle and he got his small
valise with its load of gold dust. He sat still, hearing another
sound, a good deal south&mdash;the brisk and padded echo of a
horse in motion. He listened to it until he could hear nothing.
"It was Bragg," he said, and was certain of it. The man had
missed with his first charge and then he had turned sly and had
retreated. But he had been obliged to kill something, and
therefore had shot the animals. That was Bragg...</p>

<p>He walked back to Lucy. He pulled her up. "We'll walk away
from this," he said. "I don't expect him back. He missed his try
and he'll go back and wait another time. That's Bragg's habit.
But if he changes his habit and waits around for daylight, we
don't want to be here."</p>

<p>He put a hand to her and followed the river's edge, with the
north star to his left. It seemed wrongly placed to him until he
remembered the river was in one of its sweeping bends at this
point. The gravel gave way to solid rock pitted with holes worn
by eddies of the river's high water; and the rock gave way to a
brushy bank forcing them inland. A mile of this put them back to
the river again; another mile brought them before the silhouette
of a considerable canyon, through which the river ran a great
arc. Timber came close down to the water's edge and the way
forward was no longer to be seen.</p>

<p>"Here's where we stay," he said and dropped the blankets to
the ground. "Cold camp."</p>

<p>She knelt down, searching the ground with her hands. She
lifted the blankets and moved forward with them until he lost her
shadow against the timber. He heard her quietly speak and he went
on until he stumbled against her. "This is a better place, Logan.
A blanket underneath and a blanket on top. Come down."</p>

<p>He stretched beside her, beneath the top blanket; he rolled
the blanket's edge beneath him. "Another rough time to
remember."</p>

<p>"It isn't the end," she said. "I never see any end of violence
for you."</p>

<p>He said, "I'm going back to Jacksonville. But I shall take you
on to Scottsburg first and see you aboard the ship. We'll walk
into Elkton before noon and I can borrow a pair of horses from
Lew Waite."</p>

<p>"My father would disapprove of my going on alone. I'm
committed to your hands, so I shall return with you. It's Bragg,
I suppose. Why should he hate you so much?"</p>

<p>"You remember the two California miners killed near Evans's
Ferry a year ago?"</p>

<p>"The ones the Indians murdered?"</p>

<p>"I was on the road that morning. Bragg passed me, coming out
of the willows, running his horse. Ten minutes later I found the
two miners. I was the only witness&mdash;and a court would have
hung him on what I said. I knew it, but I didn't want to hang a
man on something I didn't see entirely. The ten minutes made the
difference. I kept still, which was a mistake."</p>

<p>She was against him, turned from him. He pulled the blanket
over her, feeling the damply exhaled fog of the river move over
and around them.</p>

<p>"Logan," she murmured, "you have kept still on many
things."</p>

<p>She lay soft in his arms, her warmth a part of him and her
nearness bringing up his constant, never-lessening want. From the
beginning her smile had come upon him with its personal interest,
her eyes and her lips had lightened at sight of him, her anger
had at times shaken him. They knew each other too well; their
closeness was too much for what they had of each other, yet too
little for what he wished. She was full and warm and deep. He
knew this about her more than others knew it, for with him she
was a different woman, not particularly caring if she hurt him or
shocked him. Since he was not her man, she could be herself
before him.</p>

<p>"You didn't answer me, Logan."</p>

<p>He thought to himself, "God damn George Camrose," and
struggled with his intemperate wishes.</p>

<p>She turned in his arms and her face came close to him so that
he felt the touch of her breath and had the luminous blur of her
face before him. "If it gets colder than you can stand," he said,
"I'll risk a fire." His urges made a turbulent eddy around them
both. There was nothing he could hide from her, so that he knew
she felt what was in him; her lips so near him, showed that
knowledge. He felt the sudden quickening of her heart and then,
rising on an elbow, he moved slightly forward and put his arm
beneath her and dropped his mouth upon her lips.</p>

<p>The pressure of his extreme wants held him there. She was a
bottomless softness, she was an acid-sweetness, she was a fire
burning against him and a wind rushing through him. He was heavy
on her and his arm slowly pulled her body around to him, and a
kind of greed made him forget everything else. She had not
resisted; her hand rested on the back of his neck and she seemed
willing to give him all he could hold of her. But suddenly her
lips slid aside, breaking the tension, and then he lay back
bitterly angered at himself. He took his arm from her, and she
rose on an elbow and brought her face quite near him. He heard
her rapid, uneven murmur: "That's what you wished, wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then don't hate me for giving it to you."</p>

<p>"It's no good."</p>

<p>"You're lying," she said. "You'll never have another woman
kiss you like that."</p>

<p>"It's no good. It will stick too long."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "that's different," and continued to watch
him. He could not see her face clearly, but he knew she was
trying to read him with that strong personal interest she always
used on him. This was a moment&mdash;like other moments he
remembered&mdash;when the door opened and they stood on the edge
of something neither of them understood. It never remained open
very long. He again asked himself the same old question: Why was
it George? That closed the door.</p>

<p>She turned away from him and he put his arm around her and
drew her close for warmth. She lay long awake, her mind
apparently very active; it was an hour or better before he felt
the loosening of her body and the change of her breathing. He
said once more to himself: "We're too close for what we've got,"
and drifted off to sleep.</p>

<p>The sodden cold of the river woke them before daylight and put
them on the road. At ten o'clock they reached the scattered
cabins of Elkton Settlement and found Lew Waite, who made
breakfast for them and loaned Stuart a pair of horses. "Howison's
pack outfit passed by here, Jacksonville bound, about an hour
ago."</p>

<p>"We'll catch up," said Stuart. "Do me a favor. Ride down to
where I was camped and strip the dead animals for me." He helped
Lucy to her saddle and set out along the wiggling course of Elk
Creek; in the middle of the afternoon they overtook Howison's
train and joined it for that day's march and that night's camp at
Applegate's. But the pack train's progress was too slow and the
following morning Stuart and Lucy moved ahead, reaching
Jacksonville late in the third afternoon from Apple-gate's. As
Stuart helped her down, he said: "I'm sorry about the wedding
dress."</p>

<p>"Any dress will do," she answered.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER 11. &mdash; APPROACH OF
JUDGMENT</h2>

<p class="first">STUART dropped on his bunk for a short sleep as
soon as he reached camp; and woke to a heavy and angered
conversation outside the back room's door&mdash;Henry violently
in argument with George Camrose. He heard Camrose say: "By God,
Henry, you can quit playing the part of a watch dog. I'm going in
there."</p>

<p>Henry's voice was starched with stubbornness. "And by God back
to you, sir, and you're not."</p>

<p>There was a scuffle, and the door came open. Rising from the
bed, Stuart saw Camrose thrust Clenchfield away with a stiff
swing of his forearm and stride through. Temper flushed his face
and made an electric dance in his eyes. He pointed a long finger
at Clenchfield, who now stood silently bitter in the doorway. "If
you were a younger man, Henry, I'd knock you down. Don't ever lay
your hands on me again."</p>

<p>Clenchfield stared at Stuart. "This man," he said with cold
distaste, "is suppose to be your friend. But not enough of one to
let you sleep."</p>

<p>"Damn you, Henry," said Camrose, "a man's not supposed to
sleep in the daytime."</p>

<p>Stuart rose and walked over the floor and got a drink of
water. He ran a hand along his jaw, feeling the length of his
whiskers; he stripped off his shirt and he got out his shaving
mug and razor. The sun had gone down, with twilight beginning its
soft inflow from the hills. He lighted the room's lamp and set it
on the table; he fixed his mirror near at hand and lathered his
face. Clenchfield had gone back into the store. Camrose stood by,
but Stuart was not particularly thinking of him; he was thinking
back to the scenes on the trail, all of them sharp and real.</p>

<p>"I hear," said Camrose, "you had trouble."</p>

<p>"A little trouble," agreed Stuart.</p>

<p>"That's characteristic," said Camrose.</p>

<p>The shortness of his tone brought Stuart back from his other
thinking. Now he paused in the lathering of his face and gave
Camrose a full-on appraisal. Camrose had subdued his anger, which
seemed to have been caused by Clenchfield, but he still showed
his flush and his ruffled spirits. In any other condition, Stuart
would have smiled the whole thing away; but awakened from
insufficient sleep and empty of stomach, he was not in the best
of spirits. Under such conditions he was not disposed to make too
many allowances for the unpredictable ways of his friend. "What's
characteristic?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Saying much in little," said Camrose.</p>

<p>"What the hell of it?"</p>

<p>Camrose widened his eyes at the reaction. "It was just a
comment, Logan."</p>

<p>Stuart returned to his shaving. The razor made poor going on
his beard, and the sound of it was gritty in the room's silence.
Stuart set up his strop, shaved a few strokes, and stropped
again. His eyes watered from the casual torture, causing him to
swear.</p>

<p>"Wherever she goes with you," said Cam-rose, "she gets in
trouble."</p>

<p>"It came out all right."</p>

<p>"Lucy stood it well," said Camrose. "I presume it was cold.
Manage to have a fire?"</p>

<p>"No," said Stuart, "I didn't want to make a target." He
finished one jaw and began on the other, waiting for Camrose to
creep nearer the thing which was behind this questioning.</p>

<p>"Otherwise," said Camrose, in the lightest voice he could
contrive, "you slept cold."</p>

<p>"Damned cold," agreed Stuart.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you give her any shelter at all?" asked Camrose.</p>

<p>"Some," said Stuart. He felt the hardening of the silence. He
carried the razor down his other jaw and along his chin. Camrose
walked a circle around the room and came to a stand before Logan.
He pushed the subject out of his head with great effort, and
turned to another.</p>

<p>"Are you going south again?"</p>

<p>"Not right off."</p>

<p>"I'm due to have a company agent through here one of these
days to check the accounts. A damned embarrassing turn of
things."</p>

<p>"Always embarrassing," said Stuart, "to lose somebody else's
money."</p>

<p>Camrose flushed. "I said I was a fool. Do I have to admit it
every time I see you? All I want is to get out of this hole. It
will be the last." Then he turned somewhat bitter. "It won't be
difficult to be honest the rest of my days. Life takes the heart
out of a man and leaves him a damned dry pulp. So, I can sit
around this town until I die, a little fellow with no courage and
no hope. I had hope once&mdash;and maybe I had courage. But it
didn't work."</p>

<p>"Not the way you tried to work it."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me other men haven't done it," said Camrose
sharply. "How do you suppose the millionaires of our land got
rich? On borrowed money. But they were smarter than I am. They
had their lawyers make everything legal. If they lost, they
weren't responsible for it. If they won, they were great
men."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Stuart. "But they stayed away from
poker."</p>

<p>"What's the difference between poker and manipulating railroad
stocks?"</p>

<p>"Your rich men played with their own cards. They had 'em all
marked and they couldn't lose. You played with another man's
cards, and you couldn't win."</p>

<p>Camrose was surprised. "I have never before heard you speak
cynically."</p>

<p>"I am only telling you where you made your mistake."</p>

<p>"It is going to be touch and go with me. I had counted on your
help."</p>

<p>"You'll get it. I'm going to talk to Thackeray."</p>

<p>"You'll not get it all back. There were others in that game.
Even so, it's not enough. It will take another two thousand,
above what I lost to Thackeray."</p>

<p>"When your company man comes, tell him you have got your
shortage&mdash;whatever amount it may be&mdash;out as a loan to
me. Enter it on your books now as a loan. We can straighten it
after he goes."</p>

<p>Relief brought a strong reaction to Camrose's face. He even
managed a smile&mdash;a semblance of the old smile. It would
never be the same smile as it once had been, Stuart thought, for
there would never be the same faith between them. He felt the
loss of it as he watched Camrose; he felt the emptiness of a
place that had been filled by their friendship.</p>

<p>"You're a white man," said Camrose. "That takes care of it.
Now I can sleep."</p>

<p>"And dream of making a fortune some other quick way," said
Stuart. "You're getting out of this easy. You always get out
easy."</p>

<p>"You disapprove," said Camrose. "Then why do you bother?"</p>

<p>Stuart lighted a cigar and took his time to answer. There had
been a good deal between them, and Camrose had meant much to him;
no man could cross out the fine things of his life without making
a last gesture, and maybe this was his last gesture toward the
good and careless days he had shared with George.</p>

<p>"If I thought you were a crook, I'd see you in hell. But
you're not a crook. You're a man with so many things in your head
that you've never been able to sort out which ones were right and
which were no good. This kind of a life isn't yours. You made a
mistake, but it was a mistake committed out of foolishness, not
done in cold blood."</p>

<p>George was smiling again with amusement, with a tolerant
indulgence of advice which bored him. Even now, Stuart thought,
George Cam-rose was unrepentant. Perhaps he had learned a bitter
lesson, but it was a lesson which galled him and made him feel
self-pity.</p>

<p>"Old boy," said Camrose, "I never thought you a complicated
man, yet there are times when I can't follow you. Shall I see you
up at Lucy's?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Camrose watched Stuart for a moment, the smile fading; and
then he turned from the room. By the time he reached the street
his face was again tight. He said to himself, "He's making these
concessions for her, not for me. I've got to find out about that
trip." In this mood of jealous doubt he walked up the hill to
Over-mire's.</p>

<p>Stuart moved into the lamp-stained shadows of the storeroom
and was comforted by its aromatic smells. They were familiar
smells with flavor to them; they reminded him of a hundred things
in swiftest succession, of wet trails through the hills, and the
slant of sunlight through the arched timber, of the campfire's
flickering and the sound of mystery aboard in night's pit, and of
warm cabins where men drowsed and drawled, and the edged air of
morning before the sun came up. He stood a moment watching
Clenchfield, whose dignity still was ruffled. "Never mind it,
Henry."</p>

<p>"You had better let your friend Camrose take care of his own
troubles. He's deep enough and it will do you no good to be
involved."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"I will let the town tell you," said Clench-field.</p>

<p>Stuart traveled on to Mrs. Johnson's house for his supper and
afterward went into Corson's deadfall. A crowd got around him to
hear about his trip and he stood awhile with his cigar and idly
took care of the questions. Thackeray came in and joined the
crowd. In a little while Stuart broke away, giving Thackeray a
signal.</p>

<p>The two of them left Corson's, nothing being said until they
were well down the street. Then Stuart went straight at the
subject.</p>

<p>"How much did you take off Camrose the other night?"</p>

<p>"About fifteen hundred gold. Another thousand on a note. Fitz
got a couple hundred and Gil Perrin took in a little, but later
lost to me."</p>

<p>"He's damned foolish with his money," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"His or somebody's," said Thackeray.</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"I guess you can figure it out as well as I can. The
suspicion's pretty general. He's come to you with his troubles,
ain't he? He always does. Better quit holding him up. He'll learn
to hold himself up, or he'll sink. My guess is he'd sink."</p>

<p>"You should have let him alone. He's got no business with
cards."</p>

<p>"If I don't trim him somebody else will. Never pity a
fool."</p>

<p>"You don't know him."</p>

<p>Thackeray shrugged his shoulders. "My business is cards. In
that business you study people pretty sharp. I know Camrose. You
do not. You're his friend. You don't see his rotten spots. You'll
defend him since you're a pretty stubborn fellow and you wouldn't
throw a man down. But for me, he's strictly a tinhorn. When I
play him I always watch him. I never know what a tinhorn will do.
He'd take me if he could and he would have no regrets. But when I
take him he cries to you."</p>

<p>"No," said Stuart, patiently trying to explain it, "he's not
what you think."</p>

<p>"Well," said Thackeray, "he ain't worth our arguin'
about."</p>

<p>"I want the money back," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"That's what I expected you wanted," said Thackeray and
stopped. He turned to Stuart, his face becoming smooth. "You got
a streak in you about that man. I don't understand it, and
neither does the camp. It is no use, Logan. I will not do
it."</p>

<p>"I'll expect it back inside of an hour," said Stuart.</p>

<p>A flurry of concern came across Thackeray's face. His
business, always a dangerous one, had taught him the ways of
survival and he had used these ways during his career. But he
shook his head and expressed a great deal of regret with his
voice. "I cannot be bluffed."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see me run a bluff? I mean what I say."</p>

<p>"Why, God damn you!" exclaimed Thackeray. "You couldn't find
two men in all this camp who'd agree I ought to return the money.
You know it, too. You're standing there and telling me you'll
make it a fight?"</p>

<p>Stuart nodded. He held Thackeray's astonished and resentful
glance; he was hard and he was patient and, since Thackeray
always carried a gun, he was watchful. He had no grudge against
Thackeray and in fact had always been on excellent terms with
him, but that point had passed by. He had made up his mind and he
would not recall the decision.</p>

<p>"Logan," said Thackeray in an almost pleading voice, "you're
wrong as hell."</p>

<p>"It was in the books you'd clean him when he sat down. He had
no chance against you."</p>

<p>"That," said Thackeray, "was his lookout, not mine and not
yours."</p>

<p>"I want it back within the hour."</p>

<p>"You won't get it."</p>

<p>"All right," said Stuart, "I'll have to come after you when
the hours up."</p>

<p>This night was cool with the quickening breeze of a fall
night. Yet Thackeray lifted a hand and ran the tips of his
fingers across his forehead and brought them away wet. He
realized he was suddenly sweating, and the fact annoyed him. His
eyes, usually half shut, were now fully open. "You'd better stay
out of Camrose's affairs, Logan, before he pulls you down with
him." But he realized he could not change Stuart's mind and so
said wearily, "I guess it will have to be a fight," and turned
away.</p>

<p>Stuart let the man get ten feet distant. Then he added his
last remark, shrewdly withheld until now. "Maybe I better tell
you one more thing. The money he lost was not his. It was mine.
He had borrowed it from me for another purpose."</p>

<p>Thackeray came sharply about, walking back at a faster gait.
He stopped before Stuart and he said in lively anger: "Why didn't
you tell me? Why point a gun at a man's head and try to break him
down? I'd like to swing a chair over your thick head! Since it's
your money, of course I'll give it back."</p>

<p>Stuart put a heavy hand on Thackeray's shoulder and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Let's have a drink on it."</p>

<p>"A good idea."</p>

<p>During this time men had gone by them, down the street and up
the street, singly or in pairs; now as they turned together in
the direction of Corson's deadfall, Stuart heard a man running
from the lower part of town. He looked behind him and observed
this man stop and touch a second man. Someone else drew in, and
presently there was a group closely drawn into a circle, softly
speaking.</p>

<p>He paid little attention to that group, for his glance had
passed on to a scene which interested him far more. Mrs. Lestrade
had come from Howison's store, turning off toward her cabin, and
at the same time Johnny Steele walked from the shadows and lifted
his hat to her. She stopped, facing Johnny Steele, and something
was said between them, after which he went on with her as far as
the last shed on the street. Here she stopped once more and
looked up to him; a moment later, she continued on alone, with
Steele standing on the walk to watch her. His first thought was:
"A good man and a fine woman. But a bad thing to do. This town
will see it and comment on it."</p>

<p><br> <br> Camrose, walking up the hill with a mind made
fertile by jealousy, remembered how violent some of the quarrels
between Stuart and Lucy had been, and he had a shrewd thought
about that: "Unless they were fond of each other, why should they
have quarreled?" Then he remembered how they had closed up the
quarrels and had turned again to laughter, and this brought him
another sharp observation: "They were too close to remain apart.
I have been very stupid." As he reached the yard of the Overmire
house he recalled how he had taunted Stuart into kissing Lucy. It
had amused him then, but it did not now. She had been in Stuart's
arms and she had felt Stuart's wants. What went on between them
then?</p>

<p>The thought of it quickened his jealous suspicion, but even
then there was a deeper fear in him which turned him sly and
cautious. He was alone in this town and men were watching him
closely; he had sensed their talk about him as he passed by. He
could not break with Stuart, for Stuart was his only support. And
Stuart would remain his friend as long as Lucy was in the scene.
He had an accurate picture of Logan Stuart's position in all
this; it was a love of Lucy which caused Stuart to remain
fast.</p>

<p>The three Overmires were in the cabin's main room and they had
been talking, but now stopped. He managed his smile and he made
his bow and saw Lucy's smile come lightly back to him. "I have
been anxious about you," he said.</p>

<p>"Look at her," said Overmire, with pride.</p>

<p>"She has got the constitution of a horse."</p>

<p>She was in a fresh dress and her face had no fatigue on it;
she seemed as she had always been. He said: "It's chilly tonight.
Don't you need a shawl, Lucy?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm warm and I'm content."</p>

<p>"You must have been miserably cold, and afraid."</p>

<p>"It was not that bad."</p>

<p>She was as reticent as Logan Stuart had been; both of them
covered their memories. He looked keenly down at her, his small
smile hiding his actual feelings; and her glance came back,
revealing nothing to him.</p>

<p>Overmire said: "Well, Lucy's a good soldier. Never say a
woman's weak. Also, she was in good hands."</p>

<p>Mrs. Overmire said: "I told the Postons we'd come over tonight
for a talk, Jonas." Overmire looked up with a momentary surprise
and then, reading her wishes, rose and walked into the night with
her.</p>

<p>"Your mother," said Camrose, "is always thoughtful. I regret
you didn't get your trip to San Francisco. Will you try
again?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "It doesn't seem that vital now." Then she
saw his change of expression and amended the remark. "Any dress
will do."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said. "You had me frightened. I thought you
might&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't go back to that," she asked him.</p>

<p>"Don't let's try to explain things which shouldn't need
explaining, or keep digging into things which are plain
enough."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it has been a fault of mine," he agreed. He sat down
in Overmire's favorite rocking chair and drew it beside her, his
jealous mind still creating pictures. He kept cautioning himself,
but the strain grew until at last he had to speak. "Lucy," he
said, "you're fond of Logan."</p>

<p>"Logan and I have always been friends. The three of us have
been very close. It is nothing new, is it?"</p>

<p>"When a man and a woman are thrown together, as you were, they
are likely to discover things they had not known before."</p>

<p>"George," she said, "you need not be troubled about that."</p>

<p>He waited with his tense anxiety, expecting her to continue,
to fill in his suspicions or to wipe them away. But her brevity
was like Stuart's, bare and unrevealing. He said: "Naturally, I
have wondered at what might have happened. You see, I have
discovered something about him. I think he loves you."</p>

<p>The steady calm of her expression remained, though he thought
it grew colder. She sat silent, with no warmth coming from her to
him; she was alone and apart from him.</p>

<p>"You're wrong."</p>

<p>"I don't think I am. But I'm not so much concerned about that.
What chills me to the bone is to think you may have changed
toward me. I know I have distressed you at times with my ways,
yet there has never been a moment when I have not thought of you
insistently."</p>

<p>Her smile returned, small and very gentle. He had touched her;
she came back to him from whatever distant place she had been and
looked at him with a quiet and personal regard. "Yes, you have
caused me distress, George."</p>

<p>"I know," he said. Then his curiosity rose and he added: "How
have I?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember how long the days used to be when we did not
see each other? How short they were when we were together? Then
there came a time when you drew back and grew indifferent, as
though you questioned everything between us. It left me outside
of you."</p>

<p>"I have never changed. Only I hate to have you feel I am
greedy or dominating."</p>

<p>"Better that than to be lukewarm."</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "if you knew how desperate I have gotten, how
scarlet my thoughts have sometimes been&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let's have no more questions or explanations. I have got a
white dress. It will do. This is Saturday. Let the ceremony be
next Saturday."</p>

<p>He lifted her hand and put it against his cheek; he was
stirred, and for one rare moment he was humble. "You will have no
regrets."</p>

<p>"Nobody can live without mistakes and regrets," she said.
"Stay close and keep me close. The rest of it does not
matter."</p>

<p>He displayed a slight concern. "I have missed my way here.
We've got to go somewhere else and start fresh. Will it hurt you
so much to leave?"</p>

<p>"It will hurt," she admitted. "But if it must be, I'll not
complain."</p>

<p>He rose, smiling and partially reassured; she had restored
some of his confidence. "You're still tired. I'll see you
tomorrow."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a reserved interest. "What made you say
that about Logan?"</p>

<p>"It was something I thought I saw in him."</p>

<p>"If it were there, I would have seen it long before you," she
said.</p>

<p>As soon as he left the cabin, she relaxed her guard and felt
weary from the strain of holding it against him. It was difficult
to keep from a man the bitter knowledge that the first great
feeling of love had gone, leaving in its wake something less than
love but something more than kindness. There was no precise word
for that emotion or that frame of mind; but it was the thing most
women had to content themselves with in marriage&mdash;the great
and beautiful fire subsided to a few warm coals which furnished a
kind of comfort, but no more than that.</p>

<p>It had never occurred to her that she would be one of those
women; for in the beginning she had been so sure that George
Camrose possessed all the gifts she held dear in a man.</p>

<p>They had been revealed by his laughter, his way of looking at
her, by his moments of warmth and perception. She had been so
sure, two years ago. It was this original sureness which now
haunted her and made her doubt her own instincts, which made her
still cling to George Camrose in the hope of seeing again what
she had once seen.</p>

<p>It was not that she had acted in haste, or that he had been
alone in her mind. She had known Logan Stuart as long as she had
known George; and from the beginning she had felt the pull of
Stuart's personality and the rough impact of his character. She
had judged both these men and had accepted George. Stuart had
never asked her; and now, looking back, she saw that he had drawn
aside in George's favor. There was in Stuart that fixed affection
for, and protectiveness over, George Camrose. Yet even had Stuart
asked her, she would have still taken George.</p>

<p>How was it she had not early seen in him those things she now
clearly saw? How was it he had not stirred her then, but now
shook her by his nearness, by the sound of his voice and the
touch of his hand? It shamed her to realize that she now so often
thought of Stuart in that close and warm way she had once thought
of George. It shook her faith in her own judgment and cheapened
the value of her affections. Time upon time she had sought an
explanation for that change. Was it George whose gradual
revealment of himself had disillusioned her? Or was it Stuart
whose shadow faded out the image of George within her?</p>

<p>She had long known Stuart's feelings for her. He had betrayed
them by his silence, by his tenderness, by his quick quarreling
with her. She pitied Caroline for what Stuart never could give
her, and she hated Caroline for what the girl would have from
him. Jealousy had its cruel and inconstant way with her. But she
could not change her loyalty as she changed a dress. There was a
firmness in life which had to be followed and compromises to be
made, and tragedies, little and great, to be forgotten. Having
taken George Camrose, she would keep him and wait for the old
feeling between them to return. Logan had closed the last chance
for both of them to do it differently. She tought: "If we could
only start over," and thrust that inconstant and futile wish from
her mind.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER 12. &mdash; DECISION OF
THE CAMP</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was still a small group on the street when
Stuart, having had his drink with Thackeray, left Corson's. He
identified the six men clustered together and he nodded at them,
at Joe Harms and Johnny Steele in particular, and passed on to
his store. In the room behind the store, he thrust a revolver
beneath his trouser band, caught up his rifle and let himself
into the night by the back way. He went directly to his barn,
saddled a horse and soon was out of town.</p>

<p>He recognized a greater impatience and a shorter temper within
him, and he suspected it to be caused by the breakup of the old
plain and easy things of his life which he valued so much. It was
grisly business to strip away the tolerance and the generosity of
his friendship with Camrose and dig down into the underlying
substance and at last discover that shoddy material lay there. It
was a denial of all the warm impulses which sustained men and
kept them sweet.</p>

<p>This was the man he protected, and this was the man Lucy was
marrying. "He will lead her through forty years of trouble, and
what will she have to show for it?" Yet there was no way of
changing a woman's heart. Camrose was the man she wanted, and her
wants were too firm to change. He saw the sweetness of her smile
and he felt the constant pressure of her lips; and abruptly he
gave the horse a sharp spurring and galloped down the road.</p>

<p>He saw a light glimmering through the creek willows below him,
shining out of Bragg's cabin. He thought: "The man's a fool to be
around here," and rough feeling spread through him. Fifty feet
from the cabin he got down and led his horse into the trees; and
he halted a moment to survey the area in front of the cabin as it
stood vaguely revealed by the thin moonlight. A horse stood in
the yard and voices came from the cabin&mdash;one voice heavy,
the other a smoother and more metallic tone. That made two within
the cabin.</p>

<p>He crossed the yard and came to the cabin's door. He had left
his rifle in its saddle boot; he stood on the balls of his feet
with his revolver drawn and his free hand stretched toward the
door. Suddenly he lifted the door's latch and drove it open, and
for a moment he had a view of the two men whose voices he had
heard. Both of them&mdash;Bragg and Lestrade&mdash;sat at the
table in the room's center, the lamp between them and the light
of the lamp shining upon them. Their faces came up, startled by
the interruption, and it was Lestrade whose quick mind first
reacted. In another instant his hand swept over the table and
knocked the lamp down. Bragg rose from his chair and made a
diving turn as the light died out.</p>

<p>Stuart shot at that weaving shape and heard the bullet smash
against the farther wall. Kerosene smell drifted through the door
and a bullet came back at him, its echo creating a huge explosion
inside the small cabin. Stuart fired again, stepped aside and
heard Bragg's enormous cursing. They were both shooting at him
with intemperate haste; flattened against the cabin wall, he
heard their feet shuffling ceaselessly back and forth on the hard
dirt floor, he heard them collide and grunt from the impact.
Bragg apparently struck Lestrade out of sudden, thoughtless rage,
for Lestrade's voice rose in passionate resentment. "Keep your
damned brute hands off me!"</p>

<p>Stuart cast a glance sharply behind him, scanning the shadows
for those other men always hanging to Bragg's heels. He saw
nothing to warn him and he stood fast, a growing temper steadily
goading him. He had them trapped but he could not flush them. He
called at them:</p>

<p>"Come out of there!"</p>

<p>"Stuart!" It was Lestrade's voice, heightened by fear.
"Stuart, for God's sakes let me through! Hold your fire!"</p>

<p>"Both of you come out," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"Hold your fire."</p>

<p>"Make a run for it," said Stuart. "I'll let you through."</p>

<p>They had both stopped moving. He heard the sucking whistle of
their aroused breathing; he heard them whispering. Sliding to the
edge of the door, he fired a shot into the cabin and backed away.
Lestrade sent up his terrible cry of protest.</p>

<p>"I'm not in this fight! Logan, remember Marta.
Remember&mdash;" The shuffling of feet began once more and
Lestrade's voice picked up a panic and a trembling.
"Bragg&mdash;stop it! Let go&mdash;let go!"</p>

<p>Stuart backed away from the cabin, not understanding what went
on in there. Bragg seemed to have lost his head, to have attacked
his partner. Lestrade shouted at the top of his voice, then the
cry trailed into strangled fragments.</p>

<p>The doorway showed a heavy shadow, and on this shadow Stuart
took his aim. But he held his fire, careful and puzzled. The
shadow was thick enough for two men and as it moved through the
door, he discovered that it was two men. Then Lestrade shouted,
"I'm in front, Logan. Don't fire!" He was inside the iron hoop of
Bragg's arms, calling and cursing and crying as Bragg backed away
from him toward the end of the cabin. Suddenly Bragg released
Lestrade and there was an obscu flurry between the two men and a
hollow, woody echo clapped over the night. One shape dropped.
Stuart fired on the remaining shape as it faded toward the end of
the cabin. He missed his shot. He growled to himself and rushed
toward the cabin's end, behind which Bragg now had taken shelter;
then he wheeled and aimed at the cabin's other end. He reached it
and went around it to the back side. He walked along the cabin's
length and turned the corner and found Bragg retreating into the
near-by timber. He fired and he saw Bragg jump as though struck.
Bragg came around, issuing a great cry which had no meaning in
it; he returned the fire and got into the brush and made his way
through it with a careless thrashing of his body.</p>

<p>Stuart followed that noisy trail into the brush, suddenly to
find himself facing stillness and pure blackness. Bragg, animal-
sly, had frozen in his covert. He was less than twenty feet away,
betrayed by his heavy, winded breathing. Stuart turned his head,
seeking to orient that source; he took two steps forward and thus
broke the stillness and gave away his own position. Bragg had
waited for this, and at once the big one came at him with a full-
charging fury. Stuart stepped softly aside. He still saw nothing,
but as Bragg went by him, a yard away, he lifted his gun and let
go with the last shot in the revolver.</p>

<p>He had missed again. Meanwhile Bragg, having failed with his
surprise attack, never stopped; his momentum carried him deeper
into the timber. The sound of that huge body grew fainter and
after a while it faded out entirely somewhere in open country.
Turning toward the cabin with disgust stinging him, Stuart
crouched over the shape of Lestrade. He ran a hand across
Lestrade's face; he touched Lestrade's head, and drew his hand
away. This man was dead.</p>

<p>He got hold of Lestrade's arms and dragged the man well off
from the cabin; then he went inside the cabin and lighted a match
and threw it on the lamp's spilled kerosene. He watched the blue
flame start up and crawl out along the floor toward the log wall;
he saw it catch the wall and flicker along the kerosene splashed
there. The light brightened as the fire took hold. When he was
certain it would not die, he turned back to his horse and made
his way toward Jacksonville.</p>

<p>From the slight view point of the military road he looked back
and downward upon the increasing glow of the fire with a taciturn
satisfaction; but his gritty anger remained, his sense of a thing
incompletely done grew greater. He thought carefully of Bragg's
next move, believing he knew what the big one would do: he would
hole up somewhere along the river and would wait for another
chance to attack. Tomorrow, Stuart decided, he would move along
the river in search of Bragg.</p>

<p><br> <br> The little group watched Stuart go into his store.
Then Joe Harms said: "We've got to be careful about him. He'll go
against us."</p>

<p>"Come down to my cabin," said Steele.</p>

<p>The group, now of ten men, quietly drifted to the back edge of
town; when they got to Johnny Steele's cabin there were twelve of
them and they made a tight fit inside Johnny's crowded walls.
Johnny said: "Where's Camrose?"</p>

<p>"Up at the girl's."</p>

<p>"I been a little afraid he'd smell something and run."</p>

<p>"Ain't been a day I've let him get out of my sight," said
Harms. "It's time now to take him in."</p>

<p>"We got to do it quiet," said Steele. "We'll go to his office
and wait until he comes."</p>

<p>Harms said: "We'll have trouble with Stuart." Dick Horeen
shook his head. "Not if he knows Camrose did it."</p>

<p>He was the only one who believed it. "You don't know Stuart,"
said Johnny Steele. "Well, we'll have to be ready for it. Come on
now."</p>

<p>They left the cabin and made a wide circle around the town,
coming at last to Howison's hay barn; they drifted in behind
Camrose's office building, which showed no light. Johnny Steele
gently tried the door's latch. The door opened before him. He
said: "Harms and Horeen&mdash;you come in here with me. Rest of
you stick back in the shadows. Somebody better stay on the street
and watch for him to come."</p>

<p>One of the crowd had already thought of that, and now returned
rapidly. "He's walking this way."</p>

<p>"All right," said Steele and, with his two partners, stepped
inside the room and closed the door. Steele said through the
darkness: "Spread out along the wall."</p>

<p>A key grated in the front door's lock and Camrose came into
the office room, locked the door in the darkness and slowly made
his way across the floor. Presently a match burst the blackness
and a thin shaft of lamplight slid through the partially open
door which stood between the rear room and the front room. None
of the miners were in a position to observe Camrose, but it
appeared he was opening the company safe, for they heard the
click of the tumblers and the groaning of the heavy hinges. There
was a considerable silence after that; then the hinges groaned
again. He picked up the lamp and came forward. The door opened
before him at that instant and he saw them.</p>

<p>Johnny Steele said: "Stand fast, George."</p>

<p>Camrose looked at them and was not particularly concerned. He
had, in fact, a growing air of amusement about him, as though
there were a joke in all this. He held the lamp steady, betraying
no nervousness, and for a moment Johnny Steele doubted his own
suspicions. This man was either exceedingly cool or he had a
clean conscience. In another moment Steele understood why Camrose
was so calm.</p>

<p>"You boys," said Camrose, "are a bunch of fools. Robbery is a
tough thing in this camp. You might make the hills but you'll be
followed and you'll be caught."</p>

<p>"Why, damn your soul," said Joe Harms indignantly, "you take
us for crooks?"</p>

<p>"Then what are you doing here?" asked Camrose.</p>

<p>Johnny Steele reached forward and took the lamp from Camrose's
hands, thus depriving him of a possible weapon. He placed the
lamp on the room's small table. "You know what we're here for,"
he said.</p>

<p>The sound of voices brought the other nine men in from the
darkness, whereupon the observant Johnny Steele saw the
sharpening and thinning intensity come to Camrose's eyes.
Camrose's glance searched the crowd; the normal ruddy color went
from his face and the easy arrogance went from it until his
cheeks were pale as ivory and a kind of numbly sickened cast
showed about his heavy lips. Steele was no longer uncertain; this
man was guilty. The whole thing was a miserable business, but it
helped to know that they were not making a mistake.</p>

<p>"We'll put a guard around the place tonight," he said, "and
we'll have a miners' court for you tomorrow. McIver had a lot of
friends and there might be some thought of quick action. We'll
see it doesn't happen. You're going to get a trial."</p>

<p>"Boys," said Camrose in a tone wholly unlike him, "what have
you got against me?"</p>

<p>"You just look into yourself and find the answer to that."</p>

<p>"No," said Camrose. "What have you got to show against
me?"</p>

<p>"We'll show it at the trial," said Steele. He saw a tensing of
the man's body and a brisker light in the man's eyes. He stepped
forward, made a swift pass with his hands beneath the skirts of
Camrose's coat and stepped back with Camrose's gun. "That was in
your mind, wasn't it, George?"</p>

<p>Camrose shrugged his shoulders. "Have a good time for
yourself, Johnny."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Steele, "I don't like this job. I've been a
friend of yours."</p>

<p>"My God, Johnny," said Camrose, "don't speak the word." He
stared about him; his glance stopped on Harms with contempt and a
distaste. "You are to be congratulated, gentlemen, in the company
you keep. This man, for example. This narrow-eyed, thin-nosed
specimen who hates whatever is bigger than he is and therefore
hates everybody. I should like to see his soul laid before you.
It would shame you for the human race to see the littleness of
it, its crooked turnings, its quavering fear, its sneaking,
creeping, crawling cunning. Here is a weasel in the form of a
man, using his claws to dirty the garments of his betters as they
pass by. He does not belong with you. He doesn't belong in any
company, and he knows it and sits aside on his box and hates the
town and never ceases to use his malice on it. He could be
dangerous if he had courage, but he has no courage. If you struck
him he would cringe, but he would forever hate you and scheme
against you. I'd greatly appreciate it if you'd not have him here
guarding me."</p>

<p>Joe Harms kept his glance on Camrose, and when silence fell he
dropped his head, a small flush on his face. It was an odd
silence which seemed hard to break; and nobody came to Joe
Harms's defense. Finally Steele cleared his throat. "I'll take
first watch with Abrams, Cooney, Geddes and Joe Smith. The rest
of you come back at midnight."</p>

<p>As the others filed out, Steele noticed how calm Camrose had
become; it was the resigned calm of one who had given up most of
his hope.</p>

<p><br> <br> At four o'clock Stuart rose to shave and cook his
breakfast and to spend his time at Clench-field's desk while the
sounds of the awakening town drifted into the store's pungent
stillness and the rising daylight broke the store's gray shadows.
Sunlight came and men moved along the street, all talking.
Clenchfield came in, cranky and taciturn. He got half across the
room and, attracted by something outside, turned back to the
street. Of all this Stuart was only indifferently aware as he
labored with his own particular problems. Then Clenchfield came
in again and silently hung up his coat and hat. Stuart said: "How
much have we got in the safe, Henry?"</p>

<p>"One thousand gold."</p>

<p>"I think I'm going to The Dalles to pick up mules."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Clenchfield. "When will you be goin'?"</p>

<p>"Not today&mdash;not tomorrow. I'm going hunting first."</p>

<p>"A Bragg hunt," said Clenchfield.</p>

<p>Stuart heard talk rising at the east end of town, and
Clenchfield seemed to be waiting for something. "What's on your
mind, Henry?"</p>

<p>"You've not heard the news?" asked Clench-field. "The world is
rockin' this mornin', Logan. Your world will rock hardest. They
have taken Camrose in."</p>

<p>Stuart said quickly: "He's all right, Henry. He's not short.
His accounts will balance. Who took him in? This damned town gets
excited too fast."</p>

<p>"Murder is hard to balance," said Clench-field. "Mack McIver's
murder."</p>

<p>He got from Stuart the roughest glance he had ever received
from any man. The quick and intolerant anger of it troubled him.
It was the way he knew Stuart would take this, believing no evil
of his friend and defending his friend. If the town was against
Camrose, Stuart would be against the town. There was no halfway
to him. "There will be a court on it," said Clench-field. "He
will get his fair hearing."</p>

<p>"God damn that crowd. Who started it?"</p>

<p>"It was something Steele and Joe Harms have been working
on."</p>

<p>Stuart remained still, his mind working in ways which Henry
Clenchfield understood so well. There would not be any thought of
suspicion in Stuart's head; there would be only a sense of the
injustice placed upon Camrose. There would be no thought of
letting this thing run its orderly way. He was a partisan, he was
a rough-handed fighter who took care of his own injustices and
would take care of Camrose's. He would be thinking of action, and
action now. It was reflected in the sudden swing he made toward
the door.</p>

<p>He stopped before he reached the door; for at this moment a
dozen men were coming in, headed by Johnny Steele and Joe
Harms.</p>

<p>"What the hell do you want here?" said Stuart.</p>

<p>Steele was not surprised; he had braced himself for this kind
of reaction and he had carefully prepared himself. "Why, Logan,
that's no way to talk to a friend."</p>

<p>"I don't regard you as a friend," said Stuart bluntly.</p>

<p>Steele shrugged his shoulders. "Sorry it's got to be this way.
McIver was a friend of mine and I'll fight for my friends the
same as you fight for yours. You can see that, can't you?"</p>

<p>"You're a little late bringing this up."</p>

<p>"It took us some time to piece the thing together," said
Steele. "Harms here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Harms," said Stuart, "should have been shot through the head
long ago for looking through keyholes."</p>

<p>Harms flushed and looked around him for support; but none of
the other men seemed disposed to come to his help.</p>

<p>"Well," said Steele, "it's a disagreeable thing. But we've got
to hold a court on it and we need a big room. Your store's the
biggest, Logan. We'll use it."</p>

<p>"No," said Stuart. "I'm not having my friends tried here."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Steele, growing quietly stubborn. "You
can't buck the town. We've got the right to take over what we
want for this thing."</p>

<p>"Who gave you that right?" demanded Stuart.</p>

<p>"If we've got no law in this particular matter, we'll make one
on the spot. You been in mining camps long enough to know that.
We'll use this place."</p>

<p>"You're wrong on that, Johnny."</p>

<p>Steele said, with his steady effort at conciliation: "You
can't buck the town. It is right and you're wrong. Anyhow it is
too strong for you."</p>

<p>"It wasn't very strong when Bragg walked through this street
and kicked you boys around as he pleased. You didn't form any
committees then, Johnny. You were all looking in the other
direction."</p>

<p>More men had gathered in the doorway to view the scene; for
Jacksonville, loving its drama, knew the drama of this situation
very well. Steele shrugged his shoulders. "That's different."</p>

<p>"The difference is you figure Camrose can't hurt you, so
you're brave and full of righteousness. If Bragg came along you'd
run like scattered rats."</p>

<p>Steele flushed but held doggedly to his point. "You've always
been on the right side in this camp. Hate to see you get on the
wrong side."</p>

<p>"I am not wrong because I'm alone. The town's not right
because it has got the numbers. The man who joins the pack
because he's afraid to be outside of the pack is a damned poor
man. The town didn't join me when Bragg came along. I don't join
it now when you're all drunk with the idea of a Roman
holiday."</p>

<p>Steele, agreeable and quiet in most things, could not back
down from his position. He studied the challenge in his mind,
slowly coming to some sort of decision about it; and was slowly
stiffening himself to the decision's disagreeable consequences
when Dick Horren swung the scene away from danger. "No use
arguing," he said. "There's other places. Corson's deadfall will
do. Come on."</p>

<p>Johnny Steele showed a degree of relief and said: "No hard
feelings, Logan."</p>

<p>Stuart looked at him with a thin smile showing. "When we're
through fighting, Johnny, I'll love you like a brother. But while
we're fighting, I'll break every bone in your body, if I
must."</p>

<p>Joe Harms, long silent, now ventured a remark. "You have got
no business&mdash;"</p>

<p>Stuart took two steps forward, struck the man hard enough on
the shoulder to whirl him half about. He seized Harms at arm and
crotch and he lifted him and flung him straight into the crowded
doorway. Harms fell and, in falling, carried another pair of men
down with him. For a moment there was an irritable cursing among
them as they got through the door. Then Harms picked himself up
and shook his fist at Stuart. Stuart watched these men with his
edged smile; he saw them waver between their anger and their
liking for him, and his grin broadened when they moved out. He
stepped through the door among them and moved past them toward
the foot of the street.</p>

<p>He saw a circle of men around Camrose's shop, all armed, and
as he came forward he noticed this circle tighten. Johnny Steele
followed him and Johnny Steele's voice came at him sharply. "Keep
your head, Logan. Got a gun on you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Stuart.</p>

<p>Steele said, "Let him go in," and the guards at the door
stepped aside to let Stuart through. He closed the door and
walked to the rear room. Camrose lay full length on his bed; he
had heard Stuart's steps but he neither rose nor looked at
Stuart. He stared at the ceiling as he spoke. "I thought you'd
come. What do you suppose this thing will amount to?"</p>

<p>"The lads are hunting up a place to hold a court."</p>

<p>"A murder charge calls for a trial before a proper judge and
jury. This thing will turn into a joke&mdash;a damned bad
joke."</p>

<p>"The boys want it done this way. If they can make a case
against you, you may be held over for a proper trial. If not,
they'll let you go and forget it." He looked at Camrose and then
added: "But don't plan on it. With a couple more drinks, the boys
will see to it there's a case against you."</p>

<p>"Then," said Camrose, "I'll not be held over for a proper
trial. They'll come in during the middle of the night and take me
out and hang me."</p>

<p>"That's it," said Stuart.</p>

<p>Camrose lay quite still, with a hand over his eyes. He said in
a soft, flat tone: "How are you going to get me out of this?"</p>

<p>"Take your hand off your face and look at me."</p>

<p>Camrose withdrew his hand and sat upright on the edge of the
bed. He lifted his head to show Logan a pair of bloodshot eyes.
He needed shaving and he needed fresh air; he seemed half stupid.
"Looks like you've been on a hell of a drunk," said Stuart.</p>

<p>"I have," said Camrose. "I drank a quart of whisky between
midnight and breakfast. It was hardly enough. Two quarts would
have been better."</p>

<p>"Keep your eyes on me. Did you kill him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Camrose.</p>

<p>Stuart watched the face of this man who had been so long a
friend, recalling all the shades and shifts of expression Camrose
used to reveal and to cover himself. He searched that disheveled,
half-pale countenance for the truth. There was a dull
indifference in the man, a fatalism which cut his vitality and
shadowed his spirit. It was a strange thing to see.</p>

<p>"Well," said Camrose, "are you convinced?"</p>

<p>"What have they got for evidence?" asked Stuart. "What can
they show?"</p>

<p>"He had his money stored with me. He got it out the night he
died. They think he didn't get it. They think I killed him
because I needed it."</p>

<p>"That's not enough," said Stuart. "What have they got for
proof? Think hard. Can you prove you gave him the money? Can you
show where you were that night? You were with me, part of the
time. You left the shop around ten. Where did you go?"</p>

<p>"To Lestrade's."</p>

<p>Stuart shook his head. "He's no help to you. He's dead."</p>

<p>"I heard about it," said Camrose. "You went to Bragg's last
night, I hear. Well, it's rough on Marta. In a way it is. Then,
in a way it isn't. He wasn't around when I was at the cabin. She
was. She can testify to it. I was there about midnight."</p>

<p>"That's fine," said Stuart irritably. "You were alone with
Marta Lestrade at midnight. How do you suppose that will sound to
the camp?" He stared at Camrose with a growing suspicion. "What
were you doing there? Is there anything between you and
Marta?"</p>

<p>"I don't like you prying into my private affairs, Logan."</p>

<p>"Then maybe I ought to let you handle this alone," said Stuart
bluntly.</p>

<p>"Don't be so rough about it. There's nothing between Marta and
me."</p>

<p>"Think hard," said Stuart. "Think of everything you did that
night, or before that night, or after that night. Get your mind
on it. Is there anything at all they can use against you? Johnny
Steele's no fool. What've you done that's made him certain?"</p>

<p>"They've got no proof of any kind."</p>

<p>"They don't need proof. All they need is two or three things
that look like funny business. They'll string 'em together and
vote you dead. Now how about Harms?"</p>

<p>"God damn Harms," said Camrose, with his first show of energy
during all this talk. "I hate that little yellow dog. Somebody
ought to shoot him. Somebody will." He fell silent, his eyes half
closed, and at last added with sullen reluctance: "He's got
nothing he can use against me."</p>

<p>Stuart listened to the tone, he raked the passive and numbly
set face, and doubted if he had the truth. Here was a man he
thought he knew well; yet here was a man he didn't know at all.
There were black corners in him holding strange qualities which
were better unseen. Out of friendship he had endowed George with
a kind of character he wanted him to have; now he saw it was an
illusion of his own making. Camrose was another kind of man, and
one he liked little. Yet it made no difference; he was bound to
Camrose.</p>

<p>"You look whipped," he said, "You act and talk whipped. What
the hell's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"They've ruined me, I'll have to leave the camp. Even so, it
will follow me. Those things always do."</p>

<p>"I've heard a lot of proud talk from you," said Stuart, "but
evidently it means nothing. You've never had to fight and now you
don't know how. Get up and start wrestling with your
troubles."</p>

<p>"Logan," said Camrose, "get me out of this."</p>

<p>Stuart shook his head, not at the request but at his final
judgment of Camrose. When a man laughed at the rules of the game
and dreamed of making himself big by breaking them, he had to
stand the consequences when he lost; he had to be as tough when
the rules broke him as when he broke the rules. But Camrose
wasn't tough. He could only play the winning half of the game; he
could not play the losing half.</p>

<p>This was the end of a man who had defied the world. It was a
sorry thing to see.</p>

<p>"Get me out of it, Logan," said Camrose, in a quicker
voice.</p>

<p>"I'll see what can be done," said Stuart and turned to the
door.</p>

<p>Camrose called at him quite sharply and when Stuart turned he
saw his friend upright in the room, haggard, swaying a little on
his feet, with his hair fallen down over his forehead. The
gallantry and the laughter were gone, leaving nothing very
admirable. "I was a friend when the weather was fair," he said.
"Now you'll let them tear me apart." He stared at Stuart with a
growing cynicism. "I'll be out of your road. It will make things
easier for you, won't it?"</p>

<p>Stuart shook his head and left the room. The guards were in
front of the building, facing the growing crowd; and Lucy was
just then coming forward. She stared at Stuart without speaking,
and he gave her a short nod and went on up the street to the
store. He sat down on a pile of boxes and he filled and lighted
his pipe and sat forward with his hands across his knees,
engrossed in a problem that seemed to have no answer.</p>

<p>Men were moving back toward Corson's deadfall and a little
later Lucy came into the store. He put aside his pipe and looked
up to her; he had the greatest kind of curiosity as to her
feelings in the matter but he made out nothing particular on her
face. She said in a tone of mild surprise: "The camp doesn't like
George. I never knew that before. These men mean to hang him. I
can tell it. What will you do?"</p>

<p>"What should I do?" he said.</p>

<p>"You're sitting there trying to think of something. I know you
so much better than I know anybody else. You'd like to break down
that building and let him out. It is quite clear on your face.
Your mind is going up and down and back and forth. You're hunting
a way. I don't need to say it, but I will anyhow. Do what you
can. I'm asking it for a particular reason."</p>

<p>"I know the reason well enough," he said.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I think you don't." She stood a moment longer
and then turned out of the store.</p>

<p>He called after her. "Have your father defend him."</p>

<p><br> <br> Bragg slept in the willows a mile removed from his
cabin and woke at daylight with a disposition made worse by the
night's discomfort. He flattened by the creek for a drink and he
stood in the morning's curt air and made debate with himself. He
had no desire to go back to the ruined cabin, or to the dead
Lestrade; no doubt there would be a bunch from the camp waiting
for him, and ready to make short work of him. Stuart would see to
that end of it.</p>

<p>Somewhere around the country were his two followers, but he
had no interest in finding them. Having been burned out, he was
footloose and did not particularly care. One camp was as good as
another for his work and if Jacksonville was no longer open to
him, it was a simple business to move on. It made no great
difference.</p>

<p>But he would not go until he had reached out with his great
arms and pulled Stuart down; all the tremendous hatred of which
he was capable now fastened itself to Stuart, and would be
satisfied with nothing less. It took him but a few moments to
make a decision on that; he would stray over to the Rogue and,
keeping to the river's thicket, follow toward the Oregon-
California road. Sooner or later Stuart would be coming along
it.</p>

<p>The hard ground had stiffened him, hunger worked at him, and
the night's coldness had permitted him little sleep; and so he
made his lumbering way through the valley's brush and across the
open meadows toward the Rogue in the manner of a surly bear. At
the river he flattened for another drink, and he sat in a patch
of sunshine until warmth came to him. Rising again, he walked
casually on. Evans's Ferry was three miles distant; at that point
he promised himself a good meal. The ferryman was no friend of
his, but would not dare refuse him.</p>

<p>Somewhere short of that point, unaccustomed to walking, he sat
down and he lay back in the willows to rest himself; and so fell
asleep. In his sleep he heard a voice speak and then he woke, and
heard two voices near the river. He rose on his haunches and
crawled forward and slowly parted the willows until he had a view
of two Indian women, both young, standing neck deep in the
river.</p>

<p>He watched them for a long while&mdash;solemn, intent,
unemotional. He looked beyond them, up and down the bank, and saw
no other Indians. There would be no Rogue men close by, he
guessed, since these girls were swimming; they had gotten
themselves away from the party to do this. He drew a long breath
and, when they were about to come out of the water, he rose and
gathered himself. He was foxy in his stalking; he waited until
they had gotten ashore to their clothes. Then, parting the brush,
he made his rush at them.</p>

<p>They heard his body crushing across the river's gravel and
turned at once to discover this shocking and formidable figure
charging forward, his blackly whiskered face all scarred and
torn, his heavy chest issuing strange sounds. They saw him and
broke away in full flight across the gravel in their bare feet.
One of them got to the river and soon gained the middle of the
stream; the other kept to the shore and presently drew away from
him. Realizing he had no luck, Bragg stopped short, whipped out
his gun and fired at the running girl. He dropped her and then
turned his aim to the girl in the river. She understood what he
was about to do, but she made no cry at all; she went beneath the
surface to escape him and he saw the shadow of her body drifting
with the current. He walked along the shore, keeping abreast.
When she rose for air he shot at her and missed, and watched her
sink again. He kept walking and he shot a second time; he broke
into a run and got ahead of her, and stopped for better aim. His
third shot caught her; he watched her body roll and her head
drop. To make sure she was dead, he fired again and saw her body
flinch slightly in the water. He squatted on the gravel and
reloaded his gun and he took the time to fill his pipe and light
it. The sun was rising east of the river; he looked at it, his
beaten lips drawing back from his teeth. Then he rose and
returned to the willows and continued his march toward
Evans's.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER 13. &mdash; AT
CORSON'S</h2>

<p class="first">CAMROSE stood against one of Corson's walls,
with Overmire beside him and Johnny Steele near by. The judge a
miner popularly elected for the occasion&mdash;sat on the edge of
Corson's bar with his feet hanging down. He had a snow-white
beard slightly rusted around the edges of his mouth, and he took
the occasion with considerable dignity, and therefore made a
satisfactorily ornamental judge. The rest of the room was packed
its length and breadth, and the windows had been taken down so
that others could look in from the street. Johnny Steele was at
the moment telling his story.</p>

<p>"One night I came into camp and asked Camrose for my poke,
which was in his safe. He locked the door on me while he opened
the safe, which took him a long time. Then he let me into the
shop and gave me my poke. It weighed out all right, and I had
nothing to be suspicious of. Nevertheless I was, so I got to
talking around camp and found Camrose was losing more money at
poker than he could afford."</p>

<p>Overmire stopped him. "That's hearsay, Johnny."</p>

<p>"Well, the whole camp knows it."</p>

<p>"The whole camp has heard stories of it, but the whole camp
does not know it. You cannot convict him on what you have heard
somebody else say."</p>

<p>"If I saw something," said Johnny, "and I told it to Bill
Smith, then Bill Smith would know it as well as me."</p>

<p>Overmire was about fifteen feet from Steele. He reached for a
coin and dropped it on the bar so that everybody could hear its
echo. "Johnny, what have I got here?"</p>

<p>Johnny, suspecting Overmire, gave the coin a long and thorough
glance. "A dollar."</p>

<p>"What kind of dollar?"</p>

<p>"A silver dollar."</p>

<p>"You're certain of it?"</p>

<p>Johnny looked again. "I'm dead certain of it."</p>

<p>Overmire picked up the coin between thumb and forefinger,
showing it to the crowd.</p>

<p>He pointed to a man in the back of the room. "What does it
look like to you, Moffatt?"</p>

<p>"Looks like a dollar to me."</p>

<p>Overmire pointed at another man, drawing a like answer. He
solicited the answer of several miners until at last one of them
said: "You're wastin' time, Jonas. It's a plain old U.S.
dollar."</p>

<p>"So, then," said Overmire, "you say it's a plain old U.S.
dollar. Johnny has identified it and you take Johnny's testimony
because you believe him to be a truthful man. He did not try to
mislead you. He said it was a dollar. You jumped one step farther
and made a U.S. dollar out of it, which is not true. It is
Mexican. And that is the danger and unrealiability of hearsay
evidence. What you do not see yourself, you cannot honestly swear
to be true. As a matter of fact, you cannot always be certain
that what you see is wholly true. Your eyes or your ears may
betray you Johnny Steele studied Overmire a thoughtful while. He
had a plain face made shrewd by a great amount of native
intelligence and mental force. Of education he owned little and,
like most men of that sort, he possessed both a respect for and a
suspicion of those who were considerably schooled. Wanting wise
counsel for himself, he would at once have gone to Overmire with
fullest confidence; but with Overmire pitted against him he
greatly feared the man's power to sway this audience and jury by
words too cleverly used. The silver-dollar business was something
these miners could see and appreciate; they had been influenced
by it. He looked at Overmire, measuring the man; and Overmire,
smiling and practical and folksy, looked back at him. Overmire
and he both knew the game that was being played.</p>

<p>"It grew on me," went on Johnny Steele, "that Camrose was
short with his accounts and was diddling with dust entrusted to
him to temporarily square those accounts. He was losing a lot of
money at poker&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hearsay, Johnny," interposed Overmire.</p>

<p>"Thackeray," called Johnny Steele.</p>

<p>The gambler Thackeray made his way forward, his habitual
coolness somewhat broken by being the center of the scene.</p>

<p>"Thackeray," said Steele, "did Camrose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Swear him in first, Johnny," said Overmire. "You're trying a
man for his life. Life is precious to you, isn't it? It is
equally precious to George Camrose. Let us remember it is good to
be alive, to wake to a fine morning with the sun coming up over
the hill, to smell bacon frying in the pan, to drink the cold
creek water when thirsty. It is good to sit in Corson's by night,
the taste of whisky and a cigar on your tongue, feeling easy
after a long day. A man lives a short time. He has his thoughts
and his wants and his dreams and his memories, his regrets and
his loves. Those things are not to be taken away by a few words
lightly spoken. Swear him in, Johnny."</p>

<p>Overmire had spoken in a wholly conversational voice, as
though making a simple observation among friends. But Johnny
observed the effect of that talk and was troubled. He said: "Life
was good to McIver, too. And it was taken from him."</p>

<p>"Was it taken from him," said Overmire, "or was it an
accident? That's what we're trying to discover."</p>

<p>Nobody had thought of needing a Bible; but after some pause, a
lean and shabby miner plucked a considerably twisted little book
from his pocket. "New Testament do?"</p>

<p>Thackeray put his hand gingerly upon the New Testament and was
sworn in.</p>

<p>"Now," said Steele, "did Camrose play poker with you?"</p>

<p>"Frequently."</p>

<p>"So, after beating around Robin Hood's barn," said Steele with
deliberate irony, "we discover what everybody in town already
knew. Did he lose money to you?"</p>

<p>"Considerable."</p>

<p>"Which everybody also knew," commented Steele. "Now it's legal
ain't it, Jonas? Thackeray, how much would you say he lost to
you?"</p>

<p>"Over a year or two, maybe five thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"His salary is less than that," said Steele to the crowd. Then
he caught himself before Over-mire could interpose. "Swear in
Camrose."</p>

<p>Somebody gave Camrose the Testament while Overmire swore him
in. "Now, George," said Steele, "what's your pay?"</p>

<p>"Two-fifty a month."</p>

<p>"Three thousand a year. But you lost two thousand more than
you made. Where did it come from?"</p>

<p>"Some, of it was Logan Stuart's. He had lent it to me for
other purposes."</p>

<p>"For what purposes?"</p>

<p>"I won't say."</p>

<p>"You are on trial and you have got to answer the
questions."</p>

<p>Overmire shook his head. "No accused man can be compelled to
speak if he wishes to remain silent. That's the law, Johnny."</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Johnny, and knew he had an opening. He turned to
the crowd. "If a man is innocent, why should he be afraid to
speak?"</p>

<p>Heads began to nod before him in agreement. He had made his
point, but Overmire, dueling each foot of this ground, spoke up.
"I can answer that, Johnny." His glance went around the crowd and
paused on Lid Shields. "Suppose Lid were walking up the street
one night. Lid is going some place on an errand of his
own&mdash;"</p>

<p>The crowd began to grin. Lid Shields's errands were well known
and his destination was common knowledge, being the shack
slightly beyond town which housed a woman. "So," said Overmire,
"there is a killing on the street and Lid is accused and brought
in. Somebody asks Lid, 'Where were you at that hour?' Lid cannot
be forced to answer a question like that."</p>

<p>Johnny Steele pointed at Joe Harms. "Joe, come up here."</p>

<p>Harms shuffled forward, looking at nobody; he had his eyes
pinned to a point on the wall, above and beyond the picturesque
and silent judge. Steele swore him in. "Now Joe, did you ever see
Camrose take gold pokes out of the office safe and shake dust
from them?"</p>

<p>"Several times&mdash;late at night after he had locked the
office door and closed the shutters. I've seen him weigh dust out
of one poke, put it in another, weigh that poke, fix up the
nuggets on top of the poke and put it back in the safe."</p>

<p>"Where were you?" asked Overmire.</p>

<p>"In the alley between Howison's and Cam-rose's."</p>

<p>Overmire studied Harms during a deliberately held
silence&mdash;and this silence also had its effect on the crowd;
it gave them time to think, and it piled weight on Harms, who
shifted his position and looked around him. Then Overmire put his
question softly: "How could you see all this?"</p>

<p>"There's a knothole, size of a robin's egg, in the boards.
Lookin' through, I could just see the counter and the gold
scales."</p>

<p>"You looked through the knothole quite often, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Every night," said Harms, "for some months."</p>

<p>"What made you start looking?"</p>

<p>"Never liked him. I was looking to see what I could find."</p>

<p>Overmire ran a hand down his beard and once more let the
silence run. Harms's evidence supported what the camp suspected,
and therefore it could not be wholly overthrown. Yet Overmire was
well aware of the camp's general dislike of Harms and so he took
a new line. "You spied on him because you didn't like him. Now,
Joe, I guess I've talked with you as much as any man in camp. I
have never heard you praise any human being. You dislike a great
many people. Do you spy on all those people, too?"</p>

<p>Harms angrily met Overmire's glance. "No."</p>

<p>"Ever spy on anybody else?"</p>

<p>"No," said Harms, but it was clear to Over-mire that this man
lied, and it was clear as well to the crowd. Johnny Steele
suddenly put in, "That's enough. I guess we've proved Camrose did
monkey with the dust in those pokes."</p>

<p>"Maybe he was weighing out company money&mdash;which would be
a legitimate part of his work," said Overmire.</p>

<p>Steele let that point go by. "Now, then. Mack McIver came into
town. He played cards late one night. Next morning he was found
dead with his face in the creek. A bunch of us went to Camrose's
to get his dust and send it to his people. Camrose said Mack had
already got the dust. But there was no dust on Mack when he was
found."</p>

<p>He disliked what was to come next. It made him seem on Harms's
level, and it offended his own strong sense of fitness. But he
had it to say, and he said it: "I decided maybe we hadn't looked
through Mack's pockets well enough. Harms and me dug him up and
took another look. We found something. It was in the little watch
pocket at the top of his pants."</p>

<p>Everybody watched him as he drew a small bit of paper from his
coat and opened it between his fingers. Overmire regarded it
alertly and Harms for the first time began to look directly at
the men around him, his self-respect somewhat restored. But it
was Camrose whose reaction Steele wondered at. Swiftly lifting
his glance, he caught the tightening expression on Camrose's
face.</p>

<p>"This," said Johnny Steele, "is a receipt. Camrose gave it to.
Mack when Mack left the gold on deposit. If he had it on him when
he died, he never got the gold, for it's sure Camrose would have
asked for the receipt back."</p>

<p>Overmire shot a question at Harms. "Did you see Steele find
this receipt on McIver's body?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you read it as soon as it was removed?"</p>

<p>"We turned the lantern on its first thing to see what it
was."</p>

<p>Overmire extended his arm and took the paper and looked
carefully at it. He showed it to Camrose. "This your
writing?"</p>

<p>Camrose gave it a short glance. "Yes," he said in no
particular tone.</p>

<p>Johnny Steele put a quick question at Cam-rose. "If you gave
him the gold why didn't you take the receipt from him?"</p>

<p>The crowd waited with a strange and significant silence while
Camrose formed his answer. Overmire, looking out at the miners,
silently guessed they had swung against Camrose. "I seldom give
out receipts," said Camrose. "You'll remember, Johnny, I never
gave you a receipt for your gold. I put it in the safe for you,
and I gave it back when you asked for it. That's been my common
practice, as you boys know. But Mack was a suspicious man and
wanted a receipt. I gave him one. When he got the gold back I
never thought to ask for the receipt. I had forgotten about it,
since it wasn't a customary thing with me."</p>

<p>"Careless, I'd say," commented Steele.</p>

<p>"We're all careless with gold. It's the cheapest thing in
camp."</p>

<p>Johnny Steele stood in silence, thinking his way through and
around the answer, until Over-mire at last prompted him. "Is that
all, Johnny? If so, it isn't enough. On the testimony of a
Peeping Tom you have tried to show that Camrose shifted gold from
one poke to another. On the basis of an unreturned receipt you
deny Camrose gave back McIver's poke. It is not enough to deny
it. It is necessary for you to prove it, which you have not done.
Yet, assuming you had proved both points&mdash;you would still
need to connect them to the murder and prove the murder. You have
not done it. You have only said that Camrose murdered McIver and
waved suspicion like a bloody flag at this crowd, hoping for
passion to convict Camrose. You brewed a witch's tale and you
believed it&mdash;and now are trying to make witches of us
all."</p>

<p>Johnny Steele said, "Come up, Pat Malloy."</p>

<p>Pat Malloy was a substantial ex-miner who had graduated by use
of his wits and his thrift to the station of a storekeeper of
small consequence; he had a brilliant red face, a stubby round
nose and a set of roan eyebrows projecting over his eyes in such
a manner that he seemed to be peering out from a shelter. Johnny
Steele swore him in. "Tell us, Pat."</p>

<p>"What I was tellin' you? Well, he came into the store one
night.&mdash;a week ago&mdash;and he wanted a box of cigars, the
kind of which I get from San Francisco&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who came in?" asked Overmire.</p>

<p>"Wasn't we talkin' of Camrose? Him. I sold him the cigars and
he gave me a nugget, and I weighed it and I gave him change. It
was a fat thing of a nugget and pretty the way it was shaped.
Pretty for an Irishman, that is. It was that much like a
shamrock. So I made a little frame for it and set it up in the
shop. The very next day Jim Hantis came in and he said: 'Where
did you get McIver's lucky nugget?' Then it was three or four men
who said it durin' the day and the next day."</p>

<p>Johnny Steele said: "Jim&mdash;and the rest of you&mdash;come
up here."</p>

<p>Overmire gave his beard a strong pull and drew a long breath.
He looked upon Camrose with a flat neutral glance. Camrose had
the old, indifferent and withdrawn look to him again; he held
himself straight and he seemed not to care. Hantis and the other
three men, being sworn, one by one identified the nugget, and
afterwards Overmire&mdash;scanning the crowd&mdash;saw there was
no hope.</p>

<p>Johnny Steele said in a pleased and positive voice: "There is
the case, Jonas. Twist it if you can."</p>

<p>"In all this where have you shown the connection between the
nugget and the fact of murder?"</p>

<p>"That nugget was McIver's lucky piece," said Steele. "He found
it four-five years ago and he always carried it in his left-hand
pants pocket. How did Camrose get it? He could only have gotten
it by taking it out of McIver's pocket. And he could have done it
only at a time when Mack could not resist. In other words, when
Mack was dead. I make murder out of that."</p>

<p>Overmire turned to Camrose. "You care to comment on that,
George?"</p>

<p>"I took a fancy to it," said Camrose. "I offered him twenty
dollars for it and he accepted."</p>

<p>Jim Hantis&mdash;and the other three friends of
McIver's&mdash;all shook their heads in disagreement, and Hantis
said positively: "McIver would never sell it. He had better
offers than twenty dollars for it. He was a suspicious man and he
was a superstitious man. He would have quit prospecting if he'd
lost that nugget. He told me so many a time."</p>

<p>Johnny Steele had a closing speech in mind, and he had other
witnesses. But he knew the men of this camp and as he looked
around the crowd he realized he had made as good a case against
Camrose as he would ever need to make. He turned to Overmire. "I
am through. Your man is a guilty man, Jonas, and everybody in
this room is convinced of it except you. You go ahead, Jonas, and
throw your big words at us to confuse us. You talk about life
being sweet. You talk about silver dollars and hearsay and all
that. You try to make us cry, and make us doubt. You won't have
luck. McIver is dead and his lucky nugget turned up in Camrose's
hands&mdash;Camrose who has been having money trouble for a long
time. We didn't take Cam-rose's hand and lead him to the scene of
the murder and show him with a club in his hand. But we showed
him with the nugget in his hand, and you can't explain that away.
We all love life just as much as you, and we're all for fair
play, but we want fair play for McIver as well as Camrose.
There's such a thing as common sense which is a greater thing
than all your rules and your warnings&mdash;common sense says
he's guilty."</p>

<p>He stepped back to a corner of the room, fearing the speech
Overmire was about to make, fearing the effect of the man's
persuasiveness and umblemished reputation. He admired Over-mire
greatly and he knew the rest of the camp also admired the power,
the force, the fairness and the resolution of Overmire. It was a
thing for a camp to be proud of, the presence of such a man as a
citizen.</p>

<p>Overmire stood beside Camrose. He was in no hurry to make a
reply, since any reply called for a good deal of earnestness and
conviction on his part; and the more he had listened to the
testimony, the greater had become his doubt. He stood in a
strange position. He was a future father-in-law to the man as
well as an advocate. On both grounds he was obliged to give Cam-
rose the best of his ability; and it distressed him to have his
private feelings tell him he was defending a guilty man. He ran a
hand thoughtfully down his beard; he made a gesture. The miners
were of course expecting him to plead; they were looking forward
to it, much as they arranged themselves to hear a Fourth of July
oration.</p>

<p>"You're neighbors of mine," he said, "and I know you well. I
understand exactly what you're thinking now. You know that this
is not a legal trial. The laws of this territory are in force
here, and this meeting has no sanction. It is only a popular
assembly such as we had a few years ago, before law came. If you
vote this man guilty, you must still hold him over to a regular
court and a regular trial."</p>

<p>He searched them with his trenchant glance and he saw he had
their attention. "But you feel that this is a good enough trial.
It was the way it was done in the old days. In your minds you
have got the thing planned out. You intend to vote Camrose guilty
and then, to save any possible miscarriage of your judgment, you
will take him from his place of detention sometime after dark and
hang him."</p>

<p>Looking about the crowd, he saw heads quietly nodding, and
here and there a glance of admiration for his shrewdness. "What
was law written for, if not to protect us all? Then let it
protect Camrose as well as you. I could take the same set of
facts which Johnny Steele used and I could convict any other man
in this camp, guilty or innocent, if you disliked that man as
much as you dislike Camrose. There is just enough logic in the
facts to convince you. But there is also just enough looseness in
them to kill an innocent man. In voting this man dead on that set
of facts, you are setting a scene for another day when you may be
voting one of yourselves dead on precisely the same set of facts.
Now let us have your vote."</p>

<p>Johnny Steele was surprised, but also relieved, at the brevity
of the plea and came forward at once. He said: "All that think he
is not guilty, squat down on the floor."</p>

<p>Camrose gave his head a quick turn and his eyes went along the
ranks of men with narrowed fascination. Two men in the fore of
the crowd squatted immediately; there was some commotion in the
back of the room as another man awkwardly attempted to lower
himself. Otherwise the crowd stood still. It was an overwhelming
vote. There had been some small play of light on Camrose's cheeks
but now the watching miners&mdash;all keenly interested in seeing
how he took his luck&mdash;observed dullness come to him. He
turned his head away.</p>

<p>Throughout this affair Johnny Steele had pitted all his
resources against a man he considered highly dangerous to his
cause. Yet now that it was done and he had won his victory, he
had a reversal of feeling. Before all the camp, Jonas Overmire
stood for certain decent standards; his good opinion greatly
mattered. Therefore Johnny Steele had the real fear that Overmire
might feel he&mdash;as well as the rest of the camp had acted out
of baser motive than they should. "Jonas," he said earnestly,
"this may not square with your idea of proper form, but it is our
idea of justice nevertheless. I hope you do not think
otherwise."</p>

<p>Overmire made a small gesture with his hand. "If I did not
believe you to be sound and honest men I would not live in this
camp."</p>

<p><br> <br> Overmire left Corson's and crossed to Stuart's
store, finding Stuart seated in a corner with his pipe. Stuart
was anxious for the answer but he waited for it instead of asking
for it.</p>

<p>Overmire said, "Guilty," and sat down on another box and
searched himself for a cigar.</p>

<p>He trimmed it and he lighted it and he leaned back to an easy
position. "You know," he said, "I am a strong believer in
democracy. I have the greatest of faith in the ability of any
group of Americans to come to a just decision. Haste and passion
and prejudice and self-interest will sway us all at times. Now
and then we make bad errors. Sometimes we follow bad leaders.
Sometimes we descend to the animal level and are no better than
the dumbest and angriest of beasts. But when you average
everything out, one time upon another, one act upon another, one
motive upon another, we live according to our lights&mdash;and
our lights are honest and kind and colored with mercy."</p>

<p>"What do you mean to tell me by all that, Jonas?"</p>

<p>"There's always doubt," said Overmire. "But it was clear and
plain enough to me. If I were a judge I should agree with the
verdict and I should sentence George Camrose to be hung. Did you
know about the nugget?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Overmire settled back and made a verbal transcript of all the
evidence. When he was through, Stuart gave a short nod. He was
not a man, Overmire thought, to reveal himself much; he stuck by
his own standards, and he was singularly independent in his
actions. It was this independence which gave Overmire some
concern.</p>

<p>"Now," said Stuart, "they've got him back at his store under
guard. They will take him out and hang him before morning."</p>

<p>"Maybe not."</p>

<p>Stuart shook his head. "If they had been willing to wait for a
proper court and jury they would not have bothered with this
meeting. This meeting is enough for them. They'll act on it."</p>

<p>"Johnny Steele started this, but Johnny's no firebrand. He
won't stir them into violence."</p>

<p>"Johnny believes Camrose guilty," said Stuart. "According to
Johnny's lights justice has got to be done, the sooner the
better."</p>

<p>"You're a miner at heart," said Overmire. "What would you
do&mdash;if Camrose were not your friend?"</p>

<p>"I would help hang him, Jonas. That's why I know they
will."</p>

<p>"So would I," said Overmire, and tapped Logan Stuart's knee.
"Maybe you have done all you could do, and maybe you should do no
more."</p>

<p>"What would that be?"</p>

<p>"You're figuring a way to get him loose. That means you've got
to go against the crowd. The camp respects you, Logan. But it
respects its own decision more. If&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucy came into the store. "What was it?"</p>

<p>"Guilty," said Overmire and did not meet his daughter's eyes.
He made it blunt and swift, since he was a tenderhearted man.</p>

<p>She gave him a strained glance and then she was done with him,
and turned her attention to Stuart. Whatever her hope was, it
seemed to lie in him. "How could they?"</p>

<p>Overmire said, "Listen," and quietly repeated the testimony.
Then he said: "That's how." She had again turned her attention to
Stuart, and Overmire, seeing and understanding it, added
irritably: "Don't beg Logan for help."</p>

<p>"When I needed help, I've always come to Logan. Why shouldn't
I now?"</p>

<p>"Because he'll try to do what you want, and get himself in a
hell of a lot of trouble. I think there's been enough disaster
caused by Cam-rose."</p>

<p>"Do you think he did all this, Dad?"</p>

<p>He rubbed his whiskers with the point of a finger. "I'm
convinced of his guilt. He is a weak man."</p>

<p>This scene was interrupted by the marching in of four men,
headed by Johnny Steele. It was a committee, and a self-conscious
one, even Johnny Steele showing a reluctance in the matter to be
discussed.</p>

<p>"Logan," he said, "it occurs to us you may give us some
trouble. It would be like you to come down the street with the
idea of getting Camrose free. It would be disagreeable. But,
disagreeable or not, we'd shoot you for tryin'. Don't try."</p>

<p>"That's plain," said Stuart. "I'm glad you told me."</p>

<p>"Don't do it, Logan," repeated Johnny Steele, with all the
earnestness he could command.</p>

<p>Then, done with an unpleasant chore, the committee left the
store.</p>

<p>"That's it," said Overmire to Lucy. "Don't ask Logan for
anything more."</p>

<p>It appeared that neither Logan nor Lucy had heard him. They
were watching each other, Logan with his closest attention, Lucy
with an expression wholly unlike her. It was neither anger nor
appeal; it seemed a more primitive thing&mdash;as though she were
silently delivering an unpleasant command to him. He grew
uncomfortable at sight of it and glanced at Logan to observe the
latter's reaction, and found nothing. These two had a way of
speaking to each other in complete silence. In another moment
Lucy turned and left the room. But something had been said
between these two, for Stuart had nodded to Lucy as she turned
away.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER 14. &mdash;
OUTBREAK</h2>

<p class="first">AT three o'clock in the afternoon, Liza Bartlett
left the cabin and walked diagonally across the meadow to where
her husband was sawing out the winter's wood from a huge fir
windfall; she carried a jug of coffee for him and the two of them
sat on the log, alternately taking turns at the jug. She was the
sober one of the pair, enormously determined to be a faithful and
provident wife; it was young Gray who had the streak of fun in
him&mdash;and it was he who spilled the coffee as he tried to
seize and kiss her. "My old woman," he said and fell from the
log. He was at the base of the log, laughing. She stood over him,
facing the river and the river's willows, and suddenly he saw
fear stretch and whiten her face, and he saw her lips form a
word. Springing up he discovered a group of Indians&mdash;a swift
sweep of the eye counted twenty of them&mdash;coming from the
brush in a fan-shaped line, all trotting forward. One buck lifted
his rifle and another buck whipped an arrow into his bow.</p>

<p>"Gray!" cried young Liza. "Gray!"</p>

<p>He reached for his own rifle propped against the log and shot
the foremost Indian; then an arrow caught him in the shoulder and
went deep, the shaft sticking from him. He shouted, "Run for the
cabin!" Young Liza wheeled and came to him and put her arms
around him. He pushed her away and got his ax and he stood with
the fir log as a bulwark before him. He saw that Liza would not
run and he shoved her below the log as the Rogues, still
trotting, came to the log and spilled over it. A second shot
killed him and the butt of another gun burst Liza Bartlett's head
as she crouched by her husband and called to him. Her last
gesture, as she died, was to put her arm upon him...</p>

<p>The Rogues, rising out of the hidden creases of their
reservation, followed the river's turnings, a band to one side of
it and a band to the other. At McTeague's they were met by a
well-determined fire, and, following two or three unsuccessful
sallies, passed on to the Montgomery's cabin where they found
Mrs. Montgomery and her baby alone. They caught the baby by the
heels and dashed it against the cabin wall; they stabbed Mrs.
Montgomery to death, pillaged the cabin and set it afire, and
continued along the valley with the various household trinkets of
the Montgomery family hung at their belts or knotted from their
shoulders. At Part-land's they found an empty cabin and burned
it; from the adjacent brush young Sam Rails saw the copper
skirmish line coming over the meadow and fright gave him speed as
he fled off to warn other settlers. Reaching Oldham's, the Rogues
came upon a harder opposition and after an hour of intermittent
firing, they continued their march to the Allen cabin. The sound
of firing in the distance had warned Mrs. Allen in time. Taking
her boy, she ran out to a brush pile in the meadow and buried her
son and herself in it. With a hand held over the mouth of the
whimpering youngster, she watched her cabin go up in
flames&mdash;and lay there terrified long after the Rogues had
gone.</p>

<p>The word of rebellions had apparently gone out to all the
bands in these southern hills; for that same afternoon the miners
along the Applegate were harassed and far down the river a band
was seen on the Big Meadow bar. Over on the Crescent City trail,
the Stuart pack train returning from the coast was caught and
destroyed, beasts and men, and the supplies broken open and
scattered through the timber.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the groups along the upper valley, passing the lower
ferry without molesting it, came upon another Stuart pack train,
then on its homeward trip from Scottsburg. Blazier and Murrow had
some small warning and they hastily forted up in the brush to
make a fight of it. Here, as elsewhere, a sense of haste impelled
the Indians to make only half a try on those parties who showed
resistance. They killed all the mules and mortally wounded
Murrow; then, afraid to go deeper into the brush to catch
Blazier, they went on toward Dance's, two miles north. Blazier
made an attempt to bind up Murrow's torn side, but the older man,
smiling at him regretfully, dropped back dead. Blazier, thinking
of Caroline Dance, made his way toward that cabin, keeping close
to the timber and the brush.</p>

<p>From the distance he heard a steady and stubborn fire which
lasted for the best part of half an hour. Then it died away
entirely and when Blazier came within view of the cabin he saw no
sign of Indians or settlers. All the haycocks in the meadow were
afire, and the sheds as well; but the main house stood. He weaved
his way through the brush until he came within fifty yards of the
place, and here he stopped and scanned the edges of the meadow
and listened into the dwindling daylight for sounds. Presently he
called&mdash;and heard a voice answer from the house.</p>

<p>He cut over the trail and went into the house. Mrs. Dance sat
in a rocker with her husband dead on the floor and one son lying
across the threshold of the rear doorway. He said: "Where's the
other boys&mdash;where's Caroline?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I don't know. The boys are on a trip to
the Applegate. Caroline&mdash;last I saw she was at the farther
edge of the meadow lookin' for the no-horn cow."</p>

<p>"I'll stay around until help comes," he said.</p>

<p>"I'll go over the meadow and look."</p>

<p>"Caroline always could take care of herself," said Mrs. Dance
in a dazed, erratic way. "She's all right. She'll be back when
she finds the cow."</p>

<p><br> <br> At noon, Stuart cooked his lunch in the back room;
at one o'clock he left the store and walked down the street, past
Camrose's office&mdash;the guards closely watching him&mdash;and
out beyond the edge of the camp. He was not a man who could long
endure sober reflection without growing stale and jaded and
impatient. Action was his life, action made him run sweet and
smooth; and so he tackled the rough foothills and drew sweat and
felt wind pull through his lungs, and at three o'clock he
returned to the store and sat down on a box with his pipe. Some
kind of serenity had come to him, but the answer to his problem
had not. The problem was&mdash;what now was his duty to
Camrose?</p>

<p>He had long shut his eyes to the man's shortcomings. To those
whom George Camrose liked&mdash;and therefore made the effort to
please it was an easy thing to find excuses for his moods, his
easy indifference, his habit of taking so much for granted, his
way of leaning on others. The man had charm when he chose to use
it. But the veneer of charm had worn through the inner man showed
out as a very shoddy material. Of Camrose's guilt, both in the
matter of theft and in the matter of murder, Stuart had little
doubt. The judgment of the camp was sound; for after all, a man
who had no scruples in the matter of stealing dust would scarcely
have scruples in the matter of killing, if pressed to it by
desperation.</p>

<p>Yet friendship had its ties which held even when friendship
had gone. It was a cold-blooded man who suddenly, on the morning
of bad luck, cut these ties clean and stepped away. It meant the
ties were never very real; it meant a man's loyalty was a shifty
thing, subject to any variation in weather. If a man could not
stand fast in a few things, what kind of meaning did life have?
He emptied his pipe, and refilled it. He sat wholly idle as he
pushed his way through a deeper jungle than he had ever met with
in the hills. The sun moved west and the shadows stretched
out.</p>

<p>He realized Lucy now knew those things about George which he
had never been able to tell her. Yet Lucy would never believe
evil of Camrose; she was bound to her own principles as he,
Stuart, was bound to his. So she had come to his store and she
had told him without saying a word directly about it&mdash;what
he must do. It was a clear command. If he freed Camrose, the man
would run, and Lucy would follow.</p>

<p>The foundations of the man were rotten; nothing permanent
could be built upon them. What he was now he would always be; and
he would ruin the girl's life. It was entirely clear.</p>

<p>Yet, there was nothing to do about it. Eventually she would be
disillusioned and destroyed by this man. But if the camp hanged
Camrose, she would still be destroyed&mdash;in another way; she
would be a woman nursing a vain love for forty years and made
infertile and hopeless by it. The whole thing was something
written down in the Book of Judgment and no little act of theirs
could erase any of it.</p>

<p>Clenchfield, watching with his interest, saw Stuart at last
shrug his shoulders and bring a heavy hand down upon his knee. It
was a decisive gesture. Then Stuart removed his pipe, gave it a
displeased look and rose. "The tobacco we're getting up here is
pretty foul, Henry."</p>

<p>"You've sucked at that thing five hours," said
Clenchfield.</p>

<p>Stuart walked to the door and leaned a shoulder against the
casing, looking both ways on the street. The guards remained in
front of Camrose's place; elsewhere was the usual amount of late-
afternoon traffic and activity. "They'll be in some back room
figuring it out."</p>

<p>"Figuring what?" asked Clenchfield.</p>

<p>"The best way to hang Camrose without a fuss. They'll do it
after dark. Henry, clean the grease out of one of those new Colts
and load it for me."</p>

<p>"You ought not to do it. You cannot stand against this
camp."</p>

<p>"I can stand against the camp and so can you or any man, if
he's got to."</p>

<p>Henry Clenchfield rapped his knuckles on the counter with a
rare display of anger. "Why have you got to? A man has never got
to do anything which is against reason."</p>

<p>"Reason never won a war, or built a road, or wrote a
book."</p>

<p>"And what makes men do those things, then?" demanded
Clenchfield.</p>

<p>"Henry," said Stuart, and now was smiling, "do you remember
when you were young and looked at a woman? Do you remember the
ambitions you had?"</p>

<p>"I was a fool until I grew old and got sense."</p>

<p>"It is not reason that makes you hungry. Nor is it reason that
makes you fight, or makes you scheme, or sends you into Corson's
to have a drink and be comfortable. It is not reason that makes
you stick to a friend, or cleave to your God or belong to your
lodge. It is not reason that holds you to your friends, nor does
it make you cry and laugh and sweat. You do a thing&mdash;and
then you find some excuse to call it reasonable; but that is not
why you do it, Henry. You do it because something a damned sight
deeper pushed you to do it. Reason is a pale flicker of
candlelight a man holds up to guide himself when the fire in him
has burned out."</p>

<p>He was smiling still, released from the morbid preoccupations
which had troubled him all during this afternoon. He had restored
his faith in himself by falling back to those extremely simple
things he believed in and which he did not have to explain.</p>

<p>He turned through the store and left the building by the rear
door. The sun was half behind the western hills and suddenly the
fall air had begun to turn cold; along the creek the smoke of
supper fires began to spiral from the tin chimney tops and men
were wearily walking in from their day's laboring. He skirted the
back end of Camrose's office, drawing the thoughtful eye of the
guard stationed there; he went on to his barn and saddled the
best of his horses&mdash;a big deep-chested sorrel meant for a
long run.</p>

<p>He loitered in the barn's doorway to watch the log building
which housed Camrose, and from this point of view he saw the two
guards before it and the single guard behind it. All three were
now watching him across the two hundred feet. Looking beyond
them, he observed one more man stationed at Meadows's store, also
keeping eye upon him. The camp knew him and suspected him, and
this surveillance made him smile. It was another game to be
played, rougher than some others he had been engaged in, and with
himself alone in the matter, opposing men who long had been his
friends. They liked it little and he liked it less; yet this was
the way it had to be played.</p>

<p>He retreated into the stable and sat down on a keg, thinking
of a way which might work; and he turned it about his mind,
refining it and smoothing it until the way seemed practical. A
rider came along the road through the last clear light of the day
at a full gallop, crossed the creek at what seemed a reckless
rate and continued up the street. Stuart made out a voice
shouting, but caught none of the words, since the buildings of
the street were between him and the rider. The voice dropped and
other voices rose.</p>

<p>Returning to the barn's doorway, he saw that all three guards
had gone up the street; and now miners began to run from their
supper fires along the creek, forward through the spaces between
the buildings to the street. Excitement spread its keen incense
all about.</p>

<p>He walked toward the back end of Camrose's office, meanwhile
watching a last straggling group come from the creek; he slowed
his pace until he saw that he had no eyes upon him for a moment.
Then he came against Camrose's back door and tried the knob and
found the lock turned. He thrust his shoulder against the door
and heard the lock grind against the casing. Camrose's voice came
out at him with a kind of panic. "Who's that?"</p>

<p>"Pull at that knob, George," said Stuart. He backed off and
struck the door with the full drive of his legs and his body. The
latch snapped clean and the door wheeled open. Stuart plunged
through it and slammed against Camrose who violently struggled
with him and tried to rush from the room. Stuart said,
"Wait."</p>

<p>"They won't wait longer than dark. I heard them talking."</p>

<p>Stuart handed over his gun. "Take the sorrel in my barn. Get
up in the hills and keep going. Don't come back here."</p>

<p>"Logan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all the talk we'll need," said Stuart. "Your hands are
red as hell. If they catch you again, don't ask me for any more
help."</p>

<p>He backed out of the room, made a sharp survey around him and
beckoned Camrose; then he ran along the back end of the street's
building, slid between his own store and Howison's and came upon
the growing crowd. A man stood by a sweat-black horse, both badly
used. The man talked with his head hanging down, scarcely
coherent. "From Evans, all the way. My wife's dead. My girl's
dead&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was Cobb, and Cobb was on the edge of collapse. Howison
stood by him, a hand on his shoulder. "How many Indians you see?
Big band, little band?"</p>

<p>"They're all out. I tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's this?" asked Stuart.</p>

<p>The man nearest him was Johnny Steele. Johnny turned about.
"He came from the lower ferry, Logan. Everything along the way is
afire."</p>

<p>The messenger said: "If I'd been afoot they'd got me. I was
comin' home and I saw 'em leave my house&mdash;"</p>

<p>Howison asked, "Where'd they go after they left your
place?"</p>

<p>"They were goin' toward Dance's." His face grew strange and
alarmed and white as he felt himself losing consciousness. He
managed to say: "It started on account of Bragg. Bragg killed two
Indians girls this morning. A friendly Rogue told the ferryman."
Then he slid through Howison's arm and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>"Why," said Johnny Steele, "a man ought to be tougher than
that."</p>

<p>"A damned-fool remark, Johnny," said Stuart. "We'll have to
raise a company and start tonight. Sixty men. Where's sixty men
to go?"</p>

<p>Voices rose all around him and Steele said: "We can do better
than sixty." Suddenly one of the miners&mdash;one of the
guards&mdash;gave Stuart a remembering glance and rushed down the
street.</p>

<p>Stuart said: "If it's a real break-out they might attack this
camp. Somebody's got to be around for that. Sixty men is enough
for traveling."</p>

<p>The guard came panting back from Camrose's office, crying his
news before him. "He busted out. The door's open&mdash;back door.
He broke the lock."</p>

<p>Now there were two currents of excitement to sway and disturb
the crowd, and a lesser murmuring began to run around the group.
Steele said: "That door opens in, don't it? If it's broke it had
to be broke by a shove from outside." A righteous man's fury
seized him. He yelled at the guard, "Why didn't you watch?" He
swung on Stuart with his suspicions pulsing across his face. "Do
you think you can buck this camp? Do you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Johnny," said Stuart, "you're making long guesses again." He
looked around the crowd of miners, knowing they shared Johnny
Steele's distrust. He understood them very well, their capacity
for sentimental tears, for kindness, for rough justice; but he
also knew their intemperate power when roused. At this minute he
was in scarcely better shape than Camrose was, but he shrugged
his shoulders and showed them no feeling. "Whoever is going, be
here in twenty minutes. Grub for three days."</p>

<p>Johnny Steele shook his head. "Now we have got another chore
to do, but we'll come back to this matter later. We are going to
treat you rough. We are going to teach you something you need to
learn. No man can stand against this camp."</p>

<p>Stuart turned into his store, put up his grub and moved to the
barn to saddle a horse. When he reached the street again, the
company had gathered, half on foot and half with horses, and
already had elected its officers: Howison was captain, Steele
lieutenant, and a miner by the name of Kelly was orderly
sergeant. Howison explained this to Stuart in a confidential
aside. "I think the boys gave me the job to demonstrate their
irritation toward you." He swung to his command. "If I am to run
this company I'll run it my way. If my way does not suit you,
then it will be time to call an election. But while I'm running
it, I want no argument over my decisions. Forward!"</p>

<p>Captain Howison's company swung into a loose imitation of a
military line and made its serpentine way down the street, half
mounted and half dismounted, with each man variously cumbered
with blankets, kits and guns. The company drew an interested
audience all along the street. Eli Decker had, in patriotic
spirit, brought out an open-ended keg of whisky and several
dippers, and for a while the marching column was neither at march
nor in column. Presently, with the keg empty, the way was resumed
and a last volley of remarks and casual cheers came from the
bystanders.</p>

<p>Stuart brought up the rear of the group. As he passed along
the foot of the street he observed Overmire and Lucy standing in
the crowd. Overmire waved a hand at him and called, "Good luck."
Lucy held his glance and spoke to him in the old and silent way
he knew so well; and he spoke back to her in the same manner, and
so left Jacksonville.</p>

<p>Five miles northeast of town, in the night's full dark,
Howison took note of the growing desire for rest and halted his
command. "Cook up a quick supper. I propose to march this outfit
straight through to Dance's tonight."</p>

<p>"We'll not make it till daylight," said Kelly, the
sergeant.</p>

<p>"If we camp until morning, we'd not make it until tomorrow
night."</p>

<p>"Yet," said Kelly, "if we march all through the night and
reach Dance's by daylight and then found a fresh trail to follow,
we'd be too tired to follow it."</p>

<p>Howison stared at Kelly. "You talk like a dog chasin' its
tail."</p>

<p>"Well, a dog's got sense enough to curl up and sleep when he's
tired."</p>

<p>The discussion grew. Kelly made a speech in favor of rest and
an early start by morning. A mounted miner by the name of Parrott
suggested resting until midnight. George McFall suggested
marching through the night, but with a qualification: let the
horse owners go ahead a mile, tie their horses and walk on. The
foot miners would come up to the tied horses, ride a mile beyond
the first group and tie, continuing afoot. Ed Jensen objected,
stating that this would overwork the horses. From that point the
discussion went into the subject of the varying endurance of
horses. "For example," Ned Gotch said, "I knew a horse on the
Russian River who weighed about seven-fifty and was fourteen
years old. Yet in the winter of '50 that horse carried two men
fifteen miles over a mountain, on a trail three feet deep in
snow."</p>

<p>"Not a California horse," said somebody else. "Must have been
pure mustang."</p>

<p>Stuart tightened the cinch on his horse and stepped to the
saddle. Howison called through the dark to him. "Where you going,
Logan?"</p>

<p>"To Dance's. I didn't come out here to argue over horses."</p>

<p>"Well," said Johnny Steele, "we've got to thresh this thing
out."</p>

<p>"You elected a captain to give the orders. If you stop every
house to argue with him, when do you expect to catch up with any
Indians? If you mean to swap stories, go back to Corson's. If you
came out to fight, quit bellyaching. You talked big back on the
street, now you're getting cold feet. You won't catch any Indians
at this rate, and maybe you don't want to. Maybe all you want to
do is march around in easy spots for two days, and then go back
to camp and make out you've been big men." Then he said with
vigorous scorn: "Hell, the sight of an Indian would stampede you
back to California."</p>

<p>Johnny Steele's outraged voice came to him. "Well, what do you
want to do?"</p>

<p>"Those with horses should push on fast to Dance's and catch
the Indian trail. The rest of you ought to swing over to the
river and patrol from the Ferry to Dance's in case the Rogues
double back. I'm going to Dance's. Who's going ahead with
me?"</p>

<p>"I'm going," said Howison. "You take the boys afoot,
Steele."</p>

<p>"No," said Steele. "Somebody lend me a horse."</p>

<p>The horsemen were forming in the shadows. Somewhere in this
darkness a rider, urged by Steele's persuasive language,
surrendered his mount and joined the foot group. Howison said:
"Kelly, you're in command of the boys afoot. You cover the
river."</p>

<p>"Which side of the river?" asked Kelly. "For how long? How far
do I go and when do I turn around?"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Kelly," said a voice. "We'll decide that as we
travel."</p>

<p>"Dammit," said Kelly, "if I'm to command, I can make up my own
mind."</p>

<p>Stuart and Howison led away with twenty or more riders behind.
The night sky glittered out its crusted light and a small wind
carried a brisk fall coldness. Pacing along the trail as it clung
to the foothills, they picked up the silver shining of the river
below them, and presently came upon it and followed its turns and
its straight stretches, at a walk, at a gallop, at a walk. A
cabin light glinted ahead of them; and then the light died as the
rumor of their horses reached forward. Then went by, with Howison
shouting: "There'll be a bunch patrolling here tomorrow, Oldham."
The smell of the warming horses rose rank and the sound of gear
slapped and sang. They rested briefly and pushed forward; at the
lower ferry they sang across the water until the ferryman came
out of his cabin and brought the ferry over. "What's the last
news?" asked Stuart.</p>

<p>"I got four families forted up here. We can make out. The
Indians went toward Dance's. Perry Volk was killed, mile down the
river."</p>

<p>The river moved northwest, the trail moved north. Stuart
pushed on, through little pocketed clearings and up the face of
low hills, and along flat stretches studded loosely with trees.
In the dense mass of the hills ahead of them a red glow spread
against the sky. This was seven or eight miles away, beyond
Dance's. "They've fired the woods," said Howison. "Or it could be
Jay Fitch's cabin."</p>

<p>They stumbled upon the litter of Stuart's destroyed pack
train; mules lay all along the trail, capsized with their packs,
and the smell of all this had begun to grow strong. Stuart pulled
in. He got to the ground and walked along the wreckage. He was
not sure of its identity until he came across one mule whose
markings he knew. "Mine," he said.</p>

<p>Howison said: "That's bad. How big an outfit was it?"</p>

<p>"Thirty mules."</p>

<p>"Wonder if Blazier and Murrow got out of it."</p>

<p>Scattered bolts of cloth made ghostly patterns in the night
and all the horses of the troop were shying away from the sight
and smell of the disaster. They made a detour of the trail until
the dead mules were well behind. The light from Dance's house
sparkled in the distance and now Howison lifted his voice in a
long and undulating halloo to warn the people yonder. Dance's
door was open when the detachment swung into the yard&mdash;and
Vane Blazier's voice called: "Who's that?"</p>

<p>"How is it here?" asked Stuart.</p>

<p>"Well now, I'm glad to see you," said Blazier. "We got jumped
and Murrow was killed. Old Dance and young Bushrod Dance are
dead. Mrs. Dance is all right. Caroline's gone. She was up in the
brush hunting for a cow when the Rogues hit. I found her trail
but I couldn't follow it. There was some Indians still roaming
around and I had to back off. By God, I'm glad you're here."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER 15. &mdash;
CAROLINE</h2>

<p class="first">STUART stepped into the house and found Mrs.
Dance at the stove. She had heard them and now she proposed
making some kind of meal. She looked around at Stuart, her dark
face pressed into tightest composure. "Caroline's all right," she
said. "We brought our youngsters up to shift for themselves. I'll
have coffee in a minute."</p>

<p>Howison and part of the group crowded in; and others were
moving around the cabin, easy-calling into the night. Stuart
said: "In the morning we'd better take you down to the Ferry. It
is a safer place."</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Dance, "I would not feel easy underfoot in
another woman's house. Anyhow, the other boys will be back.
They'll take care of it."</p>

<p>Blazier said, "We've got to get on Caroline's trail. It goes
up there&mdash;" and he pointed to the hills eastward. He waited
for Stuart to speak. When Stuart showed no immediate sign of
moving, young Blazier's tight-strung emotions began to break. He
gave Stuart a hot and resentful glance. "Well, ain't we
going?"</p>

<p>"What was Caroline wearing?" asked Stuart of Mrs. Dance.</p>

<p>"A gingham dress," said Mrs. Dance. "A blue-and-white-checked
dress."</p>

<p>"What kind of a gun was she carrying?"</p>

<p>"Her pa's big pistol."</p>

<p>"Well," said Stuart. "That's six shots. You hear her do any
firing?"</p>

<p>"I can't recollect," said Mrs. Dance. "There was firin' all
around us while the red beasters were here. My man was killed
soon. Son Bushrod was hit almost the last shot. Then they went
away." She faced the stove, away from them. "It was Dance I was
thinkin' about not anybody else."</p>

<p>Young Blazier gave Mrs. Dance a glance of irritation, offended
by what she said; it sounded callous to him. Stuart said: "Which
way do you think that no-horn cow went?"</p>

<p>"It was a breachy animal," said Mrs. Dance. "Always knockin'
down the fence. There's some kind of grass up Goose Canyon it
yearned for."</p>

<p>"How long had she been gone," asked Stuart, "when the Rogues
hit you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Dance put a palm across her eyes to think. "We had the
potatoes on the stove, boilin' for supper. That's five-thirty.
Then she went. I was mixin' up some greens with the cottage
cheese. Then I turned to get the potatoes off the stove. That was
mighty near six. I heard Dance shout and then he was runnin' in
from the meadow. I never did get the potatoes off the stove. The
water boiled out and the potatoes scorched. Well, she was gone a
half hour when the beasters came."</p>

<p>One of the party, outside the house, said: "There's something
coming up the trail." Afterwards his challenge sharply rode the
night: "Who's that? Sing out."</p>

<p>A voice made guttural with fatigue answered. "I'm coming
in."</p>

<p>Stuart, hearing the voice, stepped from the cabin. The miners
were drifting up from the shadows; they made a group in the front
yard of the house, listening to the shuffle of the approaching
stranger's boots. He called again: "There's Rogues around here
yet. I heard some on the trail a little while ago."</p>

<p>Stuart drew his gun. He said: "Stand fast. Who are you?"</p>

<p>Howison murmured: "Hell, Logan, it's a white man. Let him come
in."</p>

<p>The shuffling of the stranger's boots stopped. He said in a
different voice: "That you, Logan? I've been chased all day. I'm
dead beat."</p>

<p>"Why," said Howison, "it's Bragg."</p>

<p>Stuart lifted his gun and fired in Bragg's general direction.
The echo went out through the night in great bounding, widening
waves and broke against the hills, shattering into lesser echoes.
Bragg stood fast, wherever he was. He began to argue stubbornly.
"You got to forget that, Stuart. Don't turn against a man with
your own color of skin now. Boys, don't let him do it. Take his
gun away from him."</p>

<p>"If you come inside my range, Bragg, I'll kill you," said
Stuart.</p>

<p>"Listen, boys," said Bragg, "I can't run much longer. There's
Rogues within sound of my voice. You know what they'll do to me,
don't you? You want to see me hangin' to a tree, skinned and
dressed? That's what they'll do."</p>

<p>Stuart stood silent and unchanged. Howison stared through the
dark at him, his own feelings somewhat swayed by the grisly
picture Bragg painted. The rest of the group said nothing, and
Bragg spoke again with a greater note of begging. "You boys take
me in. I'll go back to Jacksonville and stand a miners' court.
That's fair, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Stuart. "You've got nothing coming to you at
all."</p>

<p>Bragg growled, "By God, I'm coming in," and his boots began to
scuff the road. He was hoping to break their nerve, Stuart
thought; he was hoping to come among them, after which they would
have no stomach to shoot him. Stuart brought up his pistol when
he first saw the man's shape take form against the night; he
fired twice and witnessed Bragg wheel and plunge out of the trail
into the brush. Bragg's cursing was a winded and terrible thing
in the night. His words went on and on, by turn violent and
wheedling. The crowd stood fast, listening.</p>

<p>Stuart said: "Blazier and I are going up Goose Canyon. I don't
think we'll see anything in the dark, but we've got to look." He
started off with Blazier. He stopped suddenly and called back.
"If you let Bragg come up here, I'll shoot him when I get
back."</p>

<p>One of the crowd answered him. "He won't come. I'll take care
of that."</p>

<p>Stuart turned the corner of the house and walked into the
meadow, Blazier beside him. The yellow stubble gave out a faint
glow and their feet made a racket on it. They waded a summer-thin
creek and were at once between the jaws of the canyon, in a
blackness so deep that the strip of sky above the canyon seemed
bright by contrast&mdash;its stars all glittering. Stuart stopped
and sank down, listening into the night. The creek made its
varied and chattering racket along the stones and there was a
breathing of wind along the trees; he rose and went on. He had
gone only a short distance&mdash;twenty feet or so&mdash;when his
foot struck an obstacle, half soft and half hard, on the trail.
He put his hand to it and discovered the no-horn cow, dead.</p>

<p>Blazier murmured: "She must have been bringing the cow back,"
and hurried forward.</p>

<p>Stuart suppressed the notion to call him back and remained by
the cow. If Caroline had gotten clear, which way had she gone?
Not immediately to the house, since it had been under attack.
Perhaps she had circled into the timber, had settled down to wait
her chance to return. Well, then, why hadn't she returned, after
the Indians had left the cabin?</p>

<p>Maybe she had retreated deeper into the hills.</p>

<p>If so, the likely thing to guess was that she had drifted
either north or east&mdash;both directions furnishing the densest
kind of shelter. There was scarcely any choice between the two
routes except that by going north she kept near the Oregon-
California trail and might come upon passing miners.</p>

<p>All this was based on the guess that she had survived. He laid
a hand on the cow and felt the warmth still in that carcass; he
thought of Caroline's firm and browned face, the curve of her
shoulders and the smile that came rarely to her. Then, from a
higher point on the trail, young Blazier loudly called her name
into the night. "Caroline!"</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken it when a gun's shot came dry and
bitter through the dark&mdash;to be followed by a second; and
afterwards Stuart heard Blazier's boots rush down the trail.
Stuart rose and braced himself. He put out his hands and took the
first shock of Blazier's on-springing body. He said: "Hold up,"
and he pulled Blazier back from the trail. He gave Blazier a
shove to the ground and he himself dropped.</p>

<p>A voice up the trail said, "Ah-uh," and, in a moment, Stuart
made out the quick light padding of moccasined feet. Stuart
crouched lower in order to catch the silhouette of the Rogue
against the sky; he saw it dimly, and then saw a second&mdash;the
two shapes not far apart.</p>

<p>The two Rogues were aware of the dead cow and slowed down as
they came forward. This brought both of them together and at that
moment Stuart rose forward and crashed the barrel of his gun down
across the head of the foremost figure. The second Indian,
warned, leaped back and fired&mdash;and missed. Blazier's bullet,
aimed on the Rogue's gun flash, dropped the second Indian. The
echoes rolled away, one hard upon the other.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Stuart, and led the way down the canyon's
trail. They were out in the meadow before he spoke again.
"Nothing to do until daylight."</p>

<p>Howison had set up a guard. The rest of the crowd had settled
in the yard for rest. Standing a moment near the door, Stuart
watched Blazier drop near the house, and he heard the young man
breathing in a short and uneven way. Blazier was crying. Stuart
thought: "That's the way he feels about her. I wonder if she
knows it." There was no further sound from Bragg, but he guessed
that the big man was as close as possible to the protection of
this house. He went inside, finding Howison with a cup of coffee.
He sat down and lay back on the chair. "The cow's dead. Two bucks
jumped us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dance said: "Caroline can take care of herself."</p>

<p>Howison gently shook his head and left the room. Stuart
thought: "North is as good a bet as any," and, settling deeper in
the chair, fell asleep.</p>

<p><br> <br> Mrs. Dance, rattling the coffeepot on the stove,
woke him; and he found he had during his sleep crawled from the
chair and made his bed under the table. There was still no light
upon the meadow when he went to the rear of the house and washed
his face in the tin bowl. Miners were rousing from their brief
and uncomfortable sleep, morosely silent for want of rest. A
fire's pale-yellow edge cut the blackness, around which men
squatted to cook up their bacon. Mrs. Dance was supplying the
coffee. Stuart drank two cups black and said: "Blazier and I will
scout the canyon again," and started off with the young man.</p>

<p>Light began to break in the eastern sky and swell in pale
bands. The carcass of the dead cow was visible as they passed it,
and the creek showed its streaky white edges where it foamed
among the boulders. A little beyond the cow, Stuart moved into
the brush and waited full light. When it came, he said to
Blazier: "You go down the canyon. She should have left her prints
near the creek. I'll go the other way."</p>

<p>Fifty feet from the cow he came upon the flat tracks of an
Indian pressed deep into the creek's mud. He followed these back
into the brush and watched them grow fainter on the less
resilient earth; he returned to the creek again and continued
upward. Other tracks were visible, but all of them were Rogue.
They would be tracking her, and thus be going in the same
direction she went. He turned back, finding Blazier slightly
below the dead cow. Blazier pointed to the earth and made a
circle with his forefinger around a small shoe print. He was
greatly stirred. "She was here. She was right here."</p>

<p>Stuart followed these prints up the hill's slope and into the
brush. She had been running that to be observed from the deep and
scuffed shape of her tracks. She had run a long distance without
stopping, circling the brush where possible, otherwise breaking
through it. Two hundred feet from the creek, she had stopped to
rest or to hide. Her knees had made two round depressions on the
forest mold.</p>

<p>He called to Blazier. "Go tell Howison to leave three men with
Mrs. Dance, and to come along with the rest. On foot. We can't
use horses."</p>

<p>Blazier rushed down the canyon, sounding ahead with his shout
of discovery. Stuart crouched in the thicket, realizing he would
have to keep an eye on Blazier during the day's march; the lad
was in a frame of mind which would make him careless. He looked
down at the print of Caroline's knees and he thought of the fear
and the wildness which must have been in her, but when he
pictured her face he saw no terror on it; she had a self-reliance
great as any man's. He reached down and laid his hand on the
print of her knee and suddenly he realized she was more mature
than he knew. He remembered the shadow on her face when he had
proposed; not even her pleasure had entirely dissolved it. She
had known how much he was offering, and she had known about Lucy.
Nevertheless she was a realist, taking what she could get, and
showing him no tears for what he held back. It was less than she
wanted, he realized; it was less than any woman wanted. But she
had made up her mind to be content with it and to hide her
regret.</p>

<p>Howison came up the canyon with the rest of the miners and the
group made a loose circle in the thicket, around Stuart.
"Everybody spread out," he said. "We'll drag the country best we
can."</p>

<p>"Look behind," said Howison.</p>

<p>Stuart turned and stared down the canyon, to discover the
unmistakable shape of Bragg coming out of the meadow into the
canyon, soon ducking from sight. "He's afraid to be alone," said
Stuart. "It will be a hard way to die, if the Rogues catch him."
He made a signal to the group, and rose and walked into the
timber, with the girl's tracks directly before him.</p>

<p>The sun's clear light rushed across the high sky; but once the
party entered this dense stand of timber, twilight came again,
broken on rare occasion by a thin shaft of sunlight slanting down
through a gap in the matted ceiling of branches. These trees were
old, they were huge and they stood upon the earth with their
great feet building massive hummocks around them. A thousand
years of destruction and decay lay upon the earth, at places
making direct progress forward impossible; and fern and
undergrowth luxuriantly grew in the perpetual shade. The slope
rose steadily and reached a rough crest. Beyond the crest, the
land pitched down at a forty-five degree angle into a canyon
smothered with wild berry vines, devil's stalk and water-loving
shrubs.</p>

<p>The print of Caroline's shoes were clear to this point; and
here her trail turned with the ridge and went westward along it.
Stuart thought: "She got the idea of drifting toward the Oregon-
California road." He waited for the skirmish line of miners to
fight up through the tangled slope. Howison appeared, drawing
wind from the bottom of his lungs; some branch, whipping back,
had left a welt across his forehead.</p>

<p>Stuart followed Caroline west. Fifty yards on he saw a pair of
moccasin prints swing from the brush and march with Caroline's
tracks; shortly afterward these moccasin prints were joined by
others, until there was a scuffed streak along the ground, in
which Caroline's marks were wholly lost. Half a dozen bucks had
found her route and had followed it.</p>

<p>Then the trail dropped into the canyon. Stuart moved down the
slope in stiff-legged jumps and came to a narrow sluggish creek
half buried in mud; all this mud had been churned by the prior
travel of the Indians. A few yards away, Howison had gotten
himself involved in a patch of nettles and was softly swearing.
The rest of the miners arrived with considerable racket, dropping
by the creek for water. Blazier, always in advance, called back.
"She tore her dress."</p>

<p>Stuart moved up to him and saw the little strip of blue-and-
white gingham clinging to the stiff crotch of a bush; he squatted
and took off his hat to squeeze the sweat from its band. He had a
picture of Caroline again, still stone-grave in her expression,
her dress ragged and her eyes growing dark. He shook his head and
continued upward. Howison called from behind. "Better rest. We're
beginning to straggle."</p>

<p>He went on until he reached another crest. The tracks now
suddenly fanned out in several directions as the Rogues had
divided in their search. He said to Blazier, "Go that way. See if
you can pick up her tracks."</p>

<p>Before him&mdash;below him&mdash;was a greater canyon and a
wider one. A creek of considerable size ran along its bottom, and
the sides of the canyon, worn by this creek's centuries of
running, were almost vertical. The miners now slowly toiled
forward to join him, to look at him, to drop on their haunches.
Howison heaved himself up the last stages of the slope and opened
his mouth for air. Hot as the labor was, he had turned pale.</p>

<p>Blazier came back. "I saw nothing that way," he said, and
turned in the other direction to make his search.</p>

<p>Stuart drew out his pipe and filled and lighted it. The first
pull of smoke freshened him, and he began to look more closely at
the prints around him; he bent over one of them. So far he had
assumed that this trail had been made the night before, but he
now noted that the edges of the prints still were sharp and
ragged. The little particles of earth had not dried and crumbled
away as they would have done after eight or ten hours of time,
and the dried leaves and the short fern blades which had been
pressed down by the traveling weight of the Indian still were
plastered flat to the bottom of the prints.</p>

<p>"These were made this morning," he said. "She must have hidden
close by the cabin all night&mdash;the Indians also. She must
have figured they were watching for her and waiting for daylight.
So she moved on. They followed as soon as they could read the
ground. She's not far off."</p>

<p>Howison shook his head. "I know how you feel, but don't be
optimistic."</p>

<p>Blazier returned and dropped to the ground. "I wish I could
read sign," he said, and was angry at his own uselessness. "I
can't make out a thing."</p>

<p>Below them, somewhere in the canyon from which they had just
emerged, brush began to rattle. Stuart rose up and counted the
men around him. "We're all here, aren't we?" he said. He went to
the edge of the canyon, looking into it. He heard the brush snap
again, but he could see nothing through the massed timber; then
the brush ceased to rattle. "Bragg," he said.</p>

<p>"He's afraid," said Howison.</p>

<p>"That will be something new for him. He was never afraid of
anything before."</p>

<p>"He never had anything he couldn't take care of before," said
Howison. "But he can't take care of this. They're going to get
him, and he knows it."</p>

<p>It was time to move; it was time to make a guess. The steep
canyon before him would prevent Caroline from continuing directly
northward; by necessity, she had turned either eastward deeper
into the hills, or she had swung downgrade to the west, toward
the Oregon-California trail. A sound came up from the west, the
sound of an animal whipping through the brush, and in another
moment he saw an elk, old and heavily antlered, break through the
screen. The wind was coming with the elk, out of the west, so
that he had no warning until his eyes saw shapes that were not
familiar to his world. Warning stopped him, but never quite
stopped him. He fell to a trotting walk; he turned his head
slightly aside, sucked at the air with his nostrils and then he
wheeled into a run and crashed down the canyon.</p>

<p>Stuart said, "That's our answer. Something down that way
spooked him."</p>

<p>He moved westward with the miners straggling beside him and
behind him, wearily circling deadfalls and huge tree columns,
wearily fighting the brush. The moccasin prints made zigzag
designs on the ground, thickening as the Rogues came together,
thinning as they wheeled away on different scents. The forest
brightened and the trees gave way to an opening in this
wilderness; the scars of a fire showed on nearby treetrunks and
farther on the thinning timber presented him vistas of a
meadow.</p>

<p>The group came up to the edge of the timber and paused before
this open area which was a rough square of perhaps a hundred
feet; sunlight brilliantly flooded this open area and fern grew
waist high around charred stumps and silvered snags. Across this
way the Rogues had gone, their course marked by the broken-down
fern.</p>

<p>Howison said: "I don't relish exposing myself out there."</p>

<p>It became a clearer conviction to Stuart that this trail had
been made not more than two hours before. Caroline was somewhere
in the yonder trees, and the Rogues were also somewhere there;
the sense of time's pressure got into him, the need of haste
overbore his caution. He said, "Come on fast," and trotted from
the trees.</p>

<p>The smell of the ferns rose in wild fragrance as he broke them
under his feet. He hurdled dead logs matted with berry vines;
quail, flushed from cover, drummed away in low flight before him.
Howison and Blazier were close at his either side and he noted
that Howison's face was drawn from exertion and his mouth sprung
wide. The rest of the miners were scattered loosely in line
across the meadow, their shapes cut off at the hips by the fern.
Turning his head to scan the rear, he saw Bragg standing at the
meadow's edge.</p>

<p>"Do I see something ahead&mdash;right straight ahead by the
trees?" asked Howison.</p>

<p>They were half across, and faltering from the run. Stuart
shouted: "Keep up&mdash;keep up," and regretted the waste of this
wind. He looked at young Blazier and observed that the boy
trotted with no exertion showing on his face. Seeing it, Stuart
had the bitterest regret that he was no longer twenty, with the
boundless stamina of twenty. He raked the line of trees ahead
with his glance and, fifty feet from that shelter, he flung up
his revolver at what he thought was a copper body skulking there.
He checked himself, but his gesture ticked off Howison, who
lifted his gun and fired point blank. Stampeded by this, the
miners gathered speed and rushed forward one by one and got into
the timber; there they stopped, calling to each other in short
and exhausted tones.</p>

<p>A shout came across the meadow, full and desperate. Staring
back over the field of fern, Stuart watched Bragg come forward in
great haste; he cried out again, his voice going to top pitch and
breaking. Stuart raised his gun and at once fired, missing. Bragg
stumbled to a halt. He put both hands over his head and stood as
still as his winded body would permit. He swung an arm to the
rear, pointing at the woods out of which he had come, and through
which Stuart and his group had just passed. He shouted: "They're
in there!" Then other shots began to roll flatly in the morning,
out from the miners toward Bragg. The latter ducked, turned and
started back. Twenty feet from the trees he dropped out of sight
in the ferns, and his own gun began to speak.</p>

<p>Howison shouted: "Look over there," and Stuart saw bodies
weaving along the edge of the far trees. A Rogue came into the
meadow, low-scurrying, and Bragg's gun sent up two swift
explosions. The Rogue dropped, apparently struck, but two more
Indians now rushed from the trees at Bragg; he fired again as
they came at him. He rose up into view and made a final shot as
the two bore down upon him.</p>

<p>His gun was then apparently empty, and he swept it before him
as he would have swung a scythe. One Indian wheeled around him
while the other came straight on. Bragg dropped his gun and
jumped at the nearest Indian and locked him in his brutal
arms&mdash;and the quick shout of that Rogue was a piercing
signal across the meadow as Bragg crushed him. The other Indian
rushed in behind Bragg and beat him over the head until he went
down into the ferns; afterwards Stuart saw the two Indians bend
and rise and bend as they killed Bragg.</p>

<p>"Good God," said Howison, and turned his head away.</p>

<p>The two Indians rose, each bearing some bloody trophy in his
hands. Stuart took careful aim and fired, long as the range was
for the revolver. He struck his target, he saw his Indian flinch
and run back to shelter at an off-balance stride. Now the miners
opened on the other fleeing Rogue, but did not bring him down. A
long, startled yell came from the far end of the miner's
line.</p>

<p>"Hey&mdash;over here!"</p>

<p>Firing began and grew lively fifty feet down the timber.
Stuart murmured, "They must have crawled around," and rushed
toward the source of the shots. He circled a tree and beat his
way to a clump of brush; as he came out of the brush clump he
faced a Rogue who, flatly inching his way forward along the
earth, now sprang up with his gun. He was so close at hand that
Stuart struck him in his forward plunging and smelled the
savage's rank odor before he clubbed him down with his gun.
Howison cried out: "Watch it!" and fired, his bullet passing
quite near Stuart; wheeling half around, Stuart saw the brush
tremble as Rogues rose from cover and came in. He had Howison and
Blazier with him; and somewhere near at hand other miners were
smashing their way forward. Bullets whipped by; a chunk of bark
splintered from a fir and struck Stuart's hat.</p>

<p>He spoke sharply at Blazier. "Get behind a tree." He turned
and shoved Blazier back, and fired at a Rogue half hidden behind
a fir, fifteen feet distant. The Indian swayed as though pushed
by a board; he made a grab at the rough bark of the tree and
pulled himself back. A round tarnished spot showed on his chest;
it bubbled and grew larger, and blood made a brighter streak down
his chest. His eyes were round and bottomless and his lips drew
up from his teeth&mdash;and as Stuart watched, dullness and
vacancy and unknowingness came to the Indian. When he fell he was
dead.</p>

<p>The Rogues, rushing in for the attack, had met resistance.
They had seen a swift kill in prospect, or would never have
charged in this manner, so uncharacteristic of their way of
fighting. Now they drew away, with the miners plunging after
them, the fight becoming a hand-to-hand affair, scattered all
through the timber. Stuart lost contact with both Howison and
Blazier as he ran forward. A bullet whipped past him, its source
seeming to be beyond a dead log. He jumped aside, pulled himself
over the log and saw a Rogue disappearing into a tangle of wind-
fallen timber. He followed, pressing aside old branches and
working his way through a kind of tunnel made by two trees lying
side by side; he caught sight of the Rogue ahead of him, stooped
and wheeling swiftly from sight.</p>

<p>When he came to the end of the tunnel he found himself facing
the pit where once the roots of a tree had been. The Indian stood
at the bottom of it, swiftly ramming new charges into his
revolver.</p>

<p>When he saw Stuart he dropped his useless gun, made a quick
leap, caught Stuart by the feet and dragged him off balance into
the pit. He fell over Stuart, he beat at him with his fists, he
slid a forearm around Stuart's throat and he rolled and locked
his hands together and began to squeeze on Stuart's windpipe.</p>

<p>Stuart rolled with him. He had his hands free and he reached
for the man's locked hands, to break the pressure. He could not
reach far enough back, nor could he exert enough force to release
himself. He turned his head, but the pressure increased and he
drew one last thin stream of air into his lungs&mdash;and felt
his heart pounding heavier against his chest. He rolled again and
rose to his haunches; he reached out and caught one of the
Indian's legs. He got a knee against the leg and pulled the lower
part of the Indian's leg against this with a tremendous heave.
The Indian turned to relieve the strain and, in turning, let his
arms fall away. Stuart dragged in the sweet wind and made his
grab at the Rogue now suddenly rolling clear. He pinned the man
down; he laid his weight across the other's body and his forearm
across the man's throat. He shoved with the weight of his
shoulders until he heard the Rogue's windpipe grate. The Rogue
twisted with him and unseated him, but he used his fist, stunning
the Rogue with a smash against the forehead. Then he reared back
and caught the revolver he had dropped. The Rogue was halfway to
his feet when Stuart swung in and beat him over the head.</p>

<p>He stood still, with his vision blurred; his hand shook when
he dragged it across his face. He could not breathe deeply
enough, or fast enough. He put both arms over the edge of the pit
and held himself there, at the moment doubting if he could climb
from it. He heard voices shouting in the distance, and other
voices answering as the firing settled to occasional reports;
somewhere a voice called his name.</p>

<p>He opened the revolver and charged it; he pinched on the caps
and gripped the gun with one hand and made a jump upward, from
the pit. He fell back, and afterwards he kicked toeholds in the
spongy ground and used these to pull himself into the alley made
by two trees. He returned along the alley, forced a way through
the branches, and discovered Howison coming forward.</p>

<p>Howison looked closely at him. "You get hit?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I think we broke 'em up. It's clear around here."</p>

<p>Another shot erupted deeper in the trees as Stuart and Howison
moved toward the edge of the meadow. When they got to it they saw
miners walking across to where Bragg had fallen. Howison stopped
short and said, "I don't want to see him."</p>

<p>"Cry for the good ones dead," said Stuart. "Not for him. Would
you want him alive, waiting around to kill somebody else?"</p>

<p>"I know," said Howison. "But there is a Christian mercy we
have got to remember."</p>

<p>"There is mercy," said Stuart. "And then there is something
which is not mercy, but only easy tears. The people who are dead
because of this man would probably have been alive today if Bragg
had been killed a month ago. I wish I had done it then." He felt
stronger, but he was still shaken from the fight and he still had
the grisly feeling of the Indian's arms locked around his neck.
He watched the miners coming up and he said: "We won't pick up
Caroline's tracks in this jungle. She was headed for the Oregon-
California road. That's less than a half mile west. We'll go that
way and see if we can find anything."</p>

<p>The miners spread out with a slow weariness and once again
moved through this half-impassible forest. They walked carefully
and they kept a sharp watch ahead of them, and around them, and
behind them. It was not in the nature of Indians to stand fast
once they had suffered a sharp defeat, yet the chance always
existed that some one brave, seeking distinction, might make a
lone fight. So they went on with a steady attention, jaded and
winded and brush-scratched. A small break in the trees gave them
a view of the trail, and somewhere short of noon they came upon
it, and walked along it until they reached a creek. They dropped
here and drank in greedy thirst, and wetted their faces in
relief. Stuart filled his chest and sent a long halloo ringing
back through all the corridors of the hills. Blazier fired one
shot into the air. They stood around, listening and waiting. They
had their fear but avoided speaking of it; they stared about them
at the deep, dense forest and wearily thought of the drudgery of
another search back through it.</p>

<p>Stuart said: "Two of you boys go down the road. Look for her
tracks. She may have reached here and started home. Blazier and I
will go in the other direction."</p>

<p>"Well," said Howison, "all right," and he sat down on the road
and stretched himself out. Fatigue had gotten deeper into him
than in the others; it had done something permanent to him,
Stuart thought as he turned north along the trail with
Blazier.</p>

<p>"Vane," he said with some sharpness, "keep your head up."</p>

<p>The trail ran a straight course for half a hundred yards, rose
up a small grade, and curled around a long bend; the sun stood
straight overhead, its light here and there turning the trail's
dark dust to a sleazy gold. The surface of the trail was rough
with the traffic of pack trains, so that Stuart was unable to
tell whether or not Caroline had passed this way. After half a
mile, he turned back.</p>

<p>"She wouldn't have gotten over this way."</p>

<p>Young Blazier followed him back along the slow bend, with
nothing to say. The fight had left him in a dejected frame of
mind; it had filled him with foreboding. "Vane," said Stuart,
"keep your head up."</p>

<p>They were not quite around the bend, not quite in view of the
main party ahead of them, when Stuart's glance, consistently
roving back and forth along the edges of the trail, caught a
motion in the deep-shadows of the forest, some yards away on the
left side. He was not certain of it and stopped, bringing up his
gun and narrowing his eyes for a cleaner view. He lost sight of
that bit of motion; then he caught it again, and in another
moment he saw Caroline Dance step from the trees into the
trail.</p>

<p>He broke into a run and he gave a shout, and for the first
time he realized how black and heavy his apprehensions had been;
they dropped from him, leaving him light of mind. "Why,
Caroline," he said.</p>

<p>Blazier knocked him aside and rushed forward, calling her name
over and over. Blazier came up to her and put an arm on her
shoulder and suddenly the young man was crying. "My God,
Caroline," he said. "My God..."</p>

<p>She was weary and she swayed when Blazier touched her. Her
dress was torn, her arms scratched, and her face was welted with
the slash of vines she had gone through. Her hair fell around her
face, in the presence of the two men, she made a little gesture
with her hand to straighten it. She had her father's revolver
gripped in her fingers. Yet, tired and bruised as she was, the
composure remained on her face. She had been through an ordeal,
but that ordeal had not unsteadied her mind. She was now what she
had been before, a reliant and practical girl who, for all the
fear she may have felt and all the sudden thrusts of terror which
may have gone through her, had never doubted herself.</p>

<p>Stuart stopped before her and put his arms around her. He held
her closely and for a moment she dropped her head against his
shoulder. She said: "I heard firing. I was hidden well. I guess
you must have met the Rogues. I'm tired and I want to go
home."</p>

<p>"All right," said Stuart. "We'll go home."</p>

<p>She stepped back from him, and looked at him with the closest
of expressions; she read him carefully and thoroughly, and then
she turned her glance to young Blazier. He had gotten control of
himself, furtively brushing the tears from his eyes; he looked at
her with the most heartfelt relief, and his own feelings were as
clear as day to her. Her expression softened as she watched him,
and what she saw broke the fatigued dullness of her cheeks. She
turned to Stuart again and he felt that she made a comparison and
came to a judgment. Whatever it was, she afterwards thought of
something else. "How are my people?"</p>

<p>Stuart said: "Your mother's all right."</p>

<p>"Logan&mdash;what's wrong with my father?"</p>

<p>"He's dead, Caroline. And so is your brother Bushrod."</p>

<p>The night and day had not broken her, but now her face
changed. She said: "I want to go home," and turned from them,
walking on toward the main party. She stumbled as she walked, and
she put a hand to her face, and was half blinded with her
tears.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER 16. &mdash; VARIOUS
FAREWELLS</h2>

<p class="first">AS soon as they returned to Dance's the miners
dismounted, cooked up a noon meal, and lay back to smoke and to
rest. Presently half of them were asleep in the warm day. The
door closed on the Dances' cabin as soon as Caroline entered it,
and for the first time Stuart heard the sound of Mrs. Dance
crying. The presence of Caroline had unlocked the older woman's
tragedy. Young Blazier sat hard by the door, grown gloomy once
more.</p>

<p>Stuart got a pair of shovels and, with half a dozen miners,
went down the trail to the slaughtered pack train, and buried
Murrow in the little thicket. Howison was with him and on the way
back to the Dances' he spoke of Stuart's bad luck. "Thirty loaded
mules is a hard loss, Logan."</p>

<p>"Maybe more," said Stuart. "I'm wondering about the string
from Crescent City."</p>

<p>When they reached the cabin, the door was open, and Mrs. Dance
was waiting in the yard.</p>

<p>"Logan," she said, "I guess you better think about Dance and
Bushrod." She shaded her eyes and looked out upon the meadow to
where two old oaks shaded the earth. "Make it there."</p>

<p>Half of Kelly's foot outfit came up the trail while the graves
were being dug and Kelly said: "The rest of the boys went back
home. There's nothing along the river. Those creatures don't
never stay where they strike."</p>

<p>Dance and Bushrod were buried in the early afternoon. One of
the miners seemed to have been a minister in earlier days.
Unfrocked or resigned, he nevertheless stepped forward and
conducted the services. It occurred to Howison to start a song.
After the song, the women returned to the cabin and the men got
in a circle to discuss the next thing to be done.</p>

<p>"The regulars from Fort Lane are scoutin' the upper Rogue,"
said Kelly.</p>

<p>"Well," said Howison, "I don't doubt the governor will call
for militia companies in a few days. Meanwhile, we ought to
station a few men here, and a few somewhere on the river. Six in
either place should be enough. The rest of us can go home and get
better organized. This will be a campaign running through fall.
Who'll volunteer to stay here for three more days?"</p>

<p>"Where's Johnny Steele?" asked Stuart.</p>

<p>"He went back."</p>

<p>Caroline appeared in the doorway, studying the group. Young
Blazier swung toward her and presently returned, briefly
murmuring to Stuart. "Wants to see you."</p>

<p>She had changed her dress, and she had fixed her hair. As he
came up he realized she had something to say to him but found it
difficult; she took his arm and walked with him around the cabin
and along the trail. On this trail, he remembered, he had
proposed to her.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Logan?"</p>

<p>"Go back to Jacksonville to see what's become of my Crescent
pack string. We'll have six men here for a while. You and your
mother ought to come to town and put up at my place."</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I would not want to do that."</p>

<p>"You'll be doing it soon enough," he pointed out.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I never will leave here. I am going to be
married here and I am going to raise my children here. I could
not be a town woman. I could not be a woman moving around. I
could not live in the back of a store. It is a thing I even
thought of last night in the hills. I would disappoint you. It
came to me how much I would. We are not the same."</p>

<p>"Caroline&mdash;" he said.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "we are not the same. Maybe you think we could
grow to be the same, but when we got older we'd not change." Her
voice for the first time expressed her sadness. "You are not a
contented man. You never will be. But I want nothing to change.
It is my wish to look out from the cabin window and see my man
plowing, and at night to see him in the kitchen rocker. I never
want it to be different." He said, "Who will the man be?"</p>

<p>She looked at him, keenly watching him. "I guess you
know."</p>

<p>He nodded, remembering how it had been on the trail. He had
not cried at the sight of her; it was Vane Blazier who had cried.
She had known then where the love lay. "Blazier," he said.</p>

<p>She turned with him and said nothing more until they had
reached the cabin. "It is a hard thing for me to think of hurting
you. But I am not hurting you too much. Not nearly as much as
another woman already has."</p>

<p>He had the answer to that question he had earlier asked
himself. She had known what he lacked for her, and she was
refusing him now because it was too great a lack. "And I'd be
hurting you too much as time went on," he said. "That's it, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>She gave him the smallest and briefest of smiles. "Yes," she
said, and made a quick turn into the house. She stood in the
kitchen, her face drawn together, and her mother saw this and
spoke. "Caroline, it does no good to keep from cryin', if you've
got to cry."</p>

<p>Caroline walked into the bedroom and stood at its open window.
She was there when Logan rode by on his horse, and she stepped
back so that he wouldn't see her; but she kept her eyes on him
until he was far down the trail and at last turned from sight.
"It is him I'll be missing&mdash;just as he has been missing
Lucy. Now it's the other way around." The sense of loss was great
within her, and loneliness came to her with its first unbearable
shock. But even if she and Logan had lived the rest of their
lives together, she would still have been lonely, knowing how
much of him would never belong to her. It was better to take Vane
Blazier, who brought everything to her and would be happy
here.</p>

<p>She would not be giving Vane the kind of love she felt for
Stuart; that would always be something set apart. Still, she was
realist enough to know that she could hide that from Vane so that
he would never know it. A man never saw the things a woman saw.
Things would be good enough and time would soften much that now
seemed hard.</p>

<p>"Caroline," said Mrs. Dance, "are you a-going to cry? Some
people it helps a lot."</p>

<p>"No," said Caroline. "I'm not. Some people it doesn't
help."</p>

<p><br> <br> Camrose made his run to Stuart's stable unobserved,
got on the horse ready for him and rode to the stable's rear
door. All the miners along the creek had gone up the street,
leaving the back side of town empty. With the barn's bulk
shielding him from the street, he rode over the creek and into
the trees; thereafter he circled the town and drifted back, until
he was within a few yards of Overmire's cabin. He left the horse
in the timber and walked forward. The miners were grouped along
the street below him and he took somewhat of a chance when he
rounded the cabin and stepped through its open door. Lucy and her
mother were in the room. Overmire had gone down to join the
miners.</p>

<p>Lucy stared at Camrose. She said, "You ought not to have
risked it."</p>

<p>"You!" said Mrs. Overmire with considerable feeling. "You go
along. Who got you out?"</p>

<p>"Logan," said Lucy.</p>

<p>"I think," said Mrs. Overmire, "Logan's done enough for you,
George. And I think you've done too much." But she caught her
daughters glance and rose and left the cabin.</p>

<p>"A very cool reception," observed Camrose. It was
characteristic of him that when trouble came to him, he grew
humble; when the trouble went away, his old manner returned, easy
and cynical and quite forgetful. He gave her his close attention
and once again he was attempting to weigh her, to discover the
subtle shadings and the hesitations and qualified feelings which
he always suspected to be present in her. One hour before this
moment he had been a man with death closing upon him; now he was
the old Camrose, digging at this girl with his dissatisfied
mind.</p>

<p>"You'd better go," she said. "Don't you understand your
danger? Even my mother might signal the miners and bring them up
here."</p>

<p>"I have always felt the silent opposition of your people."</p>

<p>"You've been quite a man for feeling things," she said. "Some
of those things were never true. You made them up in your
mind."</p>

<p>"You've turned against me as all the rest have," he said.
"What kind of love is it which will not stand against rumors and
flimsy evidence? I see it clearly."</p>

<p>"You are also quite a man for seeing things," she said.</p>

<p>"And I have been right," he said. "There is little faith in
anybody, and not too much loyalty, or great and deep feeling. I
hate this camp. When the pack is for you, nothing you do is
wrong. When the pack is against you, nothing you do is
right."</p>

<p>"Do you know the risk Logan took in getting you free? Do you
know what the camp might do to him? He gambled all his popularity
when he helped you. If he loses it, you can say he did it because
you were his friend. He never deserted you."</p>

<p>"Very gallant," said Camrose, with his thin amusement. "Very
noble."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a sharp perception of his faults. They
were never clearer to her than now. "You speak of feeling, and of
loyalty. Yet you tear it down when you see it. You mock it. You
envy it."</p>

<p>"No doubt Stuart is a great man," he said in the same jeering
tone.</p>

<p>"In your heart you know he is loyal to you. Or was."</p>

<p>He said: "How did you know he helped me?"</p>

<p>"I know him. He would never rest until he had you out of
town." She rose and went to the door and looked into the falling
twilight. "You've got to leave here."</p>

<p>"You're anxious to be rid of me," he observed.</p>

<p>Once she had believed in him; he had destroyed that belief by
his own careless speech and behavior so that he was now a brittle
man without admirable qualities. It was a hard thing to remember
how she had felt about him, and how mistaken she had been. It
shamed her and made her lose faith in her own honesty.</p>

<p>"I'll get to San Francisco," he said. "If I should send for
you, would you come?"</p>

<p>"You already know I wouldn't, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Stuart," he said, "has used his friendship very well. Do you
see how profitably he has used his time to ruin what was between
us?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "In the beginning you had everything of
me. I was sure of you. I was happy. Then you began to destroy
that by the way you talked, by the way you accepted and neglected
everything, by the way you worked on my emotions&mdash;and stood
back to see how I might squirm and twist. There came a time when
I felt everything was wrong. But I couldn't admit I had been so
wrong, and I hoped you were not really what I began to see you
were. It is a terrible thing for a woman to fall in love, and
later realize she was mistaken. It makes her doubt there is such
a thing as love at all."</p>

<p>"All those nice words have not answered me," he said. "It is
Stuart now&mdash;until you find out he's common clay, as I am. By
God, I wish I could be sure you never got him. That's the only
regret I carry away from here."</p>

<p>She turned from him and sat down. She pushed her hands
together on her lap and looked down at them. "Well," she said,
"you can be sure of that. I won't get him."</p>

<p>Voices were breaking sharply along the slopes, making Camrose
suddenly aware of his danger. He had one more curosity in him.
"Do you believe I killed McIver?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. You are capable of it."</p>

<p>He returned from the cabin and reached his horse, at once
following a small miner's trail into the hills. It had grown
dark, and the wind was considerably colder, and he got to
thinking of his poor prospects. "I shall have to travel all
night. I've got no blankets and no grub. I'm as destitute now as
when I came here two years ago."</p>

<p>The trail dipped into a gulch and followed a small creek
marked by the scars of miner's shafts and miner's gravel pits. He
passed several deserted cabins, but about two miles from camp he
saw a light winking ahead of him and he drew up to consider it.
That would be Ed Grogan's place, an old fellow who on occasion
had come to town for a drunk. Grogan had food and Grogan
undoubtedly had a little dust. He would not be a difficult man to
tackle.</p>

<p>Grogan was inside cooking supper&mdash;the smell of it
standing in the air. Camrose dismounted and walked quickly
through the doorway and lifted his gun on Grogan as the latter,
seated at his table, raised his head.</p>

<p>"Camrose," he said. "You broke loose?"</p>

<p>"I need your supper, Grogan. I need some grub wrapped up."</p>

<p>Grogan shrugged his shoulders. "I guess you got the best of
the argument." He rose and walked to the far end of the cabin,
there finding a flour sack. He looked back over his shoulder.
"You'll have to travel mighty fast. The boys won't give up
easy."</p>

<p>"While you're about it, Grogan," said Cam-rose, "throw your
poke into the sack."</p>

<p>Grogan said at once: "I've got no dust."</p>

<p>"You're lying. You've got it in your back pocket. I see
it."</p>

<p>Grogan stood still, his head turned on his small body. He thus
watched Camrose who stood just inside the doorway; and as he
watched Camrose he also watched the doorway. "You know, George,"
he said, "I wasn't sure you'd killed McIver. But I guess the camp
was right."</p>

<p>"Move at it," said Camrose. "I can't wait long."</p>

<p>"You won't," said Grogan.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Camrose, and then remembered he had his
back to the door. He swung with the fastest motion he could
manage, but he swung too late. A bullet, coming out of the night,
tore through him, and Grogan, now free of danger, pulled his own
revolver and added a second shot. Camrose let his gun fall. He
placed both hands on the cabin wall and for a moment he gave
Grogan a wild, pale and bitter glance and then dropped to the
floor. Grogan walked over to him, and another man stepped in from
the night. Grogan said: "Good thing you came along, Ted."</p>

<p>Ted said: "There's a man who had a lot an education, a woman
and mighty fine prospects. He certainly panned out no color.
Don't quite figure it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Grogan, "I guess he had notions. Those things can
do a lot of harm."</p>

<p><br> <br> Stuart came into Jacksonville after dark, and got
his bad news from Clenchfield. The Crescent pack string had been
destroyed over in the Applegate valley. Stuart took that news
without much reaction. All he said was, "The Scotts-burg string
is gone, too, Henry. Blazier got clear, but I buried Murrow this
afternoon." He went on to his room, and washed. He stood awhile
in the room, roughly casting up his accounts. He had lost seventy
animals, several horses and a good many thousands of dollars of
merchandise; it required no great amount of addition to arrive at
his condition.</p>

<p>Clenchfield came to the doorway. "You know how you stand,
Logan?"</p>

<p>"We'll owe twenty thousand. Will this store and contents cover
that much?"</p>

<p>"Near enough," said Clenchfield.</p>

<p>"Then we'll be broke, but even. Not bad, Henry."</p>

<p>"Do you know what I did when I went broke? I had twenty pounds
in my pocket. I got drunk and woke in the street with a single
shilling. It was a long time ago. Maybe we both better get drunk
tonight."</p>

<p>Stuart smiled at Clenchfield's gloomy face.</p>

<p>"Trouble comes with fun. I've had my fun and here's the
trouble. Next week I'll ride down to San Francisco and hunt up
some credit. I'll have these strings moving out on the road again
soon enough. Then we'll have more fun, Henry."</p>

<p>"All that money," said Clenchfield, and was obsessed by the
tragedy of its loss.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Stuart, walking through the store. "We'll
get another deck and deal again. In this country, you can always
get another deck. Remember that."</p>

<p>He stopped before he got to the doorway, seeing Johnny Steele
come in. Johnny had a revolver in his hand; he reversed it and
handed it over. He said: "That's what you lent Cam-rose, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Where's Camrose?"</p>

<p>"He stayed a fool till the last," said Johnny. "Last night you
got him clear and he would have been free if he'd kept going.
Instead he stopped to rob Grogan, and Ted McGovern shot him.
There's the end of the man you were willing to ruin yourself
for."</p>

<p>Stuart moved to the store's big counter and put the gun on it.
He stood there, looking down. "I'm sorry," he said. "There was
good in that man."</p>

<p>Steele had an irritated answer. "You know better. You just got
your neck bowed and you won't face the truth of the matter."</p>

<p>"In another kind of country he might have made the grade.
Here, he lost out. It is a thin margin, Johnny, between what
could be, and what actually is."</p>

<p>"Well," said Steele, "you ran your own luck right out to the
end. Last night, I was of a mind to hang you to the same tree we
had picked for him. I guess we can forget that now."</p>

<p>Stuart turned and looked at Steele. "You see how thin the
margin is, Johnny?"</p>

<p>"It was thin for you, for a while," pointed out Steele.</p>

<p>"Thin for all of us, all the time. Where will you be tomorrow,
or where will I be? Maybe lucky and alive. Maybe dead like
George."</p>

<p>It was an unusual note of futility in Stuart which caused both
Clenchfield and Steele to look at him with puzzlement; and
presently Steele turned into the night without further comment.
Stuart remained at the counter, his hand idly turning the gun
around and around. His face, always inexpressive when in repose,
now was hard and lightless as he went far down into himself. Then
he pulled up. "Between the two of us, Henry, Camrose was all the
camp thought he was. But I could only do what I did&mdash;and
would do it again."</p>

<p>"It was never him you were doing it for," said
Clenchfield.</p>

<p>Stuart gave him a quick glance and left the store. He stood a
moment on the walk, watching the lamp-brightened doorway of the
Overmire cabin on the hill. He thought: "She believed in him and
never doubted him. Now she'll carry it in her mind the rest of
her life."</p>

<p>He crossed the street and walked up toward the cabin.</p>

<p><br> <br> Coming out of Stuart's, Johnny Steele paused a
moment to look upon the lamp-laced shadows of the street, and
then he turned with sudden decision and sudden excitement in him
and walked directly to the Lestrade cabin. "She can't be grievin'
much," he told himself as he knocked on her door. "He broke her
heart and she knows now he was a scoundrel."</p>

<p>He heard her call to him and he opened the door, to find her
bent before a half-filled trunk in the center of the room. She
had stripped the room bare.</p>

<p>"You're leaving?" he said. "For where?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere."</p>

<p>"I guess you've had a bad time of it," he said. "You're free
of it now. Nothing to make you cry. You've got people to go back
to?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "That door's shut, Johnny."</p>

<p>"Why go at all? You've got friends here." He paused and tried
to approach what was in his mind discreetly. "There are men here
who've looked at you a long while&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you one of the men, Johnny?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I am."</p>

<p>"You had your arms around me once," she said. "That made you
think of something. It is very nice to think of. But I'm not
free, Johnny. There will still be times when I cry&mdash;and for
the same reason you saw me cry before."</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "the man's dead. He can't hurt you again."</p>

<p>"Oh yes he can, Johnny."</p>

<p>She realized he understood little of it. He stood before her
with a feeling and a wish slowly darkening, slowly fading. She
came close to tears when she saw it&mdash;the niceness and the
comfort of it; but she smiled instead and came to him and gave
him a kiss on his forehead. Then she turned him around, the
pressure of her arm sending him toward the door. On the threshold
he swung, still troubled about her.</p>

<p>"But if you can't go to your folks, what's to become
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are other doors open, Johnny. Good-by."</p>

<p>She listened to him go and she thought: "He's a fine boy," and
afterwards the face of Jack Lestrade came before her, and all the
memories of him, good and bad, held her still. The people of
Jacksonville would judge him harshly, and they would think good
of her after she had gone. In that respect they were wrong. The
warmth, the color and the carelessness of Jack had drawn her
because those were the things she responded to; and she would
find them again in other men since she could not help it. As she
had said to. Johnny, other doors would be open. Still, it was
nice to know she left friends behind her&mdash;people who thought
her better than she was and wished her well.</p>

<p><br> <br> Stuart came to the doorway and found Overmire
sprawled before the stove. The two women were in the kitchen.
Overmire said: "How was it?"</p>

<p>"We had a skirmish and drove the Indians west."</p>

<p>Lucy was behind him, listening. She said: "What about the
Dances?"</p>

<p>"Ben and his son Bushrod were killed. The women are all
right." He turned, anxious to see her face. It was calmer than he
thought it would be, showing him no sorrow. The light of the lamp
softened her and warmth was on her lips. The old feeling of
nearness was arising again between them.</p>

<p>Overmire, impressed by the silence, remembered a chore to be
done and rose from the chair. "Mother," he said, "I'll get that
calico for you now."</p>

<p>Mrs. Overmire said: "You'd pick the wrong pattern, Overmire,"
and came instantly from the kitchen; and these two presently
moved into the night.</p>

<p>"They are never subtle about it, Logan."</p>

<p>He said: "I wish I could have stayed with George and got him
through."</p>

<p>"Do you know how he died?"</p>

<p>"I heard. There must have been a little mistake about
that."</p>

<p>She said: "You would always defend him."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "How could a man be really bad if a
woman loved him for two years? If he was bad you would have seen
it, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>She meant to speak of it and explain it; but she gave him a
short, sharp glance and walked on to the fireplace. "Shouldn't
Caroline be coming to town? It's dangerous where she is."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "She'll stay. She doesn't like town.</p>

<p>"How will you work that, Logan?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to work. She's marrying Blazier, not me."</p>

<p>"Logan&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"I didn't bring her enough. She knew that." She turned back to
him. "What does she want?" She stared at him, her expression
changing and lightening and filling. "Logan&mdash;what didn't you
bring her?"</p>

<p>"The same sort of thing you saw in Cam-rose," he said.</p>

<p>"He came here after you got him out of the office," she said.
"I wish he had not come. It's hard to look on a man and see, so
openly, the things you never want to see. It didn't happen
overnight, Logan. I knew it a year ago."</p>

<p>He said in the bluntest possible way, "Then why didn't you end
it a year ago?"</p>

<p>"He asked me that same question&mdash;and I gave him half of
the answer. How could I know if I was right in loving him, or
right in not loving him? How could I change so quickly, without
admitting I was foolish and irresponsible?" She looked at him
keenly, anxiously. "Caroline saw that you weren't in love with
her. I knew it too. Were you afraid of interfering with George
and me?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to keep out of your way."</p>

<p>"Now I'll tell you what I couldn't tell George. If I had left
him, what would you think of me? George grew smaller and you grew
greater but I could never explain to you how such a thing was
possible."</p>

<p>"Why, Lucy," he said, "I held him up, because he was the one
you wanted."</p>

<p>"I knew that too," she said. "But he ceased to be the man I
wanted long ago."</p>

<p>He drew a great and gusty breath into his lungs and let it
softly spill out of him.</p>

<p>"Why did you want me to help him get away?"</p>

<p>"If he had been hung, his ghost would always have been between
us."</p>

<p>She grew warm and beautiful before him with the increasing
fullness of these moments. She was fair and constant&mdash;and
waiting eagerly for him. He spoke her name softly, as he had so
often spoken it to himself. "Lucy," he said and put out his hands
to her. She was smiling when she came to him and kissed him. Then
she drew back and her manner changed to a terrible soberness and
he saw fear in her eyes. "Logan," she said, "can you believe that
this is what always should have been?"</p>

<p>"That time in Portland," he said. "You thought I was going out
to another woman. You had hate in your eyes, Lucy. I ought to
have known what it meant. You have always had something in your
eyes for me."</p>

<p>She lifted her mouth to him and she said, "I thought we had
lost each other," and her arms made a pressure around his
shoulders. This was the way it never ceased to be between them,
this closeness, this rough demand, this insistence. There never
would be an end to it and never enough of it.</p>
