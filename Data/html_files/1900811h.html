<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. Call This Land Home</h2>

<p>One at a time, the emigrant families fell out where the land
most pleased them, and at last only two wagons of the overland
caravan moved southward along the great green valley of Oregon;
then the Potters discovered their fair place and John Mercy drove
on with his lone wagon, his wife in unhappy silence beside him, and
Caroline and young Tom under the canvas cover behind. Through the
puckered opening at the wagon's rear young Tom saw the Potters grow
dim in the steaming haze of this wet day. Rain lightly drummed on
the canvas; he listened to the talk of his people.</p>

<p>"Have we got to live so far from everybody?" his mother
asked.</p>

<p>In his father's voice was that fixed mildness which young Tom
knew so well. "The heart of a valley's always better than foot or
head. I want two things&mdash;the falls of a creek for my mill and
plenty of open land roundabout."</p>

<p>She said, "Rough riding won't do for me much longer."</p>

<p>"I know," he said, and drove on.</p>

<p>In middle afternoon two days later, the wagon stopped and his
father said, "I believe we're here." Crawling over the tail gate,
young Tom&mdash;Thomas Jackson Mercy, age eight&mdash;saw the place
on which he was to spend the rest of his long life. In three
directions the fall-cast green earth ran away in gentle meadow
vistas, here and there interrupted by low knobs and little islands
of timber, and cross-hatched by the brushy willow borders of
creeks. On the fourth side a hill covered by fir and cedar ran down
upon the wagon. A stream smaller than a river but bigger than a
branch came across the meadows, dropped over a two-foot rock ledge
like a bent sheet of glittering glass, and sharply curved to avoid
the foot of the hill, running on toward some larger stream beyond
view.</p>

<p>John Mercy turned toward the wagon to give his wife a hand, and
young Tom noted that she came down with a careful awkwardness. Then
his father stamped the spongy earth with his feet and bent over and
plunged his tough fingers into the soil and brought up a sample,
squeezing and crumbling it and considering it closely. He was a
very tall man, a very powerful man, and all his motions were
governed by a willful regularity. A short curly beard covered his
face as far as the cheekbones; a big nose, scarred white at the
bridge, stood over a mouth held firm by constant habit. He seemed
to be smiling, but it was less a smile than a moment of keen
interest which forced little creases around mouth and eyes. To
young Tom, his father, at twenty-eight, was an old man.</p>

<p>John Mercy said, "It will take a week of clear weather to dry
this ground for plowing." He turned, looking at the timber close
by, and at the rising slope of the hill; he put his hands on his
hips, and young Tom knew his father was searching out a place for
the cabin. A moment later Mercy swung to face his wife with a
slightly changed expression. She had not moved since leaving the
wagon; she stood round-shouldered and dejected in the soft rain,
reflecting on her face the effect of the gray day, the dampness and
the emptiness which lay all around them. Young Tom had never seen
her so long idle, for she was brisk in everything she did, always
moving from chore to chore.</p>

<p>Mercy said, "In another two years you'll see neighbors wherever
you look."</p>

<p>"That's not now," she said.</p>

<p>"The Willamette's beyond this hill somewhere. There's settlers
on it."</p>

<p>She said, "I long for back home," and turned from him and stood
still again, facing the blind distance.</p>

<p>John Mercy stepped to the wagon and lifted the ax from its
bracket. He said to young Tom, "Go cut a small saplin' for a pole,
and some uprights," and handed over the ax. Then he got into the
wagon and swung it around to drive it under the trees. When young
Tom came out of the deeper timber with his saplings, the oxen were
unyoked and a fire burned beneath the massive spread of a cedar.
The tail gate was down and his father had reversed an empty tub to
make a step from wagon to ground. Between them, they made a frame
for the extra tarpaulin to rest on, thereby creating a shelter. His
mother stood by, still with her unusual helplessness on her and he
knew, from his father's silence, that there was trouble between
them.</p>

<p>His father said, "Water, Tom," and went on working. When Tom
came back with the big camp kettle filled, his father had driven
uprights at either side of the fire, connected by a cross-piece on
which the hook hung. He lifted the camp kettle to the hook and
listened a moment to the fire hissing against the kettle's wet
bottom. The grub box was let down from the wagon box, but his
mother was idle at the fire, one arm around Caroline, who stood by
her. His father was at the edge of the timber, facing the meadow;
he went over.</p>

<p>"Now, then," his father said, "it's sickly weather and we've got
to get up a cabin. It'll go here. We'll cut the small trees yonder,
for that's where the good house will stand someday. So we'll be
doing two things at the same time&mdash;making the cabin and
clearing the yard." His eyes, gray to their bottom-most depths,
swung around, and their effect was like heavy weight on young Tom.
It was seldom that he gave young Tom his undivided attention.
"We've got everything to do here, and nothing to do it with but our
hands. Never waste a lick, and make every lick work twice for you
if you can. No man lives long enough to get done all he wants to
do, but if he works slipshod and has got to do it over, then he
wastes his life. I'll start on that tree. You trim and cut."</p>

<p>The blows of the ax went through the woods in dull echoing, not
hurried&mdash;for his father never hurried&mdash;but with the even
tempo of a clock's ticking. His mother worked around the grub box
with her disheartened slowness. First shadows were sooty in the
timber and mist moved in from the meadows. He listened to the
sounds of the empty land with fascination; he watched the corridors
of the timber for moving things, and he waited for the tree to
fall.</p>

<p>The rains quit. Warmed by a mild winter sun, the meadows exhaled
fleecy wisps of steam which in young Tom's imagination became the
smoke of underground fires breaking through. They dropped trees of
matched size, cut and notched and fitted them. When the walls were
waist high, Mercy rigged an incline and a block and tackle, but
even with that aid his body took the weight of each log, his boots
sank deep into the spongy soil and his teeth showed in white
flashes when hard effort pulled back his lips.</p>

<p>After supper, with a fire blazing by the cabin, Mercy adzed out
the rough boards for window and doorframe and inner furniture, and
late at night young Tom woke to hear his father's froe and mallet
splitting the cedar roof shakes, and sometimes heard his mother
fretfully calling, "Mercy, come now! It's late enough!" Lying
awake, he listened to his father come into the wagon and settle
down upon the mattress with a groaning sigh and fall at once
asleep. The dying yellow of the firelight flickered against the
wagon canvas; strange sounds rustled in the windy woods, and far
off was the baying of timber wolves. Caroline, disturbed by that
wild sound, stirred against him.</p>

<p>The rains held off and the meadows dried before the roof of the
cabin was on. John Mercy said, "It might be the last clear spell
all winter. I have got to stop the cabin and break that meadow and
get the wheat in." He looked at his wife. "Maybe you won't mind
living in the wagon a week longer."</p>

<p>"I mind nothing," she said, "except being here."</p>

<p>John Mercy turned to his son. "Go round up the animals."</p>

<p>The two brindled oxen were deep in the meadow. Driving them back
to the cabin, Tom saw his people at the campfire; they were saying
things not meant for him, his mother with her arms tight across her
breasts and her head flung up. Presently his father turned away to
yoke the oxen, hitch on the breaking plow and go into the
meadow.</p>

<p>The ancient turf became coiled, gloss-brown strips. John Mercy
watched the sky as he plowed and worked until the furrows grew
ragged in the fading day; and ate and built his fire and hewed out
the cabin rafters, and by morning's first twilight shadows he was
at work again, harrowing the meadow into rough clods, into pebbled
smoothness. The gray clouds thickened in the southwest and the wind
broke and whirled them on. With the wheat sack strapped before him
like an apron, John Mercy sowed his grain, reaching for the seed,
casting with an even sweep, pacing on, and reaching and casting
again. Young Tom sawed out the top logs, shortening and angling
each cut meant for the cabin's peak; and at night, by the bonfire's
swaying glow, he laid his weight against the block-and-tackle rope
while his father heaved the logs up the incline into place.</p>

<p>On Sunday his father said, "Take the gun, Tom, and go over this
hill and keep on till you find the Willamette. See what you can
see. Come back around the side of the hill and tell me which is the
short way."</p>

<p>Within a hundred yards the cabin vanished behind the great
bark-ribbed firs whose trunks were thicker through than the new
cabin. They ran far to the sky and an easy cry came out of them as
they swayed to the wind. Pearly shafts of light slanted into this
fragrant wilderness place, like the shafts of judgment light
shining from heaven to earth in Redway's old geography book. Fern
and hazel stood head high to him, and giant deadfalls lay with
their red-brown rotted wood crumbling away.</p>

<p>He climbed steadily, now and then crossing short ravines in
whose black marsh bottom the devil stock stiffly grew, and stung
him as he passed; and down a long vista he saw a buck deer poised
alertly at a pool. His gun rose, but then he remembered the cool
voice of his father saying, "Never kill meat far from home," and he
slapped his hand against the gun stalk and watched the deer go
bounding into the deeper forest gloom.</p>

<p>A long two miles brought him to the crest of the hill, from
which he saw the surface of a big river showing between the lower
trees. Another half mile, very rough, brought him down to the
river's margin; he turned to the right and presently the timber and
the hill rolled out into the meadowlands. Directly over the river
he saw a cabin in a clearing, and saw a girl at the break of the
bluff watching him. He looked at her and suffered his short shock
of disappointment to find a house and people here, for he had been
until this moment a lone explorer pushing through a wild and empty
place.</p>

<p>At such a distance he would not clearly see her face; she was
about his size, and she stared at him with a motionless interest.
He stirred his feet in the soft earth and he raised his hand and
waved it, but she continued to look at him, not answering, and in a
little while he turned and followed the open meadows as they bent
around the toe of the dark hill and reached home before noon.</p>

<p>His father said, "What did you see?"</p>

<p>"The river's on the other side of the hill, but it's easier to
go around the hill. I saw a deer."</p>

<p>"That's all?"</p>

<p>"And a cabin across the river," said Tom. "There was a girl in
the yard."</p>

<p>John Mercy looked to his wife. "Now," he said quietly, "there's
one neighbor," and waited for her answer.</p>

<p>She looked at him, reluctant to be pleased. "How far away?"</p>

<p>Young Tom said, "More than an hour, I guess."</p>

<p>His mother said, "If they saw you, they'll come to visit...and
it's a terrible camp they'll see...Caroline, go scrub and change
your dress. I've got to fix your hair." Suddenly she was irritably
energetic, moving around to put away the scattered pans and the
loose things lying under the canvas shelter.</p>

<p>John Mercy went toward a pile of saplings roughly cut into
rafters; he cast a secret glance of benevolence at young Tom.
Something had pleased him. He said, "We'll get these on in short
order."</p>

<p>The saplings went up and crosspoles were set across them. The
first row of shakes was laid when a man's strong halloo came
ringing in from the meadow and a family moved through the trees,
man and wife, two tall boys carrying sacks, and the girl young Tom
noticed across the river.</p>

<p>The man said in a great, grumbling voice, "Neighbor, by the
Lord, we could of saved you sweat on that cabin if we'd known you
were here. Teal is my name. Iowa."</p>

<p>Talk broke through this quiet like a sudden storm. The two women
moved beyond the wagon, and young Tom heard their voices rush back
and forth in tumbling eagerness. The men were at the cabin.</p>

<p>Teal said, "Boys, you're idle. This man needs shakes for his
roof. Go split 'em. It's a-going to rain, Mercy, and when it rains
here, it's the world drowned out. The drops are big as banty eggs.
They bust like ripe watermelons, they splatter, they splash. You're
soaked, your shoes squash, you steam like a kettle on a fire. Boys,
don't stand there. Mercy and me will lay on what shakes that's
cut."</p>

<p>The Teal girl stood in front of young Tom and stared at him with
direct curiosity. She was not quite his height; she was berry
brown, with small freckles on her nose, and her hair hung down
behind in one single braid. Caroline cautiously moved forward and
looked to the Teal girl, and suddenly put out a hand and touched
her dress. The Teal girl took Caroline's hand, but she kept her
eyes on young Tom.</p>

<p>"I saw you," she said.</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Mary," said the Teal girl, and turned with the quickest motion
and walked toward the older women.</p>

<p>The Teal boys worked on shakes, one splitting, one drawing the
cedar panels down with the knife. The wind lifted and the roar of
it was the dashing of giant cataracts all through the deep places
in the forest; the men talked steadily as they worked. The smell of
frying steak&mdash;brought by the Teals&mdash;was in the air to
tantalize young Tom. He leaned against a tree and watched Mary Teal
from the corner of his eye, then turned and walked away from the
trees to the falls of the creek and squatted at the edge of the
pool, his shadow sending the loafing trout into violent crisscross
flight. Gray clouds ran low over the land and a deepening haze
crawled forward. He hunched himself together, like a savage over a
fire; he listened into the wind and waited for the scurrying shapes
of the enemy to come trotting in war file out of the misty willow
clumps. He sat there a long while, the day dull around him. The
wind increased and the pool's silver surface showed the pocking of
rain. His mother's voice called him back to mealtime.</p>

<p>He ate by the fire, listening to the voices of the older people
go on and on. His mother's face was red from the heat of the fire,
and her eyes were bright and she was smiling; his father sat
comfortably under the cedar tree, thawed by the company. It was
suddenly half dark, the rain increasing, and the Teals rose and
spoke their farewells and filed off through the trees, Mr. Teal's
last cheerful call returning to them.</p>

<p>Silence returned; loneliness deepened.</p>

<p>His mother said, "It was good to see people."</p>

<p>"They'll be fine neighbors," his father said.</p>

<p>His mother's face tightened. She looked over the flames and
suddenly seemed to remember her fears. "Four miles away," she said,
and turned to the dishes on the camp table. She grew brisk. "Tom, I
want water. Stack these dishes, Caroline, and come out of the
rain."</p>

<p>John Mercy went into the darkness beyond the cabin and built his
work fire; lying awake in bed, young Tom heard his father's mallet
steadily splitting out shakes, and he continued to hear the sound
in his sleep.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>By morning a great wind cried across the world. John Mercy
lighted the campfire and cooked breakfast for the women within the
wagon. He laid on heavy logs for the fire's long burning and took a
piece of rope and the ax and hammer and nails. "We have got a chore
to do at the river," he said to young Tom. "You pack the gun." They
skirted the foot of the hill, trailing beside a creek stained muddy
by the storm. The meadow turf was spongy underfoot and the
southwest wind roughly shoved them forward through sheets of fat
raindrops sparkling in the mealy light. When they reached the river
they saw a lamp burning in the window of the Teal house, but John
Mercy swung to a place where the hill's timber met the bluff of the
stream.</p>

<p>"There will come a time," he said, "when I'll have to send you
to the Teals' for help. You'll need a raft to cross."</p>

<p>They cut down and trimmed six saplings for a raft bed, bound
them with two crosspieces nailed in. A pole, chipped flat at one
end, made an oar. Then John Mercy tied the rope to the raft and
towed it upstream a hundred yards beyond the Teal house. He drew it
half from the water and secured the rope to an overhanging tree and
laid the oar in the brush. "You'll drift as you paddle," he
said.</p>

<p>Homeward-bound, the wind came at them face on. Young Tom bent
against it, hearing his father's half-shouted words, "It ought to
be a month or more before the baby's due. But we're alone out here,
and accidents come along. We've got to expect those things. No
sensible man watches his feet hit ground. He looks ahead to see
what kind of ground they'll hit next."</p>

<p>They came around a bend of the creek and heard a massive cannon
crack of sound in the hills above them, and the ripping fall of a
tree; its jarring collision with the earth ran out to them. They
pressed on, John Mercy's pace quickening as though a new thought
disturbed him. High in the air was an echo like the crying of a
bird, lasting only a moment and afterward shredded apart by the
storm, but it rose again thinner and wilder and became a woman's
voice screaming.</p>

<p>John Mercy's body broke from its channeled steadiness and he
rushed around the last bend of the hill, past the pool of the falls
and into the cabin clearing. Young Tom followed, the gun across his
chest. Through the trees he saw a figure by the campfire, not his
mother's figure, but a dark head and a dark face standing above
some kind of cloak. His father stopped at the fire before the
stranger; reaching the scene, young Tom discovered that the
stranger was an Indian. His mother stood back against the wagon
with a butcher knife in her hand; her face shocked him, white and
strange-stretched as it was.</p>

<p>He lifted the gun, waiting. The Indian was old and his cheeks
were round holes rimmed by jawbone and temple. His eyes were sick.
His hand, stretched through the blanket, was like the foot of a
bird, nothing but bone and wrinkled dark flesh. He spoke something,
he pointed at the food locker. For a moment&mdash;for a
time-stopped space in which the acid clarity of this scene ate its
way so deeply into young Tom's memory that ninety years of living
neither changed nor dimmed a detail of it&mdash;he watched the
latent danger rise around his father's mouth and flash in his eyes;
then, with complete unexpectedness, his father turned to the grub
box and found half a loaf of bread. He laid it in the Indian's
fingers&mdash;those fingers closing down until they almost
disappeared in the bread. His father pointed at the gun in young
Tom's hand and pointed back to the Indian, snapping down his thumb
as though firing; he seized the Indian at the hips, lifting him
like a half-emptied sack, walked a few steps and dropped him and
gave him an onward push. The Indian went away without looking
behind him, his shoulders bent.</p>

<p>His mother's voice, high-pitched and breathless, drew young
Tom's attention. She was shaking, and in her eyes was great
wildness. "I don't want to be here! I didn't want to come! Mercy,
you've got to take me home! I want my old house back! I want my
people! I'll die here!"</p>

<p>John Mercy said, "Tom, take your sister for a walk."</p>

<p>Caroline stood in the doorway of the cabin, frightened by the
scene. Young Tom went over to catch her hand. The half-covered roof
kept Caroline dry, and he stood indecisively under this shelter
disliking to leave it, yet compelled by his father's order.</p>

<p>John Mercy lifted his wife into his arms, speaking, "The
creature was harmless. There are no bad Indians around here. I know
the weather's poor and there's no comfort, but I'll have the roof
on the cabin by tonight." He carried her into the wagon, still
talking.</p>

<p>Young Tom heard his mother's voice rising again, and his
father's patient answering. He clung to Caroline's hand and watched
the rain-swept world beyond the cabin and saw no other shelter to
which he might go. He was hard pressed to make up his mind, and
when his father came out of the wagon, he said in self-defense,
"Caroline would get awfully wet if I took her for a walk."</p>

<p>John Mercy said, "You did right. Caroline, go keep your mother
company." He looked to the unfinished roof, he drew a hand down
across his waster-crusted beard, and for a moment he remained
stone-still, his whole body sagged down with its accumulation of
weariness. He drew a long breath and straightened. "Soon as I
finish the roof, Tom, we'll line the fireplace with clay. I'll need
some straw to mix with the clay. You go along the creek where the
old hay's rotted down. Bring me several swatches of it."</p>

<p>The rain walked over the earth in constant sheets, beating down
grass and weeds and running vines; the creek grew violent between
its banks and the increased falls dropped roaring into its pool.
Bearing his loads of dead grass to the cabin, young Tom watched his
father lay the last rows of shakes on the roof and cap the ridge
with boards hewn out earlier by the late firelight; afterward John
Mercy, working faster against the fading day, went beside the creek
to an undercut bank and shoveled out its clay soil, carrying it
back to the cabin by bucket. He cooked a quick supper and returned
to the cabin, mixing clay and dead grass stems, and coated the wood
fireplace and its chimney with this mortar. He built a small fire,
which, by drying the mud, would slowly season it to a brick-hard
lining.</p>

<p>Throughout the night, fitfully waking, young Tom heard the dull
thumping of a hammer, and twice heard his mother call out, "Mercy,
come to bed!" At daybreak young Tom found a canvas door at the
cabin; inside, a fire burned on the dirt hearth and a kettle
steamed from the crane. The crevices between logs were mud-sealed,
the table and grub box and benches had been brought in. Standing
before the fire, young Tom heard the wind search the outer wall and
fall away, and suddenly the warmth of the place thawed the coldness
which lay beneath his skin. He heard his mother come in, and he
turned to see his parents standing face to face, almost like
strangers.</p>

<p>His mother said, "Mercy, did you sleep at all?"</p>

<p>His father's answer was somehow embarrassed. "I had to keep the
fire alive, so the mud would dry right. Today I'll get the
puncheons on the floor and we can move the beds in." In a still
gentler voice, the uncertainness of apology in it, his father
added, "Maybe, if you shut your eyes and think how all this will
look five years from now&mdash;"</p>

<p>She cut him off with the curt swing of her body, and walked to
the fire. Stooping with a slowness so unlike her, she laid the
Dutch oven against the flame and went to the grub box. She put her
yellow mixing bowl on the table, she got her flour and her
shortening and her salt. She stood a moment over the mixing bowl,
not looking at John Mercy. "As long as I can do my share, I'll do
it. Tom, fetch me the pail of water."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He stood with his father at the break of the trees, viewing the
yellow-gray turf of the meadow, and the plowed ground beyond it,
and the valley floor running away to the great condensed wall of
mist. He knew, from the dead gentleness of tone, that his father
was very tired; it was not like him to waste time speaking of the
future. "The orchard will go right in front of this spot," his
father said. "That will be pretty to look at from the house. The
house will stand where we're standing. These firs will go down." He
was silent, drawing the future forward and finding comfort in it.
"All this is free&mdash;all this land. But it's up to a man to make
something out of it. So there's nothing free. There never is. We'll
earn every acre we get. Don't trust that word 'free.' Don't believe
it. You'll never own anything you didn't pay for. But what you pay
for is yours. You've got it while other men wait around for
something free, and die with nothing. Now, then, we have got to cut
down some small firs, about eight inches through. We'll split them
in half for floor puncheons."</p>

<p>He turned, walking slower than usual; he searched the trees,
nodding at one or the other, and stopped at a thin fir starved by
the greater firs around it; its trunk ran twenty feet without a
branch. "That one," he said, and went to the cabin wall for his ax.
"Tom," he said, "I want you to go up in the hills and see how close
you can find a ledge of rock. That's for the fireplace floor." He
faced the tree, watching the wind whip its top; he made an undercut
on the side toward which he wished the tree to fall, and squared
himself away to a steady chopping.</p>

<p>Young Tom passed the cabin, upward bound into the semi-darkness
of the hill; the great trees groaned in their swaying, and their
shaken branches let down ropy spirals of rain. It was like walking
into a tunnel full of sound. His overcoat grew heavy with water
which, dripping on his trousers legs, turned them into ice-cold
bands; his shoes were mushy. Behind him he heard the first
crackling of the tree going down, and he turned and saw his father
running. The tree, caught by the wind, was falling the wrong way.
He shouted against the wind; his father looked behind, saw the
danger and jumped aside. The tree, striking a larger fir, bounced
off, and young Tom saw its top branches whip out and strike his
father to the ground. His father shouted, buried somewhere beneath
that green covering.</p>

<p>His mother came crying out of the cabin. "Mercy! Mercy!" She
stumbled and caught herself, and rushed on, fighting the branches
away as she reached the tree.</p>

<p>When he got there, he saw his father lying with both legs
beneath the trunk. The branches, first striking, had broken the
force of the trunk's fall; and then they had shattered, to let the
trunk down upon his father who lay on an elbow with his lips the
color of gray flour paste. Young Tom never knew until then how
piercing a gray his father's eyes were.</p>

<p>His mother cried, "Your legs! Oh, God, Mercy!" She bent over
him, she seized the trunk of the tree and she stiffened under her
straining. John Mercy's voice was a vast shout of warning, "Martha,
don't do that!" His arm reached out and struck her on the hip. "Let
go!" She drew back and laid both arms over her stomach, a shock of
pain pressing her face into its sharp angles. "Oh, Mercy," she
said, "it's too late!" and stared down at him in terror.</p>

<p>Young Tom raced to the cabin wall, got the shovel and rushed
back; a branch interfered with his digging. He found the ax, thrown
ten yards away by Mercy in his flight; he returned to cut the limb
away. Mercy lay still, as though he were listening. He watched his
wife, and he put a hand over his eyes and seemed to be thinking;
the impact of the ax on the trunk threw twinges of pain through
him, but he said nothing until young Tom had finished.</p>

<p>"Give me the shovel," he said. "Now go get Mrs. Teal."</p>

<p>Young Tom stood irresolute. "You got to get out of there."</p>

<p>"Those legs," said John Mercy, and spoke of them as though they
didn't belong to him, "are pinched. If they were broken, I'd know
it...and they're not." He paused and a dead gray curtain of pain
came down on his face; he suffered it and waited for it to pass.
"Do as I tell you." Young Tom whirled and started away at a hard
run, and was almost instantly checked and swung by his father's
command, "You've got a long way to go, and you'll not do it
starting that fast. Steady now. I've told you before. Think
ahead."</p>

<p>Young Tom began again, trotting out upon the meadow; he looked
back and saw his father awkwardly working with the shovel,
sheltered by the outstretched apron of his mother. But even before
young Tom ceased to look, she dropped the apron, put both hands
before her face and walked toward the wagon.</p>

<p>The scene frightened him, and he broke into a dead run along the
margin of the creek, and began to draw deep into his lungs for
wind; he ran with his fists doubled, his arms lunging back and
forth across his chest. A pain caught him in the side, and he
remembered his father's advice and slowed to a dogtrot. He grew hot
and stopped once to crawl down the bank of a creek for a drink, and
was soon chilled by the wet ground against his stomach and the rain
beating on his back.</p>

<p>After a rest of a minute he went on, stiffened by that short
pause. The river willows at last broke through the rain mist
forward, and the low shape of the Teal cabin. He crossed the last
meadow and came to the bank; he hadn't forgotten the raft, but he
wanted to save time. The wind was with him, carrying his shrill
call over the water. He repeated it twice before the cabin door
opened and Mrs. Teal stepped to the yard. Young Tom raised his arm,
pointing behind him toward his home. Mrs. Teal waved back at him
immediately and ran into the house.</p>

<p>Squatted on the bank, young Tom saw the three Teal men come out,
lift a boat and carry it to the water; in a moment Mrs. Teal joined
them, and the four came over the river. Mrs. Teal had a covered
basket in her hand. She said, "Your mother, Tom?"</p>

<p>"My father's caught under a sapling that fell on him. That made
mother sick."</p>

<p>Teal turned on his lank, Indian-dark sons. "Grit ahead and help
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, Lord," said Mrs. Teal. "Take the basket, Nate. We've
got to go fast. It's going to be unnatural."</p>

<p>Young Tom started after the Teal boys, they running away with a
loose and ranging ease. "No," said Teal, "you stay with us. You've
had runnin' enough. The boys are a pair of hounds; let 'em go."</p>

<p>They went forward, Mrs. Teal now and then speaking to herself
with a soft exclamation of impatience. Otherwise there was no talk.
The wind was against them and the rain beat down. Young Tom opened
his mouth to let the great drops loosen his dry throat, and
silently suffered the slow pace. The coming baby never entered his
mind; it was his father lying under the tree that he thought of
with dread, and when the creek began to bend around the toe of the
hills, close by the falls, he ran ahead and reached the house.</p>

<p>His father had dug himself out from the trap; there was a little
tunnel of earth where he had been. The two boys stood silently at
the fire, and one of them motioned toward the cabin. Young Tom drew
the doorway canvas back from the logs, looking in; his father had
moved the bedstead from the wagon and had set it up near the
cabin's fireplace. His mother was on it, groaning, and his father
knelt at the bedside and held her hands. Young Tom retreated to the
fire, watching the Teals come through the trees. Mrs. Teal seized
the basket from her husband and went at once into the cabin; a
moment later his father came out.</p>

<p>John Mercy said to Teal, "It's a good thing to have neighbors.
I'm sorry I can't offer you coffee at this minute." He let his chin
drop and he spread his hands before the fire and gravely watched
it. The sockets of his eyes seemed deep and blackened; his mouth
was a line straight and narrow across his skin.</p>

<p>"My friend," said Teal, "the first winter's always a bad one.
Don't work so hard or you'll be twenty years older by spring."</p>

<p>He turned to the taller of his two sons. "Joe, take Mercy's gun
and go fetch in a deer."</p>

<p>Young Tom heard his mother's sharp cry from the cabin. He moved
away, he stood by the tree and stared at the trench in which his
father had been, and noticed the marks scrubbed into the soft
ground by his father's elbows. He walked along the tree and gave it
a kick with his foot, and continued to the millpond. Here he
squatted, watching the steamy rain mists pack tight along the
willows of the creek. In the distance, a mile or so, a little
timbered butte stood half concealed by the fog, seeming to ride
free in the low sky. He tightened his muscles, waiting for the
enemy to come single file through the brush, but then he thought of
the old savage, so bony and stooped and unclean, who had seized the
half loaf of bread, and his picture of a row of glistening copper
giants was destroyed. He heard voices by the cabin, and rose and
saw Mrs. Teal by the fire. He went back.</p>

<p>Mrs. Teal looked at him with her kindness. "Your mother's all
right, Tom. You had a brother, but he wasn't meant to stay. You
understand, Tom? It's meant that way and you oughtn't sorrow."</p>

<p>She meant the baby boy was dead. He thought about it and wanted
to feel like crying, but he hadn't seen this boy and he didn't know
anything about him, and didn't know what to cry for. It embarrassed
him not to feel sad. He stood with his eyes on the fire.</p>

<p>Teal said to his other son, "That Methodist preacher is probably
down at Mission Bottom, Pete. You go home, get the horse and go for
him." He walked a little distance onward, speaking in a lower tone
to his son. Then the son went on, and Teal turned back to the cabin
and got the saw standing by the wall and went over to the fallen
log. He called to young Tom, "Now then, let's not be idle men.
Puncheons he wanted, wasn't it? We'll just get 'em ready while we
wait."</p>

<p>A shot sounded deeper in the forest&mdash;one and no more,
"There's your meat," said Teal. "You've seen the trout in the
creek, ain't you? Mighty fat. Next summer there'll be quail all
through those meadow thickets. What you've got to have is a horse
for ridin'. Just a plain ten-dollar horse. I know where there's
one."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The minister arrived around noon the next day, and out of this wet
and empty land the neighbors began to come, riding or walking in
from all quarters of the mist-hidden valley, destroying forever
young Tom's illusion of wilderness. They came from the scattered
claims along the river, from French Prairie, from the upper part of
the La Creole, from strangely named creeks and valleys as far as
twenty miles away; the yard was filled with men, and women worked
in the cabin and at the fire outside the cabin. Young Tom stared at
strange boys running through the timber, and resented their
trespassing; he heard girls giggling in the shelter of the wagon.
It was a big meeting. A heavy man in buckskins, light of eye and
powerfully voiced, strolled through the crowd and had a word for
everyone. People visited and the talk was of the days of the
wagon-train crossing, of land here and land there, of politics and
the Hudson's Bay Company. A group of men walked along the break of
the hill until they reached a knoll a hundred yards from the cabin.
He watched them digging.</p>

<p>In a little while they returned, bringing quietness to the
people. The minister came from the cabin, bareheaded in the rain.
Mr. Teal followed, carrying a small bundle wrapped within a sheet
and covered by a shawl; they went on toward the grave, and young
Tom, every sense sharpened, heard the knocking of a hammer and the
calling of a voice. The crowd moved over and his father walked from
the cabin, carrying his mother. Young Tom saw Caroline alone at the
cabin's doorway, crying; he went to her and got her hand and
followed his father.</p>

<p>A little box stood at the grave, the minister by it; he had a
book in his hand which he watched while the rain dripped down his
long face. Young Tom's mother was on her feet, but she wasn't
crying, though all the women around her were. The minister spoke a
long while, it seemed to Tom. He held Caroline's hand and grew
cold, waiting for the minister's words to end. Somebody said,
"Amen," and the minister began a song, all the people joining.</p>

<p>Looking at his feet, young Tom felt the coldness run up his
legs, and his chest was heavy and he, too, cried. As soon as the
song was done, his father carried his mother back to the house and
the crowd returned to the fire. A woman dumped venison steaks into
a big kettle on the table, and cups and plates went around and the
talk grew brisker than it had been before.</p>

<p>Young Tom said, "Caroline, you go into the wagon." From the
corners of his eyes he saw men shoveling dirt into the grave; he
thought about the grave and imagined the rains filling it with
water, and the shawl and the white sheet growing black in the mud.
He went over to the fallen log and sat on it.</p>

<p>He remained there, wholly lost in the forest of his imagination
while the round-about neighbors, finished with eating and finished
with visiting, started homeward through the dulling day. They went
in scattered groups, as they had come, their strong calling running
back and forth in the windy rain; and at last only the Teals
remained. He saw Caroline and Mary Teal watching him through the
front opening of the wagon. He rose and went around to the cabin,
hearing the older Teals talking.</p>

<p>Mrs. Teal said, "I'm needed. We'll stay tonight."</p>

<p>Teal looked at his two tall sons. "You had best get at those
puncheons. Mercy's legs will trouble him for a while. Tomorrow we
are agoin' to knock down some trees for a barn lean-to."</p>

<p>Young Tom quietly drew back the canvas covering of the cabin's
doorway. He was troubled about his mother and wanted to see her,
and meant to go in. But what he saw suddenly shut him out and
brought great embarrassment to him.</p>

<p>His father stood beside the bed, looking down, and young Tom
heard him say, "I can't stay here when your heart's not in it.
There is no pleasure in this work, and no point in looking ahead to
what it'll be someday, if you don't feel it too. Well, you don't.
We'll go home in the spring when it's possible to travel. That's
what you want, I clearly know."</p>

<p>She was pale and her eyes were stretched perfectly round; her
head rolled slightly, her voice was very small. "I couldn't leave
now. I've got a baby buried here. It's a mighty hard way to come to
love a country...to lose something in it. Mercy, put a railing
round that grave. I have not been of much use, I know, and it's
hurt me to see you work the way you've done. It will be better when
I can get up and do what I can do."</p>

<p>John Mercy bent down and kissed his wife, and suddenly in young
Tom the embarrassment became intolerable, for this was a thing he
had never seen his people do before, and a thing he was to see
again only twice so long as they lived. He pulled back and let the
canvas fall into place; he thought he heard his father crying. He
walked by the big kettle with its remaining chunks of fried venison
steak. He took one, eating it like a piece of bread. Caroline and
Mary Teal were now at the back end of the wagon, looking at
him.</p>

<p>He said, "I know a big cave up on the hill."</p>

<p>Mary Teal came from the wagon, Caroline following; and the three
walked into the woods, into the great sea swells of sound poured
out by the rolling timber crowns. Mary gave him a sharp sidewise
glance and smiled, destroying the strangeness between them and
giving him a mighty feeling of comfort. The long, long years were
beginning for Tom Mercy, and he was to see that smile so many times
again in the course of his life, to be warmed and drawn on by it,
to see tears shining through it, and broken thoughts hidden by it.
To the last day of his life far out in another century, that
smile&mdash;real or long after remembered&mdash;was his star, but
like a star, there was a greater heat within it than he was ever to
feel or to know.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. No Time for Dreams</h2>

<p>Katherine turned the wheat out of the lye water, washed it
carefully six times, and poured it into the iron kettle over the
fire; that was supper&mdash;the entire supper. A woolly November
rain rolled through the giant firs around her and crusted her cloak
with its sparkling beads as she ran toward her wagon. She paused a
moment to call up to the Rowley wagon, inside which Mrs. Rowley lay
sick with a cold.</p>

<p>"Ella, the wheat's on to boil! I'll watch! Don't get up!"</p>

<p>She climbed the high seat of her own wagon and got beneath the
shelter of the canvas stretched over its bows. This was her home,
and had been since leaving Independence, Missouri, five months and
twenty-three days before. Her mattress and comforters lay in a
corner opposite her mother's lowboy; everything else&mdash;the
trunks and boxes, the dishes in their barrels, the farm tools, the
seedling fruit switches bedded in dirt boxes&mdash;were closely
packed around her. She got out her father's writing box, lighted a
candle, and went on with the letter she had been composing for so
long a time for her married sister in the East:</p>

<p class="letter">...Everything went well until we got to the
crossing of the Platte. Then cholera came. Mother took it first,
father next. George and Saul died last. They're buried not far from
the river, but you and I will never find their graves. The Rowleys
were kind&mdash;they took me in. We kept the wagon, and a young man
in the party helped me with the oxen. His name is Ben McLane and he
reminds me of Saul. He's that tall and has red hair almost like
Saul's.<br>
<br>
We're camped in the trees behind Portland village. Half the train
turned off at Fort Hall for California. Most of the rest went south
from Oregon City into the Willamette. We're just ten wagons left.
The men are all out in a valley beyond here to see what land can be
had. I don't know what I'll do yet. The Rowleys are poor and I'm
one more mouth to feed. There's not six dollars in all ten
families. Maybe you think I ought to feel sadder than I sound.
Well, I have cried, but out here you can't cry long. Maybe someday
when other things are done, I'll cry again.</p>

<p>The men were returning, riding or walking the thick mud trail
through the trees toward the wagons parked in the forest gloom. Ben
McLane went on to the fire and crouched down against it. She
watched him through the round opening of the wagon canvas with an
attention so complete that it left no room for anything else in her
mind; and presently she climbed from the wagon and went over to the
fire to stir the wheat in the kettle. He looked up to her. The long
ride in the rain had chilled him and he seemed low of spirits. He
was a tall boy with big hands and long arms and a smooth, usually
cheerful face.</p>

<p>"Land in the Tualatin's all taken up," he said. "We've decided
to go down the valley a hundred miles or so. They say it's open
there." His hair rolled back around his temples for want of
trimming and his lids crept together as he looked back into the
fire. He spread his hands to soak in the heat; steam rolled from
his shirt.</p>

<p>Other fires were springing up through the shadows as these
families made their supper. She laid her hands quietly together,
remembering the things she and Ben had talked about on the long
ride across the desert, and she searched her mind for some single
hint that he thought about her as she thought about him. Nothing
came out of her memory. He was a quiet man, and she was quiet, too,
and had no way of making him see.</p>

<p>A sudden impulse gave her courage for a moment, and she decided
she would smile at him in a warmer way. She would push herself that
far because it was important, because time grew short and she
couldn't live on hope forever. In a little while the silence caused
him to look up to her, and she gave him the smile, inwardly praying
he would be interested; he watched her a moment, not seeing what
was in her mind, and by that she knew he had no great interest in
her. She turned back to the wagon and laid the writing box across
her lap. She had known it would end this way; her hope had been
foolish.</p>

<p class="letter">The men have come back and the wagons will go
south in the morning. I shall not go. The Rowleys are too poor, and
I have been on their kindness long enough. I talked to a woman in
the village today. Her husband runs the store and she boards single
men. I think I can work there. It is a hard thing to part with
people. I shall never see any of them any more.<br>
<br>
It is such a lonely world tonight.</p>

<p>She sealed the letter, addressed it, and left the wagon with her
cloak drawn around her. A few men had come to the Rowley fire to
join Rowley and Ben McLane.</p>

<p>As she went by them, Rowley said, "Where you goin',
Katherine?"</p>

<p>"To the store," she said.</p>

<p>Ben McLane's glance came over to her, and for a moment she
thought he might rise and walk with her. She looked at him until
she knew she could no longer let the moment drag on, and turned
away, following the trail through the woods to the village with its
two dozen houses scattered beside the big river.</p>

<p>Spicer's store was a long building of squared logs in whose
windows a yellow light glowed against the wholly dark night. The
sudden fragrance of supper came upon her when she stepped inside. A
great whale-oil lamp hung over a serious man who was working out
some last-minute account in his ledger; he looked up at her and
murmured, "Wife's in the kitchen and wants to see you," and
returned to his calculations.</p>

<p>She walked to the kitchen door and found Mrs. Spicer turning a
pan of biscuits onto a plate. Mrs. Spicer was a tall, tired,
once-pretty woman with a mouth pressed together.</p>

<p>"You're back," she said to Katherine. "You've decided on
it?"</p>

<p>"I'll be here as soon as the wagons leave in the morning."</p>

<p>Mrs. Spicer said, "If I take you, will you promise to stay a
year?"</p>

<p>Katherine gave the question serious thought. If she made a
promise, it had to be kept. The biscuits meanwhile were growing
cold; she picked up the plate and carried it to the dining
room&mdash;to the bachelors' table of young men making their way in
this settlement&mdash;and laid the biscuits before a blond lad at
the table's foot. The blond lad looked at her with his quiet
interest, and a liveliness came upon the nine other young men. She
turned back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll stay," she said to Mrs. Spicer. "I'll come in the
morning."</p>

<p>She returned through the weeping woods to find the men all
gathered around the Rowley fire for a talk. She went to the Rowley
wagon and got into it to tell Mrs. Rowley. Mrs. Rowley said, "Oh,
Katherine, what'll we do without you?" But somewhere on this
woman's kind face was a fleeting bit of relief; to Mrs. Rowley it
meant one less mouth to feed. Going to her own wagon, Katherine got
into bed and lay long awake; dampness made the blankets sticky, and
dampness was a powdered wetness in the air around her. Hope was
hard to kill, for even though she knew it was foolish, she tried to
frame a last message that would reach out to Ben McLane. Long
afterwards she fell asleep.</p>

<p>She rose at the first sound of men shouting at the oxen in the
darkness. The wagons were hitched, breakfast was eaten and the
children stowed away. Mrs. Rowley hugged her, climbed to the seat
and burst into tears. Standing by the fire, Katherine watched the
big cumbersome wagons swing into line and slowly roll away. She
waved at the Rowleys, but she had her eyes on Ben McLane, who rode
beside the column on his horse. His good-by to her had been a few
words quietly spoken. She watched his tall body fade into the
forest gloom and she pressed her mouth together, and a bitter
loneliness came to her, and she tried to memorize how he looked
before he faded from her sight; for she had liked him and would
have married him, and now would see him no more. As soon as the
caravan disappeared, she went to her own wagon and drove to the
village.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
She sold the oxen and the wagon, stored the family goods in an
empty log house at the edge of the village; heeled the seedling
trees into a sandy patch hard by the river. Mrs. Spicer wondered
why Katherine should take the trouble to do this; in Mrs. Spicer's
hard work life, time was precious and not to be spent on
unnecessary things.</p>

<p>"No," said Katherine, "I mean to plant them someday on a place
of my own, and when they grow up, I'll think of my people."</p>

<p>"It's a hard thing to lose your people," said Mrs. Spicer.</p>

<p>"Hard things happen," said Katherine.</p>

<p>Two days after Katherine came, Mrs. Spicer took to her bed, at
last able to afford the luxury of being sick. Katherine rose at
five, combed her hair in the cold corner room, lighted the fires
and got the breakfast for the boarders. She did the housework in
the gray forenoons, planned dinner and cooked and served it. Around
two o'clock she had an hour for herself and, with her sewing, she
kept Mrs. Spicer company; at four she was again in the kitchen,
making up supper. She washed, she baked, she scrubbed the puncheon
floors, which grew so dirty from the muddy feet of men. She mended
Spicer's shirts, she darned socks for Abbott Corning, who was
Spicer's clerk&mdash;that blond young man she had noticed at the
foot of the table on her first day. All days were long and it was
never much before eleven when she closed the door of her room,
braided up her hair and lay a moment wide-awake, to think of all
that had happened, to remember her people, and to bring close to
her the image of Ben McLane. She heard his voice, she saw him on
the big wagon beside her and she saw his broad back fading away
through the trees, and always at that point the room was a silent,
lonely place and sadness lay as a lump within her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spicer, catching up on her rest, at last had time to
consider other people, and spoke to Katherine. "You needn't work so
hard. Don't be a drudge like me. Anyhow, I'll be up pretty
soon."</p>

<p>Katherine showed Mrs. Spicer a smile. "I'd not hurry. Let your
men miss you a while longer."</p>

<p>"They do take things for granted," said Mrs.
Spicer..."Katherine, what's ahead for you? What's in your busy
mind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll get married."</p>

<p>"It won't be hard to do," said Mrs. Spicer dryly. "The country's
full of men. I could name six now that will be askin' you sooner or
later. You've got your choice."</p>

<p>Katherine looked away from Mrs. Spicer, out through the window
into the steady mists of winter's rain. Her face took on its
expression of wonder. "It's not the wanting of many men that
counts," she said. "It's the one man who doesn't want."</p>

<p>"Was there a man in that wagon train?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Katherine.</p>

<p>"What was he like?"</p>

<p>"He's big and red-haired, like my brother Saul. Ben's his name.
He'll be a farmer somewhere."</p>

<p>"Nothing was said between you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no."</p>

<p>Mrs. Spicer looked directly at the ceiling. Her glance went
through it, away from this village to a place far off from here and
to a time in the past. "Katherine," she murmured, "there've been a
lot of women with Bens to remember." She soon brought herself back,
her face resuming its fretful impatience. "But you've certainly got
your choice now."</p>

<p>She certainly had, for all the young men at the table were
single and had venturesome eyes. They were foot-loose ones who had
crossed the plains or jumped the sailing ships which touched here.
Four were woodcutters, three were hunters, one was a surveyor, one
a pony-express messenger, and one was Abbott Corning. He was the
quietest of the lot, and the one who already had found his opening.
He had begun a log house across from Spicer's and worked on it
after hours; it was to be his own store.</p>

<p>"I have got a consignment of goods coming around the Horn on the
<i>Sea Witch</i> next spring," he told Katherine.</p>

<p>"Won't you be trading against Mr. Spicer?"</p>

<p>"No, he's general merchandise, and I'll be hardware."</p>

<p>He, least of the young group, seemed to want to catch her
attention; yet it was he who walked with her on a clear Sunday to
the log house at the edge of the settlement and helped her unpack
the trunks and air out her people's things. He was from
Massachusetts, with a bit of twang in his voice and an agreeable
coolness of manner. He was methodical, he was courteous&mdash;and
now and then she noticed a far-off shining of repressed humor in
his eyes.</p>

<p>When they were finished with the airing he strolled toward the
river with her to have a look at the heeled-in fruit whips. He put
his hands behind his back while he studied the plants; then he
looked up at her, and she saw that he had been touched.</p>

<p>"You've not had it easy. We're a long way from home and it's not
good to be alone. Those would make a nice orchard behind a house.
What's your last name, Katherine?"</p>

<p>"Millison."</p>

<p>He had taken off his hat, either as a deliberate thing or as an
unconscious gesture. It gave her a moment of warmth&mdash;it was an
understanding he seemed to share with her.</p>

<p>That same feeling came again a little later when he opened a
twenty-pound mat of rough sugar from the Sandwich Islands and found
a colony of mice living within. He was on the point of throwing the
sugar away, but she took it and boiled it out in a kettle and made
it into sirup. "Now," he said, "that's practical." In the morning
when she served some of the sirup with hot cakes, he grinned at her
and nodded toward the other men at the table. "They don't know how
good this is, do they?" The understanding moved between them again
with its nice feeling.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spicer noticed it, and watched the two through the days,
and was thoughtful and more than usually short with her husband.
She said nothing to Katherine until she found the girl standing at
the store's doorway, looking toward the hills.</p>

<p>"Katherine," she said, "you got a hope maybe Ben will come
back?"</p>

<p>"I guess I have," said the girl. "It's a foolish thing."</p>

<p>"He ever know you had him on your mind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Katherine. "I never showed it." She shrugged her
shoulders. "It's just a thing I can't have. People have got to make
the best of what comes."</p>

<p>"You're a firm girl," said Mrs. Spicer. She stood beside
Katherine, staring at the homely village and its street of churned
mud and its gloomy forest crowding down. A sudden dead hatred came
to her face. "Sometimes it's almost too much."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Winter settled over the two dozen houses of the village. The hard
rains slashed down, turning the street into a quagmire, and the sun
came out and steam rose from the forest as though it were afire.
These dark evenings Abbott Corning planed out his boards and built
his shelves and his counters and sealed in the back room, which was
to be living quarters. Seldom did he quit before midnight and,
remembering the raw chill of that empty building, Katherine got in
the habit of taking coffee to him.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when he put aside his hammer, his weariness made him
appear old, but another time, on the day the building was finished,
she saw a different side. The young bachelors chose to christen the
place with the blue ruin which sold along the river at two dollars
the gallon. She was in the kitchen, long past midnight, when he
came into Spicer's. He walked down the store aisle with an
exaggerated care and halted in the kitchen's doorway. His beaver
hat sat angled on his bright blond hair and his eyes were young and
sparking with venture. He removed his hat and made his bow, and he
looked at her in the way that was new, and strong with personal
interest.</p>

<p>"Katherine," he said, "I have got a store. There's nothing in it
yet, but I have got it. I'm not a fool often, but I get to thinking
sometimes the fools have the best of it. Every board I planed and
cut and doweled down, every board came out of time I could have
been sleeping or fishing on the river. I thought I'd be a fool for
once. Have I done wrong?" He was laughing as he said it, but he was
anxious about it, too, and watched her pour coffee for him, and
took the cup obediently.</p>

<p>"It's nice to be free once in a while," she said. "I'm glad you
did. You drink that and you'll not feel bad tomorrow."</p>

<p>He drank it and smiled at her. "You ought not be so troubled,
Katherine, and I ought not be so dull."</p>

<p>"I'll laugh someday, like you're laughing now," she said. "And
you're not dull at all." She took him by the arm and led him over
the store to his room.</p>

<p>He stood by his bed with the strong admiration in his eyes, but
even then she knew she had nothing to fear from him. She gave him a
small push. He fell back on the bed and he lay there, his hair
tousled and his eyes closed. "It's been satisfactory," he murmured.
"I'll never be an old man with a skullcap and muttonchop
whiskers."</p>

<p>On the third of April, the bark <i>Sea Witch</i> worked up the
river to tie at the bluff with Abbott Corning's consignment of
goods from Boston. He hired the bachelors to move the cargo into
his store, and on another night, a week later, he brought a sign
out of a hiding place&mdash;a white shingle blackly lettered:
CORNING &amp; CO. HARDWARE, TIN GOODS, CROCKERY, MINERS' SUPPLIES,
LEATHER. He went into the dark street and hung it to the waiting
bracket over the doorway and came back. A rainy wind rushed over
the town and the shingle began to squeak in its metal eyes. He put
his hands into his trousers pockets and stood before her. He was
quiet, he was happy.</p>

<p>"I shall open this door in the morning. I hope to open it, the
same key in the same lock, as long as I'm alive." He jingled the
coins in his pocket, he smiled, he settled his shoulders. "I am
twenty-three years old and I owe twenty thousand dollars on this
stock. My health is good. I am ambitious. I can be trusted. I am
not a lively man." The smiling dissolved into great seriousness. "I
would be happy if you saw fit to trust me, as others have done...if
you'd make the venture with me...if you'd be my wife."</p>

<p>She had one terrible moment of indecision, of something like
panic. She crowded it down and smiled at him. "Yes," she said.</p>

<p>The answer brought him embarrassment, for he wanted to kiss her
and scarcely knew how to go about it. She lifted her head and made
a slight motion with her hands, breaking his uncertainty, and he
put his arms around her and gave her a soft kiss and stepped away.
He was smiling and confused. "I've never done that before. I guess
there's a lot of things I've never done." The deep-hidden New
England humor began to sparkle in his eyes and the knowledge of his
luck began to work slowly at him, building up his buoyancy. "Now,
then, we've got to tell the Spicers."</p>

<p>"I don't know what Mrs. Spicer will say. I promised to work a
year for her."</p>

<p>"She's a good woman." Then he added in the considerate tone so
characteristic of him: "If she won't release you from the promise,
we'll have to wait, of course."</p>

<p>They found the Spicers in the kitchen; he was reading, and she
knitting. Mrs. Spicer's glance searched them and her mouth settled
with the thought that came to her. She laid her hands in her lap.
"Spicer," she said, and when he lifted his attention from the
paper, she nodded at the two younger people. Spicer looked around
at them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Spicer," said Abbott Corning, "I'll be opening shop in the
morning. I've not said this before, but I remember your kindness.
Yours and Mrs. Spicer's. Now then..."</p>

<p>He looked at Katherine. "Is it the man or the woman who's
supposed to say this?"</p>

<p>"It's plain on both of you," said Mrs. Spicer. "It needs no more
saying."</p>

<p>"Well, now, that's good," said Spicer, and rose to extend his
hand to both of them.</p>

<p>"Spicer," said Mrs. Spicer, "take Abbott out a moment."</p>

<p>She closed the kitchen door after the two men left. She wasn't
pleased, Katherine thought. But it really wasn't displeasure so
much as it was a fretfulness that gave her face an unhappier look.
"Katherine, are you sure Ben won't come back? He might, mightn't
he?"</p>

<p>"There's no use thinking about that."</p>

<p>"You still hope for it, don't you?" pressed Mrs. Spicer.</p>

<p>Katherine shook her head. "Maybe, in a little way, I do. But I
know it's wrong. It's not practical. People have got to do the best
they can, and not grieve over dreams. If they waited for their
hopes to work out, nothing would get done and we'd all waste our
lives. Maybe I'm a little bit sad, but I can get over it." She
paused, still troubled by something in her mind. Then she said, "I
have got to tell Abbott about Ben...before we're married."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Mrs. Spicer, and watched Katherine with her
insistent attention.</p>

<p>"It's important. He's got to know. That's fair."</p>

<p>"Katherine," said Mrs. Spicer, "I'm going to make you keep your
promise. You've got to finish out your year with me."</p>

<p>"Why, then," said Katherine, "I shall. Abbott and I can
wait."</p>

<p>She left the room, and presently Spicer came back and settled in
his chair again to finish his newspaper. Mrs. Spicer stood at the
kitchen window, staring through the pane to a night she couldn't
see; and though Spicer was an incurious man he finally became aware
of her silence and looked up from his paper.</p>

<p>"Something not right?"</p>

<p>She was short with her answer. "Right or wrong, what's the
difference?"</p>

<p>"You get thinking spells, Nelly. What do you think about?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," she said, and continued to look through the
window.</p>

<p>Spring came with its warm rains and its sudden bright suns
shining through an air washed clean. The pale greens of new growth
made a lacework pattern against the dark greens of the land. The
river lifted and turned yellow from the mud of caved-in banks; the
pathways of the village sent up their thin steam as they grew dry.
Abbott Corning built a shed at the back end of his store lot and
bought a cow; early in the morning he milked it and drove it to a
pasture out near the Terwilliger claim, and near suppertime he
drove it back. He had left Mrs. Spicer's table.</p>

<p>"I could afford the board money," he told Katherine, "but I've
got a debt to pay to the merchants in the East who trusted me. So
it's better that I batch, though I do miss your cooking."</p>

<p>It became her habit then, on Sundays, to go to his store and
bake his bread and&mdash;knowing his liking for sweet
things&mdash;a large cake with a butter frosting. On one such
Sunday he hired a wagon and moved her packed things from the log
cabin to the drier loft of his store.</p>

<p>"Maybe it will bring your family closer," he said. "You're the
sort to remember your people. You got a long memory. I can see it
in your eyes most any time."</p>

<p>She almost told him of Ben, but the impulse wavered and she
postponed the ordeal. "It's a nice thing for you to take the space
for my trunks," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, you don't ask much of anybody. I wish you ask more."</p>

<p>"I don't need much," she said.</p>

<p>He smiled at her. "You need whatever you'd want to ask for, and
it would be my pleasure to supply it." He was embarrassed by the
warmth of the statement. He looked down to the floor, softly
adding, "Maybe I shouldn't trouble you with my feelings."</p>

<p>She touched his arm. "Abbott, I'll try hard to make things go
well for us."</p>

<p>He said, "We've got six months to wait. I ought not grow
impatient, but I do."</p>

<p>It was her turn to grow self-conscious, so much so that when
they walked back to Spicer's she was glad to be in the shadows of
the warm spring night. The bells of pastured cows rang gently and
intermittently from the village edge and house lights seemed more
than usually yellow in their shining. She stood a moment at
Spicer's doorway, waiting for whatever he wished to say; but
instead of speaking, he looked down to her with his quietness
disturbed by the clear-shown impulse to kiss her. She said, "Good
night," and turned quickly into the store.</p>

<p>She knew that was wrong and stood at her window to reason away
the memories of Ben McLane which came without her permission. These
would someday fade out, and then she'd smile at her foolishness,
but it took so long a time. He was still important to her, and
because he was important to her, she had to let him know. Sunday
she'd do it.</p>

<p>She meant, on Sunday, to go to his store after breakfast work
was done; instead he came to her.</p>

<p>"Day's fine," he said. "Northwest wind's blowing. Thought you
might like to walk. The trails are dry up along the hill."</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "we'll take a lunch. I've never been up that
hill." She rummaged a meal from the kitchen and packed it in a
muslin sack and borrowed a pot for coffee. They went by Spicer's
store, where he stopped for a blanket, and then struck away from
the town into the timber.</p>

<p>Though she had been in the village six months, she had never
gone back to the little clearing in the timber where the emigrant
wagons had camped; and when she came to it, she stopped and for a
moment the picture came up full and strong of that wet morning, the
wagons rolling away, and Mrs. Rowley crying, and Ben McLane
disappearing into the shadows. She looked down at the round dark
place where the fire had been. The taste of boiled wheat returned
to her. Everything returned with its original sharpness.</p>

<p>"You're thinking again," said Abbott Corning. "It's like soot in
your eyes."</p>

<p>"It's sad to think of people all scattered&mdash;the ones I knew
so well."</p>

<p>"Well," said Abbott Corning, "it's a country for scattering. But
it's a country for starting, and for coming together too. It's a
good thing we're so busy out here that we've not got much time to
think of the past."</p>

<p>"I've not had time yet to cry for my people," said
Katherine.</p>

<p>"It was a bad thing," he said, his sympathy strong in his
words.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
They reached the mouth of a canyon whose damp wild breath came
downward to them; they found a trail along the hill's stiff slope,
through masses of great fir trees. Wet rock faces glistened in the
shadows and the fallen needles of a thousand years' accumulation
made a carpet that gave with their weight. Near noon they came to a
grassy summit at the peak of these hills and saw the land run away
westward&mdash;black forest and green meadow and swelling domes of
hills&mdash;until the massive wall of the Cascades rose up to top
the eye. Directly below them the river flashed and turned its great
loop, northward moving; beside the river was the small scar of
Portland village.</p>

<p>They spread the blanket, made a fire to cook coffee, and had
their lunch. Abbott Corning lay back with his sigh of fullest
satisfaction, his eyes watching the fair sky. "I am a horse turned
out for a day, and that's a good feeling."</p>

<p>"You work hard, Abbott. You keep long hours."</p>

<p>"I'm a slow man, and long hours don't hurt me. I'll never be
great, Katherine, but I will be useful, and in time we ought to be
well-fixed."</p>

<p>"You ought not speak of yourself so humbly."</p>

<p>"I couldn't fool myself," he said. "I do admit that I have a
business head. I do admit one other thing: I was a lonely man till
I met you."</p>

<p>She knew this was the time to speak, but, looking at the
contentment upon him, she could not bring herself to it. It struck
her in the heart. She looked out upon the far mountains, telling
herself that she would do it on the homeward walk.</p>

<p>"Abbott," she said, "you need more crockery in your stock at the
store."</p>

<p>"It is not a day to think business," he said, and rose with a
thought amusing him. "Now come look with me." She followed him to
the break of the hill and sighted along his arm as he pointed
toward the village. "See that little open spot beyond the
Terwilligers', but short of the village? It is an acre, more or
less, and five minutes' walk from the store. I have bought it. I
should not have bought it without your seeing it, but the price was
not much."</p>

<p>"It's your judgment," she said, and was warmed by his wanting to
share the decision with her. "I see it. What's it for?"</p>

<p>"When the village gets larger," he said, "we'll not want to live
in back of the store. We'll want a house which is not on the main
street."</p>

<p>She said, "That will be a good thing. Is there a sunny place for
a garden?"</p>

<p>"You'll see," he said, and picked up the blanket and muslin
sack. The secret amusement continued to bubble up and leave its
impression on his face, and now and then he gave her a sly look.
"It may please you," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't need to be pleased more than I am now."</p>

<p>"I wish you did," he said, and was wistful with his tone.</p>

<p>She said, very quickly, "I don't mean to be indifferent, Abbott.
I'm not."</p>

<p>He went chuckling down the trail with her. They reached the
canyon and walked toward town; when they were within a few minutes
of it, Abbott Corning followed another trail into a grove of trees
which soon began to thin out before a little meadow. "Now, then,"
he said, taking her hand, "will you close your eyes and let me
bring you to it?"</p>

<p>He went before her and reached the clearing, and stopped in it.
"If you like this," he said, "I'll be satisfied."</p>

<p>She opened her eyes to see the acre lying within the border of
roundabout firs. A small creek crossed the clearing, wandering as
it went; toward the middle of the acre stood three small cedars.
This much she saw at first glance, and then her glance went beyond
the cedars to a corner of the acre and discovered the plowed corner
in which her father's seedling trees stood in their rows, one day
to be an orchard.</p>

<p>He said, "I moved these at night, when you wouldn't notice. I
hope I didn't do wrong. The house will sit by the cedars. You can
look out of the window to the orchard, and there's your people with
you, Katherine."</p>

<p>She turned to see the smiling gone from him completely. He was
once more a sober man holding his hat in his hand, watching her
with his hope for her happiness. She said, "Abbott," and began to
cry. She tried to stop it by pressing her palms tightly against her
eyes, but he reached up and pulled them aside and put his arms
around her. He didn't say anything; he held her while she cried,
his head touching the top of her head. All her restraint gave way
before the pressure so long accumulated. She laid her arms on his
shoulders to steady herself, and poured out everything bitter and
regretful, and ceased to cry, and remained long still. He patted
her slowly and lightly on the back; he waited, still without
words.</p>

<p>She drew away and raised a reddened face to him, then realized
how she looked, and turned aside to use her fingers to press away
the tears. She kept her back to him, looking toward the nursery
rows. "Well, Abbott, now I've cried for my people and I guess I'm
done with it. I've been a sorrowful girl, but that's past."</p>

<p>He said, "I didn't do wrong, then?"</p>

<p>"No, Abbott. It was right."</p>

<p>He took her arm and walked back through the pathway and through
the timber to the village. When they got to the door he stepped
aside to let her go ahead of him. She stopped in the front room,
but he went on to the rear with the blanket and left it and came
back. He was restless and embarrassed, and he went by her and
paused at the window, rattling the silver in his pocket. Suddenly
he turned and stood in front of her with something of the
expression she had noticed the night he had christened the
building&mdash;the rash sparkling in his eyes, the boyishness, the
close personal interest.</p>

<p>"Katherine," he said, "I'm not patient about waiting six
months."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Spicer&mdash;"</p>

<p>He touched her arm, and hesitated, and pulled her forward. "No,"
he said, "it's a long time," and he kissed her with the driving
impatience of a man in love.</p>

<p>It wasn't like his first kiss; it wasn't tender and embarrassed
and unsure. He wanted her, and this possessiveness went around her
like a heavy arm. She drew her head back, staring up to him; her
lips softened from the knowledge of his wanting. She dropped her
glance, smiling and unsteady.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Abbott," she said, "we must go see her."</p>

<p>"Now," he said. They crossed to Spicer's, and went through the
front room, passing Spicer, who looked up with his incurious
mildness. Mrs. Spicer was at the kitchen stove. She heard them, but
some perversity made her delay turning around. When she did turn,
with a wearied resentment on her face, she saw the pleasure in
Katherine's eyes at once. She saw the change, and a loosening came
immediately to those drawn cheeks; a kindness warmed her eyes.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Spicer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't need to tell anybody," said Mrs. Spicer, "you've
found a man."</p>

<p>"I found him a long time ago."</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Spicer, "you found him today." She looked at
Katherine with her private message. She said, "Have you said what
you thought you would say to him?"</p>

<p>"No," said Katherine. "It's not important. If it were important,
I would. But it isn't at all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Spicer turned to the stove. She opened the oven door and
stooped to haul out a pan. "Well, then, I shan't keep you to a
promise. You're sure it's all right?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Katherine, "it's all right. I'll be back in a
little while to help with supper. I'll help as long as I can. I'll
be close enough, even married."</p>

<p>"That's fine," said Mrs. Spicer, and went on with her work. She
listened to the girl's steps and the man's steps go on to the
store, and presently she straightened and stopped her work. There
were tears in her eyes and she thought, <i>Sometimes it happens.
Sometimes it's good like this.</i> She looked across the kitchen
and out through the window, and for a little while she was quite
still, with her thoughts far off and far back. She shook her head
to clear her eyes, and turned to the stove.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. Cry Deep, Cry Still</h2>

<p>At four o'clock that morning when John Mercy rose to search out
and yoke the oxen, it was a mud-black world. The scudding clouds of
a southwest storm were breaking in violence against the hills and
releasing a fat rain which searched through the cabin walls and
became a humid sweat upon everything. Today would be only a sullen,
end-of-the-world twilight, as yesterday had been, and for as many
days back as Mrs. Mercy cared to remember.</p>

<p>Mercy returned for breakfast, the heat of the room dyeing his
wind-stung cheeks to blood crimson. He said brief grace and looked
about the table, to his wife Martha, to Caroline in her flannel
nightgown, to young Tom still drugged with sleep. "The devil's
crying at the eaves but he can't get in." The hard work of a first
fall in Oregon, the laying up of the cabin and the breaking of
land, had taken twenty pounds from him, but he was cheerful, his
eyes as blue as old velvet. "I'll let Tom milk and fetch water. It
will save me an hour. It's a slow sixty miles each way, the Yamhill
and the Tualatin to ford. They'll be high."</p>

<p>"You can't ford the Willamette or the Columbia," Mrs. Mercy
said. "What'll you do?"</p>

<p>"At the Willamette's mouth I'll find some Indians to canoe me to
the fort."</p>

<p>"And leave wagon and beasts for them to steal."</p>

<p>"I don't contemplate it," he said. "Eight days ought to see me
back here."</p>

<p>"How can those pawky little canoes carry you, two mill-stones
and a barrel of flour? You'll sink. What would we do, left three
alone out here two thousand miles from home?"</p>

<p>"Don't contemplate that either," he said. He rose and made slow
work buttoning on his overcoat while he watched his wife. "You'll
be all right?"</p>

<p>"Worry for yourself."</p>

<p>"It might be nine days instead of eight," John Mercy said.</p>

<p>"If you see anybody along the way that we came over the plains
with&mdash;though that would be like finding a penny in the
ocean&mdash;tell them hello and say we're doing well."</p>

<p>"So we are," he said agreeably.</p>

<p>"Just say it," she retorted.</p>

<p>He went about the table to kiss the top of his daughter's head.
He said, "Magpie for sharp," and he nodded at his son. "Do the
chores without being asked and cause your mother no worry. You're
the man here." He took up the sack of food and moved to the door,
but there he swung to give his wife a grave moment's look.</p>

<p>She was aware of it and suddenly fell briskly to her chores
about the fireplace, ignoring him. She said, "Well, you'd better
get started," and then noticed the mud he'd brought into the house
with his shoes. "Dirt, dirt, I'll die of it." He looked at her but
said nothing, and went into the darkness.</p>

<p>Wind rushed past him with its fat, stinging rain. He threw the
food into the wagon and walked abreast the oxen to prod them into
motion. "Hup, Dandy, Babe! Hup!" The beasts stirred the covered
wagon forward, into the meadow and across it toward a valley lying
blind in the night.</p>

<p>Fort Vancouver, toward which he was bound for millstones and
flour, was sixty miles northward through a country inhabited by
scarcely more than a hundred white people; this was December and
the year of 1842 came to its gusty ending in rain and wind. He bent
his head and trudged forward over the spongy soil...</p>

<p>After he was well gone, Martha Mercy opened the door to look
after him, sighting nothing now. She listened to the dashing roar
of the wind in the fir tops high over the cabin; the sound of it
drew her mouth into a displeased line and she closed the door and
walked to the fireplace, a young woman with a clear brown face
rarely lighted by a smile, with restless hands and a preoccupied
manner. "Tom," she said, "the cow can hook off that top rail of the
gate. You take a piece of rope and tie it."</p>

<p>The wind's rustling was endless, and she noted the glitter of
water seeping through the log spaces. She turned to frown at the
room: the beds and table and chairs cramping it, the boxes piled
over boxes, the extra bedding and furniture stored above the rafter
crosspieces, the crowded shelves, the clothing hanging from pegs
everywhere; she saw the mud near the door and it was a match
exploding her discontent, She seized the broom and went vigorously
around the room, under the beds and under the children's feet at
the table. Caroline said, "I want to dress now."</p>

<p>"Light the lantern, Tom. Put on the heavy coat."</p>

<p>She pulled the big kettle; with its simmering water, from the
crane and scalded the milk bucket. Bundled against the weather,
young Tom went out into the darkness and as soon as he had gone
Caroline changed from nightgown to clothes.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Martha Mercy got the comb, and stood back of the chair for half an
hour's patient combing of the girl's hair, forming its exact part,
braiding it and tying the braids. Momentarily, she was pleased.
Caroline was pretty.</p>

<p>"Now, then, if you're sharp as a magpie, as your father says, do
the dishes," Martha said.</p>

<p>She went to the shed and carried in the full pans of another
day's milk, took off the cream and dumped the skim into a bucket
for the pigs; she scalded the pans and filled them with the fresh
milk young Tom brought in. Young Tom went slowly out to feed the
pigs, a first light then creeping like dirty water into the
morning. She thought: <i>He's tired for some reason,</i> and began
to worry about him; he never had Caroline's bubbling health. She
put on her big cloak and tied a scarf around her head. From the
shed she got an armload of pitch wood and stove sticks and carried
them to the outdoor fireplace. She laid the pitch wood, brought a
bucket of coals from the cabin and got the fire going, the variable
currents of wind throwing smoke into her face. When the fire was
strong she hoisted a great iron scalding pot and lodged it on the
rock ledge above the flame and took a bucket behind the cabin.</p>

<p>A barrel stood here on stilts, a tub beneath it. Fire ashes
filled the barrel, the rain washed through the ashes, and lye water
trickled into the tub; she made three trips from tub to kettle with
the lye water, then got an egg from the house and dropped it in the
lye water for a test. The egg floated, its end barely above
surface. Out of the cabin she brought the grease saved from
butchered deer, from two bears Mercy had shot, from bacon
drippings. This went into the kettle with the lye water.</p>

<p>She fed the fire and stepped into the cabin, the lower half of
her dress and her shoes sodden. The dishes were done, and Caroline
stood dreaming at the fire.</p>

<p>"You take your book and go through your letters," said Mrs.
Mercy.</p>

<p>"I'd rather make soap."</p>

<p>"You'll get to make it someday," said Mrs. Mercy, "and wish you
didn't need to." She put on Mercy's extra pair of boots, her feet
entirely lost within them, and returned to the kettle to find that
the inslanting rain had dampened the fire. She brought more pitch
kindling and chunks of dry fir bark from the shed. Tom watched her.
She said, "Tom, take the milk clabber to the chickens. Count and
see if they're all there&mdash;and get the eggs."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
She fed the fire with wood standing ricked by the shelter, the
sharp smoke making her cry. The morning moved on, such as it was.
The plowed field beyond the foot of the hill&mdash;where winter
wheat lay&mdash;was black as coal from its month long soaking;
sullen clouds skimmed the earth and lodged in the timber so heavily
that a fine fog sparked all about her. Young Tom returned from the
chicken shed and ducked into the shelter of the cabin's doorway.
"Six eggs, chickens all right." His face was solemn, his shoulders
drawn up.</p>

<p>Trying to imitate his father, she thought, but she looked
closely at him, not quite sure; this was the way he sometimes
appeared just before coming down with a cold. She said, "Take the
ax and go strip me some cedar bark, about this long." She spread
her arms to indicate the length. "A lot of it."</p>

<p>"You'll kill the trees."</p>

<p>"We've got trees to kill," she said.</p>

<p>At noon the soap was half thick in the kettle, young Tom had
stacked a pile of cedar bark in the back shed, and both of them
were soaked. She made a meal of cold scraps and fried eggs and
sassafras tea, immediately going back to the tedious chore at the
fire. By four o'clock the soap was a clear, clean jelly the color
of isinglass; she heard it splatter as it bubbled, and judged it
right, and drew it from the fire, ladling the soap into the wooden
tub. She stored the tub in the shed and returned to clean out the
kettle while a premature night whirled down about the cabin.</p>

<p>"Time for milking, Tom."</p>

<p>After supper a greater wind and rain rushed against the cabin
and stormed through the trees with the sound of a river cataract.
She put Tom to his arithmetic and took the lantern out to look at
the chickens huddled in their small house; still restless, she went
to the corral to make sure Tom had tied the top rail well enough.
To get anything in this country was very hard; to lose anything was
a tragedy.</p>

<p>She went on to the store shed, playing the lantern's light along
the shelves, over the salt crocks, the potatoes, cabbages and
apples and pumpkins given them by their nearest neighbors, the
Teals, four miles away. She brooded over the scantiness of the
bacon and the half-empty salt-pork tub; it was six months before
the garden came on or a hog could be killed, a close thing with
four mouths to feed. When she stepped into the cabin she saw young
Tom shiver and she knew that he was going to be sick.</p>

<p>"You go to bed."</p>

<p>She stood at the fire after both of them had settled for the
night and gave Mercy a moment's thought, he camped somewhere in a
dripping grove fifteen miles away; but he would be inside the wagon
cover and he would be warm. She drew the fire together, laid her
hand on young Tom's cheek, feeling no fever there yet, and snuffed
out the lights. "Turn your back," she said to him and got ready for
bed.</p>

<p>The firelight performed its golden, leaping dance on the walls.
They were both young, but work was making them old too fast, all
because Indiana had got too small for Mercy's notions and he wanted
a mile of land in Oregon and his own grist mill. The endless rain
was hard to bear, for it took her back to her home where the snow
now was a shining crust on the ground and the cold wonderful air
shook down the brown oak leaves, banking them in windrows against
the rail-fence lines. She saw the little town with its houses
spaced in their blocks, and the church bell's sound was strong in
her ears. Past Pennoyer's, Gregg's and Jackson's she walked,
rattling her knuckles against the fence pickets, over the packed
snow to Burglon's store, whose shelves were so common then and
seemed so rich now. Bob Burglon, learning the business from his
father, waited on her; she stirred on the bed and closed him from
her mind with effort.</p>

<p>Above the storm she heard a sound beginning, like the tearing of
cloth. It grew suddenly to a snapping and whining, and she sat
upright in terror and felt the cabin tremble&mdash;actually
jump&mdash;as the tree struck close by with its roar and its dying
shower of falling branches.</p>

<p>Caroline whimpered and young Tom woke and began to cough. She
listened to her heart's pounding; wind yelled through blackness,
and the blackness was heavier than lead. This was the hour when, no
matter how she tried to stop it, she thought of Allen Mercy, born
dead, lying inside the rail fence beyond the meadow. The blackness
and the wet cold earth brought the thought to her.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Early on the fourth day she rose to make broth from a piece of salt
meat simmered with potatoes and onions. On young Tom's waking she
fed him against his will, but stopped when she saw he could hold no
more down. Fever had cracked his lips, and his arms showed a first
thinness, and though he was sleepy he could only catnap. She got
Caroline's breakfast, took care of the milk and fed the chickens.
Using two water buckets at a time, she made four trips to the
creek, a hundred yards distant, to fill the water barrel in the
shed; on her return from the final trip she found Caroline in the
cabin's doorway, her eyes round as dollars.</p>

<p>"There's a dog. He went around back of the barn."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mercy dumped the water into the barrel. "There's no dog.
There's nobody but the trapper yonder and he's got no dog. The
Teals are across the river. It couldn't be their dog." Young Tom
was at the moment sleeping and she hated to disturb him, but his
face was so bright a red that she touched it with her hands.
"There's no dog," she said.</p>

<p>"I saw him, right in the yard. He went back of the barn."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mercy looked at her daughter, shaken by a dreadful
coldness. She pulled her into the cabin and closed the door and got
the rifle from its pegs; she found a cap for the rifle's nipple.
"Stay here till I come back and don't open the door." She let
herself into the yard and stopped to look through the gray light,
toward the meadow, toward the hills. She circled the house, half
afraid to turn the corners, going on to the cowshed.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be seen between cabin and shed, and beyond
the shed the trees cast a thick shadow. She swung to come straight
upon the open door, to see inside the cowshed before she got too
close to it; the cow stood forlornly there, disliking the rain. She
drew a long breath of relief and walked toward the far side of the
shed; before she got quite to its corner she caught sight of motion
in the darkness of the trees, and a long, sunken-flanked wolf came
silently into the clearing, saw her and stopped.</p>

<p>He was evilly thin, of a dirty, rusty gray, and his eyes were a
strange green staring at her with an unhuman steadiness; he had a
mind and he was thinking whether he should be afraid or whether he
should jump at her&mdash;that she knew in the paralyzing moment of
her stillness. She never thought of the gun in her hand, never
realized she had it. She said, "You dirty thing&mdash;get!"</p>

<p>The sound of her voice startled the wolf. He made an easy turn
of insolence and went shadowlike into the timber. Then she
remembered she had a gun, but he was gone. She ran to the shed,
seized a piece of rope and fixed it to the cow's halter, leading
the cow to the cabin door and tying it there. When she opened the
door, Caroline stood waiting.</p>

<p>"Where's the dog&mdash;why's the cow here?"</p>

<p>"If it was a dog, he might hurt the cow. I didn't see the
dog."</p>

<p>She rested the gun beside the door. "Don't touch that." She went
to the fire and rested her head against her hands to let the waves
of weakness go through her. Maybe he wouldn't come this near to the
house, but maybe he was hungry enough to dare; she had to leave the
door open to watch the cow. She turned, hearing Tom threshing on
the bed. He was awake but he looked at her in a strange way and she
knew the fever, still strong, made him lightheaded. It was more
than a cold and he was in danger. She laid her hand softly on his
chest, and he rolled his head, looking up to her with fear in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Am I going to die?"</p>

<p>"It's just a little thing. It's a cold. You've had colds
before."</p>

<p>She held him up for a drink of water, pulled the quilt over him
and briskly turned to her work. She made Caroline a bite to eat,
she scalded the churn, and brought the milk from the shed; seated
at the doorway, the churn between her legs and her eyes on the
yard, she worked the dasher up and down.</p>

<p>Down the meadow, a voice hailed the cabin, shocking her, and in
a moment Mrs. Teal, skirts dripping from a four-mile walk through
wet meadow grasses, appeared at the door; with her was the oldest
Teal boy, a basket in each arm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Teal said, "I missed your visit Sunday and got to
wonderin'."</p>

<p>"Mercy's away to Fort Vancouver." A great relief from loneliness
came upon Mrs. Mercy, so great that for an instant she was happy.
But she could not reveal to this woman her weakness; she showed
Mrs. Teal a steady face, and rose to accept the baskets with proper
thanks.</p>

<p>"Just some garden things," said Mrs. Teal. "They'll rot in our
storehouse, we've got so much. It'll be the same with you when your
garden's started. First year's always a hard thing&mdash;nothing to
do with." Mrs. Teal saw young Tom on the bed and walked over and
bent and looked at him. Her voice was quiet: "What's ailin'
him?"</p>

<p>"A cold," said Mrs. Mercy.</p>

<p>"If we just had some mustard for a plaster," said Mrs. Teal.
"There's never anything. I'll be happy when there's a store." She
looked again at young Tom, silently and long; she was worried,
Martha Mercy realized. The Teal boy stood beyond the doorway,
waiting.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mercy looked at young Tom and Caroline and spoke to Mrs.
Teal: "Maybe your son could take the gun and go look on the other
side of the cowshed. There's a dog around." She added quietly: "A
gray dog, Caroline thinks."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," murmured Mrs. Teal. "They do bother in winter when
they get hungry. Joe&mdash;" But Joe, reaching for the rifle, had
already gone. "Have you got any turpentine? On a rag soaked with
water, it would draw."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Mrs. Teal looked at her narrowly and lowered her voice: "You got
another baby started?" When Martha Mercy shook her head, the other
woman murmured, "Well, then it's weariness. You been up most of the
night, I guess. That's a terrible big tree that fell. Mercy better
clear more away. I'll leave Joe here to sleep in the shed tonight.
And to fetch me if you have need."</p>

<p>"It's a trouble for him."</p>

<p>"Great stars!" said Mrs. Teal. "What's people for? And there's
no need to stand off. Not out here. People have got to have each
other. Even if they don't like each other, they got to get along.
Well, it's soon dark and I'll go." She gave a last look to young
Tom and went into the yard, calling to her son. Joe Teal appeared
from the timber a moment, listened to his mother's words, and went
back into the timber, as lean and easy and insolent as the wolf
itself.</p>

<p>Martha Mercy sat down before the churn, lifting and lowering the
dasher in steady rhythm. Covertly from time to time Mrs. Mercy
threw a glance toward young Tom. The fever was growing, the
breaking point hadn't been reached. She kneaded the butter and took
it to the storehouse, poured buttermilk into a jug and brought
young Tom a glass of it; when she lifted him upright to drink she
felt the fiery heat of his body. He drank the full glass and fell
back on the bed, fretful and weak. She brought up the quilts around
him.</p>

<p>Darkness came down with a rising wind and rain. She made supper
for Caroline and for Joe Teal, who, coming out of the darkness, ate
as though in a haste to be back at his hunting. "I'll sleep in the
cowshed," he said, and took a blanket from her and led the cow
away. She ate nothing, having no appetite. She washed the dishes,
combed and put up Caroline's hair and sent her to bed.</p>

<p>"The light's in my eyes," said Tom.</p>

<p>She snuffed the candles and drew a chair beside young Tom's bed,
holding his hot hand. "Now, then," she said, "you'll be better in
the morning. This fever's about burned out the corruption, and then
it'll go and you'll eat like a pig." His breathing was fast and
heavy, the labor of it exhausting him; his heart alarmed her with
the violence of its pulsing against his skin.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
A terrible helplessness came upon her and out of it came bitter
thoughts and a moment of hatred for John Mercy. He was an ambitious
man who couldn't abide the thought of being small in
Indiana&mdash;believing that a mile of land, a mill and someday a
store out here would make them happy and leave the children well
off. But what good was that to young Tom now, half dead with fever?
It wasn't a healthy country, no freezing weather to kill the putrid
things in the earth and air each year, only this wetness which
sickened people and kept them damp winter long.</p>

<p>In sleep, young Tom cried. She sat in the slowly chilling room,
listening to the fever have its way, holding his hand and silently
praying her will into him. She feared to let his hand go and she
feared to move. Mercy, about now, would be starting back over a
country without roads or bridges; she had no tenderness in her
thinking of him, only a feeling that if young Tom should die, her
mind would die.</p>

<p>Pain struck her in the back of the neck, and she seized the
edges of the chair to avoid falling. She had slept a few moments
and her hand had fallen away from young Tom's hand. She searched
for it, and panic came upon her at the quietness that was upon him.
She bent, placing her head near his face; his breath rustled
against it, but the sound of hard struggle was gone; and when she
touched his face the heat, too, had gone.</p>

<p>He was motionless; he was in the sleep of exhaustion and the
fever was broken. She pulled the covers around him and, removing
only her shoes, she got into bed beside Caroline and lay awake, too
tired to be relieved...</p>

<p>On the seventh day the rain stopped; and the water-beaded trees
around the house were all asparkle. A wolf hide hung in the
cowshed, shot by Joe Teal, who had gone home. Young Tom sat propped
around with pillows, his eye sockets deep and a waxiness on his
face, too weary to complain at being in bed; but he was hungry and
he was better.</p>

<p>She carried ten pails of freshet-yellowed water from the Cobway
and set on the washtub. "You're not so sick you can't do some
studying," she told him. "It's time wasted that's sinful, and I'll
not have you ignorant like that trapper. Caroline, get that
arithmetic book for him." She hoisted the boiling tub to a bench
before the door, and, her skirts tied up, she did the washing.</p>

<p>Joe Teal slipped into the cabin with a bottle of berry wine sent
by his mother, having covered the four miles like a hound and yet
breathing softly; and he refused food and quietly disappeared.</p>

<p>By afternoon the washing hung from every overhead pole in the
cabin, beneath which she had to duck to make a meal and tend young
Tom. The closeness of this living crossed her and made her more and
more irritable. This was her mood when a straight, thin and
whiskered man in a dark suit so old and hard-used that it had a
green cast to it stepped from a horse before her door and
cheerfully announced himself.</p>

<p>"I am Reverend White, ridin' my circuit," he said. "Sister Teal
said you were here. Boy's better? This, I guess, is Caroline, and
I've struck you at washin' time and you won't like me for it."</p>

<p>She didn't. It offended her enormously to bring him into this
room with its crowded furniture, and its damp clothes scraping the
top of his gray head. But he was a minister and she was courteous
to him, by nature respecting his profession. She went hastily
around to make up a meal which, because of its poor showing,
further depressed her. He ate and he talked and he was full of good
spirit.</p>

<p>"Husband be back soon? It's a long ride to Vancouver. Sister
Teal mentioned he was after millstones. A miller by trade?"</p>

<p>"He's got knowledge of it," said Mrs. Mercy.</p>

<p>"He'll make out, he'll do well. He's got good land, good water
power&mdash;he's had the best choice before the multitude come.
There's no land like it for richness." He gave her a passing glance
and went back to his food. "A little rain, of course. There's the
gift it's got&mdash;water to make things grow. I recall the
harshness of Northern winters."</p>

<p>"I pine for cold weather," she said.</p>

<p>"That's natural, but another year here and you'll not hanker for
home and friends. You'll have them here."</p>

<p>"Will they ever come?"</p>

<p>"By the thousands," said Reverend White, "and if you bend your
ear, sister, you can hear the tramplin' of their feet now. It's
destiny. That winter wheat planted in the field?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The rain that troubles you will bring that wheat on fat and
heavy. The rain is your bread and butter." He looked at the wine
bottle on the table; she felt shame that he should see it and
wondered what his thoughts were.</p>

<p>"That's Sister Teal's elderberry, I recognize. No medicine like
it for your son."</p>

<p>"Could I offer you some, Reverend?"</p>

<p>He said, "No," in a rather reluctant way and at once said it
stronger. "No. Barely enough for him. Now then," he said rising,
"it's twenty miles to the next family and I have got to ride." He
laid a hand on young Tom's head, on Caroline's head, his hands
blackened from the reins of the horse.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He was a minister, but he had none of that refinement about him
which, in Indiana, sets ministers apart; he was a man before a
minister, more like a millwright than anything else. He thanked her
for the meal and rode downgrade to the meadow and out of sight. She
was disappointed because he had neither asked anything of her
spiritual condition nor had knelt with them in prayer. She would
have been surprised at the Reverend White. Passing around a point
of the hill he came to a grove of oaks well beyond the cabin, here
dismounting to kneel before a tree. He knew her story from Mrs.
Teal, he knew her trials from the trials of other women before her
and he knew, by her expression, the depth of her unhappiness.
Knowing it, he prayed for her aloud, naming all the troubles she
had undergone and all the excellences he saw within her. He listed
them in a good round voice to God, stating her case as a lawyer
might have done; and in the same voice he asked for a small amount
of forgiveness, for a great deal of help. Then he rose, brushed his
wet knees and rode into the gathering twilight toward a cabin
twenty miles away...</p>

<p>She milked, fed the pigs, and gathered the eggs and locked in
the chickens after counting them. After Caroline had gone to bed
she got her basket and pulled the rocker to the fire&mdash;all the
long day waiting for this restful moment&mdash;and settled there
with thread and patch cloth. For a moment the redness of her hands
drew her attention and she let them lie while she became aware of
the scratches upon them. She remembered that her grandmother's
hands had been like this, but not her mother's; for her grandmother
had gone through the same drudgery while her mother, marrying the
village merchant, had lived a calm life.</p>

<p>She might have married a merchant, too, and her days would have
been as pleasant as her mother's. All day long the voices of the
town would be around her, leaving no room for lonesomeness, and she
would belong, she would dance, she would go to church. She had not
let herself think too much of Bob Burglon&mdash;that was a kind of
unfaithfulness; but now she let him come into her mind; his
courtship sent its sweetness through her as she recalled it.</p>

<p>It was hard to know, sometimes, what put one man above another
and why John Mercy, so abruptly coming into her life, had made Bob
Burglon seem no longer right. It had been clear enough then. She
looked closely at Bob Burglon, she looked closely at her
husband&mdash;and she said silently, "No more of that," and put it
out of her head. The fireplace light at last made her eyes tired
and she went to bed...</p>

<p>She was up still earlier next morning and by daybreak had
finished the never-changing chores. Now she brought in from the
shed the slabs of cedar bark young Tom had cut, and began pounding
the cedar fiber free, at last having a pile of it and a great mound
of fluff around her. She brought out a loom, tacking on the stringy
cedar twine as warp, and began the tedious hand job of running the
woof through; by noon she was sorry she had begun and grew cross
when young Tom became hungry. "Caroline, fix his big stomach
something."</p>

<p>She hated to waste time, and by two o'clock, having had no meal
herself, finished the cedar mat, threw it on the floor before the
doorway and was done with it. But for a moment she studied it and
thought: <i>Why, it's not bad,</i> and saw how she could do better
next time. She was in haste; everything piled up on her. From the
shed she got a venison joint, and put it into the deep skillet. She
made a pie, and at proper time laid onions and potatoes and
parsnips around the baking venison. Twilight came on, she turning
rapidly from one piece of work to another.</p>

<p>She changed young Tom's bed, washed his face; she did Caroline's
hair and was momentarily happy with her daughter's prettiness; and
then at last she did her own hair and tied on a new apron. It was
full dark by that time; standing at the open doorway she listened
for the sound of Mercy's wagon to rise from the far deep quiet of
the night. She began to worry, to see the rivers he had to cross,
the Indians who went back and forth through this country in their
roving bands. Young Tom said, "It's way past suppertime."</p>

<p>"You can wait a little longer," she said: then, in the distance
beyond the meadow, she heard Mercy's call. "It will be just a
little while," she said. She looked at them, adding, "We will not
say we've been troubled, mind you." She looked from one to the
other. "I want you to know that there's always trouble, and each
one has got to stand his own, or everybody'd always be crying. Your
father's got his, and bears them, and we'll bear ours."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He circled the wagon into its place beside the cabin, seeing his
wife and daughter framed in the doorway's gushing yellow light. He
said, "That's a pretty sight. Everything well?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mercy said, "We got along."</p>

<p>"I said eight days&mdash;and eight days it was."</p>

<p>"You can thank the Lord as much as your own guessing," she
said.</p>

<p>He unyoked and led away the oxen and came slowly back, walking
with a weary man's loose knees. He got something from the wagon and
said to Caroline, still standing in the doorway, "Magpie," and saw
young Tom in bed. "What's here?"</p>

<p>"He had a cold," said Mrs. Mercy, "but it's all right now. We'll
eat when you've washed." She looked at him, knowing he had spared
no strength to be back on time.</p>

<p>He met her glance and a sparkle got into his eyes and he said,
"Well, then, I've not been missed?"</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish, Mercy. It's not right to beg for sentiment."
She watched him reach into the package he carried, laying out a
clustered chunk of transparent rock candy, and a string of Hudson
Bay beads.</p>

<p>"Candy, from London, for the kids. Beads for you. Pretty
things."</p>

<p>She looked at them, she didn't touch them, she didn't meet
Mercy's eyes. Her manner was brisk, almost impatient. "I hope you
didn't waste money on me. You know I don't year trinkets. They will
do for Caroline," she added and turned to bring the roast to the
table.</p>

<p>He sat heavily on the rocker and got out of his boots, into his
slippers. He washed and combed his hair and took his place at the
table. When his family had come about it, he looked at them, one by
one, and dropped his head.</p>

<p>"For the food, for a safe return, and for the health of this
family, Lord, thanks, Amen." He raised his head, a steady faintly
austere benevolence coming to his face. "No trouble, then?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to speak of," said Martha Mercy.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. Quarter Section on Dullknife
Creek</h2>

<p>They dropped from the high hills to the top of a lower ridge,
Tom Baker and his son Elzie, and left the horses and stopped by a
big pine. Elzie leaned against the pine, holding the Krag. For a
boy of twelve it was a bulky gun but the weight didn't seem to
bother him; nothing bothered him now because he was all tied up in
the hope of getting his first deer. The sun was almost down and the
light had changed, filling the ravine below them with dusty
pearl-gray shadows; down there was a runway that mule deer used in
coming and going from the hills.</p>

<p>"In fact," said Tom Baker in a voice very soft for so big a man,
"there's a buck movin' out of the brush now. You see him,
Elzie?"</p>

<p>Elzie lifted the Krag along the pine bark and steadied it. His
heels squirmed slowly in the dust; he was bracing himself against
the Krag's recoil, for he had practised on this gun long enough to
know the wallop it had. "But I believe I'd wait," said Tom Baker in
the same gentle murmuring, "till he got lower in the canyon. He
ain't seen us and he can't smell us and he'll drift down and come
to a stop, to look things over. That's the way they travel. Stop
and look and go&mdash;and stop again. Same way when they reach
water&mdash;a drink and a look, and a drink and a look. Aim right
behind the forequarter. Don't want to gutshoot him."</p>

<p>He watched Elzie, not the buck. Elzie's cheek lay flat against
the gunstock and his whole face was solemnly thin, which would be a
youngster's excitement freezing everything inside him. A man had to
remember the way a boy felt when he was twelve, shooting his first
deer or doing anything for the first time. A man needed to remember
about being young, because it was so easy to forget. Elzie's
sighting eye ceased to wink and the crook of his finger grew
steadily smaller against the trigger. The report of the gun was a
dry burst which fled through the hills in loosening waves and died
out as fragments in far corridors. The buck jumped and dropped, not
moving again. Elzie worked the Krag's bolt but he held the gun half
lowered, staring at the brown patch of the deer below; his face was
starved and thoughtful, his eyes black as coal.</p>

<p>"Wait up," said Tom Baker, so gently, and walked to his horses
for a rope. It was a mighty big feeling for a youngster, that first
kill; it just went right down to the roots. You wouldn't ever think
it from looking at Elzie's small and pointed face just now, but
that was being young, to hold the big feelings out of sight. The
little feelings always showed but not the big ones. He came back
with the rope and they went down the slope together, Elzie circling
the buck.</p>

<p>"Not at the head, son. Don't get in front of those horns till we
know." When he tested the deer with his boot he knew it was stone
dead; and cut its throat at once. He waited to see if Elzie
remembered how he had been taught and when the boy turned over the
safety on the Krag and laid it down, he was pleased. Training took
a lot of time, but when you saw the results work out, you got a
kind of grateful feeling. He said: "A mighty square shot. You did
well. And there's our winter's venison as good as in the jar right
now."</p>

<p>Praise always affected Elzie. He looked down and said in a
half-smothered way: "Did just like you said. Didn't waste a shot,
did I?"</p>

<p>"No sir, you sure didn't," said Tom Baker. He opened the deer,
cleaning it. He broke a branch from the nearest pine and trimmed
out a couple of short poles, cutting them to a point at each end
and jamming them in the buck's tendons. He threw one end of the
rope over a taller limb of the pine, fastened the other end to one
of the poles, and hauled the buck well off the ground, tying the
free end of the rope to another pine. "High enough to keep the
coyotes off. It will cool tonight. Some men," he added, "hang their
meat other end down. I like this way best; seems as though it
drains better."</p>

<p>He explained these things in a deliberate, patient way, so that
they would sink in. For he had a humble man's deep respect for the
usefulness and the power of knowledge. He had no book learning he
could give his son; all he knew were the practical things, the
lessons he had learned by the usage of his hands, and these he
meant Elzie to have; because they were all he could give, and
because the giving of them might save Elzie some of his own
toil.</p>

<p>The sun dropped and twilight moved in swiftly, a bodiless gray
water filling the canyon brimful. Tom Baker wasted another few
moments to roll a smoke, so that Elzie might have the last spell of
pleasure from looking at his deer. Then they climbed the canyon's
side, got to their horses and descended the long grade toward the
floor of the sage desert.</p>

<p>Now that it was over, Elzie thawed and became talkative. He
said: "It was a good one, wasn't it? What'll it weigh?"</p>

<p>"Dress close to two-fifty."</p>

<p>"You got sharp eyes, dad. I wouldn't of seen it until you spoke.
Then I just remembered what to do. I just remembered what you'd
said. Seems like I had to remember everything at once, and then I
did. About the trigger and keeping my eyes open and takin' time,
and sighting behind the forequarter. I used to wonder how I'd be
able to see that spot. Now I know how it goes. Next year I'll know
how to dress it, too."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Baker. "It's the knowin' that counts, Elzie. You
read a thing and then you see it. But you've got to do it. Then you
really know."</p>

<p>The sage desert opened below and beyond them, with twilight's
dark-opal haze shimmering on it, with here and there a faint light
glittering from wide-spaced homestead houses, and the black hulk of
the Rim rising as a solid shadow thirty miles west. Dropping from
the bench of the hills, they forded Dullknife Creek, crossed the
road and came to the yard and the house. Lissie and Little Bill
were making a clatter inside but Mrs. Baker was in the doorway,
saying: "Any luck?"</p>

<p>Baker saw the struggle on Elzie's face&mdash;to shout it out at
once or to hold himself in. Elzie held himself in, saying in as
deep and brief a voice as he could manage, "We got one."</p>

<p>"Elzie's deer," softly added Tom Baker. "Nice one."</p>

<p>"Now, Elzie," applauded Mrs. Baker's voice, but Elzie was gone,
kicking his horse toward the corral. Tom Baker grinned at his wife,
and put away the horses. Elzie drove in the cow and mixed up the
mash for the hogs while Baker milked, his big hands squeezing the
jets in tinny rhythm against the sides of the pail. He strained the
milk in the pantry shed and poured it into the shallow skim pans,
whereupon would come by morning the thick rise of yellow cream; and
washed at the back porch basin, blowing the water through his hands
as he scrubbed his face. Elzie was inside speaking to
seven-year-old Lissie and to Little Bill who couldn't catch on,
being only two: "Well, it came down the canyon and dad saw it and I
shot it. Just one shot." He put out his hand, cocking thumb and
forefinger and said: "Bang."</p>

<p>Little Bill said: "Bang."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Elzie, "you're just a kid."</p>

<p>Tom Baker chuckled behind his towel. He went into the yellow
light of the kitchen, into its warm smell of supper; and sat up to
the table. He said, "Your turn, Elzie," and bowed his head a
little, winking at Lissie while Elzie said grace.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baker said: "Tomorrow will be a good day to work on that
meat. Bring it down early, Tom."</p>

<p>When they had finished, Tom Baker brought in a boiler of water
and set it on the stove; and dragged the galvanized washtub to the
center of the floor. He settled longlegged in a chair and lighted
up a pipe, a man cast upon the shores of indolent content. He had a
little plowing to do, a load of wood to bring out of the hills, and
a few beeves to sell; but then the work of the year was about done
and he could look either backward or forward and feel no worry.
There was food and shelter, and no debts, and everybody was in good
health. Mighty strange how these plain things counted to a man.
These above everything else. The smoke of his pipe drifted over the
room in sleazy layers and a haze of steam began to rise from the
boiler. Little Bill crawled into his lap, reaching for his pipe
stem. Lissie stood on a chair to wipe dishes, and Elzie was outside
in the glow of moonlight; he would be dreaming over the day, living
every minute of it again, just growing big with it. You had to
remember how youngsters felt.</p>

<p>He put Little Bill in the chair, dumped part of the hot water
into the tub, and refilled the boiler; he rolled back his sleeves,
and undressed Little Bill and knelt down, the pipe angled at a
corner of his mouth. Little Bill was round-bellied, full of the
devil and as slippery as the bar of soap; when he had finished his
chore, buttoning on Little Bill's nightgown, Tom Baker was wet to
the armpits. Afterwards, dumping the tub and adding fresh water, he
gave Lissie her bath; and called Elzie in.</p>

<p>Elzie took his own bath, making work out of it. He was pretty
close to twelve, flat-sided and skinny-muscled as boys get to be at
that age, the skin on his stomach white in contrast to the turned
tan of his arms and legs and neck. Lissie sat, half sleepy, in
Baker's lap and Little Bill, holding the edges of his nightshirt
from the damp floor, slowly circled Elzie in the tub; he pointed
his finger at Elzie and said: "Bang&mdash;bang."</p>

<p>Elzie said: "You ought to send these kids to bed. I'm gettin'
pretty old to be stared at."</p>

<p>Baker's glance lifted over Elzie's head, to his wife watching in
the background. "For a fact, I guess you are."</p>

<p>It took time to get all this done and sometimes it dragged when
you were tired. But, herding the youngsters up the stairs, with
Little Bill riding his back, he figured it was something you had to
stop and think about. They wouldn't be young long; soon enough
they'd be out of his reach for good. So the time to make them
remember, to see they learned the right things and saw the proper
examples, was now&mdash;in this short space you had with them. He
listened to their prayers and opened the attic windows and left the
lamp low-burning on account of Little Bill, its faint light making
all the shadows of the attic darkly mysterious. He kissed Little
Bill and Lissie, smelling the soap on them and the rank, sweet
odors below the soap fragrance, which was the smell of childhood;
and scrubbed Elzie's black hair with his hand. He hadn't kissed
Elzie for a couple of years now, knowing the boy was a little old
for it. "Well, maybe if we need a little fresh meat we'll go after
another one late this month." He walked downstairs, dumped the tub
and refilled the boiler, and went out to sit on the porch, nursing
his pipe. In a little while his wife joined him.</p>

<p>The hard heat of the year was gone; this was Indian summer, with
haze closing over the land and the smell of smoke abroad and the
kind of a quietness that comes when the earth slows down and
steadies itself for winter. He felt an edge in the small
wind&mdash;the edge of coming rain. Crickets were singing and the
frogs had begun to make their pleasant sawed-off racket down in the
quiet willows where Dullknife Creek made its slackwater pool. The
moon was a quarter full and this light silvered the thick dust of
the Prairie City road and lay on the rising benchlands like a
depthless mist. In this night the land gave up its thick scents, or
sage and stubble field and stacked hay and barnyard and dust and
wild rose and the sweet Williams growing by the gate. He had lived
with them so long he could catch each smell distinct and clear from
the others. A night like this took all the trouble out of a man's
bones; the last murmuring of the children was pleasant to hear in
the stillness.</p>

<p>He laid the flat of his heavy hand on his wife's knee, turning
slowly to see her. There wasn't anything easy about a woman's life
on a sagebrush quarter section; but she still stayed young, she
still had her quick humor&mdash;and a sort of swing and sparkle to
her. Her hair was very black and after twelve years of marriage she
held her strong, soft-rounded shape, so that even now it stirred
him when he thought about it, as it had before marriage. He liked
her steadiness, he liked her fun; he liked the way she still could
flirt with him, holding him off and then, when it got exasperating,
coming to him and making everything all right. It never got calm
and settled, never dull; there was still that hunger
underneath.</p>

<p>He tapped his pipe on the toe of his boot and went in to pour
his bath water, and to refill the boiler for her. The tub was
always a problem for a man his size. He sat jackknifed in it, his
toes jammed against the sides, his back creased into the rim,
feeling pretty awkward and wryly grinning back at her open laughter
at the sight he made; she knelt and scrubbed his back and dripped
water perversely on his face and left him. When he was through he
emptied the tub and refilled it for her; and went around the house,
trying the windows and doors, and took the clock and wound it, and
went to bed.</p>

<p>Lying there, thinking back over the year, he saw nothing to be
disturbed by. For a man who had come off the open range, salty and
a little wild twelve years before, he had done well. When she came
to bed, warm and close and her hair damp and sweetsmelling, he
said:</p>

<p>"Next week we'll just load up the wagon and go up into the hills
for a vacation."</p>

<p>Her laughter, quick and like a summons, turned him. "For an old
woman," he said, "you're pretty fresh."</p>

<p>"Next week's next week."</p>

<p>"Sure," he said, "and this is now."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He went into the hills at first daylight and brought out the buck;
and strung it up in the woodshed and skinned it, with Elzie
watching. Baker said: "Keep a heavy pull on the hide. Stretches the
tallow from the skin and gives you a clean cut." He halved the
carcass and butchered it on the chopping block, taking off the
quarters, slicing the steak meat, and trimming the ribs. His wife
already had jars boiling and the frying pan on the stove. The
steaks would be fried, they'd go in gallon jars, sealed in their
own gravy; the chuck meat she'd make into meat balls, using the
tallow to cover them; and she had a way of putting part of it up in
brine, so that nothing was wasted. The last thing he did was to cut
long strips of flank meat to be put in the smokehouse and jerked.
He got the smokehouse fire started, left Elzie in charge and, with
a remaining quarter wrapped in a clean muslin sack, he lined out
for town.</p>

<p>He left the quarter at Mrs. Tyson's, four miles down the road,
and reached Prairie a little beyond noon. He saw Pete Luz about
selling his four cows, bought a few things his wife had asked him
to get and got a bag of candy apiece for the children. Roundup time
was a week away and somebody had put a couple of banners across the
street, giving this raw, wooden town an overdressed air. There was
a Sunday crowd in the saloon, homesteaders and riders from the
cattle outfits. He knew most of them, saluted them cheerfully and
had a drink or two, passing the time of the day and catching up on
the gossip. In the middle of the afternoon he thought about eating
and started over to the Shorthorn. Somebody said, "Hello, Tom," and
he stopped to talk to Ned Puryear and then saw the banker's boy,
Jimmy Ryan, come riding down the street on a good horse and a new
saddle.</p>

<p>Jimmy Ryan was around twelve, same as Elzie, and he was a smart
young fellow, taking some pleasure in showing off the horse and the
saddle. Puryear said: "Where'd you get the saddle, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Birthday," said Jimmy and held a tight bit on the horse, making
it fiddle-foot in the dust.</p>

<p>The saddle, Tom Baker saw, was straight out of the shop, and
expensive, with acorns stamped in and round skirts and decorated
stirrup leathers and fenders. Jimmy Ryan went down the street, the
horse dancing sidewise in the dust, and on that instant a feeling,
quick and cold and disheartening, shook its way through Tom Baker.
He forgot about the Shorthorn, about being hungry. He stood there,
staring at the boy until the boy was gone; and swung on his heels
to get his packages from the saloon, returning to his horse. This
was the way he looked in the saddle, a heavy-thewed, limber man
with his skin smooth and sunbrown, and a long pair of lips settled
across heavy teeth, and a loose-brimmed hat raked over his hair,
which was black as dye. He sat there, staring at the candy he had
bought and change went through him completely. The liquor had
loosened him, but when he came to think of Jimmy Ryan, and the
saddle, and the three bags of candy in his hand, he wasn't loose
any more. He rode slowly home.</p>

<p>The youngsters were happy about the candy but that didn't help
him. His wife had a side-table full of canned venison and he said
in the soft voice which never left him, "That's sure nice," but
emptiness rattled inside Tom Baker and his wife saw it and took
time to come to the door and watch him when he crossed the yard. He
relieved Elzie at the smokehouse, building up the fire; he stood at
the fence and looked across the quarter section; he rolled a
cigarette and just stood there, with the points of his shoulders
dropped, as though the heart had gone out of him.</p>

<p>The sun went down and supper time came. He sat at the table, a
changed man who said nothing while he looked at Elzie and the
younger ones; and afterwards he built a smoke in his pipe and went
to the porch. He didn't lean back in ease. He humped forward, his
long arms rested on his legs, hands down, staring out at the land
through the tobacco smoke. It was funny what a day did to a man.
Now this had looked pretty nice last night, this quarter section by
moonlight. It didn't look that way now. It wasn't exactly the
saddle; Elzie had a good enough saddle even though it was old and
plain. Well, it was what the saddle meant. Ryan had something to
give his son, Ryan would send the boy away to school and Jimmy
would keep up with things, the way Ryan had. It was a matter of
learning; you weren't anything in the world without learning; not
the way the world went now. He listened to the children as they
climbed the stairs, not following them as he usually did. His wife
finished the dishes and came out to sit beside him, waiting through
his silence; she was, he realized gratefully, an understanding
woman. She knew he was in trouble and waited until he spoke it.</p>

<p>When a man felt satisfied he never saw much; it took trouble to
open his eyes. Right now he was remembering his boyhood and the
two-room log house in Montana which had somehow held his parents
and five children, and a grandfather, who slept in the barn. They
had a small outfit and they got along; but when they grew up it was
his oldest brother Pete who took the ranch. It wasn't big enough to
support anybody else and so the rest of the young ones just drifted
away; some of them he had never heard from since, nor had he ever
written back. That's the way it was.</p>

<p>And that's the way it would be here. This quarter section on
Dullknife Creek wasn't much to pass on; looking through the
moonglow, he saw it pretty straight&mdash;just a sagebrush outfit,
with his kids growing up to nothing, and drifting, and not knowing
enough to be anything better than he had been or his father had
been. And never writing back.</p>

<p>He sat there, miserably seeing it; and spoke. "Well, it was just
a saddle Ryan gave his boy, Jimmy. Never mind the saddle. It's Ryan
standing behind Jimmy, able to give him something and send him out
to school. You could see that on Jimmy when he was sittin' in the
saddle&mdash;a sort of top man look. He knows he's on the right
track, goin' somewhere. It shows up. What've I got to give Elzie,
or Little Bill? What's ahead for Lissie? No, I got to find a way. I
got to get some money. No use sittin' around here all winter." And
presently he added in the slow way of a man who had made up his
mind: "In the mornin' I'll pack a blanket roll and go over to that
railroad construction outfit. Man can always get on there."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He was gone by daylight, hiking the thirty miles, and was on the
construction company's payroll that same afternoon, handling a
shovel at three dollars a day. They were cutting a grade down the
face of the Rim&mdash;one long slash to let the new railroad off
the high desert to the Prairie City level. He paid six bits a day
for board and bunked in a shanty that had a tin stove and double
decked bunks and a card table and a couple chairs; you could smell
the staleness of tobacco and whisky and unwashed clothes and
blankets. In this particular shanty were three Irishmen, a
Lithuanian, a Mexican and a dangerous kid that called himself
Calumet Red.</p>

<p>Three hundred men worked on the grade; they were coming and
going all the time. On the second day the strawboss came by.
"You're a rancher&mdash;you handle horses?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"All right, you drive team. You're on the hook at
five-and-a-half a day."</p>

<p>The teamsters worked up and down the raw powder-gray dust of the
grade, hauling water and supplies. The work wasn't any harder but
it brought in two-and-a-half more a day. That was what knowledge
did for a man. If you knew how to do something, you got out of the
crowd; you climbed up. He could handle horses. It wasn't so
much&mdash;but it just showed what knowledge did. He'd have to tell
Elzie about this, so Elzie would understand what it meant to know
something. Now and then, driving the grade, he watched the
superintendent, Mr. Cochran, hurry along the cut; a solid little
man, quick as a terrier, with his eyes moving around, sharp and
observant. That's the thing he must tell Elzie. Even a humble man
with a little knowledge got his rewards; but then you learned more,
like Mr. Cochran, and you rose up over three hundred men, or a
thousand, or more. It just depended on how much you knew.</p>

<p>But it was hard to stick out that first week. He missed his wife
and he missed the children; and he worried a little at not being
around to talk to Elzie&mdash;just to slip in a word now and then,
so that Elzie might catch something he wouldn't otherwise get.
About growing up, about what was the right thing and the seemly
thing, about what was straight and what was not. This mighty short
time in childhood was all you had to set them out with their feet
in the right direction. It was hard to be here and feel this time
slip away. He sat in a bunkhouse chair by night, or lay on his bunk
and smoked his pipe, all his muscles heavy with weariness,
listening to the men in the shanty; and watching Calumet Red. The
kid had a swagger and he was insolent. Blond hair grew down like a
woolly mat in the back of his neck and he had thick shoulder
muscles and there was a stain of red in the corner of his eyeballs,
and he had the men bluffed, even the Lithuanian who was a giant.
Calumet Red was maybe twenty and once or twice Tom Baker saw the
kid turn his pale, redshot eyes on him; as though sizing him up to
see if he could bluff him, or lick him.</p>

<p>Saturday noon at the end of work he lined out for home, walking
fast. It was dark when he came down the last turn of the road and
the light from the house made him feel odd; he had never been away
from his family this long before and now that light seemed to shine
against him, as though he were outside of it. It came quickly, and
quickly went away. The door was open and his wife stood in it,
waiting and smiling, with her head tipped aside. When he came to
her he felt awkward, like a stranger, and he stood there and at
last said: "Well, don't look like anything burned down." But she
laughed at him, or with him, and put her hand on his shoulder and
kissed him.</p>

<p>"I've saved up some supper. I knew you'd be here." The kids were
in bed. Baker got a towel and a bar of soap and went down to the
creek and took his bath in the pool. The day had been warm and the
water was warm, and he went back to the house and ate his supper,
with his wife seated opposite, chin in her hands, watching.</p>

<p>"Elzie's done all the milking."</p>

<p>"He'll do," said Baker. It was good to be here; it was a feeling
in his bones, like rest. He built a smoke in the pipe and wiped
dishes while she washed, and walked around the yard in the
moonlight, looking at the horses in the corral, scratching the back
of the sow in the pen. The smell of sage came off the desert rank
and satisfying and the benchland rolled upward in the silver yellow
glow toward the pines. He returned to the house and went up to the
children; he opened the attic window wider and looked down at them,
at Little Bill who lay on his back with his arms flung out and
every muscle loose, at Lissie's yellow hair tumbled around her
head, at Elzie whose face showed a patch of dirt on one side of his
freckled cheek. They were asleep, they were dreaming. In bed, he
lay awake beside the warmth and the softness of his wife, with her
head lying on his shoulder, and silence came down
wonderfully&mdash;the silence of a house filled with a family all
together.</p>

<p>In the morning he worked at the little chores and chopped wood.
There was still the smell of rain in the air. "One good soakin' and
I'll take a day off to plow," he said. They had chicken and gravy
and mashed potatoes and biscuits and pumpkin pie for noon meal; and
then it was time to go. But he loitered around the house, just
walking in and out of it until it was three o'clock. "Well," he
said, "I'll be back next week," and left his wife at the door. The
youngsters walked down the road with him a mile or more, and then
he went on alone. At the big dip in the road he turned to see them
standing far behind. They were three in a tapering row, all holding
hands, Elzie and Lissie and Little Bill; he raised his hand at them
and set out to cover the distance. It was a long thirty miles.</p>

<p>First fall rain set in that week, coming up out of the south
west in long slantwise ropes glittering like ragged splinters of
glass against the leaden day. The powdery gray alkali mud deepened
on the grade and water stood in the ruts until the wagon hubs
touched it; and this mud and this wetness was on everything. That
following Saturday it was too stormy to go home; and he sat through
Sunday in the bunkhouse, idle and irritable, smelling the damp
steam rising out of clothes and the smell of unwashed bodies and
listening to the broken stories of the men around him. He sat
there, far away from all of them, while he thought of his family,
and a jumpiness got into him. Calumet Red, coming to the stove,
pushed him accidentally, perhaps, back in the chair, and stared at
him with his red-stained eyes. "Why in hell you got to take up all
this space?" And the kid seemed to wait, with his lips puckered
back from his bad teeth. Baker let that pass, though he knew he
should have called the kid at once; there was always that slow way
of judging in him. Then it was Thursday with all the world drowned
out in gray rain mists and the bunkhouse was like a steam bath,
close and rank and dismal, and everybody was on edge. There was a
bunch of Russians in the next shanty, all good men, but they had
gotten some whisky and now were singing in a wild low way that
clawed at the man's nerves. Tom Baker came in from the rain, and
was in the doorway when Calumet Red started out of the bunkhouse.
He met Baker right there and his face was straight and bad and his
nostrils swelled and without a word he dropped his head and hit
Baker twice in the stomach and knocked Baker out of the door, down
into the gray liquid mud of the grade.</p>

<p>The wind came back to him when he stood up, the mud slid in
loose fragments all along his clothes; he walked in against the kid
waiting at the doorway. The kid hit at him and missed, and Baker
just walked in solid and slow and drove the kid backward, through
the narrow aisle between the bunks, back into the rear space by the
stove. The bunkhouse was full of men; they stood up to get out of
the way, they rolled into the bunks to get out of the way. Calumet
Red crouched and jumped at Baker, strong as a young ox and hurt
Baker badly with his fists; but Baker moved on against him. He
caught the kid's arms and tied them up and drove the kid against
the shanty wall. He battered the kid's head against the wall and
let go with his fists, smashing the kid's face, side to side; he
caught him again and got his big arms around the kid's throat and
shook him like a sack of straw, and hit him once more and dropped
him. He felt mean enough at the moment to kill the boy and was
ashamed of the feeling.</p>

<p>The only sound in the bunkhouse was the draw of the kid's
breathing and his own. The kid was down in a corner; he looked up
at Baker with his face bleeding and a dead, confused, hating color
in his eyes.</p>

<p>Baker said: "Get up and sit in that chair, son."</p>

<p>The kid just sat there until Baker added, in the soft voice that
never left him, "Do as I say, boy, or I'll break your neck."
Calumet Red came off his haunches; he sat in the chair, his thick
shoulders bunched over, his feet touching a stove poker lying on
the floor. His glance reached the stove poker and rose swiftly,
livened by a thought.</p>

<p>"Where you come from?" said Baker.</p>

<p>"Duluth," said the kid. "What of it?"</p>

<p>"Where's your dad?"</p>

<p>"In the pen, if he's alive," said the kid. "I dunno. I pulled
out long time ago."</p>

<p>"Got a mother?"</p>

<p>"How the hell do I know?"</p>

<p>The kid's glance dropped to the poker and Tom Baker knew what
was in his mind at once. Before the kid moved he brought his tough
hand around like the sweep of an ax, palm open, and hit the kid on
the side of the face. It was like the sound of an exploding bottle;
the kid fell off the chair&mdash;he was thrown off&mdash;and struck
the floor in a round heap. The kid was dirty all the way through,
which was the way he had been taught by his kind of life. But maybe
there was something below that was worth looking at; and then Baker
knew there wasn't. For the kid brought up his hand to shield his
face, and on his face was nothing but the cringing look of a
whipped pup. No hatred, no life, no anger.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for that, son," said Baker. "I shouldn't of done
it."</p>

<p>Next morning the kid was gone. He had rolled his blankets and
pulled out. But, driving team through the bottomless mud, with the
rain slashing against him, Baker remembered what the kid had said
about his people. His people had not been good and the kid had
grown up without help. This was what happened when you left a boy
alone in that mighty short space of childhood; when you didn't
stand by to steady him and speak to him, and show him the proper
road. This was what happened. When he thought of it&mdash;and he
thought of it all that day&mdash;something faltered in him and fear
got in him for the time he had been away from home. This was
Friday. Saturday morning, driving past the line of shacks he saw
Mr. Cochran come from the cookshack, wheel slowly and fall into the
mud.</p>

<p>Baker wrapped the reins around the brake handle and got down and
lifted Mr. Cochran out of the mud. Mr. Cochran was drunk; his legs
would not hold him and Baker had to support him and push him back
into the cookshack. He settled Mr. Cochran down on a bench. Mr.
Cochran hooked his elbows against the long table and stared at
Baker.</p>

<p>"You're all right&mdash;you're all right," he said. "You're all
right."</p>

<p>Baker said in his slow, quiet way, "What's the need of getting
drunk, Mr. Cochran? For a hunky, maybe. Not for you."</p>

<p>"Not for me?" mimicked Mr. Cochran. He was laughing. It was a
giggling rush in his throat. He almost cried when he laughed.
"Well, you're all right. Not for me, uh?" And then he quit laughing
and it hurt Tom Baker to see what he saw. Mr. Cochran's face was
pale and it was empty. You looked at it and you saw maybe misery,
or foolishness, or maybe something behind that really was like the
beginning of a black hole. But you didn't see any happiness or
anything solid, such as a man with knowledge, like Mr. Cochran's
knowledge, ought to have. All Mr. Cochran's knowledge wasn't
enough; not enough to satisfy him or hold him together. So he
walked out of a door, dead drunk, and fell in the mud.</p>

<p>It occurred to Tom Baker that it wasn't seemly for him to stand
here spying on another man like that. So he said, "Mighty sorry,
Mr. Cochran," and went back to his wagon. He drove down the grade,
delivered his load and took the team to the barn; he didn't bother
about noon meal, but rolled his blankets and got his time from the
timekeeper, and headed home.</p>

<p>The day was over with early, drowned out by the rain fog.
Passing Prairie, he supposed it would save a trip if he went into
town and cashed his time slip, but haste was on him, as though he
had wasted too much time away from home now. This mist kept rolling
up against him until it got through his clothes and into his shoes;
until he was solidly adrip. Deep in the darkness he heard Delzell's
dog barking a quarter mile back from the road. At the top of the
dip he caught the shining of his own houselight&mdash;a little
splinter of warmth that came out and touched him and quickened his
heavy legs. It was ten o'clock. When he came up to the porch, his
boots making a racket, the door opened and his wife stood there and
the warmth of the room eddied against him.</p>

<p>She said, so calmly: "Better leave the blanket roll out there,
Tom. Probably it's lousy."</p>

<p>He threw down the blanket roll, stepping into the room. Water
began to collect at his feet, the pool gathering mud. He bent down
to unlace his shoes, but the slight pressure of her arm drew him
upright and she looked straight at him, at his eyes, and then she
was smiling. "A long time, wasn't it, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Mighty long time."</p>

<p>"You're a funny man. You don't take to worry often. But when you
do you worry hard. There never was anything to worry about. The
children are all right. They'll always be all right&mdash;because
of the kind of children they are. And because, maybe, of us."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, in slow, complete conviction, "I know that
now." He moved out and got the boiler and filled it and hoisted it
to the stove; and brought in the tub. He stood by the stove,
shelling off his outer clothes, and watched his wife move around,
making up a supper. His woolen underwear began to steam and to
itch, and then he went up the stairs, and closed the attic window
against the inbeating rain. Little Bill slept with his arms flung
out and all his muscles loose. Lissie turned in her bed and smiled
in sleep and brought up a hand, laying it against her face. Her
body was a round ball beneath the quilts. When he came to Elzie's
bed and saw the boy's tanned sober face he had a moment's
tremendous regret for the three weeks spent away. Elzie's dark hair
stuck up like straw sticks; he was getting long and thin from
growth and there was a boy's smell on him. Baker stood there a
little while, everything pretty clear in his mind. It took a good
deal to make a man, and learning was only one of the things. The
thing was, you had to stay by your children and show them how it
all went, insofar as you knew. Maybe a word now and then, just a
word; and a good deal of example, by the way you did a thing or
didn't do it; but mostly by just living with them, so that
everything sank in. So that when they grew up&mdash;if they had
good blood and saw things straight they were all right. So that
when they went away, they could look back and remember; and never
go far wrong, because of what they remembered.</p>

<p>He went down and poured his water and had his bath, his wife
laughing at the figure he made, and sat up to the table full of
hunger. Afterwards he built a smoke in his pipe and sat by the
stove, listening to the rain beat over his house, catching the raw
freshness of the little currents of air drifting in. The sky would
be washed clean and when the sun came again the land would be like
new. Presently it was time for bed. He walked around the house,
trying the windows, and wound the clock. Lying in bed, beside the
warmth and the closeness of his wife, he had a tremendous feeling
of happiness; everything went off his mind and he laughed silently
at himself.</p>

<p>He said: "When the sun comes out again I think we'll just pack
up the wagon and tent and go up in the hills. Maybe next week.
Should be fine fishing in the lake. And I can show Little Bill the
beavers. He ain't seen a beaver yet. We'll have a vacation. Next
week."</p>

<p>Her voice was alive, amused; there was something in it to hit a
man pretty hard. "That's next week, Tom."</p>

<p>"Sure. I know. And this is now."</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. Custom of the Country</h2>

<p>People who had lived so closely together during the long
crossing of the plains were scarcely the kind to fear their
neighbors; and therefore not one of Portland's dozen houses had a
lock. Nor was it the custom to knock on a door before entering; the
habits of the trail were still strong in these settlers. At the
Lord cabin, Rose Ann Talbot simply called out, "Here's your milk,
Mrs. Lord," lifted the latch and walked into the cabin's single
room.</p>

<p>A fireplace blaze lightened the afternoon grayness of the room
and touched Hobart Walling, that bold and strutting little farmer
who was here to drive his bargain. He had driven his stock in from
the Tualatin, the mud of which was still on his boots and trousers;
his face was roughened and crimsoned by weather and his close-set
eyes held an aggressive shrewdness.</p>

<p>Dislike moved through Rose Ann as his glance touched her, ran
across her cheeks with its prying familiarity, and returned to
Lord. "You and your woman understand the work a farmer's wife has
got to do. I wouldn't want Sarah to think it was an easy life."</p>

<p>Lord said, "Sarah's fourteen, and work's all she's done. That's
all this family knows, is work. Hell, my woman was twelve when she
married me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lord stood near the fire, silent, apparently agreeable.
Sarah, the main party to this dickering, remained in the shadows of
the room's corner. She had a plain sweet face touched with
freckles, and a flat body; her silence reflected the uncertainty of
any immature little girl. There was nothing about her, Rose Ann
thought, to show she really understood this bargaining or to show
that she had any deep feeling about it. She was still; she was
intent; she watched Hobart Walling closely.</p>

<p>"You'll get an extra half section of land with a wife," said
Lord. "That's important, Hobart."</p>

<p>Walling nodded and glanced at Sarah. He said, "What you think
about it, Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well," said Walling, "then it's settled. I got to get back to
the farm by Sunday night."</p>

<p>Lord said, "We'll fix it for Sunday morning. You talk to that
Congregational preacher about it, Hobart."</p>

<p>Walling used the back of his hand to scratch the whiskers Under
his chin. He nodded at Sarah but he spoke to Mrs. Lord. "She got
clothes and things? We won't get into town much this winter. I
don't mind if you want to buy a few things for her on my account."
He looked at Rose Ann again, and the greasy sensation renewed
itself within her; then he turned out of the room.</p>

<p>Lord turned to his wife with sharp triumph: "That's it."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lord looked toward Sarah. "Sarah, you got a good practical
man. You'll have a better home than I ever had."</p>

<p>Rose Ann tried to keep the protest out of her voice: "Sarah, do
you really want to get married?"</p>

<p>She caught Mrs. Lord's wondering glance, and the annoyance on
Lord's cheeks. Sarah's expression was one of smooth and flattered
self-satisfaction. Her eyes were round and large. She was
confident; she had had her own moment of triumph. "I'll be
married&mdash;I won't be an old maid. I'll have a house. I'll have
babies."</p>

<p>Rose Ann turned to leave the cabin before unwise words escaped
her. Mrs. Lord called, "I'm grateful for the milk, Rose Ann," but
she paid no attention. She walked along a slick pathway winding
around the stumps of a future street, through the early twilight
which came upon this settlement crouched between the river and the
huge fir forest directly behind; she walked with her head down and
her thoughts were fretful. The Lord family got a prosperous
son-in-law to lean on while Walling took a hired girl without pay;
for Sarah it was nothing but a dollhouse dream magnified.</p>

<p>Entering her own cabin, Rose Ann lighted the candles and dished
the meal and waited for her father to return from the store; there
was distress in her face, and her father noticed it. "We must be
out of salt or flour or something," he said.</p>

<p>"The Lords have just horse-traded Sarah to Walling."</p>

<p>The news didn't disturb him. "That's been coming."</p>

<p>"A fourteen-year-old girl marrying a man of thirty&mdash;a child
marrying an old man."</p>

<p>"She's old enough," he said. "It's not uncommon. As for Walling,
if he's an old man at thirty, what am I?" He sat up to the table
ready to enjoy his meal. She took her place across from him,
astonished that such a thing made no impression on him.</p>

<p>She said, "Would you have wanted me to be married at
fourteen?"</p>

<p>"That's a different thing. You've had some education. The man
you marry will have some education. You'll want somebody who'll get
on in the community, who'll wash his face before he comes to
supper, who'll pull back your chair for you. But Sarah's not got
those prospects. She's out of the Missouri backwoods. Not one of
her ancestors ever learning to read or write; not one of them ever
rising to a house made out of boards. This marriage will be the
best ever made in her family. She'll be a thousand times better off
than her people, and her children will get a chance she never
had."</p>

<p>"She'll be a drudge," said Rose Ann&mdash;"and worn out at
twenty."</p>

<p>Her father, usually so quick with his sympathies, sat back to
give her his smiling tolerance. "We've all got to work and wear
out&mdash;Sarah in one thing, you in another."</p>

<p>Then, still smiling, he added, "Sarah, marrying at fourteen, is
the common thing. You, single at twenty, are the exception."</p>

<p>She wondered how much he worried about her singleness, and from
that she began to think of herself, for a little while forgetting
Sarah. She rose to do the dishes, and a slight fear came to her
because she was growing old and no man had yet appealed to her,
though men had looked upon her and would have asked if she had
encouraged them. Her father went to his rocker, slowly swaying it
across the squeaky board on the floor. Sarah came back to Rose
Ann's mind and when she had finished the dishes she left the house
and walked along the pathway toward the riverbank.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
A big bonfire burned close by Hawley MacBride's saw pits. As she
came nearer she saw him standing on a log, trimming it with a
broadax into a square timber to be used in somebody's building. By
day, with a hired man, he stood at one of the pits and sawed out
the boards which furnished such lumber as this town had; by night,
with his hired man gone, he lighted his fire and worked late on
timbers. The swinging of the ax was like him, unhurried, regular
and patient; he was young and quietly stubborn in his persistent
laboring.</p>

<p>Having her thoughts on Sarah, she went by him without speaking.
Children were shouting through the shadows, to remind her that
Sarah, passing from the drudgery of the Lord house to the drudgery
of Walling's house, missed this fun which was hers by right of
childhood. No youth for her, no running through shadows, no free
girlhood, no knowing ever what it was like to have the eyes of a
young man come to her with a message, no dreaming, no
foolishness&mdash;nothing but being old forever.</p>

<p>Mist came down upon the river, raw and strong, and water lapped
against the muddy bluff at her feet. Hawley MacBride's ax ceased
its metal ringing and in a moment she heard him whetting the edge
of the blade with a stone. She turned to the fire and watched him
make a few tentative strokes to test the sharpness of the ax, each
light stroke rolling thin shavings from the log. He put the ax
aside, lighted his pipe and sat down on the timber for a little
talk, his smile coming across the fire. Black hair, with a single
rolling curl to it that any woman might envy, dropped against his
forehead.</p>

<p>"Do you know Sarah's going to marry Walling?" she asked. "It's a
shameful thing." He puttered at his pipe, clearly trying to
understand what she meant. By the firelight his face cast off a
bronze shadowing, his lips made a long roll, his eyes flashed
against the blaze. He shook his head. "Guess she doesn't think so,
or her people."</p>

<p>He was like her father; he could not see what she saw. She stood
still and for a moment wondered if she were wrong; but the distaste
would not die. "She's a little girl, anxious to be a woman. This
flatters her. She doesn't really know what it means. Of course her
folks would like to see her married. They're poor and Walling's got
land and money."</p>

<p>"It's their affair. Not yours and mine." She said, "It's like a
Siwash Indian selling his daughter for a string of beads."</p>

<p>He watched her with a sobering, steady attention, slowly drawing
on his pipe, his big hands idle across his knees. "Maybe," he said.
"But it won't do to interfere."</p>

<p>"You'd interfere if you saw a man trying to kill another man,
wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>He brushed that remark aside with instant common sense. "Not the
same. No man consents to being killed. But Sarah's consented to be
married."</p>

<p>"The kind of consent you can buy with a bag of candy. She
doesn't know."</p>

<p>He rose from the timber and tapped out the smoke from his pipe.
He put his hands behind his back and looked into the fire,
challenged by what she had said. He brought up his glance, not with
the expression he had worn before, but with a direct interest in
her. "It troubles you, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>She said, "If Lord had a job, maybe he'd think better of letting
her get married."</p>

<p>"That's just hoping," he said.</p>

<p>"It's got to be stopped."</p>

<p>"People live their own way. Maybe it's not such a good way but
it's theirs and that's their business."</p>

<p>She was distressed that he wouldn't see, and instinct to protect
Sarah grew stronger. "She's got the right to grow up and be free a
while before she turns into Walling's slavey. She's got the right
to have a man look at her with something nice in his eyes. I can't
bear to think of this marriage. It's indecent."</p>

<p>"It does trouble you," he said.</p>

<p>"It does," she said, and turned away. Half the distance toward
her cabin she looked behind, not hearing his ax resume its
chopping; he stood at the fire with his hands still behind him, the
firelight making his large shoulders larger. He was a high,
impressive shape against the darkness; he was a block of solidness
reassuring to look upon, and she looked upon him a long moment
before continuing her way homeward.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
MacBride's fire lost its yellow glow and became a dull redness
against the earth; he had a notion to go on working, but the
thought wasn't good and he turned toward Billy Ashford's but at the
far end of the settlement.</p>

<p>Half a dozen men were in the place when he arrived, other
bachelors gathered for a little talk before the day was done, and
Rose Ann's father and Hobart Walling. A jug of blue ruin stood on
the table with a few tin cups. MacBride poured and drank his tot,
stood a moment to get the hang of the conversation and sat down in
the corner, wedging his shoulders between two other men.</p>

<p>He let the talk roll around him, while he gave some thought to
Hobart Walling. The man's short body carried considerable power in
it, heavy muscles with short spans to them; he had a flushed face
slightly marked by smallpox, and there were pale scars on the high
edge of his forehead, no doubt from the rough-and-tumble fights in
the past. He was an energetic creature; even now his vitality made
him restless. He said to Billy Ashford, "How much you pay for this
liquor?"</p>

<p>"Couple dollars a gallon."</p>

<p>"Well, it's not bad."</p>

<p>"Hell," said Ashford, "it's terrible. I'm surprised at your
judgment."</p>

<p>"A drink's a drink," said Walling.</p>

<p>The talk turned to cougars in the hills behind the town. It
swung from cougars to food, and from food to the coming of
Christmas. MacBride hung his hands over his doubled knees and idly
massaged his knuckles. The drink did him good. He dropped his head
and closed his eyes, listening to Walling's voice.</p>

<p>Billy Ashford said, "Hear you're going to get married,
Hobart."</p>

<p>"Sunday."</p>

<p>"I'll be glad when a few more women get into this country," said
Ashford.</p>

<p>"You can pick up a good squaw any time," said Walling.</p>

<p>There was a small silence, which Ashford presently filled with
his most casual question: "You had one a couple years ago. What
happened to her?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Walling, putting it aside as a thing of no
consequence, "I sent her back to her people."</p>

<p>MacBride opened his eyes and gave Walling a closer glance. The
silence went on, and Walling, feeling it, stared around the group.
His eyes closed down somewhat. He said briefly, "Nothing unusual
about it. A lot of men have done it." His glance stopped on
MacBride and he said, with a lift to his tone, "What's wrong about
it?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't said," replied MacBride.</p>

<p>"Well, then, let's not discuss it."</p>

<p>"I'm not," said MacBride. He got up from his crowded corner.
"Billy, it was a good drink. When that jug runs out, I'll buy the
next gallon." He took time to fill and light his pipe at the
candle, the light dancing against his eyes, making them sparkle;
and then he ducked his head beneath the low doorway and left
Ashford's. He went on slowly, mouth puckered around the pipe stem,
his head down and his hands behind him. At the fork of the pathway
he paused a moment and then he turned toward the Lord cabin.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
After breakfast, with the house swept, Rose Ann took her bucket
down the trail to a small meadow beyond the settlement and milked
the cow. A third of the milk she poured into skim pans and set them
out to cool on the covered shelf; the rest of it she divided into
three small buckets, one for the Ballards, one for the Snows, one
for the Lords. These were the latest arrivals in the settlement and
therefore the poorest. Setting out to deliver the pails, she looked
toward the river and saw MacBride already working at the saw pits.
He stood above a log on one of the pits, guiding a long crosscut
through the log while some man, not seen by her, stood down in the
pit beneath the log at the other end of the saw. She noticed that
there was a crew at the second pit this morning; he had found extra
workers.</p>

<p>She delivered her last pail to Mrs. Lord, who was working up
bread, surrounded by five of her younger children. "I don't know
what I'd do without milk, Rose Ann. It's good to have neighbors.
Lord's working now. Hawley MacBride hired him for the saw pit. Now
then, if his health don't break down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with his health?" asked Rose Ann.</p>

<p>"Always been a frail man, strong as he looks. His energy just
runs out."</p>

<p>Rose Ann walked to the doorway and looked across the clearing to
Hawley MacBride on the saw-pit log. Her eyelids almost touched as
she watched his body swinging up and down with the saw, and her
mouth softened. She spoke over her shoulder: "Now that he's
working, maybe you won't want Sarah to be married so young."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with it?" asked Mrs. Lord in surprise.
"She's got a fine chance."</p>

<p>Rose Ann turned about. "Mrs. Lord, is Sarah in love with
him?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lord straightened from her chore and laid a hand against
her side to contain some brief twitch of pain. She was not so dull
and indifferent as she seemed, Rose Ann decided; her face became
strong and wideawake. "That will do for thinkin', but we got to be
practical. Maybe your father can support you while you do your
dreamin'. We're too poor for that. Sarah's got to do the best she
can."</p>

<p>Rose Ann dropped her glance, embarrassed at the expression on
Mrs. Lord's face. Sarah was bent over a washtub in the yard, her
straw-colored hair coming down over a face freckled and pointed and
plain. Rose Ann went over. Sarah's hands were red and her bones
were poorly clad with flesh; she needed so much time to fill
herself with things which would glow out of her and stain her
features with maturity. It was hard to know much about a girl of
fourteen&mdash;where the child left off and the woman began. Rose
Ann tried to remember back to when she was fourteen, but she
couldn't quite revive that time. She said, "Sarah&mdash;what will
you call him? Hobart?"</p>

<p>Sarah said, "Oh, no. That would be like calling my father by his
first name. I'll call him Mr. Walling."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Rose Ann went back home to cut up a piece of beef and put it into
the big iron pot. She peeled her potatoes and onions to go into the
stew later; she cleaned the churn and poured into it the
accumulated cream, and sat on a chair with the churn between her
knees, operating the dasher up and down with a vigorous, steady
stroke. She couldn't get Sarah out of her mind. It was so strange
to her that she stood alone, that nobody else saw it as she saw it.
Was she a queer old maid?</p>

<p>She thought about that and then she remembered that Hawley
MacBride had hired Lord and she thought with some surprise: Why, I
did make him understand a little bit.</p>

<p>She turned the butter and spent half an hour kneading it. She
added the vegetables to the stew and finished off the butter into
pretty bricks stamped with an oak leaf. She had dinner ready for
her father when he came in at noon, and later washed the dishes and
straightened the house again. The afternoon came, and she stood at
the window, watching the people of the settlement move around at
their various chores. She saw the gray clouds rolling over the sky
and the dull afternoon's glitter on the wet green trees; she saw
Hobart Walling come up from the river and go into Lord's&mdash;and
very suddenly she hated the man with a great intensity. She got her
light shawl and walked directly to Mrs. Ellenwood's.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ellenwood was a gentlewoman who had followed a restless
husband out of a comfortable New York home to this land of mud and
dust. She had made the best of it. The two rooms of her small frame
house were wonderfully peaceful with their rag rugs, with the rose
dishes so carefully brought over the plains, and with the snowwhite
curtains and waxed maple chairs. She was a tall woman, still pretty
at forty, and her charm made Rose Ann feel quite young. Mrs.
Ellenwood occupied a rocker in her afternoon hour of leisure and
knitting. She might have been a great lady in a mansion, for that
was the air of the room at this moment. "Take a chair, Rose
Ann."</p>

<p>"I'm out of the notion to be peaceful. It's Sarah that troubles
me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ellenwood considered Rose Ann. "You have got a very firm
look on your face. I have been trying to think of a useful wedding
gift for Sarah. She needs so much to start with."</p>

<p>"It's wrong," said Rose Ann. "Don't you think it is?"</p>

<p>"The girl seems to want to do it."</p>

<p>"To a man more than twice as old. She oughtn't think of any
marriage yet."</p>

<p>"Well, many women have married that early&mdash;some to old men
and some to men they couldn't rightly say they loved. I do observe
most of these marriages turn out well."</p>

<p>"No," said Rose Ann, disappointed in this woman she so greatly
admired. "I can't believe it. It's wrong."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ellenwood fell silent, and looked through the window,
gentle regret on her face. She gave Rose Ann a faint smile. "It's
because you can dream. There are so many girls who can't dream.
They take a man and make the best of it. That's Sarah. Suppose you
talked her out of it. It would be another man next year&mdash;maybe
one not so well provided. What have you done to her then? I
wouldn't risk changing her life. She's plain, she's poor, she's
never known anything but work and dirt. She wouldn't even
understand what you're talking about."</p>

<p>"She needs a chance to know," said Rose Ann. "She should go to
school and grow up. Then she can choose a man."</p>

<p>"How will she get a chance to do this? Her parents won't do it
for her."</p>

<p>"I will," said Rose Ann. "I'll take her in and raise her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ellenwood shook her head. "You do surprise me. But, Rose
Ann, you can't talk Lord or his wife out of a son-in-law with
money." She paused, she had something further to say and hesitated
to say it. "You know, Rose Ann, that men run the world. You're a
girl and you've got no power to change men's minds."</p>

<p>"But," said Rose Ann, "a man might help me."</p>

<p>Curiosity was a clear thing on Mrs. Ellenwood's face. "I didn't
know any man interested you."</p>

<p>"I didn't say that," answered Rose Ann swiftly.</p>

<p>A fugitive humor ran along Mrs. Ellenwood's mouth and was at
once suppressed. She said something that was in contradiction with
what she had said before.</p>

<p>"Well, Rose Ann, maybe we're so close to the earth we don't see
the sky. Life's very hard in a new country and people get coarse
sometimes. If it's in your heart to help Sarah, then you've got to
do it."</p>

<p>"That helps me," said Rose Ann, and left the house.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
She stood a moment outside Mrs. Ellenwood's door. The ringing of
the woodchoppers' axes came from the timber, and the "swash-swash"
of Hawley MacBride's saw was an unbroken rhythm. Not many men cared
to work with him at the saw pits, for few of them could stand that
kind of labor. Her eyes narrowed on him, watching his body grow
stiff and broad-shouldered when he straightened. A group of men
stood over by Kerr's store, and another man came sauntering along
to join them&mdash;Hobart Walling. Presently the three went into
the store.</p>

<p>She looked again toward MacBride, and drew a long breath, her
heart beating fast. She thought: "I have got to do it," and went
toward the store with dread in her. It was a hard thing to pass
through the door. She stopped before it with a feeling of weakness.
She looked through the door, seeing Walling and the two men
lounging before the counter. Kerr was behind the counter&mdash;and
all of them were laughing at some joke. She stepped inside. They
quit talking, Kerr giving the others a short warning with his hand.
The talk hadn't been meant for her ears, she understood. She went
on to the counter.</p>

<p>"I should like a spool of thread&mdash;black thread."</p>

<p>The silence of the men was one of those amused, indifferent
silences; they were waiting for her to be done with her buying and
go. She felt Walling's eyes watching her and she turned her head
quickly and caught the sliding, pushing quality of his glance. It
didn't drop; it drove boldly at her.</p>

<p>She said, "What are you staring at, Mr. Walling? Is a woman
strange to you?"</p>

<p>He straightened. "That's no way to talk to a man."</p>

<p>"You're very brave," she said. "That is, before women."</p>

<p>He showed her a deepening color. He looked at the other men and
back at her.</p>

<p>"I've not bothered you," he said shortly. "Go home where you
belong and don't try to break into men's talk."</p>

<p>"You," she said, "are a fat lunk of a creature. Do you ever
shave or ever wash? You smell like a barn. And here you are,
telling me what I ought to do. I shall stay here. You do the
going."</p>

<p>"If I were your father," he said, "I'd teach you your
place."</p>

<p>"You have not that intelligence, Mr. Walling."</p>

<p>Her remark humiliated him before an audience. His instant and
unthinking prejudice flared. "By God, get back to your place before
I take you for another kind of a woman."</p>

<p>She hit him across the face with her hand. He raised his hand
and reached for her, but she stepped aside and hit him again. She
turned swiftly, remembering a stack of ax handles by the door. She
seized one and came back toward him. "Now, then," she said, "do you
mean to lay that grimy paw on me, Mr. Walling?"</p>

<p>He would have done so had not the storekeeper suddenly said,
"That will be all, Walling."</p>

<p>Walling checked himself and gave Rose Ann a killing glance. He
said, "I must take this up with your father. I shall not accept
it.</p>

<p>"If you step into our cabin," she said, "I'll shoot you."</p>

<p>He checked himself quite suddenly; he changed his feelings in
remarkably fast time.</p>

<p>"Now," he said in a complaining voice, "who brought this on
anyhow?" Then he gave the men around him a shake of his head,
carefully circled Rose Ann and left the store.</p>

<p>She had not only offended Hobart Walling, she noticed; she had
also offended Mr. Kerr and the other two men. All men stuck
together&mdash;they said nothing but they created an air that was
thick with disapproval. She picked up her thread, murmuring, "That
will be all, Mr. Kerr," and left the store. Her knees were
trembling and she felt mildly giddy.</p>

<p>She got supper, lighted the candles and turned to the doorway to
wait for her father to turn the trail which came out of the lower
part of town. When he swung into sight she noticed that he walked
faster than usual. He saw her at the door and quickened his pace;
he came on, staring at her with a tight, strict expression on his
face. He went directly through the back way to wash up. She dished
up and took her seat, knowing that he knew, but she said nothing
when he took his place at the table. He helped himself to the meat,
took one taste of it, and laid down his fork.</p>

<p>"Now, then," he said, "what did you say to Walling? Were you
interfering in his affairs?"</p>

<p>"He was impolite. I slapped his face. Try the greens. I fixed
them with grandmother's sauce."</p>

<p>"Rose Ann," said her father, "did you threaten him with a gun if
he came around here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Rose Ann.</p>

<p>"My God, that's for me to do, not for you. Now I shall have to
demand an apology from him. You're certain&mdash;"</p>

<p>The door was still open, with somebody standing in it. Talbot
lifted his glance, taking care to erase the fretfulness he had
displayed. He said cheerfully, "Come in, Hawley."</p>

<p>Rose Ann sat quite still, startled; she didn't look around until
Hawley MacBride spoke to her. "Rose Ann," he said, "did you say
anything to Walling about Sarah?"</p>

<p>She said, "I do wonder at all this excitement. No. He was
impolite and I slapped him. Now that I think of it, I wish I'd
slapped him again."</p>

<p>"Dammit," said Talbot, "you ought not become publicly involved
with a man."</p>

<p>"Then," said Hawley MacBride, "he looked wrong at you and was
impolite when you mentioned it?"</p>

<p>"That's what it was," said Rose Ann. "Is there a law which stops
a woman from protecting herself against a man?"</p>

<p>Hawley MacBride said, "Maybe there ought to be a law protecting
a man from a woman," and left the cabin.</p>

<p>"Rose Ann," complained her father, "I've got to go do a
disagreeable job directly after supper. You ought to bear that in
mind when you fight a man. Some other man has got to take care of
it."</p>

<p>"Enjoy your supper first," said Rose Ann...</p>

<p>Last seen, Hobart Walling bad been traveling in the direction of
Billy Ashford's cabin; and that was where MacBride found him,
sitting on a corner box in the little place while Ashford threw
together some kind of supper. He was crouched over with his pipe, a
good drink of blue ruin giving him cheer and appetite; he looked up
with a lively attention when MacBride stepped into the cabin, and
noted the gray sparkling in MacBride's eyes. He laid his pipe
carefully aside and rose from the box. He looked around him for
elbow room; he squared himself. MacBride stepped across the room,
lifting both arms, nodding his warning at the other man. Walling
grumbled, "The hell with you," and swung out with his fists.</p>

<p>"Get out of my cabin to do that!" shouted Ashford.</p>

<p>He ducked, put one foot in the fireplace, and clawed his way
aside from the two stamping men. Hawley MacBride knocked down
Walling's arms. He missed a blow and hit Walling with his chest. He
threw out his hand and took Walling under the chin, snapping back
the man's neck. Walling seized the table and tried to lift it, but
MacBride tore it out of his hands and flung it aside, tin dishes,
crockery jug and utensils and all coming down as a jangling rain on
the floor. Walling laid his back against the cabin wall and
punched. He lifted his booted leg and rammed it outward. MacBride
shifted his narrow hips, came in and struck Walling on the chin.
Walling rolled his head and slid to the floor.</p>

<p>"Damned long time messing around with it," said MacBride.</p>

<p>Ashford came back into the cabin, cursing both of them. "It's a
hell of a way to treat a man."</p>

<p>"Certainly is," said MacBride. "But this is private, and we
won't need to say much about it."</p>

<p>"The hell I won't."</p>

<p>MacBride turned a thoughtful eye on Ashford. "No,
Billy&mdash;just don't."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;all right," said Ashford.</p>

<p>Walling got up from the floor and put both hands across his face
as though he were washing away the fog.</p>

<p>"Hobart," said MacBride, "if you talk rough to one woman, you
might talk rough to another. Just begin to walk&mdash;and don't
stop at the Lords' on your way. If you make another stab to marry
Sarah, or if you tell anybody why you changed your mind, I'll just
come find you and lick hell right out of you."</p>

<p>Walling said in a jaded wonder, "What started all this? My God,
I never did anything."</p>

<p>MacBride grinned. "You just ran into opposition." He left the
cabin, the grin breaking into one small chuckle as he turned
homeward.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Rose Ann did the dishes while her father left to discharge his
dismal chore. He soon returned with the news, astonished by
MacBride's act. He was, Rose Ann observed, relieved that he had not
had to call Hobart Walling to account, yet he was also piqued that
another man had taken the duty from him. "What's MacBride got to do
with this?"</p>

<p>Rose Ann smiled, "I couldn't say."</p>

<p>She unpinned her apron and gave herself a glance in the mirror.
She touched up her hair, she studied her face, she straightened her
shoulders. As she left the house, she dropped a new notion behind
her: "The Lords are very poor. They need help. I want Sarah to stay
with us and go to school." She went out of the door before her
father had time to answer. It was always better to let men think
about things awhile.</p>

<p>MacBride's bonfire burned against the sooty shadows and he stood
on another log, chipping it into a timber with his ax. He had his
pipe in his mouth and by the yellowing light his face looked
forbidding. He showed no scars from the fight She paused beside the
blaze, well knowing that he was aware of her presence even though
he ignored her and went on with that precise, light ax work. She
spread her hands before the fire and was content; he would be
thinking of what he wanted to say to her.</p>

<p>He reached the end of the log and straightened. He looked at
her. He gave the ax a mighty swing and buried it in the log and
stepped down. He filled his pipe and got a coal to light it. He
stood across the fire, giving her the full fretful weight of his
glance.</p>

<p>"Woman," he said, "you just naturally played hell to have your
way. You took advantage of Walling to get into a quarrel. You got
insulted deliberately and you used me to pay off the insult, and
now you've got the marriage killed, as you wanted."</p>

<p>She said, "You told him to leave Sarah alone?"</p>

<p>His answer came out slowly: "I told him."</p>

<p>"Do you think he'll mind you, Hawley?"</p>

<p>"He'll mind me."</p>

<p>"That's nice," she said, and showed him her pleased relief.</p>

<p>He shook his head, shocked by the implications of her act. "It
was a fine piece of scheming," he said, "and no doubt you now know
you can put a man at your mercy any time you please. Great stars,
if you're going to be a meddling woman you can have everybody in
this settlement shootin' at one another. It won't do, Rose Ann, and
I'll not have it."</p>

<p>"It was wicked," she agreed. "I shan't do it again, unless my
spirit just boils over."</p>

<p>"Why," he asked, "did you pick on me to do your fighting?"</p>

<p>"Because," she said, pleasantly matter-of-fact with her answer,
"you're the only one who can whip him."</p>

<p>He frowned at her. "Don't do it again." She met the frown with
her agreeable expression; she folded her hands before her. He
watched her and he lost his soberness. "Well," he said, "I can't
say I didn't enjoy the chance to rough him. The man's a hog. But we
can't be doing that all the time, Rose Ann. It's no way to get
along."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "it isn't. We only do that when people won't
take care of meanness any other way." She made a little gesture;
she spoke with a quiet intensity: "What's strength for if not to
use to make things right? And this just wasn't right. It's nice you
hired Lord."</p>

<p>"Lord," he said, "is no good. He won't work. A man's entitled to
a chance, but no man's entitled to loaf while others feed him. It's
not charity to support a man who's able to support himself."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "you gave him the chance. I'm going to take
Sarah into my house. She'll come, and the Lords will be willing.
Now she'll get the chance to grow, and she'll have time to find a
man that looks at her in the right way."</p>

<p>He watched her with an attention so close that she finally
lowered her glance to the fire. He said, "Maybe we get too rough
around here; maybe we forget how things ought to be. It's a
settlement full of men, and men do get careless in the way they
live. I've thought about that."</p>

<p>Suddenly she put a hand to her mouth. "Lordy, I clean forgot to
milk the cow tonight." She turned from the fire, but she paused a
moment in seeming thought. It was a suggestive pause, which worked
well. Hawley MacBride reached for a coal to relight his pipe and
turned carelessly toward her.</p>

<p>"I'll walk over there with you."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't want to stop you from your work."</p>

<p>"I have thought about that lately, too. I work enough. It has
occurred to me that solitary work is like solitary drinking. It's
not good."</p>

<p>She said, in her nicest tone, "Well, it's something to think
about, I suppose," and went with him along the trail. Somewhere in
the misting night a cowbell sent out its lengthened and subdued
strokes of sound.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. Good Marriage</h2>

<p>At evenfall this Saturday, with supper done and the soft
sweet-smelling shadows of summer drifting against the prairie like
gray gauze, neighbors began to come in. The Hurds were the original
homesteaders on the Silver Bow's south rim, having settled this
quarter section at a time when the cattlemen still made it
dangerous for a nester, and so it was natural that the Hurd house
should be more or less a gathering point. In any event Sam Hurd,
who loved a sociable evening and loud argument better than most
men, usually had a keg of beer cooling in the well and this was a
powerful inducement to the lean, dry and clannish Missourian
settlers&mdash;the Gants, the Lockyears, the Cobbetts and the
Prillifews.</p>

<p>The children were all outside, running through the shadows,
their quick-issued cries riding the night. Men sat around the room,
chairs canted back against the wall, and the women were together at
one end, now and then speaking among themselves, but always
listening with half an ear to the talk of the men. Tobacco smoke
laid its pall around them, so thick that the table lamp cast a
mist-blue shadow; the smell of fried pork lingered in the house and
the warmth of the day held on. Mrs. Prillifew's new baby began to
cry; she unbuttoned the front of her dress and slid it down from
one shoulder, uncovering her nipple to let the baby nurse; its
small mouth made a steady, smacking sound.</p>

<p>Lisbeth Hurd moved over the room, straight and large-breasted
and robust; at twenty she was the oldest of the Hurd children,
pretty enough to bring the eyes of men around to her with a covert
interest. She took Cobbett's empty glass, refilled it at the beer
keg and passed it back to him; and stood by the beer keg, watching
the men and indifferently listening. The sludge of Henry Zimmer's
pipe began to fry. He reversed the bowl against his heavy hand,
emptying it and refilling it. Henry Zimmer was one of the Hurds'
two boarders. Bob Law, sitting longlegged in the doorway, was the
other. Both these young men were building shanties on new quarter
section claims across the deep canyon on the Silver Bow.</p>

<p>Lisbeth Hurd watched Henry Zimmer's square face glisten when the
lighted match played across the pipe bowl; nothing hurried this man
and nothing much moved him. Talk broke around her, idle and
cheerful, and slowly her glance turned to Bob Law in the doorway.
Bob Law nursed a cigarette, his head dipped aside as though he
listened to the night or saw pictures on the far prairie; the
silhouette of his face was long and taciturn and sharp. Studying
him, Lisbeth's expression was tight-caught by soberness, her eyes
had a depthless dark in them, her shoulders moved faintly.</p>

<p>Sam Hurd, who never was able to speak in a tone less than a
half-shout, said: "It don't do no good to grow a lot of fruit. A
man's only got so much time and it don't make sense to waste it
waterin' a lot of trees. You got to raise things in this country
that can shift for themselves, or you break your back."</p>

<p>Henry Zimmer spoke up, dogmatic and calm. "I grow hay, when I
get started. I grow hay and feed stock. I run a feeder ranch, like
they do in Iowa. Maybe I try corn."</p>

<p>Sam Hurd listened approvingly. This young man was after his own
tastes, thrifty and marked for success. Down the road they heard
the steady clip-clop of a trotting horse, whereupon Sam Hurd said:
"Who was that I heard goin' by here two o'clock the other morning
in a rig?"</p>

<p>Cobbett answered: "Bill Shasto, bringin' Nellie Grace home.
Nellie told her old man they had trouble crossin' the ford."</p>

<p>Sam Hurd let out a great burst of laughter and all of these men
were grinning, knowing Nellie Grace. Hurd said: "She better marry
Shasto before the baby comes along."</p>

<p>"Like Pete Root's wife," offered Prillifew. "Pete still claims
it ain't his boy."</p>

<p>"Whut should he care for?" countered Sam Hurd. "It's one more
boy, for chores." He swiggled the beer around his glass, pleased
with the smoke and the warmth and the comfort of neighbors;
suddenly he reached forward with his broad hand and hit Lisbeth
across the hips. "Lisbeth, there's a thought for you. Get your man
to take you out in a buggy."</p>

<p>Lisbeth turned her dark eyes on her father, unstirred and
unembarrassed. "What man?"</p>

<p>"My God," said Hurd, "you got the choice of anybody on
prairie."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hurd's voice was a steady tone on the edge of all this.
"You parboil it fifteen minutes, change to a little fresh water and
add the kraut." While she talked her eyes watched Lisbeth
carefully, seeing Lisbeth's glance swing and stop on Bob Law at the
doorway. "The flavor comes from not leavin' the kraut on the stove
too long."</p>

<p>The clip-clop of hoofs died in the yard and an assured young
man, sandy-haired and smiling and dressed in neat townsman's
clothes, picked his way across Bob Law's outstretched legs. "I saw
the lights and heard the noise and thought I'd say hello."</p>

<p>This was Cam Skelton, who owned the drygoods store in Prairie
City; and since he was in a way foreign to the slack, comfortable
homestead group, Sam Hurd accorded him the courtesy of rising. Mrs.
Hurd left her chair, pleased and somewhat disturbed at his
presence. "Lisbeth, get Mr. Skelton a glass of beer. You mustn't
mind such an untidy house, Mr. Skelton."</p>

<p>"It is an attractive house, Mrs. Hurd," said Cam Skelton with
his most gallant manners. He paid his respects to the women with an
inclusive statement. "You homestead ladies are the finest
housekeepers in the world."</p>

<p>"We eat well," admitted Sam Hurd. "Had supper?"</p>

<p>Lisbeth moved around Cam Skelton, drew a glass of beer, and
offered it to him. He said, "Thanks, I've eaten, but the beer will
be a pleasure after the ride." He saluted Lisbeth with the glass;
over its rim his eyes held her&mdash;they were quick eyes, round
and bright-colored. From the corner of the room Mrs. Hurd watched
this man, the way he looked at Lisbeth. Talk had ceased in front of
the townsman but he finished his beer and brought the talk alive
again in an easy way. "It has been a good year. No grasshoppers and
no drouth. There's a new settlement going in below town, on the
Sweet Fork. Time will come, Sam, when you settlers will have the
cattlemen pushed back beyond the bench."</p>

<p>"Time will come," said Sam Hurd in his loud, positive voice,
"when we'll pass the laws in this country, and by damn we'll
scrunch them like they have been scrunchin' us."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the beer," said Cam Skelton. He paused a moment,
cool enough to disregard the crowd while he put his glance on
Lisbeth. There was a full interest in him; she saw it as she stood
calmly before him, not showing expression. Presently he ducked his
head at the group and left the house. Silence held on until the
pacing of his horse softened in the distance. Then Sam Hurd said:
"As for corn, Henry, the Ioway kind won't do out here. We got to
get a seed that will stand dry weather. Well, it will come." Talk
rose up again and the tobacco smoke blurred everything.</p>

<p>Lisbeth drew a glass of beer and moved to the doorway. She stood
there, looking down at Bob Law until his face lifted. She said,
"Beer?" and watched him take it and look away. The top of his head
was dyeblack; there was a scar on his cheek, which was part of his
past&mdash;from a horse or a man or from a woman. She didn't know.
He was a cowpuncher who had ridden out of the hills to take up a
quarter section and the way of his life had left him taciturn. He
wasn't at all like the practical, heavy, loudspeaking homestead
men. He was loosejointed and narrow-hipped from riding; he was an
easy swinging man but at times he moved with an astonishing
swiftness; something was inside of him, hard and intense and
strange. But it was well covered. The open front of his shirt
showed the bronzebrown skin of his chest.</p>

<p>The Prillifew baby was again mewling and it was time for the
settlers to leave. They went away, family by family in their rigs,
the children's backward calling riding the moonless night in
undulating, long-sustained bars of sound. Bob Law had gone on to
the corral. Idly following, Lisbeth put her shoulders to the corral
bars, looking up at him. He didn't seem to see her; he stared into
the black sweep of the prairie, he was listening to its vague
voices and its silence. But she knew he was aware of her; it was
something in the set of his body, in his stillness.</p>

<p>"Where'd you come from, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Off there," he said, pointing at the hills. He had the brief
and flat tone of a man who didn't use his voice much. In the dark
she saw his face come down to her and felt the sudden roughness of
his eyes. He said, "Good night," moving away to the small tent at
the edge of the corral. She watched the lantern light spring up;
she watched his shadow turn and crook as he undressed and saw it
stand straight for a moment. Then the light died and a little later
she caught the thin smell of a cigarette; he would be lying on the
cot, smoking in the dark.</p>

<p>Lisbeth returned to the house to catch up the beer glasses and
straighten the chairs. The children had started to bed and Henry
Zimmer had gone up to the spare room. She heard his boots hit the
floor, one and then another, and the groaning of the bedsprings as
he settled down. This would be all the sound from that room; he
would sleep the night through, without motion, his heavy snoring
making a steady echo through the house.</p>

<p>Sam Hurd said in a tone that was, for him, extremely mild:
"Henry's a damned smart young Dutchman. There's your man, Lisbeth.
He'll make a fine farm."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hurd said, "Ah," in a dissenting tone. She stood by the
table, not speaking again until Sam Hurd slowly retreated to the
corner bedroom. Afterwards she added: "Not him, Lisbeth. You've got
plenty of choice. You make a good marriage. Look at me. I had no
choice. I ain't sorry, I ain't complaining, but you got things
different. You don't have to be a farmer's wife. You can choose.
Why do you think Cam Skelton came here? You could live in town and
drive your own rig. You could dress like those women do. You make a
good marriage. You got the chance&mdash;just once you've got
it."</p>

<p>In her room, beside the kitchen, Lisbeth undressed and got into
her white nightgown and stood in the room's center, braiding back
her hair. Her father's and mother's voices came from the corner of
the house as a steady murmur, and died, and silence closed in. She
blew out the lamp, opened the side door and stood in the velvet
density of the night. There was a faint wind rising off the
prairie; it ran softly along her body. When she leaned against the
pump handle, its metal coolness was sharp against her breasts. From
this porch she watched the black outline of Bob Law's tent,
thinking intimately of him; and retreated to her room.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>She stood in the yard, after breakfast, watching Law and Henry
Zimmer saddle their horses. Henry had a solid plug, broad of beam
and meant for the plow; it was an animal Law always looked upon
with a faint show of irony, for his own pony was range bred and a
little bit tricky on these fresh mornings, crowhopping around the
dirt with Law sitting deep and careless in the saddle. When they
passed down the trail into the Silver Bow canyon she noticed that
Law had forgotten his lunch; but she didn't call him back. It was
four miles across the canyon to where these two had their adjoining
quarter sections; she would take the lunch to Law later. Back in
the house she put the lunch on the side table and had her own
breakfast with her mother and the smaller children.</p>

<p>Her mother said: "I want you to go to town. I need some long
straight pins and five yards of gingham, red check, and a spool of
white thread." She looked at her daughter carefully. "Wear your
gray dress; it don't muss up in the sidesaddle." When Lisbeth was
in the saddle and ready to go, her mother came out to give her two
silver dollars and another critical survey. "You look well. You've
got a way. Maybe it is a little bit like the way of women who don't
live on farms. Be nice to him, Lisbeth. It is all you need to
do."</p>

<p>Lisbeth said softly: "How nice?"</p>

<p>"A woman must think about these things. You want to make a good
marriage. For some men, like Zimmer who is dumb, you can be
forward. For some you can't. It is something you must find out for
yourself, when you see what's on his face."</p>

<p>This was why she was being sent to town, Lisbeth knew; to be
nice to Cam Skelton. The thread and gingham and pins were just
extra. She went swinging down the road, with the blur of Prairie
City in the distance. Dust rose behind her in a long pale diffused
cloud, shutting out the view of the ranch. Across the Silver Bow
canyon she saw the thin dots of two riders, which would be Law and
Henry Zimmer splitting off to their claims. High on the southern
ridge cattlemen raised dust with a driven herd and the sun was the
bright half-hot sun of late September.</p>

<p>There were ways with men, as her mother had said. One way was
Nellie Grace's way. For men like Shasto and Zimmer and many others,
it was the quick and easy way to catch a man; but for Cam Skelton
it would only shame her before him, for Skelton was a townsman with
different thoughts. A woman could only hint, and not be common.
These things Lisbeth Hurd knew; it was a knowledge that came out of
some obscure place, to make her wise, to make her look upon the
world with cool eyes. But then she thought of Bob Law and was not
sure. For he was another kind of man; there was something in him,
like a dream, like a picture. There were words for this but she did
not know them, could not find them. He saw things in the sky, he
felt things through the shadows that others did not.</p>

<p>Prairie City's street was a gray lane of dust between a long
double row of stiff paintless buildings; wagons and horsemen moved
along it as she passed on to the drygoods store, racked the horse
and stepped into the cool twilight of Cam Skelton's store. She
heard Skelton's voice before she saw him. It was the quick, rising
voice of a pleased man. He came out of the rear shadows, his round
eyes aware of her.</p>

<p>She said: "Some long pins, some white thread&mdash;and five
yards of gingham, red checked pattern."</p>

<p>He had a light way with his talk. He said, "What's in you
anyway, Lisbeth? I wish I knew." He touched her hand. "Be easier if
I did."</p>

<p>"Checked pattern," she said and let her hand drop.</p>

<p>Afterwards, having bought these things, she waited for her
change. This store was still and fragrant and empty. Cam Skelton's
steps made queer softened echoes in it. She thought of her mother's
advice with a distant interest, and watched Cam Skelton come back.
He put the change in her hand, and took her hand. "If I brought a
rig around tonight, Lisbeth, would you ride?"</p>

<p>"No-o," she said, "not tonight."</p>

<p>"Some night?"</p>

<p>"Some night," she said and made her small smile for him. She was
a well-shaped girl, graceful even in this motionless attitude, with
her mouth softened by the smile and her eyes meeting him
coolly.</p>

<p>He said at once, "You don't need to run away from a man,
Lisbeth," and brought his hands up. He touched her shoulders and
then she felt his resolution and his sudden change of temper as he
pulled her toward him. The brightness had gone out of his eyes;
they were rough-gray and full of a thing clear to her. She didn't
know why, but she struck his arms down and hit him in the chest and
went by him, angry enough to kill him. He called in an irritated
voice: "Wait," and she paused at the door and swung around. He came
up to her, his pride stung. Suddenly he was a little man, small of
wrist and shoulder, smelling of his own store; and in this
critical, outraged light she looked at him, and spoke her mind.
Across the street stood the saloon with its second-story windows
showing green drawn shades&mdash;hiding the women who lived there.
She said: "If that's the way you feel, go over there&mdash;above
the saloon."</p>

<p>He said: "That's a hell of a thing for a girl to say. I guess I
judged you wrong. What did you come here for anyway? Just for
eighty cents' worth of goods?"</p>

<p>She marched out, with the package under her arm, stepped to the
sidesaddle and ran out of town, still angered. But halfway home she
suddenly smiled to herself. It was nice to know she had a woman's
attractiveness. It helped; it made her feel something she hadn't
felt before. Maybe he was wrong about her&mdash;but maybe he
wasn't. What was a woman? What was she when she looked at Bob Law
and had her own warm thoughts? What was she when the wind blew its
strong wild smells down from the benchlands and stirred her heart;
when she walked through the dark earth's shadows and felt the
strength of her body like a heavy weight? There was no sign of this
on her face; she was an idle girl swinging to the pace of the
horse, color soft on her cheeks and a stamped gravity in her
eyes.</p>

<p>She stepped off in the yard before her mother, who said eagerly:
"Maybe you asked him out to supper?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I never thought of that." She went by her
mother, caught up Bob Law's lunch, and returned to the horse.</p>

<p>"Maybe he said he'd come to see you?" said Mrs. Hurd.</p>

<p>"No," said Lisbeth, "he never did," and trotted down the canyon
trail.</p>

<p>From the height of the rim the river was an urgent, winding
streak far below, held in by the gray and yellow canyon walls; at
the bottom of the canyon she crossed a shallow gravel ford, passed
through a little cluster of willows and rose slowly to the south
rim. Before her lay the sage-covered flats, running far to the
empty north, directly ahead stood Henry Zimmer's fresh homestead
shanty, its raw boards yellow in the sunlight; a half mile to the
left stood Bob Law's house. Threading the sage as she went that
way, she flushed slow-hopping jack rabbits from covert. Coming
nearer she saw the pile of dirt mounded near the house, which was
from the well he was digging. At intervals he appeared from the
well, hauled up a bucket of dirt, dumped it, and disappeared in the
well again.</p>

<p>She turned the horse over to the well and sat in the saddle,
watching. He was twenty feet down, loosening the soil with a
shorthandled pick and dumping it into the bucket; he had a ladder
rigged against the well wall, and when the bucket was full, he
climbed out and windlassed up the bucket; it was the hard way of
digging a well&mdash;and a little bit dangerous at this depth.</p>

<p>She said: "You forgot your lunch."</p>

<p>He said: "I guess I never gave it a thought. Thanks." He came
over and took the lunch. He was stripped to the waist, his trouser
belt pinched against long flat-muscled flanks. Sweat showed like
oil against the smooth, pale-brown skin and small blurs of dirt lay
on his shoulders; he had a wide chest for so small-waisted a man.
She saw all this, careful to note it; her eyes held a screened
darkness, her expression was steady and solemn. He said again,
"Thanks," and took a quick look at the overhead sun, and sat down
on the dirt pile to eat. He had big knuckles on his hands, and long
fingers; he was slow moving, almost as slow moving as Henry
Zimmer&mdash;but it was a different slowness.</p>

<p>She said: "You never farmed much, did you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "cows are my line."</p>

<p>"What's a cowpuncher doing on a homestead?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I don't know." He sat a moment, thinking of
this in the way he thought of so many things, closely and
narrow-eyed, worrying it around his head. "Maybe it's because a
man's got to put down some roots finally. Nothing for a fellow on
the trail, just a bunch of campfires. One day here, one day
someplace else."</p>

<p>"I guess you've seen a lot of country. That must be nice. What's
it like?"</p>

<p>"Just country," he said. "It ain't ever any different on the
other side of the hill."</p>

<p>"Maybe," she said, "it will be different here."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "I don't know. Maybe."</p>

<p>It was hard to know what he thought or what he felt when he used
that tone. She knew her father and Henry Zimmer&mdash;and now even
Cam Skelton. They were plain to her eyes; but this man was a
stranger; he was not simple to read. Lisbeth reined her pony on to
the new homestead shanty, softly sighing to herself, and got down.
This house sat against the raw earth. There was no porch; only a
single step leading into two small front rooms and a rear kitchen.
The smell of wood was clean and strong and resinous; there was
nothing here at all, only bare, square walls and two windows and
two doors; but she stood in the center of the place,
thinking&mdash;this would be the bedroom. She would bring the rug
for the floor, and the green-dotted curtains. She stood still,
trying to reach into his mind and discover why he had built three
rooms to the house when most men putting up the first homestead
shack only built two.</p>

<p>She moved through the house to the back door. Framed in it, with
her white strong arms stretched against the sides of the door and
her upper body high and rounded and firm, she watched Law dump the
dirt bucket and climb into the well again. He didn't look at her
but she knew that he felt her presence, that he knew how close she
was to him; he had just eaten and now without delay he was working,
as though there was a restlessness he had to wear off. The well was
close to the house and she saw that he had placed it so that
another room and a porch would enclose it. There wasn't a tree for
miles and no shade&mdash;nothing but the sage marching out of the
flats to the very edges of this place; but she saw the square of
poplars around this yard and the garden beyond the well, and the
fruit trees. It would not be so long; it would be nice to watch
them grow. One thing, though. There would have to be a fence along
the edge of the Silver Bow's canyon, to keep the babies from
falling into it. Law climbed from the well again, hauling up the
bucket. The muscles of his back were long and tight against the
brown skin; when he bent over they disappeared and the dotted line
of his spine showed white and broad. She said, "So-long," and
didn't hear him answer; she rode on home across the canyon and fell
to making bread in the warm drowse of the long afternoon, her hands
patting the loaves into shape deftly, her thoughts running away
from her hands.</p>

<p>At four she saw him riding back on the south rim of the canyon,
long before he usually quit work; and stepping out to the rim she
watched him stop in the bottom willows. Presently his body was a
white and distant blur against the water as he took his swim;
later, he rode across the yard. His head was still damp, black and
glittering; and his expression was sharp. He said, "I won't be here
for supper," and sent his pony townward, sitting in the saddle with
that perfect looseness no homesteader could ever match. She watched
him until he was vague in the dust and the low slanting sunlight,
and would have watched longer; but it was time to make supper. At
six Henry Zimmer came out of the canyon, a loose lump on the
faithful plowhorse, and her father walked back from the barn and
the children suddenly ran in from all quarters of the prairie. She
was silent in the supper table's robust racket, close-caught by her
thoughts; she was remembering the little things about Bob Law, the
way he watched the sky, the way he listened into the darkness, and
half through the supper dishes she said, "I am going to town," and
at once left the house to saddle her horse.</p>

<p>Dusk moved softly down; westward the band of light lying over
the mountains began to narrow and lose clarity. At this hour, the
silence was long and deep on the land and all the redolence of the
prairie rose around her; the lights of Prairie City began to
sparkle ahead. In town she dropped off at Wickert's store.</p>

<p>"I want," she said, "a little bottle of perfume. Just a little
bottle."</p>

<p>She paid a dollar for it and was shocked at her extravagance.
Night dropped suddenly and in the doorway of Wickert's she watched
dust boil in the yellow out-thrown beams of the store lights;
shadows made dark banks at wall and alley mouth. Here she stood
when Bob Law came from Mike Danahue's saloon farther along the
street. The glow of the saloon caught him, his whip-shaped frame,
his wide-spread legs and his head bowed beneath the flare of the
broad cowpuncher's hat. He had been drinking. She saw that at once
from the way he braced himself by the door. He turned from the door
and went along the street, reaching out to steady himself by the
saloon wall. At the far corner of the saloon, where the stairway
ran up to the second floor, he stopped and turned toward the
stairs. He didn't move; he just watched them.</p>

<p>Lisbeth got on her horse and went out of town. She wanted to
look back to see if he had gone up the stairs, but she kept her
eyes to the front. She knew him better now, a little better.
Restlessness had driven him into town, to drink; loneliness turned
him to the stairs. She thought about that all the way home. Henry
Zimmer sat in his corner chair, square and speechless and making
sharp little sounds with his lips as he sucked on his pipe; her
father had the weekly paper spread under the table lamp's yellow
cone, reading with a faint motion of his mouth. Lisbeth went on to
her own room closing the door, so that none of them would see the
perfume.</p>

<p>Even with the stopper in the bottle a strong fragrance came out.
She stood in the room's center, watching light turn tawny as it
struck the bottle. She had never owned perfume and it was a little
like sin to have it now. But she was thinking of the differences in
men. A woman might give herself to Henry Zimmer, and get him; she
might hint the same thing to Cam Skelton, and that would be enough.
But not with Bob Law. The things he wanted were mysterious in the
way they came to him&mdash;like the sound of the wind in the sage,
like the sight of a mist cloud breaking on the saw-tooth summits of
the hills; like, maybe, the scent of perfume on a woman's
dress.</p>

<p>She opened the bottle and drew the wet cork once across the
breastline of her waist and stood silent a moment, a lightness like
a smile on her lips. This was to remind him that the faraway things
he wanted were not as far as he thought; then she put the perfume
in the drawer of her bureau and crossed back to the yard.</p>

<p>Half an hour later she saw him ride in and unsaddle his pony. He
wasn't drunk now; he was slow and certain in the way he laid his
shoulders against the corral to make up a cigarette. Matchlight
exploded against his face; it was sharp and still restless. He
didn't move, he didn't look at her&mdash;though she knew he was
aware of her; always she knew that, and it was in her mind to cross
to him when she heard the quick in-drive of two or three ponies
from the dark.</p>

<p>They came rapidly into the yard, three of them, and stopped a
little distance from Bob Law who turned away from the corral to
face them. One of these men said in a cold, steady way:</p>

<p>"Listen, mister. The time ain't come when a granger can walk
into my place, pick a free fight and bust my poker tables all to
hell. There's the little matter of a back bar mirror smashed
likewise. Maybe you took me for a sucker. Well, sir, I've handled
some tough lads in my time and I propose&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was a heavy man and he left the saddle and walked on, his
boots squealing in the yard's dust carpet. Her father came out of
the door and Henry Zimmer came out and her father yelled: "Who's
talkin' like that?" But nobody else said anything. The big man made
the last few feet on the run, grunting as he struck out with his
arms. Lisbeth saw Bob Law's cigarette go to the ground in a shower
of fine sparks, she saw Law wheel backward against the corral bars
and come forward again. These two were close and they were
fighting, the sound of their fists and the sound of their breathing
very plain in the night. The big man knocked Bob Law into the
corral again; he kept going forward, heavy and determined, meaning
to beat Law down. Lisbeth saw Law give ground and stop; he was
swift as he moved, he made a circle around the big man and the big
man's head began to snap back when Bob Law hit him; the big man
said nothing at all but he pushed forward, trying to bring his
knees into Bob Law's crotch. His head kept coming up and after that
he hit nothing, for Bob Law's long arms, outreaching him, caught
him in the belly and in the temples and on the chin; and then the
big man went down.</p>

<p>But one of the others, still mounted, suddenly said: "Just hang
tight there, mister," and looking over that way, Lisbeth saw a gun
pointed at Law. There was a chopping block half across the yard,
with an ax sunk into it. Lisbeth ran over and seized the ax; she
put it over her head and fled across the yard toward the man with
the gun who suddenly said: "Here&mdash;get that damned
girl&mdash;!" But his horse shied away from the downswinging ax and
from the corner of her eyes she saw Bob Law duck into his tent and
come out again.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, "all right."</p>

<p>He was laughing, or so it sounded to Lisbeth. He had gotten his
revolver and held it on the mounted men; it wasn't laughter really,
she saw. He was only smiling, and he was pleased with the fight, he
wanted to fight. A small streak of blood showed on his chin. He
said:</p>

<p>"I guess I've torn up a few saloons in my time, friend. The
trail is full of joints like yours. I think you're a tinhorn. Let's
just see. I'll count five."</p>

<p>The big man pushed himself off the ground. He said, "Wait a
minute. How the hell was I to know you're a cowhand? I thought you
was a nester."</p>

<p>Sam Hurd yelled, "What's the difference?"</p>

<p>The big man said: "If you'd been raised in cattle country you'd
know. The boys have their habits. Just a little fun at the end of a
dreary day. No offense, friend."</p>

<p>Ax in hand, Lisbeth watched these three ride away. Henry Zimmer
hadn't moved from the house doorway. Sam Hurd was swearing, "By
God, whut you do, Bob?" But Bob Law turned back into the tent.</p>

<p>Lisbeth dropped the ax, suddenly following Law. There wasn't any
light in the tent, but the house lamps touched the canvas wall and
by this faded glow she saw him. He sat in a chair, slumped over
with his hands on his face, and when he looked at her she saw only
the weariness of his face. She dropped to her knees and her voice
was quick. "I would have chopped his arm off. I would."</p>

<p>She was close to him, close enough for him to catch the odor of
the perfume, and she knew he caught it. She always knew when he was
aware of her; and he had always been aware of her, never openly
showing it. It was something he seemed to fight against. He sat
there, his long arms idle, not speaking but looking at her with
that same hard set on his cheeks. She knelt back and stood up. Sam
Hurd yelled from the yard, "Lisbeth, what you doing there?"</p>

<p>She said: "It just got weary for you, working alone. So you got
drunk. Then you went to the stairway that goes above the
saloon&mdash;"</p>

<p>He said quickly, "I didn't go up."</p>

<p>"Would it have been a help&mdash;if you had?"</p>

<p>"I didn't go up," he said again.</p>

<p>"So for you it wouldn't have been a help."</p>

<p>The perfume was a faint incense in the tent's warmth. When he
rose from the chair he was a head taller; he looked down, something
changing his look. He said: "I've been too close to you. Not good
for a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Being lonely is like that," she said. "I know what you like to
eat. I know what you like to hear. I guess I've paid attention to
that. I was raised a farm girl. I know what's to be done. You made
three rooms. What's the extra room for, Bob? What woman?"</p>

<p>He said slowly, "Is that all there's to it? Nothing else,
Lisbeth?"</p>

<p>She said, "A house&mdash;with a man and wife in the same bed. It
is something. There is a fire in the stove; it is warm when the
wind blows, and you are not alone. That is something, too. But not
all. The rest&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was smiling when she raised her arms. It was the perfume,
she thought&mdash;the faint call of it, the mystery of the promise
of it&mdash;which brought him forward. Lisbeth raised her head so
that he might not be mistaken about her; and suddenly was within
his tight arms, feeling his kiss. This was it, though it had no
name. Being very full, and feeling that everything was right. A
corner of her mind thought: We will move in when the well is dug. I
will bring the extra dishes. He will never have to worry about the
house, ever, because I will take care of it. But the feeling grew
stronger and fuller, completely crowding her body. She would never
regret the perfume. "Because&mdash;" And she bent back a little to
say in a faint, shy voice: "The rest, the rest is love. That is
it." This was what a good marriage meant.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. Tavern at Powell's Ferry</h2>

<p>The coach rolled southward from the river into the flat valley's
haze with late September's dry dust smoking up from its wheels; and
as it departed Joab Powell had once more the vaguely discomforting
sense of being left behind, of missing passage to the unknown place
which was his rightful destination.</p>

<p>It was not a new feeling, but it made him impatient to be
troubled so late in life by the urges which belonged to a young
man. He turned the ferry across a river so low and quiet upon its
bed that the old gray horse, plodding the treadmill, made no work
of it. The mountains bordering the valley sank away in first
twilight, the surface of the river began to exhale a thin crystal
fog, and the smell of the earth was sharp and heavy with the year's
decay. One day a hard rain would slant out of the southwest,
announcing winter.</p>

<p>He tied the ferry and let the horse into its pasture, moving
along a path bordered by wild rose brambles whose seed pods hung
fat and red. He studied the framework of the new gristmill as he
passed toward the house, calculating the work done upon it this
day; and he observed that young John Sharpp, employed as carpenter,
now stood on the porch of the house talking to Elizabeth. Elizabeth
laughed in her bright, half mocking manner and her hand touched
John Sharpp and for a moment the man caught her arm and the two
were playfully struggling. Then John Sharpp heard his step on the
path and stepped away from Elizabeth with an embarrassed smile.</p>

<p>"She'll tease the wits out of you, John," said Joab Powell and
passed into the house. But he was thinking to himself: "It is past
time for her to be married."</p>

<p>He walked through the house to the kitchen, past his other
daughter Anna who worked quiet and swift with the supper; he washed
himself at the back porch well, put on his slippers, and moved back
to the big room's table, upon which the oil lamps now were
pleasantly shining. He sat down and waited for his daughters and
for John Sharpp; when they were seated he bowed his face with its
rusty-iron beard, said grace, and began his meal. Far away he
thought he heard travelers on the road.</p>

<p>Sharpp said: "I have got the big timbers all hewed for the
raceway."</p>

<p>"I'll help you set them in Monday," said Powell. The young man
had a good, square face which looked honestly upon the world; he
was steady, he was made for the long slow pull, he would season
with the years as a good hardwood stick seasons, and he would never
lie awake in bed asking questions which had no answers.</p>

<p>What did Elizabeth want with him&mdash;this daughter whose
discontent came out of her like a heat to disturb everything about
her? She was too pretty, she hated too quickly, she wanted things
not to be had in this out-of-way spot whose high point was the
daily passing of a stage. She was, Powell thought with a father's
moment of stark realism, ripe and over-ready. He looked down the
table and saw Anna looking on at Elizabeth and John Sharpp with her
deep gravity.</p>

<p>A wagon came along with its racket and someone said, "This is
Powell's," and voices began to rise in the yard. Anna left the
table at once, moving toward the kitchen. Rising to meet his
guests, Joab Powell noticed sudden interest brighten Elizabeth's
face as she touched her hair and ran a finger along her eyebrows in
expectation of new eyes to look upon her.</p>

<p>The travelers entered with the subdued bustle of weary people, a
man and woman past middle age, a boy and girl in brash adolescence,
a young woman with an attractive, pouting face, and a pair of men.
One was thin and very darkly colored and possessing a pair of brows
black as ink; the other, a blond gentleman with an extraordinarily
regular profile, had a face which, seen face-on, showed some
evidence of dissipation.</p>

<p>The elderly man said: "Thank God tomorrow is a day of rest.
These Oregon roads are without question some kind of an approach to
Inferno. We require accommodations until Monday morning. Can you
put us up and, as a practical matter, what are your rates?"</p>

<p>Joab Powell said: "Two dollars the night and fifty cents the
meal."</p>

<p>"Acceptable," said the older one. "You are looking upon Edward
Ord Mainring's Theatrical Troupe, now on tour, presently bound to
play the Jacksonville mines. Mrs. Mainring, if you please. Our
young star, Miss Strange. My daughter Jo and my son Tarleton. My
leading man, James Hawtree"&mdash;this was the one with the
striking profile&mdash;"and Mr. Victor Porrocks, whose darker cast
lends flavor to our villains."</p>

<p>The young man thus identified displayed a gentle smile while Mr.
Hawtree cast a frankly speculative glance upon Elizabeth, who
returned the glance with equal speculation, Miss Strange observed
this exchange of interest and paid Elizabeth the courtesy of a
moment's cold interest. Young Tarleton Mainring peevishly said,
"I'm awful hungry."</p>

<p>"Elizabeth," said Joab Powell, "show these people their
rooms."</p>

<p>Elizabeth moved to the stairs and ascended with a composed and
excellent carriage; the members of the troupe, each with luggage,
trudged after her and made some racket in the upper hall as they
found their quarters. Joab Powell stepped from the house to direct
the party's wagoner to the barn, and Anna quietly returned from the
kitchen to set new places at the table. She looked at John Sharpp
who sat alone before his unfinished meal; she caught his glance and
smiled at him.</p>

<p>"Acting people?" he said. "Here?"</p>

<p>"This is a tavern, John." She circled the table, and when she
got behind him she paused a moment, looking down on his head with a
grave stillness on her face; then she moved back to the
kitchen.</p>

<p>The party came down the stairs to their supper, cheerfully and
with considerable noise. Joab Powell returned from the night; he
took his place again at the head of the table and sat over his
coffee. They were a hungry lot, he observed; they were an odd
assortment out of the kind of world he had almost forgotten.
Mainring and Mainring's wife were pleasantly comfortable people;
their children were brash, as their life had no doubt taught them
to be. The fellow who was the villain seemed, in these
surroundings, to be a mild and inconspicuous fellow; but Mr.
Hawtree was of another breed. He saw Hawtree's eyes now and then
lift and strike Elizabeth who, returned from upstairs, now stood in
the background of the room with that quietness upon her which Joab
Powell knew so well; there would be excitement playing beneath it
and her discontent would be driving her toward a greater fury at
her life. She stared at Hawtree steadily and Hawtree's expression
revealed his rising instincts. John Sharpp saw none of this; he
finished his meal in silence and rose and left the room. But Miss
Strange&mdash;there was a girl with her own kind of knowledge, Joab
Powell thought&mdash;saw it all and gave Hawtree her cutting
glance.</p>

<p>Powell said: "If you're going to the mines, you'll only get that
wagon as far as Canyonville. The road's nothing but a trail beyond.
You'll need horses there."</p>

<p>Mainring leaned back from his plate, flushed and comforted; he
was expansive, he was philosophical. "We shall not think of that
until we reach Canyonville. In this profession, Mr. Powell, you do
not worry about tomorrow too much. There are always contingencies,
disasters and emergencies to be surmounted. Fire, flood, famine and
mob. In forty years of trouping Mrs. Mainring and I have seen the
ugly faces of them all. Here we are, lacking a player for the part
of the plantation belle. Where shall we get her? I do not know. But
it is three days to Jacksonville. We shall have her when we get
there."</p>

<p>"Uncertainty would not please me," said Joab Powell.</p>

<p>"Uncertainty," said Mainring, "is youth. Have you forgotten how,
as a boy, you counted on tomorrow's excitement and venture?"</p>

<p>Well, thought Joab Powell, the man did for a fact appear young.
He had no particular lines on his face, his eyes were bright and he
was at the present moment wholly happy, or seemed so. Elizabeth, he
noticed, now moved slowly across the floor and stepped from the
house. Suddenly Hawtree emptied his coffee cup and rose and walked
after her.</p>

<p>Mainring said: "Bed will be a comfort after these roads," and
left the table. One by one the party moved up the stairs while Joab
stood by the fireplace and watched Anna quietly come and go with
her chores. Outside he heard Elizabeth's voice, sometimes slow,
sometimes light, sometimes intemperately strong. Hawtree's tone was
a sympathetic murmur. Joab pried a better flame from the fireplace
logs, looked for his glasses and sat down in a rocking chair; he
took up his pipe, filled and lighted it, and reached for his paper,
which was from Portland. The crickets were full-voiced in the broad
night and the air coming through the front door had its chill. For
a moment his mind went idly around the circle of things to be done
before winter came.</p>

<p>Hawtree moved into the house with an aggressive stride, his face
square and flushed, and went stamping up the stairs. Hidden behind
his paper, Joab Powell heard Elizabeth later enter the room. He had
no wish to look at her at the moment. He said: "Help your sister,"
and listened to her steps go laggard toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>Half reading, he heard the house settle down. The murmuring
above stairs slowly died away, and bodies turned upon their beds,
and now and then a door closed. John Sharpp climbed the stairs, a
young man solemnly displeased with the sudden turn of affairs, and
Elizabeth came from the kitchen and for a moment paused. When Joab
Powell lowered his paper he saw the bright burning of her eyes, the
thoughts half-shaped upon her face. She was a stranger to him
tonight, as she had been on so many other occasions; she was his
flesh and his blood, but her spirit&mdash;whose was that? He wanted
to speak to her and he saw that she wanted to speak to him, yet
neither of them had a way of bridging the difference between.</p>

<p>He said: "Sharpp's a good young man. Don't use him hard, unless
you mean to have him."</p>

<p>She laughed at him with her eyes, a hot, sharp and unamused
laugh; then she climbed the stairs. In a little while Anna, having
done the last of her chores, quietly followed. Joab said: "Good
night, Anna." Her voice came back in its neverchanging way; it
carried the melody that was in her and never left her.</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p>He let the paper lie and be refilled his pipe, deeply breathing
the smoke and finding relish in it. He was a stout, aging man, made
benevolent in appearance by his beard and the tall dome of his
forehead; it was a benevolence sharpened by a realism which forever
colored his judgments. He thought: "John should be Anna's man. It
would work better that way." He thought about Elizabeth and found
no answer for her. He thought of the show troupe which was so gay
and glamorous to Elizabeth's eyes but which was simply a group of
tired people forever on the move to earn a threadbare livelihood,
all their cheap trinkets contained in a few battered trunks. He
knocked out his pipe and went slowly to his room. There was still a
light in Elizabeth's room as he passed by.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
The fall fog lay silver-thick over the river by morning and dew
glistened on the earth until noon. Church was ten miles distant and
therefore not always to be attended, but Joab Powell made grace at
breakfast longer than usual, and had a special prayer at the midday
meal. Thereafter, in a warm, halfclouded afternoon he did his
chores and tended ferry. The north-bound stage crossed at two
o'clock; the south-bound at four. During the day he saw Hawtree and
Elizabeth walking together along the dusty road, and he saw John
Sharpp sulking alone in his good clothes by the river. Mainring's
youngsters, discovering the gristmill, climbed to the rafter peaks
until they were tired; and borrowed a skiff and vanished beyond the
willows. Near five o'clock Mainring walked to the ferry where Joab
Powell idly worked, and sat himself on the treadmill. He was,
Powell saw, not wholly at ease; and it occurred to Powell to wonder
if the man were about to suggest a compromise on the lodging
bill.</p>

<p>"I believe last night," said Mainring, "I mentioned we had lost
one of our cast. She was a refined young lady with some talent who
suddenly discovered domestic virtue in Portland and left us."</p>

<p>"Heard you mention it," said Powell.</p>

<p>"So did your daughter Elizabeth," said Mainring.</p>

<p>"My daughter Elizabeth," said Powell, "does considerable idle
dreaming."</p>

<p>"It is a habit," said Mainring, "we all have. It is the way we
all live. Make-believe."</p>

<p>"I don't," said Joab Powell.</p>

<p>"My friend," said Mainring, "have you never wished your ferry
would carry you farther than that other bank of the river?"</p>

<p>"I know what's beyond the other bank," said Powell.</p>

<p>"Your daughter, being young, does not."</p>

<p>Powell said: "She's been talking to you. Asked you if maybe she
had ability to act. She's been acting ever since you set foot in
the tavern."</p>

<p>"So she has," said Mainring. "Very indifferent acting, too."</p>

<p>Powell drove two nails deep with his hammer and straightened. He
watched Mainring's children drift down the river in the rowboat,
and he watched the afternoon's haze close upon the Cascades. He
turned to Mainring. "I suppose she wants to go with you."</p>

<p>"Your daughter," said Mainring, careful and quiet, "is not happy
here. I saw it at once."</p>

<p>"It is nothing a marriage won't cure."</p>

<p>Mainring said, "Have you got some tobacco?" He filled his pipe
from Powell's pouch. He lighted the pipe and set it to burning with
long, steady draws. "We put up for noon yesterday at a place. Man
and wife. The wife was odd."</p>

<p>"Purdy's wife," said Powell, "is crazy."</p>

<p>"Her face bothered me a great deal after we left," said
Mainring. "It was a haunted face. She watched us go. You could see
she wanted to be with us. She wanted to be with anybody who was
going away from that place. One day she'll sink an ax into Purdy's
head when he isn't looking and she'll start walking. Where to? Any
place away from where she is. Marriage didn't cure what was in her
mind. Some people have to run. Nothing else will do."</p>

<p>Powell said: "Cheap and shoddy."</p>

<p>"You're no doubt thinking of Hawtree," said Mainring. "Have you
got no Hawtrees in your neighborhood? Your daughter is in her own
hands. Here or elsewhere she will make her own lot. But if you do
not permit her to follow her desires, she will make a bad job of
it. You will have another Purdy's wife. I have seen a great deal of
this world. I have seen a lot of Purdy's wives."</p>

<p>"I have seen women who started out on a wild goose chase and
ended common," said Powell. "There's more of them than Purdy's
wives."</p>

<p>"Your daughter," said Mainring quite frankly, "could fill a
place in my company. Nothing more. It will take me a great deal of
time to teach her to open and shut a door on the stage. I can do
that for her. If she has no ability, she will fail and she will
come back. If she has ability she will go on and up. Either way,
she will have had her run."</p>

<p>"No," said Powell, "she won't come back."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mainring, "she is the kind you could never hold in
any event. If you try to hold her you will regret it and she will
see to it that you regret it."</p>

<p>"Not to be thought of," said Powell.</p>

<p>Mainring rose and tapped out his pipe. "A man," he said
thoughtfully, "has a duty to his children. Sometimes the duty is to
let go, not to hold. The world is vile and she will be exposed to
it. The world is great, and she is looking for greatness. How are
you to know what will become of her? You will not know. But when
any human soul cries out for release, vile or great, you cannot
stop that soul from venturing. To your daughter, desperate for
something she cannot find here, even the vile is better than
nothing at all."</p>

<p>He moved up the trail to the house; and suddenly he turned about
and said a last thing with some sharpness. "Look into your own
heart, my friend," and went on.</p>

<p>The sun was somewhere low behind September's haze. There was a
wind, slight and cool, out of the southeast; in another day or so,
Joab Powell thought, the wind would swing and the hard, intemperate
rain would come to freshen the earth. A wagon moved out of the
north and onto the ferry and as he was about to cast off he saw
Elizabeth move swiftly down from the house. She came aboard and
rode in silence across the water; and she waited afterward until
the wagon had gone on. Then she faced her father and he saw the
gathering storm on her face, the intensity almost like pain, the
wanting so crowded within her that it made shadows in her eyes. It
came out of her&mdash;all this&mdash;in one awkward, swift phrase:
"I've got to go with them."</p>

<p>The old gray horse plodded the treadmill and the ferry made its
semicircular path on the water. Joab stood grave at the bow,
meeting her eyes.</p>

<p>"Daughter," he said, "you have made a picture for yourself.
You're seeing yourself as a great actress, people throwing flowers
up to the stage, people pointing you out in restaurants where you
eat. You're seeing strange towns through the world, and kings and
queens sitting in opera boxes while you play. That's what you're
seeing. When you were ten you saw the same things, standing in the
hay loft, swinging your arms and talking to yourself."</p>

<p>"Why not?" she said. "Why not?"</p>

<p>"You think this shabby little troupe will do it for you? Playing
in cheap mining camps, riding wet through the rain, living in
rooming houses? Wearing your clothes after they've turned color,
being with men like Hawtree?"</p>

<p>She said in the most calculating of ways: "I know about Hawtree.
I can take care of myself. I am harder than he is. How do you
suppose people start? They've got to start small. I don't mind. But
I've got to go with them. I can't stay here any more. You're old.
You're happy. You don't see what I see. Why don't you let me go? Do
you know what I'll do if you keep me here? I'll marry Sharpp. I'll
make him miserable&mdash;I'll make Anna miserable because she wants
him. Then I'll run away. Or I'll take the first well-dressed man
who comes through here and I'll go with him. I have got to go!"</p>

<p>He had no answer for her; he was ashamed of what she had said
and did not meet her eyes. He stooped, a little awkwardly, and tied
the ferry to the shore; he let the gray horse into its pasture,
watching Elizabeth go up the pathway, half running. He reached for
his pipe and he filled it, and held it unlighted in his mouth.
Darkness had begun to sweep down, drowning the hills and covering
the valley's far run, swinging on forward with its shadows until
the world was reduced to this small settlement beside the river.
"Why," he thought, "it's late." Then he realized the darkness was
the darkness of rain clouds moving slowly up. He walked toward the
house and as he walked he began to think of his wife, long dead. He
said to himself: "Annie, what's in that girl? What am I to do?"</p>

<p>He said grace over a full supper table and he ate in mild,
steady detachment while talk boiled and bubbled around him.
Elizabeth moved like an alien shadow about the room, darkly
withdrawn from him; somehow in the space of an hour or so she had
cut herself from this family and was no longer a part of it. He
felt the hatred in her&mdash;the wild and passionate despair. It
touched him like a disturbed air. John Sharpp, unfavorably silent,
sat through the meal as a man perplexed by things he felt but could
not understand, and soon withdrew from the house; and presently one
by one the troupe climbed the stairs to bed. Joab Powell went out
to do the night's chores and came back later through the kitchen to
find John Sharpp in the kitchen with Anna, drying dishes. Elizabeth
had gone up to her room. Her cruel mood had reached out to Sharpp,
simple a man as he was, and had made him feel no longer near her;
and now Sharpp returned to someone he could understand.</p>

<p>Joab Powell freshened the fire on the hearth and removed his
shoes and sat once more in the rocker, comforted by all the sounds
of this house. He lay back, feeling oldness come to him and the
loneliness that always arrived with it. Elizabeth was on his mind
and the puzzle of her temper grew greater to him. Where had she
gotten that rebellion, that wild will, that hatred of old and
familiar things?</p>

<p>John Sharpp presently trod upstairs in silence and later, with
night's work done, Anna came into the room. She paused before Joab
Powell, smiling down at him, and he saw a momentary happiness on
her face. It was the little things she loved, the old ways, the
comfortable and familiar habits of life. Yet, watching her, he saw
the smile fade and her inner contentment go away. Her face mirrored
the nearest expression of anger he had ever noticed there.</p>

<p>"Let her go, father. Let her leave!"</p>

<p>"Why daughter," he said, and was truly shocked. "Do you
understand what might happen to her?"</p>

<p>"Do you know," she answered, as harsh and as sure as Elizabeth
could be, "what is happening now while she stays? Don't hold her.
She's entitled to be happy if she can. I'm entitled to be happy as
well, am I not?"</p>

<p>She said no more. She bent forward and quietly kissed him and
took the stairs; but Joab Powell thought with astonishment: "They
are strangers side by side. They are not sisters."</p>

<p>The question came again to him, insistently demanding answer;
from what source had come Elizabeth's discontent with the world as
it was? He sat quite still in the room's silence, turning his
thoughts upon himself. He was a solid man, wasn't he? He had found
this place upon the earth, he had built his house and accumulated
his goods and he was satisfied. Long ago as a boy he had possessed
a boy's longings and a boy's impatience but never had he eaten out
his heart over things that couldn't be. Yet now he remembered how
he watched the stage each day disappear to the southward, and he
recalled the strange and unknown currents which stirred in him as
he saw it go.</p>

<p>The thought made him move slightly on the rocker; and then he
got to thinking of his wife and he saw so clearly the outline of
her placid face before him. She had been a fine woman, she had been
beside him, without complaint, all the way along the years.
Suddenly he sat forward in his chair, bringing to his mind
something he had never cared to think much about. There had been a
young man, long ago, in the Illinois town from which he and his
wife had both come. Annie had liked that careless, devil-taken
scoundrel whose name was Burge Simms&mdash;and Burge Simms had gone
away to be a river pilot on the Mississippi. Maybe Burge had been
the man Annie had wanted. He never had known about that, but often
he had wondered about her thoughts when she sat so still by the
evening fire, when she stood at the doorway and looked out upon the
land. She had died smiling at him but, and he sat forward again
with a stinging feeling on his face, she had also died with her
innermost feelings still a mystery to him. He had wanted a quiet
and solid woman; she had given him that, keeping the rest to
herself.</p>

<p>Now a feeling came hard upon him, new to his practical mind,
unsettling to his need of steadiness. Here his daughter Anna had
stood a moment ago, revealing a passionate feeling he had not known
she possessed; and upstairs all these various people slept, the
saturnine Porrocks who played the part of a villain and yet was a
gentleman, and Hawtree who was a hero on the stage and a shoddy
character otherwise, and John Sharpp, so plain and steady a man.
All these people lay on their beds now, all known to him in a way
by their speech and the things which were upon their faces; but
carrying dreams he couldn't know.</p>

<p>He laid a hand heavy upon the arm of the rocking chair and he
said, aloud, but quiet:</p>

<p>"Why, nobody actually knows anybody else."</p>

<p>Rising, he followed the ritual of his life. He tested the door
lock and screened the fire; he laid his pipe in its bowl and took
up the lamp and slowly ascended the stairs. When he came to the
door of Elizabeth's room he knocked, and heard her slow, sullen
voice bid him in. She stood dressed in the middle of the room, and
he saw that she had been walking restlessly around with her
thoughts. Her eyes, turned to him, were alien.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth," he said, "you have got your own life to live. Go
ahead and live it as you please." He drew back and quickly closed
the door; but even so, he saw the light break across her face. She
was like a prisoner getting news of release, he thought sadly.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
It had rained during the night and had ceased. Now the quenched
earth sent its raw fine smell into the morning, and a thick mist
silvered the air so thickly that the cottonwoods of the far shore
were vaguest shadows. The troupe's wagon stood by with the baggage
loaded and the driver in his seat; the troupe came out, freshly
rested, and eager to be going. Mainring paid his cheerful
compliments to Joab Powell and the gentle villain shook Powell's
hand. "I would not mind," he said, "trading places with you. It is
a pleasant piece of earth here."</p>

<p>The wagon rolled aboard the ferry, the members of the troupe
walking casually after. Joab Powell brought the old gray
horse&mdash;its ancient muzzle a-sparkle with night's dew&mdash;out
of the pasture to the treadmill and waited for the last passenger,
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>She was at the house doorway, facing Anna; and he stood still,
watching those two say their farewells, realizing that both girls
were glad to have it this way. They kissed briefly and Elizabeth
said one gay word in response to Anna's grave nod; then Elizabeth
came down the pathway to where John Sharpp waited and she paused to
look up at his grieving face. She laughed at him and said some soft
thing, and kissed him lightly on the cheek and thereafter, like a
delighted child, she ran down the path to the ferry. Joab cast off
the line; the old horse, patiently plodding, started the ferry over
the river.</p>

<p>The troupe was forward, near the team, deliberately giving Joab
his privacy as Elizabeth stood by him. A fish jumped and made a
widening circle on the water and the river made its washing sound
on the mild rapids lower down. Joab stared away from his
daughter.</p>

<p>"When I was young I wanted many things. I found out I couldn't
have a lot of those things. It wasn't in me to have them. It may
not be in you to have all that you want."</p>

<p>"Why," said Elizabeth, "I shall get what I want."</p>

<p>"You will try," said Joab Powell soberly, "and maybe that's the
fun of it. But if you do not find what you want, come back. I'll be
here." Then he added a grave afterthought. "Don't stay away too
long. I'm not young."</p>

<p>"I'll come back to see you, of course," said Elizabeth in her
light voice.</p>

<p>The ferry touched the south shore's mud bank and the team moved
the wagon to land. Now the troupe members climbed aboard and the
voices of all of them were gay with morning and with the excitement
of being in motion. Joab turned to Elizabeth and saw the same
excitement on her face, the fine flame in her eyes. She was trying
to remember, he saw, that he was her father and that she was going
away from him and should be sad. But even as she tried to remember
that, she was still happy and could not show sorrow. She put her
arms around him and kissed him fully, the first such kiss he could
remember from her since she had been a child; and she stepped back,
laughing, with her eyes moist. She turned and walked to the wagon
and took her place on one of the seats. Mainring cried heartily
out, "Tallyho," and the teamster's sharp shout put the horses
forward.</p>

<p>Joab Powell watched wagon and people slowly grow obscure in the
close-hanging mists. He saw them wave at him, he heard them
pleasantly calling; they were like children off to a party,
straining for new things and greater surprises beyond. Elizabeth
raised her hand to blow him a kiss and Joab, memorizing her face
with greatest care, lifted his own hand in return salute. Then the
mists covered them and for a little while he heard their voices
come back through the mists. Afterwards they were lost to him,
sight and sound of them alike dying. He thought to himself: "I have
got to remember what she looked like," and started the ferry
away.</p>

<p>Half over the river he was alone in the mist, both shores dim.
He loaded his pipe with a mechanical interest as he thought of her.
He had asked her to come back and she had promised she would; but
even then he knew she never would return. He had made the same
promise to his own parents when he as a young man had left the
Vermont farm, bound west to Illinois. Many times during the later
years he had thought of his people, resolving to return to them for
a visit; but he never had. Life was pretty much a parting of the
young from the old; the young venturing away with their ambitions
and the old settled fast to their comforts.</p>

<p>He tied the ferry and put the horse into its meadow and he stood
facing the south shore, listening with the hope that he might hear
one last sound return from the wagon. Anna and John came down the
pathway; they stopped before him and he observed that they were
sorry for him. They were good and simple people and they would do
well together; they would fill this tavern with children and they
would be content. It gave him comfort to think of it.</p>

<p>Anna said: "Don't worry, father. It is the first time she has
really been happy."</p>

<p>Still thinking of Elizabeth, he was suddenly proud of her. She
was breaking away to follow her wants, just as he had done. She was
a piece of him venturing afar, doing those things he had wished to
do and had never succeeded in doing. Each day now, as he watched
the southbound stage roll away, he would scarcely need to feel that
somehow he had missed his destination. Elizabeth took his place,
and sought the destination.</p>

<p>Joab said: "We'll' lay the timbers today, John," and started up
the pathway toward the gristmill. He thought to himself: <i>I shall
have to remember how she looked, for I shall never see her
again.</i></p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. Smoky in the West</h2>

<p>He came up to the Reynolds ranch early that morning in a buggy
drawn by two matched duns&mdash;not a big man but stocky and brisk,
with bright hazel eyes set into a high-colored face. When Madge
came out to the porch she saw the confident quality of his smile,
as though even then he realized his power over people and
circumstances, as though he had some clear intimation of his life
to come. He said, in a voice that poorly controlled his
impatience:</p>

<p>"If you choose, we can make it to my ranch by dark. I think six
months is long enough. You can have George or you can have me and
God knows I'll give you everything a man can make out of this land.
There's something ahead for us. I want you. I can't talk it, but
you ought to see it. That's why I'm here. It's how I feel. Only,
six months is time enough to wait and I won't come again."</p>

<p>She said in a soft voice: "Now, Jim? Right now?"</p>

<p>He said, "Now," and long years afterwards she remembered the
ring of that answer, its brusque force. For a little while she
stood before him, feeling the violent compulsions of his restless
will and the burning heat of his ambition. She knew she would go;
yet even as she made her decision she had a voiceless regret for
the things she was giving up and never would get from Jim Carran.
Afterwards she turned into the house. Within a quarter hour, all
her possessions in the rig, she was on the way to Fossil with
him.</p>

<p>Fossil was five houses rising freshly from a virgin prairie. All
the land swept away to the far blue of the Wildhorse Hills and the
wind at this hour was sweet with the warmth and growth of first
spring. They were married at Rice Stewart's little land office and
then returned to the street and found George Berryman paused by the
rig, his easy-going face showing a shock that for one moment was
actually wild. This was the time when Jim Carran, having won, could
be a little tolerant and a little contemptuous. He said, "You lose,
George," and left the two of them there, going into the adjacent
store. Coming out later, he saw that his wife had taken her seat in
the buggy and had turned so that she might not face George
Berryman; for he, gripping the buggy's side panel with both his
great fists, was watching her in a manner Jim Carran never forgot.
Jim Carran was a sharp man with his eyes and he saw something in
the tightness of his new wife's lips that ran a prowling doubt
through him and set up his instant temper. He got up in the buggy's
seat and called: "You're a slow man, George&mdash;and that's no way
to get things in this world," and ran the buggy out of town.</p>

<p>It was thirty-five miles to the Forks, a lovely haze spreading
over the land and softening its shallow sweeping folds. Jim Carran,
absorbing it all with his bright hazel glance, laughed silently as
he drove, stirred by things he could not express. There was almost
nothing said between them though once when he saw her look back to
the dimming shape of Fossil he asked in his half-impatient way:
"Forget something?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Nothing."</p>

<p>At dusk they came upon the hills and the house and sheds and
corrals of his ranch, with his three hands waiting there for him.
He said in his abrupt manner, "This is Mrs. Carran, boys." When
they entered that long low house on the Forks Jim Carran was
twenty-one and his wife nineteen; but in 1870 there was no twilight
age between youth and maturity. Both of them had reached maturity
five years before.</p>

<p>The Wildhorse Hills rose directly behind the yard of his ranch,
thick with pine, and now and then in the depths of the night it was
the call of the coyotes that woke him and made him remember he had
a wife beside him. She lay wholly still, but from the strong and
even run of her breathing he knew that she was not asleep. He could
touch her and feel the passiveness of her body, he could sense its
lack of resistance, its lack of answer for him. In the morning,
sitting across the table from her, he understood that somewhere
during the dark hours a part of her had slipped away from him. He
had this acuteness, he had this power of knowing people; it was his
strength always, it explained his whole life. Looking at her, so
composed and so patient, with a pride that opened her prettiness,
he saw the wall between them clearly and his passion for
completeness of possession made him say:</p>

<p>"Then why didn't you marry George?"</p>

<p>For a moment he thought she would lie or show fear&mdash;things
that he forever hated. This was his mistake, for she looked at him
with a directness he could not misunderstand. "I didn't love
him."</p>

<p>"Nor me."</p>

<p>"There are things in you I like. And I could not stay single. I
am nineteen, which is time to be married. What you want done, I
will do."</p>

<p>This was his wife, governed by a realism he had to admire even
while his impatient will struck against the reserve she showed him.
In a way Jim Carran's mind had always been old, furnished in the
beginning with a wisdom that controlled the restless energies
boiling through his compact body. People could be persuaded, or
bought, or broken. Most people. But he saw something in his wife
that held him quiet in his chair and, during those few quiet
moments, laid the whole pattern of his relations with her. She
would bend but never break; soft as she was, she had her own
will&mdash;and there was something in her mind or in her heart he
could not own or share. This he knew to be so, though he didn't
know why, and never knew.</p>

<p>She said: "You want me to go back?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, and his laugh was quick and full. In a way it was
touched by the irony of this situation. "I wanted a wife. I wanted
you. You will never be sorry."</p>

<p>Two mornings later he rode out of the Forks, bound for Texas
with his foreman, Bill Gilbert, and three others, leaving one man
behind to keep the place. Fifteen hundred miles down the trail lay
Texas and cheap beef.</p>

<p>This was the central fact of Jim Carran's life, this sense of
time cheating a man out of his good years. It made him hate delay
and uncertainty, it made him drive others as he drove himself, with
an inward fury. All this land was fresh and free and full of
fortune to the proper man. There were times on that wild southward
ride when Bill Gilbert, waking fitfully from a dog-tired sleep, saw
Jim Carran crouched over the dying fire, stone-still and brooding
out his thoughts; there were times on that hard trip when he saw
Jim Carran's impatience spill over in great sudden swings of his
hands against the saddle, as though he tried to use his physical
strength to push the horse faster. Deep in Texas they bought up a
thousand head of gaunt, southern beef and turned it north for the
fattening grasses of the Forks. At the Cimarron crossing they were
jumped by a party of four trail cutters. Jim Carran said:
"Gentlemen, what do you wish?" He knew what they wanted, but he
waited to be sure and when they told him he only added, "All
right," which was a signal. After they crossed the Cimarron, Bill
Gilbert looked behind him and saw the buzzards wheeling over the
trail cutters now dead on the sandy earth.</p>

<p>In '75 the land was like that and men were like that. Bill
Gilbert knew something about Jim Carran then that made his voice
softer; and later, near a little town up on the Niobrara, he
learned more. Jim Carran had gone in to have a drink. Three hours
later, Bill Gilbert went in to see what delayed his return and
found Jim Carran sitting at a saloon table with his back to a rear
wall, laughing at the marshal who stood in the door and was afraid
to fire. The saloon was broken up and there were two women sitting
with Jim Carran, both laughing and Jim Carran's hazel eyes were
pale and bright with drink and with the little devils of a starved
temper furiously alive.</p>

<p>So Jim Carran came back to the Forks with his thousand cattle
and four cowhands ridden gaunt, though he himself remained
untouched by the journey. The ruddy blood showed on his cheeks when
he came before his wife, and his laughter was full and frank,
rolling out the great vigor in him; and when he kissed her it was
in his mind that the hardness of his feeling would reach through
her gravity and melt the barrier between. But the passiveness held,
and then they were two people face to face, with everything as it
had been before. He had brought back a silver-mounted saddle, and a
package.</p>

<p>"The saddle," he said, "is for the boy, when he comes. The
package is for you."</p>

<p>It was the costume of a Mexican dancer, even to the castanets
and high bone comb. He saw the oddness in her cheeks, almost like
pleasure, and said: "I met her somewhere in Texas. She was a dark
woman&mdash;and very pretty. But not like you, Madge."</p>

<p>Her expression changed and she said, "Thank you," and he never
saw the costume again. The saddle he hung in the front room as a
reminder of the son he expected; and at those rare times when he
remained home Madge Carran used to see him come before it, his eyes
held by the flash and glow of the silver trimmings. His compact
shoulders had a way of lifting and his words had a swing to them,
thrown outward by the gustiness of his will. "I intend to leave the
boy something when I die."</p>

<p>But it was a girl and he was not there at the time. Talk of a
railroad was in the wind and he had gone off to Omaha to use his
influence. Threshing back to the Forks in the dead of winter, he
found his wife in the care of a woman from Sixty-Mile ranch. There
had been no doctor. He stood awhile in the bedroom, showing very
little of his feelings. Madge said: "I'm sorry you are
disappointed."</p>

<p>"Her name," he said, "will be Caroline, which was my mother's
name," and left the bedroom. He paused in front of the silver
saddle a considerable interval, rocking on his heels; and
afterwards went outside.</p>

<p>The second girl, Louisa, was born one year later; the following
year the boy came. It was the last of their children, and, as with
the others, he was away from the ranch. He stood again in his
wife's room, the ruddiness of his cheeks showing clearly the pride
he felt, as though he had seen the long battle through, as though
he had put his will to this and won again. He said: "I am pleased,
as any man should be. You will never regret it. His name, of
course, will be Jim."</p>

<p>She looked up at him with that old expression which, acute of
mind as he was, he could never fathom. And said: "Jim George
Carran. You won't mind that?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "No."</p>

<p>But when he next drove into town he went straight to George
Berryman's store. "George," he said in a way wickedly civil, "my
son has your name for a middle handle. It may be I was mistaken
about you in the beginning."</p>

<p>Berryman's big hands roved the counter top, and stopped. He was
a quiet man, an easy-going man. But he came out from behind the
counter and his voice was new to Jim Carran then. "I do not like
the way you treat her and I do not like your talk. You want any
more?"</p>

<p>Jim Carran's hazel eyes brightened; they grew round and almost
pleased. "No," he murmured, "no more talk," and sprang at George
Berryman. The big man moved back, taking Carran's fists on his
chest; and reached out and struck Carran down at a single blow. He
stood there, his breathing a little deeper, watching Carran come up
and come on again. The scuffle of their boots made low sounds in
the store and the beat of Carran's fists laid flat echoes across
the heat. George Berryman knocked him down again&mdash;and saw the
little man come up, the expression of his face bad to see, and
Berryman knew Jim Carran would kill him or be killed; and
afterwards Berryman slugged all consciousness out of Jim Carran in
a sudden cold hatred and stood back a long while waiting for Carran
to come to life. He had broken Carran's nose and beaten his lips to
soft crimson. But Carran said: "All right, George. All
right"&mdash;and went out of the store.</p>

<p>These were the growing years. The railroad came through and
Fossil's street crawled along the tracks, and loading pens
appeared, and a man came in and set up a bank with Jim Carran's
support. Settlers began to break the uniform sweep of the land with
their windmills on Dutch Flats. Once a nester came into the Forks
country and put up his shanty, which pleased Madge.</p>

<p>She said: "I'll be glad to have them as neighbors."</p>

<p>That night Jim Carran took Bill Gilbert and rode the five miles
across country to the nester's shack. There was a moment when it
might have been bad, for the nester stood up against his house with
a lifted rifle&mdash;a slim Missourian with a wife and half a dozen
kids. "The land," he said, "is plumb free."</p>

<p>There was that moment when it might have been bad. But Jim
Carran kept hold of the man's eyes and finally he laughed and got
out of his saddle, and went forward and knocked down the rifle. He
said, "Pack up and move. This is cow country." Half an hour later
he threw five twenty-dollar gold pieces into the nester's departing
wagon&mdash;and touched a match to the shanty. It made a great
orange bomb in the sky as he rode home with Bill Gilbert and was
even visible from the Forks ranch. Madge Carran saw it and turned
slowly away, not speaking. But two years later she made her answer.
"Caroline will be ready for school next year and there are no
neighbors here to make a school. We'll have to move to Fossil."</p>

<p>It was the day of the great, square stone town house for
cattlemen and Jim Carran, riding up to wealth on his blocky beeves,
built such a house on the outskirts of Fossil and planted a double
row of poplars entirely around it. He bought a great iron stag in
Omaha and set it in the front yard; and high on the windmill tower
he had the brand of his outfit painted in white letters: Lazy JC.
So, seven years from the day Madge Carran stepped into the house on
the Forks, she stepped out of it&mdash;and never lived there again.
Riding into Fossil that day, she looked back once at the outline of
the ranch quarters at the base of the Wildhorse Hills, and
remembered the calling of the coyotes on the black night of her
arrival; and turned about, her shoulders held rigid.</p>

<p>He saw little of her, and little of his growing children; for
these were his great years. The days of the saddle trip into Texas
went away with the coming of steel, but each spring found him on
the roundabout train journey, to Abilene or the deep Gulf country.
Fall saw him riding the growing reaches of his own range; and
winter was the time he built his political influence, in
Washington, in the state capitol. For he was Jim Carran of the
Forks now, a cattleman of the straight breed, and power fed on
power and men could be bought or whipped or persuaded. Most
men.</p>

<p>Yet there never was a time when the shape and quality of his
wife didn't color his thoughts and lay against him a faint,
insistent pressure. Of wonder. Of regret. Once, riding into Omaha,
he casually met a woman, attracting her by that vitality and that
willful personality which so inevitably compelled all people. At
the station he said: "Perhaps I can be of some help to you, to your
hotel," and watched the forming smile on her lips when she said,
"Perhaps you can." And at times like those he judged women by the
dignity of his wife's eyes&mdash;and found them all wanting.</p>

<p>Victory was an easy thing to him and his restlessness rose
greater. Yet now and then the fire intermittently flickered out and
left him gray-minded and oppressed by some vague shadows whose
substance he could never touch and never define; and these were the
times when Jim Carran broke away from wherever he was and ended up
in some smoky, wicked trail dance hall along the cattle trail, his
compact shoulders bunched over a table, his stubby hands gripping
bottle and glass while mystery closed down and had its terrible way
with him.</p>

<p>It was in '79 that the bank he had so carefully nourished shut
its doors, the cashier missing; and somewhere during the day a
homesteader, bearing a redoubled hatred of Jim Carran faced him on
Fossil's street and put a bullet through his arm. Carran's replying
shot killed the homesteader, but when George Berryman came running
up, Jim Carran hadn't moved from his tracks. He said then, the
blood dripping freely into the dust, "You're going to run that
bank, George. You're the only man I have ever trusted. I'm
personally responsible for every dime&mdash;and I will pay it."</p>

<p>These were the times that the sources of his power showed
through. Afterwards, in the big stone town house he watched the
alternate darkness and light give expression to his wife's eyes
while the doctor worked on the torn arm. His son Jim-George stood
beside his mother, eight years old and turned pale by what he
saw.</p>

<p>It was that pallor which brought up something long dormant in
Jim Carran, a resolution so far unkept. That summer he took
Jim-George down to the Forks ranch, and rode through the Wildhorse
Hills with him. It was Jim-George's riding he kept watching, and
Jim-George's character; for Jim Carran's sharp eyes had seen
something he didn't like. But he kept his own counsel for four
years, giving the boy credit he would never have given another man.
Until, one day from his seat on the top bar of a corral he watched
Jim-George leave a bucker in a long, low dive. Dust settled and
silence came on. Jim-George got up, one shoulder lower than the
other, his chalky cheeks tipped toward Jim Carran, and toward Bill
Gilbert also watching.</p>

<p>"Hurt?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jim-George, and went back to the horse. Bill Gilbert
helped him on; and the boy rode it through. But afterwards Jim
Carran said:</p>

<p>"You're afraid of horses, Jim-George," and left the corral. He
had no way of holding it back for he was a man who hated
uncertainty and fear and all the small evasions of life. He saw the
expression in his son's eyes as he turned from the corral, an
expression terribly proud and mortally wounded&mdash;like that
expression he had noticed so often in the eyes of his wife. He knew
then he had pushed his son definitely away from him.</p>

<p>It was part of the price he paid for the heat of a will which
wilted all that came before it; his victories came of that heat,
and his defeats came of it, too, for his wife lay somewhere behind
a reserve impenetrable to him, and now his son withdrew. The
youngest girl, Louisa, grew up in the image of her mother, the same
patience and the same far thoughts in her young eyes, and only in
the oldest child, Caroline, did he see the reflection of
himself&mdash;the mirrored laughter and impatience, the almost
greedy love of life. Between them, from beginning to end, was a
speechless closeness, an understanding he could never reach with
others. Yet, in the long soft evenings of fall when he sat on the
porch of the great stone house and heard her voice rise gaily among
the voices of the boys in the yard, he sometimes sat quite still,
held by a doubt and by a fear. He knew his own weaknesses: and saw
them in Caroline.</p>

<p>So these years went, the streets of Fossil growing a little
longer and the shade trees growing up to first maturity on soil
that had been virgin in '70. Around this town lay the close-fenced
homesteads of German settlers; and dusty roads began to lengthen
away to other little towns and only in the far country about the
Wildhorse Hills did cattlemen remain undisturbed. There was a time
when the rustler grew great and when Jim Carran collected his own
chosen men and scoured the Wildhorse pines and left those men
hanging dead from the cottonwood branches along the isolated creek
bottoms. There was a time when the sheepman moved his herds up from
the Colorado parks&mdash;and retired again with his sheep lying in
white, lifeless windrows at the base of the Porcupine cliffs. Jim
Carran was in that, too. These were the hard years, the great and
winey years when his life rolled up to its turbulent crest and when
his signature was good on a check all the way from Texas to
Wyoming. He was stockier than in the beginning and the ruddiness of
his face had permanently deepened, leaving faint blood veins
tracked against the skin.</p>

<p>Madge said: "Caroline is eighteen and a little wild. You should
talk to her. And I wish you'd not let Jim-George ride so many
horses. He has broken too many bones."</p>

<p>He had nothing he could say to his daughter when she came before
him. For she was a formed, red-lipped woman and her eyes, as light
as his own, knew all that he knew, leaving him helpless. It was in
the spring of the year. She did something then she had never done
before. She was laughing and she bent down and kissed him, but when
she straightened he saw tears in her eyes. The week following she
ran away from town with a transient man none of them knew. Once
there was a letter from her with a St. Louis postmark. After that
the long years closed down and they never heard of her again.</p>

<p>He knew as soon as she left that he had lost the only tie
binding him to his family. And so it was a fear that made him take
his son along on the next trip to Texas. Fear, and a desire to get
nearer this son who, like Madge, stood so distant from him. Riding
down the illimitable west, he kept remembering the look in
Jim-George's eyes that day he had spoken of horses. It kept coming
back to him, and impelled him to say: "Some men can ride,
Jim-George, and some can't. It is no reflection on a man if he
can't. But if he can't, all the trying in the world won't help.
You're old enough now to know that. Better quit trying to ride the
buckers." But from his son's deep silence he knew he had made no
amends. The boy had a pride like his mother's pride&mdash;hidden
far away in him, metal-hard.</p>

<p>There was that unease between them Jim Carran made his honest
attempt to break. He knew of only one way, which was to show
Jim-George the sort of a man he, Jim Carran, actually was.
Truthfully and without those evasions which he so fundamentally
hated. He was conscientious about it, retravelling the trail for
his son's sake, introducing him to all the hale and earthy and
large-handed men who were his own friends. "This," he would say,
"is my son, Jim-George, who rides this way when I'm gone," and he
would stand back to see how Jim-George caught on. There was a
free-masonry on the trail. A man belonged or he didn't belong and
presently he knew Jim-George didn't belong. It was a way of looking
at life, a spirit that rode through trouble and misfortune, a
laughter that drew men together, an appetite that reached
vigorously and broadly and sometimes sinfully, into the depths of
living. In a way Jim Carran's generation was a generation of lusty
savages.</p>

<p>It was what Jim Carran felt, and wanted Jim-George to feel; and
it was that great desire that impelled him, in a moment of terrible
candor, to take Jim-George to one of those smoky and wicked road
houses that he knew so well, so that Jim-George would know
something of the secret turnings of a man's nature. Of women and
drink, and some groping for a meaning to things, and some search
for beauty, even within the four gray walls of a joint, with a pair
of girls sitting at the table and a bottle of whisky standing
half-empty there. But he saw Jim-George shrink and grow cold, and
at that moment he recognized Madge's eyes looking directly at
him.</p>

<p>The next day Jim-George started home with twenty car-loads of
beef and Jim Carran took the rest of his trip alone. He was
somewhere on the border a month later, when Madge's telegram caught
up with him. Jim-George had been killed on a bucking horse.</p>

<p>He had been a week late for this boy's birth; he was a week late
for his funeral. Standing alone&mdash;so thoroughly alone&mdash;in
the soft prairie twilight, beside the freshly mounded earth, Jim
Carran went down into the blackness that could come only to a
selfsufficient man at last realizing what self-sufficiency had done
to him. He remembered the way Jim-George had last looked at him
across that wide gulf neither of them had ever been able to bridge;
and he knew his few careless words, spoken so long ago, had killed
Jim-George. The kid had tried to overcome his fear with bad horses,
and in trying had died. It occurred to Jim Carran at this moment
that Jim-George had, somewhere in his heart, wanted to be like his
father.</p>

<p>There was a silence in the big stone house for Jim Carran, that
terrible silence following the sound of voices and laughter and
young people calling. Sitting in the living room with Madge and
Louisa, who was another Madge in every gesture, Jim Carran found
himself tight in his chair, waiting for Jim-George to speak,
waiting for Caroline to come gaily through the front door. And then
it was hard to let his muscles go slack and sit with the light
shining in his eyes and watch Madge's fingers work through her
knitting needles. Once he said:</p>

<p>"The blame is mine."</p>

<p>It was all he ever said, directly. Madge Carran's fingers came
to a complete stop. She looked at him and in the long interval he
saw, because his eyes had never lost their sharpness, that she was
trying to find words that would ease it for him. Trying and
failing. When she did speak it was to say something he never quite
understood, such being the strange distance of her thoughts. "There
are times, Jim, when I think I have misjudged you."</p>

<p>"Maybe we better go south for a trip this fall."</p>

<p>"Louisa is to be married then. Anyhow it is a little late for
that."</p>

<p>It was a little late for a good many things. Riding out the
summer along the old trails of the Wildhorse, he had certain spots
on the hill heights from which he could see his range strike away
in low undulations toward a misty horizon. All this belonged to
him, the fruits of his restless years and his hard years. Yet he
knew his time drew nearer its end, as with all the other great
cattlemen. He was an island against which the waters of homestead
settlement slowly rose and nothing held this range together but his
own will. After him came the breakup. In Fossil now were the
spindles of barb wire and the long piles of fence posts and the red
painted plows awaiting that breakup.</p>

<p>So, then, what was his life for? This was the question that lay
in Jim Carran's fertile mind as he rode his graze and saw his
whitefaced cows browsing, as he sat by night before the campfire of
his round-up crew and watched the flames with the same furious
energies having their way with him. This was as Bill Gilbert used
to see him in the old trail days, and this was as he still
remained, though times had changed and Bill Gilbert was gone. It
was the thing he thought of on the long trips to the south, and in
the murky confusion of the road houses on a trail almost vanished,
and in the rooms of many a western hotel where he stopped to cement
his business deals and brighten old time friendships.</p>

<p>There were, he saw, gray heads among those friends; and it
reminded him suddenly that his own head was likewise graying,
though this knowledge he kept pushing away. He was still an abrupt,
stocky figure with the extreme ruddiness of cheek and the same high
and explosive laugh; and in him still was the pent-up energy of a
man searching for something to win. But the time for that was at an
end. He had made his winnings.</p>

<p>For him there was no mellowness of age to absorb the shock of
growing old; no dying out of the full fire of his will. In the
beginning he had known his power, and knew it now in a way that
made him brace the high desert wind and stiffen his shoulders and
look into the distance with the desire to be again driving forward.
Only, there was a difference. Once the distance had been empty; now
there was no emptiness left for him to ride.</p>

<p>There was the time when he received notice of a pioneers'
convention to be held at Ogallala. He read it and tore it up
angrily, in front of George Berryman. "Pioneer, hell. I'm a young
man and I don't go around croaking of the old days." But later that
night he asked Madge in a slow, slow voice: "Has it been that long
ago? What's happened to all that time?"</p>

<p>Coming out of the Wildhorse Hills one fall day in 1905, he
stopped to open a gate of the Forks ranch and let his rifle slip
awkwardly from his hands; and took a bullet into that arm which,
years before, had been ripped by the crazed homesteader's shot.</p>

<p>The doctor in Fossil ordered him to bed, but he would not go
until, on the third day, he felt the hurt climb slowly out of his
arm into his shoulder. Then he knew the resistance of his youth was
gone. On the fourth morning he called in George Berryman. "I want
you to send two thousand dollars to Doria Anna Ramirez of
Phoenix."</p>

<p>"Paying your bills?" asked George.</p>

<p>"I never dodged one."</p>

<p>"No," said George Berryman, gravely, "you never did, Jim."</p>

<p>This was a thing his mind dwelled on as the fever went up and
his thoughts began to cross into that strange land of shadow. He
had paid his bills, every one and it was a source of satisfaction.
There were other people in the bedroom, their faces blurring. And a
voice, kept saying: "I remember the time when Jim and
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jim Carran said: "Jim-George come back from the Forks yet?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet."</p>

<p>"Tell him I want to see him. Why does Caroline stay out of the
room so much?"</p>

<p>"They will come, Jim."</p>

<p>But he was thinking of something else. "Another time and another
place and I might have made something of my life."</p>

<p>"Jim, what do you regret?"</p>

<p>It was a question that drew him back, out of a hot, bright land
into a cool one. Lamplight glowed against evening's long dusk, and
Madge stood over him. The tick of an alarm clock made an abnormally
loud noise. He tried to lift his hand toward his wife, but though
his will went into his muscles his arm never stirred; and he knew
then he had come to the end of his time. She wasn't, he saw, crying
and that didn't surprise him. She had never been a woman to show
her feelings, or give way to the things most women did. It was a
pride that held her up; it was a pride which even, in some of his
smokiest hours, laid gentleness and a mystery on him. She was a
fair woman, looking down with a faithfulness which supported him as
he went out.</p>

<p>He said distinctly, "I am a wealthy man, but I have lost too
much. That is what I regret. It occurs to me that in all these
years I have never said that I loved you. I do. You are the one
woman in the world I have ever loved, or respected."</p>

<p>Just before he died, and while he was aware of the outer world,
she reached down and kissed him; and then he saw that there were
tears in her eyes. Her fingers held his arm; they made a steady
pressure, as though she were guiding him on his trip. It came to
him then as his final thought that this gentle pressure had guided
him all his days and had colored his world for him in strange ways.
And so he died, as close to the meaning of his life as he ever
got.</p>

<p>George Berryman came in at that moment and saw this little
scene, with Madge Carran bent over the bed. He didn't speak till
she had risen. Then he said:</p>

<p>"The man was great. He really was. None of his sins were
small."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. A Day in Town</h2>

<p>They reached Two Dance around ten that morning and turned into
the big lot between the courthouse and the Cattle King Hotel. Most
of the homesteaders camped here when they came to town, for after a
slow ride across the sage flats, underneath so hot and so yellow a
sun, the shade of the huge locust trees was a comfort. Joe Blount
unhitched and watered the horses and tied them to a pole. He was a
long and loose and deliberate man who had worked with his hands too
many years to waste motion, and if he dallied more than usual over
his chores now it was because he dreaded the thing ahead of
him.</p>

<p>His wife sat on the wagon's seat, holding the baby. She had a
pin in her mouth and she was talking around it to young Tom: "Stay
away from the horses on the street and don't you go near the
railroad tracks. Keep hold of May's hand. She's too little to be
alone, you remember. Be sure to come back by noon."</p>

<p>Young Tom was seven and getting pretty thin from growth. The
trip to town had him excited. He kept nodding his sun-bleached
head, he kept tugging at little May's hand, and then both of them
ran headlong for the street and turned the corner of the Cattle
King, shrilly whooping as they disappeared.</p>

<p>Blount looked up at his wife. She was a composed woman and not
one to bother people with talk and sometimes it was hard for a man
to know what was in her mind. But he knew what was there now, for
all their problems were less than this one and they had gone over
it pretty thoroughly the last two-three months. He moved his
fingers up to the pocket of his shirt and dropped them immediately
away, searching the smoky horizon with his glance. He didn't expect
to see anything over there, but it was better than meeting her eyes
at this moment. He said in his patiently low voice: "Think we could
make it less than three hundred?" The baby moved its arms, its
warm-wet fingers aimlessly brushing Hester Blount's cheeks. She
said: "I don't see how. We kept figuring&mdash;and it never gets
smaller. You know best, Joe."</p>

<p>"No," he murmured, "it never gets any smaller. Well, three
hundred. That's what I'll ask for." And yet, with the chore before
him, he kept his place by the dropped wagon tongue. He put his
hands in his pockets and drew a long breath and looked at the
powdered earth below him with a sustained gravity, and was like
this when Hester Blount spoke again. He noticed that she was pretty
gentle with her words: "Why, now, Joe, you go on. It isn't like you
were shiftless and hadn't tried. He knows you're a hard worker and
he knows your word's good. You just go ahead."</p>

<p>"Guess we've both tried," he agreed. "And I guess he knows how
it's been. We ain't alone." He went out toward the street,
reminding himself of this. They weren't alone. All the people along
Christmas Creek were burned out, so it wasn't as if he had failed
because he didn't know how to farm. The thought comforted him a
good deal; it restored a little of his pride. Crossing the street
toward Dunmire's stable, he met Chess Roberts, with whom he had
once punched cattle on the Hat outfit, and he stopped in great
relief and palavered with Chess for a good ten minutes until,
looking back, he saw his wife still seated on the wagon. That sight
vaguely troubled him and he drawled to Chess, "Well, I'll see you
later," and turned quite slowly toward the bank.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the bank's old-fashioned room to take a
man's attention. Yet when he came into its hot, shaded silence Joe
Blount removed his hat and felt ill at ease as he walked toward
Lane McKercher. There was a pine desk and on the wall a railroad
map showing the counties of the Territory in colors. Over at the
other side of the room stood the cage where McKercher's son waited
on the trade.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
McKercher was big and bony and gray and his eyes could cut. They
were that penetrating, as everybody agreed. "Been a long time since
you came to town. Sit down and have a talk," and his glance saw
more about Joe Blount than the homesteader himself could ever tell.
"How's Christmas Creek?"</p>

<p>Blount settled in the chair. He said, "Why, just fine," and laid
his hands over the hat in his lap. Weather had darkened him and
work had thinned him and gravity remained like a stain on his
checks. He was, McKercher recalled, about thirty years old, had
once worked as a puncher on Hat and had married a girl from a small
ranch over in the Yellows. Thirty wasn't so old, yet the country
was having its way with Joe Blount. When he dropped his head the
skin around his neck formed a loose crease and his mouth had that
half-severe expression which comes from too much trouble. This was
what McKercher saw. This and the blue army shirt, washed and mended
until it was as thin as cotton, and the man's long hard hands lying
so loose before him.</p>

<p>McKercher said, "A little dry over your way?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Blount, "a little. Yeah, a little bit dry."</p>

<p>The banker sat back and waited, and the silence ran on a long
while. Blount moved around in the chair and lifted his hand and
reversed the hat on his lap. His eyes touched McKercher and passed
quickly on to the ceiling. He stirred again, not comfortable. One
hand reached up to the pocket of his shirt, dropping quickly
back.</p>

<p>"Something on your mind, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Blount, "Hester and I have figured it out pretty
close. It would take about three hundred dollars until next crop.
Don't see how it could be less. There'd be seed and salt for stock
and grub to put in and I guess some clothes for the kids. Seems
like a lot but we can't seem to figure it any smaller."</p>

<p>"A loan?" said McKercher.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Blount, relieved that the explaining was
over.</p>

<p>"Now, let's see. You've got another year to go before you get
title to your place. So that's no security. How was your
wheat?"</p>

<p>"Burnt out. No rain over there in April."</p>

<p>"How much stock?"</p>

<p>"Well, not much. Just two cows. I sold off last fall. The graze
was pretty skinny." He looked at McKercher and said in the briefest
way, "I got nothing to cover this loan. But I'm a pretty good
worker."</p>

<p>McKercher turned his eyes toward the desk. There wasn't much to
be seen behind the cropped gray whiskers of his face. According to
the country this was why he wore them&mdash;so that a man could
never tell what he figured. But his shoulders rose and dropped and
he spoke regretfully: "There's no show for you on that ranch, Joe.
Dry farming&mdash;it won't do. All you fellows are burned out. This
country never was meant for it. It's cattle land and that's about
all."</p>

<p>He let it go like that, and waited for the homesteader to come
back with a better argument. Only, there was no argument. Joe
Blount's lips changed a little and his hands flattened on the peak
of his hat. He said in a slow, mild voice, "Well, I can see it your
way all right," and got up. His hand strayed up to the shirt pocket
again, and fell away&mdash;and McKercher, looking straight into the
man's eyes, saw an expression there hard to define. The banker
shook his head. Direct refusal was on his tongue and it wasn't like
him to postpone it, which he did. "I'll think it over. Come back
about two o'clock."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Blount, and turned across the room, his long frame
swinging loosely, his knees springing as he walked, saving energy.
After he had gone out of the place McKercher remembered the way the
homesteader's hand had gone toward the shirt pocket. It was a
gesture that remained in the banker's mind.</p>

<p>Blount stopped outside the bank. Hester, at this moment, was
passing down toward the dry-goods store with the baby in her arms.
He waited until she had gone into the store and then walked on
toward the lower end of town, not wanting her to see him just then.
He knew McKercher would turn him down at two o'clock. He had heard
it pretty plainly in the banker's tone, and he was thinking of all
the things he had meant to explain to McKercher. He was telling
McKercher that one or two bad years shouldn't count against a man.
That the land on Christmas Creek would grow the best winter wheat
in the world. That you had to take the dry with the wet. But he
knew he'd never say any of this. The talk wasn't in him, and never
had been. Young Tom and little May were across the street, standing
in front of Swing's restaurant, seeing something that gripped their
interest. Joe Blount looked at them from beneath the lowered brim
of his hat; they were skinny with age and they needed some clothes.
He went on by, corning against Chess Roberts near the saloon.</p>

<p>Chess said: "Well, we'll have a drink on this."</p>

<p>The smell of the saloon drifted out to Joe Blount, its odor of
spilled whisky and tobacco smoke starting the saliva in his jaws,
freshening a hunger. But Hester and the kids were on his mind and
something told him it was unseemly, the way things were. He said:
"Not right now, Chess. I got some chores to tend. What you
doing?"</p>

<p>"You ain't heard? I'm riding for Hat again."</p>

<p>Blount said: "Kind of quiet over my way. Any jobs for a man on
Hat?" "Not now," said Chess. "We been layin' off summer help. A
little bit tough this year, Joe. You havin' trouble on Christmas
Creek?"</p>

<p>"Me? Not a bit, Chess. We get along. It's just that I like to
keep workin'."</p>

<p>After Chess had gone, Joe Blount laid the point of his shoulder
against the saloon wall and watched his two children walk hand in
hand past the windows of the general store. Young Tom pointed and
swung his sister around; and both of them had their faces against a
window, staring in. Blount pulled his eyes away. It took the kids
to do things that scraped a man's pride pretty hard, that made him
feel his failure. Under the saloon's broad awning lay shade, but
sweat cracked through his forehead and he thought quickly of what
he could do. Maybe Dunmire could use a man to break horses. Maybe
he could get on hauling wood for the feed store. This was Saturday
and the big ranch owners would be coming down the Two Dance grade
pretty soon. Maybe there was a hole on one of those outfits. It was
an hour until noon, and at noon he had to go back to Hester. He
turned toward the feed store.</p>

<p>Hester Blount stood at the dry-goods counter of Vetten's store.
Vetten came over, but she said, "I'm just trying to think." She
laid the baby on the counter and watched it lift its feet straight
in the air and aimlessly try to catch them with its hands; and she
was thinking that the family needed a good many things. Underwear
all around, and stockings and overalls. Little May had to have some
material for a dress, and some ribbon. You couldn't let a girl grow
up without a few pretty things, even out on Christmas Creek. It
wasn't good for the girl. Copper-toed shoes for young Tom, and a
pair for his father; and lighter buttoned ones for May. None of
these would be less than two dollars and a half, and it was a crime
the way it mounted up. And plenty of flannel for the baby.</p>

<p>She had not thought of herself until she saw the dark gray bolt
of silk lying at the end of the counter, and when she saw it
something happened to her heart. It wasn't good to be so poor that
the sight of a piece of silk made you feel this way. She turned
from it, ashamed of her thoughts&mdash;as though she had been
guilty of extravagance. Maybe if she were young again and still
pretty, and wanting to catch a man's eyes, it might not be so silly
to think of clothes. But she was no longer young or pretty and she
had her man. She could take out her love of nice things on little
May, who was going to be a very attractive girl. As soon as Joe was
sure of the three hundred dollars she'd come back here and get what
they all had to have&mdash;and somehow squeeze out the few pennies
for dress material and the hair ribbon.</p>

<p>She stood here thinking of these things and so many
others&mdash;a tall and rather comely woman in her early thirties,
darkfaced and carrying an even, sweet-lipped gravity while her eyes
sought the dry-goods shelves and her hand unconsciously patted the
baby's round middle.</p>

<p>A woman came bustling into the store and said in a loud,
accented voice: "Why, Hester Blount, of all the people I never
expected to see!"</p>

<p>Hester said, "Now, isn't this a surprise!" and the two took each
other's hands, and fell into a quick half embrace. Ten years ago
they had been girls together over in the Two Dance, Hester and this
Lila Evenson who had married a town man. Lila was turning into a
heavy woman and, like many heavy women, she loved white and wore it
now, though it made her look big as a house. Above the tight collar
of the dress, her skin was a flushed red and a second chin faintly
trembled when she talked. Hester Blount stood motionless, listening
to that outpour of words, feeling the quick search of Lila's eyes.
Lila, she knew, would be taking everything in&mdash;her worn dress,
her heavy shoes, and the lines of her face.</p>

<p>"And another baby!" said Lila and bent over it and made a long
gurgling sound. "What a lucky woman! That's three? But ain't it a
problem, out there on Christmas Creek? Even in town here I worry so
much over my one darling."</p>

<p>"No," said Hester, "we don't worry. How is your husband?"</p>

<p>"So well," said Lila. "You know, he's bought the drugstore from
old Kerrin, who is getting old. He had done so well. We are lucky,
as we keep telling ourselves. And that reminds me. You must come up
to dinner. You really must come this minute."</p>

<p>They had been brought up on adjoining ranches and had ridden to
the same school and to the same dances. But that was so long ago,
and so much had changed them. And Lila was always a girl to throw
her fortunes in other people's faces. Hester said, gently,
regretfully: "Now, isn't it too bad! We brought a big lunch in the
wagon, thinking it would be easier. Joe has so many chores to do
here."</p>

<p>"I have often wondered about you, away out there," said Lila.
"Have you been well? It's been such a hard year for everybody. So
many homesteaders going broke."</p>

<p>"We are well," said Hester slowly, a small, hard pride in her
tone. "Everything's been fine."</p>

<p>"Now, that's nice," murmured Lila, her smile remaining fixed;
but her eyes, Hester observed, were sharp and busy&mdash;and
reading too much. Lila said, "Next time you come and see us," and
bobbed her head and went out of the store, her clothes rustling in
this quiet. Hester's lips went sharp-shut and quick color burned on
her cheeks. She took up the baby and turned into the street again
and saw that Tom hadn't come yet to the wagon. The children were
out of sight and there was nothing to do but wait. Hearing the
far-off halloo of a train's whistle, she walked on under the board
galleries to the depot.</p>

<p>Heat swirled around her and light flashed up from polished spots
on the iron rails. Around her lay the full monotony of the desert,
so familiar, so wide&mdash;and sometimes so hard to bear. Backed
against the yellow depot wall, she watched the train rush forward,
a high plume of white steam rising to the sky as it whistled to
warn them. And then it rushed by, engine and cars, in a great smash
of sound that stirred the baby in her arms. She saw men standing on
the platforms. Women's faces showed in the car windows, serene and
idly curious and not a part of Hester's world at all; and afterward
the train was gone, leaving behind the heated smell of steel and
smoke. When the quiet came back it was lonelier than before. She
turned back to the wagon.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
It was then almost twelve. The children came up, hot and weary and
full of excitement. Young Tom said: "The school is right in town.
They don't have to walk at all. It's right next to the houses. Why
don't they have to walk three miles like us?" And May said: "I saw
a china doll with real clothes and painted eyelashes. Can I have a
china doll?"</p>

<p>Hester changed the baby on the wagon seat. She said: "Walking is
good for people, Tom. Why should you expect a doll now, May?
Christmas is the time. Maybe Christmas we'll remember."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm hungry."</p>

<p>"Wait till your father comes," said Hester.</p>

<p>When he turned in from the street, later, she knew something was
wrong. He was always a deliberate man, not much given to smiling.
But he walked with his shoulders down and when he came up he said
only: "I suppose we ought to eat." He didn't look directly at her.
He had his own strong pride and she knew this wasn't like
him&mdash;to stand by the wagon's wheel, so oddly watching his
children. She reached under the seat for the box of sandwiches and
the cups and the jug of cold coffee. She said: "What did he say,
Joe?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing yet. He said come back at two. He wanted to think
about it."</p>

<p>She murmured, "It won't hurt us to wait," and laid out the
sandwiches. They sat on the shaded ground and ate, the children
with a quick, starved impatience, with an excited and aimless talk.
Joe Blount looked at them carefully. "What was it you saw in the
restaurant, sonny?"</p>

<p>"It smelled nice," said young May. "The smell came out the
door."</p>

<p>Joe Blount cleared his throat. "Don't stop like that in front of
the restaurant again."</p>

<p>"Can we go now? Can we go down by the depot?"</p>

<p>"You hold May's hand," said Blount, and watched them leave. He
sat cross-legged before his wife, his big hands idle, his
expression unstirred. The sandwich, which was salted bacon grease
spread on Hester's potato bread lay before him. "Ain't done enough
this morning to be hungry," he said.</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
They were never much at talking. And now there wasn't much to say.
She knew that he had been turned down. She knew that at two o'clock
he would go and come back empty-handed. Until then she wouldn't
speak of it, and neither would he. And she was thinking with a
woman's realism of what lay before them. They had nothing except
this team and wagon and two cows standing unfed in the barn lot.
Going back to Christmas Creek now would be going back only to pack
up and leave. For they had delayed asking for this loan until the
last sack of flour in the storehouse had been emptied.</p>

<p>He said: "I been thinking. Not much to do on the ranch this
fall. I ought to get a little outside work."</p>

<p>"Maybe you should."</p>

<p>"Fact is, I've tried a few places. Kind of quiet. But I can look
around some more." She said, "I'll wait here."</p>

<p>He got up, a rangy, spare man who found it hard to be idle. He
looked at her carefully and his voice didn't reveal anything: "If I
were you I don't believe I'd order anything at the stores until I
come back."</p>

<p>She watched the way he looked out into the smoky horizon, the
way he held his shoulders. When he turned away, not meeting her
eyes, her lips made a sweet line across her dark face, a softly
maternal expression showing. She said, "Joe," and waited until he
turned. "Joe, we'll always get along."</p>

<p>He went away again, around the corner of the Cattle King. She
shifted her position on the wagon's seat, her hand gently patting
the baby who was a little cross from the heat. One by one she went
over the list of necessary things in her mind, and one by one,
erased them. It was hard to think of little May without a ribbon in
her hair, without a good dress. Boys could wear old clothes, as
long as they were warm; but a girl, a pretty girl, needed the touch
of niceness. It was hard to be poor.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Coming out of the bank at noon, Lane McKercher looked into the
corral space and saw the Blounts eating their lunch under the
locust tree. He turned down Arapahoe Street, walking through the
comforting shade of the poplars to the big square house at the end
of the lane. At dinner hour his boy took care of the bank, and so
he ate his meal with the housekeeper in a dining room whose shades
had been tightly drawn&mdash;the heavy midday meal of a man who had
developed his hunger and his physique from early days on the range.
Afterward he walked to the living-room couch and lay down with a
paper over his face for the customary nap.</p>

<p>A single fly made a racket in the deep quiet, but it was not
this that kept him from sleeping. In some obscure manner the shape
of Joe Blount came before him&mdash;the long, patient and
work-stiffened shape of a man whose eyes had been so blue and so
calm in face of refusal. Well, there had been something behind
those eyes for a moment, and then it had passed away, eluding
McKercher's sharp glance.</p>

<p>They were mostly all patient ones and seldom
speaking&mdash;these men that came off the deep desert. A hard life
had made them that way, as McKercher knew, who had shared that life
himself. Blount was no different than the others and many times
McKercher had refused these others, without afterthoughts. It was
some other thing that kept his mind on Blount. Not knowing why, he
lay quietly on the couch, trying to find the reason.</p>

<p>The country, he told himself, was cattle country, and those who
tried to dry-farm it were bound to fail. He had seen them fail,
year after year. They took their wagons and their families out
toward Christmas Creek, loaded high with plunder; and presently
they came back with their wagons baked and their eyebrows bleached
and nothing left. With their wives sitting in the wagons, old from
work, with their children long and thin from lack of food. They had
always failed and always would. Blount was a good man, but so were
most of the rest. Why should he be thinking of Blount?</p>

<p>He rose at one o'clock, feeling the heat and feeling his age;
and washed his hands and face with good cold water. Lighting a
cigar, he strolled back down Arapahoe and walked across the square
toward the Cattle King. Mrs. Blount sat on the wagon's seat,
holding a baby: The older youngsters, he noticed, were in the cool
runway of Dunmire's stable. He went into the saloon, though not to
drink.</p>

<p>"Nick," he said, "Joe Blount been in for a drink yet?"</p>

<p>The saloonkeeper looked up from an empty poker table. "No," he
said.</p>

<p>McKercher went out, crossing to Billy Saxton's feed store. Deep
in the big shed Billy Saxton weighed hay bales on his heavy scales.
He stopped and sopped the sweat off his forehead, and smiled.
"Bankin'," he stated, "is easier."</p>

<p>"Maybe it is," said Lane McKercher. "You know Joe Blount
well?"</p>

<p>"Why, he's all right. Used to ride for Hat. Old man Dale liked
him. He was in here a while back."</p>

<p>"To buy feed?"</p>

<p>"No, he wanted to haul wood for me."</p>

<p>McKercher went back up the street toward the bank. Jim Benbow
was coming down the road from the Two Dance hills, kicking a long
streamer of dust behind. Sun struck the windows on the north side
of town, setting up a brilliant explosion of light. Joe Blount came
out of the stable and turned over toward the Cattle King, waiting
for Benbow.</p>

<p>In the bank, McKercher said to his son, "All right, you go eat,"
and sat down at his pine desk. Benbow put his head through the
front door calling: "I'll need five thousand this week,
Mac&mdash;until the stock check comes in."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>He sat quite still at the desk, stern with himself because he
could not recall why he kept thinking of Joe Blount. Men were
everything to Lane McKercher, who watched them pass along this
street year in and year out, who studied them with his sharp eyes
and made his judgments concerning them. If there was something in a
man, it had to come out. And what was it in Joe Blount he couldn't
name? The echoes of the big clock on the wall rattled around the
droning silence of the bank like the echo of feet striking the
floor; it was then a quarter of two, and he knew he had to refuse
Blount a second time. He could not understand why he had not made
the first turndown final.</p>

<p>Blount met Jim Benbow on the corner of the Cattle King, directly
after Hat's owner had left the bank. He shook Benbow's hand, warmed
and pleased by the tall cattleman's smile of recognition. Benbow
said: "Been a long time since I saw you. How's Christmas Creek,
Joe?"</p>

<p>"Fine&mdash;just fine. You're lookin' good. You don't get
old."</p>

<p>"Well, let's go have a little smile on that."</p>

<p>"Why, thanks, no. I was wonderin'. It's pretty quiet on my place
right now. Not much to do till spring. You need a man?" Benbow
shook his head. "Not a thing doing, Joe. Sorry."</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;of course," murmured Blount. "I didn't figure
there would be."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
He stood against the Cattle King's low porch rail after Benbow had
gone down the street, his glance lifted and fixed on the smoky
light of the desert beyond town. Shade lay around him but sweat
began to creep below his hatbrim. He was closely and quickly
thinking of places that might be open for a man, and knew there
were none in town and none on the range. This was the slack season
of the year. The children were over in front of the grocery store,
stopped by its door, hand in hand, round, dark cheeks lifted and
still. Blount swung his shoulders around, cutting them out of his
sight.</p>

<p>Sullen Ben Drury came out of the courthouse and passed Blount,
removing his cigar and speaking, and replacing the cigar again. Its
smell was like acid biting at Blount's jaw corners, and suddenly he
faced the bank with the odd and terrible despair of a man who has
reached the end of hope, and a strange thought came to him, which
was that the doors of that bank were wide open and money lay on the
counter inside for the taking.</p>

<p>He stood very still, his head down, and after a while he
thought: "An unseemly thing for a man to hold in his head." It was
two o'clock then and he turned over the square, going toward the
bank with his legs springing as he walked and all his muscles
loose. In the quietness of the room his boots dragged up odd sound.
He stood by Lane McKercher's desk, waiting without any show of
expression; he knew what McKercher would say.</p>

<p>McKercher said, slowly and with an odd trace of irritation:
"Joe, you're wasting your time on Christmas Creek. And you'd waste
the loan."</p>

<p>Blount said, mildly and courteously: "I can understand your
view. Don't blame you for not loanin' without security." He looked
over McKercher's head, his glance going through the window to the
far strip of horizon. "Kind of difficult to give up a thing," he
mused. "I figured to get away from ridin' for other folks and ride
for myself. Well, that was why we went to Christmas Creek. Maybe a
place the kids could have later. Man wants his children to have
somethin' better than he had."</p>

<p>"Not on Christmas Creek," said McKercher. He watched Joe Blount
with a closer and sharper interest, bothered by a feeling he could
not name. Bothered by it and turned impatient by it.</p>

<p>"Maybe, maybe not," said Blount. "Bad luck don't last forever."
Then he said, "Well, I shouldn't be talkin'. I thank you for your
time." He put on his hat, and his big hand moved up across his
shirt, to the pocket there&mdash;and dropped away. He turned toward
the door.</p>

<p>"Hold on," said Lane. "Hold on a minute." He waited till Blount
came back to the desk. He opened the desk's drawer and pulled out a
can of cigars, holding them up. "Smoke?"</p>

<p>There was a long delay, and it was strange to see the way Joe
Blount looked at the cigars, with his lips closely together. He
said, his voice dragging on the words, "I guess not, but
thanks."</p>

<p>Lane McKercher looked down at the desk, his expression breaking
out of its maintained strictness. The things in a man had to come
out, and he knew now why Joe Blount had stayed so long in his mind.
It made him look up. "I have been considering this. It won't ever
be a matter of luck on Christmas Creek. It's a matter of water.
When I passed the feed store today I noticed a second hand windmill
in the back. It will do. You get hold of Plummer Bodry and find out
his price for driving you a well. I never stake a man unless I
stake him right. We will figure the three hundred and whatever it
takes to put up a tank and windmill. When you buy your supplies
today, just say you've got credit here."</p>

<p>"Why, now&mdash;" began Joe Blount in his slow, soft voice,
"I&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Lane McKercher said to his son, just coming back from lunch,
"I want you to bring your ledger over here." He kept on talking and
Joe Blount, feeling himself pushed out, turned and left the
bank.</p>

<p>McKercher's son came over. "Made that loan after all. Why?"</p>

<p>McKercher said only, "He's a good man, Bob." But he knew the
real reason. A man that smoked always carried his tobacco in his
shirt pocket. Blount had kept reaching, out of habit, for something
that wasn't there. Well, a man like Blount loved this one small
comfort and never went without it unless actually destitute. But
Blount wouldn't admit it, and had been too proud to take a free
cigar. Men were everything&mdash;and the qualities in them came out
sooner or later, as with Blount. A windmill and water was a good
risk with a fellow like that.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
Hester watched him cross the square and come toward her, walking
slowly, with his shoulders squared. She patted the baby's back and
gently rocked it, and wondered at the change. When he came up he
said, casually, "I'll hitch and drive around to the store, so we
can load the stuff you buy."</p>

<p>She watched him carefully, so curious to know how it had
happened. But she only said: "We'll get along."</p>

<p>He was smiling then, he who seldom smiled. "I guess you need a
few things for yourself. We can spare something for that."</p>

<p>"Only a dress and some ribbon, for May. A girl needs something
nice." She paused, and afterward added, because she knew how real
his need was, "Joe, you buy yourself some tobacco."</p>

<p>He let out a long, long breath. "I believe I will," he said.
They stood this way, both gently smiling. They needed no talk to
explain anything to each other. They had been through so much these
last few years. Hardship and trouble had drawn them so close
together that words were unnecessary. So they were silent,
remembering so much, and understanding so much, and still smiling.
Presently he turned to hitch up.</p>
