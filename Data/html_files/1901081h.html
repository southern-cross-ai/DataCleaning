Chick Coogan</b>
</h2>

<p>COOGAN didn't come to the Transcontinental a fullblown engineer
from some other road, as a good many of the boys have, though
that's nothing against them; Coogan was a product of the Hill
Division pure and simple. He began as a kid almost before the steel
was spiked home, and certainly before the right of way was shaken
down enough to begin to look like business. He started at the
bottom, and he went up. Call boy, sweeper, wiper, fireman&mdash;one
after the other. Promotion came fast in the early days, for, the
Rockies once bridged, business came fast, too; and Coogan had his
engine at twenty-one, and at twenty-four he was pulling the
Imperial Limited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good goods," said Regan. &ldquo;That's what he is. The
best ever."</p>

<p>Nobody questioned that, not only because there was no one on the
division who could put anything over Coogan in a cab, but also
because, and perhaps even more pertinent a reason, every one liked
Coogan&mdash;some of them did more than that.</p>

<p>Straight as a string, clean as a whistle was Coogan, six feet in
his stockings, with a body that played up to every inch of his
height, black hair, jet black, black eyes that laughed with you,
never <i>at</i> you, a smile and a cheery nod always&mdash;the kind
of a man that makes you feel every time you see him that the world
isn't such an eternal, dismal grind, after all. That was Chick
Coogan&mdash;all except his heart. Coogan had a heart like a
woman's, and a hard-luck story from a bo stealing a ride, a
railroad man, or any one else for that matter, never failed to make
him poorer by a generous percentage of what happened to be in his
pocket at the time. Who wouldn't like him! Queer how things
happen.</p>

<p>It was the day Coogan got married that Regan gave him No. 505
and the Limited run as a sort of wedding present, and that night
Big Cloud turned itself completely inside out doing honor and
justice to the occasion.</p>

<p>Big Cloud has had other celebrations, before and since, but none
quite so unanimous as that one. Restraint never did run an
overwhelmingly strong favorite with the town, but that night it was
hung up higher than the arms on the telegraph poles. Men that the
community used to hide behind and push forward as hostages of
righteousness, when it was on its good behavior and wanted to put
on a front, cut loose and outshone the best&mdash;or the worst, if
you like that better&mdash;of the crowd that never made any bones
about being on the other side of the fence.</p>

<p>They burned red flares, very many of them, that Carleton
neglected to imagine had any connection with the storekeeper and
the supply account; they committed indiscretions, mostly of a
liquid nature, that any one but the trainmaster, who was
temporarily blind in both eyes, could have seen; and, as a result,
the Hill Division the next day was an eminently paralytic and
feeble affair. This is a very general description of the event,
because sometimes it is not wise to particularize; this is a case
in point.</p>

<p>Coogan's send-off was a send-off no other man, be he king,
prince, president, shogun, or high-mucky-muck of whatever degree,
could have got&mdash;except Coogan. Coogan got it because he was
Coogan, just Coogan&mdash;and the night was a night to wonder
at.</p>

<p>Regan summarized it the next evening over the usual game of
pedro with Carleton, upstairs over the station in the super's
office. &ldquo;Apart from Coogan and me," said the master mechanic
in a voice that was still suspiciously husky, &ldquo;apart from
Coogan and me and <i>mabbe</i> the minister&mdash;" The rest was a
wave of his hand. Regan could wave his hand with a wealth of
eloquence that was astounding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so," agreed Carleton, with a grin. &ldquo;Too bad
to drag <i>them</i> into it, though. Both 'peds' to me, Tommy. It's
a good thing for the discipline of the division that bigamy is
against the law, what?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;They'll be talking of it," said Regan reminiscently,
&ldquo;when you and me are on the scrap heap, Carleton."</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess that's right," admitted the super. &ldquo;Play
on, Tommy."</p>

<p>But it wasn't. They talked of Coogan's wedding only for about a
year&mdash;no, they don't talk about it now.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2" id="Chapter2"></a>Chapter
2<br>
While They Played Cards</b>
</h2>

<p>THE Imperial Limited was the star run on the
division&mdash;Regan gave Coogan the thirty- third degree when he
gave him that&mdash;that and No. 505, which was the last word in
machine design. And Coogan took them, took them and the schedule
rights that pertained thereto, which were a clear and a clean-swept
track, and day after day, uphill and down, No. 1 or No. 2, as the
case might be, pulled into division on the dot.</p>

<p>Coogan's stock soared&mdash;if that were possible; but not
Coogan. The youngest engineer on the road and top of them all,
would have been excuse enough for him to show his oats, and, within
decent limits, no one would have thought the worse of him for
it&mdash;Coogan never turned a hair. He was still the friend of the
bo and the man in trouble, still the Coogan that had been a wiper
in the roundhouse; and yet, perhaps, not quite the same, for two
new loves had come into his life&mdash; his love for Annie Coogan
and his love, the love of the master craftsman, for No. 505. In the
little house at home he talked to Annie of the big mountain racer,
and Annie, being an engineer's daughter, as well as an engineer's
wife, listened with understanding and a smile, and in the smile was
pride and love; in the cab Coogan talked of Annie, always Annie,
and one day he told his fireman a secret that made big Jim Dahleen
grin sheepishly and stick out a grimy paw.</p>

<p>The days and the weeks and the months went by, and then there
came a morning when a sober, serious-faced group of men stood
gathered in the super's office, as No. 2's whistle, in from the
eastbound run, sounded down the gorge. They looked at Regan. Slowly
the master mechanic turned, went out of the room, and down the
stairs to the platform, as No. 505 shot round the bend and rolled
into the station. For a moment Regan stood irresolute, then he
started for the front end. He went no farther than the colonist
coach, that was coupled behind the mail car. Here he stopped, made
a step forward, changed his mind, climbed over the colonist's
platform, dropped down on the other side of the track, and began to
walk toward the roundhouse&mdash;they changed engines at Big Cloud,
and No. 505, already uncoupled, was scooting up for the spur to
back down for the table.</p>

<p>The soles of Regan's boots seemed like plates of lead as he went
along, and he mopped his forehead nervously.</p>

<p>There was a general air of desertion about the roundhouse. The
'table was set and ready for No. 505, but there wasn't a soul in
sight. Regan nodded to himself in sympathetic understanding. He
crossed the turntable, walked around the half circle, and entered
the roundhouse through the engine doors by the far pit&mdash;the
one next to that which belonged to No. 505. Here, just inside, he
waited, as the big mogul came slowly down the track, took the table
with a slight jolt, and stopped.</p>

<p>He saw Coogan, big, brawny, swing out of the cab like an
athlete, and then he heard the engineer speak to his fireman:
&ldquo;Looks like a graveyard around here, Tim. Wonder where the
boys are. I won't wait to swing the 'table; they'll be around in a
minute, I guess. I want to get up to the little woman."</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right," Dahleen answered. &ldquo;Leave her to me;
I'll run her in. Good luck to you, Chick."</p>

<p>Coogan was starting across the yards with a stride that was
almost a run. Regan opened his mouth to shout&mdash;and swallowed a
lump in his throat instead. Twice he made as though to follow the
engineer, and twice something stronger than himself held him back;
and then, as though he had been a thief, the master mechanic stole
out from behind the doors, went back across the tracks, climbed the
stairs to Carleton's room with lagging steps, and entered.</p>

<p>The rest were still there: Carleton in his swivel chair; Harvey,
the division engineer; Spence, the chief dispatcher, and Riley, the
trainmaster. Regan shook his head and dropped into a seat. &ldquo;I
couldn't," he said in a husky voice. &ldquo;For the life of me, I
<i>couldn't</i>," he repeated, and swept out his arms.</p>

<p>A bitter exclamation sprang from Carleton's lips, lips that were
not often profane, and his teeth snapped through the amber of his
brier. The others just looked out of the window.</p>

<p>MacVicar, a spare man, took the Limited out that night, and it
was three days before Coogan reported again. Maybe it was the fit
of the black store clothes, and perhaps the coat didn't hang just
right, but as he entered the roundhouse he didn't look as straight
as he used to look and there was a queer, inward slope to his
shoulders and he walked like a man who didn't see anything. The
springy swing through the gangway was gone. He climbed to the cab
as an old man climbs&mdash; painfully. The boys hung back, and
didn't say anything, just swore under their breaths with full
hearts, as men do. There wasn't anything <i>to</i> say&mdash;
nothing that would do any good.</p>

<p>Coogan took No. 505 and the Limited out that night, took it out
the night after and the nights that followed, only he didn't talk
any more, and the slope of the shoulders got a little more
pronounced, a little more noticeable, a little beyond the cut of
any coat. And on the afternoons of the lay-overs at Big Cloud,
Coogan walked out behind the town to where on the slope of the
butte were two fresh mounds&mdash;one larger than the other. That
was all.</p>

<p>Regan, short, paunchy, big-hearted Regan, tackled Jim Dahleen,
Coogan's fireman. &ldquo;What's he say on the run, Jim, h'm?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ain't talkative," Dahleen answered shortly.</p>

<p>'What the devil!" growled the master mechanic deep in his throat
to conceal his emotion. &ldquo;'Tain't doing him any good going up
there afternoons. Heaven knows it's natural enough, but 'tain't
doing him any good, not a mite&mdash;nor them, either, as far as I
can see, h'm? You got to <i>make</i> him talk, Jim. Wake him
up."</p>

<p>'Why don't <i>you</i> talk to him?" demanded the fireman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H'm, yes. So I will. I sure will," Regan answered.</p>

<p>And he meant to, meant to honestly. But somehow Coogan's eyes
and Coogan's face said &ldquo;no" to him as they did to every other
man, and as the days passed, almost a month of them, Regan shook
his head, perplexed and troubled, for he was fond of Coogan.</p>

<p>Then, one night, it happened.</p>

<p>Regan and Carleton were alone over their pedro at headquarters,
except for Spence, the dispatcher, in the next room. It was getting
close on to eleven-thirty. The Imperial Limited, westbound, with
Coogan in the cab, had pulled out on time an hour and a half
before. The game was lagging, and, as usual, the conversation had
got around to the engineer, introduced, as it always was, by the
master mechanic. &ldquo;I sure don't know what to do for the boy,"
he said. &ldquo;I'd like to do something. Talking don't amount to
anything, does it, h'm?&mdash;even if you <i>can</i> talk. I can't
talk to him, what?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man's got to work a thing like that out for himself,
Tommy," Carleton answered, &ldquo;and it takes time. That's the
only thing that will ever help him&mdash;time. I know you're pretty
fond of Coogan, even more than the rest of us, and that's saying a
good deal, but you're thinking too much about it yourself."</p>

<p>Regan shook his head. &ldquo;I can't help it, Carleton. It's got
<i>me</i>. Time, and that sort of thing, may be all right, but it
ain't very promising when a man broods the way he does. I ain't
superstitious or anything like that, but I've a feeling I can't
just explain that somehow something's going to break. Kind of
premonition. Ever have anything like that? It gets on your mind and
you can't shake it off. It's on me tonight worse than it's ever
been."</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense," Carleton laughed. &ldquo;Premonitions are out
of date, because they've been traced back to their origin. Out
here, I should say it was a case of too much of Dutchy's
lunch-counter pie. You ought to diet, anyway, Tommy; you're getting
too fat. Hand over that fine-cut of yours, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped as a sharp cry came from the dispatcher's room,
followed by an instant's silence; then the crash of a chair sounded
as, hastily pushed back, it fell to the floor. Quick steps echoed
across the room, and the next moment Spence, with a white face and
holding a sheet of tissue in his hand, burst in upon them.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3" id="Chapter3"></a>Chapter
3<br>
In Dahleen's Pocket</b>
</h2>

<p>CARLETON sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's the matter, Spence?" he demanded sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. 1," the dispatcher jerked out, and extended the sheet
on which he had scribbled the message as it came in off the
sounder.</p>

<p>Carleton snatched the paper, and Regan, leaping from his chair,
looked over his shoulder. They read:</p>

<p>No. 1, engine 505, jumped track east of switchback No. 2 in
Devil's Slide. Report three known to be killed, others missing.
Engineer Coogan and Fireman Dahleen both hurt.</p>

<p>Carleton was ever the man of action, and his voice rang hard as
chilled steel. &ldquo;Clear the line, Spence. Get your relief and
wrecker out at once. Wire Dreamer Butte for their wrecker as well,
so they can work from both ends. Now, then, Tommy&mdash;what's the
matter with you? Are you crazy"</p>

<p>Regan was leaning over the back of his chair, his face strained,
his arm outstretched, finger pointing to the wall. &ldquo;I knew
it," he muttered hoarsely. &ldquo;I knew it. That's what it
is."</p>

<p>Carleton's eyes traveled from the master mechanic to the wall
and back again in amazed bewilderment; then he shook Regan by the
shoulder. &ldquo;That's what what is?" he questioned brusquely.
&ldquo;Are you mad, man?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;The date," whispered Regan, still pointing to where a
large single-day calendar with big figures on it hung behind the
super's desk. &ldquo;It's the twenty-eighth."</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know what you mean, Tommy." Carleton's voice was
quiet, restrained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mean!" Regan burst out, with a hard laugh. &ldquo;I don't
mean anything, do I? 'Tain't anything to do with it; it's just
coincidence mabbe, and mabbe it's not. <i>It's a year ago tonight
Coogan was married</i>."</p>

<p>For a moment Carleton did not speak; like Regan, he stared at
the wall. &ldquo;You think that&mdash;"</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don't"&mdash;Regan caught him up
roughly&mdash;&ldquo;I don't think anything at all. I only know
it's queer, ghastly queer."</p>

<p>Carleton nodded his head slowly. Steps were coming up the
stairs. The voice of Flannagan, the wrecking boss, reached them;
other voices, excited and loud, joined in. He slapped the master
mechanic on the back. &ldquo;I don't wonder it caught you, Tommy,"
he said. &ldquo;It's almost creepy. But there's no time for that
now. Come on."</p>

<p>Regan laughed, the same hard laugh, as he followed the chief
into the dispatcher's room. &ldquo;East of No. 2 switchback, eh?"
he said. &ldquo;If there's any choice for hellishness anywhere on
that cursed stretch of track, that's it. By Heaven, it's come, and
it's come good and hard&mdash;good and hard."</p>

<p>It had. It was a bad mess, a nasty mess; but, like everything
else, it might have been worse. Instead of plunging to the right
and dropping to the ca&ntilde;on eighteen hundred feet below, No.
505 chose the inward side and rammed her nose into the gray mass of
rock that made the mountain wall. The wreckers from Dreamer Butte
and the wreckers from Big Cloud tell of it to this day. For
twenty-four hours they worked, and then they dropped, and fresh men
took their places.</p>

<p>There was no room to work&mdash;just the narrow ledge of the
right of way on a circular sweep with the jutting cliff of Old
Piebald Mountain sticking in between, hiding one of the gangs from
the other, and around which the big wrecking cranes groped dangling
arms and chains like fishers angling for a bite. It was a mauled
and tangled snarl, and the worst of it went over the ca&ntilde;on's
edge in pieces, as axes, sledges, wedges, bars, and cranes ripped
and tore their way to the heart of it. And as they worked, those
hard-faced, grimy, sweating men of the wrecking crews, they
wondered&mdash;wondered that any one had come out of it alive.</p>

<p>Back at headquarters in Big Cloud they wondered at it,
too&mdash;and they wondered also at the cause. Every one that by
any possible chance could throw any light upon it went on the
carpet in the super's office. Everybody testified&mdash; everybody
except Dahleen, the fireman, and Coogan, the engineer; and they
didn't testify because they couldn't. Coogan was in the hospital
with queer, inconsequent words upon his tongue and a welt across
his forehead that had laid bare the bone from eye to the hair line
of his skull; and Dahleen was there also, not so bad, just
generally jellied up, but still too bad to talk. And the testimony
was of little use.</p>

<p>The tender of switchback No. 1 reported that the Limited had
passed him at perhaps a little greater speed than usual&mdash;which
was the speed of a man's walk, for trains crawl down the Devil's
Slide with fear and caution&mdash;but not fast enough to cause him
to think anything about it.</p>

<p>Hardy, the conductor, testified. Hardy said it was the
&ldquo;air;" that the train began to slide faster and faster after
the first switchback was passed, and that her speed kept on
increasing up to the moment that the crash came. He figured that it
couldn't be anything else&mdash;just the &ldquo;air"&mdash;it
wouldn't work, and the control of the train was lost. That was all
he knew.</p>

<p>And while Regan swore and fumed, Carleton's face set grim and
hard, and he waited for Dahleen.</p>

<p>It was a week before the fireman faced Carleton across the
super's desk, but when that time came Carleton opened on him
straight from the shoulder, not even a word of sympathy, not so
much as &ldquo;glad to see you're out again," just straight to the
point, hard and quick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dahleen," he snapped, &ldquo;I want to know what happened
in the cab that night, and I want a straight story. No other kind
of talking will do you any good."</p>

<p>Dahleen's face, white with the pallor of his illness, flushed
suddenly red. &ldquo;You're jumping a man pretty hard, aren't you,
Mr. Carleton?" he said resentfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I've reason to," replied Carleton. &ldquo;Well, I'm
waiting for that story."</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no story that I know of," said Dahleen evenly.
&ldquo;After we passed switchback No. 1 we lost control of the
train&mdash;the 'air' wouldn't work."</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you expect me to believe that?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don't seem to," retorted Dahleen, with a set jaw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do to stop her?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I could," said Dahleen, with terse finality.</p>

<p>Carleton sprang to his feet, and his fist crashed down upon the
desk. &ldquo;You are lying!" he thundered. &ldquo;That wreck and
the lives that are lost are at your door, and if I could prove it!"
He shook his fist at the fireman. &ldquo;As it is, I can only fire
you for violation of the rules. I thought at first it was Coogan
and that he'd gone off his head a bit, and you are cur enough to
let the blame go there if you could, to let me and every other man
think so!"</p>

<p>Dahleen's fists clenched, and he took a step forward.
&ldquo;That's enough!" he cried hoarsely. &ldquo;Enough from you or
any other man!"</p>

<p>Carleton rounded on him more furiously than before. &ldquo;I've
given you a chance to tell a straight story, and you wouldn't.
Heaven knows what you did that night. I believe you were fighting
drunk. I believe that gash in Coogan's head wasn't from the wreck.
If I knew I'd fix you." He wrenched open a drawer of his desk,
whipped out a metal whisky flask, and shook it before Dahleen's
eyes. &ldquo;<i>When you were picked up this was in the pocket of
your jumper!</i>"</p>

<p>The color fled from Dahleen's face, leaving it whiter than when
he had entered the room. He wet his lips with the tip of his
tongue. All the bluster, all the fight was gone. He stared mutely,
a startled, frightened look in his eyes, at the damning evidence in
the super's hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgotten about it, had you?" Carleton flung out grimly.
&ldquo;Well, have you anything to say ?" Dahleen shook his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain't anything <i>to</i> say, is there?" His voice was
low, with just a hint of the former defiance. &ldquo;It's mine, but
you can't <i>prove</i> anything. You can't prove I drank it. D'ye
think I'd be fool enough to do anything but keep my mouth
shut?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I can <i>prove</i> it." Carleton's voice was deadly
cold. &ldquo;You're out! I'll give you twelve hours to get out of
the mountains. The boys, for Coogan's sake alone, if for no other,
would tear you to pieces if they knew the story. No one knows it
yet but the man who found this in your pocket and myself. I'm not
going to tell you again what I think of you&mdash;<i>get
out!</i>"</p>

<p>Dahleen, without a word, swung slowly on his heel and started
for the door.</p>

<p>'Wait!" said Carleton suddenly. &ldquo;Here's a pass East for
you. I don't want your blood on my hands, as I would have if
Coogan's friends, and that's every last soul out here, got hold of
you. You've got twelve hours&mdash;after that they'll know&mdash;to
set Coogan straight."</p>

<p>Dahleen hesitated, came back, took the slip of paper with a
mirthless, half-choked laugh, turned again, and the door closed
behind him. Dahleen was out.</p>

As Strong Men Talk.</b>
</h2>

<p>CARLETON kept his word&mdash;twelve hours&mdash; and then from
the division rose a cry like the cry of savage beasts; but Regan
was like a madman. &ldquo;Curse him!" he said bitterly, breaking
into a seething torrent of words. 'What did you let him go for,
Carleton? You'd no business to. You should have held him until
Coogan could talk, and then we'd have had him."</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tommy"&mdash;Carleton laid his hand quietly on the master
mechanic's shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;we're too young out in this
country for much law. I don't think Coogan knows or ever will know
again what happened in the cab that night. The doctors don't seem
quite able to call the turn on him themselves, so they've said to
you and said to me. But whether he does or not, it doesn't make any
difference so far as Dahleen goes. It would have been murder to
keep him here. And if Coogan ever can talk he'll never put a mate
in bad no matter what the consequences to himself. There's nothing
against Dahleen except that he had liquor in his possession while
on duty. That's what I fired him for; that's the only story that's
gone out of this office. You and I and the rest are free to put the
construction on it that suits us best, and there it ends. If I was
wrong to let him go, I was wrong. I did what I thought was right;
that's all I can ever do."</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mabbe," growled Regan, &ldquo;mabbe; but, hang him, he
<i>ought</i> to be murdered. I'd like to have had 'em done it! It's
that smash on the head put Coogan to the bad. You're right about
one thing, I guess; he'll never be the same Coogan again."</p>

<p>And in a way this was so; in another it wasn't. It was not the
wound that was to blame&mdash; the doctors were positive about
that&mdash;but Coogan, it was pitifully evident, was not the same.
Physically, at the end of a month, he left the hospital apparently
as well as he had ever been in his life; but mentally, somewhere, a
cog had slipped. His brain seemed warped and weakened, simple as a
child's in its workings; his memory fogged and dazed, full of
indefinite, intangible snatches, vague, indeterminate glimpses of
his life before. One thing seemed to cling to him, to predominate,
to sway him&mdash;the Devil's Slide.</p>

<p>Regan and Carleton talked to him, trying to guide his thoughts
and stimulate his memory. &ldquo;You remember you used to drive an
engine, don't you, Chick?" asked Carleton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Engine?" Coogan nodded. &ldquo;Yes, in the Devil's
Slide."</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. 505," said Regan quickly. &ldquo;You know old
505."</p>

<p>Coogan shook his head.</p>

<p>Carleton tried another tack. &ldquo;You were in a bad accident,
Coogan, one night. You were in the cab of the engine when she went
to smash. Do you remember that?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;The smash was on the Devil's Slide," said Coogan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's it," cried Carleton. &ldquo;I knew you'd
remember."</p>

<p>&ldquo;They're always there," said Coogan simply, &ldquo;always
there. It is a bad track. I'm a railroad man and I know. It's not
properly guarded. I'm going to work there and take care of it."</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work there?" said Regan, the tears almost in his eyes.
&ldquo;What kind of work? What do you want to do, Chick?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just work there," said Coogan. &ldquo;Take care of the
Devil's Slide."</p>

<p>The super and the master mechanic looked at each other&mdash;and
averted their eyes. Then they took Coogan up to his boarding house,
where he had moved after Annie and the little one died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'll never put his finger on a throttle again," said
Regan, with a choke in his voice, as they came out. &ldquo;The best
man that ever pulled a latch, the best man that ever drew a pay
check on the Hill Division. It's hell, Carleton; that's what it is.
I don't think he really knew you or me. He don't seem to remember
much of anything, though he's natural enough and able enough to
take care of himself in all other ways. Just kind of simplelike.
It's queer the way that Devil's Slide has got him, what? We can't
let him go out there."</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he remembers Annie," said Carleton. &ldquo;I
was afraid to ask him. I didn't know what effect it might have. No;
we can't let him go out on the Devil's Slide."</p>

<p>But the doctors said yes. They went further and said it was
about the only chance he had. The thing was on his mind. It was
better to humor him, and that, with the outdoor mountain life, in
time might bring him around again.</p>

<p>And so, while Regan growled and swore, and Carleton knitted his
brows in perplexed protest, the doctors had their way&mdash;and
Coogan, Chick Coogan, went to the Devil's Slide. Officially he was
on the pay roll as a section hand; but Millrae, the section boss,
had his own orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let Coogan alone. Let him do what he likes, only see that
he doesn't come to any harm," wired the super.</p>

<p>And Coogan, when Millrae asked him what he wanted to do,
answered simply: &ldquo;I'm going to take care of the Devil's
Slide."</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Chick," the section boss agreed cheerily.
&ldquo;It's up to you. Fire ahead."</p>

<p>At first no one understood; perhaps even at the end no one quite
understood&mdash;possibly Coogan least of all. He may have done
some good&mdash;or he may not. In time they came to call him the
Guardian of the Devil's Slide&mdash;not slightingly, but as strong
men talk, defiant of ridicule, with a gruff ring of assertion in
their tones that brooked no question.</p>

<p>Up and down, down and up, two miles east, two miles west, Coogan
patrolled the Devil's Slide, and never a weakened rail, a sunken
tie, a loosened spike escaped him; he may have done some good, or
he may not.</p>

<p>He slept here and there in one of the switchback tenders'
shanties, moved and governed by no other consideration than
fatigue; day and night were as things apart. He ate with them, too;
and scrupulously he paid his footing. Twenty-five cents for a meal,
twenty-five cents for a bunk or a blanket on the floor. They took
his money because he forced it upon them, furiously angry at a hint
of refusal; but mostly the coin would be slipped back unnoticed
into the pocket of Coogan's coat&mdash;poor men and rough they
were, nothing of veneer, nothing of polish; grimy, overalled,
horny-fisted toilers, their hearts were big if their purses
weren't.</p>

<p>At all hours&mdash;in the early dawn, at midday, or late
afternoon&mdash;the train crews and the engine crews on passengers,
specials, and freights passed Coogan up and down, always walking
with his head bent forward, his eyes fastened on the right of
way&mdash;passed with a cheery hail and the flirt of a hand from
cab, caboose, or the ornate tail of a garish Pullman. And to the
tourists he came to be more of an attraction than the scenic
grandeur of the Rockies themselves; they stared from the
observation car and listened, with a running fire of wondering
comment, as the brass-buttoned porters told the story, until at
last to have done the Rockies and have missed the Guardian of the
Devil's Slide was to have done them not at all.</p>

<p>It was natural enough; anything out of the ordinary ministers to
and arouses the public's curiosity. Not very nice perhaps,
no&mdash;but natural. The railroad men didn't like it, and that was
natural, too; but their feelings or opinions, in the very nature of
things, had little effect one way or the other.</p>

<p>Coogan grew neither better nor worse. The months passed and he
grew neither better nor worse. Winter came, and, with the trestle
that went out in the big storm that year, Coogan went into Division
for the last time, went over the Great Divide, the same simple,
broken-minded Coogan that had begun his self-appointed task in the
spring; he may have done some good, or he may not. They found him
after two or three days, and sent him back to Big Cloud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He'd have chosen that himself if he could have chosen,"
said Carleton soberly. &ldquo;Heaven knows what the end would have
been. The years would have been all alike; he'd never have got his
mind back. It's all for the best."</p>

<p>Regan did not answer. Philosophy and the master mechanic's heart
did not always measure things alike.</p>

<p>The Brotherhood took charge of the arrangements, and Coogan's
funeral was the biggest funeral Big Cloud ever had. Everybody
wanted to march, so they held the service late in the afternoon and
closed down the shops at half past four; and the shop hands, from
the boss fitter to the water boy, turned out to the last
man&mdash;and so did every one else in town.</p>

<p>It was getting dark and already supper time when it was over,
but Carleton, who had left some unfinished work on his desk, went
back to his office instead of going home. He lighted the lamp, put
on the chimney, but the match was still burning when the door
opened and a man, with his hat pulled far down over his face,
stepped in and closed it behind him.</p>

<p>Carleton whirled around, the match dropped to the floor, and he
leaned forward over his desk, a hard look settling on his face. The
man had pushed back his hat. It was Dahleen, Coogan's fireman, Jim
Dahleen.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5" id="Chapter5"></a>Chapter

Why The &ldquo;Air" Would Not Work</b>
</h2>

<p>FOR a moment neither man spoke.</p>

<p>Bitter words rose to Carleton's tongue, but something in the
other's face checked and held them back.</p>

<p>It was Dahleen who spoke first. &ldquo;I heard about
Chick&mdash;that he'd gone out," he said quietly. &ldquo;I don't
suppose it did him any good, but I kind of had to chip in on the
good-by; Chick and me used to be pretty thick. I saw you come down
here, and I followed you. Don't stare at me like that; you'd have
done the same. Have you got that flask yet?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes," Carleton answered mechanically, and as mechanically
produced it from the drawer of his desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever examine it particularly?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;Examine it?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess that answers my question. I was afraid you might,
and I wanted to ask you for it that day, only I thought you'd think
it mighty funny, refuse, and well&mdash;well, get to looking it
over on your own hook. Will you give it here for a minute?"</p>

<p>Carleton handed it over silently.</p>

<p>Dahleen took it, pulled off the lower half that served as
drinking cup, laid his finger on the inside rim, and returned it to
the super.</p>

<p>Carleton moved nearer to the light; then his face paled. <i>It
was Coogan's flask!</i> The inscription, a little dulled, in fine
engraving, was still plain enough. &ldquo;To Chick from Jim, on the
occasion of his wedding."</p>

<p>Carleton's hand was trembling as he set it down. &ldquo;Great
Heaven!" he said hoarsely. &ldquo;It was Coogan who was drunk that
night&mdash;not you."</p>

<p>&ldquo;I figured that's the way you'd read it, you or any other
railroad man," said Dahleen. &ldquo;It was him or me, and one of us
drunk, in the eyes of any of the boys on the road, from the minute
that flask showed up. There was only one thing would have made you
believe different, and I couldn't tell you&mdash;then. I'd have
taken the same stand you did. But you're wrong. Coogan wasn't drunk
that night; he never touched a drop. I wouldn't be telling you this
now if he had, would I?"</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down," said Carleton.</p>

<p>Dahleen took the chair beside the desk, and, resting his feet on
the window sill, stared out at the lights twinkling below him.
&ldquo;Yes, I gave him the flask," he said slowly, as though
picking up the thread of a story, &ldquo;for a wedding present. The
day he came back to his run after the little woman and the baby
died he had it in his pocket, and he handed it to me. '<i>I'm
afraid of it, Jimmy</i>,' he said. That was all, just
that&mdash;only he <i>looked</i> at me. Then he got down out of the
cab to oil round, me still holding it in my hand, for the words
kind of hit me; they meant a whole lot. Well, before he came back,
I lifted up my seat and chucked it down in the box underneath. I
don't want to make a long story of this. You know how he took to
brooding. Sometimes he wouldn't say a word from one end of the run
to the other. And once in a while he seemed to act a little queer.
I didn't think much of it, and I didn't say anything to anybody,
figuring it would wear off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we pulled out of Big Cloud the night of the wreck,"
Dahleen went on, &ldquo;I didn't see anything out of the ordinary
about him. I'd kind of got used to him by then, and if there was
any difference I didn't notice it. He never said a word all the way
out until we hit the summit of the Devil's Slide and started down.
I had the firebox door open, and was throwing coal when he says so
sudden as almost to make me drop my shovel:</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Jimmy, do you know what night this is?'"</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Sure,' says I, never thinking, 'it's Thursday.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;He laughed kind of softlike to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'It's my wedding night, Jimmy,' he says. 'My wedding
night, and we're going to celebrate.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;The light from the fire box was full on his face, and he
had the queerest look you ever saw on a man. He was white, and his
eyes were staring, and he was pushing his hand through his hair and
rocking in his seat. I was scart. I thought for a minute he was
going to faint; then I remembered that whisky, and jumped for my
side of the cab, opened the seat, and snatched it up. I went back
to him with it in my hand. I don't think he ever saw it; I know he
didn't. He was laughing that soft laugh again, kind of as though he
was crooning, and he reached out his hand and pushed me away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'We're going to celebrate, Jimmy,' says he again. 'We're
going to celebrate. It's my wedding night.'</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt the speed quicken a bit; we were on the Slide
then, you know, and I saw his fingers tightening on the throttle.
Then it got me, and my heart went into my mouth; Chick was clean
off his head. I slipped the flask into my pocket, and tried to coax
his hands away from the throttle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;'Let me take her a spell, Chick,' says I, thinking my
best chance was to humor him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He threw me off like I was a plaything. Then I tried to
pull him away, and he smashed me one between the eyes and sent me
to the floor. All the time we was going faster and faster. I
tackled him again, but I might as well have been a baby, and
then&mdash;then &mdash;well, that wound in his head came from a
long-handled union wrench I grabbed out of the tool box. He went
down like a felled ox&mdash;but it was too late. Before I could
reach a lever we were in splinters."</p>

<p>Dahleen stopped. Carleton never stirred; he was leaning forward,
his elbows on his desk, his chin in his hands, his face strained,
eyes intently fastened on the other.</p>

<p>Dahleen fumbled a second with his watch chain, twisting it
around his fingers; then he went on: &ldquo;While I laid in the
hospital I turned the thing over in my mind pretty often, long
before the doctors thought I knew my own name again, and I figured
that, if it was ever known, old Coogan was down and out for fair,
even if when he got better his head turned out all right again,
because he wouldn't be ever trusted in a cab in any circumstances,
you understand? If he didn't come out straight, why that ended it,
of course; but I had it in my mind that it was only what they call
a temporary aberration. I couldn't queer him if that was all, could
I? So I said to myself, 'Jimmy, all you know is that the
&ldquo;air" wouldn't work.' That's what I told you that day, and
then you sprang that flask on me. You were right; I <i>had</i>
forgotten it. Whisky in the cab on the night of an accident is
pretty near an open-and-shut game. It was him or me, and I couldn't
tell you the story then without doing Coogan cold, but Coogan's
gone now and it can't hurt him. That's all."</p>

<p>The tick of the clock on the wall, the click of the sounder from
the dispatcher's room next door were the only sounds for a long
moment; then Carleton's chair scraped, and he stood up and put out
his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dahleen," he said huskily, &ldquo;I'd give a good deal to
be as white a man as you are."</p>

<p>Dahleen shook his head. &ldquo;Any one would have done it for
Coogan," he said.</p>
