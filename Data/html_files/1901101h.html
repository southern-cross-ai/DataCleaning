On The Spot</b>
</h2>

<p>THIS happened at a period in the history of the Hill Division
when trade was very bad, and the directors, scowling over the
company's annual report, threw up their hands in holy horror; while
from the sacred precincts of the boardroom there emanated the
agonized cry: "Economy!"</p>

<p>The general manager took up the slogan and dinned it into the
ears of the division superintendents. "Operating expenses are too
high," he wrote. "They must be cut down." And the superintendents
of divisions, painfully alive to the fact that the G. M. was not
dictating for the mere pleasure of it, intimated in unmistakable
language to the heads of departments under them that the next
quarterly reports were expected to show a marked improvement.</p>

<p>John Healy had charge of the roundhouse at Big Cloud in those
days, and the morning after the lightning struck the system he came
fuming back across the yards from his interview with the
superintendent, stuttering angrily to himself. As he stamped into
the running shed, his humor a shade worse than usual, the first
object that caught his eye was Speckles, squatted on the lee side
of No. 483, dangling his legs in the pit. That is, it would have
been the lee side if Healy had come in the other door.</p>

<p>"Cut down operatin' expinses, is ut?" Healy muttered. "Begorra,
I'll begin right now!"</p>

<p>And he "fired" Speckles on the spot.</p>

<p>Now Speckles&mdash;whose name, by the way, was Dolivar
Washington Babson&mdash;had been fired on several occasions before,
and if he trembled a little more than was good for his physical
comfort it was rather as a result of startled surprise at Healy's
appearance than because of any poignant regret at the misfortune
that had overtaken him. Nevertheless, he felt it incumbent on
himself to expostulate.</p>

<p>"Git out an' stay out!" said Healy, refusing to argue.</p>

<p>And Speckles got out.</p>

<p>For a day he kept away from the roundhouse, the length of time
past experience had taught him was required to cool the turner's
anger; then he sauntered down again and came face to face with
Healy on the turntable.</p>

<p>"I came down to ask you to put me on again, Mr. Healy," he
began, broaching the subject timidly.</p>

<p>"Phwat?" demanded Healy.</p>

<p>"I came down to ask you to put me on again, Mr. Healy," Speckles
repeated monotonously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I heard you&mdash;I heard you," said Healy, a little
inconsistently. "On ag'in, is ut? Ut'll be a long toime, me son,
mark that!"</p>

<p>This being quite different from Healy's accustomed "Well git
back to yer job," it began to filter vaguely through Speckles'
brain that his name was no longer to adorn the company's pay
sheets.</p>

<p>"Am I fired for good, Mr. Healy?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"You are!" said Healy. "Just that!" Then, relenting a little as
Speckles' face fell, he went on: "If 'twere not fer the big bugs
down yonder"&mdash;he jerked his thumb in the general direction of
the East&mdash;"I might&mdash;moind, I don't say I would, but I
might&mdash;put you on ag'in. As ut is, we've instructions to cut
down the operatin' expinses, an' there's an ind on ut!"</p>

<p>Speckles stood for a moment in dismay as Healy went back into
the roundhouse; then he turned disconsolately away, crossed the
tracks to the platform of the station, and, seeking out a secluded
corner of the freight house, sat down upon a packing case to think
it out.</p>

<p>To Speckles it was no mere matter of cutting down expenses. It
was a blasted career!</p>

<p>Whatever Speckles' faults, and he was only a lad, he had one
redeeming quality, before which, in the eyes of the business he had
elected to follow, his strayings from the straight and narrow path
dwindled into insignificance&mdash;rail-roading was born in
him.</p>

<p>At ten he had started in as caller for the night crews, and,
during the five years the company had the benefit of his valuable
services in that capacity, there was not a man on the division but
sooner or later came to know long-armed, bony, freckle-faced,
red-haired Speckles&mdash;came to know the little rascal, and like
him, too.</p>

<p>Then Speckles had been promoted to the post of sweeper in the
roundhouse, and occasionally, under Healy's critical inspection, to
washing out boiler tubes. Fresh fuel thereby added to the fire of
his ambition, he began to figure how long it would be before he got
to wiping, then to firing, and after that&mdash;even Speckles'
boundless optimism did not have the temerity to specify any
particular date&mdash;the time when he would attain his goal and
get his engine.</p>

<p>Now, instead, at the age of sixteen, he found himself seated on
a cracker box, his dreams for the future rudely
shattered&mdash;thanks to Healy, old Sour Face Healy!</p>

<p>So Speckles sighed, and as he sighed the shop whistle blew. It
was noon, and the men began to pour out of the big gates. Then
Speckles, remembering that the schools were also "letting out,"
hurried down the platform and up the main street. He would confide
in Madge. She would understand.</p>

<p>Madge Bolton was the daughter of the ticket agent at the
station, and between Mr. Bolton and Speckles there existed a
standing feud, the casus belli being fifteen-year-old, blue-eyed
Madge. Speckles kicked his heels on the corner until she appeared;
then he turned and fell into step beside her, reaching a little
awkwardly for her strap of books.</p>

<p>"Hello, Dol!" was Madge's greeting. She was the only person in
Big Cloud who did not call him Speckles.</p>

<p>"Hello, Madge!" he returned.</p>

<p>Madge glanced at his face and hands. "Haven't you been to work?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>"Why, Dol?"</p>

<p>"Fired," said Speckles laconically.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dol, again!" she cried reproachfully. "What for?"</p>

<p>"'Tain't only the third time, and 'twasn't for nothin'," said
Speckles, a bit sullenly. "I was only restin'."</p>

<p>"Dolivar Babson," she accused, "you were loafing. Oh, Dol,
you'll never get to firing, and&mdash; and&mdash;" She hesitated
and stopped, her cheeks a little red with the hint of boy-and-girl
castle building that would have increased her father's ire against
the luckless Speckles had he seen it.</p>

<p>Speckles, somewhat shamefaced, and having no excuse to offer,
trudged on in silence.</p>

<p>"Did you ask Mr. Healy to take you back?" she inquired, after a
moment.</p>

<p>"He won't," said Speckles.</p>

<p>'What are you going to do, Dol?"</p>

<p>"I dunno."</p>

<p>"Well," said Madge hopefully, "perhaps you could get a job in
one of the stores. I'll ask Mr. Timmons, the grocer, if you like. I
know him pretty well."</p>

<p>Speckles came to an abrupt and sudden halt, cast in Madge's face
one look that carried with it a world of unutterable reproach,
handed over her books in silence&mdash;and fled.</p>

<p>He, a railroad man, go into a <i>store!</i> And this from Madge!
Madge, who, of all others&mdash;it was too much! Speckles ate his
dinner, dispirited and crushed. Everything and everybody was
against him.</p>

<p>His mother's curt inquiry as to when he was going back to work
did not in any way tend to mitigate his troubles&mdash;rather to
accentuate them.</p>

<p>"Old Sour Face won't put me back," he muttered angrily, in
response to his mother's repeated question.</p>

<p>"No wonder he won't," said his mother sharply, "if you're as
disrespectful as that. I'm ashamed of you, and you ought to be
ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>Speckles was too much depressed to offer any defense. He
finished his meal in silence, gulped down his cup of tea in two
swallows, took his hat, and started out.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2" id="Chapter2"></a>Chapter
2<br>
"Look Here, Speckles"</b>
</h2>

<p>UNCONSCIOUSLY he directed his steps toward the yards, and some
five minutes later arrived at the station. Here, about halfway down
the platform, he spotted Mat Bolton in the open doorway of the
ticket office.</p>

<p>As he approached the nonchalant air with which the other leaned
with folded arms against the jamb of the door aroused Speckles'
suspicions. To reach the seat of his meditations&mdash;the cracker
box in the freight shed which had now become his objective
point&mdash;he would be obliged to pass Mr. Bolton. He therefore
began to incline his course toward the edge of the platform nearest
the rails, so that, when he came opposite the office door, some
fifteen feet were between him and his arch enemy.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolton awoke from his lethargy with surprising suddenness.
"You young rascal," he shouted, "what you been doing to my girl?
I'll teach you to make girls cry, you little speckled-face runt,
you!"</p>

<p>He made a dash for Speckles, but by the time he had recovered
his balance and saved himself from toppling over the edge of the
platform to the tracks, Speckles had reached the safe retreat of
the freight-shed door. And as the irate parent, after shaking his
fist impotently, walked back and disappeared within his domain,
Speckles indulged in a series of pantomimes in which his fingers
and his nose played an intimate and comprehensive part.</p>

<p>Perched once more on the cracker box, Speckles again resolved
himself into a committee on ways and means. His little skirmish
with Madge's father had exhilarated him to such an extent that his
heavy and oppressing sense of despondency had vanished, and in its
place came a renewed determination to resume, somehow or other, the
railroad career that Healy had so emphatically interrupted.</p>

<p>He turned over in his mind the feasibility of applying to Regan,
the master mechanic, for a job in the shops, but dismissed the idea
almost immediately on the ground that shopmen were not, strictly
speaking, railroaders.</p>

<p>He might start in switching and braking, and work up to
conductor. That, at least, was railroading&mdash;not to be compared
with engine driving, not by long odds, but still it was
railroading. His face brightened. He would interview Farley, the
train master.</p>

<p>Farley was in his office. Speckles had not very far to go, only
a few steps down the platform. All the offices&mdash;and Big Cloud
was division headquarters&mdash;were under the same roof.</p>

<p>At Speckles' request, Farley swung around in his swivel-chair
with a quizzical expression on his face. Then he grinned.</p>

<p>"Want to go on with the train crews, eh? What do you think, kid,
that I'm running a kindergarten outfit, even if some of 'em do act
like it? How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen," said Speckles with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>"Sixteen, eh? Well, come back in a couple of years,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>But, for the second time that day, Speckles fled. He was in no
mood to stand much chaffing, and Farley, as he well knew, had a
leaning that way. Speckles halted outside the door, undecided what
move to make next, when the clicking of the instruments in the
dispatcher's room overhead came to his ears like an
inspiration.</p>

<p>Why hadn't he thought of that before? Spence, who had been on
the night trick most of the years that Speckles was caller, was now
chief dispatcher. If he had any friend anywhere, it was Spence, the
man at whose elbow he had sat through those long, dark hours of the
night that beget confidences, and into whose ears he had so often
poured the tales of his cherished aims and ambitions.</p>

<p>Speckles covered the stairs three steps at a time, in his
new-found exuberance. Spence looked up from his key and listened as
Speckles told his story.</p>

<p>"So you're Healy's contribution to economy, eh?" he said when
Speckles had finished. "And he won't take you back?"</p>

<p>"No," said Speckles.</p>

<p>'Well, that's pretty rough. But I don't see how I can help you
any, Speckles. I haven't any rights over Healy, you know."</p>

<p>Speckles hesitated a moment and fidgeted nervously from one foot
to the other. "I know you ain't," he began, "but I thought you'd
put me on here."</p>

<p>'W-what!" ejaculated Spence. Then, smothering a laugh at the
sight of Speckles' woebegone countenance, he demanded gravely: "You
mean dispatching?"</p>

<p>Speckles nodded.</p>

<p>"No, no, Speckles, that would never do. You go back and see
Healy. I'll do what I can for you with him."</p>

<p>"'Twon't do no good," said Speckles hopelessly. "I've asked him
twice already."</p>

<p>'Well, ask him again. Look here, Speckles, it's up to you to
square yourself with Healy, somehow or other. If you want your job
very badly, you ought to be sharp enough to find a way of getting
it. Go on, now."</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3" id="Chapter3"></a>Chapter
3<br>
That Handy Broom</b>
</h2>

<p>SO Speckles descended the stairs to the platform and
irresolutely began to cross the tracks in the direction of the
running shed. He reached the roundhouse and skirmished cautiously
along its front. No Healy was in sight, so he dived in between two
engines and made his way to the rear of the shed. Here, by peering
around the end of a tender, he could see Healy's cubby-hole&mdash;
Healy called it an office&mdash;a bit of space about four by six
partitioned off from the back wall in the corner, with a greasy
book the engine crews signed, and two or three others, equally
greasy, in which Healy kept tabs on things in general.</p>

<p>In spite of his trepidation, Speckles grinned. Healy was there,
bending over a very flimsy, spindle-legged table that he had
wheedled out of the claim agent some months before. His brows were
puckered into a ferocious scowl, and he growled and muttered to
himself, now laboring furiously with a stubby pencil on the sheets
of paper in front of him, now pausing to bite that unoffending
article almost in two in his desperation.</p>

<p>Healy was working on his invention. All the division knew about
Healy's ideas on Westinghouse and "air," and that these ideas, when
perfected, were to be patented. As to what the consensus of opinion
of their value was is neither here nor there, except that in
Healy's presence, when referred to at all, the subject was treated
with dignity and respect, for Healy's physical powers were beyond
the ordinary, and dearest to Healy's heart and most sacred in his
eyes was this creation of his brain, or, to be more accurate,
fancy.</p>

<p>Speckles sidled up to the cubby-hole, and, without any
peroration, took the plunge. "I came to ask you to put me on again,
Mr. Healy,"&mdash;he spoke rapidly, as though he feared his courage
might ooze out before he could finish.</p>

<p>Healy wheeled round with a grunt. "Oh, ut's you, is ut?" he
asked grimly.</p>

<p>Speckles, ready to run at the first sign of violence,
acknowledged the impeachment by nodding his head affirmatively, and
smiled sheepishly while Healy scrutinized him with a long stare
from head to foot.</p>

<p>'Well," said Healy, "you wait a minute an' I'll give you me
answer."</p>

<p>Speckles' heart bounded in joyous hope. Healy very deliberately
gathered up his papers, folded them carefully, and opening the
cupboard where his coat hung&mdash;it was a hot day, and Healy was
in his shirt sleeves&mdash;tucked them into the inside pocket.
Then, like a flash, he turned and reached for the first thing in
sight. It was a broom.</p>

<p>But, quick as he was, Speckles was quicker, and he led Healy by
the length of the pit as he dodged around the tail end of a tender
and darted out of the running shed across the tracks to the freight
house.</p>

<p>Healy followed no farther than the turntable. There he halted,
and Speckles, from his retreat, saw him shake his fist and listened
to the threat that thundered across the yards: "Show yer face
around here ag'in, you young rascal, an' I'll bate the loife out av
you, so I will!"</p>

<p>Speckles betook himself to the cracker box, and from his lips
there flowed a fluent and unrestrained expression of his opinion on
things in general, but more particularly of Healy, and more
particularly still of Healy's invention. Then, his indignation
subsiding, it was followed by a fit of the blues; so that when, at
the expiration of half an hour, Healy, still in his shirt sleeves,
came out of the roundhouse and walked up the tracks in the
direction of the shops, Speckles, through the freight-house door,
remarked the incident in complete apathy and as one in which he had
no interest.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4" id="Chapter4"></a>Chapter
4<br>
The Yawning Doors</b>
</h2>

<p>TEN minutes later, however, Speckles apathy vanished and he
sprang to his feet at the sound of the excited shouts of the men in
the running shed. Some were hastily swinging the big engine doors
wide open, others were setting the table in position, while one
started on a run in the direction Healy had taken.</p>

<p>Another minute and the shop whistle had boomed out its warning,
and as Healy, with the man who had gone after him, came tearing
down the track like mad, Speckles saw the smoke beginning to curl
up over the roof at the back. The running shed was afire.</p>

<p>With a whoop, Speckles traversed the platform, leaped to the
rails, and was hard on Healy's heels by the time the turntable was
crossed. The thing to do was to get the engines out, and Healy was
the man to do it.</p>

<p>"Get tackle rigged on 463," he ordered. "She's cold, an' we'll
have to haul her out. Set the table fer 518; I'll take her."</p>

<p>Then he started on the jump for the cubby-hole and his precious
papers.</p>

<p>Now, the tackle that Healy had referred to was stored in the
rear of the roundhouse in the same general direction as the
cubby-hole, and as the order had been given to no one in
particular, Speckles, shouting "I'll get it," started after
Healy.</p>

<p>Some grease and waste had caught and was rolling up a nasty
smoke. Through it, even while he tugged manfully at the heavy
tackle, Speckles saw Healy run into his office, snatch his coat,
rush out again, and dash for the cab of 518, throwing the coat up
on the tender. As he did so, something fell from the pocket.</p>

<p>Speckles dropped the tackle and pounced upon it. It was the
bundle of papers he had seen Healy put in his coat pocket a little
while before. It was Healy's invention!</p>

<p>Speckles' first impulse was to shout to Healy, but just then No.
518 glided out of the shed, and the men in front of 463 were
yelling in chorus for the tackle, so Speckles put his tongue in his
cheek and the papers in his pocket.</p>

<p>It wasn't much of a blaze, but it looked bad while it lasted.
Even after the shop hands had got their hose lengths connected and
a stream playing on the fire, and the engines were all in safety in
the yard, the smoke continued to roll out in clouds, with here and
there a vicious tongue of flame.</p>

<p>Then Healy, his duty done, bethought him of his coat on the
tender of No. 518. And Speckles, as he heard Healy's gasp of dismay
on discovering that his papers were gone, had an inspiration.</p>

<p>"Me papers! Me papers!" wailed Healy. "Fer the love av Mike, I
must av dropped them on the flure!"</p>

<p>"I'll get them for you, Mr. Healy," said Speckles, quick as a
shot.</p>

<p>"You'll not!" said Healy. "I'll have no wan risk his life fer
thim, bad as I want thim. Hey, come back, you runt!"</p>

<p>But Speckles was gone. Headed straight for the big, yawning
doors that vomited their smoke and flames? Oh, no, not Speckles!
Hardly! Speckles would make his attempt from the rear! And around
the end of the shed and in behind he raced.</p>

<p>Some of the men were fighting the fire from that side, but they
were too busy to pay any attention to Speckles. A dab of soot and
dirt on his face which he obtained by rubbing his fingers along the
blackened wall, an artistic smudge of generous proportions on the
outside of the papers, which he took from his pocket, and Speckles'
make-up was complete and convincing.</p>

<p>Now, Speckles had an eye for the dramatic and an appreciation of
its value. He peered in through one of the windows. It was not
nearly as bad inside as it had been, and he decided there would be
no risk and very little discomfort in carrying out the plan that
had popped into his head.</p>

<p>So he climbed in through a window and dropped down to the floor
on the other side. The next minute he had dashed through the
running shed, and emerged from a whirl of black smoke into the open
in front of the turntable, the papers waved aloft in his fist.</p>

<p>It was effective&mdash;decidedly effective! A cheer went up, and
the men crowded around, while Healy rushed forward and began to
pump Speckles' arm up and down like an engine piston.</p>

<p>"Ut's a hero you are, me bright jool av a lad!" he cried in his
delight. "'Tis mesilf, John Healy, that ses ut, an' the bhoys are
me witness. Come back to yer job in the mornin' an', by my soul,
Speckles, I'll niver fire you ag'in, niver! An' ut's more I'll
do&mdash;I'll promote you. Ut's a wiper you are from now on, me
