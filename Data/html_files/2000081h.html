  One Hundred Thousand Dollars</b></h2>
  <p>A WILD and prolonged roar came from every quarter of the race track. It
  swelled in volume. It came again and again. Pandemonium itself seemed loosed.</p>
  <p>Outside the enclosure, a squat, fat man, the perspiration rolling in streams
  down his face, tugged at his collar with frantic, nervous jerks, as he leaned
  in over the side of a high-powered car, and with his other hand gripped at
  the arm of the young man in the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave, listen to &rsquo;em! My God, listen to &rsquo;em!&rdquo; snarled
  the fat man.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson, with the toe of his boot, moved the little black satchel
  that the other had dropped on the floor of the car farther to one side; and,
  by way of excuse for disengaging his arm, reached into his pocket for his
  cigarettes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can hear &rsquo;em&mdash;even a yard away out here!&rdquo; he said
  imperturbably. &ldquo;Sounds like a great day for the bookies&mdash;not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The fat man secured his grip on Dave Henderson&rsquo;s arm again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wiped out&mdash;every last cent&mdash;all I&rsquo;ve made
  in years,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;You get that, don&rsquo;t you?
  You know it! I&rsquo;m cleaned out&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t seem to give
  a damn!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; inquired Dave Henderson calmly. &ldquo;I guess
  it&rsquo;s <i>their</i> turn, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s red-rimmed little gray eyes narrowed, and he swallowed
  hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve played square, I have!&rdquo; he whined. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m
  wiped out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;square as hell!&rdquo; amended Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t give a damn!&rdquo; shrilled Bookie Skarvan. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  like you! That&rsquo;s like the lot of you! Where would you have been if
  I hadn&rsquo;t taken you up&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson dispassionately. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  not blaming you for trying to make a crook of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An apoplectic red heightened Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s flushed and streaming
  face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s one thing I didn&rsquo;t make a bull of, at any
  rate!&rdquo; he retorted viciously.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson shifted his cigarette from one corner of his mouth to the
  other with the tip of his tongue. There was a curious smile, half bitter,
  half whimsical, on his lips, as he leaned suddenly toward the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right, Bookie!&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;But
  I&rsquo;ve only just found it out myself, so if you think there&rsquo;s any
  congrats coming to you and you&rsquo;re sore because you didn&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em
  before, you know why now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The scowl on Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s face deepened, then cleared abruptly,
  and the man forced a nervous, wheezy chuckle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t feel so blamed cool about it to-morrow morning when
  you come to size this up!&rdquo; He was whining again, but plaintively now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  wiped out, I tell you, and it&rsquo;s too hard a crack for Tydeman to give
  me any more backing after he&rsquo;s squared this up&mdash;so what are you
  going to do, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson glanced at the car&rsquo;s clock. It was already after three.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up to &rsquo;Frisco&mdash;if I ever get started!&rdquo; he
  said brusquely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed the train, as it is, and that means
  a ninety-mile run&mdash;and we&rsquo;re still wasting time! Get down to cases!
  You got Tydeman on the long distance&mdash;what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help your missing the train!&rdquo; Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s
  voice had grown almost ingratiating. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any use of
  you going until I knew Tydeman was at home, and unless I got hold of him
  before the banks closed, was there? And if I&rsquo;d been able to get him
  at once we might have had time to arrange it by wire with a bank here&mdash;if
  they were carrying that much in ready cash&mdash;and you wouldn&rsquo;t have
  needed to go at all. But I didn&rsquo;t get him until just a few minutes
  ago. You know that! I couldn&rsquo;t help it, could I&mdash;and the run won&rsquo;t
  hurt you. You can grab the evening train back. I can stave this gang of wolves
  off until then by telling &rsquo;em Tydeman&rsquo;s making good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Dave Henderson was apparently much more intent
  upon the starting mechanism of the car, than he was upon either his companion
  or his companion&rsquo;s words. The engine was already purring softly when
  he looked up at Bookie Skarvan again. &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the arrangement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tydeman will have the money in cash at his house&mdash;one hundred
  thousand dollars. You go there and get it, and bring it back on the train
  to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; Bookie Skarvan mopped at his face with
  the back of his sleeve, glanced in the direction of another sudden outburst
  of delirious cheering, and mopped at his face again. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll
  be another long shot&mdash;everybody&rsquo;s playing &rsquo;em&mdash;damn &rsquo;em!
  For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t miss that train back, Dave! It leaves at
  nine o&rsquo;clock. Some of these pikers that never turned a red in their
  lives before &rsquo;ll be laying me out if I don&rsquo;t flash the long green
  then. You get me, Dave? I&rsquo;ll have all I can do to stave &rsquo;em off
  that long. I wish I could go with you and get out of here, but they&rsquo;d
  think I was running away, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I get you!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson. &ldquo;They all love Bookie
  Skarvan! Well, it&rsquo;s your car, and you&rsquo;ve got a right there, but
  get off the step unless you&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo; He threw in the clutch,
  and the car shot forward. &ldquo;So long, Bookie!&rdquo; he flung out over
  his shoulder.</p>
  <p>An hour passed. Out in the free sweep of country, the car was running at
  terrific speed. And now, from the road ahead, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s dark
  eyes, cool and self-reliant, strayed to the little black handbag at his feet
  as they had done many times before, while the tight lips parted slightly
  in a smile; and suddenly, over the rush of the wind and the roar of the speeding
  car, he spoke aloud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One hundred thousand dollars&mdash;<i>in cash</i>,&rdquo; said Dave
  Henderson meditatively. &ldquo;Well, it looks like the chance I&rsquo;ve
  been waiting for&mdash;what? Only I can&rsquo;t go and let old Tydeman hand
  it over to me and trust me with it, and then beat it and give him the doublecross,
  can I? Once he shoves it at me, and says, &lsquo;Dave, my boy, take this
  back to Skarvan,&rsquo; I&rsquo;m stung, and there&rsquo;s nothing doing!
  That&rsquo;s right, ain&rsquo;t it? Well then, what&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The broad, muscular shoulders set a little more rigidly over the steering
  wheel, and the square jaws clamped in a sort of dogged defiance in the face
  of his self-propounded problem. His mind, as though seeking therefrom the
  solution he demanded, was reviewing the facts and circumstances that had
  placed that little black hand-bag, with its suggestive possibilities, at
  his feet. It had been a bad day for the bookmakers, and a particularly bad
  day for Bookie Skarvan&mdash;for it was the culmination of several extremely
  bad days for Bookie Skarvan. Shots at odds that were staggering had won again
  and again. There was absolutely no question but that the man was wiped out&mdash;a
  good many times over. True, Tydeman was coming to the rescue, but that did
  not put Bookie Skarvan on his feet again; it only paid the bills, and saved
  Bookie Skarvan from being used as a street cleaning device in the shape of
  a human mop! The curious thing about it was that Tydeman was in any way connected
  with Bookie Skarvan! Everybody knew that Skarvan was crooked from his boot
  soles up&mdash;except Martin K. Tydeman. But that was Tydeman&rsquo;s way!
  Tydeman must have been told often enough, but Tydeman wouldn&rsquo;t believe
  it. That was Tydeman&rsquo;s way! Once, years ago, Skarvan had tipped Tydeman
  off that one of his string was being &ldquo;doctored.&rdquo; It did not matter
  that Skarvan had juggled his information, and had tried first to play both
  ends to the middle by blackmailing and then doublecrossing the man who had
  done the &ldquo;doctoring&rdquo;&mdash;Tydeman did not know that&mdash;and
  Tydeman from that moment was unshaken in his belief that there was no squarer
  man on the circuit than Bookie Skarvan. It had resulted in Tydeman becoming
  a silent partner of Bookie Skarvan&mdash;and the betting fraternity had been
  not a little pleased, for Tydeman&rsquo;s millions went up on the board better
  than even against Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s trickiness.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson nodded his head. It was quite true. Martin K. Tydeman was
  getting to be quite an old man now, but Martin K. Tydeman was still hailed
  as the squarest, garnest sporting gentleman California had ever known&mdash;and
  it would be a little rough on that king of sports. It was too bad that it
  wasn&rsquo;t Bookie Skarvan! Skarvan was crooked from the ground up&mdash;and
  who knew it any better than he, Dave Henderson, who had worked for Skarvan
  for several years now? But, as it was, Tydeman would simply have to cough
  up a second hundred thousand out of his millions, that was all. No, it wasn&rsquo;t
  all! It depended entirely upon whether he, Dave Henderson, could get his
  hands on the money without accepting it as a trust from the old millionaire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a poor fool!&rdquo; Dave Henderson informed himself,
  with a sharp laugh. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference? You pinch it either
  way, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shook his head, as the car tore forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mabbe,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;mabbe I am, and mabbe there ain&rsquo;t
  any difference&mdash;but there&rsquo;s nothing doing that way. I got a little
  reputation myself&mdash;left. No guy ever put a bean in my mitt that he didn&rsquo;t
  get a square deal on, and that&rsquo;s on the level&mdash;in spite of Skarvan!
  Damn Skarvan! He wouldn&rsquo;t have had a look-in on a two-bit bet for more
  seasons than one if I hadn&rsquo;t been running the cases for him&mdash;nobody&rsquo;d
  have trusted him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again Dave Henderson relapsed into silence. He drove in a purely mechanical
  way. His mind was rankling now in a sort of bitter speculation over the years
  that reached back as far as he could remember. They were not an altogether
  pleasing memory; and that was why he wanted, and not only wanted, but had
  made up his mind to have&mdash;one hundred thousand dollars. He did not remember
  either his father or his mother. They hadn&rsquo;t had any money, but he
  had an impression that they had been rather decent people&mdash;only they
  had died. He had been a kid when it happened&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t know how
  old&mdash;just a kid. Some one had put him in a school, an orphan school.
  It had been a hell of a place. And at ten he had run away. After that, beginning
  by making himself useful around one of the training stables, he had lived
  on the race courses ever since&mdash;and had risen to the heights of becoming
  Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s clerk!</p>
  <p>His jaws clamped hard. It was a piker life, but here was a chance to get
  out of it! He had been looking for the chance&mdash;and here it was&mdash;if
  he could get away with it. There had been lots of chances before, chances
  for a few thousand dollars&mdash;but the bet hadn&rsquo;t been good enough.
  He had even a little better than three thousand dollars himself, for that
  matter, and it was pulling interest, too; he had loaned it to Square John
  Kelly, who ran the Pacific Coral Saloon down on the Barbary Coast in &rsquo;Frisco.
  And he had a couple of hundred dollars in his pocket now, too, for that matter.
  But it was all chicken feed. He had won it, and he might win as much more
  again some time&mdash;or he might lose it. The game wasn&rsquo;t any good.
  It didn&rsquo;t get anywhere. Maybe it was the interest coming in on that
  three thousand that showed up where the odds stood on a hundred thousand.
  There wasn&rsquo;t anything else involved. Was it a good gamble? The interest
  on a hundred thousand would make a blooming gentleman of independent means
  out of him at one crack. Sure, it was worth the risk! If he got caught, well
  then&mdash;<i>good-night!</i> If he got away with it, well then&mdash;<i>zowie!</i></p>
  <p>Yes&mdash;but how? That was the question.</p>
  <p>If he wouldn&rsquo;t go to Tydeman and let Tydeman trustfully hand the money
  over to him, how was he to get the cash into his possession? He was quite
  willing to accept the risk of pursuit and capture, given a few hours&rsquo; start,
  he was quite willing to pit his wits against the machinery of the law, that
  was the gambling chance he ran; and it would be very simple to let Tydeman,
  in Tydeman&rsquo;s own library, say, assist in packing the little black hand-bag
  full of money, and then, instead of taking the train back to Stockton&mdash;to
  disappear. The strong jaws clamped harder. But&mdash;. nothing doing! Not
  that way! He&rsquo;d go the limit, and he meant to have that hundred thousand,
  and he would have it, and, once decided upon getting it, he would drop in
  his tracks before he would give up the attempt, and he would drop in his
  tracks, if the attempt were successful, before he relinquished his grip on
  the money&mdash;but that way was <i>raw</i>. Rotten raw! To get away with
  a hundred thousand dollars was a sporting proposition, a gambling and a fighting
  chance, but to double-cross a man who placed that money in one&rsquo;s keeping
  in good faith was in Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s line&mdash;not his!</p>
  <p>Well then&mdash;how?</p>
  <p>The miles and the minutes and the half-hours passed. Tight-lipped, the clean-shaven
  face set and hard, the dark eyes introspective as they held on the road ahead,
  Dave Henderson sat there, almost motionless, bent over the wheel. Once he
  stopped to replenish his supply of gasoline, and then the car roared on again,
  rocking in its speed. He drove perilously fast, in a sort of subconscious
  physical synchronism with his racing brain. One hundred thousand dollars&mdash;that
  was the stake. In another hour or so that hundred thousand dollars would
  be his&mdash;some way! There was no question about that! But how? There was
  something ironical in the fact that Tydeman was waiting to throw it at him,
  and that while he racked his mind for a method of getting the money into
  his possession, he must also rack his mind for a method that would prevent
  it being forced upon him! He laughed out sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now wouldn&rsquo;t that sting you!&rdquo; mumbled Dave Henderson. &ldquo;Say,
  wouldn&rsquo;t that sting you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then, abruptly, Dave Henderson stopped the car at the side of the road.
  He had it now&mdash;almost. It had come, the germ of it, in a flash. And
  now he wanted to think it out without the distraction of handling the machine.
  There came a smile, and the smile broadened&mdash;and he laughed again. There
  was a picture before his mind&rsquo;s-eye now that afforded him a grim sense
  of humor. He could see the great bare dormitory in the orphan school, a room
  whose walls were decorated with huge scrolled mottoes&mdash;and there was
  the one on the end wall with its great red painted letters, and the same
  old crack in the plaster that zigzagged its way through the words. Sure,
  he could see it! &ldquo;Virtue Is Its Own Reward.&rdquo; He had never taken
  much stock in mottoes, but it looked now as though that one wasn&rsquo;t
  all to the bad! By refusing to allow himself to double-cross old Tydeman,
  he had now found a very much better way. He wouldn&rsquo;t have to take the
  risk of pursuit now if he had any luck, for the very simple reason that there
  wouldn&rsquo;t be any pursuit; and instead of it being a self-evident fact
  that he had got away with the money, he would not now appear in the affair
  at all.</p>
  <p>He began to elaborate the germ very carefully in his mind. He knew old Tydeman&rsquo;s
  house well, almost every inch of it, for he had been there on errands for
  Skarvan many times. Tydeman had secured the money from the bank just before
  closing time, and had taken it to his home. Tydeman&rsquo;s habit was to
  dine about half-past six. These three facts woven together offered a most
  satisfactory solution to the problem. One hundred thousand dollars in bills
  of the denominations that Tydeman would be likely to call for in order to
  make it convenient for Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s use, would be too bulky for
  Tydeman to carry around in his pocket. Therefore the money wouldn&rsquo;t
  be on Tydeman&rsquo;s person when the old millionaire sat down to his high-falutin&rsquo; dinner
  with his butler at his elbow at half-past six. The money would be in the
  library most likely&mdash;and the library was accessible&mdash;thanks to
  the hedge that flanked the driveway to the house.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson selected another cigarette from his package, and lighted
  it thoughtfully. So far, so good! And the rest wasn&rsquo;t so dusty either!
  He had the whole thing now. As soon as he reached &rsquo;Frisco he would
  drive down to that shabby little street where he kept the shabby room in
  which he lived during the off seasons on the turf, and leave the car standing
  in front of the house. From his room he could easily gain the shed at the
  rear of the place, and from the shed he could gain the lane&mdash;and all
  this without the slightest chance of being observed. He should be able to
  go to Tydeman&rsquo;s house and return in, say, an hour, or an hour and a
  half at the outside. If any one noticed the car in front it would seem only
  natural that he had gone to his room to wash up and perhaps change his clothes
  after a ninety-mile run, especially in view of the fact that the train he
  was supposed to take back to Stockton did not leave until nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>He leaned back in his seat, and blew a smoke ring into the air complacently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; observed Dave Henderson. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve got
  the odds switched&mdash;to a little better than even money. I&rsquo;ll be
  back with that hundred thousand and no one the wiser, but I&rsquo;ve got
  to hide it somewhere&mdash;what? And I can&rsquo;t make the fool play of
  hiding it in my room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another smoke ring followed the first. Almost any place would do&mdash;so
  that it was easy to get at, and at the same time would not attract attention
  to him when he went back to it. Well&mdash;the shed, then? He nodded his
  head suddenly. Yes, of course&mdash;Mrs. Tooler&rsquo;s old pigeon-cote in
  the shed! It was the one place in a million! The money would be perfectly
  safe there, and he could get it again any time at a minute&rsquo;s notice.
  Again he nodded his head. The whole thing was as good as done now. After
  the money was hidden, he had only to get into the car, drive to Tydeman&rsquo;s
  house, mount the steps with the little black satchel in his hand&mdash;and
  request of Mr. Martin K. Tydeman, Esquire, the money that Bookie Skarvan
  had sent him for, and which he had motored a matter of some ninety miles
  to obtain!</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips parted in a sudden smile, though the outthrust,
  dogged jaw was in no degree relaxed. There would be one whale of a hullabaloo!
  But the last man who could by the wildest stretch of imagination have had
  anything to do with the robbery was&mdash;Dave Henderson!</p>
  <p>After that, maybe he <i>would</i> accept a second hundred thousand from
  Tydeman&mdash;and take it back to Bookie Skarvan, too! That was all he had
  to do&mdash;play the game. In six months it would be soon enough to dig up
  and beat it out of the West for keeps. There wasn&rsquo;t any hurry. Being
  already a man of affairs, it would take him some time to get those affairs
  settled up! There was old Square John Kelly and that three thousand dollars,
  for instance. Kelly couldn&rsquo;t produce the cash at an instant&rsquo;s
  notice, it was invested in Kelly&rsquo;s business; but if he tipped old Kelly
  off that he was thinking of chucking up the West, Kelly would have it for
  him at the end of a few months. There wasn&rsquo;t any hurry.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson glanced at the car&rsquo;s clock&mdash;and flipped the butt
  of his cigarette away. It was ten minutes of five. He started the car forward
  again&mdash;but now he drove leisurely. The plan he had decided upon no longer
  demanded an excess of speed. He was getting in pretty close to &rsquo;Frisco,
  and he did not now want to reach the city until at least a few minutes after
  six.</p>
  <p>There was something superbly insouciant about the man, as, far back in his
  seat, his hands rested in a sort of masterful negligence upon the steering
  wheel. Of ethics Dave Henderson knew little, and cared much less&mdash;ethics
  had been missing from the curriculum of the school in which he had been brought
  up. He wanted a hundred thousand dollars, because with a hundred thousand
  dollars he was fixed for life; and, having weighed the betting odds that
  stood between him and his goal, and having decided to accept those odds,
  it became simply a question of winning, or of being wiped out. If he got
  wiped out, he would neither whimper nor whine&mdash;he would simply swallow
  his medicine. He was taking a sporting chance&mdash;he was staking his liberty,
  quite possibly his life, against Martin K. Tydeman&rsquo;s hundred thousand
  dollars. And Tydeman could afford to lose. He wasn&rsquo;t for putting Tydeman,
  or any one else, on the rocks; that wasn&rsquo;t the sort of game he had
  any use for&mdash;but a hundred thousand to Tydeman was street-car fare.
  He admitted that he would have preferred it should have been some one other
  than Tydeman, in the sense that he possessed an unbounded admiration for
  Tydeman&mdash;for Tydeman, even though he was too old to take much of an
  active part in anything, was still the gamest sport on record. But it <i>was</i> Tydeman,
  it happened that it <i>was</i> Tydeman; and so, well&mdash; Dave Henderson
  shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Step up, gentlemen, and place your bets!&rdquo; murmured Dave Henderson
  softly. &ldquo;And take a tip from me&mdash;bunch your wads on the dark horse!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  The Theft</b> </h2>
  <p>IT was in front of a shabby frame house in a shabby street that Dave Henderson
  stopped the car. It was five minutes after six. He lifted up the seat, and,
  leaning down, surreptitiously conveyed to his pocket a cold-chisel from the
  car&rsquo;s complement of tools. Lacking any of the accessories of a professional
  burglar, the chisel would make a most excellent substitute for a steel jimmy.
  He replaced the seat, picked up the little black hand-bag, alighted, entered
  the house, and from the musty hallway, after unlocking the door, stepped
  through into a room on the right. He closed the door behind him, and stood
  surveying his surroundings in a sort of half grim, half quizzical contempt.</p>
  <p>It was possible that old Tooler upstairs, on hearing the car, and hearing
  him, Dave Henderson, enter the house, might come down; on the other hand,
  it was quite equally possible that old Tooler would not. It was, however,
  wise to wait a few minutes and see. That was part of the plan. He, Dave Henderson,
  was supposed to be here in his room while some one else made that little
  raid on Martin K. Tydeman&rsquo;s library! If, therefore, Tooler should come
  down, and find no one&mdash; A shrug of his shoulders completed the obvious
  deduction.</p>
  <p>His eyes traveled around the room. This was his home&mdash;that is, if he
  could claim a home anywhere, this was his home. It was dingy, comfortless
  and uninviting. There was only the one window that faced the street, and
  the window was inadequate, and the light seemed to be imbued with a niggardly
  hesitation about coming in at all&mdash;which was perhaps just as well. The
  furnishings weren&rsquo;t out of any prize collection!</p>
  <p>He dug his hands impulsively into his side-pockets&mdash;and, one hand encountering
  the chisel, he smiled with a kind of cool, composed satisfaction. Between
  this barren and God-forsaken hole and this bit of steel there had been been
  a connection that was both intimate and pertinent. For nine years, ever since
  he had run away from school, the kind of existence this place stood for had
  got his goat&mdash;that was the reason why he had put the chisel in his pocket.</p>
  <p>The room had served its purpose better than any other place of like circumstances
  and surroundings would have served him&mdash;he had, indeed, chosen this
  particular room very carefully&mdash;but the place had always got his goat.
  He had had to have a room somewhere&mdash;he had taken it here. There were
  many reasons why he had selected this one. It was cheap; and it was among
  the only class of people with whom he had ever had a chance to associate&mdash;the
  hangers-on of the race-tracks, the dance-hall crowd of the Barbary Coast,
  the night world of &rsquo;Frisco. He knew every one here&mdash;he knew the
  crooks and the lags of the underworld. These latter had time and again even
  tried to inveigle him into active membership in their fraternity. They wanted
  him. They had even paid him the compliment of telling him he would make the
  slickest crook in the United States. He had refused. The game didn&rsquo;t
  look good enough. It was all piker stuff. It wasn&rsquo;t morality that had
  held him back... his morality was the morality of his environment... nine
  years of it... what was morality anyhow?... as far as he could make out it
  was simply a question of whatever you do don&rsquo;t get caught. And he had
  seen some of the upper crust playing at morality, too! Sure, he knew what
  morality was&mdash;he had seen a lot of it in his nineteen years!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what do you know about that!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson aloud,
  in a sort of surprised voice. &ldquo;Sounds like I&rsquo;m arguing with myself
  whether I ought to do this or not. Say, wouldn&rsquo;t that sting you! There&rsquo;s
  nothing to it! It&rsquo;s what you get for waiting&mdash;a lone hand that
  cops the sweepstakes, and sets you up for keeps like a nabob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He went to the door, opened it slightly, and listened. Upstairs he could
  hear Tooler moving about. That was another reason why he had, having once
  taken the room, remained on as the sole lodger in this house. Tooler minded
  his own business&mdash;and Mrs. Tooler couldn&rsquo;t help minding hers.
  Mrs. Tooler was a paralytic. They were a couple well beyond middle age, and,
  having been thrifty in their early days, had purchased this house here some
  fifteen years ago. The neighborhood, even if still a cheap neighborhood at
  that time, had been a little more refined in those days. It had changed for
  the worse since then, but having invested their savings the subsequent changes
  had to be borne, that was all. It hadn&rsquo;t apparently affected Tooler
  very much. The man was naturally sour anyhow, and Mrs. Tooler&rsquo;s illness
  hadn&rsquo;t changed him into what might be called, by any stretch of the
  imagination, genial! He was a mechanic of some sort; but his work had been
  spasmodic&mdash;Mrs. Tooler could not always be left alone.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson frowned. Tooler evidently wasn&rsquo;t coming down; but Tooler,
  for all that, must, if the necessity arose, be the means of establishing
  an alibi, and that required something of at least a definite recognition
  by Tooler of his, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s, presence. He stepped abruptly out
  into the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heh, Tooler!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Tooler!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A door opened somewhere above.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; snapped a gruff voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; announced Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard you!&rdquo; grunted Tooler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I just came in for a wash-up,&rdquo; explained Dave Henderson. &ldquo;Came
  up in Skarvan&rsquo;s car. I&rsquo;m going back to-night by train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Tooler grunted again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The only answer was the closing of a door upstairs. Dave Henderson smiled
  pleasantly, and re-entered his own room. When it came to sociability Tooler
  was a star! Well, so much the better! He had no complaint to register on
  that score&mdash;especially to-night! He crossed to where his trunk stood
  against the wall at the lower end of the room, opened the trunk, lifted out
  the tray, and from somewhere in the lower recesses possessed himself of an
  automatic pistol and a generous supply of reserve ammunition. With this in
  his pocket, he closed the trunk again, and, sitting down on the edge of the
  bed, unlaced and removed his shoes.</p>
  <p>And now Dave Henderson, silent as a cat in his movements, his shoes tucked
  under one arm, the black hand-bag under the other, made his way out into
  the hall. The car standing in front of the house was mute evidence that he
  was still in his room. Later on, when he returned, in the course of an hour,
  say, he would call up to Tooler again to say that he was going. It was a
  perfectly good alibi!</p>
  <p>He crept on along the hall, reached the back door, opened it cautiously
  without a sound, and stepped through into the shed that connected with the
  house. Here, he spent several minutes in a careful examination of the old
  pigeon-cote. He had never been very much interested in Mrs. Tooler&rsquo;s
  abandoned pigeon-cote before&mdash;he was very much interested in it now!
  There was a small side window in the shed, and it gave just light enough
  to enable him to see. It was many years since Mrs. Tooler had kept any pigeons,
  or anything else, save the bare threads of her life together; but the old
  pigeon-cote was still here at the end of the shed, just above the door that
  opened on the lane. It wasn&rsquo;t anything very elaborate, just a sort
  of ceiling platform, boarded in, and with a little door in it. Standing on
  the ground he could just reach up to the door, and he opened it tentatively.
  Yes, it would serve excellently. It was instantly accessible at any time,
  either from the house or from the lane, and certainly Mrs. Tooler&rsquo;s
  long-forgotten shelter for her bygone pets was not a thing to excite suspicion&mdash;especially
  in view of the fact that there never would be any suspicion excited on any
  score as far as he was concerned!</p>
  <p>He put on his shoes again, and, opening the shed door at the rear, stepped
  out into the lane&mdash;and a moment later was walking quickly along a side
  street away from the house.</p>
  <p>Martin K. Tydeman&rsquo;s house was on the Hill. Dave Henderson smiled a
  little grimly at the airy lightness of the empty black bag in his hand. It
  would be neither as light nor as empty on the way back&mdash;if he had any
  luck! He pulled the slouch hat he was wearing a little farther down over
  his eyes. A man carrying a bag wasn&rsquo;t anything out of the ordinary,
  or anything to attract particular attention&mdash;he was much more concerned
  in avoiding the chance of personal recognition. And, anyway, the bag was
  a necessity. If the money, for instance, was in customary banded sheaves
  of banknotes, and loose, how else could he carry it? Not in his pockets&mdash;and
  he couldn&rsquo;t very well make a parcel of them in Tydeman&rsquo;s library!
  Of course, the bank might have made up a sealed package of the whole, but
  even then a sealed package would have to be kept out of sight.</p>
  <p>The slouch hat was drawn down still a little lower, and by the less frequented
  streets Dave Henderson made his way along. At the expiration of some twenty
  minutes he had emerged, a block away, on the street upon which the millionaire&rsquo;s
  home fronted. The hurried pace was gone now, and he dropped into a leisurely
  and nonchalant saunter. It was a very select neighborhood. There was little
  or no traffic, and the majority of the houses possessed, to a greater or
  less extent, their own grounds. Tydeman&rsquo;s house, for example, was approached
  by a short driveway that was flanked on both sides by a high and thick hedge.
  Dave Henderson nodded his head complacently. He had pictured that driveway
  a dozen times on the run up from Stockton, and particularly he had pictured
  that hedge! It was a most convenient hedge! And it was exceedingly thoughtful
  of Martin K. Tydeman, Esquire, to have provided it! If one crouched low enough
  there was nothing, unless some one were especially on the watch, to prevent
  one reaching the library windows at the side-rear of the house, and of accomplishing
  this without the slightest chance of being seen.</p>
  <p>He was close to the driveway entrance now, and his eyes swept narrowly up
  and down the street. For the moment there appeared to be no one in sight&mdash;and,
  with a quick side-step, he slipped suddenly in from the street under the
  shelter of the hedge.</p>
  <p>He moved swiftly now, running, half bent over. It was a matter of but a
  few seconds&mdash;and now, darting across the driveway where it branched
  off to circle around to the front entrance, he gained the side wall of the
  house, and crouched, listening intently, beneath the window of the library.</p>
  <p>A minute passed, another&mdash;there was no sound. He raised himself guardedly
  then to an upright position, pressing close against the wall, but keeping
  well back at one side of the window. The window sill was shoulder high, and
  now, edging forward inch by inch, he obtained a diagonal glance through the
  pane. The room, as far as he could see, for the porti&egrave;res within were
  but partially drawn, was unoccupied. It was what he had counted upon. Tydeman,
  if the millionaire were following his usual custom, was at dinner, and the
  dining room was on the other side of the house. No one of the household,
  either family or servants, would ordinarily have any occasion to be in the
  library at this hour. Ordinarily! A glint came into the dark eyes, and the
  eyes narrowed as in a dogged, uncompromising challenge&mdash;and then the
  shoulders lifted in a debonair shrug. Well, that was the chance he took!
  He was gambling anyhow!</p>
  <p>His fingers crept to the window-sash, and tested it quietly. It would not
  move. Whether it was locked above or not, he did not know&mdash;the slight
  pressure that he was able to exert from the outside was at least not sufficient
  to lift it&mdash;but the improvised steel jimmy would quickly remedy that
  defect. He worked hurriedly now. The Western summer evenings were long and
  it was still light, and every minute he stood there was courting discovery.
  The edge of the chisel slipped in between the sill and the window-sash, and
  with the leverage the window was raised an inch or two. His question was
  answered.</p>
  <p>It had not been locked at the top.</p>
  <p>And now his fingers came into play again&mdash;under the window-sash. There
  was not a sound. The window went up easily and silently; and with a lithe,
  agile spring Dave Henderson swung himself up over the sill, dropped with
  a soft <i>pad</i> to the floor, and stood motionless, shrouded in one of
  the porti&egrave;res.</p>
  <p>The room was empty. The door leading from the library, he could see as he
  peered out, was closed. From the other side of the door, muffled, there came
  a laugh, the murmur of voices, indeterminate little sounds. The set, straight
  lips relaxed a little. The way was quite clear. The chances in his favor
  were mounting steadily. The family was undoubtedly at dinner.</p>
  <p>He made no sound as he stepped quickly now across the room. The rich, heavy
  pile of the velvet rug beneath his feet deadened his footfalls. And now he
  reached the massive flat-topped desk that stood almost in the center of the
  room. It was the most likely place, the natural place, for Tydeman to leave
  the money. If it was not here&mdash;again there came that debonair shrug&mdash;well
  then, he would look further&mdash;upstairs in Tydeman&rsquo;s bedroom, if
  necessary&mdash;or anywhere else, if necessary. One thing only was certain,
  and that was that, having started on the job, he would get the money, or
  they would get him&mdash;if he couldn&rsquo;t fight his way out. It was quite
  natural! Of course, he would do that! What else would he do? He had always
  done that! He had been brought up to it, hadn&rsquo;t he? Win or lose&mdash;he
  had always played win or lose. Cold feet and bet hedging was piker stuff&mdash;and
  that was in Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s line, too, not his!</p>
  <p>Keen, alert, his ears were sentinels against the slightest external sound.
  He was gnawing now in a sort of grim impatience at his lower lip, as he pulled
  open, drawer after drawer. Strange how his mind worked! The slickest crook
  in the U. S. A., they had said he would make. Well, perhaps he would, but,
  even so, it neither allured nor interested him. This was his first job&mdash;and
  his last. There was enough in this to see him through for the rest of his
  life. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been worth the risk otherwise, and he wouldn&rsquo;t
  have tackled it. Once East, and he could pretend to amass money little by
  little until no one would be surprised that he was worth a hundred thousand
  dollars. That was the trouble with the bunch he knew! Some of them had brains,
  but they worked their brains overtime&mdash;on small stuff&mdash;and they
  had to come again&mdash;to keep the living expenses going&mdash;and sooner
  or later they came once too often&mdash;and then it was the jug for theirs!</p>
  <p>He bent down suddenly to a lower drawer that was locked&mdash;the only one
  that he had found locked&mdash;and pried it open with the cold chisel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson imperturbably under his breath. &ldquo;I
  guess this looks like it&mdash;what? And all done up in a nice little package,
  too! Even more thoughtful of &rsquo;em than I had hoped!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took out a parcel from the drawer. It was securely tied with stout cord,
  and heavily sealed with great blobs of red wax that bore a bank&rsquo;s impression.
  There could indeed be but little doubt concerning the contents; but Dave
  Henderson, nevertheless, made a slight opening in one end of the wrapping
  paper&mdash;and disclosed to view crisp piles of brand-new yellowbacks. He
  nodded pleasantly to himself, as he consigned the package to the little black
  hand-bag.</p>
  <p>It was what he had come for&mdash;and got&mdash;one hundred thousand dollars.</p>
  <p>He closed the drawer, and knelt for an instant to examine it. Closed, it
  did not show enough of the chisel&rsquo;s work to attract attention; open,
  it at once became very apparent that the drawer had been forced. He smiled
  in satisfaction. That was exactly what he wanted! When, a little later, he
  drove up in Skarvan&rsquo;s car to the front door and requested the money,
  it was only then that it was likely to be missed for the first time; and
  certainly under such circumstances the last man on earth against whom any
  suspicion could arise would be himself. He had told himself that before.
  Well, why not repeat it? It was true, wasn&rsquo;t it?</p>
  <p>He retreated to the window, lowered himself to the ground, and regained
  the street. The thing was done. He was in possession of one hundred thousand
  dollars. There had not been the slightest difficulty or obstacle. He hummed
  an air under his breath, as he went along. It had been very simple&mdash;more
  so even than he had expected. It had been almost tame!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  The Trap</b></h2>
  <p>DAVE HENDERSON lost no time on his return journey. Within some fifteen or
  twenty minutes after leaving the residence of Mr. Martin K. Tydeman, he slipped
  into the lane at the rear of the shabby house on the shabby street that he
  called his home, and, entering the shed, closed the door softly behind him.
  Here, it was but the work of an instant to take the sealed package of banknotes
  from the black hand-bag, reach up, slide the package in through the little
  door of the old pigeon-cote, push the package over into one corner, cover
  it with the chaff and old straw with which, relics of bygone days of occupancy,
  the bottom of the pigeon-cote was littered, and to close the little door
  again.</p>
  <p>He stooped then, and, unlacing his shoes quickly, removed them. He had only
  one thing to guard against now, and his alibi was perfect, his possession
  of one hundred thousand dollars secure. Tooler must not hear him entering
  the house. Tooler must be morally convinced that he, Dave Henderson, had
  never left the house. As soon as he got back to his room again, he would
  put on his shoes, call up to Tooler that he was going, and, with the empty
  black hand-bag, get into his car&mdash;and drive up to Martin K. Tydeman&rsquo;s!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some uproar!&rdquo; confided Dave Henderson to himself. &ldquo;When
  I ask old Martin K. to fill the li&rsquo;l old bag, and he goes for the cash,
  there&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His mental soliloquy ended abruptly. He had opened the door noiselessly
  that led into the house, and was creeping without a sound along the hallway
  toward the door of his room at the front of the house&mdash;and now suddenly
  he stood rigid and motionless. Was it fancy, his imagination playing tricks
  upon him, or had Tooler come down-stairs? It seemed as though he had caught
  the sound of a lowered voice; and it seemed as though it had come from his
  own room there along the hall.</p>
  <p>And then he smiled sarcastically at himself, and began to creep forward
  again. He had complained of the whole thing being tame, and now he was getting
  an attack of nerves when it was all over! How could he have heard a lowered
  voice through the closed door of his room? It was a physical impossibility.
  And Tooler, in any case, was not in the habit of talking to <i>himself</i> Tooler
  never talked to any one if he could help it. The man always seemed to be
  nursing a perennial grudge that he hadn&rsquo;t been born a mute!</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s smile broadened at his little conceit&mdash;and the
  next instant vanished entirely, as his lips compressed suddenly into a hard,
  straight line. He had halted for the second time, hugged now close against
  the wall. The door of his room was <i>not</i> closed, and it was <i>not</i> Tooler&mdash;and
  it was <i>not</i> nerves. The door was slightly ajar; and the words came
  quite audibly; and the guarded voice had a haunting familiarity about it:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, I grabbed the train, an&rsquo; Bookie stalled on being able
  to get old Tydeman on the long-distance until after the train&mdash;an&rsquo; me
  on it&mdash;was on our way. Tumble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson did not move. Into his face there had come, set in a grayish-whiteness,
  a look that mingled stunned amazement and a gathering fury. He had recognized
  that voice now&mdash;and, in a flash, what that voice meant. It was Runty
  Mott, a miserable little red-haired rat of a race-course tout and hanger-on.
  Runty Mott&mdash;Bookie Skarvan! He remembered very well indeed that Bookie
  Skarvan could not get Tydeman on the long distance until after the train
  was gone!</p>
  <p>Another voice chuckled in malicious assent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take it from me&rdquo;&mdash;it was Runty Mott again&mdash;&ldquo;Bookie
  Skarvan&rsquo;s got some head! <i>Some</i> head! He was wiped out all right,
  but I guess this puts him on Easy Street again. Fifty thousand for him, an&rsquo; we
  split the rest. Bookie says to me, he says, &lsquo;If Dave goes an&rsquo; gets
  that money, an&rsquo; disappears afterwards,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
  a cinch, with the ragged reputation he&rsquo;s got, that he stole it, an&rsquo; beat
  it for parts unknown, an&rsquo; if them parts unknown,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;is
  a nice little mound of earth somewheres in the woods about six feet long
  an&rsquo; four feet deep, due to Dave having collided with a blackjack, I
  guess the police&rsquo;ll be concluding after a while that Dave was smart
  enough to give &rsquo;em the slip, an&rsquo; get away with the coin for keeps.
  You grab the train for &rsquo;Frisco, Runty,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;an&rsquo; wise
  up Baldy Vickers to what I say. You got a good two hours,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;to
  set the stage up there before Dave blows in.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>Came that malicious chuckle again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; the poor boob went an&rsquo; cracked the crib himself!&rdquo; ejaculated
  Runty Mott&rsquo;s companion&mdash;and chuckled once more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Runty Mott. &ldquo;Bookie called the turn all right
  on the guy&rsquo;s reputation&mdash;he was born a crook. Well, it makes it
  all the easier, don&rsquo;t it? It might have been harder to get him when
  we wanted him if he&rsquo;d just gone up there an&rsquo; got the money on
  the level. As it is now, he&rsquo;s ducking his nut, trying to play innocent,
  an&rsquo; he comes back here to make a nice fresh start up to old Tydeman&rsquo;s
  again. Only he didn&rsquo;t reckon on any one trailing him from the minute
  he got out of his car! I guess we got him&mdash;good. Spike telephoned ten
  minutes ago that Dave was on his way back. If he comes in by the shed, the
  boys&rsquo;ll see he don&rsquo;t get out that way again; an&rsquo; if he
  comes in by the front he&rsquo;ll get a peach of a welcome home! Tumble?
  This is where he croaks&mdash;an&rsquo; no noise about it&mdash;an&rsquo; you
  look out that you swing the lead so&rsquo;s you won&rsquo;t have to swing
  it twice. We can carry him out through the shed, an&rsquo; get the mortal
  remains away in a car with no one the wiser.&rdquo; Runty Mott was chuckling
  now quite as maliciously as his companion. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see the
  headlines in the papers! &lsquo;Promising Young Man Succumbs to Temptation.&rsquo; Say,
  it&rsquo;s the safest thing that was ever pulled, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; He
  stopped suddenly. A low whistle sounded from the street in front. &ldquo;Keep
  quiet!&rdquo; cautioned Runty Mott. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming in by the lane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was silent in the house&mdash;only the silence began to pound and throb,
  and become a world of riot and dismay, and make confused noises of its own.
  Crouched against the wall, Dave Henderson raised his hand to his forehead&mdash;and
  drew his hand away damp with beads of moisture. There was an overmastering
  rage, a tigerish ferocity upon him; but his brain, most curiously, was deadly
  cold in its composure, and was working now swift as lightning flashes, keen,
  alert, shrewd, active. The words he had just heard meant&mdash;<i>murder</i>.
  His murder! The very callousness of the words but lent a hideous sincerity
  to them. Also he knew Baldy Vickers&mdash;if any further proof was needed.
  Baldy Vickers was a gangster to whom murder was a trade; and Baldy Vickers
  with stakes in the thousands, when he would have committed any crime in the
  decalogue with greedy haste for a hundred-dollar bill, meant&mdash;murder.</p>
  <p>He was stooping now, silently, with the utmost caution, slipping on his
  shoes. And now from the rear there came a faint sound, a low creaking, like
  the stealthy rending of wood. He knew what it meant: They were forcing the
  shed door&mdash;to follow him in here&mdash;to cut off his escape, and to
  assist if necessary in the work those two were waiting to perform in his
  room, which he was expected to enter.</p>
  <p>His face was set, drawn in lines as hard as chiselled marble. And yet he
  could have laughed&mdash;laughed out in the bitterest mockeries. The game
  was up&mdash;even if he saved his life. He would be &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; for
  the theft of one hundred thousand dollars. He could not cover that up now.
  If he escaped Baldy Vickers and his pack, he would still be a fugitive from
  the law. And, worse still, he would be a fugitive empty-handed, chased like
  a mangy dog who had risked his all for a bone&mdash;and had dropped the bone
  in his flight! God, if he could only get back there and get that money! But
  there were footsteps coming now&mdash;his straining ears could hear them&mdash;they
  were coming nearer and nearer to the door that opened from the shed into
  the rear of the house. Fury surged upon him again. Skarvan! Bookie Skarvan!
  It was Skarvan, not Baldy Vickers, not that miserable, red-headed rat of
  a tout in there, that he would have sold his soul at that instant to settle
  with. It was Skarvan, the dirty Judas, not the others, who, smug and safe,
  had planned his, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s, murder in deliberate, coldblooded
  hellishness! Well, if he, Dave Henderson, lived, Bookie Skarvan would pay...
  an eye for an eye... that was God&rsquo;s law, wasn&rsquo;t it?... well,
  as certainly as God lived, Bookie Skarvan would pay... it was another incentive
  for him, Dave Henderson, to live now....</p>
  <p>The brain works with incredible speed. Those footsteps had not yet quite
  reached the door leading into the hall. His shoes were on now; and now his
  eyes fell upon the empty black hand-bag which, to facilitate his movements
  in putting on his shoes, he had set down on the floor beside him, and there
  came, flickering suddenly over the tight-pressed lips, a curious smile. He
  might not get through; there was only one way to get through&mdash;his car
  out there in front&mdash;a dash for it, though it was certain that there
  would be others of Baldy Vickers&rsquo; crowd lurking out there, too; he
  might not get through, but if he did, there was a way, too, to save that
  hundred thousand dollars, or, at least, to keep it from Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s
  claws!</p>
  <p>Into the dark, narrowed eyes there came a glint of humor&mdash;but it was
  grim, deadly humor. They believed, of course, that he had the money in the
  bag, since he would be credited with no object for having already disposed
  of it, the natural presumption being that, with the money once in his possession,
  he would make a run for it&mdash;and they must continue to believe that&mdash;be
  given no reason to believe otherwise. It was dangerous, an added risk, but
  if he pretended to fall unwarily into their trap, pretended to be unconscious
  that there was, for instance, a blackjack waiting for him in his room, their
  suspicions would never be aroused&mdash;and neither they nor any one else
  would ever suspect for an instant that the money was not still in the bag
  as he dashed from the house.</p>
  <p>He was creeping forward again silently toward the door of his room. That
  was logical. They would expect that. They would expect him to creep in silently
  and stealthily, on account of Tooler upstairs&mdash;or, if they did not exactly
  expect it, it would explain itself in that very logical way to them afterwards.</p>
  <p>Behind him now the door leading into the hall was being opened cautiously,
  so cautiously that he would not have heard it if he had not been listening
  for it, expecting it. But he was just at the edge of the jamb of his own
  door now. He straightened up, his hand reached out for the door handle, and,
  still retaining his grasp upon the knob and standing in full view upon the
  threshold, he pushed the door open to the extent of his outstretched arm.</p>
  <p>The slickest crook in the United States, they had said he would make! He
  would try and not disappoint them!</p>
  <p>His eyes swept the interior in a flash. A burly figure was crouched low
  down against the wall within striking distance of the door, an ugly looking,
  leather-covered baton in his hand&mdash;Runty Mott was not in sight. It was
  for the fraction of a second that he stood there&mdash;no more&mdash;not
  long enough for that crouching figure to recover from its surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; gasped Dave Henderson, in well-simulated dismay; and,
  leaping backward, pulled shut the door, and dashed for the door to the street.</p>
  <p>There was a yell from the room; it was echoed by a shout, and the pound
  of racing feet from the rear of the hall. Dave Henderson wrenched the front
  door open&mdash;and slammed it behind him. A figure rose before him on the
  steps. His left hand, free, swung with all his body weight behind it, swung
  with a terrific blow to the point of a scrubby jaw that blocked his way&mdash;and
  the figure crumpled, and went down with a crash on the doorstep.</p>
  <p>It was but a yard to the curb and his car. He threw himself into the driver&rsquo;s
  seat. Pandemonium seemed loosed now from the house. Up above, a second-story
  window was raised violently, and Tooler&rsquo;s head was thrust out; below,
  the front door was flung wide open, and, the red-headed little tout in the
  van, four men were racing down the steps. And then, over the chorus of unbridled
  blasphemy, there rose a shrill yell from Runty Mott, which was answered from
  somewhere down the street.</p>
  <p>The car, like a mad thing stung into action, shot forward from the curb.
  A hand grasped at the car&rsquo;s side, and was torn loose, its owner spinning
  like a top and pitching to the sidewalk. Dave Henderson flung a glance over
  his shoulder&mdash;and his jaws clamped suddenly hard together. Of course!
  That shout of Runty Mott&rsquo;s! But he had not underestimated either Baldy
  Vickers&rsquo; cunning, or Baldy Vickers&rsquo; resourcefulness. He had rather
  expected it. A big, powerful gray car had swept around the corner of the
  first street behind him, and, slowing for an instant, was picking up Runty
  Mott and his companions.</p>
  <p>And now Dave Henderson laughed a little in a sort of grim savagery. Well,
  the race was on&mdash;and on to a finish! He knew the men too well in that
  gray car behind him to delude himself for a moment with any other idea. They
  wanted that little black hand-bag, and they would get it if they could; and
  they would get him, if they could, at any cost. Again he laughed, and now
  with the laugh came that debonair lift to his shoulders. His brain was working
  in swift, lightning flashes. The only hope of shaking them off was in the
  open&mdash;if his car were the faster. And if it were not the faster? Well
  then, yes&mdash;there was still a chance&mdash;on a certain road he knew,
  the road he had traveled that afternoon&mdash;if he could make that road.
  It was a chance, a gambling chance, but the best chance&mdash;to win all&mdash;or
  lose all. There would be no hedging&mdash;it was all or nothing&mdash;win
  or lose. They would not dare use their revolvers here in the city streets,
  they could only cling close on his trail; and neither of them here in the
  city could put the respective speed of their cars to the test&mdash;but in
  the open, in the country&mdash;</p>
  <p>He looked over his shoulder again. The big gray car, some fifty yards in
  the rear, held five passengers. He could distinguish the little red-haired
  tout in the front seat beside the man who was driving, a short, thick-set
  man, whose cap was pulled down over his eyes&mdash;Baldy Vickers. He nodded
  his head. His glance had measured something else. By leaning forward in his
  seat and crouching low over the wheel, the back of his car seemed high enough,
  not to afford him absolute immunity, but to afford him at least a fair chance
  of protection once he elected to invite the shots that would be fired from
  the car behind.</p>
  <p>Then the thought came that by one of a dozen ways, by leaping from his car
  as he turned a corner, for instance, and darting into a building, he might
  give his pursuers the slip here in the city. But it was no good! The game
  was up! He was not only a fugitive from Baldy Vickers and his wolves, he
  was a fugitive now from the police. And if by some such means as that he
  managed to give Baldy Vickers the slip, there was still the police&mdash;and
  with a police drag-net out he cut his chances of escape by better than half
  if he remained in the city. It would not be long now before Tydeman, in view
  of his, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s, non-appearance, would become aware of the
  theft; and, granting that he eluded Baldy Vickers, the gangster, eager for
  revenge, would be the first to curry favor with the police&mdash;Baldy Vickers
  had only to state that one of his pals saw him, Dave Henderson, crawling
  out through Tydeman&rsquo;s library window. There was nothing to it! The
  game was up&mdash;even if he saved his life. Thanks to Bookie Skarvan! His
  jaws clamped again, and the knuckles of his hands stood out in white knobs
  as they clenched in sudden passion on the wheel. Thanks to Bookie Skarvan!
  By God, that alone was worth living for&mdash;to settle with Bookie Skarvan!</p>
  <p>Like some sinister, ominous thing, silently, attracting no attention from
  the passers-by, the big gray car maintained its distance fifty yards behind.
  That grim humor, deadly in its cold composure, was upon Dave Henderson again.
  He meant to be taken by neither Baldy Vickers, nor by the police; nor did
  he intend that a certain package containing one hundred thousand dollars
  in cash should fall into the hands of either Baldy Vickers or the police!
  Some day, even yet, he might find use for that particular package himself!</p>
  <p>Block after block was traversed, corner after corner was turned, as Dave
  Henderson threaded his way through the streets, heading steadily for the
  outskirts of the city, and the road on which he had already traveled ninety
  miles that day. And fifty yards behind came on that big gray car. They were
  well content, no doubt&mdash;the occupants of that car! He was playing their
  game for them! He was playing the fool! In the city their hands were tied!
  Out in the country they would be free to do something more than merely follow
  silently behind him! Well, that was all quite true&mdash;perhaps! But out
  in the country, if he got away from them, he would not at least jump from
  the pot into the fire and have the police at his heels the very next instant;
  and, besides, there was that hundred thousand dollars! The further away he
  got from &rsquo;Frisco the more inviolate became Mrs. Tooler&rsquo;s old
  pigeon-cote!</p>
  <p>Fifty yards! He glanced behind him again. It was still fifty yards&mdash;<i>start</i>.
  Well, fifty yards was fifty yards, and he might as well take it now. He was
  well in the outskirts, the houses were becoming scattered, an open road was
  ahead, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>He bent suddenly low over the wheel, and flung the throttle wide. The car
  leaped forward like a thoroughbred answering to the spur. There was a burst
  of yells from behind&mdash;and then silence, save for the rush of the wind,
  the creak of the swaying, lurching car, and the singing throb of the sixty
  horse-power engine, unleashed now, in full stride under the lash.</p>
  <p>A mile, two miles&mdash;the speed was terrific. There was no sound from
  behind&mdash;just the roar of his own car in his ears. The houses were fewer
  now&mdash;it was the open country. Another mile! He was at his absolute maximum
  of speed now. He straightened up slightly, and shot a quick glance over his
  shoulder. The big gray car was fifty yards behind.</p>
  <p>A shot rang out&mdash;and then a fusillade of them. He was low over the
  wheel again, his jaws set rigidly. Was it fifty yards? He was not sure, he
  was not sure but that it was less&mdash;he was only sure that it was not
  more.</p>
  <p>The shots ceased for a moment. A car, coming in the opposite direction,
  had taken to the extreme edge of the road, half into the ditch. He had a
  flash of a woman&rsquo;s face, as he swept by&mdash;great dark eyes that
  stared out of a death-white face&mdash;a beautiful face even in its terror&mdash;it
  haunted him, that face.</p>
  <p>A furious, sustained racketing, like a thousand echoes reverberating through
  a rocky, high-walled canon, stilled the roaring sweep of the wind, and the
  roaring of his car. He shot through the main street of a town like a meteor,
  and laughed out like a madman. A dog escaped by the fraction of an inch,
  and, tail down, scurried with a sharp yelp for the sidewalk; there was a
  dash for horses&rsquo; heads at the curbs; people rushed to doorways and
  windows, peering out; women screamed; men yelled hoarsely; a fat woman, retreating
  wildly as she was about to cross the road, dropped a laden basket-to shake
  her fist in panic fury. It was kaleidoscopic&mdash;it was gone.</p>
  <p>The shots came again. Another town was passed&mdash;still another. The big
  gray car was not fifty yards behind now&mdash;it was less than thirty&mdash;so
  near that now there came from time to time an exultant yell.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s face was drawn, tense, its lines hard, sharp, strained;
  but in the dark eyes was still that smoldering light of grim, debonair humor.
  The race was almost at an end&mdash;he knew that now. He knew now that he
  could not shake off that gray streaking thing behind. It gained only by inches,
  they were well matched, the two cars, and it was a good race; but a few more
  miles would end it as those inches lengthened into feet and yards.</p>
  <p>Well, then, since he could not escape this way, there was still the other
  way; and if that failed, too, in the last analysis he had a revolver in his
  pocket. But it was not likely to fail, that other way. He had banked on it
  almost from the moment he had made his escape from the Toolers&rsquo; house.
  As between himself, Dave Henderson, and the hundred thousand dollars, Baldy
  Vickers, if Baldy Vickers could not get both, would very obviously and very
  earnestly prefer the hundred thousand dollars. His lips tightened in a sort
  of merciless irony. Well, Baldy Vickers would have a chance at least to exercise
  his preference! A few miles farther on, just a few miles, the road, in a
  wooded tract, made an abrupt, almost right-angled, turn. He remembered that
  turn&mdash;and he had banked on that, too, if by then speed alone should
  have failed him! He could hold out that much longer. The inches did not accumulate
  fast enough to overtake him before he reached that turn&mdash;he was not
  afraid of that&mdash;but every one of those inches made of him a better target.</p>
  <p>He was motionless, like a figure carved in stone, as he hung over the wheel.
  The car rocked to the furious pace&mdash;but it did not swerve. A swerve
  meant the gift of another of those inches to that gray thing behind. He held
  the center of the road, driving with all the craft and cunning that he knew,
  his arms like steel bands, his fingers locked in an iron grip upon the wheel.</p>
  <p>He did not look behind him now. It was useless. Nearer and nearer the gray
  car was creeping up, he was well aware of that; but, also, nearer and nearer
  came that wooded stretch ahead. He could see it now&mdash;a mile down the
  road. But a mile at this rate of speed did not take long to cover.</p>
  <p>The shouts grew more exultant behind him; the shots came thicker. Murderers!
  The angry hum of a bullet past his ear roused a fury in his soul that was
  elemental, primal, and he cursed now under his breath. Murderers... six feet
  of earth... in cold blood... or if they winged him, the car, amuck, slanting
  from the road to up-end itself, would do their bloody work for them... Bookie
  Skarvan... some day, if he lived through this... Bookie Skarvan... it was
  strange that all their shots had missed... even if the back of his car was
  a protection... they wouldn&rsquo;t have many more chances... the woods and
  the turn of the road were just ahead now, and...</p>
  <p>There was a crash, the splintering of glass, and a bullet shattered the
  wind-shield scarcely a hair&rsquo;s-breadth to the right of his head. A demoniacal
  yell of triumph went up from behind. They had him now&mdash;and, with him,
  one hundred thousand dollars! Again that grimace of merciless irony was twisting
  at Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips. It was the psychological moment, not only
  because that wood was just ahead, but because, realizing that his chances
  were desperate now, he would logically be expected to sacrifice anything&mdash;even
  that hundred thousand dollars&mdash;to save himself.</p>
  <p>Something, like the flick of a fiery lash, bringing a hot, burning sensation,
  was laid suddenly across his leg above the knee. It did not hurt very much&mdash;a
  bullet deflected probably from the rim of the steering wheel&mdash;but they
  had hit him at last. He laughed savagely&mdash;and snatched at the empty
  black hand-bag, and hurled it with all his might far out across the side
  of the road.</p>
  <p>A chorused yell answered his act. He looked back&mdash;and laughed again.
  It had not failed! They were stopping. Wolves! Again he laughed. And like
  wolves with slavering fangs they were after their prey! It would give him
  a minute, perhaps two&mdash;but that was enough!</p>
  <p>The car swept on, and rounded the turn, and the trees blotted out the view
  of the road behind. He jammed on the brakes, slewed the car half around,
  full across the road, and leaping from it, dashed in amongst the trees. The
  foliage was thick. He ran on. He was safe for the moment here in the woods;
  and presently it would be dark, and he would make across country to the railroad,
  and work his way East.</p>
  <p>The roar of the gray car coming on again at full speed reached him. He laughed
  as he ran, harshly, without mirth. They wanted vengeance now&mdash;vengeance
  because he had not let them murder him! Well, he did not mean to disappoint
  them! He had disappointed them once&mdash;with an empty bag! He would not
  disappoint them again! It was perfectly logical that there should be&mdash;vengeance.
  There was hardly room to stop that car around the turn!</p>
  <p>A wild cry, echoed by another, and still another, shrill in terror, rang
  out from the road over the roar of the speeding car&mdash;and then a terrific
  crash&mdash;a scream&mdash;silence.</p>
  <p>He had stopped mechanically. The wolves wouldn&rsquo;t bother him any more.
  It wasn&rsquo;t Baldy Vickers now, that smash would have taken the fight
  out of Baldy Vickers, if it hadn&rsquo;t taken anything more&mdash;it was
  the police. He clenched his hands in sudden, passionate fury. He was safe
  from Baldy Vickers here in the woods, anyhow; but, for all that, he had played
  and lost. He was a hunted man now. He was not whining, he had played and
  lost&mdash;only he had played against stacked cards. The face of Bookie Skarvan
  rose before him, and his hands clenched the tighter. He swept a knotted fist
  fiercely across his eyes. What was the use of that&mdash;now! Not now! He
  had something else besides Bookie Skarvan to think of now; there was the
  police, and&mdash;yes&mdash;his leg! It was burning hot, and it hurt now.
  He glanced downward. His trouser-leg was soaked with blood. His teeth gritted
  together&mdash;and he plunged on again through the woods.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  Two Thousand Dollars&rsquo; Reward&mdash;Dead Or Alive</b></h2>
  <p>THREE days, and four nights&mdash;was that it?</p>
  <p>It was hard to remember. It hadn&rsquo;t even been easy to get the little
  food he had had; it had been impossible to get his wound dressed, save in
  the rough, crude, wholly inadequate way in which he had been able to dress
  it himself&mdash;with pieces torn from his shirt and underclothing. They
  had hunted him like a mad beast. Those cursed police placards were everywhere!
  Everywhere! TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS&rsquo; REWARD&mdash;DEAD OR ALIVE. The
  police had acted quickly, quicker than he had ever thought they could act!
  Joe Barjan, Lieutenant Barjan of the &rsquo;Frisco plain-clothes squad, would
  have had a hand in this. Queer! He&rsquo;d given Barjan tips on the races,
  straight tips, honest tips, in the old days&mdash;not this kind of a race.
  Barjan and he used to get along all right together. Funny business!</p>
  <p>It was dark, pitch black&mdash;save only for a moon-ray that flickered and
  danced across the flooring of the bouncing, jolting boxcar, and that came
  in through the half-open, rattling door. He should have closed that door
  more tightly when he had crawled in. It had got loose again. Well, no matter!
  It couldn&rsquo;t do any harm for the moment, except for the noise it made,
  a noise that beat a devil&rsquo;s tattoo on his aching head. But that didn&rsquo;t
  matter, either. It wasn&rsquo;t as bad as the clatter and jangle and damnable
  everlasting creaking of the car&mdash;and he couldn&rsquo;t stop the car
  from creaking anyhow. When the train began to slow down for the next stop,
  he would go over and shut the door again. It was an effort to move&mdash;uselessly&mdash;before
  he had to.</p>
  <p>Three days, and four nights&mdash;was that it? It was hard to remember.
  But he must have put many miles, hundreds of them, between himself and &rsquo;Frisco.
  And he had lived through hell&mdash;alternately beating his way in some boxcar
  such as this, and hiding in the woods, or where he could. But the boxcars
  were mostly for the night&mdash;mostly for the night&mdash;it was safer.
  Damn those police circulars, and that reward! Every one was on the hunt for
  him&mdash;every one&mdash;two thousand dollars. How far East would he have
  to go and not find one of the haunting things nailed upon a station wall!
  The drag-net <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> reach out all the way&mdash;there was
  a limit&mdash;a limit to everything.</p>
  <p>His brain caught at the last phrase&mdash;a limit to everything. His lips
  were cracked and dry, and he touched them with his tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; He shook his head, whispering hoarsely a dogged defiance. &ldquo;No
  limit&mdash;win or lose&mdash;all the way&mdash;no limit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Through hell! The whole countryside was hell! They wouldn&rsquo;t even let
  him buy food. Well, he had stolen it&mdash;what he had had. They had nearly
  trapped him the second time he had tried to buy food&mdash;the night following
  his escape&mdash;in a little grocery store&mdash;a big, raw-boned, leering
  man who ran the place&mdash;the man hadn&rsquo;t got the two thousand dollars&rsquo; reward&mdash;no,
  not much of a fight&mdash;he had knocked the man out, and run for it&mdash;that
  was all. After that he hadn&rsquo;t tried to buy any food&mdash;he had stolen
  it&mdash;only he hadn&rsquo;t stolen very much. It was hard to get. It was
  even hard to get water, a drink of water sometimes. It didn&rsquo;t run everywhere.
  There weren&rsquo;t ponds and lakes and rivers everywhere. He couldn&rsquo;t
  ask anybody for a glass of water. There had been a ditch that afternoon.
  It had been muddy and slimy. Since then there had been nothing. He would
  have sold his soul for a few of those drops that had splashed in lavish abundance
  from the spout of the water-tank at the station earlier that night when he
  had crawled into the car here&mdash;he had seen the fireman on the back of
  the tender manipulating the spout, and he had heard the water splash.</p>
  <p>He spoke hoarsely again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shot full of fever, that&rsquo;s what I am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  shot full of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sprawled out on the floor of the car, he shifted his position a little;
  and, tight-locked though his lips were, there came an irrepressible moan
  of pain. God, how his eyes burned; how hot his head was, and how it throbbed
  and ached! The throbs kept devilish time, marching time, like the tramp of
  feet to the beat of the drum, to that ceaseless, brutal throbbing in his
  leg. He hadn&rsquo;t looked at his leg to-day&mdash;it had been bad enough
  yesterday. What was the use! He couldn&rsquo;t do anything. He hadn&rsquo;t
  even any water&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t any use dressing it with that slimy,
  muddy stuff he had drunk. It would have to get better&mdash;or worse.</p>
  <p>He touched his lips with his tongue again. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be
  any moisture on his tongue; it was thick and big in his mouth, so it couldn&rsquo;t
  be dried up, but there wasn&rsquo;t any moisture on it. Would the car never
  stop its jolting, and that infernal <i>clack-clack, clackety-clack!</i> There
  was abominable pain in every jolt, it seemed to shake his leg the way a mold
  of jelly would shake; it seemed to shake and vibrate to the bone itself.
  Sometimes it brought nausea and faintness.</p>
  <p>Perhaps there <i>was</i> a limit! He had lain exhausted for a long time,
  bathed in sweat from his exertions, when he had climbed and clawed his way
  into the car. He remembered now&mdash;that was why he hadn&rsquo;t shut the
  door tightly. He must be getting pretty near his limit to go down like a
  lump of putty just through climbing from the track into a boxcar. He clenched
  his hands in fierce denial. No! No limit&mdash;it was win or lose&mdash;no
  hedging&mdash;it was all the way&mdash;even against stacked cards.</p>
  <p>Stacked cards! The pain was gone momentarily in a sweep of fury that brought
  him up from his back to sway like a pendulum upon his elbows with the swaying
  of the car. He owed Bookie Skarvan for this. He owed it to Bookie Skarvan
  that he was a hunted, wounded thing. He owed every thrust of pain that caught
  at and robbed him of his breath to Bookie Skarvan. He owed it to Bookie Skarvan
  that he was an outcast for the rest of his life. He owed Bookie Skarvan for
  as damnable and callous an attempt to murder him as was ever hatched in a
  human brain. And they had left Bookie Skarvan to him! His laugh rang loud
  and hollow, a bitter, sinister sound, unbridled in its deadly passion, through
  the car. They had left Bookie Skarvan to him! It was good to think of that&mdash;very
  good, like a drink of water, icy water, with the beads frosting on the long
  glass. They had left Bookie Skarvan to him. Well, he would not change the
  story they had told! He would promise them that. Not by a word! They had
  left Bookie Skarvan to him!</p>
  <p>He knew the story. Last night in a switchman&rsquo;s shanty in a railroad
  yard he had found a newspaper&mdash;the story was there. Baldy Vickers and
  Runty Mott, who had been sitting in the front seat of the big gray car, were
  in the hospital from the smash; the others had not been much hurt. Bookie
  Skarvan&rsquo;s car had been identified, what there was left of it, and that
  formed an implicating link between him, Dave Henderson, and Baldy Vickers&rsquo; crowd.
  Runty Mott and Vickers, being forced therefore to explain, had told a story
  that was almost true&mdash;but they hadn&rsquo;t split on Bookie Skarvan&mdash;they
  had left Bookie Skarvan out of it. The story was enough of a confession,
  smacked enough of State&rsquo;s evidence to let them out of any criminal
  proceedings, even if there had been any really definite charge that could
  be brought against them. They hadn&rsquo;t stolen the money! The story rang
  true because it was <i>almost</i> true&mdash;only they had left Bookie Skarvan
  out of it.</p>
  <p>Runty Mott, according to the newspaper, had been the spokesman. Runty said
  he had overheard Bookie Skarvan and Dave Henderson at the race-course, when
  they were making arrangements to get the money from Tydeman. He, Runty Mott,
  had taken the train for &rsquo;Frisco, and had put it up to Baldy Vickers.
  Then they had followed Dave Henderson, meaning to take the money from him
  the first chance they got. But Dave Henderson had handed them a jolt by crawling
  in through Tydeman&rsquo;s library window, and stealing it himself. After
  that they had figured the easiest place to grab the coin was in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s
  room, when he sneaked back there with the black hand-bag. And Dave Henderson
  had walked right into their trap, only they hadn&rsquo;t heard him coming
  any more than he, in turn, had been wise to the fact that they were there,
  and in the showdown he had managed to jump through the front door and reach
  his car. He had the money in the black hand-bag with him. They had chased
  him in the other car that the police had found smashed up, and had nearly
  got him, when he threw the black hand-bag out of the car. They stopped to
  pick it up, and found out the trick he had played on them. The hand-bag was
  empty; he still had the money in his car. They took up the chase again&mdash;and
  crashed into the other machine where Dave Henderson had left it blocking
  the road just around a sharp turn.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s laugh rang with a devil&rsquo;s mirth through the
  boxcar again. That was all! They hadn&rsquo;t split on a pal. They had left
  the pal to him. Runty Mott had told the story&mdash;and Runty Mott&rsquo;s
  story went! He, Dave Henderson, wouldn&rsquo;t change it! They didn&rsquo;t
  know, and Bookie Skarvan didn&rsquo;t know, <i>that he knew</i>. They had
  left Bookie Skarvan to him&mdash;and they had made Mrs. Tooler&rsquo;s pigeon-cote
  as safe as a vault.</p>
  <p>The slue of the car on a curve flung him with a savage wrench from his elbows
  to his back again, and he groaned in agony. Red flashes danced before his
  eyes, and nausea came once more, and faintness&mdash;and he lay for a long
  time still. It seemed as though he no longer had any power to move; even
  the pain seemed to have become subordinate to a physical sense of weakness
  and impotence that had settled upon him. His head grew dizzy and most strangely
  light.</p>
  <p>There came the blast of the engine whistle, the grind and thump of buffer
  beams, the shriek of the brake-shoes biting at the wheel tires, the sickening
  sensation of motion being unsmoothly checked. His mind did not grasp the
  significance of this for a moment&mdash;and then with a frantic effort he
  struggled to his feet.</p>
  <p>The door! The car door! He must close it&mdash;he must close the door. The
  train was stopping. If any one passed by outside and saw the door open, and
  looked in, he was caught. He was too weak to fight any more; too weak to
  run any more. He must close the door.</p>
  <p>He could not stand. The car swayed, and bumped, and lurched too much! No
  one could stand with the car jolting around in circles like that! He dropped
  to his knees. He could crawl, then. The door! The car door! It must be closed&mdash;even
  if he had to drag himself to it.</p>
  <p>It wasn&rsquo;t far to the door&mdash;just a few feet. It was the pain in
  his leg that made him faint, but he could get that far&mdash;just to the
  door. He touched his lips with his tongue again. They weren&rsquo;t dry now,
  his lips, and there was a curious taste upon them, and they hurt. They tasted
  of blood. That was funny! His teeth must have sunk into his lips somehow.
  But he was almost at the door now&mdash;yes, he could reach it now. Only
  he couldn&rsquo;t close it when he was lying flat down like this. He would
  have to get up&mdash;on his knees at least.</p>
  <p>His hand swept across his eyes, and pressed fiercely upon his forehead.
  The moon-ray wavered in through the door in jagged, glancing streaks&mdash;he
  had to shut that moon-ray out&mdash;to make it black here in the car. Strange!
  It was growing black now, even though he had not shut the door&mdash;perhaps
  it was a cloud&mdash;the moon passing behind a cloud. His body seemed to
  sway, to be out of control, and his knees, instead of balancing him, crumpled
  suddenly beneath him, pitching him forward, face downward, on the floor of
  the car&mdash;and something seemed to snap inside his head, and it was black,
  all blackness.</p>
  <p>Repose, comfort, ineffable luxuriousness, something soft and soothing supporting
  his body, and a freedom from the excruciating, unbearable, intolerable pain
  that he had been enduring! He was dreaming! He dared not open his eyes. It
  was a dream. If he opened his eyes he would dispel the illusion, and the
  pain would come again.</p>
  <p>It seemed as though he had been upon a great journey that was crowded with
  a multitude of strange, fantastic scenes and happenings. He could not remember
  them all distinctly; they jumbled together in his memory&mdash;the orphan
  school, the race-track, Square John Kelly and three thousand dollars in the
  Pacific Coral Saloon on the Barbary Coast, all conglomerated into one.</p>
  <p>He remembered only one thing distinctly, and that was because it had happened
  so often. He was in a great, gloomy forest, and always just ahead of him
  was Bookie Skarvan. He did not know why it was, but he could always see Bookie
  Skarvan in the darkness, though Bookie Skarvan could not see him. And yet
  he could never quite reach that fat, damnable figure that kept flitting around
  the trees. Bookie Skarvan was not running away, because Bookie Skarvan did
  not even know that he was being followed&mdash;and yet Bookie Skarvan always
  eluded him.</p>
  <p>If he was dreaming now, it was at least a very vivid dream. He remembered.
  He had just fallen unconscious on the floor of the car. Well, then, he must
  get the door shut, if he was to escape. Yes, the pain might come again if
  he moved, it would take all his will power to shatter this blessed restfulness,
  and he was still very tired; but he had no choice&mdash;it was win or lose&mdash;all
  the way&mdash;no limit.</p>
  <p>He opened his eyes. He did not understand at first; and then he told himself
  quite simply that of course he could not still be lying on the floor of that
  lurching car, and at the same time feel these soft things all around his
  body. He was in bed&mdash;in a white bed, with white covers&mdash;and there
  was a screen around his bed. And around the corner of the screen he could
  see other beds&mdash;white beds with white covers. It must be a hospital
  ward. There was some one sitting in a chair beside the foot of his bed&mdash;no,
  not a nurse; it was a man. The man&rsquo;s face for the moment was turned
  slightly away. He studied the face. It seemed familiar. His eyes opened a
  little wider. Yes, it was familiar! A cry surged upward from his soul itself,
  it seemed&mdash;and was choked back. His hands, clenched fiercely, relaxed.
  There came a queer smile to twist his lips.</p>
  <p>The man at the foot of the bed was looking at him now. It was Barjan, Lieutenant
  Joe Barjan, of the &rsquo;Frisco plain-clothes squad.</p>
  <p>The man spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Dave!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Joe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was silence.</p>
  <p>The other spoke again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tough luck, Dave! Sorry to grab you like this. Feeling better?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>Barjan nodded his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was touch and go with you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bad leg, bad
  fever&mdash;you&rsquo;ve been laying like a dead man since the night they
  found you in the freight car.&rdquo; Dave Henderson made no reply. There
  wasn&rsquo;t any door to shut now, and he wouldn&rsquo;t have to move now...
  until he went away with Joe there... back to &rsquo;Frisco. He wasn&rsquo;t
  squealing... stacked cards... a new deal with a new pack perhaps... some
  day... he wasn&rsquo;t squealing... but he couldn&rsquo;t fight any more...
  not now... he couldn&rsquo;t fight... he was too weak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hanging around two or three days waiting for you
  to come out of dreamland, so&rsquo;s I could ask you a question,&rdquo; said
  Barjan pleasantly. &ldquo;Come across, Dave! Where&rsquo;d you put that little
  package you had with you when you beat it from the car, and handed Baldy
  the broken ribs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson smiled. He was very weak, miserably weak, it was an effort
  to talk; but his brain, because there wasn&rsquo;t any pain, was clear&mdash;clear
  enough to match Barjan&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come again?&rdquo; said Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, can that!&rdquo; A tinge of impatience had crept into the police
  officer&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;We got the whole story. Runty Mott and Baldy
  Vickers opened up&mdash;wide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I read about them in the papers,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson. &ldquo;They
  said enough without me butting in, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said Barjan sharply, &ldquo;that you won&rsquo;t
  come across?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson. &ldquo;Their story
  goes, doesn&rsquo;t it? I wouldn&rsquo;t spoil a good story. They said I
  took the money, and if you believe them, that goes. I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No good!&rdquo; snapped Barjan. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better open up
  on where that money is, or it will go hard with you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How hard?&rdquo; inquired Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Barjan grimly. &ldquo;Five years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Five years! How long was five years? His mind was growing tired now, too,
  like his body. He forced himself to the effort of keeping it active. It was
  a long way from where Baldy Vickers had broken his ribs, and where they thought
  he, Dave Henderson, had last had the money, to Mrs. Tooler&rsquo;s old pigeon-cote!
  And a hundred thousand dollars in five years was twenty thousand dollars
  a year&mdash;salary, twenty thousand dollars a year. Five years! It was win
  or lose, wasn&rsquo;t it? No hedging! Five years&mdash;five years before
  he could settle with Bookie Skarvan!</p>
  <p>He spoke aloud unconsciously:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time to wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bet your life, it is!&rdquo; said Barjan. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
  fool yourself! It&rsquo;s a hell of a long time in the pen! And if you think
  you could get away with the wad when you get out again, you&rsquo;ve got
  another think coming, too! Take it from me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about the money,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson
  slowly. &ldquo;I was thinking about that story.&rdquo; He closed his eyes.
  The room was swimming around him. Five years&mdash;chalked up to Bookie Skarvan!
  His hand on the coverlet clenched, and raised and fell impotently to the
  coverlet again. He was conscious that Barjan was leaning over the bed to
  catch his words, because he wasn&rsquo;t speaking very loud. &ldquo;I was
  thinking it was a long time to wait&mdash;to get even.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A woman&rsquo;s voice seemed to come drifting out of space... that would
  be the nurse, of course... a woman&rsquo;s voice....</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well! You may be a police officer, but you
  had no business to make him talk. He is not strong enough to stand any excitement,
  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The voice drifted off into nothingness.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  Convict No. 550</b></h2>
  <p>FROM somewhere far along the iron gallery, a guard&rsquo;s boot-heel rang
  with a hollow, muffled, metallic sound; from everywhere, as from some
  strange, inceptive cradle, the source out of which all sounds emanated, and
  which, too, was as some strange sounding-board that accentuated each individual
  sound as it was given birth, came a confused, indeterminate, scarcely audible
  rupture of the silence that never ceased its uneasy, restless murmur. It
  was like water simmering in a caldron&mdash;only the water was a drear humanity,
  and the caldron was this gray-walled, steel-barred place.</p>
  <p>A voice, low, quite inarticulate, falling often to little more than a whisper,
  mumbled endlessly on. That was the old bomb-thrower, old Tony Lomazzi, the
  lifer, in the next cell. The man was probably clinging to the bars of his
  door, his face thrust up against them, talking, talking, talking&mdash;always
  talking to himself. He did not disturb anybody. Everybody was used to it;
  and, besides, the man did not talk loudly. One even had to listen attentively
  to catch the sound of his voice at all. It had become a habit, second nature;
  the man was incorrigible. Presently the guard would come along, and perhaps
  rap the old man on the knuckles; after that Lomazzi would retire to his cot
  quite docilely. It had been that way night after night, week after week,
  month after month, year after year.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson laid the prison-library book, that he had been fingering
  absently, down on the cot beside him. It was still early evening in early
  summer, and there was still light in the cell, though hardly enough to read
  by; but he had not been reading even when there had been better light. His
  mind was too active to-night. And now there was a curiously wistful smile
  on his face. He would miss that stumbling, whispering voice. A most strange
  thing to miss! Or was it the old man himself whom he would miss? Not to-morrow,
  not even next week, there still remained sixty-three days&mdash;but sixty-three
  days, with all the rest of the five years behind them, gone, served, wiped
  out, were like to-morrow; and, as against a lifer&rsquo;s toll, it was freedom,
  full born and actually present. Yes, he would miss Tony Lomazzi. There was
  a bond between the old man and himself. In almost the first flush of his
  entry into the penitentiary he had precipitated a fight amongst his fellow
  convicts on account of old Tony. Two of them had gone into the hospital,
  and he, Dave Henderson, had gone into the black hole.</p>
  <p>He sat suddenly bolt upright on his cot. He had not forgotten the horror
  of those days of solitary confinement. He was not likely to forget them&mdash;the
  silence, the blackness. The silence that came at last to scream and shriek
  at him in myriad voices out of the blackness until he was upon the verge
  of screaming and shrieking back in raving, unhinged abandon; the blackness
  that was as the blackness of the pit of hell, and that came at last to be
  peopled with hideous phantom shapes that plagued him until, face down on
  his cot, he would dig his fists into his eyes that he might not see&mdash;the
  blackness! His hands clenched hard as the memory of it surged upon him; but
  a moment later he laughed a little under his breath. It had been bad, bad
  enough; but he wasn&rsquo;t there <i>now</i>, was he? Old Tony hadn&rsquo;t
  deluged him with any excessive thanks. The old man had simply called him
  a fool&mdash;but there had been a difference after that. On the march out
  from the cells, old Tony was always the man behind him, and old Tony&rsquo;s
  shoulder touch in the lock-step wasn&rsquo;t as perfunctory as it had been
  before. And there had been years of that. Yes, he would miss old Tony Lomazzi!</p>
  <p>Instinctively he turned his head in the direction of that voice that whispered
  through the bars of the adjoining cell, and his face, lean and hard, softened,
  and, tinging the dead-white prison pallor, a flush crept into his cheeks.
  The man was a lifer. A lifer! God, he knew what that meant! Five years of
  a living hell had taught him that. Five years that were eternities piled
  upon eternities, and they were only a short step along the path toward the
  only goal to which a lifer could look forward&mdash;death!</p>
  <p>Yes, he knew! The massed eternities, that were called five years by those
  who walked outside in the sunlight, where men laughed, and women smiled,
  and children played, had taught him why old Tony Lomazzi clung to the bars
  and whispered.</p>
  <p>Five years! Was it only five years since he had stood in the dock in that
  courtroom, and the judge had sentenced him to&mdash;five years? The scene
  was vivid and distinct enough! Even the ages that spanned the gulf between
  the now and then could not efface that scene, nor dim it, nor rob it of a
  single stark and naked detail. Tydeman had been there&mdash;Martin K. Tydeman,
  that prince of royal sports. Tydeman was about the only man in that courtroom
  whose presence had made him uneasy; and yet Tydeman, too, was the only man
  in that courtroom who had been friendly toward him. It was probably due to
  the old millionaire&rsquo;s plea for leniency that the sentence had been
  five years, and not ten, or fifteen, or twenty, or whatever it might be that
  the erect, spare little figure on the bench, with the thin, straight lips,
  had had the right to pronounce. And Tydeman was dead now.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson stirred uneasily on the edge of the cot. He drew his hand
  slowly across his eyes. He had wished from the start, hadn&rsquo;t he, that
  it might have been some one else rather than Martin K. Tydeman? But it <i>had</i> been
  Tydeman&rsquo;s money, and the hundred thousand dollars alone was all that
  had counted, and Tydeman was dead now, had been dead two or three years,
  and on that score that ended it&mdash;didn&rsquo;t it?</p>
  <p>The dark eyes, that had wavered abstractedly around the cell, narrowed suddenly,
  and from their depths a smoldering fire seemed to leap as suddenly into flame.
  But there was another score that was not ended! Bookie Skarvan! Baldy Vickers,
  Runty Mott and the rest of Baldy&rsquo;s gang had lied speciously, smoothly,
  ingeniously and with convincing unanimity. They had admitted the obvious&mdash;quite
  frankly&mdash;because they could help themselves. They had admitted that
  their intention had been to steal the hundred thousand dollars themselves.
  But they hadn&rsquo;t stolen it&mdash;and that let them out; and they proved
  that he, Dave Henderson, had&mdash;and that saved their own hides. Also they
  had not implicated Bookie Skarvan.</p>
  <p>Their story had been very plausible! Runty Mott &ldquo;confessed&rdquo; that,
  on the morning of the crime, he had overheard Bookie Skarvan and Dave Henderson
  making their arrangements at the race course to get Tydeman to put up the
  money to tide Bookie Skarvan over the crisis. He, Runty Mott, had then left
  at once for San Francisco, put the deal up to Baldy Vickers and Baldy&rsquo;s
  gang, and they had waited for Dave Henderson to arrive. Naturally they had
  watched their proposed prey from the moment of his arrival in the city, intending
  to rob him when the money was in his possession and before he got back to
  the race course that night; but instead of Tydeman turning the money over
  to Dave Henderson, as they had expected, Dave Henderson had completely upset
  their plans by stealing the money himself, and this had resulted in the prisoner&rsquo;s
  attempted getaway, and the automobile chase which represented their own efforts
  to intercept him.</p>
  <p>The dark eyes were almost closed now, but the gleam was still there&mdash;only
  now it was half mocking, half triumphant, and was mirrored in a grim smile
  that flickered across his lips. He had not denied their story. To every effort
  to obtain from him a clue as to the whereabouts of the stolen money, he had
  remained as mute and unresponsive as a stone; cajolery, threats, the hint
  of lighter sentence if restitution were made, he had met with silence. He
  had not even employed a lawyer. The court had appointed one. He had refused
  to confer with the lawyer. The lawyer had entered a perfunctory plea of &ldquo;not
  guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The grim smile deepened. There had been very good reasons why he had refused
  to open his lips at that trial&mdash;three of them. In the first place, he
  was guilty; in the second place, there was Bookie Skarvan, who had no suspicion
  that he, Dave Henderson, knew the truth that lay behind Runty Mott&rsquo;s
  story; and in the third place&mdash;there was one hundred thousand dollars.
  There was to be no hedging. And he had not hedged! That was his creed. Well,
  it had paid, hadn&rsquo;t it, that creed? The hundred thousand dollars was
  almost his now&mdash;there were only sixty-three days left. He had bought
  it with his creed, bought it with five years wrung in blood and sweat from
  his life, five years that had turned his soul sick within him. He had paid
  the price. Five years of sunlight he had given for that hundred thousand
  dollars, five years that had sought to bring the slouch of slavery and subjugation
  to his shoulders, a cringe into his soul, a whimper into his voice, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>He was on his feet, his hands clenched until his knuckles cracked. And he
  stood there for a long time staring at the barred door, and then suddenly
  he shrugged his shoulders, and relaxed, and laughed in a low, cool way. But
  he had won, hadn&rsquo;t he, even on that score? It was not often that the
  penitentiary would do for a man what this devil&rsquo;s hole had done for
  him! He had entered it a crude, unpolished assistant to a crooked bookmaker,
  his education what he had acquired before he had run away from an orphan
  school at ten; and he could leave the place now, given the clothes and the
  chance, and pass anywhere for a gentleman&mdash;thanks in a very large measure
  to Charlie Millman.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson began to pace slowly up and down his cell. Millman had never
  understood, of course, just why he had had so apt a pupil. He had never explained
  to Millman that it had been from the very beginning his plan to rise to the
  level of a hundred thousand dollars that was waiting for him when he got
  out! Millman knew, of course, what he, Dave Henderson, was up for; but that
  was about all. And Millman had perhaps, and very naturally so, attributed
  his, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s, thirst for polish and education to the out-cropping
  of the inherent good that in him was, the coming to the surface finally of
  his better nature. And so Millman, up for two years, had proved a godsend,
  for there hadn&rsquo;t been much progress made along the lines of &ldquo;higher
  education&rdquo; until Millman had come into the prison.</p>
  <p>He liked Millman; and somehow Millman seemed to like him. A gentleman from
  the tip of his fingers was Millman&mdash;and he took his medicine like a
  gentleman. Millman wasn&rsquo;t the name that was entered on the prison books&mdash;there
  it was Charlie Reith.</p>
  <p>It was strange that Millman should have given him his confidence; he could
  never quite understand that, except that it had seemed to come gradually
  as their friendship grew, until finally it was almost the basis of that friendship
  itself. He had come to trust Millman as he had never trusted any other man,
  and he had come to believe in Millman as the soul of courtesy and honor.
  And yet he had not been quite as open with Millman as Millman had been with
  him; he had not spread his cards upon the table, and Millman had never asked
  to see them; and somehow he liked the man all the better for that. It was
  not that he did not trust the other; it was because his confidence was not
  the sort of confidence to give to an <i>honest</i> man&mdash;and Millman
  was honest. There was a queer twist to it all!</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson smiled grimly again. It wouldn&rsquo;t be <i>fair</i> to
  make an honest man a party to the secret of where that money was, for instance,
  would it&mdash;to make an honest man an accomplice after the fact? And there
  was no doubt of Millman&rsquo;s clean-cut, courageous honesty. The prison
  stripes could not change that!</p>
  <p>He knew Millman&rsquo;s story: A nasty bit of work on the Barbary Coast,
  and viciously clever. Millman, a stranger in the city, and en route for a
  long trip through the South Seas, had been inveigled by a woman&rsquo;s specious
  plea for help into a notorious resort on the night in which a much-wanted
  member of the underworld was hard put to it to give the police the slip&mdash;and
  Millman had unsuspectingly made himself the vehicle of the other&rsquo;s
  escape.</p>
  <p>The details were sordid; the woman&rsquo;s story pitifully impressive; and
  Millman&rsquo;s chivalry had led him, innocent of the truth, to deprive the
  plain-clothes squad of the services of one of their best men for the period
  of several months&mdash;while one of the slickest counterfeiters in the United
  States, and the woman with him, had made good their getaway. It didn&rsquo;t
  look innocent in the eyes of the police, and Millman had stood for two years&mdash;convicted
  as Charles Reith&mdash;to save the name of Charles Millman, and those that
  belonged to him back in New York. He had been found in a very unsavory place,
  and no amount of explanation could purify those surroundings. Millman had
  never said so in so many words, but he was buying a little woman&rsquo;s
  peace of mind back there in New York with two years&rsquo; hard labor. And
  meanwhile he was supposed to be somewhere on a trading schooner in the out-of-the-way
  isles of the Pacific, or something like that&mdash;maybe it was Borneo on
  a hunting trip&mdash;he, Dave Henderson, didn&rsquo;t remember just precisely
  how the other had fixed it. It didn&rsquo;t matter! The point was that they
  had made Millman one of the convict librarians in the prison, and Millman
  had become his tutor and his friend. Well, Millman was another he would miss.
  The day after to-morrow Millman&rsquo;s time was up, and Millman would be
  gone. He was glad for Millman&rsquo;s sake.</p>
  <p>Five steps and a half from the rear wall of the cell to the steel-barred
  door, and five and a half steps back again&mdash;over and over. He was unaccountably
  restless to-night both in body and mind. He had spent his five years, less
  the time that had been manumitted for good conduct, and less the sixty-three
  days that still remained, not altogether to his own disadvantage in an educational
  sense. In that respect he was satisfied he was now ready to leave the prison
  and make the most of that hundred thousand dollars&mdash;not as a &ldquo;raw
  skate,&rdquo; blowing it to the winds, but as one who would make it pay dividends
  on those five years of servitude that represented its purchase price. It
  was enough, that amount, for the rest of his life, if he took care of it.
  It meant comfort, independence, luxury. He didn&rsquo;t want any more. That
  was the amount he had already fixed and decided upon even before the opportunity
  had come to take it. It was his first job&mdash;but it was equally his last.
  And it was his last because he had waited until, at the first attempt, he
  had got all he wanted. He wasn&rsquo;t coming back to the penitentiary any
  more. He was going out for good&mdash;in sixty-three days.</p>
  <p>Sixty-three days! He wanted no piker, low-brow life at the end of those
  sixty-three days when he got out. He had had enough of that! That was one
  reason why he had taken the money&mdash;to pitch that one seamy room at Tooler&rsquo;s
  and the rotten race-track existence into the discard, and he was ready now,
  equipped, to play the part he meant to play. He had spent the years here
  learning not to eat with his knife, either literally or metaphorically. But
  there were only sixty-three days left, and there was still <i>one</i> thing
  he hadn&rsquo;t done, one problem still left unsolved, which of late had
  been growing into nightmare proportions. In the earlier years of his sentence
  he had put it aside&mdash;until the time came. That time was here now&mdash;and
  the problem was still aside.</p>
  <p>He had made all other preparations. He had even communicated secretly, by
  means of a fellow convict who was going out, discharged, with Square John
  Kelly of the Pacific Coral Saloon in San Francisco, with whom he had invested
  his savings&mdash;that three thousand dollars at six per cent. And he had
  had foresight enough to do this months ago in order to give Kelly time to
  pull the money out of his business and have it ready in cash; for he wasn&rsquo;t
  quite sure where the law stood on this point. Failing to recover the proceeds
  of the Tydeman robbery, the law might confiscate those savings&mdash;if the
  law knew anything about them. But the law didn&rsquo;t&mdash;and wouldn&rsquo;t.
  Square John had sent back word that everything was all right.</p>
  <p>But there was still one problem left to solve&mdash;the way, once he was
  a free man again and outside these walls, of getting that hundred thousand
  dollars away from under the noses of the police and then giving the police
  the slip. And this, grown to monumental proportions in the last few months,
  rose before him now like some evil familiar that had taken possession of
  both his waking and sleeping hours. And there came upon him now, as it had
  come again and again in these last months, that scene in the hospital when
  he had first opened his eyes to consciousness and they had rested on the
  face of the man who had run him to earth&mdash;Barjan, Lieutenant Joe Barjan,
  of the &rsquo;Frisco plainclothes squad. And Joe Barjan&rsquo;s words were
  ringing in his ears now; ringing, somehow, with a cursed knell in them:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fool yourself! It&rsquo;s a hell of a long time in the
  pen! And if you think you could get away with the wad when you get out again,
  you&rsquo;ve got another think coming too! Take it from me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An acute sense of the realization of the <i>tangibility</i> of his surroundings
  seized upon him and brought a chill to his heart. That hard, unyielding cot;
  these walls, that caged him within their few scanty feet of space; his keepers&rsquo; voices,
  that lashed out their commands; the animals, of which he was one, that toiled
  upon the eternal treadmill of days whose end but foretold another of like
  horror and loathing to come! Barjan had told the truth; more of the truth
  than Barjan ever knew, or could know, that he had told. It had been a hell
  of a long time. Long! His face, as he still paced the cell, grayed under
  the prison pallor. God, it had been long! Years of damnable torment that
  had shut him out from the freedom that he loved! It had been a price beyond
  all reckoning that he had paid for that hundred thousand dollars. But he
  had paid it! He had paid it&mdash;paid it! He had gone all the way&mdash;gone
  the limit. Was Barjan, right in one thing, right in that other thing as well&mdash;that
  at the end they would beat him?</p>
  <p>His hands curled into knotted lumps. There were not enough Barjans for that
  though the world were peopled with Barjans! The thought had brought a chill
  of dread for a moment, that was all. He had paid the price; he was not likely
  to forget what that price had been; and he would never yield up what that
  price had bought. True, he had no plan for this last play of his worked out
  in detail, but he would find a way&mdash;because he must. He was probably
  exaggerating what the police would, or could do, anyhow! At first when he
  had come into the penitentiary, they had tried to trap, sometimes to wheedle
  him into disclosing where the money was, though they had long since given
  up those tactics and left him to himself. But suppose the police did watch
  him now when he got out. He could afford to wait&mdash;to wait a long while&mdash;until
  the police got tired, perhaps, or perhaps came to the conclusion that, after
  all, they had got the wrong man. They would not forget that, though he had
  refused to say anything at the trial, he had not been so mute in his attitude
  toward Runty Mott and Baldy Vickers, who had &ldquo;sent him up;&rdquo; and
  Barjan would not forget, either, that in the hospital that day, with scarcely
  strength to speak, he had threatened to get even with the gangster and the
  Runt. There was a psychological factor in this. If he, Dave Henderson, made
  no effort to get the money, showed no sign that he had any knowledge of its
  whereabouts, might not the police in time come to the far from illogical
  conclusion that they might better have watched&mdash;five years ago&mdash;the
  men who had so glibly acted as witnesses for the State, the men who had,
  admittedly, themselves attempted to steal the money? It wasn&rsquo;t unreasonable,
  was it? And he could afford to wait. The three thousand dollars from Square
  John Kelly would keep him going for quite a while! He was a fool to let this
  thing madden his brain with its constant torturing doubts. It was their move&mdash;not
  his.</p>
  <p>From far along the iron gallery again a boot-heel rang with a dull, metallic
  sound. It was the guard, probably, coming to rap old Tony Lomazzi over the
  knuckles. Dave Henderson stopped his restless pacing, and stood still in
  the center of the cell to listen. No, the old bomb-thrower wasn&rsquo;t talking
  any longer; there wasn&rsquo;t any sound at all except that boot-heel ringing
  on the iron flooring. The sound came nearer, and Dave Henderson frowned in
  a puzzled way. The guard was not alone, in any case. He could distinguish
  the footsteps of two men now. It wasn&rsquo;t usual at this hour for any
  one to be out there with the guard. What was in the wind? The warden, perhaps,
  making an unexpected round, or&mdash;</p>
  <p>His hands gripped suddenly hard and tight&mdash;but he did not move. There
  came flashing over him once more the scene in that hospital ward of five
  years ago. The cell door had opened and closed. A man had entered. The guard&rsquo;s
  footsteps died away outside. The man spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello, Dave!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Barjan, Lieutenant Joe Barjan, of the &rsquo;Frisco plain-clothes
  squad. It <i>was</i> the scene of five years ago. That was exactly what Barjan
  had said then: &ldquo;Hello, Dave!&rdquo; And he had answered: &ldquo;Hello,
  Joe!&rdquo; But he did not answer now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is a little irregular, Dave,&rdquo; said Barjan pleasantly; &ldquo;but
  I wanted to have a quiet little chat with you, you know, before&rdquo;&mdash;he
  stepped forward and clapped his hand on Dave Henderson&rsquo;s shoulder,
  and laughed&mdash;&ldquo;well, before you changed your address.&rdquo; Dave
  Henderson made no reply. He moved back from the other, and sat down on the
  edge of his cot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a couple of things I want to say to you,&rdquo; said
  Barjan, still pleasantly. &ldquo;And the first of them is that I want to
  tell you on the level just where you stand. You&rsquo;re going out of here
  pretty soon now, Dave. I guess you&rsquo;ve got a better line on that than
  I have&mdash;eh?&rdquo; He laughed again good-humoredly. &ldquo;Got the days
  counted, haven&rsquo;t you, Dave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No answer. Dave Henderson&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the ungainly lines
  of the toe of his prison boot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, now, Dave!&rdquo; Barjan&rsquo;s tones were still hearty
  and jocular, but the heartiness and jocularity, as though disconcerted, lacked
  some of their original spontaneity. &ldquo;Loosen up! You&rsquo;ve been a
  clam for five years. That&rsquo;s long enough. I&rsquo;ve come up here to-night
  to play square with you. You know that whatever I say goes with both of us.
  I know you aren&rsquo;t holding anything against me personally just because
  I happened to be the one who put the bracelets on you, and back of that we
  used to be pretty good friends. I haven&rsquo;t forgotten the tips you used
  to give me in the old days&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you think I have, either!
  Remember when that old skeleton with the horse-hair cover pranced away with
  a forty-to-one shot? Bonnie Lass, her name was&mdash;or was it Boney? Remember?
  She got the hee-haw&mdash;but my missus got the swellest outfit of gewgaws
  and fixings the old girl ever had before or since. You wised me up to that,
  Dave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No answer. There seemed to be something curiously significant in the uncouthness
  and the coarseness of that boot toe&mdash;but the significance was irritatingly
  elusive in its application.</p>
  <p>There was silence for a moment. Barjan walked the length of the cell, and
  back again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, halting in front of the cot. &ldquo;Maybe
  we&rsquo;ll get along better on another tack. I&rsquo;m not beating about
  the bush, Dave&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was a little harder, crisper, sterner&mdash;&ldquo;I
  want to know where that hundred thousand dollars is. But I told you that
  I&rsquo;d put you straight first on where you stand. Now, listen! We&rsquo;ve
  played both ends to the middle. We believed that the story Runty Mott and
  Baldy Vickers told was true; but both men had a record, and you can&rsquo;t
  be sure of a crook on his own say-so. We didn&rsquo;t take any chances, and
  so we&rsquo;re sure now. Those men were watched&mdash;not for a couple of
  weeks, or a couple of months, but for the last four years. They don&rsquo;t
  know where the money is, and they never did know what you did with it after
  you handed them that automobile smash and beat it for the woods. Get that?
  It&rsquo;s up to you! And now, get this: I told you in the hospital that
  day, you remember, that you could never get away with it, and that&rsquo;s
  as true as I&rsquo;m standing here talking to you now. You&rsquo;ve got some
  brains, Dave&mdash;use &rsquo;em now for your own sake. From the moment you
  step outside these walls you&rsquo;re a marked man, and not for just a little
  while either, but for all your life. They&rsquo;ll never let up on you, Dave.
  Let that sink in! And it ain&rsquo;t only just old Joe Barjan you&rsquo;ve
  got to fool. Talking racey, Dave, your number&rsquo;s up on the board on
  every police track in this country from one end to the other. You can&rsquo;t
  beat that kind of a game. I&rsquo;m talking straight, and you know it. Come
  on now, Dave, pry them lips of yours apart, and come across!&rdquo; Dave
  Henderson&rsquo;s lips parted&mdash;but it was only to touch them with the
  tip of his tongue. They were dry. His eyes were still on that coarse, ungainly
  toe. Its significance had taken concrete form now. He knew now what it meant.
  It typified a living hell of five long years, a ghastly hell and a ghastly
  price paid for that hundred thousand dollars&mdash;years that had left a
  stench in his nostrils that would live as long as he lived&mdash;years that
  piled the daily, never-ending details of petty persecutions, of loathsome
  associations, of miserable discomforts, of haggard dreariness, of heart sickness,
  of bitterness that was the bitterness of gall, into one overwhelming mass
  of horror from which the soul recoiled, blanched, seared, shrivelled. And
  it went back further than that. It went back to a night of the long, long
  ago, eternities ago, a night when, in physical torture and anguish from his
  wound, his teeth had sunk into his lips, and he had become blood-fanged like
  the hunted animal at bay he was, and he had endured until the blackness came.
  That was what it meant, this rough, heavy ungraceful clod of a prison boot
  upon his foot! It meant that he had gone the limit, that he had never hedged,
  that he had paid the price, all of it&mdash;all of it&mdash;except only the
  sixty-three days that were left.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you going to say anything, Dave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tony Lomazzi must have shuffled his way back to the bars of his cell door.
  The old Italian was whispering and muttering again. If one listened very
  intently, one could hear him. There was no other sound.</p>
  <p>Barjan cleared his throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use, Dave?
  I&rsquo;ve showed you that you&rsquo;re bound to lose, and that on that score
  it don&rsquo;t pay. And it don&rsquo;t pay any way you want to look at it.
  You don&rsquo;t have to go out of here a marked man, Dave. There ain&rsquo;t
  any truth in that&mdash;that the police never give a guy a chance to go straight
  again. There ain&rsquo;t anything in that. It&rsquo;s all up to the guy himself.
  You come across, make good on that money, and I&rsquo;ll guarantee you&rsquo;ll
  get the squarest deal any man ever got. Why, it would be proof in itself
  that you meant to go straight, Dave, and everybody&rsquo;d fall over himself
  to give you the glad hand. You can see that, can&rsquo;t you, Dave? Don&rsquo;t
  you want to look the other fellow in the eye for the rest of your life? Don&rsquo;t
  you want to be a free man? You&rsquo;ve got a lot of years ahead of you.
  Ain&rsquo;t you ever thought of a home, and kiddies, maybe? It don&rsquo;t
  pay, Dave&mdash;the other way don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ve got the chance now
  to make good. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tony Lomazzi was still muttering. Strange the guard was letting the old
  bomb-thrower have so much license to-night! Tony seemed to be chattering
  louder than he had ever chattered in all the years he had occupied that next
  cell there!</p>
  <p>Barjan laughed a little in a low, but not unpleasant way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, listen again, Dave,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I got one
  more thing to tell you. You know what I&rsquo;ve said is right. You come
  across, and I&rsquo;ll see that you get your chance&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t
  have to wait for it, either, Dave. I&rsquo;ve got it all fixed, I&rsquo;ve
  got the papers in my pocket. You come across, and you walk out of here a
  free man with me right now&mdash;to-night!&rdquo; He leaned forward and slapped
  Dave Henderson&rsquo;s shoulder again. &ldquo;To-night, Dave&mdash;get that?
  Right now&mdash;tonight&mdash;this minute! What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was true! The tentative plan he had half formulated was no good! He realized
  that now. To lay low and wait was no good&mdash;Barjan had made that clear.
  The hope that the police might veer around to the belief that Runty Mott
  and Baldy Vickers were, after all, the men to watch, was no good either&mdash;Barjan
  had made that equally clear. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be any way out&mdash;and
  his number was up on the board on every police track in the country. Yes,
  that was true, too. He lifted his eyes from the toe of his boot for the first
  time, and met Barjan&rsquo;s eyes, and held the other&rsquo;s for a long
  minute in a steady gaze.</p>
  <p>And then Dave Henderson spoke&mdash;for the first time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You go to hell!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  Wolves On The Scent</b></h2>
  <p>GUARDS on the raised platforms at either end of the room, guards circulating
  amongst the striped figures that toiled over the work benches, guards watching
  everywhere. They aroused a new and sullen fury in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s
  soul. They seemed to express and exemplify to-day in a sort of hideous clearness
  what Barjan had told him last night that he might expect in all the days
  to follow.</p>
  <p>His number was up on the board!</p>
  <p>He had not slept well last night. Barjan did not know it, but Barjan had
  struck a blow that had, in a mental way, sent him groggy to the ropes. He
  was groggy yet. His mind was in confusion. It reached out in this direction&mdash;and
  faltered, not quite sure of itself; it groped out in another direction&mdash;and
  faltered. It seemed to have lost its equilibrium and its poise. He had never
  expected that the whole world would turn its back while he walked from the
  penitentiary to Mrs. Tooler&rsquo;s pigeon-cote and tucked that package of
  a hundred thousand dollars under his arm. In that sense Barjan had told him
  nothing new. But nevertheless Barjan had struck home. He could not tell just
  where in the conversation, at just precisely what point, Barjan had done
  this, nor could he tell in any concrete way just what new difficulties and
  obstacles Barjan had reared up. He had always expected that it was up to
  him to outwit the police when he got away from these cursed guards. But his
  mind was haggard this afternoon. He had lashed it, driven it too hard through
  the night and through the morning. It had lost tenacity; it would not define.
  The only thing that held and clung there, and would not be dislodged, was
  the unreal, a snatch of nightmare out of the little sleep, fitful and troubled,
  that he had had. He was swimming across a dark, wide pool whose banks were
  all steep and impassable except at one spot which was very narrow, and here
  a figure worked feverishly with a pile of huge stones, building up a wall
  against him. He swam frantically, like a madman; but for every stroke he
  took, the figure added another stone to the wall; and when he reached the
  edge of the bank the wall was massive and high, and Barjan was perched on
  the top of the wall grinning at him.</p>
  <p>He raised his hand, and drew it across his eyes. The clatter and clamor
  in the carpenter shop here around him was unendurable. The thud of a hammer
  jarred upon him, jangling his nerves; the screech of the bandsaw, a little
  way down the shop, was like the insane raving of some devil, with a devil&rsquo;s
  perverted sense of humor, running up and down a devil&rsquo;s scale. There
  were sixty-two days left.</p>
  <p>His eyes fell upon old Tony Lomazzi a few benches away. Showing under Tony&rsquo;s
  cap, the hair, what there was of it, was silver&mdash;more nearly silver
  than it had somehow ever seemed to be before. Perhaps the prison barber had
  been a little late in getting around to the old man this time, perhaps it
  was because it was a little longer, perhaps that was it. It was strange though,
  rather queer! His eyes, arrested now, held on the other, and he seemed to
  be noticing little details that had never attracted his attention before.
  His own hands, that mechanically retained their grip upon the plane he had
  been using, were idle now. Certainly those old shoulders over there were
  more bowed and bent than he had ever seen them before. And the striped form
  was very frail; the clothes hung on it as clothes hang on a scarecrow. There
  was only the old fellow&rsquo;s side face in view, for the other&rsquo;s
  back was partially turned, but it appeared to possess quite a new and startling
  unfamiliarity. It wasn&rsquo;t the gray-white, unhealthy pallor&mdash;old
  Tony wasn&rsquo;t the only one who had that, for no one had ever claimed
  that there was any analogy between a penitentiary and a health resort&mdash;but
  the jowl was most curiously gaunt, and drawn inward as though the man were
  sucking in his cheeks, and yet the skin seemed to be stretched tight and
  hard as a drum-head. Very curious! It must be because he couldn&rsquo;t see
  the sharp little black eyes, full of fire, that put life and soul into that
  scarecrow frame.</p>
  <p>Old Tony turned, and their eyes met. The old man lifted his hand as though
  to wipe his mouth&mdash;and there was a little flirt of the fingers in Dave
  Henderson&rsquo;s direction. It was the old, intimate, little signal that
  had passed between them unnumbered times in the thousand years that they
  had spent together here in the penitentiary&rsquo;s carpenter shop&mdash;but
  he had been quite wrong about the eyes. Something seemed to have filmed across
  them, veiling their luster. And suddenly Dave Henderson swallowed hard. Sixty-two
  days! Old Tony hadn&rsquo;t much more than that. Perhaps another year at
  the outside, and the old lifer would be free, too.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s mind reverted to Lieutenant Joe Barjan, of the plain-clothes
  squad. It was perfectly true that playing a lone hand against the police
  of all America was a desperate game&mdash;desperate in the sense that success
  was in jeopardy. That was what made his brain confused and chaotic now. He
  was afraid&mdash;not of Barjan, not of all the police in the United States
  in a physical way, he had never hedged a bet, and the five years that he
  had now paid would goad him on more than ever to face any physical risk,
  take any physical chance&mdash;but he was afraid now, sick with fear, because
  his mind would not respond and show him clearly, definitely the way to knock
  Barjan and his triumphant grin from off that nightmare wall, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>A guard&rsquo;s voice snapped sharply at his elbow.</p>
  <p>Yes, of course! He had been standing idle for a few seconds&mdash;perhaps
  an hour. Automatically he bent over the bench, and automatically his plane
  drew a neat, clean shaving from the work in front of him.</p>
  <p>The guard&rsquo;s voice snapped again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wanted!&rdquo; said the guard curtly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
  a visitor to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson turned away from the bench, and followed the guard; but the
  act was purely mechanical, born out of the years of discipline and obedience.
  A visitor&mdash;for him! There was no one in the outside world, not a soul,
  who cared for him; not many even, to whom his existence was of enough interest
  to cause a second thought&mdash;except Barjan. And Barjan had visited him
  yesterday. Another visitor&mdash;to-day! Well, whoever it was, the visitor
  had been in no hurry about it! The little attention was certainly belated!
  His lips thinned bitterly. Whoever it was had waited almost five years. He
  had never had a visitor before&mdash;except the police. It was an event!
  The bitterness grew deeper, and rankled. He had asked for no human touch,
  or thought, or consideration; he had asked for none, and he had given none;
  he had made his own bed, and he had not whined because it had proved to be
  a rack of torture. He was not whining now, and he had no desire to change
  the rules of the game that he himself had elected to play. This was no visitor&mdash;it
  was an intruder!</p>
  <p>But curiosity, as he crossed the prison yard and entered the main building,
  tempered the sullen antagonism that had flared up in his soul. Who was it
  that was waiting for him there along the corridor in the wire-netted visitor&rsquo;s
  room, where, like some beast with its keeper pacing up and down in front
  of the cage, he was to be placed on exhibition? He searched his brain for
  an answer that would be even plausible. Not Square John Kelly. Kelly <i>might</i> have
  come if Kelly had been left to himself, but Kelly was the one man he had
  warned off from the beginning&mdash;there was that matter of three thousand
  dollars, and caution had prompted him to avoid any sign of intimacy between
  them. There was no one else. Even Kelly, perhaps, wasn&rsquo;t a friend any
  more. Kelly would, perhaps, simply play square, turn over the three thousand
  dollars&mdash;and then turn his back. It wouldn&rsquo;t be Tooler. The only
  thing that interested Tooler was to see that he collected his room rent regularly&mdash;and
  there would be some one else paying rent now for that front room at Tooler&rsquo;s!
  No, there was no one else. Leaving a very keen regard for old Tony Lomazzi
  aside, he had only one friend that he knew of whom he could really call a
  friend, only one man that he could trust&mdash;and that man was a convict
  too! It was ironical, wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;to trust a convict! Well, he
  could trust Millman&mdash;only it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair to Millman.</p>
  <p>He lagged a little behind the guard as they approached the visitor&rsquo;s
  room, a sudden possibility dawning upon him. Perhaps it <i>was</i> Millman!
  Millman&rsquo;s time was up to-morrow, and to-morrow Millman was going away.
  He and Millman had arranged to say good-by to one another at the library
  hour to-day after work was over; but perhaps, as a sort of special dispensation,
  Millman had obtained permission to come here.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson shrugged his shoulders, impatient with himself, as the guard
  opened a door and motioned him to enter. It was absurd, ridiculous! Who had
  ever heard of one prisoner visiting another in this fashion! There wouldn&rsquo;t
  have been any satisfaction in it anyhow, with a guard pacing up and down
  between them! Well, then, who was it?</p>
  <p>The door closed behind him&mdash;he was subconsciously aware that the door
  had closed, and that the guard had left him to himself. He was also subconsciously
  aware that his hands had reached out in front of him and that his fingers
  were fiercely laced in the interstices of the heavy steel-wire netting of
  the enclosure in which he stood, and that faced another row of steel-wire
  netting, separated from his own only by the space that was required to permit
  the guard to pace up and down between the two&mdash;only the guard hadn&rsquo;t
  come in yet from the corridor to take up his station there. There was only
  a face peering at him from behind that other row of netting&mdash;a fat face&mdash;the
  face was supposed to be smiling, but it was like the hideous grin of a gargoyle.
  It was the same face, the same face with its rolls of fat propped up on its
  short, stumpy neck. There wasn&rsquo;t any change in it, except that the
  red-rimmed gray eyes were more shifty. That was the only change in five years&mdash;the
  eyes were more shifty. He found that his mouth was dry, curiously dry. The
  blood wasn&rsquo;t running through his veins, because his fingers on the
  wire felt cold&mdash;and yet he was burning, the soul of him suddenly like
  some flaming furnace, and a mad, passionate fury had him in its grip, and
  a lust was upon him to reach that stumpy neck where the throat was, and&mdash;and&mdash; He
  had been waiting five years for that&mdash;and he was simply smiling, just
  as that other face was smiling. Why shouldn&rsquo;t he smile! That fat face
  was Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess you weren&rsquo;t looking to see me, Dave?&rdquo; said Skarvan,
  nodding his head in a sort of absurd cordiality. &ldquo;Maybe you thought
  I was sore on you, and there&rsquo;s no use saying I wasn&rsquo;t. That was
  a nasty crack you handed me. If Tydeman hadn&rsquo;t come across with another
  bunch of coin on the jump, those pikers down at the track would have pulled
  me to pieces. But I didn&rsquo;t feel sore long, Dave&mdash;that ain&rsquo;t
  in me. And that ain&rsquo;t why I kept away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man was quite safe, of course, on account of these wire gratings, and
  on account of the guard who was somewhere out there in the corridor. It was
  very peculiar that the guard was not pacing up and down even now in this
  little open space between Bookie Skarvan and himself&mdash;very peculiar!
  Bookie was magnanimous&mdash;not to be sore! He wanted to laugh out in a
  sort of maniacal hysteria, only he would be a fool to do that because there
  were sixty-two days left before he could get his fingers around that greasy,
  fat throat, and he must not <i>scare</i> the man off now. He had a debt to
  pay&mdash;five years of prison, those days and nights and hours of torment
  when he had been a wounded thing hounded almost to his death. Certainly,
  he owed all that to this man here! The man had cunningly planned to have
  him disappear by the <i>murder</i> route, hadn&rsquo;t he? And he owed Bookie
  Skarvan for that too! If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that he would have got
  away with the money, and there wouldn&rsquo;t have been five years of prison,
  or those hours of physical torment, or&mdash;</p>
  <p>He lifted his hand and brushed it heavily across his forehead. He was quite
  cool now, perfectly in control of himself. The man didn&rsquo;t have even
  a suspicion that he, Dave Henderson, knew these things. He mustn&rsquo;t
  put the other on his guard&mdash;there were still sixty-two days during which
  these prison walls held him impotent, and during which another, warned, could
  get very far out of reach. Yes, he was quite cool now. He was even still
  smiling, wasn&rsquo;t he? He could even play the man like a hooked fish.
  It wasn&rsquo;t time to land the other yet. But it was strange that Bookie
  Skarvan should have come here at all. Bookie wasn&rsquo;t a fool; he hadn&rsquo;t
  come here for nothing. What was it the man wanted?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you glad to see me, Dave?&rdquo; demanded Bookie Skarvan
  quite jocularly. &ldquo; &rsquo;Cause, if you ain&rsquo;t now, you will
  be before I go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Dave Henderson coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Notice anything queer about what&rsquo;s doing here right at this
  minute?&rdquo; Bookie&rsquo;s left eye closed in a significant wink. &ldquo;Sure,
  you do! There ain&rsquo;t any guard butting in, Dave. Get me? Well, I fixed
  it like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson relapsed into the old vernacular.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Spill it!&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Attaboy!&rdquo; Bookie grinned. &ldquo;You bet you&rsquo;re listening!
  We ain&rsquo;t forgotten those years you and me spent together, have we,
  Dave? You know me, and I know you. I kept away from here until now, &rsquo;cause
  I didn&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em to get the right dope on the betting&mdash;didn&rsquo;t
  want &rsquo;em to think there was any chance of us playing up to each other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean you didn&rsquo;t want them to get wise that you were a crook,
  too,&rdquo; suggested Dave Henderson imperturbably.</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan had no false modesty&mdash;his left eyelid drooped for the
  second time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You got the idea, Dave,&rdquo; he grinned again. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
  got to figure I&rsquo;m straight&mdash;that&rsquo;s the play. That&rsquo;s
  the play I&rsquo;ve been making in waiting five years&mdash;so&rsquo;s they&rsquo;d
  be sure there wasn&rsquo;t nothing between us. Now you listen hard, Dave.
  All you&rsquo;ve handed the police is a frozen face, and that&rsquo;s the
  right stuff; but I got a dead straight tip they&rsquo;re going to keep their
  eyes on you till hell&rsquo;s a skating pond. They&rsquo;re going to get
  that money&mdash;<i>or else you ain&rsquo;t!</i> See? Well, that&rsquo;s
  where I stepped in. I goes to the right source, and I says: &lsquo;Look here,
  you can&rsquo;t do nothing with Dave. Let me have a try. Maybe I can handle
  him. He worked for me a good many years, and I know him better than his mother
  would if he had one. He&rsquo;s stubborn, stubborn as hell, and threats ain&rsquo;t
  any good, nor promises neither; but he&rsquo;s a good boy, for all that.
  You let me have a chance to talk to him privately, and maybe I can make him
  come across and cough up that money. Anyway, it won&rsquo;t do any harm to
  try. I always liked Dave, and I don&rsquo;t want to see him dodging the police
  all his life. Tydeman&rsquo;s dead, and, though it was really Tydeman&rsquo;s
  money, I was a partner of Tydeman&rsquo;s, and if anybody on earth can get
  under Dave&rsquo;s shell I can.&rsquo;&rdquo; Bookie put his face closer
  to his own particular stretch of wire netting. He lowered his voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  the reason I&rsquo;m here, and that&rsquo;s the reason the guard&mdash;ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was almost awe and admiration in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your nerve with you!&rdquo; he said softly.</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan chuckled in his wheezy way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; he said complacently. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why we
  win. You get the lay, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; He was whispering now. &ldquo;You
  can&rsquo;t get that cash <i>alone</i>, Dave. I&rsquo;m telling you straight
  they won&rsquo;t let you. But they won&rsquo;t watch <i>me!</i> You know
  me, Dave. I&rsquo;ll make it a fair split&mdash;fifty-fifty. Tell me where
  the money is, and I&rsquo;ll get it, and be waiting for you anywhere you
  say when you come out; and I&rsquo;ll fix it to hand over your share so&rsquo;s
  they&rsquo;ll never know you got it&mdash;I got to make sure it&rsquo;s fixed
  like that for my own sake, you can see that. Get me, Dave? And I go out of
  here now and tell the warden it ain&rsquo;t any good, that I can&rsquo;t
  get you to talk. I guess that looks nifty enough, don&rsquo;t it, Dave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a fly climbing up the wire netting. It zigzagged its course over
  the little squares. It was a good gamble whether, on reaching the next strand,
  it would turn to the right or left, or continue straight ahead. Dave Henderson
  watched it. The creature did no one of those things. It paused and frictioned
  its front legs together in a leisurely fashion. After that it appeared to
  be quite satisfied with its position&mdash;and it stayed there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Bookie!&rdquo; murmured Dave Henderson. &ldquo;Sad, too! I guess
  it must be softening of the brain!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s face blotched suddenly red&mdash;but he pressed his
  face still more earnestly against the wire barrier.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get it!&rdquo; he breathed hoarsely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  giving you a straight tip. Barjan&rsquo;s waiting for you. The police are
  waiting for you. You haven&rsquo;t got a hope. I tell you, you can&rsquo;t
  get that money alone, no matter where you put it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard you,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson indifferently.</p>
  <p>There was silence for a moment.</p>
  <p>A sort of anxious exasperation spread over Skarvan&rsquo;s face, then perplexity,
  and then a flare of rage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fool!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t believe
  me! You think I&rsquo;m trying to work you for half of that money. Well,
  so I am, in a way&mdash;or I wouldn&rsquo;t have come here. But I&rsquo;m
  earning it. Look at the risk I&rsquo;m taking&mdash;five years, the same
  as you got. You crazy fool! Do you think I&rsquo;m bluffing? I tell you again,
  I know what I&rsquo;m talking about. The police&rsquo;ll never give you a
  look-in. You got to have help. Who else is there but me? It&rsquo;s better
  to split with me than lose the whole of it, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t changed a bit in five years, Bookie.&rdquo; There
  was studied insolence in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s voice now. &ldquo;Not a damned
  bit! Run along now&mdash;beat it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean that?&rdquo; Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s eyes were puckered into
  slits now. &ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;re going to turn me down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you one more chance,&rdquo; whispered Skarvan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>No!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s fat fingers squirmed around inside his collar as
  though it choked him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; His lips were twitching angrily. &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he
  repeated ominously. &ldquo;Then, by God, <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> never get the
  money&mdash;even if you beat the police! Understand? I&rsquo;ll see to that!
  I made you a fair, straight offer. You&rsquo;ll find now that there&rsquo;ll
  be some one else besides you and Barjan out for that coin&mdash;and when
  the showdown comes it won&rsquo;t be either you or Barjan that gets it! And
  maybe you think that&rsquo;s a bluff, too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never said I knew where the money was,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson&mdash;and
  smiled&mdash;and shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Therefore you ought to stand
  just as good a chance as Barjan&mdash;or I. After I got wounded I kind of
  lost track of things, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; said Skarvan fiercely. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; He
  checked himself, biting at his lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you one more
  chance again. What&rsquo;s your last word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it, Bookie,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson evenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then take mine!&rdquo; Skarvan rasped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go now and
  tell the warden you wouldn&rsquo;t say anything. If you try to put a crimp
  in me by reporting my offer, I&rsquo;ll say you lied. I don&rsquo;t mind
  taking chances on my word being believed against the word of a convict and
  a thief who is known to be playing tricky! You get that? And after that&mdash;God
  help you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man was gone....</p>
  <p>Presently, Dave Henderson found himself back in the carpenter shop. The
  band-saw was shrieking, screeching insanely again. He had smiled in there
  in the visitor&rsquo;s room at Bookie Skarvan; he had even been debonair
  and facetious&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t that way now. He could mask his face
  from others; he couldn&rsquo;t mask his soul from himself. It seemed as though
  his courage were being drained away from him, and in its place were coming
  a sense of final, crushing defeat. Barjan&rsquo;s blow of last night had
  sent him groggy to the ropes; but the blow Bookie Skarvan had just dealt
  had smashed in under his guard and had landed on an even more vital spot.</p>
  <p>Skarvan&rsquo;s veiled threat hadn&rsquo;t veiled anything. The veil was
  only too transparent! &ldquo;God help you!&rdquo; meant a lot. It meant that,
  far more dangerous to face, even more difficult to outwit than the police,
  there was now to be aligned against him the criminal element of San Francisco.
  It meant Baldy Vickers and Runty Mott, and Baldy Vickers&rsquo; gang. It
  meant the men who had already attempted to murder him, and who would be eager
  enough to repeat that attempt for the same stake&mdash;one hundred thousand
  dollars. With the police it would have been, more than anything else, the
  simple thrust and parry of wits; now, added to that, was a physical, brutish
  force whose danger only a fool would strive to minimize. There were dives
  and dens in the underworld there, as he knew well enough, where a man would
  disappear from the light of day forever, and where tortures that would put
  the devil&rsquo;s ingenuity to shame could be applied to make a man open
  his lips. He was not exaggerating! It was literally true. And if he were
  once trapped he could expect no less than that. They had already tried to
  murder him once! Naturally, they had entered into his calculations before
  while he had been here in prison; but they had not seemed to be a very vital
  factor. He had never figured on Bookie Skarvan setting that machinery in
  motion again&mdash;he had only figured on getting his own hands on Bookie
  Skarvan himself. But he saw it now; and he realized that, once started again,
  they would stop at nothing to get that money. Whether Bookie Skarvan would
  have abided by his offer, on the basis that he would get more out of it for
  himself that way, or whether it was simply a play to discover the whereabouts
  of the money and then divide up with his old accomplices, did not matter;
  it was certain now that Bookie Skarvan would be content with less rather
  than with none, and that the underworld would be unleashed on his, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s,
  trail. The police&mdash;and now the underworld! It was like a pack of wolves
  and a pack of hounds in chase from converging directions after the same quarry;
  the wolves and the hounds might clash together, and fall upon one another&mdash;but
  the quarry would be mangled and crushed in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.</p>
  <p>The afternoon wore on. At times Dave Henderson&rsquo;s hands clenched over
  his tools until it seemed the tendons must snap and break with the strain;
  at times the sweat of agony oozed out in drops upon his forehead. Bookie
  Skarvan was right. He could not get that money <i>alone</i>. No! No, that
  was wrong! He could get it alone, and he would get it, and then fight for
  it, and go under for it, all hell would not hold him back from that, and
  Bookie Skarvan and some of the others would go under too&mdash;but he could
  not get <i>away</i> with the money alone. And that meant that these five
  years of prison, five years of degradation, of memories that nauseated him,
  five years that he had wagered out of his life, had gone for nothing! God,
  if he could only turn to some one for help! But there was no one, not a soul
  on earth, not a friend in the world who could aid him&mdash;except Millman.</p>
  <p>And he <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> ask Millman&mdash;because it wouldn&rsquo;t
  be fair to Millman.</p>
  <p>His face must have grown haggard, perhaps he was acting strangely. Old Tony
  over there had been casting anxious glances in his direction. He took a grip
  upon himself, and smiled at the old bomb-thrower. The old Italian looked
  pretty bad himself&mdash;that pasty whiteness about the old fellow&rsquo;s
  face had a nasty appearance.</p>
  <p>His mind went back to Millman, working in queer, disconnected snatches of
  thought. He was going to lose Millman, too... Millman was going out tomorrow....
  It had always been a relief to talk to Millman.... He had never told Millman
  where the money was, of course, but Millman knew what he, Dave Henderson,
  was &ldquo;in&rdquo; for.... The library hour wasn&rsquo;t far off, and it
  would help to talk to Millman now.... Only Millman was going out to-morrow&mdash;?
  and he was to bid Millman good-by.</p>
  <p>This seemed somehow the crowning jeer of mockery that fate was flinging
  at him&mdash;that to-morrow even Millman would be gone. It seemed to bring
  a snarl into his soul, the snarl as of some gaunt, starving beast at bay,
  the snarl of desperation flung out in bitter, reckless defiance.</p>
  <p>He put his hands to his face, and beneath them his jaws clamped and locked.
  They would never beat him, he would go under first, but&mdash;but&mdash;</p>
  <p>Time passed. The routine of the prison life went on like the turning of
  some great, ponderous wheel that moved very slowly, but at the same time
  with a sort of smooth, oiled immutability. It seemed that way to Dave Henderson.
  He was conscious of no definite details that marked or occupied the passage
  of time. The library hour had come. He was on his way to the library now&mdash;with
  permission to get a book. He did not want a book. He was going to see Millman,
  and, God knew, he did not want to see Millman&mdash;to say good-by.</p>
  <p>Mind, body and soul were sick&mdash;sick with the struggle of the afternoon,
  sick with the ceaseless mental torment that made his temples throb and brought
  excruciating pain, and with the pain brought almost physical nausea; sick
  with the realization that his recompense for the five years of freedom he
  had sacrificed was only&mdash;wreckage, ruin and disaster.</p>
  <p>He entered the little room. A guard lounged negligently against the wall.
  One of the two convict librarians was already busy with another convict&mdash;but
  it wasn&rsquo;t Millman who was busy. He met Millman&rsquo;s cool, steady,
  gray eyes, read a sudden, startled something in them, and moved down to the
  end of the sort of wooden counter away from the guard&mdash;and handed in
  his book to be exchanged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Dave?&rdquo; Millman, across the counter,
  back half turned to the guard, spoke in a low, hurried voice, as he pretended
  to examine the book. &ldquo;I never saw you look like this before! Are you
  sick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson between his teeth. &ldquo;Sick&mdash;as
  hell! I&rsquo;m up against it, Charlie! And I guess it&rsquo;s all over except
  for one last little fight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What book do you want?&rdquo; said Millman&rsquo;s voice coolly;
  but Millman&rsquo;s clean-cut face with its strong jaw tightening a little,
  and Millman&rsquo;s clear gray eyes with a touch of steel creeping into them,
  said: &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police!&rdquo; Dave Henderson spoke through the corner of his
  mouth without motion of the lips. &ldquo;Barjan was here last night. And
  I got another tip to-day. The screws are going on&mdash;to a finish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean they&rsquo;re going to see that you don&rsquo;t get that
  money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson nodded curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not give it up then, Dave, and start a clean sheet?&rdquo; asked
  Millman softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give it up!&rdquo; The red had come into Dave Henderson&rsquo;s face,
  there was a savage tightening of his lips across his teeth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  never give it up! D&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;ve rotted here five years only
  to <i>crawl</i> at the end? By God! No! I&rsquo;ll get it&mdash;if they get
  me doing it!&rdquo; His hoarse whisper caught and choked suddenly. &ldquo;But
  it&rsquo;s hell, Charlie&mdash;hell! Hell to go under like that, just because
  there isn&rsquo;t a soul on God&rsquo;s wide earth I can trust to get it
  for me while they&rsquo;re watching me!&rdquo; Millman turned away, and
  walked to the racks of books at the rear of the room.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson watched the other in a numbed sort of way. It was a curious
  kind of good-by he was saying to Millman. He wasn&rsquo;t quite sure, for
  that matter, just what he had said. He was soul sick, and body sick. Millman
  was taking a long while over the selection of a book&mdash;and he hadn&rsquo;t
  even asked for a book, let alone for any particular one. What did it matter!
  He didn&rsquo;t want anything to read. Reading wasn&rsquo;t any good to him
  any more! Barjan and Bookie Skarvan had&mdash;</p>
  <p>Millman was leaning over the counter again, a book in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you trust <i>me</i>, Dave?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; The blood seemed to quicken, and rush in a mad, swirling
  tide through Dave Henderson&rsquo;s veins. &ldquo;Do you mean that, Charlie?
  Do you mean you&rsquo;ll help me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Millman. &ldquo;If you want to trust me, I&rsquo;ll
  get that money for you. I&rsquo;m going out to-morrow. But talk quickly!
  The guard&rsquo;s watching us and getting fidgety. Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson rubbed his upper lip with the side of his forefinger as though
  it itched; the remaining fingers, spread out fanlike, screened his mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the old pigeon-cote&mdash;shed back of Tooler&rsquo;s house where
  I used to live&mdash;you can get into the shed from the lane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman laid the book on the counter&mdash;and pushed it toward Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be looking for
  it in New York. You&rsquo;ve two months more here. Make it the twenty-fourth
  of June. That&rsquo;ll give you time enough. I&rsquo;ll be registered at
  the St. Lucian Hotel&mdash;New York&mdash;eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening&mdash;June
  twenty-fourth. I&rsquo;ll hand the money over to you there, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You there, Five-Fifty&rdquo;&mdash;the guard was moving toward them
  from across the room&mdash;&ldquo;you got your book, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson picked up the book, and turned toward the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; he flung over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; Millman answered.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  Bread Upon The Waters</b></h2>
  <p>IT was dark in the cell, quite dark. There was just the faint glimmer that
  crept in from the night lights along the iron galleries, and came up from
  the main corridor two tiers below. It must have been hours since he had left
  Millman in the prison library&mdash;and yet he was not sure. Perhaps it was
  even still early, for he hadn&rsquo;t heard old Tony talking and whispering
  to himself through the bars to-night yet.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s head, cupped in hands whose fingers dug with a brutal
  grip into the flesh of his cheeks, came upward with a jerk, and he surged
  to his feet from the hinged shelf that he called cot and bed. What difference
  did it make whether it was dark or light, or late or early, or whether old
  Tony had babbled to himself or not! It was pitifully inconsequential. It
  was only his brain staggering off into the byways again, as though, in some
  sneaking, underhand way, it wanted to steal rest and respite.</p>
  <p>His hands went up above his head, and held there, and his fists clenched.
  He was the fool of fools, the prince of fools! He saw it now! His laugh purled
  low, in hollow mirth, through the cell&mdash;a devil&rsquo;s laugh in its
  bitter irony. Yes, he saw it now&mdash;when it was too late.</p>
  <p>Millman! Damn Millman to the pit! Damn Millman for the smoothest, craftiest
  hypocrite into whom God had ever breathed the breath of life! He had been
  trapped! That had been Millman&rsquo;s play, two years of cunning play&mdash;to
  win his confidence; two years of it, that always at the end the man might
  get that hundred thousand dollars. And he had fallen into Millman&rsquo;s
  trap!</p>
  <p>He did not believe Millman&rsquo;s story, or in Millman&rsquo;s innocence
  now&mdash;when it was too late! He couldn&rsquo;t reach Millman now. There
  were bars of iron, and steel doors, and walls of stone between himself and
  Millman&rsquo;s cell; and in the morning Millman would be gone, and Millman
  would have sixty-two&mdash;no, sixty-one days&mdash;to get that money and
  put the width of the world between them before he, Dave Henderson, was free.</p>
  <p>Sixty-one days! And in the space of one short moment, wrecking all that
  the toil and agony of years was to have stood for, he had told Millman what
  Millman wanted to know! And that was the moment Millman had been waiting
  for through two long years with cunning patience&mdash;and he, Dave Henderson,
  because he was shaken to the soul with desperation, because he was alone
  with his back to the wall, in extremity, ready to grasp at any shred of hope,
  and because he was sick in body, and because the sudden, overwhelming uplift
  at Millman&rsquo;s offer had numbed and dulled his faculties in a mighty
  revulsion of relief, had fallen into the traitor&rsquo;s trap.</p>
  <p>And it had been done so quickly! The guard had been there and had intervened,
  and there hadn&rsquo;t been time for his mind to win back its normal poise
  and reason logically. He hadn&rsquo;t reasoned in that brief instant; he
  had only caught and grasped the outflung hand of one whom, for two years,
  he had trusted and believed was a friend. He hadn&rsquo;t reasoned then;
  he had even stepped out of the prison library more lighthearted than he had
  been almost from the moment they had put these striped clothes upon him five
  years before; but he had barely stood locked in his cell here again when,
  like some ghastly blight falling upon him, reason had come and left him a
  draggled weakling, scarcely able physically to stand upon his feet. And then
  that had passed, and he had been possessed of an insensate fury that had
  bade him fling himself at the cell door, and, with superhuman strength, wrench
  and tear the bars asunder that he might get at Millman again. He had checked
  that impulse amidst the jeers and mockeries of impish voices that rang in
  his ears and filled the cell with their insane jabberings&mdash;voices that
  laughed in hellish glee at him for being a fool in the first place, and for
  his utter impotence in the second.</p>
  <p>They were jeering and chuckling now, those insane demon voices!</p>
  <p>He swung from the center of the cell, and flung himself down on the cot
  again. They might well mock at him, those voices! For two years, though he
  had had faith in Millman, he had kept the secret of the hiding place of that
  money to himself because, believing Millman to be an honest man, it would
  have been unfair to Millman to have told him, since, as an honest man, Millman
  then would either have had to inform the authorities&mdash;or become a dishonest
  man. It was clear enough, wasn&rsquo;t it? And logical enough? And yet in
  one unguarded moment he had repudiated his own logic! He had based all, his
  faith and trust and confidence in Millman, on the belief that Millman was
  an honest man. Well, an <i>honest</i> man wouldn&rsquo;t voluntarily aid
  and abet a thief in getting away with stolen money, nor make himself an accomplice
  after the fact, nor offer to help outwit the police, nor agree to participate
  in what amounted to stealing the money for a second time, and so make of
  himself a criminal! And if the man was then <i>dishonest</i>, and for two
  years had covered that dishonesty with a mask of hypocrisy, it was obvious
  enough, since the hypocrisy had been solely for his, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s,
  benefit, that Millman had planned it all patiently from the beginning, and
  now meant to do him cold, to get the money and keep it.</p>
  <p>He could not remain still. He was up on his feet again from the cot. Fury
  had him in its grip once more. Five years! Five years of hell in this devil&rsquo;s
  hole! And a branded name! He had thrown everything into the balance&mdash;all
  he had! And now&mdash;<i>this!</i> Tricked! That was it&mdash;tricked! Tricked
  by a Judas!</p>
  <p>All the passion of the man was on the surface now. Lean and gaunt, his body
  seemed to crouch forward as though to spring; his hands, with fingers crooked
  like claws reaching for their prey, were outstretched before him. Sixty-one
  days&rsquo; start Millman had. But Millman would need more than that! The
  only man in the world whom he had ever trusted, and who had then betrayed
  him, would need more than sixty-one days to escape the reckoning that was
  to come. Millman might hide, Millman might live for years in lavish ease
  on that money, and in the end there might be none of that money left, but
  sooner or later Millman would pay a bigger price than&mdash;a hundred thousand
  dollars. He would get Millman. The world wasn&rsquo;t big enough for the
  two of them. And when that day came&mdash;</p>
  <p>His muscles relaxed. The paroxysm of fury left him, and suddenly he moaned
  a little as though in bitter hurt. There was another side to it. He could
  not help thinking of that other side. There had been two years of what he
  had thought was friendship&mdash;and the friendship had been hypocrisy. It
  was hard to believe. Perhaps Millman meant to play square after all, perhaps
  Millman would keep that rendezvous in New York on June twenty-fourth at eight
  o&rsquo;clock in the evening at the St. Lucian Hotel. Perhaps Millman would.
  It wasn&rsquo;t only on account of the money that he hoped Millman would&mdash;there
  were those two years of what he had thought was friendship.</p>
  <p>He leaned suddenly against the wall of the cell, the palms of his hands
  pressed against it, his face crushed into his knuckles. No! What was the
  use of that! Why try to delude himself again? Why try to make himself believe
  what he <i>wanted</i> to believe? He could reason now coolly and logically
  enough. If Millman was honest he would not do what he had offered to do;
  and being, therefore, dishonest, his apparent honesty had been only a mask,
  and the mask had been only for his, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s, benefit, and
  that, logically, could evidence but one thing&mdash;that Millman had deliberately
  set himself to win the confidence that would win for Millman the stake of
  one hundred thousand dollars. There was no other conclusion, was there?</p>
  <p>His head came up from his hands, and he stood rigid, tense. Wait! Wait a
  minute, until his brain cleared. There was another possibility. He had not
  thought of it before! It confused and staggered him now. Suppose that Millman
  stood in with the police! Suppose that the police had used Millman for just
  the purpose that Millman had accomplished! Or&mdash;why not?&mdash;suppose
  that Millman was even one of the police himself! It was not so tenable a
  theory as it was to assume that Millman had acted as a stool-pigeon; but
  it was, even at that, well within the realm of possibility. A man would not
  count two years ill spent on a case that involved the recovery of a hundred
  thousand dollars&mdash;nor hesitate to play a convict&rsquo;s part, either,
  if necessary. It had been done before. Until Barjan had come last night,
  the police had made no sign for years&mdash;unless Millman were indeed one
  of them, and, believing at the last that he was facing failure, had called
  in Barjan. Millman hadn&rsquo;t had a hard time of it in the penitentiary.
  His education had been the excuse, if it were an excuse, for all the soft
  clerical jobs. Who was to know if Millman ever spent the nights in his cell?</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson crushed his fists against his temples. What did it matter!
  In the long run, what did it matter! Crook, or informant, or an officer,
  Millman had wrecked him, and he would pay his debt to Millman! He laughed
  low again, while his teeth gnawed at his lip. There was Barjan and Bookie
  Skarvan&mdash;and now Millman! And Baldy Vickers and the underworld!</p>
  <p>There wasn&rsquo;t much chance, was there? Not much to expect now in return
  for the eternities in which he had worn these prison stripes, not much out
  of the ruin of his life, not much for the all and everything he had staked
  and risked! Not much&mdash;only to make one last fight, to make as many of
  these men pay as dearly as he could. Fight! Yes, he would fight. He had never
  hedged. He would never hedge. They had him with his back to the wall. He
  knew that. There wasn&rsquo;t much chance now; there wasn&rsquo;t any, if
  he looked the situation squarely in the face. He stood alone, absolutely
  alone; there was nowhere to turn, no single soul to turn to. His hand was
  against every other man&rsquo;s. But he was not beaten. They would never
  beat him. A knife thrust or a black-jack from Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s skulking
  pack, though it might end his life, would not beat him; a further term here
  behind these walls, though it might wither up the soul of him, would not
  beat him!</p>
  <p>And Millman! Up above his head his hands twisted and knotted together again,
  and the great muscular shoulders locked back, and the clean, straight limbs
  grew taut. And he laughed. And the laugh was very low and sinister. A beast
  cornered was an ugly thing. And the dominant instinct in a beast was self-preservation&mdash;and
  a leap at its enemy&rsquo;s throat. A beast asked no quarter&mdash;and gave
  none. He was a beast. They had made him a beast in here, an animal, a numbered
  thing, not a man; they had not even left him with a name&mdash;just one of
  a herd of beasts and animals. But they had not tamed him. He was alone, facing
  them all now, and there wasn&rsquo;t much chance because the odds were overwhelming;
  but if he was alone, he would not go <i>down</i> alone, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>He turned his head suddenly, and his hands dropped to his sides. There had
  come a cry from somewhere. It was not very loud, but it rang in a startling
  way through the night silence of the prison. It was a cry as of sudden fear
  and weakness. It came again; and in a bound Dave Henderson reached the bars
  of his door, and beat upon them furiously with his fists. He would get into
  trouble for it undoubtedly, but he had placed that cry now. Old Tony wasn&rsquo;t
  whispering tonight. There was something wrong with the old bomb-thrower.
  Yes, he remembered&mdash;old Tony&rsquo;s strange appearance that afternoon.
  He rattled again and again on the bars. Old Tony was moaning now.</p>
  <p>Footsteps on the run sounded along the iron gallery. A guard passed by;
  another paused at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get back out of there!&rdquo; growled the guard. &ldquo;Beat it!
  Get back to your cot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson retreated to the center of the cell. He heard old Tony&rsquo;s
  door opened. Then muffled voices. And then a voice that was quite audible&mdash;one
  of the guard&rsquo;s:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s snuffed out. Get the doc&mdash;and, yes, tell
  the warden, if he hasn&rsquo;t gone to bed yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Snuffed out! There was a queer, choking sensation in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s
  throat. A guard ran along the gallery. Dave Henderson edged silently close
  up to the door of his cell again. He couldn&rsquo;t see very much&mdash;only
  a gleam of light from Lomazzi&rsquo;s cell that fell on the iron plates of
  the gallery. There was no sound from within the other cell now.</p>
  <p>Snuffed out! The thought that old Tony was dead affected him in a numbed,
  groping sort of way. It had come with such startling suddenness! He had not
  grasped it yet. He wondered whether he should be sorry or glad for old Tony&mdash;death
  was the lifer&rsquo;s goal. He did not know. It brought, though, a great
  aching into his own soul. It seemed to stamp with the ultimate to-night the
  immeasurable void in his own life. Old Tony was the last link between himself
  and that thing of priceless worth that men called friendship. Millman had
  denied it, outraged it, betrayed it; and now old Tony had swerved in his
  allegiance, and turned away at the call of a greater friend. Yes, death could
  not be anything but a friend to Tony. There seemed to be no longer any doubt
  of that in his mind.</p>
  <p>Footsteps, several of them, came again along the iron gallery, racketing
  through the night, but they did not pass his cell this time; they came from
  the other direction, and went into Lomazzi&rsquo;s cell. It was strange that
  this should have happened to-night! There would be no more shoulder-touch
  in the lock-step for the few days that were left; no smile of eyes and lips
  across the carpenter shop; no surreptitious, intimate little gestures of
  open-hearted companionship! It seemed to crown in an appalling way, to bring
  home to him now with a new and appalling force what, five minutes ago, he
  had thought he had already appreciated to its fullest and bitterest depths&mdash;loneliness.
  He was alone&mdash;alone&mdash;alone.</p>
  <p>The murmur of voices came from the other cell. Time passed. He clung there
  to the bars. Alone&mdash;without help! The presence of death seemed to have
  infused itself into, and to have become synonymous with that thought. It
  seemed insidiously to eat into his soul and being, to make his mind sick
  and weary, whispering to him to capitulate because he was alone, ringed about
  with forces that would inevitably overwhelm his puny single-handed defiance&mdash;because
  he was alone&mdash;and it would be hopeless to go further alone&mdash;without
  help.</p>
  <p>He drew back suddenly from the door, conscious for the first time that he
  must have been clutching and straining at the bars with all his strength.
  His fingers, relaxed now, were stiff, and the circulation seemed to have
  left them. A guard was opening the door. Behind the guard, that white-haired
  man was the warden. He had always liked the warden. The man was stern, but
  he was always just. He did not understand why the warden had come to his
  cell.</p>
  <p>It was the warden who spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lomazzi is dying. He has begged to be allowed to say good-by to you.
  I can see no objection. You may come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson moistened his lips with the tip of his tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought I heard them say he was dead,&rdquo; he mumbled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was unconscious,&rdquo; answered the warden briefly. &ldquo;A
  heart attack. Step quickly; he has not many minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson stepped out on the iron gallery; and paused an instant before
  the door of the adjoining cell. A form lay on the cot, a form with a pasty-colored
  face, a form whose eyes were closed. The prison doctor, a hypodermic syringe
  still in his hand, stood a little to one side. Dave Henderson swept his hand
  across his eyes&mdash;there was a sudden mist there that blurred the scene&mdash;and,
  moving forward, dropped down on his knees beside the cot.</p>
  <p>A hand reached out and grasped his feebly; the dark eyes opened and fixed
  on him with a flicker of the old fire in their depths; and the lips quivered
  in a smile.</p>
  <p>Old Tony was whispering&mdash;old Tony always talked and whispered to himself
  here in his cell every night&mdash;but old Tony never disturbed anybody&mdash;it
  was hard to hear old Tony even when one listened attentively. Dave Henderson
  brushed his hand across his eyes again, and bent his head to the other&rsquo;s
  lips to catch the words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You make-a da fool play when you come in here, Dave&mdash;for me.
  But I never, never forget. Old Tony no forget. You no make-a da fool play
  when you go out. Old Tony knows. You need-a da help. Listen&mdash;Nicolo
  Capriano&mdash;&rsquo;Frisco. You understand? Tony Lomazzi send-a you. Tony
  Lomazzi take-a da life prison for Nicolo. Nicolo will pay back to Tony&rsquo;s
  friend. You did not think that&rdquo;&mdash;the voice was growing feebler,
  harder to understand, and it was fluttering now&mdash;&ldquo;that, because
  old Tony call-a you da fool, he did&mdash;did not&mdash;remember&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some one disengaged Dave Henderson&rsquo;s hand from the hand that was clasped
  around it, and that had suddenly twitched and, with a spasmodic clutch, had
  seemed as though striving to maintain its hold.</p>
  <p>The prison doctor&rsquo;s voice sounded muffled in the cell:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson looked up at the touch of a guard&rsquo;s hand on his shoulder.
  The guard jerked his head with curt significance in the direction of the
  door.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  The Door On The Lane</b></h2>
  <p>WAS that a shadow cast by the projection of the door porch out there across
  the street, or was it <i>more</i> than a shadow? It was true that, to a remarkable
  degree, one&rsquo;s eyes became accustomed to the murk, almost akin to blackness,
  of the ill-lighted street; but the mind did not accommodate itself so readily&mdash;a
  long and sustained vigil, the brain spurred into abnormal activity and under
  tense strain, produced a mental quality of vision that detracted from, rather
  than augmented, the dependence to be placed upon the physical organs of sight.
  It peopled space with its own imaginations; it created, rather than descried.
  Dave Henderson shook his head in grim uncertainty. He could not be sure what
  it was out there. With the black background of the unlighted room behind
  him he could not be seen at the window by any one on the street, which was
  two stories below, and he had been watching here since it had grown dark.
  In that time he had seen a dozen shadows that he could have sworn were not
  shadows&mdash;and yet they were no more than that after all. He was only
  sure of one thing&mdash;that out there somewhere, perhaps nowhere within
  eye range of his window, perhaps even half a block away, but somewhere, some
  one was watching. He had been sure of that during every hour of his new-found
  freedom, since he had reached &rsquo;Frisco that noon. He had been sure of
  it intuitively; but he had failed signally to identify any one specifically
  as having dogged or followed him.</p>
  <p>Freedom! He laughed a little harshly. There weren&rsquo;t any stone walls
  any more; this window in front of him wasn&rsquo;t grated, nor the door of
  the room steel-barred, nor out there in the corridor was there any uniformed
  guard&mdash;and so it was freedom.</p>
  <p>The short, harsh laugh was on his lips again. Freedom! It was a curious
  freedom, then! He could walk at will out there in the streets&mdash;within
  limits. But he did not dare go yet to that shed where Mrs. Tooler&rsquo;s
  old pigeon-cote was. The money probably wasn&rsquo;t there anyhow&mdash;Millman
  almost certainly had won the first trick and had got away with it; but it
  was absolutely necessary that he should be sure.</p>
  <p>He had freedom; but he had dared go nowhere to procure a steel jimmy, for
  instance, or a substitute for a steel jimmy, with which to force that shed
  door; nor had he dared to go anywhere and buy a revolver with which to arm
  himself, and of which he stood desperately in need. He had only a few dollars,
  but he knew where, under ordinary circumstances, he could obtain those things
  without any immediate outlay of money&mdash;only it was a moral certainty
  that every move he made was watched. If he procured, say, a chisel, if he
  procured, say, a revolver, he was not fool enough to imagine such facts would
  be hidden long from those who watched. They would be suspicious facts. It
  was his play now to create no suspicion. He could make no move until he had
  definitely and conclusively identified and placed those who were watching
  him; and then, with that point settled, it should not be very hard to throw
  the watchers off the track long enough to enable him to visit Mrs. Tooler&rsquo;s
  pigeon-cote, and, far more important, his one vital objective now, old Tony
  Lomazzi&rsquo;s friend&mdash;Capriano.</p>
  <p>His jaws locked. He meant to force that issue tonight, even if he could
  not discriminate between shadows and realities out there through the window!
  He had a definite plan worked out in his mind&mdash;including a visit to
  Square John Kelly&rsquo;s. He hadn&rsquo;t been to Square John&rsquo;s yet.
  To have gone there immediately on reaching San Francisco would have been
  a fool play. It would have been, not only risky for himself, but risky for
  Square John; and he had to protect Square John from the searching and pertinent
  questions that would then have certainly ensued. He was going there to-night,
  casually, as simply to one of many similar places&mdash;that was part of
  his plan!</p>
  <p>And now he smiled in mingled bitterness and menace. The underworld had complimented
  him once on being the possessor of potentialities that could make of him
  the slickest crook in the United States. He had not forgotten that. The underworld,
  or at least a section of it in the persons of Baldy Vickers and his gang,
  was leagued against him now, as well as the police. He would strive to merit
  the underworld&rsquo;s encomium!</p>
  <p>He turned suddenly away from the window, walked in the darkness to the table
  in the center of the room, and, groping for his hat, made his way to the
  door. He had not expected much from this vigil at the window, but there had
  always been the possibility that it would be productive, and the earlier
  hours of the evening could have been employed in no better way. It was dark
  enough now to begin his night&rsquo;s work in earnest. It must be between
  half-past nine and ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>There was a dim light in the corridor, but, dim though it was, it did not
  hide the ragged, threadbare state of the carpet on the hallway and stairs,
  nor the lack of paint, or even of soap and water, on doors and woodwork.
  Pelatt&rsquo;s Hotel made no pretentious claims. It was as shabby as the
  shabby quarter in which it was located, and as shabby as the shabby patrons
  to whom it catered. But there were not many places where a man with close-cropped
  hair and wearing black clothes of blatant prison cut could go, and he had
  known Pelatt in the old days, and Pelatt, in lieu of baggage, hadn&rsquo;t
  demanded any cash in advance&mdash;he had even advanced Dave Henderson a
  little cash himself.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson reached the ground floor, and gained the street through a
  small, dingy office that was for the moment deserted. He paused here for
  an instant, the temptation strong upon him to cross the street and plunge
  into those shadows at the side of that porch just opposite to him. His lips
  grew tight. The temptation was strong, almost overpoweringly strong. He would
  much rather fight that way!</p>
  <p>And then he shrugged his shoulders, and started along the street. Since
  he had left the penitentiary, he had not given the slightest sign that he
  had even a suspicion he was being watched; and, more than ever, he could
  not afford to do so now. There were two who could play at the game of laying
  traps! And, besides, the chances were a thousand to one that there were nothing
  but shadows over there; and there were the same odds that some one who was
  not a shadow would see him make the tell-tale investigation. He could not
  afford to take a chance. He could not afford to fail now. He had to identify
  beyond question of doubt the man, or men, who were on his trail, if there
  were any; or, with equal certainty, establish it as a fact that he was letting
  what he called his intuition run away with him.</p>
  <p>There came a grim smile to his lips, as he went along. Intuition wasn&rsquo;t
  all he had to guide him, was it? Barjan had not minced words in making it
  clear that he would be watched; and Bookie Skarvan had made an even more
  ominous threat! Who was it tonight, then&mdash;the police, or the underworld,
  or both?</p>
  <p>He had given no sign that he had any suspicions. He had gone to Pelatt&rsquo;s
  openly; after that, in an apparently aimless way, as a man almost childishly
  interested in the most trivial things after five years of imprisonment, he
  had roamed about the streets that afternoon.</p>
  <p>But his wanderings had not been entirely aimless! He had located Nicolo
  Capriano&rsquo;s house&mdash;and, strangely enough, his wanderings had quite
  inadvertently taken him past that house several times! It was in a shabby
  quarter of the city, too. Also, it was a curious sort of house; that is,
  it was a curious sort of house when compared with its neighbors. It was one
  of a row of frame houses in none too good repair, and it was the second house
  from the corner&mdash;the directory had supplied him with the street and
  number. The front of the house differed in no respect from those on each
  side of it; it was the rear that had particularly excited his attention.
  He had not been able to investigate it closely, of course, but it bordered
  on a lane, and by walking down the cross street one could see it. It had
  an extension built on that reached almost to the high fence at the edge of
  the lane, and the extension, weather-beaten in appearance, looked to be almost
  as old as the house itself. Not so very curious, after all, except that no
  other house had that extension&mdash;and except that, in view of the fact
  that one Nicolo Capriano lived there, it was at least suggestive. Its back
  entrance was extremely easy of access!</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson turned abruptly in through the door of a saloon, and, leaning
  against the bar&mdash;well down at the far end where he could both see and
  be seen every time the door was opened&mdash;ordered a drink.</p>
  <p>He had thought a good deal about Nicolo Capriano in the two months since
  old Tony Lomazzi had ended his life sentence. He hadn&rsquo;t &ldquo;got&rdquo; it
  all at the moment when the old bomb-thrower had died. It had been mostly
  old Tony himself who was in his thoughts then, and the reference to Capriano
  had seemed no more than just a kindly thought on old Tony&rsquo;s part for
  a friend who had no other friend on earth. But afterwards, and not many hours
  afterwards, it had all taken on a vastly different perspective. The full
  significance of Tony&rsquo;s words had come to him, and this in turn had
  stirred his memories of earlier days in San Francisco; and he remembered
  Nicolo Capriano.</p>
  <p>The barkeeper slid a bottle and whisky glass toward him. Dave Henderson
  half turned his back to the street door, resting his elbow negligently on
  the bar. He waited for a moment until the barkeeper&rsquo;s attention was
  somewhat diverted, then his fingers cupped around the small glass, completely
  hiding it; and the bottle, as he raised it in the other hand, was hidden
  from the door by the broad of his back. He poured out a few drops&mdash;sufficient
  to rob the glass of its cleanness. The barkeeper looked around. Dave Henderson
  hastily set the bottle down, like a child caught in a misdemeanor, hastily
  raised the glass to his lips, threw back his head, and gulped. The barkeeper
  scowled. It was the trick of the saloon vulture&mdash;not only a full glass,
  but a little over for good measure, when, through practice, the forefinger
  and thumb became a sort of annex to the rim. Dave Henderson stared back in
  sullen defiance, set the glass down on the bar, drew the back of his hand
  across his lips&mdash;and went out.</p>
  <p>He hesitated a moment outside the saloon, as though undecided which way
  to go next, while his eyes, under the brim of his slouch hat, which was pulled
  forward almost to the bridge of his nose, scanned both sides of the street
  and in both directions. He moved on again along the block.</p>
  <p>Yes, he remembered Nicolo Capriano. Capriano must be a pretty old man now&mdash;as
  old as Tony Lomazzi.</p>
  <p>There had been a great deal of talk about a gang of Italian black-handers
  in those days, when he, Dave Henderson, was a boy, and Capriano had been
  a sort of hero-bandit, he remembered; and there had been a mysterious society,
  and bomb-throwing, and a reign of terror carried on that had paralyzed the
  police. They had never been able to convict Nicolo Capriano, though it was
  common knowledge that the police believed him to be the brains and front
  of the organization. Always something, or some one, had stood between Capriano
  and prison bars&mdash;like Tony Lomazzi, for instance!</p>
  <p>He did not remember Lomazzi&rsquo;s trial, nor the details of the particular
  crime for which Lomazzi was convicted; but that, perhaps, had put an end
  to the gang&rsquo;s work. Certainly, Capriano&rsquo;s activities were a thing
  of the past; it was all a matter of years ago. Capriano was never heard of
  now; but even if the man through force of circumstances, was obliged to live
  a retired existence, that in no way robbed him of his cleverness, nor made
  him less valuable as a prospective ally.</p>
  <p>Capriano was the one man who could help him. Capriano must still possess
  underground channels that would be of incalculable value in aiding him to
  track Millman down.</p>
  <p>His fists, hidden in the side pockets of his coat, clenched fiercely. That
  was it&mdash;Millman! There wasn&rsquo;t a chance but that Millman had taken
  the money from the pigeon-cote. He would see, of course, before many more
  hours; but there wasn&rsquo;t a chance. It was Millman he wanted now. The
  possibility that had occurred to him in prison of Millman being a stool-pigeon,
  or even one of the police, no longer held water, for if the money had been
  recovered it would be publicly known. It hadn&rsquo;t been recovered. Therefore,
  it was Millman he must find, and it was Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s help he wanted.
  But he must protect Capriano. He would owe Capriano that&mdash;that it should
  not be known there was anything between Nicolo Capriano and Dave Henderson.
  Well, he was doing that now, wasn&rsquo;t he? Neither Square John Kelly nor
  Nicolo Capriano would in any way be placed under suspicion through his visits
  to them to-night!</p>
  <p>The saloons appeared to be Dave Henderson&rsquo;s sole attraction in life
  now. He went from one to another, and he passed none by, and he went nowhere
  else&mdash;and he left a trail of barkeepers&rsquo; scowls behind him. One
  drink in each place, with five fingers curled around the glass, hiding the
  few drops the glass actually contained, while it proclaimed to the barkeeper
  the gluttonous and greedy imposition of the professional bum, wore out his
  welcome as a customer; and if the resultant scowl from behind the bar was
  not suggestive enough, it was augmented by an uncompromising request to &ldquo;beat
  it!&rdquo; He appeared to be possessed of an earnest determination to make
  a night of it&mdash;and also of an equally earnest determination to get as
  much liquor for as little money as possible. And the record he left behind
  him bore unimpeachable testimony to that purpose!</p>
  <p>He appeared to grow a little unsteady on his feet; he was even lurching
  quite noticeably when, an hour later, the lighted windows of Square John
  Kelly&rsquo;s Pacific Coral Saloon, his first real objective, flung an inviting
  ray across his path. He stood still here full in the light, both of the window
  and a street lamp, and shook his head in well-simulated grave and dubious
  inebriety. He began to fumble in his pockets. He fished out a dime from one,
  and a nickel from another&mdash;a further and still more industrious search
  apparently proved abortive. For a long time he appeared to be absorbed in
  a lugubrious contemplation of the two coins that lay in the palm of his hand&mdash;but
  under his hat brim his eyes marked a man in a brown peaked cap who was approaching
  the door of the saloon. This was the second time in the course of the last
  half hour&mdash;since he had begun to show signs that the whisky was getting
  the better of him&mdash;that he had seen the man in the brown peaked cap!</p>
  <p>There were swinging wicker doors to the saloon, and the man pushed these
  open, and went in&mdash;but he did not go far. Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips
  thinned grimly. The bottom of the swinging doors was a good foot and a half
  above the level of the sidewalk&mdash;but, being so far gone in liquor, he
  would hardly be expected to notice the fact that the man&rsquo;s boots remained
  visible, and that the man was standing there motionless!</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson took the street lamp into his confidence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ol&rsquo; Kelly,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson thickly. &ldquo;Uster
  know Kelly&mdash;Square John. Gotta have money. Whatsh matter with touching
  Kelly? Eh&mdash;whatsh matter with that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He lurched toward the swinging doors. The boots retreated suddenly. He pushed
  his way through, and stood surveying the old-time familiar surroundings owlishly.
  The man with the brown cap was leaning against the bar close to the door;
  a half dozen others were ranged farther down along its length; and at its
  lower end, lounging against the wall of the little private office, was a
  squat, paunchy man with a bald head, and florid face, and keen gray eyes
  under enormously bushy gray eyebrows. It was Kelly, just as Kelly used to
  be&mdash;even to the massive gold watch chain stretched across the vest,
  with the massive gold fraternity emblem dangling down from the center.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ello, Kelly!&rdquo; Dave Henderson called out effusively,
  and made rapid, though somewhat erratic progress across the room to Kelly&rsquo;s
  side. &ldquo;Glad t&rsquo;see you, ol&rsquo; boy!&rdquo; He gave Kelly no
  chance to say anything. He caught Kelly&rsquo;s hand, and pumped it up and
  down. &ldquo;Sure, you know me! Dave Henderson&mdash;ol&rsquo; days at the
  track, eh? Been away on a vacation. Come back&mdash;broke.&rdquo; His voice
  took on a drunkenly confidential tone&mdash;that could be heard everywhere
  in the saloon, &ldquo;Shay, could I see you a minute in private?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A man at the bar laughed. Dave Henderson wheeled belligerently. Kelly intervened.</p>
  <p>Perplexity, mingling with surprise and disapproval, stamped Kelly&rsquo;s
  florid face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you well enough; but I didn&rsquo;t expect to see you
  like this, Dave!&rdquo; he said shortly. He jerked his hand toward the door
  of the private office. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to you in there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson entered the office.</p>
  <p>Kelly shut the door behind them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re drunk!&rdquo; he said sternly.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m followed. Do you think
  I&rsquo;m a fool, John? Did you ever see me drunk? They&rsquo;re shadowing
  me, that&rsquo;s all; and I had to get my money from you, and keep your skirts
  clean, and spot the shadow, all at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kelly&rsquo;s jaw sagged helplessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he ejaculated heavily. &ldquo;Dave, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk, John&mdash;now,&rdquo; Dave Henderson
  interrupted. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t time. It won&rsquo;t do for me to stay
  in here too long. You&rsquo;ve got my money ready, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kelly nodded&mdash;still a little helplessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s ready. I&rsquo;ve been looking
  for you all afternoon. I knew you were coming out today.&rdquo; He went over
  to a safe in the corner, opened it, took out a long envelope, and handed
  the envelope to Dave Henderson. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all there, Dave&mdash;and
  five years&rsquo; interest, compounded. A little over four thousand dollars&mdash;four
  thousand and fifteen, as near as I could figure it. It&rsquo;s all in five-hundreds
  and hundreds, except the fifteen; I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d want to
  pack a big wad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good old Square John!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson softly. He opened
  the envelope, took out the fifteen dollars, shoved the large bills into his
  pocket, tucked a five-dollar bill into another pocket, and held out the remaining
  ten to Kelly. &ldquo;Go out there and get me ten dollars from the cash register,
  John, will you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let them see you doing it. Get the
  idea? I&rsquo;d like them to know you came across, and that I&rsquo;ve got
  something to spend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kelly&rsquo;s eyes puckered in an anxious way, as they scrutinized Dave
  Henderson&rsquo;s face; but the anxiety, it was obvious enough, was all for
  Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean there&rsquo;s some one out there now?&rdquo; he asked, as
  he moved toward the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson, with a grim little smile. &ldquo;See
  if you know that fellow with the brown peaked cap up at the front end of
  the bar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kelly was gone a matter of two or three minutes. He came back and returned
  the ten dollars to Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Know the man?&rdquo; asked Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kelly. &ldquo;His name&rsquo;s Speen&mdash;he&rsquo;s
  a plain-clothesman.&rdquo; He shook his head in a troubled way, and suddenly
  laid both hands on Dave Henderson&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;Dave, what are
  you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson laughed shortly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you want to know?&rdquo; He flung out the words in a sort of bitter
  gibe. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you&mdash;in confidence. I&rsquo;m going
  to blow the head off a <i>friend</i> of mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson felt the hands on his shoulders tighten.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use, Dave?&rdquo; said Square John Kelly quietly. &ldquo;I
  suppose it has something to do with that Tydeman wad; but what&rsquo;s the
  use? You&rsquo;ve got four thousand dollars. Why not start clean again? The
  other don&rsquo;t pay, Dave, and&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s face had hardened like flint.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said evenly. &ldquo;And
  I guess the less you know the safer you&rsquo;ll be. I owe you a lot, John;
  and the only way I can square it now is to tell you to stand from under.
  What you say, though I know you mean it, doesn&rsquo;t make any dint in five
  years of hell. I&rsquo;ve got a debt to pay, and I&rsquo;m going to pay it.
  Maybe I&rsquo;ll see you again&mdash;maybe I won&rsquo;t. But even a prison
  bird can say God bless you, and mean it; and that&rsquo;s what I say to you.
  They won&rsquo;t have any suspicions that there&rsquo;s anything of any kind
  between you and me; but they&rsquo;ll naturally come here to see if they
  can get any information, when that fellow Speen out there turns in his report.
  You can tell them you advised me to start clean again, and you can tell them
  that I swear I don&rsquo;t know where that hundred thousand dollars is. They
  won&rsquo;t believe it, and you don&rsquo;t believe it. But let it go at
  that! I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to break loose, but you stand
  from under, John. I&rsquo;m going now&mdash;to get acquainted with Mr. Speen.
  It wouldn&rsquo;t look just right, in my supposed condition, for you to let
  me have another drink in your place, after having staked me; but I&rsquo;ve
  got to make at least a bluff at it. You stay here for a few minutes&mdash;and
  then come out and chase me home.&rdquo; He held out his hand, wrung Square
  John Kelly&rsquo;s in a hard grip, turned abruptly away&mdash;and staggered
  out into the barroom.</p>
  <p>Clutching his ten dollars in his hand, and glancing furtively back over
  his shoulder every step or two, Dave Henderson neared the door. Here, apparently
  reassured that his benefactor was not watching him, and apparently succumbing
  to an irresistible temptation, he sidled up to the bar&mdash;beside the man
  with the brown peaked cap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kelly&rsquo;s all right&mdash;s&rsquo;il right,&rdquo; he confided
  thickly to the other. &ldquo;Ol&rsquo; friend. Never turns down ol&rsquo; friend
  in hard luck. Square John&mdash;betcher life! Have a drink?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said the man in the brown peaked cap.</p>
  <p>The drink was ordered, and as Dave Henderson, talking garrulously, poured
  out his whisky&mdash;a genuine glassful this time&mdash;he caught sight,
  in the mirror behind the bar, and out of the corner of his eye, of Kelly
  advancing down the room from the private office. And as he lifted his glass,
  Kelly&rsquo;s hand, reaching from behind, caught the glass, and set it back
  on the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You promised me you&rsquo;d go home, and cut this out!&rdquo; said
  Kelly in sharp reproof. &ldquo;Now, go on!&rdquo; He turned on the detective. &ldquo;Yes,
  and you, too! Get out of here! You ought to know better! The man&rsquo;s
  had enough! Haven&rsquo;t you got anything else to do than hang around bumming
  drinks? I know you, and I&rsquo;ve a mind to report you! Get out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson slunk out through the door without protest. On the sidewalk
  the man with the brown peaked cap joined him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kelly&rsquo;s sore.&rdquo; Dave Henderson&rsquo;s tones were heavy
  with tolerant pity and magnanimous forgiveness. &ldquo;Ol&rsquo; friend&mdash;be
  all right to-morrow. Letsh go somewhere else for a drink. Whatsher shay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said the man in the brown peaked cap.</p>
  <p>The detective was complacently agreeable to all suggestions. It was Dave
  Henderson who acted as guide; and he began a circuit of saloons in a direction
  that brought him sensibly nearer at each visit to the street and house occupied
  by one Nicolo Capriano. In the same block with Capriano&rsquo;s house he
  had noticed that there was also a saloon, and if Capriano&rsquo;s house had
  an exit on the lane, so, likewise, it was logical to presume, had the saloon.
  And that saloon now, barring intermediate stops, was his objective. But he
  was in no hurry. There was one point on which he had still to satisfy himself
  before he gave this man Speen the slip in that saloon and, by the lane, gained
  the rear door of Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s house. He knew now that he was dealing
  with the police; but was Speen detailed <i>alone</i> to the case, or did
  Speen have assistance at hand in the background&mdash;assistance enough,
  say, to have scared off any move on the part of Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s and
  Baldy Vickers&rsquo; gang, of whom, certainly, he had seen nothing as yet?</p>
  <p>A half hour passed. Several saloons were visited. Dave Henderson no longer
  cupped his hand around his glass. Having had nothing to start with, he could
  drink frankly, and a shaky hand could be trusted to spill any over-generous
  portions. They became confidential. He confided to Speen what Speen already
  knew&mdash;that he, Dave Henderson, <i>was</i> Dave Henderson, and just out
  from the penitentiary. Speen, stating that his name was Monahan, reciprocated
  with mendacious confidences that implied he was puritanical in neither his
  mode of life nor his means of livelihood&mdash;and began to throw out hints
  that he was not averse to a share in any game that Dave Henderson might have
  on hand.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson got along very badly now between the various oases that quenched
  his raging thirst. He leaned heavily on Speen, he stumbled frequently, and,
  in stumbling, obtained equally frequent views of both sides of the street
  behind him. No one seemed to be paying any attention to his companion or
  himself, and yet once or twice he had caught sight of skulking figures that,
  momentarily at least, had aroused his suspicions. But in this neighborhood
  there were many skulking figures! Again he could not be sure; but the saloon
  in Capriano&rsquo;s block was the next one ahead now, and certainly nothing
  had transpired that would seem to necessitate any change being made in his
  plans.</p>
  <p>Speen, too, was feigning now a certain degree of intoxication. They reached
  the saloon, reeled through the door arm in arm, and ranged up alongside the
  bar.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s eyes swept his surroundings, critical of every detail.
  It was an unpleasant and dirty place; and the few loungers, some seated at
  little tables, some hanging over the bar itself, were a hard and ugly looking
  lot.</p>
  <p>The clientele, however, interested Dave Henderson very little&mdash;at the
  rear of the room, and but a few yards from the end of the bar, there was
  an open door, disclosing a short passage beyond, that interested him a great
  deal more! Beyond that passage was undoubtedly the back yard, and beyond
  that again was the lane. He had no desire to harm Speen, none whatever; but
  if any one of a dozen pretexts, that he might make to elude the man for the
  moment or two that was necessary to gain the yard unobserved, did not succeed,
  and Speen persisted in following him out there into the yard&mdash;well,
  so much the worse for Speen, that was all!</p>
  <p>He was arguing now with Speen, each claiming the right to pay for the drink&mdash;but
  his mind was sifting through those dozen pretexts for the most plausible
  one to employ. He kept on arguing. Customers slouched in and out of the place;
  some sat down at the tables, some came to the bar. One, a hulk of a man,
  unshaven, with bull-breadth shoulders, with nose flattened over on one side
  of his cheek, stepped up to the bar beside Speen. Speen&rsquo;s back was
  turned, but the man grinned hospitably at Dave Henderson over Speen&rsquo;s
  shoulder, as he listened to the argument for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put away your money, son, an&rsquo; have a drink with me,&rdquo; he
  invited.</p>
  <p>Speen turned.</p>
  <p>The grin on the battered face of the newcomer faded instantly, as he stared
  with apparently sudden recognition into Speen&rsquo;s face; and a black,
  ugly scowl spread over the already unhandsome features.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s <i>you</i>, is it?&rdquo; he said hoarsely, and licked
  his lips. &ldquo;By God, you got a nerve to come down here&mdash;you have!
  You dirty police spy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Speen was evidently not easily stampeded. He eyed the other levelly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve got the wrong man, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
  returned coolly enough. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Monahan, and I don&rsquo;t
  know you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; snarled the other viciously. &ldquo;Your name&rsquo;s
  Speen! And you don&rsquo;t know me&mdash;<i>don&rsquo;t you?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Speen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t, eh?&rdquo; The man thrust his face almost into Speen&rsquo;s. &ldquo;You
  don&rsquo;t remember a year ago gettin&rsquo; me six months on a fake plant,
  either, I suppose!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Speen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t, eh?&rdquo; snarled the man again. &ldquo;A hell
  of a bad memory you&rsquo;ve got, ain&rsquo;t you? Well, I&rsquo;ll fix it
  for you so&rsquo;s you won&rsquo;t forget me so easy next time, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It came quick, without warning&mdash;before Dave Henderson could move. He
  saw a great, grimy fist whip forward to the point of Speen&rsquo;s jaw, and
  he caught a tiny reflected gleam of light from an ugly brass knuckleduster
  on one of the fingers of the clenched fist; and Speen&rsquo;s knees seemed
  to crumple up under him, and he went down in a heap to the floor.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson straightened up from the bar, a hard, grim smile twisting
  across his lips. It had been a brutal act. Speen might be a policeman, and
  Speen, lying there senseless, solved a certain little difficulty without
  further effort on his, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s, part; but the brutality of
  the act had him in its grip. There was a curious itching at his finger tips
  for a clutch that would maul this already battered bruiser&rsquo;s face beyond
  recognition. His eyes circled the room. The men at the tables had risen to
  their feet; some were pushing forward, and one, he saw over his shoulder,
  ran around the far end of the bar and disappeared. Speen lay inert, a huddled
  thing on the floor, a crimson stream spilling its way down over the man&rsquo;s
  white collar.</p>
  <p>The twisted smile on Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips deepened. The bruiser was
  watching him like a cat, and there was a leer on the other&rsquo;s face that
  seemed to possess some hidden significance. Well, perhaps he would change
  that leer, with whatever its significance might be, into something still
  more unhappy! He moved a few inches out from the bar. He wanted room for
  arm-play now, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>The street door opened. Four or five men were crowding in. He caught a glimpse
  of a face among them that he knew&mdash;a little wizened face, crowned with
  flaming red hair&mdash;Runty Mott.</p>
  <p>And then the lights went out.</p>
  <p>Quick as a lightning flash Dave Henderson dropped to his hands and knees.
  There was a grunt above him, as though from the swing of a terrific blow
  that, meeting with no resistance, had over-reached itself in midair&mdash;then
  the forward lunge of a heavy body, a snarl, an oath, as the bruiser stumbled
  over Dave Henderson&rsquo;s crouched form&mdash;and then a crash, as Dave
  Henderson grappled, low down at the other&rsquo;s knees, and the man went
  to the floor. But the other, for all his weight and bulk, was lithe and agile,
  and his arms, flung out, circled and locked around Dave Henderson&rsquo;s
  neck.</p>
  <p>The place was in pandemonium. Feet scuffled; chairs and tables toppled over
  in the darkness. Shouts, yells and curses made a din infernal. Dave Henderson
  wrenched and tore at the arms around his neck. He saw it all now&mdash;all.
  The police had trailed him; Baldy Vickers&rsquo; gang had trailed the police.
  The bruiser was one of the gang. They had to get rid of the police, in the
  person of Speen, to cover their own trail again before they got him, Dave
  Henderson. And they, too, had thought him drunk, and an easy prey. With Speen
  unconscious from a quarrel that even Speen, when he recovered, would never
  connect with its real purpose, they meant to kidnap him, Dave Henderson,
  and get him away in the confusion without any of the innocent bystanders
  in the place knowing what was going on. That was why the lights had gone
  off&mdash;that man he had seen running around the upper end of the room&mdash;he
  remembered now&mdash;the man had come in just behind the bruiser&mdash;that
  accounted for the lights&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t dare shoot&mdash;he had
  that advantage&mdash;dead, he wasn&rsquo;t any good to them&mdash;they wanted
  that&mdash;hundred&mdash;thousand&mdash;dollars.</p>
  <p>He was choking. Instead of arms, steel fingers had sunk into his throat.
  He lunged out with all his strength. His fist met something that, though
  it yielded slightly, brought a brutal twinge of pain across his knuckles.
  His fist shot out again, whipped to its mark with everything that was in
  him behind the blow; and it was the bruiser&rsquo;s face he hit. He hit it
  again, and, over the mad fury that was upon him, he knew an unholy joy as
  his blows crashed home.</p>
  <p>The steel fingers around his throat relaxed and fell away. He staggered
  to his feet.</p>
  <p>A voice from somewhere close at hand spoke hoarsely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scrag him, Mugsy! See that he&rsquo;s knocked cold before we carry
  him out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no answer from the floor.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips were no longer twisted in a smile, they were
  thinned and straight; he knew why there was no answer from the floor! He
  crouched, gathering himself for a spring. Dark, shadowy forms were crowding
  in around him. There was only one chance&mdash;the door now, the rear door,
  and the lane! Voices growled and cursed, seemingly almost in his ears. They
  had him hemmed against the bar without knowing it, as they clustered around
  the spot where they expected he was being strangled into unconsciousness
  on the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mugsy, d&rsquo;ye hear! Damn you, d&rsquo;ye hear! Why don&rsquo;t
  you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson launched himself forward. A wild yell went up. Hands clutched
  at him, and tore at his clothing, and struck at his face; forms flung themselves
  at his shoulders, and clung around his legs. He shook them off&mdash;and
  gained a few yards. He was fighting like a madman now&mdash;and now the darkness
  was in his favor.</p>
  <p>They came on again in a blind rush. The door could not be far away! He stumbled
  over one of the small tables, recovered himself, and, snatching up the table,
  whirled it by one of its legs in a sweep around his head. There was a smash
  of impact that almost knocked the table from his grasp&mdash;and, coincidentally,
  a scream of pain. It cleared a space about him. He swung again, whirling
  the table around and around his head, gaining impetus&mdash;and suddenly
  sent it catapulting from him full into the shadowy forms in front of him,
  and, turning, made a dash for the end of the room.</p>
  <p>He reached the wall, and groped along it for the door. The door! Where was
  it? He felt the warm, blood trickling down over his face. He did not remember
  when that had happened! He could not see&mdash;but they would turn on the
  lights surely now in an instant if they were not fools&mdash;and he must
  find the door first or he was trapped&mdash;that was his only chance&mdash;the
  place was a bedlam of hideous riot&mdash;curse the blood, it seemed to be
  running into his eyes now&mdash;Runty Mott&mdash;if only he could have settled
  with the skulking&mdash;</p>
  <p>His fingers touched and felt around the jamb of the open door&mdash;and
  he surged, panting, through the doorway. The short passage ended in another
  door. He opened this, found the yard in front of him, dashed across it, and
  hurled himself over the fence into the lane.</p>
  <p>The uproar, the yells, the furious shouts from behind him seemed suddenly
  to increase in volume. He ran the faster. They had turned the lights on&mdash;and
  found him gone! From somewhere in the direction of the street there came
  the shrill cheep-cheep of a patrolman&rsquo;s whistle. Yes, he quite understood
  that, too&mdash;there would be a riot call pulled in a minute, but that made
  little difference to him. It was the gangsters, who were now probably pouring
  out of the saloon&rsquo;s back door in pursuit of him, with whom he had to
  reckon. But he should be safe now&mdash;he was abreast of Capriano&rsquo;s
  house, which he could distinguish even in the darkness because the extension
  stuck out like some great, black looming shadow from the row of other houses.</p>
  <p>There was a gate here somewhere, or a door in the fence, undoubtedly; but
  he had no time to hunt for gate or door, perhaps only to find it locked!
  The fence was quicker and easier. He swung himself up, and over&mdash;and,
  scarcely a yard away, found himself confronted with what looked like an enclosed
  porch or vestibule to the Italian&rsquo;s back door.</p>
  <p>He was quick now, but equally silent in his movements. From the direction
  of the saloon, shouts reached him, the voices no longer muffled, but as though
  they were out in the open&mdash;in the back yard of the saloon perhaps, or
  perhaps by now in the lane itself. He stepped inside the porch, and knocked
  softly on the door. He knocked again and again. It seemed as though the seconds
  dragged themselves out into immeasureable periods of time. He swept the blood
  out of his eyes once more, and, his ears strained laneward, continued to
  knock insistently, louder and louder.</p>
  <p>A light footstep, hurried, sounded from within. It halted on the other side
  of the closed door. He had a feeling that somehow, even through that closed
  door, and even in the darkness, he was under inspection. The next instant
  he was sure of it. Above his head a small incandescent bulb suddenly flooded
  the porch with light, and fell full upon him as he stood there, a ghastly
  object, he realized, with blood-stained face, and torn and dishevelled clothes.</p>
  <p>From behind the closed door came a girl&rsquo;s startled gasp of dismay
  and alarm; from up the lane now unmistakably came the pound of racing feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; whispered Dave Henderson hoarsely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  from Tony Lomazzi. For God&rsquo;s sake, put out that light!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  Sanctuary</b></h2>
  <p>THE light in the porch went out. From within, as though with slow, dubious
  hesitation, a key turned in the lock. The door opened slightly, and from
  a dark interior the girl&rsquo;s voice reached Dave Henderson again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tony Lomazzi sent you, you say!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a puzzled
  way; and then, a sudden apprehension in her voice: &ldquo;You are all covered
  with blood&mdash;what is the matter? What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From the lane, the sound of pounding, racing feet seemed almost opposite
  the Italian&rsquo;s porch now. Dave Henderson, without ceremony, pushed at
  the door. It yielded, as the girl evidently retreated backward abruptly,
  and he stepped inside, closed the door softly behind him, and, feeling for
  the key, turned it swiftly in the lock. He could see nothing, but out of
  the darkness near him came a sharp, quick-drawn intake of breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson quietly. &ldquo;But it
  was a bit of a close call. I&rsquo;m not quite sure whether they are running
  after me, or running from the police, but, either way, it would have been
  a little awkward if I had been seen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She seemed to have regained her composure, for her voice, as she spoke again,
  was as quiet and as evenly modulated as his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she asked once more. &ldquo;Why did Tony
  Lomazzi send you here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did not answer at once. From somewhere in the front of the house, muffled,
  but still quite audible, there came the voices of two men&mdash;one high-pitched,
  querulous, curiously short-breathed, the other with a sort of monotonous,
  sullen whine in it. He listened automatically for an instant, as his eyes
  searched around him. It was almost black inside here as he stood with his
  back to the door, but, grown more accustomed to the darkness now, he could
  make out a faint, blurred form, obviously that of the girl, a few feet away
  from him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to see Nicolo Capriano,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>It was her turn now to pause before she answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it necessary?&rdquo; she asked finally.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To me&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father has already had far too much excitement to-night,&rdquo; she
  said in a low voice. &ldquo;He is a very sick man. There is some one with
  him now. If you could give me the message it would be better. As for any
  help you need, for you appear to be hurt, I will gladly attend to that myself.
  You may be assured of that, if you come from Tony Lomazzi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s daughter, then! It struck him as a passing
  thought, though of no particular consequence, that she spoke excellent English
  for an Italian girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson
  seriously. &ldquo;It is practically a matter of life and death to me to see
  Nicolo Capriano, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From the front of the house the querulous voice rose suddenly in a still
  higher pitch:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Teresa! Teresa!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am coming!&rdquo; the girl cried out; and then, hurriedly,
  to Dave Henderson: &ldquo;Wait here a moment. I will tell him. What is your
  name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson smiled a little queerly in the darkness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he is alone when you tell him, it is Dave Henderson,&rdquo; he
  said dryly. &ldquo;Otherwise, it is Smith&mdash;John Smith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was gone.</p>
  <p>He listened as her footsteps died away in the darkness; and then he listened
  again at the door. There was still a great deal of commotion out there in
  the lane, but certainly there was nothing to indicate that he and Nicolo
  Capriano&rsquo;s back porch had in any way been suspected of having had anything
  in common; it was, rather, as though the entire saloon up there had emptied
  itself in haste into the lane, and was running pell-mell in an effort to
  be anywhere but in that vicinity when the police arrived. Well, so much the
  better! For the moment, at least, he had evaded the trap set for him both
  by Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s pack and by the police&mdash;and the next move
  depended very largely upon Nicolo Capriano, or, perhaps even more, upon this
  daughter of his, since the old man, it seemed, was sick. The girl&rsquo;s
  name was apparently Teresa&mdash;which mattered very little. What mattered
  a great deal more was that she evidently had her wits about her&mdash;an
  inheritance possibly from the old man, whose reputation, in his day, as one
  of the coolest and shrewdest of those outside the pale of the law, was at
  least substantiated by the fact that he had been able to stand off the police
  for practically a lifetime.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson raised his hand, and felt gingerly over his right temple.
  The blood had stopped flowing, but there was a large and well-defined lump
  there. He did not remember at just what particular stage of the fight that
  had happened. From his head, his hand felt over his clothing. He nodded a
  little ruefully to himself. He had come off far from scathless&mdash;his
  coat had almost literally been torn from his back.</p>
  <p>Voices reached him again from the front of the house; he heard the girl
  speaking quietly in Italian; he heard some response in the sullen whine that
  he had remarked before; and then the street door opened and closed. There
  was silence then for what seemed a long time, until finally he caught the
  sound of the girl&rsquo;s step coming toward him again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father will see you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I want to warn
  you again that he is a very sick man&mdash;sicker than he imagines he is.
  It is his heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come with me, then,&rdquo; she said tersely. &ldquo;There is a door
  here&mdash;the passage turns to the right. Can you see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a queer place&mdash;with its darkness, and its twisted passage! Quite
  queer for so small and ordinary a dwelling&mdash;but, if rumor were true,
  it had been queerer still in the years gone by! A grim smile crossed Dave
  Henderson&rsquo;s lips, as he followed the shadowy form of his conductor.
  It augured well, at all events! The surroundings at least bore out Nicolo
  Capriano&rsquo;s record, which was a record much to be desired by a man in
  his, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s, straits.</p>
  <p>The light from an open door beyond the turn in the passage dispelled the
  darkness. The girl was standing there now, motioning him to enter&mdash;but
  suddenly, for a moment, he stood and stared at her. This was queer, too!
  Everything about the place was queer! Somehow he had pictured in the darkness
  an Italian girl, pretty enough perhaps in a purely physical way, with gold
  rings in her ears, perhaps, such as the men wore, and slatternly, with feet
  shod in coarse, thick boots; the only kind of an Italian girl he had ever
  remembered having seen&mdash;a girl that hauled at the straps of a hand-organ,
  while the man plodded along the streets between the shafts. She wasn&rsquo;t
  like that, though&mdash;and he stared at her; stared at the trim, lithe,
  daintily dressed little figure, stared at the oval face, and the dark, steady,
  self-reliant eyes, and the wealth of rich, black hair that crowned the broad,
  white forehead, and glinted like silken strands, as the light fell upon it.</p>
  <p>The color mounted in her cheeks.</p>
  <p>And then, with a start, he pushed his hand across his eyes, and bit his
  lips, and flushed a deeper red than hers.</p>
  <p>Her eyes, that had begun to harden as they met his gaze, softened in an
  instant, and she smiled. His confusion had been his apology, his acquittal
  of any intended offense.</p>
  <p>She motioned again to him to enter, and, as he stepped forward across the
  threshold, she reached in and rested her hand on the doorknob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can call when you need me, father,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and
  closed the door softly.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s eyes swept the room with a swift, comprehensive glance;
  and then held steadily on a pair of jet-black eyes, so black that they seemed
  to possess no pupils, which were in turn fixed on him by a strange-looking
  figure, lying on a quaint, old-fashioned, four-poster bed across the room.
  He moved forward and took a chair at the bedside, as the other beckoned to
  him.</p>
  <p>So this was Nicolo Capriano! The man was propped upright in bed by means
  of pillows that were supported by an inverted chair behind them; both hands,
  very white, very blue under the nails of the long, slender fingers, lay out-stretched
  before him on an immaculately white coverlet; the man&rsquo;s hair was silver,
  and a white beard and mustache but partially disguised the thin, emaciated
  condition of his face. But it was the eyes that above all else commanded
  attention. They were unnaturally bright, gleaming out from under enormously
  white, bushy eyebrows; and they were curiously inscrutable eyes. They seemed
  to hold great depths beneath which might smolder a passion that would leap
  without warning into flame; or to hold, as they did now, a strange introspective
  stare, making them like shuttered windows that gave no glimpse of the mind
  within.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am Nicolo Capriano,&rdquo; said the man abruptly, and in perfect
  English. &ldquo;My daughter tells me that you gave your name as Dave Henderson.
  The name seems familiar. I have heard it somewhere. I remember, it seems
  to me, a little matter of one hundred thousand dollars some five years ago,
  for which a man by that name went to the penitentiary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s eyes wandered for a moment around the room again.
  He found himself wondering at the man&rsquo;s English&mdash;as he had at
  the girl&rsquo;s. Subconsciously he was aware that the furnishings, though
  plain and simple and lacking in anything ornate, were foreign and unusual,
  but that the outstanding feature of the room was a sort of refreshing and
  immaculate cleanliness&mdash;like the coverlet. He forced his mind back to
  what Nicolo Capriano had said.</p>
  <p>Were all his cards to go face up on the table for Nicolo Capriano to see?</p>
  <p>He had intended to make no more of a confidant of the other than was absolutely
  necessary; but, equally, he had not expected to find in Nicolo Capriano a
  physically helpless and bed-ridden man. It made a difference&mdash;a very
  great difference! If Millman, for instance, had been bed-ridden, it&mdash; He
  caught himself smiling a little mirthlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s me&mdash;Dave Henderson,&rdquo; he said calmly.</p>
  <p>The old Italian nodded his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the hundred thousand dollars has never been recovered,&rdquo; he
  observed shrewdly. &ldquo;The police are interested in your movements, eh?
  It is for that reason you have come to me, is it not so? And Tony Lomazzi
  foresaw all this&mdash;and he sent you here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson&mdash;and frowned suddenly. It was
  bothering him again&mdash;the fact that this Italian and his daughter should
  speak English as though it were their own tongue.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano nodded his head again. And then, astutely:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something is disturbing you, my young friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What
  is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson straightened in his chair with a little start&mdash;and laughed
  shortly. Very little, evidently, escaped Nicolo Capriano!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just that you and your
  daughter speak pretty good English for Italians.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano smiled softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should speak pretty good English,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and Teresa
  should speak it even better. We both learned it as children. I, in a certain
  part of London, as a boy; and Teresa here in San Francisco, where she was
  born. Her mother was American, and, though I taught Teresa Italian, we always
  spoke English while her mother was alive, and afterwards my daughter seemed
  to think we should continue to do so.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;But
  you came from Lomazzi,&rdquo; he prompted. &ldquo;Tell me about Lomazzi.
  He is well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson quietly.</p>
  <p>The thin hands, outstretched before the other, closed with a quick twitching
  motion&mdash;then opened, and the fingers began to pluck abstractedly at
  the coverlet. There was no other sign of emotion, or movement from the figure
  on the bed, except that the keen, black eyes were veiled now by half closed
  lids.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He died&mdash;fifteen years ago&mdash;when he went up there&mdash;for
  life&rdquo;&mdash;the man seemed to be communing with himself. &ldquo;Yes,
  yes; he is dead&mdash;he has been dead for fifteen years.&rdquo; He looked
  up suddenly, and fixed his eyes with a sharp, curiously appraising gaze on
  Dave Henderson. &ldquo;You speak of actual death, of course,&rdquo; he said,
  in a low tone. &ldquo;Do you know anything of the circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was two months ago,&rdquo; Dave Henderson answered. &ldquo;He
  was taken ill one night. His cell was next to mine. He was my friend. He
  asked for me, and the warden let me go to him. He died in a very few minutes.
  It was then, while I was in the cell, that he whispered to me that I would
  need help when I got out, and he told me to come to you, and to say that
  he sent me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And to the warden, and whoever else was in the cell, he said&mdash;nothing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s eyes were hidden again; the long, slim fingers,
  with blue-tipped nails, plucked at the coverlet. It was a full minute before
  he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I owe Tony Lomazzi a great debt,&rdquo; he said slowly; &ldquo;and
  I would like to repay it in a little way by helping you since he has asked
  it; but it is not to-day, young man, as it was in those days so long ago.
  For fifteen years I have not lifted my hand against the police. And it is
  obviously for help from the police that you come to me. You have served your
  term, and the police would not molest you further except for a good reason.
  Is it not so? And the reason is not far to seek, I think. It is the money
  which was never recovered that they are after. You have it hidden somewhere.
  You know where it is, and you wish to outwit the police while you secure
  it. Am I not right?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson glanced at the impassive face propped up on the pillows.
  Old Nicolo Capriano in no way belied his reputation for shrewdness; the man&rsquo;s
  brain, however physically ill he might be otherwise, had at least not lost
  its cunning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson, with a short, sudden laugh, &ldquo;you
  are right&mdash;but also you are wrong. It is the police that I want to get
  away from, and it is on account of that money, which, it is also true, I
  hid away before I went up; but it is not only the police, it is the gang
  of crooks who put me in wrong at the trial who are trying to grab it, too&mdash;only,
  as it stands now, I don&rsquo;t know where the money is myself. I trusted
  a fellow in the jug, who got out two months ahead of me&mdash;and he did
  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The white bushy eyebrows went up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; ejaculated the old Italian. &ldquo;Well, then, what is
  the use!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A whole lot!&rdquo; returned Dave Henderson grimly. &ldquo;To get
  the fellow if I can! And I can&rsquo;t do that with the police, and a gang
  of crooks besides, at my heels, can I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano shook his head meditatively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have my daughter to think of,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Listen, young
  man, it has not been easy to stand square with the police during these years
  as it is, and that without any initiative act on my part that would stir
  them up against me again. Old associations and old records are not so easily
  got rid of. I will give you an example. There was a man here to-night&mdash;when
  you came. His name is Ignace Ferroni. He was one of us in the old days&mdash;do
  you understand? When the trouble came for which Tony Lomazzi suffered, Ignace
  managed to get away. I had not seen him from that day to this. He came back
  here to-night for help&mdash;for a very strange kind of help. He was one
  of us, I have said, and he had not forgotten his old ways. He had a bomb,
  a small bomb in his pocket, whose mechanism had gone wrong. He had already
  planted it once to-night, and finding it did not explode, he picked it up
  again, and brought it to me, and asked me to fix it for him. It was an old
  feud he had with some one, he would not tell me who, that he had been nursing
  all this time. I think his passion for vengeance had perhaps turned his head
  a little. I refused to have anything to do with his bomb, of course, and
  he left here in a rage, and in his condition he is as likely to turn on me
  as he is to carry out his original intention. But, that apart, what am I
  to do now? He was one of us, I cannot expose him to the police&mdash;he would
  be sentenced to a long term. And yet, if his bomb explodes, to whom will
  the police come first? To me!&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano suddenly raised his
  hands, and they were clenched&mdash;and as suddenly caught his breath, and
  choked, and a spasm of pain crossed his face. The next instant he was smiling
  mirthlessly with twitching lips. &ldquo;Yes, to me&mdash;to me, whom some
  fool amongst them once called the Dago Bomb King, which they will never forget!
  It is always to me they come! Any crime that seems to have the slightest
  Italian tinge&mdash;and they come to Nicolo Capriano!&rdquo; He shrugged
  his shoulders. &ldquo;You see, young man, it is not easy for me to steer
  my way unmolested even when I am wholly innocent. But I, too, do not forget!
  I do not forget Tony Lomazzi! Tell me exactly what you want me to do. You
  think you can find the man and the money if you can throw the police and
  the others off your trail?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson, with ominous quiet. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  my job in life now! If I could disappear for three or four days, I guess
  that&rsquo;s all the start I&rsquo;d need.&rdquo; There was a tolerant smile
  now on the old bomb king&rsquo;s lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three or four days would be a very easy matter,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But
  after that&mdash;what? It might do very well in respect to this gang of crooks;
  but it would be of very little avail where the police are concerned, for
  they would simply do what the crooks could not do&mdash;see that every plain-clothesman
  and officer on this continent was on the watch for you. Do you imagine that,
  believing you know where the money is, the police will forget all about you
  in three or four days?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Dave Henderson, with the same ominous quiet; &ldquo;but
  all I ask is a fighting chance.&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano stared in speculative
  silence for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have courage, my young friend!&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I
  like that&mdash;also I do not like the police. But three or four days!&rdquo; He
  shook his head. &ldquo;You do not know the police as I know them! And this
  man you trusted, and who, as I understand, got away with the money, do you
  know where to find him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think he is in New York,&rdquo; Dave Henderson answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! New York!&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano nodded. &ldquo;But New York
  is a world in itself. He did not give you his address, and then rob you,
  I suppose!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson did not answer for a moment. What Nicolo Capriano said was
  very true! But the rendezvous that Millman had given was, on the face of
  it, a fake anyhow. That had been his own opinion from the start; but during
  the two years Millman and he had been together in prison there had been many
  little inadvertent remarks in conversation that had, beyond question of doubt,
  stamped Millman as a New Yorker. Perhaps Millman had remembered that when
  he had given the rendezvous in New York&mdash;to give color to its genuineness&mdash;because
  it was the only natural place he could propose if he was to carry out logically
  the stories he had told for two long years.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You do not answer?&rdquo; suggested Nicolo Capriano patiently.</p>
  <p>It was on Dave Henderson&rsquo;s tongue to lay the whole story bare to the
  date, day and hour of that hotel rendezvous, but instead he shook his head.
  He was conscious of no distrust of the other. Why should he be distrustful!
  It was not that. It seemed more an innate caution, that was an absurd caution
  now because the rendezvous meant nothing anyhow, that had sprung up spontaneously
  within him. He felt that he was suddenly illogical. He found himself answering
  in a savage, dogged sort of way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got
  his address&mdash;but New York is good enough. He spilled too much in prison
  for me not to know that&rsquo;s where he hangs out. I&rsquo;ll get him&mdash;if
  I can only shake the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s blue-tipped fingers went straggling through the
  long white beard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police!&rdquo; He was whispering&mdash;seemingly to himself. &ldquo;It
  is always the police&mdash;a lifetime of the cursed police&mdash;and I have
  my daughter to think of&mdash;but I do not forget Tony Lomazzi&mdash;Teresa
  would not have me forget.&rdquo; He spoke abruptly to Dave Henderson. &ldquo;Tell
  me about to-night. My daughter says you came here like a hunted thing, and
  it is very evident that you have been in a fight. I suppose it was with the
  police, or with this gang you speak of; but, in that case, you have ruined
  any chance of help from me if you have led them here&mdash;if, for instance,
  they are waiting now for you to come out again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not think they are waiting!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson, with
  a twisted smile. &ldquo;And I think that the police end of to-night, and
  maybe some of the rest of it as well, is in the hospital by now! It&rsquo;s
  not much of a story&mdash;but unless that light in your back porch, which
  was on for about two seconds, could be seen up the lane, there&rsquo;s no
  one could know that I am here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old Italian smiled curiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not put lights where they act as beacons,&rdquo; he said whimsically. &ldquo;It
  does not show from the lane; it is for the benefit of those <i>inside</i> the
  house. Tell me your story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson again. &ldquo;The
  police shadowed me from the minute I left the penitentiary to-day. To-night
  I handed them a little come-on, that&rsquo;s all, so as to make sure that
  I had side-tracked them before coming here. And then the gang, Baldy Vickers&rsquo; gang&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vickers&mdash;Baldy Vickers! Yes, yes, I know; they hang out at Jake
  Morrissey&rsquo;s place!&rdquo; exclaimed the old bomb king suddenly. &ldquo;Runty
  Mott, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was Runty Mott that butted in to-night,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson,
  with a short laugh. &ldquo;I had the fly-cop going, all right. I let him
  pick me up in a saloon over the bar. He thought I was pretty drunk even then.
  We started in to make a night of it&mdash;and the fly-cop was going to get
  a drunken man to spill all the history of his life, and incidentally get
  him to lead the way to where a certain little sum of money was! Understand?
  I kept heading in this direction, for I had looked the lay of the land over
  this afternoon. That saloon up the street was booked as my last stopping
  place. I was going to shake the fly-cop there, and&mdash;&rdquo; Dave Henderson
  paused.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano was leaning forward in his bed, and there was a new, feverish
  light in the coal-black eyes&mdash;like some long-smoldering flame leaping
  suddenly into a blaze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he breathed impatiently. &ldquo;Go on! Ah! I can see
  it all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Runty Mott and his crowd must have been trailing me.&rdquo; Dave
  Henderson smiled grimly. &ldquo;They thought both the fly-cop and myself
  were drunk. But to cover their own game and make their play at me they had
  to get the fly-cop out of the road first. One of the gang came into the saloon,
  faked a quarrel with the fly-cop, and knocked him out. I didn&rsquo;t know
  what was up until then, when I caught sight of Runty Mott and the rest of
  his crowd pushing in through the door.&rdquo; Dave Henderson&rsquo;s smile
  grew a little grimmer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all! They started something&mdash;but
  they didn&rsquo;t finish it! They had it all framed up well enough&mdash;the
  lights switched off, and all that, so as to lay me out and kidnap me, and
  then stow me away somewhere and make me talk.&rdquo; He jerked his hand toward
  his torn garments. &ldquo;There was a bit of a fight,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I
  left them there pawing the air in the dark, and I was down here in your porch
  before any of them got out to the lane. I fancy there&rsquo;s some little
  row up there now on account of that fly-cop they put to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s hand reached out, and began to pat excitedly at
  Dave Henderson&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is like the old days!&rdquo; he said feverishly. &ldquo;It is
  like the young blood warming up an old man&rsquo;s veins again. Yes, yes;
  it is like the old days back once more! Ah, my young friend, if I had had
  you on the night that Tony Lomazzi was trapped, instead of&mdash;but that
  is too late, eh? Yes&mdash;too late! But you are clever, and you use your
  head, and you have the courage. That is what I like! Yes, assuredly, I will
  help you, and not only for Tony Lomazzi&rsquo;s sake, but for your own. You
  shall have your chance, your fighting chance, my young friend, and you will
  run down your man&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was rising in excitement&mdash;&ldquo;and
  the money&mdash;eh! Yes, yes! And Nicolo Capriano will help you!&rdquo; He
  raised his voice still higher. &ldquo;Teresa! Here, Teresa!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
  <p>The door opened; the girl stood on the threshold.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said reprovingly, &ldquo;you are exciting yourself
  again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old bomb king&rsquo;s voice was instantly subdued.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I am not! You see&mdash;my little one! You see, I am quite calm.
  And now listen to me. This is Tony Lomazzi&rsquo;s friend, and he is therefore
  our friend. Is it not so? Well, then, listen! He is in need of help. The
  police must not get him. So, first, he must have some clothes instead of
  those torn ones. Get him some of mine. They will not fit very well&mdash;but
  they will do. Then you will telephone Emmanuel that I have a guest for him
  who does not like the police, a guest by the name of Smith&mdash;that is
  enough for him to know. And tell Emmanuel that he is to come with his car,
  and wait a block below the lane. And after that again you will go out, Teresa,
  and let us know if all is safe, and if there is still any police, or any
  one else, in the lane. Eh? Well, run then!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. She was looking at Dave Henderson now, and
  there was a friendly smile in the dark, steady eyes, though she still addressed
  her father. &ldquo;And what news does he bring us of Tony?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will know by and by, when there is time,&rdquo; her father answered
  with sudden brusqueness. &ldquo;Run, now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was back in a few moments with an armful of clothes; then once more
  left the room, this time closing the door behind her.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano pointed to a second door at the side of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is the bathroom, my young friend,&rdquo; he said crisply. &ldquo;Go
  in there and wash the blood off your face, and change your clothes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson hesitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think it is safe for her, for your daughter, to go out there?&rdquo; he
  demurred. &ldquo;There was more of a row than perhaps I led you to imagine,
  and the police&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; The old Italian grinned suddenly in derision. &ldquo;Listen,
  my young friend, you need have no fear. My daughter is a Capriano&mdash;eh?
  Yes, and like her father, she is more than a match for all the police in
  San Francisco. Go now, and change! It will not take Emmanuel long to get
  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It took Dave Henderson perhaps ten minutes to wash and bathe his bruises,
  and change into the Italian&rsquo;s clothes. At the expiration of that time,
  he surveyed the result in a small mirror that hung on the wall. The clothes
  were ready-made, and far from new; they were ill-fitting, and they bulged
  badly in places. His appearance was not flattering! He might have passed
  for an Italian navvy in hard luck and&mdash; He smiled queerly, as he turned
  from the mirror and transferred the money he had received from Square John
  Kelly, together with his few belongings, from the pockets of his discarded
  suit to those of the one he now had on. He stepped out into the bedroom.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano in turn surveyed the metamorphosis critically for a moment&mdash;and
  nodded his head in approval.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; ejaculated the old bomb king. &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; He
  rubbed his thin fingers together. &ldquo;Yes, yes, it is like the old days
  again! Ha, ha, old Nicolo still plays a hand in the game, and old Nicolo&rsquo;s
  head is still on his shoulders. Three or four days! That would be easy even
  for a child! Emmanuel will take care of that. But we must do better than
  that&mdash;eh? And that is not so simple! To hide away from the police is
  one thing, and to outwit them completely is another! Is it not so? You must
  give the old man, whose brain has grown rusty because it has been so long
  idle, time to think, eh? It will do you no good if you always have to hide&mdash;eh?
  But, listen, you will hide while old Nicolo thinks&mdash;you understand?
  You can trust Emmanuel&mdash;but tell him nothing. He keeps a little restaurant,
  and he will give you a room upstairs. You must not leave that room, you must
  not show yourself, until you hear from me. You quite understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You need not worry on that score!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson grimly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried the old Italian again. &ldquo;Only my daughter
  and myself will know that you are there. You can leave it to old Nicolo to
  find a way. Yes, yes&rdquo;&mdash;excitement was growing upon the man again;
  he rocked his body to and fro&mdash;&ldquo;old Nicolo and the police&mdash;ha,
  ha! Old Nicolo, who is dying in his bed&mdash;eh? And&mdash;&rdquo; His voice
  was hushed abruptly; he lowered himself back on his pillows. &ldquo;Here
  is Teresa!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;She will say I am exciting myself
  again. Bah! I am strong again with the old wine in my veins!&rdquo; His hands
  lay suddenly quiet and composed on the coverlet before him, as the door opened,
  and the girl stood again on the threshold. &ldquo;Well, my little one?&rdquo; he
  purred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Emmanuel has come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There are some police
  up in Vinetto&rsquo;s saloon, but there is no one in the lane. It is quite
  safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Emmanuel understands?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go, then!&rdquo; The old Italian was holding out his hand to Dave
  Henderson. &ldquo;Go at once! My daughter will take you to Emmanuel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson caught the other&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but look here,&rdquo; he said, a sudden huskiness in his voice, &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You want to thank me&mdash;eh?&rdquo; said the old bomb king, shaking
  his head. &ldquo;Well, my young friend, there will be time enough for that.
  You will see me again&mdash;eh? Yes! When old Nicolo sends for you, you will
  come. Until then&mdash;you will remember! Do not move from your room! Now,
  go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa spoke from the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, hurry, please!&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;The lane was
  empty a few minutes ago, but&mdash;&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders significantly.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson, with a final nod to the propped-up figure in the bed, turned
  and followed Teresa along the passage, and out into the porch. Here she bade
  him wait while she went out again into the lane; but in a minute more she
  called out to him in a whisper to join her.</p>
  <p>They passed out of the lane, and into the cross street. A little ahead of
  them, Dave Henderson could see a small car, its hood up, standing by the
  curb.</p>
  <p>She stopped suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Emmanuel has seen me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That is all that is
  necessary to identify you.&rdquo; She held out her hand. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
  hope you will get out of your danger safely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I do,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson fervently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  have you and your father to thank for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You will have to thank Tony Lomazzi.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He wanted to say something to detain her there for a moment or two longer,
  even under those most unauspicious of circumstances&mdash;but five years
  of prison had not made him glib of tongue, or quick of speech. She was very
  pretty&mdash;but it was not her prettiness alone that made her appeal. There
  was something of winsomeness about the lithe, graceful little figure, and
  something to admire in the quiet self-reliance, and the cool composure with
  which, for instance, she had just accepted the danger of possible, and decidedly
  unpleasant, interference by the police in the lane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t thank Tony Lomazzi, since he is dead,&rdquo; he
  blurted out&mdash;and the next instant cursed himself for a raw-tongued,
  blundering fool. In the rays of the street lamp a little way off, he saw
  her face go deathly white. Her hand that was in his closed with a quick,
  involuntary clutch, and fell away&mdash;and there came a little moan of pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tony&mdash;dead!&rdquo; And then she
  seemed to draw her little form erect&mdash;and smiled&mdash;but the great
  dark eyes were wet and full of tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice broke. &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; she said
  hurriedly&mdash;and turned abruptly away.</p>
  <p>He watched her, gnawing viciously at his lip, cursing at himself again for
  a blundering fool, until she disappeared in the lane; and then he, too, turned,
  and walked to the waiting car.</p>
  <p>A man in the driver&rsquo;s seat reached out and opened the door of the
  tonneau.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me Emmanuel,&rdquo; he said complacently, in broken English. &ldquo;You
  no give-a da damn for da police anymore. I gotta da room where you hide&mdash;safe.
  See? Over da restaurant. You eat, you sleep, you give-a da cops da laugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson stepped into the car. His mind was in a chaotic whirl. A
  thousand diverse things seemed struggling for supremacy&mdash;the police
  and Runty Mott&mdash;Millman&mdash;Capriano, the queer, sick Capriano&mdash;the
  girl, the girl with the wondrous face, who cried because Tony Lomazzi was
  dead&mdash;a thousand things impinging in lightning flashes that made a vortex
  of his brain. They found expression in a sort of debonair facetiousness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some boy, Emmanuel!&rdquo; he said&mdash;and flung himself down on
  the seat. &ldquo;Go to it!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  Nicolo Capriano Plays His Cards</b></h2>
  <p>NICOLO CAPRIANO&rsquo;S eyes were closed; the propped-up form on the pillows
  was motionless&mdash;only the thin fingers plucking at the coverlet with
  curiously patient insistence bore evidence that the man was not asleep.</p>
  <p>Suddenly he smiled; and his eyes opened, a dreamy, smoldering light in their
  depths. His hand reached out for the morning paper that lay on the bed beside
  him, and for the second time since Teresa had brought him the paper half
  an hour before, he pored for a long while over a leading &ldquo;story&rdquo; on
  the front page. It had nothing to do with the disturbance in Vinetto&rsquo;s
  saloon of the night before; it dealt with a strange and mysterious bomb explosion
  in a downtown park during the small morning hours, which, besides awakening
  and terrifying the immediate neighborhood, had, according to the newspaper
  account, literally blown a man, and, with the man, the bench on which he
  had evidently been sitting under an arc light, to pieces. The victim was
  mutilated beyond recognition; all that the police had been able to identify
  were fragments of a bomb, thus establishing the cause of the accident, or,
  more likely, as the paper hinted, murder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fool!&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano whispered. &ldquo;It was Ignace
  Ferroni&mdash;the fool! And so he would not listen to old Nicolo&mdash;eh?&rdquo; He
  cackled out suddenly, his laugh shrill and high echoing through the room. &ldquo;Well,
  perhaps it is as well, eh, Ignace? Perhaps it is as well&mdash;perhaps you
  will be of some service, Ignace, now that you are dead, eh, Ignace&mdash;which
  is something that you never were when you were alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laid the paper down, and again his eyes closed, and again the blue-tipped
  fingers resumed their interminable plucking at the coverlet&mdash;but now
  he whispered constantly to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A hundred thousand dollars.... It is a great deal of money.... We
  worked for much less in the old days&mdash;for very much less.... I am old
  and sick, am I?... Ha, ha!... But for just once more, eh&mdash;just once
  more&mdash;to see if the old cunning is not still there.... And if the cards
  are thrust into one&rsquo;s hands, does it not make the fingers itch to play
  them!... Yes, yes, it makes young again the blood in the old veins.... And
  Tony is dead.... Yes, yes, the young fellow is clever, too&mdash;clever enough
  to find the money again if the police do not meddle with him.... And the
  gang, Baldy Vickers&rsquo; gang&mdash;bah!&mdash;they are already no longer
  to be considered&mdash;they have not long arms, they do not reach far&mdash;they
  do not reach to New York&mdash;eh&mdash;where the police reach&mdash;and
  where old Nicolo Capriano reaches, too.... Ignace&mdash;the fool!.... So
  he would not listen, to me, eh&mdash;and he sat out there under the park
  light trying to fix his old bomb, and blew himself up.... The fool&mdash;but
  you have no reason to complain, eh, Nicolo?.... It will bring the police
  to the door, but for once they will be welcome, eh?.... They will not know
  it&mdash;but they will be welcome.... We will see if Nicolo Capriano is not
  still their match!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Outside somewhere in the hall he could hear Teresa moving about, busy with
  her morning work. He listened intently&mdash;not to his daughter&rsquo;s
  movements, but for a footstep on the pavement that, instead of passing by,
  would climb the short flight of steps to the front door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, why do they not come&mdash;eh?&rdquo; he muttered impatiently. &ldquo;Why
  do they not come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He relapsed into silence, but he no longer lay there placidly with his eyes
  closed. A strange excitement seemed to be growing upon him. It tinged the
  skin under his beard with a hectic flush, and the black eyes glistened and
  glinted abnormally, as they kept darting objectiveless glances here and there
  around the room.</p>
  <p>Perhaps half an hour passed, and then the sick man began to mutter again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will they make me send for them&mdash;the fools!&rdquo; He apostrophized
  the foot of the bed viciously. &ldquo;No, no&mdash;it would not be as safe.
  If they do not come in another hour, there will be time enough then for that.
  You must wait, Nicolo. The police have always come before to Nicolo Capriano,
  if they thought old Nicolo could help them&mdash;and with a bomb&mdash;ha,
  ha&mdash;to whom else would they come&mdash;eh?&mdash;to whom&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was instantly alert. Some one was outside there now. He heard the door
  bell ring, and presently he heard Teresa answer it. He caught a confused
  murmur of voices. The thin fingers were working with a quick, jubilant motion
  one over the other. The black eyes, half closed again, fixed expectantly
  on the door of the room opposite to the foot of the bed. It opened, and Teresa
  stepped into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is Lieutenant Barjan, father,&rdquo; she said, in a low tone. &ldquo;He
  wants to talk to you about that bomb explosion in the park.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; A queer smile twitched at the old bomb king&rsquo;s lips.
  He beckoned to his daughter to approach the bed, and, as she obeyed, he pulled
  her head down to his lips. &ldquo;You know nothing, Teresa&mdash;nothing!
  Understand? Nothing except to corroborate anything that I may say. You did
  not even know that there had been an explosion until he spoke of it. You
  know nothing about Ignace. You understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said composedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Well, now, go and tell him that
  I do not want to see him. Tell him I said he was to go away. Tell him that
  I won&rsquo;t see him, that I won&rsquo;t be bothered with him and his cursed
  police spies! Tell him that&rdquo;&mdash;he patted his daughter&rsquo;s head
  confidentially&mdash;&ldquo;and leave the door open, Teresa, little one,
  so that I can hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do, father?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha, ha&mdash;you will see, my little one&mdash;you will see!&rdquo; Capriano
  patted her head again. &ldquo;We do not forget our debt to Tony Lomazzi.
  No! Well, you will see! Tell the cunning, clever Barjan to go away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He watched as she left the room; and then, his head cocked on one side to
  listen, the blue-tipped fingers reached stealthily out and without a sound
  slid the newspaper that was lying in front of him under the bed covers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; he heard Teresa announce crisply; &ldquo;but
  my father positively refuses to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he does&mdash;does he?&rdquo; a voice returned in bland sarcasm. &ldquo;Well,
  I&rsquo;m very sorry myself then, but I guess he&rsquo;ll have to change
  his mind! Pardon me, Miss Capriano, if I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A quick, heavy step sounded in the hallway. Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s alert
  and listening attitude was gone in a flash. He pushed himself up in the bed,
  and held himself there with one hand, and the other outflung, knotted into
  a fist, he shook violently in the direction of the door, as the figure of
  the plain-clothesman appeared on the threshold.</p>
  <p>Old Nicolo Capriano was apparently in the throes of a towering passion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get out of here!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Did my daughter not tell
  you to get out! Go away! I want nothing to do with you! Curse you&mdash;and
  all the rest of the police with you! Can you not leave old Nicolo Capriano
  to die in peace&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Barjan coolly. He glanced over
  his shoulder. Teresa was standing just outside in the hall behind him. &ldquo;Pardon
  me,&rdquo; he said again&mdash;and closed the door upon her. &ldquo;Now then&rdquo;&mdash;he
  faced Nicolo Capriano once more&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no use kicking
  up all this dust. It won&rsquo;t get you anywhere, Nicolo. There&rsquo;s
  a little matter that I want to talk to you about, and that I&rsquo;m going
  to talk to you about whether you like it or not&mdash;that&rsquo;s all there
  is to it. And we&rsquo;ll get right to the point. What do you know about
  that affair in the park last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano sank back on his pillows, with a furious snarl. He still
  shook his fist at the officer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What should I know about your miserable affairs!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I
  know nothing about any park! I know nothing at all! Why do you not leave
  me in peace&mdash;eh? For fifteen years this has gone on, always spying on
  Nicolo Capriano, and for fifteen years Nicolo Capriano has not lifted a finger
  against the law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is true&mdash;as far as we know,&rdquo; said Barjan calmly. &ldquo;But
  there&rsquo;s a little record that goes back beyond those fifteen years,
  Nicolo, that keeps us a little chummy with you&mdash;and you&rsquo;ve been
  valuable at times, Nicolo.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano spat the exclamation viciously at the
  other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About last night,&rdquo; suggested Barjan patiently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  rather in your line. I thought perhaps you might be able to give us a little
  help that would put us on the right track.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about!&rdquo; snapped
  Nicolo Capriano.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about the man that was blown to pieces by a bomb.&rdquo; Barjan
  was still patient.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s eyes showed the first gleam of interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was any man blown up.&rdquo; His tone appeared
  to mingle the rage and antagonism that he had first exhibited with a new
  and suddenly awakened curiosity. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was any
  man blown up,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; said Barjan with mock resignation&mdash;and
  settled himself deliberately in a chair at the bedside. &ldquo;I guess, then,
  you&rsquo;re the only man in San Francisco who doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You fool!&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano rasped in rage again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  been bed-ridden for three years&mdash;and I wish to God you had been, too!&rdquo; He
  choked and coughed a little. He eyed Barjan malevolently. &ldquo;I tell you
  this is the first I&rsquo;ve heard of it. I don&rsquo;t hang about the street
  corners picking up the news! Don&rsquo;t sit there with your silly, smirking
  police face, trying to see how smart you can be! What information do you
  expect to get out of me like that? When I know nothing, I can tell nothing,
  can I? Who was the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we want to know,&rdquo; said Barjan pleasantly. &ldquo;And,
  look here, Nicolo, I&rsquo;m not here to rile you. All that was left was
  a few fragments of park bench, man, arc-light standard, and a piece or two
  of what was evidently a bomb.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What time was this?&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s eyes were on the
  foot of the bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three o&rsquo;clock this morning,&rdquo; Barjan answered.</p>
  <p>The old bomb king&rsquo;s fingers began to pluck at the coverlet. A minute
  passed. His eyes, from the foot of the bed, fixed for an instant moodily
  on Barjan&rsquo;s face&mdash;and sought the foot of the bed again.</p>
  <p>Barjan broke the silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you do know something about it, eh, Nicolo?&rdquo; he prodded
  softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anything had happened until you said so,&rdquo; returned
  Nicolo Capriano curtly. &ldquo;But seeing it has happened, maybe I&mdash;&rdquo; He
  cut his words off short, and eyed the plain-clothesman again. &ldquo;Is the
  man dead?&rdquo; he demanded, with well-simulated sudden suspicion. &ldquo;You
  aren&rsquo;t lying to me&mdash;eh? I trust none of you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; ejaculated Barjan almost hysterically. &ldquo;Good God&mdash;dead!
  Didn&rsquo;t I tell you he was blown into unrecognizable atoms!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The sharp, black eyes lingered a little longer on Barjan&rsquo;s face. The
  result appeared finally to allay Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s suspicions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, all right, then, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he said, but there
  was a grudging note still in the old bomb king&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t
  do the man any harm if he&rsquo;s dead. I guess you&rsquo;ll know who it
  is. It&rsquo;s the fellow who pulled that hundred thousand dollar robbery
  about five years ago on old man Tydeman&mdash;the fellow that went by the
  name of Dave Henderson. I don&rsquo;t know whether that&rsquo;s his real
  name or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; shouted Barjan. He had lost his composure. He was up
  from his chair, and staring wildly at the old man on the bed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  crazy!&rdquo; he jerked out suddenly. &ldquo;Either you&rsquo;re lying to
  me, or you&rsquo;re off your nut! You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano was in a towering rage in an instant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You get out of here!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;You get to hell out
  of here! I didn&rsquo;t ask you to come, and I don&rsquo;t give a damn whether
  it was Dave Henderson or a polecat! It&rsquo;s nothing to do with me! It&rsquo;s
  your hunt&mdash;so go and hunt somewhere else! I&rsquo;m lying, or I&rsquo;m
  off my nut, am I? Well, you get to hell out of here! Go on!&rdquo; He shook
  a frantic fist at Barjan, and, choking, coughing, pulled himself up in bed
  again, and pointed to the door. &ldquo;Do you hear? Get out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barjan shifted uneasily in alarm. Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s coughing spell
  had developed into a paroxysm that was genuine enough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Barjan, in a pacifying tone, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
  excite yourself like that. I take back what I said. You gave me a jolt for
  a minute, that&rsquo;s all. But you&rsquo;ve got the wrong dope somehow,
  Nicolo. Whoever it was, it wasn&rsquo;t Dave Henderson. The man was too badly
  smashed up to be recognized, but there was at least some of his clothing
  left. Dave Henderson was followed all day yesterday by the police from the
  minute he left the penitentiary, and he didn&rsquo;t buy any clothes. Dave
  Henderson had on a black prison suit&mdash;and this man hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano shrugged his shoulders in angry contempt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied, if you are!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Go on&mdash;get
  out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barjan frowned a little helplessly now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not satisfied,&rdquo; he admitted earnestly. &ldquo;Look
  here, Nicolo, for the love of Mike, keep your temper, and let&rsquo;s get
  to the bottom of this. For some reason you seem to think it was Dave Henderson.
  I know it wasn&rsquo;t; but I&rsquo;ve got to know what started you off on
  that track. Those clothes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a damn fool!&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano, apparently slightly
  mollified, was jeering now. &ldquo;Those clothes&mdash;ha, ha! It is like
  the police! And so old Nicolo is off his nut&mdash;eh? Well, I will show
  you!&rdquo; He raised his voice and called his daughter. &ldquo;Teresa,
  my little one,&rdquo; he said, as the door opened and she appeared, &ldquo;bring
  me the clothes that young man had on last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say!&rdquo; exclaimed Barjan in sudden excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Nicolo Capriano ungraciously.</p>
  <p>Teresa was back in a moment with an armful of clothing, which, at her father&rsquo;s
  direction, she deposited on the foot of the bed.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano waved her from the room. He leered at Barjan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, are those the clothes there that you and your police are using
  to blindfold your eyes with, or are they not&mdash;eh? Are those Dave Henderson&rsquo;s
  clothes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barjan had already pounced upon the clothing, and was pawing it over feverishly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God&mdash;yes!&rdquo; he burst out sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the clothes that the dead man had on&mdash;let me see&rdquo;&mdash;Nicolo
  Capriano&rsquo;s voice was tauntingly triumphant, as, with eyes half closed,
  visualizing for himself the attire of one Ignace Ferroni, he slowly enumerated
  the various articles of dress worn by the actual victim of the explosion.
  He looked at Barjan maliciously, as he finished. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;was
  there enough left of what the man had on to identify any of those things?
  If so&mdash;&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano shrugged his shoulders by way of finality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; Barjan&rsquo;s excitement was almost beyond his
  control. &ldquo;Yes, that is what he wore, but&mdash;good Lord, Capriano!&mdash;what
  does this mean? I don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About the clothes?&rdquo; inquired Nicolo Capriano caustically. &ldquo;But
  I should know what he had on since they were <i>my</i> clothes&mdash;eh?
  And you have only to look at the ones there on the bed to find out for yourself
  why I gave him some that, though I do not say they were new, for I have not
  bought any clothes in the three damnable and cursed years that I have lain
  here, were at least not all torn to pieces&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barjan was pacing up and down the room now. When the other&rsquo;s back
  was turned, Nicolo Capriano permitted a sinister and mocking smile to hover
  on his lips; when Barjan faced the bed, Nicolo Capriano eyed the officer
  with a sour contempt into which he injected a sort of viciously triumphant
  self-vindication.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come across with the rest!&rdquo; said Barjan abruptly. &ldquo;How
  did Dave Henderson come here to you? And what about that bomb? Did you give
  it to him?&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s convenient irascibility was instantly
  at his command again. He scowled at Barjan, and his scranny fist was flourished
  under Barjan&rsquo;s nose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;And you know well enough
  that I didn&rsquo;t. You will try to make me out the guilty man now&mdash;eh&mdash;just
  because I was fool enough to help you out of your muddle!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barjan became diplomatic again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind!&rdquo; he said appeasingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  too touchy, Nicolo! I know that you&rsquo;re on the square all right, and
  that you have been ever since your gang was broken up and Tony Lomazzi was
  caught. That&rsquo;s good enough, isn&rsquo;t it? Now, come on! Give me the
  dope about Dave Henderson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s fingers plucked sullenly at the coverlet. A minute
  passed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he grunted finally. &ldquo;A little honey&mdash;eh&mdash;when
  you want something from old Nicolo! Well, then, listen! Dave Henderson came
  here last night in those torn clothes, and with his face badly cut from a
  fight that he said he had been in. I don&rsquo;t know whether his story is
  true or not&mdash;you can find that out for yourself. I don&rsquo;t know
  anything about him, but this is what he told me. He said that his cell in
  the prison was next to Tony Lomazzi&rsquo;s; that he and Tony were friends;
  that Tony died a little while ago; and that on the night Tony died he told
  this fellow Henderson to come to me if he needed any help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Barjan&rsquo;s voice was eager. He dropped into the chair
  again, and leaned attentively over the bed toward Nicolo Capriano. &ldquo;So
  he came to you through Tony Lomazzi, eh? Well, so far, I guess the story&rsquo;s
  straight. I happen to know that Henderson&rsquo;s cell was next to Lomazzi&rsquo;s.
  But where did he get the bomb? He certainly didn&rsquo;t have it when he
  left the prison, and he was shadowed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you said before!&rdquo; interrupted Nicolo Capriano caustically. &ldquo;Well,
  in that case, you ought to know whether the rest of the story is true, too,
  or not. He said he met a stranger in a saloon last night, and that they chummed
  up together, and started in to make a night of it. They went from one saloon
  to another. Their spree ended in a fight at Vinetto&rsquo;s place up the
  block here, where Henderson and his friend were attacked by some of Baldy
  Vickers&rsquo; gang. Henderson said his friend was knocked out, and that
  he himself had a narrow squeak of it, and just managed to escape through
  the back door, and ran down the lane, and got in here. I asked him how he
  knew where I lived, and he said that during the afternoon he had located
  the house because he meant to come here last night anyway, only he was afraid
  the police might be watching him, and he had intended to wait until after
  dark.&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s eyelids drooped to hide a sudden cunning
  and mocking gleam that was creeping into them. &ldquo;You ought to be able
  to trace this friend of Henderson&rsquo;s if the man was knocked out and
  unconscious at Vinetto&rsquo;s, as Henderson claimed&mdash;and if Henderson
  was telling the truth, the other would corroborate it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already got him,&rdquo; said Barjan, with a hint of savagery
  in his voice. The &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; alias a plain-clothesman, had proved
  anything but an inspiration from the standpoint of the police! &ldquo;Go
  on! The story is still straight. You say that Dave Henderson said he intended
  to come here anyway, quite apart from making his escape from Vinetto&rsquo;s.
  What for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money, I dare say,&rdquo; he said tersely. &ldquo;The usual thing!
  At least, I suppose that&rsquo;s what he had originally intended to come
  for&mdash;but we didn&rsquo;t get as far as that. The fight at Vinetto&rsquo;s
  seemed to have left him with but one idea. When he got here he was in a devil&rsquo;s
  rage. The only thing that seemed to be in his mind was to get some clothes
  that wouldn&rsquo;t attract attention, instead of the torn ones he had on,
  and to get out again as soon as he could with the object of getting even
  with this gang of Baldy&rsquo;s. He said they were the ones that &lsquo;sent
  him up&rsquo; on account of their evidence at his trial, and that they were
  after him again now because of the stolen money that they believed he had
  hidden somewhere. He was like a maniac. He said he&rsquo;d see them and everybody
  else in hell before they got that money, and he swore he&rsquo;d get every
  last one of that gang&mdash;and get them in a bunch. I didn&rsquo;t know
  what he meant then. I tried to quiet him down, but I might as well have talked
  to a wild beast. I tried to get him to stay here and go to bed&mdash;instead,
  he laughed at me in a queer sort of way, and said he&rsquo;d wipe every one
  of that crowd off the face of the earth before morning. I began to think
  he was really crazy. He put on the clothes I gave him, and went out again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barjan nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; he said quietly; &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s
  where the police lost track of him&mdash;when he ran in here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even know the police were after him,&rdquo; said Nicolo
  Capriano indifferently. &ldquo;He came back here again about two o&rsquo;clock
  this morning, and he had a small clockwork bomb with him. The fool!&rdquo; Nicolo
  Capriano cackled suddenly. &ldquo;He had found Baldy&rsquo;s gang all together
  down in Jake Morrissey&rsquo;s, and he had thrown the thing against the building.
  The fool! Of course, it wouldn&rsquo;t go off! He thought it would by hitting
  it against something. The only way to make it any good was to open the casing
  and set the clockwork. When he found it didn&rsquo;t explode, he picked it
  up again, and brought it back here. He wanted me to fix it for him. I asked
  him where he got it. All I could get out of him was that Tony Lomazzi had
  told him where he had hidden some things. Ha, ha!&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano
  cackled more shrilly still, and began to rock in bed with unseemly mirth. &ldquo;One
  of Tony&rsquo;s old bombs! Tony left the young fool a legacy&mdash;a bomb,
  and maybe there was some money, too. I tried to find out about that, but
  all he said was to keep asking me to fix the bomb for him. I refused. I told
  him I was no longer in that business. That I went out of it when Tony Lomazzi
  did&mdash;fifteen years ago. He would listen to nothing. He cursed me. I
  did not think he could do any harm with the thing&mdash;and I guess he didn&rsquo;t!
  A young fool like that is best out of the way. He went away cursing me. I
  suppose he tried to fix it himself under that arc light on the park bench.&rdquo; Nicolo
  Capriano shrugged his shoulders again. &ldquo;I would not have cared to open
  the thing myself&mdash;it was made too long ago, eh? The clockwork might
  have played tricks even with me, who once was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Barjan. He stood up. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s
  good enough, and I guess that&rsquo;s the end of Dave Henderson&mdash;and
  one hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo; He frowned in a meditative sort of way. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m sorry, or not,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d
  have got him sooner or later, of course, but&mdash;&rdquo; He pointed abruptly
  to the prison clothes on the bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll, take those,&rdquo; he announced
  briskly; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll need them at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some paper in the bottom drawer of that wardrobe over
  there,&rdquo; said Nicolo Capriano unconcernedly. &ldquo;You can wrap them
  up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barjan, with a nod of thanks, secured the paper, made a bundle of the clothes,
  and tucked the bundle under his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t forget this, Nicolo,&rdquo; he said heartily, as he
  moved toward the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Nicolo Capriano, with a scowl. &ldquo;I know how
  much that is worth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He listened attentively as Teresa showed the plain-clothesman out through
  the front door. As the door closed again, he called his daughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen, my little one,&rdquo; he said, and his forefinger was laid
  against the side of his nose in a gesture of humorous confidence. &ldquo;I
  will tell you something. Ignace Ferroni, who was fool enough to blow himself
  up, has become the young man whom our good friend Tony Lomazzi sent to us
  last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Her eyes widened in sudden amazement, not unmixed
  with alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You understand, my little one?&rdquo; He wagged his head, and cackled
  softly. &ldquo;Not a word! You understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said doubtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; grunted the old bomb king. &ldquo;I think Barjan has
  swallowed the hook. But I trust no one. I must be sure&mdash;you understand&mdash;<i>sure!</i> Go
  and telephone Emmanuel, and tell him to find Little Peter, and send the scoundrel
  to me at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is for Tony Lomazzi,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>She went from the room.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano lay back on the pillows, and closed his eyes. He might have
  been asleep again, for the smile on his lips was as guileless as a child&rsquo;s;
  and it remained there until an hour later, when, after motioning Teresa,
  who had opened the door, away, he propped himself up on his elbow to greet
  a wizened, crafty-faced little rat of the underworld, who stood at the bedside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is like the old days to see you here, Little Peter,&rdquo; murmured
  Nicolo Capriano. &ldquo;And I always paid well&mdash;eh? You have not forgotten
  that? Well, I will pay well again. Listen! I am sure that the man who was
  killed with the bomb in the park last night was a prison bird by the name
  of Dave Henderson; and I told the police so. But it is always possible that
  I have made a mistake. I do not think so&mdash;but it is always possible&mdash;eh?
  Well, I must know, Little Peter. The police will investigate further, and
  so will Baldy Vickers&rsquo; gang&mdash;they had it in for the fellow. You
  are a clever little devil, Little Peter. Find out if the police have discovered
  anything that would indicate I am wrong, and do the same with Baldy Vickers&rsquo; gang.
  You know them all, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The wizened little rat grinned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; he said, out of the corner of his mouth. &ldquo;Youse
  can leave it to me, Nicolo. I&rsquo;m wise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano patted the other&rsquo;s arm approvingly, and smiled the
  man away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You have the whole day before you, Little Peter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
  am in no hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Once more Nicolo Capriano lay back on his pillows, and closed his eyes,
  and once more the guileless smile hovered over his lips.</p>
  <p>At intervals through the day he murmured and communed with himself, and
  sometimes his cackling laugh brought Teresa to the door; but for the most
  part he lay there through the hours with the placid, cunning patience that
  the school of long experience had brought him.</p>
  <p>It was dusk when Little Peter stood at the bedside again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse called de turn, Nicolo,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Dat was de guy,
  all right. I got next to some of de fly-cops, an&rsquo; dey ain&rsquo;t got
  no doubt about it. Dey handed it out to de reporters.&rdquo; He flipped a
  newspaper that he was carrying onto the bed. &ldquo;Youse can read it for
  yerself. An&rsquo; de gang sizes it up de same way. I pulled de window stunt
  on &rsquo;em down at Morrissey&rsquo;s about an hour ago. Dey was all dere&mdash;Baldy,
  an&rsquo; Runty Mott, an&rsquo; all de rest&mdash;an&rsquo; another guy,
  too. Say, I didn&rsquo;t know dat Bookie Skarvan pulled in wid dat mob. Dey
  was fightin&rsquo; like a lot of stray cats, an&rsquo; dey was sore as pups,
  an&rsquo; all blamin&rsquo; de other one for losin&rsquo; de money. De only
  guy in de lot dat kept his head was Bookie. He sat dere chewin&rsquo; a big
  fat cigar, an&rsquo; wigglin&rsquo; it from one corner of his mouth to de
  other, an&rsquo; he handed &rsquo;em some talk. He give &rsquo;em hell for
  mussin&rsquo; everything up. Say, Nicolo, take it from me, youse want to
  keep yer eye peeled for him. He says to de crowd: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a cinch
  dat Dave Henderson&rsquo;s dead, thanks to de damned mess youse have made
  of everything,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a cinch dat Capriano&rsquo;s
  story in de paper is straight&mdash;it&rsquo;s too full of de real dope to
  be anything else. But if Dave Henderson told old Capriano dat much, he may
  have told him more&mdash;see? Old Capriano&rsquo;s a wily bird, an&rsquo; wid
  a hundred thousand in sight de old Dago wouldn&rsquo;t be asleep. Anyway,
  it&rsquo;s our last chance&mdash;dat Capriano got de hidin&rsquo; place out
  of Dave Henderson. But here&rsquo;s where de rest of youse keeps yer mitts
  off. If it&rsquo;s de last chance, I&rsquo;ll see dat it ain&rsquo;t gummed
  up. I&rsquo;ll take care of Capriano myself.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Little Peter circled his lips with his tongue, as Nicolo Capriano extracted
  a banknote of generous denomination from under his pillow, and handed it
  to the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very good, Little Peter!&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;very
  good! But you have already forgotten it all&mdash;eh? Is it not so, Little
  Peter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Little Peter earnestly. &ldquo;Sure&mdash;youse
  can bet yer life I have!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-by then, Little Peter,&rdquo; said Nicolo Capriano softly again.</p>
  <p>He stared for a long while at the door, as it closed behind the other&mdash;stared
  and smiled curiously, and plucked with his fingers at the coverlet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so they would watch old bed-ridden Nicolo, would they&mdash;while
  Nicolo watches&mdash;eh&mdash;somewhere else!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Ha,
  ha! So they will watch old Nicolo&mdash;will they! Well, well, let them watch&mdash;eh?&rdquo; He
  looked around the room, and raised himself up in bed. He began to rock to
  and fro. A red tinge crept into his cheeks, a gleam of fire lighted up the
  coal-black eyes. &ldquo;Nicolo, Nicolo,&rdquo; he whispered to himself, &ldquo;it
  is like the old days back again, Nicolo&mdash;and it is like the old wine
  to make the blood run quick in the veins again.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  The Mantle Of One Ignace Ferroni</b></h2>
  <p>UP and down the small, ill-furnished room Dave Henderson paced back and
  forward, as, not so very long ago, he had paced by the hour from the rear
  wall of his cell to the barred door that opened on an iron gallery without.
  And he paced the distance now with the old nervous, pent-up energy that rebelled
  and mutinied and would not take passively to restraint, even when that restraint,
  as now, was self-imposed.</p>
  <p>It had just grown dark. The window shade was tightly drawn. On the table,
  beside the remains of the supper that Emmanuel had brought him some little
  time before, a small lamp furnished a meager light, and threw the corners
  of the room into shadow.</p>
  <p>He had seen no one save Emmanuel since last night, when he had left Nicolo
  Capriano&rsquo;s. He had not heard from Nicolo Capriano. It was the sense
  of personal impotency, the sense of personal inactivity that filled him with
  a sort of savage, tigerish impatience now. There were many things to do outside
  in that world beyond the drawn window shade&mdash;and he could only wait!
  There was the pigeon-cote in Tooler&rsquo;s shed, for instance. All during
  the day the pigeon-cote had been almost an obsession with him. There was
  a chance&mdash;one chance in perhaps a million&mdash;that for some reason
  or other Millman had not been able to get there. It was a gambling chance&mdash;no
  more, no less&mdash;with the odds so heavily against Millman permitting anything
  to keep him from getting his hands on a fortune in ready cash that, from
  a material standpoint, there was hardly any use in his, Dave Henderson, going
  there. But that did not remove the ever present, and, as opposed to the material,
  the intangible sense of uncertainty that possessed him. He expected to find
  the money gone; he would be a fool a thousand times over to expect anything
  else. But he had to satisfy himself, and he would&mdash;if that keen old
  brain of Nicolo Capriano only succeeded in devising some means of throwing
  the police definitely off the trail.</p>
  <p>But it was not so easy to throw the police definitely off the trail, as
  Nicolo Capriano himself had said. He, Dave Henderson, was ready to agree
  in that with the crafty old Italian; and, even after these few hours, cooped
  up in here, he was even more ready to agree with the other that the mere
  hiding of himself away from the police was utterly abortive as far as the
  accomplishment of any conclusive end was concerned.</p>
  <p>It was far from easy; though, acting somewhat as a panacea to his impatience,
  the old Italian had inspired him with faith as being more than a match for
  the police, and yet&mdash;</p>
  <p>He gnawed at his lips. He, too, had not been idle through the day; he, too,
  had tried to find some way, some loophole that would enable him, once he
  went out into the open again, to throw Barjan, and all that Barjan stood
  for, conclusively and forever off his track. And the more he had thought
  of it, the more insurmountable the difficulty and seeming impossibility of
  doing so had become. It had even shaken his faith a little in Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s
  fox-like cunning proving equal to the occasion. He couldn&rsquo;t, for instance,
  live all his life in disguise. That did very well perhaps as a piece of fiction,
  but practically it offered very little attraction!</p>
  <p>He frowned&mdash;and laughed a little harshly at himself. He was illogical
  again. He had asked only for three or four days, for a fighting chance, just
  time enough to get on Millman&rsquo;s trail, hadn&rsquo;t he? And now he
  was greedy for a permanent and enduring safe-conduct from the police, and
  his brain mulled and toiled with that objective alone in view, and he stood
  here now employed in gnawing his lips because he could not see the way, or
  see how Nicolo Capriano could find it, either. He shrugged his shoulders.
  As well dismiss that! If he could but reach Millman&mdash;and, after Millman,
  Bookie Skarvan&mdash;just to pay the debts he owed, then&mdash;</p>
  <p>His hand that had curled into a clenched fist, with knuckles showing like
  white knobs under the tight-stretched skin, relaxed, as, following a low,
  quick knock at the door, Emmanuel stepped into the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I gotta da message for you from Nicolo,&rdquo; Emmanuel announced; &ldquo;an&rsquo; I
  gotta da letter for you from Nicolo, too. You get-a damn sick staying in
  here, eh? Well, Nicolo say you go to his place see him tonight. We take-a
  da car by-an&rsquo;-by, an&rsquo; go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk, Emmanuel!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson, with
  terse heartiness. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, Emmanuel, and so is your
  room and your grub, but a little fresh air is what I am looking for, and
  the sooner the better!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took the envelope that Emmanuel extended, crossed over to the lamp, and
  turned his back on the other, as he ripped the envelope open. Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s
  injunction had been to say nothing to Emmanuel, and&mdash; He was staring
  blankly at the front page of the evening newspaper, all that the envelope
  contained, and which he had now unfolded before him. And then he caught his
  breath sharply. He was either crazy, or his eyes were playing him tricks.
  A thrill that he suppressed by an almost superhuman effort of will, a thrill
  that tore and fought at the restraint he put upon it, because he was afraid
  that the mad, insane uplift that it promised was but some fantastic hallucination,
  swept over him. There was a lead pencil circle drawn around the captions
  of one of the columns; and three written words, connected to the circle by
  another pencil stroke, leaped up at him from the margin of the paper:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>You are dead</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He felt the blood surging upward in his veins to beat like the blows of
  a trip-hammer at his temples. The words were not blurred and running together
  any more, the captions, instead, inside that circle, seemed to stand out
  in such huge startling type that they dominated the entire page:</p>
  <p align="center" class="note">MAN BLOWN TO PIECES BY BOMB IDENTIFIED<br>
  MYSTERY IS EXPLAINED</p>
  <p align="center" class="note">DAVE HENDERSON, EX-CONVICT,<br>
  VICTIM OF HIS OWN MURDEROUS INTENTIONS</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson glanced over his shoulder. Behind him, Emmanuel was clatteringly
  piling up the supper dishes on the tray. He turned again to the newspaper,
  and read Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s story, all of it now&mdash;and laughed.
  He remembered the old Italian&rsquo;s tale of the man Ignace Ferroni and
  his bomb. Nicolo Capriano, for all his age and infirmity, was still without
  his peer in craft and cunning! The ingenious use of enough of what was true
  had stamped the utterly false as beyond the shadow of a suspicion that it,
  too, was not as genuine as the connecting links that held the fabric together.
  He warmed to the old Italian, an almost hysterical admiration upon him for
  Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s guile. But transcending all other emotions was the
  sense of freedom. It surged upon him, possessing him; it brought exhilaration,
  and it brought a grim, unholy vista of things to come&mdash;a goal within
  possibility of reach now&mdash;Millman first, and then Bookie Skarvan. He
  was free&mdash;free as the air. He was dead. Dave Henderson had passed out
  of the jurisdiction of the police. To the police he was now but a memory&mdash;he
  was dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are dead.&rdquo; A queer tight smile thinned his lips, as his
  eyes fell again upon the penciled words at the margin of the paper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder they never got anything on old Capriano!&rdquo; he
  muttered; and began to tear the paper into shreds.</p>
  <p>He was free! He was dead! He was impatient now to exercise that freedom.
  He could walk out on the streets with no more disguise than these cast-off
  clothes he had on, plus the brim of his hat to shade his face&mdash;for Dave
  Henderson was dead. Neither Bookie Skarvan, nor Baldy Vickers would be searching
  for a dead man any more&mdash;nor would the police. He swung around, and
  faced Emmanuel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am to go to Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s, eh?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well,
  then, let&rsquo;s go; I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No make-a da rush,&rdquo; smiled Emmanuel. &ldquo;Capriano say you
  gotta da time, plenty time. Capriano say come over by-an&rsquo;-by in da
  car.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson shook his head impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; we&rsquo;ll go now,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
  <p>Emmanuel in turn shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I gotta some peep&rsquo; downstairs in da restaurant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
  gotta stay maybe an hour yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson considered this for a moment. He could walk out on the streets
  now quite freely. It was no longer necessary that he should be hidden in
  a car. But Nicolo Capriano had told Emmanuel to use the car. Emmanuel would
  not understand, and he, Dave Henderson, had no intention of enlightening
  the other why a car was no longer necessary. Neither was Emmanuel himself
  necessary&mdash;there was Mrs. Tooler&rsquo;s pigeon-cote. If he went there
  before going to Nicolo Capriano! His brain was racing now. Yes, the car, <i>without
  Emmanuel</i>, would be a great convenience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he said crisply. &ldquo;You stay here, and look
  after your restaurant. There&rsquo;s no need for you to come. I&rsquo;ll
  take the car myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You drive-a da car?&rdquo; asked Emmanuel dubiously. Dave Henderson
  laughed quietly. The question awakened a certain and very pertinent memory.
  There were those who, if they chose to do so, could testify with some eloquence
  to his efficiency at the wheel of a car!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I have driven one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I guess I can handle
  that old bus of yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;Emmanuel was still dubious&mdash;&ldquo;Capriano
  say no take-a da risk of being seen on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking for any risk myself,&rdquo; interposed Dave
  Henderson coolly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dark now, and there&rsquo;s no chance
  of anybody recognizing me while I&rsquo;m driving a car. Forget it, Emmanuel!
  Come on! I don&rsquo;t want to stick around here for another hour. Here!&rdquo;&mdash;from
  his pocket he produced a banknote, and pushed it across the table to the
  other.</p>
  <p>Emmanuel grinned. His doubts had vanished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Emmanuel. He tiptoed to the door, looked out, listened,
  and jerked his head reassuringly in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;Getta
  da move on, then! We go down by da back stairs. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They gained the back yard, and the small shed that did duty for a garage&mdash;and
  in a few moments more Dave Henderson, at the wheel of the car, was out on
  the street.</p>
  <p>He drove slowly at first. He had paid no attention to the route taken by
  Emmanuel when they had left Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s the night before, and
  as a consequence he had little or no idea in what part of the city Emmanuel&rsquo;s
  restaurant was located; but at the expiration of a few minutes he got his
  bearings, and the speed of the car quickened instantly.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
      <i>Con Amore</i></b></h2>
  <p>TEN minutes later, the car left at the curb half a block away, Dave Henderson
  was crouched in the darkness at the door of old Tooler&rsquo;s shed that
  opened on the lane. There was a grim set to his lips. There seemed a curious
  analogy in all this&mdash;this tool even with which he worked upon the door
  to force it open, this chisel that he had taken from the kit under the seat
  of Emmanuel&rsquo;s car, as once before from under the seat of another car
  he had taken a chisel&mdash;with one hundred thousand dollars as his object
  in view. He had got the money then, and lost it, and had nearly lost his
  life as well, and now&mdash;</p>
  <p>He steeled himself, as the door opened silently under his hand; steeled
  himself against the hope, which somehow seemed to be growing upon him, that
  Millman might never have got here after all; steeled himself against disappointment
  where logic told him disappointment had no place at all, since he was but
  a fool to harbor any hope. And yet&mdash;and yet there were a thousand things,
  a thousand unforeseen contingencies which might have turned the tables upon
  Millman! The money <i>might</i> still be here. And if it were! He was dead
  now&mdash;and free to use it! Free! His lips thinned into a straight line.</p>
  <p>The door closed noiselessly behind him. The flashlight in his hand, also
  borrowed from Emmanuel&rsquo;s car, played around the shed. It was the same
  old place, perhaps a little more down-at-the-heels, perhaps a little dirtier,
  a little more cumbered up with odds and ends than it had been five years
  before, but there was no other change. And there was the door of the pigeon-cote
  above him, that he could just reach from the ground.</p>
  <p>He moved toward it now with a swift, impulsive step, and snarled in sudden
  anger at himself, as he found his hand trembling with excitement, causing
  the flashlight to throw a jerky, wavering ray on the old pigeon-cote door.
  What was the use of that! He expected nothing, didn&rsquo;t he? The pigeon-cote
  would be empty; he knew that well enough. And yet he was playing the fool.
  He knew quite well it would be empty; he had prepared himself thoroughly
  to expect nothing else.</p>
  <p>He reached up, opened the door, and felt inside. His hand encountered a
  moldy litter of chaff and straw. He reached further in, with quick eagerness,
  the full length of his arm. He remembered that he had pushed the package
  into the corner, and had covered it with straw.</p>
  <p>For a minute, for two full minutes, his fingers, by the sense of touch,
  sifted through the chaff, first slowly, methodically, then with a sort of
  frantic abandon; and then, in another moment, he had stooped to the floor,
  seized an old box, and, standing upon it, had thrust head and shoulders into
  the old pigeon-cote, while the flashlight&rsquo;s ray swept every crevice
  of the interior, and he pawed and turned up the chaff and straw where even
  it lay but a bare inch deep and only one bereft of his senses could expect
  it to conceal anything.</p>
  <p>He withdrew himself from the opening, and closed the pigeon-cote door again,
  and stood down on the floor. He laughed at himself in a low, bitter, merciless
  way. He had expected nothing, of course; he had expected only to find what
  he had found&mdash;nothing. He had told himself that, hadn&rsquo;t he? Quite
  convinced himself of it, hadn&rsquo;t he? Well, then, what did it matter?
  His hands, clenched, went suddenly above his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I paid five years for that,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Do you hear,
  Millman&mdash;five years&mdash;five years! And I&rsquo;ll get you&mdash;Millman!
  I&rsquo;ll get you for this, Millman&mdash;are you listening?&mdash;whether
  you are in New York&mdash;or hell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He put the box upon which he had stood back in its place, went out of the
  shed, closed the door behind him, and made his way back to the car. He drove
  quickly now, himself driven by the feverish, intolerant passion that had
  him in its grip. He was satisfied now. There were not any more doubts. He
  knew! Well, he would go to Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s, and then&mdash;his hands
  gripped fiercely on the steering wheel. He was dead! Ha, ha! Dave Henderson
  was dead&mdash;but Millman was still alive!</p>
  <p>It was not far to Capriano&rsquo;s. He left the car where Emmanuel had awaited
  him the night before, and gained the back porch of Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s
  house.</p>
  <p>Teresa&rsquo;s voice from the other side of the closed door answered his
  knock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>He laughed low, half in facetiousness, half in grim humor. He was in a curious
  mood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The dead man,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
  <p>There was no light in the porch to-night. She opened the door, and, as he
  stepped inside, closed it behind him again. He could not see her in the darkness&mdash;and
  somehow, suddenly, quite unreasonably, he found the situation awkward, and
  his tongue, as it had been the night before, awkward, too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he blurted out, &ldquo;your father&rsquo;s got some clever
  head, all right!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has he?&rdquo; Her voice seemed strangely quiet and subdued, a hint
  of listlessness and weariness in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you know about it, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You
  know what he did, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I know,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But he has been waiting
  for you, and he is impatient, and we had better go at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Tony Lomazzi! He remembered her grief when he had told her last night
  that Tony was dead. That was what was the matter with her, he decided, as
  he followed her along the passageway. She must have thought a good deal of
  Tony Lomazzi&mdash;more even than her father did. He wished again that he
  had not broken the news to her in the blunt, brutal way he had&mdash;only
  he had not known then, of course, that Tony had meant so much to her. He
  found himself wondering why now. She could not have had anything to do with
  Tony Lomazzi for fifteen years, and fifteen years ago she could have been
  little more than a child. True, she might perhaps have visited the prison,
  but&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, my young friend&mdash;eh?&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s voice
  greeted him, as he followed Teresa into the old Italian&rsquo;s room. &ldquo;So
  Ignace Ferroni has done you a good turn&mdash;eh? And old Nicolo! Eh&mdash;what
  have you to say about old Nicolo? Did I not tell you that you could leave
  it to old Nicolo to find a way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson caught the other&rsquo;s outstretched hand, and wrung it
  hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
  pulled the slickest thing I ever heard of, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano was chuckling delightedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind the thanks, my young friend. You owe me none. The old
  fingers had the itch in them to play the cards against the police once more.
  And the police&mdash;eh?&mdash;I do not like the police. Well, perhaps we
  are quits now! Ha, ha! Do you know Barjan? Barjan is a very clever little
  man, too&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;Barjan and old Nicolo have known each other
  many years. And that is what Barjan said&mdash;just what you said&mdash;that
  he would not forget. Well, we are all pleased&mdash;eh? But we do not stop
  at that. Old Nicolo does not do things by halves. You will still need help,
  my young friend. You will go at once to New York&mdash;eh? That is what you
  intend to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you will find your man&mdash;and the money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips thinned suddenly. &ldquo;If
  he is in New York, as I believe he is, I will find him; if not&mdash;then
  I will find him just the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again Nicolo Capriano nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, my young friend, I like you!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;If I
  had had you&mdash;eh?&mdash;fifteen years ago! We would have gone far&mdash;eh?
  And Tony went no farther than a prison cell. But we waste time&mdash;eh?
  Old Nicolo is not through yet&mdash;a Capriano does not do things by halves.
  You will need help and friends in New York. Nicolo Capriano will see to that.
  And money to get to New York&mdash;eh? You will need some ready money for
  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s eyes met Teresa&rsquo;s. She stood there, a slim,
  straight figure, just inside the door, the light glinting on her raven hair.
  She seemed somehow, with those wondrous eyes of hers, to be making an analysis
  of him, an analysis that went deeper than a mere appraisal of his features
  and his clothes&mdash;and a little frown came and puckered the white brow&mdash;and,
  quick in its wake, with a little start of confusion, there came a heightened
  tinge of color to her cheeks, and she lowered her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Teresa, my little one,&rdquo; said Nicolo Capriano softly, &ldquo;go
  and get some paper and an envelope, and pen and ink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson watched her as she left the room.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s fingers, from plucking at the counterpane, tapped
  gently on Dave Henderson&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We were speaking of money&mdash;for your immediate needs,&rdquo; Nicolo
  Capriano suggested pleasantly.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have enough to keep me going for a while,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
  <p>The old bomb king&rsquo;s eyebrows were slightly elevated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So! But you are just out of prison&mdash;and you said yourself that
  the police had followed you closely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson laughed shortly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t very difficult,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had a
  friend who owed me some money before I went to the pen&mdash;some I had won
  on the race-track. I gave the police the slip without very much trouble last
  night in order to get here, and it was a good deal more of a cinch to put
  it over them long enough to get that money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said Nicolo Capriano again. &ldquo;And this friend&mdash;what
  is his name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson hesitated. He had seen to it that Square John Kelly was clear
  of this, and he was reluctant now, even to this man here to whom he owed
  a debt beyond repayment, to bring Square John into the matter at all; yet,
  on the other hand, in this particular instance, it could make very little
  difference. If Square John was involved, Nicolo Capriano was involved a hundredfold
  deeper. And then, too, Nicolo Capriano might very well, and with very good
  reason, be curious to know how he, Dave Henderson, could, under the circumstances,
  have come into the possession of a sum of money adequate for his present
  needs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather keep his name out of it,&rdquo; he said frankly; &ldquo;but
  I guess you&rsquo;ve got a right to ask about anything you like, and if you
  insist I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s eyes were half closed&mdash;and they were fixed
  on the foot of the bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I would like to know,&rdquo; he said, after a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right! It was Square John Kelly,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson quietly&mdash;and
  recounted briefly the details of his visit to the Pacific Coral Saloon the
  night before.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano had propped himself up in bed. He leaned over now as Dave
  Henderson finished, and patted Dave Henderson&rsquo;s shoulder in a sort
  of exultant excitement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good! Excellent!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Ah, my young friend,
  I begin to love you! It brings back the years that are gone. But&mdash;bah!&mdash;I
  shall get well again&mdash;eh? And I am not yet too old&mdash;eh? Who can
  tell&mdash;eh?&mdash;who can tell! We would be invincible, you and I, and&mdash;&rdquo; He
  checked himself, as Teresa reentered the room. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;Well, then, as far as money is concerned, you are supplied;
  but friends&mdash;eh?&mdash;are sometimes more important than money. You
  have found that out already&mdash;eh? Listen, then, I will give you a letter
  to a friend in New York whom you can trust&mdash;and I promise you he will
  stop at nothing to carry out my orders. You understand? His name is Georges
  Vardi, but he is commonly known as Dago George; and he, too, was one of us
  in the old days. You will want somewhere to go. He keeps a little hotel,
  a very <i>quiet</i> little hotel off the Bowery, not far from Chatham Square.
  Any one will tell you there where to find Dago George. You understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano motioned his daughter abruptly to a small table on the opposite
  side of the bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Teresa will write the letter, and put it in Italian,&rdquo; he said,
  as she seated herself at the table. &ldquo;I do not write as easily as I
  used to. They say old Nicolo is a sick man. Well, maybe that is so, but old
  Nicolo&rsquo;s brain is not sick, and old Nicolo&rsquo;s fingers can at least
  still sign his name&mdash;and that is enough. Ha, ha, it is good to be alive
  again! Well&rdquo;&mdash;he waved his hand again toward his daughter&mdash;&ldquo;are
  you ready, my little one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To Dago George, then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;First&mdash;my affectionate
  salutations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her pen scratched rapidly over the paper. She looked up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s fingers plucked at the coverlet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will say that the bearer of this letter&mdash;ah! Yes!&rdquo; He
  turned with a whimsical smile to Dave Henderson. &ldquo;You must have a name,
  eh, my young friend&mdash;since Dave Henderson is dead! We shall not tell
  Dago George everything. Fools alone tell all they know! What shall it be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. One is
  as good as another. Make it Barty Lynch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that will do. Good!&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano gestured with his
  hand in his daughter&rsquo;s direction again. &ldquo;You will say that the
  bearer of this letter is Barty Lynch, and that he is to be treated as though
  he were Nicolo Capriano himself. You understand, my little one? Anything
  that he asks is his&mdash;and I, Nicolo Capriano, will be responsible. Tell
  him, my little one, that it is Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s order&mdash;and that
  Nicolo Capriano has yet to be disobeyed. And particularly you will say that
  if our young friend here requires any help by those who know how to do what
  they are told and ask no questions, the men are to be supplied. You understand,
  Teresa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She did not look up this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Write it, then,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And see that Dago George is
  left with no doubt in his mind that he is at the command of our young friend
  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa&rsquo;s pen scratched rapidly again across the paper.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano was at his interminable occupation of plucking at the counterpane.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson pushed his hand through his hair in a curiously abstracted
  sort of way. There seemed to be something strangely and suddenly unreal about
  all this&mdash;about this man, with his cunning brain, who lay here in this
  queer four-poster bed; about that trim little figure, who bent over the table
  there, and whose profile only now was in view, the profile of a sweet, womanly
  face that somehow now seemed to be very earnest, for he could see the reflection
  of a puckered brow in the little nest of wrinkles at the corner of her eye.</p>
  <p>No, there wasn&rsquo;t anything unreal about her. She was very real.</p>
  <p>He remembered her as she had stood last night on the threshold there, and
  when in the lighted doorway he had seen her for the first time. He would
  never forget that&mdash;nor the smile that had followed the glorious flood
  of color in her cheeks, and that had lighted up her eyes, and that had forgiven
  him for his unconscious rudeness.</p>
  <p>That wasn&rsquo;t what was unreal. All that would remain living and vibrant,
  a picture that would endure, and that the years would not dim. It was unreal
  that in the space of a few minutes more everything here would have vanished
  forever out of his existence&mdash;this room with its vaguely foreign air,
  this four-poster bed with its strange occupant, whose mental vitality seemed
  to thrive on his physical weakness, that slimmer figure there bending over
  the table, whose masses of silken hair seemed to curl and cluster in a sort
  of proudly intimate affection about the arched, shapely neck, whose shoulders
  were molded in soft yielding lines that somehow invited the lingering touch
  of a hand, if one but had the right.</p>
  <p>His hand pushed its way again through his hair, and fumbled a little helplessly
  across his eyes. And, too, it was more than that that was unreal. A multitude
  of things seemed unreal&mdash;the years in the penitentiary during which
  he had racked his brain for a means of eluding the police, racked it until
  it had become a physical agony to think, were now dispelled by this man here,
  and with such ease that, as an accomplished, concrete fact, his mind somehow
  refused to accept it as such. He was dead. It was very strange, very curious!
  He sank back a little in his chair. There came a vista of New York&mdash;not
  as a tangible thing of great streets and vast edifices, but as a Mecca of
  his aspirations, now almost within his grasp, as an arena where he could
  stand unleashed, and where the iron of five years that had entered his soul
  should have a chance to vent itself. Millman was there! There seemed to come
  an unholy joy creeping upon him. Millman was there&mdash;and he, Dave Henderson,
  was dead, and in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s place would be a man in that arena
  who had friends now at his back, who could laugh at the police. Millman!
  He felt the blood sweep upward to his temples; he heard his knuckles crack,
  as his hand clenched in a fierce, sudden surge of fury. Millman! Yes, the
  way was clear to Millman&mdash;but there was another, too. Bookie Skarvan!</p>
  <p>His hand unclenched. He was quite cool, quite unconcerned again. Teresa
  had finished the letter, and Nicolo Capriano was reading it now. He could
  afford to wait as far as Bookie Skarvan was concerned&mdash;he could not
  afford to wait where Millman was concerned. And, besides, there was his own
  safety. Bookie Skarvan was here in San Francisco, but the further he, Dave
  Henderson, got from San Francisco for the present now, and the sooner, the
  better it would be. In a little while, a few months, after he had paid his
  debt to Millman&mdash;he would pay his debt to Bookie Skarvan. He was not
  likely to forget Bookie Skarvan!</p>
  <p>His eyes fell on Teresa. He might come back to San Francisco in a few months.
  With ordinary caution it ought to be quite safe then. Dave Henderson would
  have been dead quite long enough then to be utterly forgotten. They would
  not be talking on every street corner about him as they were to-night, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano was nodding his head approvingly over the letter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Excellent! With this, my young friend,
  you will be a far more important personage in New York than you imagine.
  Old Nicolo&rsquo;s arm still reaches far.&rdquo; He stared for a moment musingly
  at Dave Henderson through half closed eyes. &ldquo;You have money, and this
  letter. I do not think there is anything else that old Nicolo can do for
  you&mdash;eh?&mdash;except to give you a little advice. You will leave here
  shortly, and from that moment you must be very careful. Anywhere near San
  Francisco you might be recognized. Travel only by night at first&mdash;make
  of yourself a tramp and use the freight trains, and hide by day. After two
  or three days, which should have taken you a good many miles from here, you
  will be able to travel more comfortably. But still do not use the through
  express trains&mdash;the men on the dining and sleeping cars have all started
  from here, too, you must remember. You understand? Go slowly. Be very careful.
  You are not really safe until you are east of Chicago. I do not think there
  is anything else, unless&mdash;eh?&mdash;you are armed, my young friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; ejaculated Nicolo Capriano, and pursed his lips. &ldquo;And
  it would not be safe for you to buy a weapon to-night&mdash;eh?&mdash;and
  it might very well be that to-night you would need it badly. Well, it is
  easily remedied.&rdquo; He turned to his daughter. &ldquo;Teresa, my little
  one, I think we might let our young friend have that revolver upstairs in
  the bottom of the old box&mdash;and still not remain defenseless ourselves&mdash;eh?
  Yes, yes! Run and get it, Teresa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rose from her seat obediently, and turned toward the door&mdash;but
  her father stopped her with a quick impulsive gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Give me the pen before you go, and I
  will sign this letter. Dago George must be sure that it came from Nicolo
  Capriano&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She dipped the pen in the ink, and handed it to him. Nicolo Capriano propped
  the letter on his knees, as he motioned her away on her errand. His pen moved
  laboriously across the paper. He looked up then, and beckoned Dave Henderson
  to lean over the bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See, my young friend,&rdquo; he smiled&mdash;and pointed to his cramped
  writing. &ldquo;Old Nicolo&rsquo;s fingers are old and stiff, and it is
  a long while since Dago George has seen that signature&mdash;but, though
  I am certain he would know it again, I have made assurance doubly sure. See,
  I have signed: &lsquo;<i>Con Amore</i>, Nicolo Capriano.&rsquo; You do not
  know Italian&mdash;eh? Well, it is a simple phrase, a very common phrase.
  It means&mdash;&lsquo;with love.&rsquo; But to Dago George it means something
  else. It was a secret signal in the old days. A letter signed in that way
  by any one of us meant&mdash;&lsquo;trust to the death!&rsquo; You understand,
  my young friend?&rdquo; He smiled again, and patted Dave Henderson&rsquo;s
  arm. &ldquo;Give me the envelope there on the table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was inserting the letter in the envelope, as Teresa entered the room
  again. He sealed the envelope, reached out to her for the revolver which
  she carried, broke the revolver, nodded as he satisfied himself that it was
  loaded&mdash;and handed both envelope and weapon to Dave Henderson. He spread
  out his hands then, and lifted his shoulders in a whimsical gesture of finality.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is only left then to say good-by&mdash;eh?&mdash;my young friend&mdash;who
  was the friend of Tony Lomazzi. You will have good luck, and good fortune,
  and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson was on his feet. He had both of the old Italian&rsquo;s hands
  in his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will never forget what you have done&mdash;and I will never forget
  Nicolo Capriano,&rdquo; he said in a low tone, his voice suddenly choked.</p>
  <p>The old bomb king&rsquo;s eyelids fluttered down. It was like a blind man
  whose face was turned to Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sure of that, my young friend,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I
  am sure that you will never forget Nicolo Capriano. I shall hear of you through
  Dago George.&rdquo; He released his hands suddenly. His eyes opened&mdash;they
  were inscrutable, almost dead, without luster. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
  know what you would say. But we are not children to sob on one another&rsquo;s
  neck. Nicolo is not dead yet. Perhaps we will meet again&mdash;eh? We will
  not make a scene&mdash;Teresa will tell you that it might bring on an attack.
  Eh? Well, then, go! You will need all the hours from now until daylight to
  get well away from the city.&rdquo; He smiled again, and waved Dave Henderson
  from the bed.</p>
  <p>In an uncertain, reluctant way, as though conscious that his farewell to
  the old Italian was entirely inadequate, that his gratitude had found no
  expression, and yet conscious, too, that any attempt to express his feelings
  would be genuinely unwelcome to the other, Dave Henderson moved toward the
  door. Teresa had already passed out of the room, and was standing in the
  hall. On the threshold Dave Henderson paused, and looked back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-by, Nicolo Capriano!&rdquo; he called.</p>
  <p>The old Italian had sunk back on the pillows, his fingers busy with the
  counterpane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wine of life, my young friend&rdquo;&mdash;it was almost as though
  he were talking to himself&mdash;&ldquo;ha, ha!&mdash;the wine of life! The
  old days back again&mdash;the measured blades&mdash;the fight, and the rasp
  of steel! Ha, ha! Old Nicolo is not yet dead! Good-by&mdash;good-by, my young
  friend! It is old Nicolo who is in your debt; not you in his. Good-by, my
  young friend&mdash;good-by!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa&rsquo;s footsteps were already receding along the passageway toward
  the rear door. Dave Henderson, with a final wave of his hand to the old Italian,
  turned and walked slowly along the hall. He heard the porch door ahead of
  him being opened. He reached it, and halted, looking around him. It was dark,
  as it always was here, and he could see nothing&mdash;not even a faint, blurred
  outline of Teresa&rsquo;s form. Surprised, he called her name softly. There
  was no answer&mdash;only the door stood wide open.</p>
  <p>He stepped out into the porch. There was still no sign of her. It was very
  strange! He called her again&mdash;he only wanted to say good-by, to thank
  her, to tell her, as he had told her father, that he would not forget. And,
  yes, to tell her, too, if he could find the words, that some day he hoped
  that he might see her again. But there was no answer.</p>
  <p>He was frowning now, piqued, and a little angry. He did not understand&mdash;only
  that she had opened the door for him, and in some way had deliberately chosen
  to evade him. He did not know why&mdash;he could find no reason for it. He
  moved on through the porch. Perhaps she had preceded him as far as the lane.</p>
  <p>At the lane, he halted again, and again looked around him&mdash;and stood
  there hesitant. And then there reached him the sound of the porch door being
  closed and locked.</p>
  <p>He did not understand. It mystified him. It was not coquetry&mdash;there
  was no coquetry in those steady, self-reliant eyes, or in that strong, sweet
  face. And yet it had been deliberately done, and about it was something of
  finality&mdash;and his lips twisted in a hurt smile, as he turned and walked
  from the lane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beat it!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson to himself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  dead!&rdquo;</p>

  The House Of Mystery Draws Its Blinds</b></h2>
  <p>TERESA&rsquo;S fingers twisted the key in the lock of the porch door that
  she had closed on Dave Henderson. There was a queer, tight little smile quivering
  on her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was no other way,&rdquo; she whispered to herself. &ldquo;What
  could I do? What could I say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Behind her, and at one side of the passage, was a small panel door, long
  out of use now, a relic of those days when Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s dwelling
  had been a house of mystery. She had hidden there to let Dave Henderson pass
  by; she closed it now, as she retraced her steps slowly to her father&rsquo;s
  room. And here, on the threshold, she paused for a moment; then reached in
  quietly to close the door, and retire again. Her father lay back on the bed,
  his eyes closed, and his hands, outstretched on the coverlet, were quiet,
  the long, slim fingers motionless. He was asleep. It was not uncommon. He
  often did that. Sleep came at the oddest times with the old man, even if
  it did not last long, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Teresa&mdash;eh&mdash;what are you doing?&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s
  eyes half opened, and fixed on his daughter. &ldquo;Eh&mdash;what are you
  doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought you were asleep, father,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Asleep!
  Bah! I have been asleep for fifteen years&mdash;is that not long enough?
  Fifteen years! Ha, ha! But I am awake now! Yes, yes, old Nicolo has had enough
  of dreams! He is awake now! Come here, Teresa. Come here, and sit by the
  bed. Has our clever young friend gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; she told him, as she took the chair at the bedside.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano jerked his head around on his pillows, and studied her face
  for a moment, though his black eyes, with their smoldering, introspective
  expression, seemed not at all concerned with her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what do you think of him&mdash;eh&mdash;Teresa, my little one&mdash;what
  do you think of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew back in her chair with a little start.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what do you mean, father?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; There was a caustic chuckle in the old bomb king&rsquo;s
  voice. &ldquo;We do not speak of love&mdash;I suppose! I do not expect you
  to have fallen in love just because you have seen a man for a few minutes&mdash;eh?
  Bah! I mean just what I say. I called him clever. You are a Capriano, and
  you are clever; you are the cleverest woman in San Francisco, but you do
  not get it from your mother&mdash;you are a Capriano. Well, then, am I right?
  He is clever&mdash;a very clever fellow?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice was suddenly dull.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; ejaculated Nicolo Capriano. &ldquo;He was caught five
  years ago, but it was not his fault. He was double-crossed, or he would never
  have seen the inside of a penitentiary. So you agree, then, that he is clever?
  Well, then, he has courage, too&mdash;eh? He was modest about his fight at
  Vinetto&rsquo;s&mdash;eh? You heard it all from Vinetto himself when you
  went there this morning. Our young friend was modest&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa&rsquo;s eyes widened slightly in a puzzled way. She nodded her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Nicolo Capriano&mdash;and the long, slim fingers
  began to twine themselves together, and to untwine, and to twine together
  again. &ldquo;Well, then, my little one, with his cleverness and his courage,
  he should succeed&mdash;eh&mdash;in New York? Old Nicolo does not often make
  a mistake&mdash;eh? Our young friend will find his money again in New York&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She pushed back her chair impulsively, and stood up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; she answered in a low voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano jerked himself sharply up on his pillows,
  and his eyes narrowed. &ldquo;Eh&mdash;what is that you say? What do you
  mean&mdash;you hope not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is not his money now any more than it was before he stole it,&rdquo; she
  said in a dead tone. &ldquo;It is stolen money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and what of it?&rdquo; demanded Nicolo Capriano. &ldquo;Am
  I a fool that I do not know that?&rdquo; Sudden irascibility showed in the
  old Italian&rsquo;s face and manner; a flush swept his cheeks under the white
  beard, the black eyes grew lusterless and hard&mdash;and he coughed. &ldquo;Well,
  am I a fool?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
  <p>She looked at him in quick apprehension.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father, be careful!&rdquo; she admonished. &ldquo;You must not excite
  yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; He flung out his hand in a violent gesture. &ldquo;Excite
  myself! Bah! Always it is&mdash;&lsquo;do not excite yourself!&rsquo; Can
  you find nothing else to say? Now, you will explain&mdash;eh?&mdash;you will
  explain! What is it about this stolen money that Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s
  daughter does not like? You hear&mdash;I call you Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s
  daughter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a moment before she answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do not like it&mdash;because it has made my soul sick to-night.&rdquo; She
  turned her head away. &ldquo;I hid behind the old panel when he went out.
  I do not like it; I hate it. I hate it with all my soul! I did not understand
  at first, not until your talk with him to-night, that there was any money
  involved. I thought it was just to help him get away from the police who
  were hounding him even after his sentence had been served, and also to protect
  him from that gang who tried to get him in Vinetto&rsquo;s place&mdash;and
  that we were doing it for Tony&rsquo;s sake. And then it all seemed to come
  upon me in a flash, as I went toward the door to let him out to-night&mdash;that
  there was the stolen money, and that I was helping him, and had been helping
  him in everything that was done here, to steal it again. I know what I should
  have done. It would have done no good, it would have been utterly useless;
  I realized that&mdash;but I would have been honest with myself. I should
  have protested there and then. But I shrank from the position I was in. I
  shrank from having him ask me what I had to do with honesty, I, who&mdash;and
  you have said it yourself but a moment ago&mdash;I, who was Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s
  daughter; I, who, even if I protested on one score, had knowingly and voluntarily
  done my share in hoodwinking the police on another. He would have had the
  right to think me mad, to think me irresponsible&mdash;and worse. I shrank
  from having him laugh in my face. And so I let him go, because I must say
  that to him or nothing; for I could not be hypocrite enough to wish him a
  smiling good-by, to wish him good fortune and success&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;I
  tell you, I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;and so&mdash;and so I stepped behind the
  panel, and let him pass.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s two hands were outthrust and clenched, his lips
  had widened until the red gums showed above his teeth, and he glared at his
  daughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;it is well for you,
  you kept your mouth shut! Do you hear, you&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; A paroxysm
  of coughing seized him, and he fell back upon the pillows.</p>
  <p>In an instant, Teresa was bending over him anxiously.</p>
  <p>He pushed her away, and struggled upward again, and for a moment he shook
  his fists again at his daughter&mdash;and then his eyes were half veiled,
  and his hands opened, and he began to pat the girl&rsquo;s arm, and his voice
  held a soft, purring note.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen! You are not a fool, my little one. I have not brought you
  up to be a fool&mdash;eh? Well, then, listen! We have a little money, but
  it is not much. And he will get that hundred thousand dollars. Do you understand?
  He is clever, and he has the courage. Do you think that I would have tricked
  the police for him, otherwise? Eh&mdash;do you think old Nicolo Capriano
  does not know what he is about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stared at him, a sort of dawning dismay in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; she said, and the words seemed to come in a hard,
  forced way from her lips, &ldquo;you mean that if he gets that money again,
  you are to have a share?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A share! Ha, ha!&rdquo; The old Italian was rocking backward and
  forward in glee. &ldquo;No, my little one, not a share&mdash;Nicolo Capriano
  does not deal in shares any more. All&mdash;my little one&mdash;all! One
  hundred thousand dollars&mdash;all! And my little black-eyes will have such
  gowns as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; It came in a startled, broken cry of amazed and bitter
  expostulation.</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano stopped his rocking, and looked at her. A sudden glint of
  fury leaped from the smoldering eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he said angrily. &ldquo;Am I mistaken after all? Is it
  that you are your mother&mdash;and not a Capriano! Perhaps I should not have
  told you; but now you will make the best of it, and behave yourself, and
  not play the child&mdash;eh? Do you think I risked myself with the police
  for nothing! Yes&mdash;all! All&mdash;except that I must pay that leech Dago
  George something for looking after our young friend&mdash;<i>con amore&mdash;con
  amore</i>, Nicolo Capriano&mdash;eh?&mdash;since I signed the letter so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stood an instant, straight and tense, but a little backward on her heels,
  as though she had recoiled from a blow that had been struck her&mdash;and
  then she bent swiftly forward, and caught both her father&rsquo;s wrists
  in her strong young grasp, and looked into his eyes for a long minute, as
  though to read deep into his soul.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You signed that letter <i>con amore!</i>&rdquo; Her voice was colorless. &ldquo;You
  signed it&mdash;<i>con amore</i>&mdash;the code word of the old, horrible,
  miserable days when this house was a den of outlaws, the code word that marked
  out the victim who was to be watched and hounded down!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old bomb king wrenched himself still further up in bed. He shook his
  wrists free.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it to you!&rdquo; he screamed in a blaze of fury&mdash;and
  fell into a second, and more violent paroxysm of coughing&mdash;and now caught
  at his breast with his thin, blue-tipped fingers, and now in unbridled passion
  waved his arms about like disjointed flails. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I signed it
  that&mdash;<i>con amore</i>. And it is the old signal! Yes, yes! And Dago
  George will obey. And he will watch our young friend&mdash; watch&mdash; watch&mdash; watch!
  And in the end&mdash;bah!&mdash;in the end our young friend will supply Nicolo
  Capriano with that hundred thousand dollars. Ha! And in the end we will see
  that our young friend does not become troublesome. He is a pawn&mdash;a pawn!&rdquo; Old
  Nicolo&rsquo;s face, between rage and coughing, had grown a mottled purple. &ldquo;A
  pawn! And when a pawn has lost its usefulness&mdash;eh?&mdash;it is swept
  from the board&mdash;eh? <i>Con amore!</i> The old days again! The finger
  of Nicolo Capriano lifted&mdash;and the puppets jump! <i>Con amore!</i> I
  will see that Dago George knows what to do with a young man who brings him
  Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s letter! Ha, ha! Yes, yes; I will take care of that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had not moved, except to grow a little straighter in her poise, and
  except that her hands now were clenched at her sides.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I cannot believe it!&rdquo; Her voice was scarcely above a whisper. &ldquo;I
  cannot believe it! I cannot believe that you would do this! It is monstrous,
  horrible!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It seemed as though Nicolo Capriano could not get his breath, or at least
  one adequate enough to vent the access of fury that swept upon him. He choked,
  caught again at his breast, and hooked fingers ripped the nightdress loose
  from his throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Out of the room!&rdquo; he screamed at last. &ldquo;Out of it! I
  will teach you a chit of a girl&rsquo;s place! Out of it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I will not go out&mdash;not yet,&rdquo; she said, and steadied
  her voice with an effort. &ldquo;I will not go until you tell me that you
  will not do this thing. You can&rsquo;t do it, father&mdash;you can&rsquo;t&mdash;you
  can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Even the semblance of calmness was gone from her now,
  and, instead, there was a frantic, almost incoherent pleading in her tones. &ldquo;He
  came&mdash;he came from Tony Lomazzi. Father, are you mad? Do you not understand?
  He came from Tony Lomazzi, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I tell you to get out of this room, and hold your tongue, you
  meddling little fool!&rdquo; screamed Nicolo Capriano again. &ldquo;Tony
  Lomazzi! He came from Tony Lomazzi, did he? Damn Tony Lomazzi&mdash;damn
  him&mdash;damn him! What do I owe Tony Lomazzi but the hell of hate in a
  man&rsquo;s soul that comes only in one way! You hear! It was the prison
  walls only that saved Lomazzi from my reach&mdash;from these fingers of mine
  that are strong, strong at the throat, and never let go! Do you think I was
  blind that I could not see, that I did not know&mdash;eh?&mdash;that I did
  not know what was between your mother and that accursed Lomazzi! But he died&mdash;eh?&mdash;he
  died like a rat gnawing, gnawing at walls that he could not bite through!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa&rsquo;s face had gone suddenly a deathly white, and the color seemed
  to have fled her lips and left them gray.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a lie&mdash;a hideous lie!&rdquo; she cried&mdash;and all the
  passion of her father&rsquo;s race was on the surface now. &ldquo;It is a
  lie! And you know it is&mdash;you know it is! My mother loved you, always
  loved you, and only you&mdash;and you broke her heart&mdash;and killed her
  with the foul, horrible life of crime that seethed in this house! Oh, my
  God! Are you trying to make me hate you, hate <i>you</i>, my father! I have
  tried to be a good daughter to you since she died. She made me promise that
  I would, on that last night. I have tried to love you, and I have tried to
  understand why she should have loved you&mdash;but&mdash;but I do not know.
  It is true that Tony Lomazzi loved her, but, though he was one of you in
  your criminal work, his love was the love of a brave, honest man. It is true,
  perhaps, that it was for her, rather than for you, that it was because of
  his love, a great, strong, wonderful love, and to save her from horror and
  despair because she loved <i>you</i>, that he gave his life for you, that
  he went to prison in your stead, voluntarily, on his own confession, when
  he was less guilty than you, and when the police offered him his freedom
  if he would only turn evidence against you, the man they really wanted. But
  that is what he did, nevertheless. He kept you together.&rdquo; She was leaning
  forward now, her eyes ablaze, burning. &ldquo;That was his love! His love
  for my mother, and for me&mdash;yes, for me&mdash;for he loved me too, and
  I, though I, was only a little girl, I loved Tony Lomazzi. And he gave his
  life&mdash;and he died there in prison. And now&mdash;now&mdash;you mean
  to betray his trust&mdash;to betray his friend who believed in you because
  he believed in Tony, who trusted you and sent him here. And you tricked him,
  and tricked the police for your own ends! Well, you shall not do it! You
  shall not! Do you hear? You shall not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s face was livid. A fury, greater than before, a fury
  that was unbalanced, like the fury of a maniac, seized upon him. He twisted
  his hands one around the other with swift insistence, his lips moved to form
  words&mdash;and he coughed instead, and a fleck of blood tinged the white
  beard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You dare!&rdquo; he shrieked, catching for his breath. &ldquo;You,
  a girl, dare talk to me like that, to me&mdash;Nicolo Capriano! I shall not&mdash;eh?
  You say that to me! I shall not! And who will stop me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; she said, through tight lips. &ldquo;If you will not
  stop it yourself&mdash;then I will. No matter what it costs, no matter what
  it means&mdash;to you, or to me&mdash;I will!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nicolo Capriano laughed&mdash;and the room rang with the pealing laughter
  that was full of unhinged, crazy, shuddering mirth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You will stop it&mdash;eh? And how
  will you stop it? Will you tell the police? Ha, ha! Then you, too, would
  betray dear Tony&rsquo;s friend! You would tell the police what they want
  to know&mdash;that Dave Henderson can be found in New York, and that he has
  gone there to get the money back. Or perhaps you will write another letter&mdash;and
  tell Dago George to pay no attention to my orders? Ha, ha! And it is too
  bad that our young friend himself has gone, and left you no address so that
  you could intercept him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa drew back a little, and into her eyes came trouble and dismay. And
  Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s laugh rang out again&mdash;and was checked by a spasm
  of coughing&mdash;and rang out once more, ending in a sort of triumphant
  scream.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and what do you think now about stopping it&mdash;eh? Do you
  imagine that Nicolo Capriano sees no farther than his nose? Stop it! Bah!
  No one will stop it&mdash;and, least of all, you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She seemed to have overcome the dismay that had seized upon her, though
  her face had grown even whiter than before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is true, what you say,&rdquo; she said, in a low, strained voice. &ldquo;But
  there is one way left, one way to find him, and warn him, and I will take
  that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; Nicolo Capriano glared at her. His voice dropped. &ldquo;And
  what is that way, my little one?&rdquo; he purred, through a fit of coughing. &ldquo;Old
  Nicolo would like to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To go where Dave Henderson is going,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;To
  go where he can be found, to go to New York, to keep him from going to Dago
  George&rsquo;s, or, if I am too late for that, to warn him there before Dago
  George has had time to do him any harm, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her words ended in a startled cry. Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s long, slim fingers,
  from the bed, had shot out, locked about her waist, and were wrenching at
  her in a mad-man&rsquo;s fury.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you would do that!&rdquo; the old Italian screamed. &ldquo;By
  God! No! No! <i>No!</i> Do you hear? No!&rdquo; His hands had crept upward,
  and, with all his weight upon her, he was literally pulling himself out of
  the bed. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he screamed again. &ldquo;No! Do you hear? No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; she cried out frantically. &ldquo;Father, what are
  you doing? You will kill yourself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The black eyes of the old man were gleaming with an insane light, his face
  was working in horrible contortions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; He was out of the bed now, struggling wildly with her. &ldquo;Hah!
  Kill myself, will I? I would kill you&mdash;<i>you</i>&mdash;before I would
  let you meddle with my plans! It is the old Nicolo again&mdash;Nicolo Capriano
  of the years when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The room seemed to swirl around her. The clutching fingers had relaxed.
  It was she now who struggled and grasped at the man&rsquo;s body and shoulders&mdash;to
  hold him up. He was very heavy, too heavy for her. He seemed to be carrying
  her downward with him&mdash;until he fell back half across the bed. And she
  leaned over him then, and stared at him for a long time through her hands
  that were tightly held to her face&mdash;and horror, a great, blinding horror
  came, and fear, a fear that robbed her of her senses came, and she staggered
  backward, and stumbled over the chair at the bedside, and clutched at it
  for support.</p>
  <p>She did not speak. Nicolo Capriano had left his bed for the first time in
  three years&mdash;to die.</p>
  <p>Her father was dead. That was the theme of the overwhelming horror, and
  the paralyzing fear that obsessed her brain. It beat upon her in remorseless
  waves&mdash;horror&mdash;fear. Time did not exist; reality had passed away.
  She was in some great, soundless void&mdash;soundless, except for that strange
  ringing in her ears. And she put her hands up to her ears to shut out the
  sound. But it persisted. It became clearer. It became a tangible thing. It
  was the doorbell.</p>
  <p>Habit seemed to impel her. She went automatically to the hall, and, in a
  numbed sort of consciousness, went along the hall, and opened the door, and
  stared at a short, fat man, who stood there and chewed on the butt of a cigar
  that dangled from one corner of his mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s MacBain,&rdquo; said Bookie Skarvan glibly. &ldquo;And
  I want to see Nicolo Capriano. Very important. You&rsquo;re his daughter,
  aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She did not answer him. Her brain floundered in that pit of blackness into
  which it had been plunged. She was scarcely aware of the man&rsquo;s presence,
  scarcely aware that she was standing here in the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, you look scared, you do; but there&rsquo;s nothing to be scared
  about,&rdquo; said Bookie Skarvan ingratiatingly. &ldquo;I just want to
  see Nicolo Capriano for a few minutes. You go and tell him a reporter wants
  to see him about that bomb explosion, and &rsquo;ll give him a write-up that&rsquo;ll
  be worth while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew back a little, forcing herself to shake her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, say, go on now, there&rsquo;s a good girl!&rdquo; wheedled Bookie
  Skarvan. &ldquo;The paper sent me here, and I&rsquo;ve got to see him. There&rsquo;s
  nothing for you to look so white about. I&rsquo;m only a reporter. I ain&rsquo;t
  going to hurt him&mdash;see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa shivered. How cold the night was! This man here&mdash;what was it
  he had said? That he wanted to see Nicolo Capriano? Strange that words came
  with such curious difficulty to her tongue&mdash;as though, somehow, she
  had been dumb all her life, and was speaking now for the first time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolo Capriano is dead,&rdquo; she said&mdash;and closed the door
  in Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s face.</p>

  The Rendezvous</b></h2>
  <p>THE metamorphosis in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s appearance since the night,
  nine days ago, when he had left San Francisco and Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s
  house, had been, by necessity, gradual; it had attained its finished state
  now, as he stepped from a train to one of the sub-level station platforms
  in the City of New York. Then, he had been attired in one of the old Italian&rsquo;s
  cast-off and ill-fitting suits, an object neither too respectable nor presentable;
  now, the wide-brimmed soft hat was new and good, and the dark tweed suit,
  of expensive material, was that of a well-groomed man.</p>
  <p>It had taken time&mdash;all this. Nor had it been entirely simple of accomplishment,
  in spite of the ample funds received from Square John Kelly, funds that now,
  wary of unsavory corners into which a certain business that he had on hand
  might lead him here in New York, he had taken the precaution to secrete about
  his person in a money belt beneath his underclothing.</p>
  <p>He had scarcely needed old Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s warning to be careful.
  Dave Henderson had not changed so much in five years in prison that he could
  take liberties with the risk of recognition in that section of the country
  where, in the days before, he had been so familiar a figure on the local
  race-tracks. He had made his way out of California, and considerably beyond
  California, in the same way that, once before, he had attempted to elude
  the police&mdash;and on which former occasion would have succeeded, he was
  quite satisfied, had it not been for the wound that had finally robbed him
  of consciousness and placed him at their mercy.</p>
  <p>He had traveled during three nights, and only at night, in boxcars, and
  on freight trains, stealing his way. But there had been no hurry. The night
  of the twenty-fourth of June, the date of the rendezvous that Millman had
  given him, had not been very far off, and though it had always obtruded itself
  upon him and never allowed itself to be forgotten from the moment he had
  heard it from Millman&rsquo;s lips, he had consistently told himself that
  the twenty-fourth of June was a consideration to be entirely disregarded.
  Since Millman was a thief and had double-crossed him, the rendezvous was
  blatantly a fake. It existed only as a sort of jeering, ironical barb with
  which Millman at times, out of the nowhere, like a specter, grinning maliciously,
  prodded and made devil&rsquo;s sport of him. He had no concern with Millman&rsquo;s
  twenty-fourth of June! He would meet Millman in due time&mdash;two hemispheres
  were not big enough, or wide enough apart, to prevent that&mdash;but the
  meeting would be by his, not Millman&rsquo;s, appointment.</p>
  <p>And then he had passed out of the more critical danger zone, and got further
  east. But, even then, he had taken no chances. Dave Henderson was dead&mdash;the
  creation of one Barty Lynch was not a matter to be trifled with. He had taken
  no chances; if anything, he had erred on the side of extreme caution. The
  abrupt transition into respectability by one in misfitting, threadbare garments,
  and who looked, moreover, a disreputable tramp from his nights in the boxcars,
  was only to invite suspicion at any ordinary store where he might attempt
  to buy clothes. A second-hand suit, therefore, of fairly creditable appearance,
  first replaced Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s discarded garments; later, at a more
  exclusive establishment still further east, in Chicago, to be exact, this
  was exchanged for the attire he now wore&mdash;while, here and there, he
  had stocked a dress-suit case with needed requirements. He had been deliberately
  leisurely in his progress east once he had felt it safe to dispense with
  his boxcar mode of travel&mdash;and this, actually, as a sort of defiance
  and challenge flung down by his common sense to that jeering prod with which
  Millman, and Millman&rsquo;s cynical rendezvous, plagued him in spite of
  himself. The evening of June twenty-fourth at the St. Lucian Hotel in New
  York was of no particular interest to him! It had taken him a week to reach
  Chicago. It was nine days now since he had left Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s house.
  Nine days! He was now in New York, standing here on one of the station platforms&mdash;and
  it was the evening of the twenty-fourth of June!</p>
  <p>He looked at his watch, as he made his way to the main section of the station.
  It was seven-thirty. He deposited his dress-suit case in the parcel-room,
  and went out to the street. Here, he asked a policeman to direct him to the
  St. Lucian Hotel.</p>
  <p>He smiled a little grimly as he walked along. The much vaunted challenge
  of his common sense had gone down to rout and defeat, it seemed! He was on
  his way now to the St. Lucian Hotel&mdash;and he would be there at eight
  o&rsquo;clock on the evening of June twenty-fourth. He laughed outright at
  himself, suddenly, mirthlessly.</p>
  <p>Well, why not! And why not be entirely honest with himself? Despite self-argument
  to the contrary, he knew all along that he would be at the rendezvous at
  the appointed time. He was a fool&mdash;undoubtedly a fool. Nothing could
  come of it except, possibly, to afford Millman, if Millman had elected to
  watch from some safe vantage point in hiding, an amusing spectacle.</p>
  <p>He was a fool&mdash;he offered nothing in defense of himself on that score.
  But, too, as far as any results had been obtained, he had been a fool to
  go searching the old pigeon-cote for the money, when he had beforehand already
  persuaded himself in his own mind that the money was gone! It was the same
  thing over again now&mdash;the elimination of doubt, that would always have
  crept insidiously into his mind; the substitution of doubt, however ill-founded,
  for an established certainty. He had felt better for that visit to the old
  pigeon-cote; he would feel better, even at the expense of pampering again
  to fantastic doubts, for his visit to the St. Lucian Hotel to-night. Millman
  would not be there, any more than the money had been in the pigeon-cote;
  but, equally, he, Dave Henderson, would have established that fact beyond
  the reach of any brain quibbling which, of late, had been, it seemed, so
  prone to affect him.</p>
  <p>He stopped again to ask directions from an officer, and to ask this time
  another question as well&mdash;a question prompted by a somewhat unpleasant
  possibility which, having once decided to keep the rendezvous, he could not
  now ignore. What kind of a place <i>was</i> this St. Lucian Hotel?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of the best,&rdquo; the officer answered. &ldquo;There you are&mdash;two
  blocks ahead, and one to the left.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson smiled with a sort of patient tolerance at himself. The locality
  alone should have been sufficient answer to his question. It was not the
  setting, very far from it, for a trap! His hand, that had unconsciously
  closed around the stock of his revolver in the side pocket of his coat, was
  withdrawn and swung now at his side, as he walked along again.</p>
  <p>He looked at his watch once more, as he turned the corner indicated. It
  was five minutes to eight. A half block ahead of him he saw the hotel. He
  walked slowly now, the short distance remaining. &ldquo;The St. Lucian Hotel.
  Eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening. June twenty-fourth.&rdquo; The words
  seemed to mock at him now, and the gibe to sting. He had fallen for it, after
  all! He could call himself a fool again if he wished, but what was the use
  of that? It was obvious that he was a fool! He <i>felt</i> like one, as he
  passed a much bedecked functionary at the doorway, and found himself standing
  a moment later in the huge, luxuriously appointed rotunda of the hotel. He
  was not even recompensed by novelty, as he stared aimlessly about him. It
  was just the usual thing&mdash;the rug-strewn, tiled floor; the blaze of
  lights; the hum of talk; the hurry of movement; the wide, palm-dotted corridors,
  whose tables were crowded with men and women in evening dress at after-dinner
  coffee; the deep lounging chairs in his more immediate vicinity; the strains
  of an orchestra trying to make itself heard above the general hubbub.</p>
  <p>A clock from the hotel desk behind him began to chime the hour. He turned
  mechanically in that direction, his eyes seeking the timepiece&mdash;and
  whirled suddenly around again, as a hand fell upon his shoulder. The police!
  The thought flashed swift as a lightning stroke through his mind. Somewhere,
  somehow he had failed, and they had found him out, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>The rotunda, the lights, seemed to swirl before him, and then to vanish
  utterly, and leave only a single figure to fill all the space, a figure in
  immaculate evening clothes, a figure whose hand tightened its shoulder-grip
  upon him, a figure whose clear, gray eyes stared into his and smiled.</p>
  <p>He touched his lips with the tip of his tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Millman!&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Millman easily, &ldquo;this is the St. Lucian Hotel;
  it&rsquo;s eight o&rsquo;clock, and June twenty-fourth&mdash;who did you
  expect to meet here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson&mdash;and laughed unnaturally.</p>
  <p>Millman&rsquo;s gray eyes narrowed, and his face clouded suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, Dave?&rdquo; he demanded sharply.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s hands, at his sides, were clenched. Millman&mdash;this
  was Millman! Millman, whom he hadn&rsquo;t expected to meet here! Millman,
  whom he had promised himself he would track down if it took a lifetime, and,
  once found, would settle with as he would settle with a mad dog! And Millman
  was here, smiling into his face! His mind groped out through a haze of bewilderment
  that robbed him of the power to reason; his tongue groped for words. It was
  as though he were dazed and groggy from a blow that had sent him mentally
  to his knees. He did not understand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with me,&rdquo; he said mechanically.</p>
  <p>He felt Millman&rsquo;s hand close on his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on up to my rooms,&rdquo; said Millman quietly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  a little public here, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson did not disengage his arm from the other&rsquo;s hold, but
  his hand slipped unostentatiously into his coat pocket. A rift seemed to
  come breaking through that brain fog, as he silently accompanied Millman
  to the elevator. He had dismissed the probability of such a thing but a few
  minutes before, had even jeered at himself for considering it, but, in spite
  of the eminent respectability of the St. Lucian Hotel, in spite of its fashion-crowded
  corridors and lobby, the thought was back now with redoubled force&mdash;and
  it came through the process of elimination. If Millman was a crook, as he
  undoubtedly was, and had secured the money, as he undoubtedly had, why else
  should Millman be here? There seemed to be no other way to account for Millman
  having kept the rendezvous. Strange things, queer things, had happened in
  hotels that were quite as enviable of reputation as the St. Lucian&mdash;perhaps
  it was even the <i>safest</i> place for such things to happen, from the perpetrator&rsquo;s
  standpoint! His lips were tight now. Well, at least, he was not walking blindfold
  into&mdash;a trap!</p>
  <p>They had ascended in silence. He eyed Millman now in cool appraisal, as
  the elevator stopped, and the other led the way and threw open the door to
  a suite of rooms. There was quite a difference between the prison stripes
  of a bare few months ago and the expensive and fashionably tailored evening
  clothes of to-night! Well, Millman had always claimed he was a gentleman,
  hadn&rsquo;t he? And he, Dave Henderson, had believed him&mdash;once! But
  that did not change anything. Millman was no less a crook for that! From
  the moment Millman had gone to that pigeon-cote and had taken that money,
  he stood out foursquare as a crook, and&mdash; Dave Henderson felt his muscles
  tauten, and a chill sense of dismay seize suddenly upon him. There was still
  another supposition&mdash;one that swept upon him now in a disconcerting
  flash. Suppose Millman had <i>not</i> gone to that pigeon-cote, suppose it
  was <i>not</i> Millman who had taken the money, suppose that, after all,
  it had been found by some one else, that Tooler, for instance, had stumbled
  upon it by chance! And, instead of Millman having it, suppose that it was
  gone forever, without clue to its whereabouts, beyond his, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s,
  reach! It was not impossible&mdash;it was not even improbable. His brain
  was suddenly in turmoil&mdash;he scarcely heard Millman&rsquo;s words, as
  the other closed the door of the suite behind them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The family is in the country for the summer months,&rdquo; said Millman
  with a smile, as he waved his hand around the apartment; &ldquo;and I have
  gone back to my old habit&mdash;since I have been free to indulge my habits&mdash;of
  living here during that time, instead of keeping a town house open, too.
  Sit down there, Dave, by the table, and make yourself comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It sounded plausible&mdash;most plausible! Dave Henderson scowled. Across
  his mind flashed that scene in the prison library when Millman had been plausible
  before&mdash;damnably plausible! His mind was in a sort of riot now; but,
  through the maze of doubt and chaos, there stood out clearly enough the memory
  of the hours, and days, and weeks of bitter resolve to &ldquo;get&rdquo; this
  man who now, offensively at his ease, and smiling, was standing here before
  him.</p>
  <p>And then Dave Henderson laughed a little&mdash;not pleasantly.</p>
  <p>Well, he was face to face with Millman now. It would be a showdown anyhow.
  Trap, or no trap, Millman would show his hand. He would know whether Millman
  had got that money, or whether somebody else had! He would know whether Millman
  was straight&mdash;or whether Millman was a crook!</p>
  <p>He jerked his shoulders back sharply; his fingers closed a little more ominously
  on the revolver in his coat pocket. Was he quite crazy? Had he lost all sense
  of proportion? The chances were a thousand to one that it <i>was</i> Millman
  who had looted the pigeon-cote; the chances were one in a thousand that it
  could have been any one else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;Nice rooms you&rsquo;ve got here,
  and a bit of a change from&mdash;out West!&rdquo; He jerked his head abruptly
  toward a door across the room. &ldquo;I notice you&rsquo;ve got a closed
  door there. I hope I&rsquo;m not butting in, if you&rsquo;re entertaining
  friends, or anything like that!&rdquo; He laughed again&mdash;raucously now.
  His nerves seemed suddenly to be raw and on edge. Millman was favoring him
  with what, whether it was genuine or not, was meant for a blank stare.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friends?&rdquo; said Millman questioningly. And then his gray eyes
  softened. &ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard
  to get over the habit, isn&rsquo;t it? No; there&rsquo;s no one there. But
  perhaps you&rsquo;d feel better satisfied to look for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go ahead, then!&rdquo; invited Millman readily, and waved his hand
  toward the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson curtly.</p>
  <p>Millman turned toward the door, hesitated, and stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; he demanded for the
  second time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing much!&rdquo; replied Dave Henderson. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll
  get this over first, eh? Go on, let&rsquo;s see the rest of this suite
  of yours. It&rsquo;s good to know that an old pal is enjoying such pleasant
  surroundings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without a word, Millman stepped across the room, and opened the door in
  question. It led into a bedroom, and from there to a bathroom; there was
  nothing else. Dave Henderson inspected these in silence. He eyed Millman,
  frowning in a renewed perplexity, as they returned to the outer room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he said gruffly. &ldquo;You win the first trick.
  But how about a certain little package now? I&rsquo;ll trouble you to hand
  that over, Millman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman shook his head in a sort of tolerant expostulation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As we used to say &lsquo;out there,&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t get you,
  Dave!&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;You are acting very strangely. I&rsquo;ve
  been looking forward to this meeting&mdash;and you haven&rsquo;t even a handshake
  for an old friend. I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t myself!&rdquo; returned Dave Henderson evenly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
  a whole lot of things that don&rsquo;t fit. But it&rsquo;s five years since
  I&rsquo;ve seen that package, and maybe I&rsquo;m a trifle over-anxious about
  it. Suppose you come across with it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman shrugged his shoulders a little helplessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a queer card, Dave,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course,
  I&rsquo;ll come across with it! What else in the world are we here for to-night?&rdquo; He
  stepped to the table, pulled a drawer open, and produced a neatly tied parcel,
  which he laid on the table. &ldquo;I took it out of the vault to-day, so
  as to have it ready for you to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From the package, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s eyes lifted, and held Millman&rsquo;s
  in a long stare. It was as though, somehow, the ground had been swept from
  under his feet. He had expected anything but the package. Logically, from
  every conclusion based on logic, Millman should not be handing over that
  package now. And this act now was so illogical that he could account for
  it on no other basis than one of trickery of some sort. He tried to read
  the riddle in the other&rsquo;s eyes; he read only a cool, imperturbable
  composure. His hand still toyed with the revolver in his pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an outside wrapper on it, I see,&rdquo; he said in
  a low voice. &ldquo;Take it off, Millman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman&rsquo;s brows knitted in a sort of amused perplexity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re beyond me to-night, Dave,&rdquo; he said, as he stripped
  off the outer covering. &ldquo;Utterly beyond me! Well, there you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The package lay there now on the table, intact, as it had been on the night
  it had found a hiding-place in the old pigeon-cote. The original brown-paper
  wrapper was still tied and sealed with its several bank seals in red wax;
  the corner, torn open in that quick, hasty examination in Martin K. Tydeman&rsquo;s
  library, still gaped apart, disclosing the edges of the banknotes within.
  It was the package containing one hundred thousand dollars, intact, untouched,
  undisturbed.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson sat down mechanically in the chair behind him that was drawn
  up close to the table. His hand came from his pocket, and, joined by the
  other, cupped his chin, his elbows resting on the table&rsquo;s edge, as
  he stared at the package.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson heavily.</p>
  <p>His mind refused to point the way. It left him hung up in midair. It still
  persisted in picturing the vengeance he had sworn against this man here,
  in picturing every stake he owned flung into the ring to square accounts
  with this man here&mdash;and the picture took on the guise now of grotesque
  and gigantic irony. But still he did not understand. That picture had had
  its inception in a logical, incontrovertible and true perspective. It was
  strange! He looked up now from the package to Millman, as he felt Millman&rsquo;s
  hand fall and press gently upon his shoulder. Millman was leaning toward
  him over the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Dave,&rdquo; said Millman, and his smile disarmed his words, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
  treated me as though I were a thug up to the moment I opened that package,
  and now you act as though the sight of it had floored you. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll
  tell me now, if I ask you again, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson did not answer for a moment. His hand went into his pocket
  and came out again&mdash;with his revolver balanced in its palm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess I made a mistake,&rdquo; he said at last, with a queer smile. &ldquo;Thug
  is right! I was figuring on pulling this on you&mdash;in another way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman drew a chair deliberately up to the opposite side of the table,
  and sat down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Dave,&rdquo; he prompted quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson restored the weapon to his pocket, and shrugged his shoulders
  in a way that was eloquent of his own perturbed state of mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll get the point in a word or two,&rdquo; he said
  slowly. &ldquo;The story you told me in the pen, and the way you acted for
  two years made me believe you, and made me think you were straight. Understand?
  And then that afternoon before you were going out, and I was up against it
  hard&mdash;you know&mdash;I told you where this money was. Understand? Well,
  I had hardly got back to my cell when I figured you had trapped me. If you
  were straight you wouldn&rsquo;t touch that money, unless to do me in by
  handing it back to the police, for it would be the same thing as stealing
  it again, and that would make a crook of you; if you were a crook then you
  weren&rsquo;t playing straight with me to begin with, since the story you
  told me was a lie, and the only reason I could see for that lie was to work
  me up to spilling the beans so that you could cop the loot and give me the
  slip. Either way, it looked raw for me, didn&rsquo;t it? Well, when I got
  out, the money <i>hadn&rsquo;t</i> gone back to the police, but it <i>had</i> gone!
  I swore I&rsquo;d get you. Don&rsquo;t make any mistake about that, Millman&mdash;I
  swore I&rsquo;d get you. I didn&rsquo;t expect to meet you here to-night.
  I called myself a fool even for coming. You were either straight or a crook,
  and there wasn&rsquo;t much room left for doubt as to which it was. See,
  Millman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman nodded his head gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, in the same quiet tones. &ldquo;And now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson jerked his hand toward the package of banknotes that lay
  on the table before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the answer, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said,
  with a twisted smile. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the hundred thousand dollars
  there that you pinched from the old pigeon-cote.&rdquo; He shoved out his
  hand impulsively to Millman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Millman. Shake! I&rsquo;ve
  been in wrong all the time. But I never seemed to get that slant on it before;
  that you were&mdash;a straight crook.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman&rsquo;s gray eyes, half amused, half serious, studied Dave Henderson
  for a long minute, as their hands clasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A straight crook, eh?&rdquo; he said finally, leaning back again
  in his chair. &ldquo;Well, the deduction is fairly logical, Dave, I&rsquo;ll
  have to admit. And what&rsquo;s the answer to that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson jerked his hand toward the package of banknotes again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
  got a stake in that coin now. A fair share of it is yours, and I&rsquo;ll
  leave it to you to say what you want.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman lighted a cigarette before he answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he said, with a curious smile, as his eyes through
  the spiral of blue smoke from the tip of his cigarette fixed on Dave Henderson
  again. &ldquo;All right! I&rsquo;ll accept that offer, Dave. And I&rsquo;ll
  take&mdash;all, or none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson drew sharply back in his chair. There was something in Millman&rsquo;s
  voice, a significance that he did not like, or quite understand, save that
  it denied any jocularity on Millman&rsquo;s part, or that the other was making
  a renunciation of his claim through pure generosity. His eyes narrowed. The
  money was here. Millman had come across with it. Those facts were not to
  be gainsaid; but they were facts so utterly at variance with what months
  of brooding over the matter had led him to expect they should be, that he
  had accepted them in a sort of stunned surprise. And now this! Was he right,
  after all&mdash;that there was some trickery here?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;all, or none?&rdquo; he said, a hint of menace
  creeping into his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; said Millman, and his tones were low and serious
  now. &ldquo;Just what I said&mdash;all, or none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson laughed shortly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I guess it&rsquo;ll be&mdash;none!&rdquo; he said coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; admitted Millman slowly. &ldquo;But I hope not.&rdquo; He
  leaned forward now, earnestly, over the table. &ldquo;Dave,&rdquo; he said
  steadily, &ldquo;let us get back to the old pal days again when we believed
  in each other, just man to man, Dave; because now you&rsquo;ve got a chip
  on your shoulder. I don&rsquo;t want to knock that chip off; I want to talk
  to you. I want to tell you why I committed what you have rightly called theft
  in going to that pigeon-cote and taking that money. And I want to try and
  make you understand that my life in prison and the story that I told you
  there, in spite of the fact that I have &lsquo;stolen&rsquo; the money now,
  was not a lie. There is not a soul on this wide earth, Dave, except yourself,
  who knows that Charles Millman served two years in the penitentiary with
  prison stripes on his back. If it were known I think it would mean ruin to
  me, certainly in a social sense, very probably in a commercial sense as well.
  And yet, Dave, I would rather you knew it than that you didn&rsquo;t. Does
  that sound strange? Well, somehow, I&rsquo;ve never pictured the flaring
  headlines that would be in every paper in this city if I were exposed&mdash;because,
  well, because I couldn&rsquo;t picture it&mdash;not through you, Dave&mdash;and
  that&rsquo;s the only way it could come about. And so you see, Dave, I did
  not ask you for faith in me without reposing my own faith in you in the same
  full measure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s brows gathered. He stared at the other. It was like
  the Charlie Millman of old talking now. But the whole business was queer&mdash;except
  that the money lay here now within reach of his hand after five years of
  hell and torture. He made no comment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so, Dave, what could I do?&rdquo; Millman went on. &ldquo;As
  far as I could see then, and as far as I can see now, I had no choice but
  to offer to get that money from its hiding-place. I knew you meant literally
  what you said when you swore you&rsquo;d fight for it if all the police in
  America were blocking your way, and that you&rsquo;d either get it or go
  down and out. I knew you&rsquo;d do that; I knew the police <i>would</i> watch
  you, and I feared for you either physical harm or another long prison sentence.
  And so I took the money and shared your guilt. But, Dave, once I was committed
  to that act, I was committed to another as well&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t any
  choice there, either&mdash;I mean, Dave, the return of the money to the estate
  where it belongs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson was on his feet. His face, that had softened and relaxed
  as Millman was speaking, was suddenly hard and set again, and now a red,
  angry flush was dyeing his cheeks. He choked for his words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say!&rdquo; he rasped out. &ldquo;Return it!&rdquo; He
  laughed raucously. &ldquo;Have you been drinking, Millman&mdash;or are you
  just crazy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A strange, whimsical smile crept to Millman&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m what you called me&mdash;just a straight
  crook. I can&rsquo;t see any other way out, Dave. I&rsquo;ve stolen the money
  too, and it&rsquo;s up to me as well as you. It&rsquo;s got to go back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God&mdash;no!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson through his teeth. &ldquo;No!
  You understand&mdash;no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman shook his head slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave, it&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Apart from
  every other consideration, it won&rsquo;t get you anywhere. Listen, Dave,
  I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Dave Henderson interrupted savagely. &ldquo;You can cut
  that out! You&rsquo;re going to preach; but that&rsquo;s no good, either!
  You&rsquo;re going to pull the goody-goody stuff, and then you&rsquo;re going
  to tell me that sooner or later I&rsquo;ll be caught, anyhow. Well, you can
  forget it&mdash;the preaching, because I don&rsquo;t want to listen to you;
  and the other, because there&rsquo;s nothing to it now.&rdquo; He leaned
  across the table, and laughed raucously again, and stared with cynical humor
  at the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dead&mdash;see? Dave Henderson is dead. A
  friend of mine pulled the trick on them in &rsquo;Frisco. They think Dave
  Henderson is dead. The book is closed, slammed shut forever&mdash;understand?
  I&rsquo;m dead&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve got this money now that I&rsquo;ve fought
  for, and paid for with the sweat of hell, and it&rsquo;s going to pay me
  back now, Millman! Understand? It&rsquo;s going to pay the dividends now
  that I&rsquo;ve earned&mdash;and that, by God, no man is going to take away
  from me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good old Dave!&rdquo; said Millman softly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
  the matter with you&mdash;you&rsquo;d drop in your tracks before you&rsquo;d
  let go. If only you weren&rsquo;t looking through the wrong glasses, Dave,
  you&rsquo;d fight just as hard the other way. No, I don&rsquo;t want to preach
  to you, and I&rsquo;m not going to preach; but there&rsquo;s a great big
  bond, two years of prison together, between you and me, and I want you to
  listen to me. You were never meant for a crook, Dave. There&rsquo;s not a
  crooked thing in the world about you, except this one distorted brain kink
  that&rsquo;s got hold of you. And now you&rsquo;re in wrong. Look at it from
  any angle that you like, and it doesn&rsquo;t pay. It hasn&rsquo;t paid you
  so far&mdash;and it never will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; snapped Dave Henderson. &ldquo;Well, maybe
  not! But that&rsquo;s because it hasn&rsquo;t had the chance. But the chance
  is here now, and it&rsquo;s all bust wide open. You can forget everything
  else, Millman, except just this, and then you&rsquo;ll understand once for
  all where I stand: Here&rsquo;s the money&mdash;and I&rsquo;m dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your soul isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Millman bluntly.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s jaws set.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; he flung out curtly. &ldquo;Once for
  all&mdash;no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman did not answer for a moment, nor did he look at Dave Henderson&mdash;his
  eyes, through the curling cigarette smoke, were fixed on the package of banknotes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Dave,&rdquo; he said at last, in a low, strained
  way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you won&rsquo;t take the biggest chance you&rsquo;ll
  ever have in your life, the chance you&rsquo;ve got right now, of coming
  across a white man clean through. I thought perhaps you would. I hoped you
  would, Dave&mdash;and so I&rsquo;m sorry. But that doesn&rsquo;t alter my
  position any. The money has got to go back to the estate, and it is going
  back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For an instant Dave Henderson did not move, then he thrust his head sharply
  forward over the table. The red had flooded into his face again, and his
  eyes were hard and full of menace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better!&rdquo; he said through tight lips. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  talking a language now that I understand! So that money is going back, is
  it? Well, you&rsquo;ve talked a lot, and I&rsquo;ve listened. Now you listen
  to me, and listen hard! I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you, Millman, as God is
  my judge, I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you, but it will be one or the other
  of us. Understand, Millman? One or the other of us, if you start anything
  like that! You get me, Millman? You&rsquo;ve called a showdown, and that
  goes; but, by God, unless you&rsquo;ve got a better hand than I have, you&rsquo;ll
  never send that money back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman&rsquo;s hand was resting on the package of banknotes. He pushed
  it now quietly across the table to Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not this, Dave,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;You settled that when
  I asked for all or none. This is yours&mdash;to do with as you like. Don&rsquo;t
  misunderstand me, Dave; don&rsquo;t make any mistake. You can put that package
  under your arm and leave here this minute, and I&rsquo;ll not lift a finger
  to stop you, or, after you are gone, say a word, or make any move to discredit
  your assumed death, or bring the police upon your heels. I told you once,
  Dave&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;that you could trust me. But, Dave, if
  you won&rsquo;t return the stolen money, then I will. I haven&rsquo;t any
  choice, have I? I stole it, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson stared, frowning, into the steel-gray eyes across the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get you!&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;What do you
  mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just what I say, Dave,&rdquo; Millman answered. &ldquo;That if you
  won&rsquo;t return it yourself, I will pay it back out of my own pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a minute Dave Henderson eyed the other incredulously, then he threw
  back his head and laughed, but it was not a pleasant laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will, eh!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, if you feel that way about
  it, go to it! Maybe you can afford it; I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Millman soberly, &ldquo;as far as that goes, I am
  a rich man, and I can afford it. But, Dave, I want to say this to you&rdquo;&mdash;he
  was standing up now&mdash;&ldquo;the richest man in the world couldn&rsquo;t
  afford to part with a nickel as well as you could afford to part with that
  hundred thousand dollars there. It isn&rsquo;t money that you&rsquo;ve got
  at stake, Dave. Well, that&rsquo;s all. Either you pay&mdash;or I do. It&rsquo;s
  up to you, Dave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s hands were clenching and unclenching, as he gripped
  at the edge of the table. Vaguely, dimly, he sensed an awakening something
  within him which seemed to be striving to give birth to some discordant element
  that sought to undermine and shake his resolution. It was not tangible yet,
  it was confused; his mind groped out in an effort to grasp it in a concrete
  way so that he might smother it, repudiate it, beat it down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he shot out.</p>
  <p>Millman shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you for an answer to-night,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re ready to give an answer now, and be fair to
  yourself. It&rsquo;s a pretty big stake, Dave. You&rsquo;ll never play for
  a bigger&mdash;and neither will I. I&rsquo;m staking a hundred thousand dollars
  on the Dave Henderson I know&mdash;the chap that&rsquo;s dead for a while.
  It doesn&rsquo;t matter much now whether the money is back in the hands of
  the estate in a day, or a week, or a month from now. Take a month, Dave.
  If at the end of a month the estate has not received the money from you&mdash;and
  I shall know whether it has or not&mdash;it will receive a hundred thousand
  dollars in cash from me, anonymously, with the statement that it is to square
  the account for which Dave Henderson was convicted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson raised a clenched hand, and swept it, clenched, across his
  eyes. He had it now! He understood that thing within him that seemed quite
  as eager to offer battle as he was to give it. And it was strong, and insidious,
  and crafty. He cursed at it. It took him at a disadvantage. It placed him
  suddenly on the defensive&mdash;and it angered him. It placed him in a position
  that was not a nice one to defend. He cursed at it; and blind fury came as
  his defense. And the red that had surged into his face left it, and a whiteness
  came, and his lips thinned into a straight line.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn you, Millman!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;I get you
  now! Damn you, you&rsquo;ve no right to put the screws on me like this! Who
  asked you to offer your money as a sacrifice for me&mdash;to make me out
  a white-livered cur if I turned you down! But it doesn&rsquo;t go, understand?
  It&rsquo;s blackmail, that&rsquo;s what it is! It may be whitewashed with
  holiness, but it&rsquo;s blackmail just the same&mdash;and you can go to
  hell with it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He snatched up the package of banknotes, whipped the outer wrapping around
  it, and tucked it under his arm&mdash;and paused, as though awaiting or inviting
  some action on Millman&rsquo;s part. But Millman neither moved nor spoke.
  And then Dave Henderson, with a short laugh, crossed to the door, wrenched
  it open, stepped out of the room, and slammed the door behind him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  The First Guest</b></h2>
  <p>BLIND to his surroundings, mechanically retracing his steps to the railway
  station, Dave Henderson swung along the street. He walked as though he would
  outwalk his thoughts&mdash;fast, indifferent to all about him. He clung stubbornly
  to the fury in which he had sought refuge, and which he had aroused within
  himself against Millman. He clung to this tenaciously now, because he sensed
  a persistent attempt on the part of some unwelcome and unfamiliar other-self
  to argue the pros and cons, both of Millman&rsquo;s motives and Millman&rsquo;s
  acts; an attempt, that sought to introduce a wedge doubt into his mind, that
  sought to bring about a wavering of purpose with the insidious intent of
  robbing him, if it could, of the reward that was now within his grasp.</p>
  <p>Within his grasp! He laughed out sharply, as he hurried along. It was <i>literally</i> within
  his grasp! The reward was his now&mdash;his absolutely, concretely, tangibly&mdash;the
  hundred thousand dollars was in this innocent-looking parcel that was at
  this precise moment tucked under his arm. He laughed out again. There was
  enough in that one fact to occupy his mind and attention, and to put to utter
  rout and confusion those other thoughts that endeavored to make cunning and
  tricky inroads upon him. It shattered and swept aside, as though by the waving
  of some magical wand, every mental picture he had drawn of himself in New
  York, every plan that he had made for his sojourn here.</p>
  <p>He had been prepared to spend weeks and months of unceasing effort to run
  Millman to earth; he had planned to rake the dens and dives of the underworld,
  to live as one of its sordid and outlawed inhabitants, if necessary, in order
  to get upon Millman&rsquo;s track; he had meant to play Millman at his own
  game until he had trapped Millman and the final showdown came. And, instead,
  he had scarcely been in New York an hour, and he was walking now along the
  street with the hundred thousand dollars under his arm, with Millman no longer
  a vicious and stealthy antagonist to be foiled and fought wherever he might
  be found&mdash;with nothing to do now but spend or employ this money under
  his arm as his fancy or his judgment dictated, free of all hindrance or restraint,
  for Millman was no longer a source of danger or concern, and Dave Henderson
  was dead to the world in general and to the police in particular, and that
  left Barty Lynch as the unfettered possessor of one hundred thousand dollars!</p>
  <p>Millman had given him a month, and&mdash;ah! he was back on that tack, was
  he? He clenched his hand. No! A month represented time, and it was time in
  a purely abstract way that he was considering now; it had nothing to do with
  Millman, or Millman&rsquo;s &ldquo;month,&rdquo; It would take time to make
  new plans and new arrangements. He did not intend to act hastily.</p>
  <p>He had come by that money by too brutally hard a road not to realize the
  worth of every cent of it. He needed time now to think out the future carefully.
  He was not a fool&mdash;to scatter that money to the winds. A thousand times
  in prison he had buoyed himself up with the knowledge that in the returns
  from that sum of money lay independence for life. That was what he had taken
  it for in the first place! It meant, safely invested, a minimum of five thousand
  dollars a year. He could get along very well, even luxuriously, on five thousand
  a year! He had only now to decide where and how he should invest that money;
  and he needed only now the time to arrive at that decision without any undue
  haste that might afterwards be bitterly regretted. Would he go to Australia,
  or to South America, for example, and begin life anew there as a gentleman
  of independent means? Or somewhere in Europe, perhaps? It needed time now
  to make this decision, and, as a natural corollary, a temporary abode was
  required, an abode where he could feel quite secure, both as regards his
  money, and as against any eleventh-hour trick of fate that might disclose
  his identity and spill the fat into the fire.</p>
  <p>Well, he had had that latter problem solved for him from the first, hadn&rsquo;t
  he? There was Dago George&rsquo;s; and in his pocket was Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s
  letter that was an &ldquo;open sesame&rdquo; to Dago George&rsquo;s hospitality,
  and, more vital still, to Dago George&rsquo;s fidelity. He was going there
  now, as soon as he got his dress-suit case again from the station which now
  loomed ahead of him down the block.</p>
  <p>His thoughts reverted to Nicolo Capriano, and, from the old Italian, to
  the old Italian&rsquo;s daughter. Teresa! He had not forgotten Teresa! Again
  and again, in those jolting boxcars, and during his flight from San Francisco,
  there had come a mental picture in which those fearless eyes had met his,
  and he had seen her smile, and watched the color mount and crimson her face
  as it had done on that occasion when he had first seen her.</p>
  <p>He had not forgotten Teresa, he had not tried to; he had even invited those
  mental pictures of her. It was like some fragrant and alluring memory that
  had seemed to cling to him, and he had clung to it. Some day he wanted to see
  Teresa again&mdash;and she was the only woman toward whom he had ever felt
  that way. He wasn&rsquo;t in love with her, that was ridiculous, unless he
  had fallen in love with her since he had left her! But of one thing he was
  distinctly conscious, and that was that her attitude on that last night,
  when she had let him go in so strange a way, still plagued and tormented
  him. It was as though she had slammed the door of her presence in his face,
  and he wanted to see her again&mdash;some time&mdash;and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Queer fancies crept into his brain. The old Italian said he was getting
  better. Perhaps Nicolo Capriano would like Australia, or South America&mdash;or
  perhaps Europe!</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson shrugged his shoulders a little helplessly, and smiled ironically
  at himself, as he reached and entered the station. It was Nicolo Capriano
  alone, of course, of whom he was thinking! But&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders
  again&mdash;his immediate business now was to get to this Dago George!</p>
  <p>He secured his dress-suit case from the parcel-room, deposited the package
  of banknotes in the dress-suit case, and sought a taxi. That was the easiest
  and most convenient way of reaching Dago George&rsquo;s. He did not know
  either in what direction or how far he had to go, and somehow, both physically
  and mentally, he suddenly, and for the first time, realized that he was tired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chatham Square,&rdquo; he told the starter, as he climbed into the
  taxi; and then, as the car moved forward, he leaned over and spoke to the
  chauffeur: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fellow called Dago George who keeps a place
  right near there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly where
  it is; but I guess you can find it, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said the chauffeur heartily, with an extra tip in sight, &ldquo;Sure!
  Leave it to me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson settled himself comfortably back on the seat, and relaxed.
  The strain of the days since he had left San Francisco, the strain of the
  days since the prison doors had opened and let him free, the strain of the
  five years behind those pitiless walls of stone and those bars of steel was
  gone now. The money was his, in his sole possession, here in the dress-suit
  case at his feet. It was the end of the bitter struggle. It was finished.
  He could let go now, and relax luxuriously. And, besides, he was tired.</p>
  <p>He refused to think of Millman, because it irritated him. He refused to
  think of anything now, because his brain was like some weary thing, which,
  with a sigh of relief, stretched itself out and revelled in idleness. His
  future, Nicolo Capriano, Teresa&mdash;all these could wait until to-morrow,
  until a night&rsquo;s sleep, the first he would have known for many nights
  that was not haunted by distracting doubts and problems, should bring him
  fresh to the consideration of his new plans.</p>
  <p>He lighted a cigarette and smoked, and watched the passing crowds and traffic
  through the window. He had only to present his letter to Dago George, and
  turn in for the night, with the feeling, also for the first time in many
  nights, of absolute security.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson continued to gaze out of the window. The localities through
  which he passed did not seem to improve. He smiled a little. He knew nothing
  about New York, but this was about what he had expected. Dago George was
  not likely either to reside or conduct his business in a very exclusive neighborhood!</p>
  <p>Finally the taxi stopped, but only to permit the chauffeur to ask directions
  from a passer-by on the sidewalk. They went on again then, turned a corner,
  and a moment later drew up at the curb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess this is the place all right,&rdquo; announced the chauffeur.</p>
  <p>A glance confirmed the chauffeur&rsquo;s statement. Across the somewhat
  dingy window of a barroom, as he looked out, Dave Henderson read in large,
  white, painted letters, the legend:</p>
  <p align="center">THE IRON TAVERN<br>
  GEORGES VARDI, PROP.</p>
  <p>That was Dago George&rsquo;s name, he remembered Nicolo Capriano had told
  him&mdash;Georges Vardi. He alighted, paid and dismissed the chauffeur, and
  stood for an instant on the sidewalk surveying the place.</p>
  <p>It was a small and old three-story frame building. The barroom, to which
  there was a separate entrance, bordered on a lane at his right; while, almost
  bisecting the building, another door, wide open, gave on a narrow hall&mdash;and
  this, in turn, as he could see through the end window at his left, gave access
  to the restaurant, such as it was, for at several small tables here the occupants
  were engaged in making a belated dinner. Above, there was a light or two
  in the second story windows, the third story was in complete darkness.</p>
  <p>It was certainly not over-prepossessing, and he shrugged his shoulders,
  half in a sort of philosophical recognition of a fact that was to be accepted
  whether or no, and half in a sort of acquiescent complacence. It was the
  sort of a place he wanted for the present anyhow!</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson chose the restaurant entrance. An Italian waiter, in soiled
  and spotted apron, was passing along the hall. Dave Henderson hailed the
  man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to see Dago George,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>The waiter nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tell-a da boss,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Again Dave Henderson surveyed the place&mdash;what he could see of the interior
  now. It had evidently been, in past ages, an ordinary dwelling house. The
  stairs, set back a little from the entrance, came down at his right, and
  at the foot of these there was a doorway into the barroom. At his left was
  the restaurant which he had already seen through the window. Facing him was
  the narrow hall, quite long, which ended in a closed door that boasted a
  fanlight; also there appeared to be some other mysterious means of egress
  under the stairs from the hall, an entrance to the kitchen perhaps, which
  might be in the cellar, for the waiter had disappeared in that direction.</p>
  <p>The door with the fanlight at the rear of the hall opened now, and a tall,
  angular man, thin-faced and swarthy, thrust out his head. His glance fell
  upon Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dago George&mdash;you want to see me?&rdquo; His voice,
  with scarcely a trace of accent, was suave and polite&mdash;the hotel-keeper&rsquo;s
  voice of diplomacy, tentatively gracious pending the establishment of an
  intruder&rsquo;s identity and business, even though the intrusion upon his
  privacy might be unwelcome.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson smiled, as he picked up his dress-suit case and stepped forward.
  He quite understood. The proprietor of The Iron Tavern, though he remained
  uninvitingly upon the threshold of the door, was not without tact!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson; and smiled again, as he set down
  his dress-suit case in front of the blocked doorway, and noted an almost
  imperceptible frown cross Dago George&rsquo;s face as the other&rsquo;s eyes
  rested on that article. His hand went into his pocket for Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s
  letter&mdash;but remained there. He was curious now to see, or, rather, to
  compare the reception of a stranger with the reception accorded to one vouched
  for by the old bomb king in San Francisco. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
  like to get a room here for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Dago George&rsquo;s features suddenly expressed pain and
  polite regret. &ldquo;I am so sorry&mdash;yes! I do not any longer keep
  a hotel. In the years ago&mdash;yes. But not now. It did not pay. The restaurant
  pays much better, and the rooms above for private dining parties bring the
  money much faster. I am desolated to turn you away; but since I have no rooms,
  I have no rooms, eh? So what can I do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson studied the other&rsquo;s face complacently. The man was
  not as old as Nicolo Capriano; the man&rsquo;s hair was still black and shone
  with oil, and in features he was not Nicolo Capriano at all; but somehow
  it <i>was</i> Nicolo Capriano, only in another incarnation perhaps. He nodded
  his head. He was not sorry to learn that The Iron Tavern was ultraexclusive!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come
  a long way&mdash;from a friend of yours. Perhaps that may make some difference?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A friend?&rdquo; Dago George was discreetly interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nicolo Capriano,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>Dago George leaned suddenly forward, staring into Dave Henderson&rsquo;s
  eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What is that you say? Nicolo Capriano!&rdquo; He
  caught up the dress-suit case from the floor, and caught Dave Henderson&rsquo;s
  arm, and pulled him forward into the room, and closed the door behind them. &ldquo;You
  come from Nicolo Capriano, you say? Ah, yes, my friend, that is different;
  that is <i>very</i> different. There may still be some rooms here, eh? Ha,
  ha! Yes, yes!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may possibly already have heard something from him about me,&rdquo; said
  Dave Henderson. &ldquo;Barty Lynch is the name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dago George shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a word. It is long, very long, since I have heard from Nicolo
  Capriano. But I do not forget him&mdash;no one forgets Nicolo Capriano. And
  you have come from Nicolo, eh? You have some message then&mdash;eh, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson extended the old bomb king&rsquo;s letter.</p>
  <p>Dago George motioned to a chair, as he ripped the envelope open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will excuse, while I read it&mdash;yes?&rdquo; he murmured, already
  engrossed in its contents.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson, from the proffered chair, looked around the room. It was
  blatantly a combination of sleeping room and office. In one corner was a
  bed; against the wall facing the door there was a safe; and an old roll-top
  desk flanked the safe on the other side of the only window that the room
  possessed. His eyes, from their cursory survey of his surroundings, reverted
  to Dago George. The man had folded up the letter, and was stretching out
  his hands effusively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, it is good!&rdquo; Dago George ejaculated. &ldquo;Yes, yes! Anything&mdash;anything
  that I can do for you is already as good as done. I say that from my heart.
  You are Barty Lynch&mdash;yes? And you come from the old master? Well, that
  is enough. A room! You may be sure there is a room! And now&mdash;eh&mdash;you
  have not perhaps dined yet? And what else is there? It is long, very long,
  since I have heard from the old master the old master? Well, that is enough.
  A room! You may be sure there is a room! &rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is nothing else&mdash;and not even that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There
  was a dining-car on the train to-night. There&rsquo;s not a thing, except
  to show me my room and let me turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Dago George. &ldquo;Yes, that, of course!
  But wait! The old master! It is long since I have heard from him. He says
  great things of you; and so you, too, are a friend of Nicolo Capriano. Well,
  then, it is an occasion, this meeting! We will celebrate it! A little bottle
  of wine, eh? A little bottle of wine!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, and smiled. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m
  rather all in; and, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll hit the hay to-night
  pronto.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dago George raised his hands protestingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what would Nicolo Capriano say to me for such hospitality as
  that!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;So, if not a bottle, then at least a little
  glass, eh? You will not refuse! We will drink his health&mdash;the health
  of Nicolo Capriano! Eh? Wait! Wait!&rdquo; And he rushed pell-mell from the
  room, as though his life depended upon his errand.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson laughed again. The man with his volubility and effervescence
  amused him.</p>
  <p>Dago George was back in a few minutes with a tray and two glasses of wine.
  He offered one of the glasses with an elaborate bow to Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is the best in my poor house,&rdquo; he said, and held the other
  glass aloft to the light. &ldquo;To Nicolo Capriano! To the old master! To
  the master of them all!&rdquo; he cried&mdash;and drank, rolling his wine
  on his tongue like a connoisseur.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson drained his glass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To Nicolo Capriano!&rdquo; he echoed heartily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Dago George brightly. &ldquo;One more little glass?
  No? You are sure? Well, you have said that you are tired&mdash;eh? Well,
  then, to make you comfortable! Come along with me!&rdquo; He picked up the
  dress-suit case, opened the door, and led the way into the hall He was still
  talking as he mounted the stairs. &ldquo;There will be many things for us
  to speak about, eh? But that will be for to-morrow. We are perhaps all birds
  of a feather&mdash;eh&mdash;or Nicolo Capriano perhaps would not have sent
  you here? Well, well&mdash;to-morrow, my friend, if you care to. But I ask
  nothing, you understand? You come and you go, and you talk, or you remain
  silent, as you wish. Is it not so? That is what Nicolo Capriano writes&mdash;and
  it is enough.&rdquo; He paused at the second-story landing. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he
  said, waving his hand around the dimly lighted passage. &ldquo;Little private
  dining-rooms! But there is no business to-night. Another flight, my friend,
  and perhaps we shall find better accommodations there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was as the other had said. Partially opened doors showed the three or
  four small rooms, that opened off the hall, to be fitted up as dining-rooms.
  Dave Henderson made no comment, as he followed the other up the next flight
  of stairs. He was tired. He had been telling himself lazily so from the moment
  he had taken the taxi. He was acutely aware of it now. It was the relaxation,
  of course&mdash;but he had become of a sudden infernally sleepy.</p>
  <p>Dago George unlocked a door at the head of the third floor landing, entered,
  deposited the dress-suit case on the floor, and turned on the light. He handed
  the key of the room to Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is plain, it is not rich,&rdquo; he said apologetically; &ldquo;but
  the bed is good, and you will be quiet here, my friend, very <i>quiet</i>&mdash;eh?&mdash;you
  can take my word for that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It looks good to me, all right!&rdquo; said Dave Henderson, and stifled
  a yawn. &ldquo;I certainly owe you my best thanks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dago George shrugged his shoulders in expostulation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it is nothing!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;Do you not come from
  Nicolo Capriano? Well, that is enough. But&mdash;you yawn! No, no; do not
  try to hide it! It is I who am to blame. I talk&mdash;and you would rest.
  But, one thing, my friend, before I go. It is my curiosity. The letter&mdash;it
  is signed by Nicolo Capriano, and I know the signature well&mdash;but it
  is written by a woman, is it not? How is that? I am curious. But perhaps
  you do not know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dave Henderson answered, and yawned frankly this time,
  and smiled by way of apology. &ldquo;It was his daughter who wrote it. Nicolo
  Capriano is sick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sick!&rdquo; repeated Dago George. &ldquo;I did not know! But it
  is so long since I have heard from him&mdash;yes? He is not very sick, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Dave Henderson sleepily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
  been laid up in bed for three years now, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Godam!&rdquo; ejaculated the Italian. &ldquo;Is that so! But to-morrow&mdash;eh?&mdash;we
  will talk to-morrow. Goodnight, my friend! Good-night&mdash;and sleep well!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; responded Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>He closed and locked the door as Dago George went out, and, sitting down
  on the edge of the bed, looked at his watch. It was a quarter to ten.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stretch out for ten minutes before I turn in,&rdquo; said
  Dave Henderson to himself&mdash;but at the end of ten minutes Dave Henderson
  was asleep.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  The Second Guest</b></h2>
  <p>IN the hallway of The Iron Tavern, as Dago George descended the stairs from
  Dave Henderson&rsquo;s room, a slim little figure in black, heavily veiled,
  stood waiting. Beside her, the greasy waiter, who had previously conveyed
  Dave Henderson&rsquo;s message to the proprietor, bowed and scraped and wiped
  his hands on his spotted apron, and pointed to Dago George on the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dat-a da boss,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
  <p>A taxi chauffeur had already deposited two valises in the hall, and had
  retired. Outside, as the taxi moved away, another taxi, a short, but discreet,
  distance up the block, started suddenly out from the curb, as its fare, a
  fat man who chewed upon the butt of a cigar, dug with pudgy fingers into
  his vest pocket, and handed his chauffeur an address.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Baggage and all&mdash;that&rsquo;s good enough!&rdquo; said the fat
  man to himself; and to the chauffeur: &ldquo;Beat it&mdash;and beat it fast!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The waiter retired from the hall. The almost imperceptible frown on Dago
  George&rsquo;s face at sight of the valises, was hidden by an ingratiating
  smile as he hurried forward.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;you desire to see me?&rdquo; The
  little figure in black nodded her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;in private,&rdquo; she answered quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Dago George bowed profoundly. &ldquo;But, yes&mdash;certainly!
  This way, then, if you please, madam.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He led the way into the rear room, and closed the door.</p>
  <p>The little figure in black raised her veil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you not know me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>Dago George stared for a long minute into her face. He shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am desolated!&rdquo; he murmured apologetically. &ldquo;It is my
  memory that is unbelievably stupid, madam.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am Teresa Capriano,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Dago George moved closer. He stared again into her face, and suddenly into
  his own there came the light of recognition.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;the so-little Teresa&mdash;the little bambino!&rdquo; he
  cried. &ldquo;But, yes&mdash;yes, it is true!&rdquo; He caught both her hands,
  and began to pat them effusively. &ldquo;Is it possible? Yes, yes! I begin
  to see again the little girl of the so-many years ago! Ah, no; Dago George
  has not forgotten, after all! The little Teresa! The little bandit queen!
  Eh? And you&mdash;do you remember that we called you that?&rdquo; He led
  her to a chair, and seated her. &ldquo;Well, well, the little Teresa! And
  your father, my good friend Nicolo&mdash;I had heard that he was sick. He
  is better&mdash;yes? And he is perhaps here, too, in New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father is dead,&rdquo; Teresa answered in a low voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; Dago George drew back, and stared again, but in a curiously
  bewildered way now. &ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You say that
  Nicolo Capriano is&mdash;dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, and turned her face away from his gaze&mdash;only
  to raise her eyes again, and watch the man covertly, narrowly, as he now
  began to walk rapidly up and down the room with quick, nervous strides. Her
  hands tightened a little on the arms of her chair. Here was the end of that
  long race across the continent, the goal of those fearsome, harried days
  of haste in San Francisco while her father lay dead. Was she first or last
  in that frantic race? What did Dago George know? A thousand times she had
  pictured this scene, and planned for it every word and act that was to be
  hers&mdash;but it was actuality now, and the room for an instant seemed to
  swirl around her. <i>She</i> remembered Dago George&mdash;as one of the most
  crafty, callous and unscrupulous of the lawless band over whom the man who
  had been her father had reigned as king. The letter! Had Dago George received
  it&mdash;yes or no? Had Dave Henderson reached here before her? Was he already
  in danger; or did it require but just a simple bit of acting on her part
  to undo the treachery of which her father had been guilty&mdash;a simple
  story, for instance, that she was on her way to her father&rsquo;s people
  in Italy, which would enable her to stay here in this place unsuspected until
  Dave Henderson came, and she could intercept him, and warn him before any
  harm was done? Which was it? She dared not ask. If Dago George knew nothing,
  he must at all costs continue to know nothing. A hint, and Dago George, if
  he were the Dago George of old, would be like a bloodhound on the scent,
  and, exactly as though Dago George had actually received her father&rsquo;s
  letter, Dave Henderson would be the quarry. But if, on the other hand, the
  letter had already been delivered, well, then&mdash;then there was another
  r&ocirc;le to play. She dared not ask; not until Dago George had shown his
  hand, not until she was sure of her own ground. She turned her head away
  again; Dago George had halted abruptly in front of her chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; he said uneasily. &ldquo;You say that Nicolo Capriano,
  that your father, is dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa nodded without looking up.</p>
  <p>Dago George, as abruptly as he had halted, turned and paced the length of
  the room and back again, and abruptly halted once more in front of her. He
  leaned toward her, one hand now laid over his heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am unpardonable!&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I say nothing to
  you of your so-great grief. I do not sympathize. I am heartless! But you
  will forgive! It is the shock of my own grief for the loss of my friend from
  which I have not recovered. I bleed for you in your deep sorrow. My poor
  little bambino! But you understand&mdash;yes&mdash;do you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa&rsquo;s hands, in her lap now, toyed with one of her gloves which
  she had taken off. She did not look up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; murmured Dago George. &ldquo;You understand! But
  we will speak no more of that now&mdash;it is but to depress us both. There
  are other things&mdash;that you have come all this way from San Francisco,
  and that you have come immediately to me, for you have but just arrived in
  New York to-night, is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Teresa answered. &ldquo;The train was very late. I came
  here at once from the station.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, thanks to your train being late,&rdquo; said Dago George, with
  a significant lowering of his voice, &ldquo;I think I can tell you why you
  came. If you had been an hour earlier, it would have been you who would have
  had to tell me. Eh? Is it not so? There was a letter&mdash;eh? A letter which
  you wrote for Nicolo Capriano, for your father&mdash;is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The blood seemed suddenly to Teresa to grow hot, and as suddenly to grow
  chill and cold in her veins. Dago George had answered her question. Dave
  Henderson had already delivered the letter! It brought fear; but it brought,
  too, a sense of relief. The road was clear now before her. It was her wits
  against Dago George&mdash;to draw, and win, and hold the other&rsquo;s full
  and unreserved confidence, to make herself appear essential to Dago George&mdash;for
  an hour&mdash;a week&mdash;a month&mdash;until she could reach Dave Henderson,
  wherever he might be, and meanwhile checkmate any move that this man here
  might make. She glanced furtively, with well simulated caution, around her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, in a guarded voice. &ldquo;You are right. It
  is the letter that brought me. What else? My father died the night it was
  written. He had no time to communicate with you. I do not know all, but I
  know enough, I think, to make the matter sure. There is a great deal of money
  at stake, and so I came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Dago George was whispering excitedly now. &ldquo;Wait!
  Wait a minute, my little bambino!&rdquo; He ran to the door, opened it, looked
  out, closed and locked it again, and, crossing the room, pulled the half
  drawn roller shade down to the window sill. He drew a chair close up to Teresa&rsquo;s,
  and sat down. &ldquo;It is better to be sure, is it not? Yes, yes! And we
  will continue to speak English, eh? It is less understood here. Ah, my little
  bambino! You are your father&rsquo;s daughter! Yes, yes! Nicolo Capriano
  is not dead! Well, the letter, eh? There is money in it, much money in it,
  you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. Her voice sharpened, and became a little
  imperious. &ldquo;Yes, there is money in it, provided you have not lost
  sight of the man who brought the letter to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dago George rubbed his hands together softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have no fear of that!&rdquo; he whispered eagerly. &ldquo;Dago George
  did not serve under Nicolo Capriano for nothing! The young man is upstairs,
  and safely asleep. He came perhaps a little more than half an hour ago. We
  had a little glass of wine together, and&mdash;&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders,
  and made a significant little circling motion with his thumb and forefinger.</p>
  <p>Teresa&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted in frank impatience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; she asked sharply.</p>
  <p>Again Dago George shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have I not said that he is&mdash;asleep?&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drugged!&rdquo; exclaimed Teresa.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, yes&mdash;naturally! What would you have?&rdquo; smiled Dago
  George.</p>
  <p>Teresa&rsquo;s glove slipped from her lap to the floor. She was deliberate
  and long in picking it up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; There was irritation and censure in her voice now,
  as she looked up at him and frowned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why! You know
  nothing of the reasons that prompted my father to write that letter. Why should
  you drug him? What could you expect to accomplish by that, except to excite
  his suspicions when he wakes up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, but you do me an injustice, my little bambino!&rdquo; said Dago
  George smoothly. &ldquo;It was but a pinch of the drug, a drug that I know
  very well, and that never plays tricks on me. He has had but enough to last
  for four or five hours, and he will experience no ill effects when he wakes
  up. You can trust Dago George for that. And as for why&mdash;what else could
  I do? It was precisely because I had had no word from Nicolo Capriano, and
  because it was all a mystery to me, except that the letter was signed <i>con
  amore</i>. Eh? You know well enough what that means, and that it was not
  to be disobeyed. The man must never leave my sight or hands until the little
  game, whatever it was, was played out. Is it not so? It was also necessary
  that, having nothing further from the old master to guide me, I should look
  this Signor Barty Lynch over for myself&mdash;yes? Is it not so, my little
  bambino?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa preserved her frown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she admitted, with well assumed unwillingness. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dago George drew a little closer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he is safe upstairs, then. You see that Dago George had his
  head about him, after all, eh? And now&mdash;the letter! What is it that
  the old master was about to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa&rsquo;s mind was working swiftly. Dave Henderson was upstairs, drugged,
  but safe so far. It might be hours before he could make any move; but by
  morning surely, by morning before daylight, he could get away, and until
  then she must stay here. There was only one way she could do that without
  arousing suspicion, and at the same time have freedom of action&mdash;as
  an ally, an indispensable ally, of this man here. There was only one dominating
  consideration, therefore, to guide her in what, or how much, she told Dago
  George, for once Dave Henderson had slipped away that was the last Dago George
  would ever see of him, or her; and the consideration involved was, that,
  while she knew Dago George too well to trust him in the smallest degree,
  Dago George must be made to trust <i>her</i> in the fullest measure, and
  from the strongest of all reasons from Dago George&rsquo;s standpoint&mdash;that
  of self-interest. And the surest way to accomplish that was to tell Dago
  George enough of the truth to, at one and the same time, arouse his cupidity
  and leave him in a sense dependent upon her cooperation for his future activities.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can only tell you what I heard them saying to each other that night
  when I wrote that letter for my father,&rdquo; she said deliberately. &ldquo;But
  that is enough, I think; anyway, it was enough to decide me to come here
  to you. My father, of course, intended to communicate with you&mdash;in just
  what way, I do not know&mdash;but he died that same night. The only thing,
  then, that I could see to do was to get here without a moment&rsquo;s delay,
  and I left San Francisco immediately after my father&rsquo;s burial. You
  understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; Dago George nodded his head vigorously in assent. &ldquo;But,
  of course! Yes, yes, my little bambino! Well&mdash;and then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She leaned forward impressively toward Dago George.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This Barty Lynch stole some money,&rdquo; she said, in a quick, eager
  voice; &ldquo;a great deal of money, thousands; I heard them speak of a
  hundred thousand. My father had helped him to get away from the police; that
  is why he trusted my father. But this money was stolen again from Barty Lynch
  by a man who Barty Lynch said had run here to New York for cover. That is
  what has brought Barty Lynch here&mdash;to find that man, and get the money
  back. You see? Once Barty Lynch gets hold of the money again, he&mdash;but
  that is why my father gave him a letter to you, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Signed it <i>con amore</i> broke in Dago George,&rdquo; whispering
  feverishly, and almost as though speaking to himself. &ldquo;Yes, yes! I
  see! It is the hand of the old master, and it has lost none of its cunning!
  Yes, yes! I see! There is no risk! It is stolen money to begin with! Signor
  Barty Lynch has no recourse to the law! And even if Signor Barty Lynch <i>disappeared</i>&mdash;eh?&mdash;who
  is to know the difference, since he has already arranged things so nicely
  in hiding himself away from the police! Eh? Yes! It is excellent, superb!
  Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa&rsquo;s face was impassive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, except that we have not got that money yet!&rdquo; she said
  curtly. &ldquo;It may not be as easy as it looks. That is why I am here&mdash;to
  help; and also&rdquo;&mdash;she stared Dago George levelly in the face&mdash;&ldquo;to
  see that Dago George does not get more than his share.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Italian&rsquo;s hands were raised instantly in protestation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, my little bambino&mdash;that you should say that!&rdquo; He
  shook his head in an aggrieved way. &ldquo;I am hurt that you should think
  I forget Nicolo Capriano, though he is dead, or that you should think I would
  do anything like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor do I think so,&rdquo; she answered steadily. &ldquo;I warn you,
  that is all. We shall work all the better together if we understand to begin
  with that Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s daughter, though Nicolo Capriano is dead,
  has still some power; and if we understand that this is Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s
  plan, and not yours, and that the division will be made on the same basis
  that Nicolo Capriano would have made it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is Nicolo himself speaking,&rdquo; murmured Dago George. He was
  smiling now. &ldquo;I had no thought of anything but that. It is understood.
  I could ask for nothing better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is nothing to be done at
  first then, but to watch him in everything he does here in New York. You
  have plenty of men you can depend upon&mdash;I know that; but I think I can
  do more, or at least as much, as they can, and certainly with all of us working
  together we should succeed. He is in a room upstairs, you say. You have another
  one next to his that is empty, perhaps? Yes? Well, that is good. I will take
  it. He will be surprised to see me here, but he will not be suspicious. He
  believes that you were a very intimate friend of my father. Naturally, then,
  it would be at the house of that intimate friend that I would come to stay
  when, owing to my father&rsquo;s death, I am making arrangements to sail
  to my father&rsquo;s people back in Italy. Barty Lynch trusted my father
  absolutely. That is plain. He therefore trusts me equally. It may not even
  be necessary to watch him; he is even more likely than not&mdash;if he is
  played right&mdash;to make a confident of me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dago George rubbed his hands together excitedly. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It
  is superb! I salute you. You do credit to Nicolo Capriano! Ah, my little
  bambino, you have your father&rsquo;s brains!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa, with a prettily imperious nod of her head, rose from her chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is getting late,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It must be nearly eleven
  o&rsquo;clock, and I have had a long journey. Since he is drugged, he is
  safe for the time being, and there is nothing more to be done to-night. To-morrow
  we can begin our work. Take me to my room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;it is superb!&rdquo; Dago George repeated exultantly. He
  bowed Teresa to the door, and, picking up the valises, led the way upstairs.
  He chuckled with perverted humor, as they passed Dave Henderson&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;He
  is in there,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but we must not disturb his rest, eh?
  He said he was very tired!&rdquo; He ushered Teresa into the next room, and
  turned on the light. &ldquo;If there is anything that the little bambino
  requires?&rdquo;&mdash;his head and hands gestured eloquently.</p>
  <p>Teresa was looking around the none too clean, and none too well furnished,
  room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Dago George retreated to the door. He cleared his throat, and hesitated,
  and shuffled a little awkwardly with his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is that the little bambino will know that I am thinking of her
  great sorrow, though I have said little, that I speak of it again,&rdquo; he
  said softly. &ldquo;The master has been long dead? It is true you have told
  me he died on the night you wrote that letter for him, but the letter&rdquo;&mdash;he
  produced it from his pocket, and scanned it earnestly&mdash;&ldquo;yes, I
  am right&mdash;it bears no date.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father died nine days ago,&rdquo; Teresa answered tersely, and
  half turned away her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! Nine days ago!&rdquo; Dago George shook his head sorrowfully,
  as he backed across the threshold. &ldquo;The old master! It is very sad!
  Nine days ago! It is very sad! I wish you repose, my little bambino. Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Teresa closed and locked the door behind Dago George&mdash;and stood still
  for an instant listening. Dago George&rsquo;s footsteps died away on the
  stairs below. She moved a little then, and stood with her ear pressed against
  the partition of the next room. There was no sound. And then she began to
  walk slowly about the room, and a few minutes later, the time that it would
  ordinarily have taken her to prepare for bed, she turned out the light&mdash;and
  sat down in a chair, fully dressed, and stared into the blackness.</p>
  <p>She pressed her hand a little wearily across her eyes. She was here now
  at the end of those thousands of miles, every one of which had seemed to
  yawn as some impassable gulf between her and her goal; she was here now,
  and, in spite of her fears, she had reached that goal&mdash;in time. She
  had even outwitted&mdash;for the moment anyhow&mdash;Dago George. True, Dave
  Henderson lay there in that next room drugged, but she was not too late.
  She smiled a little ironically. In a purely literal sense she was too early!
  She dared not make a move now for perhaps hours yet, not until she was sure
  the house was closed for the night, and that Dago George&mdash;she did not
  trust Dago George&mdash;had gone to bed.</p>
  <p>And so she must sit here and stare into the blackness. She would not fall
  asleep; there was no fear of that. She could not sleep. Already thoughts
  and memories, as myriad in divergence as they were in numbers, were crowding
  upon her, and goading her brain into an abnormal and restless activity.</p>
  <p>She twisted her hands together now in her lap. She remembered, and she could
  not forget, the horror and the fear of that night when her father had died,
  and of the days thereafter when she had performed&mdash;alone&mdash;the last
  duties that had devolved upon her. Yes, it had been alone. She had lied to
  Dago George. It had been alone! If Nicolo Capriano had had friends and been
  powerful in life, Nicolo Capriano had been alone in death. She had lied to
  Dago George; there had been no heritage of power. She had lied&mdash;but
  then her whole life was a lie!</p>
  <p>A low sound, a bitter moan, came suddenly from her lips. It was not the
  Teresa now who had faced Dago George with cool complacence in the room below.
  She slipped from the chair to her knees, and buried her face in her hands.
  It was the black hour, of which she had known so many since that fearful
  night, that surged and swept upon her now again. It whirled scenes and thoughts
  of the past, and pictures of the future, before her like some bewildering
  and tormenting kaleidoscope. She could not define to herself her feelings
  relative to her father&rsquo;s death; grief seemed to mingle indissolubly
  with bitter abhorrence at his act of treachery. But in another way her father&rsquo;s
  death meant something to her that she was coming to grasp more clearly. It
  seemed to release her from something, from&mdash;from a tangled life.</p>
  <p>All her life had been a lie. She was the daughter of a criminal, and all
  her life had been a lie; her environment had been a lie. In big things, in
  little things, it had been a lie. She had lied to herself that night when
  she had let this man in the next room here go without a word of protest from
  her lips to carry out a criminal act. She had been a coward that night, and
  it had shamed her. She had owed something to her father, a loyalty to her
  father; perhaps, fundamentally, that was the basis for her refusal to face
  the issue squarely that night; perhaps it was because the habit of years,
  the lies, and only lies, that had been lived around her, had strangled her
  and weakened her. Perhaps it was that; but if so, and if she had owed and
  given loyalty to her father, then she had given more than loyalty&mdash;she
  had given her soul. And her soul turned miserably away from this pitiful
  landscape of life upon which now she was forcing it to gaze.</p>
  <p>But this was a picture of the past, for if it were true, or in any degree
  true, her father&rsquo;s death had brought her release&mdash;her father was
  dead. And so she faced the future&mdash;alone. In so many a different sense&mdash;alone.
  She was alone now, a free agent to mold her own life, and the test was before
  her; whether the lie, for example, she had acted that night when she had
  sent Dave Henderson away, was the outcome of things extraneous to her soul,
  or inherent in that soul itself. Her hands, that clasped her face, tightened.
  Thank God, she knew! Thank God, that from the moment her brain had staggered
  out of its blind pit of horror and darkness on that night, she had seen the
  way clearly lighted before her! Her first duty was to save the man in the
  next room from her father&rsquo;s treachery, and she was here now to do that;
  but she was here, too, to do something else. She could, and would, stand
  between Dave Henderson and the personal harm that threatened him through
  the trust he had reposed in Nicolo Capriano, and she would do this at any
  cost and at any sacrifice to herself; but she could not, and she would not,
  connive at anything that would tend to keep the stolen money from the possession
  of its rightful owners.</p>
  <p>Her hands lifted now and pressed hard against her temples, which had begun
  to throb. Yes, and she must do even more than that. There had been not only
  treachery on her father&rsquo;s part toward Dave Henderson, there had been
  treachery and trickery toward the police in an effort to cover up the stolen
  money; and, tacitly at least, she had been an accomplice in that, and therefore
  morally she was as much a thief as that man next door, as much a thief as
  her father had intended to be&mdash;unless now, with all her strength, with
  all her might, she strove to undo and make restitution for a crime in which
  she had had a part. If it lay within her power, not adventitiously, not through
  haphazard, but through the employment toward that end of every faculty of
  brain and wit and courage she possessed, she had no choice now but to get
  possession of that money and return it to the authorities. Her conscience
  was brutally frank on that point, and brutally direct; there was no room
  to temporize, no halfway course&mdash;and here was the final, ultimate and
  supreme test.</p>
  <p>Her face in the darkness whitened. Her lips moved silently. It was strength
  and help she asked now. Her mind was already made up. She would fight for,
  and, in any way or by any means that offered, get that money, and return
  it. And that meant that <i>she</i> must watch Dave Henderson, too. There
  was no other way of getting it. He alone knew where it was, and since it
  was not to be expected that he would voluntarily give it up, there seemed
  left but one alternative&mdash;to <i>take</i> it from him.</p>
  <p>Her mind was almost overpoweringly swift now in its flow of tormenting thoughts.
  It seemed an impossible situation that she should warn him of danger from
  one source, only to do to him again what&mdash;no! His life was not in danger
  with her; that was the difference. But&mdash;but it was not easy to bring
  herself to this. She was alone now, with no bonds between herself and any
  living soul, except those strange, incongruous bonds between herself and
  that man in the next room whom she was, in the same breath, both trying to
  save and trying to outwit. Why was it that he was a thief? They could have
  been friends if he were not a thief; and she would have been so glad of a
  friend now, and she had liked him, and he did not look like a thief. Perhaps
  her mother had liked Nicolo Capriano in the early days, and perhaps Nicolo
  Capriano then had not looked like a thief, and perhaps her mother had counted
  on turning Nicolo Capriano into an honest man, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Teresa rose abruptly to her feet. She felt the hot color flood her face.
  She saw the man as he had stood that first night on the threshold of her
  father&rsquo;s room, and he had looked at her so long and steadily&mdash;and
  there had been no offence in his look. She caught her breath sharply. Her
  mind was running riot! It must not do that! She had many things to accomplish
  tonight, and she would need all her wits.</p>
  <p>She forced her thoughts violently into another channel. How long would it
  be before this Iron Tavern closed for the night, and Dago George was in bed
  and asleep? She did not trust Dago George! She knew him as one utterly without
  scruples, and one who was insidiously crafty and dangerously cunning. She
  began to rehearse again the scene that she had had with him&mdash;and suddenly
  drew herself up tensely. Why, at the last moment as he had left the room,
  had he reverted to her father&rsquo;s death, and why had he waited until
  then, when it should naturally have been one of his first questions, to inquire&mdash;so
  plausibly&mdash;when her father&rsquo;s death had taken place?</p>
  <p>Her lips grew suddenly hard. Nine days! She had told him nine days. Was
  there any significance in that&mdash;to Dago George, or to herself? She had
  been delayed in leaving San Francisco by her father&rsquo;s funeral. Dave
  Henderson had left there several days earlier, but he had only arrived here
  at Dago George&rsquo;s to-night. True, the difference in time might be accounted
  for through Dave Henderson&rsquo;s presumed necessity of travelling under
  cover; but, equally, it might not. Had Dago George thought of that&mdash;as
  she was thinking of it now? Was it possible that Dave Henderson had <i>already</i> got
  that money, and had come here for refuge with it; that it was now, at this
  moment, in that next room there, and that, below stairs, Dago George, too,
  was sitting, waiting for the hours to pass, and sleep to come to all but
  himself!</p>
  <p>She went mechanically to the window, and stood for a moment staring out
  upon a vista of dark, shadowy buildings that made jagged, ill-defined points
  against the sky-line&mdash;and then, with a sudden start, she raised the
  window cautiously, soundlessly, inch by inch, and leaned out. Yes, she was
  right! The iron platform of a fire-escape was common to her room and to the
  room next door.</p>
  <p>For another moment she stood there, and then returned softly across the
  room to her chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is too early yet!&rdquo; she whispered&mdash;and, with her chin
  in her hands, settled back in her chair, and stared into the blackness.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  The Third Guest</b></h2>
  <p>BOOKIE SKARVAN, alias the fat man in the taxicab who chewed on the butt
  of his cigar, leaned back in his seat, and nibbed his pudgy hands together
  in a sort of gratified self-applause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Baggage and all,&rdquo; repeated Bookie Skarvan to himself. &ldquo;I
  guess that&rsquo;s good enough&mdash;what? I guess that&rsquo;s where she&rsquo;s
  going to hang out, all right. And I guess the place looks the part! The Iron
  Tavern&mdash;eh?&rdquo; He read the window sign, as his taxi rolled by. &ldquo;Well,
  leave it to Bookie! I guess I&rsquo;ll blow back there by-and-by and register&mdash;if
  the rates ain&rsquo;t too high! But there ain&rsquo;t no hurry! I&rsquo;ve
  been sticking around now for five years, and I guess I can take a few minutes
  longer just to make sure the numbers go up right on the board this time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan, with the adroit assistance of his tongue, shifted the cigar
  butt to the other corner of his mouth. He expectorated on the floor of the
  taxi&mdash;and suddenly frowned uneasily. He had had uneasy moments more
  than once on his late trip across the continent, but they were due, not so
  much to the fear that anything was wrong with his &ldquo;dope-sheet,&rdquo; as
  they were to the element of superstition which was inherent in him as a gambler&mdash;so
  far he had not had any luck with that hundred thousand dollars, in the theft
  of which he had been forestalled by Dave Henderson five years ago. That was
  what was the matter. He was leery of his luck.</p>
  <p>He chewed savagely. He had an attack of that superstition now&mdash;but
  at least he knew the panacea to be employed. At times such as these he communed
  and reasoned patiently with himself. He communed with himself now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, she knows where the money is! She&rsquo;s the dark horse, and
  the long shot&mdash;and I got the tip and the inside dope, ain&rsquo;t I?
  Sure, she&rsquo;s the play!&rdquo; he reassured himself. &ldquo;She hustled
  that funeral along something fierce. And she went tearing around like a wet
  hen raising money, letting things go and grabbing at any old price until
  she&rsquo;d got enough to see her through, and then she suddenly locks the
  house up and beats it like hell. &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t natural, was it? She
  was in <i>some hurry</i>&mdash;believe me! What did she do it for&mdash;eh?
  Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, Bookie&mdash;on the quiet. What Nicolo Capriano
  knew, she knew. And Nicolo Capriano wasn&rsquo;t the bird to let one hundred
  thousand dollars get as close to his claws as it did without him taking a
  crack at it. If you ask me, Nicolo pulled Dave Henderson&rsquo;s leg for
  the dope; and if you ask me, Nicolo was the guy who handed out that bomb,
  and he did it to bump Dave Henderson off&mdash;same as I figured to do once&mdash;and
  cop the loot for himself. Mabbe I&rsquo;m wrong&mdash;but I guess I&rsquo;m
  not. And I guess the odds weren&rsquo;t too rotten to stake a ride on across
  the country, I guess they weren&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie lifted a fat hand, pushed back his hat, and scratched ruminatively
  at the hair over his right temple.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave must have had a pal, or he must have slipped it to some one
  that time Baldy chased him in the car. It must have been that&mdash;he slipped
  it to some one during them days the bulls was chasing him, and whoever it
  was mabbe has been keeping it for him here in New York. So she beats it for
  New York&mdash;what? It don&rsquo;t figure out any other way. He didn&rsquo;t
  go nowhere and get it after he got out of prison, <i>I</i> know that. And
  he got killed the same night, and he didn&rsquo;t have it then. Sure, Capriano
  bumped him off! Sure, my hunch is good for the limit! Dave fell for the Lomazzi
  talk, and goes and puts his head on Nicolo&rsquo;s bosom so&rsquo;s to give
  the police the go-by, and Nicolo sucks the orange dry and heaves away the
  pip! And then the old geezer cashes in himself, and the girl flies the coop.
  Mabbe she don&rsquo;t know nothing about it&rdquo;&mdash;Bookie Skarvan stuck
  his tongue in his cheek, and grinned ironically&mdash;&ldquo;oh, no, mabbe
  she don&rsquo;t! And I guess there ain&rsquo;t any family resemblance between
  the old man and the girl, neither&mdash;eh?&mdash;oh, no, mabbe not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The taxi stopped abruptly. The chauffeur reached around and dexterously
  opened the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; he announced briefly.</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan looked out&mdash;upon a very shabby perspective. With the
  sole exception of a frankly dirty and disreputable saloon, designated as &ldquo;O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s,&rdquo; which
  faced him across the sidewalk, the neighborhood appeared to consist of nothing
  but Chinese tea-shops, laundries, restaurants, and the like; while the whole
  street, gloomy and ill-lighted, was strewn with unprepossessing basement
  entrances where one descended directly from the sidewalk to the cellar level
  below.</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan picked up his hand-bag, descended to the sidewalk, paid and
  dismissed the chauffeur, and pushed his way in through the swinging doors
  of the saloon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I guess I ain&rsquo;t drinking&mdash;not here!&rdquo; confided Bookie
  Skarvan to himself, as he surveyed the unkempt, sawdust-strewn floor and
  dirty furnishings, and a group of equally unkempt and hard-looking loungers
  that lined the near end of the bar. &ldquo;No, I guess not,&rdquo; said
  Bookie to himself; &ldquo;but I guess it&rsquo;s the place, all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made his way to the unoccupied end of the bar. The single barkeeper that
  the place evidently boasted disengaged himself from the group of loungers,
  and approached Bookie Skarvan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo; he inquired indifferently.</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan leaned confidentially over the rail, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking
  for a gentleman by the name of Smeeks,&rdquo; he said, and his left eyelid
  drooped, &ldquo;Cunny Smeeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The barkeeper&rsquo;s restless black eyes, out of an unamiable and unshaven
  face, appraised Bookie Skarvan, and Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s well-to-do appearance
  furtively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new one on me!&rdquo; he observed blandly. &ldquo;Never
  heard of him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan shifted his cigar butt&mdash;with his tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; he said&mdash;and leaned a little further
  over the bar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come a long way to see him. I&rsquo;m a
  stranger here, and mabbe I&rsquo;ve got the wrong place. Mabbe I&rsquo;ve
  got the wrong name too&rdquo;&mdash;Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s left eyelid twitched
  again&mdash;&ldquo;mabbe you&rsquo;d know him better as the Scorpion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mabbe I would&mdash;if I knew him at all,&rdquo; said the barkeeper
  non-committally. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s your lay? Fly-cop?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking now!&rdquo; said Bookie Skarvan, with a grin.
  He pulled a letter from his pocket, and pushed it across the bar. &ldquo;You
  can let the Scorpion figure out for himself how much of a fly-cop I am when
  he gets his lamps on that. And it&rsquo;s kind of important! Get me&mdash;friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The barkeeper picked up the plain, sealed envelope&mdash;and twirled it
  meditatively in his hands for a moment, while his eyes again searched Bookie
  Skarvan&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Youse seem to know yer way about!&rdquo; he admitted finally, as
  though not unfavorably impressed by this later inspection.</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan shoved a cigar across the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s straight goods, colonel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  all the way from &rsquo;Frisco, and everything&rsquo;s on the level. I didn&rsquo;t
  blow in here on a guess. Start the letter on its way, and let the Scorpion
  call the turn. If he don&rsquo;t want to see me, he don&rsquo;t have to.
  See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said the barkeeper abruptly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
  tellin&rsquo; youse straight I ain&rsquo;t seen him to-night, an&rsquo; I
  ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s to be found, or that he&rsquo;s stickin&rsquo; around
  here anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait,&rdquo; said Bookie Skarvan pleasantly.</p>
  <p>The barkeeper walked down the length of the bar, disappeared through a door
  at the rear for a moment, and, returning, rejoined the group at the upper
  end of the room.</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan waited.</p>
  <p>Perhaps five minutes passed. The door at the rear of the bar opened slightly,
  the barkeeper sauntered down in that direction, and an instant later nodded
  his head over his shoulder to Bookie Skarvan, motioning him to come around
  the end of the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cunny&rsquo;ll see youse,&rdquo; he announced, stepping aside from
  the doorway to allow Bookie Skarvan to pass. &ldquo;De Chink&rsquo;ll show
  youse de way.&rdquo; He grinned suddenly. &ldquo;I guess youse are on de
  level all right, or youse wouldn&rsquo;t be goin&rsquo; where youse are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The door closed behind him, and Bookie Skarvan found himself in a narrow,
  dimly-lighted passage. A small, wizened Chinaman, in a white blouse, standing
  in front of him, smiled blandly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You fliend of Scorpy&rsquo;s&mdash;that allee same belly glood. You
  come,&rdquo; invited the man, and scuffled off along the had.</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan followed&mdash;and smiled to himself in complacent satisfaction.
  Cunny Smeeks, alias the Scorpion, was, if surroundings were any criterion,
  living up to his reputation&mdash;which was a not insignificant item on Bookie
  Skarvan&rsquo;s &ldquo;dope-sheet&rdquo;&mdash;as one of the &ldquo;safest,&rdquo; as
  well as one of the most powerful criminal leaders in the underworld of New
  York.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said Bookie Skarvan to himself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
  the way I got the dope&mdash;and it&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The passage swerved suddenly, and became almost black. Bookie Skarvan could
  just barely make out the flutter of the white blouse in front of him. And
  then the guide&rsquo;s voice floated back:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Allee same stlairs here&mdash;you look out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cautioned, Bookie Skarvan descended a steep flight of stairs warily into
  what was obviously, though it was too dark to see, a cellar. Ahead of him,
  however, there appeared, as through an opening of some sort, a faint glow
  of light again, and toward this the white blouse fluttered its way. And then
  Bookie Skarvan found himself in another passage; and a strange, sweetish
  odor came to his nostrils; and strange sounds, subdued whisperings, rustlings,
  the dull ring of metal like coin thrown upon a table, reached his ears. And
  there seemed to be doors now on either side, and curtained hangings, and
  it was soft and silent underfoot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; observed Bookie Skarvan to himself. &ldquo;I dunno&mdash;it
  ain&rsquo;t got much on &rsquo;Frisco, at that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The guide halted, and opened a door. A soft, mellow light shone out. Bookie
  Skarvan smiled knowingly. He was not altogether unsophisticated! A group
  of richly dressed Chinamen were absorbed in cards. Scarcely one of them looked
  up. Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s eyes passed over the group almost contemptuously,
  and fixed on the only man in the room who was not playing, and, likewise,
  the only man present who was not an Oriental, and who, with hands in his
  pockets, and slouch hat pushed back from his forehead, stood watching the
  game&mdash;a man who was abnormally short in stature, and enormously broad
  in shoulder, who had hair of a violently aggressive red, and whose eyes,
  as he turned now to look toward the door, were of a blue so faded as to make
  them unpleasantly colorless.</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan remained tentatively on the threshold. He needed no further
  introduction&mdash;no one to whom the man had been previously described could
  mistake Cunny Smeeks, alias the Scorpion.</p>
  <p>The other came quickly forward now with outstretched hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any friend of Baldy Vickers is a friend of mine,&rdquo; he said heartily. &ldquo;You
  want to see me&mdash;eh? Well, come along, cull, where we can talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He led the way a little further down the passage, and into another room,
  and closed the door. The furnishings here were meager, and evidently restricted
  entirely to the votaries of poppy. There was a couch, and beside it a small
  tabouret for the opium smoker&rsquo;s paraphernalia.</p>
  <p>The Scorpion pointed to the couch; and possessed himself of the tabouret,
  which he straddled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;Have a drink?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bookie Skarvan. &ldquo;Thanks just the same. I guess
  I won&rsquo;t take anything to-night.&rdquo; He grinned significantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  likely to be busy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Scorpion nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure&mdash;all right!&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll
  get to cases, then. Baldy says in his letter that you and him are in on a
  deal, and that you may want a card or two slipped you to fill your hand.
  What&rsquo;s the lay, and what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit of a long story.&rdquo; Bookie Skarvan removed the
  cigar butt from his lips, eyed it contemplatively for a moment, finally flung
  it away, fished another cigar from his pocket, and, without lighting it,
  settled it firmly between his back teeth. &ldquo;I got to be fair with you,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;Baldy said he handed it to you straight in the letter, but I
  got to make sure you understand. We think we got a good thing, and, if it
  is, anything you do ain&rsquo;t going for nothing; but there&rsquo;s always
  the chance that it&rsquo;s a bubble, and that there&rsquo;s a hole gets kicked
  in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Cunny Smeeks, alias the Scorpion,
  easily. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything coming I&rsquo;ll get mine&mdash;and
  I&rsquo;m satisfied with any division that Baldy puts across. Baldy and me
  know each other pretty well. You can forget all that end of it&mdash;Baldy&rsquo;s
  the whitest boy I ever met, and what Baldy says goes with me all the way.
  Go ahead with the story&mdash;spill it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The details don&rsquo;t count with you,&rdquo; said Bookie Skarvan
  slowly; &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no use gumming up the time with them. The
  bet is that a nice, sweet, little Italian girl, that&rsquo;s just piked faster&rsquo;n
  hell across the continent, knows where there&rsquo;s a hundred thousand dollars
  in cold cash, that was pinched and hidden five years ago by a fellow named
  Dave Henderson&mdash;see? Dave served his spaces, and got out a few days
  ago&mdash;and croaked&mdash;got blown up with a Dago bomb&mdash;get me? He
  didn&rsquo;t have no time to enjoy his wealth&mdash;kind of tough, eh? Well
  he stood in with this Italian girl&rsquo;s father, an old crook named Nicolo
  Capriano, and he went there the night he got out of prison. The way we got
  it doped out is that the old Italian, after getting next to where the money
  was, bumped off Dave Henderson himself&mdash;see? Then Nicolo dies of heart
  disease, and the girl hardly waits to bury the old man decently, and beats
  it for here&mdash;me trailing her on the same train. Well, I guess that&rsquo;s
  all&mdash;you can figure for yourself why we&rsquo;re interested in the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I get you!&rdquo; said the Scorpion, with a sinister grin. &ldquo;It
  don&rsquo;t look very hard bucking up against a lone female, and I guess
  you can telegraph Baldy that he don&rsquo;t need to worry. What do you want&mdash;a
  bunch to pinch the girl, or a box-worker to crack a safe? You can have anything
  that&rsquo;s on tap&mdash;and I guess that ain&rsquo;t passing up many bets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want either&mdash;not yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
  girl ain&rsquo;t got the money yet, and there ain&rsquo;t anything to do
  but just watch her and keep her from getting scared until she either grabs
  it, or lets out where it is.&rdquo; He leaned forward toward the Scorpion. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye
  know a place, not far from here, that&rsquo;s called The Iron Tavern?&rdquo; he
  demanded abruptly.</p>
  <p>The Scorpion shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everybody knows it!&rdquo; he said caustically. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  a dump! It&rsquo;s the rendezvous of the worst outfit of black-handers in
  America; and the guy that runs it, a fellow named Dago George, runs the gang,
  too&mdash;and he&rsquo;s <i>some</i> guy. But what&rsquo;s that got to do
  with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; said Bookie Skarvan tersely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,
  she is, eh?&rdquo; There was a new and sudden interest in the Scorpion&rsquo;s
  voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She went there from the train with her grips.&rdquo; Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s
  cigar grew restive in his mouth. &ldquo;Well, me, too, I&rsquo;m for the same
  joint, only I don&rsquo;t want
  to take any chances of spilling the beans.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;re afraid she&rsquo;ll pipe you off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bookie Skarvan. &ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t afraid of
  that. She never got a peep at me on the train, and she only saw me once before
  in her life, and that time, besides it being dark and me being outside on
  the front doorstep, she was so scared I might have been a lamppost, for all
  she&rsquo;d know me again. It was the night her old man croaked&mdash;see?
  No, I ain&rsquo;t afraid of her&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t afford to take
  any chances by blowing in there right after her. I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of
  her, but I had my fingers crossed on whoever ran the place, and I guess,
  after what you&rsquo;ve said, that my hunch was right. It was a queer place
  for her to go right off the bat the minute she landed in New York, and she
  didn&rsquo;t go there instead of to a decent hotel just by luck&mdash;get
  me? I figured she might stand in there pretty thick&mdash;and if she did,
  and I blew in right on top of her, the betting odds were about one million
  dollars to a peanut that I&rsquo;d be a sucker. I&rsquo;m sure of it now
  that you say the fellow who runs it is a Dago in the same old line of business
  that her father was in. What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Scorpion&rsquo;s pale blue eyes scrutinized Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s face&mdash;and
  lighted with a curious benignity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You and Baldy make a pretty good combination, I guess!&rdquo; he
  observed with dry admiration.</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan indulged in his wheezy chuckle. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a
  little luck together once in a while,&rdquo; he admitted modestly. &ldquo;Well,
  you get me, don&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;ve got to get into that Iron Tavern
  joint just the same. That&rsquo;s the first card we play. I figured that
  mabbe this Dago George would know you by reputation anyhow, and that you
  could fix it for me without it looking as though it were anything more than
  a friend of yours, say, who&rsquo;d got into a little temporary difficulty
  with the police down in Baltimore, say, and was keeping quiet and retired
  for a few days till the worst of it blew over&mdash;and that you&rsquo;d
  picked out his joint as the best bet for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Scorpion got up from his seat abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said cordially, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I met you! That
  listens good! Sure! I guess I can fix that! Dago George and me ain&rsquo;t
  exactly pals, and we don&rsquo;t love each other any more than you&rsquo;d
  notice&mdash;but he knows where he gets off with Cunny Smeeks! You wait a
  minute, and I&rsquo;ll get him on the phone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cunny Smeeks, alias the Scorpion, of the &eacute;lite of the New York underworld,
  left the room. Bookie Skarvan sprawled negligently back on the couch. He
  smiled softly&mdash;and chewed contentedly on his cigar. Things were working
  well.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like credit in this wicked world,&rdquo; Bookie
  Skarvan confided sapiently to himself. &ldquo;I may have to run up quite
  a bill with Mr. Cunny Smeeks before I&rsquo;m through, mabbe quite a fat
  little bill&mdash;but he can always send it to Baldy&mdash;if I&rsquo;m not
  here! What? It&rsquo;s beginning to look good again. Five years I&rsquo;ve
  been trying to get the grappling hook on that coin. It looks pretty good
  now, and I guess I can see it coming&mdash;and I guess I won&rsquo;t have
  to wait as long as Baldy will!&rdquo; He wagged his head pleasantly. &ldquo;I
  never was fond of San Francisco&mdash;and I always wanted to travel! Perhaps
  Baldy and Mr. Cunny Smeeks won&rsquo;t be such good friends by-and-by. I
  dunno! I only know that Bookie Skarvan won&rsquo;t be sticking around to
  see them go into mourning for their share of that hundred thousand that they
  think they&rsquo;re going to get&mdash;not so&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d observe
  it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s eyes swept the den indifferently and without interest.
  They fastened finally on the toe of his own boot. The minutes passed, and
  as they passed a scowl came gradually to Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s face, and
  a fat hand in a sudden nervous gesture went to his forehead and brushed across
  his eyes. His thoughts seemed to have veered into a less pleasant channel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;you can take it from me that I ain&rsquo;t
  sorry Dave Henderson&rsquo;s dead&mdash;not very! He never saw all my cards,
  and that&rsquo;s the one hold Baldy had on me.&rdquo; The room was apparently
  over-heated&mdash;for a fat man. A bead of sweat came out on Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s
  forehead. He swore savagely. &ldquo;You damn fool, can&rsquo;t you forget
  it! You&rsquo;re not afraid of a dead man now, are you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Scorpion came back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he said, from the doorway. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fixed!
  He put up a howl and wouldn&rsquo;t stand for it at first, and he kicked
  so hard that I guess he&rsquo;s in with the girl all right. He said he had
  no place to put anybody; but he came across all right&mdash;with a twist
  of the screws. You&rsquo;re a friend of mine, and your Baltimore spiel goes&mdash;see?&rdquo; The
  pale blue eyes darkened suddenly. &ldquo;You get what I&rsquo;ve done, don&rsquo;t
  you? Dago George don&rsquo;t forgive easily, and if this thing busts open
  and Dago George tumbles to what I&rsquo;ve handed him, I&rsquo;m mabbe going
  to have a little gang war on my hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I get you!&rdquo; said Bookie Skarvan earnestly, as he joined the
  other in the doorway. &ldquo;And that goes into the bill at a hundred cents
  on the dollar&mdash;and you know Baldy well enough to know what that means.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The
    Scorpion laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it&rsquo;s nothing to worry about! As I told you, I&rsquo;ve
  never been very fond of Dago anyhow, and I guess I can take care of anything
  he wants to start. There&rsquo;d be only one of us in at the finish&mdash;and
  it wouldn&rsquo;t be Dago George! You can go the limit, and you&rsquo;ll
  find you&rsquo;ve got the biggest backing&mdash;on any count&mdash;in little
  old New York! Well, come on over, and I&rsquo;ll introduce you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure! That&rsquo;s the stuff!&rdquo; said Bookie Skarvan, as he accompanied
  the other to the street. &ldquo;Baldy said you were the real goods&mdash;and
  I guess I got to hand it to Baldy!&rdquo; He chuckled suddenly and wheezingly,
  as they went down the block. &ldquo;The Baltimore crook&mdash;eh? Me and
  Dago George! Leave it to me! I guess I can handle Dago George!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And twenty minutes later, in a room on the third floor of The Iron Tavern,
  Bookie Skarvan, &ldquo;handling&rdquo; Dago George, laid a detaining hand
  on the proprietor&rsquo;s arm, as the latter was bidding him good-night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; whispered Bookie Skarvan. &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re
  on the level because Cunny Smeeks says so; but I got to lay low, damned low&mdash;savvy?
  I ain&rsquo;t for meeting people&mdash;not even for passing &rsquo;em out
  in the hall there. So how about it? Have I got neighbors? I ain&rsquo;t taking
  any chances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dago George laid his forefinger along his nose&mdash;and smiled reassuringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand&mdash;eh?
  But you need have no fear. I do not take guests, except&rdquo;&mdash;he shrugged
  his shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;except&mdash;you understand, eh?&mdash;to oblige
  a friend like Cunny Smeeks. Otherwise&rdquo;&mdash;again the shoulders lifted&mdash;&ldquo;I
  would not have the so-great honor of offering you a room. Is it not so? Well,
  then, there is no one here, except&rdquo;&mdash;he jerked his thumb toward
  the opposite door across the hall&mdash;&ldquo;my niece, who will not trouble
  you; and in the next room to hers a friend of mine, who will not trouble
  you either. There is no one else. You need have no fear. I assure you, you
  need have no fear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, then,&rdquo; he said in a cordial and relieved
  tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only that I got to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shook hands with Dago George, as the latter again bade him good-night.
  He closed his door, and sat down. The bulge of the protruding cigar butt
  metamorphosed what was intended for an amiable smile into an unlovely grimace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Niece&mdash;eh?&rdquo; murmured Bookie Skarvan to himself. &ldquo;Well,
  well&mdash;and in the room across the hall! I guess I won&rsquo;t go to bed
  just yet, not just yet&mdash;but I guess I&rsquo;ll put out the light.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  The Room On The Third Floor</b></h2>
  <p>IT was pitch black. Dave Henderson opened his eyes drowsily. He lay for
  a moment puzzled and bewildered as to where he was. And then consciousness
  returned in fuller measure, and he remembered that he had thrown himself
  down on the bed fully dressed&mdash;and must have fallen asleep.</p>
  <p>He stirred now uneasily. He was most uncomfortable. Something brutally hard
  and unyielding seemed to be prodding and boring into his side. He felt down
  under him with his hand&mdash;and smiled quizzically. It was his revolver.
  He would probably, otherwise, have slept straight through the night. The
  revolver, as he had turned over in his sleep undoubtedly, had twisted in
  his pocket, and had resolved itself into a sort of skewer, muzzle end up,
  that dug ungraciously and painfully into his ribs.</p>
  <p>He straightened the revolver in his pocket&mdash;and the touch of the weapon
  seemed to clear his faculties and fling him with a sudden jolt from the borderland
  of sleepy, mental indolence into a whirl of mental activity. He remembered
  Millman. Millman and the revolver were indissolubly associated. Only Millman
  had returned the money. That was the strangest part of it. Millman had returned
  the money. It was over there now on the floor in the dress-suit case. He
  remembered his scene with Millman. He remembered that he had deliberately
  fanned his passion into a white heat. He should therefore be in an unbridled
  rage with Millman now&mdash;only he wasn&rsquo;t. Nor would that anger seemingly
  return&mdash;even at his bidding. Instead, there seemed to be a cold, deliberate,
  reasoned self-condemnation creeping upon him. It was not pleasant. He tried
  to fight it off. It persisted. He was conscious of a slight headache. He
  stirred uneasily again upon the bed. Facts, however he might wish to avoid
  them, were cold-blooded, stubborn things. They began to assert themselves
  here in the quiet and the darkness.</p>
  <p>Where was that sporting instinct of fair play of his of which he was so
  proud! Millman had <i>not</i> gone to that pigeon-cote with any treacherous
  motive. Millman had <i>not</i> played the traitor, either for his own ends
  or at the instigation of the police. Millman, in blunt language, knowingly
  accepting the risk of being caught, when, already known as a prison bird,
  no possible explanation could avail him if he were found with the money in
  his possession, had gone in order to save a friend&mdash;and that friend
  was Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson shook his head. No&mdash;he would not accept that&mdash;not
  so meekly as all that! Millman hadn&rsquo;t saved him from anything. He could
  have got the money himself all right when he got out, and the police would
  have been none the wiser.</p>
  <p>He clenched his hands. A voice within him suddenly called him&mdash;<i>coward!</i> In
  that day in the prison library when he had felt himself cornered, he had
  been desperately eager enough for help. It was true, that as things had turned
  out, he could have gone safely to the pigeon-cote himself, as he actually
  had done, but he had not foreseen the craft of Nicolo Capriano then, and
  his back had been to the wall then, and the odds had seemingly piled to an
  insurmountable height against him&mdash;and Millman, shifting the danger
  and the risk to his own shoulders, had stepped into the breach. Millman had
  done that. There was no gainsaying it. Well, he admitted it, didn&rsquo;t
  he? He had no quarrel with Millman on that score now, had he? He scowled
  savagely in the darkness. It was Millman with his infernal, quixotic and
  overweening honesty that was the matter. That was what it was! His quarrel
  with Millman lay in the fact that Millman was&mdash;<i>an honest man</i>.</p>
  <p>He sat bolt upright on the bed, his hands clenched suddenly again. Why hadn&rsquo;t
  Millman kept his honesty where it belonged! If Millman felt the way he did
  after going to the pigeon-cote and getting that money, why hadn&rsquo;t Millman
  stuck to his guns the way any ordinary man would, instead of laying down
  like a lamb&mdash;why hadn&rsquo;t he fought it out man to man, until the
  better man won&mdash;and that money went back, or it didn&rsquo;t! Fight!
  That was it&mdash;fight! If Millman had only fought it out&mdash;like an
  ordinary man&mdash;and&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be <i>honest</i>&mdash;at least with yourself!&rdquo; whispered that
  inner voice quietly. &ldquo;Millman was just as honest with you as he was
  with his own soul. He kept faith with you in the only way he could&mdash;and
  still keep faith with himself. Did he throw you down&mdash;Dave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment Dave Henderson did not stir; he seemed mentally and physically
  in a strange and singular state of suspended animation. And then a queer
  and twisted smile flickered across his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s white!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;By God, the whitest
  man on earth&mdash;that&rsquo;s Millman! Only&mdash;damn him! Damn him, for
  the hole he&rsquo;s put me in!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yes, that was it! He had it at last, and exactly now! Over there on the
  floor in the dress-suit case was the money; but it wasn&rsquo;t the money
  that he, Dave Henderson, had taken a gambler&rsquo;s risk and a sporting
  chance to get, it wasn&rsquo;t the money he had fought like a wildcat for&mdash;it
  was Millman&rsquo;s money. It wasn&rsquo;t the money he had staked his all
  to win&mdash;he staked nothing here. It was another man&rsquo;s stake. Over
  there was the money, and he was free to use it&mdash;if he chose to take
  it as the price of another man&rsquo;s loyalty, the price that another man
  paid for having taken upon himself the risk of prison bars and stone walls
  again because that other man believed his <i>risk</i> was substituted for
  the <i>certainty</i> that Dave Henderson would otherwise incur that fate!</p>
  <p>The inner voice came quietly again&mdash;but it held a bitter gibe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter? Are you in doubt about anything? Why don&rsquo;t
  you get up, and undress, and go to bed, and sleep quietly? You&rsquo;ve got
  the money now, you&rsquo;re fixed for all your life, and nothing to worry
  you&mdash;Millman pays the bills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five years!&rdquo; Dave Henderson muttered. &ldquo;Five years of
  hell&mdash;for nothing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His face hardened. That was Nicolo Capriano lying over there on his bed,
  wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;and plucking with thin, blue-tipped fingers at the
  coverlet&mdash;and eyeing him with those black eyes that glittered virulently&mdash;and
  twisting bloodless lips into a sardonic and contemptuous sneer. And why was
  that barbed tongue of Nicolo Capriano pouring out such a furious and vicious
  flood of vituperation?</p>
  <p>Another vision came&mdash;an oval face of great beauty, but whose expression
  was inscrutable; whose dark eyes met his in a long and steady gaze; and from
  a full, white, ivory throat, mounting upward until it touched the wealth
  of hair that crowned the forehead, a tinge of color brought a more radiant
  life. What would Teresa say?</p>
  <p>His hands swept again and again, nervously, fiercely, across his eyes. In
  the years of his vaunted boast that neither hell nor the devil would hold
  him back, he had not dreamed of this. A thief! Yes, he had been a thief&mdash;but
  he had never been a piker! He wasn&rsquo;t a vulture, was he, to feed and
  gorge on a friend&rsquo;s loyalty!</p>
  <p>He snarled suddenly. Honesty! What was honesty? Millman was trying to hold
  himself up as an example to be followed&mdash;eh? Well, that was Millman&rsquo;s
  privilege, wasn&rsquo;t it? And, after all, how honest was Millman? Was there
  anybody who was intrinsically honest? If there were, it might be different&mdash;it
  might be worth while then to be honest. But Millman could afford that hundred
  thousand, Millman had said so himself; it didn&rsquo;t mean anything to Millman.
  If, for instance, it took the last penny Millman had to make good that money
  there might be something in honesty to talk about&mdash;but that sort of
  honesty didn&rsquo;t exist, either in Millman, or in any other human being.
  He, Dave Henderson, had yet to see any one who would sacrifice all and everything
  in an absolutely literal way upon the altar of honesty as a principle. Every
  one had his price. His, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s, price had been one hundred
  thousand dollars; he, Dave Henderson, wouldn&rsquo;t steal, say, a hundred
  dollars&mdash;and a hundred dollars was probably an even greater matter to
  him than a hundred thousand was to Millman, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>He brought his mental soliloquy roughly to an end, with a low, half angry,
  half perturbed exclamation. What had brought him to weigh the pros and cons
  of honesty, anyway! He had never been disturbed on that score in those five
  years behind prison bars! Why now? It wasn&rsquo;t that that concerned him,
  that held him now in the throes of a bitter mental conflict, that dismayed
  him, that tormented him, that mocked at the hell of torture he would&mdash;if
  he yielded&mdash;have endured in vain, that grinned at him out of the darkness
  sardonically, and awaited with biting irony his decision. It didn&rsquo;t
  matter what degree of honesty Millman possessed; it was Millman&rsquo;s act,
  in its most material and tangible sense, that threatened now to crush him.</p>
  <p>Both hands, like gnarled knobs, went above his head. He was a thief; but,
  by God, he was a man! If he kept that money there, he became a puling, whining
  beggar, sneaking and crawling his way through life on&mdash;<i>charity!</i> Charity!
  Oh, yes, he might find a softer name for it; but, by any name, he would none
  the less feed to the day he died, like a parasite and a damned puny, pitiful
  whelp and cur, on another man&rsquo;s&mdash;charity!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give it back&mdash;no!&rdquo; he whispered fiercely through set lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  paid too much&mdash;it&rsquo;s mine&mdash;I&rsquo;ve paid for it with the
  sweat of hell! It&rsquo;s mine! I will not give it back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; whispered that inner voice. &ldquo;It begins
  to look as though there were something in life, say, an <i>honest</i> pride,
  that was worth more than money&mdash;even to you, Dave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sprang restively from the bed to the floor, and groped his way across
  the room to the light. He was in for a night of it&mdash;subconsciously he
  realized that, subconsciously he realized that he would not sleep, but subconsciously
  he was prompted to get his clothes off and obtain, lacking mental ease, what
  physical comfort he could.</p>
  <p>He turned on the light, and the act diverted his thoughts momentarily. He
  did not seem to remember that he had ever turned off that light&mdash;but
  rather, in fact, that the light had been on when Dago George had left the
  room, and he, Dave Henderson, had flung himself down on the bed. It was rather
  strange! His eyes circled the room curiously, narrowed suddenly as they fell
  upon the dress-suit case, and upon one of the catches that appeared to have
  become unfastened&mdash;and with a bound he reached the dress-suit case,
  and flung up the lid.</p>
  <p>The money was gone.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  Half An Ally</b></h2>
  <p>MOTIONLESS, save that his lips twitched queerly, Dave Henderson stood erect,
  and stared down into the pillaged dress-suit case. And then his hands clenched
  slowly&mdash;tightened&mdash;and grew white across the knuckles.</p>
  <p>The money was gone! The agony of those days and nights, when, wounded, he
  had fled from the police, the five years of prison torment which he had endured,
  seemed to pass with lightning swiftness in review before him&mdash;and to
  mock him, and to become a ghastly travesty. The money was gone!</p>
  <p>The pillaged dress-suit case seemed to leer and mock at him, too. He might
  have saved himself that little debate, which he had not settled, and which
  was based upon a certain element of ethics that involved the suggestion of
  charity. It was settled for him now. He <i>owed</i> Millman now one hundred
  thousand dollars, only the choice as to whether he would pay it or not was
  no longer his, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Damn it! <i>The money was gone!</i> Could he not grasp that one, single,
  concrete, vital fact, and act upon it, without standing here, with his brain,
  like some hapless yokel&rsquo;s, agog and maundering? The money was gone!
  Gone! Where? When? How? He could only have been asleep for a short time,
  surely. He wrenched his watch suddenly from his pocket. Three o&rsquo;clock!
  It was three o&rsquo;clock in the morning! Five hours! He had been asleep
  five hours, then! He must have slept very soundly that any one could have
  entered the room without arousing him!</p>
  <p>His lips hardened. He was alert enough now, both mentally and physically.
  He stepped over to the door. It was still locked. His eyes swept around the
  room. The window, then! What about the window?</p>
  <p>He felt suddenly for his money-belt beneath his underclothing, as he started
  across the room. The belt was there. That, at least, was safe. A twisted
  smile came to his lips. Naturally! His brain was exhibiting some glimmer
  of sense and cohesion now! It was evident enough that no one, since no one
  knew anything about it, had been specifically after that package of banknotes.
  It could only have been the work of a sneak thief&mdash;who had probably
  stumbled upon the greatest stroke of luck in his whole abandoned career.
  It was undoubtedly a quarter of the city wherein sneak thieves were bred!
  The man would obviously not have been fool enough, with a fortune already
  in his possession, to have risked the frisking of his, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s,
  sleeping person! Was the man, then, an inmate of The Iron Tavern, say, that
  greasy waiter, for instance; or had he gained entrance from outside; or,
  since the theft might have taken place hours ago, was it a predatory hanger-on
  at the bar who had sneaked his way upstairs, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>The window, too, was locked! It was queer! Both window and door locked!
  How had the man got in&mdash;and got out again?</p>
  <p>Mechanically, he unlocked and raised the window&mdash;and with a quick jerk
  of his body forward leaned out excitedly. Was this the answer&mdash;this
  platform of a fire escape that ran between his window and the next? But his
  window had been <i>locked!</i></p>
  <p>He stood there hesitant. Should he arouse Dago George? He could depend upon
  and trust Dago George, thanks to Nicolo Capriano; but to go to Dago George
  meant that confidences must be led up to which he desired to give to no man.
  His brain seemed suddenly to become frantic. The money was gone&mdash;his,
  or Millman&rsquo;s, or the devil&rsquo;s, it didn&rsquo;t matter which now&mdash;the
  money was gone, swallowed up in the black of that night out there, without
  a clue that offered him a suggestion even on which to act. But he couldn&rsquo;t
  stand here inactive like a fool, could he? Nor&mdash;his brain jeered at
  him now&mdash;could he go out and prowl around the city streets, and ask
  each passer-by if he or she had seen a package of banknotes whose sum was
  one hundred thousand dollars! What else was there, then, to do, except to
  arouse Dago George? Dago George, from what Nicolo Capriano had said, would
  have many strings to pull&mdash;underground strings. That was it&mdash;<i>underground
  strings!</i> It wasn&rsquo;t a <i>police</i> job!</p>
  <p>He turned from the window, took a step back across the room, and halted
  again abruptly. <i>What was that?</i> It came again&mdash;a faint, low, rustling
  sound, and it seemed to come from the direction of the fire escape.</p>
  <p>In an instant he was back at the window, but this time he crouched down
  at the sill. A second passed while he listened, and from the edge of the
  sash strained his eyes out into the darkness, and then his hand crept into
  his side pocket and came out with his revolver. Some one, a dark form, blacker
  than the night shadows out there, was crawling from the next window to the
  fire escape.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips thinned. Just a second more until that &ldquo;some
  one&rdquo; was half-way out and half-way in, and at a disadvantage and&mdash;<i>now!</i></p>
  <p>With a spring, lithe and quick as a cat, Dave Henderson was through the
  window, and the dark form was wriggling and squirming in his grasp, and a
  low cry came&mdash;and Dave Henderson swore sharply under his breath.</p>
  <p>It was a woman! A woman! Well, that didn&rsquo;t matter! One hundred thousand
  dollars was gone from his dress-suit case, and this woman was crawling to
  the fire escape from the next room at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning&mdash;that
  was what mattered!</p>
  <p>They were on the iron platform now, and he pushed her none too gently along
  it toward the window of his own room&mdash;into the light. And then his hands
  dropped from her as though suddenly bereft of power, and as suddenly lifted
  again, and, almost fierce in their intensity, gripped at her shoulders, and
  forced her face more fully into the light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Teresa!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;You&mdash;Teresa!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was trying to smile, but it was a tremulous effort. The great, dark
  eyes, out of a face that was ivory white, lifted to his, and faltered, and
  dropped again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Teresa&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; His voice, his
  face, his eyes, were full of incredulous wonder.</p>
  <p>Her lips were still quivering in their smile. She nodded her head in a sort
  of quaint, wistful way.</p>
  <p>The blood was pounding and surging in his veins. Teresa! Teresa was here,
  standing here before him! Not that phantom picture that had come to him so
  often in the days and nights since he had left San Francisco&mdash;the glorious
  eyes, half veiled by the long lashes, though they would not look at him,
  were real; this touch of his hands upon her shoulders, this touch that thrilled
  him, was real, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Slowly his hands fell away from her; and as though to kill and stifle joy,
  and mock at gladness, and make sorry sport of ecstasy, there came creeping
  upon him doubt, black, ugly, and bitter as gall.</p>
  <p>Yes, it was Teresa! And at sight of her there had come suddenly and fully,
  irrefutably, the knowledge that he cared for her; that love, which comes
  at no man&rsquo;s bidding, had come to him for her. Yes, it was Teresa! But
  what was she doing here? In view of that money, gone in the last few hours
  from his dress-suit case, what <i>could</i> Teresa Capriano be doing here
  in the next room to his?</p>
  <p>He laughed a little, low, sharply&mdash;and turned his head away. Love!
  How could he love&mdash;and doubt! How could he love&mdash;and condemn the
  one he loved unheard! He looked at her again now; and the blood in his veins,
  as though over-riding now some obstacle that had dammed its flow, grew swifter,
  and his pulse quickened. How could he doubt&mdash;Teresa!</p>
  <p>But it was Teresa who spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are standing here in the light, and we can be seen from everywhere
  around,&rdquo; she said in a low tone. &ldquo;You&mdash;there is danger.
  Turn the light off in your room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said mechanically, and stepping back into his room,
  turned off the light. He was beside her again the next instant. Danger! His
  mind was mulling over that. What danger? Why had she said that? What was
  its significance in respect of her presence here? The questions came crowding
  to his lips. &ldquo;Danger? What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked tensely. &ldquo;And
  how did you get here, Teresa? And why? Was it your father who sent you? There
  is something that has gone wrong? The police&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father died the night you went away,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>He drew back, startled. Nicolo Capriano&mdash;dead!</p>
  <p>Her father&mdash;dead! He could not seem somehow to visualize Nicolo Capriano
  as one dead. The man&rsquo;s mentality had so seemed to triumph over his
  physical ills, that, sick though he had been, Nicolo Capriano had seemed
  to personify and embody vitality and life itself. Dead! He drew in his breath
  sharply. Then she was alone, this little figure standing here in the darkness
  beside him, high up here in the world of night, with a void beneath and around
  them, strangely, curiously cut off, even in a physical sense, from any other
  human touch or sympathy&mdash;but his.</p>
  <p>He reached out and found her hand, and laid it between both his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m no good at words,&rdquo; he fumbled. &ldquo;They&mdash;they
  won&rsquo;t come. But he was the best friend I ever, had in life, too. And
  so I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that! Don&rsquo;t! You mustn&rsquo;t! Do you hear,
  you mustn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Her hand, that lay in his, was suddenly clenched,
  and she was striving to draw it away. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t true! I&mdash;that
  is why I came&mdash;I came to tell you. He was not your friend. He&mdash;he
  betrayed you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held her hand tighter&mdash;in a grip that made her efforts to escape
  pitifully impotent. And, almost fiercely, he drew her closer, trying to read
  her face in the darkness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He betrayed me! Nicolo Capriano <i>betrayed</i> me!&rdquo; His mind
  was suddenly a riot. Incredulity and amazement mingled with a sickening fear
  that her words were literally true&mdash;the money was gone! And yet&mdash;and
  yet&mdash;Nicolo Capriano&mdash;a traitor! His words rasped now. &ldquo;Do
  you know what you are saying, Teresa? Quick! Answer me! Do you know what
  you are saying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know only too well.&rdquo; Her voice had broken a little now. &ldquo;I
  know that the money was taken from your room to-night. Please let my hand
  go. I&mdash;you will hate me in a moment&mdash;for&mdash;for, after all,
  I am his daughter. Will you please let me go, and I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mechanically he released her.</p>
  <p>She turned half away from him, and leaned on the iron hand-rail of the platform,
  staring down into the blackness beneath her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dago George took it&mdash;an hour ago,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dago George!&rdquo; Dave Henderson straightened. &ldquo;Ah, so it
  was Dago George, was it!&rdquo; He laughed with sudden menace, and turned
  impulsively toward the window of his room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she said, and laid a hand detainingly upon his sleeve. &ldquo;The
  money, I am sure, is safe where it is until daylight, anyway. I&mdash;I have
  more to tell you. It&mdash;it is not easy to tell. I&mdash;I am his daughter.
  Dago George was one of my father&rsquo;s accomplices in the old days in San
  Francisco. That letter which I wrote for my father meant nothing that it
  said, it contained a secret code that made you a marked man from the moment
  you delivered it here, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You, too!&rdquo; There was bitter hurt in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s
  voice. And then suddenly he threw his shoulders back. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  believe you!&rdquo; he flung out fiercely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
  how you got here, or what you are doing here, but you <i>wrote</i> that letter&mdash;and
  I don&rsquo;t believe it was a trap. Do you understand, Teresa&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
  believe you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She raised her head&mdash;and it seemed that even in the darkness he caught
  the sudden film of tears in her eyes, and saw the lips part in a quivering
  smile. She shook her head slowly then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was not what I wrote,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was what my&mdash;what
  he added afterwards when he signed it. <i>Con amore</i>&mdash;that was the
  secret code, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you did not know that, then&mdash;Teresa!&rdquo; There was a
  strange, triumphant uplift in his voice. &ldquo;I remember! It was while
  you were out of the room. Did I not say I did not believe you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her lips were still quivering, but the smile was gone. &ldquo;No, I did
  not know then,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But his shame is my shame, nothing
  can alter that&mdash;I am his daughter. I did not know it until after you
  had gone&mdash;and then&mdash;my father had a&mdash;a sudden attack&mdash;and
  that night he died. I&mdash;there was only one thing that I could do. I had
  no way of warning you except to try and get here before you did, or at least
  to get here before Dago George had gone too far. There&mdash;there were things
  I had to do in San Francisco&mdash;and then I came as quickly as I could.
  I got here to-night. I found that you were already here&mdash;just a little
  ahead of me, and that you had given Dago George the letter. I had only one
  chance then&mdash;to make Dago George believe that I had come, since my father
  was dead, to carry on the plot against you where my father had left off.
  Dago George had no suspicions. He knew me.&rdquo; Her voice held a sudden
  merciless note. &ldquo;I was a Capriano. He told me that you were upstairs
  here, drugged, and he gave me the room next to yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drugged!&rdquo; Dave Henderson passed his hand across his eyes. That
  accounted for a great deal! He remembered the slight headache with which
  he had awakened; he was suddenly conscious of it now. &ldquo;Drugged!&rdquo; he
  repeated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a way,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was too late. But Dago George,
  of course, did not know any details, and he had not gone any further than
  that. He had just left you in your room when I came. He had not, of course,
  heard from my father, since my father was dead, and he drugged you so that,
  during the night, he could have free access to your room and your belongings
  and find out what he could about you. I&mdash;I thought to turn him from
  that purpose by telling him enough of the truth to make him content to wait
  patiently and watch your movements until you had the money in your possession.
  Do&mdash;do you understand? He said the effects of the drug would wear off
  in a few hours, and I meant to warn you then, and&mdash;and we would both
  make our escape from here. I&mdash;that is why I told you there was danger.
  Dago George would stop at nothing. He has a band of men here in New York
  that I know are as unscrupulous as he is; and this place here, I am only
  too sure, has been the trap for more than one of his victims.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She paused. Her voice, though guarded, had grown excited, and a little breathless.</p>
  <p>It was a moment before Dave Henderson spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo; His voice was hoarse. &ldquo;If Dago George had found
  you out you wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance for your life! And you knew
  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;I knew that. But that has no
  place here. There was no other way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you did this for me?&rdquo; His hands reached out, and fell upon
  the girl&rsquo;s slight shoulders, and tightened there. &ldquo;You did this
  for me&mdash;Teresa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did it because there was no other thing to do, because&mdash;because&rdquo;&mdash;her
  voice lost its steadiness&mdash;&ldquo;it was my father&rsquo;s guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He drew her closer, with a strange, gentle, remorseless strength.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And for no other reason&mdash;Teresa?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;For
  only that? If it had not been your father? If he had had nothing to do with
  it? If it had been only me?&rdquo; Her face was very close to his now, so
  close that the quick, sudden panting of her breath was upon his cheek, so
  close that her lips were almost warm upon his own.</p>
  <p>She put out her hands, and pressed them with a curious gentleness against
  his face to ward him off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Her voice was very low. &ldquo;Have you forgotten
  that I am the daughter of the man who meant&mdash;who meant perhaps to take
  your life; that I am the daughter of a criminal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rdquo;&mdash;he had her wrists now, and was holding the soft,
  trembling hands against his cheeks&mdash;&ldquo;I am a thief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She was almost crying now. &ldquo;You&mdash;you
  don&rsquo;t understand. There is more. I meant, if I could, to take that
  money from you myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In sheer astonishment he let her go, and drew back a step. She seemed to
  waver unsteadily on her feet there in the darkness for an instant, and her
  hand groped out to the platform railing for support; and then suddenly she
  stood erect, her face full toward him, her head thrown back a little on her
  shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I meant to get it, if I could&mdash;to give it back to those to whom
  it belongs. And I still mean to.&rdquo; Her voice was quiet now, quivering
  a little, but bravely under control, &ldquo;All my life has been a lie. I
  lived a lie the night I let you go away without a word of protest about what
  you were going to do. I do not mean to throw the blame upon my father, but
  with his death all those old ties were broken. Will you try to understand
  me? I must either now go on in the old way, or go straight with my conscience
  and with God. I could not bargain with God or my conscience. It was all or
  nothing. I had a share in enabling you to hoodwink the police. Therefore
  if you came into possession of that money again, I was as much a thief as
  you were, and as guilty. But I owed it to you, above all other things, to
  warn you of your danger; and so I came here&mdash;to warn you first&mdash;and
  afterwards, when you were safe from Dago George&rsquo;s reach, to watch you,
  and get the money myself if I could. Do you understand?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I came here to-night, I did not think that you had yet got the
  money; but something that Dago George said made me think that perhaps you
  had, and that perhaps he thought so, too. And so I sat there in my room in
  the darkness waiting until all was quiet in the house, and I could steal
  into your room and search, if I could get in through either door or window;
  and then, whether I got in or not, or whether the search was successful or
  not, I meant to wait until the drug had worn itself off sufficiently to enable
  me to arouse you, and tell you to get away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then, I do not know what time it was, I heard some one steal
  up the stairs and go to the door of your room, and work at the lock very,
  very quietly, and go into your room, and move around in there. I was listening
  then with my ear to the partition, and I could just make out the sounds,
  no more. I should never have heard anything had I been asleep; there was
  never enough noise to have awakened me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The footsteps went downstairs, then, and I opened my door and waited
  until I heard them, louder, as though caution were no longer necessary, on
  the second landing; and then I stole downstairs myself. There was a light
  in Dago George&rsquo;s room. It came through the fanlight. The door was closed.
  But by leaning over the banister of the lower flight of stairs, I could see
  into the far end of the room through the fanlight. He had a package in his
  hand. It was torn at one corner, and from this he pulled out what I could
  see were a number of yellow-back banknotes. He looked at these for a moment,
  then replaced them in the package, and went to his safe. He knelt down in
  front of it, laid the package on the floor beside him, and began to open
  the safe. I heard some one moving above then, and I tiptoed back, and hid
  in what seemed to be a small private dining room on the second floor. I heard
  some one go quietly down the stairs, and then I came back here to my room
  to wait until I could arouse you. The money was in Dago George&rsquo;s safe.
  It would be there until morning at least, and on that account it no longer
  concerned me for the moment. And then after a long time I heard you move
  in your room. It was safer to come this way than to go out into the hall,
  for I did not know what Dago George might intend to do with you, or with
  me either, now that he had the money. He would not hesitate to get rid of
  us both if his cunning prompted him to believe that was his safest course.
  And I was afraid of that. Only you and I, besides himself, knew anything
  about that money&mdash;and he had got it into his possession. Do you understand?
  When I heard you move, I started through the window to go to you, and&mdash;and
  you saw me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson had sunk his elbows on the iron railing, his chin resting
  in his hands, and was staring at the strange, fluted sky-line where the buildings
  jabbed their queer, uneven points up into the night. It was a long time before
  he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of queer, Teresa,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  kind of queer. You&rsquo;re something like a friend of&mdash;like a man I
  know. It&rsquo;s kind of queer. Well, you&rsquo;ve given me my chance, you&rsquo;ve
  risked your life to give me my chance, you&rsquo;ve played as square as any
  woman God ever made&mdash;and now what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She drew in her breath sharply, audibly, as though startled, as though his
  words were foreign, startlingly foreign to anything she had expected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;have I any choice?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I know where
  the money is, and I must notify the authorities. I must tell the police so
  that they can get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s eyes, a curious smile in them that the darkness hid,
  shifted from the sky-line to the little dark figure before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do you think I will let you tell the police where that money
  is?&rdquo; He laughed quietly. &ldquo;Do you? Did you think you could come
  and tell me just where it was, and then calmly leave me, and walk into the
  police station with the news&mdash;and get away with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s
  inconsistency. It isn&rsquo;t! I didn&rsquo;t know what you would do, I don&rsquo;t
  know now. But I have told you all. I have told you what I intend to do, if
  I possibly can. I had to tell you first. If I was to be honest all the way
  with myself, I had first of all to be honest with you. After that I was free.
  I don&rsquo;t know what you will do. I don&rsquo;t see what you can do now.
  But if you keep me from notifying the police to-night&mdash;there is to-morrow&mdash;and
  after that another to-morrow. No matter what happens, to you, or to me, I
  am going through with this. I&rdquo;&mdash;her voice choked suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;I
  have to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson straightened up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe you!&rdquo; he said under his breath. &ldquo;After what
  you&rsquo;ve done, I&rsquo;d be a fool if I didn&rsquo;t. And you&rsquo;re
  offering me a square fight, aren&rsquo;t you, Teresa?&rdquo; He was laughing
  in that quiet, curious way again. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not sure I want
  to fight. Just before I found out that money was gone, I was wondering if
  I wouldn&rsquo;t give it back myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Dave!</i>&rdquo; It was the first time she had ever called him
  by his name, and it came now from her lips in a quick, glad cry. Her hands
  caught at both his arms. &ldquo;Dave, do you mean that? Do you? Dave, it <i>is</i> true!
  You&rsquo;re honest, after all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned his head away, a sudden hard and bitter smile on his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind yet
  about giving it back, anyway. But maybe I had other reasons for even getting
  as far as I did. Not honesty. I can&rsquo;t kid, myself on that. I am a thief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her fingers were gripping at his arms with all their strength, as though
  she were afraid that somehow he would elude and escape her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You <i>were</i> a thief&rdquo;&mdash;it seemed as though her soul
  were in the passionate entreaty in her voice now&mdash;&ldquo;and I was the
  daughter of a criminal, with all the hideous memories of crime and evil that
  stretch back to childhood. But that is in the past, Dave, if we will only
  leave it there, isn&rsquo;t it? It&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that
  way in all the years that are coming. God gives us both a chance to&mdash;to
  make good. I&rsquo;m going to take mine. Won&rsquo;t you take yours, Dave?
  You were a thief, but how about from now on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stood rigid, motionless; and again his face was turned away from her
  out into the darkness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From now on.&rdquo; He repeated the words in a low, wondering way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she cried eagerly. &ldquo;From now on, Dave. Let us get
  away from here, and go and notify the police that Dago George has that money,
  and&mdash;and&mdash;and then, you see, the police will come and get it, and
  return it where it belongs, and that will end it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a moment before he turned toward her again, and then his face was
  white, and drawn, and haggard. He shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;There are
  more reasons than one why I can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; Her hands were clasping
  his arms. He forced them gently from their hold now, and took them in his
  own, and drew her closer to him, and held her there. &ldquo;And one of those
  reasons is you, Teresa. You&rsquo;ve played fair with me, and I&rsquo;ll
  play fair with you. I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t buy you with a fake. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave!&rdquo; She struggled to free herself. &ldquo;Dave,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; His voice was rough with emotion. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
  talk straight&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t any other way. I&mdash;I think I loved
  you, Teresa, that night, the first time I saw you, when you stood on the
  threshold of your father&rsquo;s room. To-night I know that I love you, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His hold had brought her very close again to him. He could see a great crimson
  tide flood and sweep the white and suddenly averted face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;I think I have learned other things
  as well to-night&mdash;that you care, Teresa, too, but that the stolen money
  stands between you and me. That is what I mean by buying you, and your love,
  with a fake. If I returned the money on that account it would not be because
  I had suddenly become honest&mdash;which is the one thing above all else
  that you ask for. It would not be for honesty&rsquo;s sake, but because I
  was a hypocrite and dishonest with you, and was letting the money go because
  I was getting something for it that was worth more to me than the money&mdash;because
  I was making a good <i>bargain</i> that was cheap at a hundred thousand dollars.
  I can&rsquo;t make myself believe that I feel a sense of honesty any more
  to-night than I did the night I first took that money, and I would be a cur
  to try to make you think I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He could feel her hands tremble in his; he could see the sweet face, the
  crimson gone from it, deathly pale again. Her lips seemed quivering for words,
  but she did not speak. And suddenly he dropped her hands; and his own hands
  clenched, and clenched again, at his sides. There was biting mockery at himself
  stirring and moiling in his brain. &ldquo;You fool! You fool!&rdquo; a voice
  cried out. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s yours! Take her! All you&rsquo;ve got to do
  is change your tune; she&rsquo;ll believe you&mdash;so if you&rsquo;re not
  honest, why don&rsquo;t you <i>steal</i> her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; It seemed as though he were forcing himself to speak
  against his will. &ldquo;There is another reason; but, first, so that you
  will understand, there is Millman. It is too long a story to tell you all
  of it. Millman is the man I spoke of&mdash;who is honest&mdash;like you.
  I told him when I was in prison where the money was, and I thought he had
  double-crossed me. Instead, he gave it back to me to-night&mdash;that is
  how I got it so soon.&rdquo; He laughed out sharply, harshly. &ldquo;But
  Millman said if I didn&rsquo;t give it back to the estate of the man from
  whom I took it, he would pay it out of his own pocket, because, for me, he
  had been a thief, too. Do you understand? That&rsquo;s why I said I didn&rsquo;t
  know what I was going to do. My God&mdash;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know yet.
  I know well enough that if the police were tipped off to-night, and got the
  money, that would let Millman out of paying it; but that&rsquo;s not the
  point. I can&rsquo;t squeal now, can I? I can&rsquo;t go sneaking to the
  police, and say: &lsquo;There it is in Dago George&rsquo;s safe; I can&rsquo;t
  get my own paws on it again, so I&rsquo;ve turned honest, and you can go
  and take it!&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t like to face Millman and tell him the
  money had gone back <i>that</i> way&mdash;because I couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;because
  it had been taken from me, and I was doing the smug act in a piker play!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stepped toward him quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave,&rdquo; she whispered tremulously, &ldquo;what do you mean?
  What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get that money&mdash;from Dago George,&rdquo; he
  said in a flat voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get that money if I go through hell
  again for it, as I&rsquo;ve been through hell for it already. Then maybe
  it&rsquo;ll go back where it came from, and maybe it won&rsquo;t; but if
  it does go back, it&rsquo;ll go back from <i>Dave Henderson</i>&mdash;not
  Dago George!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She clutched frantically at his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she cried out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have said you meant that money
  should be returned if it were within your power to accomplish it. I understand
  that. Well, no matter what the result, to Dago George or to me, I am going
  down there to get that money&mdash;if I can. But if I get it, I do not promise
  to return it. Remember that! I promise nothing. So you are free to leave
  here; and if you think, and perhaps you will be right, that the surest way
  to get the money back is to go instantly to the police, I shall not blame
  you. If the police can beat me to it before I settle with Dago George, they
  win&mdash;that&rsquo;s all. But in any case, it is not safe for you stay
  in this place, and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was not thinking of that!&rdquo; she said in a low voice. &ldquo;Nor
  shall I leave this house&mdash;until you do. I&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;for
  you. You do not know Dago George.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He did not stir for a moment; and then, with some great, overwhelming impulse
  upon him, he took her face in both his hands, and held it there upturned
  to his, and looked into the great dark eyes until the lashes dropped and
  hid them from his gaze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Teresa,&rdquo; he whispered low, &ldquo;there are some things that
  are worse than being a thief. I couldn&rsquo;t lay down my hand now, if I
  wanted to, could I? I can&rsquo;t quit now, can I? I can&rsquo;t <i>crawl.
  I</i> took that money; and, whether I mean to give it back myself, or keep
  it, I&rsquo;d rather go out for good than tell the police it&rsquo;s there,
  and see the sneer for an honest man&mdash;turned honest because he had lost
  his nerve, and didn&rsquo;t dare go after the money and face the risk of
  a showdown with Dago George, which was the only way in which he could stay <i>dishonest</i>.
  Teresa, you see, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; His voice was passionate, hungry
  in its earnestness. &ldquo;Teresa, what would you do&mdash;play the game,
  or quit?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The lashes lifted, and for a moment the dark eyes looked steadily into his,
  and then they were veiled again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will wait here for you,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  The Man With The Flashlight</b></h2>
  <p>THE silence seemed like some uncanny, living, breathing thing. It seemed
  to beat, and pulsate, until the ear-drums throbbed with it. It seemed to
  become some mad, discordant chorus, in which every human emotion vied with
  every other one that it might prevail over all the rest: a savage fury, and
  a triumphant love; a mighty hope, and a cruel dismay; joy, and a chill, ugly
  fear. And the chorus rose and clashed, and it seemed as though some wild,
  incoherent battle was joined, until first one strain after another was beaten
  down and submerged, and put to rout, until out of the chaos and turmoil,
  dominant, supreme, arose fury, merciless and cold.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson crept along the upper hall. The pocket flashlight in his
  hand, one of his purchases on the way East, winked through the blackness,
  the round, white ray disclosing for a second&rsquo;s space the head of the
  stairs; and blackness fell again.</p>
  <p>He began to descend the stairs cautiously. Yes, that was it&mdash;fury.
  Out of that wild riot in his brain that was what remained now. It drew his
  face into hard, pitiless lines, but it left him most strangely cool and deliberate&mdash;and
  the more pitiless. It was Dago George who was the object of that fury, not
  Nicolo Capriano. That was strange, too, in a way! It was Nicolo Capriano
  who had done him the greater wrong, for Dago George was no more than the
  other&rsquo;s satellite; but Nicolo Capriano&rsquo;s treachery seemed tempered
  somehow&mdash;by death perhaps&mdash;by that slim figure that he had left
  standing out there in the darkness perhaps; his brain refused to reason it
  out to a logical conclusion; it held tenaciously to Dago George. It seemed
  as though there were a literal physical itch at his finger-tips to reach
  a throat-hold and choke the oily, lying smile from the suave, smug face of
  that hypocritical bowing figure that had offered him a glass of wine, and,
  like a damnable hound, had drugged him, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Was that a sound, a sound of movement, of some one stirring below there,
  that he heard&mdash;or only an exaggerated imagination? He was half-way down
  the upper flight of stairs now, and he stopped to listen. No, there seemed
  to be nothing&mdash;only that silence that palpitated and made noises of
  its own; and yet, he was not satisfied; he could have sworn that he had heard
  some one moving about.</p>
  <p>He went on down the stairs again, but still more cautiously now. There was
  no reason why there <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i> be some one moving about, even
  at this hour. It might be Dago George himself. Dago George might not have
  gone to bed again yet. It was only an hour, Teresa had said, since the man
  had come upstairs and stolen the money. Or it might be some accomplice who
  was with Dago George. He remembered Teresa&rsquo;s reference to the band
  of blacklegs over whom Dago George was in command; and he remembered that
  some one had come down the stairs behind her and Dago George. But Teresa
  herself had evidently been unseen, for there had been no attempt to find
  or interfere with her. It had probably therefore been&mdash;well, any one!</p>
  <p>It presented possibilities.</p>
  <p>It might have been an accomplice; or a prowling guest, if there were other
  guests in this unsavory hostelry; or a servant, for some unknown reason nosing
  about, if any of the disreputable staff slept in the place at night&mdash;the
  cook, or the greasy waiter, or the bartender, or any of the rest of them;
  though, in a place like this, functionaries of that sort were much more likely
  to go back to their own homes after their work was over. It would not be
  at all unlikely that Dago George, in view of his outside pernicious activities,
  kept none of the staff about the place at night.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s jaws closed with a vicious snap. Useless speculation
  of this sort got him nowhere! He would find out soon enough! If Dago George
  were not alone, there were still several hours till daylight; and he could
  wait his chance with grim patience. He was concerned with only one thing&mdash;to
  square accounts with Dago George in a way that would both satiate his fury,
  and force the man to disgorge the contents of his safe.</p>
  <p>His jaws tightened. There was but one, single, disturbing factor. If anything
  went wrong, Teresa was still upstairs there. In every other respect the stage
  was set&mdash;for any eventuality. He had even taken the precaution, before
  doing anything else, to get their valises, hers and his, out of the place,
  since in any case they meant to steal away from this accursed trap-house
  of Dago George. It had been simple enough to dispose of the baggage via the
  fire escape, and through the yard, and down the lane, where the valises had
  found a temporary hiding place in a shed, whose door, opening on the lane,
  he had discovered ajar, and simple enough, with Teresa&rsquo;s help in regaining
  the fire escape from the ground, to return in the same way; but he had been
  actuated by more than the mere idea of being unimpeded in flight if a critical
  situation subsequently arose&mdash;though in this, his ulterior motive, he
  had failed utterly of success. Teresa had agreed thoroughly in the wisdom
  of first removing their belongings; but she had refused positively to accompany
  and remain with the baggage herself, as he had hoped he might induce her
  to do. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be of any use there, if&mdash;if anything
  happened,&rdquo; she had said; &ldquo;I&mdash;I might be of some use here.&rdquo; Neither
  argument nor expostulation had been of any avail. She was still above there&mdash;waiting.</p>
  <p>He had reached the head of the lower flight of stairs, and now he halted,
  and stood motionless. There <i>was</i> a sound from below. It was neither
  imagination nor fancy; it was distinct and unmistakable&mdash;a low, rasping,
  metallic sound.</p>
  <p>For an interval of seconds he stood there listening; then he shifted the
  flashlight, switched off now, to his left hand, and his right hand slipped
  into his pocket for his revolver. He moved forward then silently, noiselessly,
  and, as he descended the stairway, paused at every step to listen intently
  again. The sound, with short, almost negligible interruptions, persisted;
  and, with if now, it seemed as though he could distinguish the sound of heavy
  breathing. And now it seemed, too, as though the blackness were less opaque,
  as though, while there was still no object discernible, the hallway below
  was in a sort of murk, and as though, from somewhere, light rays, that were
  either carefully guarded or had expended, through distance, almost all their
  energy, were still striving to pierce the darkness.</p>
  <p>Tight-lipped now, a few steps farther down, Dave Henderson leaned out over
  the bannister&mdash;and hung there tensely, rigidly.</p>
  <p>It was like looking upon some weird, uncannily clever effect that had been
  thrown upon a moving picture screen. The door of Dago George&rsquo;s room
  was wide open, and through this he could see a white circle of light, the
  rays thrown away from and in the opposite direction to the door. They flooded
  the face of a safe; and, darkly, behind the light itself, two figures were
  faintly outlined, one kneeling at the safe, the other holding a flashlight
  and standing over the kneeling man&rsquo;s shoulder. And now the nature of
  the sounds that he had not been able to define was obvious&mdash;it was the
  click of a ratchet, the rasp of a bit eating voraciously into steel, as the
  kneeling man worked at the face of the safe.</p>
  <p>For a moment, his eyes narrowed, half in sudden, angry menace, half in perplexity,
  he hung there gazing on the scene; and then, with all the caution that he
  knew, his weight thrown gradually on each separate tread to guard against
  a protesting creak, he went on down the stairs.</p>
  <p>It was strange&mdash;damnably and most curiously strange! Was one of those
  figures in there Dago George? If so, it would account for the presence of
  a second man&mdash;the one Teresa had heard coming down stairs. But, if so,
  what was Dago George&rsquo;s game? Was the man going to put up the bluff
  that he had been robbed, and was therefore wrecking his own safe? That was
  an old gag! But what purpose could it serve Dago George in the present instance?
  It wasn&rsquo;t as though he, Dave Henderson, had <i>confided</i> the package
  to Dago George&rsquo;s keeping, and Dago George could take this means of
  cunningly securing it for himself. Dago George had stolen it&mdash;and, logically,
  the last thing Dago George would do would be to admit any knowledge of it,
  let alone flaunt it openly!</p>
  <p>At the foot of the stairs, Dave Henderson discarded that theory as untenable.
  But if, then, neither one of the two in there was Dago George&mdash;<i>where
  was Dago George?</i> It was a little beyond attributing to mere coincidence,
  the fact that a couple of marauding safe-breakers should have <i>happened</i> to
  select Dago George&rsquo;s safe to-night in the ordinary routine of their
  nefarious vocation. Coincidence, as an explanation, wasn&rsquo;t good enough!
  It looked queer&mdash;extremely queer! Where he had thought that no one,
  save Millman and himself, had known anything about the presence of that money
  in New York to-night, it appeared that a most amazing number were not only
  aware of it, but were intimately interested in that fact!</p>
  <p>He smiled a little in the darkness, not pleasantly, as he crept now, inch
  by inch, along the hall toward the open door. He, too, was <i>interested</i> in
  that package of banknotes in the safe! And, Dago George or the devil, it
  mattered very little which, there would be a showdown, very likely now a
  grim and very pretty little showdown, before the money left that room in
  any one&rsquo;s possession save his own!</p>
  <p>From ahead, inside the room, there came a slight clatter, as though a tool
  of some sort had been dropped or tossed on the floor. It was followed by
  a muttered exclamation, and then a sort of breathless, but triumphant grunt.
  And then a voice, in a guttural undertone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dere youse are, sport! Help yerself!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson crouched back against the wall. He was well along the hall
  now, and quite close enough to the doorway of Dago George&rsquo;s private
  domain to enable him, given the necessary light, to see the whole interior
  quite freely. The door of the safe, in a dismantled condition, was swung
  open; strewn on the floor lay the kit of tools through whose instrumentality
  the job had been accomplished; and the man with the flashlight was bending
  forward, the white ray flooding the inside of the safe.</p>
  <p>There came suddenly now a queer twitching to Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips,
  and it came coincidentally with a sharp exclamation of delight from the man
  with the flashlight. In the man&rsquo;s hand was the original package of
  banknotes, its torn corner identifying it instantly to Dave Henderson, and
  evidencing with equal certainty to its immediate possessor that it was the
  object, presumably, which was sought.</p>
  <p>And now the man with the flashlight, without turning, reached out and laid
  the package on the desk beside the safe. The movement, however, sent the
  flashlight&rsquo;s ray in a jerky half circle around the room, and mechanically
  Dave Henderson raised his hand and brushed it across his eyes. Was <i>that</i> fancy&mdash;what
  he had seen? It was gone now, it was dark in there now, for the flashlight
  was boring into the safe again, and the man with the flashlight seemed intent
  on the balance of the safe&rsquo;s contents. It had been only a glimpse,
  a glimpse that had lasted no longer than the time it takes a watch to tick,
  but it seemed to have mirrored itself upon Dave Henderson&rsquo;s brain so
  that he could still see it even in the darkness: It was a huddled form on
  the floor, close by the bed, just as though it had pitched itself convulsively
  out of the bed, and it lay there sprawled grotesquely, and the white face
  had seemed to grin at him in a horrid and contorted way&mdash;and it was
  the face of Dago George.</p>
  <p>The man with the flashlight spoke suddenly over his shoulder to his companion:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve pulled a good job, Maggot!&rdquo; he said approvingly. &ldquo;Better
  than either Cunny or me was looking for, I guess. And so much so that I guess
  Cunny had better horn in himself before we close up for the night. You beat
  it over to the joint and bring him back. Tell him there&rsquo;s some queer
  stuff in this safe besides what we were after and what we got&mdash;some
  gang stuff that&rsquo;ll mabbe interest him, &rsquo;cause he said he wasn&rsquo;t
  very fond of Dago George. I don&rsquo;t know whether he&rsquo;ll want to
  take any of it or not, or whether he&rsquo;d rather let the police have it
  when they wise up to this in the morning. He can look it over for himself.
  Tell him I want him to see it before I monkey with it myself. You can leave
  your watchmaker&rsquo;s tools there. You ought to be back in a little better
  than ten minutes if you hurry. We got a good hour and more yet before daylight,
  and before any of the crowd that work here gets back on the job, and until
  then we got the house to ourselves, but that&rsquo;s no reason for wasting
  any fleeting moments, so get a move on! See?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; grunted the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, beat it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Footsteps sounded from the room, coming in the direction of the doorway,
  and Dave Henderson slipped instantly across the hall, and edged in behind
  the door, that, opening back into the hall, afforded him both a convenient
  and secure retreat. The smile on his lips was more pleasant now. It was very
  thoughtful of the man with the flashlight&mdash;very! He cared nothing about
  the other man, who was now walking stealthily down the hall toward the front
  door; the <i>money</i> was still in that room in there! Also, he was glad
  to have had confirmed what he had already surmised&mdash;that Dago George
  slept alone in The Iron Tavern.</p>
  <p>The front door opened and closed again softly. Dave Henderson stole silently
  across the hall again, and crouched against the opposite wall once more,
  but this time almost at the door jamb itself.</p>
  <p>The flashlight, full on, lay on the desk. It played over the package of
  banknotes, and sent back a reflected gleam from the nickel-work of a telephone
  instrument that stood a few inches further along on the desk. The man&rsquo;s
  form, his back to the door, and back of the light, was like a silhouetted
  shadow. It was quiet, silent now in the house. Perhaps five seconds passed,
  and then the man chuckled low and wheezingly.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson grew suddenly rigid. It startled him. Somewhere he had heard
  that chuckle before&mdash;somewhere. It seemed striving to stir and awaken
  memory. There was something strangely familiar about it, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>The man, still chuckling, was muttering audibly to himself now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure, that&rsquo;s the dope! The Scorpion&mdash;eh? Cunny the Scorpion!
  Nice name! Well, we&rsquo;ll see who gets <i>stung!</i> I guess ten minutes&rsquo; start
  ain&rsquo;t good enough; but if some one&rsquo;s chasing the Scorpion, he
  won&rsquo;t have so much time to chase me. Yes, I guess this is where I fade
  away&mdash;with the goods. By the time there&rsquo;s been anything straightened
  out, and even if he squeals if he&rsquo;s caught, I guess I&rsquo;ll be far
  enough away to worry&mdash;not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s face had grown as white and set as chiselled marble;
  but he did not move.</p>
  <p>The man leaned abruptly forward over the desk, picked up the telephone,
  chuckled again, and then snatched the receiver from the hook. And the next
  instant, his voice full of well-simulated terror, he was calling wildly,
  frantically, into the transmitter:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Central!... Central!... For God&rsquo;s sake!... Quick!... Help!...
  I&rsquo;m Dago George.... The Iron Tavern.... They&rsquo;re murdering me....
  Get the police!... For God&rsquo;s sake!... Get the police.... Tell them
  Cunny Smeeks is murdering me.... Hurry!... Quick!... For God&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man allowed the telephone and the unhooked receiver to crash abruptly
  to the floor. The cord, catching the flashlight, carried the flashlight with
  it, and the light went out.</p>
  <p>And then Dave Henderson moved. With a spring, he was half-way across the
  room&mdash;and his own flashlight stabbed a lane of light through the blackness,
  and struck, as the other whirled with a startled cry, full on the man&rsquo;s
  face.</p>
  <p>It was Bookie Skarvan.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
  Bookie Skarvan Pays His Account</b></h2>
  <p>THE little red-rimmed eyes blinked into the glare&mdash;it was the only
  color left in the white, flabby face&mdash;the red rims of the furtive little
  eyes. Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s fat hand lifted and tugged at his collar, as
  though the collar choked him. He fell back a step and his heel crunched upon
  the telephone transmitter, and smashed it. And then Bookie Skarvan licked
  his lips&mdash;and attempted a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; mumbled Bookie Skarvan, &ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t see
  your face. Who&mdash;who are you?&rdquo; The sound of his own voice, husky
  and shaken as it was, seemed to bring him a certain reassurance. &ldquo;What
  do you want? Eh&mdash;what do you want?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson made no reply. It seemed as though his mind and soul and
  body were engulfed in some primal, savage ecstasy. Years swept their lightning
  sequence through his brain; hours, with the prison walls and iron bars around
  him, in which he had promised himself this moment, seemed to live their life
  and existence over again. He said no word; he made no sound&mdash;but, with
  the flashlight still playing without a flicker of movement upon the other,
  he felt, with the back of his revolver hand, over Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s
  clothing, located in one of the pockets Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s revolver,
  and, with utter contempt for any move the man might make through the opening
  thus given him, hooked the guard of his own revolver on the little finger
  of the hand that held the flashlight, and unceremoniously jerked the other&rsquo;s
  weapon out from the pocket and tossed it to the far end of the desk. The
  flashlight lifted then, and circled the walls of the room. Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s
  complaint had not gone unheeded. Bookie Skarvan would have ample opportunity
  to see whose face it was! The flashlight found and held on the electric-light
  switch. It was on the opposite wall behind Bookie Skarvan. Dave Henderson
  shoved the man roughly out of the way, stepped quickly forward to the wall,
  switched on the light&mdash;and swung around to face Bookie Skarvan.</p>
  <p>For an instant Bookie Skarvan stood there without movement, the little eyes
  dilating, the white face turning ashen and gray, and then great beads of
  sweat sprang out upon the forehead&mdash;and a scream of abject terror pealed
  through the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; screamed Bookie Skarvan. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead!
  Go away! Go back to hell where you belong!&rdquo; His hands clawed out in
  front of him. &ldquo;Do you hear? You&rsquo;re dead&mdash;dead! Go away!
  Curse you, damn you&mdash;go away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson spoke through closed teeth:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ought to be satisfied then&mdash;Bookie. You&rsquo;ve wanted
  me dead for quite a while&mdash;for <i>five years</i>, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no answer.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s eyes automatically swept around the now lighted room.
  Yes, that was Dago George there on the floor near the bed, lying on the side
  of his face, with a hideous gash across his head. The man was dead, of course;
  he couldn&rsquo;t be anything else. But anyway, Dago George was as something
  apart, an extraneous thing. There was only <i>one</i> thing in the world,
  one thing that held mind and soul and body in a thrall of wild, seething,
  remorseless passion&mdash;that maudlin, grovelling thing there, whose clawing
  hands had found the end of the desk, and who hung there with curious limpness,
  as though, because the knees sagged, the weight of his body was supported
  by his arms alone&mdash;that thing whose lips, evidently trying to form words,
  jerked up and down like flaps of flesh from which all nerve control had gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maybe you didn&rsquo;t know that I knew it was you who were back
  of that attempt to murder me that night&mdash;five years ago.&rdquo; Dave
  Henderson thrust the flashlight into his pocket, and took a step forward. &ldquo;Well,
  you know it now!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A sweat bead trickled down the fat, working face&mdash;and lost itself in
  a fold of flabby flesh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Bookie Skarvan found his tongue. &ldquo;No! Honest to
  God, Dave!&rdquo; he whined. &ldquo;It was Baldy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie! I <i>know!</i>&rdquo; There was a cold deadliness
  in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s tones. &ldquo;Stand away from the desk a little,
  so that I can get a look at that telephone on the floor! I don&rsquo;t want
  any witness to what&rsquo;s going to happen here, and a telephone with the
  receiver off&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; Bookie Skarvan cried out wildly. &ldquo;What are you
  going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess it&rsquo;s out of commission.&rdquo; Dave Henderson&rsquo;s
  voice seemed utterly detached; he seemed utterly to ignore the other for
  a moment, as he looked at the broken instrument.</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan, in an access of fear, mopped at his wet face, and his little
  red-rimmed eyes, like the eyes of a cornered rat, darted swift, frantic glances
  in all directions around the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave, do you hear!&rdquo; Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s voice rose thin
  and squealing. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you answer? Do you hear! What&mdash;what
  are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer, kind of queer, to find you here, Bookie,&rdquo; said
  Dave Henderson evenly. &ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s a God&mdash;Bookie. How
  did you get here&mdash;from San Francisco?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan licked at his dry lips, and cowered back from the revolver
  that was suddenly outflung in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I followed the girl. I thought you&rsquo;d opened up to the
  old man, and he&rsquo;d bumped you off with that bomb to get the stuff for
  himself. I was sure of it when he died, and she beat it for here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And to-night?&rdquo; Dave Henderson&rsquo;s voice was rasping now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got the room opposite hers.&rdquo; Bookie Skarvan gulped heavily;
  his eyes were fixed, staring now, as though fascinated by the revolver muzzle. &ldquo;She
  came downstairs. I followed her, but I don&rsquo;t know where she went to.
  I saw the package go into the safe. I could see through the fanlight over
  the door. I saw him&rdquo;&mdash;Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s hand jerked out toward
  the huddled form on the floor&mdash;&ldquo;I saw him put it there.&rdquo; Mechanically,
  Dave Henderson&rsquo;s eyes followed the gesture&mdash;and narrowed for an
  instant in a puzzled, startled way. Had that dead man there <i>moved?</i> The
  body seemed slightly nearer to the head of the bed!&rsquo; Fancy! Imagination!
  He hadn&rsquo;t marked the exact position of the body to begin with, and
  it was still huddled, still inert, still in the same sprawled, contorted
  position. His eyes reverted to Bookie Skarvan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You had a man in here with you at work on that safe, a man you called
  Maggot, and you sent him, with that dirty brand of trickery of yours, to
  bring back some one you called Cunny the Scorpion, with the idea that instead
  of finding you and the money here&mdash;they would find the police.&rdquo; There
  was a twisted, merciless smile on Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Where
  did you get into touch with your <i>friends?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s eyes were roving again, seeking some avenue of escape,
  it seemed. Dave Henderson laughed shortly, unpleasantly, as he watched the
  other. There was only the door and the window. But he, Dave Henderson, blocked
  the way to the door; and the window, as he knew through the not-too-cursory
  examination he had made of it when he had come down the fire escape with
  the valises, was equally impassable. It had been in his mind then that perhaps
  he, himself, might gain entrance to Dago George&rsquo;s room through the
  window&mdash;only the old-fashioned iron shutters, carefully closed and fastened,
  had barred the way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; He flung the word sharply at Bookie Skarvan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;Baldy knew the Scorpion.&rdquo; Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s fingers
  wriggled between his collar and his fat neck. &ldquo;Baldy gave me a letter
  to him, and the Scorpion put one over on&mdash;on that fellow on the floor,
  and got me a room here upstairs. And when I saw the money going into the
  safe I beat it for the Scorpion, and got him to give me a box-worker, so
  he got Maggot for me, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You hadn&rsquo;t the nerve, of course, when you saw Dago George putting
  the money in the safe, to tackle the job alone before the safe was locked!&rdquo; There
  was grim, contemptuous irony in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
  the same old Bookie, aren&rsquo;t you&mdash;yellow as the sulphur pit of
  hell!&rdquo; His face hardened. &ldquo;Ten minutes, you said it would take
  them to get back. It&rsquo;s not very long, Bookie. And say two or three
  minutes longer, or perhaps a little more, for the police, allowing for the
  time it would take central to get her breath after that nerve racking cry
  for help you sent her. Or maybe the police would even get here first&mdash;depending
  on how far away the station is. I&rsquo;m a stranger here, and I don&rsquo;t
  know. In that case, there wouldn&rsquo;t be even ten minutes&mdash;and part
  of that is gone now. There isn&rsquo;t much time, Bookie. But there&rsquo;s
  time enough for you and me to settle our little account. I used to think
  of what I&rsquo;d do to you when I got out on the other side of those iron
  bars. I used to think of it when I couldn&rsquo;t sleep at night in my cell.
  I kept thinking of it for <i>five years</i>, Bookie&mdash;and here we are
  to-night at last, the two of us, you and me, Bookie. I overheard Runty Mott
  explain the whole plant you had put up to murder me, so there&rsquo;s no
  use of you lying, there&rsquo;s no use of you starting that&mdash;that&rsquo;s <i>one</i> thing
  you haven&rsquo;t got time to do. You&rsquo;d better clean house, Bookie,
  for there isn&rsquo;t room enough in this world for the two of us&mdash;one
  of us has got to go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan had crouched against the end of the desk again. He cringed
  now, one arm upraised as though to ward off a blow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what are you going to do?&rdquo; The words came thick
  and miserably. Their repetition seemed all that his tongue was capable of. &ldquo;What&mdash;what
  are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t <i>murder</i> you!&rdquo; Dave Henderson&rsquo;s face
  had grown set and colorless&mdash;as colorless as his tone. &ldquo;I wish
  to God I could! It&rsquo;s coming to you! But I can&rsquo;t! There&rsquo;s
  your revolver on the end of the desk. Take it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again and again, Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s tongue licked at his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know what I mean!&rdquo; Dave Henderson answered levelly. &ldquo;Take
  it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; screamed Bookie Skarvan. &ldquo;No! My God&mdash;no!
  Not that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;<i>that!</i> You&rsquo;re getting what I swore I&rsquo;d
  never give you&mdash;a chance. Either you or I are going out. Take that revolver,
  and for the first time in your life try and be a man; or else I&rsquo;ll
  fix you, and I&rsquo;ll fix it so that you won&rsquo;t move from here until
  your friend the Scorpion gets his chance at you for the pleasant little surprise
  you had arranged for him with your telephone trick, or until the police carry
  you out with a through ticket to the electric chair for what looks like murder
  over there on the floor. You understand&mdash;Bookie? I&rsquo;ll make you
  fight, you cur! It&rsquo;s the only chance you&rsquo;ve got for your life.
  Now&mdash;take it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan wrung his hands together. A queer crooning sound came from
  his lips. He was trembling violently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t very many of those ten minutes left, Bookie,&rdquo; said
  Dave Henderson coldly. &ldquo;But if you got in a lucky shot&mdash;Bookie&mdash;you&rsquo;d
  still have time to get away, from here. And there&rsquo;s the money there,
  too&mdash;you could take that with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man seemed near collapse. Great beads from his forehead ran down and
  over the sagging jowls. He moaned a little, and stared at the revolver that
  lay upon the desk, and reached out his hand toward the weapon, and drew his
  hand back again. He looked again at Dave Henderson, and at the muzzle of
  the revolver that covered him. He seemed to read something irrevocable and
  remorseless in both. Slowly, his mouth working, his face muscles twitching,
  he reached again to the desk, and pulled the revolver to him; and then, his
  arm falling nervelessly, he held the weapon dangling at his side.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s revolver was lowered until it pointed to the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When you lift your hand, Bookie, it&rsquo;s the signal,&rdquo; he
  said in a monotone.</p>
  <p>Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s knees seemed to bend and sag a little more&mdash;there
  was no other movement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson&mdash;and pulled the
  trigger of his revolver to put a shot into the floor.</p>
  <p>There was the click of the falling hammer&mdash;no more. A grim smile played
  across Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips. It was as well, perhaps, that he had
  tried in that way to startle, to <i>frighten</i>, this terrified, spineless
  cur who stood there into action! The cartridge that he had depended upon
  for his life had missed fire! He pulled the trigger again. The hammer clicked.
  He pulled again&mdash;his eyes never leaving Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s face.
  The hammer clicked.</p>
  <p>For the fraction of a second the room seemed blurred to Dave Henderson. <i>The
   chambers of his revolver were empty!</i> His brain seemed to sicken, and
   then to recover itself, and leap into fierce, virile activity. He was at
   the mercy of that cringing hound there&mdash;if the other but knew it.
   It seemed as though all the devils of hell shrieked at him in unholy mirth.
   If he moved a step forward to rush, to close with the other, the very paroxysm
   of fear that possessed Bookie Skarvan would instinctively incite the man
   to fire. There was one way, only one way&mdash;the electric light switch
   behind him. If he could reach that without Bookie Skarvan realizing the
   truth, there would be the darkness&mdash;and his bare hands. Well, he asked
   no more than that&mdash;only that Bookie Skarvan did not get away. His
   bare hands were enough.</p>
  <p>He moved back a single step, as though shifting his position, his face impassive,
  watching the dangling weapon in the other&rsquo;s shaky hand, watching the
  other&rsquo;s working lips. The chamber of his revolver was empty! How? When?
  It had been fully loaded when he lay down on the bed. Yes! He remembered!
  It was queer that it had twisted like that in his sleep. Dago George! It
  came in a lightning flash of intuition. Dago George, cautious to excite no
  suspicion, had been equally cautious to draw, his, Dave Henderson&rsquo;s,
  teeth!</p>
  <p>He edged back another step&mdash;and stopped, as though rooted to the spot.
  Bookie Skarvan, that dangling revolver in the other&rsquo;s hand, his own
  peril, all, everything that but an instant before had obsessed his mind,
  was blotted out from his consciousness as though it had never existed. That
  huddled form, that murdered man on the floor behind Bookie Skarvan, that
  he could see over Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s shoulder, had raised his hand in
  a swift, sudden movement, and had thrust it under the mattress at the head
  of the bed, and had snatched out a revolver.</p>
  <p>It was quick, quick as thought, quick as the winking of an eye. A shout
  of warning rose to Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips&mdash;and was drowned in the
  report of the revolver shot, deafening, racketing, in the confined space.
  And, as though thrown into relief by the flash and the tongue flame of the
  revolver, a picture seemed to sear itself into Dave Henderson&rsquo;s brain:
  The up-flung arms of Bookie Skarvan, the ghastly surprise on the sweat-beaded
  face, the fat body spinning grotesquely like a run-down top&mdash;and pitching
  forward to the floor. And through the lifting smoke, another face&mdash;Dago
  George&rsquo;s face, working, livid, blood-smirched, full of demoniacal triumph.
  And then a gurgling peal of laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and you, too! <i>Con Amore!</i>&rdquo; gurgled Dago George. &ldquo;You,
  too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man was on his knees now, lurching there, the revolver swaying weakly,
  trying to draw its bead now on him, Dave Henderson. He moved with a spring
  to one side toward the door. The revolver, as though jerked desperately in
  the weak hand, followed him. He flung himself to the floor. A shot rang out.
  And then, as though through the flash again, another picture lived: The revolver
  dropping from a hand that could no longer hold it, a graying face that swayed
  on shoulders which in turn rocked to and fro&mdash;and then a lurch&mdash;a
  thud&mdash;and, the face was hidden between out-sprawled arms&mdash;and Dago
  George did not move any more.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
  The Ending Of The Night</b></h2>
  <p>MECHANICALLY, Dave Henderson rose to his feet, and for an instant stood
  as though, his mental faculties numbed, he were striving to grasp as a concrete
  thing some stark and horribly naked tragedy that his eyes told him was real,
  but which his brain denied and refused to accept. Thin layers of smoke, suspended,
  sinuous, floated in hideous little gray clouds about the room&mdash;like
  palls that sought to hide what lay upon the floor from sight, and, failing
  in their object, but added another grim and significant detail to the scene.</p>
  <p>And then his brain cleared, and he jumped forward to bend first over Bookie
  Skarvan and then over Dago George; and, where his mind had been unreceptive
  and numbed but an instant before, it was keen, swift and incisive now&mdash;the
  police who had been summoned&mdash;the Scorpion and his parasite yegg who
  were on the way back&mdash;there was no time to lose! There was no one in
  the house to have heard the shots&mdash;Bookie Skarvan had settled that point&mdash;no
  one except Teresa upstairs. But the shots might have been heard <i>outside</i>.</p>
  <p>His ears throbbed with strange noises; those shots seemed still to be reverberating
  and beating at his eardrums. Yes, the shots might have been heard outside
  on the street, or by some one in the next house. Was that some one at the
  front door now? He held his breath, as he rose from Dago George&rsquo;s side.
  No, just the ringing in his ears; there wasn&rsquo;t any other, sound. But
  there wasn&rsquo;t an instant to lose; both Bookie Skarvan and Dago George
  were dead. There wasn&rsquo;t an instant to lose&mdash;only the instant he <i>must</i> take
  to make sure he made no false move here before he snatched up that package
  on the desk there, and ran upstairs, and, with Teresa, made his way out by
  the fire escape.</p>
  <p>He stooped, and stretched out his hand to exchange his own empty revolver
  for the one that lay on the floor where it had fallen from Dago George&rsquo;s
  lifeless fingers&mdash;and, instead, drew his hand sharply back again. Fool!
  The police would investigate this, wouldn&rsquo;t they? Bookie Skarvan couldn&rsquo;t
  have been shot by an <i>empty</i> revolver! Well&mdash;he was moving toward
  the desk and back toward where Bookie Skarvan lay&mdash;suppose he took Bookie&rsquo;s
  revolver then? He shook his head. He did not need one bad enough for that.
  It was better to let things remain as they were and let the police draw their
  own conclusions, conclusions which, if nothing was interfered with, and he
  got away with the package of banknotes, would point no inference that, by
  hook or crook, would afford a clew which might lead to him. Was he so sure
  of that? Suppose the Scorpion had been let into Bookie&rsquo;s confidence,
  and that the Scorpion when he got here should happen to be caught by the
  police&mdash;and <i>talked</i> to save himself?</p>
  <p>A grim smile settled on Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips, as he thrust his useless
  revolver into his pocket, and, reaching out to the desk, picked up the package
  of banknotes. Well, if anything came of the Scorpion, it couldn&rsquo;t be
  helped! And, after all, did it matter very much? It wasn&rsquo;t only Dago
  George and Bookie Skarvan who were dead&mdash;Dave Henderson was dead, too!</p>
  <p>It had been scarcely a minute since he had first risen: to his feet; it
  was his mind, sifting, weighing, arguing with itself, that had seemed to
  use up priceless time, whereas, in reality, in its swift working, it had
  kept pace with, and had even prodded him into speed in his physical movements.
  He was running now, the package of banknotes in his hand, for the door. Dago
  George was dead. Bookie Skarvan was dead. And if&mdash;</p>
  <p>He staggered suddenly back, and reeled from the impact, as a man from just
  outside in the hallway launched himself ferociously forward across the threshold.
  The package spun from his hand to the floor. Half flung to his knees, Dave
  Henderson&rsquo;s arms shot out instinctively and wrapped themselves around
  his assailant&rsquo;s body.</p>
  <p>Came a snarl and an oath, and Dave Henderson&rsquo;s head rocked back on
  his shoulders from a vicious short-arm jab that caught him on the point of
  the jaw. It dazed him; he was conscious only that he had not let go his hold,
  that his hands, like feeling tentacles, were creeping further up the man&rsquo;s
  body toward throat and shoulders, drawing his own body up after them into
  a more upright position. His head sang with the blow. A voice seemed to float
  from somewhere out of the air:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff, Maggot! Soak him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s arms had locked now like steel bands around his assailant
  and were tightening, as the other&rsquo;s were tightening around him in turn.
  The dizziness was leaving him. They swung, rocking, to the strain. The man
  was strong! A face, a repellent, unshaven face, leered into his. Twice they
  swirled around, and then seemed to hang for an instant motionless, as though
  the strength of one exerted to its utmost was exactly counterbalanced by
  the strength of the other; and over the other&rsquo;s shoulder Dave Henderson
  could see another man, a man who laughed with ugly coolness, and who had
  flaming red hair, and eyes of a blue so faded that they looked repulsive
  because they looked as though they were white.</p>
  <p>Maggott and Cunny the Scorpion! There <i>had</i> been some one there in
  the front of the house&mdash;it had been Maggot and Cunny the Scorpion. And
  at any moment now there would be some one else&mdash;the police!</p>
  <p>That nicety of balance was gone. They were struggling, lurching, staggering
  in each other&rsquo;s embrace again&mdash;he, and this Maggot, who snarled
  and cursed with panting breath. Their heads were almost on each other&rsquo;s
  shoulders. He could see the straining muscles in the other&rsquo;s neck standing
  out like great, purple, swollen cords. And as he whirled now this way and
  that, he caught glimpses of the red-headed man. The red-headed man seemed
  to be quite unconcerned for the moment with his companion&rsquo;s struggle.
  He picked up the package of banknotes from the floor, examined it, dropped
  it again, and ran to Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s side.</p>
  <p>A queer, hard smile came to Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips. This panting thing
  with arms locked like a gorilla&rsquo;s around him seemed to be weakening
  a little&mdash;or was it a trick? He tightened his own hold, and edged his
  own hands a little higher up&mdash;and still a little higher. If he could
  only tear himself loose for the fraction of a second, and get his fingers
  on that panting throat! No, the man wasn&rsquo;t weakening so much after
  all! The man seemed to sense his intention; and with a sudden twist, each
  endeavoring to out-maneuver the other, they spun in a wider circle, like
  drunken dancers in some mad revel, and crashed against the wall, and rebounded
  from it, and hung again, swaying like crazy pendulums, in the middle of the
  floor.</p>
  <p>The red-headed man&rsquo;s voice came suddenly from across the room:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Soak him, Maggot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was the Scorpion. The Scorpion seemed to be taking some interest at
  last in something besides Bookie Skarvan and the package of money.</p>
  <p>A grunted oath from Dave Henderson&rsquo;s antagonist answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn it, I can&rsquo;t! Curse youse, why don&rsquo;t youse lend a
  hand!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With a quick, sudden wrench, Dave Henderson tried to free himself. It resulted
  only in a wild swirl in a half circle that almost pitched him, and with him
  the other, to the floor. But he saw the Scorpion now. The Scorpion had risen
  to his feet from Bookie Skarvan&rsquo;s side, and was balancing a revolver
  in his hand; and now the Scorpion&rsquo;s voice seemed to hold a sort of
  purring note, velvet in its softness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, then, Maggot! We might as well have a clean-up here, since
  he&rsquo;s started it. I guess we came just about in time, or he&rsquo;d
  have had the money as well as our fat friend there&mdash;that he <i>got</i>.
  It looks as though we ought to even up the score.&rdquo; The revolver lifted
  in the Scorpion&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Jump away, Maggot&mdash;I&rsquo;m going
  to lead the ace of trumps!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The eyes were white&mdash;not blue; there was no blue in them; they were
  white&mdash;two little white spots across the room. They held a devil&rsquo;s
  menace in them&mdash;like the voice&mdash;like the purring voice that was
  hideous because it was so soft. God, could he hold this Maggot now&mdash;not
  wrench himself free, but hold the man here in his arms&mdash;keep Maggot
  between him and those white eyes, that looked like wicked little plague spots
  which had eaten into that grotesquely red-thatched face.</p>
  <p>Maggot was fighting like a demon now to tear himself free. A sweat bead
  spurted out on Dave Henderson&rsquo;s forehead and rolled down his face.
  The white eyes came dancing nearer&mdash;nearer. They circled and circled,
  as he circled&mdash;Maggot was the shield. He whirled this way and that.
  The muscles of his arms cracked, as they swung and whipped Maggot around
  in furious gyrations.</p>
  <p>A shot rang out. Something sang with an angry hum and hot breath past Dave
  Henderson&rsquo;s cheek. The velvet voice laughed. Maggot screamed in a mixture
  of rage and fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Curse youse, youse fool! Youse&rsquo;ll hit me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get him next time, Maggot,&rdquo; purred the velvet voice.</p>
  <p>The white eyes kept too far away&mdash;that was what was the matter&mdash;too
  far away. If they would only come near&mdash;near enough so that of a sudden
  he could let go his grip and launch this squirming human shield full, like
  a battering ram, into those white eyes. That was the only chance there was.
  Only the Scorpion was too cunning for that&mdash;he kept too far away.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson swung madly around again, interposing Maggot&rsquo;s body
  as the Scorpion darted to one side; and then suddenly, and for the first
  time, there came a sound from Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips&mdash;a low cry
  of pain. <i>Teresa!</i></p>
  <p>It was only a glimpse he got&mdash;perhaps it wasn&rsquo;t real! Just a
  glimpse into the hallway where the light from the room streamed out&mdash;just
  a glimpse of a figure on the stairs who leaned out over the banister, and
  whose face was white as death itself, and whose hands seemed to grip and
  cling to the banister rail as though they were welded there.</p>
  <p>Teresa! He grew sick at heart as he struggled now. Teresa! If he could only
  have kept her out of this; if only, at least, she were not there to <i>see!</i> It
  couldn&rsquo;t last much longer! True, Maggot, beyond doubt, beyond shadow
  of trickery now, had had his fill of fighting, and there was fear upon the
  man, the fear of an unlucky shot from the Scorpion, and he was whimpering
  now, and he struggled only apathetically, but it took strength to drag even
  a dead weight around and around and that strength would not last forever.
  Teresa! She had heard those shots from up above&mdash;she had <i>seen</i> the
  Scorpion fire once, and miss, and she&mdash;</p>
  <p>The Scorpion laughed out. It looked like a sure shot now! Dave Henderson
  jerked Maggot in front of him, but his swirling, mad gyrations had brought
  him into the angle that the desk made with the wall, and, turn as he would
  now, the Scorpion could reach in around the end of the desk, and almost touch
  him with the revolver muzzle itself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got him, Maggot!&rdquo; purred the Scorpion. &ldquo;I got him now,
  the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man&rsquo;s voice ended in a startled cry. The sweat was running into
  Dave Henderson&rsquo;s eyes, he could scarcely see&mdash;just a blurred vision
  over Maggot&rsquo;s shoulder, a blurred vision of a slim figure running like
  the wind into the room, and stooping to the floor where the package of banknotes
  lay, and snatching it up, and starting for the door again.</p>
  <p>And then the Scorpion fired&mdash;but the revolver was pointed now across
  the room, and the slight, fleeing figure swayed, and staggered, and recovered
  herself, and went on, and over her shoulder her voice, though it faltered,
  rang bravely through the room:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought he&rsquo;d rather have this than you, Dave. It
  was the only chance. Don&rsquo;t mind me, Dave. He won&rsquo;t get me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The whimpering thing in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s arms was flung from him,
  and it crashed to the floor. It wasn&rsquo;t his own strength, it was the
  strength of one demented, and of a maddened brain, that possessed Dave Henderson
  now. And he leaped forward, running like a hare. Teresa had already gained
  the stairs&mdash;the Scorpion in pursuit was half-way along the hall. And
  now he saw nothing else&mdash;just that red-haired figure running, running,
  running. There was neither house, nor hall, nor stairs, nor any other thing&mdash;only
  that red-haired figure that the soul of him craved, for whom there was no
  mercy, that with his hands he would tear to pieces in insensate fury.</p>
  <p>A flash came, blinding his eyes; a report roared in his ears&mdash;and then
  his hands snatched at and caught a wriggling thing. And for the first time
  he realized that he had reached the head of the stairs, realized it because,
  pitched forward over the landing, lay a woman&rsquo;s form that was still
  and motionless. And he laughed like the maniac he was now, and the wriggling
  thing screamed in his grasp, screamed as it went up above his head&mdash;and
  then Dave Henderson hurled it from him to the bottom of the stairs.</p>
  <p>He turned, and flung himself on his knees beside Teresa. He called her name
  again and again&mdash;and there was no answer. She lay there, half on her
  face on the floor, her arms wound around a torn package of banknotes. He
  rose, and rocked on his feet, and his knotted fists went up above his head.
  And then he laughed again, as though his reason were gone&mdash;laughed as
  his eyes fixed on a red-headed thing that made an unshapely heap at the foot
  of the stairs; and laughed at a slinking shadow that went along the hall,
  and scurried out through the front door. That was Maggot&mdash;like a rat
  leaving a sinking ship&mdash;Maggot who&mdash;</p>
  <p>Then reason came again. The police! At any moment now&mdash;the police.
  In an instant he had caught Teresa up in his arms. She wasn&rsquo;t dead&mdash;he
  could hear her breathing&mdash;only it was weak&mdash;pitifully weak. There
  should be an exit to the fire escape from this floor&mdash;but it was dark
  and he had no time to search&mdash;it was quicker to go up the stairs&mdash;where
  he knew the way&mdash;and out through his own room.</p>
  <p>Stumbling, staggering in the darkness, holding Teresa in his arms, he made
  his way upstairs. The police&mdash;his mind centered on that again. If she
  and he were caught here, his identification as Dave Henderson, which would
  ultimately ensue, would damn her; this money, wrapped so tenaciously in her
  arms, would damn her; and, on top of that old score of the police in San
  Francisco, there had been ugly work here in this house to-night. If it were
  not for the money, the criminal hoax played upon the police in the disappearance
  of Dave Henderson would not be so serious&mdash;but the money was here, and
  in that hoax she had had a part, and the shadow of Nicolo Capriano still
  lay across her shoulders.</p>
  <p>The night air came gratefully cool upon his face. He drew it in in great,
  gasping breaths, greedily, hungrily. He had gained the fire escape through
  the window now, and now he paused for the first time to listen. There was
  no sound. Back there inside the house it was as still as death. Death! Well,
  why shouldn&rsquo;t it be, there <i>was</i> death there, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>His arms tightened suddenly in a great, overwhelming paroxysm of fear around
  Teresa, and he bent his head, bent it lower, lower still, until his face
  was close to that white face he held, and through the darkness his eyes searched
  it in an agony of apprehension.</p>
  <p>And then he started forward again, and began to descend the fire escape;
  and now he groped uneasily for foothold as he went. It seemed rickety and
  unstable, this spidery thing that sprawled against the side of the wall,
  and it was dark, and without care the foot would slip through the openings
  between the treads. It had not seemed that way when he had gone up and down
  when disposing of the valises. Only now it was a priceless burden that he
  carried&mdash;this form that lay close-pressed against his breast, whose
  touch, alternately now, brought him a sickening sense of dread, and a surging
  hope that sent the blood leaping like a mill-race through his veins.</p>
  <p>He went down, step after step, his mind and brain shrieking at him to hurry
  because there was not a single second to lose&mdash;but it was slow, maddeningly
  slow. He could not see the treads, not only because it was dark, but because
  Teresa&rsquo;s form was in his arms. He could only feel with his feet&mdash;and
  now and then his body swayed to preserve his balance.</p>
  <p>Was there no end to the thing! It seemed like some bottomless pit of blackness
  into which he was descending. And it seemed as though this pit held an abominable
  signification in its blackness and its depth, as though it beckoned him on
  to engulf them; it seemed&mdash;it seemed&mdash; God, if she would only move,
  if she would not lie so still, so terribly still in his arms!</p>
  <p>Another step&mdash;another&mdash;and then his foot, searching out, found
  only space beneath it. He must free one arm now, so that he could cling to
  the bottom tread and lower himself to the ground. It was only a short drop,
  he knew, for the lower section of the fire escape was one of those that swung
  on hinges, and when, previously, coming up, Teresa had held it down for him,
  he had been able to reach it readily with a spring from the ground. But he
  dared not jump even that short distance now with Teresa, wounded, in his
  arms.</p>
  <p>He changed her position now to throw her weight into the hollow of his left
  arm, lifting her head so that it lay high upon his shoulder&mdash;and with
  the movement her hair brushed his lips. It brought a sudden, choking sob
  from Dave Henderson, and in a great, yearning impulse he let his head sink
  down until his cheek for an instant was laid against hers&mdash;and then,
  the muscles of his right arm straining until they cracked, he lowered himself
  down and dropped to the ground.</p>
  <p>He ran now, lurching, across the yard, and out into the lane, and here he
  paused again to listen. But he heard nothing. He was clear of that cursed
  trap-house now&mdash;if he could only keep clear. He ran on again, stumbling
  again, with his burden. And now, though he did not pause to listen any more,
  it seemed as though his throbbing eardrums caught the sounds at last that
  they had been straining to hear. Wasn&rsquo;t that the police behind there
  now&mdash;on the street in front of The Iron Tavern? It sounded like it&mdash;like
  the arrival of a police patrol.</p>
  <p>He reached the shed where he had hidden the valises, entered, and laid Teresa
  tenderly on the floor. He used his flashlight then&mdash;and a low moan came
  from his lips. The bullet had cut across the side of her neck just above
  the shoulder; the wound was bleeding profusely, and over the package of banknotes,
  around which her arms were still tightly clasped, there had spread a crimson
  stain. He drew her arms gently apart, laid the package on the floor, and
  then, wrenching one of the valises open, snatched at the first article of
  linen that came to hand.</p>
  <p>His lips trembled, as he did his best to staunch the flow of blood and bind
  the wound.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Teresa! Teresa!&rdquo; Dave Henderson whispered.</p>
  <p>Her eyes opened&mdash;and smiled.</p>
  <p>She made an effort to speak. He bent his head to catch the words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave&mdash;where&mdash;where are we? Still in the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he told her feverishly. &ldquo;No! We&rsquo;re clear of
  that. We&rsquo;re in the shed here in the lane where I took the valises.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She made a slight affirmative movement of her head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then go&mdash;go at once&mdash;Dave&mdash;for help&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her eyes had closed again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he said. His voice was choking. He called her name. &ldquo;Teresa!&rdquo; There
  was no answer. She had lapsed back into unconsciousness. And then the soul
  of him spoke its agony. &ldquo;Oh, my God, Teresa!&rdquo; he cried brokenly,
  and swayed to his feet.</p>
  <p>An instant he stood there, then stooped, picked up the package of banknotes,
  thrust it into the open valise, closed the valise, carried it into a darker
  corner of the shed, and went to the door.</p>
  <p>He looked out. There was no one in sight in the darkness. But then, what
  interest would the police have in this section of the lane? There was nothing
  to connect it with The Iron Tavern! He stepped outside, and broke into a
  run down the lane, heading for the intersecting street in the opposite direction
  from The Iron Tavern. He must get help! A queer, mirthless laugh was on his
  lips. A wounded woman in the lane was <i>the</i> connecting link with The
  Iron Tavern. And yet he must get help. Well, there was only one source from
  which he dared ask help&mdash;only one&mdash;Millman.</p>
  <p>He ran on. Millman! Something within him rebelled at that. But Teresa was
  perhaps&mdash;was&mdash; No, he would not let his mind even frame the word.
  Only one thing was paramount now&mdash;she must have help at once. Well,
  God knew, he could <i>trust</i> Millman! Only there seemed some strange irony
  here that chastened him. And yet&mdash; Yes, this was strange, too! Suddenly
  he became strangely content that it should be Millman.</p>
  <p>He reached the street, and looked up and down. It was four o&rsquo;clock
  in the morning, and the street was dark and deserted except for a single
  lighted window that shone out half-way down the block. He ran toward it.
  It proved to be an all-night restaurant, and he entered it, and asked for
  the telephone, and shut himself up in the booth.</p>
  <p>A moment more and he had the St. Lucian Hotel on the wire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me Mr. Millman&mdash;Mr. Charles Millman,&rdquo; he requested
  hurriedly.</p>
  <p>The hotel operator answered him. It was impossible. A guest could not be
  disturbed at that hour. It was against the rules, and Dave Henderson was
  pleading hoarsely into the phone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me Millman! Let me speak to him! It&rsquo;s life and death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The operator&rsquo;s voice, a girl&rsquo;s,
  was hesitant, less assured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, give me Millman&mdash;there&rsquo;s a life
  at stake!&rdquo; Dave Henderson cried frantically. &ldquo;Quick! For God&rsquo;s
  sake, quick!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>It seemed a time interminable, and then a drowsy voice called:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello! What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that you, Millman?&rdquo; Dave Henderson asked wildly. &ldquo;Millman,
  is that you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the voice answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dave speaking. Dave&mdash;do you understand? I&mdash;there&rsquo;s
  some one badly hurt. I can&rsquo;t tell you any more over the phone; but,
  in Heaven&rsquo;s name, get a doctor that you can trust, and come!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come, Dave,&rdquo; said Millman quietly. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson turned from the telephone, and thrust his head out of the
  booth. He had no idea where he was in New York, save that he was near The
  Iron Tavern. He dared not mention that. Before many hours the papers would
  be full of The Iron Tavern&mdash;and the telephone operator might hear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this address?&rdquo; he called out to a man behind the
  counter.</p>
  <p>The man told him.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson repeated the address into the phone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Dave,&rdquo; Millman&rsquo;s voice came quickly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
  be there as soon as I can get my car, and pick up the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson stepped out into the night, and pulled off his hat. His forehead
  was dripping wet. He walked back to the lane, listened, heard nothing, and
  stole along it, and entered the shed again, and knelt by Teresa&rsquo;s side.
  She was unconscious.</p>
  <p>He bent over her with the flashlight. His bandage was crude and clumsy;
  but it brought him a little measure of relief to see that at least it had
  been effective in the sense that the bleeding had been arrested. And then
  his eyes went to the white face again. It seemed as though his mental faculties
  were blunted, that they were sensible only of a gnawing at his brain that
  was almost physical in its acute pain. Instinctively, from time to time,
  he looked at his watch.</p>
  <p>At last he got up, and went out into the lane again, and from there to the
  street. It was too soon. He could only pace up and down. It was too soon,
  but he could not have afforded to keep the doctor waiting if Millman arrived,
  and he, Dave Henderson, was not there&mdash;otherwise he would have stayed
  longer in the shed. It would be daylight before they came, wouldn&rsquo;t
  it? It was an hour now, a thousand years, wasn&rsquo;t it, since he had telephoned?</p>
  <p>A big touring car rolled down the street. He ran toward it. Millman&mdash;yes,
  it was Millman! The car stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he urged, and sprang on the footboard. &ldquo;Go to
  the corner of the lane there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then, as the car stopped again, and Millman, from the wheel, and a man
  with a little black bag in his hand, sprang out, Dave Henderson led the way
  down the lane, running, without a word, and pushed open the door of the shed.
  He held the flashlight steadily for the doctor, though he turned now to Millman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a right to know,&rdquo; he said in an undertone,
  as the doctor bent, absorbed, over Teresa. &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s broken loose
  to-night, Millman&mdash;there&rsquo;s been murder further up the lane there
  in a place they call The Iron Tavern. Do you understand? That&rsquo;s why
  I didn&rsquo;t dare go anywhere for help. Listen! I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo; And,
  speaking rapidly, he sketched the details of the night for Millman. &ldquo;Do
  you understand, Millman?&rdquo; he said at the end. &ldquo;Do you understand
  why I didn&rsquo;t dare go anywhere for help?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman did not answer. He was looking questioningly at the doctor, as the
  latter suddenly rose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must get her to the hospital at once,&rdquo; said the doctor crisply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The hospital!&rdquo; Dave Henderson echoed the word. It seemed to
  jeer at him. He could have summoned an ambulance himself! As well throw the
  cards upon the table! His eyes involuntarily sought that darker corner of
  the shed where the package of banknotes, bloodstained now, was hidden in
  the valise. The hospital, or the police station&mdash;in that respect, for
  Teresa as well as himself, it was all the same!</p>
  <p>It was Millman who spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he said, and touched Dave Henderson&rsquo;s arm; then
  turned to the doctor. &ldquo;Can we move her in my car?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I guess we can manage it,&rdquo; the doctor answered.</p>
  <p>Millman drew the doctor a little to one side. He whispered earnestly. Dave
  Henderson caught a phrase about &ldquo;getting a nurse&rdquo;&mdash;and then
  he felt Millman&rsquo;s hand press his arm again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Dave. I guess I&rsquo;ll open that town house
  after all this summer&mdash;to a select few,&rdquo; said Millman quietly.
  His hand tightened eloquently in its pressure. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take her
  there, Dave.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  God&rsquo;s Chance</b></h2>
  <p>IT was a big house&mdash;like some vast, cavernous, deserted place. Footsteps,
  when there were footsteps, and voices, when there were voices, seemed to
  echo with strange loneliness through the great halls, and up and down the
  wide staircase. And in the dawn, as the light came gray, the pieces of furniture,
  swathed in their summer coverings of sheets, had seemed like weird and ghostlike
  specters inhabiting the place.</p>
  <p>But the dawn had come hours ago.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson raised his head from his cupped hands. Was that the nurse
  now, or the doctor&mdash;that footstep up above? He listened a moment, and
  then his chin dropped back into his hands.</p>
  <p>Black hours they had been&mdash;black hours for his soul, and hours full
  of the torment and agony of fear for Teresa.</p>
  <p>From somewhere, almost coincident with their arrival at the house, a nurse
  had come. From some restaurant, a man had brought breakfast for the doctor,
  for the nurse, for Millman&mdash;and for him. He had eaten something&mdash;what,
  he did not know. The doctor had gone, and come again&mdash;the doctor was
  upstairs there now. Perhaps, when the doctor came down again, the doctor
  would allow him to see Teresa. Half an hour ago they had told him that she
  would get well. There was strange chaos in his mind. That agony of fear for
  her, that cold, icy thing that had held a clutch upon his heart, was gone;
  but in its place had come another agony&mdash;an agony of yearning&mdash;and
  now he was afraid&mdash;for himself.</p>
  <p>Millman had tried to make him go to bed and sleep. Sleep! He could not have
  slept! He could not even have remained still for five minutes at a stretch!
  He had been half mad with his anxiety for Teresa. He had wanted to be somewhere
  where his restless movements would not reach Teresa in her room, and yet
  somewhere where he could intercept every coming and going of the doctor.
  And so for hours he had alternately paced up and down this lower hall here,
  and thrown himself upon this great, wide, sheet-covered divan where he sat
  now. And in those hours his mind, it seemed, had run the gamut of every emotion
  a human soul could know. It ached now&mdash;physically. His temples throbbed
  and hurt.</p>
  <p>His eyes strayed around the hall, and held on a large sheet-draped piece
  of furniture over beyond the foot of the staircase. They had served other
  purposes, these coverings, than to make spectral illusions in the gray of
  dawn! Beneath that sheet lay the package of banknotes. It made a good hiding
  place. He had extracted the package from the valise, and had secreted it
  there during the confusion as they had entered the house. But it seemed to
  take form through that sheet now, as it had done a score of times since he
  had put it there, and always it seemed as though a crimson stain that was
  on the wrapper would spread and spread until it covered the entire package.</p>
  <p>That package&mdash;and the crimson stain! It seemed to make of itself a
  curiously appropriate foreground for a picture that spread away into a vista
  of limitless years: An orphan school, with its cracked walls, and the painted
  mottoes whose scrolls gaped where the cracks were; a swirl of horses reaching
  madly down the stretch, a roar of hoarse, delirious shouts, elated oaths
  around the bookmaker&rsquo;s paying-stand, pinched faces on the outer fringes
  of this ring; a thirst intolerable, stark pain, the brutal jolting of a boxcar
  through the nights, hours upon hours of a horror that ended only with the
  loss of consciousness; walls that reared themselves so high that they seemed
  to stand sentinels against the invasion of even a ray of sunlight, steel
  bars, and doors, and bolts that clanged, and clanged, until the sound ate
  like some cancerous thing into the soul itself; and then wolves, human wolves,
  ravenous wolves, between two packs of them, the police on the one hand, the
  underworld on the other, that snarled and tore at him, while he fought them
  for his life.</p>
  <p>All that! That was the price he had paid for that package there&mdash;that,
  and that crimson stain.</p>
  <p>He swept his hand across his eyes. His face grew set, and his jaws locked
  hard together. No, he wasn&rsquo;t sure yet that even that was all&mdash;that
  the package there was even yet finally and irrevocably <i>his</i>&mdash;to
  do with as he liked. There was last night&mdash;The Iron Tavern&mdash;the
  police again. <i>Was</i> there a connecting link trailing behind him? What
  had become of the Scorpion? What story had the man perhaps told? Were the
  police looking for an unknown man&mdash;who was Dave Henderson; and looking
  for an unknown woman&mdash;who was Teresa?</p>
  <p>Well, before long now, surely, he would know&mdash;when Millman got back.
  Millman, who had intimated that he had an inside pull somewhere that would
  get the straight police version of the affair, had gone out immediately after
  breakfast for that purpose.</p>
  <p>That was what counted, the only thing that counted&mdash;to know where the
  police stood. Millman ought to be back now. He had been gone for hours. It
  was taking him an unaccountably long time!</p>
  <p>Millman! He had called Millman a straight crook. He had tried to call Millman
  something else this morning&mdash;for what Millman had done for Teresa and
  himself last night. Only he wasn&rsquo;t any good at words. But Millman had
  seemed to understand, though Millman had not said much, either&mdash;just
  a smile in the gray eyes, and a long, steady clasp of both hands on his,
  Dave Henderson&rsquo;s, shoulders.</p>
  <p>There was a footstep on the stairs now. He looked up. It was the doctor
  coming down. He jumped to his feet, and went eagerly to the foot of the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better!&rdquo; said the doctor cheerily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I want to see her,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson.</p>
  <p>The doctor smiled, as he moved across the hall toward the front door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a few minutes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told the nurse
  to let you know when she&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor went out.</p>
  <p>He heard the doctor begin to descend the outer steps, and then pause, and
  then another footstep ascending; and then he caught the sound of voices.
  And then, after a little while, the front door opened, and Millman came into
  the reception hall.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s lips tightened, as he stepped toward the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rdquo;&mdash;he found his voice strangely hoarse, and he cleared
  his throat&mdash;&ldquo;what did you find out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman motioned toward the divan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything, I guess, Dave,&rdquo; he answered, as he sat down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;?&rdquo; Dave Henderson flung himself down beside the other.</p>
  <p>Millman shook his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better hear the whole story, Dave. You can size it up then for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, then!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; said Millman, &ldquo;that I thought I could get
  inside information&mdash;the way the police looked at it. Well, I have. And
  I have got it from a source that is absolutely dependable. Understand, Dave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson nodded again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The police start with that telephone message,&rdquo; said Millman. &ldquo;They
  believe that it was authentic, and that it was Dago George who sent it. In
  fact, without it they wouldn&rsquo;t have known where to turn; while with
  it the whole affair appears to be simplicity itself.&rdquo; He smiled a little
  whimsically. &ldquo;They used it as the key to unlock the door. It&rsquo;s
  no discredit to their astuteness. With nothing to refute it, it is not only
  the obvious, but the logical solution. Bookie builded a great deal better
  than he knew&mdash;for Dave Henderson&mdash;when he used that telephone for
  his own dirty ends. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been so easy for the police to
  account for the death of three men in The Iron&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Three!</i>&rdquo; Dave Henderson strained suddenly forward. Three!
  There were&mdash;two; only two&mdash;Dago George and Bookie Skarvan. Only
  two dead&mdash;and a red-headed thing huddled at the foot of the stairs.
  Was that it? Was that the third one&mdash;Cunny the Scorpion? Had it ended
  with that? Had he <i>killed</i> a man? Last night he would have torn the
  fellow limb from limb&mdash;yes, and under the same circumstances, he would
  do it again&mdash;Teresa upstairs, who had been so close to death, justified
  that a thousand times over.</p>
  <p>But&mdash; &ldquo;You mean Cunny the Scorpion&mdash;Cunny Smeeks?&rdquo; he
  demanded tensely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Millman. And then, with a quick, comprehensive glance
  at Dave Henderson&rsquo;s face: &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t do it, Dave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson&rsquo;s hands were clenched between his knees. They relaxed
  slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rdquo; he said in a low tone. &ldquo;Go on,
  Millman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The man had evidently revived just before the police got there,&rdquo; Millman
  explained. &ldquo;He was shot and killed instantly by the police while trying
  to escape. He had bruises on his head which the police attributed to a fight
  with Dago George. Dago George, the police assume, woke up to discover the
  men breaking into his room. They attacked him. He managed to shoot Bookie
  Skarvan, and grappled with Cunny the Scorpion&mdash;the Scorpion&rsquo;s
  clothing, somewhat torn, and the Scorpion&rsquo;s bruises, bear this out.
  But in order to account for the time it would have taken to crack the safe,
  the police believe that the Scorpion at this time only knocked Dago George
  out temporarily. Then, later, while the Scorpion worked at the safe, Dago
  George recovered sufficiently to rush and snatch at the phone, and shout
  his appeal for help into it; and then the Scorpion laid Dago George&rsquo;s
  head open with the blow that killed him, using one of the burglar&rsquo;s
  tools as the weapon. And then the Scorpion, staying to put the finishing
  touches on his work to get the safe open, and over-estimating the time it
  would take the police to get there, was finally unable to make his escape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; muttered Dave Henderson under his breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all,&rdquo; said Millman, with a faint smile. &ldquo;There
  was known enmity between Dago George and the Scorpion. The Scorpion had come
  to The Iron Tavern earlier in the evening, one of the waiters testified,
  and had brought the fat man with him. The fat man was given a room by Dago
  George. The waiter identified the fat man, an obvious accomplice therefore
  of the Scorpion, as the man who was shot. It dovetailed irrefutably&mdash;even
  the Scorpion&rsquo;s prior intentions of harm to Dago George being established.
  There was some money in the safe, quite a little, but the police are more
  inclined to attribute the motive to the settling of a gang feud, with the
  breaking of the safe more or less as a blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson was staring across the hall. His lips were tight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That waiter!&rdquo; he exclaimed abruptly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the
  waiter say anything about anybody else who got rooms there last night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am coming to that,&rdquo; Millman replied. &ldquo;The police questioned
  the man, of course. He said that last night, at separate times, a man and
  a woman came there, presumably to get rooms since they had valises with them,
  and that they saw Dago George. He did not know whether Dago George had accommodated
  them or not. He thought not, both because he had neither carried nor seen
  the valises taken upstairs, and because Dago George invariably refused to
  give any rooms to strangers. Lots of people came there, imagining The Iron
  Tavern to be a hotel where they could get cheap accommodations, and were
  always turned away. Dago George had gone out of that end of the business.
  The waiter inclined to the belief that the man and woman in question had
  met the same fate; certainly, he had seen or heard nothing of them since.&rdquo; Millman
  shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;The police searched the rooms upstairs, found
  no trace of occupancy except the hand-bag of the fat man, identified again
  by the waiter&mdash;and agreed with the waiter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was Maggot.&rdquo; Dave Henderson seemed to be speaking almost
  to himself. &ldquo;But Maggot was only a tool. All Maggot knew was that he
  was to get the safe open&mdash;for some money. I guess Maggot, when he finds
  out that the police don&rsquo;t know anything about him, will think he&rsquo;s
  lucky. I guess if there&rsquo;s any man in the world who&rsquo;ll keep his
  mouth shut for the sake of his own hide, it&rsquo;s Maggot. Maggot isn&rsquo;t
  going to run his head into a noose.&rdquo; He turned sharply to Millman. &ldquo;But
  there&rsquo;s still some one else&mdash;the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have been friends, intimate friends, all our lives,&rdquo; said
  Millman simply. &ldquo;I have given him my word of honor that you had no
  hand in the death of any one of those three men, and that is sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then Dave Henderson laughed a little, a queer, strange, mirthless laugh,
  and stood up from the divan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m clear&mdash;eh&mdash;Millman?&rdquo; he shot out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Millman slowly, &ldquo;as far as I can see, Dave,
  you&rsquo;re clear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And free?&rdquo; There was fierce assertiveness, rather than interrogation,
  in Dave Henderson&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s taken five years, but
  I&rsquo;ve got that money now. I guess I&rsquo;ve paid for it; and I guess
  there&rsquo;s no one now to put a crimp in it any more, not even Bookie Skarvan&mdash;providing
  that little proposition of yours, Millman, that month, still stands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman&rsquo;s face, and Millman&rsquo;s eyes, sobered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It stands, Dave,&rdquo; he said gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In a month,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson, &ldquo;even a fool could
  get far enough away to cover his trail&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t he, Millman?
  Well, then, there&rsquo;s only Teresa left. She&rsquo;s something like you,
  Millman. She&rsquo;s for sending that money back, but she&rsquo;s sort of
  put out of the running&mdash;for about a month, too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman made no answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five years,&rdquo; said Dave Henderson, with a hard smile. &ldquo;Well,
  it&rsquo;s <i>mine</i> now. Those years were a hell, Millman&mdash;a hell&mdash;do
  you understand? But they would only be a little hell compared with the hell
  to-day if I couldn&rsquo;t get away with that package now without, say, a
  policeman standing there in the doorway waiting for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave,&rdquo; said Millman sharply, &ldquo;what do you mean? What
  are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was some one on the stairs again&mdash;some one all in white. Dave
  Henderson stared. The figure was beckoning to him. Yes, of course, it was
  the nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave,&rdquo; Millman repeated, &ldquo;what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson laughed again&mdash;queerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going upstairs&mdash;to see Teresa,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; Millman asked.</p>
  <p>But Dave Henderson scarcely heard him. He was walking now towards the stairs.
  The nurse&rsquo;s voice reached him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just a few minutes,&rdquo; warned the nurse. &ldquo;And she must
  not be excited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gained the landing, and looked back over the balustrade down into the
  great hall below. Millman had come to the foot of the staircase, and was
  leaning on the newel-post. And Dave Henderson looked, more closely. Millman&rsquo;s
  gray eyes were blurred, and, though they smiled, the smile came through a
  mist that had gathered in them. And then Millman&rsquo;s voice came softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I get you, as we used to say &lsquo;out there,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
  Millman. &ldquo;I get you, Dave. Thank God! It&rsquo;s two straight crooks&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
  it, Dave&mdash;two of us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Millman&rsquo;s face was blotted out&mdash;there was another face that Dave
  Henderson saw now through an open doorway, a face that lay upon the pillows,
  and that was very white. It must be the great, truant masses of black hair,
  which crowned the face, that made it look as white as that. And they said
  she was getting better! They must have lied to him&mdash;the face was so
  white.</p>
  <p>He didn&rsquo;t see the face any more now, because he was kneeling down
  beside the bed, and because his own face was buried in the counterpane.</p>
  <p>And then the great shoulders of the man shook.</p>
  <p>His life! That was what she had bought&mdash;and that was what she had paid
  for almost with her own. That was why she lay here, and that was why her
  face was so white. Teresa! This was Teresa here.</p>
  <p>He raised his head at last. Her dark eyes were fixed on him&mdash;and they
  smiled.</p>
  <p>She was holding out her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave,&rdquo; she said brightly, &ldquo;the nurse told me she was
  going to let you see me for a few minutes&mdash;to cheer me up. And here
  I&rsquo;ve been waiting&mdash;oh, ever so long. And you haven&rsquo;t spoken
  a word. Haven&rsquo;t you anything to say&rdquo;&mdash;she was smiling teasingly
  with her lips now&mdash;&ldquo;Dave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;his voice choked&mdash;&ldquo;more
  than I can ever say. Last night, Teresa, if it had not been for you, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her finger tips could just reach his lips, and they pressed suddenly against
  them, and sealed them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that we are not to talk about that, Dave&mdash;ever,&rdquo; she
  said quickly. &ldquo;If I did anything, then, oh, I am so glad&mdash;so glad.
  You&rsquo;re not to say another word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, I <i>must</i>,&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;Do you think
  I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave, I&rsquo;ll call the nurse!&rdquo; she said in a low voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
  make me cry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was true. The dark eyes were swimming, full of tears. She hid them now
  suddenly with their long lashes.</p>
  <p>Neither spoke for a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else, then, Teresa,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  going to give that money back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no answer&mdash;only he felt her hand touch his head, and her
  fingers play gently through his hair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; she told him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But do you know why?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>Again there was no answer.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson spoke again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember what I said last night&mdash;that I couldn&rsquo;t buy
  you that way. And&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not trying to now. It&rsquo;s going
  back because I haven&rsquo;t any choice. A man can&rsquo;t take his life
  from a woman&rsquo;s hand, and from the hand of a friend take the life of
  the woman who has saved him&mdash;and throw them both down&mdash;and play
  the cur. I haven&rsquo;t any choice.&rdquo; His voice broke suddenly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  going back, Teresa, whether it means you or not. Do you understand, Teresa?
  It&rsquo;s going back&mdash;either way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her fingers had ceased their movements, and were quiet now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Dave Henderson raised his bowed head. The dark eyes were closed. His shoulders
  squared a little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that puts it straight, then, Teresa,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That
  lets me say what I want to say now. I&rsquo;ve done a lot of thinking in
  the last few hours when I thought that perhaps you weren&rsquo;t&mdash;weren&rsquo;t
  going to get better. I thought about what you said last night&mdash;about
  God giving one another chance if one wanted to take it. Teresa, would you
  believe me if I told you that I was going to take that chance&mdash;from
  now on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dark eyes opened now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think God ever meant that you would do anything else,
  Dave,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If He had, you would never have been caught
  and put in prison, and been through everything else that has happened to
  you, because it&rsquo;s just those things, Dave, that have made you say what
  you have just said. If you had succeeded in getting away with that money
  five years ago, you would have been living as a thief to-day, and&mdash;and
  you would have stolen more, perhaps, and&mdash;and at last you wouldn&rsquo;t
  even have been a man.&rdquo; She turned her face away on the pillow, and
  fumbled for his hand. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t just you, Dave. I didn&rsquo;t
  say that last night. I said God offered us both a chance. It&rsquo;s not
  only you, Dave&mdash;both of us are going to take that chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He leaned forward&mdash;his face tense, white almost as the white face on
  the bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Together, Teresa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She did not answer&mdash;only her hand closed in a tighter clasp on his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Teresa!&rdquo; He was bending over her now, smoothing back the hair
  from her forehead. The blood pounded in a mighty tide through his veins. &ldquo;Teresa!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She spoke then, as the wet lashes lifted for an instant and fell again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s chance,
  Dave&mdash;together&mdash;from now on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Into his face came a great new light. Self-questioning and self-debate were
  gone. Teresa <i>trusted</i> him. He knew himself before God and his fellows
  henceforth an honest man. And he was rich&mdash;rich with a boundless, priceless
  love that would endure while life endured. Teresa! His lips pressed the white
  forehead, and the closed eyelids, and then her lips were warm upon his own&mdash;and
  then he was kneeling again, but now his arms were around her, folding her
  to him, and his head lay upon the pillow, and his cheek touched hers.</p>
  <p>And presently Millman, coming up the stairs, paused abruptly on the landing,
  as, through the open doorway of the room that was just in front of him, his
  eyes fell upon Dave Henderson&rsquo;s kneeling figure. And he stood there.
  And Teresa&rsquo;s voice, very low, and as though she were repeating something,
  reached him. And creeping into Millman&rsquo;s gray eyes there came a light
  of understanding as tender as a woman&rsquo;s, and for a moment more he lingered
  there, and then he tiptoed softly away. And the words that he had heard seemed
  to have graven themselves deep into the great heart of the man, for, as he
  went slowly on down the hall, he said them over and over again to himself:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From now on.... From now on....&rdquo;</p>
