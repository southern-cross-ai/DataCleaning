<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE OWLHORNS</h2>

<p class="first">GOODNIGHT crossed the river at a ford whose bottom
sands were scarcely covered by water and made noon camp under the
shade of a lonely willow. Heat was a burning pressure upon the gray
and burnt-brown desert and heat rolled back from the punished earth
to make a thin, unseen turbulence all around him. The smell of the
day was a rendered-out compound of baked grass and sage and
bitter-strong dust.</p>

<p>He lay belly-flat and drank on the upstream side of his horse;
he let the horse drift to graze while he built a smoke and
stretched out in the willow's spotty shade with his hat drawn over
his eyes. Suddenly the sun came around the willow and burned
against his skin and he sat upright and knew he had been asleep. He
rose up then, a limber man with gray eyes half-hidden behind the
drop of his lids. He had a rider's looseness about him and the sun
had scorched its layers of tan smoothly over his face. All his
features were solid and his shape was the flat and angularly heavy
shape of a man who made his living by horse and rope.</p>

<p>When he stepped to the saddle he turned east, as he had been
doing for many days&mdash;all the way out of Oregon's high range.
The Idaho desert lay behind him, and the black lava gorges of the
Snake, and the Tetons, and Jackson Hole and the Absarokas. Looking
rearward across the leagues of rolling grass and flinty soil, he
saw the shadow of great hills lying vague behind the heat haze;
forward stood the darker and closer bulk of the Owlhorns. Sundown,
he figured, ought to put him into Sherman City at the base of those
hills.</p>

<p>Once during the last week he had met a rider and they had said
six words apiece and departed on their separate ways. Otherwise
travelers were to be seen only as fragments of dust-smoke in the
great distance and ranch quarters were small-shaped blurs, like
ships hull-down on the horizon. There was such a ranch headquarters
now before him, directly upon his route to the Owlhorns; and there
was also a pattern of dust on his right, signal of one or more
riders moving. He watched that dust for half an hour before he
decided it was a single rider heading for the same ranch toward
which he pointed.</p>

<p>When a man had long distances to cover, the best way was the
slow way; and therefore Goodnight let the horse pick its own gait.
He sat easy in the saddle for his own comfort, and even- balanced
to save the horse. As he rode, his eyes three quarters lidded to
shield off the glare, he saw all there was to be seen and he
speculated long upon the course of a creek or the shape of a
vagrant track upon the earth, or the distance from point to point;
and sometimes he whistled a little and sometimes he sang a song,
and sometimes he rode many miles in steady silence&mdash;drawn
inward to those strange thoughts which ride close to a man alone.
At twenty-nine, these thoughts had tempered him, had fashioned a
private world with its images and its long thoughts and its hopes
of what might be.</p>

<p>The rider south of him made a sweep through the early afternoon,
and curved in until he was directly ahead, two or three miles away.
In another half hour the man had reached the ranch house toward
which Goodnight also moved at a steady pace. The middle-down sun
burned like an open flame on his back and the horizons turned
blue-yellow. He crossed the bottom of a bone-dry creek, he saw the
flash of bright tin reaching out from the ranchhouse windmill. He
thought of something funny Niles Brand had once said and he smiled;
and he remembered a woman's voice he had heard at some strange
place back in the mountains. He had never seen her face; it was
only her voice coming out of a house&mdash;sleepy and low&mdash;and
it stayed with him, like one short piece of music whose name he
wished he knew.</p>

<p>House and barn and yard came into view and when he got nearer he
spotted two men on the porch, face to face with ten feet between
them. The nearest man was chalked with alkali dust and his florid
face puffed with heat; therefore he was the rider who had just come
off the desert. He was quite tall and had a heavy, high-bridged
nose and sharp blue eyes which now came around and fastened a
coolly inhospitable glance on Goodnight. The other man likewise
turned his attention and for an instant Goodnight thought he
noticed strain and the distant show of fear on that one's face.
Meanwhile he waited for an invitation to dismount.</p>

<p>It was a considerable time in coming. The second man looked back
at the tall rider and seemed to speculate upon him. Afterwards he
swung his glance to Goodnight again and said, "Get down, man, and
come out of the sun."</p>

<p>Goodnight dismounted. He stood at the base of the porch and
rolled himself a smoke and he thought: "The small fellow is glad
I'm here&mdash;I wonder why." He had seen an expression of relief
noticeably show on the man's mouth. He finished his cigarette and
licked it. But his mouth was dry and so he held the cigarette
unlighted, watching the tall man with a greater degree of interest.
He had, Goodnight thought, a maverick smell about him. He was
painted the same dusty color as were all men in this country but
the paint came from another brush. This was Goodnight's quick
judgment. It was subject to revision, but he always placed weight
on his first impressions.</p>

<p>The tall one said with unconscious arrogance: "If you've got
business here, get it done with and be on your way."</p>

<p>The man's words were too sharp and distinct, the tone too clear.
A Western man had a looser and easier way of speaking. Goodnight
said: "Your outfit?"</p>

<p>"Hardly," said the big-nosed man. "But does that matter?"</p>

<p>"Always like to get my walking papers from the boss," said
Goodnight.</p>

<p>The big man smiled in a wintery, indifferent way. He didn't
bother to answer. It was the other one who said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Water's in the back of the house."</p>

<p>Goodnight nodded. He led his horse around the house to a big
trough in the rear. He let the horse drink a little. Then he pulled
the horse back and himself drank the small trickle of water coming
out of the pipe; then he gave the horse another short drink, and
moved back to the front yard. It was not as much as he wanted and
not as much as the horse wanted, but they still had the worst of
the day to ride through and it was better to make a dry march than
to sweat out a lot of water. He stopped at the porch steps, before
the two men. He still had his cigarette and now took time to light
it. He thought he saw relief once more break over the small man's
cheeks. He looked at the tall rider and met the steady onset of the
latter's impatient glance.</p>

<p>"Now you can dust along," said the tall one.</p>

<p>The shorter man said: "Cut that out, Bill."</p>

<p>The big-nosed Bill showed an amused grin. "This man's no recruit
for you, Harry. He's another bum, another fugitive in a land full
of fugitives. There's probably a charge against him somewhere and
he's running from it. Just one more crook trying to reach the
shelter of the Owlhorns before a bullet catches up with him." He
gave Goodnight a stiff jolt with his glance, now losing his idle
amusement. "You can make timber by night. Go on, move."</p>

<p>Goodnight dragged in the cigarette's strong sweet smoke and blew
it out. He dropped the cigarette and ground it under his boot. He
lifted his head on Bill, meeting the man's pushing glance. He said
to Bill in the softest voice: "You talk too much."</p>

<p>Bill gave him a prolonged study. The remark seemed to interest
him more than to anger him; and that was a reaction to which
Goodnight was not accustomed. It quickened his attention and he
watched the tall man's face steadily for a sign of change.</p>

<p>Bill said in a half-interested manner: "Have I misjudged you,
friend, or are you simply making a demonstration for the sake of
your pride?"</p>

<p>"Put in your chips and find out," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>Suddenly the high-nosed Bill laughed. "That's typical," he
commented, turning to the smaller man. "An arrival, a word, a
threat and a showdown. It never varies. There's damned little
originality in this country."</p>

<p>"Is that another speech?" asked Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Don't be proud of your ultimatum," said Bill. "Now I shall
surprise you very much. I am going to leave you standing right
there, high and dry with your gallant attitude."</p>

<p>"That's one way of saying it," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>Bill left the porch and walked to his horse. He stepped to the
saddle and laid his hands on the horn. He gave Goodnight a short
smile. "Don't be proud. If I felt like fighting I should certainly
fight you. But why should I spend that energy and take that risk on
a man who means nothing to me, and probably means less to
himself?"</p>

<p>"Let me give you some advice," said Goodnight. "Don't make
statements you have to crawl out of."</p>

<p>But it didn't touch the tall man. The tall man's smile simply
pushed it aside. He lifted his reins, and nodded at the smaller one
on the porch. "He's no good for you as a recruit, Harry. None of
these stray riders are. You'll hire him, but all he'll ever do is
run for a hole when somebody strange comes up. I'll see you
later."</p>

<p>By habit he set his horse into a run, through the blasting heat
of this day; and kept up the run for a hundred yards or more. The
arid dust boiled around him and hung motionless in the air and laid
its suffocating smell across the yard. The sky was overcast with
heat fog, like the smoke of a forest fire. Eastward, the Owlhorns
showed dim. Goodnight turned his glance back to the man on the
porch.</p>

<p>"What was his name again?"</p>

<p>"Bill&mdash;Boston Bill Royal."</p>

<p>"So," murmured Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Don't let the words fool you." The man on the porch rested back
on his chair and let his arms hang loose across his thighs. He
relaxed as though he had been under strain. He patted his shirt
pocket and found a cigar. He lighted it and closed his eyes a
moment; he was small and dark and his shoulders had begun to fatten
up. He looked harmless in the chair and Goodnight turned half away
to study Boston Bill, now in the distance. When he swung around
again, the little man's eyes were open and watching him, keenly and
sharply.</p>

<p>"You want a job?"</p>

<p>"Riding or fighting?"</p>

<p>"Less of one thing and more of the other."</p>

<p>"Where's Sherman City?"</p>

<p>"Over there," said the man, and waved a hand toward the
Owlhorns. "My name's Harry Ide. I owe you a favor."</p>

<p>"Maybe I missed something," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"He caught me alone," said Ide.</p>

<p>"He was gettin' set to talk you to death?" drawled
Goodnight.</p>

<p>Harry Ide removed his hat and wiped its sweat band. A small bald
spot showed at his scalp lock and the edges of his hair were
turning from coal-black to gray. He had the beginnings of a bay
window and he seemed to have no danger in him. Still, now and then
something seemed to spring out of his eyes at Goodnight, very
bright and very calculating. "I wouldn't jump at conclusions,"
Harry Ide said. "The man's better than he sounds."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the drink," said Goodnight and stepped to his
saddle.</p>

<p>"About that job&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe I'll be back," said Goodnight and rode off.</p>

<p><br>
Boston Bill had reached Harry Ide's ranch house half an hour before
Goodnight arrived. He stepped quickly to the ground and got to the
porch and stood with a shoulder against the wall. He said, "Harry,"
and waited. Somebody moved from the back room slowly and came
across the front room. Boston Bill held himself still, and so
caught Ide by surprise as the latter stepped through the door. Ide
saw him a little too late to put himself on the alert. Therefore he
stopped still, facing Boston Bill. His face hardened as he waited
and he held Bill's eyes with his own guarded glance.</p>

<p>"You see," said Bill, "I have you on the hip."</p>

<p>"So," said Harry Ide, very dry.</p>

<p>"This is just to show you that you can't always be surrounded
and safe. If I want to reach you I can always do it. You didn't
even see me coming. Or if you did see me, you never thought I'd be
fool enough to walk straight at you."</p>

<p>"Was unexpected," agreed Ide. He was listening to Boston Bill
with the gravest kind of care. He remained motionless.</p>

<p>"Your head is full of quick ideas," pointed out Bill, now
amused. "You're trying to think of some way to protect yourself.
You've got no gun. Very careless."</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"It ought to occur to you," pointed out Boston Bill, "that no
man is ever safe."</p>

<p>"It occurs to me now," said Ide.</p>

<p>"Then," said Boston Bill, "it should further occur to you that a
bargain is better than a burial."</p>

<p>Harry Ide slowly reached up with a hand and scratched the end of
his nose. He held Boston Bill's complete attention. Suddenly he
turned and walked ten feet away, and turned back to face Bill
again.</p>

<p>Bill said: "Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>Harry Ide shrugged his shoulders. He said, "What's this bargain
or burial business?"</p>

<p>"You're doing no good fighting me. You may get killed at it. In
any event you're getting poorer at it."</p>

<p>"You're a bright lad," said Harry Ide. "What's the idea you're
bringin' me so kindly?"</p>

<p>"Why should we fight at all?"</p>

<p>Harry Ide gave out his dry answer. "I like to keep my beef. I
guess I always will fight to keep it."</p>

<p>"I can raid you any time I please. I have done so. Fighting does
you no good."</p>

<p>"Show me somethin' better," said Ide. He had been standing. Now
he sat down, still making his motions slow.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?" asked Boston Bill, again curious.</p>

<p>"I was tired of standin'," said Ide.</p>

<p>"No," said Bill, "you did it for another reason. You figure it
would be harder for me to shoot a man sitting down."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Boston Bill. "But I'm not thinking of that right now.
Listen to me. I'll leave you alone. I'll never come near your
range, if you'll stay out of my way."</p>

<p>"You're hurtin' a lot of my friends. I'll stick with them."</p>

<p>"Never mind your friends. Here's another idea. You want a chunk
of the hills for summer grass. Go ahead and take it. Just tell me
when and where you intend to move in and I'll stay out of your
road."</p>

<p>"You are offerin' to sell out your friends if I sell out mine,"
said Harry Ide. "Now why?"</p>

<p>"Your friends expect you to hunt me down and get rid of me. My
friends expect me to dispose of you. That's silly, isn't it? We can
both do better."</p>

<p>"I see," said Ide. "You're wantin' more safety than you
got."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Bill.</p>

<p>"I will think of it," said Ide.</p>

<p>"Do so," said Bill. "It is always better to be reasonable. It is
also much more profitable." He turned to meet Goodnight as the
latter crossed the yard.</p>

<p><br>
The afternoon was half gone and the heat had reached its piled-up
intensity as Goodnight rode east. Nothing relieved it. Long as he
had followed the trail in all its climates, this day was punishment
to him, making breath a labor, turning him nervous. "Hundred and
twenty out here," he thought. The edges of his saddle were too hot
for comfort and the metal pieces of the bridle sent painful flashs
against his eyes. Two miles ahead, Boston Bill kicked up a dust
that clung to the air and got into Goodnight's nostrils. He
reversed and raised his neckpiece over his nose.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the country lifted from its flatness into
rolling dunes of sand and clay gulches; here and there a pine tree
stood as advance sentinel to the hills. The hills were before him,
black and bulky and high, with the yellow streak of a road running
upward in crisscross fashion and vanishing inside the timber. He
crossed a shallow creek, pausing long enough to let his horse have
a short drink; he reached the road and started the roundabout climb
into the benchlands.</p>

<p>His shadow ran before him longer and longer as the sun dipped;
five hundred feet from the desert floor he turned to catch the last
great burst of flame as the sun dropped below the rim, like unto
the explosion of a distant world. After that the land was another
land, blue and still and a-brim with the smell of the hills.
Coolness flowed against Goodnight, taking the sting of the day's
heat from him, and he murmured, "Promised land," and whistled into
the forming shadows. The horse increased its gait and at dusk
Goodnight rounded a bend and came upon Sherman City, whose main
street was this road running through.</p>

<p>The town sat upon a bench, facing the desert but facing the
hills as well&mdash;a double row of buildings on either side of the
road and other buildings scattered through the water-blue dusk.
Beyond these buildings, the road met a canyon and vanished into the
swift rise of the Owlhorns, the shadows of which lay hard upon the
town. A plank bridge carried him over a creek. He rode beside
single-story houses squatted side by side, their lights blooming
through open doorways, through windows coated with dust. Half down
the street another road cut out of the hills to form an
intersection. On the four corners thus formed sat a hotel, a store,
and two saloons diagonally facing each other. One was "The Trail";
the other's faded sign said: "Texican." Beyond the Texican was a
stable into which he rode.</p>

<p>A man drifted out of the stable's rear darkness and looked
closely at him, and said, "Third stall back." Goodnight gave his
horse a small drink at the street trough, removed his gear and hung
it up. He stood a moment in the stall, his hand lying on the
sweat-gummed back of the horse, and afterwards walked to the
street. Here he paused, rolling up a cigarette. The smoke had no
flavor in his parched mouth and suddenly he felt the rank need of
his dried-out tissues, and bent down over the drinking trough's
feed pipe and let the water roll into his throat and fill up his
belly until it would hold no more. Presently he strolled to the
Texican and went in.</p>

<p>This was supper hour and slack time. He stood at the bar with no
company except the barkeep, and took his whisky quick and returned
to the street; and once again he stopped and rolled a smoke. He had
no need of the cigarette but it served to cover his idleness as he
looked upon this small town crowded against the bulky,
night-blackened Owlhorns. A cooler current flowed out of that
darkness and the smell was a different smell, stiffening him and
sharpening his senses. He thought: "This may be the end of the
journey."</p>

<p>He caught a sudden odor of food from the hotel across the
street, its effect on him so sharp that a pain started in the
corners of his jaws. Men moved idly in and out of the hotel, bound
to and from supper, and men strolled by him, each and all of them
giving him a quick glance as they passed; it was a noticeable
thing. Three men came from the second saloon diagonally over the
four-cornered heart of the town&mdash;from the Trail&mdash;and
moved together toward the hotel. One of them was Boston Bill.
Boston Bill saw him and Boston Bill's face showed a small grin as
he went on into the hotel with his two partners.</p>

<p>One more man moved out of the upper darkness of the town, his
body alternately clear and dull as he passed through the lamplight
beams shining from the houses. He was a tall one with sharp edges
to his shoulders and a hard-brimmed Stetson sitting aft on his
head. When he reached the town's center he paused and looked idly
around him and his glance moved to Goodnight, and moved away. He
teetered on the edge of the walk, like a man undecided, and at last
cut over the dust toward him. He had yellow hair and a light skin
blistered by the sun and when he came by Goodnight the light of the
saloon hit his eyes and showed the bright-green glint in them. He
passed Goodnight within arm's reach. He murmured: "Eat your supper
and meet me at the foot of this street."</p>

<p>Goodnight tarried until the other man had swung into the
Texican; then he crossed the dust to the hotel and signed the
register and climbed a set of squealing stairs to an upper room. He
took off his shirt and filled the washbowl from the pitcher; when
he washed he felt the sudden cracking of the mask of alkali dust on
his face and tough as his skin was the soap burned its freshly
scorched surface. It had been that hot a day.</p>

<p>He shook the dust from his shirt and put it on and he upended
the water pitcher and drank all he could hold, still unable to
slake the thirst in him; he was, he thought, like a board that had
lain out in the sun too long, brittle and warped. He passed the
open door of another bedroom, inside which six men sat packed
around a poker table, and saw Boston Bill there. He cruised down
the stairs and found a place in the dining room and ordered his
meal; he sat back with all his muscles loose, fully enjoying the
laziness and the luxury that followed a long day's ride. He ate his
meal when it came and afterwards he remained at the table, a
strange thing for him, and built himself a cigarette. He had been
tired. Now the energy of his supper was a stimulant that lifted
him, and the goodness of being alive made him smile and brought his
eyelids together until shrewd lines appeared below his temples.
Restlessness bubbled up and little things out of the past weeks
came into his mind, little pictures and little sounds, the feeling
evoked by starlight, the smell of rain against the hot ashes of his
campfire, the sing of wind through the high peaks of the
continental divide&mdash;and the sound of that unseen woman's voice
again.</p>

<p>Maybe the urges of a lone man always at last moved like the
needle of a compass to the thought of a woman, or maybe it was
because of the woman who came into the dining room at the moment he
rose to leave; at any rate, all his attention closed upon her as
she paused at the door and looked around her. She was still young,
with black hair and a roundness to her upper body, with a
filled-out completeness that sang over the room at him and excited
all his male interests. Her lips lay together, almost willful, and
her eyes were cool and her manner indifferent.</p>

<p>She had found a table when he went by. She was behind him, but
the thought of her stopped him at the doorway and he swung to look
at her, and he saw that her glance had risen to him. She didn't
look away; she caught his glance and held it, as direct as he had
been, as though she challenged him to break that composure on her
face, or as though, weary of indifference, she wanted to be lifted
from it. Her eyes were black-gray and her hands small and square as
they rested on the table. She knew she was beautiful and she knew
she was a picture framed before his hungry glance. Her assurance
said as much as she watched him. He was a man like other men, with
all the old impulses. Her manner said that too, but she continued
to watch him and he thought he saw a break of interest in her eyes
as he turned away.</p>

<p>He returned to the stable to water his horse; then he went into
the saloon and bought a cigar, and stood with an elbow hooked to
the bar, watching the crowd drift in. Presently he left the saloon
and walked idly past the lighted houses on into the darkness at the
foot of the street. There was the sagged image of a shed before
him.</p>

<p>He paused here and he turned as though to go back. Niles Brand's
voice came out of the shed's shadows. "Been waiting a week for
you."</p>

<p>"Any news?"</p>

<p>"Ain't picked up any trail of him yet."</p>

<p>"I'm guessin' he's here somewhere. These Owlhorns seem to be
where they all hide."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; VOICE OF HATE</h2>

<p class="first">GOODNIGHT made a slow swing to search the
roundabout shadows. The nearest house was two hundred feet away,
showing no light. Farther toward the center of town a pair of men
stood momentarily on a corner and then walked into the Trail,
leaving the street empty. Goodnight stepped behind the shed, coming
close by Niles Brand. Starlight and a thin slice of a moon sent
down a glow upon the sharp, small smile of his partner and the
ruddy face with its pleasant irony.</p>

<p>"How long you been here, Niles?"</p>

<p>"A week. Just layin' around, watchin' men come and go. Keepin'
my ears open. This is a hell of a town. Frank."</p>

<p>"He's around here somewhere," repeated Goodnight. "A man will
only run so far. Then he stops runnin', like a stampeded steer with
no more steam to run on. These Owlhorns have got a reputation for
shelterin' wild ones. He's probably here."</p>

<p>"If he didn't stop somewhere else before he got here."</p>

<p>"I raised a smell of him back on the other edge of this desert.
He had put up at a line camp, nursing a bad leg. Man described
him&mdash;young and gray at the edges of his hair. He pulled out
after two days, headed east across the desert."</p>

<p>"That sounds like him," said Niles.</p>

<p>"If he started over the desert," pointed out Goodnight, "he
wouldn't stop until he got to the next set of mountains. That's
here."</p>

<p>"These hills," said Niles, "are two hundred miles long and fifty
miles deep. How you goin' to cover all that?"</p>

<p>"Pretty soon he'll get awful tired of living alone. Then he'll
come into town for a bust. We'll stick around and wait."</p>

<p>Niles said again: "This is a hell of a town, Frank." He searched
for his tobacco and he rolled a smoke blind, and struck and cupped
a match to his face. His skin was of the florid kind, burned to a
violent red. His eyebrows were bleached to the shade of sand.
Momentarily the match light danced frosty and bright in his eyes.
He breathed deeply on the cigarette. "Everybody walkin' around,
watchin' for somebody else to make a false move. Never saw anything
like it."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"The big outfits in the desert summer-graze their beef up in the
hills. Last few years smaller outfits have started in the hills,
cutting in on the range the desert bunch used to have. Been some
battles on that. Then these hills are full of crooks hidin' out,
and they been nibblin' away at the desert stuff, drivin' it into
the timber and sellin' it to the hill people. As I get it there's a
fellow named Boston Bill who's got a dozen wild ones together.
They're in the business. Talk seems to be that this Bill delivers
the desert beef to a hill ranch run by a man named Hugh Overman.
There's a lot of these small hill ranches and they all stick tight,
figurin' the desert crowd to be legal game."</p>

<p>"We'll just stay around here and wait," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Move easy," said Niles Brand. "All strangers cornin' in here
are watched. A man's on one side or he's on the other and they'll
peck at you and me until they find out. Every time I walk down the
road I wonder when somethin' is goin' to bust."</p>

<p>"If we have to meet to talk," said Goodnight, "make it here at
night."</p>

<p>"I been offered a job," said Niles. "Chambermaid in the
stable."</p>

<p>"Take it," said Goodnight. "That gives you a reason for staying
here."</p>

<p>"Oh, my God," groaned Niles. "Me doin' that. What'll you
do?"</p>

<p>"I'll find something."</p>

<p>"Be careful who you mix with," said Niles. "Awful easy to get
with the wrong crowd."</p>

<p>"All we want is a man," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"If I ever get a decent bead on him I'll shoot him&mdash;and
that's the end of it."</p>

<p>"No," said Goodnight, soft and final. "Not that easy for him,
Niles." He stepped aside from the shed and gave the street a
careful study. A sudden shout came from the heart of town and two
or three riders appeared, lifting the deep dust around them; they
halted at the saloon on the far corner. Goodnight stepped forward,
moving idly back toward the hotel. He passed two dark houses and he
passed a third with a light shining out of an open door; he looked
through the doorway and saw a woman inside, her back turned to him.
Her dress was brown, edged with some kind of metal thread that
struck up a sharp shining; and then he remembered the girl who had
been in the hotel's dining room. It was the same dress, the same
girl.</p>

<p>Beyond her house stood the back side of the hotel, with a narrow
alley between. A man sat on a box in the alley's mouth, an old man
with white whiskers short-cropped and a narrow goatee. He had his
legs crossed, one leg swinging on the other with a quick
up-and-down rhythm, and his glance slanted up at Goodnight from
beneath the tilted brim of his hat. Goodnight went by him, but a
sharp warning struck through him and he turned back to face the old
man. He watched the old fellow and wondered how much the latter had
seen.</p>

<p>The old man's head came up. He had a sly humor on his face, a
bright and beady wisdom in his eyes. He said: "You know why I sit
here in the alley? There's always more wind comin' down an alley on
a hot night. That's why I sit here."</p>

<p>"Good place to see a lot," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"I see a lot and I know a lot," said the old one. "I know more'n
I ever tell. If I told what I knew I wouldn't be an old man. I'd be
a dead one. I guess I'm the only one in town that ain't lined
up."</p>

<p>"Lined up how?"</p>

<p>"Lined up," said the old one with a touch of impatience. "On one
side or the other side. I'm so old nobody cares where I am. But if
they knew how much I knew, they'd care. So I keep still. You ain't
lined up, either?"</p>

<p>He made it as a hopeful question, a magpie curiosity glittering
in his eyes. His leg stopped teetering and he bent forward and
waited for the answer.</p>

<p>"No," said Goodnight. "I'm not lined up," and moved away. He
heard the old one's odd chuckle, half wise and half foolish, and he
thought: "He saw Niles and me." That was something to remember. He
reached the hotel and put his back to its corner and rolled a smoke
to demonstrate his idleness. The Trail saloon was before him. The
other saloon, the Texican, stood over the dust to his right; before
it the newly arrived riders now stood. He lighted the smoke, his
interest lifting little by little, prompted by things which he
could feel but could not see; and he noticed a man ride out of the
hills on a huge bay horse&mdash;a little man with a pock-marked
face and a set of elbows flopping up and down to the horse's gait.
The little man reached the hotel and dropped off, and then he
looked around him in all four directions and his glance stopped
longest on the men posted in front of the Texican. They were
watching him with an equal interest and after he vanished through
the hotel's doorway they disappeared into the Texican. In a few
moments they returned with three others and all of them stood in a
close group; softly speaking; then the group broke and the various
men spread into the shadows, one man remaining in front of the
saloon.</p>

<p>He had about finished his smoke. He dropped it and ground it
out, hearing quick steps behind him. The girl who had been in the
hotel's restaurant passed him and looked at him, and went on. He
crossed the dust to the Trail, feeling the effect of her nearness,
and looked around as he shoved the saloon's door before him; she
had reached the front of a store and she had stopped, her glance on
him.</p>

<p>He stepped into the Trail. He lifted one finger and laid his
elbows on the bar and put his weight on them; and suddenly he felt
fine, with a fresh current of interest running through him as he
thought of the girl's face and the steady expression in her eyes.
The barkeep was a little slow in the way he brought the bottle and
glass. The barkeep gave him a head-on glance. "You drank your last
drink at the Texican, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Bob," said the barkeep, calling down the room. "He drank his
last drink at the Texican."</p>

<p>Four other men were in this saloon. One of them stood at a small
window and looked out toward the Texican; the other three stood by,
silent and attentive. The man at the window turned about, solid of
shoulder and wearing a bristle-sharp mustache. He came forward, the
other three immediately following him. He got directly in front of
Goodnight, who had made a turn-about from the bar. Suspicion lay in
the room. Tension held the men tight.</p>

<p>Bob said: "Don't you know enough to keep in your own back
yard?"</p>

<p>"Whose yard is this?"</p>

<p>One of the others said: "He rode into town before supper."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're strange," said Bob. "Where you from?"</p>

<p>"That's my business, Bob."</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Bob, very soft. "Now maybe." He searched Goodnight
with a glance that believed nothing. "And maybe you're not strange.
Maybe you know what you're doin'."</p>

<p>"Let's all have a drink and find out what I'm doing," suggested
Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Easy won't do it," said Bob. "If you've come over from the
Texican to pull a stunt . . ." He stopped and he gave that idea
some thought. He walked to the door and slightly opened it, looking
toward the Texican. He came back. "You go back there and say we'll
meet anything they start."</p>

<p>"You go tell them," said Goodnight. He had this Bob in front of
him, with the three others on his flank; they boxed him in and he
saw the growing thought of action in Bob's eyes. He made a quarter
turn toward the others and he noticed the instant hardening of
Bob's face. "Bob," he said, "back up . . ."</p>

<p>A man outside yelled, long and full, and immediately afterwards
a gun shouted. Bob dropped his hand toward his gun and made half a
pull before Goodnight's right hand came off the bar with the whisky
bottle standing there. He aimed it high, grazing it across the top
of Bob's skull Bob's knees buckled and he dropped on his hands.
Goodnight jumped past him, to face the others.</p>

<p>But the others were rushing for the street, no longer thinking
of him. He gave a quick look at Bob, who rested on his hands and
knees and tried to shake the fog out of his head. He reached down
and seized Bob's gun lying near the bar; he bent and hooked an arm
under Bob and hauled him to his feet. Sense came swiftly back to
Bob. He battled down Goodnight's arm and stepped away. "Hell with
you."</p>

<p>"If you want a fight there's one on the street. Let's both go
look at it." He returned Bob's gun muzzle first and ran for the
door, Bob behind him. He pushed through and stopped on the edge of
the walk so abruptly that Bob ran into him and pushed him aside.
Then Bob's voice called over the dust to a man&mdash;to the
pock-marked man who had recently arrived in town&mdash;now slowly
backing away from the Texican and away from a little group of men
standing hard by the Texican. "Come here, Slab." Bob ran past
Goodnight into the dust, reached Slab and took stand with him,
backing away as Slab backed away.</p>

<p>The old ways of violence, never changing, never different,
slowly worked through this town and this little stretch of time.
The group now forming at the Texican had been patiently building a
trap for Slab and now were about to spring it. He saw two other men
deep down the north end of the street sitting a-saddle, as though
waiting a signal; he discovered Niles Brand posted at the hotel
corner, looking on at all of this with his half-smiling interest,
and he saw the girl come out of the store which adjoined the hotel.
She walked forward to the hotel corner, glanced quickly at the men
face to face over the dust, and deliberately cut between them on
her way to the diagonal corner.</p>

<p>Bob and Slab had retreated very slowly, one reluctant pace at a
time, until they were within twenty feet of the Trail. There had
been three others waiting here, but now, out of one dark corner and
another of this town, more men had come to place themselves in
support of Bob and Slab until there were half a dozen waiting. A
voice anonymous and unlocated, yelled "Hep," and suddenly the two
horsemen far down the street shot forward on the dead run, headed
for the intersection.</p>

<p>Goodnight shouldered through the men grouped together and ran
for the girl who still was in the street. The pair of horsemen
rushed forward. Bob's voice cut cold and confident through the
night: "Run us down and you'll never live!" The sound of those two
riders was dull and heavy and seemed to grow out of all proportion,
and then Goodnight lifted his glance beyond the girl, to the black
end of the cross street, and saw a line of men spill out of the
timbered canyon into town. He thought: "Somebody laid this
trap&mdash;and somebody's going to get fooled."</p>

<p>He reached the girl and seized her arm and hurried her on,
across the dust to the far walk. He pushed her against the wall of
a building and held her there, feeling the even strike of her heart
against his arm. She looked up at him and her lips drew back from
her teeth in a smile. "Ah," she murmured, "nothing will happen to
me. But it is nice to have your concern."</p>

<p>The group from the hill rushed full into the heart of the town.
He heard Bob crying out, now lost somewhere in the rush of horses.
A great figure of a man, blackly whiskered, led this bunch and his
voice was a hammer blow against iron. "Knock them down&mdash;knock
them down!" The quick, lean report of a rifle followed on his words
and one rider gave a great cry and rolled like a drunk on the
leather. Lifting his eyes, Goodnight saw a man in the window of the
hotel's corner second-story room, both elbows on the window sill,
his face hidden as he snuggled against the rifle stock and took
aim.</p>

<p>The big bearded one shouted and pointed, and fired at the
window. The horses milled, swung wildly around and came onto the
walks. A horse backed full into Goodnight and lashed out with its
feet and broke a board beside him, and swung again, pinning the
girl against the wall. Goodnight reached up, caught the rider at
the elbow and hauled him from the saddle.</p>

<p>The firing burst up with a sultry violence. The unhorsed rider
struggled around and struck out with a fist, catching Goodnight in
the throat. Goodnight hooked a punch straight up from his belt into
the man's chin and drove him away in a spinning turn. He drew his
gun then, expecting more of a fight, but the man never turned back;
he ran and ducked through the confusion, trying to reach his horse.
Goodnight heard Niles Brand's voice somewhere near. He turned and
discovered his partner working a zigzag way across from the
Texican. Niles reached him, softly growling, "There he
is&mdash;with this new bunch!"</p>

<p>"Get away from me," said Goodnight. "You damned fool&mdash;get
away!" The confusion grew greater and the horses were again
breaking under the sudden fire of other rifles thus far hidden. He
had his back to the girl, sheltering her body with his own as the
horses reared around upon the walk and moved at him. He saw a thin,
straight face move through the crush, a young face stretched thin
by the heat and the lust of the fight. A rim of gray hair showed
below his hat and he was grinning, and in a moment disappeared in
the shadows. The big man with the rough black whiskers was calling
them all out and the bunch ran back toward the head of the street
and at last faded back into the canyon.</p>

<p>Dust was a silver screen through which he saw the turned shape
of a man on the ground. Men, many men, came out of the town's black
spots, walking toward the Texican. Bob was gone, and the
pock-marked Slab, and all those who had stationed themselves by the
Trail. He saw Harry Ide step from the hotel and he guessed it had
been Ide who fired from the second-story room of ihe hotel. The
hill crowd had set a trap, but the desert bunch had known of it and
had set one of their own. He thought: "A hell of a lot of shootin'
for no results," and Temembered he had the girl behind him. He
turned on her.</p>

<p>She watched him with the same expression he had noted in the
dining room&mdash;direct and speculative, barely showing interest,
barely giving him hope. He watched her lips change and form a new
shape; he saw her smile spread warm over her face.</p>

<p>He said: "Who was the big fellow with the whiskers?"</p>

<p>"Hugh Overman."</p>

<p>"That his crew?"</p>

<p>"They all came out of the hills," she said.</p>

<p>Harry Ide had gone into the Texican, the crowd drifting with
him. Niles Brand stood over in the stable's archway, smoking a
cigarette.</p>

<p>"I'll walk back with you," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>She gave him a studying glance and for a moment some answer was
balanced in her mind; then she shrugged her shoulders and turned
with him, walking over the dust toward her house beyond the hotel.
Goodnight threw a glance at Niles; he made a small motion with his
hand.</p>

<p>She saw that. She said: "You'll have to be more
careful&mdash;you and your friend. This town has nothing but ears
and eyes. You are being watched now. You'll always be watched."</p>

<p>"Kind of an uneasy town."</p>

<p>"This town," she murmured, and shook her head. She kept in step
with him, across the dust and down the street. The old man, he
noticed, still sat in the alleyway. The girl gave him a swift look
and a sharp word. "Go somewhere else, Gabe."</p>

<p>Gabe murmured, "Yes'm," and faded back. When she reached the
small porch of her house she stopped and faced him. He was full in
the beam of her doorway's light, and by impulse she touched his
chest and pushed him back until he was in the shadows. "You must be
more careful," she said.</p>

<p>He came near her, looking down at her lips. They lay closed but
without pressure, full at the centers. She had to lift her head to
meet his eyes, and suddenly her eyes were heavy and the veiled
expression broke and he saw want come to her. He put his hands at
her hips and swayed her against him and kissed her full and heavy
on the lips, and stepped back.</p>

<p>Her eyes turned blacker and the self-confidence grew oddly
bitter. "You did it very easily, didn't you?" she murmured. There
was the power of hatred in her and he felt it burn against him now,
shocking him and shaming him. He came to her again, not touching
her but so near to her that he caught the fragrance of her
hair.</p>

<p>"I guess I've been alone too long. When I saw you in the dining
room you were the strongest thing in this town."</p>

<p>"Any woman can do that to a hungry man."</p>

<p>"You're not any woman."</p>

<p>"What am I?" she said, letting her voice drop to a whisper.</p>

<p>"Not like anything I've ever seen before."</p>

<p>He turned to go and was stopped by the quick soft murmur of her
voice. "What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Frank Goodnight."</p>

<p>"Do you know mine? Have you asked about me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>She came near him, whispering in his ear. "Rosalia Lind. Will I
see you again?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She stepped back and he saw her self-assurance return. She had
gone beyond her pride and she was annoyed at herself. "Be more
careful than you have been," she told him. "The men in the Trail
are all hill people. The Texican is only for men from the desert.
You went to both places."</p>

<p>"You saw me?"</p>

<p>She watched him, her face shadowed and soft. "I have watched
you," she murmured and turned into her house.</p>

<p>He looked both ways on the street and saw nothing to warn him;
and moved down the street idly to the shed. He paused here, making
up a smoke. He heard Niles grumbling at him from the blackness
behind the shed. "You're doin' mighty well for yourself as a pure
stranger. You know who she is?"</p>

<p>Goodnight said: "Who you talkin' about?"</p>

<p>"The girl. That girl walkin' through this town like a dyin'
man's vison of Paradise. She's Rosalia Lind."</p>

<p>"So she said."</p>

<p>"You see that hotel just the other side of the saloon? That's
hers. You see the store next to it? That's hers. She had a father
who started this town. I guess he owned the town. He's dead, and it
is all hers. Her dad came from Kentucky. There were some other
Kentucky men that came with him&mdash;and these people hang
together awful tight. If she lifted her finger six men would show,
up from nowhere and cut your throat. The boys from the desert know
that and so do the riders from the hills. They step around her
pretty soft and easy."</p>

<p>"All right," said Goodnight. "You almost tipped over the cart,
comin' to talk to me on the street."</p>

<p>"There he was. One bullet would have ended all this wandering
around."</p>

<p>"I'll find him. The one with the sharp face&mdash;smiling?"</p>

<p>"That's the man. But try to get him out of those hills. He's
smart. He got himself in with Overman. Try to get him away from
Overman. It's the same as a bodyguard."</p>

<p>Goodnight drew his cigarette down to a bright butt and flicked
it to the dust. "Stick around here, Niles. I'm going up in those
hills."</p>

<p>"Doin' what?"</p>

<p>"Don't know yet. I'll catch him off first base. Sooner or later.
You stay here until I shout."</p>

<p>He turned back. He walked to the corner of the Texican and
rounded the corner, and came upon Harry Ide standing there.</p>

<p>Ide grinned at him. "Well," he said, "you see what the town's
like."</p>

<p>"That's right," answered Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Stayin' around," said Harry Ide, "or coming back to my
place?"</p>

<p>"I'll be ridin' around," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Go ahead and ride," said Harry Ide. "But you see how it goes. A
man can't stay in the middle."</p>

<p>"This Overman dug a hole for you," commented Goodnight.</p>

<p>"So he did," said Ide. "And we saw him dig it."</p>

<p>He kept his smile as he talked. It was a hard smile; it had
weight and threat. He looked about him, keening the night for its
treachery, and gave Goodnight a short nod and crossed the street,
going into the darkness beyond the hotel.</p>

<p>Goodnight moved into the stable; he paid his bill and saddled
the horse. He rode out and gave the horse a drink and afterwards
started toward the hills, but within a dozen feet he turned
squarely about and rode back, turning the saloon's corner. He
stopped in front of Rosalia's house and got down, and saw her on
the porch. He went to the porch steps and halted. There was no
particular reason why he had returned, or if there was a reason he
could not drag it out of his head. He stood puzzled before her,
watching the door light make its streaming shine along the smoothed
blackness of her hair. She watched him and she waited for him to
speak; she was round-shaped in the light, she was still, with her
lips lying together in gentle fullness. Her eyes were shadowed to
him and he could not see the expression in them. Her breasts lifted
softly and softly fell to her breathing. He came up the steps to
her and he had the impulse to seize her, and fought it back with
difficulty. The pull of her presence was that urgent, straining him
forward against his sense of propriety. A woman had not done this
to him before.</p>

<p>She said in a small, murmuring tone: "Why are you here?"</p>

<p>"You can pull a man against his wishes," he said. "You know
that?"</p>

<p>"Is it against your wishes?" she asked him. He saw her draw
together and harden her spirit against him.</p>

<p>He said: "Turn around."</p>

<p>She held herself still. She whispered. "What interests you?" But
he didn't answer and in a moment she swung until her face was in
the light. He looked at her eyes, at the glow which seemed to lie
below the dark coloring. It came out of her from deep places. It
wasn't just the lamplight shining; it was part of her spirit. He
said: "A man can ride a long way on the memory of that."</p>

<p>Her answer came at him swiftly: "How far are you riding?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>He returned to his horse and stepped to the saddle. He heard her
say: "You can't escape anything by riding. It rides with you."</p>

<p>"I will see you again," he said and went on. At the corner of
the Texican he had a view of the main road running back through
town. Harry Ide had vanished in the darkness, but at this moment
Boston Bill Royal stepped from the dark side of the store opposite
and looked up at him, now not amused or indifferent.</p>

<p>"You scatter yourself in too many places, my friend," he
said.</p>

<p>Goodnight said curtly: "You had better judge your own actions,"
and rode straight for the canyon's mouth, leading into the
Owlhorns: A mile from town he felt the weariness of his horse grow
greater and he pulled into the timber, made cold camp and fell
asleep.</p>

<p><br>
Boston Bill listened to the sound of Goodnight's horse rattle
against the stony underfooting of the road and entirely die in the
timber above town. Afterwards he circled the Trail and walked
quickly along the back end of a row of houses and came again to the
street at the north end. He stopped here, watching the shadows for
sight of Harry Ide. He saw nothing and in a little while he grew
tired of the wait and moved back toward the saloon. When he passed
the edge of the adjoining building Harry Ide's voice struck him
from the rear.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Bill."</p>

<p>Bill stopped, one foot in advance of the other. He waited, not
turning and not drawing his feet together until Ide spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Step back here. I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>Bill turned about and faded into the space between the two
buildings. He reappeared ten minutes later and paused to look
around him. He had not been seen, he thought, and he pulled his
shoulders together and crossed over and moved down the inside wall
of the hotel, thereby coming into the rear of Rosalia's house. He
knocked on her back door and let himself in. She was in the front
room; her face changed when she saw him.</p>

<p>He had sharp eyes and a quick mind. He saw the change and
thought he knew its meaning. He said irritably: "Better be careful
of strangers. You know nothing about that man."</p>

<p>"Next time," she said, "wait until I open the door before you
come in."</p>

<p>"What did he want?" he demanded. "What brought him to you? How
did he come to know you?"</p>

<p>She lifted her shoulders, facing him with a cold sureness. "Did
you hear what I said?"</p>

<p>He came to her, smiling; he lifted his arms to her. She stood
fast, commanding him by the stern expression on her face. She
brought him all the way down from his careless confidence; she made
him sober and restless and unsure. He turned irritable again. "I
can't keep up with your changes. You're warm, you're cold. One time
you're charming. Now you freeze me with dislike."</p>

<p>"I never change," she said.</p>

<p>"You're something all covered over. I never am able to tear the
covering aside."</p>

<p>"What do you think is inside?"</p>

<p>"Heaven or hell. In a woman there's little distinction between
the two."</p>

<p>"You always want to explain things," she said. "Nothing's ever
that mixed up. Everything's much more simple."</p>

<p>"When I first met you," he recalled, "you were charming. You
liked me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I saw something in you."</p>

<p>"Why have you changed?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I see something else."</p>

<p>He flushed. His pride was injured. "Now you see something in a
new man. But you will see something else in him. Let him
alone."</p>

<p>"Who are you to say that?"</p>

<p>"Rosalia," he said, "I want you."</p>

<p>"Wanting's not enough."</p>

<p>"What is enough?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "That is for you to find out."</p>

<p>"There's never been a soul in this world I cared enough about to
change for. There's never been one for whom I'd give up all that I
am, or have, and do what was asked of me. Not until I came here.
You have that power."</p>

<p>"I don't want it," she said.</p>

<p>"There's cruelty in you," he said.</p>

<p>"Honest people are always cruel."</p>

<p>He studied her, his mouth small, his eyes half-shut. The color
of his face was stronger than usual and pride caused him to keep
his injured feelings hidden. He brought on a smile. "You are
accustomed to a high hand. You've always had your way. You've used
the whip when you wanted. But remember this&mdash;you're a woman
and a whip won't do if you want a man."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said.</p>

<p>Irony came quickly to him. He bowed to her, still smiling. "This
seems to be a one-sided conversation."</p>

<p>"You use so many words to say so little."</p>

<p>That touched him and he grew openly angry. "I've heard that said
before, today. By your friend&mdash;by the man who just visited
you."</p>

<p>She said, spare and dry: "Pull out, Bill. If you don't know it,
Harry Ide's in town. Better watch him."</p>

<p>"I have known that for an hour."</p>

<p>"Have you?" she commented, and looked closely at him. He met her
glance until he was warned by the things she might be seeing, and
turned sharp on his heels and left by the rear door.</p>

<p>She was thinking: "He gave himself away. He has seen Harry
Ide&mdash;talked to him. I did not know he would betray his
people." She thought of it, but not for long. A sweet, sharp
feeling ran through her. She stood still, letting all of it warm
her and trouble her&mdash;and remembered the power of Goodnight's
arms. He had come back to look again upon her, and she knew why he
had come back. He had been uncertain of her. He still was. She
thought: "I should not have let him kiss me." Her expression
darkened and momentarily she disliked herself. "Why did I do it?"
She tried to answer the question and could not, and turned
impatient. "I did it," she decided, "and that's enough. If it isn't
enough for him, let him never come back." She moved to the porch
and she stood in the shadows, feeling the first coolness of night
come. "How else could I have acted? If a thing happens, it happens.
I hope he comes back."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; SUN RANCH</h2>

<p class="first">AT daylight Goodnight saddled and returned to the
road, traveling steadily higher until he reached a creek boiling
violently down the breast of the mountain. He crossed a gravel ford
and now left the road, not intending again to use it this day. Deep
in the pines he made up a short fire, cooked bacon and coffee and
shaved; and resumed his journey.</p>

<p>The first sun was high beyond the stiff tops of the pines; this
western slope was still gray and cold. There was almost no
underbrush. The red-bodied pines lay heavy around him, the almost
solid mat of their branches trapping the shadowy pearl light of
dawn long after full day had lightened the sky. A thousand years of
needle-fall made a spongy surface upon which the horse's feet
dropped with scarce a sound; and except for the slight jingle of
the bridle metal and the occasional chukkering of the horse's lips,
and the now-and-then sharp beat of a woodpecker's bill, a churchly
stillness lay all along the aromatic timbered reaches.</p>

<p>Occasionally he passed over a small cattle trail; twice he came
upon a wagon's course. Traffic between desert and mountain summit
moved in errant zigzags through the pines. He traveled without
haste, and frequently stopped to let the horse take a blow. Far
back in Oregon he had felt haste, but with all the weeks behind him
he had developed a patience so that now time didn't matter very
much. In the beginning he had felt a great wild anger; but that
kind of anger could not sustain itself and had hardened into a
fixed and patient purpose. The immediate desire to destroy Theo
McSween in one swift stroke seemed now, after these weeks of chase,
less than enough. All the days of thinking about it and all the
nights of remembering his sister&mdash;whom McSween had betrayed
and destroyed&mdash;made it necessary that McSween should face his
crime, should suffer from the image of it, should have it as a
weight on him that grew greater and greater until it carried him
down in one long slow fall, he knowing his ruin as it came to
him&mdash;forseeing it and suffering with it to the bitterest
end.</p>

<p>He had never seen McSween until, on the previous night, Niles
Brand had pointed him out in the group of horsemen. Born and raised
in the Oregon high desert, Goodnight had frequently drifted from
home. While he was returning from his last wandering, the story had
started and had ended. This McSween, also a drifter, had come into
the country, had made his gallant display, and had ridden away with
Goodnight's sister. Goodnight's parents had objected to the man and
so, the oldest tale in the book, his sister had run away, to make a
marriage. There never had been a marriage insofar as Goodnight
could discover; following the trail to Nevada he had found his
sister listed in the cemetery under her own name. He had located
the doctor in the case. The doctor had said: "Looked to me like
both of them had just kicked around without money, sleepin' any
place and eatin' any place. Your sister was run-down and pneumonia
did the rest. The man pulled out." Then the doctor looked
thoughtfully at Goodnight as he added: "In fact he left her before
she died. You could tell she had been a fine and pretty girl."</p>

<p>It was that last phrase which even now turned its knife point in
Goodnight's bowels. Niles, being a home-town boy, had seen the man.
Now Niles had identified him and Niles's part was over. The rest of
it was his own burden, and that burden had changed him, it had
burned away his carelessness and most of his easy faith; it had
made him tough and disbelieving and sometimes sad. A simple world
had turned into one with a thousand sides, with shades and colors
he had never before seen, with questions that rang like footsteps
in vast empty corridors.</p>

<p>He threw off before another creek beyond noon, rested and
resumed his way. After the first quick rise, the Owlhorns began to
break into benches where short-grass meadows and finger-shaped
valleys lay between the green tree masses. He crossed these openly,
reached timber and climbed again to the next higher bench. The road
which he had been paralleling at a distance all day suddenly swung
around toward him. Thus far the timber had furnished good
traveling, but at this point the land began to break into canyons
and sharp-backed ridges, through which the road made the only
comfortable passage; therefore he took it. Sunset found him beside
a creek and here he stopped, put his horse on picket in a small
flat of grass, and made his meal. He built the fire larger than his
needs, drew his blankets beyond the reach of the light and watched
the world plunge into darkness. Against the utter black heavens the
stars swirled in the universe's yeasty ferment and a small wind,
chilled by this elevation, moved against him and a moon hung lilted
low to the southwest, so thin that it had only a faded glow.</p>

<p>He was not far from the road, and he was now near the summit
plateau of the Owlhorns. Somewhere there would be ranch quarters
and at some time or another travelers would pass and see his fire,
which was as he wished. He smoked his cigarette in content, the
ease of a long day's end coming upon him like softness. When he
heard the run of a horse far down the grade he turned in his
blankets and threw a handful of pine stems on the fire, lifting the
blaze.</p>

<p>He listened to the horse come on as he had listened to the like
sound on many another night in many another place, interest and
caution rising together. He lay flat on his back, his head against
the saddle and his feet to the fire. Sound and rider came quickly
around a bend of the road, reached abreast, and stopped. He saw the
rider's shape bend in the saddle and straighten back. He heard the
leather squeal. A woman's voice came easy at him. "Hello," she
said, and followed her call into the firelight.</p>

<p>She sat still on the side saddle, her arms folded on the horn.
She wore a tan shirt and a long dark riding skirt and a man's hat
sat back on hair the color of dark honey. When she looked directly
at him he saw the lovely turning of her throat. She was on guard;
not so much afraid of him as alert to his presence and skeptical of
him. She said so at once. "Your story doesn't make sense. You ride
away from the road all day, as though you were on the run. Then you
camp where everybody can see you. Then you build a fire big as a
house, and sleep back in the shadows."</p>

<p>He sat up. "How do you know I kept off the road?"</p>

<p>"Bob Carruth followed you for a while."</p>

<p>"Nothing better to do with his time?"</p>

<p>"You didn't think you could ride this far into the Owlhorns
without notice, did you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>She said: "You must be green." Then as he got slowly to his feet
her attention came close upon him. His smile was a white streak
against the shadows and the fire threw its bronze high lights on
his face, making it bony and rugged. Her eyes narrowed on him in
appraisal, and opened wider, She looked quickly around, as though
wondering if he were alone. "This is no place to camp. You'd get a
bullet in that fire before another hour. You're running I
suppose."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "just riding."</p>

<p>She listened to his voice, she weighed it. She had started out
cool and suspicious of him, and she wanted to remain that way.
Still, he saw the change of her lips and he saw a small gust of
expression go over her face. "You're not green," she murmured. "And
you're probably lying." She turned the horse, intending to move on.
She reached the road and swung and stopped; she was beyond the
firelight, deep in thought, and at last she spoke from the shadows.
"Saddle up and come to the ranch. You'll have no luck here."</p>

<p>"What ranch?"</p>

<p>"Sun Ranch. Were you the man in town last night that hit Bob
Carruth with a bottle?"</p>

<p>"He was a little suspicious."</p>

<p>"He had a right to be. You visited the other saloon."</p>

<p>He chuckled. "He had his rights. I had mine. So we're even."</p>

<p>Downgrade was the heavy murmur of horses moving fast. The girl
said impatiently: "Saddle up and kick out the fire."</p>

<p>He made up his blanket roll in quick turns, threw on the saddle
and lashed his roll. He gave the fire a sidewise kick with his
boot, sending the sticks into the nearby water. He said: "Still,
they'll smell smoke and stop," and rode beside her.</p>

<p>"You're not green," she repeated and set the pace up the grade.
"You would have been picked up and brought in anyway and you might
as well sleep in a bunk." At the top of the grade she turned into
timber, leaving the road behind. Presently she halted. "If we go
ahead of them they'll catch our dust and know we're around."</p>

<p>"That's all right, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"If you stay in the hills," she said, "you'll learn nothing's
all right." There was, he recognized, a swing of regret and dislike
in her voice but he thought little of it at the moment, being more
interested in the sound of the horsemen coming along. They had not
stopped at his camp, which made him murmur: "A careless lot. If
they can't smell smoke . . ."</p>

<p>She reached out through the darkness and touched him; her hand
squeezed down, commanding his silence. A group of riders ran by on
the road and a little gust of talk fell behind from them, and then
they faded on. The girl waited a moment before riding forward to
the road. Goodnight came beside her; both horses traveled at a
walk. "That was Boston Bill," she said. "He'll be at the house when
we get there. When they question you, just say that you saw me on
the road and asked for a night's shelter."</p>

<p>"This Boston Bill is full of questions," he said.</p>

<p>"It will be my father who asks the questions," she said. "My
father&mdash;Hugh Overman." Then she remembered Goodnight's remark
and commented on it. "How would you know about Boston Bill?"</p>

<p>"I met him out on the desert."</p>

<p>"He was out there in daylight?" Her voice came at him with a
lift of interest. "Where was he?"</p>

<p>"At a ranch."</p>

<p>"Near Sherman City?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Ide's ranch," she murmured, and said nothing more for a long
interval, apparently turning over the information in her mind. The
road reached through another shallow canyon still rising. The
canyon reached a level area surrounded by the shadow of ragged
hills; a creek made its smooth run directly before them. Lights
sparkled ahead and he saw shapes cut over those lights, moving
around a yard. A plank bridge boomed a warning of their approach
and in another minute they were at the front of a log house built
low and long across the yard.</p>

<p>He saw first the huge square shape of a man in the doorway, the
same black-bearded one who had led the hill crowd into Sherman City
on the previous night. With him was Boston Bill, seeming small
beside the older one's great shape. There were other men, Boston
Bill's men, apparently, waiting by their horses along the yard.
Goodnight passed among them as he walked forward with the girl to
the huge one at the door.</p>

<p>The girl said: "I picked this man up on the road, Dad. He wanted
a sleep and a meal."</p>

<p>Hugh Overman was a cold and distant spirit lost in thought.
Goodnight watched the man pull himself into the present and look
upon him, neither interested nor disinterested. He lifted his hand
and made a strange, stiff upward jerk with it. "Strangers are
welcome," he said. "Show him the bunkhouse, daughter. Show him the
cookshack. See he gets a cup of coffee."</p>

<p>Boston Bill observed Goodnight with a small thin smile, and he
sent a quick side glance to the girl. He must have noticed
something on her face, for his smile broke off and he spoke to
Overman in a lightly provoking tone. "Charity is blessed, Hugh, but
it might be well to consider this stranger."</p>

<p>"You know him?" said Overman.</p>

<p>"I've met him and there's some things about him I don't
understand."</p>

<p>Overman placed his severe and powerful eyes on Goodnight. "You
come here with honest intentions?"</p>

<p>Boston Bill broke in. "He was at Harry Ide's place when I saw
him."</p>

<p>Overman's eyes grew agate-still and in their depths a great
wrath slowly moved. "You're on my place and I have offered you
puttin' up. But we'll see. Daughter, give him his coffee and bring
him to the dining room."</p>

<p>The girl touched Goodnight's arm and turned him. He followed her
to an ell of the main house, through the door into a kitchen. A
light burned on a table and a pot of coffee sat on the back edge of
the still-warm range. Virginia Overman lifted a cup from a hook,
poured his coffee and pointed to the condensed milk and sugar box.
She continued to watch him; she was puzzled and she was uncertain
and this expression softened her face and gave it a sweetness.</p>

<p>"I wish," she said, "I knew what you were doing at Ide's
place."</p>

<p>"I stopped for a drink of water."</p>

<p>"And I wish I knew what Bill was doing there."</p>

<p>She watched him as she asked it and when he only shook his head
and smiled her expression grew lighter until she was smiling back.
"You're like all the crowd. Never say anything."</p>

<p>"What crowd?"</p>

<p>"The drifters and the fly-by-nights and the line jumpers who
hide in every canyon and behind every tree of these hills. I like
to go on quick judgment&mdash;and I wanted to think you were not
one of those."</p>

<p>"Stay with your judgment," he said and finished his coffee.</p>

<p>She pointed toward an inner door. "Now you can go in and stand
your trial." She followed him to the door and her voice called him
around before he opened it. "There are two things to remember.
These men all have past records. They'll be afraid you're after
them, or they'll think you might be one of the desert men laying a
trap."</p>

<p>She waited again for some sort of answer and he saw that she was
anxious for him to speak and clear himself. She had some kind of
hope in him, the reason for which he could not understand. And when
he shook his head and turned to open the door he noticed the
let-down of that hope. She followed him through the door into a
room with a long table, flanked by a backless bench on each side.
Hugh Overman sat at the head of the table, stiff and massive, his
burning glance coming to Goodnight and staying there. Boston Bill
was near him, and his nearness made a tremendous contrast. Overman
was a solid one whose convictions were as thick as the polar ice,
whose temper, was a deep, constant flame; against him Boston Bill
became a thin character with his small disbelieving smile and his
sharp, agnostic eyes. A dozen or more other riders stood around the
room.</p>

<p>Overman said: "I'll tell you at once that if I thought you were
a spy I'd shoot you down. Now, man, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Riding through," said Goodnight. "Or maybe staying if I like
it."</p>

<p>"Your answer turns around upon itself and means nothing," said
Overman. "There is a reason which drives every man. What drove you
here?"</p>

<p>Goodnight pointed his finger at Boston Bill. He turned it,
indicating all the group. "You know what drove these men here?"</p>

<p>Boston Bill said: "Maybe you better answer questions instead of
asking them."</p>

<p>"Still," pointed out Overman, "it is a fair answer. I have taken
all of you at your word. I can do no less with this man."</p>

<p>"What was he doing at Harry Ide's place?" asked Boston Bill.</p>

<p>"I stopped for a drink of water," said Goodnight. "What were you
doing there, Bill?"</p>

<p>Overman answered that for Boston Bill. "It may have been to warn
Harry Ide or it may have been to destroy him. Either thing would
have been welcome to me."</p>

<p>"Except for his interfering," said Boston Bill, "Harry Ide would
have been destroyed."</p>

<p>"I like to see a man get an even chance," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>Overman gave Goodnight a bright-black glance. "Fairness is a
good thing and pity is blessed. But there are ways here you do not
understand. The desert is an evil land inhabited by evil people.
Evil is to be done by as it does, keep your pity for better things.
You interfered from good motives, but you were mistaken."</p>

<p>"He was in town last night," added Boston Bill, "steppin' around
like a stray dog with its tail up. What was he doing there?"</p>

<p>"He dragged me off my horse," said a voice, and then a man came
out of the crowd and walked on until he faced Goodnight. He was a
solid shape burned black by weather, he was a hard one, scarred by
trouble and still wanting trouble. Along the trail Goodnight had
seen many like him, restless and narrow of mind and governed by
passion.</p>

<p>"Brother," said Goodnight, "you ran your horse into me and
missed a woman by six inches with its kickin'."</p>

<p>The man was hungering for a fight; it was a shine in his eyes
and a shape around his mouth. He looked aside to Boston Bill and a
thought passed between them. He squared himself at Goodnight. He
said: "I didn't have time last night to take care of you. No man
can drag me off a horse . . ." He never finished the sentence. It
was a feint to cover what he meant to do, for he swung his hand all
the way from his belt and missed Goodnight's face and fell against
him. He caught Goodnight around the waist to protect himself. He
lowered his head and shoulders and struck sharp up, his head
cracking Goodnight's chin. The blow roared through Goodnight's
brain; he heard Boston Bill say in a casual way: "Bust him up,
Ad."</p>

<p>Ad's weight carried him back toward the wall, other men swiftly
sidestepping to avoid the fight. But one bystanding
man&mdash;Goodnight never knew which one&mdash;reached out and hit
him on the jaw and backed away. Ad had him tackled around the waist
and Ad's shoulders slammed him full force into the wall. He shifted
his body, knowing what Ad would next do, and thereby avoided the
jolt of Ad's knee as it aimed for his crotch. The maneuver threw Ad
off balance, so that his grip around Goodnight's body relaxed, and
at that moment Goodnight whirled free of the man and swung and
caught him on the back of the neck with all the driven-down weight
of his forearm. A thinner neck would have cracked; as it was, Ad
emitted a small wince and fell in a curling drop to the floor,
knocked out by the blow.</p>

<p>Goodnight stood away from Ad, feeling blood in his mouth from
the butting of Ad's head. The fight broke his restraint and a
wildness grasped him and he made a quick circle on the balls of his
feet, watching the others; he had lost his hat and his long hair
dropped over his eyes. "Anybody else," he said. "Anybody at
all?"</p>

<p>He heard the girl speak behind him. "You should not have
permitted that, Dad."</p>

<p>Old Hugh sat stone-still in his chair and Goodnight then noticed
something new in the room. All the crowd had stood in a scattered
way around the table before the fight, but in the half minute of
action they had shifted and now he saw four men placed shoulder to
shoulder against one side of the room, facing Boston Bill and
Boston Bill's group across the table. The fight had shaken them
apart, or distrust had shaken them apart&mdash;the ranch crew to
one side and Boston Bill's riders to the other. One of the men in
the smaller group was Bob Carruth. Then the door opened and another
rider came in and put himself with the ranch four. It was Theo
McSween.</p>

<p>Overman still had his daughter's reproach in his mind and now
spoke: "Right makes right. If a man is just and honest he will have
more strength than the man who is not. This young man whipped Ad.
Therefore he is honest."</p>

<p>Boston Bill gave Overman a cynical grin. "Suppose two dishonest
men got in a fight. You'd say the one that won was honest?"</p>

<p>"Less dishonest than the other," stated Overman.</p>

<p>Boston Bill ceased to smile. The arrogance that lived around his
mouth and in his eyes suddenly jumped to his voice. "I don't want
this fellow around."</p>

<p>Overman looked at Boston Bill and then Goodnight saw a flaw in
the old man's complete self-assurance as Overman said: "I will not
turn a man off Sun Ranch without reason."</p>

<p>"My say-so is reason enough," stated Boston Bill. "You do it or
I'll do it."</p>

<p>Overman lifted his great head and his temper flared; yet he held
his feelings down and his answer was less than Goodnight expected.
"Never mind, Bill," he said, and he flung his arm stiffly up and
stiffly down.</p>

<p>Goodnight nodded at Boston Bill. "You have talked too much
again. Now it is put up or shut up."</p>

<p>Boston Bill's pride was yeasty in him. His color burned in the
light and his big beak nose tipped hawklike at Goodnight. The crowd
waited for him to move, to answer; the compulsion of their judgment
was on him as he stood brooding in his tracks, trying to beat
Goodnight down with his glance. Then he shook his head. "You're on
Sun Ranch. I won't touch you here. This is the second time you have
called me, friend. You're a clever man in pickin' a safe spot to
call."</p>

<p>He nodded at his partners and went quickly out. In a moment
Overman rose and followed him through the door, and the other crew
members one by one disappeared until only Goodnight and the girl
and Theo McSween were here. McSween showed a puzzled interest in
Goodnight.</p>

<p>"I've seen you before, ain't I?"</p>

<p>"No," said Goodnight. "Maybe it was somebody that looked like
me."</p>

<p>Theo McSween said, "Maybe," and started for the door. He turned
in it, looking back with a rapid flip of his head, as though
prompted by suspicion or a fresh thought. He stared steadily at
Goodnight and he murmured, "Somewhere," and left the dining
room.</p>

<p>Goodnight thought: "Why not have it over with now&mdash;I've
caught up with him?" But he knew it had to be another way, for the
memory of the doctor's words in Nevada was a fresh scar in his
mind. He watched the door, nothing on his face; he listened to
Boston Bill's men run out of the yard. The girl stepped around him
and faced him.</p>

<p>"You're not green," she said. "You've got a lot of
experience&mdash;the same dirty kind all the rest of them
have."</p>

<p>He said: "Do you know that your father's afraid of Boston
Bill?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. She looked long at him, something half formed
on her lips. He saw caution hold her back. Then she said: "So am
I."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; TURN OF THE SCREW</h2>

<p class="first">HE said: "What's to be afraid of?"</p>

<p>Virginia looked over her shoulder to the door; and turned to it.
She stepped into the yard, and stepped back, coming toward him
again. The big lamp on the table threw its lush beam against her,
staining the skin at her throat to a smooth butter yellow. Her lips
lay softly together and light points danced in her eyes as they met
his glance. She had smiled only once at him, and then faintly;
distrust and reserve remained always with her. But below that he
saw fullness waiting, and the fullness was a promise and a
temptation to him, bringing on his smile, and when he smiled
recklessness came quickly to his face.</p>

<p>She watched it and understood it and her expression grew smooth
and tight and a disturbed breathing lifted her breasts; her glance
held him and for a moment warmth ran between them, and the
knowledge of a swift and common thought was between them. She
dropped her glance. She murmured: "Who was the woman you were
talking about?"</p>

<p>He had to remember her name. He bent his head to think of it;
her kiss was a better memory than her name. Then he remembered.
"Rosalia Lind."</p>

<p>Her glance was cool and distant. "Gallant of you. She's a friend
of yours?"</p>

<p>"Just ran into her."</p>

<p>"As you ran into me," she murmured, and was displeased with
him.</p>

<p>"What's the difference of all this?" he said. "The day comes and
the day goes and you'll forget you ever saw me in another
week."</p>

<p>The roughness of his talk brought a break of surprise to her
face; it arrested her interest, and she watched him again with a
close, wondering attention. "Are there no honest men left in this
world?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Honesty is common enough. Is that what you're lookin' for?"</p>

<p>"More than that, perhaps. A man should be . . ." She shrugged
the rest of it away.</p>

<p>He said: "You ride alone too much."</p>

<p>Surprise showed on her face again. "How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"The thinkin' that comes from ridin' alone takes you into a lot
of queer places."</p>

<p>"Not queer," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Better not to think," he said. "Nothing's as good as we
think."</p>

<p>"I'm disappointed in you," she said, and then corrected herself.
"No, not disappointed. I hadn't expected much. All stray riders are
the same."</p>

<p>He said: "What are you afraid of?"</p>

<p>"I think," she told him, "you know enough about Boston Bill to
take care of yourself. He warned you. You probably know enough
about any of these riding bums to watch them wherever you are.
You've probably spent your life with them."</p>

<p>He said: "You can ease off with the spurs."</p>

<p>She had her own temper. He saw it come to her face and lips; he
saw her eyes narrow and lose warmth. She said: "That is the only
way to handle your kind. These hills are dangerous. I know that.
I've had to carry a gun whenever I ride. Why should I take you for
anything better? But it isn't what I wanted to tell you. You're on
Sun Ranch. My father is hospitable in his own way, but I wouldn't
want his hospitality to fool you. If he should ever become
convinced that you came here to betray him or to betray any of the
crew, he'd never give you a chance to explain. You would be shot
without any warning. That has happened here."</p>

<p>He said: "I'll be gone from Sun Ranch after breakfast."</p>

<p>She said nothing at the moment. Turning, she went to the door
again and stood there, facing the shadows. He watched her profile,
he noticed the curve of her shoulders and the rich yellow gleaming
of her hair. She had been angry with him, she was cool and
suspicious now; even so, the shape of her lips and the lovely
turnings of her body and the melody of her voice made a cover for
the heat and the dreaming and the rich longings of a woman. She
faced into the night, and spoke to him from that position.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I want you to stay."</p>

<p>"Why? What's one saddle bum more or less?"</p>

<p>"Stay and find out," she said and turned back to him. "Unless
the threat Boston Bill made is enough to send you away."</p>

<p>He smiled, and then he laughed and she watched him with her eyes
half-closed. She was still prying into him for his worth and his
real character. He said: "I wouldn't run because he wanted me to,
and I wouldn't stay because you used him to get at my pride. But
I'll stay for my own reasons."</p>

<p>She showed relief; and then relief faded and she grew brisk with
him. "Never let your reasons out. The bunkhouse is just across the
yard. Throw your horse into the small pasture behind the bunkhouse.
What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Frank," he said. "That last man who left here&mdash;what's his
name?"</p>

<p>"Mac," she told him. "Probably borrowed, like yours." She came
over the room to him, looking up. She came near enough to be
touched, and he wanted to touch her&mdash;for her nearness
sharpened all his longfelt hungers and the sight of her struck
through him&mdash;the fair things he saw and the warm things he
felt in her. He held himself still, meeting her eyes. They were
cool and speculative; they knew him and they were puzzled with him.
She said, very softly: "Are Rosalia's lips as soft as other
women's?"</p>

<p>He felt the quick heat in his face. She had thrown him off
balance, as she had been trying to do since the meeting on the
road. It turned him angry, but he held himself in. "I've wondered
about yours," he said.</p>

<p>"You'll never find out," she said and suddenly swung from him.
At the door she paused to say: "But it was nice of you not to speak
of Rosalia. Some men do not even have that much decency." Then she
left the dining room in a way that made him feel her spirits had
lifted.</p>

<p>He turned down the lamp and went into the yard, seeing Overman
and his daughter on the porch. Dust still lay in the air, stirred
up by the departure of Boston Bill and his partners; starlight was
a cloudy glow all down the heavens' slopes to the horizons. He took
his horse to the small pasture, unsaddled and carried his gear back
to the bunkhouse; when he stepped inside he saw Theo McSween
sitting at the table, his hands idle on a deck of cards. McSween
faced the door watchfully. Three other men lay on the bunks, awake
and interested. One of them was Carruth, one was Slab, the fellow
with the pock-marked face who had been bait in the Sherman City
fight, and one was new to him. There had been still another in the
dining room, lined up with these. He had gone.</p>

<p>Goodnight pegged his gear and found a bunk. He sat on the bunk,
crouched over while he rolled a smoke, feeling the eyes of the
others lying steadily against him. They were all the same kind of
fugitive men, and they feared him or distrusted him. When he
lighted the cigarette he saw McSween's steady, light-colored stare.
McSween's arms were idle on the table and he had pulled himself
back in the chair, slightly away from the table, He had dark hair
turned white at the edges and he had the kind of face that would
catch a woman's interest and perhaps the kind of tongue that could
softly play on a woman's weaknesses.</p>

<p>McSween said&mdash;and his voice was slow and weighted with
curiosity: "You ever around Tempe, Arizona?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said McSween, "it was up in the Horse Heaven
country."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>McSween caught at his tobacco pouch in his pockets and began to
build a smoke. His fingers were small for a riding man; his clothes
were clean and he kept his hair cut and his face well- shaved; he
was a fancy Dan. He put a match to his smoke and drew in a long
breath of smoke. But he was still disturbed and now said: "Maybe
over in Harney County, Oregon."</p>

<p>"You never saw me there," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Well, by God, I've seen you somewhere."</p>

<p>"You're a damned fool for talk," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>McSween blew out a gust of smoke behind which his light-blue
eyes showed a sparkling resentment. He had small-cut lips, he wore
his sideburns long and his dark hair had a heavy wave. Goodnight
stared at him steadily, remembering his sister, his sister's voice
and his sister's impulsive love of things that were light and gay
and human. She had been a clean girl, and this man had dragged her
through mud. This man had charmed her as he had no doubt charmed
many another girl; he had done it as coolly as he would have set
about breaking a horse.</p>

<p>He never took his eyes from McSween as he thought of it. His
sister must have known the truth about this man before the end.
Somewhere along the dismal trail, sleeping in sheep camps, drifting
through rain, the dream in her must have died by the time they
reached the Nevada town. When it died, her pride and her hope and
her desire to live had likewise died. The doctor had been kind
enough to call it pneumonia. Goodnight rubbed his big hands
together, made hollow by the torture of his thinking; and the fury
and the need of vengeance which had burned away so much of his
youth during these last weeks of pursuit now came up to his face.
The destruction of McSween was the only object he now had, the only
thing he wanted out of life. Here the man stood, yet as much as he
wanted to destroy McSween he knew so swift an ending would leave
him unsatisfied. This man had to suffer and squirm and sweat and
cry before he died. He faced Goodnight as a man whose evils had
never left a mark on him, careless and arrogant and without
remorse. That had to be beaten out of him until he was a cringing
shape filled with fear, until he flinched at the sound of a voice
and begged like a dog for food and water and the very right to
live. This thinking took a hungry, cruel shape on Goodnight's
mouth. McSween saw it and rose and kicked back his chair. He gave
Goodnight a strange stare.</p>

<p>"What you lookin' at me like that for?"</p>

<p>"Ask me any more fool questions and I'll slap out your teeth,"
said Goodnight.</p>

<p>He stood up from the bunk; he took a step nearer the table,
watching McSween's face grow firmer and show a decision. McSween
even grinned. "Boy," he said, "you're talkin' to the wrong man. If
you want trouble with me you can get it."</p>

<p>He was ready to fight, but he was puzzled and so stood still.
Goodnight took another step, suddenly seized the edge of the table
and tipped it against McSween. McSween dropped his hands to knock
the table aside. Goodnight circled swiftly, hit McSween a great
blow on the side of the jaw and knocked him to the floor. He saw
McSween roll and turn and grab at his gun; he had expected it and
now he stepped on McSween's wrist and bore his full weight down,
the sharp boot heel grinding into McSween's skin. McSween gave out
a yell and rolled against Goodnight's knee. Goodnight dropped his
knees straight down on McSween's ribs, seized the gun and rose
back, waiting.</p>

<p>He looked around him at the other three men solemnly watching
all this from their bunks. They were wild ones and they wouldn't
interfere; they were the kind who had long ago learned not to mix
in another man's business. They were probably enjoying the fight.
He watched McSween rise from the floor. McSween said, "You like
rough stuff, boy? Here's some . . ."</p>

<p>He came at Goodnight from a low, bent-over crouch, springing
suddenly at his hips with his reached-out arms. Goodnight let him
close in, took one step nearer as McSween's arms seized him and
then, before McSween came out of his crouch, brought his knee full
up into McSween's lowered face. The crack of that knee on McSween's
mouth was sharp in the room. McSween's arms fell away and he
dropped on his hands and knees. He never fully collapsed. He held
himself painfully off the floor and some memory of other fights
made him hunch himself together to protect his vital spots while
half-unconscious. He shook his head and lifted it and cautiously
searched the room with his glance. When he located Goodnight near
the door he caught hold of the nearest bunk and pulled himself
upright.</p>

<p>Goodnight's knee had smashed his lips into his teeth, drawing
blood, and Goodnight's boot heel had badly sprung his wrist. He
stood uncertainly erect, drawing heavily for wind, shaking his head
free of dizziness. He rubbed the back of a hand over his mouth and
stared at the blood drawn away. He spoke without much feeling,
tired but still not beaten.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know where I've seen you before. Then I'd know what
all this was."</p>

<p>"Stick around and you'll find out, maybe."</p>

<p>McSween gave him a tough glance. "You don't think I'm goin' to
run from you?"</p>

<p>"You'll try to run," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"The hell I will," grunted McSween. "I'll stay long enough to
crack your skull." He sat down on the edge of his bunk and started
to pull off his boots.</p>

<p>Goodnight pointed a finger at him. "Find yourself another bunk.
I'm sleepin' in that one."</p>

<p>McSween dropped his feet to the floor. Half humped over, he
threw a malign stare at Goodnight; he hadn't been humbled, he
hadn't been made afraid. He still wanted to get at Goodnight, but
knew he couldn't. He drew back his broken lips, like a dog
growling. He pulled himself together and got up and moved to the
other end of the room. He stopped at a wall mirror and saw his
face. It shocked him. He touched his lips with a point of a finger;
he turned on Goodnight. "Damn you, you've scarred me."</p>

<p>"Tough," said Goodnight. "Be harder for you to attract the
ladies."</p>

<p>McSween stood silent, thinking of that. The words stirred
something and he straightened and looked at Goodnight with a
sharper attention, still seeking to identify him. Recognition
didn't come and, turning around, he crawled into another bunk and
lay face upward, gently groaning. The three other men, Goodnight
observed, were watching the door; swinging around, Goodnight
observed Virginia Overman looking in from the yard.</p>

<p>"A bunkhouse," said Goodnight, "is no place for a woman. You
know that."</p>

<p>She had been watching part of the fight; the expression of
dislike was in her eyes as she looked at him. Then she turned into
the night.</p>

<p>Goodnight wheeled to Bob Carruth. "No hard feelings about that
crack over the head?"</p>

<p>"We'll wait and see," said Carruth.</p>

<p>"Where's the other man&mdash;the other one that stood by you in
the dinin' room?"</p>

<p>"He left," said Carruth.</p>

<p>"Your boss," said Goodnight, "came to town with a big outfit.
Where's the rest of the crew now?"</p>

<p>"You're lookin' at all the crew he's got," said Carruth. "The
little party in Sherman City was too warm for the others. They just
faded over the hill this mornin'."</p>

<p>"Ide outguessed you. Or maybe your intentions leaked out."</p>

<p>"So we discovered," said Bob Carruth. "Sure strange how news
gets around."</p>

<p>Goodnight removed his boots and his pants. He hung his gun at
the corner of the bunk and he rested back. He said: "Mac, go blow
out the light." He waited and heard nothing. He let the silence
pile up, and spoke softly, "Better mind."</p>

<p>McSween dragged himself off his bunk and stood in the room's
center, looking down at Goodnight. For the present, his vitality
was gone and he had nothing particular on his face. It was blank,
as though he had wakened from a hard sleep. He said nothing, but
turned and extinguished the lamp by sweeping his cupped hand across
the chimney. Goodnight heard him roll back into his bunk, and in
the darkness, never trusting McSween, he reached to his holster and
lifted his gun and put it under the straw.</p>

<p><br>
Virginia Overman crossed the yard to the main house and found her
father sitting in a corner chair, plunged in his odd thoughts. He
had his hands on his lap, palms upward; his chin lay dropped on his
breast and she stood silent and watched him for a full minute and
realized he was unaware of her presence.</p>

<p>"Dad," she said, calling him back from the distance. "That man
may stay."</p>

<p>He lifted his head. "He would be useful."</p>

<p>"Any man would be useful," she said. "Bob and Tap and Slab and
Mac are not enough. We might have kept the other five a long while
if you hadn't tried to raid Sherman City."</p>

<p>"I will always fight evil," said Overman.</p>

<p>"Nothing good came of it. One of our boys was killed and four
more ran away, fearing what Ide might do to us."</p>

<p>"They ran out of weakness. Let them run."</p>

<p>"It leaves us stripped."</p>

<p>"We have friends."</p>

<p>"Don't trust Bill too far."</p>

<p>"Why do you think this new man will stay?"</p>

<p>She walked a slow circle around the room, tall and calm and
confident. She had gray eyes, after her father. She stopped near
the doorway of her bedroom. She said: "I think I know how to make
him stay."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; FIRST WARNING</h2>

<p class="first">GOODNIGHT ate breakfast in the dining room with
the crew and with Overman and Virginia. When he finished, he moved
at once into the mountain's bright light, into its thin and winey
air. The rest of the crew crossed the yard and were soon in saddle,
moving into the trees, downgrade. McSween went with the group and
for a short moment Goodnight's thoughts ran fast and uncertain. If
McSween kept on going it would be another weary search to catch him
again, but presently he made up his mind and turned away. McSween's
pride would not let him run. McSween would return.</p>

<p>Virginia came out of the dining room and saw him. She said,
"Saddle up and ride with me," and went on. Goodnight returned to
the bunkhouse for his gear and continued to the small meadow. His
horse ranged down-pasture with half a dozen others but when he
drummed up a signal on the gate post with the flat of his hand, the
horse came out of the bunch to him. He saddled and stepped aboard;
and he sat through his morning exercise, the horse bucking in short
stiff-legged hops, because of the goodness of the day. When
Goodnight got back to the main yard the girl was waiting for him,
and set out with him across the short mountain meadow. A road split
the meadow and presently reached timber. They passed into the cool
morning twilight, going steadily upgrade.</p>

<p>"Where's this road go?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Over the mountains. The way you'll be going, I suppose. On
east."</p>

<p>"Maybe," he said.</p>

<p>She sat square on her saddle, not looking at him. "I have had a
hard time getting men to stay on this ranch. Keep your hands off
Mac. I need him. Don't drive him away." Then she turned her head
and he saw the dislike she had for him. "You're like the rest of
them, lawless and on the jump. You are also brutal."</p>

<p>"This a way of giving me my walkin' papers?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I want you to stay. I have no choice."</p>

<p>The two horses walked sedately side by side as the road looped
between green walls of timber. Now and then Goodnight sighted the
dark shoulders of granite peaks south of the road; and now and then
they came upon gravel fords over which clear and sparkling creek
waters shallowly rushed. It occurred to him that this was the
second time Virginia Overman had let drop the hint of her worry and
her insecurity; and so he asked the same question he had asked the
night before.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself can't you?" She looked at him, her
dislike thawing. He had the idea that she wanted to trust him and
could not. She placed him as she placed the other men in these
hills, just one more rider with a dishonorable past. In addition
she thought him cruel; that latter judgment bothered him, for
sometimes on the long march to this point he had wondered at his
own newly acquired bitterness, his terrible judgments of all things
and all men. Life had ceased to be the same. He woke no more with
the keen, fine eagerness of morning upon him, he rode no more with
the old free spirit, and at night the heart of his campfire burned
dull, its mystery gone.</p>

<p>She had waited for his answer. Not receiving it, she murmured:
"You're a gloomy cold man." Then she bent a little in the saddle,
her glance nearer to him, and she was a moment silent. "Why," she
said, "what troubles you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe you'd better not ask," he said.</p>

<p>"Running away," she said in a smaller voice, "is a miserable
thing. You'll find out you can never run far enough." She shrugged
her shoulders. "Never mind. It is your business. You can see what's
happening on Sun Ranch, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Your father seems to know what he's doing."</p>

<p>"My father never came here with the intention of setting up
headquarters for the wild bunch. He ran his cattle and minded his
business until about ten years ago. Then the desert outfits began
to resent his being here, because he used the grass they'd been
summer-ranging. They tried to run him out. You have seen my father.
You know how he would answer. It has been a fight ever since my
childhood. The hill people against Harry Ide and the other desert
ranchers. My father hates all desert people and would willingly
wipe them out. He is unforgiving. Perhaps he has reason to be. I
have no love for the desert ranchers. They're greedy."</p>

<p>"All people are greedy, one way or another," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>She gave him a keen glance, arrested by the remark. "I wonder
how deep your resentment is. You don't have the face of a lawless
man. It isn't lined with evil or dissipation. Are you sure you are
as disillusioned as you think?"</p>

<p>"Shouldn't matter to you."</p>

<p>"It does, very much," she told him in a completely matter-of-
fact voice. "I do not admire your actions&mdash;such as I've seen
of them&mdash;but I need a man like you. This country has become a
jungle in which all sorts of stray and vicious beasts have sought
shelter. It used to be a lovely country. All through my childhood
it was a land of delight. The shadows were clean shadows, made by
the mountains and the timber. It is not so now. I used to travel
this road, never thinking of danger. I never ride on it any more
without a gun, always expecting the worst from each bend. It is a
terrible thing to do that to so clean a spot of earth."</p>

<p>"You were young and never saw the evil which is always around
us. Now you're older and you see it."</p>

<p>She looked at him. "Do you like to think of it that way? Don't
you want to fight it?"</p>

<p>He said: "I'll take care of my chores but no other man's."</p>

<p>She showed him the disappointment and the faint contempt she had
earlier revealed; and again he felt it keenly. She said: "I should
have expected nothing more from you. Yet I need you. My father is
in trouble."</p>

<p>"You want another gun to throw against the desert," he guessed.
"Therefore you are mixed up in the evil you've been talkin'
against."</p>

<p>"As long as my father fought to protect himself against the
desert people he was doing what had to be done. They have tried to
drive him away, but he has outfought them. I'm glad of that, for
they've been wrong and lawless about it. Now it is worse. The
feeling is so bad between hill and desert that nobody regards any
kind of an act to be wrong. My father has taken his help where he
found it. Much of that help has come from the wild bunch, which has
grown powerful enough to control the hills. The hill ranchers
fought to keep back the desert crowd. Now they've got a worse
danger in the wild bunch. Some of them know it. My father is
troubled, though he doesn't tell me. He used to be very honest and
very strict. The wild bunch has taught him to think anything is
fair against the desert crowd."</p>

<p>"Boston Bill?"</p>

<p>She turned in the saddle toward him. When she spoke again he
noticed she did not directly answer his question. "The wild bunch
has corrupted some of us; the rest of us it has made afraid." She
stopped her horse, turned it and started back. "I should not have
trusted you with this. You're the same as the rest."</p>

<p>"Then why did you?" asked Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Maybe," she said, "it was something I thought I saw."</p>

<p>He rode downgrade in silence, her talk working through him. Her
judgment of him was a slow acid burning his conscience and her hope
in him waked those old easy and straightforward and simple things
he had since put away. He was a different man, embittered by
injustice, and he knew it and could do nothing about it; yet the
recollection of what he had once been would not leave him.</p>

<p>"You should trust no man," he said. "You should not have trusted
me."</p>

<p>She glanced at him, She said nothing but her attention
thoughtfully remained upon him. Presently she straightened and when
he looked at her he saw that she was quietly smiling. She put her
hand on his arm and coquetry danced in her eyes; it was a charm
suddenly turned on. She said: "Stay and help me," and spurred her
horse into a reaching canter. He followed her down the road to the
meadow and along the meadow to the yard, puzzled at the change of
her manner but warmed by it. As he came into the yard with her he
saw Overman, Boston Bill and a third man waiting by the porch. The
third man was the old fellow who had been in the alley beside
Rosalia Lind's house the previous night. Old Gabe.</p>

<p>He dismounted, turned cautious; he saw the jealous suspicion in
Boston Bill's blue eyes, he felt the massive temper of old Hugh
boil against him. Overman said: "Daughter, I have spoken to you of
riding with strangers." Boston Bill's eyes went to her with
curiosity, and came again to Goodnight, bold and discontented.</p>

<p>Old Gabe reached into his pocket and produced a slip of paper
which he handed to Goodnight. Three neat feminine lines of writing
said:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">Your friend has been hurt and is in my house.<br>
Come to the back door after dark&mdash;down the alley<br>
where the old man was.</p>
<br>

<p>The second sentence was to take the place of the signature, to
remind him secretly of Rosalia Lind. He stood with his head bent,
troubled as to Niles, doubting the message and the messenger. How
had this man come so openly upon Sun Ranch and how was it he stood
here now with so much certainty? The three men were watching him
with their various attitudes. Virginia regarded him with a
noticeable distrust.</p>

<p>He pointed to the messenger and spoke to Overman. "You know this
man?"</p>

<p>"I know him," said Overman.</p>

<p>The old man grinned his red-gummed grin. "Everybody knows me,"
he said. "And," he added shyly, "nobody cares about me. If anybody
cared I'd be dead before now. It's the little folks that ain't
worth botherin' about and never amount to nothin' who outlast the
folks that try to run everything. Us no-accounts own this world and
get the fun of it. You got an answer fur that writin'?"</p>

<p>"I'll carry my own answer down."</p>

<p>The old man turned to his horse. He gave the group an insolent
grin from the saddle, knowing his age sheltered him. "Never knowed
a heavy gambler ever to win. You're all bound to lose. You're
livin' like fools." He turned his horse about and went away
confidently, lumped like a squaw in the saddle, his old legs
banging the sides of the horse; and so disappeared in the
timber.</p>

<p>This scene and the delivery of the note seemed neither to have
increased nor decreased Overman's suspicion; it had not changed his
judgment. But Boston Bill had been touched on some vulnerable nerve
by the scene and held himself still with difficulty. Goodnight
folded the note and slid it into his pocket, not entirely sure of
the next few moments. He said: "I've got to go to town," and turned
to his horse. The silence of the three people was oppressive behind
him and when he swung to the leather and again faced them he
realized that all three were debating his departure. A clear, cold
antagonism had returned to the girl's face.</p>

<p>"Are you coming back?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Boston Bill gave Virginia a blank look. "Why should he come
back?"</p>

<p>"We can use another pair of hands."</p>

<p>"You've got plenty to call on," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"Sun Ranch hires its own crew, Bill."</p>

<p>"So far we've gotten along," he said. "I'm here when you want
me."</p>

<p>She lifted her head, she straightened and laid her voice on him,
even and definite. "Don't interfere."</p>

<p>Boston Bill flushed. He still had his anger and wanted to use
it. But he was somehow held back, as though he desired no quarrel
with her; and at last he managed a graceful gesture. "Only trying
to help. After all, what do you know of this man?" He swung on
Overman as he asked the question. Overman, Goodnight observed, was
solemn and aloof and would not come into the argument. Goodnight
knew then he would have no protest on his departure and swung
around toward the meadow. Boston Bill's voice followed him: "I'll
ride with you, friend," and in a moment Bill trotted abreast.
Looking behind, Goodnight saw the girl poised watchfully in the
middle of the yard.</p>

<p>The two men passed shortly into trees, dropping downgrade.
Goodnight looked at Boston Bill. "Get it off your chest."</p>

<p>"What takes you to town?"</p>

<p>"That's my business."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;sure," said Boston Bill, resentment singing in his
voice. "My friend, I misjudged you yesterday. I figured you for one
more bum. I see now you're able to take care of yourself. That's
perfectly agreeable to me, but I just want to make sure you stay
out of my business. You do that much and I'll keep clear of
you."</p>

<p>"Say the rest of it," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>Boston Bill gave Goodnight the benefit of his hard blue eyes.
"The rest of it is that you've been bumping into me and I have not
called you. Thereby you may be figuring me wrong. I don't believe
you know my style. I'm not one to go harum-scarum into a fight. I
never fight except for a purpose. So far you have not really
provided me with a purpose. If you ever do I shall certainly fight
you."</p>

<p>"You could have said it in less time," observed Goodnight.</p>

<p>Boston Bill showed him a thin smile. "You have never run into a
man like me and therefore you constantly make mistakes. These
drifters around here are dogs without brains. They fight out of
pride, nothing more. Any man with a brain can handle them. You're
the first one I feel is anywhere near me in intelligence. Therefore
you may be dangerous to me and I may be dangerous to you. These are
big hills. There's room enough for both of us. But keep out of my
pasture."</p>

<p>"Where's that?" asked Goodnight.</p>

<p>Boston Bill rode on the best part of a quarter mile before he
gave Goodnight a hard, fresh grin and a knowing glance. "You're not
bad at pumping out what you want to know. I don't believe I shall
give you the ground plan of my venture, old boy. I simply say,
don't interfere with me. And, look here, there are other hill
ranches to work on, if you must stay and work. I suggest you leave
the Sun outfit."</p>

<p>"I'll be going back there," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"I hold your future in the palm of my hand," pointed out Boston
Bill reasonably. "If I ever swung the old man against you, you'd
never live to leave the place."</p>

<p>"You've tried," said Goodnight, "and no luck."</p>

<p>Boston Bill halted his horse and swung it, directly facing
Goodnight. He was alert and was angry, but he continued his cool
way of handling Goodnight; his mind controlled his temper. This
man, Goodnight understood, was not the kind of fighter and not the
kind of simple bad one with which he was familiar. Looking into the
man's eyes Goodnight had an odd feeling that he saw there in the
coolness and the brightness the dull shadow of something ruined and
dying. This man had an education and came from a good place; but he
was here now, far below his station, somehow corrupted. That shadow
of dullness was a real thing, the reflection of inward shame. There
was never anything as wicked as a good horse turned bad, or a good
man turned bad.</p>

<p>He said to Boston Bill, gravely, with deliberation: "Only one
thing I'm not sure of about you. Whether you'd give a man warning
or crack him from behind."</p>

<p>Boston Bill's ruddy cheeks showed a sharper color at once and
the anger in him slipped its control and shaped his face with
arrogance. He searched for an answer to that charge but apparently
the streak of fatalism in him knocked the answer aside. Turning, he
rode back toward the ranch.</p>

<p>When he reached the yard he went directly to the house. Virginia
was in the room but old Hugh had gone back to his bedroom for his
customary nap. Boston Bill watched Virginia closely, his smile
coming short and pressed around his mouth. A little flash of
excitement showed on his face and he ducked his head toward the old
man's room, murmuring: "In there?"</p>

<p>She nodded. She stood by the table, her hands on it. She looked
down at her hands and he was sharp-eyed enough to notice that her
heart struck sharp against her wrist. She lifted her head and gave
him a rapid side glance and turned, moving toward the end of the
room. The main door stood open. Boston Bill swung and closed it and
he waited a moment, staring across the width of the room at her;
and then he thought he saw his invitation and went to her. He
looked down at her a moment; he waited for her glance to come up to
him, with its shadowing, its disturbance. He touched her with one
hand, lightly, and let it rest tentatively a moment, and then held
her with both hands and pulled her forward. He let his mouth drop
gently to her lips, but that was the end of his gentleness, for the
effect of her closeness completely threw him off balance and he
tightened his grasp around her waist and bore down insistently with
his mouth.</p>

<p>She was willing to have it that way. He felt her fingers dig
into his back and he felt her own desires rush at him. He thought:
"She's hungry for this&mdash;I could have done it sooner," and the
next moment her hands slid against his chest and pushed him away.
Her eyes were darker and wider and her mouth had become heavy. She
breathed rapidly, she held her palms up, protecting herself, still
pushing at him, and a violent dislike jumped into her face and
pulled it tight. She shook her head. She motioned at her father's
door and shook her head again. When he reached for her, still
unsatisfied, she knocked his arms aside. "All right&mdash;all
right," he grumbled, and swung on his heels, leaving the room.</p>

<p>She listened to him ride away, She rubbed a hand across her
mouth, she tucked in the edges of her hair and felt pleased with
herself, knowing she had broken through his guard. She had meant to
let him have his kiss, realizing he had long wanted it; she had not
meant to let him have enough to be too confident. He was an
overbearing man, a difficult one to keep in hand. She distrusted
him and sometimes hated him because he felt himself stronger than
she. She wanted to break him and make him manageable, and yet could
not do so. Still, this had not gone badly. That single kiss had put
a rope around him and he would be tantalized by it and would come
back, and would try to please her.</p>

<p>She stood this way, analyzing him, and presently she began to
compare him with Goodnight. They were both difficult men to handle
but she thought, of Goodnight: "I can make him want me, too."</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; DEATH AT NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">GOODNIGHT left Sun Ranch around ten o'clock.
Running downgrade, now on the road and now in the shelter of the
timber, he reached the break of the hills&mdash;with the housetops
of Sherman City below him&mdash;near four. It was still three hours
until sundown and although the message from Rosalia Lind was urgent
enough to make him restless, he could not shake away his suspicion;
therefore he made a wide detour to avoid entering town from the
upper side and presently cut the road which led out upon the
prairie. Dropping back to the trees he sat against a pine until the
sun fell and the shadows began their inward night-tide. He rose and
crossed the road, coming upon. Sherman City from the lower end.
Reaching the old shanty where he had met Niles the night before, he
left his horse and walked behind the line of buildings.</p>

<p>He came to the rear of Rosalia Lind's house and he stood well
covered by the darkness of the house adjoining. A light came
through her window and painted its dim yellow cone on the muddy
night. Beyond the reach of that cone lay the back ends of other
buildings, undressed and unlovely; and bleak alleyways and
between-building spaces promising trouble. He did not trust the old
man's message and he did not trust Rosalia Lind. This town and this
country lived in its own evil. He stood still, watching the lighted
windows, and then he noticed that the back door of the house stood
open and as he watched this, the light went out; and he heard a
voice grumble: "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>It sounded like Niles Brand's voice. He moved through the yard
toward the door; he came soft-footed across the small back porch
and found a shape in the doorway. He took one step aside, still
keyed to danger, and then he saw Rosalia's face move forward. She
whispered something under her breath and her hand reached to him
and drew him in. There was a complete darkness in the house, and
the sound of a man's heavy breathing, and then he heard Niles speak
again. "Where'd you go to?"</p>

<p>She still held Goodnight's arm, the pressure of her fingers
speaking for her and her presence sending its warmth against him.
She waited there, saying nothing, arresting him with the unseen
sweetness that came so powerfully out of her. He put his arms
around her and felt her lips come up quick and eager. It was like
falling into softness, through layer upon layer of softness, all of
it closing about him warm and painfully good. The feeling of it was
a sustained wave through him, this same goodness without shame; and
when he stepped back he heard her let out a small sigh and he
thought she was smiling although he saw nothing of her face. Her
finger tips brushed across his lips and she swayed until she was
against him again, whispering into his ear. "I've been waiting for
you." She pulled away and in a moment found a match and lighted a
lamp.</p>

<p>He closed the rear door, standing against it, watching her go
about the room to pull down the window shades. She faced him over
the room's length; he saw happiness shape her lips, he saw the glow
of her eyes as she watched him and remembered the kiss. Light and
shadows lay against her, darkening her eyes, rounding her shape.
Her lips moved slightly, speaking to him without sound, and she
turned lovely and alive before him. She moved her head at the open
door of another room. "In there."</p>

<p>It was a bedroom, with Niles Brand lying on the bed, bare from
his waist upward. A harness of cloth, looped around his neck and
around his chest, anchored a bandage against his left side. He had
one arm thrown back over his head, grasping the bed post. He said
to Goodnight, "Nice weather, pilgrim," and tried to grin away the
hurt of his injury. Sweat lay beaded along his head and upper lip
and the day's heat, trapped within the house, flushed his face to a
cherry color.</p>

<p>"Bullet?" asked Goodnight. "Where'd it land? Who did it?"</p>

<p>"Shaved a rib, or broke a rib&mdash;or somethin' like that. I
was crossin' the street from the stable. The thing plowed downward
across my flank. So it was fired from above me. I was facin' the
hotel. So it came from the hotel, second floor. That's all I know
about it. I told you this was a damned queer town. This girl and an
old guy with whiskers pulled me off the street." He looked at her.
"What did you bother for?"</p>

<p>She stood by the bed, her manner of dark assurance returning.
"You're this man's friend, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"That's the reason?" he asked, in a puzzled tone; and he looked
at her close and careful. She was a mystery to him, not smiling at
him and making no attempt to please him. She had helped him, but
the help was not for him. He saw that and shrugged his shoulders,
and the shrug brought on a fresh stab of agony in his side. He
bared his teeth and gripped the bed post more tightly. "Give me two
or three days, Frank. But meanwhile, where do I hang out?"</p>

<p>"Here," said the girl. "You're safe here. Nobody would dare
touch you in my house."</p>

<p>"You big enough to hold 'em away?"</p>

<p>She showed both men a lift of her chin and an imperious gesture
with her hand. "You're safe here."</p>

<p>Goodnight said: "No reason for you to be potted, Niles, unless
somebody knows you are tied up with me."</p>

<p>"That was known half an hour after you came," said the girl.</p>

<p>Niles gave her a bright-sharp stare. "You got your fingers on a
lot of things."</p>

<p>"Two men riding into Sherman City, a day apart, would be
suspected. This place is full of men who know all the tricks. You
couldn't fool them. I know who shot you. I know why. I know more
than that. You stay here until you can take care of yourself. It
will be a week, and not two or three days."</p>

<p>Goodnight said: "If you're safe here, I'll have to duck back
into the hills."</p>

<p>"You find out anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Goodnight. "It's only a question of time."</p>

<p>Niles said in a gritty voice: "Do it and be done with it."</p>

<p>The girl stepped from the room, both men listening to her
footsteps recede toward the rear of the house. Goodnight bent down,
murmuring: "He's on Sun Ranch. He won't run. I'm going back there.
When you're ready to ride, ride back home."</p>

<p>"You damned fool," said Niles, "you think you can get out of
here alone? We're both in trouble. I don't think we could ride out
if we wanted. It's&mdash;" he scowled at the ceiling, seeking
words, and added, "just too many things workin' too many funny
ways."</p>

<p>The girl came back with a drink of water. She stood over him,
supporting the glass while he drank. Water spilled down his bare
chest and he squirmed on the bed and tried to smile again.
"Remember how a cow tries to get out of quicksand, Frank? Same
thing. We're in quicksand. Maybe you could turn down that light.
Believe I might be able to sleep. Sorry I got your bed, lady."</p>

<p>She took up the lamp and moved from the room with it, Goodnight
behind her. She put the lamp on a table, turned down the wick, and
swung to face him; all her austere self-possession went away in
that one moment, leaving her a beggar waiting his nod, his word,
his summons. Heat lay heavy in the house, swelling through him; he
dropped his head, thinking of the suddenness of their meeting and
the rashness of his first impulse toward her. And he wondered now
at the strange things she did to him, making the moments sharp and
all his appetites keen. She brought him back to his older days of
carefree thinking, when all the world had been good. She brought
that back.</p>

<p>She came across the room, touching his arm, moving with him back
through the house and out to the rear porch. She sat down in the
deep shadows, pulling him beside her. Her voice dropped low.
"You're safe on this porch, Frank. There are three men in those
shadows. Nobody could get into this back yard."</p>

<p>"I got in."</p>

<p>"You were permitted in," she told him softly.</p>

<p>"Odd thing."</p>

<p>"Not odd. My father started this town and left many friends when
he died. You're walking on my ground, anywhere you walk in Sherman
City. I have men who'd never let you leave here, if I said so.
Perhaps&mdash;" and her voice held its secret amusement&mdash;"I'll
have them keep you here. What are you going to do now?"</p>

<p>"Back into the hills."</p>

<p>She remained silent over a long period, bent forward, her arms
across her knees. She looked into the darkness, indrawn and sober.
When she spoke again there was a drag of sadness in her voice. "I
do not know what brings you here and I don't know what you want.
Men do things for so many reasons and some of those reasons are
foolish. But they are men's reasons. I never question them. If I
like a man I'll help him, whatever he wants, and no matter what
kind of a man he's been."</p>

<p>"Don't trust me," he told her.</p>

<p>"That is a silly thing to say. If I didn't like you I'd let you
die and not care at all. But if I like you I'll trust you. How else
can people live? This is a lonely town for a woman. I've seen men
come and go. Now and then I see one I like. Sometimes I've
attracted their attention, and then found nothing I've wanted."</p>

<p>"Better be careful of |he kind of men floating through
here."</p>

<p>"Listen to me. I'm not afraid of fugitives or wild ones. All I
ask of a man is that, bad as he is, he has something in his heart,
and be simply a man. I would overlook everything else. Even a life
of sleeping in the rain from pillar to post. I don't like cautious
men, or smart ones, or careful ones. Just plain ones who are what
men are supposed to be, nothing more. Don't go back into the
hills."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You don't want to be in this quarrel."</p>

<p>"I'm not in it."</p>

<p>"Go back to the hills and you'll be in it. You can't stay
out."</p>

<p>He said nothing and she touched him with her arm, bringing his
face around. He saw her smiling for him. "You won't mind me, which
is the way a man has. All right. But don't go back tonight. This is
the one night you should stay under cover."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Take my word for it."</p>

<p>He was thinking of Theo McSween. He had banked on McSween's
pride, but he was now not sure that McSween wouldn't run. It made
him uneasy and restless to think he might lose his man. "I'll be
back on Sun Ranch by daylight," he said. "But thanks for the
warning."</p>

<p>"Sun Ranch," she said thoughtfully. "That's where Gabe found
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She rose, drawing away from him; and her voice drew away from
him. "Go there and you'll never get out of trouble."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked again.</p>

<p>Her voice stiffened. She had a great deal of pride. "Do as I
tell you. Isn't that enough for you to know?"</p>

<p>He rose and stood close beside her, smiling through the shadows
at her. He denied her authority over him with a smooth murmur:
"So-long until I see you again."</p>

<p>She hit him with her suppressed irritation: "I got you out of
the hills once. How many more times must I send in a man to pull
you clear of trouble?"</p>

<p>"Is that what you did?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they would have let you leave Sun if it hadn't
been Rosalia Lind's man delivering the message? They knew where
Gabe came from and they knew better than to hold you back. Go up
there now and I'll not lift my hand again."</p>

<p>He was still smiling. He laid his hand under her chin, lifting
it. He bent and kissed her and felt the anger dissolve out of her.
She pulled back from him, staring at his face. "Ah," she sighed,
"how funny. The men I like are all headstrong. Why is that? Do you
hate a woman giving you orders?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I've got to go back. That's all there's to
it."</p>

<p>"Not tonight," she whispered. "Not tonight."</p>

<p>"Be good to Niles."</p>

<p>She said: "I could lift my voice now, and you'd never leave
town."</p>

<p>He ceased to smile. He said: "Don't interfere."</p>

<p>She stared at him a long while, troubled for him and angry with
him and yet drawn to him; and at last she shrugged her shoulders.
"So-long," she said. She watched him swing from the porch and cross
the yard; she watched him disappear in the shadows and she listened
to his footfalls die sudden-out. She drew a long breath and put a
hand on a breast and pressed it tight, and turned into the house.
She heard Niles turning restlessly on the bed and took the lamp
into his room. His eyes turned on her, full of pain and yet
shrewd.</p>

<p>"I heard the argument," he said. "Don't try to change that
fellow. It will do you no good."</p>

<p>"Is he stubborn, Niles?"</p>

<p>Niles rolled on the bed, easing his weight from side to side; he
gripped the bed post and silently struggled through the hard pulse
of his broken flank. "I grew up with him. Everything was fun and
everything was swell. I stayed home and he hit the trail, just for
the hell of it. You know&mdash;a lot of life in him that had to
spill out somewhere. Just shout because you can't keep still when
you feel good. That was Frank, until a few months ago. Now you've
got a tough man on your hands. He's got to go into those hills and
nothin' you say will stop him."</p>

<p>"And nothing," she said, "will keep him from being killed. He
doesn't know those hills as I do."</p>

<p>"Dammit," he groaned, "I wish I could go with him."</p>

<p>"Niles," she said, "I'll help him."</p>

<p>He was sweating and he was flushed and he was restless. She put
down the lamp and went for a glass of water. She sat on the edge of
the bed and supported his head while he drank. Her hand accidently
brushed his bare chest and he showed his instant embarrassment.
"Better if I had my shirt on."</p>

<p>"Never mind."</p>

<p>He looked at her with a moment's penetrating attention. "I don't
quite know about you."</p>

<p>"For you," she said, calmly dismissing the statement, "that
doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"Not thinking about me," he said. "Thinkin' about Frank."</p>

<p>"That's his business, and mine."</p>

<p>"The hell it is. If I don't think it's a good idea, Rosalia,
you'll have to break through me to get at him. I'm tellin' you
that."</p>

<p>She wasn't listening. She rose and took up the lamp, looking
down at him with her thoughts elsewhere. "It will be the girl," she
murmured. "I know the way she'll handle him."</p>

<p>"What girl?"</p>

<p>"If you want anything, I'll be in the next room," she said, and
left him.</p>

<p><br>
Goodnight reached his horse and made the wide circle of town again.
When he got into the timber he traced his way to the main road,
drew slightly aside from it and looked down upon the town's
housetops. The two roads were solid streaks of dust formed into a
cross, glowing silver in the shadows, turned to amber-gold where
the storelights shone upon them. One horse stood sway-backed and
sleepy before the hotel and one man sat in front of the stable;
otherwise the town showed no life. The fact struck him and he
watched the front of both saloons for a matter of five minutes. In
that length of time no man entered or left either place. The hill
people were absent this night, and the desert crowd did not
appear.</p>

<p>He turned back to the road and moved up, now in more of a hurry
than he had been. The thought of Theo McSween left unguarded
disturbed him anew. Moreover, he was aware of Rosalia Lind's
repeated warning: "Don't go into the hills tonight." It was a
signal of things to come which the town, by its emptiness and by
its suppressed quiet, seemed to heed. He thought of Rosalia Lind as
he moved steadily forward at the bottom of this deep black trench
cut out of the timber. The thought of her evoked warmth and
satisfaction and a feeling of something new discovered, making him
eager even as he possessed his doubt. One moment she had been cold
and strange to him and then she had answered his kiss with a swift
rush of willingness, with a desire as great as his own; and he had
felt the receiving softness of her body and the need of her lips. A
woman like that, he thought, so quick to give, so easily
surrendering&mdash;Yet he was ashamed of the thought and would not
listen to its suggestions. What was time? A woman might look coldly
on a man and hold him away even as she desired him, out of a sense
of propriety, and make him come back time and time again until she
had proved her value and her will to him. Another woman might stake
everything on the impulses of her heart. Which was the better
woman&mdash;the cool one who waited her time, the warm one who
suddenly answered? In which one ran the fire, in which lay the
depth?</p>

<p>He was five miles into the hills when he heard the first rumor
of another rider in the night, coming behind. He turned off the
road and waited until the man went by at a punishing pace. He stood
still, realizing that his own dust wake must have been a warning to
that rider; but the rider's echo was a steady abrasion in the
night, presently dying. Goodnight swung back to the road. Starlight
made a trembling glow above the narrow-slashed pathway of the trees
and wind flowed downhill with its faint pressure against him. Near
ten or eleven o'clock he felt the slackness in his horse and
thought of stopping, and would have stopped had not he picked up a
sound to his right, like the gentle, slow scrubbing of knuckles on
a washboard. This was on some other road or trail in the timber
which appeared to slant toward him, for the sound grew greater,
reached a peak not more than three hundred yards from him, and
began to fall off. It was a group of riders pushing hard against
the hills.</p>

<p>A little later he crossed that road as it swept around from the
southwest and intersected the one on which he traveled. He was by
now half the way around Sun Ranch and gave up the idea of camping.
The horse frequently slowed, knowing its own mind; he urged it on,
watching the gray-black foreground of the road with greater
attention. Dust stayed with him to indicate other travel; and the
silence of the hills had in it the tag-end of sounds not quite
faded out and he got the impression of men crisscrossing the dark
mountain slopes with their urgent hastes. Midnight brought him to
the mouth of a canyon somehow familiar and shortly he recognized
his previous night's camp spot, whereby Virginia Overman had met
him; and he was here when he caught the first distant break of
guns.</p>

<p>This was from higher away, from the Sun Ranch meadow; and these
shots grew and came down to him with the small wind, making faint
flutters in the air. He was in the notch of the canyon, the high
round walls holding him strictly to the road. He had half a mile of
this, as he remembered, and urged the flagging horse to a quicker
pace. The firing stayed brisk, not heavy volleys, but as spotted
shots following one another at intervals.</p>

<p>Halfway up the canyon, with a quarter mile still to go before
reaching the shelter of the timber, he heard the firing die into a
silence made hollow by the racket which had gone before; and after
that he caught the on-traveling murmur of horses. He was still
trapped in the canyon and now brought down his spurs, sorry for his
horse as he did so. The horse jumped into a dispirited run, its
shoes striking sharp against the rocky underfooting of the road;
the canyon wall began to drop down. Ahead of him a ragged burst of
shots broke the lull, the last rear-guard action of the fight, and
then that ceased and a heavy party ran at him.</p>

<p>He looked anxiously at the shadow bank to either side and knew
he could not yet climb from the road; nor had he time now to turn
and run, for the head of the oncoming column was a vague motion
before him. Someone in that party shouted "Harry, hold it," but the
column came on at an easy run. Goodnight shoved his horse flat
against the left-hand bank, thus to be absorbed in the black
shadows of it. He heard the man cry again: "I can't make it,
Harry."</p>

<p>The column was dead on him, slacking speed. It ran abreast of
him, the nearest rider within arm's reach. Someone said: "Hold up,"
and the column broke and turned back upon itself; one rider swung
about, his stirrup touching Goodnight's stirrup. "Who's hit? said
that one."</p>

<p>"Me," said a voice in a steady fall of tone. "I can't make it
back. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grab him before he falls," said the voice.</p>

<p>"Come up&mdash;come up," said the hurt one, and after that
Goodnight watched a shadow waver and sink away. He heard the man
strike ground and grunt. The column turned into a close bunch and
men got down, working their way through the horses.</p>

<p>"Dead?" said the voice.</p>

<p>"No," said somebody.</p>

<p>"Yes," another voice added.</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Charley Tevis."</p>

<p>Goodnight found himself boxed against the wall of the canyon, a
rider crosswise before him, a rider behind him. When this group
moved on again he would be in the current, moving with it and
unable to break clear of it without being observed. The collection
of men and horses choked this narrow way, swaying in confused
motion, men riding back and forth restlessly. Goodnight grumbled in
half a tone: "I want to see Charley," and wedged his horse into the
jam. Men gave way to either side, but one of them said: "Keep your
shirt on&mdash;he's dead." A match burst near the ground near by
and he saw the sharp silhouette of a face&mdash;Harry Ide's
face&mdash;bent toward the dead man; the match went out, making the
blackness greater than before. Goodnight's horse had stopped, its
progress barred by another horse in front of it. Harry Ide said:
"Give me a hand. We'll sling him across his saddle."</p>

<p>Somebody else got down and all the horses stirred again.</p>

<p>A thin gap showed ahead of Goodnight, into which he worked his
way, his knee scraping another knee. He got into a more open spot
and half turned his horse, wanting to make no show of hurry in all
this.</p>

<p>"Harry," said somebody, "he'll slow us down."</p>

<p>"We're not runnin' from anything, are we?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to be in this timber by daylight. These hill
people will be behind every tree."</p>

<p>"You got a better idea? Lift him up, boys."</p>

<p>A rider drifted forward from the rear; he came coasting up
beside Goodnight. He bent nearer Goodnight. "Match?"</p>

<p>"No," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>Harry Ide was speaking again to the group around him. They had
the dead man in the saddle. They were holding him while Ide made a
quick hitch with his rope, ducking up and down in the blackness.
The dissenter still disliked the idea. "You'll have a hell of a
time making any hitch hold him on the leather. He'll slide and
scare the horse into a run. You'll have him draggin'. At the foot
of the hills you'll just have bones left. Dump him in the timber.
We can come back and bury him tomorrow night."</p>

<p>Harry Ide said: "That'll stay tied," and pushed back through the
crowd to his own horse. "Everybody else here?"</p>

<p>The man beside Goodnight had found his match. Goodnight saw his
arm lift and he heard the match scrape against a thumbnail, and at
that moment he swung his head and bent down, as though to check his
stirrup, thus turning his head from the man's sight. The match
flared and its light hung on, and went out. Straightening,
Goodnight saw the man's face pointed to him. At the head of the
column Harry Ide called: "Let's go." and the mass began to shift
and sort itself into column again. Suddenly the near man swayed
forward to bring Goodnight's face into view. He said nothing, but
he seemed ticked by suspicion. "Who's this?" he suddenly asked and
reached out to grasp Goodnight's arm.</p>

<p>The head of the column moved on. Goodnight had jockeyed himself
near the foot of it, with three or four men behind him. The near-by
man said, "Ride beside me," in a changing, toughening voice, and
let go his grip, and moved ahead. Goodnight murmured: "I'll ride
back with Bill," and swung his horse toward the rear at once. The
use of the name was a fair risk&mdash;in this group there had to be
at least one Bill. Meanwhile another man came up from behind and
passed him and the man who had grown doubtful now was too far ahead
to work his way back. But his voice lifted: "Don't let that fellow
drop out!"</p>

<p>Goodnight was at the end of the column, only one man now near
him. He said to this one: "Who the hell's he talkin' about?"</p>

<p>The rear man grumbled: "Who's talkin' about what?"</p>

<p>Harry Ide's voice sailed down the column. "What's up?" The
column, not yet wholly straightened into a marching line, lost
speed. The man adjoining Goodnight drifted ahead to catch up and as
he did so Goodnight turned his horse, walked it upgrade fifty feet
and wheeled against the bank of the gulch again, blending himself
with the shadows. The column had wholly stopped, its tail a hundred
feet below him. A voice said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's a sleeper in this outfit. What I saw of him don't look
familiar to me."</p>

<p>Ide said impatiently: "We're wasting time and we're in a bad
spot."</p>

<p>"Still, there's somethin' funny."</p>

<p>Ide said: "Soon settled. Light up and take a look at the man
next to you. Hurry it up and don't keep the matches burain'."</p>

<p>Goodnight turned half in his saddle, watching the uneasy shift
of the column's shadow; he saw the matches flare and make prickling
flitters of light and he saw faces vaguely. Then the matches died,
to be followed by somebody else's voice: "Where's that man who was
ridin' behind me?"</p>

<p>"Behind who?"</p>

<p>"I was on the tail end. Then somebody dropped back behind me.
Who dropped back behind me?"</p>

<p>There was a delay, after which Ide spoke: "We started with
fifteen horses. We still got fifteen. What the hell's the matter
with you fellows?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but where's the one that dropped back?" insisted the
voice. "I'm goin' to take a look."</p>

<p>A single shadow broke from the column's massed shadow and moved
up the road. He was fifty yards from Goodnight when Harry Ide
called after him. "That's enough. Let's ride." The column moved
again, leaving this single man with his lonely scouting. He came on
steadily and stubbornly until he was twenty feet below Goodnight
and there he stopped, trying to penetrate the blackness with his
glance. He bent forward in the saddle and seemed to stare straight
at him; he stayed that way, completely motionless, listening and
staring until Goodnight feared his own horse would break the
silence.</p>

<p>The column had gone on and the single rider at last grew weary
of the waiting and turned about and went away. Perhaps a dozen
yards onward he stopped and made one more quiet stand, and then
went on again, finally fading from sight. Goodnight delayed until
the sound of the man had dropped to a scuffling murmur. Thereafter
he turned upgrade again and came presently to the head of the
canyon.</p>

<p>The road at this point reached level ground, passed through a
short belt of timber, and came upon the meadow of Sun Ranch; and in
the belt of timber, he well knew, some of the Sun Ranch crew would
be stationed, waiting for trouble. He left the road and cut a
considerable circle, reaching the meadow at a distance from the
house. There was a light inside the house and as he watched he saw
a door come open and men move awkwardly through it, carrying
another man inside. He crossed the meadow, still circling, reached
timber, and came cautiously upon the house from the eastern side.
The length of the dining room and kitchen was before him, all dark;
he skirted this, turned a corner and stopped at the edge of the
yard. The door of the main house was still open&mdash;a careless
thing he thought&mdash;and he saw the girl sitting silent on the
porch steps.</p>

<p>He said: "Virginia," and looked sharply around the yard to see
what effect the sound of his voice might make. A shadow broke from
the corner of the bunkhouse, stepping into the yard; and a man came
at once from the main house. The girl, still seated, spoke
indifferently: "Who's there?"</p>

<p>"Goodnight," he said and rode over the yard. He stepped down and
faced her. She looked up at him and he saw that she had been
crying. She gave him a stone-still glance and her voice was hard
and turned against him.</p>

<p>"Why bother to come back?"</p>

<p>"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"My father's dead."</p>

<p>Theo McSween was on the porch, his light face turned sallow and
sharp and cool. He held his hands on his hips, waiting out
Goodnight; two other men moved in from the yard, behind Goodnight.
He heard their feet slip along the ground. He sat down on the porch
beside the girl and he watched the way her mouth struggled to hold
its tight shape and gradually grew loose. She wanted to cry again
and she wanted to hate the world. He put his arms around her and
drew her against his shoulder, and listened to her fresh crying
begin. Her body trembled and her tears ran down her cheeks and fell
warm against his hand.</p>

<p>One of the men in the yard said to McSween: "Shut that door, you
fool. You want to make targets for Harry Ide to shoot at?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE WILLFUL WAY</h2>

<p class="first">HOLDING her, he felt the misery that made its
havoc in her, and for the first time in many months he had pity for
another human being, and this surprised him, since he had thought
himself toughened, beyond any such feeling. McSween, who now stood
on the porch behind him, had turned him against the race of man.
Nevertheless, the girl's broken crying hurt him and caused him to
think of Harry Ide with anger.</p>

<p>He could not turn his head and he disliked McSween's presence
behind him. He said so: "Get away from my back." The three other
Sun riders, Bob Carruth and Tap and Slab, had moved out of various
corners of the yard and collected before him; they looked
dead-beat.</p>

<p>He said again to McSween: "Step around where I can see you."</p>

<p>The girl pulled herself out of his arms and checked her crying.
He watched her put away her tragedy and bring her will like iron
hoops around her feelings. Her mouth pressed together and at the
moment she showed them all a bitter face. McSween had not moved.
Goodnight rose and turned, facing the man and watching his
expression grow balky. He stepped up to the porch, coming near
McSween. "Mind me," he said. McSween spoke through the quick short
lifts of his breath: "You ridin' me again? Nothing you can do will
budge me if I don't want to budge. I'm one horse you don't
break."</p>

<p>"Move down," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"No," said McSween, "not until I'm ready."</p>

<p>He expected trouble and he had himself braced for it and cocked
for it; still, he was slow and Goodnight's fist cracked him in the
belly before he got his arms lifted. It drove the wind out of him;
his hands dropped, fingers fanwise over his stomach, and his mouth
sprang wide open and he stood there in an agony, without breath and
unable to get it. Goodnight struck him lightly on the shoulders,
swung him and caught him with both hands and flung him off the
porch. McSween's boots caught on the steps and he fell on his knees
and hands into the yard, and remained like that, his head lopped
down. The three other Sun men said nothing.</p>

<p>The girl looked on McSween with a kind of impersonal interest.
She turned to the doorway, speaking to Goodnight. "Come in here a
moment."</p>

<p>McSween got to his feet slowly and faced Goodnight. The color
had entirely gone from his sharp countenance, the insolence and the
pride in his own power was vanished. Even so, there was something
left&mdash;a brand of fanatic stubbornness that made him meet
Goodnight's glance with a dead stare.</p>

<p>"Give me my gun back and we'll get the whole thing done with.
That's what you want, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Go on back to the bunkhouse," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>McSween spread his legs. He closed his fists and let them hang
beside his legs; he had the air of a man talking to himself in
silence, commanding himself to stand fast. He never said anything
and he seemed half drugged. Goodnight came down the steps at him,
waiting for McSween to break ground, to show fear. He didn't get
the chance to see it, for one of the other Sun men pulled McSween
around and shoved him toward the bunkhouse.</p>

<p>Goodnight said: "Don't lend the lady-killer a gun, boys," and
turned into the house. He closed the door and waited for Virginia
to say what was on her mind.</p>

<p>She was in a corner of the room, waiting for him, stony-
patient. "You've met Mac somewhere before?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why ride him then?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you that," he said.</p>

<p>"I can. Just to be top dog. You hate anything that won't buckle
under. I thought you were cruel but then I thought you might have
something better in you. I guess I was right in the beginning.
Well, that seems to be all that counts here. Do you want to stay
on?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You know what's happened?"</p>

<p>"I got mixed up with Harry Ide's bunch when I came up the
road."</p>

<p>"So it was Ide?" she said. "I knew they'd be from the desert but
I wasn't sure he led the party. You see what it's like. Where are
you sympathies&mdash;or does it matter?"</p>

<p>He could have told her that her hurts mattered, but he did not.
All he said was: "It doesn't matter. They've probably got me tagged
as against them anyhow, since I'm here."</p>

<p>"I've got to keep this ranch. I don't want to be driven
away."</p>

<p>"We can try," he said. "There ought to be men enough in the
hills to lend a hand."</p>

<p>She said: "That's what I fear."</p>

<p>He studied the answer. He pointed to the lamp on the table near
her. "Turn that down," and he gave a glance round about to the
windows of the room. She lowered the wick, throwing the room into
half-darkness as he said: "I'm not certain of Mac."</p>

<p>"Do you doubt he'll try to kill you now?"</p>

<p>"He'll try," said Goodnight. "I was just wondering which way
he'd try."</p>

<p>"Tell him to ride on if you want."</p>

<p>"I want him here. If he leaves I'd have to go after him."</p>

<p>She made nothing of that and shrugged her shoulders. "How far do
you have to follow a man if he won't bend to your liking?"</p>

<p>He said: "You're worried about Boston Bill."</p>

<p>She showed him an expression that meant nothing to him. The
man's name affected her or had power to disturb her, and when he
realized it he looked at her more carefully, not so sure as he had
previously been of her attitude. He said frankly: "Or maybe it
isn't worry."</p>

<p>She avoided answering the implied question by changing the
subject. "My father tried to play the kind of a game he wasn't
meant to play. Other men influenced him too much. I don't want it
to be that way with me. All I want is to keep this ranch."</p>

<p>"Boston Bill is willing to help you do it," he reminded her.</p>

<p>Her voice revealed some strain and some emphasis. She kept
stubbornly to her point. "I want to keep this ranch and I want to
run it. You're brutal enough to make men mind you. How would you
like to be foreman?"</p>

<p>"If I'm supposed to keep off the thing you're afraid of," he
said, "maybe you better tell me what that is."</p>

<p>"You'll see."</p>

<p>He turned to the door, but he changed his mind and crossed the
room and went through the kitchen and left the house by the back
way. Reaching the edge of the house, he caught an incomplete
glimpse of the yard and saw nothing; but the feeling was on
him&mdash;that feeling which had so many times come out of the
primitive recesses of his body to warn him&mdash;and therefore he
moved back into deeper darkness, cut a wide circle and came up in
the rear of the bunkhouse. Stepping beside its end wall he reached
the edge of the yard and found McSween in the middle of the yard,
facing the porch with a rifle in his arm.</p>

<p>The girl had turned up the house lamp and she had opened the
door to let out the day's heat condensed inside; and therefore
McSween was a revealed shape in the yellow glow. Had not Goodnight
hated the man so thoroughly, he would have admired him, for McSween
waited there openly, with a kind of dumb patience and a stolid
desperation, as though his own pride could not be satisfied with
any other way.</p>

<p>Goodnight stepped into the yard, lifting his gun on McSween.
"Stand fast," he said. "Drop the rifle."</p>

<p>The sound of his voice made McSween flinch. Goodnight noticed a
short, stiff shudder go through the man. McSween stood rooted, not
turning his head as he grated back his answer: "Why didn't you do
this square and meet me head-first? I was right here where you
could see me."</p>

<p>"Drop the gun," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>McSween let the gun fall, and then turned. His face was old and
showed something close to despair. "When do I get the chance?" he
said. "I got it coming to me."</p>

<p>"When you can find it," said Goodnight. "Get into the
bunkhouse." He walked past McSween and picked up the rifle. McSween
stood indecisively in his tracks, watching Goodnight with his
balked glance. Goodnight rammed the muzzle of the rifle into the
man's back. "Move on," he said. The pressure stirred McSween. He
marched to the bunkhouse with his fist doubled; and swinging he
went into the bunkhouse and moved like a man half-asleep to his
bunk in the corner; he sat down on its edge, still staring at
Goodnight. The other three had turned in for the night, but they
were awake, watching this scene.</p>

<p>"Who lent this greenhorn a gun?" asked Goodnight.</p>

<p>Bob Carruth said: "It's my gun."</p>

<p>"Man should be more careful with his weapons," said
Goodnight.</p>

<p>"He said he only wanted to fire one shot. Didn't think it would
hurt the gun."</p>

<p>"He was braggin'," observed Goodnight.</p>

<p>"So it appears," agreed Carruth gravely.</p>

<p>"It was a nice play," added Goodnight. "He stood in the light,
knowin' I'd see him. Knowin' I'd surround him and take his gun
away."</p>

<p>"Still," said Carruth, "he could of shot through the window, or
stayed in the shadows and hipped you."</p>

<p>"Maybe he thought of that," said Goodnight. "Then he got to
thinkin' that maybe he might miss his first shot and wouldn't get
in the second. So he did it the way it would look the best and hurt
the least."</p>

<p>"That might be a fact," said Carruth. "Man never knows. Still,
why wouldn't he make the try, with him so far on the worst end of
it?"</p>

<p>"Lady-killers," said Goodnight, "have no guts."</p>

<p>McSween sat bowed over on the bunk, head between his hands. His
eyes were yellow-gray in the light, winkless as they watched
Goodnight. He said nothing at all; he only let his dead-set face
show its expression. The three other men looked on, neutral and
interested. Carruth, thought Goodnight, was willing for McSween to
use the gun because he was curious as to how it would come out.
Carruth&mdash;and the other two as well&mdash;had no conscience in
the matter. They were spectators interested in the show, watching
one dog bristle at another dog, and coolly laying bets on the
outcome. He knew that. He knew, too, they would forever watch him
for whatever danger he might be to them, to discover if he came out
of their own past lives to catch up with their crimes; and he knew
that if they feared him they would try to do away with him, but
meanwhile would respect whatever power he showed. That was their
kind.</p>

<p>"Bob," he said, "who's been foreman around here?"</p>

<p>"I been."</p>

<p>"Hope you liked it while it lasted."</p>

<p>Bob Carruth took the news with his usual grave and indifferent
manner. One eyebrow lifted, opening one eye fuller; the other was a
streak of light between closing lids. Finally he turned over on his
bunk, putting his back to Goodnight. "That's fine. Now you can do
the talkin' when Boston Bill shows up tomorrow."</p>

<p><br>
One wave of sunlight broke over the hills, shattering the morning
twilight, the suddenness of it like sound whirling down the
meadows, through the glens and pockets and narrow rock canyons. The
pines standing in massed shadows above Sun Ranch heaved suddenly
out of obscurity, their green needles shining. At this hour the air
was thin and clear and cold and the strike of Goodnight's foot on
the water trough ran its echo straight out along the earth and
split into double echoes at the timber's edge. Breakfast was done
and he had gone for his horse when he heard the on-reaching running
of horses coming from the ridge trail. Coming back to the yard he
found Boston Bill at the porch, talking to Virginia Overman. Half a
dozen of Boston Bill's men sat asaddle, waiting.</p>

<p>Carruth stood in the bunkhouse doorway, watching this with his
usual cool reserve. Carruth murmured to him, "Now you can figure
this one out," and seemed amused.</p>

<p>Goodnight thought of something. "Where's Bill's
headquarters?"</p>

<p>"Back on the ranch that used to be Clark Morphy's. Two miles
up."</p>

<p>"He could have heard the shooting last night."</p>

<p>"He could have," agreed Carruth.</p>

<p>The idea stuck with Goodnight as he went over the yard. Boston
Bill, at the moment, reached out and touched Virginia's shoulder
and spoke to her. "All you need to do is tell me what you
want."</p>

<p>Goodnight observed the half-reluctant interest on the girl's
face. Bill's presence and his personal attraction reached her, even
against her judgment. It was something like this, he thought, as he
arrived at the porch. Boston Bill swung around to meet him, the
charm fading. "You're back?" he said, and then thought of something
else. "You in this fight last night?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Boston Bill. "You were in town." He turned
to the girl. "Don't trust men you don't know."</p>

<p>His charm returned as he looked at her. He was a tall one, bold
and arrogant when he chose to be; he was capable of swift changes
and he had unexplained qualities&mdash;and therefore he fascinated
her. Goodnight was aware of this as he watched her eyes drop. She
said hurriedly: "Frank is foreman here, Bill."</p>

<p>Bill gave Goodnight a steady stare. "That trip to town saved you
a lot of trouble."</p>

<p>"Where were you last night?"</p>

<p>Boston Bill said: "That's none of your damned business." Then he
remembered the girl, and gave a better answer, grudgingly: "We just
got back to our place after a night ride. Otherwise we'd been
here."</p>

<p>Goodnight looked back at the riders still sitting asaddle and
saw no night weariness on them. What was the man trying to avoid?
Meanwhile Boston Bill put his hand on the girl's arm and said, "I
want to see you alone a moment." He led her inside and closed the
door.</p>

<p>Goodnight got out his tobacco sack and poured a cigarette. He
drew a long breath of smoke and he watched Boston Bill's men and
was aware of their covert amusement. McSween appeared and stood
beside the stirrups of one of the riders and watched him with a
hungry anticipation, as though he saw the chance for which he
waited. Over by the bunkhouse the three other Sun men held their
places, also watching and judging him. This whole scene made him or
broke him as the moments ran on.</p>

<p>The door opened and Boston Bill called out: "Virginia wants her
dad buried next to her mother&mdash;over there beyond the trees.
Get busy on it, and send somebody to Roselle for the minister."</p>

<p>It was Boston Bill's signal that he proposed to take control.
Goodnight knew it and the crowd knew it and something went over the
yard, making him smaller before all of them. He nursed the
cigarette, saying nothing and doing nothing. The mounted men got
down and started toward their chore.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; AT ROSELLE</h2>

<p class="first">A MINISTER came out of the hills sometime before
noon on an old gray horse, conducted the funeral and took his
dinner and went away. Goodnight said to Bob Carruth: "Where'd he
come from?"</p>

<p>"Roselle."</p>

<p>"Where's Roselle?"</p>

<p>"Summit of the Pass Road. Was a mining town."</p>

<p>Goodnight went back to the corral and took seat on the top bar.
He had a view of the main house whose door was again closed. Boston
Bill's men sat around the yard, in the shade and in the sun; the
day inched along, meaning nothing to anybody. This was one of those
times when, as in a poker game, luck ran low and the players sat
disinterestedly by, waiting for a break to come, for a fat pot to
build up. He realized he had taken a bad beating during the
morning. In the space of two minutes before the critical audience
Boston Bill had cut him down so that he was a lesser man in the
eyes of all of them, so that whatever pressure or weight he used
against any of them would need to be greater than before. Boston
Bill was clever and fought with many weapons.</p>

<p>He had stood back in the small crowd at the funeral and he had
watched the girl; she had shed no tears and it seemed to him she
had changed greatly. Her way of standing, her gray eyes looking
down at the earth, her fixed composure&mdash;these things reminded
him somehow of her father. He thought of her very steadily as he
balanced on the corral bar and watched the house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Boston Bill sat on the corner of the living-room
table, inside the house, and considered Virginia Overman. She sat
in a corner of the room, perfectly composed. Not once during the
funeral, and not since, had she given way. She had excellent
control of herself, a thing which impressed him. Yet he doubted the
sincerity of any woman and believed all of them to be actors who
suited themselves to any part and any emotion, playing whatever
role they thought would show them to advantage. He spoke softly
even as his critical eyes searched her.</p>

<p>"It is very tough. You know very well I'll do whatever chore you
want done. I've told you that before."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I remember."</p>

<p>"Virginia," he said, "how are you going to run things?"</p>

<p>"As they have been run in the past."</p>

<p>"You must be aware of the difficulties. The kind of men we have
to use around here do not take to a woman's instructions."</p>

<p>She looked at him intently: "A woman can do things a man cannot.
Has that occurred to you?"</p>

<p>He smiled with some indulgence. "A woman's knuckles were never
meant for a fight."</p>

<p>"A woman has a smile," she said. "I could smile your whole crowd
away from you."</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "what goes on in your head?" He was sober now,
and he thought carefully of what she had told him. He looked at her
in a different way; he permitted more of his natural cynicism to
show. "You're talking in a very realistic manner."</p>

<p>"Bill," she said, "I can read your mind. You're sorrowing with
me today and doing it well. You do many things so well. But
tomorrow or the next day, or next week, you'll suggest how lonely
it is for me and you'll propose. That's about right, isn't it?"</p>

<p>He stared at her, considerably surprised at her cold and
rational analysis of him. It irritated him to know that she had
played with him precisely as he had played with her. He said
pointedly: "The truth is, Virginia, you're not particularly forlorn
because of your father's death."</p>

<p>"I will do what my father did not do," she said.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Don't be curious."</p>

<p>"You will do it with my help," he said, "or you will not do it.
Don't let your fancies get the best of you."</p>

<p>She studied him over a thoughtful interval. "You're pretty blunt
when you don't feel you have to be charming. Sun Ranch is mine. You
had a better grip on my father than you have on me. You knew him
better. You knew how to work his prejudices and how to appeal to
his streaks of hate and justice. He had more justice in him than I
have. He could hate, but I can hate harder. He was a simple man,
and you studied him and knew him, and used him. Had he lived you
would have made yourself so necessary to him that he could have
done nothing without you. I'm different. You don't know me as well
and you'll never be certain I'm standing where you think I am."</p>

<p>"My God," he said, "is this what has been going on behind your
smile all these months? You sound as though you despised me."</p>

<p>Her glance ran over his face and a flicker of expression came to
her lips and eyes. Then she looked down. "No, Bill," she murmured,
"I don't hate you."</p>

<p>He was trying to judge her and having a poor time of it. She had
changed on him, throwing his reasoning out of line; now he tried to
re-establish her in his scheme of things. "It would be foolish of
you to send me away, Virginia. Where will you get other help?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sending you away. I only want it clear about Sun Ranch.
You can change your plans."</p>

<p>"What plans?"</p>

<p>"You're not the usual kind of a brush jumper. You ran away from
something much better than the average man. I think you sometimes
hate yourself for running. You are very proud of your brains and
you have a contempt for most men around you. Well, here you are.
You think you could make a little world of your own and run it as a
perfect king."</p>

<p>"Sun Ranch," he pointed out, "is just a mountain meadow
surrounded by trees. You could make it bigger if you wished. You
could have cattle over half the mountains, if you wished."</p>

<p>"Cattle rustled from the desert?"</p>

<p>"How does it matter where we get our beef? These men will take
what they can from us. We can take what they have with equal right.
Sun Ranch could stretch from summit to the desert. It could go out
upon the desert twenty miles. If you want it."</p>

<p>"All that is nice to dream about, Bill. You're a great one to
dream and talk."</p>

<p>"I can draw twenty or thirty men to me," he said. "What's to
stand against us? It won't be hard to knock out the ranchers who
have been trying to ruin Sun. Once they're gone, who cares? If it
were back East we'd have some kind of law on our trail. But this is
just empty country and it is a matter of indifference what happens.
How do you suppose big outfits ever got started in the first place,
if not that way? Ten years from now, when settlers catch up with
us, it will be too late. It isn't too late now."</p>

<p>"You've been here long enough to have tried it. Why haven't
you?"</p>

<p>"I came here green," he said. "I had to learn. I had to build up
my crowd. I've built it."</p>

<p>"You always talk well. You started out to catch Harry Ide. You
didn't do it."</p>

<p>"This stranger rode up and spoiled my play."</p>

<p>She said: "What really made you go to see Ide?"</p>

<p>He gave her a strange look. "I have told you."</p>

<p>She watched him so steadily that he grew impatient, and afraid.
He held her glance, knowing he could not show weakness now, but the
effort was hard and he broke it up by bringing a smile to his face.
"You're touchy."</p>

<p>"Go back and do what you intended to do. Then I'll listen to
you."</p>

<p>He said slowly: "You're asking me to go kill Harry Ide?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"I realize how you feel. This thing has hit you hard and Ide
deserves to die. He probably will in due time. But I hate to hear
you speak so coldly."</p>

<p>"Now you're just talking again. If you're afraid, don't bother.
All the hill outfits are friends of Sun. They will do what you
haven't done."</p>

<p>"I do not like to hear that from you."</p>

<p>"For that matter," she said, "Goodnight will take care of Ide
for me. You can ride along on your own business, whatever it
is."</p>

<p>He said angrily: "I don't want him around."</p>

<p>She swung about, her will as strong as his. She flung her
question at him. "Why didn't you settle that also when he stopped
you at Ide's?"</p>

<p>He said, very slowly: "Are you asking me to go out there and
draw on Goodnight?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Let him alone. But don't talk of things you
never mean to do."</p>

<p>He said: "I'll see you again in a day or two," and left the
house. She followed to the doorway, watching him swing to his
horse; and wait for his men to gather. All those men were wild
ones, fugitives and without much conscience; yet Boston Bill had
done one thing to them, had bound them together and had made them
loyal to a certain extent. Presently he wheeled and led his outfit
away.</p>

<p>"Bob," she called, "saddle up for me." She let out a long sigh.
The stiffness on her face, the cold containment, slipped. She was
tired and showed it and she was thinking: "I shall have to handle
him better than that or he will slip through my fingers, or destroy
me. He is a clever man. He is more subtle than a man. His brain is
like a woman's&mdash;like mine. He reads me almost as well as I
read him."</p>

<p>Bob brought her horse forward. Going to it, she spoke to
Goodnight who still roosted on the top corral bar. "I wish you to
ride along, Frank." She waited until he had joined her and
afterwards turned to the meadow road.</p>

<p>He said nothing to her. Depression obviously chilled her spirit;
she struggled with her thoughts, with her eyes fixed ahead and
seeing little of anything, with her lips compressed. The meeting
with Boston Bill had left her displeased and he had also noted that
Boston Bill's expression, on leaving the house, had been stormy.
These two had clashed.</p>

<p>They reached the timber and came upon a trail running upgrade
into the high country. She sat like a man in the saddle, her
stirrups low, her legs straight and her body swinging in easy
motion. Once she looked around at him, as if some sudden thought
had compelled her. Her lips were clear and ample against her face
and her eyes had dark depth. The lightness of her skin and the
color of her hair made her seem a laughing girl, easy and teasing
and buoyant and quick to love. The suggestion of it went deep into
him and produced its effect.</p>

<p>They came to a summit of the trail. Here she stopped and pointed
her hand down a ravine, at the lower end of which a small meadow
opened. Following her gesture, Goodnight noticed a log house and a
weather-gray barn sitting in the meadow. "That's where Boston Bill
stays," she said. "I wanted you to know where it was. This is not
the closest road to it. The best road goes straight from Sun.
Remember that."</p>

<p>She went on, crossed a short bare bench and reached timber,
again climbing. She appeared pressed for time and she drew back
again into her thoughts and made no further attempt to talk to him.
Half an hour onward they came upon a narrow footbridge slung over a
canyon thirty feet wide and sixty feet deep, at the bottom of whose
dark slice a creek ran swift and white. Somewhere nearby, out of
sight, a falls made a steady racket and the mist of its spraying
lay damply in the air. Now the road reached a clearing scarcely
more than a foothold at the base of a cliff, and ended in front of
a cabin and a corral and a log lean-to. Behind the cabin rose a
cliff, gray and weathered and cracked. In all other directions the
pines marched away in ragged up-and-down formation, covering the
sharp breaks and ridges roundabout.</p>

<p>A mustard-colored dog, long and lank, scuffled around the cabin
with its red mouth showing, and a man as lank as the dog stepped
from the lean-to, holding a rifle loose in one hand. A short beard
covered a face that might have been old or young; he had a hatchet
chin and agate-black eyes and a faint streak of a mouth. He was
about six feet tall, nothing but bone and hide, with the round
shoulders of one who bent to watch the trail as he walked or rode.
His voice, when he spoke, was an old man's voice: "Git down,
Virginia."</p>

<p>"Just came to introduce you to a man, Ned. This man. His name is
Frank. He's working for me."</p>

<p>"For you or your old man?"</p>

<p>"My father is dead. Harry Ide's crowd shot us up last
night."</p>

<p>The old man stolidly accepted the information. He shrugged his
shoulders and his lids crept nearer together, accenting the beady
brightness of his eyes. "We can remember that," he said. "One day
Harry Ide's goin' to have a hell of a time." He looked at Goodnight
and said: "Whut about this feller?"</p>

<p>"If he comes up here for anything, remember he's from me." She
turned to Goodnight. "This is my father's oldest friend&mdash;Ned
Tower."</p>

<p>Ned Tower laid his glance on Goodnight like the edge of a knife,
motionless but ready to cut. He was one of the lone sort, Goodnight
judged, answering to no man and responsible only to his own
conscience; and his conscience was tough enough for anything that
had to be done. He nodded his head: "I'll know him if he comes,
Virginia. That all?"</p>

<p>"All now," she answered.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it ain't all. Whut you goin' to do with Boston
Bill?"</p>

<p>"I'll use him," she said.</p>

<p>"Will you now?"</p>

<p>"I'm not as easy as Dad," she said.</p>

<p>"We'll see," he said.</p>

<p>She turned away and led Goodnight downgrade, saying nothing
again until they were near the main meadow road. The sun was low
and the shadows streamed far out from the trees and the heated,
spicy air began to tremble with oncoming coolness. She looked at
him, her troubled mind now seeming to relax. "Ned Tower is a man I
can always turn to. He knows all the other hill ranchers. Up here
we're very clannish. A word to one is a word to all."</p>

<p>"Doesn't seem to trust Boston Bill."</p>

<p>"Nobody does. But if a dozen men ride into a hill rancher's
yard, what can he do? Best to feed the crowd and hope for no
trouble."</p>

<p>"I'd guess," said Goodnight, "it has been profitable all around.
He's brought you a lot of desert beef in return for his meals."</p>

<p>She hardened against the suggestion and had an instant answer.
"I've no regrets for the desert people. I'd like to see them
destroyed."</p>

<p>He said nothing and when they reached the bottom of the trail
and came into the Pass Road, she turned to him. "Why should you
care?"</p>

<p>"It is entirely your business," he said.</p>

<p>"But you disapprove."</p>

<p>"Hate to hear hardness in you. In a woman."</p>

<p>"There's hardness in you."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Maybe a man, made out of plain clay, wants a
woman to be better than that."</p>

<p>She stopped, she put out a hand to stop him. She turned and
looked fully at him. "That's the most revealing thing you have
said. How can you pack two different things around in your heart?
How can you be two men?"</p>

<p>He moved into the Pass Road. "Dust still here. Somebody's passed
by." He looked at the tracks in the ground and presently motioned
upgrade. "That way."</p>

<p>"Just another fugitive going over the hill." Then she added,
"Same kind of a man as you are," and watched him with sharp eyes.
He said nothing as they moved downgrade side by side. The
suggestion of other travelers turned him alert, she noticed. He sat
straighter in the saddle and he watched the trees with a restless
attention. He had a great assurance about him, he had no doubt of
himself. Behind the temper that drove him was great personal
warmth, and his infrequent smiles had made a strong effect in her.
She thought of the women he had known and felt angry at him for
knowing them. They trotted into the yard at sundown.</p>

<p>She stepped from the horse and said, "Please come into the house
for a moment," and led him inside. She closed the door and turned
to him with a changing expression on her lips. They lost the
day-long hardness and her eyes widened and met his attention and
glowed. Her breathing ran faster and suddenly she was a woman, fair
and wishing to be noticed. "Frank," she said, "you'll stay on won't
you?"</p>

<p>"If I'm not pulled away."</p>

<p>"What could pull you away?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you that."</p>

<p>She said: "I don't know what you're running from, or what you're
after. I've seen you do some terrible things. Yet I trust you. Even
when I saw you at your campfire I trusted you." She let her voice
sink and soften; it blew on him like pleasant wind. "If you were
truly bad you wouldn't look at a woman as you do. If you were
really cold you wouldn't speak of a woman as you do. Don't you
suppose I want to be the kind of a woman you think about? Don't you
think I am? But how can I be anything but hard? The men in these
hills will take whatever they can. These are the men I've seen all
my life. If I think all men are like that, you must not blame me.
How many times I have ridden these hills wondering if there was
another kind of a man."</p>

<p>He watched her closely and she saw his imagination come up and
catch fire in his eyes. It was like a voice singing to him, like
color showing through dead black. Then she said, still in her soft
way: "You'll stay?"</p>

<p>He came nearer and noticed the pulse in her throat beat quick
and hard; he watched the flurry of strange, unguessed things come
to her eyes and he saw her lips loosen. She dropped her glance, but
brought it quickly back, neither offering nor asking. But she
waited and he wondered about the waiting. Then he said, "Supper
time," and left the room.</p>

<p>She stood still, listening to his steps scrape across the porch.
The supper triangle broke the stillness of the yard, flinging metal
echoes outward to the hills, that sound breaking far up and far
away. She dropped her head, staring at the floor. For a moment she
hated him for refusing what she had silently suggested to him. He
had recognized the suggestion; she had observed its effect on him.
It had swayed him and he had used his will to pull away. Why had he
done that? Her pride was hurt by it, yet presently she said to
herself: "He'll stay," and went to her room. She made herself neat
for supper and looked carefully at herself in the mirror. She
combed her hair and stood back, coolly thinking of herself as she
would be to him, and moved on to the dining room.</p>

<p>Goodnight stood at the foot of the table; the three other hands
were already seated. Goodnight said: "Where's Mac?"</p>

<p>Bob Carruth looked up, gray and disinterested and reserved.
"Left."</p>

<p>"Left for where?"</p>

<p>"Didn't say."</p>

<p>She watched Goodnight grow cold, grow keen. "Which way did he
go?"</p>

<p>"That way," said Bob Carruth and waved his knife. "Towards
Roselle. Over the mountain. That's the way they all go. He stayed a
week. That's a long time for his kind."</p>

<p>Goodnight started for the door. Virginia came around the table
to halt him. "Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"After him."</p>

<p>"Then that's what brought you here. Why didn't you say so? And
if you wanted him, why didn't you take him when you had him?"</p>

<p>Goodnight went by her without answering. Carruth called out:
"Hope you find him. He took my forty-four."</p>

<p>Goodnight reached his horse. Turning in the yard, he looked at
Virginia. She said at once. "Will you come back?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," he said and ran on.</p>

<p>She watched him until he was far down the meadow. Afterwards she
went into the dining room. She stood a moment, undecided, and then
returned to the living room, her appetite gone. She felt strange,
she felt lonely. She walked slowly around the room with her complex
thoughts. "I should have warned him that Mac is treacherous," she
told herself. "I hope he knows it." She folded her arms across her
breasts. She said: "I had depended on him. What will I do now with
Boston Bill?" She went into the bedroom and stopped before the
mirror. She was a cold woman, she thought, and cared nothing for
Goodnight as a man. She had permitted Goodnight to see warmth in
her, knowing that it would draw him and hold him on the ranch. It
had been only for that reason. She scanned her face, she drew a
thumb beneath her eyes. She thought: Is that all of it?</p>

<p><br>
Twilight came on, lingered briefly, gave way to dark. Goodnight
reached the end of the meadow and ran on between black hedges of
pine. Now and then he pulled to a walk and gave his horse a
breathing spell, but he hated the delay and scarcely could abide
it; for the fear of losing Theo McSween dominated him and he cursed
himself for ever permitting the man out of his sight. There was
really nothing else left in him except this one desire. It had
changed his life, it had changed his mind and his heart and now
that he felt Theo McSween slipping away it made an emptiness in his
belly.</p>

<p>He had not figured the man would run. McSween had stood up to
him, had defied him, had come back for more punishment, had begged
for a gun and an even chance. What had changed him? Maybe,
Goodnight decided, the thought of more punishment had finally worn
the man's courage thin. It was what he had wanted&mdash;to destroy
the pride in McSween, to make him cringe and beg, to break him down
and gut him of every thread of self-respect until he stood stripped
and wrecked of manhood and knew it and hated himself for what he
was. There never had been a waking hour in the last three months
when Goodnight had not thought of how it was to be done; he thought
of it now and had his greedy eagerness. It looked like he had
broken McSween; and that was near to the end of it.</p>

<p>He reached a flat stretch and set his horse into a steady
canter. Mountain cold blew against him and the stars spread their
milky ferment through the black sky. He was high up and he had the
feeling that the whole weight of the hills suddenly tipped from
west to east. Out east was another sea of desert; if McSween
intended to run, he would run straight&mdash;the same way he had
been running ever since leaving Nevada. Across that eastern desert
he would go, more weary days on end.</p>

<p>Goodnight was two hours from Sun Ranch when he felt the peaks on
either side shove their shoulders toward the road, cramping it.
Creeks ran down those high slopes to make a little river that
flowed with the eastward-falling grade, and around a bend of the
road he caught the dull shine of house lights, thus coming upon
Roselle, in the jaws of the pass.</p>

<p>He drifted forward with caution, observing that this town was
nothing but a huddle of old shacks split by the road which went
straightaway through. Against the near-by hillside he made out the
yellow scars of mine dumps and the scaffolding of buildings
stripped of their covering lumber. When he reached the side of the
nearest house he stopped in the shadows to have a look before him;
a two-story building stood ahead of him with an outside stairway
leading from street to second floor. There seemed to be a saloon on
the ground floor, with a few horses standing before it; across the
road from it was another large building whose windows and doors had
been removed.</p>

<p>He studied the horses and did not identify McSween's mount; he
remained in his saddle for a few minutes, carefully waiting. A man
passed out of the saloon, and one man passed into it; that was all
the town showed him for his waiting, and afterwards the sense of
time wasted pushed him forward. Dismounting before the saloon, he
stepped inside the place. Four men sat at a table, playing poker;
and all four ceased playing and looked at him with a dead
steadiness. One of the four rose and moved behind the small bar; he
lifted a bottle and glass and set it on the counter.</p>

<p>"Where would a man eat?" said Goodnight.</p>

<p>The saloonkeeper pushed his thumb behind him. "Go sit down in
the back room. I'll fix it."</p>

<p>"Where would a man sleep?"</p>

<p>"Take your blanket up the outside stairs and pick a bunk."</p>

<p>"I'll eat first," said Goodnight and poured himself a short
drink. He held the glass between his hands a moment. The bartender
now did a queer thing; reaching down, he got an empty bottle and
turned and banged the bottle's bottom against the wall at his
back.</p>

<p>"What's that for?"</p>

<p>"Tellin' my old woman to fix another supper," said the
bartender.</p>

<p>The three other men hadn't stirred since his entry. This country
roundabout was the same as that near Sun Ranch, full of dodgers;
and probably the best trade this saloon had was from these
fugitives. Goodnight held the drink in his hand and moved quickly
on the door to the rear room. He threw it open before him and saw a
table with a red oil-cloth top. There was a plate on the table with
a steak half cut through and a cup of coffee half emptied. A chair
stood away from the table, as though a man had hurriedly kicked it
aside, had hurriedly departed. An open door at the rear of the room
showed the direction of his departure. Goodnight turned back and
laid his whisky glass on the bar. The barkeep said: "You want that
meal now?"</p>

<p>"Fry it up," said Goodnight. He went rapidly over the saloon to
the front door, and cast a sudden backward glance at the three men
at the poker table as he left the place. They were sitting by; they
were not in this deal. The bartender had given the signal to the
man eating in the rear room, but that was probably only the kind of
protection he would have given any stranger on the run&mdash;just a
rule of the house. Coming to the road, he looked to both
directions, made a quick decision and swung to his left, running
the front width of the house and turning the corner of it sharply.
It brought him to an alley lying between the saloon building and a
small adjoining house. He saw a shape weave at the far end and he
heard the ragged run of steps; he followed the alley and came out
at the back edge of the town. He heard the faint crush of a foot to
his right, and looked that way and saw nothing. The man had
disappeared in the darkness but a horse stood to Goodnight's left,
behind the hotel and saloon. He hugged the hotel wall and stepped
toward the horse. When he came upon it and looked closely at its
markings he knew he had caught up with Theo McSween. He was on the
near side of the horse, and reached out and untied the latigo and
hauled off the saddle and carried it on until he came against a
pile of boxes and rubbish behind the saloon's rear door. He dumped
the saddle in the pile. If McSween ran away now it would be
bareback; he wouldn't get far before being overhauled.</p>

<p>Goodnight paused a moment, trying to guess the man's actions.
McSween was behind him, moving toward the other end of the building
line, circling and retreating and trying for a fair shot. Therefore
Goodnight continued on until he reached the corner of the saloon
building and crept along the side of its wall until he reached the
road and the front edge of the building. He looked down the street
and saw nothing; and observed that the few lights which had been in
this town when he had entered it were now dimmed down; Roselle,
living on the trade of fugitives, gave its customers an even
break&mdash;no more and no less. One dull lance of light filtered
through a crack of the saloon's closed door; directly across the
street a yellow stain of light showed on the drawn shade of a
window. That was all. He and Theo McSween were alone on the street,
maneuvering and creeping while the rest of this town watched the
game go on.</p>

<p>He still stood at the side of the saloon, thereby exposed if
McSween backtracked and came upon him from the rear. He slid around
the edge of the saloon to the front side and stood there, watching
the lower end of the road. He was debating: If McSween crossed over
the road he'd be somewhere in the shadows of the opposite
buildings. If he hadn't crossed, he'd be waiting at the lower end
of town, or crawling back for a surprise play. There was no way of
knowing. He could wait and break the other man's nerve&mdash;he
could make McSween move and betray himself; or he could start
hunting.</p>

<p>It was not in him to wait. He had traveled too far and he had
hunted too long. Turning, he rounded the corner of the saloon and
quietly retraced his way down the side of the building to the rear;
and hugged the back wall as he moved toward the lower end of town.
He passed McSween's horse and he reached the narrow alley between
the saloon and the next building. He stopped here to listen, and
crossed the mouth of the gap in three long, soft steps. The next
houses sat close together; at each between-space he paused and
looked along it to the front&mdash;to the road whose deep yellow
dust threw up a faint glow. It was like looking down the black
barrel of a gun at a white piece of paper in front of it.</p>

<p>The end house was two hundred feet below the saloon and when he
got to its edge he faced the irregular floor of the short meadow
upon which Roselle lay. The road's yellow streak of dust ran on
back toward Sun Ranch, and the nearby hills lay above him, ragged
against the sky. Close at hand something stirred and someone
murmured. He put his ear against the house wall and heard the low
speaking of one voice and then another; townsmen were inside,
waiting out the fight.</p>

<p>He rounded the corner and advanced to the road and stood at the
house's edge, considering the short row of buildings across the
way. Three small houses squatted low in the night before him; the
windowless and doorless two-story building faced the saloon with
its black blind eyes. Watching it, he saw a faint glow in
the-second-floor window, like the low burning of a cigarette tip,
and he stared at it steadily until it occurred to him that this was
the night's light catching on a splinter of glass still hanging to
the window frame. The window, he now observed, commanded the road
and the house-tops of the town. From that position a man might see
many angles he could not see from the street level.</p>

<p>He backed away from the edge of the house and retreated to the
deeper shadows. He crossed the road and circled behind the
buildings on the north side and came against their ends, now, again
looking down the between-spaces as he passed them. When he reached
the rear of the two-story building he spotted a doorway and moved
to it and listened inside.</p>

<p>The smell of an abandoned place came out to him, musty and dry,
with the remnant odors of a thousand things once held within the
place still clinging there. He looked at a farther partition which
seemed to divide the lower floor and he saw another doorway in that
partition, its blackness less than the blackness of the partition.
A rat ran across the upper floor, producing a scurried, gritty wake
of sound. That was the only sound. Nothing came from the town and
nothing else came from this abandoned building which once held its
treasures.</p>

<p>He set one foot forward and down, testing the floor. He let his
weight fall easy and slow, and tested with another foot; and found
there was no floor but only a hard-packed earth. He slid on until
his foot struck a sill, and small as the echo was it seemed to
swell and grow large; he stopped dead and he listened and heard
nothing, but coolness of some kind ruffled the back of his neck. He
reached the doorway through the partition and stepped over another
sill and found himself in the forward half of the lower floor.
Onward he saw the dull-gray square of the door and the windows to
either side of it&mdash;these opening on the road.</p>

<p>He had begun to smell dust dragged up by his own feet, a dust
dried by the years and turned to powder. He looked to left and
right and discovered nothing, but he knew there had to be a
stairway or the remnant of a stairway somewhere close by. He made a
guess and turned to his right, still treading hard earth, and put
out his hand. Another two paces onward his forward-stretched finger
tips brushed a board slanting upward before him. He came near it
and sightlessly explored with his hands and felt the steps; and
when he slid his hand across one of the steps he touched a damp,
cold object that made him jerk his arm away. His wrist struck the
edge of the stairs, producing a definite noise. A voice came
straight down on him.</p>

<p>"That you, Goodnight?"</p>

<p>Goodnight sucked in a long, heavy gust of wind; he let it come
out in slow pinches. He stood rigid. It was McSween's voice, and it
came again. "That's you, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Come down out of there."</p>

<p>"Your last name's Goodnight, ain't it?" said McSween, doggedly
curious. "You're Mary Goodnight's brother, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Come down," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"There was somethin' about your face that bothered me&mdash;ever
since you hit Sun Ranch. Three hours ago it just came to me."</p>

<p>"I'm coming after you," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Everything's been bad enough without this," said McSween. "I
wish I had never met your sister. My luck changed the day I saw
her. It just ran out and nothing went right afterwards."</p>

<p>The emptiness of the building diffused McSween's voice so that
it was hard to know where the man stood. Goodnight got to the front
side of the stairs and laid his weight on the treads. They gave and
groaned, but they held him. He went up slowly, flattened as he
climbed. He heard McSween's body move; he heard the boards of the
second floor whine. McSween's voice came louder at him. McSween's
words fell out, hurried and breathless.</p>

<p>"She came of her own accord. I didn't drag her away. She was old
enough to know what she wanted to do. Why blame a man for
that?"</p>

<p>Goodnight's hands touched the second floor's level. He paused,
still uncertain of McSween's whereabouts. He heard the man
breathing and he heard the boards whine. McSween was doing a
strange thing&mdash;backing away into the blackness without a shot.
Goodnight lifted himself out of the stairway in one sudden spring,
whirling away from the stair wall. He stopped, he stood fast,
listening into the fathomless black. McSween's breathing was swift
and short, somewhere ahead.</p>

<p>"I wish," groaned McSween, "I knew what happened. When I touched
her I lost everything. I knew then something would happen. It just
came over me. So I hit the trail, but there never was a minute I
didn't know somethin' was comin' behind. If you was any other man I
wouldn't run."</p>

<p>Goodnight pulled up his gun. He pointed at the sound and he
fired. He heard the bullet smash through wood and brick. He heard
McSween shift direction.</p>

<p>"Listen," sighed McSween, "I'll never touch another woman."</p>

<p>Goodnight fired again. The burned powder bloomed blue-crimson in
the black; and then muzzle light leaped back at him and this second
floor roared with the quick explosions. He fired four times and
somewhere in the heart of the racket he heard McSween shout up a
great cry, and then sound and cry faded and the stink of powder
swirled around him and he heard the shallow, slow guttering of
McSween's breath. He stood still, coldly and patiently waiting to
put in a last shot.</p>

<p>McSween groaned and his body twisted against the rickety floor,
sending vibrations through the building. "A man and a woman," he
sighed. "A man and a woman&mdash;" He ceased to speak and Goodnight
thought he had died. But McSween caught his breath and went on. "A
man ought to be free. But he can't do without a woman and the woman
takes his freedom. Your sister smiled back at me, Goodnight. Now
I'm dyin' because of it. Is that fair?"</p>

<p>Goodnight said: "You'll be in hell a long time, remembering that
you took her away, used her, and left her to die."</p>

<p>"Ever kill a man before?"</p>

<p>"No," said Goodnight, "but I've got no regrets over this. I'm
happy it's done."</p>

<p>"You'll be in hell, then, a long time before you die," said
McSween.</p>

<p>He had been slowly stirring on the floor, and now ceased to
move. Goodnight listened and heard no breathing, and went forward
cautiously. His foot touched McSween's body and he bent over the
man, shaking him with a hand and feeling the lumped looseness give
and fall back. He thought of Carruth on Sun Ranch and reached down
and got the gun from McSween's hand; and climbed down the
stairs.</p>

<p>He made his way to his horse in front of the saloon. The door
was open and the saloonkeeper stood in the light. Looking around,
Goodnight noticed other men now showing in doorways. Lights came on
again from house to house and a woman's pale face appeared at a
window. He got to his saddle.</p>

<p>"You want that supper?" asked the saloonkeeper.</p>

<p>"Hold it for the next brush jumper comin' through. It won't be a
long wait." He turned west and rode away, Roselle behind him, and
two hours later reined in at Sun Ranch's yard. The echo of his
horse on the meadow road had run ahead of him. Carruth came to the
bunkhouse doorway and Virginia stood at the break of the main-house
porch, watching him as he rode over to Carruth. He handed down the
gun McSween had borrowed. Carruth took it and had a look at the
cylinder. He gave Goodnight his gravely disinterested stare. "It
was loaded when he took it. Empty now."</p>

<p>"He had his chance," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"I guess," remarked Carruth, "he wasn't the shot he thought he
was."</p>

<p>"As men go," said Goodnight, "he was at the bottom of the
pile."</p>

<p>Virginia called: "Come inside."</p>

<p>"I'm going to town."</p>

<p>"What's there for you?"</p>

<p>"A bottle of whisky," he said.</p>

<p>"There's a bottle here."</p>

<p>"I never get drunk on the ranch I work for."</p>

<p>She drew herself straight, hating him for his stubbornness. She
said: "If you find comfort in her, go on. You're of no use to
me."</p>

<p>He turned away, easing his horse into a slow canter. He heard
her call after him in another voice. "Will you be back?"</p>

<p>He didn't know and therefore he didn't answer.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; TIME FOR WONDER</h2>

<p class="first">HE reached Sherman City before midnight, left his
horse in the stable and strolled as far as the hotel corner. He
wanted to go directly to Niles Brand but he knew it would be best
to be seen by Rosalia's men before attempting to enter her house.
Therefore he loitered a few minutes, crossed to the Trail for a
drink, and came out again to find Rosalia's chore man, Gabe,
standing on the corner staring at the sky. As he went past, the old
one murmured: "Go into the back door of the hotel and turn right."
Then the old fellow resumed his absent-minded study of the
stars.</p>

<p>Goodnight moved toward the screening blackness at the street's
end. He reached the shed whereby he had earlier met Niles, turned
by it and came back along the rear side of the row of houses. He
crossed Rosalia's yard and let himself into the back door of the
hotel. A spot of light came through the keyhole of another door
directly to his right. He hit it once with his knuckles and stepped
inside. Niles Brand sat up on a bed, propped against pillows.
Rosalia stood at the corner of the room.</p>

<p>The sight of her struck him. He met her glance, its dark depth
and its growing glow; her lips changed faintly and then he
remembered the shape of them and the heaviness of them against him,
and all that had its way in him as he looked back upon her. Niles
Brand said in a softly ironic voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Frank, how's the big world?"</p>

<p>Niles was cheerful and grinning, but it appeared he had been
through his torment. His face was pale enough to show the freckles
ordinarily hidden by heavy tan and his lips were cracked from fever
and his cheeks were lanker than usual. There had been a doctor
working on him; he was properly bandaged and he wore his shirt.</p>

<p>"You eatin' well enough now?" asked Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Appetite came back today, like a rain on a dry land."</p>

<p>"What you doing in this room?"</p>

<p>Niles showed a bit of embarrassment. "I wouldn't take a lady's
bed from her."</p>

<p>Goodnight looked at the window, at the door. He said: "Not
protected much."</p>

<p>Rosalia moved over the room and opened its door, Goodnight
looked across the hall to another room whose door also stood open.
A man sat in a chair, facing them with a rifle over his knee. She
closed the door, making no comment at all.</p>

<p>"You see?" grinned Niles. "There's another fellow outside by my
window. This lady owns the town." He had been studying Goodnight
all this while with the critical and experienced eyes of a friend,
and what he saw took the cheerful grin from his face. "Somethin'
happened in the hills?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>A glinting expression showed on Niles's face. "Catch him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Goodnight. "That's done."</p>

<p>"Then." said Niles, "we can turn around and go home."</p>

<p>He got no answer from Goodnight. Goodnight showed him nothing;
he was dry and tired, and beyond that lay some kind of unpleasant
feeling. Niles said: "Better get a room and go to bed. Then we can
play rummy a couple days until I'm ready to ride."</p>

<p>"I'll see you tomorrow," said Goodnight, and turned out. His
steps struck the hallway floor, going forward to the front of the
hotel. The girl listened to them thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Not like him," said Niles.</p>

<p>"What has he done?"</p>

<p>"Killed a man," said Niles. "A man that ran away with his sister
and left her dyin' somewhere out in Nevada. Been a hell of a long
trail and I'm glad it is over. But he don't take it right. He ought
to be pleased."</p>

<p>She turned back to Niles. "Then he never was running away from
anything?"</p>

<p>"He's an honest man," said Niles. "But there's something
wrong."</p>

<p>"What was he like? Before all this happened to his sister?"</p>

<p>"Everything," said Niles, "was fun. Always smilin'."</p>

<p>"I've never seen him smile," she said. She stood soberly by the
bed, looking at Niles. But it was now as so often, before&mdash;she
looked at him without seeing him. She was far from him.</p>

<p>"I don't know what's workin' on him," said Niles.</p>

<p>"I do," she said. She turned out his light and left the room.
She stood in the darkness of her own yard and she called, easy-
voiced: "Syd," and waited until a shape drifted up from some yonder
patch of blackness. "Go to the Trail," she said. "There's a man in
there&mdash;you know the man&mdash;and he'll be getting drunk.
Don't let anything happen. When he's good and drunk, bring him to
me."</p>

<p>Goodnight walked through the small lobby of the hotel, waking a
man who sat sprawled asleep in a chair; the man opened his red eyes
briefly and closed them again. Goodnight reached the street,
looking both ways. There was an occasional light burning out of a
window but nothing showed on the street except for a fellow sitting
on the edge of the walk in front of the Trail, drunk and fighting
to keep erect. Goodnight turned toward the Trail. The drunk saw him
and the drunk murmured: "It's my legs, that's all. They went to
sleep on me. Ain't that the damnedest thing?" The Trail had a
swinging door with a window in it made of colored glass, green and
red and blue; the lights of the saloon came through it and turned
the drunk's face rainbow colors.</p>

<p>There was a card game going on inside the saloon&mdash;four men
deep in smoke, with the bartender standing by. When Goodnight
arrived the bartender turned behind the bar; the other four kept on
with their playing. They hadn't looked directly at him but he knew
they were conscious of his presence.</p>

<p>The bartender knew him from his prior visit, and distrusted him.
He watched Goodnight with his Irish brows dropped down like sagged
awnings. The barkeep wanted to bounce him out of the place, but
didn't dare to and so he nursed his jealous resentment in silence.
He put up a bottle and a glass. He let them drop harder against the
bar than was usual. Goodnight stared at him steadily, he held the
barkeep's glance and he put his elbows on the bar and bent across
it, murmuring in a little voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Get the hell out of my sight."</p>

<p>It was plain that the barkeep fancied himself a tough one, ready
to answer any challenge. No doubt his imagination had supplied him
with many a fight into which, in fancy, he had hurled himself with
a snarl and a terrible wrath, and out of which he had emerged
victorious, his opponent senseless on the ground, himself without a
scar. Now he stood before an actual challenge and the reality of it
stiffened him. He had belief in himself and an immense pride fed by
his dreaming, yet all this began to crumble. Goodnight saw him
struggle with his courage; he witnessed the barkeep's pride waver
forward and back, unequal to the issue. Coldness came to the
barkeep's belly and the coldness weakened his legs and fear was a
water dissolving his manhood. Suddenly he lowered his eyes and
stepped away.</p>

<p>He stopped at the end of the bar, half turned aside, but
Goodnight had a casual glimpse of his face, the sharp lines of
distaste, the strange putty look around the mouth. This man faced
his own private ruin; his admiration for himself died and he knew
self-hate, born of his weakness, so that from that moment forward
he would never again feel fully equal to other men. One single yell
and one impulsive swing of his fist would have saved him; no matter
what defeat or pain he may have suffered in a fight, he would have
arisen with his manhood still intact. But he had failed himself and
his face revealed the sickness of it. A thousand times in the
future he would review the scene and know at which point he had
failed, and would wish with all his heart he had acted
differently&mdash;and yet would know he could not have done so.
This night the barkeep became a different man.</p>

<p>Goodnight forgot him almost immediately and, save for the
occasional reminder of chips clacking behind him, he forgot the
four men playing poker. He was nursing a very odd feeling and the
drink he swallowed did not materially help. This mood, this
irritable and unsatisfied and formless feeling, would not dissolve;
it had come upon him at the moment of McSween's death, had ridden
all the way to Sherman City with him. Once in the past, he had come
down with typhoid fever, and remembered the sensations of unease
that preceded it; this was somehow similar.</p>

<p>He stood loose in his joints, his weight largely on his elbows.
He took a second drink, and a third, aware of a new man quietly
come to the saloon. He looked at the man and thereafter ignored
him. He ran a hand softly over the bar and was relieved and
satisfied to feel its cold, smooth solidness. The solidness helped
him; it was the only solidness anywhere. That was a queer thing to
think about. In the old days he traveled and had no cares and
everything was fun and the days ran on, hot or cold, but all of
them strong to his senses and all of them good. The past meant
nothing and the future never came; only the immediate day and its
fun had mattered.</p>

<p>Then for three months one thing alone had claimed his mind and
his heart. He had thought of nothing but his sister's tragedy, and
of McSween's downfall. His last remembrance before sleep was of
McSween, and his first waking feeling was of an impatience to be on
the trail after McSween. It had hurried him, it had crowded every
hour, leaving room for nothing else. Now it was all done and he
could be himself again.</p>

<p>He reached out with his thought to the old carefree times. He
said silently to himself, "I can go back to everything that used to
be." He let his weight settle heavier on his elbows. He lifted his
head and stared at the back bar, looking beyond it, and far away
from it, with a solid net of lines across his forehead. His long
face showed a flush and it showed the intensity of his thinking; he
was a bent, angular shape against the bar, gone out of this world.
He reached forward with his senses to catch the smell of the cold
wind coming down from the high peaks against his campfire, to
recall the shade of the dry desert at sunset time&mdash;all a
melted yellow surface; he reached farther and farther, but each
time he grasped nothing. Nothing came back. None of the sounds and
smells and tastes and none of the feelings came back.</p>

<p>He didn't feel free again; he couldn't capture the feeling of
freedom for all his trying. He felt burnt out and useless.
Somewhere after his fourth drink he understood he could never
return to his old days. A man&mdash;and the weight of the knowing
came down like the hammer of a pile-driver on his skull&mdash;a man
never went back. Each day changed his bones, his flesh, his blood.
Today's sunsets were never the color of yesterday's. The time never
would come again when, riding the trail with the whole day before
him, he could sing and dream and never care where night brought
him. He wasn't the same man. He was another man standing at the
bar, eyes half closed to catch the smoky tan light streaming
through the pony of whisky.</p>

<p>He looked at the bottle which had been half full and found it
almost empty. His weight was on his elbows but he felt only a
slight pressure there. He thought: "I have got to have something to
do." He thought of his sister and that memory hurt him until he
could no longer bear to think of her, and his old great rage
against McSween was as bitter as it ever had been. Even with
McSween dead, there was no peace and no sweetness; everything was
just the same. McSween had said: "You'll be in hell a long time
before you die." Now what had McSween meant?</p>

<p>A man said to him, from a long distance: "Your treat, ain't
it?"</p>

<p>He turned and saw the man&mdash;the same one who had so quietly
entered the saloon a long time before. "Sure," he said, "there's
the bottle. Barkeep, bring another glass."</p>

<p>The barkeep came up with the glass. He looked at Goodnight,
darkly hating him, and he looked at the other man with some kind of
appeal in his eyes. He said: "I got to lock up sometime, Syd."</p>

<p>But Syd said: "What's your hurry as long as you got
customers?"</p>

<p>Goodnight turned, remembering the poker players. They had gone
and it surprised him to know he hadn't heard them leave. He stared
at the barkeep. "What's the time?"</p>

<p>"Two o'clock," said the barkeep sullenly, and moved away.</p>

<p>"Plenty of time," said the man and drank his drink. He was heavy
at the shoulders; he had white heavy teeth and his grin was white
against the mahogany burn of his skin. His eyes were a smart gray,
and his neck was solid.</p>

<p>"What's on your mind?" said Goodnight.</p>

<p>The heavy one looked at him with some care. He was sly and he
moved easy, studying Goodnight as he moved. "When you're through
here," he murmured, "she'd like to see you."</p>

<p>Goodnight reached into his pocket, glanced at the bottle, and
threw out a pair of silver dollars; they rang dull on the counter
and that warned him of himself. The sound was too far away. He
dropped his knuckles sharply on the bar, feeling little. He stepped
away from the bar and stood a moment. "Let's go see her," he
said.</p>

<p>The heavy man went before him. At the doorway Goodnight looked
back at the barkeep who stood with his hands below the counter. He
stopped dead. Suddenly the barkeep lifted both hands into sight and
placed them on the bar. He sent his hate over the room like a hot
gust of wind but he didn't stir.</p>

<p>The street was dark except for the lone lights of the saloon.
The drunk lay in the dust, curled and shivering as he slept;
starlight turned his face pale. Goodnight looked at him and shook
his head. "There's a man turned into a dog. Whimperin' in his
dreams like a dog. When he was a baby his mother probably said:
'He'll be somebody great when he's big.' What makes men great and
what makes them little?"</p>

<p>The heavy-set Syd said: "He's asleep, which is happiness. What
more could a man want?"</p>

<p>"Not enough," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>Syd stopped, his feet close by the drunk. "What more does a man
want? Or if he wants it, how much chance does he have of ever
gettin' it? If I kicked him he wouldn't feel it. But when he's
awake he's full of misery and everything hurts him. Better to be
asleep."</p>

<p>"Ought to throw a horseblanket over him," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"No good. He'd sleep warm this once&mdash;and every other night
he'd sleep colder and be whinin' for the one warm night he
had."</p>

<p>"What makes him lie in the dust while I stand straight?"
murmured Goodnight. "What's the difference?"</p>

<p>"Somethin' the Lord gave you, friend."</p>

<p>Goodnight shook his head. "There was good in him. He had some
kind of dreams in his head. He rode his horse as a young man and
saw the shadow grow tall on the ground. Some woman smiled at him.
Some man was his best friend. He knew evil and was ashamed. He
could be made to cry over small things that were good. He came from
the same place as the stars. Then he fell and a star went out. Why
is that?"</p>

<p>The heavy man said: "I thought you were drunk, friend."</p>

<p>"The world is a brutal thing. Full of scoundrels and made up of
torment. There is a curse upon it, made by men. The race of man is
small. We're nothing better than ticks scattered in the sage. Maybe
we started clean but now we're livin' in filth made by ourselves
and we breed upon our own ignorance and vice, the smell of which
rises to heaven. One day a big wild wind will blow out all this,
all men and all the foolish little lamps of men, and it will sweep
away all the dirty houses and sand will fill up all men's small
scratches upon the earth. And then the world will be clean again
and maybe someday there'll be another breed better than we
are."</p>

<p>Syd said nothing. He rolled a cigarette. He lighted it and he
drew in a breath of smoke. Then he pointed at the drunk. "None of
all this bothers him," he said practically, and turned over the
street. Goodnight followed him down the dust. Syd paused at the
alley behind the hotel and gave a sharp look around him. He made a
signaling duck of the head to some unseen man in the pre-dawn
blackness and entered the alley. When he came to Rosalia's rear
yard he stopped and touched Goodnight's shoulder. "Go on in," he
said, and faded away.</p>

<p>She was on the porch waiting for him. She rose out of a chair as
he came up. He stumbled on the top step and she caught his arm and
drew him on into the house, her voice murmuring at him. He stood
still in the house's darkness, hearing her move away, and then a
lamp's light came on and he caught the outline of her face as
through a film. He knew then he had taken too much whisky, but even
with the dimness of her face he noticed the long line of her lips,
and the dark, deep color of her eyes as she watched him.</p>

<p>"You wanted to see me?" he asked.</p>

<p>She came forward and took his arm again, guiding him into her
bedroom. "You shouldn't be alone in town tonight."</p>

<p>"I'll crawl into the hotel."</p>

<p>She said: "Lie down there," and put her hand against his chest.
He dropped back on the bed. He pulled up his feet and lay on his
back, his eyes closed. "Late for you to be up," he said.</p>

<p>"It took you a long time to get your drinking done, Frank."</p>

<p>"You been waitin' for that?"</p>

<p>She didn't say anything for a while. Presently he opened his
eyes to find her looking soberly down, darkly in thought. Light
from the lamp glowed through her hair; light drew a full encircling
pair of shadows across her breasts. She was thinking of him and
those thoughts showed, even though the film remained in front of
his eyes.</p>

<p>Her voice took a faintly rough edge. "I had to wait, didn't
I?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He had closed his eyes again; he was falling asleep. Tenderness
showed on her lips and then vanished, and a dark wave of harshness
caught her face&mdash;and then that too vanished. She spoke in a
whisper, as if afraid he might hear, yet wanting him to know. "You
could make me lie down in the mud and wait for you."</p>

<p>She knew he hadn't heard, and the tenderness came again. She
moved to the foot of the bed and pulled off his boots and laid a
quilt over him. She stood at the bed's side, her absorbed glance
upon him&mdash;upon the width of his chest and the relaxed
smoothness of his face. Lying this way, with the black trouble out
of him, he was at peace, and on the edge of smiling. He had a face
for smiling; there was recklessness at the corners of his mouth and
eyes. She saw him as a handsome man.</p>

<p>When she spoke her voice was rough again. "Does it help you to
get drunk?"</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and looked at her. "You know, Rosalia, it's
very funny. A man can't go back."</p>

<p>"Where do you want to go back to?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." He was silent and the shadow of trouble appeared
again in his eyes. "Nor can a man ever wipe the slate clean."</p>

<p>"Are you sorry for killing McSween?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. He turned on the bed, placing his big hand
over his face. He spoke in an uneven way. "It still hurts like hell
to think of my sister. Nothing repairs that. It's a senseless
world. I hate the whole damned race and I'll never lift my hand to
help a living soul. From now on&mdash;" He lifted a fist and closed
it and made a motion.</p>

<p>She stood by and watched him fall asleep, she watched the
trouble die out of him. She brooded over him, knowing the depth of
his hurt, and knowing too on what dangerous ground he stood. For it
was out of such injustice and personal loss that outlaws were made.
He balanced now on the very edge. He was strong and his feelings
were great, so that he would never be a halfway man. If his
bitterness grew still more it would destroy all his kindness and
all his faith, and he would lift his hand against other men and so
would destroy himself. In the beginning she had thought him already
this kind of man, since almost no other kind came to these hills.
Attracted to him, she had accepted him for what he was and had made
up her mind to fight for him. Now that she knew he was not a
fugitive and not an outlaw she was relieved&mdash;yet worried at
what he might become. All her protective instincts rallied; she
wanted to keep him as he was.</p>

<p>She remained over him, resisting the powerful impulse to bend
down and kiss his heavy mouth. Tenderness and wanting swayed her.
She held herself away, grown strong by his need of her, hardened by
his hurts and the things that threatened him. Presently she left
the room and made a bed on the couch in the living room. She blew
out the light, hearing afterwards a slight tapping at the back
door, which stood open. "Ma'm," said a voice, "what you want me to
do?"</p>

<p>"He stays here tonight, Syd. Where's Harry Ide?"</p>

<p>"In the hotel asleep. Room's dark. Those other two fellows that
came with him are bunkin' in the livery stable."</p>

<p>"Get Gabe to watch the street. You go to bed, Syd."</p>

<p>Syd said doubtfully, "Ide ain't here for fun. He's been lookin'
around. You know what I think? I think he figures Goodnight's in
the hotel. He thinks it's Goodnight instead of Niles Brand in that
room. He's lookin' for Goodnight, shore enough. You know why, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"I know why, Syd. Ide thinks Goodnight is going to run things at
Sun now that the old fellow is dead. Get Gabe to watch. You sleep
until breakfast."</p>

<p>Syd delayed to say one more thing: "You know, that's not a bad
fellow. Him&mdash;Goodnight. We had quite a talk when I was
bringin' him here. Yes sir, quite a talk."</p>

<p>"What did he say, Syd?"</p>

<p>Syd grunted. "Can't say I really know. But he sure swamped the
subject, whatever it was. I gather he don't like some things."</p>

<p><br>
Harry Ide kept a rented room in the hotel the year around.
Sometimes it served him as a place to stage a roaring poker game
with the owners of other desert ranches, sometimes he used it as a
shelter when, full of liquor, he could not make the long ride back
to his own place; and sometimes, fearing ambush on his ranch, he
came here to hide away temporarily, to watch his enemies.</p>

<p>He had been in the room that afternoon, seated before the
window; and thus saw Boston Bill arrive; and he spent the next two
hours watching Bill drift into sight, disappear, and show up again.
At supper time Ide went down the back stairs and ate in the
kitchen; and climbed back to his room. When he stepped inside he
found Boston Bill waiting for him.</p>

<p>It gave him a start, although he was far too cool a hand to let
Bill see this reaction. Bill lay stretched, out on the bed, smoking
a cigarette; and Bill grinned at him, enjoying the scene.</p>

<p>"This makes me one ahead of you."</p>

<p>"My turn next time," said Ide, making himself agreeable.</p>

<p>"It should demonstrate something," said Bill. "Anybody can get
the drop on anybody else at any time. So why should we fight at
all? You've got your business and I've got mine."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Ide.</p>

<p>"A proposition then?"</p>

<p>"Depends on what you want."</p>

<p>"I've got what I want," said Bill. "Just stay away from Sun. I
don't care where else you go."</p>

<p>"That," said Ide, "is a bargain."</p>

<p>Bill got off the bed. "You'll have no more trouble from Sun. You
may have trouble from some of the other hill outfits."</p>

<p>"I'll take that in hand."</p>

<p>"It would be a good idea."</p>

<p>"For both of us," agreed Ide. "Whatever I do up there will also
help you. That's why you suggested it, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Bill and moved to the door.</p>

<p>Ide said casually, "You're a damned cool customer, Bill."</p>

<p>"It may be," assented Bill. "I like to do things the easy way. A
shooting is a foolish thing between us."</p>

<p>Ide nodded and watched Bill go. Ide listened to the tall man's
steps drop down the stairs. He went to the window and saw Goodnight
go into the Trail, and afterwards, half an hour or more, he saw
Goodnight on the street. Ide thought: "Very cool&mdash;too cool. I
cannot depend on him. It will be only a matter of time before he
wants me out of the road. Same as he wanted Overman out of the
road. He may try it himself, or he may talk this Goodnight into
trying it."</p>

<p>He thought the whole thing over very carefully as he sat before
the window with his cigar.</p>

<p><br>
Somewhere during the night a flurry of sound struck down through
the woolly layers of sleep to reach Goodnight, like the fall of a
board and its after echo. He heard it as he would have heard the
sounds of a dream, and then it faded out and when he awoke he
remembered nothing.</p>

<p>He looked around him and was puzzled; he saw his bootless feet
showing beyond the bottom of the bedcover. His mouth was dry and
his surroundings strange and he lay a moment, backtracking his
memory. He was in a room whose door was closed, with the sharp
morning chill in it and the smell of coffee and bacon strong in it.
Someone moved around outside the door.</p>

<p>He got up and put on his boots and sat on the edge of the bed
and rolled a cigarette. He remembered the saloon and he rememberd
somthing about a man talking to him; he remembered the night air
and the alley&mdash;and then he knew where he was. He got up and
looked at himself in the bureau mirror and found himself ragged and
needing a shave; but his head was clear and he felt fine, he felt
fresh and sound and ready for anything. He opened the door and
walked across Rosalia's living room to the kitchen. She stood over
the stove, making up breakfast. She heard him and came about, as
grave as he had ever seen her, and she looked at him in her
searching way&mdash;reading what his face might hold.</p>

<p>He smiled at her, the first real smile she had seen from him; he
was embarrassed but still he was cheerful. "I remember passing a
drunk sleeping in the dust last night. When I woke this morning I
thought for a moment maybe that drunk was me, and that maybe I just
imagined I was on a bed. Your bed, isn't it? Nice of you, but I
didn't help you by bein' here."</p>

<p>"This town," she said, "knows better than to question what I
do."</p>

<p>"That's right," he recalled. "It's your town."</p>

<p>"I had one of the boys bring over a razor and shaving soap.
Here's the hot water."</p>

<p>He got the shaving gear and he took the teakettle from the stove
and went to the back porch, shaving by a small mirror tacked to the
porch wall. He washed his face with a blubbering racket and dried
himself. He stood on the porch a moment, watching first sunlight
break the glassy morning air, and for a moment the good feeling
came back with its edge, its promise, its never-ending surprises
and pleasant moments. For a moment it came back; after that the old
recollections took it away and left him with his nagging emptiness.
He returned to the kitchen and took his chair at the table. She had
his coffee for him, his bacon and eggs and fried potatoes, and
baking-powder biscuits out of the oven.</p>

<p>She sat down with him, sipping at a cup of coffee but not
otherwise eating. She was watching him in the same manner he had
noticed earlier, out of extremely grave eyes. "Frank," she said,
"how old are you?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-nine."</p>

<p>"Last night," she said, "you were bitter. So you tried to drink
it away. But you were bitter still when you fell asleep. The thing
that hurt you most was that you couldn't forget your sister.
Nothing wiped it away."</p>

<p>He said: "Who told you about all that?"</p>

<p>"Niles," she said.</p>

<p>"It's a fine breakfast," he said and rose and stood in the
doorway, looking out upon the yard. "Time to go, I guess."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>He held his silence for a matter of minutes or better, and at
last said: "I don't know. I haven't thought of anything else for
three months. Just this one chore. Now it's done and I can go back
to riding. Yet there's nothing in that any more. There's a time for
drifting, when a man feels that way. But when the feeling runs out,
drifting's no good."</p>

<p>"Why," she said, "should you hate the world so much?"</p>

<p>He studied the question and he tried to answer it, and could
not. He lifted his palm and held it open, and closed his fingers
hard down. And opened his palm again. "Nothing there. When I thing
of the misery dealt out to a girl who was straight, who
never&mdash;" He stopped, unsettled by his feeling, brought back
again to his terrible memories. "Why should I feel kind?"</p>

<p>She said: "Don't be like the rest of the men in these hills.
Don't nurse grudges and hate until you're rank inside. You'll be an
outlaw and your own worst enemy. It doesn't matter about many of
those men. They were born with kinks; they'll never be better, only
worse. You weren't meant to snarl at the world, to ride against
people, to destroy and to die alone without friends."</p>

<p>"There is nothing," he said, "for me to hang to."</p>

<p>"Find something. Otherwise if you do nothing but hate and
disbelieve you'll be no better than George McGrant's
dog&mdash;skulking in the darkness, waiting to jump out and bite
somebody. Hate will ruin you."</p>

<p>He said: "I've got to thank you for the meal, and for bein'
kind." He turned again, saying, "Going over to visit Niles. Maybe
play a little rummy."</p>

<p>She said in a thin voice, "Wait&mdash;turn around," and watched
him swing. She had something to tell him, but the telling of it was
a hard thing to accomplish; it quickened her breath and laid a
strictness around her mouth. "Niles," she Said, "was killed last
night. Somebody got to his window and shot through it. He was
asleep."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; WOMEN MEET</h2>

<p class="first">HE stood wholly still as she told him; she saw his
lips stretch thin and very tight. His eyes changed, opening fully
on her with an expression she could not fathom and never afterwards
understood; but at the moment it was as though he hated her and
wished to kill her.</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes out of pity and heard him draw a long
breath. Afterwards he turned from the room. She followed him to the
porch and watched him walk across the yard toward the hotel, very
slowly, with his head down and his shoulders sloped. He went into
the hotel.</p>

<p>Syd came along the back side of the hotel, intending to follow
Goodnight. She checked him with her hand. She murmured: "Stay out
of there." Syd moved away into the alley. Rosalia waited, her
shoulder touching the two-by-two post. She waited with her eyes
fixed to the hotel doorway into which he had gone, patiently and
darkly foreboding, inexpressibly sad. Her lips were long and heavy
and she could easily have cried. What prevented her was her will,
and her fear for him. When he came out of the hotel five minutes
afterwards she was in this same position. He had closed up
entirely; he was soft and painfully quiet with his words.</p>

<p>"You have any idea who did it, Rosalia?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "I know."</p>

<p>He waited and his eyes begged her, but his rigid training in
minding his own counsel told him well enough the question was
foolish. He gave her time to speak, if she chose to speak,
hopefully waiting.</p>

<p>"There were three men in town all night," she said. "Two from
the desert and one from the hills. That's why Syd came to the
saloon to meet you. I knew they were here. We had somebody watching
Nile's window and somebody in the hotel, across from his room. But
the man watching the window stepped away at three o'clock to get a
cup of coffee."</p>

<p>He said: "What'd they want Niles for? He wasn't in any of this.
He was out of it." He thought of it slowly, his mind reaching
forward and around the whole thing. She saw the truth of the matter
come to him in slow stages, forming around his mouth and darkening
his expression. "They were after me. They thought they were
shooting me when they killed Niles."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, not wanting to say it.</p>

<p>He drew in his breath; he let it softly out. "You know who did
it," he said, and again waited with his hope.</p>

<p>"I know," she admitted. "But I'll not tell you."</p>

<p>He spoke in a mild tone, as though it were something which
interested him but did not stir him. "I'll find out."</p>

<p>"I suppose you will. Now you've got something to do, haven't
you? You've got another chore. I'm sorry for you."</p>

<p>He bent his head, puzzled. "Why?"</p>

<p>"The end of the first chore left you empty. How do you think
this one will leave you, if you live through it?"</p>

<p>"Strange talk," he murmured. "Very strange. What would you have
a man do?"</p>

<p>She shook her head and the softness and the sadness went out of
her face; she had been a woman anxious to please him and she had
been a woman whose spirit was warmth and color, whose voice carried
out to him the resonance of her wanting, her depths, her dreams,
her hungers. She had been soft and giving; she had watched him to
find his mood so that she might fit herself to it. Now she stood
straight before him and had her say. "Nothing but what you must do,
Frank. No man can go back on himself. You'll hunt and you'll fight
and you won't rest until you've balanced the ledger for Niles." She
paused and when she spoke again her voice was sharper, "I'm not
arguing against you, am I?"</p>

<p>He shook his head and turned off, walking around the corner of
her house to the street. After he had gone she went into the
kitchen and stopped there. She thought: "No use arguing now. But if
he kills another man out of revenge he'll be an outlaw the rest of
his days. If there was a way . . ."</p>

<p>Sunlight reached the town, filtering into the blistered surfaces
of board walls, glowing upon the molded and edgeless patterns of
the street dust, glittering upon clean windows and grayly burning
against dirty ones. Sunlight was a tide moving inward, breaking the
dullness of alleys and sending its straight fanwise lines farther
and farther around corners; and each up- stepped degree of light
made the town more homely, made it smaller, burning away the false
mystery of night-time until at last Sherman City was only an ugly
yellow break in the timbered greenness flowing down the undulating
pitches of the Owlhorns.</p>

<p>A dog lay in the dust, slightly panting, and rose on its front
legs, too uncomfortable to stay in the sun; but it fell back again,
too lazy to move out of the sun. One rider came into town, threw a
package into the doorway of the hotel and moved back upon his
trail. A storekeeper swept the litter of his shop onto the
sidewalk, a woman opened her second-story window and threw a pail
of water down upon the street, and the gray old man, Gabe, sat
against the base of the Trail, half keeled over but not quite
fallen. He had both eyes shut.</p>

<p>Goodnight thought: "He was on guard last night. He knows." He
went into the Trail, into its stale stillness. The barkeep stood
behind the counter, drearily polishing glasses; he looked at
Goodnight and a fresh job of memory struck the raw spot made the
night before. He stood a moment, staring at Goodnight, suffering
and making a test of his courage again. Presently he dropped his
eyes.</p>

<p>Goodnight said: "Did I pay you for the drinks last night?"</p>

<p>"You paid."</p>

<p>"When did those four poker players leave?"</p>

<p>"An hour before you."</p>

<p>Goodnight had said it casually and followed it with the same
half-interested tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When did Ide pull out?"</p>

<p>"Ide? I never saw Ide. It was his foreman, Jack Drew." Then the
barkeep looked alertly and suspiciously at Goodnight. "How'd you
see him? He was out of sight."</p>

<p>"What was he afraid of?" asked Goodnight. "Boston Bill?"</p>

<p>But the barkeep now guessed he had been used. He gave Goodnight
a sour, half-worried look: "I never said anything about anybody
bein' here. Don't say that I did."</p>

<p>"Never heard you say a thing," promised Goodnight and left the
saloon. Gabe had disappeared from the side of the building; when
Goodnight crossed to the Texican he found the old man stretched
full length on the top of a pool table, face upward. He had his hat
over his eyes. He removed the hat to catch a look at Goodnight.</p>

<p>"You lost a lot of sleep last night," observed Goodnight.</p>

<p>"I lose sleep every time you come to town," grumbled the old
man.</p>

<p>"I'm obliged," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Not to me&mdash;to her. She's the one that tells me stay
up."</p>

<p>Goodnight said: "When did you leave the street to get that cup
of coffee, Gabe?"</p>

<p>"It was Syd. Around three o'clock. And he didn't leave for more
than five minutes. He heard the shot. He came around the hotel
corner and saw the fellow fading up beyond the corral. He took a
shot and missed. Fellow was on a horse by then, going up the hill
road."</p>

<p>"On a sorrel gelding?"</p>

<p>"Who could see a color on a black three-o'clock mornin'?"</p>

<p>"Stockin'-legged front feet?"</p>

<p>Gabe gave him a blue, disillusioned stare. "You're askin' too
many questions," he said and fell back on the table. He pulled the
hat over his face and his voice came muffled through it. "Never
pays for a man to know too much, my friend." Then he said another
thing in a lower voice that Goodnight didn't hear.</p>

<p>"What was that?" said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"I said," growled the old man testily, "you ought to get out of
the country."</p>

<p>Goodnight drifted from the Texican and turned to the stable. He
stepped into the runway's rank cool semidarkness, the sound of his
feet dying at once on the mushy underfooting of loose dirt and
straw. He came to his horse and slid into the stall. He stood
there, not sure of his next move, one hand on the big gray horse's
back. Voices came from the rear of the stable, rolling up slow and
idle&mdash;one tired voice answering another that fed in curious
questions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You up then?"</p>

<p>"I was asleep, but it woke me. I got up . . ."</p>

<p>The horse stirred and looked at Goodnight. He ran his palm along
it shoulders. He remembered Niles saying: "Better get some sleep.
We can play rummy tomorrow." Niles was the last tie he had. These
two&mdash;his sister and Niles&mdash;had come out of the past with
him, out of his boyhood they had been together, the three of them
particularly close. He remembered how much he had wished that his
sister would marry Niles, as Niles had wished. It seemed it would
work that way, until McSween came along. He remembered&mdash;and
this was again a knife slice through him&mdash;that when he
returned from Nevada with the news of her death he had found Niles
playing solitary pool in Cochran's saloon. Niles said nothing,
turned, racked his cue and walked out of the saloon.</p>

<p>A little later Goodnight had found him behind the City Corral,
crying. That was over. These two fine parts of his life were cut
out of him.</p>

<p>". . . I got up and ran forward. He was just goin' past."</p>

<p>"Where was his horse?"</p>

<p>"Down there in front of McDarmid's house. Syd shot once but then
this fellow was aboard and runnin' for timber."</p>

<p>"You saw him?"</p>

<p>Goodnight had heard this talk break against him, had heard
single words of it as he struggled with his own thoughts. Now,
suddenly he caught that last question and grew attentive. There was
a delay and afterwards a sly, slow answer.</p>

<p>"Maybe I did. He was a tall man."</p>

<p>"With a big nose?"</p>

<p>"The nose," said the other, "might have been a big one."</p>

<p>That was all. One of the men came forward through the stable's
gloom and saw Goodnight. He stopped and a queer expression jumped
over his face. He watched Goodnight get his gear and slap it on; he
watched Goodnight go into the saddle. He had a curiosity which at
last made him speak. "You just come in here?"</p>

<p>"Just came in."</p>

<p>"Hear anything?"</p>

<p>"A big wind," said Goodnight. "A big wind comin' over the
mountains." He rode out and paused to give his horse a drink and
afterwards urged the horse around the corner of the Texican and
stopped in front of Rosalia Lind's house. He was about to get down
when she appeared at the front door. He straightened back in the
saddle, removing his hat and holding it. "This may sound queer to
you&mdash;but I don't want to stay here. Will you take care of
Niles?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>He rode to the porch and he reached into his pocket and handed
down a letter to her. "Put that in his pocket. I found it in my
sister's coat in the hotel room in Nevada. She wrote it to Niles
but she hadn't mailed it. So I took it."</p>

<p>"You never gave it to him?"</p>

<p>"Someday I meant to, but that day never came."</p>

<p>"But why not, Frank?"</p>

<p>"He was in love with her. Whatever she said&mdash;whether she
had no regrets or whether she wished it had been different&mdash;it
would have still cut him up. He was cut up enough. I figured to
wait until he got used to the idea of Mary being gone."</p>

<p>"You haven't opened it?"</p>

<p>"It was from Mary to Niles," he said. "Maybe it's best the way
it came out." He shrugged his shoulders, slowly adding, "From Mary
dead, to Niles dead." He drew up his reins, turning the horse. He
checked in and looked back at her. "A man would have to be wiser
than I am to explain why all this happened. And if he found a
reason that sounded fair, he'd be lying. The whole damned world is
a lie." He urged the horse forward until he reached the hotel
window through which the bullet had traveled. He stopped and
studied it&mdash;and went on.</p>

<p>He moved up the trail, along the gulch, into the forest-
shadowed road, the strong smell of pine coming down about him at
once. Night's coolness still held and night's shadows lingered in
the long vistas. Now and then one slanting shaft of sun slid
through to burn a golden patch upon the yellow dust; and after he
passed over this bright spot the rising dust moved upward along the
column of light in cloudy brilliance. He felt better at once with
the timber around him and the town behind him; but at the same time
caution came back to him and therefore he heard the waking echoes
of riders upgrade long before he saw them. He went steadily on and
started around a curve of the road and met them there, Virginia
Overman and Bob Carruth.</p>

<p>They ran down upon him and came to a sharp stop. Bob Carruth
said with some evidence of irritation. "Don't you know better than
to ride down this road like a dreamy parson?"</p>

<p>It was a strange concern, coming from so hard a customer as
Carruth. But it was stranger still when Virginia murmured in one
long outflow of breath, "You're alive!"</p>

<p>She crowded her horse near him and put out her hand, touching
him. Her fingers closed upon his arm in a firm grasp and he saw her
face break out of astonishment and grow gay.</p>

<p>"Am I supposed to be dead?" he asked.</p>

<p>Carruth eyed him closely. "Then who was killed last night in
town?"</p>

<p>"How would that news get to Sun so fast?"</p>

<p>Carruth shrugged the question aside as being wholly immaterial.
"Who was it?"</p>

<p>"A friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Must of been a twin for likeness," commented Carruth, "or
they'd never made that mistake."</p>

<p>"Who are you talking about?"</p>

<p>Carruth closed his strong fleshy lips and said nothing more.
Virginia Overman meanwhile drooped her arm. He watched her smile
and her self-possession return; and afterwards, as a contradiction,
he saw her reserve rise against him. "You're a trouble maker. Can't
you ever stop hunting it? Coming back to the ranch?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Just for a meal, or to stay long enough to be useful?"</p>

<p>"I'll be around," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"I'm going into town," she said. "Wait for me."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," said Carruth.</p>

<p>"No, stay with Frank."</p>

<p>Carruth sighed. "Well, all right. But buy me a pint."</p>

<p>She swung and broke the horse into a canter, sitting in easy
balance and swaying slightly, and so passed around the bend.
Goodnight watched her supple figure until it was beyond sight, and
turned to discover Carruth's eyes fixed upon him. Carruth nodded.
"Just to remind you, Friend Frank. She's as good a rider as you or
me, and damned cooler in managin' things than you think. Well, we
got to wait."</p>

<p>He dismounted and pulled his horse into the timber, Goodnight
following. They rested back on the ground, a small lane between the
trees giving them a view of the road. Somewhere a bird made a
fluttering racket in the forest, to which Carruth gave a moment's
attentive interest.</p>

<p>"How'd the news of the shooting get to Sun?" asked Goodnight.
"It happened at three o'clock. It's eight now. Five hours. Somebody
had to carry it through in a hurry."</p>

<p>Carruth had been lying back in full length. He sat up now and
brought his hands sharply together, the sound of that impact going
on and on through the timber. He grinned. He said, "News travels
that way," and dropped back again.</p>

<p>"Any travelers come by the ranch in the last two-three
hours?"</p>

<p>Carruth said in a wholly lazy voice: "I wouldn't remember about
that."</p>

<p>He was, Goodnight realized, the same as the others; he would
bear no tales and he would not involve himself in a quarrel before
the proper time. He was forty or a little more, stained dark by
weather, with a wrinkled face and a heavy jaw and a short-bristled
mustache.</p>

<p>"You been on Sun long?" asked Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Twelve years of seein' 'em come and go. Scoundrels and
greenhorns and them that wanted adventure and riches, coming out of
the East over the mountain. Pretty soon them that stay alive come
back in a hell of a hurry. Some&mdash;" and he laid the weight of
his judgment on the sentence&mdash;"stay in the Owlhorns. I sure
hope she don't forget that pint."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, completely relaxed&mdash;a man who knew how
to take his quick moments of ease when they came. Goodnight rested
his shoulders against a tree, smoking through a cigarette. He had
his mind wholly on the night's tragedy and its aftermath of little
hints dropped by one man or another. According to the barkeeper in
the Trail, Jack Drew had been in town, he being Harry Ide's rider.
It could have been the desert outfit which had hunted him and had
gotten Niles. His presence on Sun Ranch probably had turned him
into an enemy according to Ide's way of looking at it.</p>

<p>He searched that side of it carefully, giving it all the weight
he could; for in his own mind he thought he knew who had shot Niles
Brand. The stableman had made a break in saying: "He was tall.
Maybe his nose was bigger than usual." That would be Boston Bill,
and Boston Bill hated him for intruding.</p>

<p>One thing did not square. He had not believed Boston Bill would
come from behind, or shoot through a window at a sleeping man. It
was not as he had read Boston Bill; yet the wind blew that way.</p>

<p>Carruth said, "You got enough lives for a cat," and broke into
Goodnight's thoughts. He turned to find the Sun man's gray-green
glance on him, amused but penetrating. "Never figured you'd come
back from Roselle. Never figured you'd come back from Sherman City
this time. You're lucky as hell. No, it ain't luck." His eyes
narrowed. "You're cut out for it."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"For the gun. That's it. I been wonderin' what made you smell
different. You got somethin' kickin' you in the back, makin' a sore
spot. The sore spot will grow. You're goin' to be a bad one,
friend." Then he grinned amiably. "We'll see if you come out of the
next one. There's another man around here who moves faster than you
think." He closed his eyes again and laced his hands across his
belly, and seemed asleep, still smiling.</p>

<p>Virginia put up her horse before the hotel and went inside. She
had one errand but the accomplishment of it bothered her pride and
she fought against her pride and brought her strong will forward
until her mind was made up. She said to Barge Baxter, who ran the
hotel, "Get me a pint for Bob Carruth, Barge," and waited until he
had left the lobby. Then she turned down the hallway, let herself
into the rear yard and arrived at Rosalia Lind's porch. She knocked
at the open doorway. Her breath quickened and her lips moved
together, but this excitement passed and when Rosalia came from the
front of the house and faced her, Virginia was composed.</p>

<p>"I wished," she said in an inexpressive voice, "to say something
to you."</p>

<p>Rosalia said, "Come in," and turned back. She walked into the
living room, Virginia following. She swung, facing Virginia, and
for a moment she watched the other girl. There was no question of
her feelings; she showed her dislike and she revealed it when she
spoke.</p>

<p>"Glad you came. Sooner or later I would have had to come to
you."</p>

<p>Virginia said: "Who was the man killed?"</p>

<p>"Niles Brand, Frank's friend."</p>

<p>Virginia frowned. "I didn't know about him. How did he get into
it?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't Niles they were after."</p>

<p>"That's what I wanted to know," said Virginia Overman. "The
bullet was meant for Frank, and hit this other man?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rosalia.</p>

<p>"Was Frank in the room at the time?"</p>

<p>"No. He slept here last night."</p>

<p>Virginia showed the effect of the answer by a flattening of her
lips. She had been hurt, and the knowledge of that pleased Rosalia
and made her smile. She was as cool as the woman who had come here
to face her down&mdash;she was as rough a fighter as she had always
known Virginia Overman to be. She had no illusions concerning
Virginia Overman, no liking and little tolerance. Therefore it
satisfied her to see the other woman betray her feeling.</p>

<p>"I wish you hadn't told me that," said Virginia. "I wasn't
necessary."</p>

<p>"It is what you came to find out, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Virginia.</p>

<p>"Then why did you come?" insisted Rosalia, harsher with her
words.</p>

<p>"Was Boston Bill in town last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rosalia.</p>

<p>"When the shot was fired?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She watched Virginia's expression change again. Her mouth lost
its firmness, her lips came apart slightly and she seemed to be
struggling with fear. She lost color and her eyes grew round. She
shook her head, speaking in a fainter voice. "You're to blame for
it."</p>

<p>"I thought you might mention that," said Rosalia.</p>

<p>"You are," repeated Virginia. "Bill's been down here before.
Visiting you. I always knew that, for when he came back he never
was quite the same toward me."</p>

<p>"He's been down here," said Rosalia. "He's that kind of man,
thinking himself very charming. I suppose he thought a woman
couldn't resist him. That's his weakness, among other weaknesses.
But he never came into my house at my invitation. He walked in of
his own accord, and he soon walked out. I don't think he knows how
close he came on one or two occasions to being shot by my people.
He has never been in Sherman City without being watched every step
of the way. If I had ever encouraged him he never would have come
back to you.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry about that, Virginia. He got no help from me.
I thought him a fool. If your tastes are different, you're welcome
to him."</p>

<p>"You're to blame," repeated Virginia. "When he knew Frank
Goodnight was seeing you it made him jealous. He came to town last
night and shot the wrong man."</p>

<p>"He can thank God he didn't shoot Frank," said Rosalia. "Do you
think he would be alive now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," said Virginia. "That's the way of it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rosalia.</p>

<p>Virginia's voice grew scornful. "So he sleeps in your house. Is
that the way you hold a man?"</p>

<p>"It would be nice to know&mdash;if I held him."</p>

<p>"Why else did he come?"</p>

<p>"He was drunk," said Rosalia. "Not knowing there were four men
in town waiting for him. I brought him here."</p>

<p>"Drunk?" breathed Virginia.</p>

<p>"Do you know why? Because he was troubled. He had shot a man,
out of revenge, and the satisfaction that should have come from it
didn't come. Everything was the same as it was before. He couldn't
understand why. So he got drunk, thinking maybe he'd find out why.
But he didn't." She paused, and went on. "You came here to ask me
to let him alone, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Virginia, "but I suppose it was a foolish hope.
You'd do anything to hurt me."</p>

<p>"Now I'll say something you won't understand. If you keep him on
Sun he'll soon go bad, doing your dirty chores."</p>

<p>"I have got to defend myself against Harry Ide. Is that a dirty
chore?"</p>

<p>"You've got Boston Bill and all the men you need."</p>

<p>Virginia shook her head. "I'm not sure about that."</p>

<p>"What you mean is that you are not sure of Boston Bill," pointed
out Rosalia. "I can see all the way through you. You use Frank to
whip Bill. Bill is cool to you and you think perhaps another man
will waken him."</p>

<p>Vireinia stared at her, revealing nothing. Virginia said:
"Maybe."</p>

<p>"Or perhaps you wish two to choose from. That would please you a
great deal. All you've had up there so far have been bad ones not
worth a second notice. Yes, I think that is perhaps something in
your mind. As I said, you're stone cold, afraid to give, or too
selfish."</p>

<p>"I think," said Virginia, "I know a better way to handle this.
I'll have Bob Carruth tell Frank about you."</p>

<p>A storm, a fury, an actual hatred came across Virginia Overman's
smooth, confidently beautiful face. She pressed her mouth together,
making it small, making it unlovely. She said: "What have you done
to him?"</p>

<p>"I've kissed him," said Rosalia.</p>

<p>"I can do that," said Virginia. "Or any woman."</p>

<p>Rosalia showed a gleam of interest in her eyes. "Why don't you?
It would tell him more about you in a minute&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Virginia, "I think I'll have Bob Carruth speak to
him."</p>

<p>"And what could Bob say?"</p>

<p>Virginia turned, walking to the door. She swung there, a
suppressed triumph on her face. "I think anything he said of you
would be true. But true or not, a word from a man to another man, a
change of his tone, can damn any woman."</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Rosalia and watched Virginia Overman go away.
She stood still, weary to the bone from the meeting. She had
matched the iron in Virginia Overman, she had struck as she had
been struck, and now the letdown was something in her flesh and
nerves. Virginia would do as she said she would do. She would send
Carruth to Goodnight with some story or other and that would be
enough. A woman's reputation never stood up under that kind of
attack.</p>

<p>Then she thought: "If he believes the story it will mean that I
was never anything to him but a woman who kissed him. But if he has
any tender thoughts about me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Syd came to the doorway, knocking. He said: "She don't know it
but there's eight of Ide's men in town, watchin' her."</p>

<p>"They'll leave her alone," said Rosalia.</p>

<p>"But whut they in town for?" suggested Syd. "Somethin's boilin'
up."</p>

<p>"Something's always boiling up," she said.</p>

<p>"Sure a funny country."</p>

<p>"Funny," she said, and made him throw his head back by the
sudden energy of her cry. "Funny? Go on away, Syd!"</p>

<p><br>
Virginia met Goodnight and Carruth on the road and the three went
along at a climbing walk, saying almost nothing. At noon they came
into Sun yard, both men stopping at the bunkhouse. Virginia
continued to the porch of the main house, but before she went
inside she turned and looked back. Goodnight had a fair picture of
her at the moment, sunlight strong against her, lightening her
hair. She glanced directly at him, asking for his attention and
holding it; her lips were strong against her skin, and half
smiling. She knew how she looked to him, for she saw the reaction
on his face and she thought: "I can make him forget."</p>

<p>Bob Carruth swung away, but he turned back and stared at her,
impressed by what he saw. He cast a quick side glance at Goodnight,
and then looked keenly again at Virginia. He was a smart, practical
man and all this he had seen before; and knew now what it meant. He
cut behind Goodnight, bent for the mess room; realizing that had he
gone in front of Goodnight, spoiling the effect she was creating
for him, he later would have caught hell from her. She was a woman
who wanted her own way. He grinned to himself.</p>

<p>The effect of it rolled powerfully through Goodnight. He didn't
know why and he didn't ask himself why. Simply she stood in the
sunlight, rounded and tall, a woman untouched and warming before
his glance and opening to him&mdash;graceful and lovely and
attracted to him. It was all there in that single sunlit
picture.</p>

<p>He heard her voice call to Carruth. "Step in a moment, Bob."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; WRONG TURN</h2>

<p class="first">CARRUTH dragged his spurs over the yard, raking up
little snakeheads of dust. He followed Virginia into the big room
of the house; he took off his hat and watched her with his wary
eyes. She faced him but she looked beyond him for a moment, through
the door, and her eyes traveled slowly left to right. He heard
somebody moving across the yard and then he knew she was watching
Goodnight. The information mildly surprised him and his eyelids
crept nearer as he thought about it and he studied the expression
on Virginia's face with a greater interest. At this moment her
attention was completely taken by what she saw. She didn't realize
she was giving herself away to Carruth. He thought: "Why, she's
interested in the man. It ain't entirely business."</p>

<p>She brought her glance back to Carruth and looked at him a
thoughtful moment. "You've been here a long while, Bob. You're the
only one I can really trust."</p>

<p>"I knowed you when you could just hang on a horse," he said. But
to himself he reflected: "She wants somethin' of me." He knew all
the signals. When she wanted something of a man she was always
nice; she always made the man feel she was interested in him. He
had seen her do it many times.</p>

<p>"I need a little help," she said. "You're the only one who can
do what I wish."</p>

<p>That was familiar too. She made a man important. And still, as
clearly as he realized all this, he felt himself warm to her. After
all, he had known her for many years. "Do what I can," he said.</p>

<p>She watched him steadily, holding him to her with her eyes.
"This Lind woman has seen him. He stayed in her house last night.
You know her kind."</p>

<p>Carruth dropped his glance and felt embarrassment; it was
unseemly to be discussing it and therefore he said nothing. He was
a rough-and-tumble sort of man with many sinful episodes behind
him, yet he had his own notions of propriety.</p>

<p>"She hates me and she's trying to pull Goodnight off Sun,
knowing we're fighting for our lives. She wants to cripple us." She
waited until he lifted his glance again. She was unhurriedly
persuasive, she appealed to his loyalty, to his partisanship,
saying the one thing which she was sure would arouse him. "I think
she's on Harry Ide's side of the fence. I've suspected it for a
long while. We can't afford to have Goodnight go, Bob. He's the
sort we need."</p>

<p>"What sort?"</p>

<p>"He's not afraid to use a gun."</p>

<p>"No," admitted Carruth, "he ain't afraid of that. But you got a
lot more help, if you need it. I'd guess Boston Bill would take the
job any time you said so."</p>

<p>"You know Boston Bill," she said.</p>

<p>He scratched the back of his head, wondering how she meant that.
She observed his uncertainty and added: "If we ask a favor of him
he'll move in for good. We'll never get rid of him."</p>

<p>He put a point-blank question at her. "Always looked to me like
you encouraged the man. Don't you want him?"</p>

<p>She had a self-confidence that never failed to draw his
reluctant admiration. She never was shaken off her feet, she never
seemed to forget her own interests. She looked at him with a poker
expression, with no trace of womanly confusion. "I'd never permit
Bill to think that I needed anything from him. He's too sure of
himself as it is. That would make him worse. If he comes to me, he
comes on his hands and knees."</p>

<p>"Why, my Godfrey," murmured Carruth, completely astonished at
her frankness. Then he had his practical doubts. "You'll never find
him on his hands and knees, Virginia. Not him."</p>

<p>"Wait and see," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, now, about Goodnight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sometime today when you are together, just drop the hint that
many men have slept in Rosalia's bed."</p>

<p>Carruth blushed. The skin of his face was too darkly sunburned
to show it, but the back of his neck flamed red. He could not meet
her glance. He lowered his eyes and he was so confused that he
began to reach into the wrong pockets for his tobacco. She waited
for his answer. Not receiving it, she spoke more insistently. "It's
true enough. Why look so odd about it?"</p>

<p>He said doggedly: "I don't know that it is true. Neither do you.
In fact, it ain't true. She's a straight woman."</p>

<p>"Bob," she said, now severe, "who are you working for?"</p>

<p>Now he lifted his eyes, driven against the stubborn wall of his
principles. "If a man spoke of any woman like that, in my presence,
I'd bat his ears down to his boot tops. Any man speaking of any
woman. I'll be damned if I do it. I will say furthermore, Virginia,
I'm ashamed to hear it from you. You ought to go wash your mouth
with soap."</p>

<p>She was silently and enormously angry with him. Her eyes laid
threat against him and she attempted, without speaking, to bend him
to her will. It was for him a bad moment, but he kept his glance
steadily upon her, until her whole manner changed and softened. She
shrugged her shoulders and spoke as if none of it mattered. "Forget
it, Bob."</p>

<p>He shook his head and turned out of the room. The two other Sun
men&mdash;Tap and Slab&mdash;were in the mess hall with Goodnight.
Bob Carruth joined them and ate his quick dinner. Nobody said a
word. Tap and Slab ate, rose and departed and Goodnight soon
followed. Carruth filled his coffee cup a second time from the big
pot on the table and nursed it between his hands, drinking like a
Chinaman. He was greatly disturbed; he had been left with a bad
feeling. Virginia was a headstrong girl, a dominating type of young
woman, always cold-blooded about getting her way. That was nothing
new to him; he had always known it. But this was a different thing.
It wasn't clean.</p>

<p>It shook him. His own life was filled with its gray things, its
unpleasant memories, its moments of lust and evil; still, he had
always been loyal. But that loyalty, being the one good thing in
him, needed something equally good to fix itself upon. Old Man
Overman, for all his narrowness and his moments of bad judgment,
had been a righteous soul in whom Carruth had believed, now it was
different.</p>

<p>He brooded over his second cup of coffee. The China cook came
in, irritated at Carruth's dawdling, and displayed it by the way he
cleared the table. Carruth gave him a bleak stare. "Quit rattling
those damned dishes, Louie." His mind had jumped over to Goodnight
and he considered the man in relation to what he knew. There was
something inside Virginia's head he didn't quite reach. She wanted
to use Goodnight because she was afraid to ask a favor of Boston
Bill. That made almost no sense to Carruth in view of what he knew
about her. She never had been afraid of anything, never had doubted
her ability to handle any situation. When her will was set, she was
as single-minded and as tough as any man he had known; and he had
known some really tough ones. It had always seemed to him that she
had wanted Boston Bill. He had on many an occasion noticed her eyes
follow Bill around the yard and he thought she had long ago made up
her mind to possess him. It was just a question of getting the man
on her own terms. He still thought that.</p>

<p>He backed away and took a sight on the problem from a different
angle. Boston Bill wanted the ranch and meant to have it, one way
or another. Goodnight's presence angered Bill and the arrogant,
big-nosed man had already made up his mind to get rid of Goodnight.
Already had tried, Carruth guessed. That was the explanation of the
shooting in Sherman City. Well, then, Virginia was spotting one man
against the other&mdash;for what reason Carruth at least could not
explain. But it left Goodnight in a hole.</p>

<p>He sighed and rose from the table and walked into the yard. Tap
and Slab sat on the shady side of the bunkhouse. Goodnight had gone
on to the corral. Carruth crossed the yard toward him, shaping up a
smoke as he traveled. He stopped at the corral, stretching his lips
back from his teeth as he inhaled the cigarette smoke.</p>

<p>"Frank," he said, "I'm never a hand to like another man very
much. Not my style. But I like you as well as any. Here's my
advice, which I wouldn't bother to give anybody else. Get off the
ranch."</p>

<p>Goodnight stared beyond Carruth, at the green wave of trees
flowing down the hill. He had his eyes almost shut and daylight
danced in them. Heat burned down upon the clearing and flashed on
the panes of the main house; the air lay thin and dry and the smell
of dust and pitch was everywhere. "I know," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Doubt if you do."</p>

<p>Goodnight looked down at Carruth. "She's afraid of Boston
Bill."</p>

<p>Carruth wanted to say something about that. He saw that she had
gotten into Goodnight. The glance she had given him, the picture
she had made for him as she stood on the porch, had done the trick.
He tried to frame something in his mind that would make it clear to
the tall man, but his loyalty stopped him. All he could say was:
"You ain't got a high card in your hand."</p>

<p>"Always had luck in the draw. Anyhow, it's too late to
leave."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Carruth. But in a moment he heard the first advance
echoes of a party coming down the hill. He said, "You got good
ears," and swung about, waiting. It was Boston Bill's outfit, he
guessed, and a big one from the sound it made. A man's "Hyee" came
on ahead, quite loud in the heat-stretched air, and a moment later
the party broke out of timber into the yard, Boston Bill at the
head.</p>

<p>He was always a smart one. His glance swept the yard, saw Tap
and Slab, saw Carruth, and came to a full-centered aim on
Goodnight. For a moment it appeared he would ride straight on at
Goodnight. His expression and the position of his body telegraphed
the intention, but in another instant Virginia came to the porch,
calling his interest to her. He dropped to the ground, high and
confident as he walked to the porch. The two went inside the
house.</p>

<p>The rest got down&mdash;there were twelve in the bunch&mdash;and
scattered around the yard, soon dropping into the dusty shade, soon
smoking or soon falling back for quick catnaps. Carruth drew out
the last smoke of his cigarette and spoke, not looking at
Goodnight: "This is it. Too late for you."</p>

<p>Virginia came to the doorway. "Frank," she said, "will you come
here please?"</p>

<p>"Showdown," murmured Carruth. "He's made up his mind."</p>

<p>"He made it up the other day," answered Goodnight, and walked
over fhe yard.</p>

<p>He found Virginia standing in a corner of the room when he
reached it; he found Boston Bill swung around, waiting for him to
come. Boston Bill's fair face showed the brittle scruffing of
sunlight and the deeper flush of an anger produced by some previous
argument with the girl. He was very watchful, he was on edge, and
Goodnight got the clear impression that Boston Bill expected
trouble to break. There was a round-topped center table near Bill;
he had his left hip against it, the top of his holstered gun
rubbing against it, and he had his hand dropped on the table, close
by the gun's butt.</p>

<p>Virginia said in her calm, self-certain way: "Bill's been doing
some talking. Perhaps you ought to listen to it."</p>

<p>Boston Bill said: "I'm not repeating myself to strangers,
Virginia."</p>

<p>"This man," said Virginia, "is foreman of Sun."</p>

<p>"Is he?" murmured Boston Bill. "I don't recognize the title. I'm
talking to you, not to him."</p>

<p>"You'll deal with him," she said.</p>

<p>"No," said Boston Bill, "I'll do nothing with him. You're a
clever girl, Virginia. You've put him up as a dummy between us. I
won't waste my time. You're the one who says yes or no."</p>

<p>"Not unless my foreman agrees," she said. "Talk to my foreman,
Bill."</p>

<p>She treated him coolly. She stood away from him, throwing her
will against his will. Goodnight had no knowledge of the game being
played between them; it went on beneath the surface, the two of
them violently struggling for some kind of control. Boston Bill's
face showed a growing stubbornness. His cheek muscles grew bunched
and his mouth lay tight beneath the spectacular arch of his nose.
Goodnight remained still, studying the man, not yet certain of the
other's nerve. The scene could end here if Boston Bill had as much
brutality in him as he had ambition. All Bill had to do was lift
his voice, bring in part of his crew&mdash;and the whole thing
would be over.</p>

<p>But the man dallied with his thoughts and presently Goodnight
noticed the girl's expression shade away into something that looked
like triumph. She thought she had Bill beaten.</p>

<p>Boston Bill made up his mind and turned on Goodnight. "I'm not
talkin' to you, I'm telling you. My outfit camps here and I'll do
what Virginia can't do&mdash;which is fight for this place against
Harry Ide. There's no room for you. Ride on."</p>

<p>The girl's expression again grew solid and resisting. She put
her glance on Goodnight, waiting for him to speak. This was why she
had hired him&mdash;for just this moment. What was he supposed to
do? He turned his head slightly, noticing now that Bob Carruth had
come to the door of the room. Goodnight murmured: "Step in and shut
the door, Bob."</p>

<p>Carruth moved in and pushed the door behind him. Boston Bill's
head lifted and he threw an irritated glance at Carruth; the next
instant his attention rushed back to Goodnight.</p>

<p>"I notice," said Goodnight, "you're left-handed."</p>

<p>Boston Bill studied the remark, suspicious of it, fast- thinking
of it. He nodded slightly.</p>

<p>"It is the second time I have noticed it," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>Boston Bill showed a small, passing puzzlement. He said: "What
of it?" But he was keyed up, giving Goodnight the full weight of
his thoughts. The man faced him, quietly,
expressionlessly&mdash;meaning everything or meaning nothing. "No
use of this going on," Goodnight said. "You have made up your mind
about me. I have done the same about you. This is the place to have
it done. Back away from the table and give yourself room to
draw."</p>

<p>Boston Bill kept his head still; his eyes rolled aside, catching
view of Carruth, and rolled back to meet Goodnight. He said softly:
"You've got an extra man."</p>

<p>Goodnight threw an order over his shoulder. "Step outside,
Bob."</p>

<p>He listened to the door's opening and its closing. The girl's
face was intent, with one small line showing on her forehead. She
had changed her attention to Boston Bill; she was watching him with
an engrossed interest, without sympathy and without any feeling
that Goodnight could observe. She was probably wondering&mdash;as
he himself still wondered&mdash;if Boston Bill's nerves would hold
or fail.</p>

<p>Boston Bill smiled a starved, wintery smile. "My outfit's
outside. How far do you think you can get?"</p>

<p>"You talk too much," said Goodnight. "Step back and draw."</p>

<p>"I told you before," said Boston Bill, "I pick my fights when I
please."</p>

<p>"Better pick this one now," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Probably," said Boston Bill, very cool, "you can handle a gun
faster than I. My impression is you've had more training at it. I'd
be foolish to step into that, wouldn't I? I'm not drawing. If you
like to shoot your ducks on the ground, go ahead."</p>

<p>"I will," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"I doubt it," answered Boston Bill. "Your kind never likes to
shoot without getting the other man to draw first. It is just a way
you justify a shooting&mdash;a convention that is supposed to make
everything fair and square. I'll not supply you with the
excuse."</p>

<p>"You guess wrong," said Goodnight. "That rule applies to men
standing equal. It doesn't cover a man that stood on the right side
of a hotel window and shot left-handed through the glass at a man
asleep on a bed."</p>

<p>The sharp glitter of angry, tight amusement died out of Boston
Bill's face. He stood grave and indrawn; he stood like a man
hollowed out. He looked at the girl. He said in a queer voice: "You
brought this on. Do you like it?" Then he pulled his attention back
to Goodnight and strain narrowed his face and he had nothing more
to say.</p>

<p>It was the girl who broke the tension by coming forward until
she was between the two. She turned to Boston Bill. "He would kill
you. Don't you see it on his face?" She swung quickly to Goodnight.
"I don't want a shooting."</p>

<p>"Out of your hands," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"No. Bill will not take charge here. You are still foreman. You
see, Frank, I still have one weapon he's afraid of. The hill
ranchers are friendly to him, but they are all people who came here
with my father. My word would turn them against Bill. He knows
that. If he moves into Sun without my authority he'll have no help
from the hills."</p>

<p>"Nothing to do with the present moment," said Goodnight. "Stand
aside. I want this settled."</p>

<p>"I want nothing to happen here," she said.</p>

<p>He considered her and found no answer. She had hired him to
protect her against Boston Bill; she was now protecting Boston
Bill. It made everything complicated. He had known since daybreak
that Boston Bill had shot Niles and that knowledge gave him his
clear line of action. This was the time to settle it, for if Boston
Bill walked out of the door alive, it would only be to give a
signal that would set the rest of the crowd against him. He would
be trapped. Still, the girl wanted no shooting. In addition, he no
longer knew where she stood.</p>

<p>"There's no necessity of my staying on Sun any longer," he said.
"You can use this man for your work."</p>

<p>He backed to the door, noting the change on her face.
Disturbance came and unsettled her perfect assurance. "I don't want
you to go."</p>

<p>"Then you should not have interfered. I'm riding off the place.
But I won't be riding far and I'll make a point of meeting you, my
friend." He said the last of it to Boston Bill, opening the door as
he talked. The girl shook her head and for the first time he saw
helplessness come to her.</p>

<p>"I didn't think," she said, "you'd run."</p>

<p>"You should not have interfered," he repeated. "Or maybe you had
better make up your mind what you want." He closed the door as he
stepped to the porch. He said to Carruth waiting there, "Stick
right here until I reach my horse. I'm leaving."</p>

<p>"He froze you out?" murmured Carruth, not quite believing
it.</p>

<p>Goodnight paused and threw him a black glance. "We'll see," he
said. He went down the steps, the men of Boston Bill's crowd
watching him from their scattered places along the yard. He made no
attempt to hurry; he cut behind the bunkhouse to his horse and rose
to the saddle and rode back over the yard. They were still
watching, and one man had risen and started for the house. He
circled the mess hall and faced the trail. As he reached the first
edge of timber&mdash;the trail rising and curling before
him&mdash;he heard Boston Bill's voice rush over the yard.</p>

<p>"Come on&mdash;come on."</p>

<p>He went up the slope in a slow run, with the scurry and scuff of
men and horses coming off the yard, and the murmuring of men's
voices growing. He reached a bend of the trail and ran around it,
and faced another sharp rise. His horse fell to a walk on this
grade but he dug in his spurs and made it go. The trees softened
the sounds rising from the lower level.</p>

<p><br>
Boston Bill rushed from the front door, yelling at his outfit; and
all of them sprang up from their sleepy reclining and in a moment
were gone, leaving behind the slow-settling streamers of dust in
the still air. Slab and Tap remained by the bunkhouse, astonished
at the unexpected action and not quite certain of what had
happened. Bob Carruth was on the porch, caught in the swift play.
Virginia had rushed out on the heels of Bill, had run over the yard
after him. She had kept calling to him; she had tried to catch his
arm as he reached his horse. He had swung around her, his left
stirrup grazing her as he rushed on. Virginia, standing in the
heavy yellow dust, cursed him until he was out of sight.</p>

<p>Bob Carruth watched her turn and come back to him. He saw the
fury that blackened her eyes and pulled the blood from her face
until it was dead white. She breathed heavily and she gave him a
bitter, killing glance&mdash;hating him because he was the only
thing near her to receive her temper. He stood still, knowing this
girl's willfulness but shocked at the depth of rage she showed.
Violence changed her until she was no longer pretty, no longer
admirable. He sighed and shook his head.</p>

<p>"You played hell when you brought those two together."</p>

<p>"I should have let Frank shoot him! I should have let that
happen!"</p>

<p>"One of 'em," said Carruth, "is damned soon goin' to get shot."
She made him sour and embittered. "Comes of you fiddlin' with two
men. No sense&mdash;no sense at all. You think you're God to make
men come together and back up like you want? What in hell did you
expect?"</p>

<p>"The dog," she said in a shaking, husky voice. "The dog!"</p>

<p>"Which one you talkin' about now?"</p>

<p>"He was afraid of Goodnight. He smiled and tried to cover it,
but he was afraid of his life. I saved him, and then he betrayed me
the moment Goodnight left. He's yellow, Carruth, and he's
dirty."</p>

<p>"That's something you should of figured before you started this
business. Friend Goodnight's goin' to get killed." He drew his lips
back from his heavy white teeth. "What you think of that? What you
think of your schemin' now?"</p>

<p>She wilted before his eyes. Her shoulders dropped and the life
went out of her face. She turned from him and walked over to her
horse. She stood a moment beside the horse and he saw that she was
crying. He had not seen her cry before and therefore he knew she
was hurt, and this pleased him and he silently wished that the hurt
would stay on; for by now he had lost all his loyalty to her and
saw her as a cold woman whose scheming was about to cause the death
of a man. She went up to the saddle and looked at him. "That can't
happen," she said. "I won't let it."</p>

<p>"You'll play hell," he told her. She was out in the meadow,
running north, and he shouted it at her again. "You'll play
hell!"</p>

<p>He kept his eyes on her as he walked back to the bunkhouse. Tap
and Slab never said a word; all this had rolled over them like a
wave of water and they had not yet pulled clear of it. She was,
Carruth decided, going up to Ned Tower's place to have him spread
the news to the hill people. Maybe that would work, maybe it would
be too late. He turned to Slab. "Take my long-legged buckskin and
go down to Sherman City. You tell Rosalia Lind whut's
happened."</p>

<p>"Whut'l! she do about it?" asked Slab.</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;go on!"</p>

<p>He went into the bunkhouse and found his pipe and he filled it
and lighted it and found some comfort in the heavy smoke. He came
back to the yard, standing beside Tap. Tap said something but he
paid no attention to it, in fact he really never heard it. The
point was, he decided, Virginia had found out at the last moment it
was Goodnight she wanted, not Boston Bill. She apparently hadn't
known it before. She had hauled the two men together so she could
compare them, maybe have them ram each other all over the place to
prove what they were to her. Then she had got trapped. The wrong
man had won and she had just discovered it.</p>

<p>He shook his head, a little bit sick of the thing, and he went
over to his own horse and got aboard. As soon as he hit the saddle
he felt somewhat more hopeful; he'd follow after Boston Bill and
maybe get a line on what was happening; maybe maneuver around so
that he could do Goodnight a useful turn in a pinch. Going into the
timbered hill trail he remembered Virginia's cursing; that had been
a rock-bottom display of what she was. He had never seen a woman so
thoroughly turn herself inside out.</p>

<p>"That damned Goodnight," he thought soberly, "thinks she's
something particular. If he pulls out of this he might marry
her."</p>

<p><br>
Slab was a man neither very thoughtful nor very bright and
therefore when he was given an order his small mind closed down
upon it and it became the law of his life until he had fulfilled
it. He never asked questions and he never stopped to debate the
wisdom of what he was told to do. Simply, he took his orders and
set forth upon their performance. Had Bob Carruth told him to ride
his horse into the middle of the creek and remain there, Slab would
have done so in full confidence that Carruth had a good reason for
asking it.</p>

<p>So, he set out at full tilt for Sherman City and reached the
town with his horse dead-beat and himself pretty well pounded up.
He whirled before Rosalia's house, dropped to the ground and ran to
the door. When the girl appeared, Slab said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Carruth told me to tell you that this Goodnight is in a jack
pot. He got crosswise of Boston Bill. They had an argument on the
ranch. Goodnight got to his horse and jumped for timber with Bill
and nine-ten of Bill's bunch after him. They're in the hills now,
somewhere."</p>

<p>Rosalia said: "Why did Carruth want me to know that?"</p>

<p>Slab opened his mouth to speak, and found nothing to say. He
closed his mouth and he searched himself for answer, but the
searching produced nothing. He had been told to come here and
deliver his message. That was all. Nowhere along the hard ride had
he given an instant's thought to the reason behind the message. He
spread out his hands before her and he murmured: "Damned if I know.
I just told you what I was supposed to tell you." He turned back,
got his horse and led it up to the Trail. He stepped inside the
saloon and wigwagged for a drink. He took his drink and he
murmured, "Ah," and eased himself against the bar. He said aloud:
"I bet that's the fastest that trip's ever been rode."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked the barkeep.</p>

<p>"Don't know," confessed Slab. "But it sure was a fast ride."</p>

<p>Rosalia stood on the porch, watching Slab go to the saloon. Gabe
drifted from the alley and said: "Anything important?"</p>

<p>"No," she said and went into the house, wondering why Bob
Carruth had thought of her. She thought of Carruth for a little
while, knowing the man's toughness. She said to herself: "He would
never lift a hand to help any man, unless he liked the man well.
Therefore he must have come to like Frank. Nor would he have
bothered to send a message to me unless Frank was in genuine
trouble."</p>

<p>It was a compliment, from Carruth. It was a warning, too, that
things had gone bad for Goodnight. She closed the front door and
turned and put her shoulders against it. She looked across the room
at the wall, grave and deeply troubled. Goodnight was clearly
before her; she saw him, the shape of his body and the tone of his
voice and the things which tormented him. She thought: "I could
help him. I could send men up there to fight for him."</p>

<p>But she came slowly to her painful answer. She had given him
more than she had given any other man. The rest of it was up to
him. She could not give more. He had gone into the hills of his own
free will. He would have to come out of the hills the same way.
Perhaps he would never come back; perhaps he had not wanted to come
back. If he came back she would be here; if he wanted her, she
would be here.</p>

<p>"He went there because he wanted to. He will come back if he
wants to. He will live or he will die. If I helped him now he would
resent it, or be in debt to me. I will do nothing. It is up to
him."</p>

<p>She remained still, inwardly protesting at her own decision, but
her will was strong, and held her fast.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; DEEP IN THE
OWLHORNS</h2>

<p class="first">GOODNIGHT had a quarter-mile lead on Boston Bill's
men. He heard the sound of their pursuit come steadily behind but
at the end of a twenty-minute run he thought he had increased his
lead. One horse and one man made better time than a crowd.</p>

<p>He stayed with the main trail upward and it took him presently
to one of the many small and narrow meadows creasing these hills;
he saw nothing on the meadow and ran across it into farther timber.
The main trail continued upward again but at this point he wheeled
aside, into the timber, and paralleled the meadow until he had
reached its far end. Here, sheltered by the trees, he gave his
horse a blow and watched the open area over which he had recently
come.</p>

<p>Boston Bill broke over it first, two other men closely behind
him. These three crossed and disappeared and it was a full minute
before the rest of the group came plugging along. This last group
halted and seemed to be talking. Presently one of the men who had
been with Boston Bill rode back and said something, whereupon the
party moved onward at a jaded walk and entered the trees.</p>

<p>The timber around Goodnight was old first-growth pine, massive
at the butt and rising in flawless line toward a mass of top
covering which made a solid umbrella against sunlight; there was
little underbrush and at certain angles he was able to look a
hundred or two hundred yards away. The sound of Bill's men faded in
gradually diminishing echoes until the hot silence of the hills lay
fast upon everything, until the breathing of his own horse seemed
loud. It would be a matter of time, of course, until Bill would
backtrack and eventually discover his solitary set of tracks on the
spongy humus. Considering it, he set his course steadily east,
toward the Owlhorns' heights. Up there the country would be more
greatly broken and thus afford better shelter.</p>

<p>He knew none of this land, yet he had no concern. All his days
from boyhood onward had been a pattern of hills and desert, of
silence and heat and cold, of strange voices speaking out of
night's pit and pale far images in the sun glare. He could say of
himself that his proper home was wherever night found him, that his
accustomed hearth was the rim of a campfire. Never in all his
traveling had he felt the need of more than this; and never, when
sleeping inside some town upon the trail, had he ceased to wish for
the trail.</p>

<p>Far away was one starved echo. Riding, he listened for its
repetition and heard no more. The red-barked trees ran solemnly
before him and somewhere high above the arch of boughs afternoon
blazed; here the air was blue-shadowed and still. He came presently
upon the relic of an ancient wagon road, its twin ruts wiggling
before him; and later struck the fallen-in wreckage of a
log-and-shake cabin. Near it was a square patch of ground enclosed
by stakes; and centered in the patch was the mark of a grave, its
headboard, once white, lying rotten upon the earth. A pine stood
hard by and when he raised his eyes he saw an ax imbedded in the
bark. Once, long ago, some man had driven it full into the wood and
had walked away, and had never returned.</p>

<p>By degrees the country roughened and the pines turned smaller
and ravines began to come down toward him. He held to the crest of
the ridges as long as possible, then dropped into the ravines,
crossed over and rose to the next ridge. Near sunset the trees
momentarily gave way and he faced a creek running quickly over its
stones. Beyond the creek the trees again marched toward the
heights.</p>

<p>He stayed within shelter, long watching the upper and lower,
reaches of the creek and the timber beyond it. When he was
satisfied he rode to water's edge, let the horse have a long drink,
and forded. Twenty yards inside the timber he came to a trail
looping stiffly up the side of the mountain and, since there was no
other way, he took this.</p>

<p>He rose with the short switchback courses, higher and higher
along the edge of the cliff as daylight slowly faded out of the
sky. He arrived at last to a leveling-off place, gave the glen
below him one last look, and moved over an area roughened by some
ancient geological upheaval. He still pointed toward the summits of
the Owlhorns, but within fifteen minutes the trail brought him to a
complete standstill at the edge of a precipice running three
hundred feet or more downward into a canyon whose bottom was now
covered by night shadows.</p>

<p>The land was deceptive. He had marched out of one canyon to
these heights, and now faced another canyon. He had worked himself
to a kind of island of height. Night wind began to flow off the
Owlhorn summits, soft but cold, and as he watched the canyon he saw
the tide of blackness slowly drown out its bottom. A pathway
dropped along the face of the precipice at a breakneck angle,
running lower and lower until he could no longer see its course.
From the look of it, he judged it had not been recently used and
possibly was nothing more than a foothold cut out by deer.</p>

<p>There was undoubtedly a better way of moving off this ridge. One
end of it was probably anchored against the Owlhorns, providing him
with a level route; but it grew darker and he wished a sheltered
spot for his camp. So, not altogether free of doubt, he tipped the
horse over the brink of the precipice into the descending
ledge.</p>

<p>The cliff was rock and earth, with some vegetation clinging to
it; the trail was no more than three or four feet wide, sometimes
tightening against the cliff and causing him to foul his leg
against the outcrop of rock.</p>

<p>The horse was both tired and doubtful and frequently stopped, to
be pressed on by a touch of the spurs. The pathway at places
pitched downward so steeply that the horse's front feet slid along
the loose rubble, and the farther it dropped the blacker it became
until there was no view above Goodnight and no view below.</p>

<p>He had gone a hundred feet when the horse stopped and would no
longer advance. He bent forward in the saddle and fixed his eyes
upon the ground before him until he thought he saw the continuation
of the trail, and he urged the horse again; the horse gathered its
feet close together and began to wind about, gingerly and slowly in
little mincing shifts until it had reversed itself. Then, pointed
downward still, it moved on. Looking directly behind him, Goodnight
vaguely saw the turnaround; the trail made its switchback at this
point.</p>

<p>When he realized his eyes had failed him he felt a twinge of
uncertainty. He was now less than halfway down a cliff whose total
drop was something like three hundred feet. He grew anxious to have
the passage done with but he let the reins remain slack, trusting
the horse; and when the horse again stopped he made no effort to
push it. He bent again in the saddle, again seeing nothing; for he
was now surrounded and pressed upon by the full weight of the inky
canyon shadows. He waited for the horse to move; he waited a full
two minutes and then, knowing that something stood in the way, he
slid carefully to the ground&mdash;crowded between horse and canyon
wall and moved forward. He got down on his hands and knees and used
his hands for exploring; he felt the slide of rock and soil which,
coming from the cliff, blocked the trail entirely. He stood up,
running his arm forward, trying to judge the depth of the barrier.
Some wet spot in the cliff had given way, coming down in a short
slide and landing on this ledge.</p>

<p>It was a new slide, the dirt not yet packed firm. He ran his
hands shovel-like into the dirt and moved it; and he crouched, and
began to throw the debris below him. He heard the rocks strike long
afterwards down on the canyon floor. He was still considerably up
in the air. He thought: "If this thing goes very far I'll be here
all night," and he sat idle a moment and considered backing the
horse to the turn-around and retracing his way to the top of the
ridge. He had a good horse and full confidence in him; yet at this
hour, with the animal jaded from a hard ride and with the going
altogether blind, he discarded the thought, settled on his haunches
and began to shovel the slide away with his fingers.</p>

<p>It took him half an hour to clear the barrier and when he got up
again, his fingers bruised and raw, he estimated he had scooped
aside a pile of dirt five feet long and three feet wide. Catching
up the reins, he led the horse cautiously forward. Fifty feet
brought him to an uncertain spot and he stopped and crawled on his
hands and knees, exploring until he discovered he had reached
another turn-around. He let the horse take its time making the
swing, and again descended.</p>

<p>There was water flowing at the bottom of the canyon; the cold
dampness of it began to rise to him and the sound of it
strengthened. He had been on this descent an hour or there-abouts
and he felt the strain of it, and thought he heard other echoes
above him. He stopped, listening for them through the washing
murmur of the water and received nothing satisfactory; but he was
dissatisfied and stood longer still, reaching for his tobacco and
rolling a cigarette. He had a match in his hand, ready to light,
when he caught himself. He put the match away, nursing the dry
smoke in his mouth, and moved ahead.</p>

<p>There had been, through all this tedious march of the afternoon
and twilight, a memory. It came forward strongly now in this
sightless night&mdash;the recollection of Virginia Overman,
beautifully poised in Sun's ranch house, her eyes upon him, needing
his support against Boston Bill and yet too womanly to permit him
to draw a gun against Bill. She had not understood how bad a
decision she had made in stopping the showdown. At that moment he
had been on equal terms with Bill. Afterwards, with the weight of
Bill's crew against him, he was against odds. Bill would use those
odds against him. She had not understood that, still believing
perhaps that Bill was an honorable man. Yet even with that bad
decision against her, he remembered her fairness and her need of
him&mdash;and the soft side of her nature which would not permit a
killing. It was a thought that buoyed him on this black, downward
grade.</p>

<p>He had been walking with a short forward step, surer of himself
as the bottom of the canyon appeared nearer; he took one more step
and, without warning, found no trail to meet him and lost his
balance and dropped forward into emptiness.</p>

<p>He had been lightly holding the reins. As he lost his balance
his grip tightened upon them and as he swung forward, one foot
still on the trail, the weight of his fall struck hard on reins and
horse; the horse took that pressure with a startled upward fling of
its head, hauling Goodnight upward. He whipped himself around,
grasping the reins with his free hand and, with this double hold,
he swung outward into space and downward. His other foot slid off
the trail and he dropped until his breast scraped the edge of the
rocks; the horse, alarmed, moved backward, this action dragging
Goodnight along the sharp edge of the rocks and sawing at his ribs.
He got one elbow hooked over the rim; he let go the reins
completely and anchored himself now with both elbows. He hung
there, feeling a moment's sharp pain in his chest, his feet digging
against the wall of the canyon and finding poor support. He kicked
at the wall with his toes; he moved them up and down and found
lodgement for one toe. He lifted himself gently, his elbows taking
the strain from the insecure foothold, and he gathered his
strength, made an upward lunge and crawled back to the trail and
rolled and sat upright.</p>

<p>He still had the cigarette in his teeth, the scattered grains of
tobacco half down his throat. He strangled on them and his coughing
reminded him of the beating he had taken in his chest. He got to
his feet. He said: "Coley," calling the horse. He couldn't see the
horse and he took a step onward until he brushed its muzzle. He ran
a hand back along its neck. He said: "All right&mdash;all right.
Stand fast." He drew a deep breath and was relieved.</p>

<p>He walked back to the break in the trail, shuffling his feet
until he reached the edge; he got down on his knees and stretched
his arm outward and touched nothing. He sat back a moment, drawing
a long breath, and then he flattened on his belly and inched
forward until he teetered on the edge of the break like a balanced
board, and reached out again, and again touched nothing. That was a
three-foot stretch; the gap was wider.</p>

<p>He found a couple of small rocks on the trail and threw one of
them a distance which he judged to be slightly more than three
feet; it fell short of its mark, dropping in little bouncing
strikes all the way to the canyon floor. He threw the second rock a
farther distance and heard it land on the trail. That made it
somewhere between five and eight feet.</p>

<p>He sat back, defeated and full of exasperation. He drew in a
huge breath and let it go. He got another handful of small rocks
and dropped them one by one over the edge of the trail, listening
to the strike they made against the canyon bottom. He tried to
visualize the distance but had no great luck. As a final resort he
pulled out a match, struck it and cupped his hands so that the
light would shine upon the break in the trail.</p>

<p>It was better than a ten-foot gap. But he saw something else
which gave him heart: the break had taken away the outer half of
the pathway, leaving an inner shelf of about two feet or so in
width snuggled against the cliff's face. He had walked along the
middle of the trail and had come upon the break; had he been tight
against the cliff face he would have remained upon firm ground.</p>

<p>The light died out, leaving him hopeful in one respect: he
himself could cross over. What troubled him was the situation of
the horse. He doubted if it would stand on this narrow ledge all
during the night without attempting to turn and so come to
disaster. That meant a try at the ledge. He figured the girth of
the horse against the width of the ledge and came to the conclusion
that, with some luck, the passage might be accomplished.</p>

<p>He rose and tackled the ledge, testing it for footing. He walked
back, running his hands along the face. He struck an outstanding
rock and stopped and dug it out and threw it into the pit; he
crawled back to the horse, removed the saddle and carried it over
the break, there dumping it, and came back again to catch up the
reins. He paused a moment, thinking of the depth below. It seemed
to be a full fifty-foot fall. "Well, Coley," he said, "this is the
jack pot." He led the horse forward, holding to the extreme end of
the reins. He got halfway out upon the ledge, and pulled.</p>

<p>Coley was a sure-footed brute, made wary by his experiences. He
came up to the break and stopped there. Goodnight stepped against
Coley's head, using pressure to shift the horse nearer the wall; he
pulled again, moving Coley tentatively on. Coley's foot struck the
edge and slipped and he drew back and emitted a blast of air. He
stood fast. Goodnight came up to him and laid a hand on his neck.
"Coley," he said, "you got to gamble once in a while. Don't be a
damned fool." He backed onto the ledge, hauling suggestively at the
reins. He pulled on them, let the pressure go, and pulled
again.</p>

<p>Coley took another step and hit firm footing and came forward.
Goodnight held the reins tight until he figured Coley's hind feet
had reached the ledge. Then he let them sag so that the horse might
drop its head and see the trail. Coley thrust his muzzle downward,
breathing against the ground. He placed a forefoot ahead like a
weary old man unsure of his bones, and advanced the other front
foot. Goodnight heard Coley's flanks drag along the rock face and
he spoke gently, to check Coley from panic. "You're halfway.
Stretch out your neck and you're across." Suddenly Coley's near
hind foot, too near the edge, slid downward and the horse made a
lunge that carried it all the way across to firm ground. The surge
caught Goodnight off balance. He jumped away, stumbled and fell. He
got up again and went forward. Coley had stopped and was
trembling.</p>

<p>"You think you're the only one?" said Goodnight.</p>

<p>He found the saddle and slapped it on and made a loose tie. Wind
scoured down the canyon, its coldness beginning to reach him. But
his face was sticky and when he took off his hat sweat dropped over
his face and left its salt on his lips. He led the horse downward,
taking his steps with caution. Hunger rolled around his belly,
growling, and he was very tired. Somewhere in the night new sounds
lifted and fell away and lifted again, barely clearing the
increasing rush of the river. He halted, waiting and listening.
Somewhere men were talking and as he swung his head the sound came
clearest from above him. He could see nothing, but the murmur broke
and ran on in idle fragments, and presently died.</p>

<p>He thought: "Echoes from the river," and moved cautiously
downgrade again.</p>

<p>The trail played out through gravel and chunks of rock to the
river's edge. The river's surface had a thin glow. The gravel
churned under his feet and his horse stumbled and stopped, dead-
beat. He pulled it on, coming to better footing. Here he unsaddled
again, put hobbles on the horse and rolled up in the saddle
blanket. He felt a continuing ache in his chest, but he was almost
instantly asleep.</p>

<p><br>
Not more than five minutes after he crossed the small creek in the
earlier afternoon, Jack Babb and Monroe Mullans came up the creek
on a scout, having been sent out by Boston Bill. They cut the fresh
damp tracks of Goodnight's horse on the trail. Babb said: "I'll
wait here. You go back and bring 'em up."</p>

<p>Boston Bill arrived with the main party an hour afterwards and
immediately pushed uptrail, following Goodnight's clear prints.
Darkness caught them on the switchback, whereupon Babb suggested
retreating to better ground for night camp.</p>

<p>"We'll over-ride the place where he turns off and smear up his
tracks with ours."</p>

<p>Boston Bill got down from his horse and led it forward. "He
started up the switchback," he said. "There's no place for him to
turn aside, therefore he followed this trail to the top of the
ridge." He went on. When he reached the summit he stopped to think
it out, Babb again suggesting camp.</p>

<p>"Everybody's tired. So's the horses. No supper and no breakfast
in sight."</p>

<p>Boston Bill got down on the ground and lighted a match. He rose
and walked forward until the match went out, and came back to his
horse. "He's still going straight ahead. He doesn't know the
country and he's pushing for the summit."</p>

<p>"He might break off the trail," said Babb. "Remember, he did it
below at the meadow."</p>

<p>"Break off where?" asked Boston Bill. "You couldn't buck through
this stuff anywhere else. He's in a hurry. He'll take the shortest
way."</p>

<p>He led them forward and at occasional intervals he dismounted
and tried another match; and so came, late at night, to the rim of
the canyon. He lighted a match here and found Goodnight's prints,
and snapped out the match at once. "Down there. Come ahead."</p>

<p>"The hell we do," said Babb. "That's the old Glory Mine's pack
path. They used burros. But it's been ten years ago. You get
halfway down and find a block and how you goin' to get back
up?"</p>

<p>"He went down," said Boston Bill.</p>

<p>"By daylight."</p>

<p>"Couldn't have," said somebody else. "He ain't more than two
hours ahead of us, and it's been dark longer than that. He had to
take it in dark."</p>

<p>"You see?" pointed out Bill. "Come ahead."</p>

<p>"I've seen that thing by daylight," objected Babb. "In fact I
got caught on it last year. There's a break, fifty or sixty feet
from the bottom. It is nothin' to fool with. I'm not tryin'
it."</p>

<p>"He's there," said Boston Bill impatiently.</p>

<p>"Then he'll be there in the mornin'."</p>

<p>"No," contradicted Bill, "he'll get away from us."</p>

<p>"I don't guess you know this part of the country," stated Babb.
"That canyon has got damned steep sides. He can't find a way out by
dark. Except by goin' downgrade with the creek. But that's tough
too. If he's there, which I do doubt, he's sleepin' off a bad day.
We'll catch up with him in the mornin'."</p>

<p>Boston Bill was dissatisfied. "Where else could he be?"</p>

<p>"I think he came here, saw the trouble in front of him, and
backtracked. Maybe on this ridge. There ain't nothin' here except
dog-wallopin' big chunk of up-and-down land, hard to ride in. He
couldn't do much at night with it. He ain't far away. May even be
near enough to hear us. Wait for daylight."</p>

<p>Boston Bill stood silent, unwilling to let go his hopes for a
quick capture. The desire drove him badly and it was with poor
grace that he surrendered. "All right. Camp here. But I want
somebody to go back downgrade and cut over to close the mouth of
the canyon. You do that, Jack. Take Mullans."</p>

<p>"Oh, my Godfrey," said Babb. He wanted to refuse it and would
have refused if Boston Bill had not suddenly cut in with his biting
voice: "I shouldn't think you'd worry about him that much. He's
just one man."</p>

<p>Babb grumbled, "Come on, Monroe," and turned away with Mullans,
over the rough top of the ridge and down the switchback. When they
got to better ground Babb halted. "This is far enough. We can make
the canyon in an hour, soon as it gets light." The pair made cold
camp.</p>

<p>What woke Goodnight around midnight was a stone grinding in his
back. He rolled away from it and slept again, but the memory of it
stayed with him so that he was never quite asleep, and woke again
to find he had other stones beneath him. He rose and carried his
blanket to better ground. Deep in the chilly black he rolled a
cigarette and smoked it through, and tried to rest. Then he got to
thinking of the sound which had been like the sound of voices on
the top of the rim, and so he watchfully awaited the first dismal
streaks of light seeping into the canyon. He sat up, looking for
the horse, and found it strayed upstream in pursuit of grass.
Beyond the horse was a black, loose outline which, as the shadows
began to grow lighter, turned into some kind of building. He rose
and went forward to have a look at it. He passed through a doorway
into a loose board building and he found the remains of bunk frames
around the walls. He thought disgustedly of the poor sleeping he
had had on the gravel, and turned out of the house to bring up his
horse. It was gray dawn then and he heard a clean, distinct shout,
hollowly echoing. Looking upward he discovered a man standing at
the lip of the trail, four hundred feet away. The man brought a
rifle sharply to his shoulder and fired, the bullet striking wide
of Goodnight's position.</p>

<p>The horse was twenty feet from him at the moment, now flinging
up its head at the sound. Goodnight made a run for it, unsnapped
the hobbles and led it back toward the house. A bullet broke ground
ahead of him, and a third one splintered the side of the house wall
as he jumped through the doorway, leading the horse inside. He made
one more run to seize up his saddle and blanket.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE HAUNTS OF LITTLE
MEN</h2>

<p class="first">GOODNIGHT hauled the horse well inside the shack
and swiftly saddled it. The marksman on the rim pumped his shots
methodically down. He laid a pattern around the outside edge of the
door, and then began firing through the roof. Lead came through the
shakes with small, gusty snorts and crashed into the floor close
by. Goodnight backed away, watching the holes spring up in the
floor, marching toward him. He caught the horse and moved through
the shanty; he reached another door at the far end of the place and
stood there, fast-thinking.</p>

<p>The firing ceased for a moment. The marksman would be taking
time out to reload, to improve his position, and meanwhile the day
brightened and the shadows in the canyon grew paler. If he stayed
here a chance shot would sooner or later reach him or cripple the
horse. He noticed, from the pattern of bullet holes on the floor,
that the marksman had set about his job with a design&mdash;to
cover the shanty from one end to the other&mdash;and had gotten
about fifteen feet along the floor. Goodnight caught the horse and
moved it back near the door through which he had entered, making a
guess that the marksman, having covered the area, would spot his
next shots farther on.</p>

<p>He stepped to a side window and tried to catch on upward glance
at the rim, and found his field of vision too limited; he walked to
the door, took off his hat, and pushed his head around the door's
edge. The marksman's gun was at the moment dipping down at him,
ready to try again, and at the same time he saw other men standing
along the rim's edge, poised to fire.</p>

<p>He ducked back and caught up the horse. He pulled it the full
length of the shanty and stood a moment at the door. Boston Bill's
outfit had crossed his trail and now were above him; and presently
this shanty would be riddled like a sieve.</p>

<p>A volley crashed down, cracking through the roof and raising the
floor's long-collected dust. He caught the reins in his left hand,
slapped the horse out through the door and went up into the saddle.
He was twenty feet from the shanty, rushing up a small meadow
beside the river, when the party's firing swung over and began to
reach for him.</p>

<p>The distance was four hundred feet and most of the firing was
from revolvers, which were not meant for long-range work. But there
were some rifles searching him out and coming close upon him. He
veered in until he scraped the edge of the cliff and looked back
and up and saw one man leaning out from the rim, trying to land an
accurate shot; that bullet missed him by three or four yards,
scutting the gravel at the water's edge. He ran along the meadow,
and turned with the cliff's gradual bend, and when he again looked
back he found himself sheltered.</p>

<p>He stopped and studied his situation and looked about him. The
canyon made a long slow turn into darker country. The right-hand
wall remained sheer as far as he could see it; across the river the
rough shoulders of a ridge came down in heavy folds of timber and
rock. It was a rough slope but a passable one, once he crossed the
river.</p>

<p>The river itself, freshly born in these hills, was small and
shallow and fast; he put the horse over the meadow and into the
water, and at once heard the renewal of gunfire. He pointed Coley
upstream for better footing and felt the current break hard against
the animal's legs; at the halfway point the water began to push
against Coley's barrel and chest and a bullet struck the stream
close by with a gurgling echo. Coley struggled with the slippery
rocks, came to a full pause to gain his balance, and moved on
again, working through the shallows to dry land. Across a narrow
beach stood the foot of the ridge, with its timber. Toward it
Goodnight rushed. Gaining the shelter of pines he stopped and swung
about.</p>

<p>Boston Bill's party was against the side of the cliff, coming
single-file and slowly down the reverse pitches of the trail. He
counted eight men, spaced out and moving with caution; and although
it was at a considerable distance, he recognized the high shape of
Bill in the lead. But the firing of the rifle continued, slugging
around the base of the timber behind which Goodnight stood; and
when he lifted his glance he noticed that one man remained on the
rim, guarding the party as it descended.</p>

<p>He pulled his rifle from its boot and crouched down, steadying
the gun beside a pine trunk. He made a guess as to distance and
elevation and drew a thoughtful sight on the marksman. He waited,
and took up the trigger's slack, and waited until he had the
marksman's shoulders in the notch of his sights; and let go. He
missed, but he saw the marksman roll back out of sight.</p>

<p>Boston Bill had turned the second reverse of the trail and had
paused at the break. The rest of the party drifted on until the
horses stood tail and nose, crowded together and some nervous man
in the center of the party began to complain. Goodnight heard the
murmur of it above the rattle of the river, and he knew what fear
the man had begun to feel, trapped on a ledge that permitted no
turning. He lowered his rifle on Boston Bill, having that target
plainly enough in view, and he took up the trigger's slack, and
held it, realizing what his shot would do. At least one of those
horses would lose its head, rear back and try to turn, and go over
the cliff in a fifty-foot fall. Panic would raise hell with the
rest of them.</p>

<p>He took his finger from the trigger and sat in debate with
himself. In another five minutes the outfit would be at the bottom
of the canyon, hard after him; and this was a way of crippling that
pursuit. He knew Boston Bill would remain stubbornly on his trail,
giving him no rest, and he knew also that Bill would show him no
mercy. "My turn now," he said, remembering Niles, and lifted the
rifle again, watching Boston Bill as the latter swung in the
saddle. Bill had reached the gap and was warning the
outfit&mdash;and the man at the tail end suddenly grew afraid and
backed his horse slowly toward the turn- around behind him. Bill
yelled at him and waved an arm, but the man kept retreating. Bill
yelled again, quite loud, and then the rear man's horse lost its
footing and went over the edge of the trail. It fell with its front
legs stiff-legged and its hind legs crooked up, and the man in the
saddle began to tip sidewise, crying full voice. Horse and rider
struck at the same time, and bounced and rolled, and ceased to
move. Goodnight pulled down his rifle and went back to his horse.
He put away the gun and stepped to the saddle, turning to the rough
hill. He found a kind of footing and moved forward until outcrop
stopped him; and found another short passable vista and pushed
forward. In this manner he worked himself two or three hundred feet
up the side of the ridge before stopping. Now looking below him he
caught sight of Boston Bill and the party at the mine house. They
had halted.</p>

<p>He fought his way over some of the roughest footing he had ever
seen. He had to dismount and lead the horse, breaking through vine
undergrowth, circling great masses of fallen rock and soil,
skirting logs lying breast high before him. The horse came
patiently after, now taking a slope with a lunge that pushed
Goodnight out of the way, now balancing himself on a grade so steep
that only Goodnight's added weight on the bridle kept the horse
from sliding downgrade.</p>

<p>This was the way of it for half an hour. Presently some kind of
glen made a wrinkle in the ravine's side, forming a long chute;
Goodnight took to it and made better time, and eventually came upon
an area of bald, worn rock. He passed around chunks of rock two
stories high and discovered a trail winding between worn walls of
like rock. Turning the corner of such a rock he came upon a small
campfire burning.</p>

<p>He stopped at once and looked about him and saw nothing, but he
knew that somewhere around one corner or another of this massive
boulder patch a man stood and held a gun against him. He knew that
because of the frying pan beside the fire and the blackened can
with hot coffee steaming in it. He stood still in front of his
horse, feeling his danger. He said in his easy voice: "All
right."</p>

<p>He heard a scrape behind him, he heard boots slide forward over
the solid-rock floor. A man went by him, slowly swinging&mdash;a
young man with a sharp, pointed face pinched sharp with the shadow
of hunting and being hunted. He had a gun in his arm but a moment
later, considering Goodnight closely, he put the gun back in his
holster. He pointed at the fire. "Those fish are ready to eat. Go
ahead and eat 'em."</p>

<p>"A drink of coffee is all I've got time for," said
Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell," said the young man, "that outfit won't ever get up
this way. If they try it, you'll hear 'em a long time before they
arrive."</p>

<p>"You heard them?"</p>

<p>The young man pointed above him. "From the top of that rock I
can catch the canyon a mile either direction. So I heard the racket
and went up for a look. What kept you from shootin' at the lads
when they came down the trail? It would of been like knockin' duck
off a wire."</p>

<p>"That's right&mdash;it would have been," agreed Goodnight.</p>

<p>The young man served him with a keen survey. "Well, hell," he
said, "they'll do you in if they find you, won't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you were a big fool. Go ahead and eat my breakfast. I been
livin' easy for the last month. I ain't hungry."</p>

<p>Goodnight walked to the fire and squatted before it. He dragged
the coffee can aside, saw another can near by, and poured himself a
drink. He took it down in noisy swallows, hot as it was. He looked
at the fish and bacon lying crisp in the pan and he pulled out his
pocket knife and went to work. The young man crouched across the
fire from him, watching with amusement. "I remember when I was that
hungry. But I found this spot and I been livin' fine ever since.
Fish in the river, venison for the lookin'. Rabbit any old time. I
never lived so well in my life. That fish taste all right?"</p>

<p>"Fine," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Yeah," said the young man. "You can't beat this place. It is a
funny thing. A man gets in trouble. All wound around with grief and
disaster. Hunted like a dog. Can't ride without watchin', can't
sleep without one eye open. Can't walk down a street. So he says if
he ever gets to a place where he can just relax and never worry,
then he'll be happy and never move again. Yeah. This is the place.
I can hear anything come, half a mile away. Don't suppose more than
four men have ever found this spot in couple hundred years. Why,
it's perfect."</p>

<p>"Should be wonderful," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Wonderful," said the young man absent-mindedly. He bent forward
and poured more coffee into Goodnight's drinking can. "Want me to
fry up more bacon?"</p>

<p>"Had enough," said Goodnight. He sat back to roll a cigarette;
he relished the smoke and the food sent its warmth and its energy
through him. Sunlight moved overhead. Presently heat would pour
full down into this rocky cup. "The place gets hot, doesn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Around ten o'clock," said the young man, "I move up to my
parlor in the trees. Cool there. I sleep here, at night. Sleep
there durin' the day. Never found anything like it. Man could live
to be a hundred and ten right here. Sure is wonderful."</p>

<p>He rose and vanished around the corner of a rock. Goodnight,
lying back relaxed, heard him scuffle around the top of the rock,
thirty feet above; and heard his voice. "They on your trail
serious?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"They ain't in much of a hurry," said the young man. "Well, here
comes a couple more men from the lower end of the canyon. They're
talking. You know, this is a wonderful spot. I can see
everything&mdash;hear everything. I'll just watch those fellows a
while."</p>

<p>Goodnight threw the rest of the coffee on the fire, killing the
flame. He dropped on his shoulders and drew a hat over his face,
grateful for the rest and for the chance to do a little thinking.
So far he had been on the run to clear himself of the weight Boston
Bill could bring against him, well knowing he could not buck the
man's whole outfit. All he wished was a straight chance at Bill, an
even encounter. He wanted nothing more, and would have nothing
less. It was another obligation in his life, like the obligation to
satisfy his sister's memory.</p>

<p>He turned slightly on the ground, that memory bringing its ache
again and he thought to himself: When will it grow softer, when can
I think of her without that feeling? And bitterness came up and the
old hatred of the world and its insolence, the old distrust, the
old savage desire to set himself against men, without mercy or
tolerance; to lay his hand against cruelty, to make them cry, to
grind into their brutal souls the knowledge of fear and misery, to
pay back in kind every bitter thing they had done to him and to
those he loved. If the world was cruel, then he would abide those
rules and make the cruel suffer with their own kinds of torture
until pride and manhood was bled out of them and until they cried
for a mercy they had never given.</p>

<p>He sat up, bringing his big fists together slowly, ridden by his
feeling, and he remembered that he had had his chance only a half
hour before; he could have shot Bill's party off the cliff. He
could have stampeded those men. "Why didn't I do that?" he asked
himself, and was puzzled.</p>

<p>He brought his mind back to Bill. He thought: "I've got to get
at him. I have run far enough." He drew idle patterns along the
dusty rock with his forefinger. He was clear of Bill now, on even
terms with the man in this tangle of country. As he was hunted, so
he could hunt. It was fifty-fifty. Maybe Bill didn't know that
yet.</p>

<p>The young man came off the rock, into sight. He squatted on his
heels, made cheerful by this break in a long day. "They've started
up the canyon. It'll be two-three hours before they get out of it.
Ain't a decent trail short of five miles from here."</p>

<p>"Where will the trail lead them?"</p>

<p>The young man swung his arm to the east. "Up there is an old
Indian trail over the summit. They'll come up the canyon and strike
it. Then they can either go over the mountains, or turn and follow
the trail back to the main road, ten miles off. That's another way
of going over the mountains. Or of going back to Roselle and
Sherman City." He dropped on an elbow, content with the day. "But
they won't ever find a way of gettin' here. There ain't any way."
He gave Goodnight a hopeful look. "How'd you like beans and
biscuits for supper&mdash;with a side dish of fried rabbit?"</p>

<p>Goodnight rose. He walked to his horse and tried the cinch, and
tightened it. "I am obliged," he said. "And I wish you luck."</p>

<p>The young man's face dropped. He got to his feet. He said:
"Anything excitin'? Maybe I can get in on this."</p>

<p>"Thought this place pleased you," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>The young man drew a heavy breath. He lost his cheerfulness.
"It's a wonderful place. But I'm sick of it. If I got to stay here
and talk to myself any longer I'll go crazy."</p>

<p>"Safe here," Goodnight reminded him. "No worries."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know," grumbled the young man. "But I guess I'd
rather die by a bullet. This is what I sure prayed for, couple
months ago, when I was one jump ahead of hell. Well I got my prayer
and it was all right for a while. But it ain't now."</p>

<p>Goodnight laid his hands over the saddle; he looked across the
saddle at the young man, judging him to be neither better nor worse
than the average. A break one way had made him do a foolish thing;
another break in the same direction would send him to the wild
bunch for the rest of his life. But a break toward the right would
nake a respectable citizen out of him. The lad was young; that was
the only thing wrong with him. Young and swayed too easily. He
thought about it and was troubled; the young man's future, at this
moment, lay in his hands and the burden oppressed him.</p>

<p>"You did something wrong," he reflected in a quiet, soft way.
"Then you got chased out. You couldn't ride like other men. You
took side trails and you ate small and slept cold, always lookin'
over your shoulder. Then you found this spot and it was a safe
spot. You quit lookin' over your shoulder. But you still can't do
what other men can do. You can't ride by daylight down the middle
of any road that pleases you."</p>

<p>"I'll take care of myself," said the young man.</p>

<p>"A man," said Goodnight, "was meant to be free. If he isn't free
he isn't anything. You have taken away your own freedom. You have
put yourself in your own jail and the sentence is entirely up to
you."</p>

<p>"You're in trouble, ain't you?" said the young man. "You could
use help, it looks like. Take me along."</p>

<p>"I could use help," agreed Goodnight. "But I won't take you. If
you came with me you'd be slammin' the door on your cell for good.
You want a life of this business? You think it's fun?"</p>

<p>"I'll do all right," said the young man.</p>

<p>"Like now?" said Goodnight, and watched the young man's eyes
show uncertainty. He stepped into the saddle, looking down. "The
finest thing I know of," he said, pressing home his point, "is for
a man to be able to ride into a strange town, go inside a
restaurant and sit down with his back to the door, drinking his
coffee without worrying what's behind him. How long you been in
this hole?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-four days, at seven o'clock tonight."</p>

<p>"Twenty-four days of misery. If you're smart you'll ride over
the hill and a long way from here. You'll find an outfit and you'll
stick there until the smell of smoke wears off. Then you'll be out
of prison for good."</p>

<p>He rode over the rock floor of the bowl, turned a corner and put
the young man behind him. Once in some past age there had been a
river flowing here, washing its way down to solid rock; through
this old bed he traveled, the rock walls to either side and little
islands of rock before him. At the first convenient spot he left
the depression, made a way through the trees and came eventually to
a point from which he viewed the canyon. Far upgrade in the canyon,
even then passing around a bend, moved Boston Bill's party.</p>

<p>He backtracked and began anew the labor of finding a route
through the timber and broken land. He wished to keep close to the
rim so that he might watch Bill's party, and therefore he made
frequent wide detours where the rim broke away. Near midmorning he
made another survey of the canyon and discovered Bill's party
turning up the side of the ridge; he stood by, watching the party
go out of sight in the dmber, reappear at a higher elevation, and
go out of sight again. When he was certain of Bill's direction, he
moved ahead until he reached a point near which he believed the
outfit would come; and dismounted to wait. In his own mind there
was but one thing now to do&mdash;keep within reaching distance of
Bill's group, to follow and to wait until he had an even break with
the man. Sooner or later the group would split into smaller
bunches.</p>

<p>He thought of his talk with the young man, and suddenly worry
came strongly back to him. The kid was teetering and maybe one more
word, one more picture would have turned the trick. He reviewed
what he had said, figuring how he might have made it stronger, or
better. He had wanted to say: "An outlaw is a man alone&mdash;and
no man alone is free." But you couldn't say a thing like that; it
was something you had to learn. It had to be ground into you. By
sitting alone at a campfire night upon night and watching the stars
and seeing beauty there, and feeling wonders in the wind, and
tasting the greatness of the earth&mdash;and having no living soul
to share these discoveries with.</p>

<p>He had been slouched back against a tree. He straightened,
astonished with these things marching so clear, so logical through
his head. He said, aloud, "What the hell am I thinking about? Where
did I get those notions?"</p>

<p>The sound of a voice came out of the timber, thinned and short,
and afterwards he heard the rattling of brush. All this was ahead
of him somewhere, beyond sight; but he got into his saddle and
waited, not sure how near the outfit would come. The noise of brush
ceased for a while, the voices continuing&mdash;so that he guessed
the party had stopped for a breathing spell. The sun stood straight
overhead, heat beginning to pile up on the earth.</p>

<p>Later both voices and sound of travel came to him, fading
somewhat; whereby he knew the outfit had swung away front him. He
moved on and presently reached the trail Bill's men left behind
them. Then he dropped back until he caught only an occasional echo,
and patiently followed.</p>

<p>Their way was upgrade for a mile or more, with the land
gradually growing less rough; afterwards the trail made a sharp
turn to the left and paralleled the higher summit points of the
Owlhorns. Two hours of this kind of pursuit brought Goodnight to a
trail&mdash;the old Indian trail mentioned by the young
man&mdash;and this trail Bill's party had taken. Something had
hurried Bill at this point, the hoof prints showing a deeper bite
in the earth.</p>

<p>Goodnight paused a moment to debate the proposition. If he
delayed he lost them. If he took to the trail he ran the risk of
being ambushed. It was one of those quick decisions, ended
immediately. He turned into the trail and set his horse to a canter
along a series of little curves and up-and-down pitches.</p>

<p>He had his mind entirely on this business and still, from time
to time, the thought of the young man came back to him, to worry
him; and then other thoughts moved through his head in rapid
succession, of Niles, of McSween, of his sister, of older days that
had been pleasant. Of Virginia Overman. That thought with its
recollection of her face and her voice and her quiet smile stayed
longest. It was still with him when, rounding a bend, he came upon
a horse and a man dismounted and sitting with his back to a
tree.</p>

<p>He pulled up to avoid a collision with the horse, and as he
pulled up he saw the seated man make a halfhearted effort toward
his gun, touch the butt and then drop his hand away. Goodnight
waited, not bothering to draw; for he noticed the sick set of the
man's face and the purple coloring of his lips. This, he
remembered, was one of Bill's men. He recognized the face.</p>

<p>"What's up?"</p>

<p>The man shook his head. He pressed a hand against his heart and
a distinct fear came to his eyes. "Too much for me. Too much
climbin'. Never happened before."</p>

<p>"They left you here?"</p>

<p>"I guess," said the man, "they're in a hurry."</p>

<p>"A hurry for what?"</p>

<p>The man looked up at him, once his enemy, once pressing him for
the kill. This man looked up at him, wiped clean of the desire by
the slow ticking of his heart, too sick to feel hatred. He had
reached for his gun and then, as a gesture of something no longer
important, he had dropped his arm. It was a strange thing, this
change, this helplessness, this lack of interest. It was as though
the man had been jerked by strings, his actions not of his own
will; and then the strings broke and he had collapsed and was
nothing.</p>

<p>"To swing around and box you in," said the man.</p>

<p>Goodnight said: "Where's a good way to Roselle?"</p>

<p>The man motioned along the trail. "It comes into the Roselle
road." He stopped speaking and again put a hand over his heart, and
fright showed on him clearly. He struggled through it and murmured,
"Whut you think I can do for this?"</p>

<p>"Fall back and rest&mdash;and sleep," said Goodnight. "And hope
you wake." He crowded by the man's horse, intending to go on. But
he stopped and got down and unsaddled the other horse and took off
the blanket. He laid out the blanket on the ground; he took the man
by the armpits and shifted him to the blanket. "Lie back," he said,
and hauled off the man's boots. "If I had some water I'd leave it.
Good luck."</p>

<p>"Don't go," said the man, fear full in his voice. "Don't go."
Then he shook his head and said dully, "Never mind."</p>

<p>Goodnight returned to his horse. From the saddle he looked back.
The man's eyes were on him; the man held them open, as though
afraid that if he closed them he would die. The man held on,
bitterly afraid. He shook his head. "Funny thing. You're the same
as any other man. Why was I in the pack that chased you?"</p>

<p>"I'll send somebody back, when I reach a ranch."</p>

<p>The man gave Goodnight a bleak look. "Who'd come?" he asked.
"Who'd give a damn?" He turned his head away and his voice echoed
the futile feeling, the faith that was gone, the wreckage that
could never be repaired. "You're the first man to give me a hand in
many years. I'm older than you, ain't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This is no good," said the man. "This business you and me are
in. Look at me and see what it comes to. We're livin' like dogs and
this is a dog's end. Take a look at me. It'll happen to you. Better
get out."</p>

<p>"So-long," said Goodnight, and rode on.</p>

<p>For this little while he had forgotten Boston Bill and he had
forgotten his own situation. The nearness of one man in trouble had
taken it out of his mind; now it returned, to remind him that
Boston Bill was somewhere ahead.</p>

<p>He had lost time and now went along the trail with less caution.
Occasionally, the trail's turnings took him near the edge of
timber, through which he saw one or another of the upper mountain
meadows and, beyond them, the rocky summit reefs lying black in the
afternoon sun. The trail grew broader and better; and presently
fell into a road which came upgrade and passed before him on its
way over the Owlhorns. It was, he believed, the same road which
touched Roselle and Sun Ranch on its way down to Sherman City.
Boston Bill's party had swung into it, going downgrade.</p>

<p>That outfit was by now a quarter hour ahead of him and
presumably still in motion; and since he had no other plan than to
keep within sound or sight of Bill, he set out upon the road,
following Bill's tracks. The sun had swung low and the timber was
taking on its early shadows, its first night stillness. The air
coming from the summit began to cut the forest heat. He meanwhile
noted that the dust lying disturbed along the ground&mdash;made by
the passage of Boston Bill's outfit&mdash;had largely disappeared,
so that he had only the smell of the last particles still hanging
unseen in the air. Bill had pulled away.</p>

<p>He had watched the margins of the timber, never trusting this
nearness of shelter, he had looked on through the loose screen of
pines into the deeper mass of forest, he had searched the presented
vistas. He had seen nothing. Yet quite suddenly out of the timber,
hard by him, he heard a voice&mdash;a woman's voice&mdash;speak to
him in soft urgence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Frank. Turn and come here. Hurry."</p>

<p>He looked directly to his left, from which direction the vqice
had come, and saw nothing. He wheeled and ran in, swinging right
and left around the pines. The root system of a capsized pine made
a bulwark before him, and when he turned it he discovered Virginia
Overman waiting there on her horse.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; THE TASTE OF A
WOMAN'S LIPS</h2>

<p class="first">"BILL'S just ahead of you," she said.</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a swift, sharpened interest. She turned
her head. She called: "Ned," and waited. Goodnight heard an echo
break behind him, and swung about to see the long, black- whiskered
Ned Tower move into sight, walking. Tower gave him a short-sizing
up, not speaking. The girl said, to Goodnight: "Did you see his
outfit?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How many did he have with him?"</p>

<p>"Ten or so."</p>

<p>"He passed here with nine," she said.</p>

<p>"He's got more men than that scattered around," said Tower. He
paused, and placed his suspecting glance back on Goodnight. "If he
was chasin' you," commented Tower, "how you come to be chasin' him
now?"</p>

<p>Goodnight gave the man a stiff glance; the preceding twenty-
four hours had wearied him and he was hungry and in no tractable
frame of mind. He rolled himself a smoke, making no answer. The
girl, meanwhile, had been debating something in her own mind, and
now said to Tower: "Better drift down towards Roselle. I think
he'll stop there to eat." She started to say something else,
checked it, and later added: "Keep an eye on them, Ned."</p>

<p>He nodded and moved away. Before disappearing, he swung,
speaking again to Goodnight. "You comin' along?"</p>

<p>The girl quickly spoke for Goodnight. "We'll follow later." She
watched Tower go; she turned and looked at Goodnight with a full,
light expression. She smiled and the smile went warm into him. She
kept her eyes on him, open and silently promising. She was
beautiful to him, a poised and deep woman slow to awake and slow to
give; but once awake and once willing to give, she glowed and was
beautiful.</p>

<p>"I have not slept at all, thinking of you. I have been through
the hills, setting a dozen men on your trail. Then we came back
here, hoping. I guess we felt the same thing Bill did&mdash;that
you'd come here to eat."</p>

<p>There was movement around him, in the farther reaches of the
forest. He heard horses traveling. "Who's here?"</p>

<p>"Ned's got a few men with him. We'll go toward Roselle later.
You come with me."</p>

<p>She swung away, heading into the forest with confidence. At a
short distance she picked up a trail and went with it, downgrade
across a creek and upgrade over a small ridge. The sun had dropped
and the shadows turned steadily blacker and the visibility lessened
until he saw only the shape of the girl and her horse before him.
In a general way it seemed to him they were dropping from the high
point of the hills; and presently they reached a meadow and crossed
it and came upon a cabin. She said: "One of Sun's line cabins," and
got down and went inside.</p>

<p>He remained in the saddle, looking back at the meadow's edges.
She had lighted a lantern and he heard her rattle the lid of the
cabin's stove. The lantern's light came through the doorway,
touching him; he pulled aside, so long on the alert that he was
dissatisfied now. Smoke lifted from the chimney, its smell curling
through the night. She came out, curious at his delay.</p>

<p>"Nobody will come this way," she said. Her voice had a ring to
it. He listened to its sureness, its confidence. He thought: She is
used to authority, she is used to being obeyed. But he was suddenly
tired into his bones and he dropped from the saddle and moved
inside the house. The fire had caught hold and added heat to the
small room. There was a dirt floor and a doubledecked bunk against
one side of the cabin; there was a soapbox on the wall and some
supplies in it. This line cabin, he judged, was in use through the
season. He saw an empty bucket and he said: "Where's the
water?"</p>

<p>"Lie down and sleep until I call you."</p>

<p>He obeyed her. The night and the day had caught up with him and
when he lay back on the bunk&mdash;on its lumpy, straw-filled
tick&mdash;he shut his eyes and thought of the man up on the trail,
dying or now dead. The memory troubled him and he thought: "I've
got to tell somebody about that." He heard the girl lift the bucket
and he heard her leave the cabin. He meant to rise and do that
chore for her but he thought, I'll do it in a minute.</p>

<p>He heard his name called and called again. He felt a hand flat
on his chest and he opened his eyes and found her standing above
him, bent over, her eyes and her mouth close to him. "Supper's
ready."</p>

<p>He said, "Fell asleep," and rose and was ashamed. She had walked
somewhere for the water. She had cooked a meal. He sat down at the
table before biscuits and fried potatoes and bacon back and coffee.
He drank the coffee first, badly in need of it. She refilled his
cup and then sat opposite him, her chin cupped in her hands, her
elbows propped on the table, her smile steady on him and her glance
sharp in its survey.</p>

<p>"You slept hard. The print of the straw is on your face. I
should have let you sleep longer. Didn't you get any rest last
night?"</p>

<p>"Not much."</p>

<p>"Where were you?"</p>

<p>"Bottom of a canyon. By a little river. By the bunkhouse of an
old mine."</p>

<p>"The Glory Mine," she said. "Was Bill following?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "He followed."</p>

<p>"Were you shot at?"</p>

<p>"They were poor shots," he said.</p>

<p>Her eyes hardened. "I made a mistake, Frank. I should have let
you alone when you had your chance with him on Sun. I should not
have interfered. When he started after you with his outfit I knew
what I had done. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"The time will come again," he said.</p>

<p>She had a strong jaw for a woman. He saw it set, and wondered
about that. But presently her face softened. She dropped her eyes,
gravely speaking. "The last hours have been the worst in my life. I
never ceased to think about you. I have missed you."</p>

<p>He looked at her, surprised at the change. He said: "I'm the
same man you said was just another candidate for the wild
bunch."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I know I said it. And I felt it. I do not
feel it now. How can I tell you when the change happened? I do not
know."</p>

<p>He said, "What have you got started now? What's this Ned Tower
doing?"</p>

<p>"By now he's waiting outside Roselle, keeping watch."</p>

<p>He said: "I thought Bill was the man you needed to help you
against Harry Ide."</p>

<p>"I once thought that, too."</p>

<p>"How many men with Tower?"</p>

<p>She paused on the edge of her answer. She watched him closely
for a moment, then turned back to the stove to catch the coffee
pot. She filled his tin cup. "I don't know how many he got
together."</p>

<p>He said: "I'll drift down there and lend a hand."</p>

<p>"Ned will have enough," she said evenly.</p>

<p>He listened to the answer and found it strange. "I don't make
this out. What does Tower figure to do?"</p>

<p>"Break up Bill's bunch. Once and for all, and forever."</p>

<p>"My understanding was," he said, "that these hill ranchers got
along well enough with Bill. What's made them turn righteous, after
he's supplied them with prairie cattle for a year or two?"</p>

<p>She said: "They were his friends as long as he knew where to
stay. When he forgot that, they turned against him."</p>

<p>She was offering him nothing. She answered his questions in her
even, short manner, explaining nothing extra. He sat before her,
watching the strength of her face, its resolution and its will. It
seemed to him that she gave him what he wanted to know only as a
favor and not as a right; that even then she questioned his right
to ask. But her small smile remained.</p>

<p>"Who got them started against him?"</p>

<p>"I did," she said. "As soon as he left Sun, following you." She
added, very softly: "I changed my mind about him, Frank, because of
you."</p>

<p>"This was the man," he said, "you depended on to keep Harry Ide
away."</p>

<p>She drew a breath, a deep breath, and let it fall. Her smile
pinched out and he realized she was impatient with him. "Listen to
me," she said. "He has his ambitions. If he helped me against Harry
Ide, he wished payment. There's only one way of paying him&mdash;to
marry him and give him Sun. He would take nothing less; and he
would at least take Sun if I refused to marry him." She paused,
showing her small irritation at the need of this explanation. But
she went on. "To be honest with you, I once thought of marrying
him. I once saw admirable things in him. You changed that. When you
faced him, he broke before my eyes. In that room. When you offered
to fight. I stepped between you two to stop a killing not for any
love. He had changed to a poorer man, with less in him, in that
moment."</p>

<p>"You're takin' a chance of a killing now," he pointed out. "How
do you think it will go at Roselle when they begin to shoot?"</p>

<p>She looked at him with her resolution showing around her mouth.
"He went after you and meant to kill you. I would no longer try to
save him. He must be driven out. Otherwise he'll stay by and hunt
you again."</p>

<p>He had his own irritation, and rose. "I'll take care of my
personal quarrels," he said.</p>

<p>She stood up with him, closely watching as he moved over the
room; she was inwardly angry with him, and not all her carefulness
held it entirely away. "You are rather proud," she observed. "I
apologized for interfering the other day. Do I have to apologize
again?"</p>

<p>"You like to run your own affairs," he said. "So do I."</p>

<p>Her mouth came tight. Her cheeks reddened and she lowered her
head, looking down at the floor with a small-lipped repression. Her
hands came together, palm tightly pressing palm. She struggled with
herself, she argued with her pride and her will, and at last she
lifted her head and drew her shoulders straight. "I'm sorry,
Frank," and held out a hand to him.</p>

<p>They had come close to quarreling and for a little while she had
hated the crossing of his will against her own: but she had stepped
aside with a woman's gracious gesture, and the gesture made her
lovely before his eyes. He moved to her, he took her arm and held
it a moment. Her eyes widened on him; they held him. She wasn't
smiling but her lips were drawn apart in a voiceless expression and
when she tipped her head he saw the light shining on her throat,
and all this broke something in him which long needed the breaking
and he brought her forward and kissed her. He felt her lips meet
him, willing and readily answering. He felt her body sway and go
soft.</p>

<p>And then she was still and the receptiveness went out of her;
she had ceased to answer him and he drew back his head and saw that
she had opened her eyes and was watching him, all cool and quiet.
He felt embarrassed and stepped away.</p>

<p>"Sorry," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>He didn't know why. But he was still embarrassed and reached for
his tobacco as a gesture. For a little while it had been as he had
hoped, a giving and a receiving, warmth for warmth and a hard long
call from one heart to another. This was a thing for which no word
existed. It lived in a man and in a woman, compelling but silent,
until that man and woman met. The answer came then, still wordless,
and there was never any need of words. It had been this way between
them when he first touched her; she had given. Then she had
withdrawn and had left him alone with his kiss, permitting his
touch but not answering&mdash;and she had afterwards watched him
with her speculative glance. He grew red and awkwardness came to
his fingers.</p>

<p>"Why?" she repeated in her quiet, curious voice.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me something I don't know," he said.</p>

<p>She made a gesture with her hands, with her shoulders. "I
thought I knew the ways of most men, but you are strange. I never
know you. What is it you want?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No use talking about it."</p>

<p>It turned her dark and disappointed, and in turn made her
awkward. "What did I do wrong? Shouldn't I have let you kiss
me?"</p>

<p>"Time to ride on," he said. "How will you get back to Sun?"</p>

<p>"You'll take me," she said.</p>

<p>"I'm going to Roselle."</p>

<p>"Nothing will happen until you get back there," she said. But
she had never ceased to watch him with her strained expression. She
had failed, she had touched him only for a moment; and when he
lighted his cigarette and looked at her he discovered she seemed
ready to cry. The expression was on her, and that expression
softened and made her beautiful again, so that everything he
thought about her returned in full flood, and he desired her as he
had before. He told himself: "I'm the biggest fool alive. I want
her." But he said aloud: "Let's get started."</p>

<p>When they left the cabin she turned to the left, which seemed
wrong to him. He said: "Better take the Roselle road until we reach
town, then circle it. But keep on the road."</p>

<p>"I know a shorter trail," she told him, and led away.</p>

<p>Boston Bill and his seven men rode into Roselle at sunset and
put up before the saloon. Bill said: "He left Sun without any
supplies. A night and a day will starve him out. He won't go back
to Sun because he'll be afraid of running into us. Sherman City is
too long a haul for a hungry man, and he'll be too suspicious of
the hill ranches to drop in at one of them. He'll come here." He
started to leave the saddle, and then changed his mind. "If we
leave the horses here he'll spot 'em and know we're waiting for
him."</p>

<p>He led the group around to the back side of the empty
building&mdash;that same building in which Goodnight and McSween
had had their fight. He rode into the building with his outfit.
"Good place," he said and left his horse and walked to the
saloon.</p>

<p>The bunch stood around the saloon, drinking up a sharp thirst,
and later crowded into the back room for supper. It was dark then
and Boston Bill thought about setting out a guard. "He'll scout the
town very carefully before he comes in. We'll have to lay low. Rex,
you go out and keep an eye peeled."</p>

<p>Afterwards the rest of the bunch returned to the front part of
the saloon. Boston Bill's attention was caught by the side window
which had no curtain. He said to the barkeep: "Cover that with
something."</p>

<p>Some of the group started a poker game while the others sat idly
by. Jem Soders laid himself out on the floor and fell immediately
asleep. The barkeep came back with a blanket and nailed it across
the window. He stood by the poker game, looking on. He said, idly
and to nobody in particular, "Who's payin' for the meals?"</p>

<p>One of the poker players looked up at him. "What meals?"</p>

<p>The barkeep moved back to the bar. He stood behind it, without
expression. He looked at Boston Bill who supported himself at the
end of the bar. "You payin' for the meals?"</p>

<p>"You can stand a night's charity," said Boston Bill. "You have
been sticking us for years. Lay up a couple bottles on the bar. The
treat's on you."</p>

<p>The barkeep had a round and soft face in which no great amount
of character resided, and eyes of some kind of blue. He dropped his
glance from Boston Bill. He backed away from the bar, but kept his
hands on it. He cleared his throat and was morosely idle for a
moment. Pretty soon he reached around for the whisky bottles,
placed them before Bill and walked into the back room.</p>

<p>The echo of other riders came on in dull rhythm and presently
four new men of Bill's outfit arrived. He said: "Put your horses
across the street in that empty building," and watched them go out.
He rested the small of his back against the corner of the bar,
looking at the card game. One of the men began to sing to himself,
making an odd noise. Bill said sharply: "Cut it out. You can be
heard outside." He turned and placed his elbows on the bar and
supported his chin in his hands. He watched the light shining on
the dark top of the bar, his face pulled together unreadably. He
dropped one hand on the bar and began to drum with his fingers.</p>

<p>All this bored him and in a little while he walked into the back
room, and on through it to the kitchen. The barkeep was at the
moment saying something to his wife, a heavy woman now standing
over the stove, her face red and rough. He cut off his talk a
moment, and went on by saying, "Couple more steaks, I guess," and
looked at Bill.</p>

<p>Bill grinned ironically. "You weren't talking about steaks." He
got a cup off the kitchen table and poured himself coffee out of
the big pot on the stove. The redfaced woman kept her eyes on the
stove, her mouth hard-closed. Bill wandered around the kitchen with
his coffee, still grinning; he stopped in front of a lithograph
hung to the wall by a single nail. It was a winter scene with two
horses drawing a sleigh across the snow toward a farmhouse. The
horses were stepping high and a woman on the porch had her hand
lifted in welcome. A big red barn, with its silo, stood back of the
house.</p>

<p>"New York State," murmured Boston Bill to himself. He stared at
it a long while, the smile dying. He said: "Where'd you get
this?"</p>

<p>The barkeep had gone back to the front room. It was his wife who
spoke over her shoulder, grudging the talk. "Somebody left it
here."</p>

<p>"Somebody who came from there, I suppose," said Boston Bill,
again talking to himself. "Another traveler far from home. Damned
odd how it sticks to you." He walked into the small dining room,
listening to the growing racket in the front; he sat down at the
table and lounged back in the chair sipping at his cup of coffee.
The air in New York State in winter was clear and cold and the
apples in the storehouse had the sharpest possible flavor. He
remembered them and he remembered the smell of the storehouse. As a
boy he had been afraid to go into the place because of its
darkness, because of the fear of snakes; once his father had found
a copperhead there, had plunged his hands into a bin of potatoes,
touching the copperhead. But he remembered the smell of the
storehouse, and the smell took him back and a thousand other
memories came hard and sudden before him; and then, as always
happened when these memories arrived, he had a longing to be what
he once had been, and his mistakes gave him cruel pain, and he
hated himself for what he was.</p>

<p>He hated not only himself, but the men around him, despising
their ignorance and their vulgarity, and sometimes he was
inexpressibly lonely&mdash;and that loneliness always revived his
memory of better days. One by one he knew the precise moments when
he had made his mistakes, when he had turned the wrong way; they
stood before him with terrible clarity, and somewhere out of that
past a voice seemed to say: "You might have been&mdash;you might
have been."</p>

<p>He had come West to escape all that, to start anew, and for a
while his hope had been great. But once more the turns had been the
wrong turns until he knew at last that the fault was in himself; he
would always turn wrong because there was something in him which
would never let him be wholly right. He finished his coffee and put
down the cup and rose from the chair. He faced the empty wall and
he looked at it and through it, seeing many things, seeing nothing;
he turned back into the kitchen and went to the lithograph and
pulled it from the wall. He rolled it up, feeling the eyes of the
barkeep's wife on him.</p>

<p>"They sold these for fifty cents apiece," he told her. "Back
East. I'll give your husband a dollar. I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sound of voices in the saloon quarters dropped away, warning
him. He heard a man walk over the floor and speak. "Which way this
road go?"</p>

<p>He had rolled the lithograph; he carried it into the little
dining room and opened it again, looking at it; he laid it on the
table and folded it until it was small enough for a pocket, and put
it into his pocket, and walked into the saloon room. The newcomer
stood at the bar, drinking; a small man with a dry face and a pair
of badly sprung legs. He laid down the glass and he paid for his
drink. He felt the silence around him, and he looked around him
with a kind of casual interest and turned back to the barkeep, who
stood heavy and still.</p>

<p>"Which way this road go?"</p>

<p>"Which way you travelin'?"</p>

<p>"That way," said the man and pointed upward to the Owlhorn
summits.</p>

<p>"It just keeps going," said the bartender, "over the
mountain."</p>

<p>"What's over the mountain?"</p>

<p>"Same kind of country you came out of."</p>

<p>"How do you know what I came out of?" said the newcomer.</p>

<p>The barkeep shrugged his shoulders. "Looks like you been
drinkin' desert water."</p>

<p>"You got rooms here?"</p>

<p>The barkeep punched a thumb upward. "Take the outside stairway
and pick a bunk. Four-bits now."</p>

<p>The newcomer tried a second drink and bowed his head, thinking.
He stirred a little and paid for the whisky; he said, "You got a
pound of bacon to sell and some bakin' powder?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The little man shrugged his shoulders. Boston Bill looked down
on him with a kind of unsympathetic amusement. "You're in safe
company, brother."</p>

<p>"Am I?" said the newcomer and thought about that. He took off
his hat and scratched his head; he shook his head. "That would be
somethin' new," he murmured and turned, walking out of the
saloon.</p>

<p>The barkeep picked up bottle and glass and set them away; he ran
a rag indifferently over the bar top and took a patient, dismal
stand, looking at the men in the room wearily. Boston Bill poured
himself a drink and held the glass between his hands. He was
thinking then of Rosalia, growing warm from the thought of her. He
drank the whisky at one swallow. He said irritably to the barkeep:
"Nothing as rotten as this." More of his crowd had drifted in
during the last fifteen minutes, so that the room was comfortably
full. Some of the late-comers went by him, into the little dining
room. Jem Soders was sound asleep and snoring. Lane Brazee, who was
the most alert of this outfit, looked up from the poker game.</p>

<p>"No use all of us waitin'. I'm goin' to turn in. We stay
here?"</p>

<p>"We stay until he comes."</p>

<p>"Ed ought to be limpin' in pretty soon."</p>

<p>Ed was the one fallen back on the trail with the bad heart.
Boston Bill shook his head. "That lad's dead by now. I've seen that
happen before. His mouth looked funny."</p>

<p>"Maybe somebody ought to go back."</p>

<p>"He's better off dead," said Boston Bill.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the crowd&mdash;a huge, big-shouldered one at
the bar&mdash;made a full half turn. "I've seen that fellow
before."</p>

<p>"What fellow?"</p>

<p>"One that just walked in and walked out."</p>

<p>"Said he was new here," stated Lane.</p>

<p>"He didn't say it outright," pointed out the other. "I've seen
him before."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>The big rider searched his mind and found no answer, and shook
his head. Boston Bill drew partially out of his distant thoughts
and looked at the barkeep. The barkeep hadn't changed his attitude
in five minutes; he was a gloomy statue supported by the bar.
Nothing disturbed the tired, disillusioned mask of his face. "You
know him?" asked Bill.</p>

<p>"Am I supposed to know everybody that comes through?" said the
barkeep.</p>

<p>"You see them all."</p>

<p>"Some of them stop and some go on. Them that stop either pay or
don't pay. All kinds of people."</p>

<p>"You still worrying about your money?"</p>

<p>"You lads are tough on a man just gettin' by."</p>

<p>"Fix it up tomorrow," said Bill. "We'll sleep here tonight."</p>

<p>"Don't make a lot of noise," said the barkeep. "My wife's got a
bad tooth."</p>

<p>Some other man in the crowd turned with interest. "Why didn't
you say so? I can pull it. I used to&mdash;" He went no further. He
looked at Bill and walked to the far end of the room.</p>

<p>"Don't be bashful," said Boston Bill, his irony coming out
again. "There's men here who have more to hide than you do. Lane,
you better go out and relieve Rex. I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked at the open doorway and saw a man walk slowly across
it and disappear. "I think Goodnight will crawl in before much
longer. I'm going to stay up."</p>

<p>The passage of the first man had not caught his attention, for
he had thought it one of his own. But another man came into the
doorway's square and turned and stopped and looked at the crowd a
moment; and that man said, "Hello, Bill," and whipped out his gun
and fired.</p>

<p>Boston Bill whirled aside from the bar as the bullet struck. He
saw Harry Ide back away from the doorway into the blackness and he
shouted to his own men, "Get away from that lamp," and watched them
rise and swing in immediate confusion. He drew and killed the lamp
with a shot; and at the same moment a full volley crashed in
through the doorway, and somebody yelled in the darkness, and the
whole side of the house shook as another blast of gunfire tore
through the window that had been covered with the blanket. He
called: "Drop!" The crowd rushed against him, toward the back room
and the back door, and the pressure of the stampede swung him
around and slammed him against the bar, and somebody's elbow hit
him a hard blow across the face as he whirled and dropped behind
the bar.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; ACTION AT ROSELLE</h2>

<p class="first">BOSTON BILL dropped full length on the floor
behind the bar and heard the splintering of the wood above him as
the bullets of Harry Ide's party crashed into the saloon room,
through the front doorway and through the side window. The glass of
the window shattered and dropped, chairs and tables went down in
the violence of his own outfit rushing for the back room and for
the rear door. All these men were near the bar's end, trying to get
into the small room and slugging and cursing one another as they
jammed together. He heard one of his men die, he heard death come
as a rough tearing impact of lead through clothes and bone and
flesh, followed by a grunt and a sigh. The man fell against the bar
and slid around it, falling across Boston Bill's legs.</p>

<p>He had a creepy feeling about it and a small moment of panic
that made him roll and jerk his feet away; he kicked at the man,
feeling the soft, dull flesh give and roll back. He crawled farther
along the bar, keeping well down, using his forearms to drag
himself. Harry Ide, he thought, had traveled fast and with great
secrecy; otherwise he could not have gotten this far without being
spotted by one of his own men&mdash;Bill's men. Bill prided himself
on his scout system and now he thought that he had been betrayed
and even in this bedlam he remembered the men of his outfit who
were not here, and suspected them all.</p>

<p>The firing swung around. It seemed no longer to be pouring
through the front doorway; it seemed to be smashing against the
back end of the house, toward which his outfit fought their way.
The thing was terrible. It was a savage destruction that shook him
to the very roots of his courage. Lead flailed through wall and
room, making a sieve of the house; he heard more men yell and drop,
he heard them race back from the rear, run over the saloon room and
jump through the front doorway&mdash;and he heard them cry as they
were hit. Nothing in all his imagination was like this. He lay
flat, not so much frightened as cowed by the inhuman execution of
an idea. He said to himself distantly: "Nobody could do a thing
like this. Nobody."</p>

<p>Every muscle in him was so tight that he began to ache; the big
leg muscles of his front thigh were cramped. His mind was very
clear, very sharp; he heard every sound in magnified importance. He
followed the fight, and the shifting of Harry Ide's attack with his
ears and he thought now of one thing alone, his own survival. Ide
intended to wipe out the wild bunch, but Ide wanted him more than
he wanted the others. Ide would search every corner of Roselle,
break down every door, pour lead into every black corner in search
of him. He thought: "Why should he do it? There was room for both
of us. We could have gotten along."</p>

<p>The barkeep had been behind the bar at the commencement of
shooting, but had apparently slipped away. That made Boston Bill
think of this room quite carefully, visualizing it, and then he
remembered there was another doorway leading from the far end of
the bar directly into the kitchen. The main weight of fire seemed
to press against the back of the house, so that for the moment no
more slugs beat through the bar. Boston Bill rose to his hands and
knees and crawled on.</p>

<p>One palm came full and flat down upon a ragged splinter of glass
and the weight of his shoulders plunged the splinter deep into his
hand. He sat back, gritting his teeth together, and seized the end
of the splinter and pulled it out. Blood gushed warmly into his
palm; he untied his neckpiece and wrapped it around his palm,
closing his fingers on it, and got to his feet and moved forward.
His hands found the door frame; the door stood open before him.</p>

<p>He dropped again, crawling into the kitchen. He heard somebody
breathing heavily, not far away; he heard two people
breathing&mdash;the barkeep and his wife, he supposed. He crawled
on, listening to some of Harry Ide's men run fast and clumsy beside
the outer wall of the house, toward the front. He heard voices
sharp-calling out on the street, and once again the shooting boiled
up on that side. He crawled over the floor, striking a table and
going around it. He reached a wall, noting the dull patch of a
window above him. He explored the wall with his hand until he found
a door's knob. Opening the door, he drew back and waited.</p>

<p>Nothing happened. He stood up, flattened to the wall, and waited
again. Nobody seemed to be watching the door and in a moment he put
his head through it, seeing nothing at all in the curdled shadows
of the small alley running between the saloon and the adjoining
house. Drawing his breath, he stepped through, crossed the alley
and put his back to the wall of the other house. He had left the
most dangerous spot in town; he had gotten away from it into the
loose darkness. He let his breath fall away, and rush freely in and
fall away again.</p>

<p>The shouting went on, running at random through Roselle; it
reminded him of nothing so much as the howl of a wolf pack. The
firing broke out first at one spot and then another, each burst
telling him of another of his own men trapped. He stood helpless,
surrounded and desperate. Ide's men raced here and there, and then
a shout brought them rushing together and their firing rose in
smothering racket.</p>

<p>He crept to the rear end of the alley, stopped to listen at the
roundabout darkness, and moved farther from the saloon. He passed
four houses sitting side by side, rounded the last one and stepped
to the road which formed Roselle's main street. All the town seemed
in complete darkness, no light anywhere showing, and at the moment
the activity boiled somewhere behind the saloon. A man came out of
the blackness directly across from Boston Bill and ran down toward
the saloon, breathing in snorted gasps. At that same moment Boston
Bill crossed the street, ducked behind the buildings and ran toward
the old brick building which housed the horses.</p>

<p>He wanted one thing only, which was to escape; the weight
against him was too great and his chances too slim. Back in his
head was the knowledge that he had been badly caught off guard and
his reputation as a leader partly destroyed; his own outfit would
never again ride solid behind him unless at last he brought some
kind of order out of this defeat. They threshed headless around the
town, hunted and running, no doubt cursing him for his
carelessness. If he could get at Ide&mdash;He put the impossible
idea behind him. It was better to run, and to try again some other
time, even if it lost him his command over the wild bunch.</p>

<p>He came to the back doorway of the brick building and paused
there, listening in for the shuffle of waiting horses, for the
crunch of teeth against bit, for the small tinkle of bit chains. He
listened and heard nothing, and stepped inside to move softly over
the hard-packed dirt. He circled the inside wall, one hand well
before him, suspecting the presence of an Ide man. He was half
around the big room when his foot touched the yielding bulk of
something on the floor and stopped him. He drew away and he waited,
and suddenly bent and laid his hand on a horse. He turned back and
pointed directly for the outline of the rear door through which he
had come. He stumbled over two other horses before he got outside.
He went straight into the darkness fifty feet and sat down, sick
and trembling at what he knew. Not even the death of his own men
disturbed him so much as this new information: Ide had shot all the
horses to prevent his escape. That told him more clearly than any
other thing of Ide's frame of mind.</p>

<p>He sat there several minutes, like a man exhausted beyond the
ability to move. His mind would not work and his nerve had gone. He
said to himself, time after time: "I have got to get out of here,"
and then the question would come, "Where'll I go?" From his
position he saw the corner of the saloon and noticed a light
burning in it. Ide's men were moving rapidly down the street from
house to house, a shot now and then breaking the quiet.</p>

<p>He got up and walked the length of the houses, circling to the
road well below town. When he reached the road he moved toward Sun,
not sure of his intentions or his destination; and before he had
quite pulled himself together he bumped straight into a bunch of
horses gathered on the road and a man guarding them.</p>

<p>He had no warning and when he stopped he had nothing to say at
all. He stood still, watching the man's shape move in the dark. The
man said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Harry ready for me to come in with the horses?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Boston Bill.</p>

<p>"All right. I can't lead 'em all. You take some."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Bill. He moved around the man and reached a horse.
He stood still while the man waited. His mind began to work. He
went on from horse to horse, then he said, "This is mine," and
stepped into the saddle.</p>

<p>"You take that back bunch," said the man.</p>

<p>"All right," said Boston Bill, and drifted away. He was fifty
feet removed when the horse holder called after him. "Where the
hell you goin'?" He looked back and realized he was sheltered by
the dark. Digging in the spurs he raced down the road toward Sun
with a single bullet following him.</p>

<p><br>
Goodnight heard the sound of distant firing and stopped at once. He
sat still on the saddle, listening to the full-out vigor of the
shooting. The girl had been ahead of him and now turned and waited
in silence beside him. The sound was straight to the north.</p>

<p>"That Roselle direction?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How many men did Tower have with him?"</p>

<p>"Ten or twelve."</p>

<p>"That's not enough against Bill. You know these trails. Lead
off. We'll go there."</p>

<p>She didn't say anything. She struck into the darkness, going
north, and came to a meadow over which they passed. The trail
thereafter wound dog-leg fashion through the timber with no light
anywhere. It dropped into a shallow draw, crossed a creek, and went
up the bare side of a hill. On top of the hill, half an hour later,
he saw the top of Roselle's houses and one lantern bobbing along
the road. It took another ten minutes to come up against the back
side of Roselle. He stopped here hearing no more gunfire. "Over
with, one way or another. I'll ease up and see."</p>

<p>"Frank," she said, softly, "there's no need to bother. Ned had
enough to handle the wild bunch."</p>

<p>"A dozen's not enough."</p>

<p>"Might have been more than that," she said and went ahead of
him.</p>

<p>Her assurance puzzled him, and her lack of honesty with him
seemed strange. He went with her, rounding the corner of the saloon
at the same time the man with the lantern swung up. It was Ned
Tower. Presently somebody lighted the lamps in the saloon, that
glow springing out of the door. Ned Tower looked taciturnly at
Virginia. "You ought to have been careful comin' in here."</p>

<p>"When the shooting stopped," she said, "I knew the trouble was
over."</p>

<p>"So it was," he agreed. "But you shouldn't of been certain as to
who was doin' the shootin' and who came out on top."</p>

<p>"You had enough men to do it, Ned."</p>

<p>"So we did," he said. "But we never got the chance."</p>

<p>"Speak so I can understand you," she said impatiently.</p>

<p>"We been coolin' our heels in the brush, listenin to all this.
It wasn't us that did any fightin'."</p>

<p>"Then who was it?"</p>

<p>"Harry Ide," said Ned Tower. "I never saw anything like it, and
I hope I never do again. We were in the brush, about ready to move
in, when Ide hit town. He must of been scoutin' these hills for a
week. He must of had a hell of a crew on Bill's trail." Ned Tower
paused and rubbed his chin. He added, dry and glum: "He did the
job."</p>

<p>Virginia Overman sat thoroughly still, looking down upon Ned
Tower. The lantern light and the glow from the saloon played upon
her so that Goodnight, turning his attention to her, noticed the
strictness of her face. She was hard as iron at the moment yet her
voice came out quite small, quite uncertain: "Bill?"</p>

<p>Tower shook his head. "He got away."</p>

<p>Goodnight watched her features with a growing alertness. She let
her lips loosen, she drew a breath, and then she became aware of
his glance and made an effort to hide her feelings. Her whole frame
of mind at the moment was odd to him; it left him uneasy and
troubled.</p>

<p>Tower said: "But he's had his teeth pulled. The wild bunch is
busted up. You got nothin' to fear from Boston Bill any more."</p>

<p>"No," she murmured. "I see that."</p>

<p>"Should please you," said Tower, his black, brilliant eyes
fastened to her.</p>

<p>"It does," she answered, cold and distant.</p>

<p>"You show your pleasure in a damned queer fashion."</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>The barkeep came out of the door and stood in the night. His
face was round and dismal and gray. He ran a hand over his face,
squeezing out the oil film shining on his skin. He said in a groggy
voice: "I could of warned him. I knew it when the little fellow
came in for a drink. I knew the little fellow. I knew he was Ide's
man. But that's what happens when a man won't pay his bills. I
never lifted a hand. Awful close night. No wind, no air."</p>

<p>Virginia said, "I thought it was chilly," and looked at him.
Then she got down from saddle and moved toward the saloon's door.
Tower said in a sharp voice. "Don't go in there," and the barkeep
reached out with his arm to bar her way. She knocked his arm aside
with a sudden willful gesture and opened the door. She stopped on
the threshold and looked in a moment. She turned and came back to
the horse, and mounted. She stared at the ground, her mouth closing
into an unpleasant line.</p>

<p>Tower said irritably: "Couldn't you take my word for it?" He
shook his head. "That Harry Ide. It was a massacre and it will
stink up the mountain for fifty years."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking about him," she said. "He's probably camping on
Sun now with his outfit."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't worry about Harry Ide," said Tower.</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked. "What's to stop him?"</p>

<p>Ned Tower turned about and walked thirty feet down the street,
his lantern bobbing. He halted and he said, "This is what stopped
him."</p>

<p>Virginia and Goodnight rode forward. Ned Tower turned the
lantern slightly so that the yellow beams slanted downward upon the
man lying in the dust, face upward, his legs spraddled and his hat
rolled away. This was Harry Ide, his black hair stained by dust,
his face bleached of its color. One little spot of black-red stood
against his shirt to indicate what had killed him. "I got an idea,"
said Tower, "he was hit by one of his own men, unbeknownst."</p>

<p>"Which way," asked Goodnight, now thinking of something else,
"did the rest of his outfit ride?"</p>

<p>"Back toward Sherman City."</p>

<p>"Where'd Bill's men ride?"</p>

<p>Tower gave him a gray look. "Them that got out of this slaughter
house probably scattered any direction. They walked&mdash;they
didn't ride. Ide killed all their horses first thing to pin them
down."</p>

<p>"Kind of tough," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Tough enough," said Tower.</p>

<p>A man moved out of an alley into the lantern light. It was Bob
Carruth with a day's whiskers on his stout face, turned tough and
cranky by steady riding. He stared at Virginia in a way that
irritated Goodnight. It was a plain show of malice, of stiff and
settled dislike. His voice also echoed it.</p>

<p>"Well, Virginia," he said, "you got it all your way. Bill won't
be big enough to bother you no more and the desert crowd got a
broken back when Harry Ide was killed. It all came out your
way."</p>

<p>Virginia turned to Goodnight. "Let's ride back to Sun," she
said, and moved on with her horse. Goodnight came abreast of her
and presently Bob Camith swung up to them and these three rode the
black highway homeward, each one wrapped in silence. Coming down
the narrow meadow which faced Sun, Goodnight saw bunkhouse lights
burning, and lifted his voice by way of warning.
"Tap&mdash;Slab."</p>

<p>A shape showed momentarily at the bunkhouse door and slid on
into the dark. "Who's there?"</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;all right," called Bob Carruth.</p>

<p>The three rode into the yard. Tap and Slab came up. Carruth
said, "Anybody been here?"</p>

<p>"Boston Bill came by and stopped to eat. He went on. There was a
hell of a bust of riding around here afterwards. Small jags of men
comin' down from Roselle. They didn't stop here. What
happened?"</p>

<p>"World fell down," said Carruth crankily. "I'm goin' to tell the
cook to get somethin' on the table." He went away, leaving
Goodnight and the girl. She looked a moment at Goodnight, the
shadows covering whatever her face held. She dropped to the ground.
She said, "Put away my horse, Frank." Then her voice sank to a
lower tone, softer and warmer. "I'll be in the big room when you
come."</p>

<p>He took her horse to the corral, stripped off the gear and
lugged it back to the front porch. He dropped it there. She had
left the front door open as an invitation; she had gone to some
other part of the house. He looked into the front room for a moment
and turned away, crossing back to the bunkhouse. He had his own
blanket on the bed and his own traveling kit in the condensed-milk
box tacked up near the bunk. He took his shaving material and
walked to the kitchen. He got himself some hot water and shaved in
front of the back-door mirror; he washed up and he went into the
dining room, finding Carruth there. He sat down with Carruth,
waiting for the Chinaman to bring supper in.</p>

<p>Carruth stared at Goodnight's face. "Saturday night already?"
Then he got to thinking about it. "No, this is Thursday. Time's all
gummed up. Did you take a look into that saloon?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"It was bad," said Carruth.</p>

<p>The Chinaman came in with coffee and ham and eggs. He said:
"What's matter you not come when right time is to eat? All-time I
cook. I damn tired. Come and go, come and go. No good. This no
hotel."</p>

<p>Carruth reached for an extra cup on the table. He balanced it
and threw it and missed the Chinaman. The cup broke against the
wall and the Chinaman, once in the kitchen, began to curse. They
ate and they rolled up their smokes. Carruth said: "Well, she came
out on top."</p>

<p>"You said that before."</p>

<p>Carruth flicked his glance across Goodnight's face. He said:
"Where'd Bill chase you?"</p>

<p>"Up into a canyon. Old mining operation there."</p>

<p>"Glory Mine. Where'd you go then?"</p>

<p>"A trail took me to the main road over the mountains. I met
Virginia when I was riding toward Roselle. She had Tower and a few
men there, watching for Bill."</p>

<p>"A few men?" said Carruth. He shook his head. "You know how many
she had lined up? Close to thirty. She was waiting for Bill to
collect his outfit. If Harry Ide hadn't cleaned out that bunch, she
would have done it."</p>

<p>Goodnight said nothing. The information puzzled him. Virginia
might have told him this in the beginning, and had not. He could
not understand the reason for her secrecy except perhaps that it
was a part of her complete independence, her dislike to share her
affairs or her power with others. Maybe she was like her father. He
scowled over the cigarette smoke tracing aimless outlines on the
table with the thick hard edge of his thumbnail. Bob Carruth
studied him with a good deal of care, with a secret liking for him,
with a wish for his well-being that he would never openly have
expressed. This young man, Carruth had already decided, was meant
for the straight road and never any other. He was a man meant for
riding in the sunlight. He had sharp edges to him, a sound mind
untouched by the sly and evil and spongy thoughts of the wild
bunch. He was the kind of a man who needed to laugh and find fun in
the world. It had been a long time, Carruth guessed, since he'd
either laughed or been completely at ease. There was a weight on
him and a darkness, and he struggled with some tough problem that
would not let him alone, with some feeling that had him bound in
its thousand thin strands.</p>

<p>"Frank," said Carruth, "these hills are too damned full of
shadows for a man of your sort. Get back into the desert and ride
until you feel like you ought to feel."</p>

<p>Goodnight gave him a surprised, open look. "Where'd you pick
that up?"</p>

<p>"I can read what I see in front of me," said Carruth.</p>

<p>"A man," said Goodnight thoughtfully, "can never go back."</p>

<p>"A man can never do the same piece of the trail over again. But
he can always turn into the one he ought to be on."</p>

<p>"What trail?" asked Goodnight. He was interested. He watched
Carruth, asking a question he badly needed answered.</p>

<p>Carruth thought it out in his head over a long silence. He
searched himself, anxious to find something that would bite into
the young man's mind and strike response in his heart; at last he
shook his head. "I never was much for talk. I can't tell you." Then
with a mild sort of desperation he pointed toward the big house.
"But I can tell you one thing. The trail don't lay through that
door. Get your roll on your horse and get off the place before it
is too late."</p>

<p>"You don't like her," said Goodnight coolly. "I have noticed
that."</p>

<p>"I worked on this place twelve years," pointed out Carruth. "I
got my rights to like or dislike."</p>

<p>"Then why do you stay?"</p>

<p>"This," said Carruth, "is my last meal here."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Goodnight.</p>

<p>He got no answer to that. Carruth simply closed his heavy jaws,
rose and left the room. Goodnight tapered up a second cigarette and
lighted it and sat still, drumming his knuckles on the table. He
had the sensation of being afloat, of being carried downstream
against his will. He had muscles to use and a mind and a will, and
these lay idle and nothing good was done, and he sat sour and
restless, close by some one thing he needed but could not find. He
shrugged his shoulders. He thought: "I can do what I started out to
do. I can follow Boston Bill." It was like that with him now; he
had to have a chore, and this was his chore. He rose and left the
mess hall, moving idly across the yard toward his horse. He stopped
in the middle of the yard, looking at the open door of the big
house, and a breeze of interest suddenly blew through him and he
had a light and eager feeling that moved him to the house.</p>

<p>When he got inside he found Virginia waiting for him. She said,
"Shut the door," and watched him lay his big hand backward against
it. She had combed her hair, so that it lay soft and neat along her
head; she had changed her clothes and wore now a green dress with
faint threads of gold in it. Against it, her breasts and her
shoulders lay firm, and vitality came out of her, and in her steady
smiling was a warmth that fell generously upon him, with its open
invitation, its promise. She faced him with her calm waiting, proud
of herself and sure of what she wanted him to have.</p>

<p>He came toward her, wanting all of it. He put his hand on her
arm, watching her eyes widen. They were soft gray and light danced
upon them, making her spirit gay; he saw her lips lengthen and
began to draw apart and he guessed she was thinking of him in the
same violently desiring way he thought of her. He took her in and
kissed her, his mouth bearing down hard and heavy upon her. He felt
her wishes come up to him, he felt her give and he thought at that
moment he had reached the end of the road.</p>

<p>It was only a momentary thought. Deep in the thundering rush of
feeling, the chill of some strange and darkly unknown mystery came
in harsh countercurrent. He felt the wonder slip away, he felt this
woman retreat from him, he felt himself recoil. He stepped back
from her and he dropped his arms, looking at her and hating the
change with all his heart. The warmth of her lips had died in that
single instant; they had turned lifeless and unpleasant.</p>

<p>She knew it as well. Her eyes were wide and watchful, they
mirrored the oddest expression he had seen, cool and tragically
calm. She let her hands drop and her shoulders fell down and then,
to cover the blank, stony emptiness of what had happened, she began
to talk in a light, hurried way.</p>

<p>"You're all tired out. Why don't you turn in and get a long
night's sleep?"</p>

<p>"That will come," he said.</p>

<p>"Frank," she said, "those bunkhouse beds are hard. Use the extra
bedroom tonight."</p>

<p>"That would look odd."</p>

<p>"Does it matter?"</p>

<p>"Better not," he said.</p>

<p>She drew a short, swift breath. She looked closely at him,
trying to read the immediate things in his mind. "My father," she
said, "would have been happy. For the first time in twenty years
Sun has no strong enemies to worry over. Harry Ide hated us so
much. He made all the trouble. The rest of them won't."</p>

<p>"Fine," he said, "fine," and found himself struggling with a
leaden conviction. He had to leave here.</p>

<p>"Frank," she said, "I meant what I said the other day. You're
foreman." She watched him with a greater and greater closeness,
noting the stolidness coming to his face. He started to speak. She
stopped him by the quick onrush of her words. "How can I say what I
mean, Frank? Sun is as much yours as it is mine&mdash;if you wish
it that way. Or was I wrong in thinking you wanted me when you
kissed me?"</p>

<p>She made it harder and harder for him. Each word she spoke built
a fence around him, binding his sense of honor. In a little while
the fence would be too high.</p>

<p>"I'm pulling out, Virginia."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>It was like a cry, spoken rapidly and at the top of her voice,
full of dammed-up wonder and defeat and misery. The calmness went
away, the pride went away. She stood before him, stripped of
aloofness, turned naked to him by her defeat; in that terrible
instant he saw the glory go out of her and never afterwards did he
forget the moment. He shook his head. "I don't know why, Virginia.
Never any answer to a thing like that."</p>

<p>"I'm not enough, am I?" she asked him, holding herself together.
"Oh, don't bother to be nice to me. I want the truth. I'm not
enough. I've known it for a long while. I've known it ever since I
was a girl. I've looked in the mirror and seen it. I've gone to bed
and thought, through the hours, that there was something I didn't
have&mdash;never would have. What is it? Please&mdash;what is
it?"</p>

<p>"There's a man for you," he said. "For that man you've got
everything."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said, dull and bitterly sure. "No, I'll never have
it for any man. I can tell. By the way they look at me. For a
while, when you looked at me, I thought everything was all right.
You're the first one. I would have killed Bill for you, Frank,
because of the way you looked at me. Then you kissed me&mdash;and
you knew. Just as the others knew without kissing me."</p>

<p>The talk hurt him worse than a beating. It slashed his sympathy;
it broke through him in a thousand ways until he could no longer
keep his glance on her.</p>

<p>"Well," she said in a quiet, resigned tone, "put Sun Ranch with
me. Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, more and more embarrassed.</p>

<p>"No," she whispered, "of course not. It would do for Bill. But
not for you." She made a little gesture with her hands, resigned
and saddened. "It would be nice to have the love of a man, so
close, so strong, so deep. But I have other things and I suppose I
must be content."</p>

<p>He nodded and turned away. He reached the door when her voice
stopped and turned him. She came forward, managing a smile. She
took both his hands and held them a moment and the strange change
occurred once more in her, making her sweet. She wanted nothing of
him then, nor wanted to put her will upon him; and in this way she
was beautiful. "Good-by," she murmured, and kissed him and turned
away.</p>

<p>He moved over to the bunkhouse, past Carruth and Tap and Slab.
He rolled his blanket and came out and tied it behind the saddle.
The three men watched him as he swung up. Carruth smiled at him. He
lifted a hand at them and rode into the dark, toward Sherman
City.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Carruth in a soft, pleased tone. Tap and Slab
presently moved into the bunkhouse, leaving him to his reflections.
He was still there, fifteen minutes later when Virginia came out of
the house to him. She stood near him. She murmured: "I'm lonely,
Bob."</p>

<p>"You didn't have your way," he said.</p>

<p>"Is that it? Is that the thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I remember when you were a girl," he said. "A damned sweet girl
until somethin' went against you. Then you cried and busted things,
and everybody gave in. You always got your way."</p>

<p>"The things I wanted," she said, "were always right."</p>

<p>"It all led to this," he said. "Then this must be right, you
losin' this man. Therefore you should be glad, because it's right.
I'll be leavin', too. I have been ashamed of you."</p>

<p>She stared at him. She wheeled, looking wildly around her. There
was a chopping block near the door, with a small ax sunk into it.
She seized the ax and whirled with it, striking out at him, roused
to a rage that could not be controlled. He ducked as the ax grazed
his shoulder, and he turned and seized it and flung it away. She
came at him, her breath hard and heavy; she scratched his face
deeply and she slapped him and doubled her fists and hit him like a
man would hit. He caught her and pinned her arms to her sides. He
spoke through the strong draw of his breathing:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You didn't get your way."</p>

<p>She ceased to fight, she fell against him. He pushed her away
and went around the bunkhouse. He got his horse out of the corral
and threw on the gear and led it back. He went inside and rolled up
his belongings and came out and lashed them down. She stood dumb in
the shadows, watching him, her eyes round and unwinking. He had
started off when she called to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bob, don't go. I've got nothing left."</p>

<p>"You'll get somebody."</p>

<p>"No," she said. "Nobody'll stay. You're the only one. You're
like my father, you go back to the beginning. You put up with me.
Nobody else ever would. I'll be good. Don't go."</p>

<p>He was fifty feet away when he stopped. He heard her crying in a
small, helpless fashion and the sound went through him and got at
him. He knew the meanness in her, he knew the punishment he would
take from her in the future; but he remembered how she had been,
far back, as a small girl depending upon him and admiring him. It
was a tie that he couldn't break. He thought: "Well, Goodnight got
away. I guess one's enough. I guess I stay." He rode back to her
and got down. "All right," he said. "You can stop cryin' now. You
got your way."</p>

<p>"Can I borrow your horse?"</p>

<p>"Where you goin'?"</p>

<p>"To Sherman City. I don't want him to meet Bill. He's still got
his mind on killing Bill. If I can stop it, that will be a good
thing I've done, won't it?"</p>

<p>"You can try it," he said grudgingly. Then, as she moved away,
he called after her: "Leave Goodnight alone."</p>

<p>"It would do no good to see him again, Bob."</p>

<p>He settled back against the wall, smoking out a fresh cigarette.
He thought: "I suppose the next twelve years will be as bad as the
last twelve," and felt unhappy at his own weakness. Still, somebody
had to be by her. Somebody who knew her and could understand the
sweetness so interwoven with the badness. Then he thought: "I
wonder if she figures to get Boston Bill now, as the best of a bad
bargain?" The idea both alarmed and intrigued him. It would be like
her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; THE LAST
DECISION</h2>

<p class="first">BOSTON BILL reached Sherman City at midnight and
circled to the back side of a small house at the lower end of town;
this was scarcely more than a comfortable shed belonging to Mack
Honnicut, a prospector, who used it only as headquarters when he
came in from the hills. Bill moved into the place, lighted a lamp
and pulled down the blinds on the two windows. It appeared Honnicut
had recently been to town. The table was occupied with empty whisky
bottles, the blankets on the bed were all in a disheveled state and
a frying pan sat on the cold stove with its scum of bacon grease.
Bill found part of a drink in one of the bottles and sat on the bed
a moment to consider his position.</p>

<p>Harry Ide had missed him and would let no grass grow under his
feet to hit him again. Too much had happened to let it rest as it
was. Ide would be coming back through town shortly and no doubt put
up for the night, and soon enough would know that he, Bill, was
here. It was too small a town to hide in; too many eyes were always
watching. He needed a fresh horse, a meal and some supplies, and
then he needed to fade out.</p>

<p>He considered where he would go. His crowd was broken up. He had
no idea how many had died, and he refused to guess; that whole
scene in Roselle was too grisly a thing to face. As for those who
had escaped, they would no doubt be hiding in the hills. They would
not, for fear of Ide's further vengeance, go back to the
headquarters ranch and they would not stay too long in the
Owlhorns. He knew them too well to expect they would form again and
make a stand. They were outlaws, men on the run, brave when
cornered and fighting for their own particular lives or when the
weight of numbers gave them a feeling of safety. But once attacked
and defeated, they would run. They were that kind. Even if they
remained, Bill realized he could not go back to them. He had lost
his leadership over them. The plans he had so long nourished were
dashed down, his dreams of power were done. He got up and hunted
for another drink, and found it, and he had a good look at himself
as he stood solitary in the room; and he silently said: "Everything
I touch goes bad. It has always been that way. I was never born to
be lucky or successful. Not in the stars."</p>

<p>It was hard to know why that should be. He had a better mind, a
bolder and more fertile mind than any man in the hills. He saw what
other men did not see. He had no illusions to blind him and very
few scruples to halt him. He was a free man, possessing power and
ambition and logic. He could drive toward anything he wished and be
anything he wished, while lesser men threshed around without
energy, handcuffed by their stupidities or bound by a code of
morals meant for the common and the timid. Traveling thus, he could
travel far; for the world was the prize of the man who dared. Then
why had he not traveled far?</p>

<p>Somewhere his logic was at fault and somewhere he had failed,
himself, and he looked at himself in the furtive and fearful way of
a man who knows the fault and will not face it, and he said to
himself, softly and with self-pity, "I was born without luck. Damn
the world for cheating me of what is mine."</p>

<p>He remembered how near he had been to victory when, surprising
Ide on the latter's ranch, he held the whole key to his fortunes in
his hand. That had been the turning point; that had been the moment
of success and the moment of disaster. He reviewed it, morbidly
seeing it, desperately wishing thait it might have been different.
Goodnight had turned it into disaster.</p>

<p>"I should," he thought, "have faced him then. I was too easy."
Why had he not challenged him at that instant? Why had he not, when
other chances came, faced it out with Goodnight? Somehow he had let
his opportunities slip through his fingers. He reviewed those
moments one by one, seeking the key to his own failure, and in each
instance his sharp mind came back to something within himself that
he suspected and distantly knew, but would not openly look
upon.</p>

<p>"I've got to get away," he told himself, and left the house by
the rear door. He continued with the back line, going toward the
hotel with the intention of entering the kitchen for something to
eat and something to carry away. He came to the small yard behind
Rosalia's house and he saw the light shining through the window,
and hurried as he was, the light caught him like a magnet and drew
him to the door. He tapped on the door and opened it before he
heard her answer, sliding through and closing the door behind.
Standing in the kitchen, he saw her come tall and grave out of her
bedroom. She had her hair braided down for the night and she wore a
long blue robe, and she faced him in a way that made his defeat
indescribably the worse. This was the woman to whom he wished to
bring his victories; this was the woman he wanted to sway, to
seize. As in so many other events of his life, he realized he had
once come near to capturing her. Once she had looked upon him with
a different expression, interested and undecided. He had reached
for her and he had tried to command her, and had failed. Why had he
failed? It was the old question haunting him again.</p>

<p>"Rosalia," he said, and heard horsemen beating through town.
"What are you dreaming about?"</p>

<p>"Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"In the hills."</p>

<p>He noticed concern come to her face and he wondered at it. She
reached up, drawing the edges of her robe more tightly around her
throat. "What happened?"</p>

<p>"Harry Ide caught my party at Roselle. It was tough."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I expect he's still on my trail. I'm leaving."</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>He said, "Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>There was a shouting in town, the quick hark of voice answering
voice. Horses wheeled in the center of town and afterwards came
hard by this house, running down toward the desert.</p>

<p>She said: "Didn't Goodnight find you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't find him," he said. "I let him slip through my
fingers."</p>

<p>He saw the loosening of her body beneath the robe. He thought,
"All that beauty stirring at the mention of one man's name. All
that round, full surface responding to the thought of him. Why
isn't it mine?"</p>

<p>"Bill," she said, "you'd better go. Ide or Goodnight, one or the
other, will watch for you and trap you on some road, in some
canyon, down some dark alley."</p>

<p>"Do you care?" he asked and felt a small stir of hope.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "not for you. You deserve to die. Of all the men
I know, you are the one who best understood the things you were
doing. Every step of the way you knew good from evil, and knew you
were doing evil. Other men have done these same things, never
knowing better, or doing them because they felt they could do
nothing else. You did them because you wanted to, even as your
judgment warned you."</p>

<p>"Then why worry about me?" he said, short and sullen.</p>

<p>"I don't want another killing on Goodnight's record."</p>

<p>"That is the man, isn't it?"</p>

<p>She closed up and looked at him with her dark judgment. What she
felt was close and treasured and she would not cheaply share it. He
watched expression play over her expressive face; he saw the
generosity of her mouth, the glow of her eyes&mdash;and he would
have sold all his remaining hopes of life to have possessed the
wonder he saw at that moment in her. For he was a man keenly aware
of beauty, tortured by its nearness that never came nearer. He drew
a long breath.</p>

<p>"I've been a sinner. Who hasn't been? I am my own worst enemy,
but who is not? There has never been a day I have not thought of
you. Never a campfire I have not seen your face within. Would it
help if I told you heaven for me is in your eyes? Through all the
evil sounds of this world, I hear your voice. In the worst of
misery I feel the touch of your hand. Don't you suppose I know what
I miss when you hold your tenderness away from me? Don't you think
I realize you would be, for me, the greatest thing in my life?
Standing this near to you, I know I'm as close to goodness as I
shall ever be. I know. There is a part of me you could lift up
until the worst of me would die out. I know what I am, Rosalia. I
know what I have lost."</p>

<p>She shook her head and she was sorry for him. Pity came out of
her in a warm wave, changing her lips as she stood so solemn and
straight before him. She murmured: "It is strange, and sad."</p>

<p>"The strangeness is," he said in a changed and sulky voice,
"that I'd go down on my knees and bind myself in chains for
something you'll give away to Goodnight without any promise at
all."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said.</p>

<p>A hand tapped the back door. Rosalia went by Bill, to the door.
She stood there, listening to a man's soft voice, and she came back
to face Bill again. She studied him with another expression, turned
still and sure; and it came to him then as a queer thought that his
recent life had been thrown against two women poles apart except
for one common thing: they both had strong wills, they both had
iron in them. He had suffered defeat at the hands of both of them
because of it. Looking at Rosalia now, her silent resolution, her
calmness that weighed him and decided upon him, it was as though
Virginia stood in her place. They were both stronger than he was;
in one terribly candid moment he admitted it.</p>

<p>"You need a fresh horse," said Rosalia, "and some food to pack
with you. Rex&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man had apparently been outside the door all this while. He
said, "Yeah."</p>

<p>"Take Bill's horse over to the stable and swap his gear to a
fresh horse. Stop in at the hotel kitchen and find him some food he
can carry along." She looked at Bill. She said: "Your horse will be
at the stable. Good-by, Bill."</p>

<p>He sensed a change, he suspected it. "What's up?"</p>

<p>She watched him, knowing him and not wholly trusting him; and
there was a shadow of trouble upon her. "Harry Ide was killed at
Roselle. Didn't you know?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "No." But a black pleasure sprang through him and
he said, "That pays back some of it." He stood still, running this
new information through his head. It made a difference. It took
away the haste and the fear, so that the old illusion of personal
greatness came again, and he had his swift hope of retrieving glory
out of disaster. Everything changed that rapidly. He looked at her
and smiled.</p>

<p>"There's no hurry about the horse."</p>

<p>"Goodnight is still after you, Bill."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I'm after Goodnight. Do you think I'll let him
go? He was the beginning of this trouble."</p>

<p>"You'll go," she said, iron-calm again.</p>

<p>He understood what was in her mind and it made him a little
vengeful. "You're afraid he'll die."</p>

<p>"I don't want him to kill another man," she said.</p>

<p>"He won't," said Bill.</p>

<p>"And I will not have you standing in a dark alley waiting for
him."</p>

<p>The blacker side of his temper came up. "Let him fight his own
fight. If he's worth as much as you think, let him prove it. I
won't run from him."</p>

<p>She lifted her voice. "Rex," she said, and waited until Rex
stepped to the door. He had heard this talk; he had his gun half
lifted, half ready. "Rex," she said, "if this man isn't out of
Sherman City within fifteen minutes I shall blame you."</p>

<p>Bill stared at her, trying to face her down, to shame the streak
of cruelty she used on him; but she held his glance, stronger than
he was, simpler and braver and more primitive. He saw that she had
one great resolve, which was that Goodnight should not suffer; and
for that she would let nothing stand in her way. He shook his head
when he was certain of it and his last vague hope of winning her
died. He bowed his head. "You know," he said conversationally, "I
never really understood the people in this land. I never belonged
here."</p>

<p>"No," she said, "you don't. You will always be hunting a land
better than the one you're in. You will always fail. Good-by,
Bill."</p>

<p>He nodded and passed out, feeling the poorness of his showing.
He was bitter at her and bitter at himself and he went down the
alley with self-mockery in his heart and sly schemes half awake in
his head. Rex tramped behind him, all the way to the corral. Tex
called into the corral. "Jap. This man can have the big sorrel with
the star." He turned to Bill, dead-set and positive, a dangerous
man handling a man he believed to be less dangerous. "You stay here
while I go get your horse."</p>

<p>Bill watched him turn the corner of the saloon; he heard his
steps tramp steadily along the walk, that sound breaking into the
night stillness. The lights of town had been turned out when he
first had entered. Now they were on again, glowing from doorway and
window, and he knew men stood in the shadows watching him. On the
high side of town the sound of a horse came along rapid and
loose&mdash;the slightly ragged pace of a tired horse being pushed.
Bill drew back into the stable's arch, waiting.</p>

<p>The rider broke into view at the head of the street, shadowed
and unknown. The beams of house-light flickered vaguely on him as
he crossed them, swung at the corner and came straight for the
stable. Bill stood still, drawn half inside the stable's wide
doorway, turned keen as the rider moved through the stable, dropped
down and stepped aside from the horse. The man came to the mouth of
the doorway and paused there to build a smoke. He stood, bent
slightly forward, a gray and not wholly distinct shadow, and he
remained this way until he had finished his smoke. Boston Bill
heard the man's hands scrape along his trousers and his coat,
searching for a match, and then he heard the sound stop and he saw
the shadow grow still. Presently the man made a slow quarter turn
toward Bill. He had sensed Bill. In a little while his prying eyes
located Bill's shadow at the edge of the doorway. He waited,
cautious and silent, not sure of what was before him. He let the
silence drag, and grew weary of it, and challenged:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You got a match?"</p>

<p>It was Goodnight's voice.</p>

<p>Boston Bill started to answer and then his throat stopped up and
he remained still. He wanted to answer, he wanted to warn this man
he so thoroughly hated, this man at whose door he laid so large a
part of his recent misfortunes. He wanted to call his own name and
identify himself and then draw and have an end to it all.</p>

<p>But even as he wished to do this&mdash;wholly honorable and face
to face, without evasion or trickery as he had once said he
would&mdash;that streak within him which was sly and untrustworthy
got complete possession of him and would not let him speak. All his
words of bravery and all his wishing for a great life fell down at
a moment like this. The foundation of his nature was that unstable.
For a moment he faced the truth and was bitterly ashamed; and then
as he had done so many times before, he ignored his shame and
pretended it did not exist, and he stepped deeper into the shadows.
Thus he had Goodnight more clearly framed against the open arch of
the stable.</p>

<p>Goodnight said: "What the hell you fiddling around there for?
Stand still. Who are you?"</p>

<p>Boston Bill moved steadily backward. He touched the end of a
stall, he grazed the tail of a horse; he swung rapidly aside as the
horse, spooked by the unexpected contact, struck out with its foot.
Goodnight said: "Stand fast or I'll fire," and at the same moment
he drew out of the arch, into the more solid blackness of the
barn.</p>

<p>Boston Bill cursed himself for his lost chance. He drew and he
waited. He stopped, listening for the sound of Goodnight, and heard
nothing. He thought: "If I cross over and stand against the stalls
on that side I'll catch him against the light again." He moved out,
very softly and without any sound in the spongy dirt. He was half
over when a bullet's explosion battered the silence and cracked
against the sides and roof of the building. The breath of it
touched him; he heard the spent slug slap against a far board as he
jumped against the edge of a stall. He said aloud: "Damn you, I'll
outguess you."</p>

<p>"Bill," said Goodnight and remained silent a considerable time.
Then he said: "I came down here to wind up this deal. Step out to
the street."</p>

<p>"This is good enough," said Bill.</p>

<p>Goodnight listened to the voice carefully. He placed its source
somewhere along his own side of the stable halfway toward the rear.
He swung a little, watching for Bill to expose himself once more by
crossing against the pale hole of the rear entrance. He guessed
that Bill, in attempting to maneuver him against the front
entrance, had forgotten about the rear doorway. He waited, and as
he waited he remembered Niles Brand smiling at him and he turned
cold and hatred came to him again as it had so often before. He
felt it pour through him, changing him, chilling him. Patience made
rock out of him so that he could have waited forever. It was
waiting that would break Bill down, as it had broken McSween.</p>

<p>He heard at last a sigh come out of Boston Bill. It was a sudden
need for air which betrayed Bill and he seemed to know it, for he
began to fire with a pure recklessness, raking the corner of the
stable. Goodnight stepped inside an empty stall. He heard a horse
begin to thresh, and stumble and drop; he heard all the horses
fiddle in their stalls. He counted three shots and knew Boston Bill
could not have more than two more, counting the one bullet already
spent. Probably he had only one left. A man seldom rode with his
hammer lying on the sixth cartridge.</p>

<p>He called: "I'm comin' forward, Bill," and moved out of the
stall on soft feet. He meant to make his man back away toward the
rear door and thus come against the dull patch of light. He crawled
past a horse and halted at the edge of another stall; he slid into
it and repeated, "I'm comin' forward," and stepped on. He felt a
bridle hanging near by; he reached up, softly unhooked it from its
peg, and balanced it in his hand. He let a full half minute pile
up, and then threw the bridle across the stable. It struck with a
short echo, and drew Bill's fifth bullet.</p>

<p>"You wasted that one," said Goodnight. "I'm not there."</p>

<p>He made out the scrape of Bill's body against a wall and when he
heard it he drew up his gun and laid it on the vague patch of light
at the end of the stable and waited. It wasn't a long wait. This
man had less pure nerve than McSween&mdash;and McSween had broken.
Therefore he wasn't surprised when he saw Boston Bill's shape creep
out from the complete blackness and take shape against the rear
opening. Goodnight laid his gun against the shape and he held it
there to catch a good aim.</p>

<p>But he did a thing that he had not intended doing. Just before
he fired he dropped the gun's muzzle slightly and sent two bullets
low at Bill. One of them struck. Bill gave out a heavy grunt and
his shadow weaved and collapsed on the ground. He heard Bill's
breath quicken and draw deeper.</p>

<p>"You're hit?" said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Throw away your gun. Throw it this way."</p>

<p>Bill was out of sight on the ground. He was sighing, he seemed
to be speaking to himself. The better part of a minute passed
before Goodnight heard the gun drop on the ground. He stepped into
the middle of the runway, moving forward. He saw Bill's shoulders
rear up and plain caution made him spring aside, and so miss the
last bullet Bill flung at him. It was one of those tricks. He came
at Bill, his revolver sagging on the target that lay as a dull lump
directly before him on the ground. He said: "You played that one
too close, Bill."</p>

<p>"You broke my leg," said Bill, grinding his words between his
teeth. "I'm in bad shape. Light a match. You hit me in the knee.
You've crippled me. Light a match."</p>

<p>"No use botherin'."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't do it," Bill said. "I'm through. You wouldn't
shoot now."</p>

<p>"Think of Niles Brand," prompted Goodnight.</p>

<p>There was a part of a crowd on the street. He heard men's voices
out here. He heard a woman's voice, sounding like Virginia's. Bill
heard it too. Bill said to him in a more confident voice: "No, you
wouldn't." He called out in a suddenly anxious, high tone:
"Virginia&mdash;come here."</p>

<p>Goodnight swung back through the stable. The girl passed him in
the darkness, walking rapidly, and men came into the stable after
her. When he got to the sidewalk, he saw Syd there. Syd said: "A
bad job of it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Goodnight.</p>

<p>"Poor light for shootin'."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Goodnight. He moved to the Texican and stood by its
wall. He got to thinking about himself, and he said: "Why'd I turn
down a fair chance? Why did I fire low?" He was puzzled about it
and searched for some kind of answer. Three men walked out of the
stable, carrying Bill by him. Light struck from the saloon and ran
over Bill's face. Bill had his eyes shut and his skin was pale and
he held his fists together on his chest, his fingers tight.
Virginia walked behind. She saw Goodnight and stared at him as she
went by. She didn't stop, but the stare lingered with him. It was
as though he were far away from her, a stranger looked at without
recognition; and all this piled up on him until he crossed to the
Trail and signaled for a drink. He stood with his elbows on the bar
and he thought to himself: "Why did I fire low?"</p>

<p>He was disappointed in himself and the memory of Niles Brand
reproached him for a job poorly done; and still the drive was out
of him and he felt no more desire in the matter. He felt no
triumph, no regret. He was like a long-abandoned water-barrel on
the desert, empty, its staves warped, capable of holding nothing.
That emptiness was the only feeling he had. "Why," he asked himself
again, "did I fire low?"</p>

<p><br>
Virginia stood in the lobby, waiting. They had taken Boston Bill to
the back room at the hotel, that same back room in which Niles
Brand had died. She heard him lift his voice to a desperate shout:
"Get me off this bed!" She heard Syd say in his even, unsympathetic
voice: "Be damned if we spend the time to lug you upstairs. What's
the matter with this bed?"</p>

<p>"Get me out of this room."</p>

<p>"The bed sheets have been changed," said Syd. "They ain't the
same ones Niles Brand was lyin' in. That's fair enough, ain't
it?"</p>

<p>She watched Doc Teeter come in and go down the hall to the room.
She waited, her face sharp and set. She heard Bill groaning
steadily; she heard him cry out and curse as Teeter&mdash;whose
fingers had grown rough from handling so many men like
Bill&mdash;made his examination. She sighed a little, but not for
Bill. She had a problem in her mind and it engaged all of her
attention. Teeter came down the hall, the day's heat flushing his
face. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to get some chloroform. I'll need you. You can go in
there and wait. Settle him down."</p>

<p>"What's wrong, Doc?"</p>

<p>"Goodnight's bullet smashed his kneecap. I got to clean that
out. Go in there. I've seen men take it a lot better than he is.
Tell him he ain't doin' his reputation any good."</p>

<p>She walked down the hall, into the room. Syd and two other men
stood back, looking on with disinterest. They weren't enjoying
Bill's pain; they were simply calloused to it, watching his
weakness with some contempt. They expected better of him. Bill lay
under a sheet, he had his hands clenched together on the edge of
the sheet; he had torn it, and gripped another section, and torn
that. He kept turning on his shoulders and his face was gray, and
glistened damply. He stared at Virginia, the pupils of his eyes
large and black.</p>

<p>She said to the other men: "Go on out," and waited while they
went. She stood at the bed's side, looking down on Bill.</p>

<p>"Get me out of this room," he said.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with it?" she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her, and said nothing. It was Syd, just leaving,
who turned to answer her. "This was the room Niles Brand was in,"
he said, and went on.</p>

<p>She watched Bill, knowing him better then than she had before.
Her face took on its cool expression and he saw it at once.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of now?" he said. "What are you going to
do?"</p>

<p>"Stay by you, Bill."</p>

<p>"I can see something. Some scheme. Something up your
sleeve."</p>

<p>"No, Bill," she said. "I'm staying by you. You need me." He was,
she realized, a far weaker man than she had guessed. He was tricky
and he was dishonest. Even through his charm she had long ago
discerned that fact. But what she now knew was that he lacked iron.
He could be harnessed and he could be managed. As soon as she knew
it, she understood how it would be. This man was hers.</p>

<p>Doc Teeter came in with a small can, and a little cone-shaped
frame. He put these on a table; and presently the hotel man came in
with a pan of water that had been boiling. Doc Teeter took off his
coat and rolled up his sleeves; he opened the can and dripped some
of the liquid on the gauze which lay over the cone frame. The first
smell of chloroform brought a dead, dark expression to Bill's
face.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Get a bullet out of you."</p>

<p>"Let it stay."</p>

<p>"Sit on the edge of the bed, Virginia. You'll hold this over his
face."</p>

<p>Bill squirmed. He stared at Virginia. "Be careful with that
thing."</p>

<p>Teeter put the cone over Bill's face. Bill moved his face aside,
whereupon Teeter cursed him, and added: "Don't make trouble."</p>

<p>Bill's voice came out from the cone, muffled and touched with
panic. "Don't let him do anything drastic, Virginia. Look out for
me, will you? There's nobody else I can trust&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll look out for you," she said, and watched him slowly fall
asleep.</p>

<p>"This going to bother you?" asked Doc Teeter.</p>

<p>"No," said Virginia. "Nothing like that bothers me." She watched
Teeter pull back the sheet, exposing Bill's smashed leg, from which
the trouser leg had been cut. She said: "Will it cripple him?"</p>

<p>"He'll be lame," said Teeter. "But he don't have as much grit as
I figured."</p>

<p>"He'll do," said Virginia.</p>

<p>Teeter lifted the cone and looked at Bill's eyes and face. He
pinched Bill's skin. He gave Virginia an old, shrewd glance. "Your
man?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Virginia.</p>

<p>"You're takin' a chance. You know what he is."</p>

<p>"I can manage him," said Virginia. She watched Teeter set about
his work with an unconcerned method. She watched the instrument
drop into the bullet hole, but it made no effect on her. She was
thinking: "He'll be satisfied with the bargain. I know him that
well. He'll never love me very much, but neither will I love him.
Not at all. And I can hold him down. I know it." She thought of
Goodnight with a sharp start of longing. And then, to console
herself, she thought: "I could never have made him do as I wished.
But Bill will mind me. It is best that way."</p>

<p>Goodnight, having had one drink, moved out of the Trail, turned
the corner and walked in idleness toward the foot of the
street&mdash;toward that shed where he had met Niles days before.
He went all the way to the shed and stopped there, looking into the
farther shadows. He thought of Niles, and he thought of his sister,
and those two people were far away from him, and he was alone and
without anything to hold him. He turned and cruised back. When he
got before Rosalia's house he saw her on the porch, standing beside
the doorway's light. He came to her steps and he stopped and looked
at her. He sat down on the steps, and rolled himself a cigarette.
She was behind him.</p>

<p>"When does it rain in this country?"</p>

<p>"October."</p>

<p>He lighted the cigarette. He folded his hands together looking
out upon the shadows.</p>

<p>She said: "You're through now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Wish I knew."</p>

<p>She said: "Bob Carruth sent Slab down here to tell me you were
in trouble. I might have helped you. But I didn't come. You went up
there of your own will and you were old enough to take care of
yourself."</p>

<p>"That's all right," he said.</p>

<p>"You could have stayed on Sun, couldn't you?"</p>

<p>"I could have stayed."</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't," she murmured. "It is too late. You need to
ride, and be in trouble."</p>

<p>"No," he said, thinking it over. "I had a fair shot at Bill. And
I was thinkin' of Niles when I leveled the gun on him. Still,
before I fired I dropped the muzzle and shot him in the legs. I do
not know why."</p>

<p>"Frank," she said.</p>

<p>He rose and turned to her. He saw her round, stilled face. He
saw the shape of her shoulders and the shining of her black hair;
and he remembered the great wave of warmth that had come from her
lips, surrounding him with comfort and rushing its sweetness and
its discontent through him. She said: "The wish to kill him wasn't
in you."</p>

<p>"No," he said, "it wasn't. I must be&mdash;" He stopped to
consider it and his thoughts took him back. He stood in front of
her a full minute before he thought he had any kind of answer. "It
must be that I remembered McSween. Nothing came out of
that&mdash;nothing good. It didn't end anything. I don't regret it,
but it didn't make the memory of my sister any better. I suppose a
man learns these things pretty slow."</p>

<p>"You could have had Virginia, too," she said.</p>

<p>He ignored the question. He said: "It is hell to reach the end
of one road and not know where the next one goes."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you take her?" she asked.</p>

<p>He threw away the cigarette. Her presence came strongly against
him. He recalled her first kiss; and he recalled the last scene
with Virginia. Then he knew why he had not taken Virginia. He said:
"Because I kissed you first and there never was anything like it
afterwards."</p>

<p>He saw her face lift a little. He said, "Why, of course. I am an
ignorant man for not knowin' it before." He came forward and
touched her with his arms. "Is it that way with you&mdash;as it is
with me?"</p>

<p>She didn't answer him. She didn't move away at the pressure of
his hands; she didn't move forward. He pulled her to him, looking
down at her face as it came up. He saw her lips tremble a little,
and wait&mdash;and it was like a great burst of heat when he kissed
her and felt again that rush of inexpressible things through him.
He thought: "This is what has been troubling me," and he stepped
back. She was smiling at him; and now she held him.</p>

<p>"Frank," she said, "it was hard not to come to you. But I could
follow you no farther. I had to wait while you found your own
wishes."</p>

<p>"It takes a long time and a lot of misery," he said, "for a man
to come to what is right and to what is good."</p>

<p>"Now that you are here," she said, "I'll follow you wherever you
wish. I told you that in the beginning."</p>

<p>He thought about that and he said: "These hills are good. I want
to stay in them. I want to stay where I found you. I
want&mdash;"</p>

<p>The way he said it struck her powerfully, so that she could not
wait, for all that he said. The pressure of her hands drew his head
down and he met her lips again.</p>
