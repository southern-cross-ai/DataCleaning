<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h3>

<p class="first">EDGAR WALLACE made his name as a journalist with a series of reports from the Second Boer War written for the London <i>Daily Mail</i> in 1900-1902.</p>

<p>In 1901 Hutchinson &amp; Co., London, published 41 of these reports under the title <i>Unofficial Dispatches of the Anglo-Boer War</i>. In 2012 RGL published an expanded version of this collection containing 65 articles, some of which were written after the war. (See
<a href="http://freeread.com.au/@RGLibrary/EdgarWallace/NonFiction/ReportsFromTheBoerWar.html"><i>Reports from the Boer War</i></a>).</p>

<p>After the Second Boer War, Wallace continued to write for the <i>Daily Mail</i> while he pursued his career as an author of sensational detective fiction. Throughout most of his subsequent life he contributed articles, essays and sketches to this and other periodicals.</p>

<p>With <i>Edgar Wallace&mdash;Journalist</i> RGL offers a collection of these articles from the sources indicated after each title. They are presented in chronological order. They do not include the articles from <i>Reports from the Boer War</i>, or from <i>Red Pages from Tsardom</i> and <i>This England: Studies of To-day</i>, which RGL has published separately.</p>

<p>This collection will be revised and expanded as further newspaper and magazine articles by Edgar Wallace become available.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1902-11-19"></a>CORONATION NOTES</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Thames Star</i>, New Zealand, 19
November 1902</h3>

<p class="first">NOTHING outside the equipages of Royalty created
so much sensation and called for greater admiration than the
wonderful state coaches in which, some of the members of the
peerage drove to and from the Abbey. The Duke of Marlborough and
his Duchess rode through admiring crowds in a deep-crimson coach
with real silver fittings, which evoked, loud cheers. Consuelo,
Duchess of Manchester, appeared in a coach simply dazzling, with
a gorgeous hammer-cloth, which was only equalled by that of the
Duke of Somerset's new coach, whose hammmer-cloth cost him over
&pound;800. The Northumberland state carriage was a magnificent
affair in white and silver, carrying ten people altogether, five
of the family inside, and an equal number of the most elaborately
and gorgeously appointed servants clinging to the outside. One of
the most moving moments on Constitution Hill was when a strange
little company of white-haired men with medals on their coats
came marching&mdash;slow and stiff, but very proud and
erect&mdash;to one of the stand's. They were the survivors of the
charge of Balaclava. The Green Park was alive with fluttering
handkerchiefs, and cheers went up from the stands.</p>

<p>Never before in the history of England have grandchildren of
the Sovereign in direct line of succession been present in the
Abbey at the Coronation. The Coronation, it is estimated, cost
&pound;125,000. When Queen Victoria was crowned the cost was
&pound;69,401, at the crowning of William IV, &pound;43,159, and
the Coronation of George IV, &pound;243,388.</p>

<p>Two ladies with a bag of provisions took up a position on the
rising ground in Picadilly before midnight. They whiled away the
night reading by the light of a bicycle lamp tied to the park
railings. After waiting nearly fifteen hours they only saw the
procession through the kindness of a policeman. When the route
was cleared the crowd got in front of them, but the constable,
knowing how long they had waited, considerately passed them
through to the front.</p>

<br>

<p class="first"><span class="smcap">Mr Edgar Wallace</span> in
the <i>Daily Mail</i> thus describes the return of the
King:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="first">"AND now the Horse Guards, and in their rear a
glimpse of a golden panoply. No need to consult your programme,
the hurricane of cheers, the tossing hats, the shrill
acclamations of the women proclaiming unmistakably&mdash;the
King!</p>

<p>Nearer... the escort passes, and the finicking cream ponies
pick their way daintily. Crane forward... The King is
smiling&mdash;bowing and smiling. How well he looks. Left and
right he bows, the great crown glittering on bis head. You only
see him for a second. It is a glimpse of a very happy man&mdash;a
proud, contented man. A man, who has gripped death by the throat
and of his unconquerable will triumphed.</p>

<p>It is only a glimpse, for hardly does your eye rest on him
than you attention, your cheers, your love, is claimed by the
beautiful woman who sits by his side. Not smiling&mdash;but the
face of a woman whol is silently praying. Silent, and lovely, we
do her homage for the moment, and then she passes, and something
like a sigh runs through the crowd, and they forget to watch for
the Prince of Wales, but follow the great swaying coach with a
happy man and the pale woman with wistful eyes. The Duke of
Connaught and his soldier son you forget to notice. The Duke of
Portland, the Duke of Buccleuch pass&mdash;the King's procession
ends.</p>

<p>The interest dies momentarily, the passing gorgeous uniform
might be so much drab for all the effect it has upon the
spectator. Heads craned forward to see the last of the King's
carriage. Then the band crashes "God! save the King"
again&mdash;it is the Prince of Wales's coach passing.
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful," says an old lady, touching an
arm, and tears stand in her eyes. "What?&mdash;the procession?"
"No, sir; the Queen. Wasn't she lovely."</p>

<p>There was no lack of comic relief in the various incidents in
the vicinity of the Abbey. One of the peeresses, exhausted by
long waiting for her carriage, sat down in despair on the ground
in the courtyard with her velvet robes folded under her as a
cushion, while her husband sought the erring coachman attired in
his velvet and miniver. Another peer rushed, coronet in hand,
down the streets calling for a hansom, receiving an impromptu
ovation from the crowd, which disconcerted him a little.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful moments was the crowning of the
Queen, which was performed with her Majesty kneeling. As her
Majesty passed to her footstool the four duchesses advanced to
hold the canopy. Their crimson trains were spread fan-wise, and
when her Majesty rose their trains were readjusted by four
gentlemen. The Duchess of Buccleuch's page did the same to her
Grace's train. The King and Queen were evidently quite <i>au
fait</i> with the whole ceremony, and on more than one occasion,
when hesitation occurred, guided the procedure. The Queen was
assisted by the Bishop of Oxford, who took her hand whenever
there was a step to mount.</p>

<p>The crowning of the Queen was a much shorter function, but it
gave rise to one of the most extraordianry effects possible. At
the moment that the crown was placed on her head each peeress put
on her coronet, and, as seen from the peers' stand, the whole
bank of fluttering down opposite was in a flash converted into
one great white trellis work, in every opening of which a face
was framed. This singular illusion was produced by the hundreds
of pairs of white-gloved arms all simultaneously being raised to
an angle over the head.</p>

<p>The Maharajah of Scindia's jewels were brought to the Abbey
the evening before the Coronation. Previous to the ceremony his
Keeper of the Jewel's attended, and in one of the robing rooms
the jewels were put on. An eyewitness describes the Indian Prince
as being "swathed in diamonds."</p>

<p>The value of the actual contents of Westminster Abbey during
the ceremony is perhaps such as no human brain could estimate.
Apart from the regalia, the worth of one single diadem, the
Queen's crown, is computed at &pound;100,000. The solid gold
plate belonging to the Abbey and the Chapels Royal, if melted
down, would buy several warships. An increased value is added by
history, each piece having been the property of some English
sovereign.</p>

<p>Everybody admired the Queen's crown. It was specially made for
the, occasion, and was composed entirely of diamonds, each of
which is mounted in a silver setting. This is the only precious
metal which comlpletely shows the brilliance of fine stones. Gold
is only used on the inner and hidden portions of the mounting,
for the sake of lightness and strength. The circlet, unsurpassed
in effect by that of any existing crown, is 1&frac12; inches in
width, and is entirely encrusted with brilliants of the finest
water. These diamonds, varying in size from one specially fine in
color weighing, nearly 17 carats, down for the smallest necessary
to carry out the design, are of the most perfect cutting, and are
placed as closely together as possible throughout. This method is
adopted so that no metal is visible, and renders the entire
circlet one blaze of light. This rich band supports four large
cross-patées, and thee largest of these displays the Koh-i-Noor,
the grand and unique feature of the orown. Three very large
diamonds of extraordinary lustre occupy the centres of the other
cross-patées. The total number of stones used is 3,688.</p>

<p>By her Majesty's special command the crown was constructed as
lightly as possible&mdash;an immense advantage when in use. Every
effort experience and skill could dictate resulted in keeping the
entire weight down to only 22oz 15dwt, a result never before
attained.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1903-11-28"></a>THE HABITANT</h2>

<h3>A PICTURESQUE FIGURE</h3>

<p class="first">HE was seventy years old, was this
<i>Habitant</i>, and his name was Du Bois. As a matter of fact,
it is still.</p>

<p>His face is lined and seamed with the joys and sorrows of his
years. A large, generous mouth, grey twinkling eyes, a chin white
with the stubble of three unshaven days, and a hand heavy and
big. He smokes&mdash;and smoked&mdash;a tobacco which smells like
nothing so much as a conflagration in a soap factory. Often as
not he grows it himself, and its aroma reminds you of the fact
that tobacco is sometimes called a weed. His French is the French
of Louis Quinze, his English is broken and charming. His piety
and devotion to Holy Church are beautiful in their simplicity,
and his sentiments are Canadian. If he is more than usually
progressive they are Canadian-French.</p>

<p>He appeals to me, this <i>Habitant</i>, as a most
unregenerate, lovable, treasonable rogue. A big-hearted,
gentlemanly Anglophobe. I think I rather like him for his native
antipathies. I do not know whether this speck of grit in the
national bearings is not almost as healthy as over-much
lubricant. Nor do I think I am doing him an injustice when I
point out this&mdash;from a British point of view&mdash;weakness
of his. He sees things out of proportion, does this
<i>Habitant</i>. There is a story told which illustrates
this.</p>

<h3>A STORY</h3>

<p class="first">THE French lumberman who came down from the
backwoods, where news is scarce, found Quebec in mourning.</p>

<p>"De Queen ees dead," explained an acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" said our lumberman, and then, thoughtfully, "Who
have got de job?"</p>

<p>"Edouard," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Ba gosh," and the lumberman grew more thoughtful, "'e mus'
have good pull wit' Laurier!"</p>

<p><br> It is a little world of its own, French Canada. Outside
its limits there is nought worthy of consideration. And it is a
beautiful world. A world of forests, dark and sweet-scented; of
broad-bosomed rivers and flashing mountain streams. A world of
snug homes and kindly <i>curés</i>, of little fenced gardens and
big fenced fields. A world that wakes with white dawns, and works
from the moment the red sun gilds the village spire till the
spire's cracked bell tinkles the Angelus. Horny-handed, bowed-backed, hard-faced, and simple-minded are the people of this
world, earning their living by the sweat of their brow year in
and year out without question or complaint. Content to till and
harvest as their fathers did before them: happy to live the life,
hopeful to die the death, of their class and kind, such is the
way of <i>les Habitants</i>.</p>

<h3>AN ATOMIC SURVIVAL</h3>

<p class="first">WHETHER they love England little or much;
whether or not they look askance at an Imperialism unifying the
aspirations of&mdash;to them&mdash;an alien race; wherever and
however their ideals be grounded, or their conscious efforts
directed, they are none the less excellent citizens of Canada,
and helpful, however unwillingly or unconsciously, in the
building up of Greater Britain. They are an atomic survival of
mediaevalism; their laws, their customs, their very speech are
relics of another age. The <i>Grand Seigneur</i>, with his High
Rights, passed not more swiftly in France than did the Reds of
the Midi&mdash;that hungry, heroic crowd&mdash;in their march
northward. Untouched by the bloody shear that worked a frenzied
people's will, intimidated by no loaded tumbril jolting a pallid
aristocracy to destruction, the <i>Grand Seigneur</i> is to-day a
person&mdash;in Quebec. Perhaps he profited by example, and
perchance his right of pillory, pit and gallows, and others more
unspeakable, are as so many shadows; perhaps he has grown
bourgeois, and instead of exercising his lordly will to remove
the popular grievance, he writes to the newspapers&mdash;but
there is sufficient of the old <i>sieur</i> left to be
remarkable. "Quaint old Quebec," they call the town of that name.
Quaint is the term that describes all French Canada. And as to
loyalty to Great Britain&mdash;bear with me while I sound the
<i>Habitant</i>, and piece together from his broken English the
sentiments of <i>Habitant</i> Canada.</p>

<h3>M'SIEUR CHAMB'LAN</h3>

<p class="first">"PLAINTEE Englishman come to Canada now: on Ste.
Rose dey come also&mdash;et ees mos'ly <i>politique-fiscalité</i>, yas?"</p>

<p>Crudely enough I put the fiscal problem before him in a few
words.</p>

<p>"I s'pose mese'f dat beeg beezness on Englan'&mdash;Yas?
Milor' Chamb'lan&mdash;pardon, M'sleur Chamb'lan&mdash;mak'
plenty troub' wit' de fisc. De Canayen-Français, you compren',
not de Englishman-Canayen&mdash;hees not worry wit' fisc or w'at
Englishman t'ink. You tink dat cur'is? Mais!"</p>

<p>It is just lovely to listen to him, this seared old man with
the patient smile. He is so artless in the confession of his
political faith, he is so confident in the honesty of his views.
Sometimes, abandoning the rugged, home-made reasoning, bejewelled
with metaphor of forest, field, and river, he drops into the
stilted dogmatics of his favourite newspaper. You recognise as
you listen, and welcome almost as a friend, the tricky
phraseology of the partisan leader-writer. Then he breaks back to
the lake and the rapid as texts for his little sermon.</p>

<p>"Englan' she lak man dat tak' canoe d'écorce on beeg rapide.

curran she run too fas' as we can pull&mdash;we mus' mak' de
grande portage&mdash;yas?'"</p>

<p>Briefly, I sketched to the <i>Habitant</i> the possibilities
of preferential tariffs, and the closer union of the Empire. That
portion of the scheme which deals with the question of a
contribution to Imperial defence met with his emphlatlc
disapproval.</p>

<h3>PATRIOTISM.</h3>

<p class="first">"W'AT use mak' de foolishness lak dat?" he
inquired&mdash;for him&mdash; impatiently. "S'pose you mak'
trouble wit' La Russ; you 'ave beeg war wit' her&mdash;you holler
out, 'Come, Jean Du Bois, I mak' beeg fight wit' La Russ, you
com' right 'long an' bring wit' you all de frien's you can fin.'
I say, 'La R:uss don' mak' troub' w't' me, w'y shall I mak' worry
wit' de Englishman, her beezness?'"</p>

<p>All of which, as I sternly explain ed to the <i>Habitant</i>,
is most dreadfully unpatriotic. And what is patriotism? asked my
<i>Habitant</i>.</p>

<p>"Love for your country," answered I, unthinkingly, "and a
readiness to sacrifice, if needs be, your life at her need."</p>

<p>The <i>Habitant</i> looked a little puzzled. This, said he in
effect, is my country. Here was I horn as was my father before
me. Here are my children and my grandchildren. I know these
lakes, these woods, these fields, as I know my own garden. My
grandfather fought for this land, driving out the Yankees in
1812, while I carried my rifle in the Fenian invasion. I speak
French, but France is not my home. I live under the British flag,
but England is nothing to me. I am a Canadian first and last, and
if he who loves his country best is the finest patriot, then
there is no greater patriot than I.</p>

<p>Briefly this is the attitude of French Canada. It is actively
loyal to Canada; it is not actively disloyal to Great Britain.
"Canada first," this is its motto. Only there is really no
second&mdash;absolutely none. If you can understand a passion for
Quebec, with an apathy for the rest of Canada, and an attitude of
supreme indifference toward the remainder of the British Empire,
not to say the civilised world, you can understand the French-Canadian and place him at his value. He is not an Imperialist, he
is not a "Rule Britannia" loyalist: he represents Isolated
Parochialism at its best and worst; he is an anachronism, a bit
of the seventeenth century living on the fringe of the twentieth.
And, withal, he is rather lovable: if his outlook is narrow, his
humanity is broad: if his ideas are small, his heart is large. I
like the <i>Habitant</i>&mdash;Toronto, forgive me&mdash;on first
acquaintance he is pleasing, Perhaps if I had to live alongside
him all my life&mdash; But then, I have not.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1903-12-15"></a>CANADA'S SENTIMENTS</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Poverty Bay Herald</i>, New Zealand, 15 December 1903</h3>

<p class="first">THE cable messages have given some slight
indication of the deep feeling of resentment felt by Canada at
the recent judgment of the Alaska Arbitration Tribunal, but
though the newspapers raged and gave "scare-head" captions to
their articles upon the subject it would appear that the elder
colony of the Empire maintained a very dignified and sensible
moderation over the judicial reverse which her people so keenly
felt. The utterances of her leading statesmen have shown that the
tie with the Motherland will survive the strain of many Alaskan
awards. It is interesting, however, to learn how Canadian
sentiment was affected by the decree of the Commission, and this
is graphically told by Mr Edgar Wallace, the able war
correspondent of the <i>Daily Mail</i>, who happened to be in the
Dominion at the time. Mr Wallace writes:</p>

<br>

<p class="first">"TO deny that Canada is at the present moment
boiling over with honest wrath would be to deny that she
possesses any sense of rectitude, and that the spirit which she
has inherited from the Motherland, that abhorrence of injustice
which made a teapot of Boston Harbor, is still existent. How it
strikes you at Home I cannot gauge, but here in the heart of the
Dominion, where every man's first thought is of his country and
where patriotism swamps the personal equation, to one catching
the spirit of the people, and in one's sympathy unconsciously
expatriating oneself from Britain, there comes a momentary
glimpse of that inbred distrust of Englishmen and English methods
that is characteristic of the colonial attitude toward the Mother
Country.</p>

<p>"Rightly or wrongly&mdash;I am too near Hades to take a
dispassionate view of the Higher Criticism&mdash;the decision of
the Commission has widened the cracks and fissures in the
Imperial fabric to such an extent that one holds one's breath
lest a little extra strain should rend the structure from crown
to base, and split this great Empire as easily as lightning might
cleave an oak. You have only to think how near we have been to
losing South Africa when it was the toss of a penny whether or
not the <i>Vierkleur</i> should float from Capetown to the
Zambesi; you have only to remember how we lost the great country
that lies to the south of Canada and to realise that the hundred
years that have brought the steam engine and the electric
telegraph have not changed emotional mankind&mdash;since emotions
are not a matter of education, and the feelings of the man who
slips on the sidewalk are identical with those of William of
Normandy who tripped on the English foreshore&mdash;to know that
British injustice&mdash;as we see it here&mdash;has again set a
colony aflame with impotent rage, and the work of the last few
years of sane Downing street administration has been undone, in
as few minutes.</p>

<p>"You may talk to the Canadian until your breath fails, and you
will never convince him that Great Britain is not prepared at all
times to sacrifice Canadian interests to gain the goodwill of the
United States. Despite your Anglo-American societies, your flag-wagging, musical-hall outbursts of foolish sentimentality, the
eternal clap-trap of the destinies of the Anglo-Saxon
races&mdash;meaning the Anglo-American races&mdash;the Canadian
knows what you in England do not know: that commercially and
naturally the Yankee is the worst enemy Great Britain has in the
world; that nowhere is England more hated, that nowhere in the
world was news of British disasters in the late war received with
greater glee and more joyous celebration than in the Union.</p>

<p>"Here stories of unspeakable atrocities were given the freest
circulation, cartoons depicting John Bull in humiliating
circumstances were without exception the only kind published.
Tariffs designed to strike at Britain and Canada were erected,
and Canada being close at hand has felt the full lash of 'our
cousin's' venom. And all this time, the English statesmen have
been preaching the doctrine of closer relations with the United
States, Canada has been standing with her back to the wall,
fighting for "dear life against the attacks of this cousin of
ours. Do not think I am extravagant or intemperate. It would be
impossible for me to attempt to convey, except in the slightest
degree, the strength of the feeling between these two countries,
a feeling which is accentuated to bitterness by the finding of
the Alaska Commission.</p>

<p>"Canada has an excellent memory. There is not a child from
school who could not tell you the story of the Ashburton treaty,
by which Canada lost her free seaport on the east and a great
wedge of country which now constitutes the State of Maine. There
is a legend, too, of that same treaty by which, in addition to
the country on the east, Canada lost the States of Washington and
Oregon on the west; that these two States were lost because the
Commissioner, a great fisherman, could not catch salmon with fly
in one of the rivers and consequently handed over a country
containing so worthless a stream to the Union! It is only a
legend, and there is probably nothing in it, but it is one that
is half believed in Canada, and who shall say, with a knowledge
of the eccentricities of English statesmanship before them, that
Canadians do wrong to credit the seeming absurd?"</p>

<br>

<p class="first">HAVING thus pictured Canadian sentiment as it
is, the correspondent proceeds to outline the possible
consequences. He does not believe for one moment that as a result
the preference granted to the Mother Country will be withdrawn.
Canada is too large-minded, too broad-visioned, to play the tit-for-tat game. But she may well reconsider the question of tariffs
if. the unmistakeable voice, of England rejects Mr Chamberlain's
proposals, calculated to encourage her agricultural industries.
Canada, Mr Wallace declares, will never join the Union.
Washington's dream of a united American from the Tropic to the
Arctic can never be realised. American as they are in habit, in
method, in literature, and&mdash;to the Britisher inexperienced
in the niceties of accent&mdash;in tongue, yet they are as
distinct from the Yankee in thought, sentiment, and morality as
is New Orleans from Dawson. Canada's natural way is the way of
independence. Unhampered and untrammelled by overmuch
interference from Downing street she is steadily following the
inevitable course of her great destiuy. If she is turned aside it
will be towards England. If England does not invite her before
she passes out of reach or earshot she will make for nationality.
At present Great Britain's hold on the colonies is purely
nominal&mdash;there may come a time when the assumption of
"possessing" such a colony as Canada will be farcical. There may,
too, come a time when if England's invitation is not too tardy,
and Canada, harkening, inclines her steps toward the Mother
Country when the Canadian and the British interests will so blend
and be so indispensable one to the other that the question of
separation will be as remote as the days when Anglia and
Northumbria stood for distinct national ideals.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1904-01-09"></a>MONTREAL&mdash;THE LONDON OF THE WEST</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Ashburton Guardian</i>, New Zealand) January 9, 1904</h3>
<br>

<p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Montreal</span>, Canada, November 7, 1903</p>

<p class="first">I WAS asleep when I tumbled out of a Pullman on
to an almost deserted platform. I dreamt still of the morning
glories of the Hudson river, the sheer, green-dappled banks, and
the broad, lordly stream; the blue Katskill Mountains rising fold
on fold, the hidden heights of the Adironacks, the wondrous
beauty of the autumnal foliage, and the grey lakes in the
twilight of the forests. It was one long, confused dream.</p>

<p>I dozed as I handed my keys to the Custom-house officer, and
what time he was laying bare the mysteries of my wardrobe I was
mentally surveying the bleak baggage-room for something
comfortable to sit on. In a haze I walked to my cab and sank
blissfully into its snuggest corner. It was the driver who roused
me to wakefulness <i>"Où vous descendrai-je, m'sieu?"</i> he
asked.</p>

<p>Then it was that I knew my journey from New York was indeed
completed, and I was in Canada. It is one of the annoyances that
beset the path of the travelling Imperialistic Britisher that
there is something in the language or custom of nearly every
British dependency calculated to impress him with his own crass
ignorance. It is so much simpler and easier to be a stay-at-home
Little Englander, to ignore the Colonies as factors in our
national life, to dismiss their importance with a wave of the
hand, and settle their complex problems&mdash;conveniently
translated into English by obliging partisans&mdash;with a stroke
of the pen.</p>

<p>Because if you want to get down to bedrock principles, to
investigate conditions and grievances at first hand, you must,
before you start off on your quest, take a thorough course in
languages, which will include French, Dutch, Spanish, Italian,
Portuguese, Hindustani, Tamil, Chinese, Asiatic, Greek, and about
three hundred separate and distinct native dialects. Thus will
you be able to hold converse with your fellow-subjects the Empire
over from Canada to Cyprus, and from Hong-Kong to Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Here in Montreal a somewhat fragmentary knowledge of the
"taal" helps me not at all. For two-thirds of the citizens are
French, the policemen, the postmen, the very elevator boys in
your hotel speak but broken English, and the more influential
portion of the city's Press is printed in the language that the
unintelligent Englishman associates with menus. This is a fact
forcibly brought home to the unlettered stranger, for whom the
oft-repeated warning in park and square, "<i>Ne passez pas sur le
gazon</i>," has no especial terrors, so that he will transgress
with a blissful tranquility of mind until a kindly policeman
brings hian back to what are literally the paths of
righteousness.</p>

<p>And this is Montreal: Imagine a beautifully-dressed woman, in
down-at-heel slippers, or a city of noble buildings&mdash;and
primitive roadways; imagine a city with cathedrals built on the
plan of St. Peter's at Rome and Nôtre Dame of Paris&mdash;with
wooden side-walks. Electric cars whiz over corded roads, and
broughams and motor-cars jolt unevenly along the tree-fringed
avenues. Montreal is the worst-paved city in the world,
considering its pretensions, considering, too, that here we have
the New York of Canada, the London of the West.</p>

<p>Perhaps the former title better suits this mother of cities.
French-American she is essentially. Forget, the fact that
orchestras play "God Save The King" at the end of performances:
that that population's loyalty to the Throne, is
unquestionable&mdash;forget these, and there will be no single
thing to remind you that you are on British soil. The stamp of
America is on the town and on one-third of the people, and Holy
Rome looks down from a dozen emulating spires and turrets with a
benign eye upon the faithful majority.</p>

<p>American in commerce, American in habit&mdash;we drink ice-water for breakfast and in driving keep to the
right&mdash;American in speech, in thought, and&mdash;except for
the reverence it has for the Throne and Person&mdash;in
sentiment, it promises, if it be the microcosm of a composite
Dominion, to render the student's path by no means one of
roses.</p>

<p>For here in Montreal you have every evidence of a dominant
Roman Catholicism, a religious dictatorship, a power which,
scornful of dissemblance and fearless of criticism, might well
stand behind a Government or a people indicating its requirements
and urging its demands, strong within the unassailable
battlements of its sanctity.</p>

<p>For good or for ill the power of the priesthood stands as a
very real and tangible factor in the future of this Colony. For
good one cannot but think, since the traditions of Canada are
made glorious by the memory of her brave priests' deeds, and
since foremost among her pioneers went these pale-faced, dark-eyed priests, carrying with that fearlessness which is equally
shared by fanatic and fatalist the elements of Christianity to
the wigwams of the Iroquois. And since Montreal owes its very
existence to the attempt made a century ago to form a veritable
kingdom of God on American soil, the manifestation of this ideal
cannot fail to be gratifying to those who believe&mdash;as some
do&mdash;that the progress of a country is naturally coincident
with the prosperity of the Roman Church.</p>

<p>I have spoken of Montreal as being the New York of Canada, and
it does seem, from ite very position, that not only will it be to
Canada what New York is to the States&mdash;as indeed it already
is&mdash;but in course of time, remembering the enormous
resources of Canada, it will be equal in wealth, population, and
importance. Like New York, practically an island town, it has
greater opportunities for expansion, and if it has the
disadvantage of being closed to river traffic for certain months
in the year owing to its frozen waters, it is far nearer to a
free seaboard&mdash;free in a purely climatic sense&mdash;than is
that other great lake town, Chicago.</p>

<p>The French-Canadian of Montreal cares little enough for the
future; lives very much for to-day. See him, clean-shaven,
sharpfeatured, somewhat sallow, and wearing his hair in a sleek,
rigidly-trimmed bunch at the back of his head. Slightly below the
medium height, yet a man of some brawn; lithe and alert in his
movements, voluble and buoyant in his speech, remarkably
expressive in his gesticulations&mdash;a Frenchman who can ride,
shoot, swim, or row&mdash;that is the French-Canadian. He is much
more of an athlete than his brother across the Channel. He is
less emotional, cooler-headed, and has such a fund of common
sense as to almost denationalise him. Essentially be is a
Frenchman, and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>Perhaps it is that he has absorbed something of the qualities
of his English neighbor; perhaps its is only that he is French
and not Parisian&mdash;we sometimes confuse the types. At any
rate, he is an excellent companion this Frenchman. When he gets
over the natural suspicion with which all Continental races
regard the Englishman he will become expansive.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1904-01-23"></a>IN NEW CANADA</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Evening Post</i>, New Zealand, 23 January 1904</h3>

<br>

<p class="first">QUEBEC is a bit of old France transplanted
across the ocean; Montreal is twentieth-century American in the
middle of the street tapering off to Louis Quinze sidewalks;
Toronto is openly, unblushingly American in a hustling,
unwearying fashion&mdash;this you will find if you do business in
this queen of cities. Toronto is also aggressively British, and
Orange at that.</p>

<p>Exactly whether the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne is
observed I cannot say, but this I know&mdash;Toronto is
Orange.</p>

<p>Ottawa is the cleanest of little towns. Here England and
France hold equal sway, and here every man you meet who is not a
Civil servant is a Yankee drummer.</p>

<p>Leave behind you Montreal and Quebec, Ottawa, and Toronto, and
the lesser towns about. Go north from Toronto, straight up the
map to where the Canadian Pacific Railway bustling westward forms
the never-ending top line of a capital "T."</p>

<h3>IN HIAWATHA'S LAND</h3>

<p class="first">GO to bed on the couch that has, at a porter's
magic touch, sprung into existence from nowhere in particular,
and sleep. You will run so easily that you will doubt the man who
tells you the number of miles per hour you are travelling.</p>

<p>In the morning you will awake and find yourself in Canada. Not
the Canada, you have been visiting this past three weeks; not the
Canada of tall smokestacks belching bellowing blackness; of
broad, straight streets and ten-storied stores&mdash;but the
Canada you have read about, dreamt about; the Canada that your
youthful imaginings people with hooked-nosed red men in the
wholesale scalp business. Straight young trees all crimson and
gold trembling in their gaudiness; lush grasslands sloping to
little white-frothed torrents. Great rugged kopjes with firs atop
and a hundred varieties of vegetation softening the harsh
outlines of their bases. Hollows and hills and thick, clustering
copses. Here a rushing rapid and there a big placid stretch of
lake with little wooded isles and tree-grown shores.</p>

<p>Your fancy will people the waste as the train flashes
westward. Here, by the side of this dancing, darting, whirling,
rock-fretted current might well have lived and loved the dusky
Minnehaha. Stealing through this little wood,into which the train
plunges for a minute and then throws backward might easily have
come Hiawatha, himself. You get a momentary glimpse of a
squirrel, a comical furry streak that flies at the train's
approach.</p>

<h3>THE BOOK OF NATURE</h3>

<p class="first">"DO not shoot me, Hiawatha," you murmur
unconsciously. All day long you will travel with your unopened
book on your knees reading the great story of nature in the ever-changing pictures of Manitou Himself. 0 the joy of it! that first
day's ride westward.</p>

<p>Stand on the observation platform and watch the track drawn
from under you; watch trees and stones and hills and lakes fly
backward and disappear at each fresh turn of the road. Watch the
horizon of the greak lake, watch the purple-blue islands, and the
daintily scalloped bays, and the rivers splashing over tiny
Niagaras in their haste to join this fresh-water sea. Feel the
keen autumn air and catch the glorious scent of the pines and you
will not nave lived in vain.</p>

<p>Day will follow day. Portage, lake, river, road, hill, river,
township, lake, portage, wood, lake&mdash;so they will follow end
on end. No two rivers quite the same. Some choked with a thousand
jumbled logs, some clear and still, and black with the shadows of
overhanging trees. Some racing and roariag between rocks that
show up like the blackened fangs of some submerged leviathan. No
two towns; no two hills, or woods, or clearings; each
characteristic of its peculiar self. Nature broke the mould of
each wild thing she shaped. The eye does not weary nor the mental
palate clog of this over-loveliness.</p>

<h3>THE CHICAGO OF CANADA</h3>

<p class="first">THE country is one great flat expanse, patchily
wooded and decorously watered&mdash;how sedately the streams roll
hereabouts! Then, before the flatness becomes monotonous or the
wheat-bearing qualities of the black-turned earth can be fully
explained by the Yankee drummer in the smoking room, the train
runs through the outskirts of a township, which proves to be a
town, which, as solid stone buildings spring across the line of
vision, and electric tramway-cars pause in their wild flight to
let us pass, proves to be the city of Winnipeg, the Chicago of
Canada.</p>

<p>Canada is proud of Winnipeg&mdash;although not quite so proud
as Winnipeg is of itself. There is a mild jealousy between towns
in the East. When they wish to be very nasty they speak
slightingly of the hustling qualities of each other.</p>

<p>"But," says Toronto&mdash;"But," says Quebec&mdash;"But," say
Montreal, Ottawa, Hamilton, London, and Windsor&mdash;"if you
want to see a Real Live Typical Canadian city, a city that will
Open your Eyes and make you Marvel, go to Winnipeg!"</p>

<p>And that is just what Winnipeg is. It is very real. It is very
much alive&mdash;except on Sundays, when it atones in tiptoeing
silence for its youthful indiscretions&mdash;and it is very
typical of this young nation of Canada. It is the new Canada, the
Canada of to-morrow.</p>

<h3>THE PRIDE OF THE DOMINION</h3>

<p class="first">MONTCALM and Wolfe, Quebec and the Heights of
Abraham, the historical richness of the East are things apart.
Tbe East stood for civilisation; now it stands for settled
orderliness. Not that the West is any the less law-abiding than
the East. But it is so boundless, so vast, so illimitable, so
wondrously potential that the older provinces of the Dominion,
cramped by routine, narrowed by invariable system, and made small
in Western eyes by the knowledge of their limitations, are
regarded as but appendants to the West. And Winnipeg is the key
of the West, the heart of it, the barometer of its
prosperity.</p>

<p>In Winnipeg you get no chance of showering encomiums on the
city. The baggage man who takes your traps from the depot gives
you a précis of the history of Winnipeg, the elevator-boy
contrives between the first and the fourth floors to inculcate a
knowledge of the relative importance of Winnipeg and the rest of
Canada, The chambermaid, depositing clean towels in your room,
lingers at the door to deliver a disquisition on the Rise and
Growth of Winnipeg, with some Remarks on Its Remarkable Future.
The polite clerk who registers you, the imposing barber who
removes the three-day stubble from your chin, the bell-boy who
brings you distressing cablegrams from headquarters, all
contribute their quota to your education, and the head waiter, as
he arranges your serviette before you, leans over the back of
your chair and asks in a respectful whisper. "What do you think
of Winnipeg?"</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1904-09-09"></a>MOULAI THE FOOLISH</h2>

<h3>A WELL-INTENTIONED SULTAN<br>
HAS SACRIFICED HIS COUNTRY</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Narromine News and Trangie Advocate</i>, NSW, Australia, 9 September 1904</h3>

<h3>MOULAI THE FOOLISH</h3>

<p class="first">Mr. Edgar Wallace, special correspondent of the
London <i>Daily Mail</i>, wrote from Tangier on June 20th
last:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THAT excellent and amiable young man, Moulai el
Aziz, is probably at this very moment opening packing-cases at
his palace in Fez quite unconscious of the steel wedge of
civilisation that has been thrust into the hitherto impenetrable
casing of his Empire&mdash;a wedge that, so far, has not
misplaced or strained in the slightest degree the fabric that it
will one day splinter and tear and destroy.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder whether Moulai cares overmuch; whether he
would not welcome, even at the risk of his throne and life, the
Europeanising of Morocco, and would not exchange his precarious
magnificence for a guaranteed security and a more modest
state.</p>

<p>Imagine, if you can, the Czar of All the Russias casting
envious eyes on the Principality of Monaco, and you may gauge the
state of mind of Sultan Moulai at the moment.</p>

<p>There are two views of the Sultan of Morocco, and both are
correct. There is one which sees a prodigal, a vain spendthrift,
an, irresponsible dilettante, and the wrecker of his country,
There is another which shows a modest, good-hearted, sympathetic
soul, with European tendencies. As I say, both views are about
correct.</p>

<h3>THE DISRESPECTFUL TRUTH</h3>

<p class="first">IT is difficult to hit upon an expression that
exactly describes him. The brutal Anglo-Saxon phrase that conveys
the best expression of his Majesty, is, to my mind rather
disrespectful.</p>

<p>The Sultan is "a young fool."</p>

<p>Every father in the world who has to put his hand into his
pocket to pay his son's bills; every man who has had a younger
brother constantly getting into a row; every head of every school
in the world will recognise the type, and will oblige me by
passing on to people who are not so well-informed the exact shade
of significance my description has.</p>

<p>The Sultan has no great vices: indeed, for an Oriental be is
singularly healthy-minded. The stable has a greater attraction
for him than the seraglio&mdash;that is one of the grievances
Morocco has against him&mdash;and he is not bloodthirsty; indeed,
I do not think that even in his folly he is a weak man.</p>

<p>The greatest of his sins from the European standpoint is his
reckless extravagance. He is a sort of Jubilee Juggins. He has
got the spending habit in its most acute and worst form. He
throws away money on the most paltry excuses, and will cheerfully
spend a thousand pounds, when to spend a shilling would be rank
folly.</p>

<h3>SEVENTY-SIX WATCHES</h3>

<p class="first">AN English catalogue came to his hand one day.
Idly turning the leaves, he came upon the illustration of a gold
watch. Beneath the cut was a detailed jewelled-in-seven-holes-and-lever-escapement description, which showed, as it was
intended to show, that the man who had gone through life without
possessing watch No. XZ 98, had lived in vain, and that without
that watch life was a dreary, sorrowful vale of colorless days
and breathless nights.</p>

<p>"I want this watch," said the Sultan, almost ashamed for the
moment that he had been so long unpossessed of this
masterpiece.</p>

<p>The Grand Vizier bowed. "How many shall I order for your
Majesty?" he asked.</p>

<p>The Sultan thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"Seventy-six," he said. It was the first number that came Into
his head.</p>

<p>Mouths afterwards a great packing-case arrived at the
palace.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty's watches have arrived," explained an
official.</p>

<p>"Watches? What watches?" asked Moulai in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty ordered seventy six."</p>

<p>The Sultan yawned. "Did I?" he asked carelessly. "Well, I
suppose you would like two?"</p>

<p>The obsequious official prostrated himself in ecstasies of
delight.</p>

<p>"And you, and you," said the Sultan, indicating various
members of his court.</p>

<p>Of course they would, and so the watches passed round the
court, and never one of these marvellous time pieces did the
Sultan retain for himself.</p>

<p>He has a garage, in which stand twenty automobiles. Except
within tho limited area of his palace there exists no road in
Morocco fit even for a cycle.</p>

<p>He possesses scores of aluminium cycles, which the slightest
obstacle crumbles like paper. He has a gold- and diamond-studded
camera which cost him £2000. He takes four snapshots a month, and
has a store of photographic paper valued at £400.</p>

<h3>PALACE LUMBER</h3>

<p class="first">HE has lumbered up his palace with tawdriness
and drained his exchequer to buy a hundred specimens of the one
thing in the world he does not require. He has outworn the
patience of his European friends by a hundred childish whimseys,
and has alienated the sympathy and loyalty of his subjects by
aping those English qualities  which Englishmen least admire.
Think of him riding out in public in the pink coat and white
stock of the hunt. Think of his looking-glass bedstead, his
musical boxes, his mechanical toys, his cameras and gramophones,
and the never-ceasing procession of packing.cases arriving from
Europe brimming with trumpery gew-gaws, the contents of which may
keep his interest aroused for ten minutes, but certainly no
longer.</p>

<p>What of his army and what of his people?</p>

<p>His army is an untrained, undrilled, lawless rabble. And he is
to a great extent responsible. He might, now, have had a force at
his. back that would have kept him secure upon his throne.
Regiments have been raised, equipped, and drilled by English-officers. Then, without warning, they have been disbanded, the
horses sold, the equipment disposed of below cost. Why? The
Government needed money. Moulai el Aziz needed money&mdash;money
for air-guns, and ping-pong tables, and motor cars and mechanical
toys.</p>

<p>His people despise him, as why should they not? He has
outraged all conventions&mdash;and Mussulman convention is
Mussulman law&mdash;by introducing into Morocco customs and modes
of living utterly at variance with the Eastern idea. Had he been
a stronger man, had he been better advised, he might have earned
the hatred of the Moors of to-day and the gratitude of posterity.
He might have outraged convention by initiating reforms that
would have been of lasting benefit to his country.</p>

<h3>THE CHANGE THAT IS COMING</h3>

<p class="first">HE might have made both Europe and Morocco his
debtors, and held off for another hundred years the danger of
foreign occupation. But as it is, he has no friends. His follies
have isolated him. It way be politic to save him his throne. It
may be necessary&mdash;it will be necessary&mdash;to protect him,
not less against himself than against his people, but outside the
help that policy dictates there is nothing for the young Sultan
of Morocco and his unwise counsellors but that variety of mild
contempt that one reserves for wilful children.</p>

<p>The change that is coming to his fortunes is coming quickly
enough. The revolution that is to set Morocco ablaze from end to
end is all but kindled. This time it will not be a case of an
ambitious pretender seeking adherents to a personal cause. It
will be the people against Moulai. The Sultan alone seems
unconscious of the impending disaster. He does not know&mdash;he
of all people &mdash; hat Morocco is unanimous in its intention
to strip him of his authority.</p>

<p>That Morocco will succeed in its designs upon the Sultan is
only possible should Moulai remain in Fez. It is urged that
whatever happens he must remain in that city, for to surrender
Fez is to surrender the throne.</p>

<p>Sentimentally this is, of course, true, but for the young
monarch to remain in his present position is for him to court
calamity. "Who holds Fez holds Morocco," the saying goes, but a
live Sultan under the guns of the Powers in Tangier is better
than a very dead Sultan in Fez.</p>

<p>Moulai has now one chance. He may come to Tangier and place
himself under the protection of the French Minister, a course,
that he will, I have not doubt, adopt. He will lose Fez; the
whole of the interior of Morocco will take up arms against him,
and the country will have to be systematically and vigorously
subdued, one might even say reconquered&mdash;but all this is
inevitable under any circumstances. He will save his throne,
which is a consideration for Europe, and he will save his head,
which is a greater consideration&mdash;for him.</p>

<h3>As published in <i>The Cobar Herald</i>, NSW, Australia, 10
September 1904</h3>

<h3>THE STEALING OF A MAN AND THE COMING OF A FLEET</h3>

<p class="first">On June 17th, Mr Edgar Wallace wrote to tho
London <i>Daily Mall</i> from Tanglers as follows:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="first">IF you look out of your bedroom window to the
left, you will see the hills of Andulusia, quite close at hand.
And Andalusia is Spain, and Spain is quite European, and almost
civilised.</p>

<p>If you turn your head ever so slightly to the right, you will
see at your feet, Tangier, which is Darkest Africa and the
Mysterious East all rolled into one. Also, it is the first or
second century&mdash;or, rather. It is before the Christian
era.</p>

<p>Mohammedanism is almost a modernity. Tho electric light
flickering feebly at the corners of dark passages may pass for a
miracle. The hotels are improved caravanseries, and need not
count.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is the food, or the methods, or the rooms, but
whatever it is, there is nothing in the average Tangier hotel
that clashes with that prevailing spirit of antiquity which is
Tangier's very own.</p>

<p>Low hills, all olive-green, circle the blue bay. A thin golden
ribbon of beach separates the blue and olive of land and water,
and, perched uncomfortably at an angle of 30 degrees, Tangier,
all of a jumble, sits with her feet in the sea.</p>

<p>Tier on tier, flat roof of flaring orange overlooking flat
roof of washed-out blue, a white, bright, yellowy Jerusalem of a
town, it rises&mdash;Tangier ancient, unchangeable,
insanitary.</p>

<h3>THE UNIVERSAL EAST</h3>

<p class="first">IT is Eastern; the East one reads about in one's
callow youth; the turbancd East; the East in jellab and fez; the
East that carries spears and quaint, long-barrelled, queer-stocked guns; the East that says its prayers on Liberty carpets,
and goes to the mosque at all sorts ot inconvenient hours.</p>

<p>Laden donkeys stagger through the cobble-paved passages that
serve for streets. Coal-black negroes, all thews and perspiration
jog past you with tinkling bell and bulging, dripping woter-bag
Grave Jews in black, shavon-headed hillsmen all in rags, curious
visitors from Fez&mdash;you know the curiosity that is expressed
by a scowl&mdash;and slovenly soldiery in soiled tunics pass and
repass you every second. Blanketted ghosts of women, their faces
muffled, shuffle awkwardly from street to street.</p>

<p>A bored little boy leads a hideously blinded old man to a
group of idlers in the thronged marketplace. The old man whines
his formula, and the little boy, with his eyes fixed on a troupe
of acrobats, repeats the appeal mechanically.</p>

<p>"In the name of God, who will buy me a little oil for my
supper?"</p>

<p>"... for my supper?" pipes the boy abstractedly.</p>

<p>But the bogging bowl goes unfilled.</p>

<p>A lisping objurgation in Spanish from one. "Go away can#t
you?" in English from anothe; only a Moor stops in his stiide to
search a capacious leather bag at his side, and throws five
centimes into the outstretched hands. "In the name of God"</p>

<h3>"AMERICO"</h3>

<p class="first">A BABEL of voices around you, In this same marketplace. Arabic mostly, then Spanish, then French, and somotimes English.</p>

<p>"Say!"</p>

<p>An American "jacky," as bright as a baby's smile and as
incongruous a vision in this out-of-the-world spot as an
automobile in heaven.</p>

<p>"Say! Where'ss this English post-office?</p>

<p>He has a little group of Arab boys about him. Open-mouthed,
abashed little boys filled with the wonder and awe of youth for
mankind in uniform.</p>

<p>Little Raisuli riding fiery Arab sticks and armed with deadly
accurate bamboo canes, slung at their backs with strings of
cotton, cease their maraudings, and the blubbering infantle
Perdicaris seizes the opportunity of making his escape.</p>

<p>Debonair and happy-go-lucky, with a a smile on his wind-bitten
face, the man who has come to stop Raisuli's greater game passes,
down the ill-paved streets, followed, by the awe-stricken youth
of Tangier.</p>

<p>"Ingles?" asks, villager from Fahs of the seller of
charcoal.</p>

<p>"Americo," answers that wise gossip, and spits
reflectively.</p>

<p>I think that this is the only dark spot on&mdash;Raisuli's
otherwise irreproachable reputation; the only point on which
Tangier&mdash;the real Tangier that lives on fried fish in rancid
oil&mdash;is not prepared to see eye to eye with the popular hero
of the moment.</p>

<p>Tangier is beginning to think that perhaps Raisuli was a
little indiscreet in his selection of a victim. It was, says
Tangier, sitting cross-legged on a greasy divan, with its shoes
left at the door, it was very foolish to take the Americans. Had
it been only an Englishman....</p>

<h3>STEALING AN AMERICAN</h3>

<p class="first">IF the truth bo told, there was a time when
Tangier did not hold this doubt of Raisuli's wisdom, when it
chuckled mightily over the brigand's exploit, and voted that
gentleman what is Arabic for 'the limit.' But the joke of the
thing had scarcely taken definite shape before all the warships
in the world came chasing into the bay.</p>

<p>And all the warships in the world flew a flag that has
absolutely no right to be within 3000 miles of Tangier.</p>

<p>These lean white ships came to anchor and sent men
ashore&mdash; ships postmen and chief petty officers
mostly&mdash;who spoke the English language with a White Star
accent. Then news filtered through to the bazaars and to the
stuffy cafés. It came from various sources. From Moors that
waited at table at the hotels; from outdoor servants at the
Legations; from Moors who knew Spaniards who know everything;
from donkoy-boys and boatmen, and even beggars.</p>

<p>And the news was to this effect Perdicarls, who was stolon
from Tangier, was an American; the ships that were crowding up
the bay were American also&mdash;except the one stove-polished
vessel that had suddenly appeared from nowhere, and that was
English&mdash;and it seemed that the taking away of Perdicaris
had annoyed and agitated the United. States of America to a
lamentable and quite unjustifiable degree. America has no sense
of humor, said Tangier, only, of course, in more Oriental and
stately language. Raisuli's joke was not appreciated, and the
warships had come fully prepared to work all kinds of mischief to
the archltectural glories of Tangier.</p>

<h3>COMIC OPERA WARFARE</h3>

<p class="first">AT first Tangier was astonished; then she was
pained; then the blind, unreasoning passions of the
East&mdash;the true East&mdash; were  aroused. The frantic fear
of weak men at the mercy of the strong lay on the souls of
Mahomet Ali ben Absolom el Hassen.</p>

<p>The fierce pride of this strange people that has resisted the
advance of civilisation for a thousand years, was inflamed, and
for a time it looked as though the presence of the American
warships was likely to have an effect other than that
anticipated.</p>

<p>Chrlstians were stoned&mdash;furtively, if you can imagine a
furtive stoning. The infidel was insulted in the streets, and one
unimportant holy man, a sort of Eastern Dowle, was all for
preaching a holy war against. Christianity generally. He raged
along the beach half-naked and called us horrible names, but his
friends got him away and put him to bed, and in the morning he
apologised like a little gentleman. One man&mdash;it was on a
Mohammedan feast day, and therefore pardonable&mdash;discharged
his ancient musket at the <i>Baltimore</i> and sat down on the
sands waiting for the ship to sink. In fact, in the language of
local journalism, "Excitement was running high in Tangier, and
all the best people of the town regarded the situation as
serious.</p>

<p>But serious situations in Morocco come and go like April
rains. The Affaire Perdicaris is quite serious enough; how
serious will not  be realised until after his release. For then
it will be that the Powers will talk with painful plainness to
Morocco, and the ships that are lying idle in Tangier Bay will
serve a most useful purpose.</p>

<h3>COLONEL'S SEARCH FOR A WIFE<br>
BRIDEGROOM'S DEATH</h3>

<h3>As published in<br>
<i>The Gundagai Times and Tumut, Adelong <br>
and Murrumbidgee District Advertiser</i>,<br>
NSW, Australia, 18 November 1904</h3>

<br>

<p class="first">Mr. Edgar Wallace's search for a wife for a
British Columbian colonist has had a tragic sequel.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that some months ago, when Mr Wallace
was engaged on a series of articles on "The Homeless Poor of
London," a description of the life of poor, destitute girls
inspired Mr. Cochrane, a young colonial farmer, to apply to Mr
Wallace for his offices in choosing a wife from among these
homeless ones.</p>

<p>Having secured satisfactory references from the young man,
with a certificate as to his good character from the Rev. Mr
Duncan, of Salmon Arm, British Columbia, Mr Wallace set about
choosing the girl.</p>

<p>The letters of the colonist were published and his needs made
known through the columns of the "Daily Mail," and the result was
that over six hundred girls expressed their willingness to go
out.</p>

<p>"It will be a Robinson Crusoe sort of life," wrote the young
colonist, "amid the silence of the tall firs and the everlasting
snows of the mountains." Yet, in spite of the lonely life
promised, the applicants were numerous; not even the prospect of
a log hut for a house and the isolation of their new home
deterred them.</p>

<p>From among many applicants one was chosen. Three hundred might
have been chosen just as well, so excellent were the
qualifications of the girls. A cablegram was sent to the Rev. Mr
Duncan asking him whether he would offer a home for the girl
until she was married, and to this he Immediately agreed.</p>

<p>A telegram was sent to the girl telling her that the choice
had fallen upon her, and in response to Mr. Edgar Wallace's
request she called upon him the same night, and was given the
money necessary to purchase a few articles for the journey. </p>

<p>By arrangement with the Canadian Pacific Railway, the girl was
to have left London to embark on the <i>Lake Manitoba</i> for
Canada.</p>

<p>Early the next morning a cable arrived at this office.</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">COCHRANE DIED SUDDENLY. &mdash; DUNCAN.</p>

<br>

<p>In this laconic message from the kindly pastor of Salmon Arm
is the shattering of the poor girl's hopes. With her scanty
trousseau all ready for embarkation within a few days of her
romantic wedding, the lover she had never seen, tbe husband she
had never met; dies suddenly in all the loneliness of the
Rockies, and the silence of the tall firs, as he himself
described it.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1905-05-15"></a>TROUBLESOME MOROCCO</h2>


<h3>TANGIER: THE TOWN WHERE HISTORY IS BRING MADE</h3>


<h3>As published in <i>The World's News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 13 May 1905</h3>

<p class="first">OF late the cables have had a good deal to say
about Morocco and the trouble brewing there. Particular interest
attaches to Tangier, since the German Emperor visited it, and in
view of the future possibilities a description of the place'at
the time of the Kaiser's visit will interest all our readers.</p>

<p>There, is a great stretch of bay, dotted by in numerable boats
(writes Edgar Wallace in the "Daily Mail"), a jumble of gleaming
white houses rising tier on tier, distant stretches of rugged
blue hills, tall minarets of green-tiled mosques, and a long
ribbon of yellow beach to mark where land and water meet.</p>

<p>Months ago, before ever the name of Germany was connected in
any way with Morocco, the people who gathered in Moorish cafés,
drinking mint tea and smoking vile hasheesh, speculated on the
coming of someone who would "free" Morocco.</p>

<p>These people spoke the name of Moulal Aziz and spat, called
him openly Moulal the foolish, Moulai the Christian, Moulal the
unprintable; and they burnt fires on the hills about and gathered
in their hundreds, by tribes, to hear the story of how Moulai had
sold Morocco to France.</p>

<p>There is little wonder, therefore, in their enthusiasm at the
Kaiser's advent, remembering always the sedulous efforts of the
German agents to implant in the Oriental mind a picture of
Wilhelm the Liberator.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand why the unofficial Spaniard
has accorded such hearty welcome to the German War Lord. The
Spaniard easily predominates in Tangier, outnumbering English and
French combined by 12 to 1.</p>

<p>Spanish is the language of Tangier, next to Arabic, and there
is scarcely a Moor who does not speak the dialect of
Andalusia.</p>

<p>The Spaniards regard Tangier as theirs by right,of commercial
conquest; a French occupation would necessarily be more
distasteful than English.</p>

<p>The ex-War Minister lives in a little palace that stands high
on the sea-front, looking towards the blue mountains of
Spain.</p>

<p>I went to see him once (says Mr. Wallace). A pleasant, refined
Moorish gentleman with laughing eyes and hands that were more
expressive than speech. It was a pleasant experience to find a
War Minister who treated me with considerable deferencnce. A very
discreet  man, Menhembi, and a brother Briton, being, in fact,
Sir "Somebody" Meuhembi, 'K.C.M.Q.  He is never tired of telling
about that investiture.</p>

<p>"I am a British subject," he smiles quietly, as though
enjoying the recollection. "I admire British methods of
colonising; how can I do otherwise? I have seen Egypt. One day I
hope to see India; they tell me that is more wonderful still."
</p>

<p>The Sultan made Menhembi a British subject in reward for his
services! Later the Sultan desired to confiscate his properly and
arrest Menhembi, and found, to his cost, that while having a War
Minister who is a British subject had many .advantages, it had
its compensating drawbacks, for no sooner did the Sultan's Mahala
surrouud the palace of Menhembi than a British cruiser came
streaking across from Gibraltar, and wanted to know what all the
trouble was about. That is why Menhembi smiles when he says he is
a British subject.</p>

<p>He must have been a curious, sort ot War Minister, for he, is
covered with battle scars.</p>

<p>Though Tangier threw itself open to receive the Kaiser, though
cannons boomed and drums beat, and all Morocco bowed down to the
great War Lord, yet one place was closed to him. Perhaps the
Moors are the strictest of all Mahommedan sects; no Christian
dog, be he king or peasant, can profane the sanctuaries of Islam
in Morocco. The mosques of Tangier are closed to all but the
faithful.</p>

<p>In the light of the opinions expressed in this article, it is
not difficult to understand why the inhabitants of Morocco object
to the proposal of the French Government to open a highway
between Tangier and Fez. The landing of the French engineers to
construct a harbor at Tangier may lead to serious trouble.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1905-05-27"></a>THE REALITIES OF WAR</h2>


<h3>As published in <i>The Star</i>, New Zealand, 27 May
1905</h3>
<br>

<p class="cp">(By <span class="smcap">Edgar Wallace</span>, in
the London <i>Evening News</i>)</p>

<p class="first">TAKE one dead man. One man done to death
violently. One man whose soul has been wrenched from his body
without a second of grace.</p>

<p>Outstretched on the frozen ground, with a bitter wind whirling
the show-dust over the tense, still face, he lies, that once was
a breathing, thinking man. Hands half-clenched, defy the flying
clouds, and the eyes that stare, but do not see, look wonderingly
upwards.</p>

<p>Take this one man, this fragment, this smallest and least
considerable pawn in the great game, multiply him by fifty
thousand, twist him, as the grotesqueness of your fancy dictates,
into ten thousand horrid shapes; embellish your awful picture
with the unprintable details of battles&mdash;remembering always
that the bullet does not always kill cleanly, and that bursting
shrapnel and one-pound automatic guns create a havoc that can
only be imagined by people who have served on coroner's
juries&mdash;and you have formed in your mind something like the
battlefield of Mukden.</p>

<h3>THE MEN WHO RAN</h3>

<p class="first">WHERE the victorious army has passed, where the
retreating army has retired, panicky and demoralised, with
ducking of heads and affrightened glances over shoulders, when
men have whimpered arnd sobbed in their rage and rear, the
dormant fears of childhood responding to the knowledge of the
death behind; where men running for cover have suddenly squealed
like frightened horses, and tumbled over and over like rabbits,
on this deserted battlefield there lies the silence of the
grave.</p>

<p>The Things that lie so still seem part of the white earth on
which they lie, be closely cuddled to the earth they are.</p>

<p>There is fighting yet, for the horizon is ablaze, and the
<i>guhr-r-r-r-r</i> of rifle fire comes borne on the cold north
wind.</p>

<p>It will be hours yet before the will-o'-the-wisp lanterns of
the search parties come flickering over the plain, separating the
quick from the dead, composing these poor limbs, digging great,
trenches, and clearing away in the darkness of the night the
awful work of day.</p>

<h3>THE PATIENT VULTURES</h3>

<p class="first">BEFORE they come, the lantern men with their
bamboo stretchers, the birds will have arrived. For the birds
will drop out of the sky, and stand in a contemplative circle,
waiting.</p>

<p>Great, beastly birds, with sleek, black coats and beady eyes.
They will wait, for they are patient, till quivering limbs are
still, till every sign of life has departed, before they do their
work.</p>

<p>They will wait days, if needs be, but their wait will be
almost fruitless, for long before carrion can take on courage the
burying regiments will have cleared the ground, leaving only the
horses and the dumb beasts who have fallen victims to the
disputes of men.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1905-10-26"></a>GEORGE</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Catholic Press</i>, Sydney, Australia, 26 October 1905 </h3>

<p class="first">I WAS at home to receive George. I was in the
garden wandering somewhat abstractedly up and down when they came
to me and told me that George had arrived.</p>

<p>Soon after, I was invited in to meet him. He was tremendously
agitated, and was shouting his orders at the top of his
voice.</p>

<p>It struck me that he was making himself very much at
home&mdash;after all, it was my house; not that he cared: he
scarcely noticed me; in fact, I don't think he even nodded.</p>

<p>There is something radically wrong with England; the fine old
courteous manners, the stately bows, the artistic salute of other
days are forgotten, and so, far from giving me any of his
society, George seemed to sleep all the time during the first
four days of his visit. This sounds very much like exaggeration,
but I can produce witnesses.</p>

<p>All that I heard of him was his grumbling, indignant, what-the-dickens-next voice raised at meal-times&mdash;he took his
food in his own room&mdash;a practice of which I most certainly
do not usually approve.</p>

<p>George&mdash;his name is really Bryan something-or-other, but
I call him George after a favourite cabman&mdash;is rather a
reticent chap and his manners are not particularly good. But for
certain expectations that we have, I do not know that I should
tolerate his presence in my house.</p>

<p>For instance, when I met him a few ?days after he came I did
my best to be polite and make him feel at home. "How do you do?"
I asked, with grave courtesy. But George favoured me with a
prolonged stare as though he had never met me before in his life,
and yawned undisguisedly.</p>

<p>"Are you enjoying your stay?" I asked desperately; for however
rude one's guests may be, there is really no reason why one
should imitate their vices&mdash;even hospitality has its
limits.</p>

<p>George turned his head abruptly away and pretended to be
engrossed in the landscape.</p>

<p><br>
HE has been under my roof now for over a month, and I have
scarcely got a civil word out of him. It is very hard to be
snubbed unmercifully in one's own house, and by one who is
practically a perfect stranger. I find his visit all the more
trying because we have so few tastes in common. George has a
practice of turning night into day, and the noise of his
Bacchanalian revels at 2 a.m. rouse me to something akin to
fury.</p>

<p>For I am helpless. He neither cares for what I threaten nor
pays the slightest attention to my entreaties. He treats me with
marked coolness, and once&mdash;the indignity of it!&mdash;put
out his hand and touched me as if to satisfy his mind upon the
question whether I was really alive or if I went by
machinery.</p>

<p><br>
ANOTHER two months has passed: George is still here. I wonder
whether he expects us to support him permanently? I have
discovered one or two quite human traits in him. He is possessed,
I find, of an inordinate vanity. He will, if he be encouraged,
spend hours before his looking-glass, murmuring appreciatively
the while. </p>

<p>It is, as I once pointed out to him, an extremely primitive
form of amusement, and I offered to take him out on to the links
to see Charles Hands play golf, which is, I should imagine,
something particularly funny and entertaining. My advance met
with so little response that it has not been repeated.</p>

<p>I am becoming almost reconciled to his stay, the more so since
he is evincing of late a desire to be on good terms with myself,
and has thrown out one or two tentative smiles in my direction,
which have been remarkably gratifying.</p>

<p>After all, it is much more pleasant to be on good terms with
one's relatives&mdash;and especially relatives from whom one has
great expectations&mdash;than to hear them constantly grumbling
and finding fault. </p>

<p><br>
I SUPPOSE he will stay the year now. I must confess he
improves on acquaintance, and for some remarkable reason he is
tremendously popular with the womenfolk of the house. He has
dropped a good many of his mannerisms: that affected you-have-the-advantage-of-me stare of his has given place to a more human
and more kindly expression. Then, again, he is much more
tractable, and will listen without interrupting.</p>

<p>"If I may be permitted to say so," I said to him the other
day, "you're improving, George."</p>

<p>George accepted the familiarity with a suggestion of his old
hauteur, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Of course, I couldn't very well be rude to a chap who was
practically my guest&mdash;even though he was a relation,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>I looked around to find George going through his daily
gymnastic course. He had not asked me whether I objected&mdash;I
do not know anybody more off-handed than George&mdash;but had
started off on Exercise I.</p>

<p>Exercise I.&mdash;Lie flat on the back, raise both arms and
twirl them in eccentric circles, at the same time shooting out
the legs as though swimming.</p>

<p><br>
GEORGE has decided to stay the year&mdash;in fact, the year is
more than up, and he has arranged to have the room next to mine.
This would have been, impossible a year ago owing to the late
hours he kept and to his extraordinary leaning to rowdiness. Now,
however, thanks to the country air, early hours, and the good
clean moral atmosphere of my home, he has become almost a
reformed character. We have long conversations, rather one-sided,
since George is only just picking up the English language. In his
own tongue he is remarkably fluent, and makes himself understood
to everybody except me. He has got a remarkably sweet smile, and
when I see that smile I look around to see what he has broken
&mdash;for he is still very eccentric. </p>

<p>He is of a literary turn of mind, and simply devours the
newspapers if he can get hold of them. He is shrewd, too, with
just that touch of low cunning that marks the successful
financier.</p>

<p>The other day he pulled my watch from my pocket, and bit it to
see if it was good. Of course, it was quite an unconventional way
of testing a timepiece, and several jewellers to whom I related
the instance say that they have never heard of such a method
being employed, but, after all, one bites sovereigns.</p>

<p>He is annoyed less frequently than he used to be; he does not
raise his voice so often, and sometimes when he is detected going
back to his former evil practices he gives an embarrassed laugh
which indicates very clearly that he is by no means proud of his
uproarious past.</p>

<p><br>
I HAVE asked George to stay on and make his home
with me. We have agreed to let bygones be bygones, and to say
nothing of his somewhat cavalier treatment of the master of the
house. After all, we all have our failings, and although George
has not shod all his weaknesses&mdash;yet he is becoming more
sociable, and is not above taking a word of advice from his well-wishers. I for one have got so used to meeting him, so used to
his peculiar ways, that I should miss him if he left us&mdash;so
I am content to go on sitting by his cot, whistling absurd music-hall tunes and watching with a certain pleasure his frantic
attempts to stand "all alone."</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1906-03-13"></a>THE PEACEMAKERS</h2>

<h3>CONFERENCE AT ALGECIRAS</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Daily Mail</i>, London, 13 March 1906</h3>

<p class="first">BEFORE the door of a frowsy café that opens on
to the Plaza&mdash;that plaza that has seen no change for a
hundred years&mdash;I sit in the sunshine and drink coffee.</p>

<p>Partly because coffee is a more natural drink for a Britisher
than Amontillado&mdash;at ten in the morning.</p>

<p>To-day is Conference day. If you did not know this, the
shoeblack who haunts the café would tell you, and the polite
porter of the Algeciras Club would give confirmation.</p>

<p>Cobble-paved streets rattle as the first carriage passes
unevenly. A grave old man with a snowy flowing board and black-rimmed glasses is talking earnestly to his vis-à-vis. Probably
they are discussing the weather or the latest accident to the
Russian Minister's dog. At the street corner half-a-dozen French
journalists raise their hats politely, and . the old gentleman as
politely acknowledges:</p>

<h3>THE DIPLOMATS PASS BY</h3>

<p class="first">HERE comes carriage number two. Filled with
white-robed Moors, who do not talk to one another, but take stock
of the houses, the people, and the -life of the street.</p>

<p>Then following on come carriages three and four. In the first
of these sits a man by himself. A dapper, good-natured, keen-eyed
gentleman with curly hair and that indescribable suggestion of
tolerant surprise that distinguishes the Englishman whether he be
diplomat or tourist. Sir Arthur Nicolson goes to the Conference
unsupported by any technical adviser&mdash;he knows all that is
to be known about Morocco. Then the Americans. White, grey-haired
and soldierly; Gummere, a strong, simple man hiding his kindly
nature behind a cynical smile.</p>

<p>And so they come, diplomat after diplomat, and the wheels of
their hired carriages beat an endless tattoo.</p>

<p>For some we have a respectful bow&mdash;even the Englishman
who never lifts his hat short of the National Anthem will give
the most ornate of flourishes to the two Frenchmen as they pass.
One is sad with the sadness of over-much learning&mdash;that is
Reveil: the other looks like a happy father, and is ever ready to
smile&mdash;that is Regnault.</p>

<p>Of some as they pass we exchange a flippant word. Such and
such is a hopeless muddler, such and such does not care a snap of
his fingers whether the Conference succeeds or fails, so long as
he can get back to the capital he graces so well. This man is
without finesse: that without discretion; and it is whispered
that that one&mdash;no, not the man on the right, but the
other&mdash;you will see him as the carriage turns the
corner&mdash;is altogether too impossible for words.</p>

<p>So you perceive as I perceive sitting here in the sun and
sipping coffee, that the Conference is a very human assembly, by
no means to be regarded with awe. A number of people you could
pat on the back and call "old chap" without inviting the
thunderbolts of heaven.</p>

<p>Let them pass. In an hour they will be back with their
<i>portefeuilles</i> tucked under their arms. They will go back
to lunch at the Reina Cristina, and we shall see them sitting at
little round tables&mdash;each nation at its own table, each
table solemnly flying a tiny national ensign.</p>

<h3>FROM THE SENTIMENTAL SIDE</h3>

<p class="first">AND sitting here in the sun, with an importunate
but unavailing beggar whining monotonously at my elbow, I wonder
what Jean Prideaux, the tinsmith at Bayonne, is doing just now,
and Pierre Riaut, who makes shoes in, Arreau, in the valley of
the Pyrenees, and young René Imatz, of Bigorre, and that good
Jules Pourtet. who is carpenter, tailor, and wheelwright in
Argelès. René was to have been married in March; Pierre is doing
rather well, and is contemplating a change to Bordeaux.</p>

<p>I think of these as the pleasant old gentlemen rumble past; I
am still thinking of them as Tattenbach, hard-faced, Bismarckian
of head, and, to my sentimental eyes, remorseless, goes on his
way; and suddenly there comes an uneasiness to my mind that
almost amounts to terror. Do our well-dressed, well-fed friends
give a thought to Pierre and Jules and René?</p>

<p>It would be terrible to believe that they do not. For the
first time I wish they were less human and possessed of
omniscient qualities and preternatural reason.</p>

<p>For suppose the Conference fails?</p>

<p>Suppose those noble gentlemen decide that there is no
possibility of reconciling those two nations&mdash;what then?</p>

<p>They will&mdash;our friends of the Conference&mdash;go back to
their homes with something like a sigh of relief. They will
scatter across Europe like schoolboys released from irksome
tasks. Back they go to their little embassies, their little
villas, to their clubs and departments and
chancelleries&mdash;and Algeciras will go back to its sloth and
its dirt and its dullness.</p>

<p><i>Et après?</i></p>

<h3>WAR AMONG THE ROSES</h3>

<p class="first">PERHAPS a war&mdash;only perhaps; but still,
perhaps. Not a war, my military friends, in a country specially
created by God for war.</p>

<p>Not a war in n waste, with league-long hills to hold and
dongas to hide in, and fronts a mile apart.</p>

<p>But war in a civilised country. War in little village
streets, war that means blue smoke curling over trim flower
gardens, and dead men lying limply among crushed roses.</p>

<p>War that will call Pierre from his last, and Jean Prideaux
from his shop, and young René from poor little Suzanne, and will
hurry, them, and thousands such as them, to a quick death and a
hastily-dug trench of a grave.</p>

<p>War in a country through which you have motored, dead men at
the inn whereat you drank, and the wreckage of war strewn about
those same white roads on which the car ran so smoothly.....</p>

<p>They are coming back now, those ambassadors, smiling and
talking, and bowing to you and me....</p>

<p>The Conference is adjourned for four days.... The President
must go to Madrid on Saturday to meet the King of Portugal.... An
attaché has just told me that he will be glad when the rotten
thing is over....</p>

<p>But I think&mdash;I must break off here, for a man has come
down to tell me the latest funny story about the Russian
minister's dog.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1906-06-16"></a>THE NEW SPAIN&mdash;THE KING WHO SMILES</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Star</i>, New Zealand, 16 June 1906</h3>

<br>

<p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Madrid</span>, March 29, 1906</p>

<p class="first">THERE is in Spain a tall, slim, sallow youth
with a perpetual smile. It is the frank smile of undisguised
delight at the joy of living and finding things out. For him life
is a birthday, with thousands of presents still unopened. His
smile&mdash;were I less respectful I might call it a delighted
grin, for such it is in very truth&mdash;is for the joy of
discovery.</p>

<h3>ALFONSO'S SALUTE</h3>

<p class="first">I SAW him standing up in his carriage once at
Burgos, responding to the hoarse "vivas" of the country folk. He
might have saluted gravely, taken his seat solemnly, and driven
away in the pomp and circumstance of his rank&mdash;that would
have been kingly. But he kept to his feet with that amused smile
which is chuckle suppressed, and waved his hand cheerily. He
waved it to the ladies crowding the balconies, to the children
perilously perched on unsuitable elevations, to the swart-faced
peasants wrapped in their shawls.</p>

<p>And the love of his people, the people who had watched the
fatherless boy grow towards manhood, was his first discovery.
Then he discovered other good things, riding and the joy of the
hunt, and the delight of travel; and he went on smiling.</p>

<p>Then he discovered that, given the nerve, a man might drive a
car over a straight road at 100 kilometres an hour and that was
nearly the greatest discovery of all. Coincidentally with this,
the Spanish people, who did not share his enthusiasm for rounding
dangerous corners at full speed, remarked mildly, but with that
mordant humour which is characteristic of the race, that there
was no heir to the throne.</p>

<p>They say of Alfonso XIII. that he was the best-ruled child in
the world, and if this be so, to-day he vindicates the Latin
proverb, which may be found in the appendices of most oheap
dictionaries, and which is to the effect that the best-ruled is
the best ruler. So that when it came to choosing a wife, and when
before him were arrayed the dozen or so of uninteresting but
eligible princesses of royal blood, Alfonso, who, as an amateur
photographer, realises the fallibility of re-touched photographs,
started forth on a tour of inspection.</p>

<h3>THE SWEETEST OR ALL</h3>

<p class="first">THE eligibles of Europe were mostly concentrated
in Berlin, but the young man&mdash;we may suppose that he carried
it off with that smile of his&mdash;was politely indefinite, and
went outside the list, and chose a lady of England, who had
certainly never been included.</p>

<p>Therefore the King has made yet another discovery, and that is
the sweetest of all.</p>

<p>All Royal matches are love matches. It is part of our eternal
hypocrisy to hail them as such, but here is a match which comes
to the hardened cynic as rain following a drought. Here is a real
love match, an infatuation that is eminently boyish in its
intensity, an eager love-making that would satisfy the most
exacting of sentimentalists&mdash;notice the King's smile in the
photographs&mdash;and a match-making so much at first hand that,
if the truth be told, it almost estranged the boy King from his
mother.</p>

<p>Spain is the home of Catholic majestv. In these days of
agnosticism the wave of free thought has passed over Spain and
left it untouched; indeed, if anything, it has closed the ranks
of Roman Catholicism against the heretical intruder.</p>

<p>The news of the match was received with genuine enthusiasm by
the people of Spain. One hears of little else throughout the
country; one sees their portraits exhibited in every other shop.
Ena of Battenberg entered the hearts of the common people, of the
bourgeois, and of the thinking classes&mdash;and I say this
without gush and without cant.</p>

<p>If the truth be pursued, the match found no favour in the
ultra-Catholic circle of the Court. Queen Maria Cristina had
hoped that the choice would have fallen upon a princess of
Austria of her faith; and the great officers of State, who have
for years stood next to the throne and who through the King have
ruled Spain, were at one in that opinion.</p>

<p>"A Catholic by birth, the urged, and though they were in the
minority yet they formed the minority that rules and has governed
Spain for years.</p>

<p>We may, without stretching our imagination, imagine the King
smiling this opposition. For this King from the first has had his
way in things that count.</p>

<h3>ALFONSO AND VELASQUEZ</h3>

<p class="first">THEY tell a story about him, a story of a small
boy standing before the portrait of Philip IV., by Velasquez, in
the gallery here. He looked long and earnestly at the picture.
Then...</p>

<p>"I also will have a chin like that, he said, and set himself
to work from dav to day, despite many smacking, to pinch and
mould his face to the shape of his ancestor's.</p>

<p>That it was an ugly chin does not matter&mdash;it was the chin
of Philip, and to-day when I saw the picture by Velasquez I was
almost startled by the remarkable likeness between the two
monarchs.</p>

<p>So that having altered the face to suit his pleasure&mdash;I
can see him smiling as he did it&mdash;it was not to be expected
that he should alter his life to please others. If this sounds
inconsequential it is because I am dealing with a boy whose life
is made up of inconsequences.</p>

<p>The weightiest opinions were gossamer before this smiling
youth, who could not spare one eye for logic when both were for
love. He wore down opposition gradually but surely, and todav
finds Spain enthusiastic and the Spanish Court more than
tolerant. A few days ago I went from Algeciras to Cadiz to see
him leave for the Canaries. It was his last bachelor holidy, and
all Cadiz was there to wish him "Godspeed." As the launch went
throbbing from the shore he stood in the stern, waving his hand
and smiling as though a trip to the Canaries were really the joke
of all jokes.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1906-07-03"></a>IN SEARCH OF A REVOLUTION</h2>

<h3>A DAY IN LISBON</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Colac Herald</i>, Victoria, 31 August 1906</h3>

<p class="first">MR. EDGAR WALLACE writes in the London <i>Daily Mail</i> of 3rd July:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="first">SENHOR Dom Finto de Silva Et Cetera (you will forgive me if I have forgotten the trailing skirt of ancestral nomenclature that adorns your rotund person), I salute you.</p>

<p>You will remember that we called you "Bill" in those far-off days, and, remembering, will the more readily absolve me of intentional rudeness in allowing your title to slip from my memory.</p>

<p>Does your mind go back six years to the day when you and I, clad  in pyjamas, sat in a small boat on the Pungwe River, under a canvas awning, with the thermometer at par, and mosquitoes taking their mid-day meal? We had gone out to shoot hippo, lion, quagga, and giraffe, and our ambitious undertaking ended ignominiously with shooting at empty whisky-bottles. I call to your mind the fact that our total bag was sixty-three mosquitoes (killed) and one war correspondent (severely bitten), but more particularly do I direct your memory to the dinner at the Beira Club that followed. where under the genial influence of Manhattan cocktails, you grew poetical on the subject of Glorious Portugal.</p>


<h3>BEWILDERING ELEVATIONS</h3>

<p class="first">WELL, here I am in Portugal&mdash;yea, in Lisbon, that Lisbon whereon the guide-book gentleman grows positively ecstatic&mdash;so justifying your perfervid periods. Here is the book, listen: "... Magnificent scene... glorious views burst upon the gaze... Bay of Naples... the most wonderful sight..." and so on.</p>

<p>I came upon Lisbon at the end of a long, long, smelly tunnel. I alighted at a station, descended four flights of stairs, and found myself on a level with the street. Being curious, I re-ascended the stairs&mdash;four flights, with the temperature at 80 degrees&mdash;found another exit&mdash;on a level with the street: There was a spiral staircase that led to the roof. "Where does that go to?" I asked an official. "To the street," he replied, and then our conversation came to my mind, and I remembered you had told me that Lisbon, like a beautiful something-or-other. was perched or enthroned, as the case may be, upon seven (say 7) hills.</p>

<p>And Lisbon is all that you claim. It is beautiful, but most beautiful of all when viewed from the sea, or from the broad bosom of the bronze Tagus. This same Tagus flows before my window, a giant of a river, with cockle-boat liners and toy destroyers, and make-believe shipyards, and an old, old hulk of a guardship fitted with fighting tops, and a scarlet torpedo-boat lying at a buoy.</p>

<p>But for me the joy of life in Lisbon has nothing to do with the natural beauty of its surroundings, of its poetry, of white villas that speckle the green hills. For me the ultimate point of pleasurable excitement is reached in moving from one part of Lisbon to another&mdash;the experience is unique, intoxicating incomparable.</p>

<h3>A SPORT THAT IS NOT ADVERTISED</h3>

<p class="first">MOTORING is fine sport; ballooning provides a sensation unlike any other; a tramway-car ride through Lisbon is an extraordinary experience which combines the joys of both. You quoted to me <i>"Quem não tem visto Lisboa, não tem visto coisa boa,"</i> which I understand is the Portuguese variant for, "See Naples and die," but it shall be my proud boast that I have spent thousands of <i>reis</i> on car journeys in Lisbon, and that I still live to tell the tale. I have dived down, down, down declivities with a gradient of one in six; I have gone up precipitous streets where the car was a buzzing insect climbing a wall; I have swooped down goat-paths at forty miles an hour; I have tasted that sensation of joyous peril which has hitherto been reserved for Alpine climbers and bill-posters, and all for a penny a mile. Lisbon is one huge switchback (get to the door in case the blessed thing breaks down), and as such is the most delightful capital in the world.</p>

<p>And the pity is that you find this out by accident. Not one guide-book tells you of Lisbon's chief attraction. For myself, I was seeking the Pantheon, where you may see a king in his  coffin,  when I made the discovery. I boarded a car and gave the conductor  s pennY. The nonchalant gentleman controlling the electricity on the front platform stopped a moment to light a cigarette, then gave his handle a shake. The car jumped twenty feet into a bottomless pit. While I was wondering what was Portuguese for  "Save the women and children first" we pulled up in the bowels of the earth, and a priest with a bowler hat came on board. Then we climbed up the side of a house, went across some roofs, encircled a church spire, dropped seven stories into another hole, ran under a house, up a cliff, over more roofs, down into the basement again&mdash;then the conductor came and, assisted by the rest of the passengers, explained to me that I had had my pennyworth.</p>

<h3>FROM LISBON'S WINDOW-SILLS</h3>

<p class="first">WHILE I was agreeing with him and making my way to the exit the car started for another hill-climbing competition, and I found myself deposited on a ledge&mdash;a broad ledge on which fountains played and green palms grew and unshaven attendants sold lemonade. It was one of Lisbon!s window-sills, and beneath was a panorama which has no equal in the world. Lisbon is believed to be built on seven hills. I say "believed" because I personally have counted sixty-three, and from the summit of each you may look upon the; others. Picture these hills in the full light of an afternoon sun. Great green mounds sprinkled with dolls' houses, houses red and yellow, and white and pink, and ochre; over all, on the crest of the highest hill a battered grey fort, gaunt, ugly, domineering.</p>

<p>But it is not for sensations, for the joy of the eye, or the refrigerating thrill of car rides that I have come to Lisbon, and you, my dear Pinto, would be the last person in the world to guess why I have come. It is to see at first hand a revolution&mdash;no less.</p>

<p>To witness the evolution of a limited monarchy into the newest kind of national system, a Republic based on English principles. You who lived so far away&mdash;if, indeed, you still be alive and have not died of sunstroke or from the fever that rises out of the great swamp land&mdash;you, I say, will not readily understand this sudden passion for British methods. In the days we knew, Lord Salisbury's ultimatum was a rankling memory, and the battle of Massikassi an event not to be referred to. But there have been alliances and things, "communities of interests," treaties and what-not, and we have discovered that King Carlos is a good sportsman, though, if the truth be told, rather given to exaggeration, and Portugal has behaved towards us very handsomely indeed.</p>

<h3>HOAXES, BRITISH AND PORTUGUESE</h3>

<p class="first">BUT, despite the alliance, and the meeting of monarchs, and the banging of cymbals, despite the genuine friendship that exists between Portugal and Great Britain, and the popularity we are enjoying, Portugal has its little internal troubles just as we in England have. We call ours Chinese slavery; you and your countrymen refer to yours as the Republican movement. Ours
is a hoax, and yours is a hoax, and if I had known as much about the genuineness of the Republican movement as I do about yellow slavery, I should not have come here.</p>

<p>But in the capitals of Europe they whisper of the coming trouble in Portugal, of an autocratic Sovereign and a bureaucratic Government, of disloyal sailors and regiments in revolt, of soldiers hurried in the dead of night to noisome dungeons, of a seething, suffering people waiting for a signal, of a condition of things very similar to that described by Mr Carlyle in the first volume of that interesting literary firework which described yet another revolution.</p>

<p>So I have come to Portugal, and here am I in tho thick of the fray, so to speak, and I want to tell you of my search for a revolution, of how I discovered it in a Cow Shed, of the great Smoke Question and the Pipe of Discord, and of the numerous and  diverting incidents that befell me while in Portugal.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1906-07-12"></a>THE NEW SPAIN&mdash;THE MADRID BOMB OUTRAGE</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Poverty Bay Herald</i>, New Zealand, 12 July 1906</h3>

<h3>A BRILLIANT WEDDING&mdash;FROM JOY TO TEARS</h3>

<p class="first">MR. EDGAR WALLACE, in the <i>Daily Mail</i>,
gives a brilliant account of the Royal wedding at Madrid and of
the tragedy that followed. In the course of the report he
says:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="first">A DISTANT burst of cheering and the blare of
bugles announced at half-past 9 that the Royal procession had
started. Prince after prince with fitting escort passed, and then
came princes and princesses of the blood royal of Spain, with all
the attentions due to their rank and exact order of precedence.
Recognised instantly by the people and cheered rapturously was
the Infanta Isabel, a motherly lady with silver hair, who was
weeping as she passed.</p>

<p>But the greatest reception, apart to that accorded to the
principals, was reserved for the Prince and Princess of Wales.
The difficulty of distinguishing personages in the Royal carriage
was overcome by the fact that the Prince's photograph had been
published in all the papers.</p>

<p>When the British National Anthem sounded in the distance the
enthusiasm of the crowd was unbounded, and the approach of their
Royal Highnesses' coach was the occasion for a singularly warm
demonstration. Both the Prince and Princess bowed, smiled, and
saluted the cheering people with that wave of the hand which is
characteristically Spanish, and the use of which pleases the
Spaniard more than the most stately bows.</p>

<p>A quaint feature of the Prince's retinue was the "coach of
respect," an empty State coach following behind with exactly the
same escort as that occupied by the Prince. The Princess was
dressed in white.</p>

<p>The procession seemed unending, and there were frequent stops,
but at last appeared the plume-crested heads of the eight white
horses drawing the Royal carriage. King Alfonso's welcome was
unique. They "vivaed," they called him by name, and they showed
in a dozen ways their affection for him. With him were Don Carlos
and a pretty little boy of four, the Infante Alfonso, the King's
cousin and heir. The child was a feature of the
procession&mdash;he was so obviously enjoying the ride and
saluted so gravely.</p>

<h3>PRINCESS ENA'S OVATION</h3>

<p class="first">BUT whatever had been the acclamations that
greeted King Alfonso, the ovation of the day was reserved for
Princess Ena. For her Madrid displayed its most beautiful
decorations; for her they hung from countless windows tapestries
of enormous value (an authority pointed out to me a house from
the windows of which were hung fabrics of the value of
&pound;40,000); in her honor family ohests were ransacked and
treasures which had not seen the light for 100 years, and which
are practically priceless, were hung side by side with more
modern specimens of the decorator's art.</p>

<p>All brides look beautiful, but Princess Ena looked divine, and
it is no exaggeration to say that Madrid went mad with enthusiasm
as she passed, half an hour after the King, through the
streets.</p>

<p>For the last time she listened to "God Save the King" played
in her honor. Her progress was a triumph over the Spain that
loves beauty and courtships, and the youths paid her homage such
as few women are fated to receive. The people pressed forward
with outstretched hands, and only a strong force of military
prevented them from reaching the carriage.</p>

<p>Here was a color feast such as Paul Veronese alone could have
done justice to&mdash;a scene beside which the most magnificent
efforts of pageant-makers were insignificant. The tiny Gothic
church is perched on a slight eminence, its wonderful proportions
alone preventing it from appearing mean. It stood, a splash of
cinnamon, with delicate finials rising to the blue Spanish
sky.</p>

<p>As Princess Ena's carriage turned into the broad drive that
leads past the church, to the frenzied, shrill cries of the
people, to the waving of thousands of handkerchiefs, to the soft
tones of Spanish music, one was transported back to the day of
barbaric gorgeousness when kings moved through a golden haze.</p>

<p>Everything helped the illusion. There had been passing up the
sweep of grey granite steps that lead to the silvered portals a
procession of grandees&mdash;not in their military uniforms, as
would be the case in other countries, but in the garb of their
religious orders&mdash;not as soldiers, but as "brothers of
Christ." In their spotless white cloaks, emblazoned with the
ensignia of their order, with their mediaeval plumed hats, they
were part of the great and wonderful picture.</p>

<p>Now, as Princess Ena's golden coach stopped before the steps,
the picture was complete. For at the head of the stairs under the
great sweep of the canopy&mdash;a huge patch of crimson and
gold&mdash;stood a glittering throng waiting to receive her. Left
and right of the entrance, supported by slender silver halberds,
were the canopies over the Ambassadors, and from the terrace of
the church hung priceless tapestries.</p>

<h3>IN THE CHURCH</h3>

<p class="first">AT the church door an official helped the bride
to alight, and then, slightly ahead of the two mothers, she
walked up with a light step, standing out from the colored
splendor of her surroundings.</p>

<p>The King, who wore the plain uniform of a captain-general with
the Orders of the Garter and Golden Fleece, awaited her arrival
at the end of the dim aisle, which was almost dark after the
glare of the sunshine, despite the subdued light of the
chandeliers and the lights on the beautiful altar.</p>

<p>In almost every detail the service was identical with every
Catholic marriage service, but it was sufficiently trying for the
young pair, as the crowded church was suffocatingly hot. The
Archbishop of Toledo, crozier in hand, advanced and performed the
simple service:</p>

<p>"Señora Princesa Victoria Eugenia de Battenberg, I require
Your Highness and Your Majesty Señor Don Alfonso XIII., King of
Spain and Castile, to affirm if there be any impediment by which
this marriage cannot be contracted."</p>

<p>The Princess made the responses in Spanish, speaking
distinctly and making the three affirmutions required in a clear
voice. Then in a voice rendered almost indistinct by emotion the
Archbishop said, "And I, on behalf of God Almighty and the
blessed Apostles, Peter, Paul, and of Holy Mother Church, marry
you, illustrious Princess, and you, most exalted King. This
sacrament of matrimony I confirm in the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."</p>

<p>It was a quarter to one when the booming of cannon announced
the mass that followed the wedding ceremony was finished.</p>

<h3>AFTER THE CEREMONY</h3>

<p class="first">OUT from the dark church into the glaring
sunshine the Royal couple passed. The young Queen looked pale,
but smiled and waved her hand to the people. The King himself
looked a little fatigued, but there was happiness in his smile,
and he looked eagerly into his Queen's face and pressed her arm
in frank delight. As they stood together under the noble canopy,
a young couple side by side waving hands here and there, as they
recognised friends among the privileged circle, there was
something in the scene unlike anything one has witnessed. Without
losing a particle of the dignity of a splendid function it took
on a character of happiness so evident, so undisguised, as to be
almost plebeian. Even Spanish dignity melted in joy at seeing the
two whose lovemaking has been the talk of Spain brought
together.</p>

<p>The scene that followed as they moved off was remarkable, and
the return journey to the palace was marked by demonstrations of
affection unequalled in the history of Spain. From the packed
stands, windows, and balconies, and from the roof-tops, rose one
long, continued roll of cheering. One cry shouted by a spectator,
and caught up by the crowd, I shall always hear. It was,
"Beautiful, beautiful!" Even the guarding soldiers lining the
route caught the enthusiasm, and raised their swords in irregular
salute with the same cry of "Bonito!"</p>

<h3>THE BOMB THROWN</h3>

<p class="first">A DASTARDLY attempt to assassinate King Alfonso
and Queen Victoria was made in the Calle Mayor at twenty minutes
past two, as the royal couple were returning from the church to
the palace after the wedding.</p>

<p>I had just left the street, after seeing the royal carriage
pass. Queen Victoria was leaning forward, radiantly happy, and
waving her hand to the cheering people. King Alfonso was leaning
back, lazily waving his hand, but not taking his eyes from his
wife's face.</p>

<p>I was writing the last words of a despatch when from a distant
street came what sounded like a solitary explosion.</p>

<p>Some ten minutes later a courier came galloping past and
brought the terrible news, that a diabolical attempt had been
made on the lives of the King and Queen.</p>

<p>The royal procession had passed through the Calle Alcala,
where the crowd pressed densely, had crossed the Puerto del Sol,
and had entered the Calle Mayor. This street runs almost to the
threshold of the palace. It is one of the most beautifully
decorated thoroughfares, its narrowness allowing it to be spanned
with garlands and suspended arches. At the palace end the street
slopes steeply, and opposite the Civil Governor's house grows yet
narrower.</p>

<p>The assassin had posted himself on a balcony overlooking the
road and facing the Governor's house. As the royal pair passed he
hurled a bomb.</p>

<p>By God's providence he missed his mark. Had the weapon fallen
a foot further nothing could have prevented the transformation of
the most famous wedding of modern days into a dreadful
tragedy.</p>

<p>As it was the bomb exploded, killing a number of spectators
and wounding others. At the moment of telegraphing the excitement
is so intense that it is impossible to obtain accurate
particulars. But I am credibly informed that eight persons were
killed and twenty-five injured.</p>

<p>The whole royal procession was panic-stricken, but King
Alfonso, recovering himself immediately, spoke through the broken
windows of the royal carriage and inquired what damage had been
done. Immediately he sent an orderly to reassure Princess Henry
of Battenberg and the Queen-Mother.</p>

<p>His Majesty, raising his voice, commanded the procession to
resume its course. Queen Victoria was deathly pale, but smiled
courageously.</p>

<p>At that moment all the King's thoughts were evidently for her.
He patted her arm and spoke to her continuously all the way to
the palace.</p>

<p>A rumor had already reached the palace that the King was
killed, and utter consternation prevailed until the royal
carriage came into view. Then arose an hysterical shout of
joy.</p>

<p>A few minutes later King Alfonso and Queen Victoria appeared
hand in hand on the palace balcony, smiling and bowing in answer
to the frantic cheering of their subjects.</p>

<h3>THE KING AND HIS BRIDE IN TEARS</h3>

<p class="first">THE missile fell to the right of the royal
carriage, between the hindmost pair of horses and the front pair
of wheels. The explosion killed two horses and a groom.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Sotomayor, the equerry who was riding at the
right side of the carriage, was slightly wounded. Four soldiers
lining the route were killed on the spot, and a lieutenant who
was standing at the salute was fatally injured.</p>

<p>A police-bugler had his head severed from his body, and two
women among the spectators were also killed. The injured were
very numerous, and included two or three persons on the second-storey balcony of the house from which the bomb was thrown.
Immediately after the explosion the Duke of Cornachuelos rushed
forward, opened the carriage door, and taking hold of the King
dragged him out of the vehicle, and then the Queen, who showed
signs of great emotion. On their arrival at the palace it was
noticed that both the King and his bride were in tears.</p>

<h3>THE ASSASSIN'S ESCAPE</h3>

<p class="first">THE assassin, whose name is Mateo Moral, escaped
in the confusion, but left evidence of being wounded.</p>

<p>Immediately before the outrage the Queen had remarked to the
King that she would be glad to reach home, the explosion
following on her words. The bleeding and wounded officers threw
themselves round the royal carriage, and the Queen, alighting,
gazed with horror on the dead and dying men and officers.</p>

<p>One officer lay dead, with his hand raised to the salute. The
Queen was composed, but on reaching the palace broke down
completely.</p>

<p>As she alighted gentlemen pressed forward, but the King waved
them back and tenderly supported his weeping wife.</p>

<p>The bomb was thrown concealed in a bunch of flowers. A panic
ensued among the occupants of the stands, who threw themselves to
the ground. The postillion of the Municipal Guard and a Moorish
officer were killed instantly.</p>

<p>Bodies, horribly mutilated, lay along the street. Men removed
their hats before the dead, and there followed a solemn scene. A
priest from a neighboring church arrived to give the last
sacraments to the wounded and his blessing to the dead. King
Alfonso stood up when the explosion occurred, and cried to the
people, "Don't be afraid; we are not hurt."</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1906-08-11"></a>THE NEW SPAIN&mdash;SOME STORIES OF KING ALFONSO</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Star</i>, New Zealand, 11 August
1906</h3>

<p class="first">THERE came to meet me at the North Station at
Madrid a cheerful boy&mdash;a boy who had obviously come straight
from a tennis court, who was dressed "slack" as only the English
can dress "slack" and remain respectable. In the carriage that
drove us through the uneven streets of Madrid he told me about a
"rotter" of our acquaintance, used twelve different school-slang
phrases in as many minutes.</p>

<p>That night he came to the Fornos to dinner, and I asked him
why his friends called him by a Spanish name.</p>

<p>"Because I am Spanish," was the reply, and the answer
staggered me.</p>

<p>"But you are unique?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. Dozens of fellows in Madrid like myself have
been educated in England."</p>

<p>And this boy, I discovered, was the son of a noble house that
goes back to the year 1, and that he was by no means alone in his
Anglicisation I soon discovered.</p>

<p>The royal marriage and the enthusiasm it has aroused through
Spain are only symptomatic of the extraordinary respect in which
Great Britain is held throughout Spain. The word "Inglesi" has a
meaning outside the narrow limits of appellation, and the young
Spain that is growing up with the boy-King has possibilities
which the boldest may speculate upon and fall short of the
mark.</p>

<h3>A LITTLE MAD</h3>

<p class="first">REMEMBER that old Spain does not quite
understand Alfonso. It loves him; he is the darling of the
people, and your ultra-Republicans, exceedingly voluble on all
pertaining to kingship, have a pleasant word for the slim youth
with the everlasting smile.</p>

<p>But none the less old Spain does not quite take him in. To be
perfectly frank, old Spain, watching in wonderment as the young
man sweeps away the cobwebs that hamper his administration,
confesses sadly that the King is a little mad. This same old
Spain, be it noted, has for generations regarded the "Inglesi" as
a nation of amiable lunatics, and for very much the same reason
as England has deserved the stigma, King Alfonso bears it.</p>

<p>People who know Spain from books will tell you with bated
breath of the cast-iron etiquette that surrounds the royal
personagee of Spain, of dreadful dinners eaten in solemn silence,
of bows to the left and curtsies to the right, of mace-bearers
and cup-bearere and sword-bearers, of orders of precedence; such
as that between the Infanta who was born at 7.25 and the Infanta
who entered this wicked world at 7.29.</p>

<p>There have been customs handed down from the days of the
gloomy builder of the Escurial. They have been handed down from
king to king&mdash;even Joseph Bonaparte "carried on"&mdash;and
they were handed over, heirlooms of procedure, to the patient
little boy whose unceasing education earned for him the sympathy
of all the little boys in the world.</p>

<p>Where are those customs now?</p>

<p>If we are to believe the aged masters of ceremonies,
who&mdash;so it is said&mdash;go moaning about the Corridors of
the Palacio Real, weeping for glories gone, they have vanished.
Pruned here and omitted there, remodelled, improved, renovated,
the irreverent youth (he has just streaked past my window in a
motor-car) has, in the language of the soap advertiser, "made
home comfortable."</p>

<h3>THE IRON HAND BENEATH</h3>

<p class="first">AND his influence is felt throughout Spain. Not
because he has led the Spanish gentry to wearing English clothes,
English collars, and English cravats (I saw a "smo-king jakket"
ticketed in the window of a cheap tailor to-day), nor because he
has infused into a languid people something of that restless
energy which is peculiarly his, but because you see his hand in
the great acts of administration.</p>

<p>There was a Minister in Spain who had a friend. The friend's
past was not exactly blameless: there was a sort, of "war stores
scandal" in the background, but the Minister was anxious to put
his friend into the Cabinet. And the Minister, who was
sufficiently powerful to he blind to his own weakness had not the
slightest doubt that his nomination would be accepted. It is
unfortunately true that corruption in the public service has been
by no means rare in Spain, and is not regarded in a very serious
light, and the Minister was perhaps justified in his belief that
the unfortunate affair bad been conveniently forgotten.</p>

<p>But the King's memory, like the King's digestion, is
remarkably good, and without a word he struck his pen through his
name. The Minister was thunderstruck.</p>

<p>"I shall place my resignation in your Majesty's hands," he
said stiffly; but the awful threat did not alarm the young
man.</p>

<p>"That is my wish," he said gravely.</p>

<p>Again. The present marriage is by no means regarded with
approval in Germany. You are aware that there are divers great
German Princes whose "military duties" will prevent their
attending the ceremony.</p>

<p>It is an unfortunate fact that one cannot show preference
without offending the unpreferred. The attachment of the King has
drawn him closer to Great Britain; but King Alfonso is a shrewd
youth, and he has certainly no desire to antagonise a powerful
State like Germany. The spirit of "manana," which is at once the
joy and curse of Spain, extends to every class of
Spaniard&mdash;even to the Spaniard ambassadorial&mdash;and there
are to be celebrations this year in Germany at which the crowned
heads of Europe are to be represented. Somehow the Spanish
Ambassador at Berlin failed to notify the King of these
celebrations, with the result that there was no time for the
fitting representation of Spain. Alfonso's hand fell on the
Ambassador. A prompt <i>Gazette</i> announced his recall and the
reason.</p>

<h3>ALL THE TO-MORROWS SHALL BE AS TO-DAY</h3>

<p class="first">THIS is how Alfonso XIII. is creating a new
Spain. By substituting promptitude for procrastination; by
replacing "manana" by "to-day"; by refusing to recognise the plea
of custom; and lastly, and most important of all, by doing
himself the things that he asks his people to do.</p>

<p>The story that best illustrates the sane, practical spirit
that underlies most of his acts is the story of the reservoir
disaster. In the course of constructing a reservoir near Madrid,
part of the works collapsed, and hundreds of workmen were buried
beneath tons of earth. The boy King was at the royal palace when
the news was telephoned through, and he ordered his car and drove
through to the scene of the catastrophe. Crowds had gathered in
the vicinity, and the King was recognised as he drove up.
Accident or royal procession, all's one to the Spaniard, so long
as it be in the nature of sight-seeing, and "<i>Viva el Rey!</i>"
was roared by a thousand throats. It was an indignant young
monarch who stood up in his car and harangued the crowd. "If you
were helping to dig these poor fellows out, instead of shouting
<i>'Viva</i>,' you would be doing a far better thing." he
said&mdash;and the orowd took the hint.</p>

<p>It is customary at such a time as this for the writer to say
the nicest things he can remember about his royal subject. Kings,
with two notable exceptions, are very uninteresting people, who
do a great deal of work and listen patiently to a great number of
national anthems. But one requires very little stimulating to
"enthuse" over the ruler of Spain. Partly because he is the sort
of youth that an ordinary citizen&mdash;were he, too, an ordinary
citizen&mdash;would be very friendly with, and would speak about
behind his back as a very decent fellow indeed, and partly
because he is a monarch, isolated from the contact of common men,
surrounded by what seemed insurmountable walls of etiquette and
tradition, and apparently at the mercy of wire-pullers and
courtiers, and yet has broken through the steel girdle and proved
himself a wise ruler and a very human being.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1906-08-18"></a>THE NEW SPAIN&mdash;THE FASCINATION OF THE BULL-FIGHT</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Star</i>, New Zealand, 18 August 1906</h3>

<p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Madrid</span>, Friday, May 25,
1906</p>

<p>Yesterday I watched Madrid at play. In the great Plaza del
Torres I saw a huge circle of banked faces rising tier on tier,
and heard the hum of fourteen thousand voices, and saw the sun
glitter on thousands of fluttering fans.</p>

<p>There was a stir, and fourteen thousand heads turned toward
the high-perched royal box. A young man in the scarlet coat of
the dragoons entered, raised his hand stiffly to the buzzing
crowd, and took his seat. There was no cheer, no
"<i>Viva</i>"&mdash;the King's German brother-in-law has not
gripped the popular fancy.</p>

<p>An unshaven photographer, operating a blundering camera and a
big cigar at one and the same time, spoke through the unoccupied
corner of his mouth. "Ah! it will be different when the Queen
comes!" And the pathetic thing was that he spoke in tones of
joyful anticipation, as though, in the new Queen Victoria, bull-fighting was to receive a fillip which would establish it for
ever as the premier sport of Europe.</p>

<h3>ALL EYES ON THE ENGLISH QUEEN</h3>

<p class="first">NEXT week the young Queen will preside at her
first fight. She will sit high up in the flower-decked tribune,
the focussing point of thousands of curious eyes, all knowing the
Englishwoman's detestation of such sport, and watching for the
pallor that oomes to the face of even the "nerviest" of untried
spectators. She will see the Spanish bull&mdash;the bravest and
most ferocious of God's creatures&mdash;in all his wild rage; she
will see wretched hacks driven to their death, and lithe, catlike
men with nerves of ice playing with destruction.</p>

<p>And not alone on the day she makes her bow to the clamouring
ring, but day after day at intervals her figure will be seen in
the royal box, her head, draped in a white mantilla, bent to the
plaudits, of the Madrileno, till the play and the horror and the
fascination of bull-fighting will become a matter of habit, and
her heart will no longer beat furious tattoos wheen the trumpet
wails, and a nimble official throws open a thick door of the
bullpen, and there steps into the light, warily, inquiringly, an
animal all aquiver with fierce wrath.</p>

<p>Best for her, since the bull-ring must become part of her
life, if she shuts her eyes to the picador urging forward the
ambling, scraggy brute of a horse he rides, and accepts
philosophically the quick plunge of the bull and the toss of its
head beneath the breast of the horse, and the tumbling picador
sprawling within a yard of the needle-pointed horns. For she may
reflect that this same bony horse, did he not meet swift death in
the sanded arena, might die less comfortably and more
lingeringly&mdash;even of starvation&mdash;in Spain, a country
where horseflesh is lightly regarded, and where the "friend of
man" is an idiom untranslatable.</p>

<p>Best for her, too, if she watches the sight of sights,
concentrating her thoughts, her emotions, and her philosophies
upon the supreme moment of the trial when the matador takes the
sword from his attendant, raises his hand in salute to the
occupants of the tribunal&mdash;quaint survival of the
gladiator's farewell&mdash;throws his cap across the barrier with
that peculiar swing of his that is inimitable, and walks slowly
towards the beast that awaits him in the centre of the arena.</p>

<h3>FIRST IMPRESSIONS REVISED</h3>

<p class="first">TRAVELLERS who visit Spain write lurid
impressions of their first bull-fight. They denounce it as
inhuman, barbaric, and beyond defence. Then they go again to the
bull-ring to see if their first impression was
justified&mdash;and finding that it was, go a third time to make
sure. By the time they have seen their sixth fight they are more
bloodthirsty than the Spaniards, and shout for more horses and
"fire" for the cowardly bull.</p>

<p>I have always enjoyed bull-fighting, because it throws me back
to the days when my ancestors lived in caves and beat one
another's heads off in the settlement of all disputes. If you
love a horse the sight is sickening; if your fondness embraces
all animal life, it is hopelessly cruel; if you are a vegetarian,
it is sacrilegious.</p>

<p>For me, and for thousands of Britishers who know the story of
bull-fighting and have studied its art, and can tell instantly
the blundering kill from the clean, straight stroke of the master
bull-fighling has fascinations which all its horrors cannot
destroy.</p>

<p>And it is the last scene of all that draws you back and back
again to the Plaza.</p>

<p>The bandilleros have played the bull, and the blarct of the
trumpet calls them off. The bull stands trembling with rage in
the circle of the gaily-coloured fighters. Then from the barrier,
from his salute, comes a slight figure of a man, hatless, in his
left hand a blood-red flag, in his right a thin, red-hilted
sword.</p>

<p>"Machiquito! Machiquito!"</p>

<p>A roar of greeting comes to him from the packed barreras, but
he scarcely acknowledges it.</p>

<h3>FOREDOOMED</h3>

<p class="first">His thin, aesthetic face, the thick black
eyebrows, the firm, delicately-shaped mouth are known from one
end of Spain to the other. Now, the face is tense and white. Not
with fear, for Machiquito does not know it, and some day this
daring little man will end his days in the bull-ring.</p>

<p>He nears the group, and the play of cloaks begins. Flick! The
bull turns as swift as lightning, and springs at the cloak. He
misses by a hand's-breadth, and the flutter of another cloak
sends him spinning in another direction. Now comes the delicate
part of the day's work. Machiquito raises his red flag, and the
bull jumps with a curious sidelong thrust of his head. A warning
yell goes up from ten thousand throats, for the trained observers
have seen that the bull is aiming at the man and not at the flag.
Again the flicking of cloaks and the sharp, mad rushes and the
hand's-breadth escapes. This is not for the fighter's amusement;
it has a purpose. You may not kill a bull by the laws of the ring
except he stand with feet in such a position and head at such a
poise. So back and forward goes Machiquito's flag, till suddenly
the bull stands still, and fighter and victim face each
other.</p>

<p>The silence of death comes on the banked crowds, for the feet
of the bull are in the right position, and the head is at the
angle. Slowly the right hand of the matador rises and the sword
lies level with his eye. In a moment the bull jumps, and
Machiquito springs towards him&mdash;straight forward to what
looks like certain death, so that his breast is between the horns
of the bull, and his glittering coat scrapes the bull's forehead.
There is a flash of steel...</p>

<p>You cannot from a humanitarian point of view defend bull-fights any more than you can prize-fighting or kicking the soul
out of two-year-old horses for the sake of a 6 to 4 starting-price coup. It is brutal, it is often disgusting&mdash;it is, if
you wish, the indication of national decadence&mdash;but it is
the greatest "thrill" in the world.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1906-09-15"></a>SEEKING A REVOLUTION: THE MISSING ELEMENTS</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Daily News</i>, Perth, West Australia, 15 September 1906</h3>

<p class="cp">(By Edgar Wallace, in the London <i>Daily Mail</i>)</p>

<p class="first">THERE came to my bedside this morning a gaunt-faced waiter. He brought me a cup of coffee and a Portuguese newspaper. I cannot read Portuguese very well, but the trumpeting headline that ran across the page was easily translatable:&mdash;</p>

<p class="headline">HURRAH FOR THE FENIANS!</p>

<p><br>
TEN minutes later I was in the street, driving as fast as two self-conscious horses of uncertain age could draw me to the house of a friend. My breathless message brought him from his bath, and I placed the paper in his damp hands.</p>

<p>"What about the revolution now?" I demanded. He read the article aloud. He read it in Portuguese, and Portuguese sounds like Spanish spoken with a German accent. Then he explained&mdash;:</p>

<p>"My dear man, this all about a harmless club that is making an excursion from Oporto to Lisbon in order to participate in one of our festivals."</p>

<p>"But Fenians?"</p>

<p>"Lord! You mustn't take notice of what these chaps call themselves!"</p>

<p>And you must know that what he said was true.</p>

<p>This delightful land is a land of make-believe. It is a land where people say a great deal more than they mean; where language is given to encourage thought.</p>

<p>And it is a country, too, of poetic exaggeration.</p>

<p>"My house and all that I have is at your disposition," says the acquaintance of an hour, and the stranger, unused to such generosity, gasps at the magnificence of Portuguese hospitality. But, bless you, all that the Portuguese gentleman meant was, "If  you happen to be passing my house, I hope you will pass!"</p>

<p>And the secret of this extravagance of speech and the simple explanation of it all is this: The Portuguese are a nation of lovers. They spend their lives in what Froissart calls "the admiration and service of dames." They call themselves idealists&mdash;but that is only part of their extravagance. They lisp compliments from babyhood, they traffic in superlatives from their youth up; they live for love, and side by side with the impassioned sonnets that fill their newspapers are the indescribable advertisements of quack nostrums.</p>

<p>So remember always that between the dreadful threat and the creamy compliment there lies a balancing point; <i>quieta non  movere</i>. </p>

<p>There was a Portugal once that neither threatened nor promised&mdash;but acted swiftly, remorselessly, unswervingly.</p>

<p>Do you remember the story of Inez Castro&mdash;the fair Spaniard who secretly married a Portuguese Prince?</p>

<p>The nobles put Inez to death when her husband was away, because they feared her influence. But Pedro returned and carried fire and sword through the land, ravaged and ravished and tortured and slew like a wild fury. And a dead Queen, hastily exhumed, sat propped on a throne, and a chastened nobility did homage to the Thing that sat an the robes of Majesty. Inez was the tobacco question of her day&mdash;and was summarily settled. So was the revolution that followed; but the elements that were present in the year of grace 1355, and made a revolution possible, are no longer existent in Portugal.</p>

<p>I tell this story because my search for a revolution took me outside of Lisbon a few days ago, and I was reminded at Coimbra of the tragedy of at least one revolution that failed. For the town having proved unprofitable, I sought symptoms of the upheaval of Portugal in the country. </p>

<p>The peasants of the Tyrol stand on one leg and yodel, the peasants of Italy sell ice-cream in Fleet-street, the peasants of Russia groan under an oppressive Autocracy&mdash;this much I gather from popular literature devoted to these subjects. Here in rural Portugal the lower classes, who work for their living by raising vegetables for the upper classes, affect ridiculous bushy side-whiskers and find relaxation in tame bull-fights&mdash;for the Portuguese bull-fight is sadly unsanguinary.</p>

<p>Did I tell you that I went to the ring&mdash;that same ring where a month ago the naughty Republicans hissed the Queen&mdash;and witnessed the practice of the national sport? When it was all over an attendant woks me up and asked me if I would not like to go home bow, and I thought I would. </p>

<p>Later in the day I met an American tourist lady who wore the badge of the Philadelphia League of Animal Worshippers, and she enlarged on the decadent tastes of the Portuguese.</p>

<p>"Say, now, don't you think that Portuguese bull-fighting is real wicked?"</p>

<p>"I think it is dreadful," I replied, but I did not mean what she meant. A bull-fight in Portugal Is almost as exciting as Patience, but not quite so thrilling as "Ping-pong." But the people enjoyed it. They rose to a man, and cheered when things nearly happened, and in the end, when the bull, alive and well, was led from the arena by tame cows, especially trained for the service, their enthusiasm was boundless.</p>

<p>If out of pure contrariness, and to prove that I am no prophet, a revolution is started in Portugal; if, by reason of insubordination in the army and acts of mutiny in the navy, the stability of the throne is threatened, I shall be comforted by the remembrance of that bull-fight and confidently wait to see, at the worst, the padded flanks of monarchy prodded by the ball-pointed horns of Republicanism.</p>

<p>"And yet," mused my patient friend the journalist, "the greatest revolutionaries of all are we Portuguese and Spanish Latins. Look at South America! A hundred revolutions a minute. What was possible in Mexico and is possible in every South American republic, must be possible here. We have the same material, the same&mdash;&mdash;"  He shook his head despairingly. It was the nearest he had ever got to admitting the decadence of Portuguese character.

<h2><a id="Art-1907-02-08"></a>WITH MILITARY HONOURS</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Star</i>, New Zealand, 9 February 1907</h3>

<p class="first">"PRESENT arms!"</p>

<p>With a rattle the rifles came down together to the salute, and
Boy Smith blew a flourish on his bugle.</p>

<p>Not very good order was kept, for the ground was naturally
uneven and slippery with new-dug clay.</p>

<p>"Shoulder arms!"</p>

<p>The junior lieutenant pulled his moustache nervously with a
white gloved hand and consulted the sergeant, for this was the
first job of its kind that he had ever been engaged in.</p>

<p>"What do we do now, sergeant?"</p>

<p>"March off, sir."</p>

<p>The subaltern nodded.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of this beastly place, for Heaven's sake; I'm
caked with clay from head to foot."</p>

<p>He adjusted his brass helmet chain and ran his fingers over
his buttons. A whispered suggestion from the sergeant, a falsetto
order from the officer, and the party straggled off, regaining
some kind of formation on the gravellbd roadway that led to the
gate of the cemetery. Clear of the gate, the band crashed into a
lively march, and the firing-party and the company behind got its
step.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;is&mdash;a&mdash;tavern&mdash;in&mdash;the
&mdash;town," roared the band, and the men stepped briskly.</p>

<p>"Take me a week to get this mud off," grumbled the right-hand
man of the leading four.</p>

<p>"Same here," agreed his supporter.</p>

<h3>WHAT KILLED "POOR OLD MICK"?</h3>

<p class="first">CURIOUS pedestrians stopped to view the military pageant, and people on the tops of tramway-cars leant over.</p>

<p>"Poor old Mick," said one of the firing party. "Picture of
'ealth, wasn't 'e?"</p>

<p>"He'd have bin all right if 'e 'adn't gone to the hospital,"
said the party addressed, and the remark was passed along and
approved with a gloomy nodding of heads.</p>

<p>"I remember one night me an' him was down at the Phoenix, an'
a feller said&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the sergeant spoke.</p>

<p>"Stop that talking, Brown."</p>

<p>A long, long pause, with only the tramping of feet and the
joyous song of the band.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
Adieu, adieu, adieu, adieu,<br>
I can. no longer stay with you,<br>
Stay with you.</p>

<br>

<p>The sergeant dropped back a little, until he was level with
the colour-sergeant of the mourning company.</p>

<p>"I told him there was another way&mdash;if we'd come along the
main road and turned off by the Clarendon."</p>

<p>"Coach and Horses," corrected the colour-sergeant.</p>

<p>"My mistake; if we'd turned off by the Coach and Horses we'd
have saved about a mile."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he?" asked the despairing colour-sergeant.</p>

<p>"He said we'd better keep to the main road, and then we
couldn't go wrong."</p>

<p>The colour-sergeant shook his head helplessly.</p>

<p>"I wonder they let a young chap like that take charge of a
thing like this."</p>

<p>The officer under discussion was plodding along with an
anxious eye for stealthy electric cars that whizzed past
momentarily.</p>

<p>"I took him in a bit of tobacco," said the anecdotal man of
the firing party relieved from the attentions of the
sergeant.</p>

<p>"'How are you, Mick?' I sez.</p>

<p>"'Pretty bad, George. I don't think I shall ever get over
this.'</p>

<p>"'Dry up,' I sez. 'You'll be out in a day or two, as right as
ninepence.'</p>

<p>"'Straordinary thing," confessed the speaker, "'ow you say the
wrong thing at the right time. I sez to him, 'Don't be down-hearted,' an' then I remembered 'e had heart disease. But 'e
didn't see the joke in a manner of speakin'. 'I don't think
they're givin' me the proper kind of medicine,' 'e sez."</p>

<p>The firing party marched and listen, and the youngest of them
all offered a suggestion.</p>

<p>"Somebody ought to write to the papers about it."</p>

<p>"I can't say," said Fatty Johnson, the adjutant's groom, "that
I exactly remember 'im&mdash;was he a little feller with a big
nose?"</p>

<p>A chorus of corrections.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;a tall chap with red 'air&mdash;you knew 'im,
Fatty&mdash;the chap that ueed to sing 'The Young 'Ero.'"</p>

<p>Fatty shook his head doubtingly.</p>

<p>"There was a little feller with a big nose," he insisted;
"used to 'ang around the canteen a lot. Wasn't that him?"</p>

<h3>"STOP THAT TALKING!"</h3>

<p class="first">THE sergeant was back again, and the firing party looked ahead, each man taking on the look of innocence which best suited him.</p>

<p>"Not much use speakin' to some of you men," added the sergeant
by way of comment. "If you're not very careful a few of you will
find yourselves in the guard-room before you're many days
older."</p>

<p>The music stopped with a final crash, in which every
instrument did its best to outshine the others.</p>

<p>"Have you ever noticed," asked the euphonium of the French
horn, "'ow, when there's a garden party on, and you're engaged to
play away, somebody always goes an' dies?"</p>

<p>French horn gave an impatient and sympathetic jerk of his
head.</p>

<p>"Always the way," he admitted, and hastened to ask, "Who was
he? I only came off leave just before we marched out."</p>

<p>"A chap in 'B' Company. Nice feller by all accounts; just
joined from the second battalion."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"Aneurism of the something aorta." The alto drummer, with a
hospital course behind him, took advantage of the pause.</p>

<p>The band agreed that it was a very dangerous complaint, and
were reasonably sympathetic. The subaltern had called the
sergeant to him, and the firing party were again in a
conversational mood.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand, sergeant, why we play lively music
coming back from&mdash;er&mdash;an occasion like this."</p>

<p>The sergeant was deferential, and said he had often thought it
was rather funny himself.</p>

<p>"Do you think that the idea is to cheer up the men?" asked the
subaltern.</p>

<p>The sergeant smiled respectfully, and thought that there might
be something in that.</p>

<p>"About this man, sergeant," the subaltern, went on; "this man
we've&mdash;er&mdash;buried, don't you know. I suppose he's got
friends and&mdash;er&mdash;relations&mdash;and next of kin, and
all that sort of thing, what?"</p>

<p>"No relations at all, sir," said the sergeant.</p>

<p>The subaltern breathed a sigh of relief, for he was very
young, very sentimental, and very tender-hearted.</p>

<p>"Pretty good thing," he said, and the sergeant agreed.</p>

<p>They were nearing barracks now, and the band-sergeant, looking
over his shoulder, caught the eye of his men.</p>

<p>"Lincolnshire Poacher," he commanded. "Now, are you ready?
One, two, three&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
For it's my delight,<br>
On a starry night,<br>
At this season of the year.</p>

<br>

<p>Through the barrack gate with a guard presenting arms.</p>

<p>"Eyes left!"</p>

<p>Silence in the rank now, for they are turning on to the
barrack square.</p>

<p>"Halt&mdash;front."</p>

<p>Two minutes later, as the dismissed company was melting away,
the sergeant remarked to the colour-sergeant:</p>

<p>"The worst of funerals is that it breaks into the afternoon.
There isn't time for a sleep, and it isn't time for tea."</p>

<p>"Come and have a drink," said the colour-sergeant wisely.</p>

<p class="first">"DO you do much motoring?"</p>

<p>I made a flippant reference to the Arrow and Vanguard
services.</p>

<p>"But have you done much motoring&mdash;have you owned a
car?"</p>

<p>Once upon a time, as I related, I bought a German car with
French engines. I also acquired a serious chauffeur and two
acetylene lamps. </p>

<p>The car suffered from many ailments, most of which the serious
chauffeur&mdash;he is a policeman now, poor fellow&mdash;was able
to diagnose with accuracy, but none of which he was able to cure.
</p>

<p>It was a nice-looking car, with a beautiful leather hood, and
ran easily with two persons, or, without the hood three.</p>

<p>When I drove down-hill I got up terrible speed, especially if
the hood was on ; but when it came to climbing hills I used to
get out and walk ahead, pretending that the labouring machine
behind and the red-faced chauffeur&mdash;more serious than
ever&mdash;had nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>It was a nice car for the winter, because the works were under
the seat, and they kept one's feet warm. Also in the summer the
scent of petrol banished the moths from one's clothes.</p>

<p>I used to drive about in motor-goggles, and as people always
associate goggles with speed I deceived a man into making me an
offer for the car.</p>

<p>The letter containing this offer came by the night post, and I
took a cab and drove to his house to accept. I did not take the
car, because I wanted to reach him before he changed his
mind.</p>

<p>As to motoring....</p>

<p>"But," persisted the inquiring enthusiast, "have you any idea
of speed&mdash;have you ever travelled in a racing car, in a car
that doesn't stop to think...?"</p>

<p>I cited the cars I had known&mdash;the 24-h.p. Coliseum, the
12-h.p. Little Wanderer, the 6- or 8- (as the case may be) h.p.
Runaway....</p>

<p>"Very good," said the enthusiast, "I will call for you at ten
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>So he came.</p>

<p>He brought a machine. None of your rough-finished, soap-box
seated racing cars painted like a dirty war-ship, but a sleek
green Mercedes "60" touring car, all varnish and polished brass
and silver fittings, with a fur-coated chauffeur lolling back in
the armchair seat, and taking no interest in the proceedings.</p>

<p>"Are we going to a wedding?" I asked, and regretted that I had
not put on a tie to match the car. </p>

<p>Then we started.</p>

<p><br>
THE car was purring, like a tame cat, as we played musical
chairs with the traffic of Ealing; it made no protest when asked
to spring between a brewers' dray and a tramway car in Brentford
High Street; it stopped dead before a nervous lady pedestrian,
who was standing in the middle of the street debating whether to
scream or faint, and reached Hounslow before we&mdash;the
enthusiast and I&mdash;had finished saying what we had to say
about nervous pedestrians.</p>

<p>Outside Hounslow we met the Blue Car, and the young man who
drove the Blue Car sat without cap or goggles, his hair streaming
out behind and a black smut on his nose. His expression was the
expression common to all hardened chauffeurs&mdash;a reflective,
thinking-of-mother expression.</p>

<p>The Blue Car was just ahead of us when we saw it. We did not
know it was blue because it trailed a skirt off dust behind it
that obscured the landscape. Later we leapt up to it, and got
ahead. I think our dust must have annoyed the Blue Car very much,
for between Hounslow and Basingstoke it sneaked past us at a
level crossing.</p>

<p>Then we came to a great stretch of country inhabited by furze
bushes and telegraph poles, and the fur-coated young man who sat
by my side pulled down his goggles and slowly shifted a small
lever on the steering wheel. Then for the first time I was
conscious that a high wind blew. A wind that hammered my face and
filled my lungs, a wind that roared about my ears till I was
deafened. The Blue Car was ahead. Surely it had stopped. As we
passed it I got one fleeting glimpse of the smutty-faced young
man&mdash;supremely indifferent and still thinking of his mother.
At the same time I noticed to my amazement that the Blue Car
really was in motion, and that the telegraph poles that lined the
road were passing with remarkable rapidity. Tho enthusiast leant
over. "Sixty-five miles an hour," said his lips....</p>

<p><br>
THERE was a village ahead, and we slowed down. Three little
boys standing on the sidewalk displayed an inclination to "run
across," and the chauffeur lifted an admonitory finger. The
little boys stopped abashed, and we passed. The little boys who
were the pioneers of the "running across" game are no longer with
us to encourage the present generation. </p>

<p>We passed the outskirts of Basingstoke before we realised that
we had left London. On the side-path an innocent old gentleman
lifted a stick.... We stopped in twenty yards, and the chauffeur
descended and made an inspection of his oil-gauges&mdash;an
earnest inspection that took him several minutes. Not so the
chauffeur of the Blue Car, who streaked past
triumphantly&mdash;and was stopped twenty yards further on by a
policeman.</p>

<p>The innocent old gentleman with the stick was one end of a
"trap"&mdash;the waiting policeman the other. Alas! for the
vanity of Blue Cars; we passed the group at a funeral
pace&mdash;a policeman, a note-book, and a chauffeur with a smut
on his nose. </p>

<p>In the open country again. Long, long stretches of white road,
a wild; deserted world, and a slender spire on the sky-line.</p>

<p>Again the high wind, and the buffeting and the breathlessness
and the whizzing telegraph poles and the <i>throb, throb</i> of
the engine as the car flew across Salisbury Plain. A solitary
cyclist ahead waved a hand, and we slowed.</p>

<p>He came up to us in a tremendous pace, and the tiny engine of
his cycle working <i>pipity-pipity-pipity-pip</i>.</p>

<p>He passed like flash, but the waving hand said "trap" quite
plainly, so we crawled. This time it was an innocent-looking
agricultural labourer&mdash;with a walking-stick&mdash;and his
pal was lying on the grass a mile further on&mdash;a measured
mile.</p>

<p>And so the day passed, a procession of long roads, of fresh
green hedges, quaint cottages, gardens ablaze with blossoms,
rivers and wet meadows, gloomy stretches of plain, crooked,
narrow streets of country towns, till night came.</p>

<p>By then we were moving towards London, two white beams of
light thrown ahead showing the road. Ghostly figures rose from
the road and passed; invisible cyclists came into the circle of
light and vanished. Lumbering waggons filling up the
road&mdash;with no light to show their presence&mdash;appeared,
and were circumvented.</p>

<p>The <i>blasé</i> chauffeur, touching a handle here and a lever
there, working with both hands and both feet, sends us along
through the darkness&mdash;accurately, unswervingly. Isn't it a
little dangerous perhaps for the cyclist, for the pedestrian?</p>

<p>A nervous young man wheeling ahead lost his presence of mind,
wobbled, slipped, and fell in our track... but the car stopped
almost in its own length, and the young man, dazed but voluble,
called himself all kinds of a fool, and explained that he was a
nervous idiot&mdash;hoped he hadn't alarmed us. We expressed our
thankfulness that we had been able to pull up in time.</p>

<p>The chauffeur yawned.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1913-01-21"></a>WILLING BUT WORKLESS</h2>

<h3>WITH THE STARVING DOCKERS</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Grenfell Record and Lachlan District
Advertiser</i>,<br>
NSW, Australia, 24 January 1913</h3>

<p class="first">IT is a grey, raw morning, and above the high
blank wall the masts of the docked shipping show like a
straggling copse of tall pines dimly through the river fog.</p>

<p>There is a distant clank and roar and tinkle, as great cranes
swing monotonously from to chute, or from deck to quay, and with
the impatient toots of invisible tug boats, fussily busy in the
yellow mist, mingles the deep-throated bellow of the slow-moving
liner, making cautious progress to its moorings.</p>

<p>Outside the dock-gate, a swaying, shouting mass of men; a
great, twisting, writhing mob, fighting for some incomprehensible
goal. How they fight! Like savage beasts, pitiless in their
eagerness to attain their desire. Old men, grey of beard and
white of face, stagger out of the scrum and fall back to watch
their more robust fellows. Old men, with knotted hands and lean,
stringy necks, who shake hopeless heads wearily.</p>

<p>"I've known the time," says one, "when I could have held my
own with the best of 'em."</p>

<p>There is no resentment in the tone, only a helplessness, an
infinite regret.</p>

<p>Then the weaklings who have hovered round the fringe of the
mass fall away. Young weaklings, some of them, coughing harshly,
and drawing tattered neck-cloths across their throats with thin
hands.</p>

<p>"They ain't used to the game," says the old man
contemptuously; "clerks they are. out of work clerks. They'll
never get a chance with that lot. Now, when I was younger I could
have held my own...."</p>

<h3>TOO OLD AT SEVENTY</h3>

<p class="first">THERE is a sharp word from the dockward
edge of the crowd and the fighting ceases instantly. The mob
melts into little streams that slowly meander in every direction.
One burly man passes, wiping his forehead with a red
handkerchief. To him the old man addresses a question.</p>

<p>"Only seven," is the answer good-naturedly given. "I thought
I'd 'a' got on to-day. Whew! It's 'ot: Got a penny about
yer?"</p>

<p>The old man shakes his head.</p>

<p>"Only had one day's work this week, Jim," he says, and the
burly man with a curt nod passes on.</p>

<p>"How much have you earned this week?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Six and six," he replies. "I might 'a' got a day yesterday if
I could 'a' pushed my way to the front. I've known the time...."
he adds wistfully.</p>

<p>"What do you do for food?"</p>

<p>He regards me with some suspicion. </p>

<p>"Haven't had any to-day," he says.</p>

<p>"How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Seventy-two," he answers simply.</p>

<p>A little man saunters by, pinched of face and heavy-eyed. He
nods to the old man and stops, and they talk of docks and ships,
and times gone by.</p>

<p>"Been up since four," says the little man: "I thought I was
going to be strangled over there"&mdash;he jerks his thumb in the
direction of the dock gates&mdash;"haven't done a stroke for six
weeks."</p>

<p>Then he made a statement which is so peculiar to the cheaper
form of melodrama that I hesitate to repeat it. The reader will
understand my feelings, and the curate who warned me the other
day against retailing lurid stories will accept my apologies, for
what the man said with all simplicity was:</p>

<p>"My wife and children are starving, and I haven't eaten food
for two days."</p>

<p>Frankly, I did not believe the latter part of his statement
till I saw him eat. I did not credit the story of the wife and
children till I had walked home with him. He is an "upstairs"
lodger. He lives in the front room, and so does his wife, a
pleasantly-spoken woman, who prior to her marriage was a domestic
servant.</p>

<h3>SLOW STARVATION</h3>

<p class="first">IN the same room live seven children, two of
whom have measles, and one, a baby of seven months, is, unless I
am at fault, sickening rapidly for croup. You might not think
there was space in a small room for nine, but, by a fortunate
dispensation of providence, very little of the available space is
occupied by furniture.</p>

<p>From a purely hygienic point of view the conditions, if not
perfect, are favorable, for the walls and the floors are bare.
The cheap chromographs and engravings of the "Black Brunswicker"
order are gone. They fetched as much as a shilling a piece. The
little glass ornaments and the distorting mirror have been turned
into bread and coal, so have the sound chairs, and the small
table and the strip of carpet. There is still a bedstead left. I
mentally valued that at threepence.</p>

<p>The children had had bread, collected from house to house: the
sick children had had milk, a quart being allowed by the
relieving-officer. The mother and the father had had nothing. And
the man was a teetotaller. Drink, which the glib-tongued ;
specialists of the West End adduce as the essence of all
poverty&mdash;it is more often the effect&mdash;was in no way
responsible for this misery.</p>

<p>It was a whimsical conceit of mine, but I could not resist the
temptation. As I turned to go down the stairs I asked the man:
"Are you a believer in the 'big loaf of free trade?'"</p>

<p>He was no politician, for he was somewhat mystified by the
question.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," he said awkwardly: "I believe in
any loaf I've got the money to buy&mdash;if you haven't got work
you can't buy bread, can you?"</p>

<p>He said this quite innocently, and I do not for one moment
imagine that he knew the significance of .his simple
conclusions.</p>

<h3>WITH ILLUSTRATIONS FROM <i>THE ROYAL MAGAZINE</i></h3>

<h3>As published in:<br>
<i>The Royal Magazine</i>, C. Arthur Pearson, London, December 1914</h3>

         title="Under Fire">
  </div>

<p class="first">THE man on the extreme right of the line
fidgeted uneasily. He looked round with a frown to the corporal a
little behind and saw me. I wore the red cross brassard over my
civilian jacket. This he saw, and wriggled uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"There ought to be somebody on the right here," he grumbled.
"Bit too conspicuous bein' on the extreme right...."</p>

<p>He had never been under fire before, so his perturbation was
natural. It is much easier to fight shoulder to shoulder than in
extended order; it is even easier to fight in extended order, if
you have a man on either side of you.</p>

<p>I told him to sit down&mdash;the other men of the line were
sprawling at ease, waiting for the word to advance.</p>

<p>"How does it feel?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Rotten," said I truthfully, "but only for a minute or
so."</p>

<p>"When are they going to begin?" he demanded, and scowled at
the blue line of hills ahead bathed in a white hot flood of
sunshine.</p>

<p>Far away to the right the cavalry was moving forward. They
went ahead very slowly, as though uncertain of their
direction.</p>

<p>They moved to the right, and halted&mdash;then they went on
again, still slowly, reluctantly, and finally disappeared in a
fold of the yellow ground.</p>

<p>"Waiting for the guns," I said, and looked behind.</p>

<p>Yes, there they were, four batteries in four straight lines
stretching backward. Now they were moving left and right, and
presently, when they touched suitable ground, they would
deploy.</p>

<p>Out of the blue hills ahead, as though from some rent of a
crater, drifted a long wisp of white smoke.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen." The voice, strident and clear, was the
voice of a soldier squatting on the ground, his elbows on his
knees, his chin in his hands. "Ladies and gentlemen, we are just
about to begin. Come-and-see-the-big-guns-of-the-enemy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fall in!" The line came to its feet.</p>

<p><i>"Whoom&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;!"</i></p>

<p>Like a growl of thunder came the report of the gun on the
hill. Over to the right, where the cavalry had disappeared, a big
fountain of earth leapt straight into the air, another wisp of
smoke from the hill, another and another, and even in the
sunlight you saw the quick lick of flame.</p>

<p>"Duck, ye devils!"</p>

<p>A man on the left gives the warning, and as the new men obey
him a roar of laughter sweeps along the line. A great joke to see
the new men duck their heads as, with a roar like that of a train
passing through a station, something flies overhead and buries
itself in the soft earth to the rear of the line.</p>

<p><i>"Phew!"</i></p>

<p>The man on the right wipes his forehead with the back of his
hand, and looks back curiously at the place where the shell
struck.</p>

<p>"Nice thing&mdash;ain't it?" he asks in a tone of complaint
and despair, "bein' hit by a thing like
that&mdash;<i>phew</i>."</p>

<p><i>"Pang!"</i></p>

<p>Our guns are in action behind us&mdash;and there go the
cavalry&mdash;far, far to the right&mdash;slow no longer, but
sweeping swiftly forward to their invisible goal. All the sides
of the blue hills are hazy with smoke now.</p>

<p><i>"Pang! Pang! Pang!"</i></p>

<p>Our guns are going furiously. Little puffs of white smoke hang
over the hill ahead; you hear the echo&mdash;like the sound of
exploding shrapnel.</p>

<p>"'S'awful, ain't it"</p>

<p>The man on the right is changing his attitude. His voice has
lost the note of terror, and there has come a hint of admiring
interest. Even in his "'S'awful," he would not have it less awful
for worlds. The shock has passed, he has experienced his worst
sensation, and is now blooded to war.</p>

<p>"How long are they going to keep us here?" he asks, and you
know that if he wants to move it is forward.</p>

<p>The whine of shells overhead is incessant, but presently you
detect a difference of sound.</p>

<p><i>"Crash!"</i></p>

<p>The shrapnel now, high-pitched, perfectly timed, and
scattering as well-behaved shrapnel should do. It patters on the
ground like rain, and men edge to the left and right
instinctively.</p>

<p>"Line will advance&mdash;keep your distance &mdash;plenty of
time, my lads."</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="2000631h-images/UnderFire-02.gif"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>A red-faced lieutenant, obviously ablaze with excitement,
nurses his platoon, walking ahead of them, now walking backward
like a Salvation Army captain, now throwing his words across his
shoulder. He is young and without experience, but he is obsessed
with the sense of his responsibilities.</p>

<p>"Keep your lines&mdash;nothing to worry about&mdash;march on
the centre&mdash;"</p>

<p>A piping voice from the ranks arrests him.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir your bootlace is untied."</p>

<p>A ripple of quiet laughter, a broad grin on the face of the
major commanding the company, and the red-faced officer stoops,
fumbling at his lace, and the line passes him. He is back soon,
running to overtake them.</p>

<p>The shrapnel is bursting behind them.
Six&mdash;seven&mdash;eight shells; then the enemy get the range.
A man slips forward and goes sprawling to the earth with
outstretched hands. The man at his right hesitates, and looks
down at the silent, bleeding figure.</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="2000631h-images/UnderFire-03.gif"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<p>"Leave that man!"</p>

<p>The major swings round and roars the order:</p>

<p>"Leave him, confound you&mdash;leave him!"</p>

<p>So they leave him on the ground for the Royal Army Medical
Corps, which will be working up from the rear.</p>

<p>Onward, onward, slowly, slowly, but always onward. Over gentle
rises of ground where men crouch low as they walk, down deep
hollows, and up the slope on the other side.</p>

<p>The skirmishing line is under rifle fire now. It whistles and
whiffles about them; it sends the dust spurting up at their
feet.</p>

<p>"Take cover in that donga&mdash;double!"</p>

<p>Now they are running swiftly to the first line of cover. Men
go down here and there, but the man on the right doesn't seem to
care. He is full of eager excitement, swings ahead of the line,
and is gruffly checked by his officer.</p>

<p>They make the cover and crouch, panting and chuckling.</p>

<p>"Six hundred yards&mdash;commence firing! "</p>

<p>Up till now they haven't fired a shot. But now the well-oiled
bolts are clicking all along the line, and the yellow cartridges
are tinkling to the chamber.</p>

<p><i>"Bang&mdash;bang!"</i></p>

<p>At first lazily, and then in a fury of rattling sound, the
rifles are going off.</p>

<p>"Aim steadily! That streak of yellow ahead is the trench!
Steady, now&mdash;don't waste ammunition! What the devil are you
firing at, Jackson&mdash;the moon?"</p>

<p>The shrapnel has the range again, and is bursting accurately
over the cover.</p>

<p>"Line will advance&mdash;double!"</p>

<p>Out of the donga they scramble, a thousand yellow coats, and
fly as fast as legs can carry across the bare patch of ground
which separates them from the enemy. A whistle shrills, and
obediently the thousand sink to earth, taking what cover they
can. More whistles&mdash;the extended line is closing stealthily
on the centre. Another rush forward&mdash;again the whistle,
then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fix bayonets!"</p>

<p>How they rattle, those bayonets, how they "snick" down to
groove and catch!</p>

<p>You can see the trenches plainly, you can feel the men in
them. The air is all shrill sound, and the bursting shrapnel
overhead is a ceaseless clatter.</p>

<p>"Winchesters!"</p>

<p>It is the wild, exultant cry of the colonel&mdash;the only man
who may address the regiment by its title.</p>

<p>"Winchesters, follow me&mdash;charge!"</p>

<p>Up they leap, a savage, glittering line.</p>

<p>With one wild yell&mdash;a throaty and roaring yell like a
harsh and sustained "Ahr-r-r!"&mdash;the line breaks into a
jogtrot run. Men spin round and fall, men sink limply like tired
children, men swear at their comrades who get in the way, but the
line, as a coherent, terrible force, drives forward to the end of
the trenches, and the bayonets rise and fall....</p>

<p>"Signalman!"</p>

<p>The colonel shakes his bleeding hand and blinks round for his
man, and the corporal, with his swung tripod, fixes its three
legs into the earth and adjusts his mirror.</p>

<p>"Heliograph to the general: 'Taken first line of the trenches.
Enemy is now retiring on second line.'"</p>

<p>The man on the right, balancing his rifle, turns and
smiles.</p>

<p>"I hope we're going to take the second line," he says. "How
did I feel under fire? Fine! I forgot all about everything, but
what I forgot first was&mdash;that I was under fire"</p>

<p>That is always the way.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1915-11-20"></a>THE RAID</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Daily Advertiser</i>, Wagga Wagga,
NSW, Australia, 20 November 1915</h3>

<p class="quote">"... visited the London district last night and
dropped incendiary and explosive bombs." &mdash;Official
Report.</p>

<h3>SOMEWHERE IN THE LONDON DISTRICT</h3>

<p class="first">It is curious, thought I, that the cinema film
of the French trenches, showing the danger in which men stand in
war, evoked so little applause from a crowded house. They took
everything for granted, this audience&mdash;the danger, the
wreckage of buildings, the everlasting vigilance of the men at
the loop-holes.</p>

<p>I wondered what would happen if a prowling Zeppelin dropped a
bomb slap through the gilded roof of this luxurious little hall.
Would the audience sit as stolidly, and would the listless young
man behind me turn to his bored companion and drawl, "Oh," I've
seen that sort of thing before."</p>

<p>"But what would you do, Edgar Wallace?" demanded the inner
part of me.</p>

<p>I should have a big spasm of funk, I confessed. I have been
under fire many times. I should not like to say how many. I have
been industriously sniped by the finest marksmen in the world, I
have felt my horse quiver and cough beneath me before he went
down on his Knees and rolled over, kicking away what was left of
his life: I have been shelled by big gun and little in a score of
small and big actions. And every new experience&mdash;and it was
new if a day or two of immunity intervened&mdash;brought to me
the same spasm of cold fear, the same bone-dryness of mouth, the
same little tremble of hand. It doesn't last very long&mdash;the
third or fourth shell restores you to your normal phlegm, but,
whilst it lasts, it is humiliating.</p>

<p>So what right have I to sit in judgment of these callous folk
who have heard nothing more shocking than the pop of a ginger-beer cork?</p>

<p>The streets in this particular portion of the London District
were crowded, and I walked slowly in the direction of my
home.</p>

<p>I stood for a moment at the corner of one of the principal
streets, watching the people, and glanced, as has become a habit,
at the sky. One star shone with remarkable brilliance in the
south-western heavens. A fine, unblinking spot of light. Now if
Zeppelins carried searchlights, that might be.... But Zeppelins,
though popularly supposed to carry this picturesque equipment, do
not show it. And as I watched, noting the fineness of the night,
a momentary glance, as swift and vivid as summer lightning lit
the sky, throwing into relief the nearby roofs and chimney
pots....</p>

<p>That twinge of panic which I had not experienced for thirteen
years came to me, for I knew all that that flicker of hot light
portended.</p>

<p><i>"Bom-m-m!"</i></p>

<p>There was no mistaking that.</p>

<p>The leisurely throng checked in its walk and half turned. A
man and girl in front of me stood stock still, the man with a
frown, the girl O-mouthed.</p>

<p>"Zep'lins!" said the man breathlessly.</p>

<p>It was the nearest approach to panic that I saw. Into the dark
sky leapt two white beams of light. They wavered for what seemed
an eternity as they searched not hurriedly, but systematically,
for the offender.</p>

<p>Up leapt another beam and another, and yet another, and then,
as if acting in unison, they concentrated on one spot.</p>

<p>There it was!</p>

<p>Something for all the world like a torpedo-shaped cigar. It
moved serenely in a halo of light unperturbed by the sudden
exposure. There was a certain majesty in the spectacle, a certain
awfulness which was more than a little impressive.</p>

<p>There it sailed ten thousand feet above man's earth, its
invisible gondola crowded with men, its unseen propellers
whirling&mdash;an atom in space charged with the task of
terrifying six millions of people.</p>

<p>Serene it might be, for just so long as it takes to open a
breech-block and slip in a cartridge. Already in half-a-dozen gun
positions keen-eyed men were glancing along the sights.</p>

<p><i>"Bang!"</i></p>

<p>There was a crash, and another, and another.</p>

<p>Something whined through the darkness, three splashes of light
burst about the cigar&mdash;three points of soft light, such as
you may see from any headland when the incoming liner spells her
number in fire.</p>

<p>Again came the muffled roar of a bomb, but now the guns were
banging furiously. Above, below, to the right and left of the
shape; the stars of light were flickering and fading. Moving
through a mist of smoke the machine nose-dived a full thousand
feet earthward.</p>

<p>But it recovered and sped upward, pointing its blue nose to
the sky.</p>

<p>It turned first to the westward as though it contemplated
returning, then to the northward, then to the westward
again....</p>

<p>It seemed like a thing baffled and cornered and seeking a way
of escape. For now every searchlight in the district was on
it&mdash;whichever way it moved, the inexorable light
followed.</p>

<p>I stood amidst a wholly-curious crowd&mdash;a crowd which
showed no sign of panic, not even, when the ghost shape appeared
as though he would return; a crowd which cheered the marksmanship
of the unknown gunners, that cheered the clanging fire-engines as
they raced through the street towards the glare from the sky, a
glare which grew from copper to crimson as the moments
passed.</p>

<p>One lady alone did I meet who showed any sign of terror. She

<p class="first">WOMAN the warrior has taken her place in the
ranks of the great industrial army which, at the moment of
writing, is helping to win the war for England and her
Allies.</p>

<p>Her arrival on the scene is a cause for misgiving. Men she has
replaced are speculating upon the possibilities of the future,
not realising that Britain is in the position of a great factory
which has always been understaffed, <i>and that there are not
sufficient men in the country for the adequate development of her
industries.</i></p>

<h3>A DEARTH OF MEN</h3>

<p class="first">THE after-the-war difficulty will not be, how
shall we find work for men, but, how shall we get the men we
require?</p>

<p>Woman has already supplied half the answer to that question.
She has made it abundantly clear that she can take certain jobs
and release men not only for fighting with rifle and bayonet, but
with lathe and machine in the war which is to follow the war.</p>

<p>If modern man is puzzled as to woman's future place in
industry, how much more would be the ancient philosophers, if you
could transport them from the spaces of immortality and engage
their minds in the problem which is presented by the war woman
and her future. Euripides saw his ideal in one who "remained
quiet within the home." Socrates would have set his face most
resolutelv against the modern war-worker, believing that her
introduction into man's spheres would react to his
disadvantage.</p>

<p>"Woman, once equal to man, becomes his superior," he said, and
in the terms of equality he must have included her equality of
opportunity.</p>

<h3>WOMEN AFTER THE WAR</h3>

<p class="first">ENGLAND asks, and asks in all seriousness, what
is to be the position of woman when the war is ended? Will she
retire gracefully into the oblivion from whence she came? Will
the neat 'bus-conductresses, the messenger-girls, the women
ticket-collectors and inspectors, the lift-girls, and the
like&mdash;will these go back to whatever was their task before
the exigencies of war brought them to fill man's place?</p>

<p>The answer is "No."</p>

<p>The returned men will come against Woman the
Warrior&mdash;woman, who, obeying the unerring instinct which
every mother-heart holds, the instinct, not of self-preservation,
but race-preservation, will oppose the return of men to jobs
which women can fill. Not necessarily the women who are at
present employed in work which the majority regard as temporary,
but the army of women who will march along the path which these
pioneers have cut.</p>

<p>Let this be remembered: that nothing so rouses the scorn of
womankind as the spectacle of men filling women's jobs. There
never was a woman who respected a shop-walker or counter-clerk.
There never was a woman who did not regard a male domestic with
contempt. The only domestic servants of a household that the
educated woman ever met on anything like human terms were the
groom or the chauffeur&mdash;because they were doing men's work,
and work which was too heavy for a woman to perform.</p>

<h3>THE TWO ESSENTIALS</h3>

<p class="first">WOMEN require manliness in men. They demand the
exhibition of strength or exceptional ingenuity. They have
implanted in them the consciousness that life is a mental
progression, and that mentality is, or should be, one of the most
important weapons in man's equipment.</p>

<p>The woman comes to replace men who are either physically
unfitted for manual labour, or were occupying positions which
rendered it unnecessary for the job holders to employ their
superior physical gifts. Those men, replaced by women, went into
the Army or, in other words, went into physical training.</p>

<p>There is no reason why, at the end of the war, such men should
revert to boy-jobs. There is no reason in the world why they
should not be absorbed by the factories, which should be
increased in number, and should be fully occupied in meeting the
heavy demands consequent upon trade recovery after the war.</p>

<h3>WANTED! A MANUFACTURING ARMY</h3>

<p class="first">WE need more than an army to fight&mdash;we
shall need a great manufacturing army.</p>

<p>Germany exported to England alone enormous quantities of
manufactured goods which will have to be made at home. She also
exported these to Russia and to France &mdash;and we shall secure
a portion of that trade.</p>

<p>A million pounds worth of motor chassis came from
Germany&mdash;that million (or a greater part) will be spent in
England. £300,000 extra will be paid in wages&mdash; 2000 or 3000
men must be found additional to those who were being employed
before the war in motor-car manufacture. Women will largely
replace the men who go into the factories. £3,000,000 worth of
chemicals ; £700,000 worth of earthenware (the raw material came
from Cornwall and Devon!); nearly £7,000,000 worth of soft goods,
gloves, hosiery, lace, etc., came from Germany (here is
employment for 20,000 or 30,000, mostly women); boots and shoes
to the amount of £1,500,000; iron, steel, electrical goods,
machinery, etc., £10,000,000 (20,000 to 30,000 extra workmen
required).</p>

<p>How are we to obtain the skilled man labour to cope with the
demand upon our industries which must inevitably follow the end
of the war?</p>

<p>It must be drawn from those departments of industry which have
hitherto attracted the unskilled labour.</p>

<p>New armies of mechanics mean new armies of clerks, messengers,
and carriers. Our greatest problem will not be to oust woman,
since woman, the warrior, is not to be ousted, but to persuade
her to continue in the work which she is now performing.</p>

<h3>THE PROBLEM BEFORE EMPLOYEES</h3>

<p class="first">I HAVE been at some pains to discover the
feelings of the women themselves upon this very important
subject, and I append a few typical cases, showing the
considerable difficulties which employers of labour will
experience when the war is over.</p>

<p>Let it be remembered that there are few skilled machinists or
engineers at the Front. They are included in the two million now
engaged, in munition work. Let it be remembered, too, that their
numbers must be considerably augmented, and that thousands of men
who left boy-jobs will come back to men's work.</p>

<p>That is a point which I would very strongly emphasise. The
lift-men, the messengers, the ticket-inspectors&mdash;who are
amongst the poorest paid of workers&mdash;will find more
lucrative employment elsewhere. The employer may be faced with
the alternative of women or nothing. The present great army of
women employed are merely the pioneers of woman labour in unusual
occupations. From what I have been able to gather, they
themselves regard their work as purely temporary and for the
duration of the war only, and the majority do not seriously
consider the possibility of continuing in their present
occupations.</p>

<br>

<p class="first"><b>H.B.</b>, before the war was a waitress in a
tea shop. She is now a conductress. After the war she will marry
her "boy," who is now serving in France with a heavy gun
detachment. She is not greatly enamoured of her present job, save
that it gives her a certain authority which is pleasing.</p>

<br>

<p class="first"><b>H.M.</b>, before the war was a
"bookkeeper"&mdash;a vague description which when worked out
proved to be a cash-girl at a stationery shop. She is now working
a Tube lift, and prefers the work. She likes the authority she
possesses, which is in contrast to her previous position. After
the war she hopes to marry and "settle down." She has no young
man in France, but harbours the faith that "Mr. Right" will one
day float into her orbit.</p>

<br>

<p class="first"><b>K.V.</b>, before the war was a shorthand
typist (not a particularly good one, and probably only in the
novice stage). She is now engaged in a munition shop, and "likes
the life"&mdash;and the wages. She is married, and (during the
war) her husband is in France. When he returns, she will not go
out to business as her husband objects.</p>

<br>

<p class="first"><b>K.C.</b>, before the war a domestic servant
(there are very few domestic servants to be met with, but this is
probably due to the fact that the girls will not admit that
occupation), now employed as conductress. Likes the work, but
"too hard for a woman." Regards her profession as essentially a
war-time product. After or during the war will marry a man now
engaged in munition work.</p>

<br>

<p class="first"><b>S.J.</b>, before the war of no occupation,
lived with her parents, now a conductress. Educated at
Cheltenham. Advanced views on woman's place in the world. Young,
and has no desire to continue working after the war. Gives her
wages to a benevolent fund (for 'busmen).</p>

<br>

<p class="first"><b>M.A.O.</b>, before the war of no occupation.
Soldier's widow. Has two children. Now employed as messenger.
Likes the work, and especially cycling. Says she wishes to
continue, "as it is only boys' work." Very intelligent girl, and
holds the view that all boys should be compelled to serve an
apprenticeship at some trade or other, but only for three years.
After that, apprenticeship should be voluntary. This would give
women such work as messengers, lift-boys, bell-boys, and booking-clerks do.</p>
<br>

<p class="first"><b>R.C.</b>, before the war a shorthand-typist
and secretary, now in a railway ticket-office. She likes the
work, but finds it very exacting. After the war she will
marry.</p>

<p><br>
I HAVE conducted inquiries into some 150 cases, and these
are the facts that stand out:</p>

<ol>
<li>The majority of women questioned have as the goal of
their ambitions, marriage and a home. Very few, indeed, seriously
consider their future in relation to independent employment.</li>

<li>Those who like their jobs are most pleased by the authority
which the uniform or their position gives to them. They have
never before had the right to address such peremptory
instructions as "Step lively!" or "Show your ticket!" to mere
men&mdash;indeed, the majority are meeting man in his oppressed
state for the first time, and find the experience both novel and
delightful.</li>

<li>They mostly agree that the men with whom they work are
suspicious and resentful of this intrusion. They all agree that
the great public, whom they are meeting for the first time, are
considerate and polite.</li>

</ol>

<p><br>
IT will be seen that few of these women regard their positions
in the light of a permanency, and that is as it should be. The
type of mind that looks upon a job which requires little skill
and practically no strength as enjoying any permanence, is a
singularly weak one, and is a source of weakness to the nation.
The unskilled labour market should be stirred up at frequent
intervals, and if women supplied the majority of workers in that
market the stirring up would be more or less automatic.</p>

<h3>THE FEMININE POINT OF VIEW.</h3>

<p class="first">THE minds of the majority of women are fixed
upon marriage, settlement, and domestic duties. Not two per cent,
of the young women who go to work regard their career as
permanent. It is rather the interregnum between school and
marriage, an awkward interregnum, where their boundless energy,
their youth, and their natural desire for a certain financial
independence urge them to energetic action.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, the average working life of a
woman&mdash;and by working life I mean that period in which she
is employed outside of her home&mdash;is about eight years. The
average working life of a man is about thirty. For this reason
alone there will always be a considerable shortage of woman
labour, if employers decide, as they must decide, in retaining
women in those posts for which the war has proved they are best
fitted.</p>

<p>The decision, as it happens, does not rest entirely with
employers. Woman herself has marked down the billets she can hold
as creditably and as adequately as her male competitor. It is all
to the good that she has arrived at such a decision, for without
her we might find ourselves faced with the alternative of
importing labour or restricting our output of manufactures.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1918-03-22"></a>THE MAN WHO SAVED THE EMPIRE</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Albury Banner and Wodonga Express</i>,<br>
NSW, Australia, 22 March 1918</h3>

<p class="first">IT is given to very few men to bear in history
the proud title of "Saviour of his Country." We might perhaps say
this of Sir Francis Drake, who, in the critical hour of his
country's fortune, aided by extraordinary climatic conditions,
destroyed the Armada and freed England from the ; greatest menace
which had ever confronted her. We might perhaps say the same of
Nelson in different circumstances, and by a degree of Wellington.
Yet we know behind the deeds of those great commanders, and
overlain with the story of the complete accomplishment, were
valorous acts of men unknown to history whose initiative and
genius made these national victories possible.</p>

<p>We sometimes ask wonderingly why the German did not win the
first year of the war, when he had all advantages of numbers and
equipment, when he had superior masses of artillery, and his army
was organised more perfectly than any army had been that ever
took the field. And even if we can find some explanation as to
why he failed on the Marne, it is yet difficult to understand why
he did not, with the powerful forces under his control, sweep
through Ypres and establish himself on the coast.</p>

<p>The explanation of his failure is to be found in the genius of
one man and the valour and splendid discipline of one battalion.
Many regiments of extraordinary bravery contributed to his
defeat. The old Army, and particularly the 1st and the 7th
Divisions, accomplished miracles; but there was one battalion of
Midlanders who struck at the crucial moment and whose success
turned what might have been a rout, and would have certainly been
a disaster, into a German defeat.</p>

<p>Who, then, was the man who saved England?</p>

<p>Some readers will remember an incident in the Boer War, which,
because it occurred at the outbreak of hostilities, will be
recalled when other and more significant actions have faded from
the memory. I was on my way to the Front in South Africa, when I
was handed at De Aar a newspaper telegraphic despatch describing
this singularly gallant little act. An armoured train operating
from Mafeking had gone out against the Boers and had got into
difficulties. I believe there was a derailment and things were
going badly for the devoted crew of the train, when a gallant
little party made a sortie from Mafeking under the leadership of
an officer named FitzClarence.</p>

<p>FitzClarence and his party of fifty men extricated the train
from its position, fought off the attacks of the enemy, and
brought the train in triumph to the beleaguered town.</p>

<p>It was this same FitzClarence who on October 31st, 1914,
commanded a battalion which was not in his brigade, not even in
his division, and employed it to such purpose that the German's
irresistible advance was checked and held.</p>

<p>On that date we were falling back under the superior pressure
of the enemy toward Ypres. On the very ground where Sir Douglas
Haig's gallant soldiers are now repaying the German with terrible
interest for all they suffered in 1914 the battered 1st and 7th
Divisions were holding up the attack of 80,000 picked troops of
the German army. They were astride of the Menin road.</p>

<p>The juncture of the 1st Division and the 7th was to the north
of that road and a little to the north of the village of
Gheluvelt, whilst on the right of the 7th Division was the 3rd
Cavalry Brigade. Against the latter, whose centre was the ridge
of Zandvoorde. the enemy directed the fiercest of his attacks,
and under a hail of fire which decimated the splendid Cavalry
regiments of the British Army our men were pressed back.</p>

<p>This retirement left the right of the 7th Division "in the
air." That is to say, there was a big gap of more than a mile
between the left of the broken cavalry and the right of the 7th,
and in consequence the 7th Division was compelled to bring back
and seek a junction with the cavalry. This left a very sharp
salient about Gheluvelt, and the enemy lost no time in taking
advantage of the situation which was created. Naturally he pushed
his heaviest attacks against the unsupported right of the 7th
Division, which was pressed back to the Klein Zillebeke ridge,
the 2nd Scots Fusiliers, which formed the left of the line, being
annihilated.</p>

<p>At the same time he sent a furious attack against Gheluvelt.
Reckless of death, the Germans units came wave after wave,
supported by an unprecedented artillery bombardment, and the line
before Gheluvelt was crushed. It was a case of "Save who can,"
and the remnants of the 1st Division began to straggle back,
leaving only the South Wales Borderers to hold the enemy in
check. It was a moment for a supreme decision, and the man who
could have made that decision was naturally the general officer
commanding the 1st Division, General Lomax.</p>

<p>By one of those terrible coincidences which occur in all
battles, and come even to human beings when luck is against them,
the disaster of the broken line was followed by yet another.
Lomax and his staff, standing at their headquarters and viewing
the distant battle, were destroyed by the bursting of a German
shell. Not only the general and his six staff officers were
killed, but General Munro, who commanded the 2nd Division, was
struck down, and remained unconscious for an hour.</p>

<p>So here we had this remarkably situation. We had been driven
out of Gheluvelt, our line was broken, a victorious enemy was
advancing with perilous rapidity in such a direction that he
could not fail to smash in between the armies of the north and
the armies of the south, and of the two men who could have
directed the operations one was dead and the other was
unconscious.</p>

<p>Let there be no mistaking this fact, that the loss of
Gheluvelt meant the loss of the French coast. The German would
have been established at Calais, and the raids which we are now
experiencing would have been of daily occurrence throughout 1915
and 1916. The whole of the Belgian army would have been cut off
and captured. The 1st Corps and the 2nd Corps could not possibly
have extricated themselves and if the German had gone another
mile the British Expeditionary Force would have been practically
wiped out of existence.</p>

<p>And then a miracle happened. Marshal French and Sir Douglas
Haig, hurrying to the scene of the battle, knowing no more than
that the worst that could possibly happen was a fact and that
Gheluvelt, "an extremely important strategic point, had been
taken by the enemy," prepared, as I say, for the most momentous,
the most terrible disaster that had ever overtaken a British
Army, were thunderstruck by the receipt of the news that the
German rush had been stopped, and that Gheluvelt had been retaken
by the British. One does not doubt that Field Marshal Viscount
French could not believe the good news; and yet it was true,</p>

<p>FitzClarence was the Brigadier-General commanding the lst
Guards' Brigade. He had watched the disaster near at hand, and
had seen his splendid forces ovewhelmed, and then he had sent in
his last reserves, though he must have thought that it was
humanly impossible to save the day. And when his last reserves
had gone he mounted his horse and rode calmly up toward Gheluvelt
to share the fate of his brigade.</p>

<p>He was a man who knew no fear. He wore the Victoria Cross,
which he had earned three times over in South Africa; but with
his fearlessness he had the intuition of a great commander.</p>

<p>He discovered before he had gone far that there was another
battalion waiting in reserve to the south of Polygon Wood. This
was the 2nd Battalion of the Worcestershire Regiment. It was not
in his brigade, and technically he had no right to issue any
orders without consulting the Brigadier.</p>

<p>He sent for the commanding officer, Colonel Hankey, and told
him what he intended doing. Colonel Hankey was naturally
reluctant. He was at the disposal of his own Brigadier, and it
might be that the division to which he was attached would require
the reserves which his battalion represented.</p>

<p>But he saluted and turned back to his battalion, and in a few
minutes the 2nd Worcestershire Regiment was marching forward
under a terrific cannonade and deploying so close to the enemy's
position that they left over a hundred men between their
deployment and their occupation of the first trench.</p>

<p>With a dash which had never been surpassed, with a
steadfastness beyond all praise, the Worcestershires went forward
in the face of death, and carried with their bayonets the
defences of the village, fighting from house to house in one of
the most bloody engagements of the war, and established
themselves on the ground whence the British Army had been
driven.</p>

<p>It was the most fateful counter-attack in the war, and it was
carried out by about 6OO men; but mark the consequence! The gap
was filled. The left of the 7th division came back to its
original position, and the breach which had existed between the
7th and the 1st was made good.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock that night we had recovered all the ground we
had lost in the morning, and the Kaiser, who himself was on the
battlefield and had come down in the firm belief that a road
would be made for him to Calais itself, went back to headquarters
a sick and disappointed man.</p>

<p>It is perhaps difficult to make the non-military reader
appreciate the significance of individual actions. There is
apparently no difference between the taking of one village and
the taking of another, and the consequence of our failure to hold
one seems fraught with no greater danger than our failure to hold
a village at some other part of the line. But because the British
are more of a military people than the German, I do not think
that you at home can fail to recognise what you owe to this man
and this battalion.</p>

<p>FitzClarence is dead. He fell like the hero he was and as he
would have himself desired, at the head of the 1st Irish Guards
days after he had saved the line and long days before a confused
public opinion could apportion him the praise which was his
due.</p>

<p>His name should be enshrined in every heart and in every home.
He should take his place with the greatest figures of the war:
with Smith-Dorrien, whose wonderful action at Le Cateau preserved
the British Expeditionary Force; with Haig, who saved us from
disaster at Festubert; with the great men of all ranks who have
cheerfully made the supreme sacrifice for Britain and her
people.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1919-11-03"></a>TO SOOTHE THE SAVAGE BREAST</h2>

<h3>MUSIC AS A CURE FOR INDUSTRIAL UNREST</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Wanganui Chronicle</i>, New Zealand,
November 3, 1919</h3>

<p class="first">DO not think that because the German failed to
understand British psychology that he is a bad psychologist.
Nobody has ever understood the British, or ever will. The truth
is that the German is a greater psychologist than any other race
in Europe, and he was certainly the first man to discover the
antidote to Bolshevism.</p>

<p>He knows better than any that the Spartacist derived his
strength, not from the millions which Lenin supplied, but from
the falling off in the supply of music, especially brass music.
To-day Berlin is infinitely more peaceful than Luton. Its beaten
people are calmer than the folks on the Clyde or the workers of
Coventry. The Berliner goes about his business, takes a shrewd,
clear view of the situation, and is working rapidly to rebuild
the shattered finances of the country, and he has come to sanity
because some genius suggested that Bolshevism was a disease which
was as effectively destroyed by music as most other diseases are
destroyed by sunshine.</p>

<h3>THE BUG OF BOLSHEVISM</h3>

<p class="first">THE bug of Bolshevism withers and dies under the
beneficent action of Tannhäuser, even if Tannhäuser be played in
ragtime. To-day Berlin simply blares. Every beer-garden, every
café has its band. There are bands at the street corners, and
bands in the park. The German trombone is blowing Bolshevism
across the Dwina, and if she can only keep pace with the demand,
and can train her bandsmen as quickly as we trained our soldiers,
she should have Europe at her feet before the end of the
year.</p>

<p>A month ago one of those precious Bolshie commissioners of
Moscow, who spend their time alternately in signing death
warrants and remitting their perquisites to relatives in Sweden,
announced with great pride that bourgeoisie bands were forbidden,
and that music was not the least hateful attribute of the
aristocracy.</p>

<p>Russia is well nigh bandless. Only the Cossacks retain their
jingling bells&mdash;and only the Cossacks have any kind of good
government. In Britain we are suffering from a brass band famine.
Yorkshire, which is one of the most truculent of the labour
centres, was once a model of industrial virtue, but those were
the days when Besses o' th' Barn was Yorkshire's pride, and when
brass band contests brought hundreds of thousands of rapt
visitors to the centres where these contests were held.</p>

<h3>MUSICAL WALES</h3>

<p class="first">WALES before the war was one of the most musical
countries in the world, and although an Eisteddfod of sorts is
still held, and bards are crowned, Wales is practically
musicless, with the result that it is even more discontented than
Yorkshire. All this may read fantastic, but there are the facts
beyond question or doubt. Where the band flourishes Bolshevism
dies; in the citadels of Bolshevism the B-flat cornet is not
heard.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, the imperative duty of the Government to
summon not the Labour leaders, but the band conductors to
conference. All our resources must be pressed into use and the
Salvation Army must play a real part in national
reconstruction.</p>

<p>A start might be made by engaging Sir Henry Wood's orchestra
to play in the House of Commons Gallery&mdash;their very harmony
would qualify them for a place in the Distinguished Strangers'
Gallery&mdash;and it should be the penalty of dullness that the
addresses of any honourable member lacking in the power of
oratory should coincide with a selection from one of the light
operas.</p>

<p>And what a triumphant finish to a premier's speech if it could
end on a chord or be followed by "Land Of Our Fathers"!.</p>

<h3>AN EMERGENCY BAND</h3>

<p class="first">THERE should be a band kept in readiness in
Whitehall, ready to dash away in motor-lorries to the scene of
any local agitation. If before the stone-throwing and the window-smashing began a syncopated orchestra could be rushed to the
spot, if only on the pretext of playing the mayor out of ihe back
door, what expense might be saved!</p>

<p>I am not mad when I suggest that every police station should
be equipped with a cornet or that no inspector should be
appointed to his rank until he had taken a course at Kneller
Hall.</p>

<p>The Germans have always known the political value of music;
Luther himself has described it as "the art of the prophets" and
"the only art that can calm the agitations of the soul." And did
not Shakespeare, that amazing seer, foresee exactly the present
condition of the British mind when he said:</p>

<p class="verse">
The man that hath no music in himself...<br>
Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils.</p>

<br>

<p>Congreve, yet another prophet, advocated the anti-Bolshevik
treatment when he told us that music had charms to soothe the
savage breast.</p>

<h3>A MINISTRY OF MUSIC</h3>

<p class="first">LET us have bands of music at every corner if
necessary. Let us even have a Ministry of Music with under-secretaries and armies of typists&mdash;but let us have
music.</p>

<p>In Hungary, where the fiddlers come from, there is such a
scarcity of violins that the instruments are practically
unprocurable. Do you wonder that Bela Kun usurped authority and
remained in control until a few weeks ago? That his hurried
departures coincided with the arrival of large consignments of
fiddles from Austria is more than likely.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1924-03-28"></a>THE SECRET OF THE MOAT FARM</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Great Stories of Real Life</i>, Part 2, George Newnes Ltd., London, 28 March 1924</h3>

<p class="first"><i>The plausible and sinister adventurer who,
for the love of gain and of an easy life, preys upon women, is a
familiar figure in the history of crime. Camille Holland was
fifty-six when Dougal captured her affections, and the unhappy
romance of a rich old maid led to her murder at this infamous
scoundrel's hands. The crime might have gone unpunished but for
one damning clue. It was a pair of shoes which brought Dougal to
the scaffold after the lapse of years.</i></p>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">AT the age of fifty-six a spinster may well be
resigned to an old maid's life. Into the life of Camille Cecille
Holland romance had not come, though it was inevitable that she
should possess her dreams. For she was a woman of imagination.
She scribbled sentimental little stories, and painted in water-colours sentimental little landscapes&mdash;mills and ponds and
green woodlands&mdash;pleasant, pretty scenes.</p>

<p>Camille Holland did not look her years: most people thought
she was forty. A certain refinement of face and trimness of
figure, an exquisite smallness of foot (her chief pride) lent to
her an attractiveness which is unusual in women who have passed
through many loveless years, "living in boxes," having no home
but the boarding-house and cheap hotels which she frequented, and
no human recreation but the vicarious acquaintanceships she
formed in her uneventful journeyings.</p>

<p>She could afford an occasional trip to the Continent; she
could afford, too, other occasional luxuries, for her aunt, with
whom she had lived many years at Highbury, had left her the
substantial fortune of £7,000, invested in stocks and shares,
which brought her from £300 to £400 a year. Amongst her
investments was £400 invested in George Newnes, Limited, which
shares were to play an important part in the detection of one of
the cruellest crimes of the century.</p>

<p>Living as she did, it was natural that she had few friends.
There was a nephew in Dulwich, who saw his aunt occasionally;
there was a broker to whom she was known, and a banker on whom
she sometimes called. Very few tradesmen knew her, because she
ran no accounts, buying in whatever town she happened to be, and
paying cash.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">IT was in the early days of the Boer War, when
military men had acquired the importance which war invariably
gives to them, that a smart-looking, bearded man called at the
boarding-house in Elgin Crescent, Bayswatcr, where Miss Holland
was in residence. He had evidently met Miss Holland, for he sent
up a card inscribed "Captain Dougal," and was immediately
received by the lady in her hostess's drawing-room. He appeared a
great friend; he came again and again, took the lady out for long
strolls in Hyde Park, and once they went to dinner and to a
theatre together.</p>

<p>The devotion of Captain Dougal must have brought to
realisation one of the romantic dreams of this spinster whom love
had passed by, and she warmed to his subtle flattery, his
courtesy and his obvious admiration. When, in his manly way, he
confessed to her that he was unhappily married and there could be
no legal culmination to their love, she was shocked, but did not
dismiss him. Life was passing swiftly for her, and she was
confronted with the alternatives of going down to oblivion
starved of love, or accepting from him the ugly substitute for
marriage.</p>

<p>There was undoubtedly a great struggle, sleepless nights of
heart-searching, before she surrendered the principles to which
she had held, and let go her most cherished faiths. But in the
end the surrender was complete. One afternoon she met him at
Victoria Station, and together they went to a little house at
Hassocks, near Brighton, the house having been rented for two
months by her imperious lover.</p>

<p>Dougal's earlier marriage, he said, had been a very unhappy
one.</p>

<p>"I need not have told you I was married at all," he said. "You
would never have discovered the fact. But I cannot and will not
deceive you, or treat you so badly as to marry you
bigamously."</p>

<p>His scruples, his fairness, his very misfortune, were
sufficient to endear him further to this infatuated woman of
fifty-six, who for the first time in her life was experiencing
the passion about which she had read and heard, and about which,
in her mild and ineffective way, she had written. And those first
months at Hassocks brought her a joy that fully compensated her
for the illegality of the union.</p>

<p>The adventure was at least no novelty to Samuel Herbert
Dougal, sometime quartermaster-sergeant of the Royal Engineers.
Nor was it the first time that he had described, in his soft
Irish tongue and in the most glowing colours, the happiness in
store for his victim. His very brogue, so attractive to the ears
of women, was an acquisition, for he had been born in the East
End of London, a neighbourhood which had grown a little too hot
for him at a very early age, and had made him accept the Army as
an alternative to prison.</p>

<p>In a very short time he had gained promotion, for he was a
remarkable draughtsman, and so clever with his pen that he earned
for himself amongst his comrades the name of Jim the Penman. From
his earliest days he had preyed on women, for he had been one of
those parasitical creatures to whom a sweetheart meant a source
of income.</p>

<p>At twenty-four he married, taking his wife with him when his
regiment was moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia. She died there, with
suspicious suddenness. Pleading that her death had upset him, he
was allowed a short furlough in England, and returned with a
second wife, a tall, young and good-looking woman, who tended his
children and seemed to be possessed of some means of her own, for
she had a quantity of jewellery. Nine weeks after arrival, she
also was seized with a sudden illness, and, like his first wife,
died and was buried within twenty-four hours, the death being
due, according to Dougal, to her having eaten poisonous oysters.
Under military regulations it was not necessary to register the
death in the town of Halifax, and beyond the fact that Dougal
seemed to be very unfortunate in the matter of his wives, no
notice was taken.</p>

<p>There was in Halifax at the time a girl who had been a friend
of both the Mrs. Dougals. Though no marriage ceremony occurred,
Dougal, by his very audacity, succeeded in imposing upon his
comrades to the extent of their accepting her as his wife, going
to the length of forging a marriage certificate, which, however,
did not deceive the officer commanding, whose signature was
necessary to secure her a free passage to England. This union was
a short one, and the man's brutality and callousness were such
that she decided to return to Canada.</p>

<p>"What excuse shall I offer my friends?" she asked tearfully.
To which he replied, with that cynicism which was part of the
man:</p>

<p>"Buy yourself a set of widows' weeds, and tell them that your
husband is dead."</p>

<p>Dougal left the Army with twenty-one years' service, the
possessor of that good conduct medal which is the scorn of most
military men, and some three shillings a day pension&mdash;an
amazing end to his military career, remembering that during his
period of service he served twelve months' imprisonment with hard
labour for forging a cheque in the name of Lord Wolseley,
Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in Ireland.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Canadian woman left than another girl was
installed in his home, only to flee in the middle of the night
from his violence.</p>

<p>He was successively steward of a Conservative club at Stroud
Green, manager of a smaller club at the seaside, and held
numberless other positions for a short length of time; invariably
his terms of employment ended abruptly, and as invariably the
cause had to do with his treatment of the women with whom he was
brought into contact.</p>

<p>First and foremost Dougal was a forger. He could imitate
handwriting with such remarkable fidelity that even those he
victimised hesitated to swear to the forgery.</p>

<p>When he met Miss Holland he had lost his youthful slimness;
the fair, curling moustache was touched with grey, and he had
added the pointed beard which lent him a certain sobriety of
appearance that so ill accorded with his character. He was a man
versed in the arts and wiles of wooing. The life at Hassocks was
a dream of happiness to his dupe, and her own nature and
predilections assisted him to the fulfilment of his plans.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that Dougal was a poisoner; the
circumstances attending the deaths of his first and second wife,
the callous conduct he displayed in those events, almost prove
his responsibility. But many years had elapsed since those
tragedies; at least two great poisoning cases had been tried in
the courts; and he must have learnt how dangerous it was, in so
law-abiding a country as England, to repeat the crimes of
Halifax.</p>

<p>Moreover, the death of Miss Holland could not in any way
benefit him, since he had no legal claim upon her. There is some
slight evidence that he tried to induce her to make a will in his
favour, but Miss Holland, despite her infatuation, displayed an
unusual acumen when the question of placing her signature to a
document arose.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">THE life at Hassocks, delightful as it was, was
not exactly the kind of life that the woman desired. She did not
want to rent a house; she wanted to settle down, to have a
permanent home of her own; and Dougal, to whom she expressed her
wishes, agreed with her. When she told him that she would like to
buy a farm, he instantly became an authority on farming. Nothing
would please him better than to live the simple, rustic life; and
accordingly they began a search for a suitable habitation, and
the columns of the newspapers were carefully perused.</p>

<p>Eventually a suitable property was found. This was Coldham
Farm, in the parish of Clavering in Essex, and negotiations were
begun with Messrs. Rutter, of Norfolk Street, Strand, for the
acquisition of the house and acreage. If the property had a
disadvantage, it was that it was remote and lonely, the nearest
village being Saffron Walden, and the equivalent to "town" the
town of Newport, a quaint and ancient place which all people who
motor from London to Newmarket pass through without giving it a
further thought.</p>

<p>The price of Coldham Farm was £1,550, and Dougal, who had
charge of all the arrangements, settled with Messrs. Rutter that
a conveyance should be made in his name. Miss Holland selling off
some of her stock in order to secure the money for the purchase.
One day she called with Dougal at Norfolk Street, and the
necessary documents were placed before her for her signature.
Instead of being perfectly satisfied with the arrangements as he
had made them, she read through the conveyance with a frown, and
shook her head.</p>

<p>"The property is conveyed to you," she said. "I don't like
that. It must be conveyed to me."</p>

<p>"It doesn't make any difference; it is only a matter of form,"
pleaded Dougal, who seemed to have made no secret of their
relationship, even to Rutter's clerk.</p>

<p>"If we are to be known as Mr. and Mrs. Dougal, how can you
have the conveyance in your maiden name? Everybody will know our
secret."</p>

<p>Apparently Miss Holland was superior to the malignant tongues
of gossip.</p>

<p>"It must be conveyed in my name," she said stubbornly, and,
despite all Dougal's protests, despite his private interview with
her, when he must have urged more intimate considerations, she
had her way. The conveyance was torn up, a fresh document was
prepared, and Coldham Farm was transferred to her.</p>

<p>The pair left Hassocks at the end of January, 1899, and took
lodgings at the house of a Mrs. Wiskens in Saffron Walden, where
they remained until April 22nd. Mrs. Wiskens, in addition to
letting lodgings, was a dressmaker, who had a small clientele,
and she added to the income she derived from "lets" by doing odd
dressmaking jobs, repairs, etc., incidentally serving Miss
Holland in this capacity.</p>

<p>Their life at Saffron Walden seems to have been a pleasant
time for Miss Holland. Dougal was still the attentive and devoted
"husband," and nobody in that respectable little town dreamt that
the formality of a marriage ceremony had been overlooked.</p>

<p>From time to time they drove over to their new home, the
purchase of which had not yet been completed, and Dougal
simulated a knowledge of farming which must have been very
comforting to the woman, who undoubtedly had her suspicions of
his ability to conduct even this small establishment.</p>

<p>It was a smallish house, surrounded by a moat, and, to the
romantic eye of the aged spinster, possessed many attractions. It
was she who decided to rename Coldham Farm, which became the
"Moat House Farm," the Post Office being notified of this
change.</p>

<p>They moved into Moat House Farm in April, soon after the
purchase was completed. The former owner of the farm left behind
him a small staff of labourers, cowmen, etc., which Dougal re-engaged for the work of the farm.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption">Front view of the lonely Moat House Farm.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Dougal purchased a horse and trap, threw himself with vigour
into his new work, devised changes, including the filling in of
certain parts of the moat; whilst Miss Holland, who did not
disguise her pride in her new possession, set about the
furnishing of the house, and brought from London a grand piano to
beguile the tedium of the long evenings. She was something of a
musician, just as she was something of an artist, and she may
well have looked forward to a life of serene happiness with the
man who had come so strangely into her life, and whose love had
changed every aspect of existence. It would have been remarkable
if Dougal, after his adventurous career, could be satisfied with
the humdrum of farming.</p>

<p>He might be amused and interested for a month or two, but
after that the restrictions, which the woman imposed, the
necessity for keeping up the pretence of devotion, and the
various petty annoyances which her shrewdness produced, must have
its effect. Change was vital to him&mdash;not necessarily change
of scene, but change of interest. No one woman could satisfy him,
and he took an unusual interest in the choice of the girl servant
that Miss Holland engaged.</p>

<p>This proved to be Florence Havies, who look up her situation
three weeks after the Dougals had gone into their new home. On
the very morning of her arrival Dougal came into the kitchen,
looked at the girl, and, finding her attractive, put his arm
around her waist and kissed her. The girl, to whom such
attentions were only alarming, complained immediately to her
mistress.</p>

<p>It was the first hint that Miss Holland had received of the
man's character, and when, trembling with hurt vanity, she
demanded an explanation, Dougal tried to laugh the matter
away.</p>

<p>"She is only a kid," he smiled; "you surely don't think I was
serious?"</p>

<p>Whether he succeeded in allaying the woman's suspicions is not
known, but he did not give her time to forget the incident. That
night, when Miss Holland was in bed and Dougal was supposed to be
in the kitchen downstairs, a terrified scream broke the silence,
and Miss Holland, jumping out of bed, made her way to the
servant's room, to find her in a condition bordering upon
hysteria. After a while the girl was calmed, and told her story.
She had been awakened by hearing Dougal at the door demanding
admission in an undertone. The door was bolted, but the man had
flung his weight against it and was on the point of bursting in
when the girl had screamed.</p>

<p>Bewildered, horrified by her discovery, Miss Holland went back
to her room, to find Dougal in bed and apparently asleep. She was
not deceived however. She charged him with his offence and
ordered him from the room, the girl sleeping with her that
night.</p>

<p>The scene that followed in the morning, when the man and the
outraged woman met, was one of intense bitterness. Throughout
breakfast she reproached him&mdash;reproaches which he bore with
extraordinary meekness. Either he had intended making a breach by
his act, or else he had utterly misjudged her complacence. At any
rate, he seemed startled by her vehemence and impressed by her
sincerity.</p>

<p>It is possible he had never met a woman of her type before,
and certainly he was a terrible experience to her. The discovery
shocked her, threw her for the moment off her balance and left no
definite view but one that the man must go. There was no question
of her taking her departure and leaving her property in his
hands; she had made it very clear to him, when the conveyance was
signed, that she was entirely devoid of that form of
quixoticism.</p>

<p>Dougal himself did nothing during that morning except wander
disconsolately about the farm. He was seen, with his hands in his
pockets, looking thoughtfully at the moat, at one of the half-filled trenches which served to drain the farmyard proper. His
attempt to make up the quarrel was the signal for a fresh
outburst, until she was so exhausted by the violence of her anger
that she sat down on the stairs and, covering her face with her
hands, gave herself up to a fit of passionate weeping. Thus
Florrie Havies saw Miss Holland and tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>The girl had not been idle. Realising that she could no longer
stay in the house with Dougal, she had written to her mother,
asking her to come and fetch her the next day; and, as she told
her mistress, she was looking forward anxiously to her parent's
arrival.</p>

<p>To the girl Miss Holland confided her sorrows and her
contrition for the folly which she had been led into committing.
At the moment she had no definite plan, except that Dougal must
leave the farm and that their relationship must be broken.</p>

<p>Dougal had no illusions on the subject, and throughout the day
was facing the prospect of returning to his precarious method of
living. All his plans had come undone; the prospect of an easy
life had vanished; his scheme for getting the farm into his own
hands had failed. He had no hold whatever on the woman except her
goodwill, which he had exhausted by his folly.</p>

<p>To a man of his avaricious nature the prospect of losing all
hope of handling his "wife's" money was maddening. It is certain
that he had already tried to induce her to make a will in his
favour, but his failure in this respect would not greatly have
troubled him, for an opportunity would arise, if he were given
sufficient time, either to forge such a will, or by some trick to
induce her to sign a document which would give him control of her
wealth after her death. His precipitate action and her resentment
destroyed his chance in this respect.</p>

<p>Camille Holland was not a young and inexperienced girl, to be
cajoled. She might be ignorant of lovers and their ways, but she
had a remarkably good idea of her rights, as she had already
shown him, and a reconciliation seemed beyond hope.</p>

<p>What passed between them in secret will never be known, but
from subsequent happenings it is certain that she agreed to allow
a period of grace, possibly a day or so, to find other quarters.
That she gave, or intended to give him, any monetary assistance
is doubtful; she neither communicated with her bankers, nor was
any cheque drawn in his favour.</p>

<p>Possibly his retention on the farm was a matter of expediency
so far as she was concerned. She had to go into Newport that
night to do some shopping, and she may have needed him to drive
her there. The fact that they subsequently left the farm together
does not prove that there was any reconciliation, but rather that
she was making use of him, as she herself was not able to
drive.</p>

<p>People living in the country did most of their shopping on
Fridays, and undoubtedly it was to visit Newport for that purpose
that Miss Holland dressed herself about half-past six on the
night of Friday, May 19th, and, going into the kitchen, asked her
servant if there was anything she required.</p>

<p>One of the theories offered was that she was taking Dougal to
the railway station and intended returning alone, but as she made
no statement to the girl, who would be mostly affected by this
action, the probability is that the more simple explanation is
the true one.</p>

<p>The girl went out and saw that Dougal had harnessed the horse
and was awaiting the arrival of his wife. She saw Miss Holland
get up by the man's side, and as he flicked his whip and the trap
drove over the moat bridge, she heard Miss Holland say:</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Florrie. I shall not be long."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<div align="center">

</div>

<br>

<p class="first">NOBODY else saw them depart. It was quite light,
and very unlikely that Dougal offered the woman any violence at
that moment. It is certain that the trap did not go into Newport,
and that Miss Holland did no shopping whatever. What is more
likely is that Dougal employed the drive, following unfrequented
roads, to secure from his mistress her forgiveness for his act,
and that his efforts were unsuccessful. It is probable that the
time occupied by his vain attempt to bring about a reconciliation
was such that it was too late to go into Newport, and that, at
her request, he drove her back to the farm.</p>

<p>At half-past eight Florrie Havies heard the sound of cart-wheels crossing the bridge, and a few minutes later Dougal came
into the kitchen. At half-past eight in the middle of May, before
the introduction of summertime, it would be almost dark. The girl
looked up apprehensively and, seeing him arrive alone, asked:</p>

<p>"Has Mrs. Dougal gone upstairs?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Dougal; "she has gone up to London by train. She
will be back to-night. I am going to fetch her."</p>

<p>On the face of it the story was palpably false, for there was
no train from Newport to London until one that left at eleven
o'clock in the evening, the previous one having departed a few
minutes after the pair left the farm together. This, however,
Florence Havies did not know, and she accepted the story, which
in all probability confirmed some statement Miss Holland had made
in the course of the day to the effect that she would consult her
solicitors or her nephew, or somebody whom she could trust, about
the terrible position in which she found herself.</p>

<p>What happened was that Dougal had returned to the farm half an
hour before he came into the kitchen, and, having induced Miss
Holland to descend, had shot her dead by means of a revolver
which he had placed just below the right ear, and had dropped the
body into one of the half-filled trenches he had made in his work
on the moat. It is certain that he did not bury her at once, and
that when he made his excuse for going out to meet her by a later
train, in reality he carried a spade to the spot and occupied the
time in filling in the ditch so that the remains of the
unfortunate woman were hidden from view.</p>

<p>Again he came back, to say that Mrs. Dougal had not arrived,
and probably would not be back until the midnight train, going
out again and continuing his dreadful work, before he returned,
at a quarter to one, with the news that she would not come that
night.</p>

<p>"You had better go to bed," he said, and the frightened girl
went up to her room, locked, bolted and barricaded the door as
well as she could with a few articles of furniture in the room,
and spent the night standing at the window, fully dressed,
starting at every sound.</p>

<p>She did not hear Dougal come upstairs, and, so far as she
could tell, he did not go to bed that night. As soon as the dull
dawn light appeared in the sky, Dougal had returned to the scene
of his crime, and by the light of day had searched for and
removed all suspicious traces of his deed, throwing more earth
into the trench and levelling it down so that the notice of the
farm labourers should not be attracted. "When the girl came down
early in the morning she was surprised to find that Dougal was in
the kitchen, and had already prepared his breakfast. He greeted
her with a cheerful smile.</p>

<p>"I have just had a letter from Mrs. Dougal," he said (a
surprising statement to make, considering the earliness of the
hour and the known fact that the post was not delivered until
eight o'clock). "She says she is going away for a short holiday,
and she will send another lady down."</p>

<p>The curious fact was that Dougal had indeed arranged for a
lady to come to the farm, for, some days previous to the
occurrence, he had written to his third wife, telling her to come
to Stanstead, a village in the neighbourhood, and had rented a
small cottage for her, where she took up her residence on the day
before the murder. This, however, is no proof that the murder was
long premeditated.</p>

<p>Dougal was now a landed proprietor, and thought he could
afford the luxury of another establishment, especially since the
rent of that establishment was no more than six shillings and
sixpence a week.</p>

<p>The knowledge that his wife was there added to the fact that
he knew the girl was leaving that same day, was seized upon by
him as a heaven-sent coincidence, for he guessed the girl would
talk, and the appearance of another woman at the farm would thus
be accounted for.</p>

<p>That same day Florence Havies' mother arrived and took her
daughter away, not without expressions of regret on the part of
Dougal that the girl should have so misrepresented his action,
his contention being that he had knocked at the door intending to
wind up a clock that was in the room!</p>

<p>The mentality of Dougal is not impressive. The crude lies he
told about the letter having arrived before it could possibly
have been delivered, the lie he told the girl's mother, no less
than the stupidity of making advances to a girl who was a perfect
stranger to him and who had previously repulsed him, speak very
little for his intelligence, though they point to the queer
egotism which is the peculiar possession of the professional
murderer.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the servant disappeared than a new Mrs. Dougal,
and this time the real Mrs. Dougal, arrived. He must have written
on the morning following the murder, telling her to come. In the
next four years the Moat Farm saw many mistresses. The real Mrs.
Dougal came and went; new and attractive servants arrived, and
became victims to the man's unscrupulous desire for novelty.
Amongst these were two sisters, one of whom became the mother of
his child.</p>

<p>His financial position was now assured; he had gained from
Miss Holland a very complete knowledge of her possessions; he
knew the name of her broker, and copies of their letters and of
all previous stock and share transactions were available.</p>

<p>Ten days after the murder the Piccadilly branch of the
National and Provincial Bank received a letter, written in the
third person, asking for a cheque-book. One was sent, addressed
to Miss Camille Holland, The Moat House, and on June 6th a letter
was received by the bank, enclosing a £25 cheque and asking for
payment in £5 notes. The bank sent the money on in the usual way,
but the manager, noticing some slight discrepancy in the
signature, asked that this demand should be confirmed. In reply
came a letter:</p>

<p>"The cheque for £25 to Dougal is quite correct. Owing to a
sprained hand there may have been some discrepancies in some of
my cheques lately signed."</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="first">DOUGAL now set himself the task of converting
Miss Holland's securities into cash, and her brokers, Messrs.
William Hart, received instructions to sell. It is probable that
she had sufficient money on her person or in the house at time of
her death to carry him on for a month or two, for it was not
until September that he instructed the brokers to sell stock to
the value of £940, which was duly paid into Miss Holland's
account. This was followed a month later by a smaller cash
payment, and a year later by a payment of £546. In addition to
these, on September 18th a letter purporting to be signed by
Camille C. Holland instructed the bank to forward certificates of
£500-worth of United Alkali shares and £400 of George Newnes'
Preference.</p>

<p>Dougal went about his work with extraordinary care. All the
monies that were paid on account of Miss Holland went into her
bank and remained in the current account until he withdrew it by
cheque in her name.</p>

<p>A year later, at the same time as he was instructing Hart, he
forwarded a request that the bank should send to Hart a number of
other shares for sale.</p>

<p>The skill with which the forgeries were executed may be
illustrated by the fact that when, three years later. Miss
Holland's nephew denounced a certain cheque as a forgery, he was
equally emphatic that other documents bearing her signature were
forgeries, though they were proved by the bank to have been
signed by Miss Holland herself on the bank premises.</p>

<p>Nor did Dougal stop short at forging cheques; whole letters in
her handwriting were sent to the brokers and bankers, the writing
so cleverly imitated that both the banker and the broker
concerned were satisfied that they were genuine. In all, Dougal
secured in this way nearly £6,000.</p>

<p>During the three years that followed the death of Camille
Holland nobody seemed to have had the slightest suspicion that
she had come to a violent end. Nor is this remarkable, for the
only person who knew of their relationship, the servant, Florence
Havies, had long since left the neighbourhood and had married,
whilst Miss Holland's only living relative, the nephew, was not
in the habit of receiving letters or any kind of communication
from his aunt. The house agent who had heard the little breeze
which followed Dougal's attempt to get the property transferred
to himself, had ceased to take any interest in Moat Farm after it
had been removed from his books as a saleable proposition.</p>

<p>Dougal's path was by no means a smooth one. He had to face
police-court proceedings brought by Kate Cranwell, the servant,
in regard to her child. In the early part of 1902 one of Dougal's
victims, who had been admitted into closer confidence than her
predecessors, was spurred by jealousy, and a desire to get even
with the man who had wronged her, to make a statement to the
police regarding Miss Holland's disappearance. She could not have
known the facts, and it is probable that Dougal, in an unguarded
moment, had boasted that he was enjoying the income of the dead
woman, and imagination had supplied the informer with a garbled
version of what had really happened.</p>

<p>It was at first believed that Miss Holland was alive, locked
up somewhere by Dougal, and forced from time to time to sign
cheques on his behalf. This at least was the theory of
Superintendent Pryke, in charge of the district, who called at
the farm and had a talk with Dougal. The latter, as usual, was
frankness itself.</p>

<p>"I know nothing about her, and have not seen or heard from her
since I took her and left her at Stanstead Station three years
ago. I drove her there with her luggage, consisting of two
boxes."</p>

<p>"But don't you know her relations or friends?" asked the
superintendent.</p>

<p>Dougal shook his head.</p>

<p>"She left nothing behind her in the house. We had a tiff, in
consequence of the servant telling her that I wanted to go into
the girl's room."</p>

<p>"Have you seen any papers bearing the name of Miss Holland, or
any letters addressed to her?" asked the superintendent.</p>

<p>"None," replied Dougal&mdash;a somewhat rash statement to
make, in view of the fact that letters had been continuously
delivered at the house addressed to Miss Camille Holland.</p>

<p>"It is said she is shut up in the house," said the
superintendent. "Will you let me have a look round?"</p>

<p>Dougal laughed and said:</p>

<p>"Certainly; go where you like."</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="first">THE superintendent made a very careful
inspection of the house, but found nothing, and returned to ask
if it was true that Dougal had given away some of Miss Holland's
clothes to his own wife and servant, and that they had had them
altered. He replied:</p>

<p>"I couldn't do that, because she left nothing behind her."</p>

<p>Dougal had an account at the Birkbeck Bank, and the day that
Superintendent Pryke saw him he drew out practically the whole of
his balance, £305. This fact was known through a shrewd inspector
(Marsden), who did not share the superintendent's complete faith
in Dougal's <i>bona fides</i>. Undoubtedly Superintendent Pryke
was gulled by the seeming frankness of the master of Moat Farm,
and his report was creditable to the man whom he had cross-examined.</p>

<p>Marsden began searching round for a relative, and presently
found the nephew, who was taken to see certain The cheques which
had been drawn and had been apparently signed by Miss Holland. He
declared them, without too close an inspection, to be forgeries.
This was all that Marsden required. He was satisfied that Camille
Holland had been done to death, but it was absolutely necessary
that he should have Dougal in safe keeping whilst he made a
leisurely examination of the property; and though the grounds for
the warrant were very slight, and, indeed, the evidence of the
nephew would have been absolutely worthless to secure a
conviction for forgery, the warrant was granted.</p>

<p>A cheque had been drawn by Dougal in Miss Holland's name, and
the bank had paid him the sum in £10 notes. These notes were
immediately stopped, and, as though he were knowingly playing
into the hands of the police, Dougal went to the Bank of England
to change the £10 notes into £5 notes, signed a false name on the
back of one, and was immediately arrested on a charge of
forgery.</p>

<p>Had no further charge followed, it is certain that Dougal
would not have been convicted, for the evidence against him was
of the flimsiest kind, and the fact that both the broker and the
banker were satisfied that the signatures were genuine would have
disposed of the prosecution's case.</p>

<p>But the arrest served its purpose: no sooner was Dougal in the
hands of the police than Scotland Yard descended upon the Moat
Farm and took possession.</p>

<p>Thereafter followed days and weeks of search which will not
readily be forgotten, either by the police or by those
journalists, like myself, whose duty held them to this bleak and
ugly spot. Week after week, Dougal, handcuffed and between
warders, was marched from the railway station to the little
courthouse at Saffron Walden to hear the scraps of evidence and
the invariable request for a remand. Week after week the police
probed and pried, dug up floors and examined outhouses, in the
vain hope of finding something which would solve the mystery of
Miss Holland's disappearance.</p>

<p>What complicated the search was the discovery in the first day
or two of a skull in one of the sheds. It had the appearance of
having been burnt, and at first it was thought that this was a
portion of the remains of the woman. But it afterwards transpired
that the skull had been at the farm when Miss Holland was still
alive.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that, though the general opinion amongst
the reporters present was that the body of the woman was in the
moat, and although it was also known that in the early days of
Dougal's occupation there were open trenches leading to the moat,
no attempt was made to investigate these "leaders" until every
other channel had been explored and every possible hiding-place
examined. The police were giving up the search in despair when
one of the journalists present said to the detective in
charge:</p>

<p>"Why don't you open one of these trenches that Dougal filled
up?"</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p class="caption">A corner of the moat at the Moat Farm.</p>
</div><br>

<p>The idea occurred simultaneously to Detective Inspector
Marsden, and a labourer was sent for with instructions to dig
steadily. His work had not proceeded far when his spade turned up
a boot. Very soon afterwards the body of Miss Holland was
exposed, and Dougal's secret was a secret no more.</p>

<p>With some difficulty the body was brought to ground level and
taken to a summerhouse. A jury was hastily summoned, and the
first sitting of the inquest was held in a great, stark barn on
the property.</p>

<p>Hither, heavily guarded, Dougal was brought, and the scene was
one which will long linger in the memory of the witnesses. The
old barn with its thatched roof was crumbling away with age and
neglect. The only light was that admitted by the door, which had
been swung back. Here, under the twisted beams and crooked
rafters, the court arranged itself as best it could, and Dougal,
led past the open grave of his victim, came into the gloom of
this queer coroner's court.</p>

<p>The work of the police, however, was not finished with their
terrible discovery. Was the body that of Camille Holland? The
face was unrecognisable; there were no peculiar marks by which
she could be identified. The rotten remnants of a dress might be
sworn to by Mrs. Wiskens of Saffron Walden, who had stitched some
braid upon it, but it was not sufficient evidence to convict
Dougal.</p>

<p>The dress was like thousands of other dresses; the hair shape,
the bustle, the various other wisps of clothing which were found
might have been worn by any other woman. All that was known was
that she had been a woman and that she was murdered, for there
was a bullet-hole in the skull, and the bullet itself was
discovered at the post-mortem examination.</p>

<p>Still, there was sufficient evidence to commit Dougal for
trial on the capital charge, and there was one witness, and one
witness alone, who could hang him. This was Mold, a bootmaker of
Edgware Road.</p>

<p>Miss Holland had patronised Mold regularly. Her feet were so
small (and they had been her great pride) that her boots had to
be specially made for her, and Mr. Mold had built a last and made
a number of pairs of boots of one pattern. They were half a size
smaller than she required, and were lined with lamb's-wool. Mold
invariably made these himself, working his initials with brass
tacks in the heels of each pair.</p>

<p>There might be in the world thousands of women with small
feet, thousands who wore tiny boots; there might be many who wore
tiny boots lined with lamb's-wool, as these were lined; but the
"M" in brass tacks found in the dead woman's heel was undoubtedly
Mold's work, and he only had one customer who wore shoes of this
kind, and that customer was Camille Holland.</p>

<p>Dougal's trial ran an extraordinary course. He stood up in the
quaint assize court at Chelmsford and received sentence of death
from the lips of Mr. Justice Wright, and on a bright July morning
he stood up again, this time to meet the executioner. For a
second he flinched, until somebody handed him a glass of brandy
and water, and he drank it down. Then, without a word, he
submitted to the strapping and paced the short distance to the
scaffold. There was a tense and deathly silence, broken by the
agitated voice of the chaplain.</p>

<p>"Dougal, are you guilty?"</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>Billington fingered the lever nervously and looked almost
imploringly at the pastor as though he were asking him not to
prolong the agony of the man on the drop.</p>

<p>"Dougal, are you guilty or not guilty?" asked the clergyman
again, and in a low but clear voice came the muffied reply:</p>

<p>"Guilty."</p>

<p>As he spoke the word Billington pulled the lever.</p>

  <br>

<p class="first">THE murders committed by criminals who have been
classified by criminologists as "Class D. Larcenists" make up a
very large percentage. It is possible, if one sits in a
magistrate's court throughout the year, to collect a list of
names which will be almost certain to produce at least one
murderer in the course of a generation.</p>

<p>A criminal of this type, however, now and then escapes
conviction. He may be wanted by the police, but the chastening
experience of prison life, which might possibly bring about a
reformation, has been denied to him. He has behind him an
embezzlement or two of a petty kind; he has probably been
associated with two or three shady methods of obtaining money by
false pretences; and to these offences may often be added affairs
of gallantry, and, if not a bigamous marriage, at least one
marriage and wife desertion.</p>

<p>There is no more dangerous criminal than a small larcenist who
has escaped the consequence of his offences, through, as he
believes, his own dexterity and skill. Having this good opinion
of himself, he progresses from crime to crime, until there comes
a moment when he finds no other escape from the consequences of
his meanness and folly than the destruction of a human life
which, as he believes, stands between himself and freedom. And so
confident is he in his own genius for evasion that he will plan
the most diabolical of crimes, perfectly satisfied in his mind
that the success which has attended the commission of minor
offences will not desert his efforts to evade the penalty of his
supreme villainy.</p>

<p>And the meaner the larcenist, the meaner the criminal, the
meaner the murder. The greater criminals, the Deemings and the
Chapmans, killed on the grand scale. The crimes of such small men
as Herbert John Bennett, some time a labourer at Woolwich
Arsenal, are attended by those evidences of low cunning which
enabled them to twist a way of escape out of their minor crimes,
but which were utterly inadequate to protect them when the more
complicated machinery of the law was set in movement, and the
brightest brains of Scotland Yard were concentrated against
them.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">BENNETT was a man possessed of a smattering of
education he received at one of the elementary schools, and he
had, moreover, even as a boy, an ambition to shine in a higher
stratum of society than that in which circumstances had placed
him. Such an ambition is commendable enough, and has brought many
a man from the gutter to the highest positions in the
land&mdash;always providing that the climber has less regard for
appearance than for the solid substance of his advancement.</p>

<p>Bennett, by no means intellectual, wished to appear rather
than to be; and at the age of sixteen he set himself the task of
supplying the deficiencies of his education. He had a mind for
dancing, and considered the possibility of being able to play the
piano with such skill that he might gain for himself an entry to
doors that were now closed to him.</p>

<p>His gropings toward gentility brought him into contact with a
young girl, whom he must have regarded as his social superior,
since she had many of the attainments which he lacked, and was
not only something of a musician, but sufficiently proficient to
give lessons on the piano. He was seventeen, she was two years
older, and he displayed toward her a devotion which was as
passionate as it was ephemeral. Young as he was, he could talk
impressively. He left her head reeling with magnificent
prospects; the scope of his ambition left her breathless; and
when he proposed, as eventually he did, she accepted him.
Bennett, despite his youth, was a tempestuous lover.</p>

<p>"He had very big ideas for one of his station. Sometimes he
would talk so grandly that even the people who knew him best
believed that he was on the point of receiving some exceptionally
good appointment, or was about to inherit enormous sums of
money." He had had his smaller adventures, and fate and an
excursion ticket had once carried him to his first view of the
sea&mdash;at Yarmouth.</p>

<p>At his then impressionable age, Yarmouth became the first and
only seaside place where happiness was to be found. The Cockney's
devotion to his first love in this respect is proverbial, and
there is little doubt that Yarmouth was, for Bennett, an
enchanted beach ever after, just as Hastings is to the writer,
and Brighton to so many hundreds.</p>

<p>The marriage to the music teacher was a hurried affair. They
appeared one morning before a London registrar, and were made man
and wife.</p>

<p>With marriage came dispointed illusionment for the girl. The
great schemes began to dissipate into thin air. The fine
appointment, which would have secured them "a detached house and
garden, and possibly some poultry at the back," did not happen.
Bennett made his living by a succession of little jobs, none of
which he retained for any time. He was a grocer's assistant, a
sort of shop-walker; odds and ends of jobs came his way; his
leaving was more or less hurried, and where there was money to be
handled, was accompanied by a suspicion, amounting in one or two
cases to a certainty, that, in his yearnings for gentility,
Bennett had cast overboard the principle that holds a man to
honesty.</p>

<p>He became a canvasser, selling sewing-machines, and his
plausibility and qualities of salesmanship earned him good
commission. There was some suggestion that not all the orders
were genuine, and a possibility that he sold some machines
outright and collected the money for them without accounting to
his employers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett had an aged grandmother, with whom the couple
were living. She had a small allowance, sufficient to keep her,
if not in comfort, at least beyond the fear of want. Her
possessions were few, but amongst them was a long silver chain
and a very old-fashioned watch, in which she took great pride,
and to which she attached such importance, though it was in truth
a very clumsy piece of jewellery, that she made one of those
informal, word-of-mouth wills, so common to people of her class,
by saying, "When I am gone, this is yours, my dear."</p>

<p>Eventually she died, and the chain passed to the girl. By that
time she was not greatly interested in chains or watches, and
even the death of her grandmother brought no very great increase
to a burden which was already more than she could bear.</p>

<p>The passionate youth she had married had developed into a
bullying, hectoring young man, who never ceased to find fault,
who cursed her openly and privately for ruining his life, and who
did not hesitate to beat her. A child had been born of the
marriage, and while it was coming she had been subjected to every
kind of indignity and ill-treatment.</p>

<p>So Bennett moved from job to job. His limited education
restricted his opportunities, and there was the additional
handicap that he had often to rely upon characters and references
which were obviously forged.</p>

<p>Of much that would be interesting about this period to the
criminologist, there is no trace. It is certain that Bennett was
engaged in some nefarious business, for he was changing cheques
for large sums, and had suddenly changed his name and became Mr.
Hood. In this name, he and his wife and baby left, somewhat
hurriedly, for South Africa; and it is certain that at the time
Bennett had sufficient money, not only to pay the fare out and
maintain himself in Cape Town, but also to pay the return fare
when, after a very short stay in Cape Town, he decided that South
Africa offered no opportunities to a man of his ability, and
returned.</p>

<p>Relationships between the Bennetts were now strained. The man
had grown tired of his early love, told her she was a millstone
about his neck, and attributed the passing of his dreams, the
non-fulfilment of the bright promises of his youth, to the
handicap of having to provide for her.</p>

<p>Their stay in Cape Town was a matter of days. The newness of
the life, or, as he described it, the exclusiveness of Colonial
society, irritated and frightened him, and they had scarcely
settled down in their lodgings before he was back in the Adderley
Street shipping office, arranging his passage back to
England.</p>

<p>Their return to London was followed by a separation. He had
managed to secure work in Woolwich, and, on the plea that the
lodgings they had taken at Bexley Heath were too far from his
work, he left his wife and came to live at Woolwich, where he
posed as a single man, visiting his wife very occasionally, and
doling out to her sufficient money to make both ends meet.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

</div>

<br>

<p>They had taken the lodgings at Bexley Heath in his own name,
but it was as Hood that he was best known in Woolwich; and here,
free from the encumbrance of his wife, he began to pay attentions
to an attractive young girl, Alice Meadows.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">ONCE more he assumed the role of ambitious young
man, with immense prospects, and behind him a fascinating
experience, for he could now talk of his foreign travels, could
speak almost with authority upon South Africa (at that moment a
centre of interest, for the Boer War was in progress), and from
his imagination could evolve stories of adventure, very
fascinating to a young girl who had spent most of her life within
the confines of London.</p>

<p>It is clear that Bennett was not depending entirely upon the
wages he earned at the Arsenal. He had some other source of
revenue, and the probability is that he ran one of his get-rich-quick schemes as a side-line.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1900, soon after Miss Meadows and he had
become acquainted, and he had met the Meadows family (impressing
them as a young man of singular attainments), the question of a
summer holiday was mooted, and what was more natural than that
the first place which occurred to him as a likely spot was
Yarmouth? At any rate, he wrote to a landlady in the place,
asking her if she could reserve rooms for himself and his
fiancée. The landlady, if she remembered him at all, was not
aware that he was married.</p>

<p>In any case, she had no accommodation at the moment, and
accordingly he reserved rooms at a little hotel, and went down
with his fiancée, travelling first class, and spent a week in
that delightful pleasure resort. They occupied separate rooms; he
was a model of decorum; and those who noticed the rather
undistinguished couple observed him as an attentive, considerate
young man, who could not do enough for his companion.</p>

<p>The holiday seems to have been of a fairly innocent character.
It gave them, however, an opportunity of discussing their future
and of fixing the date of their wedding. Bennett, as usual, had
great schemes which were on the verge of fruition, and the
prospect must indeed have been a very brilliant one to Alice
Meadows, who listened, open-mouthed, to the many inventions of
her lover, learnt that he was well connected and expected in a
very short time to inherit a fine property. Dazzled by his
convincing lies, she made preparations to leave the place where
she was employed as a domestic servant, and, with the assistance
of her family, began to get together the clothes and dainty
fripperies which are the especial possessions of a bride.</p>

<p>"A nicely behaved couple&mdash;I often saw them strolling
along the South Beach," said an observer. "They were a model of
what engaged people should be."</p>

<p>But alas for poor Alice Meadows! Her dreams were soon to
dissipate into thin air; the growing treasures of clothing she
was collecting were never to be worn for his pleasure; and the
grand future, so far as he was concerned, was to end dismally on
a gallows in Norwich Jail.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<div align="center">
<img src="2000631h-images/Yarmouth-04.gif"
alt="Illustration"

</div>
<br>

<p class="first">IT is the failing of all men who worship their
own reputations, that they must be thought well of at any costs
by the person who, for the moment, fills their eye. You may turn
the leaves of criminal history and find this queer, perverted
vanity showing in every other line. It of was the same with
Deeming, with Chapman, with Dougal, with Crippen; it is difficult
to find a case of murder where this distorted ego does not stand
out in the criminal's psychology.</p>

<p>I can recall only three cases, a notable example of which was
Smith, the brides-in-the-bath murderer, where this bloated sense
of self-importance did not permeate the story of his supreme
offence. There is no reason in the world why Bennett should not
have married the girl, committing bigamy and risking the
consequence of his misdemeanour. There was no reason why Crippen
should not have run away with Miss Le Neve, or why Deeming should
not have left his wife and children to the charity of his
relations. But this passion for making a new start, for wiping
out, as they believe, all that is past in one terrible act of
savagery, as expressed in sixty percent of murder cases, was too
strong for Herbert Bennett. In his muddled brain there was only
one way of establishing himself as a single man and justifying
all the lies he had told, and that was by removing the woman who
stood between him and a new life.</p>

<p>Probably he also found, at this stage, that the drag upon his
financial resources which this double life of his involved was
reaching the breaking point. He had spent money on holidays, he
had given Alice Meadows an engagement ring, and there came from
his wife at Bexley Heath a request for a seaside holiday, which
gave him the idea which was subsequently carried into effect.</p>

<p>He very seldom met his wife nowadays. His visits to Bexley
Heath were few and far between. Nevertheless, his allowance to
her enabled her to live without working too hard. She could
afford, for example, to send out a small quantity of her linen to
a neighbouring laundry.</p>

<p>Bennett does not seem to have been in any dire straits, or to
have called upon his wife for assistance to meet his bills. In
the course of their married life he had given her four or five
rings, and at no time had she been asked to part with these, so
the supposition that he had another source of income than his
wages at the Arsenal is strengthened; for obviously it would have
been impossible for him to have maintained two homes, and carried
on an expensive courtship, on his salary as a labourer.</p>

<p>But the end was in sight, and he determined to rid himself of
at least one expense; and when his wife mentioned in her letter a
wish for a holiday, he replied promptly, suggesting Yarmouth, and
giving her the address of the house where, only a month before,
he had applied for lodgings for his fiancée.</p>

<p>On this occasion Mrs. Rudrum (this was the landlady's name)
had a vacancy, and in the beginning of September Mrs. Bennett
went down to Yarmouth with her child and took up her residence in
Mrs. Rudrum's house. At her husband's request, however, she
changed her name, and it was as Mrs. Hood that she was known to
her landlady and the very few people who knew her by sight.</p>

<p>A reserved woman, who did not readily make friends, she seemed
to be completely satisfied with the companionship of her child.
The landlady observed: "The only thing that I noticed about her
was that she wore a long silver chain around her neck, and had an
old-fashioned watch. She was not the kind of woman that you would
notice very much. She was very fond of her little girl and had no
other thought than to keep her amused and happy."</p>

<p>One day, when she was strolling along the beach, a beach
photographer came to her, and by his professional blandishments
induced her to pose for a little tintype picture of herself and
the child, and she was all the more ready to agree to his
proposition because she had no picture of the little one. And so
the photograph was taken, and thereafter occupied a place of
honour in her tiny bedroom.</p>

<p>Who she was, and where she came from, nobody knew. Apparently
no preliminary letter had been written to the landlady, and until
she appeared at Mrs. Rudrum's, that lady had no idea she was
coming. She was uncommunicative, not inclined to gossip, was
typical perhaps of a large number of weekly trippers who visit
seaside places, in that she had no identity except as a summer
boarder.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rudrum was incurious. She did notice, however, that there
arrived one morning a letter contained in a bluish-grey envelope
and bearing the postmark of Woolwich. The contents of that letter
are unknown: the instructions it contained she carried to her
grave. But reconstructing the crime in the light of subsequent
knowledge, it may be supposed that Bennett wrote to his wife,
telling her that he would meet her on the Saturday night, giving
her a rendezvous, and in all probability telling her that there
was particular reason why he should not be seen in Yarmouth, and
also why she should not divulge the fact that he was arriving at
all. It is probable, too, that he told her to burn the letter, or
else to bring it with her and give it to him when they met; for
it is hardly likely that he would take the risk of so
incriminating a document being left about for the landlady to
see.</p>

<p>She was used to these furtive methods of his. A decent woman,
with a respectable life behind her, would not acquiesce in these
constant changes of name unless she knew, or believed, that her
man's safety depended upon the deception. It is certain,
moreover, that she must have been acquainted with his many
curious methods of making money, and that she might therefore be
dangerous to him if he deserted her.</p>

<p>Something of her complacence and her confidence is traceable
to this knowledge. The landlady did not see the letter again, nor
did she notice that it had been destroyed, so it is more likely
that Bennett insisted upon his wife bringing the letter with her,
in order that he could be sure it would fall into no other
hands.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="first">ON the Saturday night she put the child to bed,
dressed herself with unusual care, putting on the silver chain
and watch, and went out toward the front. She was seen by her
landlady walking up and down outside the Town Hall, a building
which is very near to the railway station, and it is certain that
this was the rendezvous and that she was waiting for the arrival
of the train which would bring Bennett from London.</p>

<br>

<img src="2000631h-images/Yarmouth-03.gif"
style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p>Coming down, as he did, with murder in his heart, and the
means of encompassing his wife's death in his pocket, and having
taken such extraordinary precautions against being associated
with the woman, it is almost staggering, yet typical of the
careless workings of the criminal mind, that he should not only
have met her before the Town Hall, in one of the busiest parts of
Yarmouth, but that he should have taken her to a small inn near
the quay, where they drank together, afterwards disappearing in
the direction of South Beach.</p>

<p>South Beach at that time was a wild, untended stretch of sand
and marram grass, to which courting couples instinctively bent
their way. There were innumerable hollows where the swains could
be sure of freedom from observation. One such hollow was occupied
that night by a man and a girl, who saw two figures come out of
the darkness and go into another depression near by. That they
were lovers the two observers, very much more interested in
themselves than their surroundings, accepted without
question.</p>

<p>Bennett, unaware that he had been seen, settled himself down,
with his wife at his side, his arm about her, words of love on
his lips, and in his hand a mohair boot-lace about nine inches
long, with which he intended to commit his hideous crime.</p>

<p>That the deed was done at the very moment when the woman, who
still loved him, might expect from him nothing but tenderness,
was proved when her body was found. The lovers near by heard a
woman's voice pleading for mercy, but thought that they were
skylarking and took no further notice. While he kissed his wife,
Bennett had twisted the lace about her neck, drawn it tight and
fastened it with a reef knot. She must have died within a few
minutes, whilst he pressed the struggling figure deeper into the
sand.</p>

<p>At midnight he appeared at the hotel, where he had stayed only
a week or so before with Alice Meadows.</p>

<p>His manner was nervous and excited. He told the hotel porter
that he had come down by the last train, and that he must leave
by the first train out of Yarmouth in the morning. There was no
appearance of a struggle; beyond a little agitation and his
trembling hands when he took a drink, there was little remarkable
in his appearance, and the porter very promptly forgot the
incident of the unexpected visitor, called him in the morning in
time to catch the seven o'clock train, and thereafter the matter
went out of his mind, the more so, as he thought of Bennett as a
young man newly-engaged and who was, as Bennett had told him on
his visit, about to be married to a very charming girl.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="first">SO far, we know the story of the murder. We are
acquainted not only with the identity but the character of the
murderer. We know the circumstances which led Mrs. Bennett to
adopt the name of Hood, and why she came to Yarmouth. We have to
consider now the problem which confronted the police force when,
on the Sunday morning, it was reported by an early morning bather
that the dead body of a woman was lying in the sands of South
Beach, a mohair lace tied tightly about her neck. Yarmouth was
still full of visitors, strangers to the town. It had its quota
of undesirables, male and female. The police knew that the South
Beach was infested, at certain hours of the night, with queer
people, also strangers to the town. When the body was removed to
the mortuary, and a brief examination had been made by local and
county detectives, there was nothing to reveal who she was, where
she had come from, what were the circumstances attending her
death.</p>

<p>Their first view was that she was some unfortunate creature
who had been maltreated by a chance acquaintance, one of those
half-mad murderers who skulk all the time, unsuspected, in our
midst. That was the view persisted in for a long time after the
jury had returned a verdict.</p>

<p>The first rift in the cloud of anonymity came when Mrs.
Rudrum, who had learnt of the murder from a neighbour, and who
knew that her lodger had not returned all night, came down to the
police station and made her report. She was shown the body, and
instantly identified her as Mrs. Hood. Could the landlady tell
the police whether any of her jewellery was missing? The rings
were still upon the woman's hands, but the silver chain and the
watch had gone.</p>

<p>"What silver chain was that?" asked the chief detective.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rudrum tried inadequately to describe the trinket, and
then remembered that in the dead woman's room was the little
photograph that had been taken on the beach. Accompanied by
police officers, she went back to the house, and a very thorough
search was made of the room. The photograph was taken away, and
every drawer ransacked, for by now the police had learnt of the
bluish-grey letter with the Woolwich postmark. But of this there
was no trace. Nor was there any other document or writing which
could throw the least light upon Mrs. Hood's identity, her
friends or her place of origin. The landlady knew nothing; her
lodger had "kept herself to herself, and told me none of her
business."</p>

<p>On some of the linen was a laundry mark&mdash;just a number,
599. And with these two most slender clues, a small tintype
picture showing, in microscopic proportions, a blurred chain, and
the 599 laundry mark, the police began their search. But at every
turn they were baffled. That Mrs. Hood had met a man outside the
Town Hall, and that she had been seen in a public-house with him,
only established the suspicion that the murderer was not a
chance-found acquaintance, that the woman had met him by
appointment, and that he came from somewhere outside of
Yarmouth.</p>

<p>The Woolwich postmark narrowed down the search only in so far
that every laundry in Woolwich was visited, the marks books
inspected, still without bringing the authorities any nearer to
their quarry. From time to time the inquest was adjourned, until,
after six weeks, it seemed that the case was at an end, and the
jury returned a verdict of "murder against some person or persons
unknown."</p>

<p>The photographs were circulated far and wide, but without
result for some time. Then, when the search seemed at an end
(though such searches are never at an end where the Metropolitan
police are concerned), a laundry manageress at Bexley Heath
recognised, from the photograph of the laundry mark, the
handiwork of her own establishment and, turning up the books, it
was discovered that Number 599 had been given to a Mrs.
Bennett.</p>

<p>The police were at that time systematically exploring every
channel that would identify the laundry mark with the murdered
woman, and detectives were instantly on the spot. The house in
which Mrs. Bennett had lived was visited and, without hesitation,
a woman who knew her identified, not only the photograph, but the
chain which she had been wearing.</p>

<p>At Yarmouth she had told Mrs. Rudrum that she was a widow. At
Bexley Heath she was known as a married woman, living apart from
her husband, and people who lived in the same house remembered
that she had frequently received letters which were enclosed in
the bluish-grey envelopes that had been described at
Yarmouth.</p>

<p>This was only the beginning of the new search. The police
might find the sender of the letter, might even discover, as they
suspected, that it was the husband of Mrs. Hood, and yet unearth
no more than a bereaved man, ignorant of his wife's whereabouts
and her fate. The investigations in Woolwich began all over
again, and finally Herbert Bennett was discovered at the
Arsenal.</p>

<p>Bennett had returned to town, and his first act was to meet
Alice Meadows in Hyde Park, and subsequently he gave her a number
of things belonging to his wife. These, however, did not include
the chain and the watch, which he took from his wife's dead body,
or, as is more probable, which she handed to him as they were
walking along the beach, or when they sat down in the hollow,
being afraid of losing something for which she had a personal
affection.</p>

<p>Long before any arrest was made, the detectives conducted an
inquiry into Bennett's movements. Having established beyond doubt
the fact that he was a married man, the further discovery that he
was courting another girl and that she was on the threshold of
marriage, strengthened the suspicion that Bennett was responsible
for the death of his wife.</p>

<p>The extraordinary rapidity with which the police work on such
occasions as these was facilitated by the fact that Bennett had
no idea he was under suspicion, although interrogations had been
made of Alice Meadows, his friends had been visited and
questioned, and Mrs. Bennett's relations had been seen by the
police.</p>

<p>During this period Bennett displayed a mild interest in the
Yarmouth murder. He had discussed the crime with his wife-to-be
and her sister, and had expressed his surprise that the police
had not been able to run the murderer to earth. He had even
advanced theories as to how the crime was committed and the
murderer escaped!</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<div align="center">
<img src="2000631h-images/Yarmouth-05.gif"

</div>
<br>

<p class="first">THEN, one day, when he might have thought that
the crime had blown over, and that the police were now interested
in something more promising, two detectives appeared and asked
him to accompany them to the police station, and here, to his
amazement and horror, he was charged with the murder of his
wife.</p>

<p>Bennett then did what so many men have done to tighten the
noose about their necks.</p>

<p>"Yarmouth?" he said indignantly. "Why, I have never been to
Yarmouth in my life!"</p>

<p>There are so many parallel instances of similar acts of
reckless stupidity that we can pass over his extraordinary folly
without comment. Not only had he been at Yarmouth, but the police
knew that he had been there with Alice Meadows. She herself made
no secret of her innocent holiday; and there was the staff at the
hotel at which he had stayed to prove the fact beyond any
question of doubt.</p>

<p>How slender are the clues on which a murderer's detection
hangs! A chance-taken picture made by a beach photographer; the
accidental decision of Mrs. Bennett to wear her chain on that
day&mdash;she did not wear it every day&mdash;was a link so
strong that the cleverest advocate of the day, Mr. Marshall Hall,
was not able to break it.</p>

<p>Even complete frankness could not have saved Bennett from the
scaffold. Had he admitted that he came secretly to see his wife
on the night of the murder, and that he left her the next day; if
he had admitted his duplicity and the projected act of bigamy; if
he had taken the police partly into his confidence; even then
that chain which was found in his portmanteau was the most
damning proof of his guilt. Without that silver trinket, Bennett
could not have been convicted, much less hanged. If, when he
found it in his pocket, he had thrown it into the fire, or
dropped it into the river, not even his suspicious conduct, his
denial of ever having been at Yarmouth, could have brought him to
the condemned cell.</p>

<p>But there were the two unchallengeable facts: the silver
chain, photographed on the woman two or three days before the
murder; the evidence of her landlady that, on the night she went
out to meet her husband, she was wearing that chain, and when she
was seen outside the Town Hall later in the evening she was still
wearing that chain; the absence of the chain from the body when
it was discovered; and its finding in his possession&mdash;these
were the unbreakable chains of proof which he could never shake
off. There is an old Spanish saying that every murderer carries
in his right hand the proof of his guilt, and never was this
proverb so exemplified as in the case of the Yarmouth murder.
What malignant imp induced him to take the chain at all, what
perversity allowed him to keep it in his possession after the
murder was discovered, and long after the description of this
trinket had been circulated throughout the kingdom, we cannot
tell.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2000631h-images/Yarmouth-06.gif"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>"If the chain had not been found in Bennett's possession,"
said the greatest criminal authority of the day, "not only would
the most striking piece of evidence have been removed from the
prosecutor's brief, but there would have actually appeared a
point in favour of the prisoner! The disappearance of the chain
would have been adduced as a reasonable supposition that Mrs.
Bennett had been killed by an unknown lover for the sake of its
value."</p>

<p>So strong was popular feeling that, instead of being tried at
the Norwich Assizes, Bennett was removed to the Old Bailey, and
here, before the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Alverstone, he made his
acquaintance with a London jury. Thirty witnesses were
called&mdash;witnesses who spoke of Bennett's early married life,
of his visit to South Africa, of his ill-treatment of his young
wife, and his trip to Yarmouth. There was, of course, no evidence
as to any act of felony or misdemeanour which procured him large
sums of money from time to time, for the English law does not
allow such evidence to be taken when a man is on trial for his
life.</p>

<p>There were the hotel porter and the manager, who knew him and
had looked after him when he was at Yarmouth with his fiancée.
There were the people who saw him in the bar of the little inn
near the quay. There was the landlady, and, most distressing of
all, the girl to whom he was engaged.</p>

<p>To a man of Bennett's temperament, this was the most
uncomfortable witness of all. "It was not the murder he had
committed but the lies he had told which upset him," said an
observer.</p>

<p>Time and time again we have seen a murderer display the most
poignant emotion, not at the recital of his crime, but at the
appearance in the witness-box of some person whose opinion he
valued, and before whom he must now appear in the light of a
boaster and liar.</p>

<p>If it is possible for such a man to possess affection which
could be truthfully described as genuine, Bennett had found, in
this newest of friends, the love of his life. He had been
introduced to her family and had impressed them with his genius
and his extraordinary knowledge of affairs. A man of perfect
manners, he had impressed that least impressionable of persons,
his future wife's sister.</p>

<p>When Alice Meadows stepped into the box, Bennett's eyes
dropped; it was the only period during the trial that he gave
evidence of his discomfort. Lower and lower sank his head as she
related, in that unimpassioned atmosphere, the foolish stories he
had told of his career, his prospects, his travels.</p>

<p>Bennett's imagination ran riot when his audience was a woman:
his gifts of invention were never so marked as in those
circumstances. He could listen without flinching to the record of
his horrible deed&mdash;more horrible than can be related in cold
print; he could watch with a detached interest the display of the
trinket which he had taken from his wife a few minutes before her
death, and could give his complete attention to the doctor's
evidence. To Bennett, that was the least of his embarrassment.
The real ordeal for him came when Alice Meadows exposed him as a
braggart and a liar.</p>

<p>In this Bennett was not exceptional: all who have attended the
trials of great criminals have witnessed a similar phenomenon.
Armstrong's averted gaze and discomfort when the evidence of
Madame X. was being taken, Crippen's agitation when reference was
made to his relationship with Miss Le Neve, Seddon's flushed face
when the purity of his freemasonry was called into
question&mdash;one could multiply such instances by a
hundred.</p>

<p>Throughout the trial Bennett's behaviour was exemplary.</p>

<p>The trial lasted six days, and at the end the jury required
only thirty-five minutes to make up their minds, and, returning
to the court, declared Bennett to be guilty of wilful murder. To
the very last the man protested his innocence. Even when the
judge assumed the black cap he showed neither fear nor any
departure from his attitude of a misjudged man.</p>

<p>The sentence of the court was that he should be taken hence,
and from thence to Norwich Jail, and that there he should be
hanged; and under a strong guard he returned over the familiar
route to Norwich&mdash;the route he had travelled with Alice
Meadow's on the way to their holiday; the route he had followed
when he was bound for Yarmouth with a cruel murder plan; now to
expiate his crime within a few miles of the cemetery where his
murdered wife was lying.</p>

<p>Here, on a chill day in March, he met his fate at the hands of
the common hangman. But the memory of Bennett will be perpetuated
for many years. His conviction will stand as a model of the
efficacy of circumstantial evidence. Here was a case where a man
committed a murder, and no weapon of any kind was traceable to
him&mdash;for the mohair lace with which this unfortunate woman
was strangled was not identified with one that had been in his
possession at any time. There was undoubtedly a motive, though it
might be urged that there was no immediate necessity for doing
away with his wife, and that he gained very little by his crime.
Even the laundry mark was only useful to the police in locating
the woman's ordinary place of residence. It was on the flimsy
links of an old-fashioned silver chain that the Crown depended to
prove that Bennett was the murderer. And most effectively did
they succeed.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1924-05-09"></a>HERBERT ARMSTRONG, POISONER</h2>

<h3>As published in <i>The Great Stories of Real Life</i>, Part 5, George Newnes Ltd., London, 9 May 1924</h3>

<p class="first"><i>THE crime of Herbert Armstrong, M.A., the
Welsh solicitor, who murdered his wife by administering arsenic,
was especially mean and contemptible. Love affairs entangled his
life and flattered his vanity, and it is probable that a hatred
of his dull and respectable existence in a tiny village was one
of the motives for his terrible deed. This story of Armstrong is
told by Mr. Edgar Wallace, who attended the trial, and on behalf
of a newspaper syndicate offered the convicted man £5,000 for his
confession&mdash;an offer which was refused.</i></p>

<p class="caption">Herbert Armstrong.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THE little village of Cusop, on the borders of
Herefordshire and Wales, is not graced by any very distinguished
or beautiful buildings, nor hereabouts is the stately lodge
entrance of any great country house. Indeed, one of the best of
the houses in the village (and this would have been pointed out
to you in the year 1920) is a somewhat plain dwelling known as
"Mayfield." It is such a residence as you might expect a country
gentleman of very limited income would occupy. It had its garden,
its pleasant approaches, and, within the somewhat cramped space
of "Mayfield," the apartments were more or less ordinary. There
was a drawing-room and a boudoir for the lady of the house, a
small room designated "the study," where the master might bring
his work home in the evening and pursue his investigations into
the troubles of his neighbours, without too great an interference
by the noise of the piano which his wife loved to strum.</p>

<p>Herbert Rowse Armstrong was a solicitor, and the war, which
had drawn this quiet, inoffensive-looking Little man into the
service of the Army, at the Armistice delivered him back to the
admiring village, and to his colleagues of Hay, a fully-fledged
Major, a rank he was loth to renounce. There are photographs
extant, and they were at the moment highly prized by their
grateful recipients, showing the Major mounted on a horse, a fine
figure of a soldier, and finer since his equestrian exercises did
not betray his lack of inches.</p>

<p>Major Armstrong had come to the village of Hay from
Devonshire, where, at Newton Abbot, he had practised his
profession, without securing for himself that success for which
his many qualifications seemed to fit him; for he was a Master of
Arts of the University of Cambridge, something of an authority
upon land tenure. And when, having married a wife, he transferred
himself to a new sphere of operations, it did not appear likely
that the little village of Hay, off the main track, away from
railway and arterial roads, would give him greater opportunities
of achieving success than he had enjoyed in the more populous
district of Newton Abbot.</p>

<p>There was in Hay at the time an elderly solicitor, whose
partner Armstrong became. The elderly solicitor had an elderly
wife, and it is a curious fact that, as soon as Armstrong had
settled himself down and learnt the ropes of the business, and
had become acquainted with the country gentry, his elderly
partner should have died with strange suddenness, to be followed
in a few days by his wife. The prosecution did not, at the trial
which followed, attempt to establish Armstrong's responsibility
for the death of his partner. There were very many reasons why
the Crown should concentrate upon the charges which were
eventually made against him, without risking the negative result
which might follow an attempt to prove further crimes against
this remarkable man.</p>

<p>Armstrong became a personage of some local importance when he
was appointed Clerk to the Justices of Hay, and in this capacity
he sat beneath the bench, advising them on points of law, a
kindly yet efficient man, somewhat severe on poachers and on
those who broke the law in a minor degree. As a solicitor, he
appeared from time to time at the various assize courts. The
queer little court-house at Hereford knew him; he had sat at the
horseshoe-shaped table before judges and had instructed counsel,
and, generally speaking, performed the duties peculiar to his
profession with judgment and skill.</p>

<p>In appearance he was a short but perfectly proportioned man.
He had a small, round head, covered with close-cropped, mouse-coloured hair, was small of hand and foot, and had a countenance
which was at once benignant and shrewd. His eyes were blue, set
deeply in his head and rather close together. The overhanging
brows were shaggy, and his prognathic jaw was hidden by a heavy
moustache.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">HERBERT ARMSTRONG was well-liked and trusted by
everybody with whom he was brought into contact. Cambridge
University had given him a finish which made him an acceptable
guest at the country houses in the neighbourhood, and although,
by reason of his being a stranger, he had the administration of
no great family fortune, he nevertheless built up with some
rapidity a practice which put him in a position of trust. On
behalf of his clients he bought, sold and negotiated for land,
had a finger in many sales and local flotations, and was looked
upon, not only as a safe man, but as a lawyer with a certain
social distinction.</p>

<p>His wife, Kathleen Mary, seems to have been of a somewhat
finicking disposition. She had rigid views on social behaviour,
exacted from her husband's friends the attention and courtesy
which were her right, and exercised, if the truth be told, a mild
form of domestic despotism which prohibited her husband smoking
in the house except in his own room.</p>

<p>She had her "afternoons," her select dinner parties, and the
etiquette which governs a small village was rigorously enforced.
A somewhat difficult woman, all the more so because she had a
little money of her own, some £2,500, and in all probability
refused to her husband those loans which, to men of his
character, come so easy to negotiate.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they were a happy family from the outsiders'
point of view. There were three children of the marriage, and
neighbours regarded the Armstrongs as united and good-living
people. They were regular attendants at the village church; Mr.
Armstrong, as he was in the early days, was seldom away from home
until the call of war took him to a South Coast town and
subsequently to France.</p>

<p>Mrs. Armstrong was a little inclined to melancholia. She was a
musician of exceptional ability, and would spend hours at her
piano, but there was no suggestion that her despondency was
caused by any act of her husband or by her knowledge of his
misconduct.</p>

<p>To Armstrong the war may have come in the nature of a pleasant
relief. It took him from his restricted activities to a larger
and wider world, pregnant with opportunity, to new faces, new
interests, and, incidentally, to new ambitions.</p>

<p>It was whilst he was quartered on the South Coast that he met
a lady who was subsequently to play a sensational part in his
life. Her name, well-known to the Press, has never been divulged
publicly, and I do not purpose deviating from the very charitable
attitude which the Press of the day adopted. It is no secret,
however, that Madame X was a middle-aged lady possessed of much
property, and with whom Armstrong became acquainted some time in
1918. He was an attentive friend, and there grew up between these
two people a friendship, which seems to have been wholly innocent
as far as the lady was concerned. She knew he had a wife "in
delicate health," and she formed the impression that his marriage
was an unhappy one.</p>

<p>Armstrong's behaviour seems to have been perfectly proper, and
the friendship, stimulated by exchanges of letters, developed
into a tacit understanding that, if the "delicate health" of
Armstrong's wife took a serious turn, the Major, after a decent
interval, would appear to claim the fulfilment of a promise which
was never actually asked and never given.</p>

<p>Doubtless this little, middle-aged man, with his iron-grey
moustache, was a dapper figure in uniform, well likely to raise a
flutter in the heart of a lady who had passed her fortieth year.
In course of time Armstrong was demobilised, came back to Hay,
and plunged into arrears of work, taking up the threads from his
assistant, and being welcomed on his first appearance as clerk to
the Hay Justices, with many encomiums on his public spirit and
courage.</p>

<p>Whatever appearance he might make to those who did not probe
too deeply beneath the surface, there is little doubt that
Armstrong was something of a profligate in a mean and sordid way.
It is not permissible to tell, at this early stage, the evidence
which the police unearthed of his amours; but undoubtedly, in the
argot of the village, he "carried on," though of this Mrs.
Armstrong was ignorant, as also was an elderly lady who lived
with the family, a Miss Emily Pearce, who was devoted equally to
the husband and the wife, and kept a maternal eye upon the
children.</p>

<p>Miss Pearce seems to have been everything from housekeeper to
nursery governess. She was the kind of family friend which is
almost indistinguishable from an upper servant.</p>

<p>Outside of his work, Armstrong had only one hobby, and that
was gardening. Though he employed an odd gardener, he himself
supervised the work, and helped mow the lawn, trim the rose
bushes, and generally assisted in beautifying his limited estate.
He made several purchases of weed-killer, and on two occasions
had bought a quantity of arsenic, both in its commercial and its
chemical form, for the purpose, as was claimed and as undoubtedly
was the fact, of destroying the weeds which flourished
exceedingly and had taken a new lease of life since his personal
supervision had been removed by the war. There is no suggestion
that the weed-killer was employed for any other purpose than that
for which it was purchased. Armstrong attacked the enemies of his
lawn with great vigour, and gradually brought his garden back to
the state in which he had left it.</p>

<p>He found something else on his return from the war. A new
solicitor had established himself in Hay, and was taking a fair
share of the work which country disputes and land conveyance
provide. This Mr. Martin was married to a lady who was the
daughter of the local chemist, and Armstrong must have known of
his existence before he put his uniform on, but at any rate, when
he did know, there was nothing unfriendly in his attitude.
Indeed, he seemed anxious to do all that lay in his power to make
the path of the new man as smooth as possible, and even went to
the trouble of securing for him a commissionership of oaths. In
this he was probably not altogether unselfish, for there was no
commissioner of oaths nearer than Hereford, and it frequently
happened that the remoteness of this official was an
embarrassment to Armstrong himself.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been his object (and it is not
inconceivable, even in an innocent man, that he should have
combined courtesy with profit), the Major was on the most
friendly terms with his younger rival, and assisted him to the
best of his ability whenever such assistance was needed. In
course of time, as was natural, they represented opposing
interests, one of which demanded from Armstrong the return of
certain monies which had been paid to him on account of property
in the sale of which he was interested.</p>

<p>Long before this happened, Armstrong was faced with a domestic
crisis. His wife had grown steadily more and more morose. Her
interests had become more self-centred. She was infinitely harder
to please than she had been, and exaggerated the most petty
irritations into events of tremendous importance. Amongst other
victims of her rigid code had been the unfortunate Mr. Martin,
who had been guilty of the unpardonable solecism of appearing at
one of her afternoon parties&mdash;in flannels! To call on Mrs.
Armstrong in flannels was an offence beyond forgiveness. Martin
was blacklisted, and became, from the poipt of view of this
woman, whose mind was obviously a little deranged, a social
outcast.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<div align="center">

</div>

<br>

<p class="first">SO acute was the form her malady took that
Armstrong consulted the family doctor, Dr. Hinks, and it was
decided, after taking a second opinion, that this unfortunate
lady should be transferred to a lunatic asylum in the
neighbourhood "for observation." She was admitted and examined by
the medical superintendent, who found her suffering from a mild
form of peripheral neuritis. Since it was not a case of mania,
and the symptoms were of a more or less elusive kind, she was
given a certain measure of freedom, though the doctor at Barnwood
Asylum, on the strength of certain delusions and incoherence of
speech, had accepted her as insane.</p>

<p>It was on September 22nd, 1920, that Mrs. Armstrong was
admitted to this institution, where she remained for four months.
During the period of her detention she wrote a number of very
sane and clearly expressed letters to her husband, in which she
begged him to bring her home for the sake of her children. There
is little question that to Mrs. Armstrong the children were a
first consideration.</p>

<p>Armstrong paid several visits to Barnwood, and, finding her
health had improved visibly, after Christmas he took steps to
have her removed to his house. She returned on January 25th,
1921, so much improved in health that both Armstrong and the
family doctor were delighted&mdash;at least, Armstrong "displayed
a great deal of satisfaction."</p>

<p>Evidently this development was not at all in accordance with
Armstrong's expectations. Whether the sharp attack of illness
which had left her with these delusions, that had subsequently
brought her to Barnwood, was the result of poison, is a matter
which can never be known with any certitude. In all probability
the man had already begun his "experimenting." He had in his
study a quarter of a pound of white arsenic, and one may assume
that the first illness of Mrs. Armstrong was due to the
administration of this deadly poison.</p>

<p>With her return to "Mayfield," his plans underwent a change.
She had made a will, leaving practically everything to himself,
and revoking an earlier will which made such a distribution of
her property that he would benefit to a very small extent. He was
in some financial difficulty, but the determining factor in his
action was Mrs. Armstrong's "difficulty." He was weary of her,
her primness, her rigid sense of propriety, her faculty for
making enemies.</p>

<p>Herbert Armstrong, in short, had grown sick and tired of
excessive respectability&mdash;and in his hatred of his cramped
and too well-ordered life you may well find the primary motive
for his terrible crime. It is extremely doubtful that the small
sum of money, some £2,000, which would pass into his keeping on
his wife's death, had anything to do with his determination to
get rid of her. This is a view which may be contested; but, as
one who followed the case very carefully from its beginning to
its tragic finish, that is the conclusion I formed, and that, I
believe, is also the view of eminent counsel engaged in the case
on either side. His wife had become an incubus, a daily trial to
him. He decided upon taking the step which was to lead him to the
gallows.</p>

<p>A week or so after her return from Barnwood, Mrs. Armstrong
was taken violently ill following a meal. The family doctor was
called in, and prescribed certain medicine. Mrs. Armstrong was
put to bed, a nurse was engaged, and she made a fairly good
recovery. There was no suspicion in the mind of the doctor that
his patient was suffering from arsenical poisoning. He thought
that it was a return of her old trouble, and treated her for
peripheral neuritis, being strengthened in his diagnosis by the
recovery which she made.</p>

<p>She was hardly well before a second attack followed. Armstrong
received from his magisterial colleagues the sympathy to which he
was entitled, and one of his friends sent him up some bottles of
champagne. This fact did not emerge at the trial, but it is
possible that the agent through which Mrs. Armstrong received the
dose of arsenic which ended fatally was champagne. Probably
Armstrong himself opened the bottle and gave his wife a glass.
Unfortunately, at the trial this point was never cleared up, by
reason of the fact that there was not one of the principal
witnesses for the Crown who could clearly remember who opened the
bottle and who gave its contents to this wretched woman. And so
there was no reference to champagne at all in the evidence which
was taken at the Hereford Assize Court.</p>

<p>This is a curious fact: that Armstrong was convicted without
any proof being put in that he administered with his own hands,
food or drink of any description whatsoever; and there were many,
cognisant of all the facts, who believed that this would be a
fatal bar to a conviction, and the foundation of the optimism
which was shown by the defence is also to be found in this
curious circumstance. Armstrong was eventually convicted, not
because he was proved to have given his wife poison, but because
he had accessibility and the opportunity for so administering it.
But for the haziness of witness's memories, on this point, the
conviction of the Major would have been a foregone
conclusion.</p>

<p>On the night before her death, when she was weak and exhausted
as the result of arsenic administered to her a day or two days
previously, Armstrong gave to his wife a glass of champagne in
which he had dropped five or six grains of this tasteless and
colourless alkaloid. She drank the wine, being refreshed by the
draught, and although she was weak, talked sanely and rationally
of her illness and of the house and its management. In the middle
of the night Dr. Hinks was sent for, and arrived to find her
<i>in extremis</i>. She died on the morning of February 22nd,
1921, and the doctor certified that she had succumbed to natural
causes.</p>

<p>The sympathy of the village and the countryside went out to
this lonely man, left with three small children; the funeral was
attended by every local notability, and the distress of the
bereaved widower at the graveside was commented upon.</p>

<p>Armstrong, in his quiet, self-repressive way, bore himself
manfully.</p>

<p>"In many ways I am glad that her sufferings are over," he told
a friend. "The best and truest wife has gone to the Great Beyond,
and I am left without a partner and without a friend."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">HE caused a large tomb-stone to be erected over
the grave, properly and tenderly inscribed, and it was placed in
such a position that every Sunday morning, when he and his
motherless children went up to the church, they passed the white
stone. Through the summer and the autumn that followed, a tribute
of flowers lay upon the sepulchre of the murdered woman. He
himself took the choicest roses to adorn the grave.</p>

<p>He was, he said, so run down by the tragedy that he sought
leave of absence and went abroad, having communicatcd with Madame
X that the trials of his sick wife were at a merciful end.</p>

<p>Armstrong's itinerary was a curious one, for he not only
visited Italy, but took a trip to Malta, for no especial reason
except that he had always been interested in that romantic
island.</p>

<p>On his return to "Mayfield," Madame X was invited to stay with
him, and there is a possibility that the advent of the lady who
was a potential Mrs. Armstrong caused a little heartburning in
certain quarters. Others may have considered that they had a
prior right to the fascinating Herbert Armstrong.</p>

<p>Armstrong docs not appear to have wasted very much of the
money which came to him from his wife's estate. That money was
practically intact at the moment of his arrest. But he does seem
to have drawn very heavily upon funds which were entrusted to him
to complete certain purchases of land. There arose a triangular
correspondence between himself, Martin the solicitor, and a land
agent living in Hereford. Perhaps "triangular" is hardly the
word, in so far as it implies that Martin was concerned with the
Hereford land agent. But certainly the negotiations which should
have been completed hung fire, and there came from Martin a
peremptory demand, on behalf of his client, that the money
deposited should be returned. What was the cause of dispute
between Martin and the land agent at Hereford has not transpired.
After a visit to Hay and on his return to Hereford, the land
agent died very suddenly.</p>

<p>One day Martin met Major Armstrong in the village, and
reminded him that he had not received a satisfactory reply to a
letter he had sent concerning the money and the property which
was the cause of the dispute concerning them. Armstrong smiled;
he had a quick, inscrutable smile that lit his face for a second
and died as instantly, leaving him expressionless.</p>

<p>"I think," he said, "there is a great deal too much letter-writing between us, and the best thing you can do is to come up
to tea with me and we will talk the matter over."</p>

<p>Mr. Martin, probably remembering the coldness of his reception
when first he put his foot across the threshold of "Mayfield,"
demurred to this suggestion, but eventually agreed. That
afternoon he went up to "Mayfield," was most graciously received
by Armstrong, who led him to the drawing-room, where a tea-table
had been laid. There was a cake-basket, one of those wicker
affairs which carry three tiers of cakes and bread and butter,
and, in this particular case, a plate of buttered scones. The tea
was poured out, Armstrong handed a cup to his visitor, and
chatted pleasantly, and a little ruefully, of his failure to meet
the demands of his legal friend, and then:</p>

<p>"Excuse fingers," said Armstrong, and handed a wedge of hot
buttered scone to his guest.</p>

<p>That scone had been sprinkled with the tasteless white powder
which had removed Mrs. Armstrong from the world.</p>

<p>Martin ate it to the last crumb, drank his tea, and, after a
more or less satisfactory talk, walked back to Hay, where he
lived with his wife.</p>

<p>It was not until he was taking his dinner that night that he
began to feel ill, and then so alarming were the symptoms that he
was put immediately to bed and Dr. Hinks was summoned.</p>

<p>Whatever Dr. Hinks's views were about this sickness, so
strangely resembling that which had preceded Mrs. Armstrong's
death, Martin's father-in-law, Davis the chemist, held a very
decided opinion. It was part of his duty as a pharmaceutical
chemist to understand, not only the properties, but the actions
of various poisons, and to know also something about their
antidotes. His son-in-law's sickness was obviously caused by
arsenic. He immediately conveyed his suspicions to Dr. Hinks, and
that practitioner accepted that possibility, an attitude which
undoubtedly saved Martin's life.</p>

<p>It is impossible for a leading man in a tiny village like Hay
to be taken seriously ill without the news becoming public
property; and when, a few days after Martin, very white and
shaky, had made a public appearance, he met Armstrong, the Major
was intensely sympathetic.</p>

<p>"You must have eaten something which disagreed with you," he
said (very truly), "and I have a feeling that you will have
another illness very similar."</p>

<p>Martin probably registered a silent vow that if he could help
it that second illness should not occur. He, with Dr. Hinks, had
sent a certain fluid to London for analysis, and when the
analyst's report came, showing a considerable trace of arsenic,
Scotland Yard was notified.</p>

<p>In the meantime there was another curious happening. Mr. and
Mrs. Martin received one day a box of chocolates, and, upon
eating one, Mrs. Martin was taken ill. The fact that these
chocolates, which contained arsenic, could not be traced to
Armstrong, resulted in that aspect of the man's villainous
activities being dropped at the trial.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="first">ARMSTRONG was growing desperate. He made another
futile attempt to induce Martin to pay a further visit, and, when
that failed, asked him up to his office for tea, an invitation
which was declined.</p>

<p>The mentality of such people as Major Armstrong is puzzling,
even to the expert psychologist. One supposes that they are mad,
that they are paranoiac in the sense that they have to an
excessive degree the delusion of their own infallibility.
Certainly Armstrong must have realised, from the repeated
refusals of Martin to deal with him, that he was under suspicion;
and a normally minded man, even though he were not a Master of
Arts and a clever lawyer, even if he had not the assistance of a
large experience in criminal cases, would have taken immediate
steps to remove every trace of his guilt and to cover himself
against the contingency of exposure. Armstrong went about his
work in the usual way; he was to be found in his place when the
local court assembled, exchanging smiles with the presiding
justices, who knew nothing whatever of the suspicion under which
their clerk lay, and assisting them to deal with the peccadilloes
of local wrongdoers. He was corresponding with Madame X, and at
the same time was conducting an illicit love affair, of which
evidence was plentiful in the village of Cusop.</p>

<p>Scotland Yard, having all the facts in its possession,
including the statement made by Dr. Hinks as to the symptoms of
Mrs. Armstrong, was necessarily compelled to act with the
greatest circumspection and caution. The man under suspicion was
not only a lawyer, who would be conversant with every move in the
criminal game, but he held a high position. It was impossible, in
this tiny village, to conduct such an inquiry as would have been
set on foot supposing the suspected man were living in London.
Even the advent of two strange men in the village would have set
tongues wagging, and Armstrong would have been warned that all
was not well; whilst, if those strangers were reported to be
inquiring about his movements, then the task of bringing him to
justice was rendered all the more difficult.</p>

<br>

<p>The officer in charge of the case was favoured by the fact
that the nights were long and dark. He and his assistant were in
the habit of arriving at Hay by motor-car long after the shops
had closed and the people had dispersed to their several homes,
pursuing their inquiries in secrecy and returning towards
midnight to their headquarters at Hereford. Martin was seen and
cross-examined, a statement taken of his visit to "Mayfield" and
the subsequent attempts of Armstrong to induce him to make a
further call: the chemist who supplied the arsenic displayed his
books; Dr. Hinks showed his case-book and gave particulars of
Mrs. Armstrong's illness; whilst one of the nurses who had looked
after that unfortunate lady up to her death was also interviewed,
under a pledge of secrecy.</p>

<p>On New Year's Eve, 1921, the police were in possession of
sufficient evidence to justify an arrest, not on a charge of
murder, but for the attempted murder of Martin. The Home Office
had been consulted, and permission to exhume the body of Mrs.
Armstrong had been tentatively given, to be followed later by the
actual order which only the Home Office authorities can issue,
and which was, in fact, issued once Armstrong was under lock and
key.</p>

<p>When he reached his office, that morning, he was followed into
the room by the two detectives in charge of the case. He must
have realised, as the cross-examination grew closer and closer
to Martin's illness, that he was more than under suspicion, but
he did not by any sign betray either his guilt or his
apprehension. He did, however, volunteer to make a written
statement, and was left alone to prepare this, an opportunity
which he could have put to good use if he had remembered that in
his pocket, amongst a number of old papers, was a small package
containing three grains of arsenic&mdash;a fatal dose!</p>

<p>But he was so confident in his own ability to hoodwink the
police, so satisfied that, occupying the position he did, no
charge could be brought against him without his receiving
sufficient warning, that he never dreamt that the open arrest
would be followed by a closer one. The normal course that would
have been taken, had he been under suspicion, was for an
application to be made to the local justices for his arrest, and
it is certain that he banked upon receiving this warning, never
dreaming that Scotland Yard would move independently of the
justices, and that the first intimation he would receive would be
the arrival of the detectives with a warrant granted by superior
authority.</p>

<p>He was dumbfounded to learn from the inspector in charge
(Crutchley) that he must consider himself in custody on a charge
of attempting to murder Martin by the administration of
arsenic.</p>

<p>"But you cannot do that," he protested. "The charge is
preposterous. Where is your warrant?"</p>

<p>The warrant was shown to him, and the discovery that it had
been issued some days previously must have come to him like the
knell of doom.</p>

<p>He was conducted to the local lock-up, which he had so often
visited and to which he had been instrumental in consigning so
many petty breakers of the law, and there he was searched, and
the tell-tale packet of arsenic found in his pocket. This act of
indiscretion on his part had been little short of madness. He
must have carried the arsenic in the hope of Martin accepting one
of those invitations which he had so frequently issued, never
dreaming that this damning proof of his villainy would go far to
hang him.</p>

<p>"What is this. Major Armstrong?" asked the inspector
sternly.</p>

<p>"That is arsenic." Armstrong's voice was cool, his nerve
unshaken.</p>

<p>"Why do you carry this arsenic in your pocket?"</p>

<p>"I use it to kill the dandelions on my lawn," he said, and
elaborated this story later.</p>

<p>From the little cell he heard the church bells of Hay ring in
the dawn of a New Year through which it was fated that he should
not live. In the morning he again appeared in the court he knew
so well, but this time a stranger sat at the clerk's place, and
the bewildered justices, in sorrow and consternation, gazed upon
their friend standing in the dock, wearing his British-warm
overcoat and smiling affably at the friends whom he recognised in
the court.</p>

<p>The position was an incredible one. The first few moments in
that tiny court-house were poignant in their tragedy. Armstrong
was committed on remand to Gloucester Prison. Again he was
brought up, formal evidence given, and again he was remanded. In
the meantime the police and the Home Office authorities had
exhumed the body of Mrs. Armstrong, and in a near-by cottage Sir
Bernard Spilsbury, the Home Office authority, performed his
gruesome task, removing the portions of the body which were to be
sent to the Government analyst.</p>

<p>Armstrong came up before the court one morning to learn that
there was a second charge against him, namely, that he did
feloniously murder Kathleen Mary Armstrong by administering
arsenic on or about the 21st day of February, 1921.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE court proceedings, and those at the
coroner's inquest which followed, will always be remembered by
the journalists who were present. The court was so tiny, and the
incursion of reporters so great, that the most extraordinary
methods were employed to cope with the situation. Tables were
extemporised from coffin-boards, and upon these the
representatives of the great London dailies wrote their accounts
of the proceedings.</p>

<p>It so happened that at the time of the preliminary inquiry,
the Assize Court was in session, and it seemed that the man would
be compelled to wait for six months before he was brought to the
bar of justice. But Mr. Justice Darling announced that he would
hold a special assize for the trial of Armstrong, and this was
formally opened on April 3rd, after the man had been committed on
both charges: that of the attempted murder of Martin, and of
killing his wife.</p>

<p>Armstrong's attitude throughout the preliminary inquiries had
been taciturn and confident. He had followed every scrap of the
evidence with the keenest interest, but had said little or
nothing, and I think was the most confident man in the court when
he was finally committed for trial, and knew that he was leaving
the neighbourhood in which he had lorded it so long, and where he
had lived for so many years in the odour of sanctity and the
approval of his fellows.</p>

<p>His vanity supported him, as it has done with so many
poisoners&mdash;for men who destroy life in this dreadful manner
are so satisfied that no evidence other than that which they
might offer themselves can be of value in securing a conviction,
that they are certain up to the very last that they can escape
the consequences of their ill-doing. There has never been, in the
history of poisoners, a single instance of a man confessing his
guilt.</p>

<p>Such was the public interest in the trial, and so serious a
view did the law authorities take of this case, that the
Attorney-General, Sir Ernest Pollock, now Master of the Rolls,
was sent down to conduct the prosecution, the defence being in
the hands of Sir Edward Curtis Bennett, a brilliant advocate who
had conducted the prosecution of all the spies caught in England
during the war.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">

<p><br>
On a cold day, with snow blowing through the open windows of
the court, Herbert Rowse Armstrong stepped lightly into the dock
and bowed to the thin-faced man in the judge's box. He was as
neatly dressed as ever&mdash;brown shoes, with fawn-coloured
spats, brown suit and brown tie perfectly harmonised. He had been
brought over by motor-car from Gloucester Gaol that morning, had
interviewed his counsel, and now, with an assurance which allowed
him to glance round the crowded court-house and nod to his
friends, he listened to the cold, dispassionate statement of his
crimes.</p>

<p>He was in a familiar setting: he knew most of the court
attendants by sight or name; in happier circumstances he had
exchanged views and words with the Clerk of the Assizes; the
Under-Sheriff was known to him personally; he had even appeared
to instruct counsel before the judge who was now to conduct the
trial. He sat back in his chair, his arms folded, a motionless
and intent figure, following the evidence of every witness, the
blue eyes seldom leaving their faces. Even at that hour he was
satisfied that the evidence which could be produced would be
insufficient to secure a conviction, either for murder or
attempted murder, and he expressed to the warders, who had to
bring him every day the long journey from Gloucester, his faith
that the case for the Crown was so ill-constructed that the trial
could not but end in his acquittal.</p>

<p>"If this case were tried in Scotland," he told them, "there
could be no question that 'Not proven' would be the verdict." Sir
Ernest Pollock put the case fairly and humanely against him, and
it was not until Armstrong himself went into the box that the
full weight of the law's remorseless effort began to tell against
him. In the witness-box Armstrong was a suave, easily smiling and
courteous gentleman. His soft, drawling voice, his easy manner,
his very frankness, told in his favour; nor did the cross-examination of the Attorney-General greatly shake the good
impression he made. But there was a man on the bench wise in the
ways of murderers, who saw the flaws in Armstrong's defence. When
Mr. Justice Darling folded his arms, and, leaning forward over
his desk, asked questions in that soft voice of his, the doom of
Herbert Rowse Armstrong was sealed. They were merciless
questions, not to be evaded nor to be answered obliquely.</p>

<p>Firm to the very last, Armstrong met the dread sentence of
the. court without any evidence of the emotion which must have
possessed him, and when the clerk of the court asked, in halting
tones:</p>

<p>"What have you to say that the court should not now give you
judgment to die according to law?"</p>

<p>Armstrong almost rapped out the word:</p>

<p>"Nothing!"</p>

<p>Though his guilt had been established on evidence which was
good and sufficient for the twelve men who tried him, he was not
without hope that, on certain misdirections, he would secure a
reversal of the verdict at the Court of Appeal. But this court,
which exercises its powers of revision very jealously, saw no
reason to interfere with the course of the law, and on May 31st,
on Derby Day, Armstrong met his fate.</p>

<p>During his period of incarceration in Gloucester Gaol he had
occupied the condemned cell, adjoining the execution shed, which
is, in fact, a converted cell opening into the apartment where
condemned men spend their last weeks of life. The disadvantage of
this arrangement is that almost every sound in the death chamber
can be heard in the condemned cell, and Armstrong, who knew
Gloucester Gaol&mdash;knew too the proximity of his cell to the
place of his dread end&mdash;must have been keyed up to the
slightest sound. It was necessary that the executioner should try
the trap, whilst Armstrong was at exercise. He arrived, however,
too late for this to be done overnight, and it was not till the
following morning that the drop was tested.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock Armstrong, who had been up an hour, was
invited by the warders to take a final walk in the exercise yard,
an experience unique for a man under sentence of death. The sky
was blue and cloudless, the morning warm and balmy, and he
strolled about in the limited space allotted to him, showing no
evidence of the terrible agony which must have been in his soul.
After nearly an hour's walk he was conducted back to the
condemned cell, where the minister of religion was already
waiting, and within a very short time he had paid the penalty for
his crime.</p>

<p>The Armstrong murder may become historic from the point of
view of the lawyer, since he was condemned on evidence which was
entirely and completely circumstantial. But, as Sir Ernest
Pollock pointed out at the trial, in a poison trial direct
evidence is practically impossible.</p>

<p>"In this case," said Sir Ernest, "we know that Mrs. Armstrong
died from arsenical poisoning. This body of evidence which will
be called before you will be directed piece by piece,
circumstance by circumstance, pointing to a conclusion that it
was the prisoner at the bar who killed his wife.</p>

<p>"She died from arsenical poisoning. Who had the means, who had
the opportunity in August and in February, who had the motive to
administer the poison?</p>

<p>"You find the means with the prisoner. You find the
opportunity&mdash;the one man who was at 'Mayfield' both in
August and in February. You find the motive in the will referred
to."</p>

<p>Though there was no proof of the administration of poison, and
the evidence of motive, as far as Mrs. Armstrong's fortune was
concerned, was perhaps the weakest that has ever been put against
any man on the capital charge, nevertheless, nobody who knew him,
and who was brought into close touch with his life, will doubt
that Armstrong was guilty.</p>

<p>Before Ellis pulled the bolt, the slight figure standing on
the drop said something that was indistinguishable. One present
thought that it was a confession of guilt&mdash;more likely it
was a last protest of innocence.</p>

<p>Armstrong had refused an offer of £5,000 which I had made to
him a few days before for a complete confession of his crime.</p>

    <p class="caption">Frederick Henry Seddon.</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <br>

<p class="first"><i>IN the long record of sinister and evil men
who make up the world's murderers, there are many duplications.
In a dozen cases one sees the same motive, the same dominant ego,
the same half-crazy reasoning, which induces otherwise sane
people to commit the acts which bring them to the gallows. The
unique criminal, unique in his method or in his circumstances,
occurs at long intervals. Murders induced by jealousy are many;
crimes based on vanity occur in considerable numbers. But seldom
do we find a case resembling, and never a case parallel with,
that of Frederick Henry Seddon, who, together with his wife, was
tried in March, 1912, for the murder of Eliza Mary
Barrow.</i></p>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">SEDDON was essentially a business-man, shrewd,
near, a little unimaginative. He was the type sometimes met with
in the train on the way to the City: a man of dogmatic opinions,
a little over-bearing, wholly intolerant of other people's
opinions. You could imagine Seddon holding rigid political views,
and regarding all who did not share them as being outside the
pale.</p>

<p>Generally he was accounted, by those who knew him best, as a
very excellent manager; a man who gave nothing away, and who was
credited with considerable possessions, which his thrift and his
gift for driving a hard bargain had accumulated for him.</p>

<p>Seddon lived in a good-sized house at Tollington Park, North
London, with his wife and five children. It was a fairly large
house and his own property (as he often boasted), and here he
carried on his profession of insurance agent, being
superintendent of that district and having under his charge a
number of collectors, who were kept very busy by their energetic
taskmaster. Seddon was certainly a man bound to get on. In the
interests of his business he worked day and night; he was
indefatigable in his search for new "lives," yet found time to
indulge in certain social amenities, and was an officer of a very
honourable society, where he was considerably respected.</p>

<p>That Seddon was a true Freemason in the real sense of the word
can be doubted. Men of his intelligence too often adopt Masonry
as a means to an end, believing that fellowship with so many of
the best intellects in a district gives them advantages in
business. Nevertheless, it was his ambition to rise to the
supreme heights of Masonry, and all his spare time was given to
the assiduous study of the craft and to fitting himself for
higher office than that which he at present held.</p>

<p>A mean, hectoring man, bombastic of speech, loud of voice,
that crushed all opposition, his business grew rapidly, but not
so fast as he could wish. The dominant passion of Seddon's life
was money. Not every miser is a recluse, who hides his bags of
gold in inaccessible places and shrinks from the society of his
fellow-men. There are some, who are to be met with in every
sphere of commercial activity, well-groomed misers who are not to
be suspected of their vice, and Seddon was one of these. He
worshipped money for money's sake. He never spent a farthing that
he could avoid. His household accounts were most minutely
examined day by day, and the money he doled out for household
expenses was the smallest sum he could in decency offer to his
unfortunate wife.</p>

<p>Seddon's dreams had a golden hue. The rich were very wonderful
in his eyes, and he would find his recreation in relating to his
friends his surprising knowledge of the wealth which was
possessed by the great figures of the financial world.</p>

<p>He had saved penny by penny, pound by pound, gradually piling
up his assets painfully and slowly. Never once had a large amount
come to him in one sum, and one of his bitterest complaints was
that he had no rich relations who were likely to die and leave
him a fortune. Not the least interesting item of the newspapers
was the paragraph which appears every day under the heading
"Latest Wills," and he would pore over this in the evenings.
Sometimes he would learn of a rich man or woman who had died
intestate, the money going to the Crown, and this would throw him
into a fury.</p>

<p>"All that money wasted! Thrown into the gutter! It is
criminal!"</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">THERE was in London, though of her existence
Seddon was ignorant for some time, a middle-aged woman who shared
Seddon's peculiar passion for money. She, however, had never had
to scrape and strive. She had been left a small fortune in the
shape of house property&mdash;at least it was a small fortune to
her&mdash;which brought her in £5 or £6 a week. She was as mean
as Seddon, parting with every penny with the greatest reluctance,
and worshipping money, even as he did, for money's sake.</p>

<p>It follows that she was a difficult tenant to any landlady who
gave her accommodation, and she shifted her lodgings very
frequently, taking with her the small boy whom she had adopted,
Ernie Grant.</p>

<p>In his restless search for people whom he could persuade to
take out insurance policies, Seddon came into contact with this
middle-aged spinster, Miss Eliza Barrow, and these two sharp-minded beings recognised in one another kindred souls. Seddon's
immediate interest in the woman was a purely business one, but he
had ever an eye to the main chance, and it had been his practice
to leave no avenue to fortune unexplored.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2000631h-images/Seddons-02.gif"

</div>

<br>

<p>"Friends should pay dividends," was one of his mottoes; and
there is little doubt, after he had discovered that Miss Barrow
was not a likely subject for insurance, that he turned over in
his mind a way by which this new acquaintance should "pay
dividends." Miss Barrow's complaint against landladies was
perennial. Her interest in life was confined by the walls of the
lodgings she had, and it may be imagined that they had not long
met before she was telling him of her various landladies'
enormities, the high cost of living, the peculations of lodging-house servants, and the difficulty of finding a home where these
causes for distress would be more or less non-existent.</p>

<p>Seddon was a quick thinker. He had a big house in Tollington
Park, and several of the upper rooms were unoccupied. This woman
could pay dividends in the shape of rent, and in many other ways
was a desirable tenant, for he had learnt of her house property
and her steady income, and there was no fear that she would come
to him on a Monday morning and bring excuses instead of money. So
Seddon patted the little boy on the head with easy benevolence,
and remembered his empty rooms.</p>

<p>"I think my rooms would suit you very well," he said. "We live
very quietly; you will be in the house of a successful business
man who may be able to help you from time to time in the matter
of advice, and I'll arrange it so that you live more cheaply with
me than you have been living heretofore."</p>

<p>The arrangement was most welcome to the woman, who was in the
throes of one of her periodical fits of resentment against her
landlady.</p>

<p>She had lived in many homes. Once she had stayed with her
cousin, Mr. Frank Ernest Vonderahe, but that arrangement had not
been satisfactory, and she had wandered off with her boy to yet
another lodging.</p>

<p>Life at Tollington Park was entirely to Miss Barrow's
satisfaction. She had the opportunity of talking business with
Seddon; he admitted her to his confidence, allowed her to be
present when he was handling the large sums of money which came
in from the collectors&mdash;a sight very precious to Miss
Barrow, who, in spite of her possessions, had probably not seen
so much gold before. And the knowledge that he was trusted with
such huge sums increased her confidence in him; so that she
brought her own financial difficulties to him (the cost of
repairs, tenants' demands and the like), and accepted his advice
on all matters concerning her estate.</p>

<p>The friendship grew to a stage probably beyond her
anticipations. Her confidence came to be a blind trust in his
integrity and prescience. It developed, as was subsequently
discovered, in her taking the rash step of purchasing an annuity
upon his advice.</p>

<p>It is certain that Frederick Henry Seddon saw in Eliza Barrow
a greater profit than the meagre sums he obtained by giving her
lodging. There was about him the additional flavour of deep
religious principles. Seddon had a reputation as a lay preacher
and public orator. He was fluent of speech, better educated than
most men of his class, and he could be, in his lighter moments, a
most entertaining and charming man. He charmed Eliza Barrow to
this end, that one day he induced her to sell her Indian stock
for £1,600, to get rid of her house property and to trust him
with the money. She was obviously confident, from his manner to
her adopted child, that the boy would lose nothing from being
left in Seddon's charge, for she made no provision whatever for
his future until a few days before her death.</p>

<p>Seddon had gone to work deliberately, with a set plan, and the
first part of his scheme having been brought to a successful
issue, nothing remained but to perpetrate the dreadful deed which
he may have contemplated from the very moment he had obtained
Miss Barrow's confidence.</p>

<p>Since no poisoner has ever confessed his method, it is only
possible to reconstruct the story of such a murder by an
understanding of the murderer's mentality, and by piecing
together such scraps of evidence as are available.</p>

<p>Seddon probably purchased a small quantity of arsenic in some
part of London in which he was unknown. But he was shrewd enough
to prepare, at the same time, a defence for himself. He purchased
a number of fly-papers&mdash;paper impregnated with arsenic,
which, when placed in a wet saucer, destroys any fly which lights
upon it&mdash;and several of these he placed in Miss Barrow's
bedroom.</p>

<p>He knew, for he had made a study of poison trials, that one of
the questions which decides the guilt or innocence of any person
accused of poisoning, is the accessibility of the poison: in
other words, whether it is possible, through accident or design,
for poison to be self-administered.</p>

<p>The only way that arsenic could be self-administered by a
demented or careless woman was to have strong solutions of
arsenic in her bedroom. He did not apparently realise that, in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred where a person is found
poisoned, the police look for a motive, and find one in a case
where a person who had the opportunity of administering the
poison directly benefits by the death.</p>

<p>"Seddon always thinks of everything," said an admiring
colleague. "That is why he has been so successful."</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Seddon thought of most of the possibilities, but
never dreamt that his cunning plan would be exposed.</p>

<p>In many ways Miss Barrow was most favourably placed from his
point of view. She had quarrelled with her relations, and those
very distant relations. She had no personal friends, and beyond
the Vonderahes, who came occasionally to see her, and were
received with marked coldness, no interfering individual who
would inquire too closely into her sudden demise.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">THE Seddon's family were on very good terms with
their lodger. Maggie Seddon and her mother did the cooking for
her. Seddon himself was seldom in her room. When she became ill,
only on one occasion did Seddon give Miss Barrow her medicine. A
doctor was called in, saw nothing suspicious, identified Miss
Barrow's symptoms with a natural derangement; and if he was
surprised when one day he was summoned to find the unfortunate
lady <i>in extremis</i>, it was one of those surprises which are
the normal experience of every medical practitioner, and he did
not hesitate to give a certificate stating that her death was due
to natural causes.</p>

title="Illustration">

<p>Three days before her death, Seddon persuaded Miss Barrow to
make a will leaving all that she possessed to Ernest and Hilda
Grant, appointing Seddon the sole executor. Again we see the
cleverness oi the move; for now Seddon had so arranged matters
that suspicion would be even more remote from himself. He had no
possible interest in her death (unless the secretly-arranged sale
of the annuity came to light), and such sums of money and
property which had been Miss Barrow's as would be left he might
use until the children came of age.</p>

<p>Miss Barrow died on the Thursday, and no sooner was the breath
out of her body than Seddon bustled off to interview an
undertaker, and arranged for the cheapest possible funeral. Not
only did he do this, but he made a gruesome bargain with the man
which gives us an interesting insight into his mastering desire
to save money at every opportunity. Seddon told the undertaker
that an old lady had died in his house, and it would have to be
an inexpensive funeral. He had found four pounds ten in the room,
he said, and that would not only have to defray the funeral
expenses, but find the fees due to the doctor. Thereupon the
undertaker bargained to carry out the funeral at an inclusive
price of three pounds seven and sixpence and allowed Seddon a
small commission on the transaction. Seddon had memorial cards
printed, with an appropriate verse of sorrow; he bought a
quantity of black-edged envelopes and paper, and wrote a number
of letters, which, however, were never delivered or posted.</p>

<p>No man could have taken greater precautions than did Seddon to
clear himself of any suspicion that he was implicated in the
death of this wretched lady. Miss Barrow died on the Thursday,
and on the Saturday was buried in a common grave, although there
was a family vault, about which Seddon could not have been
ignorant. He was, however, anxious to get the body underground
with the least possible delay, for, once buried, he knew that
there would be considerable difficulty in getting an
exhumation.</p>

<p>Although not on specially good terms, Miss Barrow had been in
the habit of calling on the Vonderahes, and the fact that she had
not appeared, and that they had seen nothing either of her or the
boy, was remarked upon by Mrs. Vonderahe.</p>

<p>"I can't understand why we have not seen Miss Barrow for so
long," she said to her husband. "Why don't you walk round to
Tollington Park and see how she is getting on?"</p>

<p>Ernest Vonderahe, who was not particularly interested in his
cousin, was nevertheless a dutiful relative, and on the Wednesday
evening strolled over to Tollington Park. The door was opened by
Seddon's general servant, Mary Chater, who stared at him
blankly.</p>

<p>"I've come to see how Miss Barrow is getting on. Is she
well?"</p>

<p>The girl gasped.</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard?" she demanded in amazement. "Miss Barrow
is dead and buried&mdash;didn't you know?"</p>

<p>Vonderahe could only stare at her.</p>

<p>"Dead and buried?" he said incredulously. "When did she
die?"</p>

<p>"Last Thursday."</p>

<p>"But this is only Wednesday!"</p>

<p>"She was buried on Saturday," said the maid.</p>

<p>"Can I see Mr. Seddon?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"He's out, and won't be back for an hour," she said.</p>

<p>Staggered by this startling news, Vonderahe went back and saw
his wife. At his suggestion, she dressed, and they went back
again to Tollington Park, arriving about nine o'clock in the
evening. This time they saw Maggie Seddon, the daughter, but
Seddon was not visible.</p>

<p>"Father has gone to the Finsbury Park Empire and won't be back
till very late," she said, and could give them little or no
information about Miss Barrow's illness, nor did they think it
worth while to question the child.</p>

<p>The Vonderahes went home and a family council was summoned,
consisting of Vonderahe and his brother, with their wives, and
they discussed the mysterious suddenness of Miss Barrow's illness
until far into the night, arriving at the decision that the two
women should interview Seddon the next morning and discover more
about the circumstances of the woman's death.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next morning the two wives went to Tollington
Park, and the door was again opened by Maggie Seddon. Apparently
they were expected, for they were shown immediately into the
dining-room. The visitors were kept for some time before the
insurance superintendent and his wife made their appearance. He
was his usual self, calm, confident, neatly dressed and in every
respect self-possessed. But his wife displayed the greatest
nervousness, and, throughout the interview which followed, was on
the point of breaking down.</p>

<img src="2000631h-images/Seddons-04.gif"
style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p>Seddon strode into the apartment, pulled out a watch (which
proved to be the property of the late Miss Barrow), looked at it
significantly, and remarked in a loud tone that he hadn't much
time to spare and he hoped that they would be brief. And then,
when his wife began to speak, he silenced her firmly but
kindly.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear, you're too much upset to be able to tell
anything," he said, and explained that his wife had been greatly
shocked by the death of the lodger and had not yet recovered.
"You sit there and don't upset yourself. I can tell these ladies
all they wish to know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Seddon may have had a suspicion that all was not well.
The manner of Miss Barrow's death, the haste of the funeral, may
have seemed to her suspicious things.</p>

<p>"Now," said Seddon briskly, "just tell me who you are, and
what relation you are to the deceased Miss Barrow" And, when he
was told, he handed them a copy of a letter written to Vonderahe,
which the latter had not received.</p>

<p>The letter was brief and to the effect that Miss Barrow was
dead. It invited them to the funeral which had taken place on the
previous Saturday. It added that, a few days before her death.
Miss Barrow had left a will in which she gave "what she died
possessed of" to Hilda and Ernest Grant, and appointed Seddon as
sole executor.</p>

<p>Apparently Seddon had everything prepared: the copy of the
letter, a funeral card, a copy of the will, and a large blank
envelope into which he put these documents and handed them to one
of the ladies present.</p>

<p>So far, in spite of the brusqueness of the man&mdash;his
callous indifference to the feelings of Miss Barrow's relatives
and the scarcely veiled antagonism he showed to these
inquirers&mdash;there was nothing suspicious beyond his manner;
and it is probable that, had Seddon been more conciliatory,
expressed a little more sorrow, and stage-managed that interview
a little more deftly, he might have escaped the consequence of
his villainy.</p>

<img src="2000631h-images/Seddons-05.gif"
style="margin-right:20%; float:right"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p>As it was, he again looked at his watch pointedly, and when
one of the ladies asked if he would see Mr. Ernest Vonderahe he
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I am a business man, and I think I've wasted quite enough
time on this matter," he said. "I really can't be bothered
answering questions put by inquisitive people."</p>

<p>These two ladies had gone to Tollington Park with the
misguided idea that, because of their relationship, they would be
asked to take possession of Miss Barrow's effects. If the will
were genuine, and her death had occurred under normal
circumstances, they could not, of course, touch a single article
without permission from the executor; and legally, Seddon's
position was unassailable.</p>

<p>But in their ignorance of the law, they expected to be given
certain of Miss Barrow's goods. Their real suspicions began when
they found that, justifiably, Seddon meant to retain in his
possession all the property the administration of which had been
specifically left to him. It was only when they found that they
were being sent empty-handed away from Tollington Park that they
began to regard Seddon's behaviour as suspicious; and his
ignorance of their psychology was responsible for his
undoing.</p>

<p>It was not till some weeks later, on October 0th, after many
family councils, that Mr. Ernest Vonderahe saw Seddon. The
insurance agent had gone to Southend for a holiday, feeling, he
said "a little under the weather." And that period gave Ernest
Vonderahe an opportunity of making closer inquiries into the
possessions of Miss Barrow when she died. He discovered something
about her investments; she was the landlady of a public-house
called the "Buck's Head," and the proprietress of a barber's shop
adjoining the public-house; had a considerable sum of money in
the bank, and at the time of her death had quite a large sum in
ready cash.</p>

<p>Whether the relatives of Miss Barrow were chiefly concerned
with the manner of her death, or whether they suffered under an
indignant sense of being robbed of that which was rightfully
theirs, we need not inquire. All the investigations which went on
were in the direction of ascertaining the exact amount of benefit
Seddon might have received from the woman's disappearance. It was
a very proper and natural line of investigation, to which no
exception could be taken. It is perfectly certain that, supposing
the will to be genuine&mdash;and this was not
disputed&mdash;whatever might be the result of their inquiries,
they themselves could not be benefited by a single penny through
the exposure of Seddon as a murderer.</p>

<p>The Vonderahes saw something of one of the "beneficiaries"
under the will. Little Ernie Grant came to see them, but was
invariably accompanied by one of Seddon's children, either the
girl or the boy, and the suspicions of the Vonderahes were
deepened, because they saw, in this chaperonage, an attempt to
prevent them questioning the child as to the manner of Miss
Barrow's death.</p>

<p>On Seddon's return from Southend, Vonderahe decided to call
upon him, and sent him a message to that effect. And the visitor
was accompanied by a friend "as witness." Seddon had no illusions
as to the antagonism of the deceased woman's cousin. He had heard
something more than the subterranean rumbling which was to
precede the cataclysm, and his line of preparation&mdash;to meet
the unspoken charges which he knew Vonderahe would have in
mind&mdash;took the shape of adopting towards his inquisitor a
lofty and high-handed manner, which had served him so
successfully in dealing with other disagreeable people in his
business.</p>

<p>Like all poisoners, Seddon was completely satisfied of his own
invincibility. He was as confident as Armstrong had been up to
the day of his death. He could even challenge still greater
antagonism by attempting to cow his inquisitive visitors into
submission to his point of view. Vonderahe and his friend were in
the parlour, cooling their heels, for twenty minutes before
Seddon and his wife came into the room.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">"MR. Frank Ernest Vonderahe?" asked Seddon, and,
when the relative had answered in the affirmative, Seddon spoke
to the second of the men, under the impression that Vonderahe's
companion was his brother.</p>

<p>Seddon was smoking a large cigar, and motioned his visitors to
chairs with a lordly air.</p>

<p>"Now what is all this about?" he asked. "You are under the
impression that some money is due to you from the estate of Miss
Barrow? The will is perfectly clear, and I don't see why I should
give you any further information. If your solicitor cares to see
my solicitor, all very well and good."</p>

<p>In spite of this high-handed proceeding, Ernest Vonderahe
began to question the man.</p>

<p>"Who is now the owner of the 'Buck's Head'?" he asked,
referring to one of the properties which had been Miss
Barrow's.</p>

<p>"I am," said Seddon quickly, "and the barber's shop next door
is also mine. I've bought the property&mdash;in fact, I am always
open to buy property if it shows any chance of a reasonable
return. This house is mine, and I have a number of other
properties. That is my private business: I buy and sell whenever
a bargain is offered."</p>

<p>The propriety of Seddon's purchasing properties of which he
was the executor for his own benefit, did not seem to have
occurred to either of the two men, and Ernest Vonderahe shifted
his inquiries to a complaint that his relative had been buried in
a common grave, when there was a handsome family vault at
Highgate available.</p>

<p>Seddon replied that he thought the vault was full up, though
this excuse might have been invented on the spur of the moment.
The "Buck's Head" and the barber's shop had, he declared, been
bought in the open market. It was his business to dispose of the
property, and as his bids were higher than any others, there was
nothing remarkable about it being knocked down to him. When they
pressed their inquiries, Seddon said (I am quoting the statement
of Ernest Vonderahe):</p>

<p>"That is for the proper authorities to find out. I am
perfectly willing to meet any solicitor. I am prepared to spend a
thousand pounds to prove that all I have done in regard to Miss
Barrow is perfectly in order."</p>

<p>Until this interview, according to the evidence which was
subsequently offered at the trial of Seddon, the inquiries and
the suspicions had been confined to the narrow circle of the
Vonderahes and their intimate friends. But after this point-blank
refusal of Seddon to discuss the affairs of the dead woman, and
when it seemed that no useful purpose would be served by further
interviews, the Vonderahes did what they should have done in the
first place&mdash;communicated their suspicions to the
police.</p>

<p>Such communications are not rare at Scotland Yard, and the
police authorities act with the greatest circumspection before
they take any drastic action to confirm the suspicions of
relatives. There are probably twenty complaints to every
exhumation; possibly the number is much larger. But the police,
in this case, had something else to work upon than the bald
suspicions of the Vonderahes. There was, in the first place, the
hasty burial, and, in the second, the fact that, as executor or
direct beneficiary, Seddon had obtained a number of effects which
were the property of the deceased woman and which were now under
his control. The doctor was interviewed by the police and,
strengthened by his evidence, the Home Office made an order for
the exhumation of the body.</p>

<p>These forces were at work all unknown to Seddon, who went
about his daily business, satisfied in his mind that, if he had
not allayed the doubts in the mind of Ernest Vonderahe, he had at
least so baffled him, by his bold challenge to put the matter
into his solicitor's hands, that no further trouble need be
anticipated.</p>

<p>Removed to the cemetery mortuary, the body was examined by
Drs. Wilcox and Spilsbury, now Sir William Wilcox and Sir Bernard
Spilsbury, the Home Office pathologists. Certain organs were
removed and forwarded for analysis, and the body was
reinterred.</p>

<p>It was a grim coincidence that Seddon's business took him to
St. Mary's Hospital at the time when Miss Barrow's remains were
undergoing chemical examination, and that he was shown over a
portion of the laboratory whilst that examination was in
progress!</p>

<p>The chemist's report to the Home Office was emphatic: a very
large quantity of arsenic had been found in the remains, and on
this report the Home Office ordered an inquest.</p>

<p>Seddon was working at his accounts one night, when his
daughter came to tell him that a policeman wanted to see him.</p>

<p>"A policeman?" said Seddon. "What does he want? Ask him to
come in."</p>

<p>The officer walked into the room, helmet in hand, and handed
him a paper.</p>

<p>"I am the coroner's officer," he said, "and this is a summons
for you to attend an inquest on the body of Eliza Barrow, which
will be held to-morrow."</p>

<p>Not a muscle of Seddon's face moved. Eliza Barrow! Until that
moment he had not known that an exhumation order had been made.
This was his first intimation that the net was closing round
him.</p>

<p>When the officer had departed, Seddon swept aside the work on
which he had been engaged, and sat down, coolly and calmly, to
work throughout the night, packing his wife and children off to
bed, whilst he prepared answers to such questions as might be put
to him.</p>

<p>The grey dawn of a November day found him haggard and drawn,
his table littered with papers covered with his clerkly writing.
He had prepared for every possible contingency; had an answer for
every question which might possibly be put to him; had checked
and compared answer with answer, so that his story should be
logical and convincing.</p>

<p>The inquest lasted for the greater part of a fortnight. And
now suspicion became certainty. Seddon's conduct, tested and
probed, did not react, as he had hoped, to his advantage. On
December 4th he was arrested on the charge of murdering Eliza
Barrow.</p>

<br>

<p class="caption">Facsimile: Letter written by Seddon in the<br>
luncheon interval just before the dismissal of his appeal.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>For more than a month, while he was nder arrest, his wife was
allowed her freedom. But as the law officers examined more
closely the evidence available, it was obvious that Scddon's wife
was also under suspicion; and, to the amazement and idignation of
the murderer, she was arrested on January 15th, 1912.</p>

<p>Seddon plied the detectives with questions as to the nature of
the poison, and as to whether it might not have been self-dministered. "It was not carbolic acid, was it?" he asked. "There
was some in her room. Have you found arsenic in the body?"</p>

<p>All Seddon's transactions with the deceased woman now came
into the light of day, and, incidentally, the motive for the
murder. Miss Barrow had converted a considerable amount of her
shares, of which she possessed some £1,600 worth, into cash, and
purchased from Seddon an annuity of some £155 per annum. Whilst
she lived, he had to pay her £3 5s. a week, and it was to save
this paltry sum, in the belief that she would live many years,
that Seddon had murdered her. The transaction in itself was not
unusual. Seddon, as an insurance superintendent, dealt in
annuities, but this time the transaction was carried out for his
own benefit. The will, therefore, leaving everything she
possessed to Ernie and Hilda Grant, was a hollow document which
meant nothing, since her only possessions at the time of her
death were the cash she had at her bank and her own personal
possessions.</p>

<p>The trial, which began at the Old Bailey in March, 1912,
before Mr. Justice Bucknill, excited general interest. The
Attorney-General, Sir Rufus Isaacs, now Viceroy of India,
appeared for the prosecution; Sir Marshall Hall, then Mr.
Marshall Hall, defended the man; whilst Mr. Rentoul, now Judge
Rentoul, defended Mrs. Seddon.</p>

<p>Throughout the trial, Seddon kept up that unemotional detached
attitude which he had shown from the very moment of his arrest.
Mrs. Seddon, on the other hand, was a sad and dejected figure.
She could indulge in none of the breezy exchanges which Seddon
had with his counsel, nor could she regard with equanimity a
visit to the witness-box, which Seddon welcomed rather than
otherwise.</p>

<img src="2000631h-images/Seddons-07.gif"
style="margin-right:20%; float:right"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p>Seddon depended upon the fact that no person had seen him
administer poison to the deceased woman. And this, as has already
been pointed out, is the basis of confidence in the case of every
man or woman charged with murder by poison. It was as though he
put into words the attitude of such men:</p>

<p>"I am willing to admit that the woman died of poison. I admit
that I benefited considerably by her death, but you cannot prove
that I gave her the poison. I may have brought food to her, and
unless the prosecution can, beyond all possible doubt, prove that
poison was in that food, and placed there by me, you must return
a verdict of Not Guilty."</p>

<p>Never in the history of criminal jurisprudence has there been
a case where a convicted poisoner has been detected in the act of
administering poison, either in food or otherwise. The poisoner
banks upon suspicion being equally attached to other persons than
himself, and thus securing the benefit of the doubt. Seddon's
confidence was fated to receive a terrible shock. After an hour's
deliberation the jury returned with a verdict of "Guilty" against
Seddon, and "Not Guilty" against Mrs. Seddon. Seddon bent over
and kissed his wife; in another minute they were separated, never
to see one another again except through the intervening bars.</p>

<p>The Clerk of Arraigns put the usual question: "What have you
to say that the Court should not give you judgment to die
according to law?" And then occurred the most dramatic and, to
many people in the court, the most painful incident of the trial.
Seddon stood stifily erect and began a long speech which declared
his innocence. He ended by making a Masonic sign which was
unmistakable to Mr. Justice Bucknill, himself a Freemason: "I
declare before the Great Architect of the Universe that I am not
guilty, my lord." The judge was visibly distressed, but,
recovering himself instantly, passed sentence of death, and
Seddon paid the penalty for his crime at Pentonville Gaol on
April 18th, 1912.</p>

<p class="first"><i>MAN'S fear of looking ridiculous in the eyes of women is the most potent motive for murder, says the writer, advancing one of the most original theories of crime that has yet been printed.</i></p>
<br>

<p class="first">THE public is alarmed, and justly alarmed, by the growth in recent years of what are popularly but erroneously known as sex murders. They point to case after case where men have murdered women, and women have been parties to murdering men, in order to cover up some illicit love affair which, if it were divulged in public, would cover the murderer with shame.</p>

<p>There has been a succession of these crimes, all having "sex features," and the public may be pardoned if it confuses such rare types of murder as that of poor little Vera Hoad, where the motive was probably the lust of some demented man, or such brutal crimes as the murder of the little typist, Irene Munro, on the Crumbles, with that type of offence which is being so constantly investigated in our criminal courts.</p>

<p><br>
ONLY one of these two instances was a sex crime in the truest sense of the word; the typist was in all probability murdered because she refused to hand over the money in her possession, and the criminals in this case were brutal, animal men, without one vestige of humanity in their spiritual and moral make-up.</p>

<p>The crimes which we have to consider, and which at the moment are exciting public concern, are the crimes which are not incited by an overwhelming sex emotion, but, curiously enough, by an intense desire on the part of the murderers to appear before their fellow-citizens in a good light!</p>

<p>"What will people say?" In these four words is discoverable the secret of the hideous sex murders which have been an almost regular feature of our lives during the past twenty years. In that question is to be found the motive of almost every beastly crime that has figured on the calendar.</p>

<p>It may even be discovered that the obloquy which might attach to the murderer for being seen with some disreputable woman, was the cause of that most awful of crimes, the murder of little Vera Hoad.</p>

<p><br>
PUBLICISTS and preachers are telling us that the cause of these sex murders is traceable to the Great War, and to the deadening of the moral sense.</p>

<p>They can trace such crimes to the growth of paganism, to the breaking down of family ties, to a thousand and one fantastic causes; but the truth is that the sex murder is immediately connected with the wave of Puritanism, the blatant hypocrisy and the stupid gentility of the mid-Victorian period.</p>

<p>Until seventy years ago, the crimes which are constantly appearing nowadays in the newspapers were practically unknown. The motive of 70 per cent, of murders was robbery or revenge.</p>

<p>I am excluding such cases as the Vera Hoad murder, which have occurred persistently throughout the ages.</p>

<p><br>
IT is not permissible to discuss the Byfleet tragedy, or deal with the crime of the Crumbles, at this stage. But one need not be guilty of an act of contempt to find scores of cases where the desire of man for woman, or woman for man, was accompanied by such an overwhelming terror of public opinion as resulted in the committal of the most hideous murders.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE Armstrong case will be fresh in the reader's mind. Here was a man, holding an eminent position in the county of Hereford, or just beyond its borders, who was married to a woman for whom he no longer cared, and who in truth had made his life a little bleak and narrowed his outlook to an intolerable extent.</p>

<p>He meets and falls in love with another woman, and his affection is returned. She would not dream of running away with him, and he is too respectable to suggest such a course. He must maintain his dignity at all costs; and so that everything shall be in order, and that convention shall not be outraged, he administers arsenic to his wife, and is free to marry again.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">CRIPPEN is a mild and inoffensive little man, who is married to a woman with whom he has very little in common. He falls in love with his secretary and assistant&mdash;what is easier than for them to run away together and start life in a new and a strange land?</p>

<p>But Crippen has a horror of scandal. He shrinks from incurring the sneers and censure of people who know and respect him. "What will they say?" is for ever present in his mind; and, sooner than incur the criticism which must necessarily follow his flight, he poisons his wife, cuts up her body into small pieces and buries it beneath the cellar floor.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE Southend murderer carries on with two sisters, the liaison being unknown to each other; and, as the result of this association, one of the girls gets into trouble. He himself is married, and the possibility of the scandal becoming public property weighs on him day and night. In order to hide his infamy, he kills the girl and leaves her in a ditch.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">DEEMING, one of the most brutal of murderers, was also one of the most vain. A married man with five children, he appears in a little Cheshire village as a single man, describes himself as an inspector of armies, and immediately becomes the centre of a throng of admirers, including a girl, to whom he proposes marriage.</p>

<p>And then his wife and five children appear upon the scene, and the exposure of his swank is imminent. The fear of what they would say, and the terror of ridicule, are so strong within him that he murders his wife and five children, and buries them beneath a cement flooring.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first"><i>MAN'S fear of looking ridiculous in the eyes of women is the most potent motive for murder.</i> Bennett, the Yarmouth murderer, cuts a dash with a girl whom he has promised to marry. He impresses her family, and is regarded by all his associates as a travelled gentleman with a great future. He puts off his marriage from time to time, and at last, in desperation lest his new-found friends should look down upon him, he strangles his wife in the most brutal circumstances, and the way is now clear for him to be respectable and respected.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">DOUGAL hesitates to commit bigamy with the middle-aged Miss Holland, "acts honourably" towards her, and experiences a glow of pride attendant upon his virtue. Yet, when he is threatened with exposure over a sordid and commonplace intrigue, murders his wife and buries her in a moat.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">BUT perhaps the most striking of these sex crimes was that which sent Mrs. Thompson and Bywaters to the scaffold. Here is an extraordinary instance of the horror which a certain type of mind holds for publicity.</p>

<p>This wretched young woman forms an attachment for a ship's steward, who is admitted to her house on terms of friendship with her husband. She is practically independent; she owns a little property, is a clever milliner and earns a good wage. Apparently she holds her husband in abhorrence, and looks forward to the day when she can be free of him.</p>

<p>And yet the gate is wide open for her. Unlike other women, who are dependent upon their husbands' allowance for their sustenance, she is free to come and go when she likes, in the assurance that the worst that can happen is an undefended divorce suit, which would not deserve one line in the local newspapers.</p>

<p>But the fear of "what they will say" lay heavily upon Mrs. Thompson. She could break her marriage vows, she could carry on a remarkable correspondence with this ship's steward, she could take every risk that a woman can take; and yet the possibility of being "shown up" filled her with dread. Mrs. Grundy must be propitiated&mdash;and the scaffold must receive its victims!</p>

<p><br>
YOU will find this perverted vanity behind every sex murder, indeed, behind the larger proportion of such crimes as have been committed in the past decade. The instances can be multiplied indefinitely; they will occur and recur, just so long as young people are taught that the supreme social penalty is the stricture of their fellows.</p>

<p><br>
ONE of the most alarming features of murderous crime&mdash;and I do not remember that attention has before been drawn to the fact&mdash;is that some five women are murdered to every man.</p>

<p>Nowadays we have almost taken it for granted that it is inevitable that, if a person is murdered, that person is a woman. The old crude chivalry which protected the women from murderous hands seems to be a thing of the past.</p>

<p>I take up a reference book at random&mdash;it covers the year 1923, a typical year. We had the murder of Irene Wilkins by Allaway, the murder of Mrs. Black by her husband, the murder of Mrs. Armstrong, the murder by Ronald True, the murder of Lady White by Jacoby, the murder of a woman in a lonely inn by Jack Hewitt, a farm boy, the murder of Mrs. Halliday by her husband, the murder of Ada Field by her lover, the murder of his wife by the blind ex-soldier, the destruction of his wife and child by the city metal-merchant, Harry Kaye, the murder of the bride at Market Deeping by a former admirer.</p>

<p>And against these we have the killing of a moneylender, the Thompson murder, and the killing of a man by another.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">"WHAT will people say" is the last thought in the crazy mind of almost every suicide. It is to escape the consequences of minor offences that most of the supreme crimes are committed. The desire to be thought well of can be more immoral than the most flagrant departure from the straight course.</p>

<br>

<p class="first"><i>In this article Mr. Edgar Wallace, the brilliant writer on criminology, points to what he regards as a grave flaw in our criminal procedure. The State attaches the highest importance to fair play in murder trials. It should take the argument presented here with skill into careful consideration.</i></p>

<br>

<p class="first">IT is impossible that any murderer, or man or woman charged with murder in this country can enjoy a fair trial. That statement is one that I feel sure will receive the endorsement of every judge and every eminent counsel engaged in the defence of people charged with the capital offence.</p>

<p>Our judges are the fairest and the most humane in the world, and although from time to time there are appeals based on "misdirection" this ground is more or less technical, and men like Sir Henry Curtis Bennett and Sir Edward Marshall Hall, who raise such points in the Court of Criminal Appeal, which is the place to which most murderers go to learn the date of their execution, do not believe for one moment that their clients have been maliciously or unfairly treated by the judge.</p>

<p>These great lawyers are usually handling last straws which they can scarcely hope will float their clients to safety or rescue them from the hangman's rope.</p>


<h3><i>THE DANGER OF PUBLICITY.</i></h3>

<div align="center">

alt="Illustration"

<p class="caption">Lord Hewart, Lord Chief Justice.</p>
</div>

<p class="first">THE unfairness of the murder trial is neither determined by the judges nor approved by them. They are as much victims of a system as are the unfortunate wretches who stand in the dock.</p>

<p>The theory of trial by jury is one about which much could be written both favourably and unfavourably. I can sum up my own view by saying that if I were a guilty man, I should prefer a jury, and if I were innocent I should wish to be tried by a judge without a jury. The law is, however, that guilty or innocent, a man charged with an indictable offence must face a jury. If his offence is a comparatively minor one, the jury come into the case ignorant of the charge, and the evidence which will be brought against him.</p>

<p>The case of an insignificant burglar or swindler does not excite very much attention in the police court. His commital for trial is dismissed in a line, even if it is mentioned at all in the newspapers and the jury go into the box with a perfectly open mind on the subject, and in a percentage of cases the man so charged is found "not guilty" and acquitted. The state of mind in which the jury present themselves for such a trial is a ideal psychological condition of mentality.</p>


<h3><i>SECRECY WITH THE LID OFF.</i></h3>

<p class="first">WHEN murder is the charge, this condition is assumed by the law, and every precaution is taken to prevent the minds of jurymen being influenced, or their views prejudiced. They are kept under the care of an officer of the court; they are not allowed to mingle with their fellows; they may not even receive private letters save by permission of the judge, lest the poison of "influence" be conveyed wittingly or unwittingly. They may not read newspapers for the same reason. They sleep under the jealous eye of the law, and when they take their recreation, it must be in some lonely spot beyond all danger of meeting the informed public.</p>

<p>What a farce and pretence! The judge knows, the counsel on both sides know, the very prisoner knows, that all these elaborate precautions that keep the mind of the jury untainted by prejudice is so much humbug. <i>Under our present system the jury goes into the court so completely acquainted with every fact in the case that they can learn nothing new!</i></p>

<h3><i>CONDEMNED BEFORE THEIR TRIAL.</i></h3>

<p class="first">THE jury that tried Armstrong had discussed the case before they were even called for jury service. In the extraordinary interview which was published with a juryman after the verdict, that fact was very clearly established.</p>

<p>The fate of Bywaters and Mrs. Thompson was decided before the jury was empanelled&mdash;the woman was condemned at every tea-table, and, to say that the jury did not go into court already convinced of the woman's guilt, is to say that they had no knowledge of all the circumstances.</p>

<p>I quote the Thompson and Armstrong murders because they illustrate my contention in the most illuminating fashion. <i>The jury went into court in both cases with a very complete knowledge of all the details of the crime, and with their minds biased against the prisoner at the bar by reason of their knowledge.</i></p>

<p>How came they to know? The answer is that in all cases that come before the supreme criminal tribunals the evidence of witnesses in the lower court is public property.</p>

<h3><i>OVERSTEPPING BOUNDS OF DECENCY.</i></h3>

<div align="center">
<img src="2000631h-images/1924-08-09-JohnBull-JusticeAvery.gif"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">Mr. Justice Avery, who tried Mahon.</p>
</div>

<p class="first">IN the case of a murder, and particularly a sensational murder, there has been a full report of the inquest, and full reports of the police court proceedings. Every particular of the crime has been discussed. Newspapers that enjoy circulations that reach every home have devoted their columns to the crime, and by the time the last act of the sordid drama is staged, public opinion is "set."</p>

<p>And the damnable thing is that in the lower courts evidence is admitted, which, if it is barred in the higher court, does its part in laying up against the accused a mass of suspicion and hate which cannot fail to produce its reactions on the minds of the jury. The Hay bench allowed evidence that so far from being a respectable member of society, Armstrong suffered from syphilis!</p>

<p>I think Sir Henry Curtis Bennett will agree with me when I say that that phase of the Armstrong enquiry was a disgrace to the bench. More than this, we know that there are certain coroners &mdash;I have one London coroner particularly in my mind&mdash;who ply witnesses with questions which have nothing whatever to do with the cause of death, and are either designed to show what a smart fellow this coroner is, or else are due to his own morbid curiosity. The more sensational the evidence thus  elicited, the more publicity the case secures the more surely bias runs against the accused man.</p>

<h3><i>OUR MEDIAEVAL PROCEDURE.</i></h3>

<p class="first">IN the interest of justice, when a man is In custody on a murder charge, all the proceedings in the lower courts (coroners and magistrates) should be held <i>in camera</i>. That is the only possible way by which the present method of trial for murder can be obviated.</p>

<p>Our present system of legal procedure was intended, or at any rate, took its present shape before the coming of popular education, and before modern newspaper organisations and news services ensured that every man and woman in this island were able to read at breakfast the fullest accounts of yesterday's happenings the night before.</p>

<p>And I believe that these same newspapers which benefit through increased circulation by the reports of preliminary hearings, would offer no objection, and, indeed, would support an amendment to the law which had the effect of suppressing published accounts of preliminary proceedings where a man's or a woman's life was at stake.</p>

<h3><i>WHEN FAIRNESS IS IMPOSSIBLE.</i></h3>

<p class="first">MRS. THOMPSON was condemned before she went into the dock at the Old Bailey&mdash;condemned by the letters she wrote, and which were used against her in the magistrate's court, and broadcast throughout the country, long before she ever came to trial.</p>

<p>I repeat that unless the evidence given in the coroner's and the magistrate's courts is given <i>in camera</i>, and that they are enquiries from which the public and the Press are excluded, no murderer can possibly expect to be fairly tried. He goes before twelve men who, with the best intentions in the world, have subconsciously decided his guilt or innocence.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1924-11-01"></a>THE MIND OF THE RACE-HORSE</h2>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2000631h-images/TheMindOfTheRaceHorse-00.png"

title="Illustration">
</div>
<br>

<h3>As published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, 1 November 1924</h3>
<br>

<p class="first">THE thoroughbred racer represents the highest
development in the process of the horse's evolution. He stands
for something superior to his humble fellows in point of speed
and quality, and it is popularly believed that, having achieved
this physical superiority, he has acquired also an intelligence
which places him in a sphere apart from his species.</p>

<p>Racing is at once the greatest national sport, and, in point
of turnover, the second greatest industry in England. It has
produced both a press and a literature, and yet, for some
unaccountable reason, though thousands of books have been written
on the race-horse, no writer, scientific or biographical, has
devoted more than a chapter to the psychology of this fascinating
animal, and in consequence there has grown up about the race-horse a whole series of legends which are now accepted as proved
facts.</p>

<p>And not the least important of these is that the horse is an
intelligent animal with the power of reasoning.</p>

<p>That a dog thinks, we know. The proof that he turns events
over in his mind has been tested by every dog-lover. A dog
dreams. In his sleep he lives over his fights, his joys, and his
miseries. We have all at some time or other been compelled to
stir some gruffly barking little slumberer to wakefulness, or
have listened to his whimperings as he lay dead to the world
before the fire.</p>

<p>But the sleep of the horse is practically dreamless. Does he
think?</p>

<p><br>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Alfred Day</span>,</p>

<p class="first">the Arundel trainer, says "No." Mr. Day, an old
Sherborne boy, was brought up amongst horses, and is something of
a physiologist, for he was trained for a doctor. His father,
William Day, was the author of several books on the horse, and
was one of the most famous trainers of his time.</p>

<img src="2000631h-images/TheMindOfTheRaceHorse-01.png"
style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p>"The horse does not think&mdash;he is one of the most stupid
of the domestic animals, and the more perfectly bred they are,
the less evidence is there of intelligence. Possibly the
cart-horse is the cleverer of the two varieties. Horses get
credit for intelligence because they can associate consequences
with causes. If a horse finds a gap in a fence that leads him to
more desirable pasture, he goes to that gap the next day, though
there may be half-a-dozen other openings. If he has been stopped
at an inn for his master to take refreshments, he will always
stop at that inn, even though it has been converted into a
temperance hotel. A horse will recognize the boy who looks after
him because he associates the boy with certain attentions he
receives. A dog may show suspicion towards a stranger who tries
to feed it, but a horse will take oats from Tom as well as from
Jim&mdash;only the next time he sees Jim he will expect to be
fed."</p>

<p>People talk glibly about "rogues"&mdash;that is to say, horses
that, having reasoned out the why and wherefore of racing, decide
in their minds that they will not do their best. The term "rogue"
presupposes that the animals have the gift of thinking, and that
their erratic behaviour on a racecourse is the outcome of reason.
In effect, that a horse says to himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't like racing&mdash;it is a very distressing
occupation. One runs until one is exhausted and then there is
every chance of getting a good licking in the last furlong. I
won't try to run fast&mdash;I'll take it comfortably, and
although I shall probably get the licking I sha'n't run myself to
a standstill."</p>

<p>The rogue and the cunning horse, according to Mr. Day, are
more or less of a myth.</p>

<p>"There is usually something constitutionally wrong when a
horse will not give you his best." said Mr. Day. "I have only
seen two so-called rogues, and there was probably some obscure
physical cause for their failure."</p>

<p>My own experience bears this out. Last year I leased a good
young horse, that had won a thousand-pound race as a two-year
old. I ran him at Lewes, and it seemed to me that he ran like one
that could an' be would. For half the journey he was galloping
like a lion, and then suddenly seemed to decide that racing was a
fool's game. He finished last but one. The jockey told me that he
wouldn't have it&mdash;several knowledgeable people commiserated
with me upon my keeping a rogue in training.</p>

<p>My trainer called in a great veterinary surgeon, who
discovered that the horse had heart disease and divers other
complaints. He was destroyed a week later.</p>

<p>Horses have natural antipathies. Pharos, one of Lord Derby's
good horses and second in last year's Derby, has a rooted
objection to rain. So much so that when he paraded for this
year's City and Suburban Handicap his quarters were covered with
a rug to keep him dry.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2000631h-images/TheMindOfTheRaceHorse-02.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>Sansovino, on the other hand, treats rain as a joke, and a
muddy course is an ideal condition. There are scores of horses
who seemingly refuse to do their best on a left-handed course
(that is, where the turn into the straight is round a left-handed
bend, as at Epsom, Newbury, Lingfield, etc.), and scores of
others who show an appreciable improvement on a right-handed
course.</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2000631h-images/TheMindOfTheRaceHorse-03.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>Here again there is no question of "thinking." I traced the
history of four horses that go best on a right-handed course, and
found that their first efforts on a round course were at Kempton,
Gatwick, and Hurst Park, which are right-handed. Their gallops at
home were also right-handed. When they found themselves bearing
to the left in subsequent races they became unbalanced and
muddled.</p>

<p>It is a question of use and temperament. There is a certain
type of horse that dislikes to be alone, and when this sense of
loneliness comes to a horse he makes some queer friends. Town
Guard needed the companionship of a goat.. Papyrus was so
attached to a plater in Basil Jarvis's stable that the commoner
accompanied him to America when the Derby winner made his
remarkable journey. I had a horse who would kick his box to
pieces unless he had a favourite hen roosting on the edge of his
manger. Do these instances prove reasoning power on the part of
the horse?</p>

<p>One would hesitate to deny him such a faculty. If you reject
the possibility of a mental equipment, then you may find some
difficulty in defining that illusive and much-abused word
"class." For it is the fact that this imponderable quantity is
something distinct from breeding and conformation. It is the
something in a racehorse which cannot be handicapped to a few
pounds. In a tight finish it is represented by "the will to win,"
which brings a horse's nose in front at the winning-post. If he
cannot be a rogue, he cannot be honest without conscious thought.
He cannot be generous or cowardly.</p>

<p>I am perfectly sure that Tishy thought. This very good filly
ran stoutly in all her races except those she ran on the
Cesarewitch course. The big autumn handicap starts out of sight
of the stands, and there is a gallop of a mile along a course
which is chiefly remarkable by reason of the fact that there is
an entire absence of spectators. In both her races Tishy refused
to gallop after going half a mile, and the generally accepted
theory is that at some time or other she had been badly treated
or flogged at the particular point where she dropped out. Nothing
is further from the truth. Being a filly, and one likely to be
valuable for breeding purposes, she was never asked to do too
much, and Reginald Day, her then trainer, is a particularly
humane man. Besides which, horses at Newmarket are not trained on
the courses&mdash;there are so many, good gallops that it is not
necessary, even if it were permissible, to train on the actual
course over which they will run.</p>

<p>My theory is that Tishy had the temperamental failing of the
public performer. She wanted an audience. The only time she won
at Newmarket was when she ran on the Summer course, and a
description of that race published at the time says that "there
were an unusually large number of spectators down the course to
watch the Summer Handicap Plate." She did well at Leicester and
Sandown, and probably her best race was at Ascot, where the rails
are lined with people almost from start to finish. Tishy, one may
suppose, had a passion for the approval of humanity. Alas! poor
Tishy. It was unnecessary to take the opinion of Lord Derby. To
the man from whose name the greatest of all races takes its name,
a horse is almost human in its intelligence.</p>

<p>Another case of a too hasty classification was that of Black
Arrow, who was expected to win the Derby and refused to start,
though he was flogged by his trainer&mdash;since
dead&mdash;unmercifully. Poor Black Arrow dropped dead soon
after, and was found to be suffering from an enlarged liver.</p>

<p><br>
<span class="smcap">Mr. John Watson</span>,</p>

<p class="first">the well-known racehorse trainer, is equally emphatic on the question of roguery in horses.</p>

<img src="2000631h-images/TheMindOfTheRaceHorse-04.png"
style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p>"There are very few rogues," he told me, "though there are
times when I suspect that horses think a lot. Horses get to know
people and places, and of course they remember, though I doubt
whether they think consecutively. It is certain that some horses
love racing and some hate it. But, then. I think it is natural
for a horse bred for racing to love it, just as it is natural for
a kitten to play with a ball of wool. My own experience of the
race-horse leads me to believe that he is a most intelligent
animal."</p>

<p>It seems almost sacrilege to fly in the face of popular faith
and hold up the legendary genius of the horse as a myth; the more
so when we recall some extraordinary instances of what, if it is
not conclusive proof of thought, is clear evidence of
"intelligent association."</p>

<p>There is no more painstaking student of the horse than</p>


<p><br>
<span class="smcap">Mr. William Allison</span>,</p>

<p class="first">the Special Commissioner of the
<i>Sportsman</i>, and incidentally a great breeder. He manages
the Cobham Stud, and was instrumental in getting that great sire
Tracery brought back to this country.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt that horses think&mdash;but the less they
think the better, so far as winning races goes Diamond jubilee
thought a lot, and disliked Morny Cannon and Jack Watts. On the
other hand, he liked Herbert Jones. The worst genuine rogue I
ever saw was Pan, a very good 'chaser, who simply would not go
first past the post. I once saw him land over the last fence at
Handown about fifty lengths in front, and it seemed impossible
that he could avoid winning, but he switched his tail and swerved
all over the course until something else caught him up. He then
cantered in second.</p>

<p>"Horses certainly know people who have to do with them, and
they also know places&mdash;there are many who will pull up at
pubs where their former owners used to stop for a drink. Horses
certainly object to monotony in their gallops, and this is
relieved by such changes as they find at Epsom and Brighton."</p>

<p>It is a fact, as Mr. Allison says, that Diamond Jubilee, the
late King Edward's horse, had a rooted objection to Morny Cannon,
and as violent an antipathy to Watts. With either of these humane
jockeys on his back he alternated mulishness with savagery. But
there was a little stable boy who could do anything with him.</p>

<p>"Let the boy ride," said King Edward (who was then Prince of
Wales).</p>

<p>"But he has had no experience, your Royal Highness."</p>

<p>"He understands Jones, and Jones understands him," said the
King. So Herbert Jones, an unknown boy, was put up on Diamond
Jubilee&mdash;and won the Derby.</p>

<p>"He went like a lamb for me," said Jones, when I was talking
to him two years ago at Goodwood, "but that was because he knew
me."</p>

<p>And in this respect Diamond Jubilee resembled another horse
that ran at Ascot before the war. There was a jockey he did not
like, and he was so suspicious of some trick being played on him
that he never left the paddock without screwing his head round
and taking a good look at the lad on his back!</p>

<p><br>
<span class="smcap">Bernard Carslake</span></p>

<p class="first">is one of the finest judges of horses in this
country. A fearless rider, an exceptionally strong finisher, he
has also trained and owned race-horses since his childhood.</p>

<img src="2000631h-images/TheMindOfTheRaceHorse-05.png"
style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p>There is, by the way, a stupid legend that "Brownie" is
nervous of riding on downhill courses such as Epsom, probably due
to the fact that he did not win the Derby on Tetratema&mdash;a
horse that only stayed about seven furlongs in a true run race.
Tetratema ran his races in one breath&mdash;that is to say, he
did not draw a second breath from start to finish. Carslake in
point of fact is the most unnervous jockey riding.</p>

<p>He does not agree with Mr. Day's view.</p>

<p>"You have only to watch a steeplechase and note how careful
horses are not to step upon a fallen rider to realize that they
think. A horse will throw himself over to prevent himself
touching a man on the ground. Moreover, a horse recognizes and
remembers. When I was in Austria-Hungary before the war, I used
to ride an animal which for some extraordinary  reason took a
violent dislike to me. I never punish any horse I ride, and this
fellow in particular was always treated well by me. But he
loathed me. Whenever I appeared in the saddling ring he went mad.
Any other jockey he would tolerate, but for some mysterious cause
he would play Old Harry just as soon as he saw my face or heard
my voice. It is impossible that he did not think. There are other
horses <i>I</i> call to mind who are calm and collected just so
long as their riders are in their ordinary clothes. But the
moment they see them in racing colours they are in a blue funk.
Other horses can stand the colours but break into a perspiration
as soon as they see the crowd."</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<img src="2000631h-images/TheMindOfTheRaceHorse-06.png"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
</div>

<br>

<p>Carslake's view is, however, not inconsistent with Mr. Day's
theory. The memory of the great jockey's face and voice might
conceivably be associated with a day when the animal was not
feeling his best, and when the last thing in the world he wanted
to do was to race. It is not so easy to explain the extraordinary
care which, as he rightly says, horses display when meeting a
fallen rider. One has seen this happen a hundred times, but in
all probability this reluctance to step on a man is traceable to
the instinctive caution found in all animals. The horse is
reacting to the first law of nature. He "knows" that to touch an
obstacle may bring him down, and it is certain that he would as
assiduously avoid a small bump on the ground or a fallen horse.
In the case of a jumper the association of ideas connects
touching an obstacle with a fall, and we know that where this
lesson has not been learnt horses have stepped upon fallen
riders. A brilliant young jockey was killed at Chester in May
from this cause.</p>

<p>I have seen a horse being brought out of his box to be
destroyed stop dead and, planting his two feet squarely on the
ground, refuse to move, his trembling frame telling clearly that
he knew the fate that was in store for him. In this particular
case the old fellow was given a reprieve, and, from being an
incorrigibly slow animal, improved so well that he won a five-hundred-pound hurdle race.</p>

<p>One could multiply instances of horses that were sent to run
their last race with a sentence of death hanging over them, who
have either won or so improved in their running that a respite
has been granted.</p>

<p><br>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Stanley Wootton</span>,</p>

<p class="first">a famous rider in his time and now the most successful of the younger school of trainers, is equally emphatic that horses reason.</p>

<img src="2000631h-images/TheMindOfTheRaceHorse-07.png"
style="margin-left:20%; float:left"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">

<p>"Although his thinking is not confined to feeding time," he
said, "the one fact which convinces me that he gives certain
matters a weighty consideration is his fastidiousness in the
matter of feed and water.</p>

<p>"Horses undoubtedly have marked likes and dislikes for
individuals, and their antipathies are more or less mysterious. I
have known horses that could not bear certain stable boys near
them."</p>

<p>A year ago there was a horse in Wootton's stable who hated the
inoffensive boy and made several attempts to kill him. One
morning he dragged the boy from a horse he was riding and knelt
on him. When the boy was rescued and sent home on a hack, the
horse broke loose and, chasing the injured youth, dragged him off
again!</p>

<p>Stanley Wootton is one of those thorough trainers who keep
their eyes on every horse in their stable, and it is impossible
that the boy could have hurt the horse in any way without his
knowing. One thing is certain, that horses never get over their
dislike of those humans who incur their displeasure, and not even
the elephant, whose memory is proverbially long, can retain an
animosity for a greater length of time.</p>

<p>In racing circles they call Alec Taylor of Manton "the
Wizard," and in so far as he can get to the very inside of a
horse's mind this nickname is justified.</p>

<p>"Bought one of Taylor's horses, have you?" said a well-known
sportsman to another. "I wish you luck. Personally, I never want
to buy horses that Taylor is finished with&mdash;he speaks their
language, and they tell him when they're no good!"</p>

<p><br>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Alec Taylor</span>,</p>

<p class="first">like his father before him, has an extraordinary
knowledge of the thoroughbred and studies his peculiarities with
the patience of a scientist. His view is that the horse has a
mind. No man pays less attention to the popular view, and he has
kept horses in training which, according to every authority on
racing, have been incorrigible rogues. A recent case in point was
Stratford, a wilful, unreliable animal, whom, after costly
failures, he coaxed into winning.</p>

<p>If at any race meeting you see a well-dressed young man with
an umbrella hooked to his arm, leading a horse out of the
paddock, you have seen a man to whom every horse is a thinking
wonder.</p>

<p>"Of course horses think! Put a nervous rider up on a horse and
see how quickly the animal knows! If he didn't think, it would
make no difference to him whether he was nervous or as bold as a
lion. The straight-thinking horse is a joy to deal with. He is
equable in temper, honest in running, and he likes his bit of fun
just the same as a human."</p>

hinting what he thinks of the horses in his stable, for this is
one of the lean years that come to every trainer.</p>

<p>Yet Mr. Gilpin has had quite a number of "thinkers"&mdash;from
the placid Pretty Polly to the mud-larking St. Louis.</p>

<p>There is a story that there was a horse in his stable which on
one occasion was narrowly beaten by a very good horse in a race,
and thereafter, when he found himself in a race with the same
animal, took one look at him at the "gate" and refused to
start!</p>

<p>I once owned a race-horse that on the morning of a race was
found to be lame and was sent home again. The trouble was a minor
one&mdash;it yielded to treatment in a few days, and a fortnight
later he was sent over to a neighbouring racecourse to run in a
small plate. That morning he was galloped on the course and went
like a lion, but when the trainer brought him out before the race
he was dead lame. An examination was made, but no injury could be
discovered. Again he was sent home, and this time, without any
treatment at all, the trouble disappeared. For a third time he
was sent to a course, and for a third time, just before the race,
the lameness came on. His number was in the frame, and the
stewards were approached to allow him to be withdrawn. But one of
them said that he had seen the horse walking about without
trouble and permission was refused. I thought the steward had
been mistaken, but on interviewing the boy in charge of the
equine scoundrel I learnt that the moment the trainer and I had
left him he had frisked about like a two-year-old. On the
appearance of the trainer, however, the lameness came on. He
literally limped to the post&mdash;and won the race by three
lengths!</p>

<br>

<p>This might have been due to stiffness, but a few weeks later
he fell shin-sore. You test a horse for this complaint by running
your hand down the cannon-bone. If the horse flinches he is shin-sore. He flinched. What is more, for months after, whenever a
hand touched his leg, he flinched. On the second occasion I'll
swear that he was no more shin-sore than I was, but he knew that
by flinching he avoided a hard race.</p>

<p>Shin-sore or not, we ran him and he was beaten two heads; the
next time out lie tried both the lame stunt and the shin-sore
flinch. Subsequently we took no notice cf his malingering unless
he went short in his gallop. Happily he never learnt this
dodge.</p>

<p>There is at the moment a horse in training who can leap like a
deer; no fence is too high for him. But for some extraordinary
reason he refuses most resolutely to jump the last
fence&mdash;preferring to take the short cut to the winning-post,
which disqualifies him&mdash;for every fence must be jumped. I
have seen him ten lengths in front with the winning-post in
sight. He is not distressed, he is galloping comfortably; he has
cleared water jump and rail fence without an effort, and
then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Watch this horse run out," says the man on the Press
stand.</p>

<p>It is the last fence. He is coming straight for it full of
running&mdash;a violent swerve and he has come triumphantly
through the gap, despite the agonized efforts of his jockey.</p>

<p>He knows, of course, that if this performance were not varied
with a very occasional win he would most surely find himself in
the hands of a veterinary surgeon, and that a humane killer would
be fixed to his head, there would be a "plop!" and he would kick
himself through the gap that leads to the horses' heaven. And
when he is given his last chance, and his trainer tells him
solemnly that this is his final appearance on a steeplechase
course, he wins!</p>

<p>Is this instinct or thought? Is there some thing in the
trainer's tone which reaches his brain and causes him to readjust
his plans? If you believe this, you must believe that he reasons,
and I think you would be right in so believing.</p>

<p>The deeper one probes into the mystery of a horse's mentality,
the more convinced one grows that the horse is a thinking animal.
There are many physical reasons why a horse cannot demonstrate
his intelligence as readily as a dog&mdash;it is impossible to
imagine, for instance, a horse leaping up and pawing a human
friend or licking his face; but that he has his moments of
rumination and that he can give physical expression to mental
conditions is, I think, proved beyond doubt.</p>

<h3>A TRUE-CRIME CLASSIC</h3>

<h3>First published, without a title, as an introduction to the book<br>
<i>The Trial of Patrick Herbert Mahon</i>,<br>

<br>
Reprinted as "The Suburban Lothario" in<br>

<br>

<p class="first">IT is a natural thing for the humanitarian to
say, of any man convicted of wilful murder, that he could not
have been sane when he performed the act; and when murder is done
in such circumstances and in such an atmosphere as that which
marked the destruction of Emily Beilby Kaye, more profoundly does
the mind of a balanced man grow bewildered.</p>

<p>Yet all things were possible with Patrick Herbert Mahon, whose
form of insanity took the shape of a colossal vanity. Mahon was a
man of pleasing address, popular with women and with his fellow
men. For all his anti-social acts, he was in the way of being a
social success in certain circumstances in those circles to which
he had the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>.</p>

<p>He was born in Liverpool; one of a large family of struggling
middle-class folk&mdash;a boy of some small talent and an
assiduous attendant at Sunday school. So he became an office boy,
ultimately a junior clerk. He continued to go regularly to church
and took a vivid interest in its social affairs. He displayed
some prowess in athletics and was particularly fond of football,
becoming indeed a prominent member of one of the local church
teams. His early mode of life is described as having been a model
for all young men.</p>

<p>At school he first met the pretty, dark-haired girl to whom
his life was to become so tragically linked. She was two years
younger than he, and their school friendship developed into
something warmer at a later stage. Indeed, they were both in
their teens when he first proposed marriage. There was strong
opposition by both families and it was two years after
this&mdash;in 1910&mdash;that they were married. He was then
twenty and the girl eighteen.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a reckless marriage. But this at least should
be said. If any woman could have deflected Mahon from the path
that was to lead to the scaffold, it was Mrs. Mahon. With
singular devotion she held to him through the black and anxious
years to the end. Hers is the real tragedy of this story.</p>

<p>Within a year of their marriage he had forged and uttered
cheques for £123 on the firm which employed him. With this money
he took a girl to the Isle of Man. He was traced, brought back,
and bound over. Mrs. Mahon forgave him and they left Liverpool to
start life anew.</p>

<p>Ultimately he obtained a position with a dairy firm in
Wiltshire. There is no doubt that he had a fund of business
ability, and this, with an apparent genial vivacity of manner,
served him well for a time. He was still a "sportsman", and
played football for a local team.</p>

<p>About this time a little girl was born. Hard upon this Mahon
was arrested for embezzling £60 from his employers and was
sentenced at Dorchester Assizes to twelve months'
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Upon his release he is known to have lived for a while in the
neighbourhood of Caine, Wiltshire. There was a mysterious
epidemic of burglaries in this neighbourhood, and it may or may
not have been a coincidence that Mahon suddenly decided to seek
other quarters.</p>

<p>He is next heard of at Sunningdale, where he was employed by a
dairy. This time there were some love affairs which provoked a
little scandal. Again Mahon was thrown out of work. There is a
gap here which the imagination may easily fill in. Mahon had
become interested in racing, and, when opportunity offered,
attended race meetings in many capacities&mdash;preferably as a
bookmaker's clerk.</p>

<p>However that may be, it fell on a day in the early part of
1916 that a branch of the National Provincial Bank at Sunningdale
was entered at night. A maid-servant who interrupted the intruder
was ferociously attacked with a hammer. When she regained
consciousness she found herself in the arms of Mahon, who was
kissing her. Later Mahon, who had dodged to Wallasey, was
arrested and tried at Guildford Assizes for the offence. It was
brought plainly home, and after he had been found guilty he made
a whining appeal to the judge to be allowed to join the Army.
Lord Darling sternly retorted that he was a thorough-paced
hypocrite whom the Army could do without, and sentenced him to
five years' penal servitude.</p>

<p>That term he served. A boy was born in 1916, but died a year
or two later without having seen his father. Mrs. Mahon, left to
her own resources, with indomitable courage sought a living for
her little girl and herself. She obtained a post with Consols
Automatic Aerators Ltd., which had a factory at Sunbury. Her
efficiency and energy soon attracted the attention of the heads
of the firm, and she was promoted to a responsible position.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">MAHON came back from prison&mdash;full of
promises of reform, anxious to be again with his wife. Observe
that he always came back&mdash;that Mrs. Mahon always took him
back. Superintendent Carlin of Scotland Yard made a shrewd
observation on this trait: "He was keenly disposed to
'philandering' or having 'affairs' with this or that woman
casually as they attracted him. But he never, I am convinced,
wished to sever his connection with his domestic hearth. He felt
in his his own mind that the woman he had married was his sheet
anchor; that, if he cast off from her, he would be adrift."</p>

<p>They settled down in a flat in Pagoda Avenue, Richmond, and
Mrs. Mahon used her influence to procure him a berth as a soda-fountain salesman with her firm. Mahon did well&mdash;so well
that when in May, 1922, the business was put in the hands of a
Receiver he was appointed sales manager.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that the Receiver of the Company, a member of a
firm of chartered accountants, in the beginning of 1923 engaged
as a typist a woman&mdash; she can scarcely be described as a
girl, since she was then thirty-seven years old, Miss Emily
Beilby Kaye.</p>

<p>Miss Kaye had maintained herself by her own efforts for many
years. She was a competent, experienced woman, not uncomely, who
lived at a bachelor girls' club, and had managed to put by a sum
of money, considerable for one in her position. She was not in
the least averse from a flirtation with the handsome sales
manager, this suburban Lothario, with whom business circumstances
now brought her in contact.</p>

<p>The affair developed rapidly. She at least fell violently in
love. Mahon may have thought that it would end as other episodes
of this kind had before ended for him. But Emily Kaye was not
easily discarded, I think we may accept Mahon's own words on this
point:</p>

<p>"Just before Christmas, Miss Kaye was dismissed from the
office where she was employed, and, as a result, had a lot of
time on her hands, and she wished me to see her more frequently
which I was unwilling to do for several reasons. She reproached
me on several occasions as being cold, and told me quite plainly
that she wished my affection and was determined to win it if
possible. I felt sorry for the fact that she had been dismissed
and did, as a result, meet her a bit more frequently. I
temporized in the hope of gaining time, but from that moment I
felt more or less at the mercy of a strong-minded woman, whom,
though I liked her in many ways, I did not tremendously care
for."</p>

<p>Mahon was embarrassed&mdash;perhaps a little scared. But he
went on, and there were certain dabblings with francs in which he
was proved to have had some concern, with Miss Kaye's money. He
asserted that some of his own money had been used in these
transactions, but there can be no question that the funds were
provided by the woman. Miss Kaye was for a short while in
employment, but again fell out of work and some time in February,
1924, she probably became aware that she was pregnant. Said
Mahon:</p>

<p>"She became thoroughly unsettled and begged me to give up
everything and go abroad with her. I plainly told her that I
could not agree to such a course. I agreed to consider the
matter, however, in the hope of gaining some time, but she
suggested I should take a holiday and go away with her for a week
or two, and take a bungalow, where we would be alone together,
and where she would convince me with her love that I should be
perfectly happy with her."</p>

<p>This was the immediate prologue to the tragedy. Miss Kaye was
not as some of the other women Mahon had made his playthings. She
could not be easily thrown aside.</p>

<p>Apart from this episode, Mahon felt the ground solid beneath
his feet. His income was more considerable than it had ever been
and, added to that of his wife, allowed a very comfortable
existence. He was happy in his work; he was popular among his
social acquaintances in Richmond and the neighbourhood. He had
become secretary of a local bowling club. Save to his wife, his
past was utterly unknown. The future looked full of promise. All
this would have to be jettisoned, his career, his friends, his
home&mdash;and he had a sort of attachment to his wife and little
girl&mdash;if he yielded to Miss Kaye and took to flight with
her.</p>

<p>He fought weakly to save himself. Even so, he might have
succeeded, had not fate put into the hands of Emily Kaye
somewhere about this time a weapon against which he felt
impotent. It was the first of a number of strange coincidences
with which the case was marked. No reference was made to it at
the trial, nor did it leak out in the newspapers.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">EMILY KAYE was clearing a drawer of some of her
belongings. At the bottom of the drawer someone had placed a
sheet of newspaper. And as she took it out her eye lighted
casually on the name of Patrick Mahon. Thus she read of his trial
at Guildford Assizes.</p>

<p>It may be assumed that she used this knowledge in her
interviews with Mahon. She pressed the idea of "a love
experiment," and he gave way. He engaged a bungalow on the
stretch of lonely beach between Eastbourne and Pevensey Bay for
two months, using the assumed name of Waller. This bungalow,
known indifferently as "Officer's House" and "Langney Bungalow,"
had formerly been the official residence of the officer in
command of a coastguard station.</p>

<p>This was at the beginning of April, 1924. Miss Kaye received
the news with some coldness. She had not intended the
"experiment" to last longer than a few days. However, she sold
out her remaining shares, and went down to stay at Eastbourne by
herself while she looked over the place. Mahon was to join her
later.</p>

<p>He was very worried: "I felt in myself very depressed and
miserable, and did not wish to spend the three or four days
together as she desired, but as I had given my word, and as I
felt that I could definitely prove how foolish the hope was on
her part to expect to keep my affection, even could she gain it,
I thought I had better go through with it."</p>

<p>Yet the ruling passion was still strong in him. Two days
before he was to take possession of the bungalow with Miss Kaye
he met Miss Duncan&mdash;a stranger&mdash; in the street at
Richmond, and although it was a wet night walked with her most of
the way to her home at Richmond. He remarked that his married
life was a tragedy, and invited her to dine with him on the
following Wednesday. The episode gives a clue to the psychology
of the man. Murder must have been very close to his mind at that
time, and yet he could philander with still another woman.</p>

<p>On April 12 he purchased a saw and knife at a shop in Victoria
Street, and travelling down to Eastbourne met Miss Kaye at the
station. They took a cab to the bungalow, and so the "love
experiment" started. So far as his home and his firm was
concerned Mahon was supposed to be travelling "on business.".</p>

<p>Miss Kaye had set her heart on eloping to South Africa. She
had informed her friends that she was engaged&mdash;she had shown
some of them a ring-and that her fianc&eacute; had a good post at
the Cape. In a letter written to a friend on April 14 she said
that she and "Pat" intended to spend a little time in Paris
before going out. This was the last communication that any of her
friends or relatives had from her.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, April 15, the two travelled to London together.
Mahon had agreed to apply for a passport, but when they met in
the evening to return to Eastbourne he told her that he had not
done so, and did not intend to do so. A quarrel broke out in the
train.</p>

<p>If Mahon's story is to be credited the woman presented him
with an ultimatum when they reached the bungalow. She insisted
that he should write to friends that he intended going to Paris
and thence to South Africa. Mahon refused, and Miss Kaye, in an
access of ungovernable fury first threw a coal axe at him, and
then attacked him with her bare hands. In the struggle&mdash;this
is Mahon's version&mdash;they fell, and she struck her head on a
coal cauldron. A little later he realized that she was dead.</p>

<p>I mention Mahon's explanation, but few people will be found to
believe that it was other than a cold-blooded and premeditated
murder. Clearly he knew that he would be free the following
evening, for he had during the day wired to Miss Duncan making an
appointment.</p>

<p>His story of consternation and horror has a genuine ring.
Mahon was a man of temperament and he felt the reaction. He was
face to face with the problem that has confronted many
murderers&mdash;the disposal of the body. And although he seems
to have formed his plans beforehand&mdash;witness the purchase of
the saw and the knife&mdash;he had not the nerve to put them into
immediate execution. He carried the body to a spare bedroom and
covered it with a fur coat.</p>

<p>That night he spent in Eastbourne, and on the next evening he
dined in London with Miss Duncan. He remarked that he was staying
at a charming bungalow and induced her to agree to pay him a
visit two days later&mdash;on Good Friday. He confirmed this the
following day by a wire from Eastbourne, "Meet train as arranged,
Waller," and sent a telegraphic money order for four pounds.</p>

<p>This was on the face of it the act of a lunatic. The body was
still at the bungalow. The man was taking a grotesque
chance&mdash;for what? He himself gave the answer: "The damned
place was haunted; I wanted human companionship."</p>

<p>Unquestionably Mahon's nerve was badly shaken and yet to all
outward appearance he gave no sign. Miss Duncan does not appear
to have had any suspicion and she went down to Eastbourne on Good
Friday afternoon and was met by Mahon and taken to the bungalow.
That day before her arrival he had commenced a sinister work, and
there was one room that was barred to his visitor. He told her
that it contained valuable books.</p>

<p>The next day he left her at Eastbourne and went by himself to
Plumpton Races. Here he was noticed by an acquaintance who
attached no special significance to the meeting, although it
proved to be of vital importance in the chain of circumstance
that was to betray the murderer.</p>

<p>Mahon realized by now that the presence of Miss Duncan was
going to embarrass him. So he concocted a telegram in a
fictitious name and despatched it to himself as Waller at the
bungalow, making an appointment in London for an early hour on
Tuesday morning. Thus he was afforded an excuse for cutting short
Miss Duncan's stay. They returned to town on Easter Monday, and
somewhere about midnight Mahon arrived back at his home at
Kew.</p>

<p>He was back at the bungalow on Tuesday. Here I may tell a
curious story which did not come out in evidence. He had already
partly dismembered the body, and he now set to work with the
intention of disposing of the remains piecemeal. The day was dark
and heavy. He built a huge fire in the room and upon this placed
the head. At that moment the storm broke with an appalling crash
of thunder and a violent flash of lightning. As the head lay upon
the coals the dead eyes opened, and Mahon, in his shirtsleeves as
he was, fled blindly out to the rain-swept shingle of the
deserted shore. When he nerved himself to return the fire had
done its work.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary coincidence that whilst he was giving
evidence at his trial a thunderstorm was also raging. He gave
calm denial when he was asked if he had desired the death of Miss
Kaye. Almost on his words the court was illumined by lightning
and re-echoed with the crash of thunder. Those who saw his face
and knew the truth will never forget that moment when the sound
of the storm brought back to his mind that fearful midnight
scene. He was a broken man when he faced the deadly
crossexamination of Sir Henry Curtis Bennett.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">MAHON discovered that with every method his
ingenuity could suggest the disposal of the body was likely to be
a long job. Meanwhile he had to show himself at his office and
his home. He returned to his home on the Tuesday night, and
during the rest of the week he had to be at his work. On Saturday
and Sunday he renewed his labours. On Sunday he conceived the
idea of distributing some pieces of the dismembered body from a
railway carriage window.</p>

<p>He spent some time over the gruesome business of packing a
Gladstone bag. No chance seems to have offered itself on the
journey to London that evening but he did succeed in getting rid
of some portions between Waterloo Station and Richmond. But he
was unable completely to empty the bag, and he decided to go on
to Reading. The night he spent at an hotel in that town.</p>

<p>The next day&mdash;Monday&mdash;he returned to London. The bag
was now empty save for the wrappings he had used and a cook's
knife. These he probably intended to destroy later. He was acute
enough to realize that if he had thrown them away they might have
been identified.</p>

<p>The bag he left at one of the cloakrooms at Waterloo Station
and went home. Now, although Mrs. Mahon had forgiven more than
most women would have done, she was a person of intelligence.
Mahon's strange comings and goings of late, his messages by
telegram, his stories of business out of town, did not altogether
impose on her. She knew him too well. Still, although she could
not fail to be suspicious, no glimmer of the real truth was
present in her mind. Someone had mentioned casually that he had
met Mahon at Plumpton Races and she feared that this was an
explanation. Her husband had been previously mixed up with
bookmaking and, in spite of his promise to her, it was possible
that he had gone back.</p>

<p>She found the cloakroom ticket in one of his suits. She took a
friend into her confidence&mdash;he had been formerly connected
with the railway police&mdash;and asked him to discover what it
referred to. She had a belief that it might be some of the
paraphernalia used by bookmakers. Thus it came about that the bag
was closely examined. It was locked, but by pulling at the one
end some indication of its grim secret was revealed.</p>

<p>Scotland Yard was immediately informed, and Chief Detective-Inspector Savage had men posted to watch the cloakroom. Mrs.
Mahon was informed that there was nothing to suggest that her
husband was bookmaking.</p>

<p>Mahon returned for the bag on the Friday evening (May 2). As
it was handed to him a detective stopped him.</p>

<p>"Rubbish," he exclaimed when told that he would be taken to
a police station. This little touch of bravado did not help him.
He was taken to the station and later to Scotland Yard. The bag
was opened and was found to contain a cook's knife which had been
recently used, two pieces of silk, a towel, a silk scarf, a pair
of torn knickers, and a brown canvas racquet case marked EBK.
Most of these things were blood-stained, and the whole contents
of the bag had been heavily sprinkled with a disinfectant.</p>

<p>Savage confronted his prisoner with these things and asked for
an explanation. Mahon explained, lamely, that he had carried meat
for the dogs in the bag. </p>

<p>"That will not do," said the Inspector. "These stains are of
human blood." </p>

<p>"You seem to know all about it," retorted Mahon.</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour or more there was silence. Then Mahon
spoke. "I wonder," he said, "if you can realize how terrible a
thing it is for one's body to be active and one's mind to fail to
act."</p>

<p>Apart from one other muttered remark there was again silence
for three-quarters of an hour. Mahon came to a resolve. "I
suppose you know everything," he said. "I will tell you the
truth."</p>

<p>He was cautioned, and then he told for the first time his
version of the tragedy. I have drawn upon this and his subsequent
statements in this account of the affair.</p>

<p>The Scotland Yard experts and the East Sussex Constabulary at
once got to work. A search of the bungalow revealed many traces
of the crime. There were portions of the body, and evidence of
the attempt to get rid of it. But two very important parts of the
body were missing. No trace of the head could be found. This, in
all probability would have shown exactly how the murder was
committed. There was no trace of the uterus.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THE trial opened at Lewes Assizes during July,
1924, before Mr. Justice Avory, an experienced and strong
criminal judge. Sir Henry Curtis Bennett led for the Crown, and
Mr. J. D. Cassels, K.C., for the defence.</p>

<p>The point taken by the defence was that the death of Miss Kaye
was an accident, that either during a struggle between Mahon and
Miss Kaye she had died from striking her head against a coal-scuttle, or that in fighting her off he had unintentionally
strangled her. Mr. Cassels handled the case with notable skill,
but he had to fight some deadly and almost irresistible
inferences.</p>

<p>Although Sir Bernard Spilsbury, the pathologist, refused to
commit himself to an opinion on the precise manner of death he
was definite in his assertion that it could not have been caused
by the woman striking her head against the coal-scuttle, which
was of fragile construction. He was able to say that Miss Kaye,
had she lived, would have become a mother.</p>

<p>All the shifts and deceits of Mahon during his intrigue with
Miss Kaye were exposed to the jury. It was shown that over £500
of Miss Kaye's savings had disappeared. Three one-hundred pound
notes, which had been in her possession, were shown to have been
changed by Mahon in false names at various places. Overwhelming
motives were shown by which he might have been actuated to
murder.</p>

<p>The judge's charge to the jury was a lucid, perfectly fair,
but damning summary of the case. Within half an hour the jury had
found Mahon guilty.</p>

<p>You may say, as has been said, that none but a lunatic could
have acted as he did; but apart from the deed, Mahon acted like a
sane, calculating man.</p>

<p>I have referred to Mahon's vanity: it is a peculiar trait in
all the "great" murderers that they desire to be thought well of.
He cannot bear the thought of leaving a stunned servant maid with
a bad opinion (not unnatural) of the man who assaulted her. He is
at all times anxious to be considered by his respectable
companions as a man of substance and a prince of good fellows, a
self-described "Broth of a bhoy."</p>

<p>There was never a more cold-blooded murderer except perhaps
George Joseph Smith, than this unspeakable villain. Even at the
end, when he confessed his guilt to the prison officials, he
begged that they would not make public his confession for fear of
the "bad impression it might make."</p>

<h3>1. The Educated Criminals.</h3>

<p class="first">ALL men are born criminals. The baby in its
cradle knows no law. Its tiny hands would kill and maim to the
limit of its strength: it takes whatsoever its hands can reach,
irrespective of lawful ownership. Remove the baby from the care
and tuition of its civilized mother and nurse, cut out all the
"don'ts" and "mustn'ts" which stand in the rough for the laws by
which society is governed and it remains an active criminal until
the end of its days. That is to say,it takes what it wishes, it
slays that which it hates, it is entirely self-indulgent. All
wild things are "criminal," in that they obey only the laws of
nature.</p>

<p>The criminal, as we understand the phrase, is a man or woman
who ignores a few of the rules of which society has agreed shall
govern human activities. He understands and approves of those
laws, and is all for the enforcement of those which protect him
equally with the innocent citizen. </p>

<p>He requires that the police shall so regulate the traffic that
he may drive his stolen motor car with a minimum of risk to
himself; that his landlord shall not dispossess him of his
habitation, that his food shall not be adulterated, and that his
private enemies shall not assassinate him.</p>

<h3>Lawless Man, a Phenomenon.</h3>

<p class="first">THE entirely lawless man is a phenomenon&mdash;even
Ulianov Lenin was not a completely lawless man, since he railed
against the unpunctuality of Russian trains.</p>

<p>I do not intend in these articles to go very deeply into the
psychology of the criminal. His mentality has been fantastically
tabulated by such biased scientists as Lombroso, his facial and
physical peculiarities have formed the basis of theses for
writers who, during the past hundred years, have devoted their
studies to him and his ways; nor is it necessary that I should
take a microscope to examine the seeds of his proliferation.</p>

<p>Here he is, a fact to be faced by the prosocial forces of
every country, a hateful fact to some, a fearful fact to others,
an interesting fact to all who count nothing that is human
without interest.</p>

<p>The statistician does not help one very much to understand
him, for statistics can prove just what you wish them to prove:
Statistics have proved to one party that crime has fallen off 50
percent in an American city since the introduction of
prohibition, and has proved with equal force to another that the
police were only half as efficient since the city went "dry."</p>

<h3>Living Beyond Income.</h3>

<p class="first">IT may be stated broadly that the cause of
criminality in an individual is his desire to live beyond the
income that he believes he could obtain by the legitimate
exploitation of his abilities.</p>

<p>There is no underworld in the sense that there is no criminal
community dwelling and conspiring together to break the law.
Criminals are individualists. Two or three may gather together to
carry out some "job" but there is no fixity in their
associations. Harry C. and Tommy B. together with Johnny H. may
arrange to burgle a house or two houses; may, indeed, for a
period work together at their nefarious occupations, but the
chances are that they will be split up into units either through
detection or through suspicion, one of the other, and Tommy B.
will be working with Frederick K. on the next "job" he does.</p>

<h3>Criminals Classified.</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN attempting to classify the habitual
criminals it is possible to divide them into two main divisions:
the educated and the uneducated. There are grades of educated
criminals-so-called--and in the highest of these you will find
the "aristocracy," which travels first-class in the liners plying
between Britain and foreign ports. They are men of some
substances, they have reserves of money, and they alone of the
criminal classes can be fairly described as  working in
gangs.</p>

<p>Card-sharpers rarely change their partners. They may
occasionally find a new assistant who is not skilled in the use
of cards but has a plausible tongue and an attractive appearance,
but the actual operators work together year in, year out. There
is one confederacy consisting of three separate gangs, and it
does happen in this case that changes are made for every voyage,
so that the same three men are rarely seen together.</p>

<h3>"Respectable" Card-Sharpers.</h3>

<p class="first">THE first-class card-sharper lives a very
respectable life. He usually has his home in the United States
and will cross the ocean from six to ten times a year. Arriving
in London, he puts up at a good hotel, and it may be that, having
found a "sucker" on the boat who showed some reluctance to be
inveigled in a game of cards, a coup is arranged on land, and the
friendship which began at sea exploited disastrously for the
victim.</p>

<p>At least twice a year the shipboard card-sharpers make a tour
of the European cities. You will find them on the Riviera in the
season and quite recently they have been discovered in winter
sports areas. They are very careful to avoid Monte Carlo, which
has a system of espionage more perfect than is to be found in any
other city in the Continent. When I was in Berlin the other day I
was told by a police official that card-sharp gangs had been
located in some of the big German cities, and particularly in the
spas of Czechoslovakia.</p>

<h3>An Interesting Type</h3>

<p class="first">THE card-sharp is the most interesting of all
the criminals. He has a knowledge of human psychology which is
positively staggering. For example it is very rare that a sea-
going "crowd" will attempt to fleece their dupes before at least
three days of the voyage are over. The passenger who comes on
board a steamer is naturally suspicious of chance acquaintances,
and would probably regard an  invitation to play cards made by a
perfect stranger as a sinister circumstance.</p>

<p>I will give my own experience the only time that I was ever
caught. We were due in Southampton on Wednesday morning, and on
the Saturday night a venerable old gentleman  with whom I talked
about everything in the world except cards, suggested we should
play a game of bridge before going to bed. His confederate (and I
hadn't the slightest idea that they were connected, and looked
upon them as on people who had casually drifted to the table
where I was drinking a nightcap) demurred.</p>

<h3>"Too Late for Bridge."</h3>

<p class="first">"IT is much too late to start bridge tonight,"
one said.</p>

<p>"What about tomorrow?" asked my venerable friend.</p>

<p>Here the cleverness of these crooks was revealed. A sturdy,
white-haired man, who was the second member of the gang, shook
his head.</p>

<p>"No, not on Sunday," he said, "I am not a Puritan, and I have
no objection to other people playing cards, but I never play
cards on Sunday, and I don't want to start now. You may think I
am old-fashioned, but there it is."</p>

<p>I respected the man for his scruples. I was impressed. Here
was an honest gentleman, a little old-fashioned, as he said, but
a man of principle.</p>

<p>On Monday morning I met them in the smoke room. "It was much
too early for bridge," protested the venerable one. It looked as
if we were not going to get our game. Eventually it was decided
to play between lunch and tea in the Parisian Cafe, and here we
played. I made a grand slam in the first hand&mdash;I had lost £80 at the finish.</p>

<h3>A Question of Stakes.</h3>

<p class="first">"WHY play at such high stakes?" you ask.</p>

<p>Again you have to admire their cleverness.</p>

<p>"We will play for a shilling," said one of them.</p>

<p>Naturally, I thought it was a shilling a hundred. It was after
I had been dealt my first hand, which was blazing with aces and
kings, that somebody said:</p>

<p>"Isn't a shilling a point too high?"</p>

<p>I suppose if I had been inhumanly honest I should have
said:</p>

<p>"No, I am playing for a shilling a hundred."</p>

<p>I could afford a shilling and did not say no.</p>

<p>I realised that I had been caught before the game was over. I
paid my losses. I did not regret my playing because I
subsequently made quite a lot of money out of writing stories
about the ocean-going crook.</p>

<p>I give this instance of the mentality of the higher grade
criminal as an illustration.</p>

<h3>Confidence Men.</h3>

<p class="first">IN the same class are the confidence men. Not
the gentlemen who are to be found in the London parks looking for
a man whose name is Smith in order to hand over to him hundreds
of thousands of pounds left by a mythological millionaire, but
the big men who wander around Europe looking for the big money.
They may make a killing once a year, but they land a tremendous
booty.</p>

<p>These criminals are generally blackmailers as well as
confidence men, and they utilize every scrap of information they
can secure in order to hook their fish. Very rarely is there a
squeal, and they enjoy a greater immunity than any other type of
criminal.</p>

<p>A perfect specimen of an educated lawbreaker operated in the
Midlands. He had been a priest and had been unfrocked for certain
malpractices. He went to a Midland city and opened a bookshop,
and people who saw a few shelves covered with heavy and
uninteresting tomes on ecclesiastical and religious matters
wondered how he gained a living. Then, one day, two Scotland Yard
men arrived and took him away with them.</p>

<p>I think his form of graft was the most ingenious I have ever
met with. He used to search diligently in all the newspapers&mdash;he subscribed to some fifty local and country weeklies&mdash;to discover the names of clergymen of the Church of England who had died.</p>

<h3>Ingenious Fraud.</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN he had secured the information about their
death, he looked them up in Croker to get some idea of their
stipends, and a few days later the executors of the deceased
clergyman received a bill for books supplied.</p>

<p>Sometimes the bill was paid without demur, but occasionally
the executor would ask for a statement of accounts, and would
receive at once a long list of obscene works, such as certain
obscure booksellers supply. In order to save any kind of scandal,
and probably believing the worst of their poor dead friend, the
executors sent a check in settlement.</p>

<p>His undoing came in a remarkable way&mdash;he sent a bill to the executors of a West of England clergyman, a man he supposed to have plenty of money, and the executors asked for particulars.
Back came an appalling list designed to show that the dead priest
had a depraved taste. A few days afterward the swindler was
arrested. He had made a mistake. The deceased clergyman had been
stone blind for twenty years, a fact with which he had not
acquainted himself.</p>

<h3>Still Being Worked.</h3>

<p class="first">THIS, I believe, is a practice that is still
being worked. If executors and relations will take my advice they
will immediately hand to the police any communication framed on
the lines of this crook's demands. Here is a man who deliberately
sets out to swindle&mdash;unlike many others equally fortunate in the matter of education, who drifted "to the left."</p>

<p>As a rule, this kind of thief, more than his uneducated
fellow, is driven to crime by immediate necessity. He starts by
forging an acceptance on a bill of exchange, or, in some
desperate need, he orders goods for which he cannot pay, disposes
of them; or, being in some position of trust, employs money which
is not his own, but which he hopes to make good in time to avoid
detection. In this category you may find the fallen bank clerk,
the agent, the embezzling solicitor and the postal official. Very
few of these, however, reach what could be truthfully described
as the underworld. They are saved by their relations and friends
and never appear in the records of Scotland Yard. Only a minute
proportion use their first conviction as a jumping-off place for
a life of crime.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-09-11"></a>THE MAKING OF BURGLARS</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Leeds Mercury</i>, 11 September 1928</h3>
<hr>

<h3>Why Young People Go Wrong.</h3>

<p class="first">THERE is no criminal state, as I have said
before, nor could there be, since lawbreakers are intensely
uninterested in their kind. Take the average criminal and talk
with him for a quarter of an hour on general subjects and then
suddenly switch the conversation over to some nine-day wonder of
crime which is filling the public eye. Instantly he is bored. He
neither praises the ingenuity of the gang which has broken into a
Hatton Garden store and removed jewellery of a fabulous value,
nor does he express the slightest curiosity as to the means
adopted. </p>

<p>He is self-centred, and some little adventure of his own in
the past is an ever so much more interesting topic for
discussion. He is, however, ready and willing to discuss past
contemporaries in his own line of business. He has a queer
perverted pride in his own particular graft. If he is a
pickpocket, the exploit of a confidence man may arouse a slight
flicker of enthusiasm, because there is a certain association
between pickpockets and the small fry in the confidence
world.</p>

<h3>Preliminary "Training."</h3>

<p class="first">IT is very often the case that the various sorts
of specialists, burglars, cheap card sharps&mdash;the type you
meet in race trains&mdash;and little thieves have served at some
time or other as temporary "whizzers" (pickpockets). Pickpockets
who "work" the buses in rush hours usually operate in gangs of
three and four. One of them might be an expert "dipper," the
others cover his movements or act as minders to facilitate his
escape. The minders are, as a rule, men of brute intelligence and
brute in every other respect. The unskilled laborer in the field
of crime is certain sooner or later to gravitate to one of these
gangs. Pickpocketing is also regarded as the last resort of an
aged criminal.</p>

<p>This type of lawbreaker has a certain wit which does the duty
of intelligence. It is hardly fair to describe it as low
cunning.</p>

<h3>Metal Button Clue</h3>

<p class="first">ONE of the most important police officers in
London was once called to the scene of a burglary. An entrance
had been effected in an upper window and some goods were stolen.
The only clue&mdash;and it was an important one&mdash;was the
discovery on the window sill of a metal button. The detective
remembered seeing a man, an old acquaintance of his, wearing a
fancy waistcoat with buttons of that particular character, and he
immediately went in search of his man. He had not gone far before
he encountered the subject. A quick glance at him showed him that
one button of the waistcoat was missing, and it was a case of
"come round to the station with me."</p>

<p>The man was interrogated, told the usual lies, and, as he was
an old offender, when he was charged at the Police Court, was
committed for trial. In those days the police procedure was a
little different from what it is today. When the case came up at
the Old Bailey (or the Sessions, I am not sure which) the
detective went into the witness box, gave his evidence, other
witnesses were put in, and the prisoner raised no objection. The
case was proved to the hilt until the moment the prisoner was
asked if he had anything to say in his defense. He was still
wearing the waistcoat he had on when he was arrested, and this he
indicated to the jury.</p>

<h3>An Ingenious Defence.</h3>

<p class="first">"YOU have seen the button that the detective
showed you. I would like you to have a look at it again."</p>

<p>The jury examined the button.</p>

<p>"Now," said the prisoner, removing his waistcoat, "look at
this. It is true I have lost a button, but you will find the
shank is still sewn on! The button you have in your hand has a
shank on it. Did you ever hear of any button with two
shanks?"</p>

<p>There was no answer to this and the man was acquitted. What
had happened was that while he was awaiting trial somebody had
smuggled in a shank of a button, a needle and thread, and he had
sewn it on!</p>

<p>There are hundreds of instances of similar ingenuity, and yet
that ingenuity would have been unnecessary if the prisoner had
had the sense to realise that he had lost a button of his
waistcoat in the course of his escapade, and had sewn on another.
He was so clever that he was back again at the Old Bailey on
another charge in a few months, and was set down to a term of
penal servitude.</p>

<h3>Wilful Slackers.</h3>

<p class="first">IT is hardly true that unemployment drives an
honest man to crime, and it was not true even before the days of
the dole. The recruit for the underworld is drawn, and always has
been drawn, from the wilfully unemployed, the young man who
prefers to lie snug in bed to obeying the factory hooter in the
dull, dark hours of the morning, who desires independence, rather
than face the deadly monotony of a regular job.</p>

<p>The first steps from rectitude are so remote that it is very
difficult to find a criminal who can remember where he began his
first acts of lawlessness.</p>

<p>As a child I was daily brought into contact with other
children who were regular and systematic thieves, yet who stole
for no profit. They were boys who were employed at printer's
works and would bring home handfuls of new type and display it to
their admiring friends: boys employed in boot warehouses, who
would steal the cheaper kind of ladies' shoes without having the
slightest use for them. There were other boys  who worked at the
docks, and scarcely a day passed that they did not come home with
their pockets bulging with contraband of a more negotiable
character.</p>

<h3>Finding a "Receiver."</h3>

<p class="first">THESE young people definitely go over to a life
of lawlessness just as soon as they can discover a receiver who
would give them cash for their "finds." In some districts and in
certain circles the receiver is very easy to find. In others the
thief does not come in contact with this poisonous individual and
drifts back to honesty and decency under the influence of home
and respectable associates. Once the receiver is found and stolen
goods can be converted into spendable money, a new outlook on
life is established. The youth gets so much money from his
illicit games that he forgets that it is necessary for him to
maintain himself in regular employment.</p>

<p>He is either found out or dismissed and he finds himself on
the world without money and no desire for regular work and a
pressing need for cash. It requires a certain amount of character
to go back to regular employment, however great may be the
opportunities for pilfering and so he drifts to a life of
pilfering alone, and is definitely criminalised. To him there is
no underworld. He is an individualist, as I have said before: his
comrades may have a loose value as assistants, confederates,
directors of new operations or organisers. Fagins there may be,
but they do not play a considerable part. </p>

<h3>The Real Fagin.</h3>

<p class="first">THE real Fagin is the receiver, and if these
gentry received automatically twice the normal sentences usually
passed upon them for all offences where they have purchased from
thieves under the age of 21, the heavy work of the police might
be considerably lightened.</p>

<p>What does frequently happen is that the kind of honest
employment that a young man followed before he went crook
determines the character of his subsequent depredations. For
example, most of the stealers of material, such as silk, cloth,
furs, are men who have been honestly employed either in the
warehousing or handling of these commodities.</p>

<p>A type of crime frequently met with is the stealing of vans
containing goods ready for delivery. The carman has gone into a
coffee house for breakfast accompanied by his van boy. Whilst he
is absent somebody gets into the van and drives off to an
unfrequented spot, where the goods contained in the wagon are
looted.</p>

<p>It is pretty certain that one or other of the thieves
concerned in this robbery has been at some time carman engaged in
the delivery of goods, and not only so, but in the particular
variety of goods that are found in the van,</p>

<h3>Inside Knowledge.</h3>

<p class="first">IT is the same with warehouse robberies. One or
other of the thieves has become acquainted with the routine of
some particular warehouse or shop, has got to know the habits of
the staff and has a very intimate acquaintance with the kind of
goods that are to be found on the premises. To some extent this
facilitates the work of the police in their business of
detection. They are able to classify the various varieties of
larcenists and burglars, and they know that when new houses in
course of erection have been entered by night and lead pipes and
brass taps stolen, the job has been done by a specialist in this
kind of theft.</p>

<p>This fact was brought home to me some years ago when I was
present during the  hearing of a charge against a man who had
broken into a rectory and had stolen some silver. When the jury
returned a verdict of guilty and his previous convictions were
read out, three out of four were concerned with the breaking into
clergymen's houses. The man before he adopted a life of crime,
had been a handy man at a rectory and probably his idea of wealth
and luxury was circumscribed in the mental picture of a well-
furnished house of a priest.</p>

<h3>The Burglar's Choice.</h3>

<p class="first">I ALWAYS thought the everyday burglar who
devotes himself to the "busting" of dwelling houses has
particular predilections and yet I was told by a police officer
of a very wide acquaintance that burglars as a rule specialise in
a certain type of house. Some, for example, never "operated" on
houses that hadn't a basement, others would burgle nothing but
non-basement houses. It is not an infrequent experience when new
villas are put up in the suburbs&mdash;especially the villas of a
substantial type&mdash;for the "professionals" to go over the
empty houses to make themselves acquainted with the general
layout of the rooms.</p>

<p>It is an extraordinary fact that although burglars are very
timid and nervous (those who have had the unpleasant experience
of having burglars in the house will testify to the fact, for
they live ball the time in terror of a burly householder with a
gun in his hand), they very rarely desert this form of robbery
for any other.</p>

<p>Burglary, of course, is the easiest of crime; requires less
ingenuity than any other. I do not know the exact figures, but it
is the fact that more empty houses are burgles than "live"
ones&mdash;a live one being a house that is occupied.</p>

<p>The ideal venue is the house or flat from which the owner is
absent on a holiday. It is only the younger and more reckless
members of the craft who will dare to break into a house knowing
somebody is sleeping on the premises.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-09-12"></a>WOMEN BLACKMAILERS</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Leeds Mercury</i>, 12 September 1928</h3>
<hr>

<h3>How Wealthy Provincials are Trapped in London.</h3>

<p class="first">THE West End of London is the haunt of criminals
of a peculiar type. They are the luxury traders and live on
folly, not of  the rich, but the "flush." The "flush" are people
who, without having any definite source of wealth, have for the
moment an unusual accumulation of money.</p>

<p>People on holidays, visitors from foreign lands, men cutting a
dash on money they have saved or accumulated by legal or illicit
means, well-to-do folk from the provincial centres&mdash;all
these are material for the "con-men," the card sharps and
blackmailers who gather in considerable numbers when London is
"full." All these have in reserve, or in active co-operation,
women of a certain class. One of the most dangerous gangs that
ever operated in the Metropolis was that governed by a very
attractive woman, who had an intelligence department deserving of
a better end.</p>

<h3>Her Specialities</h3>

<p class="first">SHE specialised in middle-aged men of substance,
town Councilors from Midland towns, aldermen, J.P.s. She had a
detailed list of all the wealthy public men in the country. She
could afford to wait, living in a first-class hotel until a
likely victim came along. Once the "subject" was found, her work
was fairly simple. She chose her men very wisely, became
acquainted with them, and after a succession of hectic little
supper parties, allowed her prey to go back to his respectable
home and his public duties with no apprehension in his mind that
there was coming another day of reckoning.</p>

<p>Then, one afternoon when Mr. Mayor or Mr. Alderman was
speaking sedately on the subject of town lighting at Council
meeting, an angry voice would be heard in the corridor outside, a
lady demanding stridently that Mr. X should be informed
immediately that she was waiting. When, in terror, he hurried out
to her it was with the greatest difficulty he stilled her shrill
voice and brought her to the privacy of his room.</p>

<h3>"Hush Money" Trick.</h3>

<p>She had a husband (she said) who had discovered "everything,"
she must go to Mr. Alderman's wife and ask her to help her. . .
.</p>

<p>Mr. Alderman paid hush money&mdash;not once, but many times.
One Mr. Alderman, in despair, hanged himself in his wine cellar.
</p>

<p>The police knew of this, but could get no evidence; no victim
would testify against her. Deportation was not so easy to secure
in those days&mdash;she was an alien&mdash;and she might have
gone on with impunity if she had not committed the fatal error of
getting herself mixed up in a shooting affray. That little affair
cost her fifteen years of liberty, for once the police got her in
their hands, they worked up such a case against her that she had
no chance of escaping with a light sentence.</p>

<h3>A Similar Type.</h3>

<p class="first">THERE was another woman, more attractive who,
until a year ago, was working the same trick with greater
success. She is young and pretty, beautifully gowned, rides in a
most expensive car, and has, or has had, a suite at one of the
best hotels. She chooses the young man about town&mdash;the
wealthy do-nothing, whose income and circumstances are very
easily ascertainable. </p>

<p>She is difficult to get acquainted with, knows to the Nth
degree the value of suspense, has given a commercial value to
reluctance and hesitation. Her graft is to lure her man to a
hopeless compromising situation and then demand money on the
threat of charging her victim with an offense.</p>

<p>I would not dare, even if there were no law of libel, to give
you a list of the people who have been caught and have paid.</p>

<h3>Women Assistants.</h3>

<p class="first">LESSER women assistants attach themselves to
every coterie of blackmailers and town sharps; they need very
little description, and that not of the politest kind. Their
value both as principals and helpers is obvious. It is they who
act as hostesses at the little supper parties, which are
followed by cards. There are scores of furnished houses and flats
taken for the season, and I remember one case where a house in
the street in which I am living was rented at £100 a week. The
lordly owner did not know that his beautiful home was being used
as a gambling club until he read, to his horror, that it had been
raided by the police! In this case women were used as decoys.</p>

<p>A "chance" meeting (usually maneuvered) between a very pretty
girl and the "right" man on the river at an open-air club
somewhere round London should be followed by the inevitable
"Where can I see you again?"</p>

<p>What was easier than to arrange a dinner and, after a call at
the gaming house on the pretext that she had to see somebody to
put off a supper engagement?</p>

<p>The beginning of the women criminals are drably and sadly
alike. I have never met with nor heard of a woman crook who
committed any illegal act in the days of her innocency. In a very
large number of cases there is a treacherous man and an unwanted
child in the background. Prostitution is not a consequence, but a
cause of crime. I do not, of course refer to that peculiar type
of offense which is entirely and absolutely distinct, except in
isolated cases, from the general practice of
criminality&mdash;shoplifting. The majority of shoplifters are
amateurs in the sense that they live respectable lives, have very
often husbands in good employment and, in some cases, well to do.
The practice is almost a vice, since there is practically nothing
at all to be gained. The exception is the class of shop thieves
who operate in gangs. As a rule they choose a suburb of London
or some nearby town, and go off in a party from six to ten,
dividing when they reach the town, and each taking some
predetermined area of operation. In suburbs like, for example,
Kingston, Wimbledon and, farther afield, Watford, Southend-on-
Sea,and in other seaside towns, they are certain to find shops
which do not employ any of those pestilential detectives who are
on duty in London stores and whose duty it is to keep suspects
under observation.</p>

<h3>Systematic Gangs.</h3>

<p class="first">THESE little gangs work most systematically,
expenses are divided amongst them and certain allowances made for
refreshments and when the haul has been made and disposed of the
profits are equally divided.</p>

<p>There is, or was, quite a number of these gangs having their
base in the East End of London, and only very recently the police
arrested one such crowd in a watering place on the East Coast.
Almost every one of them had a shoplifting history and one or two
were wanted for petty pilfering.</p>

<p>This set more nearly approximates to a "gang" than any other
within my knowledge.</p>

<p>From the area where these women are to be found emanates the
professional servant thief. The police have records of scores of
women who do nothing but take situations as domestic servants.
Their imposing credentials are forged and they usually take the
precaution of entering their names at a first-class registry
office. Naturally the agent takes up their references and finds
that they are all they claim to be, and more.</p>

<h3>Excellent References.</h3>

<p class="first">ABOUT twenty years ago there used to be a place
in Essex which bore the imposing name of Manor Hall (this is not
the name, but I don't give the real title, in case there is a
more pretentious dwelling with that name). Mr. Jones, who desired
a butler and a cook-housekeeper, was referred to Manor Hall and
heard of the excellent service which the couple had rendered
during "the past ten years." The letter was invariably written in
lady-like hand in the third person. The paper bore a crest and
was embossed with the gratuitous information that the nearest
railway station was Snelborough. But the Manor Hall was a small
cottage owned by a lady who had long ceased to follow her
profession and earned a very good livelihood as a late employer
of undesirable people. I am relying on my memory, but I have an
impression that the Manor Hall was not the only name this cottage
bore.</p>

<h3>Telephone Talks</h3>

<p class="first">THE telephone has been of great use to the
dishonest servant. A lady in a hurry to hire a cook very often
does not trouble to write, but if a telephone number is given
will call up the "late employer" and accept an ecstatic estimate
of the new servant's virtues.</p>

<p>The crook servant is not long in the house before she
understands exactly the possibilities of her new job. Only the
cheaper kind steal articles of jewelry. The more experienced type
will wait until she has the opportunity of securing a return
worth while. There are cases on record where the patient thief
has waited for months until the family had gone on a holiday and
then has cleared every piece of valuable furniture from the
house.</p>

<p>The woman thief is always more dangerous because she is least
suspected. Somehow, you never think of a woman as a trained
thief. She invariably dresses infinitely better than the man of
her class. She takes trouble with her voice and, if she is
attractive, uses what charms she possesses to still further
disarm her dupe.</p>

<h3>Few Women Burglars.</h3>

<p class="first">THE woman burglar is practically nonexistent.
Burglary is a manual work. There are roofs to be climbed, windows
to be forced. Moreover, a woman in a deserted street late at
night attracts more attention than a man.</p>

<p>Another peculiar fact is that the woman forger is practically
unknown although one would imagine that with their delicate touch
they would be able to make a better job of the work than a
man.</p>

<p>On the other hand, women counterfeiters are numerous. They
belong to a lower strata of society. Perhaps it is that there is
some latent chivalry&mdash;although I have never met with
it&mdash;which makes them reluctant to involve a woman in a crime
for which there is such a very heavy sentence.</p>

<p>In one branch of criminality, however, women play a very
ignoble part&mdash;they are expert blackmailers. I would like to
give a separate chapter to these pests, the most deadly of
all.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-09-13"></a>MORE BLACKMAILERS</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>Vanity in Men that Means Danger.</h3>

<p class="first">ORGANIZED blackmail is not a "trade" in the
sense that there is a class of persons which deliberately sets
itself to gain a livelihood by extracting money under threats. We
hear of "blackmail gangs" and occasionally see the conviction of
several people who, acting together have extracted money from
some unfortunate person, but as a general rule, blackmail is an
accidental crime which may be repeated should opportunity offer,
and may in certain cases, become a system.</p>

<p>I am thinking more of male offenders; the women are in a class
by themselves.</p>

<p>There is a type of systematic criminal who falls under the
description and who is familiar to the police and to the
public.</p>

<p>These are the men who dog the footsteps of country couples and
appear at an embarrassing moment, representing themselves as
police officers and demanding money as an alternative to arrest.
These cases are frequently met with in the Court.</p>

<h3>Without Scruples.</h3>

<p class="first">BUT the average blackmailer is an unscrupulous
person, who uses knowledge acquired by accident to extract money.
In the United States systematic blackmail is much more frequently
met with, for the laws of America and the free and easy method by
which private detectives are given power which in this country
are restricted to the police, offers the blackmailer greater
scope. One of the greatest of American detectives calculated that
a million dollars a year was taken by blackmailers in the city of
New York alone.</p>

<p>The Mann act was, and probably still is, a prolific source of
income to these gentry. Under this act it is a felony to take any
woman from one State to another for immoral purposes. Working in
collaboration with an attractive member of the oldest profession,
the blackmailers reaped, and still reap a rich harvest. It was
easy enough to induce a dupe to cross from New York to Jersey
City&mdash;which is equivalent to a journey from Fleet Street to
Blackfriars. Here the pair would be discovered by a spurious
detective, with the result that the man paid, and paid heavily,
to keep himself out of the Courts.</p>

<p>The blackmailer whom we know has his beginning in the chance
discovery of his victim's failings, follies or delinquencies.</p>

<p>Here are a few cases I can recall without consulting my
books:</p>

<h3>Created by the Victim.</h3>

<p class="first">A. was a married lady who had an affair with a
Canadian officer. Her maid, under notice to leave, found a number
of letters from the lover, and taking these away with her, she,
on the advice of a married sister, and smarting under the refusal
of her late employer to give her a "character," wrote hinting at
the possession of information and the effect this might have on
the lady's husband. The lady very foolishly sent money and
thereafter paid regular tribute. The blackmailer in this case was
created by the victim.</p>

<p class="first">B. was a professional man who had assisted a
girl in bringing about an illegal operation. The girl's sister
demanded money ostensibly to send her sister ion continuous
holiday, necessitated by the state of her health.</p>

<p class="first">C. was a man who had embezzled the money of his
employers. His relations found the money to pay the employers,
but the correspondence between the firm and the culprit fell onto
the hands of a young man who was walking with C's maid.</p>

<p>Blackmailers seldom demand money on a direct threat of
exposure. He or she invariably asks for a loan either to leave
the country, to pay the cost of an illness, or to pay bills
incurred through the supposed fault of the victim, and the threat
is as invariably oblique.</p>

<p>Here is a typical peroration to such a letter:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"...I feel I must go abroad. I am desperate. I
will come up to your house to-morrow night. I am sure your wife
would have pity on me and lend me money...."</p>

<h3>The Fruit of Alarm.</h3>

<p class="first">THERE is a tremendous amount of this kind of
blackmail going on. The victim knows that if he informs his
solicitor a prosecution will follow. Of late it has been the
practice of all decent newspapers to suppress the name and
address of a man or woman who prosecutes a charge of extracting
money, but very often it is not public exposure that the victim
fears, but the enlightenment of his or her own family circle on
the subject of past stupidities.</p>

<p>Men are more particularly susceptible to the operations of the
blackmailer, because of their extraordinary vanity.</p>

<p>The conceit of the male is past belief. Many years ago I was
making inquiries in a celebrated murder case, and, as is the
usual experience in the investigations of a reporter, my
questions were addressed to many unsavory people and in many
peculiar quarters.</p>

<h3>A Staggering Discovery.</h3>

<p class="first">THE criminal was well known to a certain type of
woman, and we limited our inquiries to three of these, two of
whom lived in Bloomsbury and one in Fulham. Their homes were in
no sense houses of a dubious character. Two of them had flats and
one had a furnished suite of rooms in a seemingly respectable
house, though of this I had my doubts.</p>

<p>What was to me a staggering discovery was that in each of
these women's rooms I found scores of photographs of decent men,
some obviously in a good position, and not only their
photographs, but also their cards displayed upon the mantelpiece.
Every photograph was affectionately inscribed, and I have never
seen such a perfect jumping-off place for a blackmailer in all my
life. The photographs were mostly taken by recognised West End
photographers, and some of the cards had the men's club
inscribed. I asked the girls whether this was the usual
practice.</p>

<p>"O, yes," said one. "A man likes to think that he is
particularly favored by a girl, and he usually manages to work up
a little sentimental interest in her."</p>

<h3>Man's Vanity.</h3>

<p class="first">THE display of these photographs, of course, was
merely an expression of the woman's desire for respectability.
She wished to show those of her intimate acquaintances who called
the kind of friendS she had. That is easily explained. There is
no other explanation of the folly of those men who deliver their
characters and their careers into the hands of a prostitute,
except this overweening vanity which is almost beyond
analysis.</p>

<p>There is among those women a certain code of honour which
covers the majority. There are others, however, who are not thus
bound, and it occasionally happens that men had had to pay very
dearly for their lapse from righteousness. A police officer who
would have been a member of the Morality Squad if there had been
a Morality Squad at Scotland Yard, told me that it is very rare,
indeed, that professional women engage in the trade of blackmail,
and there are others for whom blackmail is the first
consideration, and their mode of life merely a means to live.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-09-14"></a>THE RARE DESPERADO</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Leeds Mercury</i>, 14 September 1928</h3>
<hr>


<h3>A New Light on Some of Our Gangsters.</h3>

<p class="first">GREAT BRITAIN differs from all other countries
in that offences against the person are comparatively small. In
America the hold-up man is a familiar phenomenon, and that some
unfortunate pedestrian has been "beaten up" and robbed, or a bank
manager has been shot down and the money in his charge stolen,
are common items of news. In Germany there are quite a number of
crimes every year where people have been murdered for their
money, and whilst I was in Berlin a month ago I was shown a
photograph of a woman who had her throat cut by another woman for
a few marks.</p>

<p>This type of crime in Britain is rare. Going back over the
criminals who have been executed in this country during the past
few years, I can only recall three outstanding figures, two of
whom were concerned inn the same crime&mdash;Kennedy and
Browne&mdash;and a few years ago&mdash;Seddon.</p>

<p>It is a peculiar fact that whenever criminals have stolen and
murdered violently, as distinct from poisoning their victims, two
men have invariably been concerned. To Browne and Kennedy we add
Donovan and Wade, the brothers Stratton and the two Muswell Hill
murderers. The habitual criminal never seems to take life when
engaged in his nefarious occupation unless he has the co-
operation of another, which is remarkable, since criminals are
very suspicious of each other, and are always guarding themselves
against betrayal even by their best friends.</p>

<h3>The Normal Burglar Not Violent.</h3>

<p class="first">IT is difficult to understand this mentality,
but possibly when a criminal is accompanied by another and
commits an act of violence, he has the illusion that his
responsibilities is halved. The normal burglar&mdash;if this is
not a contradiction of term&mdash;has a terror of violence, and
as I have said before, some men have flatly refused to go on a
"job" if a member of the gang had firearms in his possession.</p>

<p>If he carries a jemmy&mdash;it is for what he regards as a
legitimate purpose, but very seldom do the police  in searching
an arrested burglar discover so much as a life preserver in his
pocket. There are exceptions, but these amongst the young
amateurs, who do not realise the terrible danger they run and the
sentence which will come their way if they are found in
possession of a loaded revolver</p>

<p>It is not amongst the higher grades of criminals that you find
violent propensities. The murder which led to the siege of Sidney
Street was carried out by Russian aliens, and men like Browne and
Kennedy are rare. Kennedy by the way, was the man who is believed
to have shot Gutteridge through the eye when he was lying in the
ground, and not Browne, and that is why Kennedy did not go into
the box.</p>

<p>It is amongst the lower strata&mdash;the pickpockets and sneak
thieves, the pests that haunt places where the public gather in
any number, who come either to steal or to assist in the three-
card  trick&mdash;that crimes of violence are very common.</p>

<h3>Living Near the Border Line.</h3>

<p class="first">IT is always very amusing to me to read in
newspapers of "racecourse  gangs" abiding in the East End of
London. It is true that these rival sections are frequenters of
racecourses. They are also to be found at football matches, in
the crowds that gather to see Royalty pass and even on Armistice
Day in the neighbourhood of the Cenotaph. They live on great
congregations and depend upon confusion occasioned by public
gatherings to cover their escape. It is not true that they have
any special association with racing.</p>

<p>My experience has been that a racecourse, especially since the
energetic action of the Stewards, and, I think, Sir Samuel Scott,
is a very safe place. Fights between factions occur from time to
time and earn a little undesirable publicity. There are in London
a number of small clubs frequented by the least desirable
elements of our population.</p>

<p>I do not suggest that all the members are dishonest, but a
very large proportion of them live on what passes for their
wits&mdash;very near to the border-line that separates the lawful
from the unlawful. These places are more or less gaming clubs and
the frequenters include the smaller fry amongst bookmakers, a
certain type of thief and that odd collection of people who seem
to live without any visible means of support.</p>

<p>One writer said such a place as the Leopard Club, which I have
put into my play, "The Squeaker," was purest imagination, but I
have known a several such clubs, which smart people have
patronised for the thrill of it. There was one, a little better
than the others, existing for a long time within a hundred paces
of Piccadilly Circus. It had its premises underground, and there
once I saw a most ghastly fight between two men, the spectators
being "ladies and gentlemen," if one may judge their quality by
the fashion and richness of their attire.</p>

<p>The new generation scoffs at the existence of such places, but
who does not remember that little hotel in Lower Regent Street,
the forerunner of all disreputable night clubs, and the amazing
scenes which could be witnessed between one and two in the
morning? But who does not know the bar where every thief and
confidence man in London was wont to gather, and that other bar
situated within a stone's throw of Piccadilly and Bond Street, in
a very fashionable thoroughfare, where at five o'clock in the
afternoon you could find a crowd of three hundred people, mainly
consisting of swindlers of all varieties, and the demi-mondaine?
Police action has done no more than drive these people into new
haunts and new meeting places, and the process has been
facilitated by the coming of the motor-car.</p>

<h3>A Violent Feud.</h3>

<p class="first">LIKE the gangster of Chicago, the criminal who
indulges in violent acts usually confines his fences to members
of his own profession. A few months ago one of these men started
a "spieling" club in the neighbourhood of Edgware Road. A
"spieling" club is a gambling house where baccarat and similar
games are played not for the enticement of the possible "mug"
though he is always welcome, but for the amusement of the "boys"
themselves. One night, when business was slack, three men came
and were properly introduced. They had not been there for a
quarter of an hour when one of them picked up a bottle and
knocked out the proprietor of the club, took his winnings and
disappeared. Here was the beginning of a bloody feud which lasted
for a long time, and which,is still going on, but in the course
of this no innocent person outside the coteries concerned has
been injured.</p>

<p>In one respect there is honour amongst thieves: the man,
picked up battered almost beyond recognition  will never divulge
the name of his assailant, possibly because he thinks that he can
visit the offender with a far greater punishment than the law
would inflict, and because he does not wish to draw suspicion
upon himself when that vengeance is accomplished.</p>

<h3>Deterring Punishments.</h3>

<p class="first">GREAT BRITAIN stands almost alone in the
security of the law-abiding citizens against physical violence on
the part of the members of the criminal classes. They enjoy
almost what is tantamount to immunity and this is traceable
directly to the operations of the law. Garotters and other kinds
of criminals who have used violence for gain, were practically
stamped out when Mr. Justice Day ordered flogging. Strangely
enough the majority of the underworld offers a complete approval
not only to flogging as a punishment, but also to capital
punishment. It will be an unfortunate day when misguided
humanitarians abolish either punishment which is very sparingly
awarded, but which has an amazingly deterrent effect.</p>

<p>The humanitarian points to the fact that when the death
penalty was exacted for theft, highway robbery, sheep stealing,
etc., the spectacle of the criminal on his way to Tyburn was far
from discouraging. The crime for which he suffered brought new
recruits to the underworld. Unconsciously they offer an
explanation why this should be. The real value of capital
punishment lies in the secrecy of its operation and the
psychological  effect it has upon the people it is meant to
intimidate.</p>

<p>Public executions were spectacles, the malefactor being the
centre of interest and, for a number of dreadful moments the hero
of the situation. The horror of capital punishment from the
criminal's point of view is its mystery.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-09-15"></a>COMING OUT OF GAOL</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Leeds Mercury</i>, 15 September
1928</h3>

<hr>

<h3>The Difficulty of Going Straight Without a Job.</h3>

<p class="first">A VERY large proportion of humanity is
fundamentally dishonest, but does not live by cheating, but only
a small section of the fundamentally dishonest gain their living
by breaking either the written or the moral law. As I have said
before, they are individualists, unless they are working in
coteries.</p>

<p>It may be convenient for the purpose of description to
describe these as "gangs," but they are not gangs in the sense of
the old gangs our fathers knew; in fact, the gangster spirit
(that is to say, the community of lawlessness) is never
established except in prison, which moulds all men into a
criminal type.</p>

<p>It is loosely said that burglaries and fences against the law
are very often planned in prison, and I have no doubt that
convicts, when they meet, especially with the end of their
sentence in sight, do discuss the illicit possibilities of the
future.</p>

<p>But as far as convict prisons are concerned, the men who go
out to liberty intending at the earliest opportunity to commit a
particular crime, are very few indeed. Their desire is very
naturally to avoid further imprisonment, and the large majority
of them, assisted by various societies, do make an effort to
secure work.</p>

<h3>The Half-Hearted</h3>

<p class="first">IN the majority of cases they are unskilled
labourers, they have no Trade Union ticket, even as general
labourers, and they are quite unfitted to begin a battle of life
against the severe competition which they find in a free
world.</p>

<p>One meets these half-hearted people wandering aimlessly and
pathetically around London, looking for suitable employment,
knowing in their heart of hearts that, unless a miracle happens,
that employment can never be obtained. It is difficult enough for
honest men, who have never seen the inside of a prison gate, to
find employment&mdash;it is almost impossible for the ex-
criminal. The jobs they ask for are within the scope of their
talents. They wish to be messengers, caretakers or watchmen;
which may, at first sight, seem a remarkable desire, and to cover
some sinister plans for the future&mdash;for the messenger will
carry, the caretaker will protect and the watchman will obviously
observe property of some value, and in all three occupations the
very highest credentials are required by employers.</p>

<p>They may get work on the roads, but here again, unless road
work is provided by benevolent municipalities for out-of-works,
there is no opening even in this field of labour. The Salvation
Army and similar missions do a certain amount of work, in that
they collect the indigent and give them employment, which,
however, is too reminiscent of casual ward and prison labour to
have much attraction.</p>

<h3>Betting.</h3>

<p class="first">BETTING is a prolific cause of first offence,
but very rarely the cause of second and third offence. The
pilferer of stamps and tills, the secretary of small clubs who
finds it convenient to vanish before the Christmas share-out, the
cashier, the barman, who rings a "no sale" on a cash register and
takes out from the till the amount he should have put in, these
are what I would describe the "opportunity thieves" who do not
properly belong to the underworld, and will never reach that
dingy region unless they are entirely devoid of character.</p>

<p>Drunkenness is no longer a remarkable cause of crime. A safe-
breaker told me that he had only once "operated" with a "boozer,"
and that he preferred men like himself who were total abstainers.
Drink may be, and probably is, the explanation for a great deal
of petty fences such as fighting, embezzlement, wounding etc, but
one does not meet, nowadays, any authentic cases of young men who
have been brought to a criminal career through this form of self-
indulgence. If one does, it is usually found that they had
already contracted criminal associations.</p>

<h3>Boys' Clubs</h3>

<p class="first">WHAT is badly needed, and particularly in large
industrial areas, are boys' clubs and compulsory evening classes.
Something more than this is desirable&mdash;that the evening
classes shall conform to the real requirements of the poor. Van
boys would not waste their nights learning bookkeeping, French
and three varieties of art; they want to be taught something that
will be of use, something that will open new vistas and will be a
counter-attraction to the alluring picture of wealth without
work, which the underworld draws for them.</p>

<h3>Shame</h3>

<p class="first">THE gang-formers are, as I have said before, the
prisons. It is only here that lawless men meet on community
terms, having nothing else to unite their interests but their
past misdemeanors. The real curse of the prison is that it may
remove from the young delinquent all sense of shame for his past
iniquities. In China, where "soldier" was once a term of
reproach, there was a saying: "In the army no man feels ashamed."
Prison familiarises the novice with a new habit of thought. Right
and wrong are substituted by expediency and inexpediency.</p>

<p>There is a system by which the young offender is kept from
contact with the older criminal. In theory this system is quite
workable&mdash;in reality, of course, many things happen in prisons
which are contrary to the spirit and letter of law. The young
offender may not actually meet a man with many convictions, but
there is a sort of oblique contact.</p>

<h3>Novices Impressed</h3>

<p class="first">THE idea that the old lag instructs the novice
in the art and practice of crime has little foundation in fact,
though he is very often an inspiration; you can imagine the
effect on the first offender who, day after day and week after
week, has pointed out to him the notabilities of the underworld
and their exploits described to him in tones of awe. A man has to
have many convictions against his name before he actually uses
the friendships which are established in prison for the
development of crimes when he is released. That was why Browne,
in the Gutteridge case, was so remarkable a character.</p>

<p>The segregation of first offenders does not, of course, apply
to convict establishments, and at Dartmoor special privilege must
be earned. I still believe that the adoption in this country of
the system of suspended sentences would go a long way towards
relieving the calendar of second fences. If the postal official,
the defaulted clerk, the embezzler, instead of being sent to
association with the criminal classes, was released immediately
the sentence was passed, the taxpayer would be saved considerable
expense and the society would benefit. The suspended sentence is
tantamount to the system of ordering a man to come up for
judgment when called upon.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-09-17"></a>FOREIGN CROOKS</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Leeds Mercury</i>, 17 September
1928</h3>

<hr>

<h3>Dangerous Men in the Trains.</h3>

<p class="first">LONDON is the meeting place, but not the
headquarters of certain groups of crooks. Paris has the dubious
distinction of being their more or less permanent home. The
nationality of the international crowd is overwhelmingly
American; this enterprising race has even ousted the shady racing
hanger-on from his once unassailable position. You could almost
count the British international criminal on the fingers of two
hands.</p>

<p>The British are not good linguists, or, what is more nearly
true, they have not the same nerve to speak bad French and German
as Americans do.</p>

<p>Though France and Germany can produce some very interesting
homicides, they do not produce in the bulk such skilled offenders
against the laws of property as America and Britain. The genius
of the German burglar, swindler and shoplifter, however,
transcends similar criminals of other nations. He does not
operate on the scale of the big "bank smasher," and he has fewer
opportunities of making big hauls than has his prototype of
London and New York. But what he does he does well and
thoroughly.</p>

<p>In the Berlin Kriminalmuseum I saw a most amazing collection
of tools and gadgets used by burglars. One was a thick batten of
wood, at the top of which was a steel spike tapering from a fine
point to a broad base. The burglars, working from below, put the
spike under the floor of a room they were "opening"; the other
end of the batten was put upon a big motor-car "jack," and with
this simple instrument the floor was forced.</p>

<h3>A Sense of Humour.</h3>

<p class="first">IN some respects the German criminal resembles
the British crook in that he possesses a very keen sense of
humour. Behind the museum where these implements are displayed is
a prison. One night a prisoner escaped, climbed up into the
museum, made a collection of tools likely to be of use to him
and, getting out of the building, burgled a jeweler's shop.</p>

<p>I saw here one or two interesting pieces of equipment used by
professional shop thieves. One was a cardboard dress box. It was
neatly wrapped in brown paper and tied up with string. On the
parcel was the label of a well-known firm in Berlin. The thief
carried this (there were two exhibits of different sizes) into a
store, laid it on the counter and proceeded to examine various
articles which he or she wished to purchase. In the course of
this examination various goods disappeared. Once or twice the
suspicious attendant called for the store detective, but nothing
was found, and the thief was allowed to go.</p>

<h3>A Mass of Cruel Spikes</h3>

<p class="first">UNFORTUNATELY for him, the criminal police were
consulted, and they very quickly got to the bottom (or the side)
of the mystery. The side of the parcel was a trap-door with a
spring to keep it closed. It was cleverly camouflaged and even a
close observer would have imagined that the neatly folded paper
representing the end of the parcel was the real thing. The thief
had only to push any article he wished to conceal through the
side of the parcel and it vanished, and even the most suspicious
of shop assistants would not imagine that, tucked away in that
sealed package, was the missing stock.</p>

<p>Though crimes of a certain unpleasant type are very common in
Germany, most of the instruments I saw used by thieves for their
defence were of French make. An innocent looking walking-stick
that, on a touch of the spring, became a mass of cruel spikes,
was quite a rarity in the gallery.</p>

<h3>The Hotel Thieves</h3>

<p class="first">YOU may roughly classify the Continental crook
into three categories: First, the big burglar gangs which make
fleeting visits from capital to capital; second, the swindlers,
which include the cardsharps, confidence men, cheque passers and
specialists in fraud generally; thirdly, the luggage thieves,
which include hotel and jewel thieves.</p>

<p>The police make bigger hauls of the third category than of any
other. They are to be found in Berlin, in Prague, Vienna and
other great centres, and I believe there are at this moment in
the German prisons quite a number of English confidence men. With
these latter, of course, the language presents no difficulty,
since they travel as British on British passports, and nobody
expects a true born Britain to understand any other than his
mother tongue.</p>

<h3>Train Robbers</h3>

<p class="first">THE French are, perhaps, the most expert train
thieves, and it is these, rather than the imported article, that
passengers to the Riviera in the season have most to fear. An
official of the Wagons-Lits told me once, that in the period
between when the conductor went into his cabin to sign some
necessary document and came out, an expert thief had entered
three compartments and escaped without detection. It is very
rare, however, that the Wagons-Lits coaches are robbed; a
stranger appearing in the middle of the night is instantly
detected, and the real danger comes from an apparently genuine
passenger who is travelling in the coaches.</p>

<p>Their dexterity is amazing. There have been instances of boxes
and money being removed from under a pillow without disturbing
the sleeper. There is one historic case where the whole of a bed
was searched without awakening the victim.</p>

<p>The train thieves have a very intimate knowledge of the
psychology of travellers, and they know exactly the places where
valuables may be hidden.</p>

<h3>Careless Women.</h3>

<p class="first">IT is remarkable that much more is not stolen,
remembering the haphazard method of passengers. I know a case of
a woman who invariably carries £6,000 in jewellery whenever she
goes abroad, and as invariably leaves her property in a small
dressing-bag, which could be stolen and thrown out of the window
to a confederate almost with the minimum chance of detection. Her
justification is that the jewel case is locked!</p>

<p>Enormous sums of money go across the Channel daily in the form
of jewels and actual cash. Not so very long ago I travelled from
Paris with a man who had £100,000 worth of pearls in his inside
breast pocket. He didn't tell me this till just before we got to
London, and I was relieved, because on the boat I spotted at
least two gentlemen who could have taken the coat off his back
without his knowing it. Happily, they were as ignorant as I.</p>

<h3>The Confidence Business.</h3>

<p class="first">THE dangerous body of crooks passing from London
to Paris are not out for immediate gain. They are in the
confidence business, and their job is to get acquainted with the
right kind of people. The journey, however is so short that only
the most expert of these generally ever succeed in establishing
confidence. It used to be the practice for one of these men to
engage a compartment from Calais to Paris, especially on days
like Saturdays, when the traffic was heavy.</p>

<p>There would always be a fair sprinkling of passengers who had
not made reservations, and these would be compelled to stand up
for the whole journey. As is usual, they pass along the coaches,
looking for accommodation, and he would wait until he had seen a
man whom he had marked down for treatment before he invited him
to share his luxurious solitude.</p>

<p>He invariably travelled with a valet and a beautiful luncheon
basket and offered hospitality to his guest. By the time they
reached Paris he and his victim were firm friends and the rest
was easy. Sometimes he would make the trip without a bite, but
more often than not he brought down his bird.</p>

<p>In this case the swindler was a perfect French scholar, spoke
two or three languages and had a flat in the most fashionable
part of Paris.</p>

<h3>An Ugly Underworld.</h3>

<p class="first">IN France, as distinct from Great Britain, there
is a very ugly underworld which has its roots in the basest soil,
and which is glorified and romanticised by the name of Apache.
These criminals have no especial interest except for their
brutality. They are thieves and the associates of thieves,
bullies, coiners and rather bungling burglars. The Apache class
is chiefly remarkable for its inefficiency in criminal
practices.</p>

<p>One expected to find the same type in Germany and Austria, but
curiously enough, though very naturally there are section of
society which live all the time in a state of war with the
police, and though the German criminal can outvie the worst in
brutality, the relationships between the police and the habitual
criminal classes are very much the same as between Scotland Yard
and their prey. The wicked attacks on isolated policemen, which
was once a feature of Parisian criminal life, have few parallels
in Germany. The nation is too well disciplined to permit the
growth of that spirit of organised lawlessness which animates the
underworld of France.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-09-18"></a>CRIMINAL GANGS</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Leeds Mercury</i>, 18 September
1928</h3>

<hr>

<h3>Terrorising the States</h3>

<p class="first">JUST now the United States, and especially
cities like Chicago and New York, but more especially Chicago,
are embarrassed by the presence of rival firms in the bootlegging
business&mdash;a rivalry which has been responsible for a terrible
number of murders, and which has produced a new type of criminal
and a new kind of crime.</p>

<p>Perhaps a brief history of the old gangs would not be amiss at
this point.</p>

<p>The earliest of these grew around the Speakeasies, where
people could buy illicit liquor, and which were established in
the region of the famous or infamous, Five Points. The first,
according to Mr. Herbert Asbury, who is an authority on the
subject was called the Forty Thieves, and it operated under one
Coleman. From this organization, which had its recognized
headquarters and routine, grew the Plug Uglies and the Dead
Rabbits, the latter being one of the most formidable and one of
the most dangerous gangs that existed in New York in the
'thirties. They were a ferocious and merciless crowd, and perhaps
the women members of the gang were the more formidable.</p>

<p>The Dead Rabbits owed their peculiar name to a deceased bunny
which was thrown into the room at one of the meetings of the
earlier gangsters. But these and a rival gang confined themselves
to fighting one another, and it was not until a much later period
that the gangster for profit came into existence.</p>

<h3>Murderers Protected</h3>

<p class="first">TAMMANY HALL recognized the value of these
existing gangs and there began that strange association between
this political institution and the riffraff of the city which was
to last for many years. The gangs became factors in politics;
they dragooned voters, terrorized political enemies and were not
above acting as "repeaters" at the polls.</p>

<p>The large majority of these gangs were entirely Irish&mdash;which
are unquestionably the easiest people in the world to tempt into
anything that has the appearance of hard fighting. They certainly
did much to establish Tammany in 1834, and in the great fire,
which destroyed thirteen acres of the financial district in the
following year, they turned looters and had a marvelous time.</p>

<p>It is not too much to say that the gangs dominated the life of
New York for many years. Almost a hundred years ago Tammany was
keeping faith with the ruffians it employed. Murderers were kept
out of prison, thieves could steal with impunity, with the
assurance that if, by bad luck, they were arrested, the political
bosses would secure them freedom.</p>

<p>Again and again the military were called out to keep these
gangsters in check. It is interesting to remember that the actor
Macready barely escaped from the Bowery with his life. He left
New York never to return.</p>

<p>The life which the lower strata of the gangs lived can only be
described as terrible. The squalor, the lack of sanitation, the
ghastly condition of their "homes" are indescribable. Human life
meant nothing. Strangers who strayed into the neighbourhood were
dragged into a cellar, killed and stripped and their naked bodies
thrown out.</p>

<h3>Powerless Police</h3>

<p class="first">THE police were almost powerless and seldom made
an arrest except after a terrible fight. In the infamous Fourth
Ward the law ceased to operate. Even in the earliest days the
prominent gangster was accorded royal honours at his funeral, and
it is told of Bill, a butcher, who lived a fortnight after he had
been shot through the heart by a rival gangster (his last words
were: "Goodbye, boys! I die a true American.") that he had a
funeral at which more than five thousand men attended and six
bands played dirges. The murderers it may be noted in passing,
were not convicted, and one of them became the leader of Tammany
Hall in the early seventies.</p>

<p>It was during the Civil War that the gangs showed their most
powerful activities. Strengthened by the scum of other cities,
they were powerful enough to defy not only the city authorities,
but the authorities of the Federal Government. This was during
the draft riots of '56. In that year a man named Wood was elected
as Mayor. He was a crook of crooks, a most dishonest official,
the type of man who, if there were a law in the land, would have
spent the remainder of his years in gaol. The keepers of the
gambling houses and saloon-keepers, however, gave him their
complete support, as also did the Dead Rabbits, which was by now
the dominating gang in New York city.</p>

<h3>An Election Fraud</h3>

<p class="first">THE method of election was a simple one. On the
night before the poll, Wood, who was already Mayor and was coming
up for his second term of election, gave all the police in the
city a furlough, with strict orders not to go near any of the
booths. Rioting immediately started between the Bowery gang and
the Dead Rabbits. No decent citizen could venture abroad. Mr Wood
secured the election, and, as was subsequently proved, at least
ten thousand of his votes were entirely fraudulent.</p>

<p>It was an amazing fact that the police force was at the
service of the criminal element, inasmuch as it was run by men
who had the nomination of the Dead Rabbits.</p>

<p>The really big trouble started when, by an act of legislation,
a Metropolitan Police Force was formed, with a board of
commissioners, who called upon Mayor Wood to disband the
Municipal Force. The Mayor instantly refused, and naturally had
the support of the men who were to be disbanded. A Street
Commissioner appointed by the Metropolitan Police Board, on going
to assume office, was most incontinently thrown into the street.
Warrants were issued for the Mayor's arrest and one of them was
given to an officer and executed, but the Mayor was instantly
rescued by the Municipal Police and the officer was thrown into
the street. Then followed a terrific fight between the
Metropolitan and the Municipals up and down the steps and
corridors of City Hall.</p>

<h3>Fighting Among Police</h3>

<p class="first">THE next move was to call in the 7th Regiment,
and the Mayor was finally arrested&mdash;and was immediately
released. For three or four months Municipal and Metropolitan
Police paraded the city, fighting each other whenever opportunity
offered. The gangs went on their sanguinary way without even the
semblance of control.</p>

<p>In 1863 the Conscription Act came into operation as the result
of the northward march of General Robert E. Lee, and with the
passing of that Act, the gangs assumed a new and a sinister
importance. At that period the population of Manhattan Island was
about 800,000 people, half of whom were alien born. Of these some
200,000 were Irish and about half that number German, and it is
interesting to note that, whilst the Irish were almost
overwhelmingly on the side of the rioters, the Germans gave
assistance to legal authority.</p>

<p>Of the whole population of Manhattan Island 10 percent had
passed through the hands of the police in the year preceding the
Draft Riots. Of these, 80 percent had been born in Europe.</p>

<p>The agitation against the Draft Act was natural, for New York
was full of ruffians who had fled thither to avoid military
service, and since agitation could only take one form there were
sanguinary riots in which the police were outnumbered by five
hundred to one. The situation became so serious that 10,000
infantry and twelve batteries of artillery were called into
action, and pitched battles were fought in the streets. Armouries
were burned, negro asylums were destroyed and in some cases whole
regiments were defeated and disarmed and the soldiers
murdered.</p>

<h3>Mob Rule</h3>

<p class="first">IT was for a long time touch and go whether or
not New York would be surrendered to the mob. It was not until
the rioters were fired at point blank by artillery that the town
was relieved. Yet for this supreme crime only twenty men were
eventually arrested and sentenced to imprisonment, the real
leaders of the mobs being saved by the politicians.</p>

<p>It was after the Civil War that from the gangs emerged the
individual princes of the underworld, one of the most notorious
of whom was Leslie, the bank robber. Thereafter such famous gang
leaders as Monk Eastman, Humpty Jackson, Louie the Lump, Johnny
Spanish and Big Josh Hines ruled the little Kingdoms of the
Dark.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-09-19"></a>HORRORS OF GANG WAR IN THE U.S.</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Leeds Mercury</i>, 19 September
1928</h3>

<hr>

<h3>What "Taking a Car Ride" Means.</h3>

<p class="first">THE last of the big gang leaders of New York was
Big Jack Zeilig, originally a member of Monk Eastman's gang,
whose henchman included names familiar to the present-day reader-
-Gyp the Blood, Whitey Lewis, Lefty Louis and Dago Frank, who
were concerned with Police Captain Becker in the murder of
Rosenthal.</p>

<p>After the undisputed sway of the Irish gangsters, a new
element had arisen. The Russian Jew and the Italian dominated the
gangster world. Lefty Louis' name was Rosenberg, Dago Frank's
name was Cirofici, Whitey Lewis was born Jacob Siedenschner and
Gyp the Blood bore the less patronymic of Harry Horrowitz.</p>

<p>They were four ferocious men. It is said of Gyp the Blood that
on one occasion, to win a bet of a few dollars, he had seized a
perfectly inoffensive man and cracked his spine in three places
over his knee.</p>

<h3>Ferocious Desperadoes</h3>

<p class="first">THEY were all four killers. Lewis and Lefty
Louis were gunmen, and Dago Frank had many murders to his credit.
For hundred dollars or less any one of the four would and did
commit murder, Zeilig, the gang leader, taking the biggest share
of the blood money.</p>

<p>Zeilig was arrested on a charge of carrying concealed weapons.
He sent two of his henchmen to intimidate the real prosecutor,
who was a woman from whom he had demanded money. They failed to
persuade her, but a third intimate induced her to go back on her
evidence. Zeilig came out of custody full of wrath against the
two men who had failed in their duty, and one by one he
threatened them that within a week they would be dead.</p>

<p>Such a threat was not to be taken lightly; the two men hired
an independent killer. Zeilig had warning, and when the assassin
arrived in a big dance hall, where the king of the underworld was
seated, the lights suddenly went out. In the dark a gun boomed,
and when the lights came on again the hired assassin was
dead.</p>

<p>Though there was no question at all who killed him, he escaped
from prosecution. The two threatened men now knew that it was war
to the death. For a week after a guerilla warfare was maintained
between the two sections of the gang. Again Zeilig was arrested
and bailed out. It would have been better for him if he had not
left the security which his confinement offered, for as he walked
out of the courthouse he was shot down.</p>

<h3>Police Involved</h3>

<p class="first">ZEILIG had an interest in a number of gambling
houses, and there is little doubt whatever that certain members
of the police force draw a very considerable interest not only
from the Zeilig group, but also from that controlled by one
Hermann Rosenthal, who had as a partner Lieutenant Charles
Becker, head of the Gambling Squad of the New York Police. The
partners quarreled over a question of money, and Becker raided
Rosenthal's house. In retort, Rosenthal threatened to inform the
District Attorney of his association with Becker and the system
by which the gambling houses were run. Had that threat been put
into execution, it would have been the end of a vast income
enjoyed by the police and gangster alike.</p>

<p>At that moment Big Jack Zeilig was under arrest, but he was
approached in prison and promised freedom if he would furnish the
necessary gunmen to stop Rosenthal's mouth. He was given 2,000
dollars, and handed the work to Gyp the Blood, Left Louis, Dago
Frank and Whitey Lewis. Rosenthal must have known that he was a
doomed man, and adopted a drastic method to save his life. He
made an affidavit, which was published  in the "World," in which
he swore that Lieutenant Becker was his partner and had received
20 percent of the profits of one of his gambling houses.
Rosenthal was immediately called into conference with the
District Attorney.</p>

<h3>Murder Upon Murder</h3>

<p class="first">IT was on the evening of July 15, 1912. At
midnight he was at supper in the dining room of the Hotel
Metropole, when a man came in from the street and told him that
he was wanted. As he stepped outside he was shot down. The four
murderers were subsequently arrested and Lieutenant Becker also
was taken into custody a week later. Obviously, Big Jack Zeilig
was in a position to give the most important evidence. That
evidence was never given. He was shot dead in 13th st before the
trial.</p>

<p>The gunmen and Becker went to the chair, and with their death
the gangs of New York ceased to exist in their old shape.</p>

<p>It is not my business to discuss the merits or demerits of
what is known in Europe as the Prohibition Law. It is common
knowledge, however, that since that law has been in operation a
new type of gangster has appeared in the United States, and the
old tale of bloody warfare has been resumed in an intensified
form, especially in the State of Illinois. Bootleggers and
highjackers have waged an unceasing warfare. Men have amassed
huge fortunes and a powerful organization has come into existence
not only for the distribution of smuggled liquor, but for the
restriction of the areas in which the liquor sellers operate.</p>

<h3>New Methods at Work</h3>

<p class="first">FROM the criminologist's point of view the main
interest is the new type of crime, or rather the new method of
murder, which these internecine wars have produced. It was
perfectly illustrated in one of the most striking stories I have
read for a very long time, by Robert Hughes, the great American
Novelist.</p>

<p>From time to time were discovered in lonely spots the bodies
of well-dressed young men. They were laid out, their coats were
buttoned, their hats were placed over their faces, as though
there were some ritual attached to the crime. Though it was
obvious they had been shot dead, there were no bullet holes
through their coats or vests, and it almost seemed as though they
had been stripped of their undershirts before they were
murdered.</p>

<h3>Grisly Sequels</h3>

<p>These were grisly sequels to the method of dispatch known as
"taking a car ride." An individual who had incurred the enmity of
a faction, perhaps by participating in some such orgy of murder
as that to which he eventually becomes a victim, would be
standing on the edge of the sidewalk when two men close round
him. He feels the muzzle of a pistol pressed against his side,
and a low voice informs him just what will happen if he makes
trouble. He is shepherded to a closed car waiting near by, and,
his captors accompanying him, he is driven sometimes for twenty
or thirty miles before a favorable spot is found.</p>

<p>In the course of the journey he is told just what is going to
happen to him, and apparently it is a code of the gang that he
should make no attempt to escape. Arrived at the scene of the
assassination he is invited to get out, unbuttons his vest and
sometimes his shirt; he is then shot dead. His murderers perform
the "last rite," which is to lay him out decently, rebutton his
vest and coat, and pull his hat over his face. Not always is the
appearance of the dead man so orderly, but generally this is the
method adopted.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-09-20"></a>CONVICTS WHO THINK THEY ARE HEROES</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Leeds Mercury</i>, 20 September
1928</h3>

<hr>

<p class="first">THE underworld is a drab, miserable habitation.
It is without any of those picturesque qualities which belong
rather to occasional than to habitual crime.</p>

<p>Your regular thief can never escape from the atmosphere of
wrong doing. In prison he is brought into close contact with men
of his own kidney, and when he is released drifts naturally
toward people who think as he thinks. Christian missions touch
only the fringe of the criminal population, and for this reason
the machinery of reformation has its fundamental basis in a
disapproval of criminals and criminal methods&mdash;and the
denizens of the underworld are human enough to resent
disapproval.

Since these articles started in "The Leeds Mercury," I have had
any number of letters from authorities whose opinion I
respect&mdash;clergymen, missioners and prison governors. They do
not see eye to eye with me, naturally, because they approach the
subject of my articles from an entirely different angle. They are
brought into contact with the penitent&mdash;or, at any rate, a
man either undergoing or who has recently undergone a term of
imprisonment, and who has no immediate desire to return to a
locked cell. I have seen them in their more impertinent moment,
when they find life rather amusing and their past misfortunes
something to jest about.</p>

<p>A man who has been in prison three or four times can only be
kept out of mischief if some benevolent citizen will give him a
subsidy to keep him for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Amongst the many interesting letters which have come to me is
one from a man who has had the misfortune to be "inside." He
says, very properly, that I have only touched upon the fringe of
the matter in expressing my views on the reformation of the
criminal.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">The various aid societies are practically
useless&mdash;a man's ability to become a decent member of
society is gauged by his aptitude for chopping wood. The ex-bank
clerk or compositor is invariably a poor worker in a woodshed,
and, as such, is considered an unwilling worker whose reformation
is extremely doubtful. A discharged prisoner without a trade in
his hands stands a very poor chance in the labour market; if he
is an artisan, his position is almost equally parlous. He may
hold a Trade Union ticket, but his past career is known thereby,
whether he works in Croydon or Carlisle, and he is invariably
cold-shouldered out of the job. He may go 'non-Union' at less
wages&mdash;causing him to grouch at society who deny him his
opportunity, and the man is half-way back to prison again.</p>

<p class="letter">No man leaves the prison gates with the
intention of going inside again. He has had plenty of time for
consideration during his sentence, and has built up castles in
the air&mdash;dreams of a nice little business, with plenty of
profit. Out of fourteen men in the prison laundry at X- last year
only one expressed his intention of going on the crook again. The
remainder had plans for making honest
livings&mdash;wonderful&mdash;and in some cases quite feasible
plans. The only difficulty was the absence of capital, which they
declared, the Discharged Prisoners' Association ought to provide.
Failing that, they would have to do a job to get the capital and
then settle down to a prosperous life. Their castles in the air
have been exchanged once more for a castle of another sort.</p>

<p class="letter">I'm afraid that you have omitted reference to
that unusually successful crook, the 'mixer,' who mixes his
operations with honest work. He is in a position to select only
the best opportunities, and to vary the nature of his operations,
thereby making detection doubly difficult, for the police usually
identify a certain class of crime with a certain class of rogue.
He may act as a receiver one day, a smuggler the next and a
secret printer of filth another time. He is an opportunist and as
such successful. If caught, his period of honest work is in his
favour and he gets a light sentence.</p>

<p><br> With this view there can be no disagreement, except that
the mixer is the type that one does not get acquainted with for
various obvious reasons. But when the dreams of convicted persons
are revealed, of these nice little businesses which can be
started with a little capital, is not the whole psychology of the
criminal world exposed? Why should a man because he has been
arrested and convicted of a crime, consider that he is entitled
to start a business on capital either borrowed or stolen? Are
there not a large proportion of the population working for their
living and saving their money to the same end?</p>

<p>That is the trouble with the majority of criminals; they
consider that their very offence and its consequent punishment
should place them in a favourable position. So many of these
people come back from gaol obsessed with a sense of
heroism&mdash;they might be soldiers returning from a battlefield
to a land which, according to their views, should be fit for
heroes to live in.</p>

<p>There is no virtue in theft or its consequences. Yet every
worker who has had to deal with ex-convicts knows that attitude
of mind which demands as a right, the maximum of reward for the
minimum of labour.</p>

<p>My sympathies, however, are entirely with the writer of the
letter, who so cynically comments upon the efforts at reforming
first offenders by giving them wood to chop, or, as in some
cases, waste paper to sort. The efforts of these societies should
be concentrated upon the first and second offenders. The old lag
should be left to that very large class of philanthropists who
supply money for such hopeless and stupid propositions as
converting Jews to Christianity.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to convince an ex-prisoner that if there
is a good job going the first offer should be given to a man who
has lived an honest and decent life and who has shown himself in
all his opportunities to be a wholly trustworthy person. Only the
grossest of sentimentalists would give preference to a man whose
sole recommendation was that he had served a term in one of His
Majesty's prisons.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a proportion, and, in the case of the
first offender, a very large proportion of criminals can be
turned into honest citizens, but the habitual offender desires
nothing but a chance of making money easily, and he will drift
from prison to prison and eventually to the workhouse infirmary,
where he will die.</p>

<p>One of the cleverest burglars I have met and also one of the
most honest, came to my office for a job. He was so earnest that
I really began to think he had reformed. But he was the sort of
man who would not sail under false colours, one of the few
thieves for whom I have a profound respect.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not going straight," he said, "but I don't want to be
caught again as an habitual, and if I got employment between the
convictions they can't charge me with being an habitual criminal.
I want a job for about four months, and you needn't have any fear
about recommending me because I'll go as straight as a
ruler!"</p>

<p>I did not want the responsibility of recommending him, but I
heard afterwards that somebody did and that he was a model
workman in every respect during the period he was establishing
his respectability.</p>

<p>There is a legend, fostered by a certain type of criminal,
that they cannot get work because they are persistently dogged by
Scotland Yard, who inform their employers of their previous
record. This is not only a lie, but a wicked lie. The detectives
employed to watch ex-convicts are most careful never to betray
them. About a year ago a detective sergeant came to me to make
inquiries about a man with whom I had a casual acquaintance.</p>

<p>"O, yes," I said, "I know all about him. He's a convict on
license, isn't he?"</p>

<p>The officer smiled.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't told me that," he said, "I shouldn't have told
you."</p>

<p>And this is perfectly true. The police are most punctilious in
keeping the record of ex-prisoners within the four walls of
Scotland Yard, and there is no better friend to the criminal that
the men whose task it is to counter their activities.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-09-21"></a>OUR MERCIFUL POLICE</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Leeds Mercury</i>, 21 September
1928</h3>

<hr>

<h3>How they Help Men in Trouble.</h3>

<p class="first">I REFERRED in my last article to the attitude of
the police toward the underworld. Between these two conflicting
forces there is a sort of camaraderie which is difficult for the
outsider to understand. They know one another by their Christian
names, they meet on the friendliest terms, there is no real
enmity between them&mdash;I am referring of course to the
regulars of the underworld.</p>

<p>At this moment, when the police are being blackguarded and
every effort is being made to undermine our faith in them, it may
be as well to state the attitude of the criminal toward the two
branches of the service.</p>

<p>A uniformed policeman (or, as he is called, a "flattie") has
no more significance to the criminal than a 'bus conductor or a
postman. He is a man who can arrest him; he is an inconvenient
figure who may appear by accident on the scene of a burglary, and
he is a tough nut to tackle in a fight. For the uniformed
policeman, the criminal has an odd sort of half-pitying respect.
He is not afraid of him except when he is called by an outraged
householder to receive the vile body of a burglar caught in the
act.</p>

<h3>The Big Man.</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN the underworld talks of the police he
refers to the plainclothes man, the member if the C.I.D. Oddly
enough, he never connects his enemies with Scotland Yard. The big
man is not Mr. Wensley or Mr. Brown or the central detective
inspectors of Scotland Yard, but the divisional inspector of the
district in which the lawbreaker is living or operating. It is
the big man who pulls him in to divisional headquarters and
questions him on his movements "on the night in question." It is
the big fellow who has his eye on him when, as a convict on
license, he reports to the local police station. The divisional
inspector is the terrifying father of a large and apprehensive
family.</p>

<p>As I have said before, no thief cares to operate in his own
district, or, as he calls it "manor." That is "taking a liberty,"
and a liberty which will be very much resented by the lord of
that manor.</p>

<h3>Tales of Police Plots</h3>

<p class="first">THERE are very few criminals who are not on
perfectly good terms with the men who know them best. There are
scores of cases where old offenders who get into some other kind
of trouble than that which calls for the attention of the police
will go to headquarters to seek the advice and help of the man
who, sooner or later, will order their arrest. I have known
highly placed detectives to be called up at night to secure the
admission of some member of a criminal family into a
hospital.</p>

<p>It is not, of course, all love and harmony. Ninety-nine
percent of the underworld, when Nemesis overtakes them, protest
with the utmost vehemence that they are victims of a police plot,
that the evidence given against them is entirely false and that
they have been "shopped" innocently. That is because a criminal
believes that if some portion of the evidence against him is not
exact he is entitled to have the rest of the evidence dismissed
as perjury.</p>

<h3>Alibis</h3>

<p class="first">UNLESS a man is actually caught red-handed, the
alibi is his inevitable defence, and a great deal of the
detective's days and nights are spent in sifting these.</p>

<p>The fairness of the police in dealing with the criminal
classes is more than half their strength. If there is anything to
be said for a man on charge it is the detective officer in
control of the case who says it. The fact that they do not trump
up charges or evidence and that they will go out of their way to
examine some aspect of the case which tells in the prisoner's
favour actually simplifies the work of the detecting
department.</p>

<p>Almost the first request that a man makes of the detective who
arrests him is: "Make it as light for me as you can," and I have
known prisoners debate all the way to the police station as to
the section under which they should be charged. Most of the old
offenders have a horror of being charged "under the Act" (the
Prevention of Crimes Act), and they know that it is up to their
captor to determine to a very large extent the length of their
sentence.</p>

<p>The police are very patient and very merciful; they display an
uncanny knowledge of the punitive requirements of every case;
and, whilst they cannot actually arrange the punishment to fit
the crime, they can, and very often do, "say the good word" at
the crucial moment of the trial&mdash;which is after the jury
have found their verdict.</p>

<h3>Informers</h3>

<p class="first">THE uniformed police are the staple danger to
the underworld. They are, as it were, the entrenched infantry,
and the extent of the peril they represent is known and
discounted. The C.I.D. are the bombing aeroplanes that come from
nowhere and work disaster in all sorts of unexpected
quarters.</p>

<p>The C.I.D. depends to a certain extent, but not so large as
most people imagine, upon the informer. But, as Chief Constable
Wensley once stated to me: "Most thieves are their own
informers." It is the running away habit which betrays so many
criminals. A burglary is committed; the police, examining the
scene of the crime and the method adopted, decide that this many
be the work of one of a dozen men.</p>

<p>Immediately they begin to search for the dozen, to discover
where they were on the night the robbery was committed. In the
course of their search they discover that John X, one of the
suspected twelve, has disappeared. He had been seen about the
neighbourhood where he lives a few days before the robbery, but
now he has vanished. His wife informs the visiting detective that
he has gone away into the country to get a job, or some other
equally romantic story. John X., who lives in Walworth is
eventually discovered in Camden Town, and with him just
sufficient to connect him with the crime.</p>

<p>It is not always so simple as this, but very nearly so. If
Browne and Kennedy had disappeared from their garage after the
murder of Gutteridge they would have been arrested within a week.
They stood their ground, and that saved them for a long time from
detection.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-09-22"></a>THE NEW CRIME</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Leeds Mercury</i>, 22 September
1928</h3>

<hr>

<h3>A Very Dangerous Type.</h3>

<p class="first">I HAVE called this article "The New Crime" and I
have hesitated for a long time about writing it at all.</p>

<p>The easiest way to dismiss a fantastic accusation is to
describe the accuser as mad. It is not only easy, but devilishly
easy, to discount any story with this contemptuous dismissal.</p>

<p>The other day I showed a letter I had received to a doctor
friend of mine. He read it through and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! This is a mental case," he said.</p>

<p>And then I invited him to look at the writing, and that put
rather a different complexion on the matter, for the writings of
mental cases are typical. I have quite a number of letters from
lunatics in the course of a month, and one has only to read three
lines to discover the state of mind of the writer.</p>

<h3>A Pathetic Letter.</h3>

<p class="first">I AM going to quote extracts from a letter,
which I am disguising so that the identity of the writer should
not be made known.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"... There is the criminal about which you have
not written--he or she who exults in the undoing of his fellow...
A friend of mine, a woman with some property, fell under the
influence of a certain occult group. She became fascinated, and
eventually a devotee, and submitted to a form of hypnotism. It is
very difficult to describe this without raising the suspicions
that I am mad. It is sufficient to say that the woman who did the
hypnotising began to exercise an extraordinary influence
telepathically--that is to say, when they were not together. The
treatment so worked upon the woman that she became hysterical and
was in danger of being "certified," and was only stopped by
timely interference from conveying all her property by deed of
gift. I know that this same woman, the hypnotist, willed another
out of her house, which the "operator" eventually had for her
own. Here again the case was certified as menial. In both these
instances the mischief was wrought by a superior mental power
upon a weaker."</p>

<h3>Dominated.</h3>

<p class="first">SO much for the letter, and, reading it as a
solitary experience one would shrug one's shoulders and say
"Mental," and forget the poor creature who had written it. We
know that symptoms of persecution mania, and we know all about
the poor creatures who imagine that wireless is running through
them or that  they are being hypnotised. But we also know that
the mind of a mental patient is without stability or coherence,
and that he or she embroiders its main theme with all sorts of
impossible and fantastic side issues.</p>

<p>Now here is the fact that has interested me. During the last
two years I must have received more than a dozen letters, written
by people who are obviously sane, if handwriting goes for
anything, telling me exactly the same story, without any florid
et ceteras!</p>

<p>In other words, one may assume that there is a new type of
"mental criminal"; that is to say, a criminal who can by the
exercise of his or her personality and mental gifts, dominate a
weaker mentality and make a profit therefrom.</p>

<h3>Unbalanced.</h3>

<p class="first">IN every case (so far as I can remember; I have
not kept the letters, and, indeed, dismissed them as mental)
there was a history of occultism at the beginning, and in every
case it was a practiser of this "magic" who gained dominion over
the mind of the novice. There is support for the theory that such
a form of criminality is on the increase, by reported cases, very
often cases of disputed wills; but there must be hundreds that
are not reported, and I have the feeling that in these isolated
instances we are seeing the beginning of a new phase of criminal
activity. I admit that it is possible that every one of these
complaints might, on a close investigation, be susceptible to the
obvious explanation; but in no instance have I had letters which
were obviously written by mentally unbalanced people. The
domination of a strong mind over a weaker is no unusual
phenomenon, but there is more than a suspicion that this mental
tyranny is becoming systematised and that it may easily represent
a real danger, especially to women of the moneyed class.</p>

<p>Here is a type of criminal we do not know, and a dangerous
type. Reduced to the simplest terms. A being a dishonest person
and B a possessor or wealth, it is an offence in law for A to
remove the wealth from B's possession without B's consent. The
new crime is to make B surrender his or her possessions without
threat or violence, and apparently of his or her free will. The
law does not recognise any such human power, but only the most
stupid amongst us will deny that it exists.</p>

<h3>Worth Investigation.</h3>

<p class="first">THE experienced confidence man has it to an
extraordinary degree;swindlers of all types are nearly as well
equipped. There is no doubt whatever that the psycho-analyst
reduced it almost to a formula, and that quite a number of
scientific and unscrupulous people must have improved upon that
formula. It is at any rate a matter which is well worth
investigation, for the practisers of this new "art" are amongst
the most dangerous members of the underworld.</p>

<p>They are more dangerous because, in the strictest sense of the
word, they are not members of the criminal classes. We are
probably in the verge of making very important discoveries in the
psychic field, and when the new truths (whatever they are) are
established, when the realities of, let us say, telepathy are
revealed, quite a new department may come into existence at
Scotland Yard. A telepathic section at police headquarters might
prove an embarrassment to certain friends of mine!</p>

<h3>Haphazard Professions.</h3>

<p>It is a fact worth noting that, despite the extraordinary
strides which science has made to enlarge the utilities of
machinery, so little use has been made by criminals of modern
discoveries. There is a type of confidence man which uses the
wireless, but only to listen in to messages which are arriving
from incoming ships. The acetylene blow lamp and the electric
drill for the opening of safes, and the lavish use of the motor
car (usually somebody else's motor car) alone distinguish the
method of the modern thief from his confrere of thirty years
ago.</p>

<p>Larceny and housebreaking are still haphazard professions in
which are employed such casual tools as may come to the thief's
hand. There are not a dozen burglars in England who possess a
complete equipment.</p>

<p>We owe the detection of crime not only to a perfectly
organised Criminal Investigation Department, but also to the
stupidity of the lawbreakers. Now and again at rare intervals we
discover a master mind, but even here it is not a type that would
win success in any ordinary business. The majority of criminals
are men and woman of a lower order of intelligence than the
average artisan, and this explains not only why they are so
easily caught, but also why it is so difficult to give them a
fresh start after they come out of prison.</p>

<p>The population of the underworld is stupid; it has a cunning
which passes for cleverness and an insensibility which
masquerades as courage. It is almost entirely without romance. A
drab, ugly, frowsy place is this underworld.</p>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<p class="first"><i>In this series of which this is the first

crime and criminals, will set forth his observations of how
criminals work and why. In this first article he discusses the
habits of aristocrats of the business.</i></p>

<p class="first"><i>An Explanation of Some of the Means Used by
Skillful and Well-Dressed Card Sharps to Fleece Their
Victims&mdash;Separate the Man And His Money by Painless
Methods.</i></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="first">ALL men are born criminals. The baby in its
cradle knows no law. Its tiny hands would kill and maim to the
limit of its strength: it takes whatsoever its hands can reach,
irrespective of lawful ownership. Remove the baby from the care
and tuition of its civilized mother and nurse, cut out all the
"don'ts" and "mustn'ts" which stand in the rough for the laws by
which society is governed and it remains an active criminal until
the end of its days. That is to say, it takes what it wishes, it
slays that which it hates, it is entirely self-indulgent. All
wild things are "criminal," in that they obey only the laws of
nature.</p>

<p>The criminal, as we understand the phrase, is a man or woman
who ignores a few of the rules of which society has agreed shall
govern human activities. He understands and approves of those
laws, and is all for the enforcement of those which protect him
equally with the innocent citizen. He requires that the police
shall so regulate the traffic that he may drive his stolen motor
car with a minimum of risk to himself; that his landlord shall
not dispossess him of his habitation, that his food shall not be
adulterated, and that his private enemies shall not assassinate
him.</p>

<h3>No Completely Lawless Man</h3>

<p class="first">THE entirely lawless man is a
phenomenon&mdash;even Ulianov Lenin was not a completely lawless
man, since he railed against the unpunctuality of Russian
trains.</p>

<p>The criminal's mentality has been fantastically tabulated by
such biased scientists as Lombroso, his facial and physical
peculiarities have formed the basis of theses for writers who,
during the past 100 years, have devoted their studies to him and
his ways; nor is it necessary that I should take a microscope to
examine the seeds of his proliferation.</p>

<p>Here he is, a fact to be faced by the prosocial forces of
every country, a hateful fact to some, a fearful fact to others,
an interesting fact to all who count nothing about such a  man
without interest.</p>

<p>The statistician does not help one very much to understand
him, for statistics can prove just what you wish them to prove.
Statistics have proved to one party that crime has fallen off 50
percent in an American city since the introduction of
prohibition, and has proved with equal force to another that the
police were only half as efficient since the city went "dry."</p>

<p>It may be stated broadly that the cause of criminality in an
individual is his desire to live beyond the income that he
believes he could obtain by the legitimate exploitation of the
abilities.</p>

<h3>Criminals are Individualistic</h3>

<p class="first">THERE is no underworld in the sense that there
is no criminal community dwelling and conspiring together to
break the law. Criminals are individualistic. Two or three may
gather together to carry out some "job" but there is no fixity in
their associations. Harry C. and Tommy B. together with Johnny H.
may arrange to burgle a house or two houses; may, indeed, for a
period work together at their nefarious occupations, but the
chances are that they will be split up into units either through
detection or through suspicion, one of the other, and Tommy B.
will be working with Frederick K. on the next "job" he does.</p>

<p>When attempting to classify the habitual criminals it is
possible to divide them into two main divisions: the educated and
the uneducated. There are grades of educated criminals-so-called
and in the highest of these you will find the "aristocracy,"
which travels first-class in the liners plying between Britain
and foreign ports. They are men of some substances, they have
reserves of money, and they alone of the criminal classes can be
fairly described as  working in gangs. Card-sharpers rarely
change their partners.</p>

<h3>Men of Substance</h3>

<p class="first">THE first-class card-sharper lives a very
respectable life. He usually has his home in the United States
and will cross the ocean from six to ten times a year. Arriving
in London, he puts up at a good hotel, and it may be that, having
found a "sucker" on the boat who showed some reluctance to be
inveigled in a game of cards, a coup is arranged on land, and the
friendship which began at sea exploited disastrously for the
victim.</p>

<p>At least twice a year the shipboard card-sharpers make a tour
of the European cities. You will find them on the Riviera in the
season and quite recently they have been discovered in winter
sports areas.</p>

<p>They are very careful to avoid Monte Carlo, which has a system
of espionage more perfect than is to be found in any other city
in the Continent. When I was in Berlin the other day I was told
by a police official that card-sharp gangs had been located in
some of the German cities, and particularly in the spas of
Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p>The card-sharp is the most interesting of all the criminals.
He has a knowledge of human psychology which is positively
staggering. For example it is very rare that a sea-going "crowd"
will attempt to fleece their dupes before at least three days of
the voyage are over. The passenger who comes on board a steamer
is naturally suspicious of chance acquaintances, and would
probably regard an invitation to play as a sinister
circumstance.</p>

<h3>Speaking from Experience</h3>

<p class="first">I WILL give my own experience the only time that
I was ever caught. We were due in Southampton on Wednesday
morning, and on the Saturday night a venerable old gentleman with
whom I talked about everything in the world except cards,
suggested we should play a game of bridge before going to bed.
His confederate (and I hadn't the slightest idea that they were
connected, and looked upon them as on people who has casually
drifted to the table where I was drinking a nightcap)
demurred.</p>

<p>"It is much too late to start bridge tonight," one said.</p>

<p>"What about tomorrow?" asked my venerable friend.</p>

<p>Here the cleverness of these crooks was revealed. A sturdy,
white-haired man, who was the second member of the gang, shook
his head.</p>

<p>"No, not on Sunday," he said, "I am not a Puritan, and I have
no objection to other people playing cards, but I never play
cards on a Sunday, and I don't want to start now. You may think I
am old-fashioned, but there it is."</p>

<p>I respected the man for his scruples. I was impressed. Here
was an honest gentleman, a little old-fashioned, as he said, but
a man of principle.</p>

<h3>In No Hurry to Begin</h3>

<p class="first">ON Monday morning I met them in the smoke room.
"It was much too early for bridge," protested the venerable one.
It looked as if we were not going to get our game. Eventually it
was decided to play between lunch and tea in the Parisian Café,
and here we played. I made a grand slam in the first hand&mdash;I
had lost £80 at the finish.</p>

<p>"Why play at such high stakes?" you ask.</p>

<p>Again you have to admire their cleverness.</p>

<p>"We will play for a shilling," said one of them.</p>

<p>Naturally, I thought it was a shilling a hundred. It was after
I had been dealt my first hand, which was blazing with aces and
kings, that somebody said:</p>

<p>"Isn't a shilling a point too high?"</p>

<p>I suppose if I had been inhumanly honest I should have
said:</p>

<p>"No, I am playing for a shilling a hundred."</p>

<p>I could afford a shilling and did not say no.</p>

<p>I realized that I had been caught before the game was over. I
paid my losses. I did not regret my playing because I
subsequently made quite a lot of money out of writing stories
about the ocean-going crook.</p>

<p>I give this instance of the mentality of the higher grade
criminal as an illustration.</p>

<h3>Confidence Men are Also of the Élite</h3>

<p class="first">IN the same class are the confidence men. Not
the gentlemen who are to be found in the London parks looking for
a man whose name is Smith in order to hand over to him hundreds
of thousands of pounds left by a mythological millionaire, but
the big men who wander around Europe looking for the big money.
They may make a killing once a year, but they land a tremendous
booty.</p>

<p>These criminals are generally blackmailers as well as
confidence men, and they utilize every scrap of information they
can secure in order to hook their fish. Very rarely is there a
squeal, and they enjoy a greater immunity than any other type of
criminal.</p>

<h3>An Ingenious Method</h3>

<p class="first">A PERFECT specimen of an educated lawbreaker
operated in the Midlands. He had been a priest and had been
unfrocked for certain malpractices. He went to a Midland city and
opened a bookshop, and people who saw a few shelves covered with
heavy and interesting tomes on ecclesiastical and religious
matters wondered how he gained a living. Then, one day, two
Scotland Yard men arrived and took him away with them.</p>

<p>I think his form of graft was the most ingenious I have ever
met with. He used to search diligently in all the
newspapers&mdash;he subscribed to some 50 local and country
weeklies&mdash;to discover the names of clergymen of the Church
of England who had died.</p>

<p>When he had secured the information about their death, he
looked them up in <i>Croker</i> to get some idea of their
stipends, and a few days later the executors of the deceased
clergyman received a bill for books supplied.</p>

<p>Sometimes the bill was paid without demur, but occasionally
the executor would ask for a statement of accounts, and would
receive at once a long list of obscene works, such as certain
obscure booksellers supply. In order to save any kind of scandal,
and probably believing the worst of their poor dead friend, the
executors sent a check in settlement.</p>

<p>His undoing came in a remarkable way&mdash;he sent a bill to
the executors of a west-of-England clergyman, a man he supposed
to have plenty of money, and the executors asked for particulars.
Back came an appalling list designed to show that the dead priest
had a depraved taste. A few days afterward the swindler was
arrested. He had made a mistake. The deceased clergyman had been
stone blind for 20 years, a fact with which he had not acquainted
himself.</p>

<h3>Criminals by Necessity</h3>

<p class="first">AS a rule, this kind of thief, more than his
uneducated fellow, is driven to crime by immediate necessity. He
starts by forging an acceptance on a bill of exchange, or, in
some desperate need, he orders goods for which he cannot pay,
disposes of them; or, being in some position of trust, employs
money which is not his own, but which he hopes to make good in
time to avoid detection. In this category you may find the fallen
bank clerk, the agent, the embezzling solicitor and the postal
official. Very few of these, however, reach what could be
truthfully described as the underworld. They are saved by their
relations and friends and never appear in the records of Scotland
Yard. Only a minute proportion use their first conviction as a
jumping-off place for a life of crime.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-11-04"></a> CAUSES THAT LEAD MEN<br>
TO LOWER FORMS OF CRIME</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Boston Globe</i>, 4 November 1928</h3>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first"><i>One of the most famous students of crime and
criminals, Mr. Wallace, is setting forth his observations in a
series of articles. Today he writes of the unskilled criminal and
his ways. In the next article he will tell something about the
strange ways of feminine crooks.</i></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first"><i>Some of the Ways by Which Criminals Are
Developed, the Less Skillful Types Particularly</i></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THERE is no criminal state, as I have said
before, nor could there be, since lawbreakers are intensely
uninterested in their kind. Take the average criminal and talk
with him for a quarter of an hour on general subjects and then
suddenly switch the conversation over to some nine-day wonder of
crime which is filling the public eye. Instantly he is bored.</p>

<p>He neither praises the ingenuity of the gang which has broken
into a Hatton Garden store and removed jewelry of a fabulous
value, nor does he express the slightest curiosity as to the
means adopted. He is self-centered, and some little adventure of
his own in the past is an ever so much more interesting topic for
discussion.</p>

<p>He is, however, ready and willing to discuss past
contemporaries in his own line of business. He has a queer
perverted pride in his own particular graft. If he is a
pickpocket, the exploit of a confidence man may arouse a slight
flicker of enthusiasm, because there is a certain association
between pickpockets and the small fry in the confidence
world.</p>

<h3>Work in Combinations</h3>

<p class="first">IT is very often the case that the various sorts
of specialists, burglars, cheap card sharps&mdash;the type you
meet in race trains&mdash;and little thieves have served at some
time or other as temporary "whizzers" (pickpockets). Pickpockets
who "work" the buses in rush hours usually operate in gangs of
three and four.</p>

<p>One of them might be an expert "dipper," the others cover his
movements or act as minders to facilitate his escape. The minders
are, as a rule, men of brute intelligence and brute in every
other respect. The unskilled laborer in the field of crime is
certain sooner or later to gravitate to one of these gangs.
Pickpocketing is also regarded as the last resort of an aged
criminal.</p>

<p>This type of lawbreaker has a certain wit which does the duty
of intelligence. It is hardly fair to describe it as low
cunning.</p>

<h3>An Incident to the Point</h3>

<p class="first">ONE of the most important police officers in
London was once called to the scene of burglary. An entrance had
been effected in an upper window and some goods were stolen. The
only clue&mdash;and it was an important one&mdash;was the
discovery on the window sill of a metal button.</p>

<p>The detective remembered seeing a man, an old acquaintance of
his, wearing a fancy waistcoat with buttons of that particular
character, and he immediately went in search of his man. He had
not gone far before he encountered the subject. A quick glance at
him showed that one button of the waistcoat was missing, and it
was a case of "come round to the station with me."</p>

<p>The man was interrogated, told the usual lies, and, as he was
an old offender, when he was charged at the Police Court, was
committed for trial. In those days the police procedure was a
little different from what it is today. When the case came up at
the City Bailey (or the Sessions, I am not sure which) the
detective went into the witness box, gave his evidence: other
witnesses were put in, and the prisoner raised no objection. The
case was proved to the hilt until the moment the prisoner was
asked if he had anything to say in his defense. He was still
wearing the waistcoat he had on when he was arrested, and this he
indicated to the jury.</p>

<h3>How he Proved His "Innocence"</h3>

<p class="first">"YOU have seen the button that the detective
showed you. I would like you to have a look at it again."</p>

<p>The jury examined the button.</p>

<p>"Now," said the prisoner, removing his waistcoat, "look at
this. It is true I have lost a button, but you will find the
shank is still sewn on! The button you have in your hand has a
shank on it. Did you ever hear of any button with two
shanks?"</p>

<p>There was no answer to this and the man was acquitted. What
had happened was that while he was awaiting trial somebody had
smuggled in a shank of a button, a needle and thread, and he had
sewn it on!</p>

<h3>How a Thief was Made</h3>

<p class="first">AS a child I was daily brought into contact with
other children who were regular and systematic thieves, yet who
stole for no profit. They were boys who were employed at
printer's works and would bring home handfuls of new type and
display it to their admiring friends: boys employed in boot
warehouses, who would steal the cheaper kind of ladies shoes
without having the slightest use for them.</p>

<p>There were other boys who worked at the docks, and scarcely a
day passed that they did not come home with their pockets bulging
with contraband of a more negotiable character.</p>

<p>These young people definitely go over to a life of lawlessness
just as soon as they can discover a receiver who would give them
cash for their "finds." In some districts and in certain circles
the receiver is very easy to find. In others the thief does not
come in contact with this poisonous individual and drifts back to
honesty and decency under the influence of home and respectable
associates.</p>

<p>Once the receiver is found and stolen goods can be converted
into spendable money, a new outlook on life is established. The
youth gets so much money from his illicit games that he forgets
that it is necessary for him to maintain himself in regular
employment.</p>

<p>He is either found out or dismissed and he finds himself on
the world without money and no desire for regular work and a
pressing need for cash. It requires a certain amount of character
to go back to regular employment, however great may be the
opportunities for pilfering and so he drifts to a life of
pilfering alone, and is definitely criminalized. To him there is
no underworld. He is an individualist, as I have said before: his
comrades may have a loose value as assistants, confederates,
directors of new operations or organizers.</p>

<p>Fagins there may be, but they do not play a considerable part.
The real Fagin is the receiver, and if these gentry received
automatically twice the normal sentences usually passed upon them
for all offenses where they have purchased from thieves under the
age of 21, the heavy work of the police might be considerably
lightened.</p>

<h3>Determining the Field of Operations</h3>

<p class="first">WHAT does frequently happen is that the kind of
honest employment that a young man followed before he went
crooked determines the character of his subsequent depredations.
For example, most of the stealers of material, such as silk,
cloth, furs, are men who have been honestly employed either in
the warehouses or handling of these commodities.</p>

<p>A type of crime frequently met with is the stealing of vans
containing goods ready for delivery. The carman has gone into a
coffee house for breakfast accompanied by his van boy. While he
is absent somebody gets into the van and drives off to an
unfrequented spot, where the goods contained in the wagon are
looted.</p>

<p>It is the same with warehouse robberies. One or other of the
thieves has become acquainted with the routine of some particular
warehouse or shop, has got to know the habits of the staff and
has a very intimate acquaintance with the kind of goods that are
to be found on the premises.</p>

<p>To some extent this facilitates the work of the police in
their business of detection. They are able to classify the
various varieties of larcenists and burglars, and they know that
when new houses in course of erection have been entered by night
and lead pipes and brass taps stolen, the job has been done by a
specialist in this kind of theft.</p>

<h3>Another Incident</h3>

<p class="first">THIS fact was brought home to me some years ago
when I was present during a hearing of a charge against a man who
had broken into a rectory and had stolen some silver. When the
jury returned a verdict of guilty and his previous convictions
were read out three of four were concerned with the breaking into
clergymen's houses. The man before he adopted a life of crime,
had been a handyman at a rectory and probably his idea of wealth
and luxury was circumscribed in the mental picture of a
well-furnished house of a priest.</p>

<p>I always thought the everyday burglar who devotes himself to
the "business" of dwelling houses has particular predilections
and yet I was told by a police officer of a very wide
acquaintance that burglars as a rule specialize in a certain type
of house. Some, for example, never "operated" on houses that
hadn't a basement, others would burgle nothing but non-basement
houses. It is not an infrequent experience when new villas are
put up in the suburbs&mdash;especially the villas of a
substantial type&mdash;for the "professionals" to go over the
empty houses to make themselves acquainted with the general
layout of the rooms.</p>

<p>It is an extraordinary fact that although burglars are very
timid and nervous (those who have had the unpleasant experience
of having burglars in the house will testify to the fact, for
they live all the time in terror of a burly householder with a
gun in his hand), they very rarely desert this form of robbery
for any other.</p>

<p>Burglary, of course, is the easiest of crime; requires less
ingenuity than any other. I do not know the exact figures, but it
is the fact that more empty houses are burgled than "live"
ones&mdash;a live one being a house that is occupied.</p>

<p>The ideal venue is the house or flat from which the owner is
absent on a holiday. It is only the younger and more reckless
members of the craft who will dare to break into a house knowing
somebody is sleeping on the premises.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THE West End of London is the haunt of criminals
of a peculiar type. They are the luxury traders and live on
folly, not of  the rich, but the "flush." The "flush" are people
who, without having any definite source of wealth, have for the
moment an unusual accumulation of money.</p>

<p>People on holidays, visitors from foreign lands, men cutting a
dash on money they have saved or accumulated by legal or illicit
means, well-to-do folk from the Provincial centers&mdash;all
these are material for the "con men," the cardsharps and
blackmailers who gather in considerable numbers when London is
"full."</p>

<p>All these have in reserve, or in active cooperation, women of
a certain class. One of the most dangerous gangs that ever
operated in the metropolis was that governed by a very attractive
woman, who had an intelligence department deserving of a better
end.</p>

<p>She specialized in middle-aged men of substance. Town
Councilors from Midland towns, Aldermen, J.P.s. She had a
detailed list of all the wealthy public men in the country. She
could afford to wait, living in a first-class hotel until a
likely victim came along. Once the "subject" was found, the work
was fairly simple.</p>

<p>She chose her men very wisely, became acquainted with them,
and after a succession of hectic little supper parties, allowed
her prey to go back to his respectable home and his public duties
with no apprehension in his mind that there was coming another
day of reckoning.</p>

<h3>The Old Gag</h3>

<p class="first">THEN, one afternoon when Mr. Mayor or Alderman
was speaking sedately on the subject of town lighting at a
Council meeting, an angry voice would be heard in the corridor
outside, a lady demanding stridently that Mr. X should be
informed that she was waiting. When, in terror, he hurried out to
her it was with the greatest difficulty he stilled her shrill
voice and brought her to the privacy of his room.</p>

<p>She had a husband (she said) who had discovered "everything,"
she must go to Mr. Alderman's wife and ask her to help
her....</p>

<p>Mr. Alderman paid hush-money&mdash;not once, but many times.
One Mr. Alderman, in despair, hanged himself in his wine
cellar.</p>

<p>The police knew of this, but could get no evidence; no victim
would testify against her. Deportation was not so easy to secure
in those days&mdash;she was an alien&mdash;and she might have
gone on with impunity if she had not commmi8tted the fatal error
of getting herself mixed up in a shooting affray. That little
affair cost her 15 years of liberty, for, once the police got her
in their hands, they worked up such a case against her that she
had no chance of escaping with a light sentence.</p>

<p>There was another woman, more attractive, who, until a year
ago was working the same trick with greater success. She is young
and pretty, beautifully gowned, rides in a most expensive car and
has, or has had, a suite at one of the best hotels.</p>

<p>She chooses the young man about town&mdash;the wealthy do-
nothing, whose income and circumstances are very easily
ascertainable. She is difficult to get acquainted with, knows to
the nth degree the value of suspense, has given a commercial
value to reluctance and hesitation. Her graft is to lure her man
into a hopeless compromising situation and then demand money on
the threat of charging her victim with an offense.</p>

<p>I would not dare, even if there were no law of libel, to give
you a list of the people who have been caught and have paid.</p>

<h3>Used as Decoys</h3>

<p class="first">LESSER women assistants attach themselves to
every côterie of blackmailers and town sharps; they need very
little description, and that not of the politest kind. Their
value both as principals and helpers is obvious. It is they who
act as hostesses at the little supper parties, which are
followed by cards.</p>

<p>There are scores of furnished houses and flats taken for the
season, and I remember one case where a house in the street in
which I am living was rented at £100 a week. The lordly owner did
not know that his beautiful home was being used as a gambling
club until he read, to his horror, that it had been raided by the
police! In this case women were used as decoys.</p>

<p>A "chance" meeting (usually maneuvered) between a very pretty
girl and the "right" man on the river at an open-air club
somewhere around London should be followed by the inevitable
"Where can I see you again?"</p>

<p>What was easier than to arrange a dinner and, later, a call at
the gaming house on the pretext that she had to see somebody to
put off a supper engagement?</p>

<p>The beginnings of the women criminals are drably and sadly
alike. I have never met with nor heard of a woman crook who
committed any illegal act in the days of her innocency. In a very
large number of cases there is a treacherous man and an unwanted
child in the background.</p>

<h3>Shoplifting Almost a Vice</h3>

<p class="first">PROSTITUTION is not a consequence, but a cause
of crime. I do not, of course refer to that peculiar type of
offense which is entirely and absolutely distinct, except in
isolated cases, from the general practice of
criminality&mdash;shoplifting. The majority of shoplifters are
amateurs in the sense that they live respectable lives, have very
often husbands in good employment and, in some cases, are well to
do.</p>

<p>The practice is almost a vice, since there is practically
nothing at all to be gained. The exception is the class of shop
thieves who operate in gangs. As a rule they choose a suburb of
London or some nearby town, and go off in a party from six to
ten, dividing when they reached the town, and each taking some
predetermined area of operation.</p>

<p>In suburbs like, for example, Kingston, Wimbledon and, farther
afield, Watford, Southend-on-Sea,and in other seaside towns, they
are certain to find shops which do not employ any of those
pestilential detectives who are on duty in London stores and
whose duty it is to keep suspects under observation.</p>

<p>These little gangs work most systematically, expenses are
divided among them and certain allowances made for refreshments,
and when the haul has been made and disposed of the profits are
equally divided.</p>

<p>There is, or was, quite a number of these gangs having their
base in the East End of London, and only very recently the police
arrested one such crowd in a watering place on the East Coast.
Almost every one of them had a shoplifting history and one or two
were wanted for petty pilfering.</p>

<p>This set more nearly approximates to a "gang" than any other
within my knowledge.</p>

<h3>The Domestic Thief</h3>

<p class="first">FROM the area where these women are to be found
emanates the professional servant thief. The police have records
of scores of women who do nothing but take situations as domestic
servants. Their imposing credentials are forged and they usually
take the precaution of entering their names at a first-class
registry office. Naturally the agent takes up their references
and finds that they are all they claim to be, and more.</p>

<p>About 20 years ago there used to be a place in Essex which
bore the imposing name of Manor Hall (this is not the name, but I
don't give the real title, in case there is a more pretentious
dwelling with that name).</p>

<p>Mr. Jones, who desired a butler and a cook-housekeeper, was
referred to Manor Hall and heard of the excellent service which
the couple had rendered during "the past 10 years." The letter
was invariably written in ladylike hand in the third person. The
paper bore a crest and was embossed with the gratuitous
information that the nearest railway station was
Snellborough.</p>

<p>But the Manor Hall was a small cottage owned by a lady who had
long ceased to follow her profession and earned a very good
livelihood as a late employer of undesirable people. I am relying
on my memory, but I have an impression that the Manor Hall was
not the only name this cottage bore.</p>

<p>The telephone has been of great use to the dishonest servant.
A lady in a hurry to hire a cook very often does not trouble to
write, but if a telephone number is given will call up the "late
employer" and accept an ecstatic estimate of the new servant's
virtues.</p>

<p>The crook servant is not long in the house before she
understands exactly the possibilities of her new job. Only the
cheaper kind steal articles of jewelry. The more experienced type
will wait until she has an opportunity of securing a return worth
while. There are cases on record where the patient thief has
waited for months until the family had gone on a holiday and then
cleared every piece of valuable furniture from the house.</p>

<h3>Women Excel as Thieves</h3>

<p class="first">THE woman thief is always more dangerous because
she is least suspected. Somehow, you never think of a woman as a
trained thief. She invariably dresses infinitely better than the
man of her class. She takes trouble with her voice and, if she is
attractive, uses what charms she possesses to still further
disarm her dupe.</p>

<p>The woman burglar is practically nonexistent. Burglary is a
manual work. There are roofs to be climbed, windows to be forced.
Moreover, a woman in a deserted street late at night attracts
more attention than a man.</p>

<p>Another peculiar fact is that the woman forger is practically
unknown although one would imagine that with their delicate touch
they would be able to make a better job of the work than a
man.</p>

<p>On the other hand, women counterfeiters are numerous. They
belong to a lower stratum of society. Perhaps it is that there is
some latent chivalry&mdash;although I have never met with
it&mdash;which makes them reluctant to involve a woman in a crime
which there is such a very heavy sentence.</p>

<p>In one branch of criminality, however, women play a very
ignoble part&mdash;they are expert blackmailers. I would like to
give a separate chapter to these pests, the most deadly of
all.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-11-18"></a> BLACKMAILER PREYS ON HIS VICTIM'S
VANITY</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Boston Globe</i>, 18 November 1928</h3>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first"><i>In Many Cases the Foolish Conceit of the
Victim&mdash;Sometimes the Blackmailer Is an Amateur Who Takes a
Chance.</i>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<p class="first">ORGANIZED blackmail is not a "trade" in the
sense that there is a clan of persons which deliberately sets
itself to gain a livelihood by extracting money under threats. We
hear of "blackmail gangs" and occasionally see the conviction of
several people who, acting together, have extracted money from
some unfortunate person, but as a general rule, blackmail is an
accidental crime which may be repeated should opportunity offer,
and may, in certain cases, become a system.</p>

<p>I am thinking more of male offenders; the women are in a class
by themselves.</p>

<p>There is a type of systematic criminal who falls under the
description and who is familiar to the police and to the
public.</p>

<p>These are the men who dog the footsteps of country couples and
appear at an embarrassing moment, representing themselves as
police officers and demanding money as an alternative to arrest.
These cases are frequently met with in the courts.</p>

<p>But the average blackmailer is an unscrupulous person, who
uses knowledge acquired by accident to extract money. In the
United States systematic blackmail is much more frequently met
with, for the laws of America and the free and easy method by
which private detectives are given power which in England are
restricted to the police offer the blackmailer greater scope.
One of the greatest of American detectives calculated that
$1,000,000 a year was taken by blackmailers in the city of New
York alone.</p>

<h3>An Aid to the Profession</h3>

<p class="first">THE Mann act was, and probably still is a
prolific source of income to these gentry. Under this act it is a
felony to take any woman from one State to another for immoral
purposes. Working in collaboration with an attractive member of
the oldest profession, the blackmailers reaped, and still reap a
rich harvest. It was easy enough to induce a dupe to cross for
instance from New York to Jersey City. Here the pair would be
discovered by a spurious detective, with the result that the man
paid, and paid heavily, to keep himself out of the courts.</p>

<p>And the detective was not always counterfeit&mdash;there are
cases known where members of the city detective force have
conspired to help the blackmailers. In Germany blackmail is not a
very common crime, nor is it in France.</p>

<p>There are certain offenses the revelation of which (or the
threat of revelation) would fill the English offender with
horror, and would earn for him a term of imprisonment, but which
do not so greatly confuse the authorities in France or
Germany.</p>

<p>It is not that they are more tolerant so much as the fact that
they recognize and accept unpleasant happenings in the light of a
deeper psycho-pathological understanding. Certain crimes are
classed as diseases.</p>

<p>The blackmailer whom we know has his beginning in the chance
discovery of his victim's failings, follies or delinquencies.</p>

<h3>Cases in Point</h3>

<p class="first">HERE are a few cases I can recall without
consulting my books:</p>

<p class="first">(A) was a married lady who had an affair with a
Canadian officer. Her maid, under notice to leave, found a number
of letters from the lover, and taking these away with her, she,
on the advice of a married sister, and smarting under the refusal
of her late employer to give her a "character," wrote hinting at
the possession of information and the effect this might have on
the lady's husband. The lady very foolishly sent money and
thereafter paid regular tribute. The blackmailer in this case was
created by the victim.</p>

<p class="first">(B) was a professional man who had assisted a
girl in bringing about an illegal operation. The girl's sister
demanded money ostensibly to send her sister on continuous
holiday, necessitated by the state of her health.</p>

<p class="first">(C) was a man who had embezzled the money of his
employers. His relations found the money to pay the employers,
but the correspondence between the firm and the culprit fell onto
the hands of a young man who was walking with C's maid.</p>

<h3>Seldom a Direct Threat</h3>

<p class="first">BLACKMAILERS seldom demand money on a direct threat of
exposure. He or she invariably asks for a loan either to leave
the country, to pay the cost of an illness, to pay bills incurred
through the supposed fault of the victim, and the threat is as
invariably oblique.</p>

<p>Here is a typical peroration to such a letter:</p>

<br>

<p class="typewriter">"... I feel I must go abroad. I am
desperate. I will come up to your house tomorrow night. I am sure
your wife would have pity on me and lend me money...."</p>

<p><br>
There is a tremendous amount of this kind of blackmail going
on. The victim knows that if he informs his solicitor a
prosecution will follow. Of late it has been the practice of all
decent newspapers to suppress the name and address of a man or
woman who prosecutes a charge of extracting money, but very often
it is not public exposure that the victim fears, but the
enlightenment of his or her own family circle on the subject of
past stupidities.</p>

<p>I once had a wild idea of starting an agency with a few ex-
Scotland Yard men to deal with this type of crime. A blackmailer
is the easiest kind of criminal to suppress&mdash;given
resolution and a certain amount of courage&mdash;nor is it
necessary that the damning facts that the victim is trying to
hide should be made known to his friends and relations.</p>

<h3>Men Victims of Own Vanity</h3>

<p class="first">MEN are more particularly susceptible to the
operations of the blackmailer, because of their extraordinary
vanity.</p>

<p>The conceit of the male is past belief. Many years ago I was
making inquiries in a celebrated murder case, and, as is the
usual experience in the investigations of a reporter, my
questions were addressed to many unsavory people and in many
peculiar quarters.</p>

<p>The criminal was well known to a certain type of woman, and
we limited our inquiries to three of these, two of whom lived in
Bloomsbury and one in Fulham. Their homes were in no sense houses
of a dubious character. Two of them had flats and one had a
furnished suite of rooms in a seemingly respectable house, though
of this I had my doubts.</p>

<p>What was to me a staggering discovery was that in each of
these women's rooms I found scores of photographs of decent men,
some obviously in a good position, and not only their
photographs, but also their cards displayed upon the mantelpiece.
Every photograph was affectionately inscribed, and I have never
seen such a perfect jumping-off place for a blackmailer in all my
life. The photographs were mostly taken by recognized West End
photographers, and some of the cards had the men's club
inscribed. I asked the girls whether this was the usual
practice.</p>

<p>"O, yes," said one. "A man likes to think that he is
particularly favored by a girl, and he usually manages to work up
a little sentimental interest in her."</p>

<h3>The Oldest Profession</h3>

<p class="first">THE display of these photographs, of course, was
merely an expression of the woman's desire for respectability.
She wished to show those of her intimate acquaintances who called
the kind of friend she had. That is easily explained. There is no
other explanation of the folly of those men who deliver their
characters and their careers into the hands of a prostitute,
except this overweening vanity which is almost beyond
analysis.</p>

<p>In England there is among those women a certain code of honor
which covers the majority. There are others, however, who are not
thus bound, and it occasionally happens that men had had to pay
dearly for their lapse from righteousness. A police officer who
would have been a member of the Morality Squad if there had been
a Morality Squad at Scotland Yard, told me that it is very rare,
indeed, that professional women engage in the trade of blackmail,
and there are others for whom blackmail is the first
consideration, and their mode of life merely a means to live.</p>

<p>I think it is true to say that the habitual criminal regards a
mild form of blackmail as part of the normal machinery of the
craft. Whilst I have never had any very unpleasant experiences it
has often happened with a criminal I have helped that a point was
reached when I refused to give him further assistance, whereupon
he had endeavored to extract money on the ground that I have used
his experiences to write a book, and one gentleman publicly
suggested that all my books and plays were founded on his
life.</p>

<h3>A Personal Experience</h3>

<p class="first">TO show how little these fellows miss, I might
quote an experience of mine this year. I was talking to a very
well-known jewel thief in my study, when an Australian journalist
was announced. As the newspaperman came into the room my other
visitor left. I remarked casually to my friend of the press:</p>

<p>"This is X, the jewel thief."</p>

<p>It happened that he was writing an interview with me in an
Australian paper, and in the course of that interview he
mentioned the fact that as he had come in, so-an-so, the jewel
thief, had gone out. About four months later, my discreditable
acquaintance arrived with a world-worn press cutting from an
Australian newspaper.</p>

<p>"I see you mentioned me," he said. "Don't you think I am
entitled to a quid?"</p>

<p>This, of course, is hardly "putting the black," to use the
thieves' expression, but it shows how these men seize every
little advantage that may come their way.</p>

<p>I know only one case where in the course of a burglary a
compromising letter had been stolen and subsequently turned over
to the press. As a rule, the burglar gets away very quickly and
takes with him only solid valuables.</p>

<p>Blackmail is purposely visited with the heaviest punishment.
It is the most cowardly and cruel crime. One of these days, when
I have a little more time, I shall serious;y consider organizing
my counter-blackmail bureau.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-12-02"></a>PRISONS ARE OFTEN NURSERIES FOR CRIMINALS</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Boston Globe</i>, 2 December 1928</h3>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first"><i>First Offenders Often Reform After Prison
Term, But Old-Timer Almost Never Does.</i></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">A VERY large proportion of humanity is
fundamentally dishonest, but does not live by cheating, but only
a small section of the fundamentally dishonest gain their living
by breaking either the written or the moral law. As I have said
before, they are individualists, unless they are working in
côteries</p>.

<p>It may be convenient for the purpose of description to
describe these as "gangs," but they are not gangs in the sense of
the old gangs our fathers knew; in fact, the gangster spirit
(that is to say, the community of lawlessness) is never
established except in prison, which molds all men into a criminal
type.</p>

<p>It is loosely said that burglaries and offenses against the
law are very often planned in prison, and I have no doubt that
convicts, when they meet, especially with the end of their
sentence in sight, do discuss the illicit possibilities of the
future.</p>

<p>But as far as convict prisons are concerned, the men who go
out to liberty intending at the earliest opportunity to commit a
particular crime, are very few indeed. Their desire is very
naturally to avoid further imprisonment, and the large majority
of them, assisted by various societies, do make an effort to
secure work.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases they are unskilled laborers, they
have no trade union ticket, even as general laborers, and they
are quite unfitted to begin a battle of life against the severe
competition which they find in a free world.</p>

<h3>Hard Task to Find Work</h3>

<p class="first">ONE meets these half-hearted people wandering
aimlessly and pathetically around London, looking for suitable
employment, knowing in their heart of hearts that, unless a
miracle happens, employment can never be obtained. It is
difficult enough for honest men, who have never seen the inside
of a prison gate, to find employment&mdash;it is almost impossible for
the ex-criminal. The jobs they ask for are within the scope of
their talents.</p>

<p>They wish to be messengers, caretakers or watchmen; which may,
at first sight, seem a remarkable desire, and to cover some
sinister plans for the future&mdash;for the messenger will carry, the
caretaker will protect and the watchman will obviously observe
property of some value, and in all three occupations the very
highest credentials are required by employers.</p>

<p>They may get work on the roads, but here again, unless road
work is provided by benevolent municipalities for out-of-works,
there is no opening even in this field of labor. The Salvation
Army and similar missions do a certain amount of work, in that
they collect the indigent and give them employment, which,
however, is too reminiscent of casual ward and prison labor to
have much attraction.</p>

<p>I am aware of the fact that a number of these missions claim
to "reform" the ex-convict. Penitents there are in plenty and
thousands may be assisted to live in a new land in which they are
no more fitted to sustain life than in England. The man who had
three or four convictions is incorrigible.</p>

<p>Unless he has the best of luck and can fall into a soft job he
would drift down the road to vagabondage, which ends in the
workhouse or in one of H.M. prisons. Nobody but a lunatic would
take a man who has been four times convicted for theft and place
him in a position which gave him an opportunity of a fifth
conviction.</p>

<p>In dealing with the underworld one must abandon all
sentimentality. We know that they have all had mothers, they were
all at one time or other innocent babies and we may go even
farther and say that they are all God's creatures.</p>

<h3>Few Second Offenders Reform</h3>

<p class="first">WHATEVER is immortal in them, however, runs side
by side with gross appetites, and is not accompanied by any sense
of difference between <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>. If the logical
course was pursued, the habitual criminal would be placed in a
lethal chamber, and if humanity is staggered by this suggestion
it is because it does not study the prison statistics.</p>

<p>There are, of course, cases where men and women have reformed
and have become good citizens, but they are exceptional, and if
you will examine these particular examples of reformation you
will find behind it cases which are not always creditable to the
reformed character.</p>

<p>I am aware that in saying this I shall be confronted with
indignant people with innumerable statistics showing the number
of men and women who, thanks to the effect of this or that
society, have been turned into the straight path. But these
figures are more or less valueless unless they show the age of
the rescued people and the number if their convictions.</p>

<h3>Drinking Not Cause of Crime</h3>

<p class="first">BETTING is a prolific cause of first offense,
but very rarely the cause of second and third offense. The
pilferer of stamps and tills, the secretary of small clubs who
finds it convenient to vanish before the Christmas shareout, the
cashier, the barman, who rings a "no sale" on a cash register and
takes out from the till the amount he should have put in, these
are what I would describe the "opportunity thieves" who do not
properly belong to the underworld, and will never reach that
dingy region unless they are entirely devoid of character.</p>

<p>Drunkenness is no longer a remarkable cause of crime. A
safe-breaker told me that he had only once "operated" with
a "boozer," and that he preferred men like himself who were total
abstainers.</p>

<p>I am talking specially about criminals who had four and more
convictions. The proportion of the "one conviction" men who go
straight thereafter is a very large one, because they include
people who have fallen through an extraordinary
opportunity&mdash; milkmen who have embezzled their employers'
money, postal officials who have acted stupidly when in control
of the mails, bank clerks, forgers and other good examples of
"black coat" crime.</p>

<p>By "black coat" crime I mean that committed by men with an
elementary education who have occupied some minor position of
trust. It is these in a much larger proportion than the artisan
class who find their way into the police courts and session
houses.</p>

<p>Drink may be, and probably is, the explanation for a great
deal of petty offenses such as fighting, embezzlement, wounding
etc., but one does not meet, nowadays, any authentic cases of
young men who have been brought to a criminal career through this
form of self-indulgence. If one does, it is usually found that
they had already contracted criminal associations.</p>

<p>What is badly needed, and particularly in large industrial
areas, are boys' clubs and compulsory evening classes. Something
more than this is desirable&mdash;that the evening classes shall
conform to the real requirements of the poor. Van boys would not
waste their nights learning bookkeeping, French and three
varieties of art; they want to be taught something that will be
of use, something that will open new vistas and will be a
counter-attraction to the alluring picture of wealth without
work, which the underworld draws for them.</p>

<h3>Gangs Formed in Prison</h3>

<p class="first">THE gang formers are, as I have said before, the
prisons. It is only here that lawless men meet on community
terms, having nothing else to unite their interests but their
past misdemeanors. The real curse of the prison is that it may
remove from the young delinquent all sense of shame for his past
iniquities. In China, where "soldier" was once a term of
reproach, there was a saying: "In the army no man feels
ashamed."</p>

<p>Prison familiarizes the novice with a new habit of thought.
Right and wrong are substituted by expediency and inexpediency.
There is a system by which the young offender is kept from
contact with the older criminal. In theory this system is quite
workable&mdash;in reality, of course, many things happen in
prisons which are contrary to the spirit and letter of law.</p>

<p>The young offender may not actually meet a man with many
convictions, but there is a sort of oblique contact. The idea
that the old lag instructs the novice in the art and practice of
crime has little foundation in fact, though he is very often an
inspiration; you can imagine the effect on the first offender
who, day after day and week after week, has pointed out to him
the notabilities of the underworld and their exploits described
to him in tones of awe.</p>

<p>A man has to have many convictions against his name before he
actually uses the friendship which are established in prison for
the development of crimes when he is released. That was why
Browne, in the Gutteridge case, was so remarkable a
character.</p>

<p>The suggestion of first offenders does not, of course, apply
to convict establishments, and at Dartmoor special privilege must
be earned. I still believe that the adoption in this country of
the system of suspended sentences would go a long way towards
relieving the calendar of second offenses.</p>

<p>If the postal official, the defaulted clerk, the embezzler,
instead of being sent to association with the criminal classes,
was released immediately the sentence was passed, the taxpayer
would be saved considerable expense and the society would
benefit. The suspended sentence is tantamount to the system of
ordering a man to come up for judgment when called upon.</p>

<p class="cp"><i>The United States Leads in High-Class Criminals.</i></p>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">LONDON is the meeting place, but not the
headquarters of certain groups of crooks. Paris has the dubious
distinction of being their more or less permanent home. The
nationality of the international crowd is overwhelmingly
American. This enterprising race has even ousted the shady racing
hanger-on from his once unassailable position. You could almost
count the British international criminal on the fingers of two
hands.</p>

<p>The British are not good linguists, or, what is more nearly
true, they do not have the same nerve to speak bad French and
German as Americans do.</p>

<p>Though France and Germany can produce some very interesting
homicides, they do not produce in bulk such skilled offenders
against the laws of property as America and Britain. The genius
of the German burglar, swindler and shoplifter, however,
transcends similar criminals of other Nations. He does not
operate on the scale of the big "bank smasher," and he has fewer
opportunities of making big hauls than has his prototype of
London and New York, but what he does he does well and
thoroughly.</p>

<p>In the Berlin Kriminal-Museum I saw a most amazing collection
of tools and gadgets used by burglars. One was a thick batten of
wood, at the top of which was a steel spike tapering from a fine
point to broad base. The burglars, working from below, put the
spike under the floor of a room they were "opening"; the other
end of the batten was put upon a big motor jack, and with this
simple instrument the floor was forced.</p>

<h3>German Crook Has Humor</h3>

<p class="first">IN some respects the German criminal resembles
the British crook in that he possesses a very keen sense of
humor. Behind the museum where these implements are displayed is
a prison. One night a prisoner escaped, climbed up into the
museum, made a collection of tools likely to be of use to him
and, getting out of the building, burgled a jeweler's shop.</p>

<p>I saw here one or two interesting pieces of equipment used by
professional shop thieves. One was a cardboard dress-box. It was
neatly wrapped in brown paper and tied up with string. On the
parcel was the label of a well-known firm in Berlin. The thief
carried this (there were two exhibits of different sizes) into a
store, laid it on the counter and proceeded to examine various
articles which he or she wished to purchase. In the course of
this examination various goods disappeared. Once or twice the
suspicious attendant called for the store detective, but nothing
was found, and the thief was allowed to go.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for him, the criminal police were consulted, and
they very quickly got to the bottom (or the side) of the mystery.
The side of the parcel was a trap door with a spring to keep it
closed. It was cleverly camouflaged and even a close observer
would have imagined that the neatly folded paper representing the
end of the parcel was the real thing. The thief had only to push
any article he wished to conceal through the side of the parcel
and it vanished, and even the most suspicious of shop assistants
would not imagine that, tucked away in that sealed package, was
the missing stock.</p>

<p>Though crimes of a certain unpleasant type are very common in
Germany most of the instruments I saw used by thieves for their
defense were of French make. An innocent looking walking stick
that on a touch of the spring became a mass of cruel spikes was
quite a rarity in the gallery.</p>

<h3>Three Types of Thieves</h3>

<p class="first">YOU may roughly classify the Continental crook
into three categories: First, the big burglar gangs which make
fleeting visits from capital to capital; second, the swindlers,
which include the card sharps, confidence men, check passers and
specialists in fraud generally; third, the luggage thieves, which
include hotel and jewel thieves.</p>

<p>The police make bigger hauls of the third category than of any
other. They are to be found in Berlin, in Prague, Vienna and
other great centers, and I believe there are at this moment in
the German prisons quite a number of English confidence men. With
these latter, of course, the language presents no difficulty,
since they travel as British on British passports, and nobody
expects a true born Britain to understand any other than his
mother tongue.</p>

<h3>French Train Thieves</h3>

<p class="first">THE French are, perhaps, the most expert train
thieves, and it is these, rather than the imported article, that
passengers to the Riviera in the season have most to fear. An
official of the Wagons-Lits told me once that in the period
between when the conductor went into his cabin to sign some
necessary document and came out, an expert thief had entered
three compartments and escaped without detection.</p>

<p>It is very rare, however, that the Wagons-Lits coaches are
robbed; a stranger appearing in the middle of the night is
instantly detected, and the real danger comes from an apparently
genuine passenger who is traveling in the coaches.</p>

<p>Their dexterity is amazing. There have been instances of boxes
and money being removed from under a pillow without disturbing
the sleeper. There is one historic case where the whole bed was
searched without awakening the victim.</p>

<p>The train thieves have a very intimate knowledge of the
psychology of travelers, and they know exactly the places where
valuables may be hidden.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that much more is not stolen, remembering the
haphazard method of passengers. I know a case of a woman who
invariably carries $30,000 in jewelry whenever she goes abroad,
and as invariably leaves her property in a small dressing bag,
which could be stolen and thrown out of the window to a
confederate almost with the minimum chance of detection. Her
justification is that the jewel case is locked!</p>

<p>Enormous sums of money go across the Channel daily in the form
of jewels and actual cash. Not so very long ago I traveled from
Paris with a man who had $500,000 worth of pearls in his inside
pocket. He didn't tell me this till just before we got to London,
and I was relieved, because on the boat I spotted at least two
gentlemen who could have taken the coat off his back without his
knowing it. Happily, they were as ignorant as I.</p>

<h3>High-Class Confidence Man</h3>

<p class="first">THE dangerous body of crooks passing from London
to Paris are not out for immediate gain. They are in the
confidence business, and their job is to get acquainted with the
right kind of people. The journey, however is so short that only
the most expert of these generally ever succeed in establishing
confidence.</p>

<p>It used to be the practice for one of these men to engage a
compartment from Calais to Paris, especially on days like
Saturdays, when the traffic was heavy. There would always be a
fair sprinkling of passengers who had not made reservations, and
these would be compelled to stand up for the whole journey.</p>

<p>As is usual, they pass along the coaches, looking for
accommodation, and he would wait until he had seen a man whom he
had marked down for treatment before he invited him to share his
luxurious solitude. He invariably traveled with a valet and a
beautiful luncheon basket and offered hospitality to his guest.
By the time they reached Paris he and his victim were firm
friends and the rest was easy. Sometimes he would make the trip
without a bite, but more often than not he brought down his
bird.</p>

<p>In this case the swindler was a perfect French scholar, spoke
two or three languages and had a flat in the most fashionable
part of Paris.</p>

<h3>Apaches in Paris Only</h3>

<p class="first">In France, as distinct from Great Britain, there
is a very ugly underworld which has its roots in the basest soil,
and which is glorified and romanticized by the name of Apache.
These criminals have no especial interest except for their
brutality. They are thieves and the associates of thieves,
bullies, coiners and rather bungling burglars. The Apache class
is chiefly remarkable for its inefficiency in criminal
practices.</p>

<p>One expected to find the same type in Germany and Austria, but
curiously enough, though very naturally there are section of
society which live all the time in a state of war with the
police, and though the German criminal can outvie the worst in
brutality, the relationships between the police and the habitual
criminal classes are very much the same as between Scotland Yard
and their prey.</p>

<p>The wicked attacks on isolated policemen, which was once a
feature of Parisian criminal life, have few parallels in Germany.
The English Nation is too well disciplined to permit the growth
of that spirit of organized lawlessness which animates the
underworld of France.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-12-16"></a>HOW GANGS TERRORIZED NEW YORK</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Boston Globe</i>, 16 December 1928</h3>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="cp"><i>For a Time the Mob Ruled the City</i></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">I HAVE touched upon the question of "gangs," and
I have said that gangs organized for lawless practices are non-
existent in Great Britain. There still remain numbers of fighting
gangs, generally composed of young men between the ages of 16 and
22, who are banded together under a leader, and who expend their
energies in fighting rivals organized on the same lines. They are
to be found in almost every big city, but especially were they
conspicuous a few years ago in London.</p>

<p>These consisted of a number of men who were intimately
associated with the sport of racing. One had its headquarters in
London and another in Birmingham, and they fought for the
privilege of blackmailing bookmakers and retaining certain race
meetings as their own preserves.</p>

<h3>Handicaps of the Gang Leaders</h3>

<p class="first">AT the head of one of these was an alien, a very
charming fellow, who showed something of the qualities of a
general. But alien leadership is fatal; it gives the police
extraordinary powers. An alien may be deported and may lose the
right of asylum. It was thanks to the energetic action of Sir
Samuel Scott and the stewards of the Jockey Club that the
activities of these turbulent gentlemen were curtailed.</p>

<p>Here again, they did not interfere with the general public.
Their enemies were certain bookmakers who refused their rapacious
demands, and one another. Because their graft was blackmail, they
were the nearest approach to a gang we have had for many years.
The Birmingham crowd were perhaps the legitimate successors to
the Peaky Blinders and in London the Hooligans.</p>

<p>A gang, like a chain, is as strong as its weakest link, and
against the high efficiency of modern police methods they cannot
possibly exist. That is true also of America, which was the home
of the gangster, but which is his home no longer.</p>

<p>Just now the United States, and especially cities like Chicago
and New York, but more especially Chicago, are embarrassed by the
presence of rival firms in the bootlegging business&mdash;a
rivalry which has been responsible for a terrible number of
murders, and which has produced a new type of criminal and a new
kind of crime.</p>

<h3>Origin of the American Gangs</h3>

<p class="first">PERHAPS a brief history of the old gangs would
not be amiss at this point. The earliest of these grew around the
speakeasies, where people could buy illicit liquor, and which
were established in the region of the famous, or infamous, Five
Points. The first, according to Mr. Herbert Asbury, who is an
authority on the subject was called the Forty Thieves, and it
operated under one Coleman. From this organization, which had its
recognized headquarters and routine, grew the Plug Uglies and the
Dead Rabbits, the latter being one of the most formidable and one
of the most dangerous gangs that existed in New York in the '30s.
They were a ferocious and merciless crowd, and perhaps the women
members of the gang were the more formidable.</p>

<p>The Dead Rabbits owed their peculiar name to a deceased bunny
which was thrown into the room at one of the meetings of the
earlier gangsters. But these and a rival gang confined themselves
to fighting one another, and it was not until a much later period
that the gangster for profit came into existence.</p>

<p>Tammany Hall recognized the value of these existing gangs and
there began that strange association between this political
institution and the riff-raff of the city which was to last for
many years. The gangs became factors in politics; they dragooned
voters, terrorized political enemies and were not above acting as
"repeaters" at the polls.</p>

<p>These gangs certainly did much to establish Tammany in 1834,
and in the great fire, which destroyed 13 acres of the financial
district in the following year, they turned looters and had a
marvelous time.</p>

<h3>Dominated New York</h3>

<p class="first">IT is not too much to say that the gangs
dominated the life of New York for many years. Almost 100 years
ago Tammany was keeping faith with the ruffians it employed.
Murderers were kept out of prison, thieves could steal with
impunity, with the assurance that if, by bad luck, they were
arrested, the political bosses would secure them freedom.</p>

<p>Again and again the military were called out to keep these
gangsters in check. It is interesting to remember that the actor
Macready barely escaped from the Bowery with his life. He left
New York never to return.</p>

<p>The life which the lower strata of the gangs lived can only be
described as terrible. The squalor, the lack of sanitation, the
ghastly condition of their "homes" are indescribable. Human life
meant nothing. Strangers who strayed into the neighborhood were
dragged into a cellar, killed and stripped and their naked bodies
thrown out.</p>

<p>The police were almost powerless and seldom made an arrest
except after a terrible fight. In the infamous 4th Ward the law
ceased to operate. Even in the earliest days the prominent
gangster was accorded royal honors at his funeral, and it is told
of Bill, a butcher, who lived a fortnight after he had been shot
through the heart by a rival gangster (his last words were:
"Goodbye, boys! I die a true American.") that he had a funeral at
which more than 5,000 men attended and six bands played
dirges.</p>

<p>The murderers it may be noted in passing, were not convicted,
and one of them became the leader of Tammany Hall in the early
'70s.</p>

<p>It was during the Civil War that the gangs showed their most
powerful activities. Strengthened by the scum of other cities,
they were powerful enough to defy not only the city authorities,
but the authorities of the Federal Government. This was during
the draft riots of '56. In that year a man named Wood was elected
as Mayor. He was a crook of crooks, a most dishonest official,
the type of man who, if there were a law in the land, would have
spent the remainder of his years in jail. The keepers of the
gambling houses and saloon-keepers, however, gave him their
complete support, as also did the Dead Rabbits, which was by now
the dominating gang in New York city.</p>

<p>The method of election was a simple one. On the night before
the poll, Wood, who was already Mayor and was coming up for his
second term of election, gave all the police in the city a
furlough, with strict orders not to go near any of the booths.
Rioting immediately started between the Bowery gang and the Dead
Rabbits. No decent citizen could venture abroad. Mr Wood secured
the election, and, as was subsequently proved, at least 10,000 of
his votes were entirely fraudulent.</p>

<p>It was an amazing fact that the police force was at the
service of the criminal element, inasmuch as it was run by men
who had the nomination of the Dead Rabbits.</p>

<p>The really big trouble started when, by an act of legislation,
a metropolitan police force was formed, with a Board of
Commissioners, who called upon Mayor Wood to disband the
municipal force. The Mayor instantly refused, and naturally had
the support of the men who were to be disbanded. A Street
Commissioner appointed by the Metropolitan Police Board, on going
to assume office, was most incontinently thrown into the street.
Warrants were issued for the Mayor's arrest and one of them was
given to an officer and executed, but the Mayor was instantly
rescued by the municipal police and the officer was thrown into
the street. Then followed a terrific fight between the
metropolitan and the municipals up and down the steps and
corridors of City Hall.</p>

<p>The next move was to call in the 7th Regiment, and the Mayor
was finally arrested&mdash;and was immediately released. For three or
four months municipal and metropolitan police paraded the city,
fighting each other whenever opportunity offered. The gangs went
on their sanguinary way without even the semblance of
control.</p>

<p>In 1863 the Conscription Act came into operation as the result
of the northward march of Gen Robert E. Lee, and with the passing
of that act, the gangs assumed a new and a sinister importance.
At that time the population of Manhattan Island was about 800,000
persons, half of whom were alien born. Of these some 200,000 were
Irish and about half that number German, and it is interesting to
note that, while the Irish were almost overwhelmingly on the side
of the rioters, the Germans gave assistance to legal
authority.</p>

<p>Of the whole population of Manhattan Island 10 percent had
passed through the hands of the police in the year preceding the
draft riots. Of these, 80 percent had been born in Europe.</p>

<p>The agitation against the Draft Act was natural, for New York
was full of ruffians who had fled thither to avoid military
service, and since agitation could take only one form there were
sanguinary riots in which the police were outnumbered by 500 to
1. The situation became so serious that 10,000 infantry and 12
batteries of artillery were called into action, and pitched
battles were fought in the streets. Armories were burned, negro
asylums were destroyed and in some cases whole regiments were
defeated and disarmed and the soldiers murdered.</p>

<p>It was for a long time touch and go whether or not New York
would be surrendered to the mob.</p>

<p>It was not until the rioters were fired at pointblank by
artillery that the town was relieved. Yet for this supreme crime
only 20 men were eventually arrested and sentenced to
imprisonment, the real leaders of the mobs being saved by the
politicians.</p>

<p>It was after the Civil War that from the gangs emerged the
individual princes of the underworld, one of the most notorious
of whom was Leslie, the bank robber. Thereafter such famous gang
leaders as Monk Eastman, Humpty Jackson, Louie the Lump, Johnny
Spanish and Big Josh Hines ruled the little Kingdoms of the
Dark.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="cp"><i>How the Modern Gangs Operate and Carry on Deadly Feuds</i></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THE last of the big gang leaders of New York was
Big Jack Zeilig, originally a member of Monk Eastman's gang,
whose henchman included names familiar to the present-day
reader&mdash;Gyp the Blood, Whitey Lewis, Lefty Louis and Dago
Frank, who were concerned with Police Capt Becker in the murder
of Rosenthal.</p>

<p>After the undisputed sway of the Irish gangsters, a new
element had arisen. The Russian Jew and the Italian dominated the
gangster world. Lefty Louis' name was Rosenberg, Dago Frank's
name was Cirofici, Whitey Lewis was born Jacob Siedenschner and
Gyp the Blood bore the less patronymic of Harry Horrowitz.</p>

<p>They were four ferocious men. It is said of Gyp the Blood that
on one occasion, to win a bet of a few dollars, he had seized a
perfectly inoffensive man and cracked his spine in three places
over his knee.</p>

<p>They were all four killers. Lewis and Lefty Louis were gunmen,
and Dago Frank had many murders to his credit. For $100 or less
any one of the four would and did commit murder, Zeilig, the gang
leader, taking the biggest share of the blood money.</p>

<h3>The Gang Leader's End</h3>

<p class="first">ZEILIG was arrested on a charge of carrying
concealed weapons. He sent two of his henchmen to intimidate the
real prosecutor, who was a woman from whom he had demanded money.
They failed to persuade her, but a third intimate induced her to
go back on her evidence. Zeilig came out of custody full of wrath
against the two men who had failed in their duty, and one by one
he threatened them that within a week they would be dead.</p>

<p>Such a threat was not to be taken lightly; the two men hired
an independent killer. Zeilig had warning, and when the assassin
arrived in a big dance hall, where the king of the underworld was
seated, the lights suddenly went out. In the dark a gun boomed,
and when the lights came on again the hired assassin was
dead.</p>

<p>Though there was no question at all who killed him, he escaped
from prosecution. The two threatened men now knew that it was war
to the death. For a week after a guerilla warfare was maintained
between the two sections of the gang. Again Zeilig was arrested
and bailed out. It would have been better for him if he had not
left the security which his confinement offered, for as he walked
out of the courthouse he was shot down.</p>

<p>Zeilig had an interest in a number of gambling houses, and
there is little doubt whatever that certain members of the police
force draw a very considerable interest not only from the Zeilig
group, but also from that controlled by one Hermann Rosenthal,
who had as a partner Lieut. Charles Becker, head of the Gambling
Squad of the New York Police.</p>

<p>The partners quarreled over a question of money, and Becker
raided Rosenthal's house. In retort, Rosenthal threatened to
inform the district attorney of his association with Becker and
the system by which the gambling houses were run. Had that threat
been put into execution it would have been the end of a vast
income enjoyed by the police and gangster alike.</p>

<h3>The Rosenthal Murder</h3>

<p class="first">AT that moment Big Jack Zeilig was under arrest,
but he was approached in prison and promised freedom if he would
furnish the necessary gunmen to stop Rosenthal's mouth. He was
given $2000, and handed the work to Gyp the Blood, Left Louis,
Dago Frank and Whitey Lewis.</p>

<p>Rosenthal must have known that he was a doomed man, and
adopted a drastic method to save his life. He made an affidavit
in which he swore that Lieut. Becker was his partner and had
received 20 percent of the profits of one of his gambling houses.
Rosenthal was immediately called into conference with the
district attorney.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of July 15, 1912. At midnight he was at
supper in the dining room of the Hotel Metropole, when a man came
in from the street and told him that he was wanted. As he stepped
outside he was shot down. The four murderers were subsequently
arrested and Lieut,. Becker also was taken into custody a week
later. Obviously, Big Jack Zeilig was in a position to give the
most important evidence. That evidence was never given. He was
shot dead in 13th Street before the trial.</p>

<p>The gunmen and Becker went to the chair, and with their death
the gangs of New York ceased to exist in their old shape.</p>

<p>It is not my business to discuss the merits or demerits of
what is known in Europe as the prohibition law. It is common
knowledge, however, that since that law has been in operation a
new type of gangster has appeared in the United States, and the
old tale of bloody warfare has been resumed in an intensified
form, especially in the State of Illinois. Bootleggers and
hijackers have waged an unceasing warfare. Men have amassed huge
fortunes and a powerful organization has come into existence not
only for the distribution of smuggled liquor, but for the
destruction of the areas in which the liquor sellers operate.</p>

<h3>New Method of Murder</h3>

<p class="first">FROM the criminologist's point of view the main
interest is the new type of crime, or rather the new method of
murder, which these internecine wars have produced. It was
perfectly illustrated in one of the most striking stories I have
read for a very long time, by Robert Hughes, the great American
novelist.</p>

<p>From time to time were discovered in lonely spots the bodies
of well-dressed young men. They were laid out, their coats were
buttoned, their hats were placed over their faces, as though
there were some ritual attached to the crime. Though it was
obvious they had been shot dead, there were no bullet holes
through their coats or vests, and it almost seemed as though they
had been stripped of their undershirts before they were
murdered.</p>

<p>These were grisly sequels to the method of dispatch known as
"taking a car ride." An individual who had incurred the enmity of
a faction, perhaps by participating in some such orgy of murder
as that to which he eventually becomes a victim, would be
standing on the edge of the sidewalk when two men close round
him. He feels the muzzle of a pistol pressed against his side,
and a low voice informs him just what will happen if he makes
trouble.</p>

<p>He is shepherded to a closed car waiting near by, and, his
captors accompanying him, he is driven sometimes for 20 or 30
miles before a favorable spot is found. In the course of the
journey he is told just what is going to happen to him and
apparently it is a code of the gang that he should make no
attempt to escape.</p>

<p>Arrived at the scene of the assassination he is invited to get
out, unbuttons his vest and coat and pull his hat over his face.
Not always is the appearance of the dead man so orderly, but
generally this is the method adopted.</p>

<p>A great deal is written about American lawlessness and a great
deal that is unjust and unfair to the American Nation. The real
trouble is due to the higher administration of the law, to the
political cogs in the machinery of justice.</p>

<p>In England a bench, independent of politics and superior to
any pulls, political or otherwise, and a police force whose
operations and workings are most jealously watched, and the
centralization represented by the Home Office and its subsidiary
departments, make it impossible that crime should go unpunished,
however important may be the criminal and whatever his wealth or
position. With judges above suspicion and a police force entirely
dissociated from political influence, it is inevitable that the
administration of criminal justice in this country should be
almost above reproach.</p>

<p>In America every State has its own system of law, its own
method of administration, and although there is a Federal
authority, which in theory is superior to the State authority,
there is no real cohesion between the two.</p>

<p>We have in some degree the same disadvantages obtaining in
Great Britain. We have, for example, municipal police and county
police, and a third force, the Criminal Investigation Department,
used as a consultative body. Nevertheless, there is a uniformity
of method, and Scotland Yard is the thread (a very thin thread)
which connects all three. It seems, therefor, that it is not the
question of the central police organizations, but the fact that
we have a uniformity of administration, represented by the
Sessions system, which makes England so free from serious
crime.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1928-12-30"></a>HABITUAL CROOKS CANNOT REFORM</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Boston Globe</i>, 30 December 1928</h3>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THE underworld is a drab, miserable habitation.
It is without any of those picturesque qualities which belong
rather to occasional than to habitual crime.</p>

<p>Your regular thief can never escape from the atmosphere of
wrongdoing. In prison he is brought into close contact with men
of his own kidney, and when he is released drifts naturally
toward people who think as he thinks. Christian missions touch
only the fringe of the criminal population, and for this reason
the machinery of reformation has its fundamental basis in a
disapproval of criminals and criminal methods&mdash;and the
denizens of the underworld are human enough to resent
disapproval.</p>

<p>Since the publication of these articles I have had any number
of letters from authorities whose opinion I
respect&mdash;clergymen, missioners and prison governors. They do
not see eye to eye with me, naturally, because they approach the
subject of my articles from an entirely different angle. They are
brought into contact with the penitent&mdash;or, at any rate, a
man either undergoing or who has recently undergone a term of
imprisonment, and who has no immediate desire to return to a
locked cell. I have seen them in their more impertinent moment,
when they find life rather amusing and their past misfortune
something to jest about.</p>

<p>A man who has been in prison three or four times can only be
kept out of mischief if some benevolent citizen will give him a
subsidy to keep him for the rest of his life.</p>

<h3>As a Prisoner Sees It</h3>

<p class="first">AMONG the many interesting letters which have
come to me is one from a man who has had the misfortune to be
"inside." He says, very properly, that I have only touched upon
the fringe of the matter in expressing my views on the
reformation of the criminal.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">The various aid societies are practically
useless&mdash;a man's ability to become a decent member of
society is gaged by his aptitude for chopping wood. The ex-bank
clerk or compositor is invariably a poor worker in a woodshed,
and, as such, is considered an unwilling worker whose reformation
is extremely doubtful. A discharged prisoner without a trade in
his hands stands a very poor chance in the labor market; if he is
an artisan, his position is almost equally parlous. He may hold a
trade union card, but his past career is known thereby, whether
he works in Croydon or Carlisle, and he is invariably cold-
shouldered out of the job.</p>

<p class="letter">He may be 'non-union' at less
wages&mdash;causing him to grouch at a society which denies him
his opportunity, and the man is half-way back to prison again. No
man leaves the prison gates with the intention of going inside
again. He has had plenty of time for consideration during his
sentence, and has built up castles in the air&mdash;dreams of a
nice little business, with plenty of profit.</p>

<p class="letter">Out of 14 men in the prison laundry at
X&mdash;&mdash; last year only one expressed his intention of
going on the crook again. The remainder had plans for making
honest livings&mdash;wonderful&mdash;and in some cases quite
feasible plans. The only difficulty was the absence of capital,
which they declared, the Discharged Prisoners' association ought
to provide. Failing that, they would have to do a job to get the
capital and then settle down to a prosperous life.</p>

<p class="letter">Their castles in the air have been exchanged
once more for a castle of another sort. I'm afraid that you have
omitted reference to that unusually successful crook, the
'mixer,' who mixes his operations with honest work. He is in a
position to select only the best opportunities, thereby making
detection doubly difficult, for the police usually identify a
certain class of crime with a certain class of rogue.</p>

<p class="letter">He may act as a receiver one day, a smuggler
the next and a secret printer of filth another time. He is an
opportunist and as such successful. If caught, his period of
honest work is in his favor and he gets a light sentence.</p>

<h3>Not Heroes</h3>

<p class="first">WITH this view there can be no disagreement,
except that the mixer is the type that one does not get
acquainted with for various obvious reasons. But when the dreams
of convicted persons are revealed, of these nice little
businesses which can be started with a little capital, is not the
whole psychology of the criminal world exposed? Why should a man
because he has been arrested and convicted of a crime, consider
that he is entitled to start a business on capital either
borrowed or stolen? Are there not a large proportion of the
population working for their living and saving their money to the
same end?</p>

<p>That is the trouble with the majority of criminals&mdash;they
consider that their very offense and its consequent punishment
should place them in a favorable position. So many of these
people come back from jail obsessed with a sense of
heroism&mdash;they might be soldiers returning from a battlefield
to a land which, according to their views, should be fit for
heroes to live in.</p>

<p>My sympathies, however, are entirely with the writer of the
letter, who so cynically comments upon the efforts at reforming
first offenders by giving them wood to chop, or, as in some
cases, waste paper to sort. The efforts of these societies should
be concentrated upon the first and second offenders. The old lag
should be left to that very large class of philanthropists who
supply money for such hopeless and stupid propositions as
converting Jews to Christianity.</p>

<h3>Honesty Best Recommendation</h3>

<p class="first">IT is very difficult to convince an ex-prisoner
that if there is a good job going the first offer should be given
to a man who has lived an honest and decent life and who has
shown himself in all his opportunities to be a wholly trustworthy
person. Only the grossest of sentimentalists would give
preference to a man whose sole recommendation was that he had
served a term in prison.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a proportion, and, in the case of the
first offender, a very large proportion of criminals can be
turned into honest citizens, but the habitual offender desires
nothing but a chance of making money easy, and he will drift from
prison to prison and eventually to the workhouse infirmary, where
he will die.</p>

<h3>Not Dogged by Detectives</h3>

<p class="first">THERE is a legend, fostered by a certain type of
criminal, that they cannot get work because they are persistently
dogged by Scotland Yard, who inform their employers of their
previous record. This is not only a lie, but a wicked lie. The
detectives employed to watch ex-convicts are most careful never
to betray them. About a year ago a detective sergeant came to me
to make inquiries about a man with whom I had a casual
acquaintance.</p>

<p>"O, yes," I said, "I know all about him. He's a convict on
license, isn't he?"</p>

<p>The officer smiled.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't told me that," he said, "I shouldn't have told
you."</p>

<p>And this is perfectly true. The police are most punctilious in
keeping the record of ex-prisoners within the four walls of
Scotland Yard, and there is no better friend to the criminal that
the men whose task it is to counter their activities.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1929-01-06"></a>POLICE AND HOW THEY DO IT</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Boston Globe</i>, 6 January 1929</h3>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">I REFERRED in my last article to the attitude of
the police toward the underworld. Between these two conflicting
forces there is a sort of camaraderie which is difficult for the
outsider to understand. They know one another by their Christian
names, they meet in the friendliest terms, there is no real
enmity between them&mdash;I am referring of course to the
regulars of the underworld.</p>

<p>At this moment, when London police are being blackguarded and
every effort is being made to undermine our faith in them, it may
be well to state the attitude of the criminal towards the two
branches of the service.</p>

<p>A uniformed policeman (or, as he is called, a "flattie") has
no more significance to the criminal than a bus conductor or a
postman. He is a man who can arrest him; he is an inconvenient
figure who may appear by accident on the scene of a burglary, and
he is a tough nut to tackle in a fight. For the uniformed
policeman, the criminal has an odd sort of half-pitying respect.
He is not afraid of him except when he is called by an outraged
householder to receive the vile body of a burglar caught in the
act.</p>

<h3>It's the Plain Clothes Man</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN the underworld talks of the police he
refers to the plainclothesman, the member if the C.I.D. Oddly
enough, he never connects his enemies with Scotland Yard. The big
man is not Mr. Wensley or Mr. Brown or the central detective
inspectors of Scotland Yard, but the divisional inspector of the
district in which the law-breaker is living or operating.</p>

<p>It is the big man who pulls him into divisional headquarters
and questions him on his movements "on the night in question." It
is the big fellow who has his eye on him when, as a convict on
license, he reports to the local police station. The divisional
inspector is the terrifying father of a large and apprehensive
family.</p>

<p>As I have said before, no thief cares to operate in his own
district&mdash;or, as he calls it "manor." That is "taking a
liberty," and a liberty which will be very much resented by the
lord of that manor.</p>

<p>There are very few criminals who are not on perfectly good
terms with the men who know them best. There are scores of cases
where old offenders who get into some other kind of trouble than
that which calls for the attention of the police will go to
headquarters to seek the advice and help of the man who, sooner
or later, will order their arrest. I have known highly placed
detectives to be called up at night to secure the admission of
some member of a criminal family into a hospital.</p>

<p>It is not, of course, all love and harmony. Ninety-nine
percent of the underworld, when Nemesis overtakes them, protest
with the utmost vehemence that they are victims of a police plot,
that the evidence given against them is entirely false and that
they have been shopping innocently. That is because a criminal
believes that if some portion of the evidence against him is not
exact he is entitled to have the rest of the evidence dismissed
as perjury. I will give an example.</p>

<p>About four years ago  a housebreaker was arrested when
entering a mansion flat, the owners of which were away at the
seaside. The evidence of the two detectives who arrested him was
that they had seen him behaving suspiciously in the region of
Shepherd's Bush and had followed him to Bayswater, keeping him
under observation, had seen him enter a back garden and had
caught him in the act of forcing a window.</p>

<p>The man protested his innocence with the utmost violence and
in the dock of the Old Bailey ha made a passionate attack upon
the police and their veracity. He was removed from the dock
foaming at the mouth and to the ordinary observer it almost
seemed that this was a case of mistaken identity and that the man
was innocent.</p>

<p>The truth was this: The detectives had seen a man in the
neighborhood of Shepherd's Bush who was trying to get into an
empty house. They missed him and later picked him up, as they
thought, and followed him to the scene of the housebreaking. But
by an odd coincidence which would be unbelievable if it were put
into a work of fiction, the man they followed and subsequently
arrested was not the man who had been behaving suspiciously in
Shepherd's Bush.</p>

<p>The prisoner knew they were mistaken, and it was this little
bit of their evidence which roused him to frenzy. The fact that
he had been taken red-handed was quite beside the point. Here
were two men standing in the witness box, swearing on a
prayerbook to what was obviously a lie, for he was conscious of
the fact that he had not been near Shepherd's Bush that day.</p>

<h3>The Classic Alibi</h3>

<p class="first">THIS is not an extreme instance, nor is it very
unusual, and juries, who are often impressed by the extraordinary
eagerness of a prisoner in denying the evidence of the police,
will probably find the reason in an oft-repeated protest against
some section of the evidence.</p>

<p>That blessed word "alibi" leads many a prisoner astray and 90
percent of men on trial are under the impression that if they can
disturb even a minute and unimportant piece of testimony by the
police they can emerge from the court free men and with flying
colors.</p>

<p>Unless a man is actually caught redhanded, the alibi is his
inevitable defense, and a great deal of the detective's days and
nights are spent in sifting these.</p>

<p>The fairness of the police in dealing with the criminal
classes is more than half their strength. If there is anything to
be said for a man on charge it is the detective officer in
control of the case who says it. The fact that they do not trump
up charges or evidence and that they will go out of their way to
examine some aspect of the case which tells in the prisoner's
favor actually simplifies the work of the detecting
department.</p>

<p>Almost the first request that a man makes of the detective who
arrests him is: "Make it as light for me as you can," and I have
known prisoners to debate all the way to the police station as to
the section under which they should be charged. Most of the old
offenders have a horror of being charged "under the act" (the
Prevention of Crimes act), and they know that it is up to their
captor to determine to a very large extent the length of their
sentence.</p>

<p>The police are very patient and very merciful; they display an
uncanny knowledge of the punitive requirements of every case, and
while they cannot actually arrange the punishment to fit the
crime they can, and very often do "say the good word" at the
crucial moment of the trial&mdash;which is after the jury have
found their verdict.</p>

<p>The uniformed police are the staple danger to the underworld.
They are, as it were, the entrenched infantry, and the extent of
the peril they represent is known and discounted. The C.I.D. are
the bombing airplanes that come from nowhere and work disaster in
all sorts of unexpected quarters.</p>

<p>The C.I.D. depends to a certain extent, but not so large as
most people imagine, upon the informer. But, as Chief Constable
Wensley once stated to me, "most thieves are their own
informers." It is the running away habit which betrays so many
criminals.</p>

<p>A burglary is committed; the police examining the scene of the
crime and the method adopted, decide that this many be the work
of one of a dozen men. Immediately they begin to search for the
dozen to discover where they were on the night the robbery was
committed. In the course of their search they discover that John
X, one of the suspected twelve, has disappeared.</p>

<p>He had been seen about the neighborhood where he lives a few
days before the robbery, but now he has vanished. His wife
informs the visiting detective that he has gone away into the
country to get a job, or some other equally romantic story. John
X., who lives in Walworth, is eventually discovered in Camden
Town, and with him just sufficient to connect him with the
crime.</p>

<p>It is not always so simple as this, but very nearly so. If
Browne and Kennedy had disappeared from their garage after the
murder of Gutteridge they would have been arrested within a week.
They stood their ground, and that saved them for a long time from
detection.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1929-01-13"></a>SUPERIOR MENTAL POWER</h2>

<h3>Contributed by Francis Golding</h3>

<h3>As published in <i>The Boston Globe</i>, 13 January 1929</h3>

<hr>
<br>

<p class="cp"><i>A New Type of Crime by Strong Dominating Weak</i></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">I HAVE called this article "The New Crime" [*]
and I have hesitated for a long time about writing it at all.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Sic</i>. This is actually the title
that Wallace gave to the version of this article published in
<i>The Leeds Mercury</i> on 22 September 1928. &mdash;R.G.]</p>

<p>The easiest way to dismiss a fantastic accusation is to
describe the accuser as mad. It is not only easy, but devilishly
easy, to discount any story with this contemptuous dismissal.</p>

<p>The other day I showed a letter I had received to a doctor
friend of mine. He read it through and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! This is a mental case," he said.</p>

<p>"And then I invited him to look at the writing, and that put
rather a different complexion on the matter, for the writings of
mental cases are typical. I have quite a number of letters from
lunatics in the course of a month, and one has only to read three
lines to discover the state of mind of the writer.</p>

<p>I am going to quote extracts from a letter, which I am
disguising so that the identity of the writer should not be made
known.</p>

<h3>"Superior Mental Power"</h3>

<p class="typewriter">"...There is the criminal about which you
have not written&mdash;he or she who exults in the undoing of his
fellow.... A friend of mine, a woman with some property, fell
under the influence of a certain occult group. She became
fascinated, and eventually a devotee, and submitted to a form of
hypnotism. It is very difficult to describe this without raising
the suspicions that I am mad. It is sufficient to say that the
woman who did the hypnotizing began to exercise an extraordinary
influence telepathically; that is to say, when they were not
together. The treatment so worked upon the woman that she became
hysterical and was in danger of being 'certified,' and was only
stopped by timely interference from conveying all her property by
deed of gift. I know that this same woman, the hypnotist, willed
another out of her house, which the 'operator' eventually had for
her own. Here again the case was certified as menial. In both
these instances the mischief was wrought by a superior mental
power upon a worker."</p>

<p><br>
So much for the letter, and, reading it as a solitary
experience one would shrug one's shoulders and say "mental," and
forget the poor creature who had written it. We know that
symptoms of persecution mania, and we know all about the poor
creatures who imagine that a wireless is running through them or
that they are being hypnotized.</p>

<p>But we also know that the mind of a mental patient is without
stability or coherence, and that he or she embroiders its main
theme with all sorts of impossible and fantastic side issues.</p>

<h3>Sort of Crime Increases</h3>

<p class="first">NOW here is the fact that has interested me.
During the last two years I must have received more than a dozen
letters, written by people who are obviously sane, if handwriting
goes for anything, telling me exactly the same story, without any
florid et ceteras!</p>

<p>In other words, one may assume that there is a new type of
"mental criminal;" that is to say, a criminal who can by the
exercise of his or her personality and mental gifts, dominate a
weaker mentality and make a profit therefrom.</p>

<p>In every case (so far as I can remember; I have not kept the
letters, and, indeed, dismissed them as mental) there was a
history of occultism at the beginning, and in every case it was a
practicer of this "magic" who gained dominion over the mind of
the novice.</p>

<p>There is support for the theory that such a form of
criminality is on the increase, by reported cases, very often
cases of disputed wills; but there must be hundreds that are not
reported, and I have the feeling that in these isolated instances
we are seeing the beginning of a new phase of criminal activity.
I admit that it is possible that every one of these complaints
might, on a close investigation, be susceptible to the obvious
explanation; but in no instance have I had letters which were
obviously written by mentally unbalanced people.</p>

<h3>What New Crime Means</h3>

<p class="first">HERE is a type of criminal we do not know, and a
dangerous type. Reduced to the simplest terms. A being a
dishonest person and B a possessor or wealth, it is an offense in
law for A to remove the wealth from B's possession without B's
consent. The new crime is to make B's surrender his or her
possessions without threat or violence, and apparently of his or
her free will. The law does not recognize any such human power,
but only the most stupid among us will deny that it exists.</p>

<p>The experienced confidence man has it to an extraordinary
degree; swindlers of all types are nearly as well equipped. There
is no doubt whatever that the psychoanalyst reduced it almost to
a formula, and that quite a number of scientific and unscrupulous
people must have improved upon that formula. It is at any rate a
matter which is well worth investigating, for the practisers of
this new "art" are among the most dangerous members of the
underworld.</p>

<h3>A "Telepathic" Detective?</h3>

<p class="first">THEY are more dangerous because in the strictest
sense of the word they are not members of the criminal classes.
We are probably in the verge of making very important discoveries
in the psychic field, and when the new truths (whatever they are)
are established, when the realities of, let us say, telepathy are
revealed, quite a new department may come into existence at
Scotland Yard. A telepathic section at Police Headquarters might
prove an embarrassment to certain friends of mine.</p>

<p>It is a fact worth noting that, despite the extraordinary
strides which science has made to enlarge the utilities of
machinery, so little use has been made by criminals of modern
discoveries.</p>

<p>There is a type of confidence man which uses the wireless, but
only to listen in to messages which are arriving from incoming
ships. The acetylene blow-lamp and the electric drill for the
opening of safes, and the lavish use of the motor car (usually
somebody else's motor car) alone distinguish the method of the
modern thief from his confrere of 30 years ago.</p>

<h3>Criminals Chiefly Stupid People</h3>

<p class="first">LARCENY and housebreaking are still haphazard
professions in which are employed such casual tools as may come
to the thief's hand. There are not a dozen burglars in England
who possess a complete equipment.</p>

<p>We owe the detection of crime not only to a perfectly
organized Criminal Investigation Department, but also to the
stupidity of the lawbreakers. Now and again at rare intervals we
discover a master mind, but even here it is not a type that would
win success in any ordinary business.</p>

<p>The majority of criminals are men and woman of a lower order
of intelligence than the average artisan, and this explains not
only why they are so easily caught, but also why it is so
difficult to give them a fresh start after they come out of
prison.</p>

<p>The population of the underworld is stupid; it has a cunning
which passes for cleverness and an insensibility which
masquerades as courage. It is almost entirely without romance. A
drab, ugly, frowsy place is this underworld.</p>

I saw his face and nearly dropped the book: the face<br>
of this ruddy-complexioned man was as white as chalk.</p>
</div>
<hr>

<br>

<p class="first">THERE are scores of problems facing the writer of a true story which do not confront the author of an imaginary romance.</p>

<p>The greatest difficulty of all is to disguise the identity of the characters if the story is not especially flattering to them, or if by too faithful a description of the dead one reveals the living, to avoid libel, and, above all, to so word your story that innocent people are not hurt thereby.</p>

<p>Mainly, from the professional story-writer's point of view, the real difficulty is to have a story to tell which has not necessarily a happy but any kind of finish.</p>

<p>Real life stories have a trick of dispersing. As a river that runs into the desert, so does the most concentrated narrative of life spread itself thinly at the end and vanish.</p>

<p>To the story I have to tell there was an end&mdash;definite, dramatic, poetically just.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>I HAD an acquaintance who lived on the verge of friendship. We wrote to each other on various matters; occasionally, when he was in town, we lunched together&mdash;very occasionally, because I ration my mid-day outings: I find that they interfere more with my work than any other form of social recreation,</p>

<p>I always believed him to be a prosperous man. He was connected with an established business, and though he had no partnership, he gave me to understand that he had a generous percentage of the profits.</p>

<p>I never thought of him in any other way than as one very comfortably circumstanced. Moreover, I happened to know his wife was very well off.</p>

<p>I had met her on two occasions&mdash;a rather pretty, commonplace woman, a trifle artificial and hiding, I suspected, behind the geniality, which belonged to her "party manners," a somewhat acid temper.</p>

<p>This was not an exactly baseless analysis for once, or twice in my presence she had flamed out at her husband and she had even been guilty of the unpardonable offence of reminding him that he owed her money.</p>

<p>This was the first intimation I had that he was not as wealthy as I thought.</p>

<p>He was something of a scientist, dabbling a little in the occult. He may have been a spiritualist for all I know, though I rather fancy that his mysticism was of a more esoteric nature.</p>

<p>He apologised for her exhibition afterwards. "She is a little difficult at times," he told me, "and has an ungovernable temper. Life is not as pleasant at home as it might be, though you are the only person in the world who knows this."</p>

<p>Whether I was the only person, or whether this was one of these broadcast confidences which men and women make, which are so flattering to the person who believes be is the sole recipient, I don't know.</p>

<p>They bought a house In one of the home counties where they lived  for a few months in the year. In the winter the wife went to Monte Carlo alone.</p>

<p>By a coincidence, and coincidences of this kind are not rare, I met some people who had been staying at the same hotel as the lady.</p>

<p>She was not very popular with the family, for the had been "carrying on" with a man much younger than herself and made no secret of her infatuation.</p>

<p>They said he was her dancing partner, but from what I subsequently heard, this was not exactly the truth. He was not a professional dancer&mdash;one of those young wasters who seem to have nothing better to do than spend somebody else's money.</p>

<p></p>

<p>EITHER some rumour of the lady's behaviour abroad had reached my friend, or else this conduct of hers was not unusual, but every time I met him he seemed more and more depressed. Then he told me that his wife was talking of divorcing him. She had, of course, good grounds, for he was not better than the generality of men.</p>

<p>In those days, if I remember rightly, divorce could not be obtained by a wife from her husband for infidelity, so there must have been another reason into which I have not enquired. At any rate nothing came of the divorce proceedings, and things went on normally.</p>

<p>I heard from him very rarely. Although I have called him a friend, he was not more than an interesting acquaintance. We had very little in common, except his passion for horse-racing, which, I suspect, cost him a lot of money, and this was probably the cause of his occasional embarrassments.</p>

<p>One day I had a letter from him on black-edged paper, telling me that his wife had died suddenly whilst she was staying with some friends.</p>

<p>It was the sort of incoherent letter one would have expected, and I wrote a letter of condolence, and thought that he now had an opportunity of making a new start and of finding some happiness in life, which I am perfectly sure he had never got before.</p>

<p>As I expected, he married again. I never met his second wife. I was told by somebody who knew her that she was very pretty and that he was a new man.</p>

<p></p>

<p>THE next time I saw him was in Hereford during the Armstrong trial.</p>

<p>I was in the market-place during the lunch interval talking to Sir Henry Curtis Bennett, who was on his way to his hotel for lunch, and we were discussing the possible result of the trial and the effect of certain evidence upon the Jury.</p>

<p>A car passed. The man waved his hand to me and pulled up the machine a few yards farther along. I thought it was an acquaintance of Sir Henry's and did not realise that it was I who had been signalled. He stepped out of the car and I saw it was the man whom I knew.</p>

<p>He was on his way to Swansea, to motor back his wife who bad been staying with some friends.</p>

<p>He expressed no surprise at finding me in this, what was for me, out-of-the-way spot, and after a few minutes' conversation he got into his car and drove off.</p>

<p>He was a very voluble man, the sort or person who would say: "What dickens are you doing here?" and would not wait for my reply, and would go on with something he had to tell me.</p>

<p>Before he went I asked him to come over on the Sunday to dinner. The Press were giving a dinner to the members of the Bar. Though he half promised he was staying at Swansea for a day or two, he did not turn up, and. In fact, I had forgotten I had invited him till half way through the meal.</p>

<p></p>

<p>THE Armstrong case, as will be remembered, dragged on an interminable time&mdash;to my annoyance, for I had accepted a fee to "cover" the trial for a news agency on the assumption that It would be all over in two or three days.</p>

<p>The only good I got out of my stay was that I was persuaded to back Captain Cuttle for the Derby, and that is my only pleasant recollection of the trial.</p>

<p>Two or three months after I returned to London I was commissioned to write a series of articles on famous or infamous murders, and I took amongst these the Neill Cream and Seddon cases. They were both very interesting from the point of view of the psychologist.</p>

<p>I went to a lot of trouble to collect data and became so enthusiastic a student of these two grisly "mysteries" that I thoroughly depressed my household, for I talked of nothing but murderers through every meal.</p>

<p></p>

<p>ONE evening in the late summer, when I was working in my study, a caller was announced. I do not welcome callers at any time, but when I am engrossed in work, they are not only unwelcome, but a positive bore.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Mr. Z.," was the reply.</p>

<p>You know what on itch a writer has to communicate any new fact to a third person and what stimulus he receives from a fresh, unwearied audience.</p>

<p>I had exhausted the patience of my family so that when I mentioned Neill Cream a groan of anguish rose from the table.</p>

<p>"Show him in," I said.</p>

<p>My writing-desk was covered with books and documents, cuttings and photographs dealing with the Seddon murder, and after we had exchanged the conventional greetings and the usual insincere enquiries had been made about our  mutual health, he asked what work I was doing. I thus had an opportunity of enlarging on the subject of Seddon, his cunning and rapacity, and brought in some reference to Armstrong.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is why you were at Hereford!" he said, suddenly interested. "You were at the trial?"</p>

<p>I told him I was not only at the trial, but should have been at Armstrong's execution, but for the fact that he was hanged on the day Captain Cuttle won the Derby, and I had chosen the more pleasant function.</p>

<p>And then I began to hold forth on the peculiar qualities and especially the stupidity of poisoners, how they, of all criminals, denied any confession, hoping to the last that the  lack of direct evidence that they administered the poison would save them from the scaffold.</p>

<p>"But surely such evidence is necessary?" he asked.</p>

<p>I cited him case after case to prove that the administration of poison was very rarely witnessed.</p>

<p>In the Neill Cream case there was a girl who had been given strychnine by the man, but in the majority of these crimes the act of administration of poison had not been witnessed. All the evidence was circumstantial.</p>

<p>"There are two kinds of murders I cannot understand," I said. "One is the trunk murder, that is to say cutting up the murdered man or woman, and the disposal of the remains in a trunk, which is one of the easiest things in the world to identify, and the other is arsenical poisoning, or the administration of any poison  which has a metallic basis."</p>

<p>He asked me why, and I told him what is the obvious fact: that poisons like arsenic are indestructible. They can be found in the body years after the death of the person and the evidence of guilt is buried with them, and is there awaiting a scientific investigation.</p>

<p>The doctor may give a certificate that a man or a woman had died of pernicious anaemia, but that does not mean that the body will not be disinterred at an inconvenient moment and the cause of death diagnosed as arsenical poisoning.</p>

<p></p>

<p>HE was sitting with his back to the light as I spoke, but going over to a bookcase to get an authority on the subject, I saw his face and nearly dropped the book: the face of this ruddy-complexioned  man was as white as chalk.</p>

<p>There were black shadows under his eyes, and the hand that come up to his mouth was shaking like a leaf.</p>

<p>He went out rather hurriedly, mumbling something about having remembered an appointment, and he left me in a condition of mind which can only be described as chaotic.</p>

<p>I did nothing that night, and in the morning I called up a man whom I knew, and who was much more friendly with the family than I.</p>

<p>"What had Z.'s wire died of?" I asked.</p>

<p>The reply that came was a very shocking one.</p>

<p>"Pernicious anaemia!"</p>

<p>What was I to do? All the evidence I had was that he was terribly upset when I had spoken of the indestructibility of arsenic. But  the very horror of the subject may have been sufficient to	 sicken him.</p>

<p>He may not have been of the strongest kind, and I have known people to feel physically ill when they have heard a story which revolted them.</p>

<p>I salved my conscience in the meantime by pursuing a very  leisurely enquiry. It was true that she had died when she was  staying with friends, but she been very ill for a month before.</p>

<p>It sounds a very simple plan have gone to the place of her death and made enquiries of her doctor. That is not so simple if you arc not a detective.</p>

<p></p>

<p>YOU cannot barge into a medical man's consulting-room and say: "Please give me all the symptoms attending the illness of Mrs. Z." He would probably throw you out or, at least, return a very cold reply, the more so as he was the man who certified her death from natural causes.</p>

<p>I didn't know any of the people who lived in the house where she died. We had very few mutual acquaintances. I thought once of consulting my solicitor, but that in itself was attended with a certain amount of danger.</p>

<p>A solicitor may-be a very good friend, but he is also an officer of the Court, and, strictly speaking, it would be his duty to  pass on to the police my suspicions if he thought they were in any way justified. I did at last obtain scraps of information concerning the woman's last illness. To my mind there was no doubt upon the subject.</p>

<p>As a reporter I have been concerned with several poisoning cases, and the peculiar incidence of the illness which preceded death was very familiar to me.</p>

<p>By every psychological test that I could apply, this woman had died of arsenical poisoning, and the assumption was that it had been administered by her husband, who had inherited a portion of  his wife's fortune, though not a very large portion, and a certain number of her jewels, which his present wife was wearing.</p>

<p>I had even thought of making an appointment with Sir Henry Curtis Bennett, one of the shrewdest and most knowledgeable of men. I was uncertain as to the propriety of approaching him direct.</p>

<p>The tantalising thing was that just about that time I was constantly dining with eminent lawyers, and it was on the tip of my tongue on every such occasion to narrate my experience.</p>

<p>I suppose I had the natural feat making a fool of myself&mdash;a fear which dominates humanity to an extent not generally realised.</p>

<p><br>
AND then came relief: looking through the newspaper one morning, I saw a short paragraph:</p>

<p>"The body of an unknown man who had been decapitated on the rail line between X and Y bus been identified as Mr. Z. How he came to be on this section of the line is not known. There is no evidence of financial worry, etc., etc., etc."</p>

<p>For two days I lived in dread of receiving a letter from him posted before his death, but happily for my peace of mind that letter has never been received to this day.</p>

<p>I am not certain whether it was suicide or accident. He had either fallen or jumped from an express train and, since his affairs were in order and be had sufficient worldly goods, the suicide theory was not accepted.</p>

<p>Nobody has ever questioned whether he died through his own act or through a mischance. If he died by his own hand, then the conversation in my little study in Clarence Gate Gardens undoubtedly drove him to the act.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE talkies are the landlady's cat to the theatrical profession; heaven knows what they are going to be to the company promoters. You know the old joke so popular in the Victorian age about the lodger who, when he complained to his landlady that his food was  missing, was told that the cat had eaten it.</p>

<p>To-day the cat has come to life again.</p>

<p>Any producer who takes an extravagant view of the merits of a play and discovers that the public does not agree with him, any actor who cannot draw an audience (because of a bad play), any theatrical speculator who loses his money in trying to foist upon the West End an entertainment that would be hooted In Wigan, come to a unanimous conclusion that talkies are killing the theatre.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago sporting writers were screaming at the top of their voices that dog-racing was killing the Turf. In three years' time, say the present-day prophets, racecourses in England will be sold for building-land.</p>

<p>In three years' time, say the present-day prophets there will be only half-a-dozen theatres in London. the rest will be talkie palaces.</p>

<p>And so everybody is preparing feverishly for a talkie boom, and the dud producing companies will be banding themselves together in a new talkie concern, and we shall read sensational announcements of new British talkie companies which are going to
lick the world.</p>

<p>It is not an easy business running a British producing company, as I can testify.</p>

<p>If you allowed yourself to be stampeded by the sensational happenings of the past six months, it would be a disastrous business.</p>

<p><br>
BRITISH production companies in any case cannot possibly make a profit on their first year of trading, because a film takes a long time to make, a long time to book, and it is a long time  before money can come in, and the difficulties that face the production companies are greater than most people imagine.</p>

<p>This has been a bad year for exhibitors. The King's illness and the cold weather of the winter have played havoc with the exhibitors' profit. An enquiry at the old-established cinema houses in the West End will confirm this fact.</p>

<p>Happy are those production companies which have not sunk the whole of their capital in enormous super-productions, but have felt their way forward cautiously and have fluid capital to apply themselves to the new craze.</p>

<p>I call it a craze without suggesting that the talkie is a thing of the moment, or that in a year of so's time the desire to see English peers talking with an American accent will be sated.</p>

<p>The talkie has come to stay, and the producer who is banking upon the silent film of the future should see a Harley Street specialist. </p>

<p>Exactly what form the talkie will take, whether it will be noisy from start to finish, or whether it will consist in bringing out the high spots of the story, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>If the talking film is a permanent form of entertainment, as I believe it to be. then certainly the English producing companies should have nothing to fear, because talkies are cheaper to make, English voices are pre-eminently the beat for reproduction, and we have other advantages in England which neither America nor any other country possesses.</p>

<p><br>
I DON'T know how many excuses have been offered for the failure of the British-made film.</p>

<p>We are told that we have not the types of beauty, we are told that Great Britain to unsuitable for film-making because of the  horrible climate and especially of its light (I personally shot an outdoor scene last February which is as good, from the point of view of photography and light, as anything you would get in Hollywood), and we have very good reasons advanced for scrapping our studios and surrendering the British film Industry into American hands</p>

<p>One of the reasons most persistently advanced is that our films are barred in America and our own personal market to so small that it is hardly worth while attempting to compete with Hollywood.</p>

<p>There to a Quota Act which compels exhibitors to show a certain number of British films a year.</p>

<p>That Quota Act may not have done us a tremendous amount of good; it may have tempted us to spend a tremendous lot of money subscribed by British shareholders, but it has certainly cost America considerably over a million pounds.</p>

<p>I don't know the exact figure, but let us put it at a million. Does anybody in his senses imagine that the shrewd men associated with the American film Industry are going to take the loss of even a million without a battle?</p>

<p>It is an open secret that great American companies are prepared to spend enormous sums in propaganda to destroy the Quota Act. They are being assisted very considerably by the British producing companies themselves.</p>

<p>There is, as it happens, no need for the foreigner to spend a penny, for the talkies themselves look like nullifying the Quota Act.</p>

<p>British studios are empty, and only in two or three is any attempt being made to produce sound films, or indeed any kind of films. This will mean that there will not be sufficient pictures produced to make up the quota.</p>

<p><br>
WHY the British film industry is in this position heaven only knows. The talkies did not come out of the blue.</p>

<p>Old-established production companies, as distinct from the new concerns which were getting their studios into working order, had opportunities to meet the competition when it arrived.</p>

<p>One bad film succeeds another.</p>

<p>There are times when I feel that the poverty of our own productions is a justification for the Quota Act being thrown on to the scrap-heap.</p>

<p>From an inside knowledge one tries to reduce to first causes the comparative failure of British films, and in order to get a practical understanding of the reasons, I undertook, to the consternation of my directors, the task of making a film myself.</p>

<p>I can well understand their agitation, because I had never spent more than half an hour in a film studio, but the technique was no mystery to me.</p>

<p>In twenty-eight working days I made a picture, the artistic value of which will be decided by the long-suffering exhibitor&mdash;the man whom the Quota Act has really hurt.</p>

<p>I made the picture because I had reached the conclusion that what is wrong with the British film is the director.</p>

<p>There are only about three competent film directors in England; the greater proportion of the others are fakes. Any property man who comes from Hollywood with an American accent and a big cigar can persuade a production company to give him a picture to make.</p>

<p>If he talks long enough and puts a big enough price upon his services, his offer is accepted. He may have been an electrician, or a third cameraman, or a fourth assistant producer, but if he whispers that blessed word "Hollywood" all the English producing companies open their doors to him</p>

<p>He proceeds to impress the child-like directors of a film company by demanding that the equipment of the studio should be changed.</p>

<p>If the lighting is incandescent, he will have arcs; if there are arcs and Incandescent lights, he will have mercuries.</p>

<p>He will bring with him half-a-dozen needy compatriots who, under certain grand titles, constitute his staff.</p>

<p>To show that he is a real producer, he will be dissatisfied with every set that is put up. every "property" that is made.</p>

<p><br>
FOR months he will dawdle through his picture, spending money like water, keeping artistes hanging about the studio from morning till night, and in the end he will produce a picture on which he will stick the label "Super"&mdash;and the producing company will find itself face to face with another deficit.</p>

<p>I am not so sure that he is any worse than his English <i>confrère</i>&mdash;the type of Britisher who works a similar gigantic confidence-trick and who hasn't even the technical knowledge which will enable him to hide up his ignorance.</p>

<p>None of these gigantic hoaxes could be worked if the administration of the film industry was in capable hands. Promoters are, as a rule, more interested in names than in brains.</p>

<p>The average director of a producing company is entirely in the hands of his managing director, and he is more concerned with the finances of the company than with its artistic creations.</p>

<p>I do not speak feelingly, because I have had an experience which is an exception to the rule.</p>

<p>The trouble is that the best brains have not been attracted to this industry. We not only haven't the best, but we havent even the next best. The industry has been treated as a joke, and the immediate consequence of directorial incompetence has been profitable to the bad producer, and has resulted in a flood of unshowable pictures.</p>

<p>We have been badly left in the race, and only the most revolutionary and drastic changes in our methods can bring us the benefit which our great advantages in human material deserve.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">HORSE-RACING is one of the greatest of our industries. It has a bEtter cash turnover than the steel and iron trade and the coal trade combined.</p>

<p>The popularity of racing becomes an enthusiasm on Derby Day and a comfortable ecstacy during Ascot Week.</p>

<p>Consider this: in the whole year of racing only four consecutive days are devoted to the Ascot meeting. To serve the public on those four days an immense area of buildings is maintained, decorated, embellished and beautified, vast lawns keep the attention of gardeners for 361 days, hothouses are filled and emptied, hundreds of painters and cleaners are kept busy the whole year round, builders and glaziers are kept in constant work&mdash;for four days' racing!</p>

<p>And towards the prizes on those four days of racing £40,000 is contributed, so that the best horses in the world shall be attracted to Berkshire; and because the best horses are attracted to Berkshire and all the world and his wife flock to this little Berkshire village, every kind of luxury trade is kept busy for months, and some £2,000,000 worth of dresses, hats and shoes are planned and made for this special occasion.</p>

<p>Even motor-coaches that bring the humbler pleasure-seeker to this venue are designed primarily for the Ascot traffic.</p>

<h3><i>YANKEE SHIPLOADS</i></h3>

<p class="first">AMERICA will send shiploads of tourists to see Reigh Count make his bold bid for the Gold Cup.</p>

<p>Special trains will be run from France full of sportsmen and sportswomen.</p>

<p>By the way, Reigh Count, the American champion, is a long-distance performer before anything else, and the Yankees' chance of grabbing the Cup has not been so bright since the day four American crooks took it by the simple expedient of opening the glass case that contained it and smuggling it away.</p>

<p>What is the attraction of Ascot? Why is it supreme among the race-meetings of the world?</p>

<p>First and foremost, it owes its popularity to British efficiency. The Mussolini of Ascot is a slim, straight-backed lieutenant-colonel of the Household Cavalry, Gordon Carter, whose genius has been rewarded by a knighthood in the King's birthday honours.</p>

<p>Sir Oordon Carter is the genial autocrat who has made Ascot what it is. It has always been something more than a race-meeting&mdash;it is a social function.</p>

<p>Here society from all the world gathers, not to see the racing, but to inspect one another's dresses. The Royal Enclosure is the most exclusive enclosure of the season.</p>

<p>One of the stewards of Ascot is the Viscount Churchill. He is, I believe, steward of no othet meeting. He is intimately associated with the Court and every application for a place in this holy of holies must go through his hands.</p>

<p>It is his business to separate the sheep from the goats&mdash;and many are the goats!</p>

<p>He lives Ascot and thinks Ascot, and no sooner is one meeting over than his department at St. James's Palace is organising for the nest.</p>

<p>He and Sir Gordon Carter are always planning for Ascot, and, strangely enough, it is not the lordly and ladily "privilegees," the holders of Royal Enclosure vouchers, for whom they are planning.</p>

<p>The secret of the Ascot success is that Sir Gordon Carter and his illustrious stewards think democratically. It is for the cheap public they plan, for those in charabancs rather than those who come in Rolls-Royces, and for those who can afford to pay 6s. for a place on the lawn rather than for those who pay £40 for a box over Tattersalls.</p>

<p>This year the 6s. ring is a marvel of comfort and service.</p>

<p>Brand-new buildings have gone up, great lawns have been opened, new stands have been established, tea-rooms and dining-rooms have been erected.</p>

<p>A band of the Life Guards has a stand in this ring, and hard-working gardeners have been busy since Christmas getting ready to delight thé eyes of the charabanc parties.</p>

<p>That is the secret of Ascot, that all the time somebody is planning and thinking for the general public, and it is amazing  that Ascot&mdash; which is the aristocrat of all race-meetings&mdash;should depend, and does depend, for its financial success upon catering to the proletariat.</p>

<p>There is no magic formula here which cannot be applied by other racecourse executives. Some of our racecourses have three times as many days' racing as Ascot, three times as many opportunities to cater for the public. They are content to let Ascot "get away with it."</p>

<p>"How absurd," they tell you when you suggest that they should copy Ascot; "we haven't the revenue. Why. the money that is paid  for the Royal Enclosure vouchers is as much as we take on any three days' racing!"</p>

<h3><i>LEAST IMPORTANT</i></h3>

<p class="first">BUT the money taken at Ascot for the Royal Enclosure is very nearly the least important item. What keeps Ascot going is the revenue from the public stands, and because the accommodation at Ascot is well-nigh perfect (you can get a shave and a hair-cut if you need either) the meeting attracts its thousands of "paying guests."</p>

<p>And because it attracts its thousands of racegoers the executive is able to offer these enormous prizes, and because these prizes are offered, the best horses in the world are entered and the public comes in increasing numbers to see the racing.</p>

<p>It is a benevolent circle.</p>

<p>Three out of every five racecourses in England possess accommodation which is no less than disgraceful.</p>

<p>The refreshment-rooms are hovels, the stands are so inadequate that on a big-race day only a quarter of the people can see the racing. The number-boards are invisible from a short distance, the sanitary arrangements are so primitive that they would not pass a London County Council inspector.</p>

<p>And yet the public have to pay three times as much as they are called upon to pay for the spacious and efficient services in the 6s. ring at the royal meeting.</p>

<p>Certain racecourses are living from hand to mouth. The prizes are ludicrous. It is humanly impossible for an owner to keep horses in training unless he gambles on them, which means that the only people who can benefit are the bookmakers.</p>

<p>Some of the courses are almost inaccessible. Most of them depend entirely upon local patronage, and yet in most cases their shares stand at a big premium. And if you suggest that the company should be reconstructed, that new shares should be offered to the public and money brought in for the improvement of the buildings and the enhancement of the prizes you are met either by a stony silence or by a good-humoured contempt.</p>

<p>And yet it has been proved beyond any question that where the public have been considered, where racecourse executives have gone out of their way to do something for the "silver people." success has followed automatically.</p>

<h3><i>WE WANT MORE ASCOTS!</i></h3>

<p class="first">THIS has been discovered at York, at Doncaster, at Ayr, at Hamilton Park, a Scotch meeting, which really deserves the title of the Ascot of the North, and which is one of the most go-ahead racecourses in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>We want more Ascots.</p>

<p>Racing thrives on efficient and businesslike management. Until a few years ago, when the Jockey Club interfered, some of our courses were terrible.</p>

<p>Do you remember Epsom in the old days, with the uneven track littered with papers and broken glass, with stands that were literally death-traps if a fire had occurred?</p>

<p>See what an energetic management has done with that popular course, which is now one of the best in England. The old building was scrapped and a new and imposing stand was constructed, and within a few years Epsom will offer prizes which will rival the mammoth stakes at Ascot.</p>

<p>If I had my way. I should create, under the direction of the Jockey Club, a new office&mdash;Director of Racing Accommodation&mdash;and would put Sir Oordon Carter in complete control.</p>

<p>If he did not give us more Ascots I should be very much surprised. We need them badly.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1929-09-01"></a>THOMAS ATKINS</h2>

  <h3>As Published in <i>The Legion Book</i> (ed. Capt. H. Cotton
  Minchin),<br>
  Cassell &amp; Co. Ltd., London, 1 September 1929</h3>
  <hr>
<br>

<p class="first">OLD soldiers may die, but their traditions are eternal. I doubt very much, if any soldier of the Crimea walked into a modern barrack-room, that he would feel in the slightest degree embarrassed by the spirit of modernity; and, beyond the change of arms and equipment, he would discover nothing novel in the language of the 1920 soldier.</p>

<p>Still would he find the desperate expedients that kit inspections bring into operation; still would he hear bitter complaints about the quality of the canteen beer; and to his ears would come the familiar groan of the old sweat with twenty years' service telling the youngsters how soldiering was soldiering in the good old days.</p>

<p>The barrack-room is insular. The great events of the world pass on and leave no trace of their interest. New words come into the barrack-room vocabulary&mdash;strange foreign words with queer English sounds; for it is a fact that every war in which the British Army is engaged brings a few odd words and expressions into the everyday language of the barrack-room. I wonder how many people realize that 'bosh', as indicating rubbish, is an Army word which the soldiers brought back from Turkey. They acquired one or two from South Africa; another couple remain from the Great War.</p>

<p>In one respect there must have been a drastic change. In my day&mdash;I first made my acquaintance with barrack-room life at the age of seventeen&mdash;the Army was packed stiff with singers. They weren't good singers, but they sang. You heard them every night in the canteen; you heard them every day in the barrack-rooms and passages, warbling sentimentally. But the character of the songs has probably changed, for in the early 'nineties, and for twenty or thirty years before, the supreme favourites were Irish revolutionary songs!</p>

<p>Songs about Ireland have had an irresistible fascination for Tommy, and it is an historical fact that it was to the strains of 'Tipperary' that the Old Contemptibles performed their most heroic deeds. But 'Tipperary' was a lively tune compared with the more favoured ditties which held the attention of a soldier audience. It was a vital ingredient of most of the songs that we sang in the early days that they should be sentimental, and should deal with poor Irish heroes who had been done to death by the brutal English soldiery. A typical example was 'The Young Hero', the refrain of which ran, if my memory serves me:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
To the old British square they marched our young hero.<br>
'Aim straight at my heart' were the last words he said.<br>
Exposing his breast to the points of their rifles,<br>
When the smoke cleared away our young hero lay dead.</p>

<p class="verse">So they laid him away on the hillside,<br>
Along with the brave and the bold.<br>
Inscribed his name on the scroll of fame<br>
In letters of purest gold.</p>

<p class="verse">'My conscience will never convict me',<br>
He said with his last dying breath.<br>
'May Gawd plead the cause of freedom<br>
For which I am sentenced to death!'</p>

<p><br>
I have heard this same song sung by request four times in one evening! And it was not amongst Irish troops that these songs were popular. Their most enthusiastic singers were the men of the county regiments, and especially the 'London' regiments (the West Kent, Middlesex, 7th Fusiliers, East Surrey, etc.).</p>

<p>I haven't been in a barrack-room for twenty years, but I am almost tempted to go forth on a visit of discovery to learn what has supplanted the sentimentalism of Erin.</p>

<p>The woes and wrongs of Ireland in lyrical form have charmed and thrilled generations of soldiers, and I do not remember one native song that has ever been brought back from any other part of the world.</p>

<p>India has contributed in a very great measure to the vocabulary of the British soldier. Certain Indian words like 'rutee'* are traditional, and will persist long after our association with India has terminated&mdash;as some clever people tell us it will terminate.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>rutee</i>: Hindi word for <i>bread</i>.]</p>

<p>I was privileged the other day to read a letter written by an officer to his wife. He was serving under Marlborough, and one passage in the letter rather amused me:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">The soldiers complain, and continue to complain. They complain about the food, about the length of the marches&mdash;which, as you may well imagine, are long and tedious&mdash;about their billets and their duties, and this was spoken of to my lord (the Colonel) whilst we were at dinner this afternoon. My lord said: 'When you have had my experience with English soldiers, Captain Wright, you will know that they will grumble on all occasions, and fight all the better for it.'</p>

<p><br>
A grouseless British Army would be a monstrosity. Tommy grouses, not because he is a soldier, but because he is British and because it is part and parcel of the national character to grumble when things are going well and to be uncannily cheerful when things are going badly. There is a song, 'Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag'. This did not inspire the soldier&mdash;the soldier inspired the song. For in adversity there is no more buoyant creature than he. I remember during the South African War that if one were under a roof for the night it was always possible to tell when rain was falling upon the roofless bivouac. From out of the darkness came the melancholy strains of the latest music-hall song&mdash;invariably when it started raining on the men who had no shelter but their blankets the troops sat up and sang.</p>

<p>I am curious to know whether certain little practices in the Army have persisted through the years. Is the square-pushing uniform as popular as ever? I rather doubt it, because the square-pusher depended very much upon the smartness of the pre-war uniform. Khaki is not an incentive to smartness and clothes-pride; and, moreover, the privilege recently granted to soldiers of appearing in public wearing the mufti of civilians must have done away with the master-tailor's perks.</p>

<p>In the days when soldiers wore red coats and blue trousers, the dandy had many opportunities of beautifying himself and enhancing his personal attractions. Square-pushing boots, square-pushing caps, silver cap-badges, and a few etceteras which were distinctly non-regimental, lent him some of the fascination of the male peacock.</p>

<p>When Kipling wrote 'Tommy This and Tommy That' he was putting into concrete form the one conviction which never dies in the Army, and it is that the soldier is despised by the civilian population and that his honourable trade is regarded by respectable people as something to be ashamed of.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the Army is very unpopular among the lower middle classes as a profession for their sons and brothers. Why that should be so has been a mystery, but here again the tradition continues. If only the lower middle classes realized the fact, the Army is the real poor man's university. It is to the Army that every young man without a definite profession should be sent to complete his education, to engraft in him a wider knowledge of men and things, and to supply him with a much-needed stimulus to a profession. It would be all to the good of the country if every young man who attained the age of from eighteen to twenty-four, and had not settled down to productive work, should by law be compelled to take the Army 'course'. This modified form of conscription would bring about a radical change, not only in the attitude of certain sections of the population towards soldiering, but in the physique of the nation.</p>

<p>My own impression is that the attitude of the civilian has undergone a very considerable change since the war. That a soldier should not be served in certain bars and public-houses is unheard of in this year of grace, but, strangely enough, the barrack-room view remains that this is still a practice. When, the other day, I invited a man of twenty-one years' service to come to lunch with me at a restaurant (I think he was passing through London on duty), he was aghast at the idea.</p>

<p>'You will get chucked out if you take me there,' he said. 'Everybody knows that they won't have soldiers in West End restaurants.'</p>

<p>While I confess I expected all the old ideas and notions, in fact the very character of the soldier, to have been burned up in the war, and a new type to have emerged, a visit to a military centre finds the Army just as I left it, and I can pick up the same old soldier that I knew and loved in the days of my service. He has the same dodges for evading work, the same bubbling humour, not less funny because of its dourness, the same simplicity of nature and generosity of soul. The words you might not use in a barrack-room are still tabooed; the man who whistles the 'Dead March' is 'for it'; still persists the idea, which dies very hard indeed, that the quartermaster-sergeants buy rows of houses on their illicit gains.</p>

<p>One aspect of the modern Army life I find very curious. In the old days one was not allowed, and certainly nobody seemed to have a desire, to discuss politics in the barrack-room. Giving the soldier the vote was one of the most revolutionary steps ever taken in the history of the Army, and for my own part I believed that it would have a most demoralizing effect. There were neither Liberals, Conservatives, nor Socialists in the barrack-room, and politics came into the same category as religion. It was one of the forbidden subjects of controversy. The curious thing is that, even though the soldier is given the vote, politics are still more or less tabooed. Very wisely the Army authorities do not allow canvassing of military voters, nor encourage candidates to address meetings for soldiers only; and the consequence is that, although the vote has come, it has had practically no effect upon the amenities of barrack-room life.</p>

<p>There is a mystery about the British soldier, a mystery which no man has solved. It is the mystery of the mould in which he was cast, and in which every new recruit is hammered. Why is there no variation? Why is this type eternal? What is there in the Army which broadens and quickens a man's sense of humour and creates the corps spirit which is nine-tenths of efficiency?</p>

<p>For the solution, I suppose, one must go back to the national character, and compare the phenomenon of the soldier's spiritual and mental development with the same process which is going on in the public schools, and which licks the biggest lout into the semblance of a gentleman. Certainly, the soldier does not change for the worse. He could not change for the better.</p>

<h2><a id="Art-1930-04-01"></a>DEFEATING CRIME </h2>

<h3><i>True Detective Mysteries</i>, 1 April 1930</h3>

<p class="first"><i>NOTE: Mr. Wallace's more than 140 detective
novels, plays and other works are well-known the world over and
are very popular. More than five million copies of them are sold
every year. Being in this country on a flying visit he consented
to tell America, through this magazine, what he thinks of our
crime problem, and his opinion follows below. &mdash;Ed.</i></p>

<br>

<p class="first">A NEW form of punishment must be devised if the
world is to defeat crime. I am convinced the present penal
systems are all wrong. Prisons have become so luxurious today
that they are no longer corrective institutions. They have
become a form of social club. Here the criminal is allowed to
associate with others of his kind. He is served with much better
food than he usually gets on the outside. He is allowed to attend
concert parties, wireless parties, sees the latest cinema and in
many places is allowed to smoke. The punitive value of the
sentence is unfelt. Though the time passes none too quickly, the
prisoner emerges from jail morally unchanged. </p>

<p>Reformers who really desire to better corrective conditions
should study the psychology of the criminal. To understand
criminals and their motives, one must affect to have a certain
sympathy with criminal classes. Otherwise criminals will either
lie, or boast of their ill-doings, and surveys will have no
informative value. </p>

<p>Prisons should be made so as to put the fear of God into the
hearts of those who view them from the inside behind barred
doors. A long sentence holds no real fear for the criminal while
conditions are as they are. There is only one way to cut down our
ever-growing jail population&mdash;institute such drastic reforms
that a prison will be made into a place of punishment. Make it so
hard that even continuous criminals will hesitate before they
commit any crime that is likely to send them back to a place with
a reputation worse than hell.</p>

<p>I do not advocate cruelty but I do advocate discipline and I
think such measures could be taken during a short, sharp sentence
that would make life almost unbearable within sane, humane
limits. </p>

<p>A prisoner should never be allowed to get used to jail. </p>

<p>Except for the few years spent in the army, my life has
brought me more or less in touch with criminals and has gained
for me an intimate knowledge of the underworld. In some way, a
legend has grown up that I am in sympathy with professional
criminals and am very generous with them. That is not so. I have
no use for a criminal; the more I see of them, the less I like
them. There is no romance to a crook and I have never yet met one
who could be called clever. Most of them are too lazy to earn an
honest living. Those of them who have sufficient intelligence to
know the difference between right and wrong have other vices
which usually render them most unpleasant members of society.</p>

<p>I admit I am interested in helping the man or woman who is not
an habitual offender, I, too, have had to struggle and I, too,
have known how cold and harsh the world can be upon occasion, but
for criminals in general, I have no sympathy and no respect. </p>

<p>The most formidable weapon that the forces of law and order
can use against the criminal world is the weapon of terrorization
and it should be used without mercy. Strange as it should seem to
Americans, there are few crimes of violence in England. </p>

<p><i>That is because Scotland Yard has well learned how to
terrorize the underworld.</i></p>

<p class="first">THE Chief Constables are holding their annual conference in Cardiff, and They are discussing the question of a better co-ordination between the various police forces with the object of  preventing and detecting crime.</p>

<p>Let boll this bald statement down to the fact that there is in  London one super-efficient Investigation Department, that department is at Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>The Chief Constables of England have the and the right and the privilege of calling upon the London C.I.D. to assist them in dealing with homicide investigation, and to their credit it may be said that they generally avail themselves of the opportunity.</p>

<p>The snag, however, is that the C.I.D. of Scotland Yard is sometimes called upon when the scent is so cold that it is impossible to run the quarry to earth.</p>

<p>Local police forces arc properly proud of their own efficiency. They are naturally a little jealous about calling in outsiders.</p>

<p>Generally the crime seems to be susceptible to a fairly easy solution. All that is necessary is that a few enquiries should be made, a few suspected persons questioned, and a search or two conducted, and apparently the motive for and the perpetrator of the deed will be brought to light.</p>

<p><br>
UNFORTUNATELY, by the time the local police forces discover that their earlier theories are wrong two or three days may have  passed, and they are usually two or three valuable days.</p>

<p>Then Scotland Yard is called in and expected to perform miracles.</p>

<p>What is needed very badly is that there should be one central Criminal Investigation Department for the whole of England, and that it should be separate and distinct from uniformed branch, and should have its posts in every great town throughout the length and breadth of the country.</p>

<p>It should be staffed with men trained at Scotland Yard. If this were done there would overlapping of authority. The Chief Constables of various counties would have just as much authority over the C.I.D. operating in their area as would make for efficiency and discipline.</p>

<p>If fact, more or less the same system should prevail in the country as exists in London, where the C.I.D. is attached to various police-stations which have their own divisional inspector  who works with, but not under, the superintendent in control of the division, except in so far as they are under him for disciplinary purposes.</p>

<p>It would be only natural if the Chief Constables should discuss what has the appearance of being a crime wave, or rather a homicide wave, which has swept though the country during the past few weeks.</p>

<p>What is the cause of this wave?</p>

<p>There are many reasons assigned. One of them&mdash;the most fantastical&mdash;is the possibility that capital punishment will be abolished.</p>

<p>I think one can dismiss that "cause" even without consideration. Murderers never imagine they will be caught and punished. They are firm in the faith that they will escape the consequences of their villainy.</p>

<p><br>
OTHERWISE it is impossible to imagine a man standing over a woman with a knife in his hand and saying: "If I cut her throat I shall not be hanged I shall only go to prison for life."</p>

<p>The idea that potential murderers should weigh the possibilities of light punishment in a period when three men have gone to the gallows is grotesque.</p>

<p>Another view Is that the summer brings certain mysterious influences which make for murder. One often sees it stated that the period of the South-Easter in the Cape Province and the Sirocco in Spain and South Europe coincides with the wave of murder.</p>

<p>Very likely it is true, because both the South-Easter and the Sirocco only come in the hot months, and it is in the hot months that murder is most prevalent.</p>

<p>When you think of crimes you visualise them in the surroundings which are proper to every form of anti-social activity. You picture dark streets and thick alleys, cold and sunless cities.</p>

<p>But the fact is that in the dark days of winter crimes of violence, offences against the person and homicides are much rarer than in the hot, blistering sunlight of the summer.</p>

<p>We have seen in the last month a succession of horrible crimes. Mainly they have been committed in the open, and in that sentence is explained why murder crimes are more prevalent&mdash;especially murder crimes in which women are concerned&mdash;in the warm days than in the cold.</p>

<p>Men and women are creatures of convention. They are tied and bound by certain rules and regulations which they obey without knowing why or even that they are obeying them.</p>

<p>We are tied to houses: we live and sleep in them, or have our work and recreation in them.</p>

<p>If something happens in a room, if we are tempted to commit an assault or behave unusually in a room, the consciousness that we identify ourselves with the room, and that we are, so to speak, exposed to public gaze is quite sufficient to act as a deterrent.</p>

<p>The places where we live and with which we are identified impose upon us certain rules of conduct and certain responsibilities.</p>

<p>The instinct to murder is a common and natural instinct.</p>

<p>There is hardly one of us who has not at some period of his life experienced a desire to sweep some enemy out of existence, but normal men and women exercise the necessary control to check that impulse at its birth</p>

<p>In the open spaces of the country we lose this sense of responsibility. We may not commit murder, but it is much easier to break the law in the open than it is within tho enclosure of walls.</p>

<p><br>
WE are not overlooked; the nearest human being may be miles away and certainly is invisible: there is nobody sleeping upstairs or living downstairs, no neighbour behind the wall.</p>

<p>We are alone under the sky and the sense of our solitude and the sense of our separation from authority is so intense that I have known even the most law-abiding citizens commit acts of wanton damage without any reason whatever.</p>

<p>It is a very delicate matter to discuss relationships of men and women.</p>

<p>Lovers&mdash;good, bad and indifferent&mdash; have been since the world began, and the warm evenings and the natural desire for solitude take them away from the observation of their fellows and generally produce nothing more criminal than what one might expect in the circumstances.</p>

<p>To the brute the dark, warm night offers opportunities and temptations which, if he is a man without scruples and without remorse he will take.</p>

<p>He may not go to the length of murder, but there are scores of cases where he has not stopped far short. Most of the Düsseldorf  murders were committed on warm nights.</p>

<p>It is not the beneficent rays of the sun that have an evil effect upon human nature or that men's nerves are jagged and their reason unbalanced which turns men into beasts and women into gibbering fools.</p>

<p><br>
IF you have any doubt on this subject, go the rounds of the assizes and hear the amazing crimes that are brought against men who live apart from their fellows in the loneliness of moor and heath and cottage.</p>

<p>There Is nothing evilly dynamic in the warmth and crystal-clear sunlight, in the flowering gardens and the spreading trees.</p>

<p>The murder season is the summer season because it is the out-of-doors season, because it lures people away from the habitations of men and the moral forces which are exercised by congregations of humanity.</p>

<p>The lure of murder is the lure of the great out-of-doors.</p>

<p class="first">A PORTLY dragoman watched the little group of helmeted Europeans who were directing the excavations of Tutankhamen's tomb. He turned to his employer, the special correspondent of a London newspaper, and said: "They will find gold and death."</p>

<p>The startled newspaper man asked why, writes Edgar Wallace, the novelist, in <i>McCall's</i>.</p>

<p>"Because," said the dragoman, the old gods live. This man"&mdash;he waved his hand contemptuously toward the tomb&mdash;"was an unbeliever. He found the old gods too late; and he offended the god of all gods, Amen-Ra."</p>

<p>Somebody told Lord Carnarvon this story. He did not laugh at it. He was a very sane, unemotional man. In all seriousness, he immediately said: "I recognize that possibility."</p>

<p>And this is the fact that is curious, that every mummy which is supposed by popular tradition to be "unlucky" is the mummy of one who has defied the great gods.</p>

<p>Tutankhamen was buried with elaborate ceremonial, but they made no image of Ra in yellow and set it at the bow of the boat which carried his swathed body; nor did they paint on suitable plaques the figures of the gods Tern, Shu, Tefnut, Seb, Mut, Osiris, Isis, Suti, and Nephthys and anoint them with cedar oil. And the Spell of Peace did not go into the closed cavern where they laid the body of the young king. Only a great unrest. For although Tutankhamen was hastily recalling the exiled divinities, and had changed his very name to propitiate them, the Old Ones who sit on the Parapets of Hell were not with him, and their wrath dwelt in the pitch-dark chamber where they laid the embalmed shell of the unbeliever.</p>

<p>Some day we shall discover that thought has substance and that love and hate are as material as the rays of the sun; then we shall know that the stories we dismiss as myths and the frantic imaginings of half-demented priests are terribly well-founded in sober fact. Hate may not lie like a cloud over the Valley of the Kings, nor stand, an invisible and vengeful shape, to bar intrusion into the mysteries of the dead; but hate is there, a tangible and everlasting factor.</p>

<p>Very clear-headed scientists viewed the excavations with uneasiness. Such men do not believe in ghosts; but they do not preclude the possibilities of psychic phenomena.</p>

<p>There are hoodoo men and women who doubts this? There are ordinary people who carry with them into house and office an aura of disaster or fortune. The X which produces such phenomena is a mystery as yet unsolved.</p>

<p>In Tutankhamen's tomb was the supreme x, which was death.</p>

<p>With Lord Carnarvon were Howard Carter and his secretary, Dick Bethell, M. Benedite, the French archaeologist, who was in charge of the Department of Antiquities at Cairo, and M. Pasanova. Of those men only one remains alive.</p>

<p>When the tomb was opened two other notables entered. One was Colonel Aubrey Herbert, Carnarvon's half brother; the other was Evelyn-White. When Aubrey Herbert entered the cavern he shivered and stopped, reluctant to go on. "I wish to God Carnarvon hadn't found this tomb. Something dreadful is going to happen to our family."</p>

<p>Before the year was out he was dead.</p>

<p>When the door was forced Carnarvon walked into the tomb with a smile and a jest. "I wish he hadn't laughed&mdash;he will be dead in six weeks," said Arthur Weigall, the writer. Something stung Lord Carnarvon on the cheek. He was a dead man before the wonders of the tomb were fully revealed.</p>

<p>Evelyn-White, Egyptologist and scholar, became a changed man after the tomb was opened. It was as though he were haunted by some unseen and dreadful presence. Within a year he had committed suicide. "There was a curse upon me," he wrote in the letter he left behind him.</p>

<p>The Egyptian authorities brought Sir Archibald Douglas Reed, a great radiologist, to X-ray the mummy. Within a year he was a dead man.</p>

<p>Professor Laffleur, of McGill University, was the first American scientist to examine the chamber of death. He did not leave Luxor alive.</p>

<p>Young men, old men, men in the prime of life, men for whose lives any insurance office would have exacted the minimum premium, died, mysteriously, tragically. Only Howard Carter remains of the principals. Almost every workman who entered the tomb has passed into the shadows.</p>

<p>Seven French authors and journalists visited the tomb; six were dead within two years. When they unveiled Tutankhamen they found a mark upon his face&mdash;the mark left on Lord Carnarvon's face was in exactly the same position.</p>

<p>On the day the tomb was opened a cobra, which was the sacred snake of Egypt, went into Howard Carter's house and destroyed his favorite pet, a canary that the explorer took with him wherever he went; the cobra is the rarest snake in Egypt.</p>

<p>Woolf Joel visited the tomb, and was dead within a year. Jay Gould was taken ill in the tomb and died. To every man without exception who has visited the tomb, misfortune has come.</p>

<p>The most sceptical admit that there is something more than coincidence in the fatalities which have followed association even with minor articles that have been taken from the tomb. Pieces which have been placed in the Cairo Museum have been "working." Attendants whose duty it is to look after these exhibits have sickened and died for no known reason.</p>

<p>The famous Dr. Mardus was convinced that the opening of Tutankhamen's tomb would bring death. "The Egyptians for 7,000 years possessed the secret of surrounding their mummies with some dynamic force of which we have only the faintest idea," he said.</p>
