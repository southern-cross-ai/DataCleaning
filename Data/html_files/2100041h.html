<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Preface"></a>Preface</b></h2>
<p>The Editors of this narrative, some months since, received from Mr. W. J.
  Dew the journals of his grandfather, Sergeant Dew, with the request that if
  they were likely to be of interest to the public, the Editors would put them
  into the form of a book and have them published. </p>
<p>The papers were submitted to the Editors, whose names appear with this work,
  on the ground that one of them is a personal friend of the present Dew family,
  and both of them are well acquainted with the localities and the events referred
  to by the Sergeant. </p>
<p>Sergeant Dew, before his death, left instructions that should his descendants
  at any time determine to make public his remarkable narrative, everything that
  could possibly cause pain to any person living might be withheld from the printer. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the Editors found nothing in the papers the publication
  of which could cause anyone a moment&rsquo;s feeling of annoyance; but any
  attempt made now to disguise the principal characters in the story would be
  futile, for the New South Wales Government has published, in a work called
  The Historical Records of New South Wales, nearly every fact here related. </p>
<p>In fact, a short account of the Bryants&rsquo; escape so far as the official
  knowledge of it goes &mdash; is to be found in most of the so-called histories
  of the Colony. </p>
<p>This being the case, the Editors determined to give the narrative as it stood,
  with only one reservation, and that is in the case of the name of Fairfax,
  which name is a fictitious one; for the family whose ancestor was the officer
  who is known in the book under this name, might possibly object to being thus
  brought before the public. Some slight alterations have also been made in the
  English portion of the narrative in order to disguise the exact locality of
  the early scenes in Mr. Dew&rsquo;s life. </p>
<p>It is only fair to the Editors to reproduce here a part of Mr. Dew&rsquo;s
  letter, written by him, after reading the MS. of the work: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You have performed your task in a manner very gratifying
  to me. I quite agree with your change of&mdash;&rsquo;s name to Fairfax, and
  with your change of locality. I see you have corrected some of my grandfather&rsquo;s
  English and spelling. He was a little weak in the last particular, and some
  of his English would, of course, be too much out of date in these days of foreign
  words.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I
  am, yours gratefully, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W. J.
  Dew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Editors express their indebtedness to the Historical Records above mentioned,
  and to Mr. Barton&rsquo;s volumes in particular, for much information which
  enabled them to verify facts and dates in this narrative. The conspicuous ability
  of Mr. Barton&rsquo;s work has enabled them to gain a knowledge of Phillip
  and his principal officers that, taken with Sergeant Dew&rsquo;s papers, has
  portrayed to their minds a vivid picture of the men. The necessity for curtailment,
  and the lack of ability on the part of the Editors, are the excuses offered
  to the reader, if he, when he has read this book, has not a fair idea of what
  manner of men they were. The Historical Records of New South Wales are largely
  indebted to Philip Gidley King, Esq., M.L.C., of New South Wales, for much
  of what is published in them relating to King. The present Mr. King is a grandson
  of Lieutenant King, and he very generously presented his country with many
  of his grandfather&rsquo;s papers. These documents have been of great use in
  preparing Mr. Dew&rsquo;s narrative. Much that is purely history in Sergeant
  Dew&rsquo;s journal has been of necessity omitted from this narrative; but
  if sufficient interest is taken by the public in what is here printed, plenty
  of material is contained in the Dew papers to make another book of the Sergeant&rsquo;s
  early adventures, in which the matters related would bring to light many things
  never before published. </p>
<p>Sir Henry Parkes, while this was being prepared for the press, was severely
  attacked by certain &ldquo;patriotic&rdquo; members of the New South Wales
  Assembly for having ordered from England a statue of Phillip, to be erected
  in Sydney. </p>
<p>It may appear strange to English readers that while there is more than one
  statue of Cook in Sydney, it is scarcely known to the majority of the Australian
  people that Phillip was the man who founded their country and that Cook was
  never inside the Heads of Port Jackson. </p>
<p>The school histories of the Colony are beneath notice, and the few men who
  have written anything of the country&rsquo;s early days, such as Bonwick, Bennett,
  or Barton, are never read. It is safe to say that not one man in a thousand
  has the remotest idea of the early history of New South Wales, beyond the fact
  that a number of convicts were transported to it something over a hundred years
  ago. Great injustice has been done to the early founders of the Colony by forgetting
  them; greater injustice still is too often done to them when they are remembered.
  For what has hitherto been written and read about the very early days has been,
  with few exceptions, stories depicting the cruelties of the punishments inflicted
  upon the convicts. The felons have always been the heroes and the authorities
  the villains of the piece. Nearly everyone who has written has followed the
  lead of Marcus Clarke. The result is that his powerful novel, and true enough
  picture of one side of the case &mdash; His Natural Life&mdash;has been the
  only point of view most readers are acquainted with. As a consequence, the
  men have been mistakenly blamed for the errors of the system, and no allowance
  has been made for the times in which the events described took place. A maudlin
  sympathy with the convicts has become the only impression too many people have
  of the times; they have no thought for such men as Phillip and King, whose
  great hearts conquered the prejudices of their times and strove to look upon
  their duties as less those of gaolers than reformers. And, above all, everyone
  seems nowadays to have overlooked the fact that the men who came prisoners
  to this country in the very early days were, for the most part, criminals who
  had forfeited their lives to their country&rsquo;s laws. In a word, they had,
  as they put it among the class from which they were drawn, &ldquo;got into
  trouble,&rdquo; and we are apt, so great is our sympathy for these prisoners,
  to forget that no one asked them to do so. For it was only the ancestors of
  persons now living who were sent out for poaching and political crimes and
  such like trifles. Everyone who knows Australia must have learned that all
  the convicts who are remembered by people at this end of the century were really
  quite decent people; the records show that those who came in the last century
  were generally the worst of felons. </p>
<p>If this narrative of a man who lived among these people, and saw them as it
  were from two points of view, does not enable readers to look at both sides,
  as Sergeant Dew did, and if the story lacks interest, it is not the fault of
  Sergeant Dew&rsquo;s journal. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Editors<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sydney, <i>June</i>,
  1895.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter1"></a>Chapter 1</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Solcombe</p>
<p>To you, my dear children, who have as yet experienced no privations and know
  not the true dreadfulness of a life of great hardship, I leave this record
  of your father&rsquo;s early career. May it serve to bring to your minds, when
  those about you too readily judge harshly of their fellow-men, that all, even
  the humblest and poorest, may, if they steadily do their duty, rise to a comfortable
  station in life and win the respect of those whose respect is worth the winning. </p>
<p>That you may be able to follow your father&rsquo;s fortunes from his earliest
  youth down to that happy time when he was able to return from his foreign adventures
  and settle, a prosperous man, in his native country, I have added to my diary
  such particulars as my now failing memory and the recollections of my old comrades
  supply me with. </p>
<p>In the old family Bible which, as children, has so often afforded you, with
  its pictures, a pleasant and proper Sunday afternoon&rsquo;s entertainment,
  you will find on that leaf where your names are written this entry:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center" class="note">&ldquo;William Dew, born February 28, 1764.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It would be no good for me to pretend to be younger than I am, for, with the
  excellent schooling you have had, you could very easily cypher out my age.
  Your grandfather was a good, honest farmer, with a fine turn for smuggling &mdash; as
  who had not in our little village in those days? In truth, as is well known,
  smuggling was carried on among all conditions of people who lived on the English
  coast and in the Isle of Wight; not only the fishermen but the small farmers,
  and even the big squires and landed gentry&mdash; some of whom held His Majesty&rsquo;s
  Commission of the Peace &mdash; had a hand in the contraband trade. Indeed,
  if all we hear be true, the art of landing a keg of good brandy under the noses
  of the Preventive Service is not yet lost upon the island. </p>
<p>Let me try and describe Solcombe as it was in those days, and you can see
  for yourselves if it has as much altered as the men and women are changed who
  live in it. </p>
<p>Solcombe &mdash;  where some of you, as well as your father and grandfather,
  were born &mdash; lies at the back of the Wight, which is the side of the island
  nearest to the French coast, and when I was a boy the farms thereabout ran
  down almost to the water&rsquo;s edge &mdash; that is to say, to the ledges
  of the high chalk cliffs which formed a boundary wall and shut out the sea
  from sight, though in heavy weather its salt spray was flung high upward in
  drenching showers upon the gardens of the villagers. On a rough winter&rsquo;s
  night in the Channel, the roar of the breakers, as they smote the steep-to
  cliffs in all their unchecked fury, would shake the houses of the village,
  and strike terror to the hearts of those women in Solcombe  &mdash; and there
  were many &mdash; who had their men-folk away at sea. Sometimes, especially
  when the force of the wind had broken a bit, the wild clamour of the beating
  surf could be heard half-way across to the other side of the island. Beating
  like this for ages against the cliffs, the sea had hollowed out of them many
  a dark and winding cavern, some of which ran far back into the very bowels
  of the land. And on both sides of Solcombe every little inlet and indentation
  on the coast-line gave a harbour to the smugglers for running their cargoes,
  and the natural caves provided glorious warehouses for French brandy and bales
  of fine silk and other gear sought after by grand ladies who cared but little
  that such things sometimes cost blood and death besides the money paid for
  them. In these caves the smuggled goods would remain till favourable opportunity
  came for either selling them on the island or sending them away across the
  Solent to where they would be quickly disposed of to people who lived by smuggling
  alone. </p>
<p>Difficult of access by land &mdash; save in rare cases &mdash; and familiar
  only to the dwellers in their near vicinity even by sea, these smugglers&rsquo; storehouses
  were seldom discovered by the Preventive Service men; but occasionally an informer
  would betray the intention of the smugglers to run a cargo, and then, perhaps,
  a desperate fight would follow, and more than one poor fellow would lose his
  life doing his duty, and a few prisoners would be manacled and gyved, and marched
  away and committed to Winchester Gaol. </p>
<p>George the Third was king in those days, and the war with the rebellious American
  colonists was looming up, though no one, as I have since heard, ever thought
  it would prove such a great and disastrous conflict as it did. </p>
<p>Father had a great notion of giving me some schooling, for he was something
  of a scholar himself, having in his young days been taught a good deal above
  his station; and so I was kept at the village school till I grew to be quite
  a strapping fellow, and was full sixteen years of age. </p>
<p>The old schoolmaster had at one time been a soldier, and was always telling
  us boys about the doings at the wars. He had fought with Marlborough in more
  than one battle, and was very proud of a scar from a bayonet thrust through
  his leg. Sometimes, at the village inn, where the talk would turn upon the
  wars that were then going on, he would say to those present that, though it
  ill-becomed him at his age to boast, yet could he give them ocular demonstration
  that he had served his country and received honourable wounds; and then, after
  some little coaxing, he would show the calf of his right leg, and condescend
  to drink a pint of ale with the company to the toast of &ldquo;God save His
  Majesty, and confusion to his enemies.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Those were stirring times, for old England was fighting the Spaniards and
  the French and the Dutch, besides having on her hands the rebellion of the
  American colonies and the riots in London. And so it came about that, seeing
  my head had got stuffed full of silly notions of soldiering and going abroad
  to fight the king&rsquo;s battles, my father took me from school and set me
  to help on the farm, in the hope that in following the plough I should forget
  all about the glory of a red coat and white cross-belts and the rattle of the
  drum. My mother died just about that time. She was always ailing, and I am
  afraid that anxiety about me hastened her end, for she was terribly cut up
  at the way I was bitten with the craze for going a-soldiering. </p>
<p>Even now, after such long, long years, I can sometimes see her face, so rough
  and wrinkled with care, yet so full of tenderness and love, as she clasped
  my hands in hers, with the death-shadows deepening upon her features, and a
  strange, yearning look in her fading eyes that brought a quick gush of tears
  to mine. Her last words to anyone on earth were spoken to me, for after she
  had, with failing strength, placed her hand upon my father&rsquo;s head as
  he knelt beside her, she turned to me and with her last breath murmured, &ldquo;And
  God keep you, my son.&rdquo;  Then she gave a long, heavy sigh and closed her
  eyes for ever. </p>
<p>After the shock of my mother&rsquo;s death had somewhat worn off, I turned
  again to my work upon the farm, but the only effect that following the plough
  had upon my mind was to make me continually ponder upon the subject of my wishes
  all the more. I was in great doubt as to which of two ways of serving the king
  and gratifying my inclinations was the shortest road to glory, whether it was
  better to go to sea and fight the Spaniards and French under such a man as
  Rodney, and return to my native village with a pocket full of prize money,
  or to seek honour and fortune with the land forces under our generals in the
  Americas. </p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2</h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Mary Broad</p>
<p>Thus a year or two went by, and I grew less and less inclined to work honestly
  on the farm, and father grew more and more dissatisfied with me. Sometimes
  it was in my mind to take a boat over to Portsmouth and put myself in the way
  of the press-gangs, and thus get sent to sea in such a way that father would
  be made to believe that it was through no fault of mine; but yet, I thank God,
  I reflected that, whatever father might think, my conscience would give me
  no rest for acting such a lie. </p>
<p>It was about this time that Mary Broad became lady&rsquo;s-maid to Miss Fairfax,
  the daughter of the Squire of Solcombe, and I, foolish lad, fell in love with
  Mary the first time I saw her, and thus, with my love for going a-soldiering
  and love for her, my mind was in anything but a proper condition. </p>
<p>Squire Fairfax lived at Solcombe Manor House, and was the great man in that
  neighbourhood. He was a widower, with one son and one daughter, and in appearance
  was a fine, portly man, with a keen, blue eye and a face that showed his generous
  heart and hasty temper. The son, Charles Fairfax, was a lieutenant in the Marines
  at the time that Mary Broad went to live at the Manor House, and I was very
  jealous of the effect his red coat and gold lace would be likely to have upon
  the girl.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s father was a young French officer who had been taken prisoner
  and confined, with several others, in Porchester Castle on the mainland. He
  was a lieutenant in a Breton regiment, and the Solcombe folks, when he came
  to live among them, much as they disliked foreigners, said he was a fine, big,
  handsome man, and he quickly made friends with the Solcombe people when he
  was released. As he came of a Huguenot family, no one was surprised at a Solcombe
  girl falling in love with and marrying him. Yet, such is religious prejudice,
  that when he died, soon after his daughter&rsquo;s birth, the village folks
  said it was a judgment upon his wife for marrying a man who, although a Protestant,
  was yet a foreigner. His proper name was not Broad, but this is what his English
  neighbours made of it, and so, after a time, the family were known as the Broads,
  and Mary always wrote her name in this way. After her husband&rsquo;s death,
  Mary&rsquo;s mother got a living by her needle, sewing for the fine ladies
  who were friends of and visited the Fairfax family, and contrived to give her
  daughter some little education, as education went in those days. Then they
  came over and settled at Newport, and Mrs. Broad opened a little shop, in which
  Mary served, and in which I used to spend a great deal of my pocket money,
  for no other reason than for the pleasure of being served by so fair and sweet-looking
  a young shop-woman. </p>
<p>Old as I am now, I have never forgotten her strangely handsome face and graceful
  figure. She was so different from the other young girls round about, that her
  manner, as well as her beauty, attracted notice. Her father was, as I have
  said, a very handsome man, and she had all his dark eyes and hair, and quick,
  short manner of speech, and even to Squire Fairfax she preserved a demeanour
  that, while not quite wanting in respect to such a gentleman, was yet by no
  means sufficiently humble and proper for one in her condition of life. </p>
<p>Miss Charlotte Fairfax was a spoilt young lady in those days, with a great
  will of her own, and her father was so bounden to her by his great affection
  that she could do as she liked with him. One day, when she was in Newport,
  she went into Mrs. Broad&rsquo;s shop to purchase some lace, or such-like women&rsquo;s
  fallal, and caught sight of Mary. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy me,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;what a pretty girl! And, pray, who
  are you, child? and where do you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, the word &ldquo;child&rdquo; was not to Mary&rsquo;s liking, for she
  tossed her head and gave no pleasant answer, although she knew who it was who
  spoke to her. Then Mrs. Broad stepped into the shop and explained who they
  were, and the upshot of it was that Mary went into service at the Manor House
  as lady&rsquo;s-maid to Miss Charlotte, and in a few weeks began to look more
  beautiful than ever, by reason of the better garments that her mistress clothed
  her with. </p>
<p>The Squire&rsquo;s daughter was then about two-and-twenty years of age and
  Mary eighteen. The young lady was a fair-haired and blue-eyed beauty, with
  a great many silly notions in her head, and a fine contempt for the country
  life she was leading, and the few opportunities it afforded her to show off
  the airs and graces she had learned from her grand cousins who lived in London. </p>
<p>She soon made a confidant of Mary, and, indeed, treated her more as a friend
  than a servant, and I believe that Mary&rsquo;s natural resolution and serious,
  determined nature soon dominated Miss Charlotte&rsquo;s weaker character, and
  that in name only was pretty, yellow-haired Miss Fairfax her mistress. </p>
<p>Indeed, &rsquo;twas this strong, determined nature of hers that made Mary
  Broad go through so much future misery with calm, unswerving fortitude for
  Will Bryant&mdash; as you will see before I come to the end of this journal. </p>
<p>The Bryants were well known in Solcombe, although they lived a few miles from
  the village. They came of Irish folk, and were not much liked in the neighbourhood,
  for the Isle of Wighters thought that the Bryants, being Irishers, must be
  in secret sympathy with the French, and, as was natural and proper, we hated
  the French in those days, and were active in showing it, too. Why, I remember,
  long years afterwards, when there came some fear of Bonaparte landing on the
  south coast and conquering the country, and making us either turn Papists or
  let our throats be cut, we formed volunteer companies &mdash; that is, we served
  without pay  &mdash; to defend the island. There is a story that one day a
  poor monkey that some sailor had brought home from foreign parts was given
  by him to an innkeeper in payment for his score. The creature escaped, and
  was captured late at night somewhere near Shanklin, by some ignorant rustics,
  and hanged in the belief that the poor animal was a French spy. Of course this
  story may not be true, and I have my doubts about it; but, however that may
  be, we were very jealous in our hatred of the French, and, indeed, of people
  who were suspected of having sympathy with them, and the Isle of Wight rustics,
  to the present day, are very ignorant. Fortunately, the Bryants were Protestants,
  and, by reason of this, were not so much suspected and disliked as they would
  have been had they been Papists, and just at this particular time we did not
  happen to be quite so bitter against the French, and had not the fear of Bonaparte
  attempting a landing as we had later on. </p>
<p>The Bryant family, father, mother, and two sons, were either always smuggling
  or poaching, and the eldest son, William &mdash; the only one who has anything
  to do with this narrative &mdash; was the most notorious and daring smuggler
  on the island. He pretended to get his living as a waterman plying between
  Ryde and Portsmouth, but precious little work he did in that way. But &mdash; and
  this galled my jealous mind greatly &mdash; he had served a commission in a
  king&rsquo;s ship at one time, and had been one of a cutting-out party which
  captured a big French privateer belonging to St. Malo, as she lay at anchor
  off the French coast. Many a yarn he would tell of his adventures, and this
  and his fine figure and great strength made him very popular with men and women
  both. And then, besides, he was a man ever free with his money, and I believe
  that this had much to do with the hold he gained upon the affections of Mary
  Broad. </p>
<p>One autumn afternoon in the year 1786, I was walking moodily along the ledge
  of one of the high cliffs, looking out seawards and thinking what I would give
  to be the captain of a frigate that was in sight bowling down Channel before
  a nine-knot breeze, when, as I turned my eyes landward again, I saw Mary coming
  towards me.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page012.jpg" width="505" height="750"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  thought I, &ldquo;to be Captain William Dew, R.N., and
  to have Mary to wife! What more could man desire?&rdquo; and then I hastened
  towards her. </p>
<p>I saw by the turn of her eye that she was not over pleased to see me, for
  she made as if to walk away in the other direction, but I hastened towards
  her, and, seeing this, she waited for me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you frightened of me, or do you dislike me so much that you cannot
  even stop to speak to me, Mary?&rdquo; I asked; and the figure of Will Bryant
  being in my mind made me speak somewhat wrathfully. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Frightened, indeed! William Dew,&rdquo; quoth she, and her black eyes
  flashed and sparkled angrily, &ldquo;a nice goose I should be to be frightened
  of a big boy like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do you dislike me? And if I am but a big boy, you need not turn
  away because you happen to see me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t dislike you. Why should I? But frightened, indeed!&rdquo; and
  again she tossed her pretty little head, and drew tighter over her shoulders
  her scarlet cloak.  &ldquo;Girls like me are not frightened at over-grown boys
  who spend their days following their father&rsquo;s plough, drink skim milk
  instead of good honest ale, and are regular ninnies.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Now, to be called a ninny angered me, so I answered sharply that even if I
  was a ninny and followed my father&rsquo;s plough, it &ldquo;was better than
  smuggling and only pretending to work.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Her white teeth shone from between her bright red lips in a scornful smile. &ldquo;Oh,
  you are very honest, I daresay; but if I were a man I wouldn&rsquo;t be such
  a coward as to be frightened to help land a cargo; at any rate, I wouldn&rsquo;t
  stop all my life idling about a little village. I&rsquo;d go and see the world
  like &mdash; &rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Lieutenant Fairfax, and come back with gold lace on my coat and
  make love to my sister&rsquo;s pretty maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mean Mr. Fairfax, and I am sure, if I did, it would
  be no business of yours. I was going to say like Will Bryant. So don&rsquo;t
  be so sharp, Mr. Dew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the way we always talked when we had met lately, for I was very jealous;
  but I was no match for her at talking, and where, indeed, is the man who can
  match himself against a woman when the tongue is the weapon? </p>
<p>Of course, you will understand that in such a small place as Solcombe, everyone
  knew his neighbour&rsquo;s business, and the women-folk of our village were
  ever ready to tell stories of one another; but &rsquo;tis the same everywhere,
  even in London. However, be that as it may, it was the regular talk of the
  village that young Mr. Fairfax had been seen more than once making love to
  his sister&rsquo;s maid, and, though everyone supposed he was only idling,
  yet they all said that Mary took him seriously. Now, since those days, I have
  seen much of the world, and I do not think that one should always believe what
  women say of one another, especially where men&rsquo;s names are mentioned;
  but yet, at that time, I did suffer much mental tribulation as to whether Mary
  cared for the lieutenant as well as for Will Bryant &mdash; for of Will I did
  think she thought over much, and so, indeed, did others besides me, for the
  village-folk said that Will had gained her heart, and that she only tolerated
  the lieutenant until the handsome young smuggler was ready to take her to his
  home. </p>
<p>When first Mary went to the Manor House, she had walked out with me more than
  once and given me some slight encouragement, but it only lasted a week or two,
  until Will Bryant came along, and then I saw my chance of gaining her heart
  was very doubtful. Pretty Miss Charlotte Fairfax, as I afterwards learned,
  had much to do with this, for she was always telling Mary what a fine, brave
  fellow this dare-devil Bryant was, and how it was a great thing for so young
  a man to have spitted two French privateersmen, one after another, as he had
  done, when they cut out the St. Malo privateer. And, truth to say, it was no
  wonder the women admired him, for he was a big, strapping, handsome man, and,
  for his skill in a boat, exceeded by no man on the island. </p>
<p>But I was resolved that afternoon to have it out with Mary; and so, presently,
  I went on,  &ldquo;You must forgive me, Mary, but I can&rsquo;t bear to see
  you so friendly with a man whose father holds his head so high as old Squire
  Fairfax. You know that nothing can ever come of it &mdash; the old Squire would
  never allow it; and, Mary, dear, I can&rsquo;t bear to think of the unkind
  things people are sure to say if they see you together so often.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am sure, William Dew! How dare you preach to me in such a way,
  as if I were some silly child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, you know why I talk to you so. You know I love you dearly. If,
  when you gave me the cold shoulder for the sake of Will Bryant, I had thought
  he was worthy of you, I would have broken my heart before I would have spoken
  as I have done; but now that you speak as if you had thrown him over, as you
  threw me over for him, just because this gold-laced dandy has chosen to play
  with you, I must speak to you and speak for your good.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She took a step forward and her eyes danced and sparkled with angry fire. &ldquo;William
  Dew, I will never speak to you as long as I live. I will never forgive you
  your impudence. Love me, indeed! Throw you over, indeed! Why, you silly, loutish
  goose, I never thought anything of you! You clodhopping milksop, Will Bryant
  is worth a dozen of you! Go away like he has done and fight for your country,
  and try to come home and say that you, too, cut down two bigger men than yourself,
  as he has done, then you can have something to talk about; and if you don&rsquo;t
  come back with a gold-laced coat, you can, at any rate, be thought a man. No
  girl with any spirit wants to talk to you now. So now, William Dew!&rdquo;  and
  she turned away with a truly fierce look upon her handsome face. </p>
<p>&ldquo;One word, Mary. Would you think better of me if I volunteered and served
  a commission in the Service? Do you think I should have any chance when I came
  back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to chances, William Dew, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t say anything, because
  a girl don&rsquo;t know her mind for long, you know; but if even you had the
  courage to be a man and see the world, why, of course, everyone would think
  a great deal more of you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then Mary turned her head and walked away, and left me to ponder on her words.
  Those words led to most of my misfortunes, for though, poor girl! I know now
  she only meant them to give me some sort of proper spirit, I took them as an
  encouragement of another kind, and forthwith resolved to try and be a man more
  to her liking. And, as I have said before, this led to my undoing.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">I Am Persuaded By Will Bryant To Become A Man
  Of Mettle </p>
<p>I had now quite determined to enlist in the army or join the navy at the very
  first opportunity that presented itself, for the taunting words of Mary Broad
  had more than ever inflamed my mind in the matter. And so that I might become
  something of a man of the world, and rub off some of my rustic simplicity,
  I began to spend my evenings in the ale-houses near Solcombe, and study the
  loud talk and manners of those that frequented them. </p>
<p>One evening I was in a tavern at Ryde where I met Will Bryant. We fell a-talking,
  and in a while our talk came round to Mary Broad. Although I was so jealous
  of Bryant, he was such a big, good-natured, if idle and dissolute, fellow,
  that I could not feel very bitter towards him, and the pint or two of ale that
  he gave me to drink made my tongue somewhat loose. He understood how the land
  lay with me, and so far from resenting my admiration for his dark-eyed sweetheart,
  he seemed to feel a pity for me. Perhaps this was because he regarded me but
  as an over-grown boy, and so, after some little talk, we grew confidential,
  and before we parted had become quite friendly.</p>
<p>It came about in this way. Will asked me if I had seen Mary of late, &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said
  he, with a good-natured smile, &ldquo;she may have taken more kindly to you
  this last week or two. I know that the wench has deserted me for a long while.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then, all the while in a great fear lest I should rouse his temper and feel
  the weight of his hand and lead to mischief between him and the other, I told
  him how Mary was carrying on with young Fairfax. </p>
<p>He leaned back and squared his great chest and laughed heartily, and said, &ldquo;Oh,
  I know what the jade is after. I don&rsquo;t mind that a bit. Young Fairfax
  is as honest a gentleman as ever lived, and, look you, William Dew,&rdquo; and
  there came a curious look in his eye, &ldquo;Mary is as good a girl as is in
  the world. &rsquo;Tis only harmless fun they are having, though I know that
  Master Fairfax really fancies himself in love with the girl and would marry
  her to-morrow morning if he could get to windward of the old man and talk him
  into giving his consent. And that he is as likely to get as I am to get the
  command of a seventy-four. But Mary amuses herself with him, no doubt, by saying
  she&rsquo;ll marry him when the Squire consents.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;&rdquo; I began, when he interrupted
  me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything, William, my lad. The girl, when she is
  tired of the game and when he&rsquo;s off to sea again, will come back to me
  once more all right. She&rsquo;s only backing and filling like this for a purpose.
  I&rsquo;m in no hurry, but, anyhow, it makes no difference. When I&rsquo;m
  ready I shall go and fetch her and marry her, although some people would as
  lief she married the devil, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His easy, confident manner quite dashed my hopes to the ground, for he was
  such a masterful fellow, and I had seen before this what a great influence
  he had over her that I felt he was right, and he could marry the girl whenever
  he had a mind to it. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But, William,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a good girl, and
  when I do marry her, I&rsquo;ll give her a proper home, and that I haven&rsquo;t
  got yet. I like my freedom and so does she, and we are in no hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take it coolly. I wish I had your chance, Will Bryant. I&rsquo;d
  willingly give up my freedom,&rdquo; I answered with some bitterness. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, my lad. Your turn will come some day, and you&rsquo;ll
  find a maid who will make as good a wife as Mary, only don&rsquo;t look so
  down in the mouth. Why don&rsquo;t you take a trip to sea and have a look at
  the world? Why, lad, I don&rsquo;t believe that you have ever been further
  than Portsmouth in your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Will. I have seen nothing of life, and I have been no
  further than to Portsmouth two or three times and to Southampton once. It is
  not everyone that can get away in a king&rsquo;s ship and cut out a French
  privateer as you have done. I would much like to get a run with some ship to
  the Indies, but I don&rsquo;t want to join the Merchant Service, and even if
  I did, there are few merchantmen about these parts, and no captain would care
  to ship me with so many sailors and fishermen to be had for their money.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Save us! Then why don&rsquo;t you get to learn something in that way?
  Come about with us a bit and learn to be handy in a boat. That would be better
  than following the plough tail and milking the cows all your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time we had had another pint of ale and I was quite pot valiant. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be glad enough to do so,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but I am very
  awkward in a boat, and would only be soundly rated for a fool if you had me
  in yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, William, my lad, if you like you can help us without going
  into a boat. There is a little cargo to be landed not far from Solcombe Bay,
  and if you are a lad of mettle and care to give us a hand with it, you&rsquo;ll
  have a chance to pick up a trifle of pocket money, as well as a little experience
  that will help to make a man of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Will,&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;I know what you mean, but I don&rsquo;t
  want to mix myself up in any smuggling.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;  he said earnestly. &ldquo;Your own father is one of
  the buyers of French brandy when it is landed. Why, even Squire Fairfax himself
  is not above buying the goods, so long as we are willing to take the risk of
  landing them.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And so it was by clever speeches like this that Will Bryant led me to take
  part in my first and last smuggling adventure &mdash; that is, the last adventure
  in which I played the part of a smuggler, for it was not the last in which
  I played a part. But of that hereafter.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page022.jpg" width="515" height="750"></p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">The Evil That Befell Me In Following Bad Advice </p>
<p>So, a couple of nights later, according to a pot-valiant promise I had made
  him, I met Will Bryant about a mile from Solcombe, on a lonely spot near the
  water&rsquo;s edge. It was a very dark night, and though there was no wind,
  the breakers were showing white in the darkness as they dashed against the
  high cliffs on either side of the bay on the sandy beach of which we stood
  looking out to sea. We had come to look out for a lugger, and give her the
  signal that the coast was clear, and Will Bryant had for this purpose a horn
  lantern concealed under his oilskin coat. </p>
<p>In all conscience, I was very frightened, for I dreaded that, silent and dark
  as it was, some of the Preventive men might be about, and that I should be
  caught in this my first attempt to cheat His Majesty the King. </p>
<p>Presently my companion said, &ldquo;It must be nearly twelve o&rsquo;clock,
  William. Stay you here while I go up on the cliff with the lantern. I can see
  the boat from there when she comes near. Now, if you hear the slightest sound
  or see a figure moving about, just walk away quietly up the path and tell me.
  If anyone should speak to you, answer loudly, so that I can hear, and then
  I should know that I must warn the lads off. I shall be just above your head
  on the cliff, lying down, and can hear anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered in a whisper that I would do as he told me, and then away he went
  up the path which led to the top of the cliff, and left me standing, half-frightened
  out of my wits and peering out into the darkness. </p>
<p>I must have stood like this but two or three minutes, which seemed many hours,
  when I heard what sounded like muffled footsteps as they trod upon the soft
  sand, and the sound seemed to come from the path by which Will Bryant had just
  ascended. I turned and moved away a few paces, thinking that he had come back
  to give me some more directions. </p>
<p>In an instant, and before I had time to realise what had befallen me, I was
  seized by the arms, a cloak was thrown over my head and my legs were knocked
  from under me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ram some of that oakum into his mouth and run him through if he attempts
  to move,&rdquo; said someone in a whisper. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir. He&rsquo;s quiet enough,&rdquo; answered another voice. </p>
<p>I knew what had happened, and I take pleasure to remember that, frightened
  as I was, my first thought was of Bryant and what he would think of me. Would
  he think I had betrayed him into the hands of the Preventive Service, for they
  were the Preventive Service, I knew? </p>
<p>But I had no cause to fear that. &ldquo;Drag him into the cave, and you, Ned
  Bolt, stand over him with your cutlass,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;You,
  Southgate, go up on the cliff and tell the others to bring the other bird down.
  Keep both of them gagged, and don&rsquo;t make a noise.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And then, with cruel roughness, I was dragged into one of several small caves
  higher up the beach, and soon there came more footsteps and the sound of men
  struggling with an awkward burden, and Will Bryant was half-dragged, half-carried
  down the path, and then thrown into the cave beside me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Belton, you go up on the cliff with that lantern, and as soon as
  you see the boat show the light three times in quick succession. When they
  run her up on the beach, if they hail, just answer &lsquo;All well,&rsquo; and
  then come down and lend us a hand; we shall want every man.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then I heard Mr. Belton walk off, and thought fearfully of what was next likely
  to happen to me. </p>
<p>The officer gave some more orders to his men, and then lit another lantern
  with his tinder box, and told them to take the cloaks off the prisoners and
  the gag from my mouth, so that he might have a look at us. </p>
<p>In the dim light I could see about a dozen Preventive Service men standing
  near with their hangers drawn and pistols ready, and poor Will Bryant lay on
  his back with a lump of oakum crammed into his mouth for a gag, and his arms
  and legs lashed to keep him from struggling. </p>
<p>As the light fell upon his pale and bleeding features, he turned his eyes
  toward me with such a deadly look of hatred in them that struck fear into my
  heart; but it lasted for but a moment when he saw that I too lay bound and
  gagged, and then his glance softened, and I knew he felt sorry he had led me
  into such a sore predicament. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;  said the officer, holding the lantern over our faces, &ldquo;I
  know the pair of you, but I never expected to catch you at this game, young
  Dew. I thought you were a regular psalm-singing, young clodhopper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time, lieutenant, I swear it&rsquo;s the first
  time,&rdquo; I said tremblingly, for I knew the officer, who was a great, stout
  man, and quite friendly with my father. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. But don&rsquo;t pipe your eye about it; you won&rsquo;t
  be thought any the more of for whining. As for the other fellow, I know you,
  Will Bryant, and by the Lord Harry you&rsquo;ll catch it this time! I&rsquo;ve
  wanted you for a long while, my lad; you&rsquo;re a regular out-and-outer at
  the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll choke the man, sir,&rdquo; I said beginning to weep. &ldquo;Take
  the gag out of his mouth.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear of that, my pious young friend; he&rsquo;ll be choked in another
  way. If I took the gag out, he&rsquo;d sing out to the boat, which can&rsquo;t
  be far off now. I know him too well for that;&rdquo; and with that he turned
  on his heel and went out of the cave.</p>
<p>Presently, he came back hurriedly and spoke hastily in an undertone to his
  men, and all save one followed him to the beach. The light in the cave had
  been put out before this and my eyes had grown accustomed to the darkness,
  and so I could see the bundle in the further end of the cave which I knew to
  be Will Bryant, as well as the face of the man who stood between him and myself
  with his drawn cutlass. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, youngster,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;take my advice and keep
  quiet or I&rsquo;ll run you through the first time you as much as wink your
  eye, and I&rsquo;d be sorry to have to do it, for you&rsquo;re a young fellow,
  and I daresay you&rsquo;ve got a mother.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I began a reply, when he stopped me with a quick movement of his cutlass,
  as a hoarse voice from the cliff cried &ldquo;All well.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then I heard the grating of the boat&rsquo;s bottom as she was run up on the
  sandy beach, and the gruff whispers of the crew. The next moment the voice
  of the lieutenant rang sharply out on the still air,&mdash; &ldquo;Surrender,
  you are my prisoners! &rdquo; </p>
<p>A yell of rage was the reply. Then came the clash of steel and several pistol
  shots, curses, and oaths, and the sounds of a deadly struggle, and I lay and
  trembled and wondered how many were killed, and thought of what my father would
  say when he heard of it all on the morrow, and knew that his son was mixed
  up in such a terrible affair. </p>
<p>The fight did not last more than a few seconds, but to me, lying bound and
  helpless, it seemed hours. Then came footsteps and lights again, and a procession
  of the officers and their prisoners entered the cave. </p>
<p>There were only eight of them all together, and they were far outnumbered
  by the Preventive Service men, who had wounded three or four of them slightly,
  while more than one of their captors was rubbing his head or tying up an arm
  or a leg, for the smugglers were not the men to be taken without giving hard
  knocks. </p>
<p>But the affray was nothing serious, and no one was hurt very much, although,
  to my unaccustomed eyes and ears, a most desperate and bloody battle had been
  fought. </p>
<p>The smugglers came into the cave cursing and swearing that they had been betrayed,
  and declaring that Will Bryant was the betrayer; but when they caught sight
  of him lying on the ground, bound hand and foot, they understood the wrong
  they did him. </p>
<p>Presently the officer ordered us to be ironed, and the gag was removed from
  poor Bryant&rsquo;s mouth. The first words he uttered were in my defence, and
  greatly endeared him to my mind at the time. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You have caught us this time sure enough, Mr. Lieutenant,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;but that boy has had nothing to do with it. I brought him with
  me for the first time, and he did not know what was going on.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then another of the smugglers broke in &mdash; a man who, when they had first
  been brought in, had had his face covered with his neck-cloth to staunch the
  blood flowing from a wound he had received in the fight. His name was Peter
  Collis, a near neighbour of ours at Solcombe, and a good-for-nothing fellow. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What was Dew doing on the beach?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He must have
  played the spy.&rdquo; And several of the others cried out, &ldquo;Yes, yes,
  he&rsquo;s the informer.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I was about to angrily protest my innocence of such base conduct when I caught
  Bryant&rsquo;s eye, and I saw it would advantage me to say nothing. </p>
<p>The lieutenant now ordered us to stow our jaw tackles and keep what we had
  to say for the magistrates, and then we were ordered to march. The guard fell
  in on either side of us with drawn cutlasses in their hands, and we were escorted
  to a guard-house near Newport, where we were lodged for the remainder of the
  night, and of all my companions, I think I suffered the greatest misery.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">I Make A Start In The World Honestly, And Mary
  Broad Proves Her Love For Will Bryant </p>
<p>I will not relate in detail all the fear and grief that fell upon me at finding
  myself a prisoner on such a dreadful charge &mdash; as it was to my mind &mdash; of
  obstructing the King&rsquo;s Revenue Officers in their duty, and the sorrow
  and shame of my father at finding me in such a perilous situation. </p>
<p>On the morning after our capture, we were all marched, handcuffed in pairs,
  into Newport, and lodged in the market-place, to be examined by the magistrate.
  Before entering the magistrate&rsquo;s room, I was taken away separately by
  one of the Preventive Service men to another room, where my father awaited
  me. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page030.jpg" width="678" height="750"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the others were taken before the magistrates&mdash; Squire Fairfax
  and our Parson &mdash; the latter a gentleman who was especially dreaded by
  any smuggler that happened to be brought before him, as he was a very harsh
  man, though he loved the brandy that was smuggled well enough. Indeed, so red
  was his nose, that the fisher-folk used to say that it was as good as a riding-light
  on a dark night. Well, to make a long story short, the eight of them were committed
  for trial at the next Winchester Assizes. </p>
<p>As for the talk I had with my father, it was but little. His reproaches stung
  me so keenly that I could not, for my life, attempt to say much, and was glad
  when I was marched out again, though sadly ashamed to be had up like a common
  thief before the Squire and Parson. Yet it was most lucky for me that it was
  Squire Fairfax, for father had seen him that morning, and, whatever it was
  that passed between them, it made things easier for me. Mr. Sharpe, the great
  Newport attorney, had been engaged by my father to appear and say what there
  was to say on my behalf. </p>
<p>So he just told the magistrates the truth about the matter, and William Bryant
  was called for. Will came in, and in a very honest manner took all the blame
  upon himself for having led me astray, and the Squire gave him a severe talking
  to for his behaviour. Then Mr. Fairfax, taking a pinch of snuff, turned to
  me and said,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, my lad, that you have got mixed up with these law-breakers
  in a laudable desire to learn something besides following the plough &mdash; though
  that, indeed, is honest labour &mdash; in order that you might be of some service
  to your King and country. I am told that you are anxious to serve His Majesty &mdash; God
  bless him! &mdash; and on my making that known to the King&rsquo;s officer,
  who laid you by the heels last night, I found that he is not anxious to press
  the charge against you, and so, the sooner you make up your mind, and volunteer
  for service, the better it will be for you. As for your fellow-prisoners, they
  were caught in very different circumstances, and it has been our duty to deal
  very differently with such villains.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This was a surprise to me, and I muttered something, by way of thanks, in
  reply and left the room. My father followed me out, and in a broken voice said, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, William, you have your wish, and now you can take yourself off
  from the old place as soon as you have a mind to it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he mean, and how has it all come about?&rdquo; I asked. </p>
<p>And then father explained that he had told the Preventive Officer who had
  captured us, and Squire Fairfax as well, that I was mad to go soldiering or
  sailoring, and that this inclination had got me into this scrape. </p>
<p>Then young Lieutenant Fairfax, who was present at the time, remarked, &mdash; &ldquo;Well,
  if the boy wants to go and make a man of himself, let him go, and I&rsquo;ll
  get him enlisted into my company and keep an eye upon him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Preventive Officer, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stand
  in his way, and won&rsquo;t press the charge, if Bryant gives evidence confirming
  his story, and if he likes to join the Marines, why, the Squire can acquit
  him, and the Squire&rsquo;s son can enlist him, and there&rsquo;s an end of
  it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A week later, and I had taken a sad farewell of my father and his sister&mdash;my
  Aunt Dorothy, who kept house for him &mdash; and was on my way to Portsmouth
  in a wherry to join the Marine dep&ocirc;t. Miserable enough I felt, I can
  tell you, as I stepped into the boat in charge of a red-headed, but good-tempered,
  corporal, who, all the way from Solcombe to Ryde, where we embarked, tried
  to improve my spirits by telling me stories of the practical jokes played by
  his comrades on recruits, and warning me to take all in good part, unless I
  was one who was free with my hands. </p>
<p>My recollections of those days in barracks, and all that befell me, are few;
  but, nothing that did occur there had any influence on my after life. I was
  not wanting in intelligence, and, indeed, though &rsquo;tis I who say it, I
  was something of a better sort than the young men then enlisting. Thus I soon
  got out of the awkward squad, and was reported as drilled and fit for duty. </p>
<p>We were then quartered in Weevil Barracks, and Lieutenant Fairfax had returned
  to duty at the same time as I had joined my regiment, or rather division. The
  Marines were in divisions, and, of course, I belonged to the Portsmouth Division,
  and, by Mr. Fairfax&rsquo;s influence, I was drafted into his company. He was
  a most honourable and generous man, and everything that he could do to encourage
  me to learn my duty he did, and did in such kindly fashion as made me deeply
  grateful to him, and anxious to do credit to his teaching.</p>
<p>While I lay in barracks learning to be a soldier, or rather a Marine &mdash; for
  there is all the difference between them, let me tell you &mdash; the smugglers
  were tried at Winchester Assizes, and were all of them, excepting poor Will
  Bryant, sentenced to five years in prison. But Will, because he received a
  bad character, was given a sentence of seven years. I thought a good deal of
  poor Mary Broad when I heard of this, for, said I to myself, the poor girl
  will be greatly upset at such woeful news for her; but then I took comfort;
  and, if the truth was known, was rather glad at heart, as I thought, silly
  fool that I was, that this gave me a chance still to win her when I came back
  covered with glory from my first campaign and talking about foreign places
  and storming parties and the like. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page034.jpg" width="555" height="750"></p>
<p>But all these hopes were doomed to bitter disappointment, for the next news
  I heard of Mary proved how little I understood the great courage and affection
  that lay in her heart for Will Bryant.</p>
<p>One day Lieutenant Fairfax sent for me to his quarters, and I went there somewhat
  fluttered, for, though this young gentleman, by his kind and condescending
  manner to me, had so won my heart that he was to my mind as great a man as
  a general, he was yet so stern when he had to find fault that I cannot truly
  say whether the men of his company feared or loved him most. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Dew,&rdquo; said he, as I stood at the door and saluted. &ldquo;Have
  you heard anything lately of Mary Broad, my sister&rsquo;s maid? I think you
  were a little sweet in that direction, eh, my lad?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; I answered, with a great redness coming to my face; &ldquo;I
  think Mary is a good girl, and I hope she is doing her duty in the Squire&rsquo;s
  service.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have some news that will surprise you. Three or four days ago
  Bryant made a determined attempt to escape from Winchester Gaol, and Mary,
  who had previously disappeared from the Manor House without leaving any message
  or clue as to where she was going, has been caught in helping the lusty smuggler
  out of gaol.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This news staggered me, indeed, but I could scarcely believe Mary would try
  such a dangerous thing as this, and so, with all due respect, I ventured to
  tell the lieutenant. </p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo;  says he, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis true. She got into
  the prison by bribing one of the warders and telling him that she was Bryant&rsquo;s
  sister, and she smuggled in a rope and all sorts of gear, and just as the plot
  was ripe and they were about to get away, the whole thing was discovered, and
  the pair of them are now by the heels.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very bad, sir,&rdquo; I managed to say, &ldquo;What will be
  done to her do you think, sir?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang &rsquo;em both, like as not, I am sorry to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens, sir! they&rsquo;ll surely not hang the woman. She is
  only a girl as yet, sir.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang &rsquo;em they will though, Dew, and although I am an officer
  in the King&rsquo;s Service, and you are only a private, and it&rsquo;s rank
  blasphemy to say so, I wish to the Lord they&rsquo;d escaped and got clean
  away. Look you, Dew, Will Bryant is a devilish fine fellow, too good to be
  hanged, and the girl &mdash; well, the girl is too good for him. That will
  do, Dew, I have nothing more to say to you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>There was a tear in my officer&rsquo;s eye as he said the last words, and
  turned away from me. As for me, I was too completely upset to feel anything
  but a dull sense that glory was of no use to me now, and so I went away to
  the barrack-room, and, lying down on my cot, turned my face to the wall and
  cried like the boy I was, heedless of the coarse jests and laughter of my comrades. </p>
<p>And for many a day after that the image of sweet Mary Broad was in my mind,
  until again I longed for nothing so much as active service, and for the time
  when I should meet that French or Spanish bullet whose billet would be my poor,
  wretched self.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">I Meet With A Startling Adventure</p>
<p>The Portsmouth Division of Marines, to which I was attached, among its other
  duties was called upon to furnish a guard to assist the Portsmouth Preventive
  Service in guarding the long line of beach from Southsea Castle on the east
  to Gilkicker Point on the west, and from these points the chain of sentries
  was continued right along the coast by men furnished from the regiments stationed
  in this district. I was very glad I was not stationed at Gilkicker, for &rsquo;twas
  at this very place that Jack the Painter was hanged in chains for setting fire
  to Portsmouth Dockyard, and his remains still swung from the gibbet at the
  time of which I write. </p>
<p>The ground covered by the Marines &mdash; who were posted each one about a
  mile apart &mdash; covered a distance of more than ten miles or so, and what
  with this, and the many other guards required in a garrison town like Portsmouth,
  it fell to my lot very often to spend a solitary four hours on the lookout
  for smugglers &mdash; doing &ldquo;sentry go&rdquo; as they call it in the
  Service. It was on an occasion like this that an event befell me which changed
  the whole course of my life.</p>
<p>It was on a night in December, 1786, that I was stationed as a sentry on the
  beach. My sentry-box was fixed about five hundred yards east of Southsea Castle,
  and the dark outline of its walls, though such a distance away, seemed to tower
  directly over my head. In those days sentries were only relieved every four
  hours on this particular duty, and visits from the officer of the guard were
  infrequent and irregular. My post&mdash;that is to say, the space of ground
  which I was supposed to cover&mdash;extended over a walk of about two hundred
  and fifty yards on each side of my sentry-box. </p>
<p>It was a pouring wet night, and the wind blew in fierce, bitter-cold gusts,
  and when I marched out to relieve my comrade at ten o&rsquo;clock until two
  o&rsquo;clock next morning, I had it in my mind to pass those weary hours in
  the shelter of my sentry-box. The post was not an important one, and the Preventive
  Service was supposed to do all the watching for the smugglers, while the Marines
  were only provided as a chain of sentries to assist the revenue officers when
  called upon. At least, that was the way in which we used to look at it, and
  mighty vexed we were at being employed upon such work. </p>
<p>When the sergeant marched me up to the post and the sentry going off had duly
  ported arms at the sentry going on duty, and we had mumbled over the order
  for the night, I was unpleasantly reminded of my duty, for, said the sergeant,
  turning to me, &ldquo;Look here, my fine fellow, see that you keep your eyes
  open to-night. We have heard that an attempt is likely to be made to run a
  cargo somewhere between here and Hayling Island. If you see a boat touch the
  beach, don&rsquo;t be in a hurry to challenge. Just let them get the cargo
  out of her, and keep you quiet. Then don&rsquo;t challenge, but fire, and call
  the attention of the guard.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Our main guard was inside the gate at Southsea Castle, and I saw that if the
  smugglers did succeed in landing their cargo anywhere near my post, that, even
  if they got off themselves, the cargo would certainly be seized by the revenue
  officers. But then, I thought, it was scarcely likely that smugglers would
  choose a landing-place so near the Castle, where they knew our main guard was
  stationed. However, I made up my mind to keep wide awake, and resolutely paced
  my five hundred yards, often fancying I heard, through the steadily increasing
  howling of the wind and the stinging showers of rain, any number of boats rowing
  in towards the shore, but never finding these alarms anything more than imagination. </p>
<p>At midnight I was visited by the sergeant making his rounds, and reported
  all well. The two hours that had already gone by seemed to me more than a whole
  night, and, after the sergeant was out of sight and hearing, I stood up for
  rest and shelter in my box, and a moment or two later was straining my ears
  and thinking, &ldquo;Surely that is the splash of oars.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Yes, this time I was right. It was high water, and the waves now plashed up
  to within a few yards of my feet. Between the gusts of wind and rain, I could
  distinctly hear the sound of oars. I carefully re-primed my musket and decided
  to remain inside the box to keep the priming dry, and wait, as the sergeant
  had directed me, until, if this was the smuggling party, they should have had
  ample time to get the cargo out. </p>
<p>In a few moments I heard the boat ground on the beach, and fancied that I
  also heard voices in an undertone; then the boat shoved off again &mdash; I
  could hear that quite plainly. Presently, I heard the footsteps of one person
  on the shingle, and, before I had time to bring my musket to the present, a
  voice said, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sing out, William, I have a message for you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I knew the voice as that of a neighbour of ours at Solcombe, and so for a
  moment my suspicions were set at rest, but the next instant I remembered that
  the man was a well-known smuggler, who only by chance was not with the gang
  that was captured when Will Bryant and his comrades were trapped, and so I
  was on my guard again. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; I asked. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I bring you a message from Mary Broad and Will Bryant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of them, and how do you come by a message?&rdquo; said I. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind how I came by the message, lad, but they send their love
  to you and bid you farewell, for &rsquo;tis likely you&rsquo;ll never see them
  again.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What! are they to be hanged, then? Lieutenant Fairfax told me his father
  was trying to get them reprieved.&rdquo; This was true, for Mr. Fairfax and
  the Parson and a number of the great people on the Isle of Wight had been doing
  all they could to save the poor creatures from death. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re not going to be hanged, but they will be sent to
  Botany Bay, and so, my lad, they have sent their farewell to you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear me, this is dreadful. Why, that is worse than death. I&rsquo;ve
  heard it said that it is more than likely that those who are sent there will
  be eaten by the cannibals if they are not starved to death. But,&rdquo; and
  again I began to remember that he who spoke was a great rogue, &ldquo;why do
  you come here at this time of night to tell me this? Don&rsquo;t you know that
  I might have shot you, or turned out the guard, because, look you, I know you
  must be in company with the smugglers that we are expecting?&rdquo; </p>
<p>The man laughed. &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and the boat I
  came in was the lugger&rsquo;s, sure enough, but there will be no cargo landed
  to-night&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said I, with foolish vanity, &ldquo;we are too clever for
  you, are we?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we knew you were all on the alert, and so, what with the bad weather
  and the danger from your fellows, the lugger has put to sea again. I wanted
  to come to Portsmouth, and so they landed me before they ran out.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What, after the narrow escape that they had when Will Bryant tried
  to run his cargo, are you still risking your neck in this business?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s just it. I ran over to the coast of France and back
  in the vessel, because I had promised to go this trip, but they have let me
  off now, and I wash my hands of the whole lot.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m right glad to hear it, and I hope you&rsquo;ll take
  to something honest now.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that I will, William, my lad; but I won&rsquo;t join the Marines
  and have to spend four hours on a night like this on the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently I asked him how it was he knew where to find me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;one of the hands on the lugger &mdash; a
  spy of ours &mdash; said he had heard some of the Marines say in the ale-house
  that young Dew had the first post west of the Castle, and I thought I would
  get the boat to land me somewhere about here so that I could give you poor
  Mary&rsquo;s message. Well, good-bye, William. But, here, I forgot. I&rsquo;ve
  got something here to keep out the cold and wet. Take a pull;&rdquo;  and with
  this he handed me a flask of spirits. </p>
<p>I took a drink, and I have some remembrance of repeating the act more than
  once, but I recollect nothing else that passed that night, and what happened
  afterwards is best told in the words of the officer of the guard. This is from
  his report: &mdash; </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * </p>
<p>&ldquo;At two o&rsquo;clock on the morning of December the twenty-first, I
  went with Sergeant Brookes and two privates to inspect the guard and relieve
  Private Dew, at number one post, west side of Southsea Castle. The night was
  very dark, and half a gale of wind was blowing, with every now and then very
  fierce squalls of rain. We could not find the sentry, and the sentry-box had
  disappeared. There were many signs that a landing had been made and a cargo
  run on the beach at this post. Private Dew had been visited at midnight by
  the sergeant and all was then well. When daylight came it showed, as was suspected,
  that the smugglers were the cause of his disappearance. There were marks of
  men and horses about the place, and the shingle showed that more than one boat
  had been run up on the beach, and heavy weights, such as casks, had been rolled
  over it. For the rest of the night I doubled the guard and continued the search
  for Private Dew, but up to the present have found no traces of him.&rdquo; </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>This report was handed to the commanding officer early on the morning of the
  twenty-first. A few hours later a dragoon orderly galloped into barracks and
  handed to the colonel the following message: &mdash; </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;At daylight this morning the sentry at number eighteen post, near Gilkicker
  Point, saw an object which looked like a sentry-box, on a small sand shoal
  partially covered with water near the Mother Bank. The officer of the guard
  sent off a boat with a sergeant and two privates to inquire into the matter,
  and in a short time the boat returned and brought back Private Dew of the Marines
  and his sentry-box. The man was in a half-dazed condition and is either recovering
  from drink or from the effects of some drug. He is unable to give any coherent
  account of how he got on the Mother Bank. He is now a prisoner at the fort,
  under charge of the surgeon.&rdquo; </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>This was signed by the officer in charge of the guard at Blockhouse Fort. </p>
<p>Well, to make a long story short, the smuggler rogue had drugged me, and,
  until the surgeon brought me to myself at Blockhouse Fort, I was ignorant of
  all that had happened. </p>
<p>When I did come to, I was, in pursuance of the colonel&rsquo;s orders, marched
  off under an escort to the Clink, as we soldiers called the military prison,
  and there I remained for two days suffering much shame in spirit, and an object
  of curiosity to the soldiers who were my fellow-prisoners and to the men who
  formed the prison guard. The fear of being flogged, and perhaps shot, for deserting
  my post, and the open gibes of my comrades, made those days live long in my
  memory, and the lesson they gave me, more than anything else, made strict attention
  to duty, utterly regardless of private friends, my very first consideration.
  And though no man ever escaped from such a neglect of duty as lightly as I
  did, the fright I had in those two days lasted me all my life in the Service. </p>
<p>After some days, the colonel in command of the Portsmouth Division of Marines
  sent for me, and I was escorted to Weevil Barracks to be, as I thought, tried
  by court-martial and flogged for deserting my post. </p>
<p>The colonel was seated at a table with three or four other officers, including
  the captain of my company, and, to my great joy and comfort, for I knew I had
  a friend in him, Lieutenant Fairfax. </p>
<p>I saluted and stood to attention, and the lieutenant smiled encouragingly
  at me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my lad,&rdquo; said the colonel, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be frightened.
  There&rsquo;s no need to let your hair stand up like priming wires. Tell us
  the whole truth about this affair, and I will do what I can for you. Your captain
  says you have the making of a good soldier in you, and you have a friend here
  in Lieutenant Fairfax. I don&rsquo;t believe in flogging men who get into trouble
  through inexperience, and if you can but show me some reason for leaving your
  post and taking a cruise in your sentry-box and mounting a new guard at the
  Mother Bank, miles from your post, by George&rdquo; (and I saw the old fellow
  and the rest of them trying hard to avoid laughing), &ldquo;why, I&rsquo;ll
  forgive you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then, with a shame-faced air, I have no doubt, I told them about the smuggler
  and my former acquaintance with his sort, and asked Lieutenant Fairfax to confirm
  my story that far, which he did, adding that I was a mere inexperienced boy,
  that the scoundrels had taken advantage of me, and then, like the kind-hearted
  gentleman he ever was, he added that he had no doubt that this second lesson
  in the wickedness of the smugglers would last me all my life. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That it will, gentlemen,&rdquo; said I, my heart taking a great leap
  of courage at his good words, &ldquo;for if ever I drop across the rascal again
  it will go hard with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had questioned me fully as to the manner of my being drugged, the
  colonel turned to his fellow-officers. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen, it is plain that the lad was drugged by this man,
  and that, when the drug had taken effect upon his silly head, the smugglers
  ran their cargo, and then, curse their impudence, out of bravado carried away
  the sentry and his box in the lugger and left him on the Mother Bank on their
  way back to their haunts at the back of the Isle of Wight, or the coast of
  France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, sir, that is what did take place,&rdquo; said Lieutenant
  Fairfax; &ldquo;and he had a narrow escape of being drowned, for the tide often
  covers the spot by several feet where they found him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my lad,&rdquo; continued the colonel, &ldquo;I will give you a
  chance. This affair has got about. All the garrison has heard of it, from the
  general downwards, and everyone is looking to see you get a flogging, and I&rsquo;m
  not sure that you don&rsquo;t deserve it for being such a fool. However, as
  I said, I&rsquo;ll give you a chance. We want volunteers for the fleet now
  preparing to sail for Botany Bay. Lieutenant Fairfax is one of the officers
  of the Marine force going there, and he has asked me to let you volunteer as
  one of the Marine convict guard. I can&rsquo;t get our men to come forward
  very readily, the frightened rascals, and volunteer for the Service.&rdquo; (And
  then aside to my captain, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m hanged if I don&rsquo;t think
  they are right.&rdquo;) &ldquo;But some of you must go. Now, if you will volunteer
  cheerfully, I&rsquo;ll contrive to hush up this piece of foolishness on your
  part. Come, what is it to be?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Shame and grief at this ending to my ambition to become a soldier brought
  the tears to my eyes, and I hesitated for a moment and then thought of the
  greater shame of the cat and triangles, and I answered,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir, for giving me the chance. I am sure your honour won&rsquo;t
  think the worse of me being disappointed at losing the chance to serve in foreign
  wars. I didn&rsquo;t join the Service to become a gaoler.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, my lad, never mind, you&rsquo;ll get your chance some day.
  Meanwhile, do your duty on this service, and don&rsquo;t let these gaol birds
  make a fool of you as easily as the smugglers did. Release the prisoner, and
  Captain Weston, enter Dew&rsquo;s name on the list of volunteers for the <i>Sirius</i>.&rdquo; </p>

<p align="center" class="note">I Am Again Fooled By The Smugglers </p>
<p>The First Fleet, as the Expedition was soon after named, was now all assembled
  and lying off the Mother Bank, that shoal in the Solent on which I had been
  left by the smugglers when they played their scurvy trick. </p>
<p>The fleet was expected to sail in a day after the day I had joined the <i>Sirius</i>,
  and little leisure was given me to say farewell to my father and the Solcombe
  folks; so I wrote a few lines wishing them good-bye, sent the letter over to
  the island by a Ryde fisherman, and settled down to my duty. </p>
<p>When I was rated on board the <i>Sirius</i> on Monday the sixth of May, 1787 &mdash; a
  date ever to be remembered by me &mdash; I was astonished at the great state
  of confusion upon her decks. Everything was so vastly different to all I had
  heard of the neatness and cleanness of a ship of war; but all this arose from
  the nature of the undertaking in which the ship was engaged. All sorts of strange
  stores had to be carried, and so many things to be provided, that it was no
  wonder that those in authority on board the Fleet were at their wits&rsquo; ends
  where to stow them. </p>
<p>Each transport, in addition to the ordinary stores, carried a great quantity
  of implements of agriculture, seeds, and such like things, and some extra clothing,
  such as woollen stockings, shoes, hats, and slops of various kinds. The Marines,
  besides getting a little extra pay, were also provided with some light clothing
  suited to the climate of Botany Bay, where we expected to remain about five
  years, and these things had by some means been sadly mixed with the prisoners&rsquo; clothing,
  through some of these articles having been put on board the <i>Sirius</i> in
  place of the powder and shot she would have carried in a more honourable service.
  So, owing to all the hurry and confusion, my awkwardness on first doing duty
  on shipboard was not noticed, and I escaped the curses and gibes that the Marines
  generally come in for from the sailors when the red-coats go to sea for the
  first time. </p>
<p>The principal officers on the <i>Sirius</i> were Captain Phillip, Captain
  Hunter (the second in command), Major Ross (our commanding officer), and Lieutenant
  King. Besides these, there were the surgeon and Judge-Advocate Collins, and
  some other gentlemen whose names now I cannot recall. </p>
<p>Even amid all this turmoil I thought very often of Mary Broad and Will Bryant,
  and long before had asked Lieutenant Fairfax in a respectful manner if he knew
  aught of them. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dew,&rdquo;  he replied, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll willingly tell
  you all I know about them. Bryant is embarked on one of the transports &mdash; which
  one I do not know&mdash;and my father has interceded so far on his behalf as
  to have secured a promise from the authorities that he shall be a free man
  shortly after our arrival, but he will not be allowed to return till his sentence
  has expired.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very good of the Squire, sir,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but what
  of the misguided young woman?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;By George! Dew, Mary may be a misguided young woman, but she has a
  devilish fine spirit all the same;&rdquo; and with that he told me that the
  Squire had sent the Parson to see her at Winchester Gaol, so that he might
  get her in a humble frame of mind, and then he was to endeavour to procure
  her a pardon. &ldquo;And what think you she said?&rdquo; asked the lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose, sir, she expressed her sorrow for her folly, and thanked
  the Squire.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort. She begged the Parson to do his best to get her
  sent away with Bryant, or at all events, with the female prisoners going out
  with us. So the Squire said as that appeared to be all she was good for &mdash; my
  sister and myself couldn&rsquo;t see any reason why she shouldn&rsquo;t have
  her own way &mdash; he would do his best to get her exiled. That will do, Dew,
  I have nothing further to say to you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That was the way the lieutenant always finished up these little chats of ours,
  as a reminder, I suppose, of the difference in our rank, which was very proper
  on his part, for &rsquo;twas a great piece of condescension for a commissioned
  officer to talk of old times like this with one of his men.</p>
<p>This was all the news I could get of the unfortunate smuggler or of Mary,
  and, although I did make inquiries of the guards on the other ships, the prisoners
  were always kept in such a way that, right up to the day of our sailing, I
  never learned whether or not anyone I knew was on board of the transports.
  All I heard was that most of the prisoners were selected from the county gaols
  on account of their supposed knowledge of agriculture, but the women were nearly
  all the most depraved characters taken from Newgate; and, somehow, I did not
  think Mary would be among them. </p>
<p>And now I come to my last adventure with the smugglers, and when I look back
  at it now, I think it quite a wonder that I was not transported for my silly
  way of being taken in by these people, who seemed to mark my ignorance and
  pursued me with their tricks in quite a marvellous manner. </p>
<p>The lieutenant, full of consideration for my inexperience, and, perhaps, because
  he liked to have me about him, called me to him one day, and said,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sent for you, Dew, to make you an offer which you are at liberty
  to refuse or accept as you please. By the rules of the Service I am entitled
  to one of the men in my company to attend upon me. You can act in that capacity
  if you like. Of course, Dew, I can understand that a young farmer, as you were,
  may have some scruples about acting as a servant, but all the privates are
  of equal rank here, and this duty may relieve you, perhaps, from still more
  menial work at sea, for, I can tell you, the Marines are thought precious little
  of by these coarse, dirty sailors.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I thanked the young gentleman heartily for his offer, and gladly enough accepted
  it, and, though our positions are very different now, I say with truth that
  I am proud of having served so good and honourable a master. </p>
<p>A day or two after this, the first cutter was sent ashore to the Point at
  Portsmouth to bring off some stores for the ship, and, in addition to the boat&rsquo;s
  crew, Lieutenant Fairfax came with us to perform some duty on shore, and another
  Marine and myself were sent with the boat to help in embarking the stores. </p>
<p>While I was helping to put some of the stores into the boat, an old waterman
  rowed his wherry into the landing-place, and calling to me asked if our party
  belonged to the <i>Sirius</i>. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, then,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What officer
  is with you?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;My lieutenant, Mr. Fairfax,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;he will be back to
  the boat directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s the very thing. Well, you&rsquo;d better bear a hand
  and get on with the job so as to be ready to shove off when he comes back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What job?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see this cask of ale?&rdquo; pointing to a big cask marked
  thus, XXX. &ldquo;Well, he wants this changed. They have sent off the wrong
  ale, and it goes agin his stummick, I suppose, and I&rsquo;ve just brought
  it from your ship. They told me aboard that I&rsquo;d find him at the Point,
  and some of his boat&rsquo;s crew would lend me a hand.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me roll it up the street to the &lsquo;Star and Garter,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
  where he got it from.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And so, after four of us had got the cask out of the boat, I helped the man
  roll it up the High Street, and very quick we were about it, for the old fellow
  said that Mr. Fairfax would kick up a great row if the job wasn&rsquo;t done
  quickly, as the ale should have been changed long before. </p>
<p>As soon as we had rolled the cask up the roadway from the Point to the street,
  a Preventive Service officer stepped up, took a look at it, and turned inquiringly
  to me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Officers&rsquo;  stores,&rdquo; said the waterman, without waiting
  to be questioned.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page055.jpg" width="703" height="724"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Cask of ale returned by my officer, Lieutenant Fairfax,&rdquo; I added. </p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my lads,&rdquo; said the officer, and he made a chalk mark
  on the cask and away we rolled it. </p>
<p>The &ldquo;Star and Garter&rdquo; was not far up the street, but it was, owing
  to a turn in the road, out of sight of the Point. When he reached the door
  of the inn, the old waterman turned to me, and said, &ldquo;Thank you, my lad,
  here&rsquo;s the price of a glass of ale for you, and some day I&rsquo;ll do
  you a good turn &mdash; by George! I&rsquo;ll do you one now. Take my advice,
  and when you get to Botany Bay keep your weather eye lifting a bit more than
  you are doing now.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said I, angrily. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he answered, with a rude grin, &ldquo;but
  take my advice and don&rsquo;t tell anyone else. This cask is not going to
  the &lsquo;Star and Garter.&rsquo; &rsquo;Cause why? &rsquo;Cause it&rsquo;s
  going to my place. It&rsquo;s not ale, it&rsquo;s best French brandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I again asked. &ldquo;Does not the cask belong
  to my lieutenant?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, my young lobster. It&rsquo;s smuggled brandy.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You infernal old rascal! I see you have taken advantage of my uniform
  to land your cask of brandy, and this time I shall be ruined. Never mind, whatever
  happens, I&rsquo;ll go at once and inform the Preventive Officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you won&rsquo;t. No one will know if you keep your mouth shut,
  but if you inform the officer you will only get yourself into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, here comes Lieutenant Fairfax, and he has seen me with you. I&rsquo;ll
  tell him and see what he has to say about the matter.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tell him, Joey; he&rsquo;ll only laugh at you. Hang me! I&rsquo;ll
  tell him myself.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr. Fairfax, seeing me talking to the man and so far away from the boat, stepped
  over to us, and the old waterman, touching his hat, said,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, yer honour, but I borrowed the loan of one of your Joeys,
  who seems pretty green;&rdquo; and then to my shame, he unblushingly told him
  the whole story. </p>
<p>Mr. Fairfax laughed heartily, and said, &ldquo;You old rascal, you deserve
  the brandy for your smartness. We&rsquo;ll say no more about it,&rdquo; and,
  turning to me, he added, &ldquo;but I really think, Dew, that this should be
  the last of your smuggling adventures. It is a good job for the pair of you
  that we sail for the other side of the world in a few days, or you would both
  hear more about it. However, the best thing we can do is to forget it now,
  and remember, my lad, that this sort of thing won&rsquo;t do in the future.
  We shall have you letting some of our prisoners escape if you don&rsquo;t use
  your wits more than you have been doing lately. That will do, Dew. Get into
  the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center" class="note">The Fleet For The Colonisation Of Botany Bay </p>
<p>It is proper, before going further with the Narrative of my life, that I should
  give you some account of the preparations that were going on for the despatch
  of the expedition. It is not my desire to attempt a history of the settlement
  in New Holland, or, as it is now called, New South Wales; you must go to the
  books for that. Such things as I have set down are just facts taken from my
  notes in the rough diary of my life, set down without any scholarly skill,
  but yet truthfully. </p>
<p>The fleet was made up of two war vessels and nine transports. The <i>Sirius</i> of
  twenty guns, six hundred and twelve tons, and one hundred and sixty men, flew
  the broad pennant of Commodore Arthur Phillip, who commanded the expedition,
  and who was to be the first governor of the settlement. The <i>Sirius</i> was
  supposed to be a frigate, but she was never built for war, and the sailors
  did not speak well of her sea-going qualities, so that we Marines, in addition
  to the other miseries we suffered, did not feel at all safe on board of her.
  She was built on the Thames to trade to the East, but, on loading her with
  her first cargo, she took fire and was nearly destroyed. This was in the year
  1781, and the Government, wanting a store-ship, purchased her, and she made
  a voyage to the American colonies and back under the name of the <i>Berwick</i>.
  Then she made another voyage to the West Indies, and was then laid up in ordinary
  at Deptford Yard, until the time came when the Government planned this expedition,
  and the shipwrights overhauled her and fitted her out to fly the flag of Commodore
  Phillip.</p>
<p>The <i>Supply</i> was a little, armed tender of one hundred and seventy tons
  and eight guns and fifty men. Lieutenant Ball had command of her. The rest
  of the ships were transports taken up for the Service, and, although I took
  pains to find out many details concerning the expedition, I will not here set
  them down lest I make this Narrative too tedious; so of these transports I
  need but say that their complement, not counting their seamen, was as follows: &mdash; <i>Alexander</i>,
  one hundred and ninety-four male convicts, thirty-five Marines; <i>Lady Penrhyn</i>,
  one hundred and one female convicts and some Marine officers; <i>Charlotte</i>,
  one hundred and six male and female convicts, forty-two Marines; <i>Friendship</i>,
  ninety-seven convicts, forty Marines; <i>Prince of Wales</i>, two male and
  forty-seven female convicts, twenty-nine Marines; <i>Scarboro</i>, two hundred
  and five male convicts, forty-four Marines. And then there were three store-ships&mdash;the <i>Fishburn</i>, <i>Golden
  Grove</i>, and <i>Borrodale</i>. On the two war vessels there were no convicts &mdash; or
  prisoners, as it became the custom of the Service to call them &mdash; but
  there were several officers and civil officials appointed to serve on the staff
  of Captain Phillip when he should assume the governorship of the settlement.
  On the <i>Sirius</i> there was a Marine guard of a sergeant, six privates,
  and two drummers, and I was mightily pleased that I was not chosen to do duty
  on one of the transports. All together the number of people on board the various
  ships who were to form the settlement was about one thousand and twenty. I
  must not forget to say that among the officials were a chaplain (who brought
  with him his wife) and a surgeon and five assistant surgeons; and terrible
  botchers were some of these last. </p>
<p>The transports varied in tonnage from three hundred and fifty tons to two
  hundred and seventy-five tons, and every one of them was crowded in a very
  dreadful manner, and, long before the fleet got under weigh, sickness broke
  out both among the prisoners and the crews and the Marines; indeed, on the <i>Alexander</i>,
  some of the Marines died of a malignant sickness, caused by the foulness of
  the air between decks. </p>
<p>At this time the trial of Lord George Gordon, the impeachment of Warren Hastings,
  and other great State affairs, so disturbed the minds of the Government that
  they gave but little thought to the fearful condition of the wretched creatures
  who were going to Botany Bay, although the case of the wife and children of
  a Marine, who nearly perished of starvation on board one of the transports,
  was made public in some way. </p>
<p>But bad as things were, even for us Marines, they would have been worse but
  for Major Ross, who fought hard to get us proper food and berthing space, and,
  finally, we got pretty well served as far as food went, for the rations allowed
  to each man for one week were as follows: &mdash; Seven pounds of bread (hard
  ship biscuit), four pounds of beef, two pounds of pork, two pints of pease,
  three pints of oatmeal, three and a half pints of rum, six ounces of butter&mdash; and
  terribly rank-smelling stuff it was &mdash; three-quarters of a pound of cheese,
  and half a pint of vinegar. These were to be added to in case we touched at
  any port where fresh provisions could be had, and we were in this matter fed
  the same as seamen in the king&rsquo;s ships. As for the prisoners, they were
  rationed in much the same way, but, in case of bad conduct or breaches of discipline,
  they were made to suffer by having their rations cut down. But many of these
  articles that I have mentioned were not fit for human food; indeed, I heard
  Major Ross tell Captain Hunter that the butter, cheese, and beer were such
  that a well-conditioned hog would have turned away from them with a sickness
  of stomach. </p>
<p>As to the manner in which the transports were fitted up I will speak briefly.
  Abaft the mainmast in each ship was built a strong bulkhead of thick wood,
  and in the forward side &mdash; that is, the convicts&rsquo; side &mdash; this
  bulkhead was studded with stout, sharp spikes, and loopholed so that the guard
  could fire upon the prisoners in case of mutiny. The hatches were battened
  across with thick bars, bolted and locked to the coamings, and railed round
  with strong, high, wooden stanchions, so as to guard against a sudden rush
  from below. Of course, sentries were placed over each hatchway and at different
  parts of the ship, and the main guard was always kept under arms on the quarter-deck
  with loaded muskets. On the upper deck, abaft the mainmast, was built a barricade
  of stout planks studded along the top with sharp, iron prongs, and in the space
  between this and the head of the ship the convicts were exercised. </p>
<p>Truly, it was a dreadful sight to see them caged up like this, and yet more
  dreadful to hear their foul and blasphemous talk among themselves, and their
  horrible jests about their sad condition &mdash; for most of them were utterly
  steeped in wickedness. Many of them, before being sent on board the fleet,
  had been kept in hulks at Portsmouth, Plymouth, and the Thames, and some of
  the transports had embarked their loads of human misery at these places, and
  sailed round to the rendezvous before I joined the <i>Sirius</i>. The <i>Alexander</i> and <i>Lady
  Penrhyn</i> had embarked their prisoners in the Thames, and she had convoyed
  them round to Spithead early in the year, and they lay close to where the <i>Royal
  George</i> had sunk three or four years before this time, her masts being still
  to be seen sticking up out of the water. Long before I joined, the <i>Scarboro</i> and <i>Prince
  of Wales</i> and the three store-ships were already lying at anchor off the
  Mother Bank, and, indeed, were there on the very night when I cut such a pretty
  figure on the shoal. </p>
<p>On the sixth of March all the prisoners were embarked, and the <i>Charlotte</i> and <i>Friendship</i> sailed
  round from Plymouth and dropped anchor with the rest of the fleet; yet it was
  not until the second week in May that our good and esteemed Commodore, Captain
  Phillip, arrived from London, and great was the anger he showed at the deplorable
  state of confusion and misery that existed on board the ships of the expedition,
  which seemed fated to be continually delayed from this or that cause, so that
  not only Captain Phillip but everyone else on board was sick and wearied at
  heart and anxious to get away. The Commodore spent most of his time running
  backwards and forwards to the dockyard people, trying to get them to make the
  rascally contractors serve us honestly, and as for Captain Hunter and his officers,
  they were too busy to trouble much about the Marines, and so we spent most
  of our time in looking after the officers&rsquo;  luggage and such work. </p>
<p>At last we did draw near the day of our sailing. The ships&rsquo; companies
  of the <i>Sirius</i> and <i>Supply</i> were paid a two months&rsquo; advance,
  and, forthwith, many of them got drunk with the bad grog brought off by the
  bumboat women of Portsmouth and Gosport, and assailed many of my comrades with
  extraordinary foul words and blows, and this increased the vexations and difficulties
  of our getting under weigh. Then, even when the warships were ready, the transports
  were not. The seamen of the <i>Fishburn</i> then refused duty, owing to a quarrel
  with the master, and, almost at the same time, those of the <i>Alexander</i> had
  to be replaced by a crew from the <i>Hy&oelig;na</i> frigate, because the poor
  fellows in the transport had not received their wages from the contractors,
  and refused to sail. </p>
<p>A strong westerly wind at the last moment still further delayed the fleet,
  and so it was not until Sunday, the twelfth of May, that the voyage fairly
  began, and we were not clear of the Needles for twenty-four hours later, and
  I think that every man must have said, &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; For all the
  many delays and trials had had one good effect &mdash; there were no sorrowful
  farewells to add to the misery of the main body of our unhappy voyagers. They
  had all been made long before. The sorrowing wives, mothers, and sweethearts
  of freemen and bondmen alike, had long since dried their tears and gone back
  to their homes, where, for many a weary day, they waited to hear tidings of
  the exiles. In those days, you must remember, there were no railway trains
  nor fast steamships, and folks travelled but little, so most of the good-byes
  were said far away from the rendezvous. In the case of the convicts, of whom
  the greater number came from gaols and hulks all over the kingdom, there were
  few free people who came to say good-bye to them at Portsmouth; but the wives
  of some of the officers and men of the Marines came there to see us off, but
  the great delay had exhausted the moneys of the poorer sort, and they had long
  before returned to their homes. As for me, my father wrote and wished me well,
  and hoped that I would do my duty, but he came not near me, and I felt that
  he had not forgiven me the disgrace I had brought upon him. </p>
<p>I heard afterwards, that the prisoners on the transports&mdash; and the women
  in particular&mdash;grew quite cheerful at the sounds of the seamen heaving
  up the anchors, and many of them, in their horrible prisons below, joined in
  the sailors&rsquo; choruses as the men tramped round the capstan. None would
  have thought that the poor creatures were banished from their native land and
  for ever; but the English prisons and the hulks were fearful places in those
  days, and &rsquo;twas no wonder that while I, and freemen such as I, saw the
  white cliffs of the Isle of Wight sink gradually out of sight with sorrowful
  feelings, that these poor creatures thought only of the horrors they were leaving
  behind them.</p>
<p>Our Commodore had already given proof that he was a humane and good man &mdash; a
  man not to be trifled with in his duty, but anxious to be just and do what
  was right in the sight of God, and a man of this quality was just the sort
  of governor to earn the respect of the class he had to deal with. I remember
  Lieutenant Fairfax telling me that one day when the Commodore had boarded the <i>Prince
  of Wales</i>, and had seen the horrible condition of the women&rsquo;s quarters,
  that his eyes had filled with tears of pity, and he had used some pretty strong
  words about the cruelty of the thing, and said it was worse than a slaver&rsquo;s
  hold in the Middle Passage. </p>
<p>As soon as the fleet was fairly under weigh, the Commodore directed the master
  of the <i>Sirius</i> to heave-to, and then signalled for the commanding officer
  on the <i>Supply</i>, with a Marine officer and assistant surgeon from each
  transport, to come on board our ship. Each one, as he came on board, went on
  to the poop, saluted the Commodore, and waited with some curiosity as to what
  he desired of them. </p>
<p>I was stationed as sentry over the stern life-buoy, and heard all that was
  said when they were assembled. The Commodore, looking intently into their faces
  and speaking very earnestly and clearly, said, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I have sent for you all, now that we are fairly under weigh,
  to repeat the instructions I have before given to you individually. I know
  you are all good officers, and anxious to do your duty to His Majesty; no doubt
  on that score troubles me. But I beseech you, gentlemen, to endeavour to do
  all in your power to treat your prisoners with every consideration that will
  be likely to encourage them to good behaviour. We know that they belong to
  the lowest and most depraved class of our countrymen, but this expedition has
  not been formed to punish them on that account, but rather to give them an
  opportunity to redeem themselves in a new world. So, with a view to preparing
  them for their new life, I should like you to avoid as much as possible treating
  them in the style they have hitherto experienced in the gaols and hulks in
  England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for a moment, and then, in somewhat quicker and more decisive tones,
  resumed, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But, gentlemen, at the same time I should like you to bear well in
  mind that insubordination must be punished with even greater severity than
  it would be on land. Therefore, let your prisoners understand that any attempt
  at mutiny or escape will be punished with instant death. Of course, irons must
  never be placed upon the women, no matter how bad or dangerous their conduct
  may be, and as soon as we are clear of the Channel remove the irons from the
  men, so that they may be able to keep their bodies clean, and rest like human
  beings at night. This, gentlemen, with your written orders and my previous
  injunctions, is all I have to say to you to guide you in your responsibilities
  until we arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ceased, and the officers, respectfully bowing, were about to leave the
  quarter-deck when Captain Phillip raised his hand, and said in his gentlest
  tones, &ldquo;Stay, gentlemen; one word more. While we were in Portsmouth I
  heard one of you &mdash; and I beg of him to take no offence at what I now
  say &mdash; remark that we were employed upon a service that would bring us
  neither credit nor distinction, but rather contempt. I implore you, gentlemen,
  not to entertain such an unworthy opinion, for what can be more honourable
  than devoting ourselves to ameliorating and raising to a higher level in society
  these unfortunate outcasts and criminals? May God assist us to fulfil, not
  only our duty to His Majesty the King, but our duty to the Almighty Himself.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then the Commodore shook hands with every one of them, a cheerful smile lightening
  up his face the while, and the officers returned to their ships, the yards
  were swung round, the sails filled, and we stood away on our course down Channel.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Concerning Some Incidents That Happened On The
  Voyage </p>
<p>The <i>Hy&oelig;na</i> frigate accompanied us until we were clear of the Channel,
  and then on May the twentieth she hove-to for Captain Phillip&rsquo;s last
  despatches, and left us to return to Plymouth. </p>
<p>Ere she had signalled &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; to us, the first trouble with
  the convicts began. Mr. John Marshall, the master of the <i>Scarboro</i>, came
  on board the <i>Sirius</i> and reported that there was a plot among his prisoners
  to seize the ship. </p>
<p>Lieutenant Fairfax and the whole of the Marines in the <i>Sirius</i> were
  at once sent away to the <i>Scarboro</i> to bring back the ringleaders. When
  we got on board we were drawn up on either side of the main hatchway, and then
  the surgeon, Mr. Fairfax, and Mr. Marshall went down the ladder to the &rsquo;tween
  decks and spoke through the barricade to the prisoners, who had all gathered
  together behind the heavy wooden grating, peering anxiously through the bars
  and wondering what was to happen to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my lads,&rdquo; said the surgeon, &ldquo;we know all about it,
  and know the ringleaders. We want those men. As for the rest of you, your treatment
  depends upon your future conduct. Stand back from the grating all of you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>They all fell back several paces. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, men,&rdquo;  continued the surgeon, &ldquo;we have plenty of Marines
  here ready to fire into you if you attempt any tricks, so remain where you
  are except numbers four hundred and seventeen and two hundred and nineteen.
  Philip Farrell and Thomas Griffith, advance to the grating.&rdquo; </p>
<p>They stepped out. The Marine sentry, at a sign from the surgeon, unlocked
  the gate, the surgeon beckoned them to come out, and the instant they did so
  the gate was locked again. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page070.jpg" width="612" height="750"></p>
<p>&ldquo;You men will hear no more of this if you mind your bearings,&rdquo; said
  the doctor, as he turned to ascend the ladder. &ldquo;As for these two fellows,
  I don&rsquo;t think they will try any more games of this kind.&rdquo; </p>
<p>We brought numbers four hundred and seventeen and two hundred and nineteen
  to the <i>Sirius</i>, and they had to face the Commodore who, to my mind, gave
  them a very mild reproof considering the serious nature of their offence, cautioned
  them about their future behaviour, and promised to hang them at the yard-arm
  if he heard more of them. Then he ordered them to receive six dozen lashes
  each, and accordingly they were seized to a grating and flogged by two of our
  drummers, and afterwards placed on board the Prince of Wales. The spectacle
  was a very dreadful one, and I shall never forget the feeling of horror that
  I experienced in witnessing their punishment. There were no signs of mutiny
  after this from the day of sailing to the time we cast anchor in Botany Bay,
  and the demeanour of all was, on the whole, humble and regular, save on one
  occasion, of which I shall speak later on. </p>
<p>By this time I was acting as a ward-room servant, in addition to my duties
  in attending upon my lieutenant. In this situation I heard, while waiting upon
  the officers, many things that otherwise would never have come to my ears.
  My comrades were all very ignorant rustics recruited from Hampshire and Sussex,
  and of the Marine privates on the <i>Sirius</i>, I was the only one who could
  read and write, and perhaps, for that reason was made more of by my superiors.
  All the officers on the ship were keeping some kind of a journal of the expedition,
  it being such an extraordinary undertaking that none on board the <i>Sirius</i> had
  ever embarked in the like before. My comrades being such poor and unsuitable
  companions even for a man of my humble attainments, the example of my superiors,
  and the many things I heard at the officers&rsquo; mess, gave me the idea that
  I might take advantage of my learning and likewise keep a diary, and so this
  record of my life was at this time begun. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I was no lover of grog, and so I used to change my allowance
  with the sergeant for all the spare paper he had, and my lieutenant furnished
  me with quills and ink, so that, I was soon set up with all that was necessary.
  This incident of changing my grog allowance reminds me that, strange to relate,
  the poor prisoners suffered more from the want of strong drink and tobacco
  than from any other hardships, for I heard Surgeon White tell the Commodore
  that they pleaded very piteously for these things. </p>
<p>The fleet arrived at Teneriffe on the third of June, and great joy did it
  give the Marines and ships&rsquo; companies, for everyone was allowed a pint
  of wine a day and fresh provisions all the time we lay in the port of Santa
  Cruz. The convicts, too, were well treated, for the Commodore ordered each
  of them to be given a pound of beef and a like quantity of soft bread. </p>
<p>During our stay at Santa Cruz, more than one incident happened, the which
  I set down with great care in my diary. The first matter I overheard was that
  the officers were not a little troubled over us Marines having been sent away
  with a very scant supply of musket balls, and there were no armourers&rsquo; tools
  in the whole fleet. This was kept as secret as possible, but the guards in
  the different ships got to hear of it, and it made them mighty careful to be
  on the alert to check any attempt at mutiny. Both Captain Phillip and Captain
  Hunter were greatly vexed at this neglect of the Government, and I heard the
  latter gentleman say that he had written a very plain letter to the Government,
  which he was then waiting a chance to forward. </p>
<p>Our ships had hemp cables in those days, and we had to keep them as straight
  up and down as possible by means of buoys, to prevent them being chafed by
  the shingle ballast thrown overboard by the Spanish merchantmen. This had accumulated
  in heaps in the anchorage, and the wisdom of Captain Phillip&rsquo;s order
  concerning this was shown by one of the transports neglecting it and nearly
  getting adrift, through the strands of her cable getting chafed through. </p>
<p>The <i>Sirius</i> was so cumbered up with stores on the gun deck that we were
  unable to salute the Spanish governor of the island &mdash; the Marquis of
  Branc&eacute;forte. We were at peace with Spain then, and so our Commodore
  had to apologise very handsomely for this apparent discourtesy. </p>
<p>I had never seen foreigners at home before, and I am bound to say they treated
  us with great consideration, and I left Teneriffe with a much better opinion
  of the black-whiskered Dons than when I entered it. </p>
<p>But the most notable event that occurred while we were here was this, &mdash; At
  daybreak one morning, when I was on sentry at the gangway, a boat from the <i>Alexander</i> came
  alongside, and an officer asked to be shown down to the Commodore. In a few
  minutes we learned that a prisoner named Joseph Powell had got away about midnight
  from the <i>Alexander</i>, and had not been recaptured. </p>
<p>Just then my relief appeared, and I was going below when I was ordered to
  keep under arms and form one of a search party after Powell. Boats were lowered,
  and a regular search of the shores of the harbour began, two boats from the <i>Supply</i> lending
  us a hand. It appeared that a boat had been left hanging astern of the <i>Alexander</i>,
  and Powell by some means had managed to get into her and cut her adrift without
  being discovered; in fact, it was not until four in the morning, when the guard
  was relieved, that he was missed. Just astern of the <i>Alexander</i>, a Dutch
  Indiaman was lying, and Powell worked the boat over to her and offered himself
  on board of her, but they would have none of him. He got into the boat again,
  and was supposed to have gone over to the west side of Santa Cruz. </p>
<p>With us in the boat was the master of the <i>Alexander</i>, who was in a great
  state of mind over the affair, for he was under a penalty of forty pounds for
  every man that escaped. We could not but laugh at him for the way in which
  he urged the rowers to their work, and his constant lamentations about his
  ill-luck. However, his troubles soon came to an ending, for, as we rowed along
  the west side of the harbour, the lieutenant of the guard on the <i>Alexander</i>,
  who was in our boat, suddenly called upon the men to stop, and we all turned
  our eyes to the land. </p>
<p>There, at the foot of a great rock which it appeared he had been trying for
  many hours to climb, lay the poor, hunted wretch, too exhausted to move, or
  even to speak. Quick as lightning the officer grasped my musket. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot, sir,&rdquo; I could not help saying.</p>
<p>He took no notice of me, but levelling the piece, called out to the fugitive, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Surrender, you Powell, or I&rsquo;ll fire.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Poor creature! He did not utter a word, but merely turned his white, ghastly
  face, streaked here and there with blood, towards us, and the lieutenant, still
  keeping his musket at the present, the boat was rowed close in to the rock. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of you get out and bring him into the boat,&rdquo; ordered the
  officer, and myself and a comrade got out, and lifting him up carried him into
  the boat. I shall never forget the look of utter despair in that man&rsquo;s
  face; it seemed to come from his very soul.</p>
<p>We took him on board the <i>Sirius</i>, where, on the following day, he was
  given twelve dozen and sent, back to his ship, and kept in irons till we put
  to sea again. </p>
<p>While we were at Teneriffe, one of the convicts, who was a coiner, tried to
  practise his villainy, but met with swift retribution. It came about by reason
  of our seamen, who had taken very kindly to the fruit of the country, but had
  not the wherewithal to buy it, getting this dangerous rogue all the pewter
  spoons and other metal they could lay their hands upon. With this material
  the fellow made some exceedingly good imitations of the silver dollars of the
  island, and the sailors set about to pass them off on the island vendors, paying
  the coiner for his evil work with tobacco. But the very first attempt to pass
  the money failed, and the sailors, to save themselves, confessed the whole
  plot. Their grog was stopped by way of punishment, and the rogue was soundly
  flogged, suffering a double punishment, for he was cursed as well most heartily
  by the sailors and the prisoners for depriving them of their spoons to so little
  profit. </p>
<p>We only stayed a week at the island, and then the ships weighed and once more
  we were under full sail for our next port of call, which was to be Rio de Janeiro
  in the Brazils; and, until we reached there, nothing of moment occurred, save
  that the <i>Supply</i> gave much trouble by the fearful manner in which she
  rolled and shipped great quantities of water. She could not carry much sail,
  even in moderate weather, for she nearly buried herself when on a wind.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">I Hear Tidings Of Mary Broad And Will Bryant,
  And We Arrive At The Cape Of Good Hope </p>
<p>All this time the fate of Mary Broad and Will Bryant was much in my mind,
  for, although when I had written to my father I had asked for news of the unhappy
  girl who had thrown herself away on such a worthless person as Will Bryant,
  he had in no wise answered my questions. But though I call Will a worthless
  man &mdash; as, indeed, he was when weighed against the girl &mdash; yet, as
  a man, he had many good qualities in his character, as will be shown. </p>
<p>As I have said, the last I had heard of the two was that Squire Fairfax was
  endeavouring to secure a reprieve for Will Bryant, and that Mary had petitioned
  to be sent to Botany Bay, and Lieutenant Fairfax had told me that it was likely
  her petition would be granted. I made many inquiries among the Marines doing
  duty in the transports as to whether a man named Bryant and a woman named Broad
  were among the prisoners they were guarding, but the convicts being all known
  by numbers and not by their names, no one could give me any clue to my unhappy
  acquaintances. In the case of Bryant this caused me no wonder, but I thought
  that Mary&rsquo;s great beauty, were she on board, would easily make her distinguished
  from her companions, and so at last felt pretty sure that she was not with
  the fleet. I did not like to ask Lieutenant Fairfax anything of the matter,
  for in those days discipline was very severe, and for a private to venture
  upon familiarities with his officer would have been most improper.</p>
<p>But one day, after we had left Teneriffe, the lieutenant himself broached
  the subject. I was cleaning his accoutrements, when he came up to me and said
  quite suddenly, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dew, did you ever hear what became of Bryant and that poor girl, my
  sister&rsquo;s maid?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I should be very pleased to know
  for certain that the girl was left in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say that she is, without doubt, on board one of the transports.
  I had an opportunity the other day to speak to the Commodore on this matter,
  and he, kindly turning up his papers, found that William Bryant and Mary Broad
  are both on the list of prisoners.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;God help them both, then, sir,&rdquo; said I, and there flashed through
  my mind the awful faces and vile and blasphemous talk so common among the female
  convicts in the transports. </p>
<p>Then the lieutenant said, &ldquo;I had hope, Dew, when that fellow Powell
  got away at Teneriffe that it was Bryant, and, hang me! I should have been
  glad if it had been Bryant and he had got away. &rsquo;Tis a sad pity such
  a fine fellow should have met with such a fate.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse for the misguided woman who has thrown herself away on him, sir,&rdquo; replied
  I. </p>
<p>The lieutenant fixed his keen, grey eyes on me for a second or two and then
  said quickly,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is true. By the way, Dew, I think you were a little sweet
  in that quarter, eh?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;That was long ago, sir, before I became a man and a soldier, and she
  would have none of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw my dear master smile as he turned away his face, but the next instant
  his eyes met mine. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dew, we must try to help better their condition when we get to
  Botany Bay. Only duty first, you know, Dew. We must not let private feelings
  interfere with duty, my lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I am proud to say so, that
  you, sir, have made a good soldier for the King out of William Dew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Dew. I am glad to hear you say this. Keep on as
  you are going. That will do, my lad.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It pleased me very much that the lieutenant should talk so much to me, and
  that he took such an interest in my welfare. But yet it was a blow to me to
  hear that Mary was on one of the transports after all, with such depraved and
  wicked companions. I had hoped to the last that the authorities would not transport
  her, despite her petition. </p>
<p>We arrived at Rio de Janeiro on August the fifth, and once more the people
  of the expedition were put upon fresh provisions, which was a great boon to
  us all. We had been at sea since May the twelfth, and during that time fifteen
  prisoners and one of a Marine&rsquo;s children had died. I heard Captain Phillip
  one day tell Mr. Morton, the master of the <i>Sirius</i> (for he was most condescending
  to all his officers), that considering the dreadful condition of the foul and
  overcrowded transports, and the warm weather we had met with, that it was only
  by God&rsquo;s mercy that half of our human cargo had not perished miserably.
  During the passage, a great deal of rain fell, which would have caused &nbsp;more
  sickness, but that the surgeons frequently exploded small charges of gunpowder
  on the &rsquo;tween decks of the transports; and by this means, and a constant
  use of oil of tar, the dark, ill-ventilated prisons were kept in as good a
  state as was possible under such bad conditions. </p>
<p>Well, and now to Rio. Our Commodore had once served with the Portuguese, and,
  on the arrival of the fleet, the town was illuminated in his honour and great
  kindness was shown to all our people, and besides this, our ships were excused
  from paying all dues to the port. </p>
<p>The Commodore here made purchase of all sorts of seeds and vegetables for
  use in the settlement, and also acceded to an urgent request of our major for
  a supply of musket balls, the which, I can assure you, made our minds much
  easier. Almost one of the first things that our good Commodore attended to
  when we arrived was to convey ashore and see well cared for, the master of
  the <i>Sirius</i>, Mr. Micah Morton, who had injured himself while we were
  unmooring ship at Teneriffe, and two midshipmen who had been ailing all the
  voyage. He was, in all that concerned the welfare of his people, a most kind
  and tender-hearted gentleman. </p>
<p>During our stay at Rio de Janeiro, the <i>Supply</i>, which had been sailing
  badly, was altered in her rig; and then, embarking our stores, we took our
  departure for the Cape of Good Hope on September the twenty-first. The voyage
  across was a very rough one, and the <i>Sirius</i> rolled terribly, and our
  anxieties were increased by the carpenter discovering that the ship&rsquo;s
  waterways were in a rotten condition, and, indeed, so badly had she been fitted
  out by the rascally navy-yard contractors, that it is a wonder she did not
  roll her decks out, guns and all. </p>
<p>Between Rio and the Cape there was a plot formed on board the <i>Alexander</i> to
  seize the ship, but, providentially, it was discovered in time in a very simple
  manner. Some boxes of candles were found to have been broached, and one of
  the officers secreted himself in the hold, thinking to surprise the thieves
  on the next visit. He was hidden near the forward bulkhead, close to the crew&rsquo;s
  quarters, and, as he lay watching, he heard the men discussing a plot they
  had formed with the prisoners to seize the ship. Indeed, the villains had already
  stolen and concealed a number of crowbars, which were to be served out to the
  prisoners when the proper moment came to overpower the guard. </p>
<p>As soon as this was reported to the master of the <i>Alexander</i>, he signalled
  to the <i>Sirius</i> and, being to windward of us, ran down under our stern
  and hove-to while Captain Phillip dealt with the matter. This he went about
  very quickly. The ringleaders of the plot were seized and ironed to ringbolts
  on the deck, and four of the seamen were brought on board the <i>Sirius</i>,
  and their places taken by four of our men. </p>
<p>On the seventh of October, the master of the <i>Lady Penrhyn</i> signalled
  to the Commodore that a convict woman on board his ship had given birth to
  a son, and on the thirteenth day of the same month we arrived in Table Bay
  at the Cape of Good Hope. Here we obtained fresh provisions, and took on board
  the transports a great number of animals for breeding purposes at the new settlement.
  All these lumbered the ships up very much, and the seamen got to calling their
  vessels Noah&rsquo;s Arks. The day after we anchored, Mynheer von Graffe, the
  Dutch governor at the Cape, a fine soldierly-looking man, came on board the <i>Sirius</i>,
  and was pleased to say that we Marines were a fine body of men. </p>
<p>All being in readiness for our departure, the Commodore now determined to
  haul down his flag on the <i>Sirius</i> and go on ahead of us in the <i>Supply</i>,
  taking with him, among other officers, our commander, Major Ross. The brig
  was the fastest sailer in the fleet, and Captain Phillip thought to get on
  ahead of us, so that he might put the settlement in some sort of order before
  the main part of the expedition arrived. The <i>Alexander</i>, <i>Scarboro</i>,
  and <i>Friendship</i> were ordered to try and keep up with the <i>Supply</i>,
  and a number of carpenters, surveyors, and blacksmiths were selected from the
  convicts, and placed upon those ships. And now I come to what was the most
  affecting incident of this memorable voyage, and that was the meeting between
  Lieutenant Fairfax and Mary Broad. </p>
<p>As I have said, three of the transports were ordered to sail under convoy
  of the <i>Supply</i>, and this left the <i>Sirius</i> with the <i>Charlotte</i>, <i>Lady
  Penrhyn</i>, <i>Prince of Wales</i>, and the three store-ships, the <i>Fishburn</i>,
  <i>Golden Grove</i>, and <i>Borrodale</i>. These changes made it necessary to put
  some extra prisoners on the <i>Lady Penrhyn</i>, the complement of this transport
  being made up chiefly of females, but there were also a small number of men.
  On the day that this change was made, Mr. Fairfax was on board of the <i>Lady
  Penrhyn</i>, taking over some papers from her Marine officer who was going
  on with the Commodore&rsquo;s squadron. Mr. Arthur Bowes was the surgeon on
  this ship. </p>
<p>I was not present at what took place on this day, but Mr. Fairfax described
  the scene to me, and, as nearly as I can, I will endeavour here to set it down
  as it took place. </p>
<p>The master of the ship, Mr. William Sever, Captain Campbell, and Lieutenants
  Collins and Fairfax and Surgeon Bowes were in the ship&rsquo;s cabin talking
  over matters of duty when the mate knocked at the door and informed them that
  four female convicts and two children had arrived alongside in a boat from
  the <i>Friendship</i>, and that the sergeant of their escort wanted to see
  Mr. Bowes. </p>
<p>The surgeon went up on deck, and returning presently said to the officers
  who were chatting in the cabin, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some more ladies given into my care. I shall begin to think
  that the Commodore has a high opinion of my virtue if he sends me many more
  of them.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  says Mr. Fairfax, not knowing that Mary Broad was among
  the women he was joking about, &ldquo;you need not boast of your virtue. The
  women, if all accounts I hear be true, are neither beautiful nor virtuous,
  so that you are under no great temptation.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on deck and take a look for yourself, Mr. Fairfax, at one of my
  latest additions to the flock, and I think you&rsquo;ll own yourself wrong
  as to their want of beauty.&rdquo; </p>
<p>So thereupon they all trooped up on deck, laughing and joking. They came to
  the break of the poop, and looking down upon the main deck, they saw standing
  together in the ship&rsquo;s waist the women who were waiting to be disposed
  of by the surgeon. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is your swan, Mr. Bowes?&rdquo; said my lieutenant, merrily. </p>
<p>At the sound of his voice, one of the women turned sharp round and looked
  up into his face. Then with a little cry she stepped a pace or two forward,
  and put her hands together as if she would crave a boon. </p>
<p>&ldquo;By George, Fairfax! the girl knows you,&rdquo; said Captain Campbell. &ldquo;I
  saw her jump at the sound of your voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;  said my lieutenant, &ldquo;I know her well, poor girl,
  she was once my sister&rsquo;s maid;&rdquo;  and then, seeing them looking
  at one another in a very knowing manner, he divined what was passing in their
  minds, and added somewhat hotly, &ldquo;Gentlemen, you quite mistake the situation;
  the poor girl is as honest as the day, but &rsquo;tis her love for a notorious
  smuggler named Bryant, belonging to my native place, that has got her into
  this dreadful situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he told them the sad particulars of Mary&rsquo;s history, and, being
  honourable men, they showed great sympathy for the poor girl. Mr. Bowes, the
  surgeon, said he would see to it that her lot on the ship should be as comfortable
  as possible, and he would go and tell her so forthwith. </p>
<p>In another moment he was talking to the poor girl, and presently he beckoned
  to my lieutenant to come and join them. </p>
<p>As he came up to the group, the other women and Mr. Bowes drew back so as
  not to overhear their talk. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, my girl, how have you fared?&rdquo; said Mr. Fairfax, and I well
  know how his kind tones must have wrought upon her woman&rsquo;s heart. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir, thank you. I have nothing to complain of,&rdquo; said
  the girl, but yet her dark eyes glowed, and she clasped her hands, tightly
  together, and her mouth worked. She was dressed in a very humble fashion, in
  some common woollen gown, with a shawl, such as all the prisoners wore, thrown
  over her black, wavy hair. But, despite the poverty of her attire and the dreadfulness
  of her surroundings, said my lieutenant, her great beauty shone out like as
  would a bright star in a sky of darkness, and there was the same fire in her
  eyes as in the old days when she set my heart a-throbbing on Solcombe Cliffs;
  indeed, all the suffering she had gone through in mind and body had not changed
  her ever so little.</p>
<p>For a moment or two she did not speak but gazed downwards to the deck, and
  then her voice came to her, as, with a sudden gush of passion, she laid her
  hand upon his arm. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles Fairfax, you made love to me once, told me that I was fitted
  to be a lady and offered to disgrace yourself and break your good father&rsquo;s
  heart by marrying me when you found I was no simple country wench to play with
  and then cast aside. Was there enough truth in your words to help me now? God
  knows how much you can help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo;  he began, when she placed both hands upon his arm, and,
  tossing her shawl back from her head, looked into his face with a very great
  expression of pleading misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Fairfax, forgive me. I am only, after all, a poor, weak woman,
  and I have done wrong to bring back to your memory words that I have forgotten
  long ago; but, sir, I beseech you, as an honourable gentleman and a King&rsquo;s
  officer, to do what I ask. You are the first man I have ever asked a favour
  of. Grant it me, and, perhaps, some day God may give me the power to show you
  my gratitude. Grant it, sir; Charles, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t
  refuse me, or I shall go mad with suspense,&rdquo; and then, although she did
  not weep, she shook and quivered from head to foot, and but that she held his
  arm would have fallen to the deck. </p>
<p>This laid the lieutenant all aback, and he hesitated a moment. Then said he, &ldquo;Mary,
  I was infatuated then, and your beauty made me make a fool of myself, as you
  say. Besides, you would have none of me. Bryant was, and is, the man you love.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;True, indeed,&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;I do love him in a way that
  you fine folk know nothing of. But only my good sense saved you from linking
  yourself to me, and at least you owe me gratitude for that,&rdquo; and with
  that she drew back from him with a proud look. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you want, Mary. I have sufficient regard to do anything
  for you consistent with my duty, but you know that it was your own wish to
  come with this &mdash; &rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, heavens,&rdquo; and a swift gleam of fire came into her eyes, and
  her voice grew marvellously hard, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t preach to me; Do you think
  that I want to go back with what I have begun? All I ask of you is that you
  will speak to that fool of a surgeon, or the head gaoler, or whoever is your
  master, and get me sent into the same ship as my Will is on.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What good can that do, Mary, we leave here in a day or two, and then
  shall see no land until we reach the settlement, so that if you hope to escape &mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Escape! I have no such thoughts, but cannot you see that I, who have
  gone through so much that I might some day speak to Will again, am eating out
  my heart in waiting for that time, and that even to be on the same ship with
  him would help me to bear the rest with patience, even though we might not
  speak together,&rdquo;  and again her voice grew tender, and ended in a sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I will try to do what I can, but I don&rsquo;t even know
  what ship Bryant is in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I, but, oh, Mr. Fairfax, for the sake of those days gone
  never to return, try all you can to do this for me;&rdquo; and then, said my
  lieutenant, one, but only one, tear fell upon his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Mary, I will do my best;&rdquo; and then he said with a laugh
  so as to cheer her up, &ldquo;good-bye, Mary, I suppose you know the name of
  the place where we now are, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; </p>
<p>She smiled back at him. &ldquo;God bless you, Mr. Fairfax. I have good hope,
  indeed, now.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then the lieutenant turned away, and the surgeon spoke to the girl and told
  her to behave herself and he would do what he could for her. </p>
<p>Mary replied in a very humble way, and then, with her fellow-prisoners, went
  below. </p>
<p>The lieutenant told all that had taken place to the others, and then for the
  first time learned that Will Bryant was on board of the <i>Charlotte</i>; the
  strange part of the matter was that he had actually been transferred to that
  ship from the <i>Lady Penrhyn</i> the previous day, to take the place of a
  carpenter who was going on with the Commodore. As so many women were on the <i>Lady
  Penrhyn</i>, it had been determined to take the few men out of her and thus
  reduce the chances of a mutiny and the need for so strong a guard, some of
  the Marines being put on board the <i>Charlotte</i>, where there was a great
  number of male prisoners. </p>
<p>After some further talk in the matter, Mr. Bowes and the others said they
  would not object to Bryant being returned to the ship if Mr. Fairfax would
  mention it to the Commodore, and obtain his consent, and to that end my lieutenant
  sought to put himself in the way of Captain Phillip before the <i>Supply</i> sailed.</p>
<h2><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">A Marriage Scheme Is Arranged Which Does Not Altogether
  Meet With My Approval, And We Arrive At Our Destination </p>
<p>It so happened, on the very day of the meeting between Mary Broad and my lieutenant,
  that Captain Phillip dined in the ward-room with all the officers who were
  not actually on duty, for we were to sail the next day, and it was always his
  kindly nature to associate as much as possible with those under him and join
  in their conversation, and this he did without in any way sacrificing his great
  dignity and courtesy of manner. </p>
<p>After dinner, he explained over some wine what were his intentions immediately
  after the expedition landed in Botany Bay, where he expected to arrive some
  time in advance of the rest of the fleet, as, although the whole of the ships
  were to get under weigh together on the morrow, Captain Phillip thought that
  the <i>Supply</i> and the three transports with her would far outsail the rest
  of the fleet. Mr. Fairfax was not present, being then at the time on the <i>Lady
  Penrhyn</i>. </p>
<p>I was in attendance at the table, and my heart jumped to my throat when I
  heard the Commodore utter these words, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the first things to be attended to after the landing will be
  the pairing of some of these unfortunate females with suitable male prisoners.
  Heaven knows, gentlemen, we need to encourage morality among them, and I propose
  to marry as many couples as possible. There are not enough single women or
  widows to go round with the number of single men, but I daresay we shall be
  able to procure native women who will be willing to mate with the male prisoners
  we cannot provide with European wives.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The only chaplain we had with us was Mr. Johnson, and he was a Methodist,
  and I felt sure it was he who had put this matter into the Commodore&rsquo;s
  head. </p>
<p>Said Captain Hunter, &ldquo;And how do you propose to sort out all these precious
  couples, sir?&rdquo; </p>
<p>When the Commodore first put his idea before his officers, it did not give
  me a great shock, for, thought I, this will come in well for poor Mary, who
  has come so far for the sake of the man she loves, but the next words of Captain
  Phillip, in answer to Captain Hunter&rsquo;s question, quite took me aback. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the fairest way will be for them to draw lots,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A devilish good idea,&rdquo; said my officer, Major Ross, and I could
  have struck him for saying it, although he was my superior, and a good officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better let me pick them out according to their physical fitness,&rdquo; suggested
  Dr. White, the chief surgeon to the expedition. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a good idea, doctor,&rdquo; said Captain Phillip, gravely bowing
  to him and raising his glass. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think, sir, that it would be well to leave this matter as
  much as possible to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Johnson. &ldquo;If it be necessary,
  sir, to pair off these lost creatures like cattle, pray let me, who will have
  to perform the holy ceremony of marriage, endeavour to find out the spiritual
  condition of some of them, and by a judicious selection make good citizens
  of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officers tittered and one or two laughed outright, for none of them loved
  the parson, but the Commodore&rsquo;s voice made them cease. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The chaplain is right, gentlemen. I shall form a committee of selection,
  to consist of Mr. Johnson, the doctor, and myself. By this means we may, out
  of very bad material, breed some very good subjects for His Majesty.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then there was more talk of what was to be done, and we who were waiting at
  the table were told that we might leave the ward-room, and so I heard no more,
  but I determined that Mr. Fairfax should be told what had taken place directly
  he came on board, in the hope that this off-hand marriage scheme might be so
  arranged as to benefit rather than injure the unhappy pair in whom we were
  both so painfully interested. </p>
<p>Accordingly, when the lieutenant returned, I took the first opportunity of
  telling him all about the matter, though I was by no means sure how he would
  take such a liberty on my part. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dew,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is very singular. I must see
  the Commodore at once, whatever comes of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that he told me of what had taken place on board the transport,
  without, of course, entering into all those particulars I have given in my
  diary &mdash; it was long years afterwards that I learned all the circumstances
  of the interview. The lieutenant at this time merely informed me that he had
  seen Mary Broad, and that she was still infatuated with Will Bryant, and was
  anxious to make the rest of the voyage in the same ship as he was. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Which,&rdquo;  said Mr. Fairfax, &ldquo;I have promised to ask the
  Commodore to consent to.&rdquo; The lieutenant did not ask me for my opinion,
  and so I dared not say anything, but I must say that I could see that no good
  could come out of such a matter, but I held my peace, and my betters decided
  the thing wisely enough without me.</p>
<p>So Mr. Fairfax got leave to go off to the <i>Supply</i> that afternoon, and,
  having the consent of Major Ross to interview the Commodore on this matter,
  and Captain Phillip being willing to see him, he was shown into the little
  cabin of the <i>Supply</i> and told his story and what he wanted in as few
  words as possible. Long afterwards, I was told all that took place, but on
  the lieutenant&rsquo;s return he sent for me and said, &ldquo;Dew, my lad,
  the Commodore has refused to put these two on one ship, but has promised that
  they shall be among the first couples married as soon as we arrive. That will
  do, let us hear no more of the matter.&rdquo; </p>
<p>With this I had to be content, but I afterwards heard what took place. Said
  the Commodore,  &ldquo;This is quite a romance you tell me, lieutenant, but,
  from what you yourself say, Bryant and this woman are scarcely the persons
  to put on board the same ship. Either one of them has spirit enough to attempt
  an escape, and this woman, by your own showing, is a prison breaker. No, I
  cannot have that.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;As it pleases you, sir,&rdquo; answered the lieutenant, &ldquo;but
  may I entreat you to interest yourself in these unfortunate persons&rsquo; future?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, pray understand I interest myself and feel deeply for every one
  of these people, and I cannot undertake to separate any one or any two of them
  from their fellows in such poor endeavours as I am capable of towards effecting
  their reform.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite understand that, sir,&rdquo; answered my lieutenant, who was
  a little ruffled at what he thought was an unnecessary reminder that his personal
  feelings must be smothered where duty was concerned, &ldquo;but I understood
  you had some idea of arranging for the marriage of some of these people, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite true, Mr. Fairfax, and this suggestion of yours shall receive
  every consideration, &rsquo;tis reasonable enough&rdquo;&mdash;and here the
  gallant gentleman placed his hand on the lieutenant&rsquo;s shoulder with a
  kindly smile&mdash;&ldquo;that this man and woman should be married to each
  other, if the circumstances of the case are as you understand them. In fact,
  I will promise you that, if the chaplain and the doctor find no fault with
  the arrangement, this Bryant and the young woman Broad shall be the first couple
  I will have spliced when the pairing off begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My lieutenant thanked the Commodore, and returned to the <i>Sirius</i>, and
  the next day, which was the thirteenth of November, the whole fleet got under
  weigh again, and on the twenty-third we had cleared the land, and the <i>Supply</i> and
  her convoy had parted company. </p>
<p>The routine was now the same as before, except that we had a great deal of
  bad weather and sighted many large whales. In the bad weather, the <i>Prince
  of Wales</i> lost a man from the main-yard when snugging down one night, and
  no little damage was done to the sails of the convoy. </p>
<p>On January the second, we saw for the first time the long-looked-for land.
  This was the South Cape, which years afterwards was found to be an island and
  was named Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land. </p>
<p>From this point we shaped our course for Botany Bay, and again made the land
  on January the nineteenth, seventeen hundred and eighty-eight, and standing
  off and on during the night for the convoy to come up, we entered the bay on
  the following day, and found the rest of the fleet waiting us. </p>
<h2><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Botany Bay</p>
<p>To-day I have reached the allotted age of man&rsquo;s life, and I know that
  presently, when I enter the best parlour, I shall be welcomed by many dear
  faces ready with kindly greetings and affectionate tokens, to remind me that
  my seventieth birthday is not forgotten by the loving hearts about me. </p>
<p>How different it all is in this year of our Lord 1834 to that time forty-six
  years ago, when our storm-beaten and battered ships, with their cargoes of
  sin-stained and suffering humanity, dropped anchor off the wild shores of Botany
  Bay. </p>
<p>Since then that settlement, the first seeds of which were sown amid the sighs
  and groans and tears of the wicked and worthless, and the swish of the dreadful
  cat and the clank of iron gyves upon weary limbs, has become a free and flourishing
  colony, and the memories of the sad past are well-nigh forgotten. And indeed,
  though I did see much that sickened me of the swift and stern punishment that
  was the fate of these evil-doers who sought to renew their crimes in a new
  land, and though some of those in authority were cruel and heartless, yet do
  I honestly believe that most of those who were then my superiors were good
  and conscientious men, who sought to do their duty to their country and their
  King. And I shall ever take pride, my dear children, in the thought that it
  was my honoured lot to serve under such men as Captain Arthur Phillip and Captain
  Hunter and Lieutenant King; for not only were these gentlemen good officers,
  but they were better&mdash;they were good and clean-living men amid all that
  was wicked and vile.</p>
<p>Since those days, Captain Hunter, Colonel Collins, and Captain Tench and Mr.
  White, our old surgeon, have written full accounts of all our early sufferings
  and misfortunes and the ups and downs of the brave hearts who, in spite of
  endless adversities of famine and shipwreck, made good their footing upon those
  distant and then savage shores. </p>
<p>But there, this journal of mine is no place to record those moving adventures
  and strange events, and I make no pretensions to write a history of the settlement,
  for in truth I really took but very little part in the colony&rsquo;s history
  after our arrival, being one of a party of Marines told off to remain on board
  the <i>Sirius</i> to act as a small reserve. Thus it is that much that I have
  here set down I learned from my comrades, who were doing duty on shore.</p>
<p class="note">[The reader is referred to the Introduction by the Editors. As
  a matter of fact, much of Sergeant Dew&rsquo;s journal has been here omitted,
  as the matter can be read in any history of New South Wales.] </p>
<p>It was on Sunday, January the twentieth, that we sailed into the bay, and
  then we learned that the <i>Supply</i> had arrived on the previous Friday night,
  while the transports had only got inside the previous evening, so that the
  brig had not so greatly outsailed us after all. </p>
<p>Lieutenant King, the second lieutenant of the <i>Sirius</i>, Lieutenant Dawes
  of our detachment, and the Commodore, who had gone on in the <i>Supply</i>,
  had landed directly the brig was at anchor, and begun exploring the shores
  of the bay for a suitable site for the settlement. The land disappointed them,
  for it was very much like an English moor, and dull and unpleasing to the eye
  for the most part. They saw some natives, quite naked, but these were peacefully
  inclined, and though rather timid at first soon began to make friends with
  our people. But although so timorous of our people, they yet fought very fiercely
  among themselves; for soon after our landing at Port Jackson, the Governor
  was a witness to a battle fought among themselves, which shows they are not
  lacking in courage. Captain Phillip was exploring the northern side of the
  harbour, near the entrance, when he saw this encounter, and the brave way the
  natives fought so impressed the Governor that he named the little bay in which
  this matter happened, Manly Cove. </p>
<p>A further examination of the shores of Botany Bay made the Commodore so dissatisfied
  with the place that he resolved to make a boat expedition to the northward,
  and examine Broken Bay and Port Jackson &mdash; two bays sighted and named
  by Captain Cook. </p>
<p>On the twenty-first, the <i>Sirius</i> and her convoy having got safely to
  their anchors, the Commodore, with Captain Hunter, the judge-advocate (Mr.
  Collins), and the masters of the <i>Sirius</i> and <i>Supply</i> set off in
  three boats to examine the coast north, while Mr. King and Mr. Dawes had orders
  to search the shores of the bay for good fresh water, the want of which was
  the Commodore&rsquo;s chief objection to forming the settlement at this place.
  Meanwhile, however, a party of the prisoners were set to work clearing an open
  space of ground, so that, should the Commodore decide to remain, a beginning
  would have been made. </p>
<p>We on board the <i>Sirius</i> were not allowed to lose time waiting, for our
  people were employed getting up cases of saws and such like implements, in
  making seine poles and getting fishing gear ready. A saw-pit was made on shore
  by a party of the prisoners, but before it was finished the order came to knock
  off and bring the gear on board. </p>
<p>On the twenty-third the Commodore returned, and we soon learned that Port
  Jackson, about nine miles to the northward, had been fixed upon for the settlement.
  On the twenty-fifth the <i>Supply</i> weighed, having on board a party of our
  men and some fifty convicts. She got in the same night, and the next morning
  at daybreak the Jack was hoisted on shore and the land taken possession of
  for His Majesty, our men firing a volley, and the officers drinking the health
  of the King. </p>
<p>Before sunset the same night the transports and the <i>Sirius</i> had also
  anchored in the harbour, and I saw for the first time the place of the new
  settlement. The site was at the head of a cove on the larboard arm of the bay,
  which is full of inlets and is a fine, safe harbour. Just at the head of the
  cove a clear rivulet empties itself, and the soil, though thick with trees
  and rocky near the shores, seemed to us very fair. </p>
<p>On the twenty-seventh the convicts and our men were landed and encamped on
  the west side of the stream of water, and the Governor and the principal officers,
  with a guard, were encamped opposite to them. </p>
<p>I must not forget to mention that, just after the <i>Supply</i> left Botany
  Bay, two French ships which had been cruising about trying to get in, made
  the port. These were <i>La Boussole</i> and <i>L&rsquo;Astrolabo</i>, commanded by Monsieur
  de La Perouse, and bound on a voyage of discovery. </p>
<p>They had been unfortunate in their voyage, as we afterwards heard, having
  had some of their officers massacred by the savages of the islands they had
  visited. </p>
<p>Our Commodore sent some of the officers to visit the Frenchmen, and they went
  round to the bay in our ship&rsquo;s cutter, and I believe took some despatches
  which the foreigners said they would deliver when they got back to Europe,
  and we took some despatches of theirs to send to England by the first ship. </p>
<p>Long afterwards we heard that they never reached home again, and their fate
  to this day has never been discovered, though it is supposed that when they
  left Botany Bay they foundered in a gale. </p>
<p class="note">[The unfortunate La Perouse and all with him were, it has since
  been ascertained, lost on the island of Vanikoro. &mdash; <i>Editors</i>.]</p>
<h2><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">I Take A Small Part In A Very Important Ceremony</p>
<p>I was landed from the <i>Sirius</i> to do duty with the main guard on the
  Governor&rsquo;s side of the Tank Stream in Sydney Cove &mdash; as it was afterwards
  called, in honour of Lord Sydney, though there was some talk at first of calling
  the settlement Albion. </p>
<p>Day and night for a week, when not on sentry duty, I had to remain close to
  the guard tent, for in it were placed the colours of the detachment, which
  Major Ross had had trouble enough, as he said, to get permission to bring with
  us, and which had to be guarded. Besides the pair of colours there were many
  important boxes, containing papers, ammunition, and the like, and the guard
  tent was the rallying point in case of a mutiny, or of an attack by the natives. </p>
<p>In the bustle and excitement of the first week after our landing, I saw nor
  heard nothing of Will and Mary. </p>
<p>Only some of the prisoners had as yet been landed, and these were at work
  on the other side of the cove, felling the great trees and erecting rough huts
  and tents in readiness for the general disembarkation, while no women were
  allowed on shore for the first week. But on my side of the stream the live
  stock and plants and seeds were landed, and stock was taken of our possessions.
  It was then found that we had four mares, two stallions, four cows, one bull,
  one bull calf, and a few sheep, poultry, goats, and hogs, all of which Captain
  Phillip had bought at the Cape.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of Tuesday, February the fifth, five women were landed and
  escorted to our side of the cove, and as I saw them coming towards where I
  was keeping guard, I thought one of these might be Mary Broad. But she was
  not among them, and it afterwards turned out that these women were destined
  for Norfolk Island, whither Lieutenant King was bound in the <i>Supply</i>. </p>
<p>However, on the following day, all the ships&rsquo; boats were got out, and
  by sunset that night, every prisoner in the fleet was landed and encamped.
  When all were on shore a muster roll was called, and it was found that from
  the day we left England until our arrival, the number of deaths of all parties
  in the expedition only numbered forty-eight. </p>
<p>It was a very dreadful night, for before the tents could be properly secured,
  an awful storm came upon us, with such thunder and lightning and rain as I
  had never dreamed of, and man as I thought myself to be, my heart was filled
  with fear. Many of our live stock were killed by the hurricane, and Major Ross
  lost five sheep in which he took great pride, but I confess I was not sorry
  to lose them, for I had been given the charge of them, and they cost me much
  trouble by straying away, and I feared to meet with natives when searching
  for them. </p>
<p>Lieutenant Fairfax I had seen very little of during this first week on shore,
  for the Governor, as we now took to calling our good Commodore, had found him
  a great deal of work surveying the ground, he being much skilled in this science. </p>
<p>There was terrible work that night among the depraved characters who were
  landed, and I shuddered when I heard afterwards, from my comrades doing duty
  on that side of the cove, of the fearful scenes which they had witnessed, when
  I thought that Mary was among the women who, &rsquo;twas said, had led to all
  the riot, although, poor girl, she had naught in common with the vicious wretches
  by whom she was surrounded. </p>
<p>The next morning at ten o&rsquo;clock everybody belonging to the settlement
  was assembled on the banks of the little rivulet, to hear Governor Phillip
  read his commission. </p>
<p>We Marines were all under arms, and only one sentry was left at the guard
  tent. Our colours were unrolled, and our drummers and fifers played good music
  as we fell into line.</p>
<p>The prisoners were all drawn up at a short distance, and then the Governor,
  and all the officials of the settlement, and our regimental officers and the
  ships&rsquo;  officers, assembled in front of us. </p>
<p>A camp table stood handy, and on this were a lot of papers, which Mr. Collins
  read out in a clear voice. These documents were the commissions of the Governor
  and our commandant (who was appointed lieutenant-governor), and Mr. Collins
  himself, who was the judge-advocate, the parson, and the surveyor-general;
  all had their commissions read also, and everyone was much impressed with the
  ceremony.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page107.jpg" width="645" height="750"> </p>
<p>The Governor very prettily thanked the detachment for its services, and then
  he ordered the convicts to sit down, as he wanted them to pay attention to
  what he had to say. </p>
<p>Then it was that among the crowd of abandoned felons I saw, for the first
  time since I had left England, Will Bryant and Mary Broad. They were seated
  together holding each other&rsquo;s hands, and seemingly quite indifferent
  to all that was going on about them; and I saw that every now and then the
  girl would let her eyes dwell lovingly upon the face of the man for whom she
  had dared so much. </p>
<p>I learnt afterwards that this was the first time they had met since leaving
  England. The male prisoners had been marched onto this parade ground from our
  direction, and the females from another, and then, for the first time, many
  of the men and women recognised among their fellow-exiles some old acquaintances. </p>
<p>Mary and Will were, strange though it seemed, but little changed from when
  I saw them last, and the girl looked pleased and happy, as if forsooth &rsquo;twas
  something to be proud of to be in such a situation. </p>
<p>They did not see me; the girl was too much wrapped up in her lover to have
  eyes for any but him, and as for Will, he held down his head, and I thought
  looked as if he felt awkward and ashamed at being so taken possession of by
  a woman. </p>
<p>Presently, the convicts all being seated on the ground, Captain Phillip, in
  a clear voice that could be heard by every soul present, addressed them, as
  nearly as I could remember when I wrote the speech in my journal, in these
  words. Said he: &mdash;  &ldquo;Prisoners, I have given you a very fair trial
  during the passage out, and I have had some of you working under my own eye
  for the last week, and I am sorry to say that I think many of you are incorrigible
  and case-hardened rogues, that nothing but severity will induce to behave properly.
  Make no mistake about it,&rdquo;  and here his voice grew terribly hard and
  stern, &ldquo;if the scenes of last night are attempted to be repeated, the
  guard has orders to fire upon you, to put a stop to your riotous debauchery.
  Therefore, for your own sakes I implore you to take heed. Out of some six hundred
  of you who ought to work, not more than two hundred have shown an inclination
  to do so. Very well, I will take care that the industrious shall not labour
  for the idle &mdash; those who do not work shall not eat. In England, thieving
  poultry is punished with death, and there poultry is plentiful. Here a fowl
  is of the utmost consequence to the settlement, for they are reserved to breed
  as well as every other species of stock; therefore, understand me, whoever
  steals the most trifling article of stock or provisions shall be punished with
  death. It will be grievous to my feelings to exercise severity, but the welfare
  of all demands most rigid execution of the laws.&rdquo; He stopped for a while,
  and then resumed, in a milder tone: &ldquo;The work you will be called upon
  to do will not even equal the labours of the husbandman at home, but every
  one of you must and shall do your share towards making the community prosperous.
  And we shall begin by erecting comfortable dwellings for the officers and men
  of the Marine detachment, and afterwards suitable houses for yourselves.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then the Governor spoke in still kinder tones, and reminded them that the
  greater number had already forfeited their lives to their country by their
  wickedness, but by the leniency of His Majesty&rsquo;s Government they were
  given this chance to redeem their characters, and he would do all he could
  for those who deserved his clemency. </p>
<p>Then he concluded by saying, and you may depend upon it that some of us paid
  strict attention to his words: &mdash; &ldquo;I propose, as a means of settling
  some of you in a comfortable manner, that such among you as appear to wish
  it, and as are suitable, shall be lawfully married, and begin a new life respectably.&rdquo; </p>
<p>After this we fired three volleys, and all the officers had dinner with the
  Governor. The detachment was marched back to the cheering sound of drums and
  fifes to its encampment, and the convicts to their rough huts and tents.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Will Bryant And Mary Broad Are Married<b> </b></p>
<p>The next day or two went by quickly enough. The prisoners were set to work
  at building, and our detachment was occupied in guarding them. </p>
<p>One afternoon Lieutenant Fairfax came to the guard tent where I was on duty. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dew,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;I am afraid you can no longer act as my
  servant. The Governor says we are to have convict servants in future, and that
  the red-coats are wanted for duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have spoken to the Governor,&rdquo; went on the lieutenant, &ldquo;and
  Mary Broad and Bryant are to be married next Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is about time they were, sir,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;May I make
  bold to ask if you saw how the young woman behaved herself last Thursday when
  we were paraded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I saw them, and I saw nothing to find fault with in Mary&rsquo;s
  behaviour. She has shown that she is deeply attached to Bryant, and &rsquo;twas
  natural enough she should be pleased to see him. What fault have you to find
  with her for that?&rdquo;  and he wheeled about and faced me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No fault, sir, if you think her conduct becoming in a modest young
  woman,&rdquo; said I, somewhat timidly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Dew, my lad, I am afraid that you are a deuced sight too
  virtuous and easily shocked in matters of love-making to understand such a
  woman as Mary. I am quite certain that no young woman of your choosing will
  ever get transported on your account.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I saw that the lieutenant did not half like my boldness in having been so
  free with my opinions, so I only saluted by way of reply. </p>
<p>But Mr. Fairfax was only putting me in my proper place, as I, having more
  sense now, well understand, and he was by no means annoyed with me, for he
  went on,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going exploring for some days directly, and I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
  have much opportunity of seeing you. Remember, Dew, do your duty like a soldier
  and a man, as you have been doing, and you will get along all right. I have
  spoken well of you to the officers, and &rsquo;tis likely that they will not
  forget my recommendation. That will do, Dew, for the present. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye to you, sir,&rdquo; said I, and was about to salute again
  when he caught my hand and shook it, saying,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no crime against military law to shake hands with an honest
  comrade, so let us shake hands first and salute afterwards, then all will be
  according to Cocker.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then he slewed on his heel and walked off, leaving me very much affected by
  his good-natured condescension. </p>
<p>On Sunday, February the tenth, the Reverend Richard Johnson held divine service
  under a big tree, the detachment and all the prisoners being paraded to hear
  the service read. </p>
<p>Then after the service Mr. Collins stepped to the front and read from a piece
  of paper a list of men and women who were to be married, and the first two
  names he read out were Mary Broad and William Bryant. When their names were
  read out, Mary and Bryant stepped forward, and Mr. Fairfax, who was standing
  with a group of officers near the Governor, smiled encouragingly at them, and
  the girl&rsquo;s face seemed to me to suddenly grow more beautiful than ever,
  as her eyes lit up with an answering smile, but yet could I see that her whole
  frame was shaking like an aspen leaf. </p>
<p>The Governor said a few words in an undertone to the parson, and then he turned
  to the lieutenant and said something to him, and the lieutenant saluted, and
  I could see he was explaining to the Governor that these two were the prisoners
  on whose behalf he had spoken.</p>
<p>Then Captain Phillip bade Will and Mary approach closer to him, and he spoke
  to them in a kindly way, but not so quietly that we could not hear what he
  said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Bryant,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and you, Mary Broad, I have determined
  shall be the first couple married in the settlement. Lieutenant Fairfax has
  spoken to me about you, and has told me your history. He says I can take his
  word for it that you will turn out good settlers. I hope you will justify the
  interest he takes in you, and that you especially, William Bryant, will remember
  that in the love of this young woman you have a very sheet-anchor to hold you
  to a life of honest endeavour and good conduct. I shall take you to be a very
  poor and paltry fellow, indeed, despite your bodily strength, if you go to
  leeward with such an incentive to a good life as I believe this girl Mary Broad
  will prove. Now, Mr. Chaplain, proceed with the ceremony.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Will Bryant held up his head, saluted the Governor, and spoke up like a man. </p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless your honour. You may rely upon it, sir, that I will do my
  duty, and that Mary here, my wife that is to be, will make me as good a man
  as you have among us prisoners.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It will go hard with you, sir, if she does not make you a better,&rdquo; answered
  Captain Phillip, quickly, but still I saw he was pleased with Bryant&rsquo;s
  words.</p>
<p>And then Mary, not a whit abashed, although her hands shook and her bosom
  heaved as she spoke out so that we could all hear her, said: &ldquo;And I thank
  you, sir, too; and I thank Mr. Fairfax for this good act. But, sir,&rdquo; and
  here her black eyes flashed and sparkled as in the old days, and one hand stole
  out into Will&rsquo;s, &ldquo;but, sir, we are not criminals but as honest
  as any man or woman here, bond or free.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page115.jpg" width="625" height="750"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, girl,&rdquo; said the Governor, somewhat impatiently&mdash; for
  how was he to know that Will and Mary were different from any other law-breakers &mdash; and
  I half-feared he would get angry and knock the ceremony on the head at once;
  but my lieutenant again said something in a low voice to him, and then he smiled,
  and said,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I know no distinctions at present, but plenty of distinctions
  will be made in the future as people by their conduct deserve them. Smugglers,
  thieves, and all the rest of you make a fresh start from to-day. Now, Mr. Chaplain,
  go ahead and splice them. You know there is a long list of names to go through
  yet, and we have no time for speech-making over each couple.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then the parson solemnly read the service, and a ring which was lent by the
  Governor himself for the purpose was used for the ceremony, but the parson
  only put it on the woman&rsquo;s finger and took it off again and made it go
  the rounds, and then returned it to the Governor. </p>
<p>Our commandant, Major Ross, made a little joke of this, about the danger of
  letting such people see gold rings, and the care the parson took not to let
  it out of his hands. </p>
<p>But the Commodore soon put a stop to this. Said he, &ldquo;No, no, major,
  no joking, please. These people have feelings, you know, and it is not necessary
  or seemly to be always reminding them of the past.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And so Mary Broad became Mary Bryant, and as I was marched off from the parade
  ground I felt that I had quite got over any weakness I once had in that quarter.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">The Settlement At Port Jackson </p>
<p>In order that I may get to that part of my life&rsquo;s experiences which
  I wish to relate fully, it is necessary that I give but scant account of what
  happened in the settlement up to the month of October, in the year 1788, when
  I left it for some months and made a voyage to the Cape of Good Hope in the <i>Sirius</i>. </p>
<p>As I have said, Lieutenant King was despatched in the <i>Supply</i>, with
  stores and implements of all kinds, to form a settlement at Norfolk Island,
  a very fertile spot situated about three hundred leagues from the mainland;
  it being in the Governor&rsquo;s mind that the island would grow crops for
  the main settlement, where the soil was not so good as it was at first thought
  to be. </p>
<p>Mr. King took with him Mr. Cunningham, the master&rsquo;s mate of the <i>Sirius</i>,
  Mr. Thomas Jamison, surgeon&rsquo;s mate, Mr. Roger Morley, an adventurer who
  had been a master weaver and had volunteered for the expedition to teach the
  people how to weave flax, which it was thought would thrive well on the island,
  two Marines and one seaman from my ship, nine male and six female convicts.
  All the convicts selected were men of good build and strength, for it was thought
  that, besides their other labours, they should cut down some of the tall pines
  growing on this island, which might serve to supply masts to ships calling
  at Port Jackson in the future.</p>
<p>The <i>Supply</i> sailed out from between the headlands of Port Jackson on
  February the fifteenth, and on the seventeenth discovered and named an island
  after the first Lord of the Admiralty &mdash; Lord Howe. This place, though
  small in extent, is yet of some fertility, and is about one hundred and thirty
  leagues from the mainland. Although barely two leagues in length, the south
  end rises to a great height, and about ten miles away is a vast, pyramidal
  rock, which was named after Lieutenant Ball, who commanded the <i>Supply</i>.
  The expedition arrived safely at Norfolk Island, and the brig returned to port
  on the nineteenth of March. </p>
<p>Our settlement now began to show signs of progress. The married convicts,
  for the most part, were industrious, and the Governor had given to each couple
  a small plot of land to cultivate, and the Bryants, so I heard, were getting
  to be well liked for consistent efforts and steady industry. The country all
  around the cove being so poor, a farm was begun at a place called Rose Hill,
  some miles up an arm of the waters of Port Jackson; a fine brick house was
  built for the Governor, and a hewn-stone hut for the lieutenant-governor; storehouses
  were also built of stone, and a barracks for our men was begun; meanwhile,
  both we Marines and our prisoners had to lodge in roughly made huts. Each of
  our officers was allowed a grant of two acres of land and a convict labourer
  to cultivate the soil. </p>
<p>Soon after we landed there began a serious difference between our commandant,
  Major Ross, and the Governor, about the duties of the Marines, and the people
  in the settlement took sides in the matter. The trouble came about in this
  way. One of my comrades, Private Joseph Hunt, struck another, named Will Dempsey,
  and was tried by court-martial. The sentence of the Court was that Hunt was
  either to ask public pardon before the detachment of Dempsey, or receive one
  hundred lashes. The major regarded this sentence as contrary to military law,
  because it gave the prisoner a choice of punishments, and ordered the Court
  to alter the sentence, and this the Court refused to do. Then Major Ross ordered
  the officers of the Court under arrest, and as they were wanted for duty the
  Governor tried to square the matter between the major and his officers. The
  officers held to their sentence, and the major held to it that he would have
  them under arrest, and so, after some weeks of persuasion, and finding that
  no good came of it, Captain Phillip ordered the officers to return to their
  duty. This was the beginning of the trouble between the military and civil
  authorities, and it lasted till the detachment returned to England, and was
  a source of great worry and vexation to our good Governor during his time of
  office, to see men that he liked personally at loggerheads. Major Ross knew
  his duty, and was perhaps a little sensitive about the dignity of the detachment.
  He did not, for instance, like the notion of our men being employed as gaolers;
  but Captain Phillip considered that it was our duty to help push on the work
  of building by seeing that the prisoners laboured hard. Our major thought our
  duty was simply to form an armed guard for the defence of the settlement, against
  mutiny on the part of the convicts or attacks by the natives. Captain Phillip
  also wanted our officers to form part of the civil Court, but they did not
  consider their commissions entitled them to act in such a capacity. Another
  cause of ill-feeling was, that the Governor thought it wise to form into constables
  the better behaved of the prisoners, and some of these fellows had the impudence
  to make prisoners of some of the men of the detachment, and Major Ross was,
  as I think he well might be, very indignant about it. </p>
<p>The prisoners were a miserable lot of creatures, who knew little or nothing
  of agriculture, and less, if possible, of the useful building trades and such
  like arts, and so we progressed very slowly in these things, and suffered many
  hardships. </p>
<p>We were constantly trying to make friends with the natives, who seemed harmless
  enough but very stupid. They were quite naked and had no habitations, except
  for a kind of screen made of the bark of trees, which they erected as a protection
  against the wind and rain, and under the lee of which they lay down. They seldom
  appeared in numbers exceeding twenty or thirty, and they lived chiefly by fishing.
  Their only arms were clubs and roughly made spears and a kind of curved javelin,
  which they could throw in such a clever manner that it would describe a circle
  in the air and return to them. Although they were, as a rule, terribly frightened
  of our firearms, yet they were by no means to be despised, on account of their
  treachery, and, indeed, the Governor was actually badly wounded by one of them,
  who threw his spear at His Excellency with unerring aim; but yet, Captain Phillip
  would never revenge himself upon the savages. </p>
<p>There were no wild beasts or other monsters to add to the terrors of our position,
  except very ferocious sharks, with which the waters of the bay were infested.
  There was one curious animal, called a kangaroo, which walked and leapt upon
  its hind legs in a very diverting manner, and there were hundreds of bright-coloured
  parrots. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the Governor&rsquo;s expressed determination to put down vice
  with a strong hand, one of the sailors of the <i>Alexander</i> was caught in
  the women&rsquo;s tents a day or two after our formal landing, and the rascal
  was drummed out of the camp with his hands tied behind him, our drummer playing
  the &ldquo;Rogue&rsquo;s March,&rdquo; and one of our own men was given one
  hundred lashes for the same offence. </p>
<p>I must not forget to mention that the first settler was a prisoner named James
  Ruse. To him the Governor lent thirty acres of land, at a place called Parramatta;
  this was in November 1789. This man married and had one child, and being a
  very industrious man was able to support himself in a year or so; whereupon
  His Excellency, being greatly pleased thereat, granted him the land as his
  own, and it was formally deeded to him on February the twenty-second, 1792,
  under the name of Experiment Farm.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Showing How A Rogue Led Captain Phillip To Look
  For Gold, And How Matters Progressed At The Settlement </p>
<p>The convicts&mdash;or at least the greater part of them were sad rogues, and
  it became necessary to flog and hang many of them before they could be got
  in any sort of good order. A week after we had landed, the triangles were rigged,
  and a few days later a gallows was put up just within cry of the little town
  we had made, and we soon had occasion to use them; indeed, hanging was the
  only cure for some of the wickedness that throve apace in the settlement; as
  for flogging, they seemed to take but little account of that, and would take
  the risk of it with great cheerfulness, by committing all sorts of petty thefts
  and such rogueries. </p>
<p>Not long after the expedition had landed there began to be some talk of the
  country containing gold, and indeed I had heard much of this on the voyage
  out, for many persons in the expedition had said that it was likely that gold
  would be found. Perhaps this was because that there were among us, people whose
  ancestors could remember the talk about the South Americas in the days when
  every adventurer strove to reach that part of the world where it was supposed
  that gold abounded; and so, in one way or another, the idea we had taken into
  our heads when we were very young got about among us again, that the metal
  was to be found in every unexplored country. Of course, too, the convicts,
  who always kept their ears open, soon grew to talk about the matter as well
  as the freemen, and we soon had an example of how one of the rogues made use
  of the common belief that gold was in the country. This fellow was a man named
  Daly, a big, bony Irisher with cunning, grey eyes. He had been transported
  for coining, and was a most incorrigible villain; and after I left the colony
  was hanged for breaking into the Government stores. </p>
<p>Well, one day up comes this fellow to one of our officers with a piece of
  metal resembling gold, and a story that he had discovered the place where it
  lay in astonishing quantities. If, he said, with many a twist and roll of his
  villainous eyes, his Honour, the Governor, would obtain his pardon and send
  him home with a certain female prisoner with whom he was intimate, he would
  reveal its whereabouts. He told this story with such a truthful air that he
  was believed by the Governor himself; or at least Captain Phillip, when Daly
  was brought before him, treated him with so much consideration that the rascal
  was inclined to brazen the matter out. </p>
<p>I was one of two Marines told off, as an escort over the man, to take him
  to Captain Phillip, and I heard all that took place. </p>
<p>Said the Governor, &ldquo;Now, Daly, my man, tell us all about this great
  discovery of yours and we will see what we can do for you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then the fellow, pulling his forelock, and looking as demure as a village
  rustic in spite of his rogue eyes, answered that &rsquo;twas true he had found
  gold, and that he had sold some of it for good coin to a gentleman belonging
  to the <i>Golden Grove</i>. </p>
<p>Then the Governor had a general muster and ordered the fellow to point out
  who &rsquo;twas that he had sold the gold to. But this he could not do, yet,
  notwithstanding, persisted in saying that he could point out the spot; so an
  officer and twenty men &mdash; I being one of them &mdash; were despatched
  with him in search of the place. After going about ten miles into the bush
  the fellow suddenly bolted and we had a great search for him, but could not
  find him, and returned to the camp, where the rascal was discovered sitting
  upon a log and laughing at us. </p>
<p>Major Ross then ordered us to seize the man and lash him to the triangles,
  and the Governor told the major to flog him until he confessed the truth. It
  took three hundred lashes to bring him to reason, and between every hundred
  he was asked to own that his story was a lie, but he stuck to it until the
  three hundred, and then confessed that he had lied from the beginning and that
  his only object was to lead the Marines on a wild-goose chase and fool our
  good Governor. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page126.jpg" width="621" height="750"></p>
<p>As time went on, our detachment became very discontented with the situation,
  for the Marines were now treated by the Governor with great severity for the
  slightest breach of discipline. A prisoner who struck a Marine was only punished
  with a hundred and fifty lashes, while a Marine who was found in one of the
  women&rsquo;s tents was given a hundred lashes; so there was much grumbling,
  but our officers were good and loyal men, else there would have soon been a
  mutiny, for they too were much discontented. </p>
<p>The first execution took place in February, when James Barrett, a prisoner,
  was hanged for stealing from the Government stores. This seems a very dreadful
  punishment for such an offence, but I will say for Captain Phillip that he
  was a very mild man and neither hanged nor flogged these rogues unless they
  richly deserved it, and he had often warned them of their fate if they stole
  food; but notwithstanding this, before I left the settlement in October many
  rascals were swung at the gallows, and flogging had become quite common.</p>
<p>In May my old master, Lieutenant Fairfax, returned to Sydney Cove from a long
  excursion into the country to Rose Hill, where he had been superintending the
  erection of an observatory and the laying-out of the principal farm of the
  settlement. </p>
<p>By his good exertions on my behalf I was promoted to the rank of corporal,
  and considering the short time I had been in the Service, I had good reason
  to be, and was, very proud of the honour, I can assure you; and my comrades
  envied me much. I was promoted in the place of the corporal who was in charge
  of an island which was close to the settlement, and where a garden had been
  made to grow vegetables and such like produce for the use of the <i>Sirius</i> and <i>Supply</i>.
  The place was called on that account Garden Island. The corporal in charge
  and a seaman were severely punished for grievously wounding a comrade in a
  quarrel, and these men&rsquo;s misfortunes led to my advancement. </p>
<p>The Governor about this time hit upon an idea to punish lazy prisoners instead
  of flogging them. There was a small rock near the entrance to the cove, which
  we called Rocky Island, and on this, when a man would not work, he was placed
  for a week on bread and water until he came to his senses, which, as he was
  alone and was not allowed more than a bare ration, did not take long, and he
  dared not try to swim back on account of the ferocity of the sharks. Rock Island
  on this account soon came to be called Pinchgut, and the device of the Governor
  proved very effective. I ought to mention that the Governor did not forget
  to keep up the King&rsquo;s birthday, and a whole batch of rogues who were
  to be hanged in that week were pardoned, so that they might have cause to remember
  His Majesty&rsquo;s goodness. </p>
<p>After a while, as we began to get fairly settled down, the transports left
  one by one for England, and soon the <i>Sirius</i> and <i>Supply</i> were the
  only ships left in the cove. Before leaving, the masters of the transports
  hove them down and overhauled them, and Captain Hunter told the Governor that
  the frigate &mdash; for so he called the <i>Sirius</i>, though she had little
  claim to that title &mdash;  would have to be served in the same way, for her
  hull was in a very bad condition, and when at sea and rolling badly, the timbers
  in her top-sides opened and shut in a very alarming manner. </p>
<p>Our farms at Rose Hill and on the shores of the settlement were not yet of
  much benefit to us, and rations were beginning to run pretty short, and the
  Governor began to get anxious, as soon as it became evident that our first
  year&rsquo;s crops would come to no good, all the seeds having got heated and
  spoiled on the long voyage. It leaked out, too, that Captain Phillip had expected
  a supply of stores from England soon after our arrival, and was now somewhat
  despondent, believing that the Government at home took but little heed of our
  necessities. </p>
<p>As for Norfolk Island, our hopes in that direction were all well enough for
  the future, but of course Mr. King could not be expected to send us supplies
  for many months to come; and so it came about that the poor, old, battered,
  and worn-out <i>Sirius</i> had to be despatched to the Cape of Good Hope to
  bring us stores for the settlement. </p>
<p>The fishing, which we had hoped would have helped us so much, also turned
  out a failure, and the great shoals of fine, large, pink-coloured fish with
  bony foreheads, which at first were plentiful in the cove, and were especially
  thick about the small rocky island which we afterwards called Pinchgut, suddenly
  left, and nothing but hungry sharks seemed to fill the waters of the harbour.
  Then, in addition to our many other troubles, the Indians, as we then called
  the black native inhabitants, began to get troublesome, and I cannot but help
  thinking that much of this was brought about by the good-nature of the Governor,
  who would not suffer them to be treated with anything but the utmost kindness;
  and when, as was often the case, one of our men or a prisoner was injured by
  them, and took a just revenge, the Governor always punished the white man;
  for, said he, &ldquo;I have seen enough of these people to know that they are
  a mild-tempered, innocent race, and I am convinced that they must have received
  provocation before they would do any of you an injury.&rdquo; </p>
<p>All the same, there is no doubt in my mind the savages of this country
  are a treacherous race, and I will give you one instance of their murderous
  inclinations. </p>
<p>On the thirtieth of May two men were cutting and gathering rushes at a bay
  near the settlement, and as they did not return at the time appointed, a party
  of our men was sent out to search for them. Their bodies were found in the
  bush, quite dead and with many of the spears of the natives sticking in them.
  The savages had carried away the rush-cutters&rsquo; tools. I knew these two
  fellows to be quiet, inoffensive prisoners, as I had often guarded them at
  work. The Governor himself, with a squad of our men, went out to try and find
  the murderers, and by-and-by he came upon a party of them; but he refused to
  punish them, saying that he was sure they must have had some provocation and
  the best way to treat them was to teach them better, and so he merely made
  signs to them that such conduct was very wrong. </p>
<p>This was, of course, humane treatment on his part, but I agreed with our major&rsquo;s
  opinion as I had often heard him express it, that it would have been better
  to have been a little more lenient with our detachment, and expended more powder
  and shot on the savages. </p>
<p>As soon as it was decided to despatch the <i>Sirius</i> to the Cape, and she
  was got ready for sailing, her crew took up their quarters on board, but some
  of the officers and a few handy men, such as carpenters&rsquo; mates, were
  to be left behind as useful to the settlement. </p>
<p>The Marine after guard, the Governor thought, ought to be left behind, but
  as it was necessary by the regulations that the ship, being one of His Majesty&rsquo;s
  frigates, should have some Marines on board of her, it was decided that four
  privates and a corporal in charge should accompany the ship for guard duty,
  and very proud was I when I learned that I was to be the corporal selected
  for this important post. </p>
<p>By this time our settlement had grown into quite a big town as towns go, for
  it consisted of over a thousand persons, and so you can easily understand that
  there was not much intercourse between the Marine detachment and the prisoners.
  We were forbidden to make friends with the convicts, and all the self-respecting
  men among my comrades had little to say to the men and women prisoners. </p>
<p>For these reasons I had not seen anything of the Bryants, and had no wish
  to renew my acquaintance with them, especially as my position had so changed
  that I had to be very careful not to jeopardise my superiors&rsquo; good opinions
  of me. However, just before I embarked on the <i>Sirius</i>, Lieutenant Fairfax
  had a conversation with me on this matter.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Merit Rewarded </p>
<p>I was, indeed, very proud the day that saw me made a Corporal of Marines,
  but I take pleasure to think that I bore myself with all due modesty. The lieutenant
  was good enough to congratulate me upon my elevation. </p>
<p>Said he &mdash; &ldquo;Good-day, Corporal Dew, I am glad to hear of your promotion.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I hope to do my duty as a non-commissioned
  officer as well now as in the days when I was of more humble rank.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you will,&rdquo; replied the lieutenant, &ldquo;only, Dew,&rdquo; and
  here he placed his hand on my shoulder, &ldquo;only try and be kind to the
  privates under you; remember you were once a private yourself, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kind manner in which this was said brought a lump to my throat, and at
  first I could find no words to answer him. </p>
<p>Then he laughed quietly, and I had some idea that he was making fun of me,
  though I could see little enough to laugh at in my new responsibility. </p>
<p>Presently he said, &ldquo;Have you heard or seen anything of your friends,
  the Bryants?&rdquo; </p>
<p>I thought this was scarcely the way to speak of such persons, but I answered, &ldquo;No,
  sir; of course, I have no intercourse with prisoners, it is against the regulations.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; of course, I might have known that you would not break a regulation
  of this kind,&rdquo; and I thought his grey eyes flashed quickly, &ldquo;but
  their position has been greatly improved of late. You see, the Governor, learning
  that Bryant was a good boatman, has put him in charge of a fishing party, and
  it is hoped that he may be able to get some fish out of the cove where less
  experienced men have failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guessed at once that this was the lieutenant&rsquo;s doing, and I thought
  it was very good of him to take so much interest in people of this description.
  So I remarked that I hoped these persons would recognise the leniency of their
  treatment. </p>
<p>Then the lieutenant suggested that it would perhaps do no harm if I were to
  say farewell to the Bryants, and if I cared to do so, he would give me a written
  permit to visit them in their hut. </p>
<p>I did not relish the idea very much, but Mr. Fairfax seemed to think that
  my elevation might perhaps serve as an example to them that good conduct was
  not overlooked by our superiors, and so I said with a good grace, that if he
  thought it right, of course, I would go over and see them. </p>
<p>Accordingly, the Sunday before we got to sea, after church parade, I walked
  over to the Bryants&rsquo; quarters. </p>
<p>Port Jackson contains many little bays and inlets, Sydney Cove being almost
  at the head of the harbour. On the east side of the cove there is a regular
  row of bays for the whole way to the southern headland, a distance of about
  six miles. In the first of these bays, next to Sydney Cove, our town farm was
  made and we called it Farm Cove; it was here that the Bryants&rsquo; hut was
  situated and the fishing boat was kept. </p>
<p>When I got to the hut, Will Bryant was sitting outside the door on the grass,
  mending a seine net, and as I approached him he rose from the ground and advanced
  to meet me. </p>
<p>At Solcombe, the last time I had spoken to him, he was a fine, stalwart, young
  fellow of about six or seven-and-twenty, and looking his age and no more. In
  those days, scarcely two years gone by, he was as straight as a musket-barrel,
  and he looked you in the face with his light-blue eyes in a way that told you
  he was as honest a man, smuggler though he was, as any in the village. Then
  he had fair, curly hair, and kept himself cleanly shaved and smart-looking,
  as such a properly built young man should do. </p>
<p>In the few times that I had seen him since we had landed, it was always at
  a distance, or I was too much occupied with looking at his wife to take much
  notice of him, and so I saw in him but little change; but now that I was thus
  brought face to face with him, I saw that he was no longer the Will Bryant
  I had known at Solcombe. </p>
<p>He was clad in the coarse, canvas clothing which had been served out to the
  prisoners, and which was all of one pattern, and stamped the men who wore it
  as being different to their fellows. Instead of the clean-shaven, well-cut
  features, and crisp curly hair that had made a good-looking fellow of my old
  acquaintance, he now wore a grizzled beard. His hair looked as if it had not
  been combed for many a day, and his face was roughened and grimy, and there
  was a strange, hardened look in it. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day to you, Bryant,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I hope that you are
  pretty comfortable, and that your wife is well.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day to you, Corporal Dew,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I am sure
  it is very good of you to ask. I am doing well, as well as I deserve, no doubt,
  being nothing but a common felon. My wife is well, our rich fare and gentle
  life, with all the comforts it gives us, you may depend, agrees with her. And
  what, may I make so bold as to ask, has brought you to visit us to-day? &rsquo;Tis
  something like two years since you have spoken to me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I only came to wish you good-bye as an old acquaintance; I am going
  away in the <i>Sirius</i>. Of course, we have not spoken to each other since
  you got into trouble; circumstances are different now to what they were at
  Solcombe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure it is very good of you to be so condescending, Corporal Dew.
  Here is my wife; no doubt she will appreciate your kindness.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then Mary came out of the hut, and looking at me very straight in the face,
  she said,  &ldquo;And what might you want, William Dew?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely came to say good-bye, Mrs. Bryant; being old acquaintances,
  I thought you might like to say farewell, as I am leaving in the <i>Sirius</i>.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed. I thought you had said good-bye to the like of us before &mdash; long
  before &mdash; &rdquo; </p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page136.jpg" width="661" height="750"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when I got into trouble,&rdquo; said Bryant, looking steadily
  at me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when William Dew and yourself got into trouble, and his skin was
  saved, thanks to you,&rdquo; said Mary. </p>
<p>I felt there was a bitterness in this meeting, and I thought it would have
  been better not to have brought it about. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are coming back with the <i>Sirius</i>, and so you will
  have another opportunity, when you are made sergeant, of showing how well you
  are doing. Good-bye, I wish you well,&rdquo; said Mary; and then she just gave
  me her finger-tips and a flash of her black eyes and went inside the hut again. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You must forgive us, Mr. Dew,&rdquo; said Bryant. &ldquo;We are strange,
  perhaps, to you, but then, you know, things are not what they were, and you
  are in a different position to us now.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I began to feel that somehow I was not showing to advantage, and that, perhaps,
  I had forgotten too readily how easily I might have made one of the prisoners
  betwixt whom and myself I was so ready to draw nice distinctions. Besides,
  I had begun to see that if Bryant had been less generous, and had not put the
  whole blame of my share in our smuggling adventure upon himself, he might have
  suffered less, and I might not have escaped scot-free. And so a feeling came
  over me that made me extend a hand to Bryant and say, as I turned to go away,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Will. If anything that I can do in the future will benefit
  the little one as yet unborn, remember, that Corporal of Marines though I am,
  the child will have a friend in me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Will Bryant pressed my hand, and before he could say some words that I could
  see he was struggling to get out, but which somehow he seemed too much upset
  to utter, I walked rapidly away to my quarter of the settlement. </p>
<p>Once only did I happen to look back, and I saw him standing where I had left
  him, with his hands clasped together and his face bent to the ground; then
  Mary came out from the hut, took his hand in hers as if he were a child, and
  led him inside.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">The <i>Sirius</i> Has A Bad Time And We Return
  To Sydney Cove </p>
<p>I will not here weary you with all the details of our voyage in the <i>Sirius</i> to
  Table Bay and back, save to say that before sailing we had to land eight of
  our guns and much of our shot to lighten the old craft and make room for the
  stores we were to bring back, and when we sailed out from Sydney Cove we saw
  Lieutenant Fairfax mounting these guns on a redoubt at the west side of the
  cove. Our voyage was a very wearisome one, for the old ship made very bad weather
  of it, and soon after leaving Port Jackson the scurvy broke out among our crew,
  and three seamen were buried at sea. This scurvy is indeed a most dreadful
  and malignant sickness, and the spectacle of our suffering crew filled me with
  horror and dread. Then, later on, we sprang a leak and we were heartily glad
  to cast anchor in Table Bay after so perilous an experience. As soon as we
  got to speak to the people of the place we heard that some of the transports
  on the way home to England had come to grief, and we thought we were well-to-do
  in having escaped shipwreck ourselves, for our sailors said the old ship was
  so rotten that they feared the voyage back, and many would have deserted but
  that we Marines kept too strict a guard upon them. </p>
<p>On the twenty-second of February we set out on our voyage back, and on the
  night of the nineteenth of April, when off a little island about twelve miles
  from the coast of Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land, we were nearly lost in a fierce,
  southerly gale; indeed, so perilous was our position that Captain Hunter said
  to the second lieutenant, who had succeeded Mr. King,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;This is beginning to look serious, Mr. Fowell. We are making leeway
  very fast and the land must be close to. Bear a hand and repair the storm mizzen
  staysail, and get it and the reefed foresail set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, &ldquo;but I fear, sir, that
  the foresail, instead of lifting her rotten old carcass to the sea, will only
  bury her into it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do it, however, Mr. Fowell,&rdquo; said the captain, in his
  quiet way. &ldquo;The men are getting nervous, and we must give it to her.&rdquo; </p>
<p>So for three hours the old <i>Sirius</i> plunged madly into the mountainous
  seas, every now and then huge green seas toppling over the waist and filling
  her decks, and all hands stood by and looked out to leeward in fear and trembling,
  for already we could discern the black loom of the land. And all the while
  Captain Hunter stood aft near me and my men who were at the relieving tackles
  at the rudder, and spoke words of caution and encouragement to us. </p>
<p>I shall never forget the horrors of that night, but I shall always remember
  with pride that whenever I looked at the features of our brave captain as he
  came near the binnacle light, my heart seemed to grow suddenly big, and that
  all fear seemed to vanish from within me. Once Mr. Fowell came and spoke to
  him, and said, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What will they do for stores now, sir, at the settlement? &rdquo; </p>
<p>The captain placed his hand on Mr. Fowell&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;God help
  them, indeed, if we go ashore; their necessities are very great, and I pray
  that we may get out of this mess for their sake.&rdquo; </p>
<p>For this was the nature of this good seaman and honourable gentleman; he ever
  seemed to think of every other person before himself; indeed, hot and short-tempered
  as he was sometimes, he was yet a man beloved by all on board the <i>Sirius</i>. </p>
<p>But it pleased the Almighty to save us that night, for after a while we managed
  to get the mainsail and another staysail set, and although she plunged and
  reared like a maddened horse, and great seas continually swept over the waist
  and into the cabins, yet she dragged through it somehow, and when daylight
  broke we saw that we had just weathered a high, rocky headland which lay about
  half a mile away from us. </p>
<p>Then, although we had escaped so far, we had yet to undergo a further terrible
  experience, for although we kept a great press of canvas on the ship to work
  her off the land, she strained and laboured so heavily in the truly awful sea
  that Captain Hunter thought all hope of saving her was past. So fierce and
  resistless were the huge waves which every now and then leapt bodily upon the
  decks and swept everything before them, that the condition and appearance of
  the ship was most pitiable to look at. All that day we struggled hard along
  the savage-looking coast line, upon which the surf beat with astounding fury,
  and not for one moment did Captain Hunter leave the deck, although his officers
  besought him to take a little rest. About midnight the wind shifted a couple
  of points to the southward, and we began to work off shore a little, the ship
  still staggering madly along under a great pressure of canvas, and every now
  and again taking huge seas over on the starboard side. That night was indeed
  a dreadful one, and when daylight broke through the black, lowering mist to
  the eastward, we saw that we were still close to the shore. Then our hearts
  failed us, especially when, a few minutes afterwards, some of the crew seeing
  the sea breaking heavily all around us called out that we were among the breakers,
  and the helmsman became so frightened that he threw the ship up in the wind,
  and sea after sea crashed down upon the poor old vessel, and fairly buried
  her for a few minutes. But after a while she freed herself, and Captain Hunter,
  seeing that there was not room to wear, stood on, and in another hour or two
  we saw that the land began to trend to the northward, and the sea moderating
  a little, the captain kept the ship away a point, and although she rolled terribly
  and still shipped monstrous seas, she steadily worked off this forbidding coast,
  and we breathed again, thankful to the Almighty for His mercies. From that
  time the weather steadily improved and the wind hauled to the southward, so
  that on the morning of May the eighth we once more saw the headlands of Port
  Jackson, and in the afternoon let go our anchor in Sydney Cove. </p>
<p>So heavy was the press of canvas we had carried during that terrible gale,
  that the figurehead was washed away, and the head rails and knees of the head
  were so much damaged that we were obliged to get lashings round the cutwater
  to secure it to the stem. </p>
<p>When we entered the cove we presented such a shattered appearance that the
  ship was not known. When they found out who we were they gave us a warm welcome,
  for soon after we sailed the flour had run so short that the allowance to each
  person was reduced by a pound a week, and this was restored on our arrival.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Some Description Of Our Town And The Sore Straits
  We Were In For Food </p>
<p>Almost as soon as the anchor was down we, the Marine guard of the <i>Sirius</i>,
  were relieved by some of our comrades from the settlement; for Captain Hunter
  had sent word ashore that we were quite done up and worn out with the hardships
  of our terrible passage. </p>
<p>The first news we heard was that a comrade of mine, named Tom Bullmore, had
  been killed in a fight with some of our men, and four of the Marines had been
  tried and sentenced to two hundred lashes each for the crime. Jim Rogers, another
  Marine, and a very respectable, quiet man, had been lost in the woods somewhere
  near the rush-cutters&rsquo; cove, and his remains were never found, although
  great search had been made for him; some supposed that he had been captured
  and killed by the savages. </p>
<p>A great deal of work had been done in our absence, and I will try and tell
  you what our town looked like.</p>
<p>The country round about the settlement was called Cumberland, after the Duke
  of Cumberland, and its boundary in a westerly direction was at Rose Hill, where
  our principal farm was situated. At this place a number of prisoners were kept
  at work, and a country house had been erected for the Governor. An officer
  and a company of Marines did duty in this wild and lonely place, in spells
  of three months about. </p>
<p>In a northerly direction the Governor had explored as far as Broken Bay, but
  no settlement was formed there. To the south Botany Bay was our limit, and
  there a fishing party was stationed to help eke out our provisions. </p>
<p>On the southern headland, at the entrance to Port Jackson, Mr. Southwell,
  a master&rsquo;s mate of the <i>Sirius</i>, was stationed with a small party,
  and their duty was to keep a look-out for the arrival of store-ships, which
  we were now anxiously expecting from England. They had built a few huts and
  a look-out place, and erected a flagstaff, and with this and one of the guns
  of the <i>Sirius</i> they were to signal arrivals, but, alas! nothing had arrived
  for them to signal. </p>
<p>The old <i>Sirius</i> rode at anchor close to the mouth of the harbour, and
  the <i>Supply</i> was moored on the west side near a cove in which we had,
  before sailing for the cape, hove the old ship down. Near the headland, on
  the north shore of the harbour, were fixed our scientific instruments; and
  this we called the Observatory. Then on the west side of the cove were the
  hospital buildings, and a main street was surveyed and laid out near here,
  its direction being about south-west from the shore. Barracks and temporary
  huts were close by, and also a prison for the ill-behaved. </p>
<p>On the east side of the cove the Governor&rsquo;s residence was placed, and
  near to it the main guard. A quarter of a mile inland were the officials&rsquo; houses
  and our officers&rsquo;  quarters, and then beyond were more huts for prisoners.
  The workshops were near the prisoners&rsquo; huts, and then on the outskirts
  of the settlement was the magazine. The triangles and the gallows were erected
  outside of all, up towards the head of the stream of fresh water, and not far
  from this was a burial ground. In the next cove towards the east was a small
  farm, and the fishing party to which Bryant belonged was hutted there. </p>
<p>A number of the Marines had brought their wives and children with them, and
  these married men&rsquo;s quarters were near the huts of the best class of
  married prisoners; but, as you may well believe, the wives and families of
  my comrades had too much self-respect not to keep well apart from the felons.
  Yet it was in somewise hard for the children, as I remember the wife of one
  of our men telling me that some of the convict children were as well trained
  as any in the settlement, but she, for one, would never let her children so
  much as speak to a felon&rsquo;s child. This was because two of a prisoner&rsquo;s
  children had sought to join in some childish game with her children. I could
  not but commend her for her caution, although, as I have said, it bore hardly
  upon the innocent offspring of both free and bond.</p>
<p>The daily work of the settlement was carried on with very proper regularity,
  and we were a busy community. In one place you would see a party cutting wood,
  in another a blacksmith&rsquo;s forge blazed and smoked, in another a gang
  of prisoners would be dragging stones for building purposes, and at short spaces
  you could everywhere see the bright coats and glitter of the muskets and bayonets
  of the Marine sentries on guard over the prisoners at work. Then, every now
  and then, Captain Phillip would be walking quickly about, looking at this or
  that gang as they worked, but never saying a harsh word to any one of them;
  indeed, some of them had so far gained his confidence that they had been appointed
  to supervise gangs of their fellows. </p>
<p>Bryant, I soon learned, had been given charge of a gang told off to fish the
  waters of the cove, and he had behaved himself well, and was well liked by
  his superiors. I also heard that a boy-child had been born unto him, which
  he and Mary had called Emanuel, after one of our officers who, with my lieutenant,
  had shown much interest them. </p>
<p>All this time, however, the stores were steadily running short, although the <i>Supply</i> had
  twice brought us a little from Norfolk Island, where Mr. King had made good
  progress, although there had been an attempt at mutiny there. The <i>Supply</i> had,
  on both voyages, taken down more prisoners, and the guard being small, the
  villains thought to overpower them. But Lieutenant King was not the man to
  be trifled with, and he soon put a stopper on that sort of work. </p>
<p>By-and-by matters came to such a bad pass for the want of provisions that
  six men of our detachment robbed a public store, and were speedily hanged for
  it; it was a terrible punishment, for we were all suffering sore temptation
  through our great hunger. </p>
<p>At last Captain Phillip, despairing of the arrival of the store-ships from
  England, determined, as Norfolk Island seemed to be flourishing, to send a
  part of our community thither; and to that end the <i>Sirius</i> and <i>Supply</i> were
  got ready for sea. Two companies of our detachment were embarked under Major
  Ross, who had orders to relieve Mr. King, who was to return to the settlement. </p>
<p>I was sorry that once more I was to be separated from Lieutenant Fairfax,
  who was to remain at Sydney Cove while I took up my old station on the <i>Sirius</i>,
  though I was not sorry for the trip, as, when we left, I was on the books of
  the <i>Sirius</i>, and not in the detachment told off to remain at Norfolk
  Island. Our numbers were made up of sixty-five officers and men, with five
  women and children from the detachment and the civil department, and one hundred
  and sixteen male and sixty-seven female convicts, with twenty-seven children.
  This would, on our arrival, bring the numbers on the island to civil and military
  and free people, ninety; male convicts, one hundred and ninety-one; female
  convicts, one hundred; and children, thirty-seven. </p>
<p>We got under weigh on March the sixth, 1790, with orders to return to Port
  Jackson as quickly as possible, for we were to voyage to Batavia for supplies.
  The day we left, the Governor put every adult person in the settlement, without
  excepting any one person, including himself, upon a weekly ration of four pounds
  of flour, two and a half pounds of pork, and one and a half pounds of rice. </p>
<p>So away we sailed for Norfolk Island, little knowing what was to befall us
  there.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">We See The Last Of The <i>Sirius</i>, And I Get
  A Great Reward </p>
<p>We made a fine-weather passage down to the island, the appearance of which
  my comrades and myself liked mightily, for its great greenness and profusion
  of rich verdure was very pleasing to the eye; but yet it was sad to think that
  a spot of such beauty, endowed, as we afterwards found, by an all-bountiful
  Providence with the choicest gifts of scenery, climate, and fruits of the soil,
  should so soon be turned by man into a veritable hell, and, as one of my officers
  said, disfigured by crime, loathsome vice, and misery. </p>
<p>We were lucky enough to land most of our passengers on the fourteenth of March,
  when the wind began to blow with much force, and then we had to stand off and
  on till the nineteenth, landing the remainder of the people as best we could,
  together with the light baggage. </p>
<p>There are but two or three landing-places on the island, the best being at
  Sydney Bay and at Cascade Bay. The latter bay is a very beautiful place, the
  shores being fringed with pleasant-looking clusters of richly foliaged trees,
  over the tops of which tower great giant pines; but in the interior the prospect
  is still more beautiful, and in places the country resembles nothing so much
  as some of the great parks in the south of England. Sydney Bay is on the south
  side of the island, and there is a very ugly coral reef here which shows its
  jagged teeth very plainly when the tide is out. About a league from Sydney
  Bay is a small, high island which was named Phillip Island, after our Governor.</p>
<p>Almost touching the mainland there is another island separated by a deep,
  narrow channel, and shaped somewhat like a horse-shoe, the open part facing
  to the east. In height it is about seventy feet, and in length, perhaps a third
  of a mile, and this, too, was covered with a thick, dense verdure of small
  trees. I have been told that, some five or six years after I left Norfolk Island,
  there came several very severe earthquake shocks which greatly terrified the
  inhabitants, who, on looking towards this little island, saw that part of it,
  nearest to the mainland, subside with a violent commotion under the sea, so
  that the channel was increased to half a mile in width. </p>
<p>The main island appears a precipitous spot, rising with great abruptness from
  the sea and furrowed by deep, storm-worn channels along its densely wooded
  sides. To land at Sydney Bay the boat has to pass through a narrow passage
  in the reef I have spoken of, and the landing is altogether very dangerous. </p>
<p>We landed most of our people at Cascade Bay, and some of the baggage, but
  none of the provisions, and Captain Hunter began to get greatly worried, for
  he knew that the stock of food on shore was but little, and that the people
  would soon suffer hunger, if the weather did not take up and enable him to
  get some of the supplies to them. </p>
<p>The <i>Supply</i>, having outsailed us, had managed, she being a much smaller
  ship, to get into Sydney Bay, and anchor without much difficulty; and so being,
  as I have said, fretful and anxious about the straits of those ashore, Captain
  Hunter determined to venture in close with the <i>Sirius</i> rather than box
  about to and fro off the island and perhaps get blown away altogether. The
  breeze being strong, he soon worked the ship close into the land, and then
  brought to, head off shore, and got out our boats and began loading them. </p>
<p>After the boats had sheered off, the wind began to drop a little, but there
  was a very heavy sea, and the captain saw that the ship began to set very much
  to leeward. Most of the crew being away in the boats, we who remained were
  at once set to get sail on her. But, notwithstanding all that we did, it soon
  became apparent that the ship could not weather the reef, and then, too, the
  wind shifted a couple of points against us, and she broke off in an alarming
  manner. </p>
<p>Captain Hunter at once threw her in stays, but she missed, and made a stern-board;
  but, providentially, the current carried her just clear of the breakers. Had
  we struck just at that part of the reef not a soul would have lived to tell
  the tale, for the sea was rolling on the jagged rocks with astonishing noise
  and fury. Once clear of the point of the reef, we filled again, and then brought
  to the wind on the other tack, but the ship still drifted fast towards the
  shore, and another attempt was made to stay her; this, too, failed, for the
  poor old ship was very much out of trim, and we could see by the weary, slow
  manner in which she came to the wind that she would never go off on the other
  tack. The moment the captain saw there was no prospect of her staying, he gave
  the order to let go all sheets and halliards, and our starboard anchor was
  let go, but before it reached the bottom, the ship struck with violence on
  a jutting ledge of the reef. </p>
<p>It was my first experience of the kind, and the dreadful noise and great shocks
  that followed each other with alarming quickness very much terrified me at
  first. The first time she struck, the rudder was torn away from the stern-post,
  and then for a moment or so she hung by her heel on the reef, with her stern
  high up and her bows so deep down that the sea poured in over the head and
  filled her decks to the waist. </p>
<p>In a few seconds, however, she lifted again to another huge roller that seemed
  to tower up far over the foreyard, and then she was hurled, still stern up,
  farther back upon the reef, and then settled down with a terrible crash, bilging
  in the whole larboard side like a rotten egg-shell. Most fortunately for our
  lives, the ship&rsquo;s bows were head on to the seas, which now dashed over
  her with incredible fury, otherwise, so huge were the rollers that had they
  struck us broadside on, we should have been capsized and rolled over and over
  like a log. In a few minutes after first striking, a great green wave leapt
  bodily upon her, and, lifting her forward, swung her round somewhat; she gave
  a frightful roll to starboard, and the fore and mainmasts went by the board,
  followed presently by the mizzen. </p>
<p>Encouraged by the example of the captain and master and other officers, our
  crew sprang to the work of cutting away the wreckage of the masts from the
  ship&rsquo;s side with a will, for there was a terribly strong back-wash, and
  every moment we feared that the great mass of masts and spars would be swept
  back over our decks again by the retreating waves and kill or maim every soul
  on board. I can well remember&mdash; so often do the veriest trifles at such
  times prove a matter of future interest to one&rsquo;s memory &mdash; that
  just as the main deck, from the terrific rolling, began to work loose, the
  master called out to those upon it to come aft to the quarter-deck, which he
  knew was safer, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you fellows think you
  are going to wait till the ship rolls her deck out so that you can all get
  ashore in it comfortably? Lay aft here, you lazy dogs.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Now, thought I, if the master can make a jest out of such a terrible situation
  as is ours, why should I, who know nothing of shipwrecks, be in any way afraid.
  So this gave me good courage, and from that moment my alarm ceased. However,
  within a few minutes I saw the wisdom of the master&rsquo;s banter, for the
  ship gave another heavy roll to starboard, and I saw a great gap begin to show
  on the larboard side between the deck and the bulwarks, and soon after the
  whole main deck worked right out of her and was washed away. </p>
<p>By this time the people on shore, under the guidance of the officers of the <i>Supply</i>,
  had managed to get a line out to us, and bent a hawser to it. Our end of this
  we bent to the stump of the mizzenmast, and the shore end was made fast to
  a tree. Having plenty of men ashore, they soon got a whip and traveller to
  work, and then Captain Hunter, calling upon three of our ship&rsquo;s boys,
  sent them ashore one after another. One of them, being terribly frightened
  at the look of the seething surf through which he had to pass, clung to Captain
  Hunter&rsquo;s legs, but the master grabbed him by his slacks, lashed him securely
  for his trip, and he was dragged through and landed on shore nearly dead with
  fright and exhaustion. </p>
<p>It took us nearly two hours before we were all landed; many of us, including
  Captain Hunter, were badly hurt in being hauled ashore, but yet, seeing that
  it had pleased God to spare our lives, none of us grumbled at our bruised and
  torn bodies, but rather thanked Him that we had any bodies left with enough
  life left in them to feel our bruises or wounds. </p>
<p>That night we were well cared for by those on shore, and, although I was very
  sore and stiff when I arose in the morning, I was yet determined to do my duty
  like a man. The weather was now moderate, and the surf no longer beat with
  savage fury upon the reef, and we saw that the ship still held together. Soon
  after mid-day an attempt was made to save some of the provisions, and two prisoners
  went off by the hawser to throw some of the live stock, such as sheep, fowls,
  and pigs, overboard, and so give them a chance to swim ashore. </p>
<p>Certainly these rascals did throw some of the animals overboard, and then
  very quickly made their way to the cabin and got drunk, and there they remained
  until the evening, when they roused themselves, lit all the lamps they could
  find and then burst open the spirit room and made merry. By-and-by as the wind
  died away we could hear the villains singing and laughing with much hilarity,
  and Major Ross, seeing that there was every chance of these fellows setting
  the ship on fire, called for volunteers to go off and toss the rogues overboard. </p>
<p>Thereupon I offered, and a young prisoner, one John Ascott, joined with me,
  and we were hauled off on the hawser, and not a moment too soon were we, for
  one of the after cabins on the larboard side &mdash; that which had been occupied
  by Major Ross  &mdash; was already on fire. We soon managed to put this out,
  and then turned to our two gentry, who were both lying down upon a pile of
  cushions in a very comfortable manner in a drunken sleep. Although Major Ross
  had told me to throw them overboard, I ventured not to fulfil this order, as
  he did not take it into account that they would be too drunk to move; so we
  dragged them on deck, made them fast to the whip, and they were hauled ashore
  in no gentle manner by my comrades, who were sore over the grog being drunk
  by two such villains. Then Ascott and I followed. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page154.jpg" width="632" height="750"></p>
<p>As soon as we were landed, we reported ourselves to Major Ross, who awaited
  us in company with Mr. King and other officers. Ascott, he made a free man
  for his good conduct on the spot, but merely told me to go and change my clothes
  and take a few hours&rsquo; rest. </p>
<p>The next day, however, he sent for me and said, &mdash; &ldquo;Corporal Dew,
  you have always done your duty like a good soldier, and last night I consider
  you earned a good reward. You have not been long in the Service, but your future
  rank is that of Sergeant.&rdquo; That was the proudest moment of my life.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">We Spend A Weary Time On A Lonely Island </p>
<p>The old ship held together for another day or two, and we Marines assisted
  the sailors and prisoners to save a good many of her stores and provisions;
  then it came on to blow again, a long, sweeping roll came in from the southward,
  and in a few hours great curling seas flung themselves upon the battered hull,
  and then we saw the last of the poor old <i>Sirius</i> reduced to a few heaps
  of wreckage dashed upon the rocks of Sydney Bay. </p>
<p>There is no doubt but that our major was a very different kind of man to Governor
  Phillip; and, without making so bold as to draw comparisons between them, Major
  Ross was, perhaps, too much of a soldier for the kind of work we were performing,
  besides which, he was a man of very hasty temper, which oft outran his judgment. </p>
<p>The very moment almost that the <i>Sirius</i> struck the reef, our drummers
  on shore beat to quarters, and the commandant proclaimed that the island was
  under martial law.</p>
<p>A meeting of the major and Captain Hunter and Lieutenant King was held on
  the next day, and a proclamation was then made, that there being no civil court
  on the island any crime would be punished with death, and this was necessary
  to prevent theft and a general mutiny, perhaps, as well. We were assembled
  to hear this proclamation read at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning on the
  day after the shipwreck. </p>
<p>The Union was hoisted on a flagstaff near the landing-place, and our detachment
  was drawn up in two lines, leaving a space in the centre for the officers.
  The <i>Sirius</i>&rsquo;s crew were in the rear of one line, and the prisoners
  in the rear of the other. </p>
<p>Then the drums beat a rally, and the colours which we had brought on the ship,
  on account of having the senior officer with us, were unfurled. The major read
  the proclamation, and then said he,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Officers and men of the civil and military detachment, you have heard
  the law of the island read, see that you observe it. Our position is a serious
  one, and I give you fair warning that it will be my duty to enforce, with the
  utmost severity, the penalty for infringement of the regulations.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then turning to the convicts he went on,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;As for you, be honest, industrious, and obedient, and all will go well
  with you, but&rdquo; (and here his face darkened visibly, and the row of felons
  behind the line of Marines craned forward their heads to catch every word he
  uttered) &ldquo;but take care how you offend. I will have no mercy on idlers
  or plotters.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then we all gave three cheers, and every person, beginning with the major,
  passed under the Union flag, taking off their hats as they passed it in token
  of an oath to submit to the martial law which was thus proclaimed. And so began
  our life on this lonely island under the rule of the stern and dreaded major. </p>
<p>The <i>Supply</i> was despatched on the twenty-fourth of March to Sydney Cove
  to let them know what had happened. She arrived there on April the fifth, and
  caused great misery by the news she brought. Lieutenant King went back to Port
  Jackson in the brig, and I heard one of the prisoners tell a comrade who worked
  with him that the very worst behaved of them was sorry that he had gone and
  left them to be dealt with by the major. </p>
<p>Hearing this dangerous sort of talk, I threatened the fellow, who, however,
  was very humble and said he meant no harm. &ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; said
  he, &ldquo;the lieutenant kept us from going to the triangles, and only sent
  us there when we deserved it, but the major follows us about with them.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Now I ought to have had this fellow reported for his talk, but somehow his
  manner was so respectful that I overlooked it. And, indeed, we were all sorry
  to see the last of Lieutenant King, who, while he was very severe upon evil-doers,
  was very just to all who did their duty. When he arrived in Port Jackson, he
  was ordered to England by Captain Phillip with despatches reminding the Government
  of the great urgency of sending us aid. Mr. King went by way of Batavia, to
  which place the <i>Supply</i> was sent for food on the eighteenth of April. </p>
<p>For eleven long, weary months we remained at this place, and those months,
  despite the great beauty of the island and the constant round of duty that
  gave me but little time to fret, were the hardest to bear that I, with even
  all the sad experiences I had undergone, have suffered. You must know we lost
  many things in the wreck of our old ship, all our energies being devoted to
  saving what was likely to be useful to us all in common, and so many of us
  went short of clothes and other comforts. My duties while I remained on the
  island were to take my turn with the other sergeants in charge of a squad of
  Marines who watched the prisoners at their work upon the roads, the buildings,
  or the farms of the settlement. This was called chain gang guard duty, because
  the prisoners for most part worked in chains shackled together. Truly it was
  a sad and heartrending spectacle, for, although these men were nearly all double-dyed
  villains and ruffians of the worst class, yet one could not but feel some degree
  of pity for their awful lot, and the everlasting clank, clank of their chains
  amid the beauties of Nature about us and them seemed to me a very strange and
  terrible contrast. </p>
<p>Under Lieutenant King the settlement had made great progress. He had erected
  many good and substantial buildings and made excellent roads about the island,
  and had some fine crops growing on the place. But all this had not been effected
  with the lazy rascals who were supposed to do the work without much wholesome
  punishment, and the convicts for the most part had had the impudence all taken
  out of them by a free use of the triangles when we landed on the island. For
  although Lieutenant King was naturally a fair man, he was a better officer. </p>
<p>The attempt to grow flax had, however, been a failure, though it was expected,
  as time went on, the settlers would by experience succeed in their efforts,
  and profit by the skill of Mr. Morley, the gentleman adventurer of whom I have
  spoken, and who had accompanied Lieutenant King to teach the prisoners how
  to manufacture the raw material. Indeed, long after this, one of the following
  Governors at Port Jackson thought much of raising flax on the island, and a
  ship was sent to New Zealand from Port Jackson to capture some of the native
  Mowrees, as the savages of that country are called, and bring them to Norfolk
  Island, for they are well skilled in its cultivation, and Captain Cook had
  seen them manufacture it into a rude cloth. </p>
<p>The island reminded me very much of my old home. It is a beautiful, fertile
  spot, all hills and dales, and bright green grass, and was very like the Isle
  of Wight, but not so large. </p>
<p>However, we were all too miserable and anxious to be relieved to think much
  of these things then, I can tell you, and very joyous we were when at the end
  of the eleven months the <i>Supply</i> hove in sight off Sydney Bay, and we
  lucky ones of the detachment who belonged to the ship&rsquo;s company of the <i>Sirius</i> marched
  down to the shore with drums beating and light hearts, and tumbled into the
  boats to take up our quarters on board the brig, which was taking us back to
  Port Jackson.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">The Second Fleet Arrives And We Hear News From
  Home </p>
<p>The gallant little <i>Supply</i> landed us in Port Jackson on the twenty-sixth
  of February, 1791, and as soon as we had disembarked we heard that many important
  events had happened during our absence. </p>
<p>When we left the settlement for Norfolk Island, the Governor had wisely put
  every person on short rations, but when the news came of the disaster to the <i>Sirius</i>,
  they were still further reduced, and then the prisoners became too weak to
  work very much. The rations served out were only two pounds and a half of flour,
  two pounds of pork, and two pounds of rice, to seven persons for one day. </p>
<p>So the <i>Supply</i> was sent to Batavia, under Lieutenant Ball, for all the
  provisions she could carry, with orders to get back as quickly as possible,
  and the poor, hungry folks on shore watched her sail away with very depressed
  hearts, knowing it would be long, weary months ere she returned. And, indeed,
  it was nearly six months ere she came back, but sad to say, she brought back
  but eight months&rsquo; supplies for her own people, for provisions were scarce
  at Batavia; but Lieutenant Ball gladdened the hearts of the people by informing
  Captain Phillip that he had chartered the Dutch snow <i>Waaksamheyd</i> to
  follow him with a cargo of stores. The Dutchman, however, did not arrive till
  December, and in the meantime the <i>Lady Juliana</i> had arrived from England,
  so the Dutch skipper, whose name was Smith, was not so welcome as he would
  have been had he arrived a little earlier.</p>
<p>The <i>Lady Juliana</i> was the first ship to arrive in Port Jackson of the
  second fleet of convicts sent to the colony. This second fleet consisted of
  the <i>Justinian</i> store-ship, the <i>Surprize</i>, <i>Neptune</i>, <i>Scarboro</i>,
  and the <i>Lady Juliana</i> convict transports, carrying between them nearly
  one thousand three hundred prisoners, and the <i>Guardian</i> man-o&rsquo;-war,
  converted into a store-ship, and which was injured by an iceberg and beached
  at Table Bay. The fleet left England in the middle of the year 1789, and the <i>Lady
  Juliana</i> brought letters and despatches up to July twenty-eighth of that
  year. When she was sighted at the look-out point on June the third, 1790, the
  flag was run up signalling that a ship was in sight. </p>
<p>A very exciting scene followed this news, many of the people actually weeping
  for joy. As she was working in between the heads, the Governor put off to her,
  but his return damped the joy of the unhappy people when it was known that
  she had brought with her over two hundred female prisoners, and only a few
  provisions saved from the <i>Guardian</i>. </p>
<p>She brought exciting news. A bloody revolution was going on in France, and
  our own King, George the Third, had been so ill that a Regency was appointed
  to govern the kingdom, but our people at the settlement rejoiced that he was
  now quite recovered. </p>
<p>She brought letters for many of the poor exiles, and Lieutenant Fairfax heard
  of the death of the old squire, his father. Miss Charlotte Fairfax wrote this
  letter, and the lieutenant was so good as to read portions of it to me when
  he saw me on my return from Norfolk Island, and his sister had actually remembered
  me, for she wrote: &mdash; &ldquo;Tell the lad Dew, who sailed for Botany Bay
  with you, that his father&rsquo;s health is breaking and that he grows anxious
  for his return.&rdquo; Then in another part of the letter Miss Fairfax urged
  the lieutenant to come home as soon as possible and bring me with him, that
  I might comfort my father in his old age. Indeed, her kind words concerning
  so humble a person as myself brought the water to my eyes, and affected me
  quite as much as did the sad news about my poor father&rsquo;s health. </p>
<p>The wreck of the <i>Guardian</i> was a serious disaster to us, for she was
  a fast ship, and had a fine lot of stores for the settlement, and by her loss
  we were left with a great increase to our population, but with no sensible
  addition to our means of feeding them. Fortunately, seventeen days later, the <i>Justinian</i> arrived
  laden entirely with stores, and within eight days the <i>Surprize</i>, the <i>Scarboro</i>,
  and the <i>Neptune</i> had all made the port. The fleet had had a terrible
  voyage, for on the three last-named ships alone two hundred and sixty-seven
  persons had perished out of one thousand and six who sailed, and three weeks
  after the ships arrived, fifty more had died and four hundred and fifty were
  on the sick list, the remainder being too ill to attend to themselves. The
  voyage had been full of mutinies, and dreadful bloodshed and troubles of all
  sorts; and every one of the officers on board, so my comrades told me, looked
  worn out with the terrible days of ceaseless anxiety they had gone through.
  The sight the prisoners presented when they were landed, many of them still
  heavily ironed, was a very horrid one, and the filthy condition of some of
  the most dangerous of them was revolting to the eye of every decent person. </p>
<p>There was a great fuss made about this voyage in England afterwards; but all
  this is another story, and I must come back to what concerns me alone. </p>
<p>The guards on these ships were furnished by men from a new regiment called
  the New South Wales Corps (the 102d Regiment), which was raised for service
  in the settlement. The remainder of this regiment was coming out in a third
  fleet of transports, and on board of His Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Gorgon</i>, which
  was to take the Marines home to England. Our battalion was told that the men
  might re-enlist for service in the colony in the new regiment; but you may
  depend very few of our men volunteered, and there was much rejoicing and looking
  forward to the arrival of the <i>Gorgon</i> to take us home. Indeed, I think the sight
  of the landing of the people from the second fleet proved too much for many
  of our men, and made them eager to be away from such horrors.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">The Lieutenant And Myself Meet With A Great Disappointment,
  And I Make The Acquaintance Of The Dutch Captain Of The <i>Waaksamheyd</i> </p>
<p>According to the despatches that Captain Phillip had received from England,
  the <i>Gorgon</i> ought to have arrived long before we returned from Norfolk Island
  in the <i>Supply</i>, and as month after month went by, and there was no sign
  of her, the Governor determined to send the ship&rsquo;s company of the <i>Sirius</i> home
  in the Dutch snow, the <i>Waaksamheyd</i>, which was taken into the Service
  as a transport, and we were greatly rejoiced at the prospect of a speedy return.
  Already the men of the new regiment and the Marines were at loggerheads, and
  we had fights occurring very frequently; the new men were certainly, to my
  mind, a very indifferent and badly disciplined regiment when compared to my
  corps. </p>
<p class="note">[A snow was a vessel with fore and main masts, and with another
  short mast stepped very far aft.]</p>
<p>In those times much of the discipline of the Service was relaxed, and so it
  was that Lieutenant Fairfax, who was now a much older and graver-looking man,
  would get talking to me, when I was off duty, quite familiarly. </p>
<p>The Bryants, he one day told me, were doing very well now. A second child
  had been born to them, and I thought it no little presumption on their part,
  and very good-natured of Mr. Fairfax not to be offended, that they had named
  the child Charlotte, after Mary&rsquo;s former mistress, Miss Fairfax of Solcombe
  Manor House. Will Bryant had now charge of the settlement fishing station,
  and, with his crew, was employed in fishing about the numerous bays in Port
  Jackson, he being allowed to cruise in any part of the bay inside the heads. </p>
<p>Only a few days after the lieutenant had told us about the chartering of the <i>Waaksamheyd</i>,
  he came to me with a very long face. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant, this is indeed hard lines; we are not going home after all
  until the <i>Gorgon</i> arrives. Only the actual ship&rsquo;s company of the <i>Sirius</i> go
  home in the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How then, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do we not belong to the <i>Sirius</i>? &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Governor has had my name taken off her books ever since she left
  for the Cape of Good Hope, and I have to do guard duty here until relieved
  by the remainder of the new regiment. And as you belong to my company, Dew,
  you, too, will have to remain. The Governor said he was very sorry for us both,
  but duty, you know, sergeant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was sad news for me, and as the lieutenant walked moodily away I thought
  of my poor old father, and wondered if I should see him again; but it was worse
  for Mr. Fairfax, whose estates badly wanted a man&rsquo;s management to put
  and keep them in order. </p>
<p>And so it came about that our brave Captain Hunter and the sailors of the <i>Sirius</i> went
  home in the Dutch snow, and had a dreadful voyage, meeting with bad weather
  and much sickness. They sailed out of Port Jackson on the morning of March
  the twenty-seventh, 1791, and arrived at Portsmouth on April the twenty-second,
  1792. There Captain Hunter was tried by court-martial for the loss of the <i>Sirius</i>,
  and was honourably acquitted. </p>
<p>But before the Dutchman left Port Jackson on this voyage, there occurred a
  very momentous event in the history of Mary and Will Bryant, and the master
  of the <i>Waaksamheyd</i> was greatly concerned therein, as you will see later
  on. </p>
<p>His ship lay at her anchor off the Farm Cove, after she had discharged her
  stores, and a gang of men were working on board, putting in some fittings in
  her &rsquo;tween decks, to receive the men from the <i>Sirius</i>. The captain
  of the snow was a Dutchman, whose proper name, I have no doubt, was Schmidt,
  but who always wrote it Smith, I suppose because he had the honour to sail
  under English colours since the Governor had chartered him. </p>
<p>He was a big, fat, greasy-looking fellow, with the look of a brewer&rsquo;s
  storeman disguised in a cloak and Guy Fawkes hat, like all the Dutchmen I had
  ever seen at Portsmouth looked. I got to know him very well by sight before
  he sailed; he was such a coarse, gross-looking man that I could not help disliking
  him even then. </p>
<p>At this time I had just been put in charge of the Farm Cove guard-room, which
  was situated some little distance from the water&rsquo;s edge, but right on
  the road to the Governor&rsquo;s house, and not far from the huts of the fishing
  settlement; and every time this great Dutch seal came waddling ashore, he had,
  in order to reach the main settlement, to first pass the fishing huts of Will
  Bryant and his party, and then the main guard-room; and as he always came ashore
  every day, he soon became quite a familiar person to us all. </p>
<p>Now, as soon as I was appointed to my new post, I knew that what I had dreaded
  from the first day of my arrival at the settlement had come to pass, and it
  had become my duty to act as gaoler over poor Will Bryant and the woman whose
  love I had once sought. </p>
<p>A list of the prisoners in this fishing village was furnished to me, and I
  was glad to read that I was not in any way to interfere with them so long as
  they behaved themselves. </p>
<p>As I have already said, Will Bryant was, by reason of his good conduct, placed
  in charge of the gang, whose names I will here set down on account of the adventure
  in which they afterwards took part. </p>
<p>First, then, there was Will Bryant and Mary his wife, and the children Emanuel
  and Charlotte. He was described in my list as of first-class behaviour, and
  the family, so my orders ran, having proved by their good conduct that they
  were entitled to every consideration consistent with the penal discipline of
  the settlement, were to be interfered with as little as possible. Then there
  were James Martin, James Cox, and Samuel Bird alias John Simms, all of whom
  had landed with us in the first fleet, and who were all &ldquo;good conduct&rdquo; men;
  William Allen, John Butcher, Nathaniel Lilley, and William Morton, who had
  been landed from the second fleet, and knowing something of boats, had been
  sent to Farm Cove to work in Bryant&rsquo;s gang. </p>
<p>The guard was made up of myself, a corporal, and four privates, and from these,
  sentries were found to guard the Government buildings, which now stretched
  from our guard-house across to Sydney Cove. But one sentry was on duty at night-time,
  posted outside the guard-room to give the alarm in case of sudden outbreak,
  the only danger we feared. Our guard-house was situated about half a mile from
  the shore, where the boats were hauled up on the mud and made fast by chains
  to posts. These chains were secured by a pair of handcuffs, and it was the
  duty of the corporal of the guard to see them locked and then hang the keys
  up in the guard-room. </p>
<p>During the day-time Bryant was responsible for the boats, and it was none
  of my business to interfere with him so long as his gang did not idle their
  time away, and kept good order. </p>
<p>Bryant was the only married man in the party, and he lived with his wife and
  two children in a hut some little distance from that occupied by the other
  men. </p>
<p>I took charge of this post on the twenty-fourth of March, 1791, at noon, and
  as soon as the relieved guard marched off and I had seen my sentries properly
  posted, I walked down to the shore to see the Bryants. </p>
<p>Will was busy, with the help of two of his men, in putting a new plank in
  the big boat, and the rest of the gang were away fishing in the harbour, or
  mending their nets some distance from us. </p>
<p>Mary sat at the door of the hut nursing her infant, and her other child, a
  fine, sturdy little fellow with fair, curly hair and blue eyes like his father,
  played at her feet. I only caught one glance at her face, which seemed to me
  to be thin and worn, but yet her dark eyes had all their old beauty in them. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see that your good conduct has led to your being given
  this job, Will Bryant,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;keep going straight and I&rsquo;ll
  not interfere with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are the new sergeant of the guard, sir,&rdquo; replied my old
  acquaintance. &ldquo;I thank you for your kindness and will try to keep straight,
  as you say.&rdquo; I thought that remark of mine would serve the purpose of
  hinting to Will that a man in my position could not make his duty fit in with
  any intimacy with him or his wife, and Will&rsquo;s answer showed, as he stood
  to attention when he gave it, that he quite understood my meaning. </p>
<p>&ldquo;That is your wife over there, I think,&rdquo; I went on, as if Mary
  was a stranger to me, and nodding towards the hut. Will was as quick to see
  my meaning, and understood that I thought it best his fellow-prisoners should
  not know of our former intimacy. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, that is my wife and children,&rdquo; he answered. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good. You may tell her from me that while you go on as you have
  been doing all will be well with you,&rdquo; and with this I wheeled about
  and marched off, never once looking towards Mary, or giving her an opportunity
  of speaking to me.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">I Talk With Captain Smith Of The <i>Waaksamheyd</i> And
  A Breach Of The Regulations Is Committed </p>
<p>As I have said, this fat Dutchman, Captain Detmar Smith, of the <i>Waaksamheyd</i>,
  came on shore every day, and I noticed that he always stopped at the fishing
  settlement on his way to the Government buildings, where he transacted his
  business. </p>
<p>On the second day after I had been placed at my new post I saw that he had
  struck up an acquaintance with the Bryants, and on nearly every other day since
  I had seen him talking and laughing with Mary. He always, after stepping out
  of his boat, made his way to the fishing settlement, and waddled up to the
  Bryants&rsquo;  hut, where he was in full view from the guard-house. </p>
<p>It would have been my duty to put a stop to this if the Bryants had been like
  ordinary prisoners, but Will was now a kind of constable over his gang, and
  as I had been expressly ordered by my superiors, and by Lieutenant Fairfax
  in particular, not to harass him in any way, I could not see my way to interfere. </p>
<p>When the transports were lying at anchor in the cove, it was the custom to
  put a sentry on board of them to keep the prisoners from stowing away or stealing
  the ships boats, but I had no orders to do this with the Dutch snow, because
  it was well understood that no prisoners were likely to stow themselves on
  board of her as she was to take home the crew of a King&rsquo;s ship. As to
  stealing her boats, Bryant had already two boats of which he might be said
  to have full charge, and no suspicion of his loyalty ever occurred to my superiors,
  so that the only matter I had to look to in connection with the eleven souls
  who made up the little settlement, was to see that Bryant and his seven men
  were in their quarters at sunset. As to Mary and her two children, of course
  I had no right to concern myself. </p>
<p>But, for all the trust put in Bryant&rsquo;s loyalty, I thought it my duty
  to keep my eyes open so far as his gang was concerned. I had no fear of the
  man himself, with his wife and two infants. I was sure he was safe enough;
  but his men might, I thought, at any moment take it into their heads to make
  a dash for their liberty. </p>
<p>Prisoners were very foolish in this matter, and although &rsquo;twas almost
  certain death to them, they often ran away into the woods and were never more
  heard of, dying, no doubt, by the hands of the savages or by starvation. So
  foolish were they that a large party once went away thinking they might reach
  China by constantly walking north, while in September, 1790, five men stole
  a punt from near Rose Hill and sailed her outside of the heads, never more
  being heard of; and, no doubt, they soon went to the bottom. </p>
<p>And so, when I noticed this big, greasy Dutchman and the Bryants getting friendly,
  I wondered very much what it meant, although I could in no way at first connect
  this circumstance with any attempt at escaping. </p>
<p>One day I thought I would see if anything was to be got out of Smith, and
  so as he was passing the guard-house and nodding a good-day to me, I stopped
  him and said,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Mr. Smith, I notice that you seem to take an interest in
  the Bryants. Of course, you know, it is against the regulations to have any
  dealings with prisoners.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He turned short round when I said this, and stepped up close to me, and putting
  a fat, dirty finger in a buttonhole of my tunic, rocked me to and fro by the
  sheer weight of his flabby arm. He spoke English but poorly, and he seemed
  to jerk the words out in a fat, wheezy voice as if his inside were lined with
  wool. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoost look here, mein freindt, dake my advites und do not inderferes
  mit a man&rsquo;s loaf affairdts. Der vrow of dis Bryandts is a very nice womans,
  und I do lide to dork mit her; und so, meinheer, do you not trooble, but make
  some moneys by mind you business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could have struck the big, fat, oily fool as he leered at me with his dead,
  fish-like eyes, but I thought better of it, for I guessed he was not the kind
  of man that a high-spirited woman like Mary Bryant would fall in love with,
  and that, whatever of love-making there was, was all on his side. So I only
  answered,  &ldquo;Very good, Mr. Smith; but, remember my duty is to see the
  regulations carried out, and so there must be no trading or interference with
  these people. Speak to them in a friendly way as much as you like, but don&rsquo;t
  make too sure that Mistress Bryant is in love with you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah, I onderstood der reguladions and I dakes care nod to break dem.
  Got-day, young soldier mans,&rdquo; and then he waddled off to the Government
  buildings. </p>
<p>On that same evening I saw the fellow meet Mary Bryant some distance from
  her hut, when her husband was on the shore making fast his boat, and I saw
  him hand her a big canvas sailor&rsquo;s bag, so heavy that, though she was
  no weakly woman, she could scarcely drag it to the door of the hut, where I
  watched her later on leave it. </p>
<p>But worse than this, the fellow held her hand in his, and sure enough, from
  where I watched, I could see plainly enough that she was lending a willing
  ear to his love-making. </p>
<p>Now this vexed me mightily. Clearly it was my duty to interfere, for this
  great, greasy Dutchman had no right to be giving bags of stores to prisoners,
  and if Mary Bryant, by association with vicious and wicked persons, had come
  to this, I must not allow my charges to be thus corrupted. </p>
<p>Mr. Fairfax was the officer of the guard for the next day, and when in the
  morning he visited the guardroom, I called him aside and told him all about
  it. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant,&rdquo; said he, wheeling round, and looking me square in
  the face, &ldquo;have you ever known me to neglect my duty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I answered respectfully, &ldquo;do you suppose I would
  dare to think of such a thing?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then. Let me give you a piece of advice. You are the youngest
  sergeant in this detachment, and, in consequence, you are apt to be a little
  over-zealous. You see things that you ought not to see, and &mdash; and in
  point of fact, Dew, you are a devilish good fellow in your way, but, for goodness&rsquo; sake,
  don&rsquo;t be so confoundedly fussy. I remember a certain little matter before
  we left Portsmouth, in which you committed a breach of the regulations and
  helped an old rascal to smuggle a cask of French brandy. Now, if I &mdash; eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hung my head at this and muttered, &ldquo;True, sir, you were very good-natured
  to me and I was very foolish.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so; but remember, Dew, these poor Bryants, by a little flirtation
  on the part of Mary with this fat Dutchman, have probably managed to get a
  bag of flour for the youngsters, or something of that kind, and if you don&rsquo;t
  see, why, there&rsquo;s no harm done. God knows the little children may need
  a change of food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I saluted and he walked away; but all the same, the more I thought of
  it the more determined I was to have a word or two with Mary on the subject,
  and so I watched an opportunity, and the next afternoon, which was the twenty-eighth,
  just before the boats came in I walked over to the hut and called her out to
  speak to me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with me, Sergeant Dew?&rdquo; she asked in her old,
  quick way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Bryant,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a matter of duty that
  brings me here. I have seen your goings on with the master of the Dutch snow,
  and I warn you that you must not &mdash; &rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you seen?&rdquo; and she turned upon me with a dangerous
  flash in her dark eyes. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen him give you a bag full of flour or something of the sort,
  and I have seen him making love to you and you encouraging him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Will, and forgive me for calling you by the old name,
  you who are now so much above the likes of me; I have as much dislike to that
  Dutchman as &rsquo;tis possible for woman to have, but,&rdquo; and there came
  a sad sobbing break in her voice that went straight to my heart, &ldquo;my
  two poor infants are half-starved and crave for more food. Will, Will, forget
  for once that you are a sergeant, forget for once that you are our gaoler,
  forget for once that Will and I are marked by the hand of felony, innocent
  though we are; but remember, and surely you will remember, Will, what I once
  was when you knew me in the days gone by for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, man as I was, the woman&rsquo;s pleading voice shook me strangely and
  as she stood there with her hands clasped together, as she had clasped them
  the day she had met Lieutenant Fairfax on the ship&rsquo;s deck at the Cape
  of Good Hope, I had to turn my face away. </p>
<p>She stood thus for a minute or so, and her bosom heaved quickly under her
  poor, shabby gown, and her great, black eyes, soft enough now, filled with
  tears, and then she spoke again, her voice full of quavering prayer. </p>
<p>&ldquo;For the sake of the old days, Will; for the sake of my innocent, suffering
  children who are as dear to the sight of God, born as they are in a felon&rsquo;s
  land, as if they had been born in England; for theirs, and mine, and Will&rsquo;s
  sakes, do not take away from us that which the foreign captain has given us.
  And, Will, if I did by a little harmless trickery take this bag from him, it
  was because, as the Almighty is my witness, that which was in it will prove
  our salvation. So I pray you do not judge me too harshly.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forgive me, Mary, if I did so, but you know that I must do my
  duty, and besides, what would your husband say if he saw you holding that fat
  fool&rsquo;s hand, as I did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Sergeant Dew, my poor Will is too loyal and true to the Governor &mdash; Heaven
  bless him! for he is a good man &mdash; not to be very angry with me if he
  had a thought that I took aught from the Dutchman, so say no more about it,
  and I promise you I will never speak to the Dutchman again as long as the ship
  is here;&rdquo; and she dried her tears and smiled into my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that condition, Mary, there&rsquo;s an end of the matter, and I
  am glad your husband knows nothing of it,&rdquo; and I turned to walk away. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, sergeant; won&rsquo;t you shake hands for the sake of the
  old times?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;and certainly I will shake hands,
  but we shall often see each other, I daresay, though I don&rsquo;t think it
  well to appear friendly with you, because duty, you know, forbids.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then I shook hands with her, and went back to my quarters, feeling that Mary
  Bryant was at any rate an honest woman, and safe from temptation by reason
  of the love she bore her children.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">A Still Greater And Very Daring Breach Of The
  Regulations Is Committed By Will Bryant And His Gang </p>
<p>The news of the wonderful voyage made by Lieutenant Bligh in an open boat
  after he had been set adrift with some good men by his mutinous mate, Fletcher
  Christian, had reached our settlement by the ships of the second fleet, and
  I often pondered over it and thought it would be nothing to marvel at if some
  of our prisoners tried something of this nature. But I had no fear of Bryant.
  Happily married and with two infant children, there was little fear that he
  would dare upon such a hazardous venture, though I did sometimes fear that
  some of his crew might steal a boat and make the attempt. It was with some
  thought of this in my mind that, when I returned to the guard-house on the
  evening of my talk with Mary Bryant, which was the twenty-eighth of March,
  1791, I took particular notice that the keys of the locks on the boat moorings
  were hanging in the guard-room at ten o&rsquo;clock, when I turned in for the
  night. </p>
<p>I felt pretty easy in my mind, because our fishing boats were very poor. The
  big boat was in use with the fishing gang at Botany Bay, and the two boats
  in Bryant&rsquo;s charge were much too small for venturing outside the heads
  in. One of them was a small ship&rsquo;s gig; the other was rather larger,
  pulled six oars, and was rigged cutter fashion. She had just been repaired
  by the fishermen and was in good order, but I thought it would be little short
  of madness, though the weather was at this season fine, to venture to sea in
  her. </p>
<p>The next morning at daybreak I was awakened by the cry of the sentry, &ldquo;Guard,
  turn out.&rdquo;  Every man of us ran to the door, seizing our muskets on the
  way, and wondering what had happened. </p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, sentry?&rdquo; said I, seeing nothing to call us for in
  the dim morning light. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The boat, sergeant,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the biggest boat is gone.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Sure enough she was gone. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken away from her moorings and drifted to sea,&rdquo; said the corporal. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;How could she get off
  the mud and break her chain? Fall in, and let us see how many prisoners are
  left, for that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter. Bryant&rsquo;s hut first; he
  may be able to help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we marched across to Bryant&rsquo;s hut, and knocked loudly at the
  door, but to my great fear got no answer to our knocking. Then without ceremony
  we opened the door and walked in, and the next moment I understood all that
  had happened. </p>
<p>There was no one in the place, and the clothes which usually hung on its walls
  were missing. The hut floor was boarded, and one of the boards had been taken
  up, and was lying beside a hole scooped in the earth, that &rsquo;twas plain
  had been used to conceal something in. </p>
<p>It was no use standing about looking at this, so I marched my men to the hut
  in which the unmarried prisoners were quartered, and found that the whole seven
  of them were gone. But, placed in one of the men&rsquo;s bunks where it could
  not be easily seen unless strict search was made for it, was a big sheet of
  paper folded and addressed to Sarah Young. This woman was, I knew, a female
  prisoner that James Cox, one of Bryant&rsquo;s gang, was waiting for permission
  to marry, and so I seized the letter and made no scruple of reading it. This
  is what it said,&mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dear Sarah, &mdash; Do you give over those vices that
  I have caught you at more than once, or you will come to a bad end. If you
  had been a different woman I should not have joined these mad men, or I would
  have taken you with me. We hope to reach Timor. We have a compass and a quadrant
  which Will Bryant got from you know who, and there are those among us who know
  how to use them, Good-bye.&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your friend,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;James Cox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After reading this, I traced the footmarks of the fugitives down to the boat&rsquo;s
  mooring post, where I found the chain was filed through; and scattered about
  were some four or five pounds of rice, which the fugitives had spilled in their
  hurry. The big seine was lying in its place, but one that Bryant had been making
  for use in the small boat, and which was a very handy net, was missing, and
  I now remembered that I had wondered why he had taken so long over the job. </p>
<p>The next thing to do was to report the matter, and so I sent a man post-haste
  to headquarters, and soon Lieutenant Fairfax came to the guard-house. </p>
<p>As soon as he saw me he beckoned me over to him, and said hurriedly, in a
  low tone,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember our talk the other day? Well, what you said was quite
  right, and I was wrong. For Heaven&rsquo;s sake be quiet about it. I am in
  no good odour with my superiors now, and there will be the devil to pay, and
  no pitch hot, if my carelessness comes to light.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;for you&rsquo;ll find that
  you can trust me, sir. I have been in a scrape myself.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help reminding him that once he had obliged me by holding
  his tongue, and now I was to oblige him, though &rsquo;twas mighty disrespectful. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Good man, Dew,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and when we get out of this
  infernal settlement I&rsquo;ll settle down and lead a quiet country life with
  no regulations to break, and I&rsquo;ll buy you out, and you shall be my tenant
  as your father was my father&rsquo;s.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then he said, so that the others could hear him, &mdash; &ldquo;I am afraid
  we will never catch them, because we have no boat to chase them with, and the
  chances are, by the time we get the big boat round from Botany Bay, they will
  be all at the bottom, or eaten by the sharks.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">I Am Homeward Bound </p>
<p>The news of the escape of the Bryants spread like wildfire among the people
  of the settlement, and many of the prisoners showed their excitement very plainly.
  At twelve o&rsquo;clock Lieutenant Fairfax and myself were brought before the
  Governor to give our version of the matter. </p>
<p>His Excellency was greatly put about, but he could scarcely blame me or my
  men, although he wanted to know how it was the fugitives had got hold of stores
  and water without the guard knowing anything about it; and he also wanted to
  know who was the man referred to in James Cox&rsquo;s letter to the woman Young. </p>
<p>I said I could not tell, but that I suspected. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you suspect?&rdquo; asked the Governor. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith, the master of the Dutch snow,&rdquo; I answered. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think he helped them?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Before I could answer, the lieutenant broke in. Said he,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, sir, Sergeant Dew reported to me that this man
  was seen talking a good deal to the Bryants, and I told him not to interfere;
  they were not to be molested while they behaved themselves.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; said the Governor, &ldquo;that will do. Sergeant
  Dew, I don&rsquo;t think you or your men are to blame; you may go.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then afterwards I heard that the Governor gave the lieutenant a great talking
  to for taking things so easy, and by the way, said he, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the persons you took so much interest in on the voyage out,
  are they not, lieutenant?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, but I hope you don&rsquo;t think I relaxed my duty on that
  account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will say no more about it, Mr. Fairfax,&rdquo; said Captain Phillip,
  rising from his seat.  &ldquo;You will be leaving the settlement shortly, and
  no good can come of any fuss that is made now, and so I have nothing more to
  say.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And, so far, the matter ended; but my lieutenant told me, a few evenings afterwards,
  the Governor sent for him again and, producing a chart, showed Mr. Fairfax
  the course that these wretched people would most likely take, and although
  the Governor spoke very angrily of Bryant and the other men, he said to the
  lieutenant that, for the sake of the poor woman and the tender children, he
  would be pleased to hear that they had been picked up by some ship, or had
  reached some haven of safety on the coast. That they could ever reach the East
  Indies was, of course, quite out of the question; and then the two fell to
  talking of the strange and wonderful voyage of Lieutenant Bligh, who had navigated
  his boat four thousand miles from Otaheite to Cowpang without losing a man.
  Captain Phillip, it appeared, thought that the fugitives would soon see the
  folly of their attempting a similar voyage in such a wretched cockershell,
  and would run ashore somewhere on the coast near Port Jackson, and live hiding
  in the woods. </p>
<p>The time now began to hang heavily upon our hands waiting for the <i>Gorgon</i> to
  take us home, and she was so long on the passage, that we really began to entertain
  fears for her safety. </p>
<p>Up to the time of her arrival, which was on the twenty-first of September,
  nothing of great moment happened that I need record here, except that the natives
  were occasionally very troublesome, and the Governor tried all in his power
  to make friends with them, even going the length of capturing one or two of
  them, and trying to teach them civilised manners and customs. </p>
<p>The Marines, both officers and men, were offered a choice of becoming settlers
  in the country, and some of them were also asked to join the New South Wales
  Regiment. Mr. Fairfax would not think of this for a moment, and I was quite
  of his opinion, and was glad enough, I can tell you, to embark on the <i>Gorgon</i>,which
  we did on the tenth day of December, 1791, and sailed away from Port Jackson
  on our voyage to England. </p>
<p>The third fleet had arrived in the previous month, bringing 1695 male and
  168 female prisoners and another detachment of the new regiment, and we got
  away just in time to escape further suffering from short provisions. </p>
<p>My old commandant, Major Ross, and the headquarters company of our detachment,
  was also able to leave in the <i>Gorgon</i>, by the arrival of the transports bringing
  more troops. </p>
<p>And now I have told you all that concerned my stay in the settlement at Port
  Jackson, which all the folks on this side of the world will still insist upon
  calling Botany Bay. </p>
<p>You will learn, from what I have written, that although I had served over
  four years in the Service, and had never seen a shot fired at the enemy, for
  the miserable savages, and almost as unhappy prisoners, could scarcely be counted
  as the King&rsquo;s enemies, yet I had risen to the rank of sergeant by a steady
  attention to my duty, and perhaps deserved my three stripes quite as much as
  men who had been engaged in shooting down their fellow-creatures amid the stirring
  scenes of war that the ballad-mongers sing of.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">I Meet With A Great Surprise At The Cape Of Good
  Hope, And Lieutenant Fairfax Loses His Dignity </p>
<p>The <i>Gorgon</i> sailed out of Sydney Cove with a very strong, hot wind from the
  westward, and we soon settled down cheerfully enough to life on board the ship,
  for we knew that every day brought us nearer home. The ship was a very good
  sailer, and there was a vast difference between her and the old <i>Sirius</i>.
  On the <i>Sirius</i> every seaman swore at being sent to sea in such a tub,
  as they called her; but the sailors of the <i>Gorgon</i> were very proud of their
  ship, and certainly she was a very comfortable and fast craft. </p>
<p>Nothing of moment happened until we reached the Cape of Good Hope, but on
  the passage, Mr. Fairfax, who, now that we were so soon to return to civilian
  life, grew every day more condescending towards me, and often talked with me
  over our strange adventures. </p>
<p>He had fully made up his mind to leave the Service when we got to England,
  and for my own part I was glad and thankful for the promise he had made me,
  that he would help to purchase my discharge as soon as he could come at his
  estate and set his affairs in order.</p>
<p>We more than once spoke of the foolhardy venture of the Bryants, never doubting
  that they had perished miserably, for what could eleven persons, two of them
  tender children and one a woman, ever hope to do towards reaching civilisation
  in such a frail craft as was their open boat. </p>
<p>I remember that one night when we were speaking of this matter, one of the
  ship&rsquo;s officers joined us and told us that among his other adventures
  he had been cast away in a country ship in the East Indies, and that he and
  the master and seven or eight of the crew had voyaged 700 miles in an open
  boat to the island of Ceylon, and that, though their boat had twice capsized,
  yet none of them lost their lives, although they suffered the very greatest
  agonies from thirst. His story made me remark to my lieutenant that perhaps,
  after all, the Bryants might have gone a great distance before disaster overtook
  them; but the <i>Gorgon</i> officer said it would not be possible for such a small
  and overcrowded boat as we had described, to live out even a moderate gale.
  And so the very faint hope that I had begun to cherish about Will and Mary
  died away altogether; for this officer was a very able and good officer, and
  had been forty-two years in King&rsquo;s ships, </p>
<p>We arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in March, 1792, and soon completed taking
  in our stores, and were within twenty-four hours of getting under weigh, when
  a Dutch vessel entered the bay, and as soon as she saw our ensign, hoisted
  the private signal, and a boat was sent to her. </p>
<p>When the officer in charge returned, he brought with him the news that the
  Dutchman was a vessel chartered at Batavia by Captain Edwards of the <i>Pandora</i>,
  a King&rsquo;s ship. </p>
<p>The <i>Pandora</i> had been sent to Otaheite to search for the mutineers of the Bounty.
  She had secured some of them, and was proceeding on her way home, when she
  was wrecked, on August twenty-eighth, 1791, on a coral reef off the north coast
  of New Holland. Eighty-nine of the <i>Pandora&rsquo;s</i> crew and ten out of the
  fourteen mutineers were saved, and after a terrible boat voyage made their
  way to Timor, where they had arrived on September the fifteenth, 1791. </p>
<p>It now fell out that we were to convey these persons to England, and all our
  boats were got out to bring them on board. </p>
<p>When the boats ranged alongside with these poor people on board, I leant over
  the rail watching them, and thinking of the unfortunate Bryants. If Lieutenant
  Bligh, whose sufferings I had heard of, had had such a terrible experience
  in his boat voyage; if Captain Edwards and his crew had suffered greater hardships
  than it is possible to describe in their journey in their boats, what chance
  had these poor, ignorant creatures &mdash; one of them a woman with two tender
  infants &mdash; what chance had these of surviving such an undertaking? </p>
<p>It was with such thoughts that my mind was occupied, when Mr. Fairfax tapped
  me on the shoulder and asked me of what I was thinking, and I told him. </p>
<p>I noticed that as he spoke to me he was strangely moved, and that his face
  flushed and then paled again, as if he were seized with a vertigo or fever,
  and before I had got out my answer to his question, he interrupted me, and
  gripped my arm very tightly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dew, my lad; you do not know all. For God&rsquo;s sake, man, look over
  the side at that boat now coming alongside, and see if you can recognise her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He almost dragged me further along the deck, to where we could get a better
  view of those who were in the boat, and looking down, I saw, but could scarce
  recognise, the face of the woman who, but a few moments before, had been in
  my thoughts. </p>
<p>A Marine who stood on the foot of the landing-stage held out his hand to help
  her out of the boat, then I saw that the sadly altered, wasted, and feeble
  creature who stood up with trembling feet to step upon the <i>Gorgon&rsquo;s</i> ladder,
  was indeed Mary Bryant. With one hand she held, clasped to her breast, the
  little infant, the namesake of her former mistress. </p>
<p>With slow and laboured steps she toiled up to the gangway, assisted by the
  Marine, and when in a dazed, melancholy way her great, dark eyes, so full of
  suffering and pain, for a moment rested upon the ship&rsquo;s company, I felt
  a quick gush of tears come to mine, and turned away my head. </p>
<p>&ldquo;God help the poor wench; &rsquo;tis cruel hard,&rdquo; said an old
  boatswain&rsquo;s mate beside me; and, indeed, from all sides there came a
  murmuring sympathy for the poor girl. </p>
<p>But Mr. Fairfax, forgetting rank, and station, and all else, rushed to the
  gangway, and pushing aside the rough but honest hands of those who sought to
  help her, took Mary in his arms, child and all, and carried her to a hatchway;
  then, before she could realise this act of my patron&rsquo;s, and who it was
  whose heart was so big and noble as to have naught else for her but tender
  pity, she fainted dead away; and then all the rough men who stood about her
  strove who should be the first to help the surgeon and Mr. Fairfax in his endeavours
  to restore her to life, and not a man among us all, but respected the lieutenant
  for that generous act of his, or spoke of it afterwards but as proof of his
  noble manliness. Indeed, the old boatswain&rsquo;s mate, who had spoken so
  pityingly to me about Mary, turned to those about him, and, with a very dreadful
  oath, for which, I am sure, he was pardoned by the Power above, said that the
  soldier officer was a good sailor spoiled, and ought to be an admiral. </p>
<p>I had no eyes nor thought of others but of Mary at this time, and stood like
  a fool, just stupidly looking on, as they chafed her hands and tried to restore
  the little life remaining in her. But when I had recovered my senses a little,
  I learned that all that remained of the poor creatures who had escaped from
  the settlement were come on board; and here I will set down who they were.
  First, there was Mary and the infant Charlotte, and then James Martin, John
  Butcher, William Allen, and Nathaniel Lilley. These six were all the survivors
  of the eleven souls who had left Port Jackson a whole year before. </p>
<p>Mary, when she had recovered a little, was tenderly carried below, and Captain
  Parker of the <i>Gorgon</i>, good-hearted man, ordered that she should be well tended
  by the ship&rsquo;s surgeon, and placed in one of the officers&rsquo; cabins
  at the after end of the ship, which was readily given up to her. </p>
<p>No words of mine can describe the alteration that I saw in her, and even the
  four strong men were so different, and had grown so old and worn with hardships,
  that I scarcely knew them again; and their dreadful appearance, felons though
  they were, filled me with the strongest pity. </p>
<p>And so, in a few hours after this, we were once more under weigh, bound for
  England, and down below, on the lower deck, lay the poor prisoners. Alas! I
  thought, what will our arrival in England mean to them? </p>
<p>But Mr. Fairfax bestirred himself, and so did everyone on board, to do the
  best that could be done for these unhappy creatures, and as the days at sea
  went by, bit by bit he got from Mary a history of the terrible adventure she
  had passed through, and it was all written out, to present as a Petition to
  the authorities for her forgiveness. And so the history of this ever memorable
  voyage was set down in full by my lieutenant, in Mary&rsquo;s own words, as
  nearly as could be done, save where the prisoner Butcher, whom he afterwards
  saw very often in Newgate, supplied particulars of the places they had touched
  at, and some other matters of which poor Mary had no knowledge; and in this
  form I here relate it; and in no book or printed paper whatsoever has this
  complete and truthful account ever before been set down; therefore, preserve
  it, so that your children and their children may read the particulars of this
  memorable voyage. And I trust that God in His mercy, should any of you adventure
  in foreign lands, may preserve you from such awful dangers that befell Mary
  and her unhappy companions in misery.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Mary Begins Her Story </p>
<p>It was I, and I alone, who brought this dreadful suffering upon us; and I
  pray that He who knows our weak human nature will forgive and pardon me for
  sacrificing, by my mad and insensate folly, the lives of those unhappy men
  and my innocent child. </p>
<p>My husband had grown contented with our lot, and by his good and steady conduct
  and industry had won not only the confidence and good opinion of Captain Phillip,
  but that of all the officers of the settlement. </p>
<p>Though &rsquo;tis nearly five weary years ago since the day that he and I,
  with our vile and hardened companions, were landed on the shores of Port Jackson,
  and we met for the first time after long months of severance, yet as long as
  God gives me life I shall never forget the soft, tender light in his brave,
  blue eyes when he sprang to my side and, amid the jeers and foul and mocking
  jests of the abandoned felons who surrounded us, took my hands in his and pressed
  his lips to mine. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, Mary, my own brave girl,&rdquo; he said, and I felt his great,
  strong chest beat and throb as he pressed me to his heart, &ldquo;may God help
  me to be a good husband to you.&rdquo; And then soon after came our marriage,
  so strange a marriage as it was. Not as I had once thought of it, when Will
  had first told me he loved me as we sat in a little nook on Solcombe Cliffs
  two years before; for he had promised me that after he had run but one cargo
  more he would give up smuggling, and then come to the Manor House and claim
  me for his wife. &ldquo;And, Mary,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;because you have
  stuck to me and believed in me when the old women have croaked and sought to
  make mischief between us, I will show them such a wedding when we are married
  that it won&rsquo;t easily be forgotten by Solcombe folks, or, indeed, anywhere
  on the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that was but a foolish lover&rsquo;s dream. You know all that happened
  since then and since the day I tried to help Will escape from Winchester Gaol.
  I have tried to forget all those long, long months of misery, all the agonies
  of my life on board the transport among the reckless and sin-hardened women
  whom one shuddered even to hear speak, and I did forget it all the day when
  I laid my face upon his bosom in a strange land, and wept as would a child
  when it seeks its parent&rsquo;s arms with the joy of knowing its sorrows are
  over. </p>
<p>And so there we were married. Little sound of bells was there, as there would
  have been in Solcombe Church; only the clank of manacled felons and the harsh
  words of command of the soldier officers as, the ceremony over, we were marched
  away to our quarters to begin our lives as convicted criminals in a strange
  land. </p>
<p>The heavy tide of suffering that swept over me and mine since the first year
  or two of our married life has taught me many a bitter lesson; and though our
  lot was then hard and cruel, and my heart was nigh to burst with the shame
  and indignities that befell us, yet would I endure them all again a thousand
  times over, for I, who suffered least, made Will&rsquo;s lot the harder to
  bear by my bitter repining and fierce temper. Not that I repined or was grieved
  that I had followed so far the man I loved; but I soon began to hate with a
  bitter and deadly hatred our vile and horrible surroundings, and the sight
  of the red-coated Marines, who stood guard over Will and his fellow-prisoners
  from dawn till dark, as they toiled on those wild and savage shores, made my
  heart ache, and I sometimes felt as if I could have torn the musket from a
  sentry&rsquo;s grasp and, with Will by my side, fly into the woods or die in
  the attempt to regain our freedom. </p>
<p>But Will, brave-hearted Will, toiled steadily on, tenderly caring for me,
  and lightening, by his cheerful words and talk of a yet happy future, my dulled,
  repining heart, though he, I knew full well, suffered more than I. </p>
<p>Month after month passed, and day after day came &mdash; the same ceaseless
  round of toil for Will; for although, by reason of his willingness to work,
  and his great strength, he had become a favoured man with the Marine officers,
  yet he was given his full share of toil, and indeed somewhat more. </p>
<p>By-and-by, though, it came about that one of the Marine officers, who had
  known Will in the old, happy days at Solcombe, and who had ever proved a friend
  to him, spoke to the Governor about him, and told how that he was both a good
  boatman and a skilled fisherman; and Captain Phillip, like the good, kind-hearted
  gentleman he is, promised he would see to the matter and put Will to something
  better than hewing stone, which was then his work. In a few weeks the Governor
  kept his promise, and Will was given charge of a fishing boat, and ordered
  to live just across the ridge from Sydney Cove, where there was another small
  bay. Here we, with a few other prisoners, made the fishing station, and being
  away from the main body of prisoners we had the whole bay to ourselves, and
  were interfered with by no one, not even the guard of Marines who were posted
  between us and the rest of the settlement. </p>
<p>For a long while matters went on well with us. To please my dear husband I
  had curbed my tongue and temper, and so I, too, became somewhat of a favourite
  with Will&rsquo;s superiors, and learned the folly and harm of giving way to
  any outbursts of temper when some one of the officers would talk to either
  Will or I in a way that only the free man dare talk to a felon. </p>
<p>We had been quite a long time living at the Farm Cove, and my second child
  was about six months old when a great dearth of food afflicted us all, prisoners
  and free men alike, at the settlement. The country itself yielded us nothing;
  no food came from England as Captain Phillip had expected, and before long
  we soon felt what the actual pangs of hunger meant. Up till this time we had
  always had, at least, enough food, hard and coarse as it was, and after the
  Governor had placed us all on short rations, Will and his men would sometimes
  manage to hide a few small fish in the bosoms of their shirts for my children.
  But by-and-by not even this much did they dare do, for the moment the boat
  touched the shore their take was carefully examined and counted by some of
  the Marines detailed for the duty. Day by day matters grew worse, and the small
  ration of flour and pork served out to us had to be still further reduced;
  and then I had the misery of hearing my eldest child, my boy Emanuel, wail
  and cry for more food. Of course both Will and I stinted ourselves so that
  our children might have their fill, but yet the food itself was so coarse and
  poor that naught but the pangs of hunger would have made the poor infants cry
  for it. And then, in despair at the sight of their pinched and wan faces, I
  determined to cast about and seek food for them myself. </p>
<p>Although Will and I did receive more consideration from our gaolers than any
  others of those prisoners who made up the fishing settlement, we had, in common
  with them, to be within doors at sunset. Now I knew that all along the muddy
  shores of the Farm Cove there lay buried in the mud great numbers of cockles,
  and I had seen Nathaniel Lilley and James Cox, two of Will&rsquo;s gang, bring
  a basketful of them ashore one day and roast them on a fire which had been
  kindled on the beach to boil a pot of pitch. Coarse and ill-flavoured as these
  things were, they were yet good enough for hungry people, and so it was that
  every night one of Will&rsquo;s gang would steal down to the shore when the
  tide served, and, groping in the mud with his bare hands and feet, secure enough
  for me to boil late at night over a small fire. But this had to be done with
  great caution, for so scarce had food now become that had it leaked out that
  these cockles were so handy to the settlement, they would have soon been all
  taken; besides this, we who took them would have been punished for stealing. </p>
<p>One night, however, one of the Marines of the guard-house near our little
  settlement saw someone moving about in the darkness, and challenged and fired,
  and the man, who had nearly filled his basket with cockles, dropped and fled
  in affright to his quarters, and then came and told Will and I of what had
  happened. </p>
<p>Much against my husband&rsquo;s wish I set out, and after some search found
  the bag and carried it to our hut, but we dared not kindle a fire that night,
  for fear that the guard might discover it. However, after that, as the men
  were frightened, I always went, and by this means was enabled to eke out our
  scanty supply of rations and give more of our flour to the children who, poor
  things, needed it sadly. </p>
<p>As I was returning home to our hut one evening, wet and cold, carrying a small
  bag half filled with these shell-fish, I heard a step behind me and then a
  man came up to me and placed his hand on my shoulder. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening to you, Mistress Bryant,&rdquo; said he, with a laugh
  that at once angered me. &ldquo;I watched your doings down to the shore, and
  as I am struck with your pretty face I made up my mind to wait for you as you
  came back.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Now this man had been one of the officers of the transport which had brought
  me to the settlement, and during the passage he had continually thrust himself
  forward upon me, though it was but short and bitter speech I ever gave him.
  He had been given an appointment on shore by Captain Phillip, and though I
  did not often see him, yet whenever I did, he would always contrive to say
  something to me that, had Will heard it, he would have fared badly for it,
  not only from Will but from the Governor as well. </p>
<p>I turned and faced him, and asked him how he dared to stop me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare, my dear, I will dare much for such a face as yours,&rdquo; and
  he made to me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Touch me at your peril, Mr. King&rsquo;s officer though you be, and
  I will call the sergeant of the guard,&rdquo; and I struck back his hand with
  my pronged shell-fish stick. </p>
<p>This roused his evil nature, for then he told me, with a snarl, that he knew
  all about our stealing the shell-fish at night, and that he would report it
  and have us flogged. So then, in great terror, I begged his mercy and asked
  him to consider my feelings as a mother, for it was only because my children
  were starving that I was taking the shell-fish from the cove. Finally he let
  me go, but only on the condition that I would meet him at some future time. &ldquo;Otherwise,&rdquo; said
  he,  &ldquo;I will spoil these shell-fish suppers of yours, Mistress Bryant&rdquo; </p>
<p>I was so terrified at the harm that this man might do us that I ran all the
  rest of the way to our hut, and flinging down the bag of shell-fish at Will&rsquo;s
  feet, burst into tears. And then I told him of my adventure. </p>
<p>It was from that night that I first conceived the idea of urging my poor Will
  to better our condition by escaping from the settlement altogether.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">The Beginning Of A Strange And Hazardous Enterprise </p>
<p>The awfulness of our situation, and the life to which we were bringing up
  our dearly loved children, became daily more apparent, and so this idea of
  mine about escaping took such possession of me that I gave my husband no peace.
  At first he opposed all my arguments, and declared he would not betray the
  trust reposed in him, but my sinful obstinacy prevailed in the end, and dearly
  have I paid for my wickedness. </p>
<p>For a long time the lack of opportunity prevented us from forming any plan
  of escape, but after a time chance threw in our way so many opportunities that
  it was not wonderful that we took advantage of them. </p>
<p>First it came about that John Butcher was sent to the Farm Cove. He was a
  prisoner who came out in the second fleet, and was a man who had been to sea
  and learned the art of navigating, and when I heard that he had this knowledge,
  I told Will that he must engage him to go with us in the boat and guide us
  to some country where we might earn our bread without fear of discovery, but
  on no account to let the others suspect our intention, lest they should betray
  us. </p>
<p>Then the Dutch ship came round to the cove, and the master of her, a Mr. Smith,
  took it into his head to show a partiality towards me, and this silly vanity
  of his I resolved to turn to the account of us all. And so it was that I encouraged
  him, with such arts as women understand, to believe that he had won my heart,
  and that for his sake I could be false to my dear, dear husband and my children.
  I told him many dreadful lies, and at last got him to believe that if it were
  possible to supply my husband with the means of escape, Will would gladly leave
  me to my fate, and then I could safely grant all that the Dutchman asked. </p>
<p>The vain fool believed my words, and actually gave me, by degrees, a good
  lug-sail, a compass, and a quadrant, with a chart and other books such as Butcher
  required to steer us to Timor, which was the name of the country we had decided
  to try and reach. To show what a dishonest rogue the fellow was, we found that
  the two books he gave us did not belong to him at all, but to Captain Hunter
  of the <i>Sirius</i>, who was going home in the Dutchman&rsquo;s ship. I suppose
  he had stolen them from Captain Hunter&rsquo;s cabin, for both books had that
  gentleman&rsquo;s name written on them. </p>
<p>We hid these things under the boards in our hut, and then we began to collect
  provisions. </p>
<p>Just about this time a new sergeant of Marines was given the charge of the
  guard-house at our cove, and he noticed Smith speaking to me, and ordered me
  not to talk to him, because it was against the regulations. I had known this
  soldier, whose name was Dew, in former times, and I think he was stricter with
  us on that account, for he was a good man and stern soldier, and I fancy that
  because he was once my friend he was all the more sensible that friendship
  must not stand before his duty. But for all his strictness I contrived to get
  from Smith many useful things, besides a bag full of provisions. </p>
<p>The other prisoners, however, had got scent of our intentions, and although
  my husband feared to overcrowd the boat, and dreaded to take them with us,
  for some of them were very desperate men, at last, our plot having become known
  to them, we had to agree that they should accompany us. One of these men was
  anxious to take with him a woman to whom he was to have been married, but the
  sergeant had become very suspicious of our movements, and so my husband, who
  was the finest and strongest man of the party, and who was chosen leader of
  it, hastened our departure, and we left one night suddenly. </p>
<p>We had collected from the Dutchman, and by saving out of our scanty rations,
  100 lbs. of rice, 112 lbs. of flour, 14 lbs. of pork, and 10 gallons of water. </p>
<p>At half-past ten, on the night of March the twenty-eighth, it being fine and
  the wind fair, we filed through the chain by which the boat was fastened, and
  loading her almost to the water&rsquo;s edge with the stores, we all crept
  into her and pushed silently away, keeping close in along the southern shore,
  and rowing very gently with muffled oars. Just as we rounded a rocky point
  on the eastern side of the Farm Cove, the boat ran into a floating bush or
  tree, and in freeing it a branch broke off and fell upon the face of the babe
  at my breast. It awoke with a loud, wailing cry of terror, and the night being
  so still and fine we were seized with a great fear that the sound might have
  reached someone on shore. </p>
<p>We lay perfectly still for some minutes, and then began rowing again, keeping
  well on the southern side of the small rocky island called Pinchgut. The wind
  was directly astern of us, and there being no ships lying at anchor so far
  down from Sydney Cove from which we could be discerned, Will and Butcher stepped
  the mast and hoisted the sail and guyed out the boom so that the others could
  keep on rowing. </p>
<p>In another half an hour or so we were close to the entrance of Port Jackson,
  and my heart gave a bound when I looked ahead and saw the black expanse of
  open sea lying before us. We now felt the roll of the sea, and the oars were
  taken inboard, and we stood out between the black shadows of the headlands
  into the open ocean. At this moment Nathaniel Lilley, a noisy, excitable man,
  stood up, and flinging his cap overboard, cried out,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for liberty and Timor!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, you fool!&rdquo; said Will, fiercely, and he struck him in
  the mouth with such violence that the man was nearly sent overboard.</p>
<p>And so began this strange and hazardous enterprise, begotten of my folly and
  wickedness, and of my husband&rsquo;s love for me. When the day broke we were
  many miles away from what had been my home for three unhappy years; and my
  youngest child still slumbered upon my bosom.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">A Voyage Along The Shores Of New Holland </p>
<p>The chart given to me by the captain of the Dutch snow is before you, and
  on it you will see the weary leagues we journeyed, with here and there our
  stopping-places marked by a cross. Many and many a time, when we had run into
  some place of refuge on the coast, to rest our cramped and wearied limbs, and
  had made us a rude shelter of boughs to protect us from the burning rays of
  the sun, Will and Butcher, and, indeed, every one of us, would so pore and
  study over it, that in time we knew every line and mark and name traced upon
  it, and watched with great concern every fresh line pencilled upon it by our
  navigator.</p>
<p class="note">[Note by Sergeant Dew.&mdash;Take great care of this rough chart,
  my children. It is the only relic of this wonderful voyage, and it came into
  my possession through Mr. Fairfax, who obtained it from Captain Edwards of
  the <i>Pandora</i>, to whom it was given, with various other papers concerning Bryant&rsquo;s
  party, by the captain of the Dutch ship that brought them prisoners to the
  Cape.] </p>
<p class="note">[Note by the Editors. &mdash; A facsimile of the chart in the
  possession of Sergeant Dew&rsquo;s descendants is here given. It is without
  doubt one of Cook&rsquo;s earlier charts, showing the discoveries and track
  of the Endeavour in 1769 and 1770. The reader, by comparing it with a modern
  map of the coast-line, will be able to form some idea of the remarkable boat
  journey performed by the Bryants, and the slight knowledge of navigation possessed
  by Butcher. Every mile of this coast is now surveyed and charted. At the time
  of the Bryants&rsquo;  escape it was practically unknown.] </p>
<p>Our boat was so small and so deeply laden, that as soon as daylight broke
  on the memorable morning that followed our escape, and the breeze strengthened
  a little, the water began to dash over us on all sides, and we had to take
  to constant bailing to keep from foundering. At about ten o&rsquo;clock we
  brought to, under the shelter of a small, high island, and made shift to effect
  a better disposition of the many things with which the boat was lumbered up.
  Butcher and some of the others wished us to land on a little beach on the lee
  side of the island, so that we might take out the mast and alter the sail in
  some way, but Will, to whom the others looked for guidance, refused, as he
  thought it not unlikely we might be pursued. So, without further delay, we
  sailed out again, and all that day continued to make good progress, even though
  the boat was so heavily laden and cumbersome. </p>
<p>At daylight next morning we were close to the entrance of a harbour, which
  Butcher said he thought was Port Stephens, and as we were all now suffering
  from the great heat, Will determined that we should put in there and rest for
  a day; but after we had rounded a high, conical headland, we found that there
  was such a great swell rolling in, and so strong a current sweeping out, that
  we could make no headway against it with the oars; so we had to turn back,
  and hoisting our sail again, kept on our way northwards. After sailing for
  some ten or eleven leagues, we saw the entrance of another harbour, and this
  we succeeded in reaching safely. Here we grounded the boat on a white, sandy
  beach, and Will carried myself and Emanuel and my little Charlotte out of the
  boat, and made us shelter under the trees, for we were all but perished of
  weakness, and my boy cried continually from the pain of his hands, which the
  cruel sun had burnt to a deep red. </p>
<p>We remained at this place for five days, and I thanked God for His goodness
  in bringing us there, for Morton and John Simms, in searching the rocks for
  shell-fish, found not only these, but many score of great lobsters, which made
  us a bountiful repast, though one of our party, William Allen, was like to
  have died from gorging himself too heavily. </p>
<p>When night came on we kindled a big fire, and while the rest of us slept two
  kept watch, for fear of the Indians; and, indeed, it was well they did so,
  for when it became light, we heard the sound of voices in the woods, and looking
  about us discovered four naked savages standing on a hill near by. They carried
  spears in their hands, and then, after making threatening gestures to us, disappeared
  down the other side. This made us very careful during the rest of our stay,
  and we removed to another sleeping place further away from the woods, so as
  not to be surprised and cut off in the night. Our boat, too, was always loaded
  up in readiness for us to fly, the moment it was necessary, and sometimes,
  when we saw the black figures of the Indians moving about on the opposite shore,
  I would take my two children and go into the boat, which lay afloat at anchor
  in shallow water. All the first two days of our stay the men caught a great
  store of crayfish, and we used to cut off the tail part, which is full of good
  meat, and splitting them open, lay them upon a rough frame-work to dry in the
  sun. On the fifth day we found we had nearly two hundred pounds weight of this
  meat, and it was carefully tied up tightly, and placed on board with our other
  stores. </p>
<p>We left this place with lighter hearts for our perilous venture, and scarcely
  had the boat got away more than a stone&rsquo;s throw from the shore, when
  we saw some score or so of naked Indians rush down from the woods and examine
  our camp. Some of them threw their javelins at us, but these failed to reach
  us. We called this place Port Bountiful, although on our chart it was called
  Port Stephens, which Butcher said was wrong, for that place was ten leagues
  to the south. </p>
<p>We kept at sea for the next three days, only landing twice, to stretch our
  stiffened limbs and replenish our stock of water, for although since we had
  left Port Bountiful it rained almost unceasingly, we had no means of catching
  the water. I think it was this constant exposure of their thinly clad bodies
  that sowed the seeds of disease in those most precious to me, and then, besides
  this, it much injured our poor store of provisions. </p>
<p>On the fourth day we came to a place where there was a wide river entrance,
  on one side of which was a sandy beach of great extent, and on the other, hilly,
  well-grassed headlands. We sought to enter this river, but perceived that the
  surf broke across the entrance, and we all but capsized before we could turn
  the boat round and make seawards again. The prospect of going, perhaps, a great
  distance further north before we could find another place of refuge, greatly
  disheartened Will and all of us; and then, to add to our troubles, the wind
  suddenly turned to the northeast, and a tumultuous sea quickly rose. Almost
  in despair as to what we should do, for the coast to the southward was very
  rocky and dangerous-looking, with no sheltered beaches, we fortunately perceived,
  on the southern shore of the entrance to this river, a little indentation under
  a high, conical hill. With great skill and caution Will and Butcher succeeded
  in wearing the boat round, although at the imminent risk of our lives; and
  hoisting a foot or two of the sail, we ran swiftly into the little cove and
  beached the boat. In quite a short time the wind increased to a gale, and we
  thanked God for our escape, for our boat could not have lived a minute in such
  a furious sea that now swept in with thundering rollers upon the coast. </p>
<p>Above the place where we had landed was a well-grassed and lightly wooded
  country, and as there were no signs of Indians visible, Will and his men hauled
  up the boat out of reach of the furious seas, and we proceeded to choose a
  resting-place on the flat ground above; for Butcher said that this northeasterly
  gale would last three days, and so it proved. We made a rough protection against
  the fury of the wind, and that night we all slept well save my poor boy, who
  seemed to ail more and more every day. The following day we turned our boat
  over and paid her seams with tallow made from the fat of our pork rations,
  and having dried our clothing, I made a comfortable resting-place under the
  boat for my infants, and sat beside them on the outside, while Will and the
  others sought for lobsters on the rocks, but found none, for the surf was still
  too heavy to discern anything in the rocky pools. </p>
<p>The next day the wind began to moderate, but the sea was still very mountainous,
  and so we were in no hurry to leave; besides this, my boy Emanuel was ill of
  a cough that shook his poor little frame greatly, though he never complained.
  Strange to say, though, my baby began to show signs of better health, and would
  laugh and crow when Will smiled or spoke to her. In the forenoon Morton, Lilley,
  Allen, and James Cox set out along the southern shore of the river to look
  at the country, but they found, after going a mile or so, that it turned northward
  and that the water was salt. However, they discovered that a fresh-water stream
  with a reedy margin ran into it just where it branched off, and among these
  reeds they found a great many nests of wild duck, in which were eggs. These
  they brought back with them, and we made a very good meal, though it went to
  my heart to see that my poor boy ate but a morsel. Morton told me he had seen
  a flock of ducks swimming about on the river, and I thought that we might,
  perhaps, snare one and make some strengthening broth for the child, but Will
  said it could not be done, and so I could do naught but pray that the child
  might be spared to us. This place, we found, was not marked on our chart, but
  it was said by Butcher to be in 31&frac12;&deg; of southern latitude. </p>
<p class="note">[Port Macquarie, at the entrance to the Hastings River, discovered
  and named by Oxley in 1828, lat. 31&deg; 25&rsquo; 45&rdquo; south. The fresh-water
  river was Coolenbung Creek, which debouches into the Hastings near its mouth.] </p>
<p>We would have stayed here a day or so longer, but that on the evening of the
  third day we saw many savages walking along a sandy spit on the northern side
  of the river, and feared to stay lest we might be surprised with the boat out
  of the water. Therefore, at sunset we once more put to sea, and the wind now
  being from the east and south, we were able to sail clear of the long, sandy
  beach which lay on our left hand. All that night, however, it rained in squalls,
  and we were drenched and shivering when the sun rose.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Mary&rsquo;s First Punishment Overtakes Her </p>
<p>For the next week or so we continued steadily onward, landing occasionally
  to rest and refresh our wearied bodies, the boat making good headway with a
  fair south-east wind; but we suffered dreadful misery from the continuous strain.
  We found that as we progressed northwards the savages increased in numbers
  and daring, so that we were soon obliged to resort to landing only as darkness
  came on, leaving our refuges for the night at dawn. </p>
<p>One of our companions, John Simms, who was also known as Samuel Bird, was
  a man of a very violent and intractable temper, and he was constantly lamenting
  that we had no muskets and ammunition with us wherewith to kill some of the
  Indians; but Will, who, although he was a courageous man, was no lover of bloodshed,
  rebuked him for his desire to shed blood needlessly. For this Simms gave him
  a saucy answer and a threatening look, and I could see that trouble was brewing,
  for my husband was not the man to take foul words from any man. However, he
  said naught at the time, but when we were landed at our next stopping-place,
  which Butcher told us was called Glass House Bay, he waited till we had eaten
  our evening meal of dried lobster and salt pork, and had set the night watch,
  and then rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Simms,&rdquo; said he, and although he spoke so quietly, I knew
  that danger was in his voice, &ldquo;this morning you told me that you were
  as good a man as I. Stand up and prove it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>With that they sprang at each other, but Simms was no match for my Will, who
  struck him but once and fractured his jaw, and then turning to John Butcher,
  who stood by laughing, he reproved him sharply. It was no laughing matter,
  said he, for people in our perilous position to quarrel among themselves. They
  had made him their leader, and their leader he meant to be, unless a better
  man came forward. </p>
<p>Now this Butcher, who is, for all his sneering tongue and reckless manner,
  a man of proven courage, thought fit to make him an answer that brought him
  no good, for Will suddenly darted out his hand, and seizing him by the throat,
  shook him as a dog shakes a rat, Butcher the while thrusting madly at him with
  his knife. For a minute or so they strove madly together on the sand, and then
  my husband lifted the man up with both hands, and dashed him down violently
  upon his back, where he lay stunned and motionless beside the man with the
  broken jaw. But yet, after his passion was over, Will tended each of them as
  he would have tended a sick child, and in the morning, as we prepared to get
  into the boat again, John Butcher came to him and held out his hand. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Bryant,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us be friends. You are a better
  man than any of us, and though I fear no man under the sun, yet, for the sake
  of these poor children, and Mary your wife, I ask pardon for my words of last
  night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a short, square-built, and muscular man, with a face as dark as a Portugal,
  but his voice shook like a woman&rsquo;s when Will grasped his hand, and said
  in a choking voice, &ldquo;And I ask pardon of you, John Butcher; for the sake
  of my wife and these poor children, forgive me, comrade, for my roughness.&rdquo; And
  with that they shook hands all round, and swore to be true to Will as long
  as God gave them strength to pull an oar. </p>
<p>In two or three days more we noticed that the sea began to get much smoother
  and assume a light greenish colour, and Butcher said that we had now got under
  the lee of the great Labyrinth Reef, (The Great Barrier Reef) which Lieutenant
  Cook had discovered, and henceforth we should have smoother seas till we reached
  Timor. And so it proved; yet from this time we encountered many heavy gales
  from the south-east, and had to seek shelter on shore very often. </p>
<p>Between the latitudes of 23&deg; and 24&deg; we were driven by a strong current
  thirty leagues from shore, among some islands and reefs, where the boat was
  almost swamped and lost with us all. It was nearly dark at the time, and a
  squall of wind and rain struck us suddenly with great violence, and although
  we had the sail reefed, and Butcher laid the boat to the wind, the rest of
  the men, except Will, cried out that our time was come, for we saw that we
  were come into a network of reefs, upon which the sea beat with awful fury.
  We tried to go about, but the boat would not stay, and there was not room to
  wear. It was then that John Butcher showed his courage and seamanship. In the
  midst of the bursting roar of the breakers and whistling wind, and fierce,
  stinging rain, his voice sounded as calm and cool as it ever did. </p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis our only chance, Will, we must let go the anchor, and try
  and club-haul her; the water is shallow enough.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And by God&rsquo;s mercy the plan answered, though as we went off on the larboard
  tack, a sea half filled the boat, and drenched myself and the poor infants
  to the skin. But though we had lost our anchor we had saved our lives, and
  after keeping the boat nearly with head to the wind for an hour, we found ourselves
  in smooth water, under the lee of a great curving reef, with clear water to
  leeward. Towards daylight the tide ebbed, and the boat grounded on a bottom
  of broken coral and sand; and when the sun rose we saw that on the larboard
  hand, were numerous small, but pleasant-looking islands which, when he could
  look at the chart, Butcher said were the Cumberland Islands. Exhausted as we
  were, we put out the oars and soon rowed into a little white and sandy beach,
  where, to our great joy, we found large numbers of turtle. We remained here
  for some days, for there were no traces of savages, and dried the flesh of
  many turtle, so much that this addition to our store lasted us for ten days. </p>
<p>From this time out we passed through many clusters of islands and networks
  of reefs, till we came to Whit-Sunday Pass, where we landed, and thought to
  rest a while on a thickly wooded island, but found it to be swarming with very
  savage Indians, who assailed the boat with volleys of javelins, and uttered
  the most dreadful cries of rage against us, so that, wearied and thirsty as
  we were &mdash; for our water had run out &mdash; we pushed off again hastily,
  and pursued our course. </p>
<p>All the next two days we sailed past close to the mainland, which is for the
  most part hereabout low and densely wooded, and with shallow, muddy foreshores.
  On the afternoon of the fifth day our boat sailed past Magnetical Island, but
  though the place looked very inviting, we dared not land, seeing the smoke
  of the savages&rsquo; fires ascending from the beaches in various places. Fortunately
  we had experienced much rain on the previous day, and had filled our small
  cask; only for this we should have dared the javelins of the savages. </p>
<p>The wind fell light that night, and when daylight broke, had almost died away;
  so we put out the oars, and rowed towards a cluster of fertile-looking islands,
  distant about two leagues, and which Butcher said were called the Palm Islands.
  And here we landed on a fair white beach, with pleasant hills in the background;
  and here it was that my eldest child, my boy Emanuel, gave his innocent soul
  to God. </p>
<p>For many days before, Will and I had seen that the grey shadows of death were
  clouding the once bright face and sweet blue eyes of our boy, and oft at night,
  when our boat sped silently along under the starlit sky, I would sit holding
  his slight, wasted form in my arms, and my tears of repentance for my mad and
  cruel folly would fall upon his pinched and death-like features. And, as if
  the dear child knew what it was that so racked my wicked heart, he would sometimes
  open his fast-fading eyes, and his little hand would seek mine, and give it
  a faint pressure, and then the white lids would droop and close again. Almost
  as the boat touched the sand, the small, tender form trembled gently in my
  arms, his eyes met mine for the last time in this world, and with a sigh that
  stabbed me to the heart, he died. </p>
<p>Only that God in His mercy had yet spared to me my baby, I think that I, too,
  should have died on those lonely islands, for when I saw the little body of
  my boy placed in his sandy grave, with his small white hands crossed upon his
  innocent bosom, my reason left me, and I called upon God to strike me dead
  for the heavy sin I had done in sacrificing my first-born child. </p>
<p>How long we stayed on this island, which will be sacred to me till my death,
  I cannot tell; but I remember that even the roughest and most hardened of the
  men treated me very tenderly, and even wild, reckless John Butcher took my
  baby in his arms and pressed its face to his, and a tear stole down his dark
  and rugged cheek. </p>
<p>We left the isle at about the time of sunset, and as we sailed slowly away
  from the snow-white beach into the darkness, Will, who steered, put the tiller
  into my hand, and, covering his face, gave a great heart-breaking sob.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter32"></a>Chapter 32</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">The Fugitives Pass Through Many Terrible Dangers
  And Arrive At Coupang In The Dutch East Indies </p>
<p>As we sailed northward towards the Straits of Endeavour, the rainy weather
  that had attended us for so long in a great measure ceased, and the sun beat
  down upon us with painful fierceness. At this stage of our journey the long
  line of reef that we had had on our right hand for so many hundreds of miles
  now began to run closer to the mainland, and we passed through vast numbers
  of small islands, the most of them very low and sandy and covered with a dense
  verdure of shrubs; others were of greater size and had high trees upon them.
  Although the wind blew very strongly from the south and east, the sea was very
  smooth, for the great reef that was now only a few leagues distant proved an
  excellent barrier to the violence of the ocean waves. The coast hereabout was
  for the most part long stretches of beach, with dense forests behind it and
  a range of very high mountains further inland. </p>
<p>We seldom ventured to land on the mainland now, for the Indians were very
  numerous, and at night time we could see their fires at frequent intervals
  all along the beaches, and on the summit of the headlands. The navigation,
  too, was very difficult, so at night time we generally put ashore on one of
  the small, sandy islets, and choosing a spot sheltered from the wind, passed
  the night in some degree of comfort; though even here there was danger from
  the savages, who resorted to these places for fishing, as we often met them
  crossing to and fro between these islands and the mainland in small canoes. </p>
<p>On one occasion, though, when we were come to Cape Flattery, we had to land
  on the mainland to seek for water, which Butcher said we would find there;
  and here we had like to all have perished miserably by the savages. We had
  found the water, and were ready to put off again, when the tide ebbed and the
  boat grounded, and then great numbers of Indians appeared on some rocks that
  jutted down on to the beach near us and assailed us with stones and javelins.
  Many of their javelins came into the boat and stuck into her timbers, but by
  God&rsquo;s mercy none of us was struck, and we all, except myself, got out
  into the sea and so lightened the boat that we were able to drag her out into
  deeper water, and so escape. When we were getting our water at this place we
  saw many serpents about the beach and rocks, and even on the sea we met with
  them constantly swimming about. </p>
<p>But Butcher told us that these water serpents were not venomous, and were
  indeed but a scaly eel, yet they had a very horrible appearance. On the beaches,
  and about the muddy shores of the mainland, there were also visible many huge
  crocodiles lying basking in the sun. </p>
<p>When we had come close to Cape Weymouth, we saw from the boat that there appeared
  to be water trickling down the face of some reddish-coloured rocks, and so,
  the landing looking easy of accomplishment, and there being no signs of Indians,
  Will put ashore at the end of the beach near the rocks, where we found water
  collected in small, rocky pools at the foot of the cliffs, but no stream or
  river. All along this beach we found great piles of large, curved bones, built
  up in the shape of mounds. What the animal was that these bones came from we
  could not tell; but it was easy to see that the mounds had been placed there
  by the savages, for on the tops of some of them were the shells of very large
  turtles. We spent the earlier part of the day resting at this place, and began
  our voyage at noon. To avoid the strong current we kept in close to the shore,
  and while sailing along we passed numbers of sea-cows feeding on the shallows;
  but having no weapon of any sort, could not kill one to replenish our now exhausted
  stock of food. </p>
<p>We made good progress until we reached Cape Granville, where, although we
  saw many signs of Indians about, we were forced to land for water and search
  for food. My baby now began to ail for want of strengthening food; so while
  four of our party remained with me in the boat, which we moored within a short
  distance of the shore, the others set out to search for turtle and shellfish.
  In a few hours they returned with a great quantity of gar-fish, which they
  had caught in a shallow pool, and James Cox brought with him a number of young,
  unfledged birds, which he had taken from their parents&rsquo; nests in the
  woods. These we made a broth from by kindling a fire and heating stones, which
  were dropped into a tiny pool in the rocks. By doing this several times, the
  young birds, which had been cut in pieces, were boiled, and some of the broth,
  which was very strong and nutritious, was given to my infant, a spoonful at
  a time. To my great joy little Charlotte drank it eagerly and soon began to
  mend, and so we saved all that was left for her, and put it in a gourd which
  we had found on the beach at Cape Weymouth. As for the flesh of the young birds,
  we ate that ourselves, and then it came out from Cox that he had eaten a number
  of them raw in the woods. This so angered Will and Butcher that Cox sprang
  to his feet in fear and ran back into the woods. We thought he had deserted
  us, but in half an hour he came back stripped to the waist and carrying something
  heavy in his shirt, which was tied at the sleeves and neck so as to form a
  bag. Casting it down on the rocks beside us, we perceived that it was filled
  with dead birds, both young and old, the last about the size of a gull. He
  told us that when he had first found the birds his hunger had so overpowered
  him that he ate ravenously of nearly twenty, and that he had meant to tell
  us that there were many more in the same place after we had eaten those we
  had boiled; whereupon we forgave him. Cox, Will, and myself now set to and
  plucked many of the birds, which we cooked by hot stones in a large, round
  hole in the rock, filled with water, and we all ate most heartily again. Later
  on two of the men set out again for more, and found a great rookery of many
  thousands of these birds just over the brow of the hill. They caught and killed
  nearly three hundred of the old birds, for the poor things would not desert
  their offspring. </p>
<p>At this place also we saw many herds of sea-cows feeding in the shallows between
  some sand-spits, but could not kill any. However, we drew the seine and caught
  a vast quantity of fish. These we split and hung up to dry in the wind and
  sun; and although we feared a visit from the Indians, Will decided to remain
  at this spot for another day or two, as my baby was gaining strength every
  hour through the broth that we gave her every now and then. </p>
<p>On the third day at sunrise, with a great store of dried fish and half-cooked
  birds, we began our voyage again, and at dusk Will bore up for a small island
  distant about five miles from the main, for we feared to sail on at night by
  reason of the darkness and many reefs. Here, to our great joy, we found a number
  of turtle and caught five; two of these were of so great a size that each took
  the strength of four men to lift it. That night it blew very hard, and we had
  to unload the boat and haul her up on the beach. We then crept into the centre
  of the thicket on the island, and so passed the night. At daylight we found
  that many turtle had been ashore during the night, and laid a vast number of
  eggs; so many, indeed, that the shell of the largest turtle we had caught could
  not hold them all. I beat up the yolks of some of the eggs and gave this mixture
  to little Charlotte, who drank it with great relish. We got away by noon from
  here. </p>
<p>We were now close to the Straits of Endeavour, and so thickly was our way
  studded with islets, reefs, and shoals, that we had always to land at night
  and wait for daylight. Sometimes we suffered severely from the swarms, of mosquitoes
  which were very numerous, and would not even be driven away by smoke. </p>
<p>Just before we rounded York Cape, which is the last headland on the coast
  of New South Wales, we landed on the mainland for water and filled our casks
  at a large fresh-water river, and here some of our party suffered great bodily
  agony by touching the leaves of a tree. It seems that Nathaniel Lilley, James
  Cox, and William Morton spied, walking about in a thicket, a great bird covered
  with black hair and with a horned head, and thinking to catch it, they all
  three gave chase. In about half an hour they returned in great agony, and said
  that in chasing the bird they had brushed against the leaves of trees with
  large, glossy leaves, very beautiful and harmless to look at, but wherever
  these leaves had touched their skins they soon began to feel as if red-hot
  irons had seared their flesh. Indeed, they were in such dreadful pain that
  night that Lilley was quite out of his senses, and the others almost as bad;
  and the pains continued for a long time after. </p>
<p>We rounded York Cape with a strong wind from the E.S.E., and brought to for
  the night in a little bay on the western side, so as to stow our boat better
  for the voyage across the open sea to Timor, which Butcher said was nearly
  straight to the westward from York Cape. </p>
<p>That night we rowed the boat to a sandbank some distance from the shore, for
  we saw many Indians armed with spears watching us from the mainland. There
  was much driftwood on the sandbank, and we lit a fire, and then, after we had
  eaten our evening meal of dried flesh and drank our allowance of water, Butcher
  and Will spread out the Dutchman&rsquo;s chart on the sand. We all gathered
  round in silence, and then when Butcher showed us the vast open space of ocean
  we had yet to pass over before we reached Timor, our hearts sank within us.
  But Will and Butcher cheered us up by telling us that although three hundred
  leagues was a long way, yet, as we should not have many places to touch at,
  we should reach Timor all the sooner. So with that we were content, though
  that night none of us slept; for we could hear the savages making a great outcry
  on the mainland, and feared they might come off in canoes and attack us. </p>
<p>It was in Will and Butcher&rsquo;s minds for us to steer due west for Timor,
  but for the fear that if we met with foul winds our water might give out; so
  instead of this we steered west and by south, so as to cross a great gulf shown
  on the chart, touched on the coast of New Holland again to replenish our provisions
  and water, and then steered a north-westerly course to Timor. </p>
<p>I will not here tell of all our further sufferings, but The Gulf of Carpentaria
  will bring the account of our voyage to an end. We crossed the gulf safely
  and found abundance of turtle, fish, and water on the coast on the other side,
  which we followed, I think, for about fourteen or fifteen days before we finally
  left it. This part of New Holland is truly a dreadful country, for all the
  shores are muddy and full of crocodiles, and the woods infested with serpents;
  and though we saw but few Indians here, we were often chased by a new race
  of savages, in large canoes, fitted with sails and great fighting stages, and
  sometimes holding thirty men in each. These we escaped by rowing hard to windward,
  and so with such adventures, and with my poor Will suffering from a malignant
  fever, which came upon him the day we left the coast, and my little Charlotte
  ailing from want of nourishment, we at last reached Coupang, the name of the
  Dutch settlement at Timor, more dead than alive. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter33"></a>Chapter 33</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">A Very Heavy Punishment Is Meted Out To Mary,
  And The Fugitives Again Become Prisoners </p>
<p>We reached Coupang on the fifth of June, and landed there in the afternoon.
  There was a great assemblage of both white and black people to see us land,
  and I have no doubt but that our appearance was very strange and deplorable.
  The skins of nearly every one of us were burnt to a dark-brown colour, and
  Butcher, Lilley, and William Morton looked more like wild animals than human
  beings. As for me, I was very weak, and could scarcely hold my little Charlotte
  in my arms, and poor Will, who was now suffering terribly from the fever and
  violent shivering fits, which came on him every few hours, had to be carried
  out of the boat. </p>
<p>As soon as we were landed, the Dutch people were very kind to us, and we gave
  out that our party were the survivors of an English vessel wrecked on her way
  to Port Jackson from the coast of America, and also added, which was true enough,
  that we had been in the boat for ten weeks all but one day. Butcher, we said,
  was one of the officers, and Will and I were passengers. </p>
<p>The Dutch Governor, Timotheus Wangon, Esquire, treated us all very well, and
  sent a doctor to attend upon Will. He also sent an Indian woman to attend upon
  me and little Charlotte, and provided me with some wine and a baked fowl for
  my immediate wants; the rest of the men were also given good food, and a change
  of clothes was brought to each by a Dutch soldier. </p>
<p>Perhaps all would have gone well with us after all, but, after we had been
  at Coupang nearly three months, Butcher and Morton and John Simms, who were
  lodged in a house near the soldiers&rsquo; quarters, were one night talking
  over our escape, and by-and-by, their tongues being loosened by some drams
  of an ardent spirit given to them by one of the soldiers, they got careless
  and talked very loudly. Presently there came outside the house a Dutch merchant
  captain and a Dutch trader from Ternate, who, it seems, both spoke English,
  and had come to visit the shipwrecked English sailors out of curiosity. But
  these two had heard a word or two fall from Butcher which made them wait outside
  and listen for more, and they soon heard enough to convince them that we were
  escaped convicts from Botany Bay. So away they went to the Governor and told
  him. </p>
<p>This happened on the twenty-ninth of August, and, strange to say, it was on
  that very day that there reached Coupang, Captain Edwards and the crew of the
  <i>Pandora</i>, a King&rsquo;s ship which had been cast away on the coast of New Holland.
  Among them were also some prisoners, part of the mutineer crew of Lieutenant
  Bligh&rsquo;s ship. It seems that when Mr. Bligh had reached England, the Government
  had sent out the <i>Pandora</i> to search for these mutineers, and they had been found
  and seized at an island in the South Seas. Three or four of them had perished
  miserably in their irons when the <i>Pandora</i> went down, the rest were brought
  to Coupang. As soon as Captain Edwards heard the story of the Dutch Governor
  about us being suspected as escaped convicts, he got Mr. Wangon to have us
  seized, and in a very brief time we were all, save myself, seized, heavily
  ironed, and cast into prison with the men from the Bounty. </p>
<p>Poor Will, who was still in a very weak state, only had time to kiss me and
  little Charlotte farewell, when he was torn from me, and taken with the others,
  and I, distracted woman that I was, was put into a prison apart from him. </p>
<p>In a few days the King&rsquo;s officer chartered a ship belonging to the Dutch
  East India Company and named the <i>Homwey</i>, to take us with his ship&rsquo;s company,
  and the other prisoners, to Batavia, from where he hoped to get another ship
  to take us to the Cape of Good Hope. </p>
<p>And so, once more with clanking irons upon their fettered limbs, my unfortunate
  companions in misery were placed on board the Dutch ship. I was not placed
  in irons myself by that stern and cruel King&rsquo;s officer, but with my child
  in my arms was allowed to sit down on the main deck of the ship, so that I
  was at least near my dear husband. The Dutch sailors were kind to me, and one
  managed to get the sentry over us to turn away his head while he slipped a
  bottle of milk into my hand for little Charlotte, who could not understand
  why her father sat there with his face bowed upon his knees, and tried to crawl
  over to him. </p>
<p>To me that voyage in the Hornwey was a very dreadful one. I could see that
  my husband was dying before my eyes, and yet could not even go near him to
  pillow his weary head upon my breast, for the sentry had orders not to let
  me speak to any of my companions &mdash; no, not even my own dear Will. </p>
<p>One night the Hornwey lay becalmed. It was very dark and hot, and even in
  the open air we poor prisoners could scarce breathe. There was not a sound
  to be heard, save the grating of the prisoners irons upon the deck when they
  moved their aching limbs. Presently I saw James Cox, who had been very quiet
  and sad all day, rise upon his knees, and moving very gently so that the sentry
  could not hear him, crawl up to Will and whisper a word or two in his ear,
  and their manacled hands met for a minute. Then looking round to where I lay
  upon a grating, he beckoned me to him. I crept over, carrying my baby with
  me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress Bryant,&rdquo; said he in a whisper, &ldquo;give me your hand.
  I shall be a dead man before morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, James,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;see how my poor
  Will bears up, ill as he is.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistress Bryant, &rsquo;tis better for us all to die as soon as we
  can. But give me your hand, good woman, and hush! make no noise, but give me
  the brat to kiss.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I held my sleeping baby&rsquo;s face to his, and he pressed his lips to her
  forehead, and then he suddenly raised himself erect, and, his chains making
  a great noise, clambered to the ship&rsquo;s side and sprang overboard. May
  God forgive me his death! </p>
<p>There was a great outcry made, but, of course, the poor man had sunk like
  a stone; so no boat was lowered. But that the others might not follow his example,
  they were chained to ringbolts in the deck. That night a very furious storm
  burst upon us with terrible rain, and in the morning William Morton lay dead
  and stiff in his irons. He was never a very strong man, and the sufferings
  he had undergone in the boat had quite broken his health, even as it had Will&rsquo;s.
  And soon after, John Simms followed him. He died very quietly, and, indeed,
  we did not know he was dead till the sentry called to him to look up, as Captain
  Edwards was coming. But the man made no answer, and Will, who was next to him,
  said to the sentry in a weak voice,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t look up&mdash;not even for a King&rsquo;s officer &mdash; he
  has just breathed his last.&rdquo; </p>
<p>At last we reached Batavia, and here I was to feel that God&rsquo;s hand is
  indeed heavy to those who sin as I have sinned. </p>
<p>Will was now so weak that even our stern superiors took pity on him, and he
  was sent to the soldiers&rsquo; hospital, where I was allowed to go with him.
  It was a long, narrow building with a thatched roof, and though the furnishing
  was very poor, it was yet neat and clean. He was placed upon a pallet, and
  a Dutch doctor, who spoke some English, came and looked at him. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you his wife?&rdquo; he said to me kindly, and he motioned me to
  bring a wooden stool and sit near the bed. Then he whispered to me that he
  would not last long. </p>
<p>I did not think that Will had heard him, but he did, for his poor, wasted
  hand sought mine, and he spoke. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, my girl . . . God keep you, for I shall soon be gone. &rsquo;Tis
  hard to die thus, dear wife . . . to leave you and the little one.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I sought to answer him through my tears, and bending down kissed his lips,
  and in his dear eyes I saw that the dark shadows of death were gathering fast,
  and that his breath came very slowly after each word he spoke.</p>
<p>At the foot of the bed stood a Dutch sergeant who, at a sign from the doctor,
  placed a cup of wine to his lips. He drank and then lay back again, but his
  eyes turned to me so piteously, that as I held his hand in mine I could not
  see his face for my tears. He pressed my hand tenderly, and then turning to
  the doctor begged to be allowed to see little Charlotte, whom I had not been
  permitted to bring into the hospital. </p>
<p>The good doctor nodded to the sergeant, and the soldier went out and brought
  in an Indian wench who carried the child in her arms. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, my wife, come here, dear one,&rdquo; said Will to me, and he
  tried to smile; &ldquo;place the little one in my arms,&rdquo; but even as
  he spoke, and I gave the infant into his weak arms, the tears of her father
  gathered in his eyes and ran down his cheeks. For a moment or so he lay quiet
  with the child&rsquo;s cheek pressed to his, and his gaunt, bony arms clasped
  gently round her little body. Then, with one last look of love for me, he gave
  a heavy sigh and died. </p>
<p>And so God punished me. </p>
<p>The next day Captain Edwards hired the <i>Rambang</i>, a Dutch vessel, which brought
  us to the Cape of Good Hope. </p>
<p>And so we wretched ones who remain were brought on board this ship, and now,
  all I ask is that when we reach England, and my just punishment by the laws
  of man shall begin, that my remaining infant may be cared for and preserved
  from such a fate as has befallen me. I ask, too, that those of my companions
  who remain may be dealt with mercifully, since &rsquo;twas I, and I alone,
  who have brought them to this sad pass.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 34</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">I Arrive In England </p>
<p>This was Mary Bryant&rsquo;s story, and it is told to you almost in her own
  words. Her petition that her infant daughter might be saved from the prison
  taint that she knew was awaiting her, was altered before this statement was
  handed to the Home Authorities, for the child Charlotte died at sea on the
  sixth of May, and we consigned her tiny form to the deep. </p>
<p>From that day we saw little of Mary, who was too ill even to come upon deck
  and take the fresh air. The remainder of the voyage was without interest, and
  the <i>Gorgon</i> arrived at Chatham on June the nineteenth, 1792, and once more I
  was back in my native land. </p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas a sad sight to us to see the prisoners passed over the side of
  the ship on that memorable day of our arrival. First there were the miserable
  persons who had taken part in the mutiny of the Bounty, most of them, as they
  left the ship, never hoping, for a moment, that anything but death awaited
  them, though I am glad to say young Heywood, the youngest of them all, escaped,
  and afterwards served with great distinction on a King&rsquo;s ship.</p>
<p>Then the survivors of the Bryant party were taken in charge by the Bow Street
  officers, to be conveyed to London. Mary gave one look behind at the Marines,
  who were drawn up on the quarter-deck for inspection before disembarking. </p>
<p>She caught sight of Lieutenant Fairfax and myself, and waved to us a sad farewell,
  and though the discipline of the Service is very strict, I could not help waving
  my hand from where I stood, on the right flank of my company, and as I did
  so I saw Major Ross look at me as if in wonder why so steady a man could so
  far forget himself as to signal to a convict from the ranks. But he said nothing,
  this being so great an occasion, and perhaps he had caught sight of Lieutenant
  Fairfax, who lowered the point of his sword ever so little, but still enough
  for Mary to see that he intended this signal of farewell for her. </p>
<p>As soon as we were landed we were marched off to the depot at Chatham, and
  after a few days we, who returned from Port Jackson, were granted a long furlough,
  and joyously departed for our homes. </p>
<p>Lieutenant Fairfax sent for me the last thing before I left, and said he,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Dew, I cannot, I am sorry to say, return with you by the coach
  to Portsmouth; but remember this, when you get back to dear old Solcombe&mdash;that
  is, if you&rsquo;ve a mind to it, and have had enough of the Service &mdash; when
  I leave London it will be for good, and I will bring with me your discharge.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I was overjoyed to hear my good patron had not forgotten his promise, and
  I thanked him heartily. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell my sister when you give her this letter,&rdquo; went on the lieutenant,
  handing me a bulky package, &ldquo;that I am going to remain in London until
  I can get clear of the Service, and while I am there I shall leave no stone
  unturned to soften the lot of her former maid, Mary Bryant.&rdquo; Here he
  turned his face away from me for a moment. &ldquo;Now be off with you and get
  all in readiness to turn farmer, for there is no more pipeclay for either of
  us.&rdquo; </p>
<p>When I reached Portsmouth in the coach, I purchased a newspaper to take over
  to my father at the island. For I had seen by the advertisement outside of
  the printing-house, as we drove up in the coach, that it contained a publication
  which the printers entitled, &ldquo;Strange Story of an Escape from Botany
  Bay.&rdquo; </p>
<p>So I bought a copy of the Hampshire Chronicle and Portsmouth and Chichester
  Journal, and there I read, with much emotion, a full account of Mary&rsquo;s
  appearance at Bow Street Police Court in London. </p>
<p>It set forth that on Saturday last, which was the fifteenth of July, Sir Sampson
  Wright&rsquo;s officers brought up at the Police Court five prisoners from
  His Majesty&rsquo;s frigate <i>Gorgon</i>, and then with many errors, such as newspapers
  so often contain, it related the story of the Bryants&rsquo; escape. The person
  who reported the matter wrote, &mdash; &ldquo;It was remarked by everyone present,
  and by the magistrate, that they never saw people who bore stronger marks of
  a sincere repentance, and all joined in the wish that their past sufferings
  may be considered as a sufficient expiation of their crimes. They all declared
  that they would sooner suffer death than return to Botany Bay. They were committed
  to Newgate.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter35"></a>Chapter 35</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Affairs At Solcombe </p>
<p>Before I left Chatham, I had received a letter from your Aunt Dorothy, telling
  me that she had been wedded to that honest yeoman, your Uncle John, just about
  the time that we were leaving the Cape of Good Hope in the <i>Gorgon</i>. </p>
<p>She had tried to persuade her husband to postpone the happy event until my
  return to England, that I might dance at the wedding, but he would not listen
  to this, &ldquo;for,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;the <i>Gorgon</i> took long enough getting
  to Botany Bay to fetch your brother, and if we wait until she returns with
  him, we may be too old for thoughts of marriage before he gets to England&rdquo;;
  and, indeed, he spoke most sensibly. </p>
<p>And so they were married, and your aunt went away to live at her new home
  on the other side of the island, and my father was left to the care of the
  woman who helped in the household. </p>
<p>Alas! my home-coming was not so joyful as I had anticipated, for when I landed
  on Ryde beach from the Portsmouth wherry, a waterman, who was lounging about,
  came up to me and said,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, you, soldier, ain&rsquo;t you young Sergeant Dew from Botany
  Bay?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am that man,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page249.jpg" width="563" height="750"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t remember me, but I am
  a near neighbour of yours over by Solcombe, and they are looking forward anxiously
  for you to come back. Your old father is very ill, and I am afraid you won&rsquo;t
  see him alive.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And so, on hearing this sad news I hastened away, and getting into a farmer&rsquo;s
  cart that was going that way, without waiting for the carrier, I got as far
  as Newport, and from there walked to my home. </p>
<p>Sure enough, I found your aunt and uncle and the doctor, and all of them around
  the bedside of my father, who, after recovering consciousness, and giving me
  his blessing and forgiveness for all the anxiety I had caused him, closed his
  eyes for ever, and left me the lonely master of our little farm. </p>
<p>I did all things decently, and buried your grandfather in the parish churchyard,
  following his remains in my scarlet tunic with a crape band round my arm, the
  neighbours, who followed from the country side for a long way round, all staring
  at me, and some of them, no doubt, pointing me out as an example of a young
  man who had been a rolling stone. Miss Charlotte Fairfax sent her chaise to
  follow at the funeral, and I felt the honour very much. </p>
<p>I had sent her brother&rsquo;s letter to her with my best respects, and told
  her of my father&rsquo;s illness, and that, as soon as I could leave him, I
  would present my duty, and begged to be granted an interview. </p>
<p>She very graciously replied that I was to suit my own time and convenience,
  and now that all was over, I resolved to call upon her. </p>
<p>Accordingly, one day I walked over to the Manor, and was shown into the drawing-room. </p>
<p>Miss Fairfax lived all alone, managing the estate for her brother, with the
  aid of a bailiff, and an old lady lived with her as a sort of companion and
  housekeeper. </p>
<p>I found Mary&rsquo;s mistress very little altered in appearance, and, as I
  have told you, she was a great beauty; but she was much sobered in her manner,
  and had the air and conversation of a much older woman. </p>
<p>She was very gracious to me, and addressed me as Mr. Dew. After her first
  greeting, said she:  &mdash; &ldquo;But, Mr. Dew, why do you appear thus in
  your uniform? It becomes you mightily, but, goodness me, we are not at war
  in the island, Heaven be thanked.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, Miss Fairfax,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;the humbler
  ranks of the military, and the Marines also, are allowed no other dress; and,
  indeed, madam, I have no other clothes but these.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then,&rdquo;  and she smiled most prettily, &ldquo;you have not
  heard from my brother. He tells me, Mr. Dew, in a letter which was delivered
  to me only to-day, that he himself is now released from the King&rsquo;s Service,
  and he has also procured your discharge from the Marines.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I was mightily pleased to hear this, as you may be sure, and so I said, and
  expressed my gratitude. </p>
<p>Then Miss Fairfax, who seemed to grow more beautiful every minute, requested
  me to tell her of the strange adventures of the Bryants; and so I told their
  story as you have heard it, and her eyes filled with tears, and then the tender-hearted
  lady turned her face from me and wept softly to herself a while. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page251.jpg" width="545" height="750"></p>
<p>When she had recovered herself, and dried her pretty eyes, she was so condescending
  as to make me stay and take a dish of tea with her and her old-lady companion
  in the drawing-room; and I felt myself a very high and important person, I
  can tell you, as I walked away home to begin life as a tenant farmer on my
  small estate, and one of the principal persons in our neighbourhood.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter36"></a>Chapter 36</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Mr. Fairfax Pays A Flying Visit, And John Butcher
  Sends In A Petition </p>
<p>You may depend upon it that I was well pleased, on getting back to my farm,
  to receive a letter from my old master, enclosing in it my formal discharge
  from the Service. In this letter he told me that he was working hard to obtain
  mercy for poor Mary and the unhappy survivors of the boat voyage. He also wrote
  that he would not be back in Solcombe for some time to come, as he had many
  things to attend to in London. Then he asked me to give his sister a helping
  hand with the Solcombe estate, as she, being a lone woman dependent upon a
  bailiff, would be glad of my advice. Of course, I was proud and pleased at
  this commission, and in consequence of it I was very often at the Manor, and
  Miss Fairfax was so good as to make much use of me; and, indeed, treated me
  as if I had been in all ways her equal. </p>
<p>Two or three months passed like this, and then we had a flying visit from
  Mr. Fairfax. Miss Charlotte had reproached him for not coming to see her, and
  he took coach and boat, and came down to the island quite unexpectedly. After
  a few hours spent with his sister, he was so good as to walk over to my farm. </p>
<p>I thanked him very heartily for remembering his old servant in the way he
  had done, and enabling me to settle down and become a respected man again.
  In reply to my words, he said, &ldquo;Now, Dew, once for all let us drop this
  master and servant business. I have become an extreme Whig, and hope to sit
  for the island yet as such. I believe all men and women are equal so far as
  position goes; it is honesty and that alone which should rank us; and now that
  both of us have left the Service, let us drop it. I think you are as good a
  man as I am, and Mary Bryant is as good a woman as my sister is. What do you
  think of that now?&rdquo; </p>
<p>This shocked me very much, and so I ventured on the liberty of saying that
  such sentiments did more honour to his heart than to his head. &ldquo;Why,
  sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is bad enough to make the servant equal to the
  master, but to compare Miss Fairfax with her maid &mdash; a convicted &mdash; &rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Dew,&rdquo; he replied, in the old way, &ldquo;let me
  hear no more of such talk. I am afraid you will always be a fool in some ways.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then he went on to tell me that he had taken up his residence for a time,
  at least, in London, and he was working hard to obtain Mary&rsquo;s release,
  and hoped to do so before very long. Meanwhile, I was to look well after his
  sister and help her all I could. &ldquo;For, look you, Dew,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she
  will want all your assistance, because I don&rsquo;t like farming, and will
  have nothing to do with it, and so I have told her.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;This will make her very unhappy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for, to be sure,
  she must have looked forward to your homecoming, to take your place among the
  island gentry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, she is quite happy, and likes the idea of having you about
  to advise her. Good-bye,&rdquo; and with a hearty hand-shake my old master
  walked off, leaving me somewhat dazed at the strange sentiments he had expressed. </p>
<p>A few weeks after this I got a copy of the Portsmouth paper, and in it I read
  that all the prisoners, except Mary Bryant and Butcher, had been sent to complete
  their sentences, but Mary Bryant&rsquo;s case was still under consideration.
  The following letter was also published in this paper from Butcher: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;John Butcher to the
  Right Hon. Henry Dundas<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Newgate,
  23d January, 1793</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;May it please Your Honour, &mdash; It ill becomes a person,
  in the low sphere I move in, to address a person of your exalted character,
  nor should I have presumed to take the liberty but for the following reason: &mdash; Having
  been brought up in the thorough knowledge of all kinds of land, and capable
  of bringing indifferent lands to perfection, I had an offer some time ago to
  go to Botany Bay, to endeavour to make that land more fertile than it has ever
  appeared to be. I submit the following list to your honour&rsquo;s perusal
  of what is necessary seed, and what has been tried and found not to answer
  the expectations formed of them. Two sorts of English wheat; barley, rye, and
  beans, one sort; grass is a good production, as likewise Indian corn; and some
  of the land will produce tobacco, and all sorts of garden stuff, with proper
  instructions. But according to the manner in which they till the ground at
  present, they will bring nothing to perfection, owing to the different sorts
  of land in the island, which they are entirely ignorant of; and I flatter myself,
  from what I have seen of the island, that I could render it a great deal more
  productive, and, in a few years, could save the Government a great expense
  in provisions for the colony. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Although I have suffered a great deal in going and coming
  from Botany Bay, yet I am willing to go back again on proper terms, as I am
  certain I can be of very great service to the island in what I profess, and
  if your honour should think me worthy of the situation, I am willing to place
  myself, and I will be bound to perform everything I undertake, or expect nothing
  for my trouble. I should be humbly thankful to your honour if you would condescend
  to indulge me with an answer, that I may know what I am to expect; you will
  give great ease to the anxious mind of, hon. sir, your humble servant,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;John Butcher.&rdquo;<b></b></p>
<p>I may as well dispose of Butcher at once, by telling you that the petition
  of this man was granted, and he was allowed to enlist in the New South Wales
  Regiment, and was sent back to the settlement. He was, in September, 1795,
  granted 25 acres of land in the Petersham district near Sydney, and became
  a flourishing settler.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter37"></a>Chapter 37</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">I Hear Good News At Last </p>
<p>Time passed on, and more months went by before we&mdash;I mean dear Miss Fairfax
  and myself&mdash;heard anything of her brother, my lieutenant, as I still always
  thought of him, although we had occasional letters from him in which we heard
  that he was a regular visitor to Newgate Prison, and that he had procured many
  indulgences for Mary, who was now quite restored to health, and sent her loving
  duty to her former mistress, and her kind remembrances to myself. </p>
<p>We had news, too, from Port Jackson. Lieutenant King had again taken charge
  of Norfolk Island, and that settlement was flourishing under his wise rule.
  This gentleman was on his way out from England, as we were returning home in
  the <i>Gorgon</i>, and by his personal efforts with the Government during his short
  stay in England, had done a great deal for the new country. Major Ross, my
  old commandant, became recruiting officer at the depot, where, I have no doubt,
  he turned out some good soldiers to serve their King and country; for although
  I cannot say I ever liked so stern and hard a gentleman, yet he was an excellent
  officer&mdash;but yet I was very glad to get away from him.</p>
<p>Governor Phillip, so my lieutenant wrote, left the settlement in the Atlantic
  on the eleventh of December, 1792, and arrived in England in the summer of
  1793, and in July of that year he resigned his post, and Sydney &mdash; for
  so the settlement is now called &mdash; lost the best and bravest gentleman
  that ever stepped foot into it. After he left, two officers of the New South
  Wales Regiment&mdash;which to my mind was a very indifferent body of men when
  compared to my old corps &mdash; in turn became Governors; these were Colonel
  Gore and Captain Patterson, and then, early in 1794, Captain Hunter, with whom
  I had sailed so often, was appointed Governor; but all this is history which
  you can read for yourselves. </p>
<p>As I have said, things went on very much as usual with us at Solcombe, until,
  on the twenty-eighth of May, 1793, I read in the Portsmouth paper this very
  startling piece of news: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;His Majesty has been graciously pleased to grant a free
  pardon to Mary Bryant, who, accompanied by several male convicts, escaped from
  Botany Bay, and traversed upwards of three thousand miles by sea in an open
  boat, exposed to tempestuous weather.&rdquo; </p>
<p>This was joyful news, but in another part of the paper I read something which
  I could have robbed of the mystery which the printer seemed to think surrounded
  it. This is what he wrote: &mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The female convict who made her escape from Botany Bay
  and suffered the greatest hardships during a voyage of three thousand leagues,
  and who was afterwards retaken and condemned to death, has been pardoned and
  released from Newgate. In the story of this woman there is something extremely
  singular. A gentleman of high rank in the Army visited her in Newgate, heard
  the details of her life, and for that time departed. The next day he returned,
  and told the old gentleman who keeps the prison that he had procured her pardon,
  which he showed him, at the same time requesting that she should not be apprised
  of the circumstance. The next day he returned with his carriage, and took off
  the young woman, who almost expired with excess of joy.&rdquo; </p>
<p>You may well imagine that I was pleased enough to read this, although all
  that was printed was not strictly true; but I knew very well that Mary was
  pardoned, and that my master had succeeded, and so I cared nothing for the
  rest. </p>
<p>By the same boat that brought to the island the Portsmouth papers, came letters
  from Mr. Fairfax to his sister and myself, confirming the news of Mary&rsquo;s
  pardon, and telling us that he would soon pay us a visit, and bring us all
  particulars and much that would interest us. </p>
<p>Miss Fairfax was as pleased as myself at hearing the news, and wrote a very
  kind letter, which before sending she read to me, offering to take Mary back
  to her service, and telling her brother that now the goodness of his heart
  had succeeded in procuring Mary&rsquo;s pardon, &rsquo;twas time for him to
  return to the island and settle on his estate, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;although
  Mr. Dew hath been, and is still, of very great service to me, and is most anxious
  to help me all in his power, yet &rsquo;tis cruel that I should be so hard
  upon his time and good-nature. So do you hasten back, my dear brother.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter38"></a>Chapter 38</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Mr. Fairfax Surprises Me Very Much, And I Begin
  To Associate With People Of Quality </p>
<p>Two months had gone by and we had heard nothing more of the lieutenant, save
  from a short note which he had written to Miss Fairfax, telling her not to
  expect him for some weeks. Three weeks had passed since this letter came, and
  both Miss Fairfax and I wondered at hearing nothing further, when one day I
  received a message to say that Mr. Fairfax wanted me at the Manor House. Before
  setting out I spent some little time over my attire, as since I had begun to
  see Miss Fairfax so often, I deemed it proper that I should dress in a more
  befitting manner than that which I had been accustomed to. Indeed, on Mr. Fairfax&rsquo;s
  advice, I had had two suits made in Southampton by his own tailor, and Miss
  Fairfax had told me that they became me very well. I was never a vain man,
  but, of course, I could not help knowing that, as far as looks and build went,
  there were few men in the island to whom Providence had been kinder; and, indeed,
  as I was now in a comfortable position I began to try and improve myself in
  other ways by reading and paying strict attention to my deportment when in
  the society of Miss Fairfax. So, being very handsomely dressed in one of my
  new suits, which had cost each two pounds sterling, I set out, and reaching
  the Manor House was shown into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>There, in the middle of the room, stood my master, holding by the hand Mary,
  who looked so beautiful again that I at first scarce knew her. As I entered
  the room he stepped forward, and still holding Mary by the hand, said,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, friend Dew, come and be introduced to my wife, your old
  acquaintance, Mary.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I was so astonished by this wonderful event being revealed to me in this sudden
  manner, that I stood stock still like a fool and said nothing. Then my old
  master, after waiting a moment, clapped me on my back and said, &ldquo;Come,
  Will Dew, won&rsquo;t you congratulate me?&rdquo; </p>
<p>I really must have lost my senses, for I stood to attention just as in the
  old days, and saluted, and only muttered, as if I were giving the countersign
  on sentry duty,  &ldquo;Yes, sir, I congratulate you.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mr. Fairfax laughed outright at me, and said, &ldquo;Hang me if I don&rsquo;t
  believe you&rsquo;re jealous.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then Mary held out her hand to me, and said she, </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Mr. Dew is very much surprised that his old friend and dear
  master could so have forgotten his rank to take compassion upon poor me, and
  let his pity grow to a love so great that he could make me his wife; and, indeed,
  well may he be astounded at the news.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I had taken her hand and was still silent, looking now in her face and seeing
  therein a look of quiet happiness such as I had never seen before; and now
  I realised that all that she had suffered had not altered her, and she was
  still a beautiful woman, a woman, indeed, that any man might well be proud
  to call his own. </p>
<p>Presently I recovered my wits and began to see that after all, though my rich
  and well-born master had committed what many persons might call a great piece
  of folly, and what I knew showed extraordinary freedom of prejudice on his
  part, yet Mary was, as I had known in the old days, far above the common rustic,
  and she looked and talked like a lady born. </p>
<p>By-and-by we grew more composed, and fell a-talking, and I noticed Miss Fairfax
  was not in the room and did not come in, though we were a long time together;
  and so I asked Mr. Fairfax if his sister had seen Mary. </p>
<p>He took me on one side and said, &mdash; &ldquo;Yes, and there&rsquo;s the
  devil to pay. My sister has sworn never to forgive either of us, and has shut
  herself up in her room, where she swears she will remain until she can get
  another home.&rdquo; </p>
<p>At this I expressed my sorrow that this marriage was to be the means of Miss
  Fairfax leaving the Manor. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will be all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Fairfax. &ldquo;Mary and
  I are going away to London this afternoon, where we shall live for years, and
  my sister will remain here. You see, Dew, I am proud of my wife, but I know
  and she knows, well enough, that all the people about here will not take kindly
  to our marriage at first. You know they have not seen the world as we have,
  and so, like my sister, they will have foolish prejudices, and so we are going
  to live in London for a time. Meanwhile, do you look after my sister and help
  her all you can, and try to overcome her silly objections to my marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I said farewell to them both, and they went away and remained in
  London for some years, until the lieutenant was father of three children, whose
  honoured names you know well enough. </p>
<p>All this time I remained a lonely man at my farm, with no companions save
  the old woman who kept house for me, and occasional visits from my sister and
  her family. Now and then I would spend an evening in the best parlour of the
  inn at Solcombe with the persons of quality who frequented it, for I was now
  a man of substance, all things prospering with me. </p>
<p>I still continued to be invited by Miss Fairfax to the Manor House, and she
  very frequently challenged me to a game of backgammon, and occasionally, accompanied
  by her old-lady companion, she would ask me to escort them for a walk along
  the cliffs. These days were very bright spots in my life, and consoled me greatly
  for the quiet existence I led at the farm.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter39"></a>Chapter 39</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">Miss Fairfax Outdoes Her Brother In Surprising
  Me, And A Very Great And Happy Event Brings My Story To An End </p>
<p>And now, as I draw near to the close of this journal, I find it hard to tell
  you in words that are fitting the last great event of my life. </p>
<p>Although, as I have said, Mr. Fairfax was away in London for a great length
  of time, he did pay us a few flying visits at Solcombe; but did not bring his
  wife with him, although Miss Fairfax had become reconciled to the marriage,
  and all difference between them was at an end. Indeed, although she was of
  a somewhat quick temper, she was very fond of her brother, and he of her; and
  latterly, had often said to me that her brother did right, after all, in marrying
  the woman he loved. It was all the more to her credit that she had quite forgiven
  her brother&rsquo;s marriage, for although she declares that it is not true,
  and that she had no desire to marry, yet both her brother and myself sometimes
  thought that she was over-sensitive about it, and for that reason refused many
  handsome offers she received from the gentlemen who from time to time she became
  acquainted with.</p>
<p>On one of these visits to Solcombe, Mr. Fairfax astonished me even more than
  he had done when he introduced me to his wife. He had come over to my farm
  to spend the evening, and we were chatting over old times and having a glass
  of grog together, when suddenly he opened upon me in this way, &mdash; &ldquo;Look
  here, Dew, I have always known you to be pretty much of a fool, and I&rsquo;ll
  be hanged if I don&rsquo;t think as you grow older you grow worse. Here you
  are leading this miserable, lonely life, and the woman who is willing to marry
  you is doing the same, and so you go on month after month. Meanwhile, the years
  are passing by, and by the time you wake up to the fact (unless she proposes,
  I don&rsquo;t believe you ever will), the pair of you will be too old to make
  it worth while your mating.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what on earth are you driving at, sir?&rdquo; I asked. Even up
  to this time I could not help addressing the lieutenant as &ldquo;sir.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were anything but a fool you would know that she can&rsquo;t
  ask you to marry her, yet she has given you every signal that a woman in love
  can make. She asks your advice on every subject, whether you know anything
  of it or not, and I know &mdash; for you have told me in your letters &mdash; that
  she is always descanting to you on the mistake she made in once supposing that
  it was wrong for two persons to marry if they did not both happen to be born
  in the one station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great heavens, sir! you don&rsquo;t suppose that I could ever so far
  forget myself as to &mdash; to think of marrying with your sister! &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever are you going to forget that infernal humility that, since
  two or three years of service in the Marines, has so persistently stuck to
  you?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, our positions, apart from that, are widely different, and
  your sister, if she knew we were thus discussing her, would forbid me to speak
  to her again.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, our positions are not different. You are one of
  the most prosperous tenant farmers about here; and your father and his father
  came of good yeoman stock. I have an estate from which I derive a very moderate
  income, and my sister is dependent on what I allow her.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment. In the second place, I have told her that you are very
  much in love with her, as I saw long ago, and she has confessed to me that
  if you would only get over your confounded modesty, you would not be indifferent
  to her. Now, sir, what have you to say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, though I confess I have for a long time secretly admired
  Miss Charlotte, I have been most careful to conceal my sentiments, knowing
  too well my duty, and besides, notwithstanding all you say, I can never, pardon
  me for saying it, believe Miss Fairfax thinks of me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Dew; put on your hat and coat this instant.&rdquo; </p>
<p>And then before I realised what was to happen, he had marched me up to the
  Manor House, walked me straight into the drawing-room, where Miss Fairfax was
  sitting up for him, and then in the coolest manner in the world he said to
  her,&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte, I have brought Will Dew up to see you. He has an important
  question to put to you, having first asked my permission, which I gave him
  with all my heart, and now I give the pair of you my blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he shoved me into the room, saying in a whisper, &ldquo;Go in and
  win, you confounded stupid,&rdquo; and then went out and shut the door behind
  him, leaving me standing all confusion in the middle of the room. But when
  I saw the dear lady&rsquo;s sweet face so covered with blushes, my courage
  came and&mdash;well, my children, I soon found my tongue too. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page268.jpg" width="472" height="750"></p>
<p>I have little else to tell you. We were married in old Solcombe church soon
  afterwards, and you children were born to us. What our lives have since been
  you well know, but this story of the early life of your father and his dearest
  friends you had only heard in scraps and patches from myself and your mother
  and your Uncle Fairfax. Now you know it all. Profit by the knowledge, and if
  you would learn the moral of my story, go back to the first page of my diary,
  and there read why I have set these things down in writing.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Postscript"></a>Postscript</b></h2>
<p>Let me re-open this journal and set down a few lines telling of the last years
  of those men whose brave hearts and wise heads so well and truly laid the foundation
  of the new world across the seas. </p>
<p>Our good and gallant Governor, Captain Phillip, before he died became an admiral,
  and up to the day of his death, in the year 1814, was dearly loved by all of
  those about him. In 1808 his old friend and comrade King, well worthy to be
  associated with such a man as Phillip, met the Admiral at Bath, and from that
  place, only a week before his death, King wrote this letter to his son: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;As this letter may reach you before you sail, I write
  to say that I came here merely to see Admiral Phillip, who I found much better
  than I could expect from the reports I had read, although he is quite a cripple,
  having lost the entire use of his right side; but his intellects are very good,
  and his spirits are what they always were.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Your Uncle Fairfax, too, with your mother, had the honour of again meeting
  his old commander during a brief visit that the Admiral made to Portsmouth,
  where he had gone at the desire of the Lords of the Admiralty to look at a
  new King&rsquo;s ship. At this time your Uncle Fairfax and your Aunt Mary were
  also staying at Portsmouth, and your mother, at their desire, went over to
  stay with them a week or two. It so happened that your Uncle Fairfax, hearing
  that the Admiral was staying at the house of a gentleman whom he knew, went
  to see him and took your mother with him, though she remained outside in the
  carriage. Admiral Phillip was greatly pleased to see his former comrade, and
  showed that he had the warmest concern in all those who had served under him.
  Then, too, he even asked Mr. Fairfax what had become of me, and when your uncle
  told him that I was well and prosperous, the old gentleman was pleased to say
  that I was a very careful man and would have made a good sailor, and so, when
  your uncle told him that I had married Miss Fairfax, his sister, and that Mrs.
  Dew was then outside in the carriage, the gallant old officer, putting on his
  laced hat and leaning on your uncle&rsquo;s arm, came out to her and paid her
  many pretty compliments, saying, among other things, that Lieutenant King thought
  very highly of my conduct when the <i>Sirius</i> was wrecked at Norfolk Island.
  Before he bade them farewell he, taking a very handsome seal and chain from
  his fob, desired her to present it to me, &ldquo;as a memento&rdquo; &mdash; these
  were his very words &mdash; &ldquo;of the service we had seen together.&rdquo; I
  need not tell you how dearly I prize this gift, which you see I now wear. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100041h-images/page271.jpg" width="593" height="750"></p>
<p>Of gallant, kind-hearted Hunter I have little to tell, except that, soon after
  his return to England in 1801, he was appointed to the Venerable, seventy-four,
  and when cruising off Torbay got his ship ashore and wrecked in trying to save
  the life of a man who had fallen overboard. He was tried by court-martial and
  acquitted, and in the course of the trial was asked why he had put his ship
  about in such a dangerous place. He replied, &ldquo;I consider the life of
  a British seaman of more value than any ship in His Majesty&rsquo;s Navy.&rdquo; Although
  by such an answer he showed himself more kindly-hearted than worldly-wise,
  he was afterwards promoted to be rear-admiral. </p>
<p>And by such men as these were the settlers in the early days of New South
  Wales governed, and when you hear people, as is often the case now-a-days,
  saying that the prisoners were cruelly treated, just take this journal of mine
  and read this postscript to them, that all may know what manner of men they
  were who founded New South Wales.<b></b></p>
