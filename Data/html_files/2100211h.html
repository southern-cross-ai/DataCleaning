  Some Of His Antics</b></h2>
  <p>ALGY ANT was bobbing up and down, wriggling and giggling. But these antics
    did not please Algy&rsquo;s nurse. She said in a very cross voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Algy, your antics give me the frantics. Now keep still and remember
    what I say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Nursey,&rdquo; said Algy, keeping still for exactly half a second.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now listen to me!&rdquo; said Nurse. You are going out to play&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;oh yes&mdash;oh yes!&rdquo; cried Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, when you go out to play, what is it you must be careful of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Algy thought and thought. &ldquo;First of all I must be careful of that&mdash;that&mdash;er,
    that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Algy, can&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, Nursey, I can remember. I&rsquo;m a very
    good rememberer, I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well then, when you go out to play, what is it you must be careful
    of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First of all, that&mdash;that&mdash;yelling, tramping, stamping two-legged
    creature, called&mdash; called&mdash;<i> joy</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, boy. I must be very careful of boy, cos if he sees me he&rsquo;ll
    most certainly catch me: and if he does catch me he&rsquo;ll prob&rsquo;ly
    pick me up and put me in a box and keep me there for weeks&mdash; and weeks&mdash; and
    weeks&mdash; and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; said Nurse impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weeks&mdash;till I starve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d starve long before then,&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;What
    else must you be careful of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know, Nursey! I know, I know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must be careful of er&mdash;er&mdash;oh yes! that screaming, silly,
    giggling, wriggling one, called&mdash; called&mdash;<i> twirl</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Girl, girl!&rdquo; said Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, girl-girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not girl-girl. Just girl,&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;And what else
    must you be careful of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That big whirring, grinding, slicing, splicing&mdash; <i>corn-blower!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lawn-mower,&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;And, also, the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Herds!</i>&rdquo;  shouted Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not herds, <i>birds</i>,&rdquo;  said Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, birds. A bird will come wheeling, squealing down and&mdash; tweak!
    go snipet-nippetting me up in his beak, and gobble-gobbling me down his throat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;So...&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>So</i>,&rdquo;  repeated Algy,</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;When a little ant goes walking,<br>
    he should look to left and right,<br>
    till he sees a foe come stalking&mdash;<br>
then run home with all his might.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good little antling.&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;Now
    brush yourself and give yourself a lick-wash. I&rsquo;d hate you to look
    untidy, for who&rsquo;s ever seen an untidy ant?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So Algy brushed himself with his spurs, and gave himself a good lick. Then
    he asked. &ldquo;<i>Now</i> can I go out to play, Nursey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, till sun-down. Remember, all antlings come home at sun-down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh. I&rsquo;ll remember sun-down. Nursey, cos sun-down&rsquo;s tea-time.&rdquo; And
    Algy ran off singing a song he often sang when he was by himself and that
    went to the tune of &ldquo;Little Brown Jug Don&rsquo;t I Love Thee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Algernon Ant, come skipping by,<br>
    the bravest ant beneath the sky.<br>
    No frightening thing can frighten me.<br>
    for frightening things delighten me.<br>
    Ha, ha, ha! I declare<br>
    I am the ant you cannot scare!&mdash;<br>
    Ha, ha, ha! I declare<br>
Ha, I am the ant you cannot scare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suddenly there was a sound of wings, and some birds flew into view.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aw, look at those herds flying in the sky! I think you call them
    herds,&rdquo; said Algy to himself. Then he yelled out very loudly,</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Twitter, twitter, silly herds,<br>
    flying in the sky!<br>
    Here I am, but you can&rsquo;t see<br>
cos you&rsquo;re much too high.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But at that moment a frightening thing happened. One bird flew down from
    the sky and looked at Algy in a very hungry sort of way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ooooh, by my pincers and tweezers!&rdquo; gasped Algy. &ldquo;Herds
    eat ants, and I&rsquo;m an ant. I think I&rsquo;ll hide behind this blade
    of grass. He can&rsquo;t see me here&mdash;he&rsquo;ll <i>never</i> see me
    here! He&rsquo;ll miss me here. I <i>know</i> he will, I&rsquo;m sure he
    will! I feel he will. I&mdash;I&mdash;hope&mdash;he&mdash;will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And the bird <i>did</i>&mdash;and flew away.</p>
  <p>Algy smiled, and at once began singing once more, this time to the tune
    of &ldquo;Here We Are Again&rdquo;.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Here I am&mdash;he&mdash;<i>he!</i><br>
    Happy as can be.<br>
No old herdies ever can frighten me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suddenly there sounded the loud, whirring, grinding, slicing, splicing sound
    of a lawn-mower.</p>
  <p>Algy stopped singing. &ldquo;Oooh,&rdquo; thought Algy, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
    that? I know it&rsquo;s a something dangerous to ants, but I disremember
    what. Is it a joy, or a twirl, or a corn-blower, or a herd? I <i>think</i> its
    a corn-blower. But&mdash;Ooooh! whatever it is, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll
    stay. I&rsquo;ll just creep away&mdash;under cover&mdash;of this clover&mdash;&rsquo;neath
    the shoulder&mdash;of this boulder&mdash;round this crinkly-wrinkly stone...Ah,
    how nice to be alone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then, as he was quite alone, he sang loudly.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Here I am&mdash;he&mdash;<i>he!</i><br>
    Happy as can be.<br>
No corn-blower ever can frighten me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But although Algy had got safely away from the lawnmower the birds had come
    flying back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, here come those old herds again.&rdquo; said Algy to himself,
    and he yelled out even louder than before.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Twitter, twitter, silly herds!<br>
  &lsquo;Spose you think I ran.<br>
    Here I am,. but you can&rsquo;t see&mdash;<br>
Oh! Oooh! yes you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For one bird <i>could</i>. This bird whose name was Mr Samuel Sparrow, had
    stepped down from the sky and walked over to the stone behind which Algy
    crouched. And after perching his head on one side for a moment, he pounced.
    Yes, he pounced on Algy.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Aha! I thought I smelt an ant.<br>
    I&rsquo;ve got you now!&mdash;don&rsquo;t kick and pant,<br>
    you fat little nit-wit,<br>
    you tasty wee tit-bit.<br>
    Home you come to my nest above<br>
for you&rsquo;re just the dinner my babies love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And even though Algy kept crying out that be wasn&rsquo;t a nit-wit and
    wasn&rsquo;t a tit-bit, Mr Sparrow picked him up in his beak and flew off
    with him.</p>
  <p>In Mr Sparrow&rsquo;s nest-home there were three fledgling sparrows, and
    when the hungry babies saw what their daddy had in his beak, they each squawked, &ldquo;For
    me!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;For me!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;For me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose turn was it to be fed <i>last</i> time?&rdquo; asked Mr Sparrow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not mine!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not mine!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not mine!&rdquo; squawked
    the babies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose turn is it to be fed <i>this</i> time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mine!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Mine!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; screamed
    the babies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be everybody&rsquo;s turn.<br>
    Now don&rsquo;t wriggle&mdash;squiggle&mdash;squirm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give <i>me</i> the worm!&rdquo; squawked each of the babies.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ant, not worm. A fat little fellow.<br>
    Now open your mouths&mdash;[squawk!]<br>
    Please don&rsquo;t yell-O!<br>
    Fluffy, don&rsquo;t peck Beaky!<br>
    Beaky, don&rsquo;t twig Squeaky!<br>
    If you&rsquo;re calm, I&rsquo;ll let you choose him;<br>
if you fight, you&rsquo;ll only lose him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Fluffy and Beaky and Squeaky did fight, and that&rsquo;s how they came
    to lose Algy.</p>
  <p>Daddy Sparrow was very cross and said:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There! You&rsquo;ve lost him! Well I told you.<br>
    He&rsquo;s fallen to the ground! I should scold you!<br>
    Now, now, don&rsquo;t make a howdy-do!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Boo-hoo! Boo-hoo! Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo!&rdquo; wept the babies.</p>
  <p>And down, down, down from the sparrow&rsquo;s nest&mdash;away down on the
    ground, Algy Ant was huffing and puffing as he picked himself up and counted
    his six legs to see if they were all there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; he puffed. &ldquo;That was a long drop from the barrow&rsquo;s
    nest. I&mdash;I&mdash;got away all right! They can&rsquo;t catch me!&rdquo; Then
    he sang to the tune of &ldquo;Here We Are Again&rdquo;,</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Here I am&mdash;he-he!<br>
    Happy as can be.<br>
No old barrow ever can frighten me!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To think those old baby barrows wanted to eat me! Umph! <i>I&rsquo;d</i> like
    to eat something. Think it must be tea-time. Yes, sun&rsquo;s down&mdash;better
    be getting home. I just follow this track between the two clumps of clover
    till I come to our nest.&rdquo;  And he ran home, singing to the same tune:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be home for tea:<br>
    just rely on me.<br>
I think tea&mdash;jolly good company.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s our ant nest! What a beautiful round red home it
    is. Oh, and there&rsquo;s Nurse at the door. Hullo, Nursey!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come back at last!&rdquo; snapped Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come back fast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me feel you with my horns. Yes its really you. You&rsquo;re late.
    Why, even the working ants have come in. This is the last day you&rsquo;ll
    go out to play, Algernon Ant. I&rsquo;ve a good mind to pinch you with my
    mandibles.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page012.png" width="525" height="750"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Nursey-</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After this you&rsquo;ll join the working ants and learn to do things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve been doing things. I&mdash;I&mdash;met the great biggest
    big corn-blower, and the great biggest big herd&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean a lawn-mower and a bird. Were you frightened?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I was delightened. But I frightened <i>them</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t boast! Why didn&rsquo;t you come home for tea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I did come home for tea. Tea&rsquo;s just what I came home for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tea&rsquo;s over long ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Algy looked blank. &ldquo;Over!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Over,&rdquo; said Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Over!&rdquo; murmured Algy slowly and sadly. &ldquo;Oh, dearie, dearie
    me! Over, and I haven&rsquo;t even begun!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ChapterTwo"></a>Chapter Two<br>
  A Home Is Wrecked</b></h2>
  <p>THE next morning Algy was very tired, and slept in.</p>
  <p>Nurse shook him. &ldquo;Wake up, Algy, the sun is drying up the dew and
    you&rsquo;ve got a whole new day before you. And you know what&rsquo;s going
    to happen today.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Nursey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean that today you are to become a worker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ooh,&rdquo; said Algy, slowly. &ldquo;You know, Nursey. I&rsquo;ve
    been wishing&mdash;and wishing&mdash;and wishing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wishing what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wishing I had wings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Algy, only men ants and women ants have wings. Your legs
    are short, your body is fat and your eyes are small; that means you are a
    worker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wish I had wings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Workers never have wings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I wish <i>I</i> had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nurse was shocked. She said. sternly. &ldquo;Algernon Ant, you can&rsquo;t
    mean you don&rsquo;t want to work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I do mean,&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> want
    to work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By my pincers and tweezers! By my delicate horns! I&rsquo;ve never
    heard an ant say that before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Nursey; but then, you see, I&rsquo;ve never <i>worked</i> before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said Nurse, with relief. &ldquo;But <i>when</i> you
    have worked, you&rsquo;ll know how good it is, and how important it makes
    you feel and then you&rsquo;ll love it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<font size="-1">Will I?</font>&rdquo; asked Algy, in a very small voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course you will. Why, the workers are the most useful people in
    the world. Now give yourself a brush down with your spurs, and stand up on
    your six feet, and let me lick you over! ... There, now you&rsquo;re nice
    and clean. Come along!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait, what&rsquo;s that noise?&rdquo; asked Algy. &ldquo;That great
    biggest big noise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nurse listened. Then she said, &ldquo;Yes, there is a noise. By the sound
    of it, it&rsquo;s one of those huge humans walking this way. Perhaps a boy
    or a girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me look,&rdquo; said Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go outside the nest. Algy! You&rsquo;ll have a human
    foot on you, if you&rsquo;re not careful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not frightened,&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just
    peep my little head out.&rdquo; And he popped his head round the open door
    of the ant-nest. But he popped it back again very quickly, and his voice
    sounded very small as he said, &ldquo;<font size="-1">Yes, it is a human.
    It&rsquo;s a joy</font>.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page015.png" width="691" height="750"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean a boy,&rdquo; said Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, a boy. A great biggest big one and he&rsquo;s got the great
    biggest big lick in his hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a lick, a stick. Oh, dear! If he pokes our nest with that stick,
    there&rsquo;ll be a landslide,&rdquo; cried Nurse.</p>
  <p>And the boy <i>did</i> poke the stick and there <i>was</i> a landslide.
    The land muttered and spluttered and heaved and billowed so that the ant
    nest rocked to and fro like a ship on a stormy sea; then split and finally
    broke all up. All the ants muttered and spluttered, too. Even Nurse spluttered
    as she muttered, &ldquo;Are
    you all right, Algy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Nursey, I&rsquo;m all wrong. The land went jumpety-jump and I
    went bumpety-bump and now I&rsquo;m standing on my little head with mud in
    my eye,&rdquo; said Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give me your horn and I&rsquo;ll pull you up! There! now you&rsquo;re
    all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A landslide! A landslide! A landslide!&rdquo; shouted the ants, dashing
    hither and thither, all wanting to help at once.</p>
  <p>Nurse wanted to help, too. &ldquo;We must save all the eggs,&rdquo; she
    said, picking up one of them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The eggs! The eggs! Save the eggs,&rdquo; shouted the ants, each
    picking one up in his mandibles, but not knowing where to take it.</p>
  <p>Just then a very important-looking worker ant stepped out in front of all
    the other clustered, flustered ants and clapped his mandibles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;  said Nurse. &ldquo;He is going to make an announcement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s an-nounce-ment?&rdquo; asked Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;S-ssh. Listen, and you&rsquo;ll hear one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So Algy listened, and all the other ants listened to the important-looking
    worker ant, as he announced in a loud important voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fellow ants, our nest has been destroyed by an ignorant, cruel, young
    human. Our beautiful nest that rose two feet above the ground and sank two
    feet below the ground, is now mostly ruined. We could rebuild our nest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;  shouted the ants.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we could rebuild our nest; but we workers of the Ant Republic
    have agreed that it is no longer safe to live here. We must move. We must
    build another nest in a safer place. And in time we shall build a nest, not
    two, but three feet above ground, and three feet below.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted all the other ants.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our engineers, and our surveyors have already gone ahead to find
    a safe spot where we can build; and now all of us must follow them, with
    brave hearts. For you know what we say:</p>
  <p class="note">Through good and bad, through thick and thin,<br>
    you never see an ant give in.<br>
    One for all and all for one&mdash;<br>
that&rsquo;s the way to get things done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ants cheered and the speaker went on,</p>
  <p>You know what to do. and will do it without fuss. Our nurses will, of course,
    carry the eggs and the young larvae antlings to our new home. All workers
    will, of course, help any sick or old ants. For with us ants it is:</p>
  <p class="note">One for all and all for one&mdash;<br>
that&rsquo;s the way to get things done!</p>
  <p>To work then, ants!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To work! To work! To work!&rdquo; cried the ants, rushing about their
    affairs. &ldquo;To work! To work! To work!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what do <i>we</i> do, Nursey?&rdquo; asked Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m a nurse, and you heard our speaker say that the nurses
    must carry the eggs and larvae to our new nest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to carry me instead, Nursey?&rdquo;  Algy
    asked, and he made himself look as small and helpless and charming as he
    could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carry a great fat antling like you? Of course not. Why, you&rsquo;re
    big enough to be a worker&mdash;and <i>that</i> reminds me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh. don&rsquo;t let it remind you, Nursey,&rdquo; cried Algy very
    quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, but it does remind me that this is the day you were to start
    working.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d be reminded of,&rdquo;  said
    Algy, sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You may as well start by carrying an egg. Here, hold out your mandibles
    and I&rsquo;ll give you one! There! Are you holding it tightly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y-y-yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Well, be very, very careful of it, for the eggs are the most
    precious things in ant life. They must never, never be hurt in any way. Now,
    come along! Oh, here come the other nurses&mdash;so we can all set out together.</p>
  <p>As the nurses came marching up, they chanted in chorus:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Here we come on busy legs,<br>
    Rescuing our precious eggs.<br>
    Hurry, hurry&mdash;don&rsquo;t stand and talk!<br>
Hustle and bustle and hurry your walk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And they all hustled and bustled&mdash;all except Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurry up, Algy! Why are you dawdling back there, behind all the others?&rdquo; Nurse
    scolded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hurrying&mdash;and hurrying&mdash;and hurrying,&rdquo; panted
    Algy. &ldquo;But my egg is so heavy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense,&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;An ant can carry anything
    ten times his own weight. And anyway, these eggs are not a bit heavy. Come
    along!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> egg is very heavy, Nursey. And it&rsquo;s slippery, too.
    It&rsquo;s <i>very</i> slippery.&rdquo; And Algy giggled one of his most
    mischievous giggles. &ldquo;I hope I don&rsquo;t drop it,&rdquo; he said
    slowly, and giggled again.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page018.png" width="850" height="733"></h3>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ChapterThree"></a>Chapter Three<br>
Through A Jungle Of Grass</b></h2>
  <p>MEANWHILE, all the other ants were hurrying and scurrying along, through
    the thick jungle of grass, to a new patch of ground where it would be safe
    to build their new nest.</p>
  <p>First came the surveyors and engineers, then the foragers, then the masons,
    then the nurses, and way, way back&mdash;the very last of them all&mdash;came
    Algernon. Every ant hustled and bustled and hurried his walk&mdash;every
    ant except Algy. Algy was looking this way and that way at everything in
    sight; and not caring which way or what way he walked. And as he dawdled
    along he sang:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Algernon Ant, come creeping by,<br>
    the bravest ant beneath the sky.<br>
    No frightening thing can frighten me,<br>
    for frightening things delighten me.<br>
    Ha, ha, ha! I declare<br>
    I am the ant you cannot scare.<br>
    Ha, ha, ha! I declare<br>
I am the ant you cannot scare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Algy looked carefully round this way and that way just to make sure
    there wasn&rsquo;t anything about that could scare him. And as there wasn&rsquo;t,
    he sang more loudly than ever.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page020-a.png" width="655" height="218"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Algy, do stop dawdling,&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;Look, you&rsquo;re
    right at the end of the procession.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a pro-cess-ion, Nurse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A procession is a long line of ants moving from here to there. Have
    you got your egg safe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it, but it isn&rsquo;t very safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t it safe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the egg is very big, Nursey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not too big for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The egg is very heavy, Nursey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not too heavy for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And an egg that is big and heavy might spill itself on the ground,
    Nursey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If that egg spills itself on the ground it will be the worse for
    you, Algy Ant. Well, why have you stopped? What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m stuck, Nursey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stuck?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, my six little feet are stuck&mdash;tight&mdash;on a blade of
    grass, and I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t get them unstuck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me look,&rdquo; said Nurse, frowning. &ldquo;Oh, I see, you&rsquo;re
    walking along a snail&rsquo;s track. No wonder you&rsquo;re stuck! Here,
    put your little horn in my mandible and I&rsquo;ll pull you out of the gum.&rdquo; And
    Nurse did pull him out of the gum which, when it let go, made a great smacking
    sound like a kiss.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page020-c.png" width="850" height="500"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;There, you silly antling!&rdquo; scolded Nurse. &ldquo;Now hold your
    egg tightly and let&rsquo;s hurry! And after this, don&rsquo;t walk on the
    grass. Walk under it, like the other ants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The other ants were walking under the grass, chanting:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Tiny road,<br>
    tiny track,<br>
    running on,<br>
    turning back;<br>
    here we come,<br>
    here we go,<br>
    quickety, slickety,<br>
never slow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Algy wasn&rsquo;t quick, Algy was slow. In fact he was so slow that,
    once again, he had stopped.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page020-b.png" width="477" height="275"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Will</i> you come on, Algy? Why have you stopped now?&rdquo; asked
    Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nibbling&mdash;and nibbling&mdash;and nibbling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I can hear you nibbling. But what are you nibbling, and where
    are you nibbling?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just over your head. Nursey dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;ve wandered up a flower stem to eat the blossom.
    That&rsquo;s very greedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not only eating, Nursey dear, I&rsquo;m sniffing&mdash;and
    sniffing&mdash;and sniffing. Oh, she does smell so sweet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really, Algy, your antics give me the frantics, Why can&rsquo;t
    you stay on the ground like a good little antling? If I have to go up that
    flower stem to fetch you down, I&rsquo;ll give you a hard pinch with my mandibles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming&mdash;and coming&mdash;and coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And all the other ants are going, and going, and going. We&rsquo;ll
    have to run like the wind to catch up to them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When&mdash;I&mdash;run&mdash;like&mdash;the&mdash;wind&mdash;I&mdash;puff&mdash;like&mdash;the&mdash;wind,&rdquo;  said
    Algy, running and puffing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyway, we have caught up with the others,&rdquo;  said Nurse. For
    they could now see the other ants, and hear them chanting:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;We hurry and scurry<br>
    down the garden border,<br>
    hustling, bustling,<br>
but always in order.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad when we&rsquo;re out of this garden,&rdquo;  said
    Nurse. &ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t be stopping every minute to eat and sniff
    the flowers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can see someone else sniffing flowers,&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
    the great biggest big he you ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not a he&mdash;a bee. I don&rsquo;t like bees,&rdquo; said Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll just tell her you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And Algy ran
    over to the bee.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come back, Algy. You&rsquo;re only making an excuse to go and sniff
    another flower. Oh dear! here is that dreadful bee following us. Now she&rsquo;ll
    start boasting about herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Mrs Bee did. She boasted and buzzed:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of me,<br>
    the Busy Bee,<br>
    they&rsquo;ve made a moral story<br>
    about the way<br>
    I work all day.<br>
    That&rsquo;s how I won my glory!<br>
    Buzz wuzz tee,<br>
    I&rsquo;m the Bumble Bee,<br>
    buzz-buzz, wuzz-wuzzy boo!<br>
    You&rsquo;ve heard of ME,<br>
    the <i>humble</i> bee,<br>
but I&rsquo;ve not heard of YOU!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This made Nurse very angry, and she said:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be<br>
    so vain, old Bee;<br>
    you needn't be conceited;<br>
    for, hark to me! your history<br>
    is far from being completed.<br>
    There&rsquo;ll come a day,<br>
    a day, I say,<br>
    when you will buzz no more.<br>
    We ants will thrive upon your hive<br>
and hunt you from your door!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Bee laughed rudely:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Tee-hee! Tee-hee!<br>
    Excuse my glee,<br>
    but, really, it diverts me&mdash;<br>
    that such a dot,<br>
    a mere black spot<br>
    could dream such railing hurts me.<br>
    I&rsquo;m the Bumble Bee,<br>
    buzz-buzz, wuzz-wuzzy boo!<br>
    You&rsquo;ve heard of ME,<br>
    the <i>humble</i> bee,<br>
but I&rsquo;ve not heard of YOU!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By this time Nurse had lost her temper. She scowled and growled:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Such a stiff-necked body,<br>
    stuck-up shoddy<br>
    old creature I&rsquo;ve never seen. I&rsquo;ve not.<br>
    Though I&rsquo;m polite,<br>
    it&rsquo;s only right<br>
    to show her once for all what&rsquo;s what!<br>
    This boasting bee<br>
    had better flee<br>
    or I will fight and bite her.<br>
    I&rsquo;d like to dump<br>
    and soundly thump,<br>
and scrag and scratch the skiter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would you really, Nursey?&rdquo; asked Algy, looking pleased and
    surprised.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page024.jpg" width="565" height="750"></h3>
  <p>But Mrs Bee smiled in a provoking, joking sort of way and buzzed on:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Boy who&rsquo;s lazy,<br>
    girl who&rsquo;s hazy<br>
    is referred to <i>me</i>;<br>
    to emulate<br>
    and imitate<br>
    my noble industry.<br>
    Buzz wuzz tee,<br>
    I&rsquo;m the Bumble Bee,<br>
    buzz-buzz, wuzz-wuzzy boo!<br>
    You&rsquo;ve heard of ME,<br>
    the <i>humble</i> bee,<br>
but I&rsquo;ve not heard of You!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suddenly there were loud buzzes from Mrs Bee:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s tearing my wing?<br>
    Who&rsquo;s biting my sting?<br>
    Who&rsquo;s pinching and pricking,<br>
and thumping and kicking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nursey, Nursey, is it you? Are you doing what you said you&rsquo;d
    like to do?&rdquo; giggled Algy, very very surprised.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, my powerful sting!<br>
    Oh, my beautiful wing!<br>
    Oh, what shall I do?<br>
    I&rsquo;m wounded&mdash;boo-hoo!<br>
Boo-hoo, boo&mdash;boo&mdash;HOO!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>screamed Mrs Bee, flying away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, she&rsquo;s gone! Vain old thing,&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;Fancy
    boasting to me&mdash;an ant! Why, we ants are the oldest form of civilization.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is civilization, Nursey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Civilization is being civil to one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that what you were to the old he when you scruffed her just now,
    Nursey?&rdquo; Algy asked, sweetly.</p>
  <p>Nurse frowned. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, I don&rsquo;t like to remember that,&rdquo; she
    said. &ldquo;No one should scruff anyone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then if you don&rsquo;t like to remember it, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> remember
    it, Nursey. <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, because you don&rsquo;t remember anything, Algy. Well, let&rsquo;s
    hurry, or we&rsquo;ll never get to our new nest tonight. Now hold on to your
    egg&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you say my egg, Nursey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, your egg, Algy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My&mdash;my egg, Nursey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, of course your egg. Why, good gracious! <i>Where is your egg?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Its here, Nursey, on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page026.png" width="500" height="661"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;On the ground. Do you mean you <i>dropped</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not quite, Nursey. But you see, I&rsquo;m only a little ant, and
    it&rsquo;s a very big egg, and so&mdash;and so&mdash;and so I stood on the
    egg so that I wouldn&rsquo;t be knocked over when you were showing Mrs He
    you were civilized.&rdquo; And Algy gave a little wriggle and a giggle.</p>
  <p>Nurse was horrified. &ldquo;Algernon Ant, you stood on an egg!&rdquo; And
    then Nurse saw the egg and gave a loud gasp, &ldquo;Why, yes, look at it&mdash;there&rsquo;s
    a great big dent in the middle of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it dents in there,&rdquo; agreed Algy sadly. Then he added brightly, &ldquo;But
    it bulges out <i>here!</i> I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really hurt except
    it&rsquo;s not quite round in the middle any more. But perhaps an egg doesn&rsquo;t
    like going round, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nurse looked more fierce than Algy had ever seen her. &ldquo;<i>You, Algernon,
      stood on an egg! An ant stood on an ant egg!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Nursey. I don&rsquo;t! There! see, I&rsquo;ve
    picked it up now and we can hurry and scurry and catch up with the others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But where are the others?&rdquo; cried Nurse.</p>
  <p>And sure enough they were nowhere to be seen. For while Nurse and Mrs Bee
    were talking, the other ants had kept on walking and walking and so now,
    of course, Algy and his nurse couldn&rsquo;t see them at all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting very dark,&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;Yes, night&rsquo;s
    coming down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And Nursey, the sky wears a frown. It&rsquo;s scowling&mdash;with
    blackedy eyebrows in crowds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those eyebrows are heavy rainclouds. And we&rsquo;ve lost the other
    ants. Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we can soon catch up with them,&rdquo; cried Algy, running under
    a long blade of grass, and shouting very loudly. &ldquo;Hi, ants, wait for
    us! Wait for us! Wait for us!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Algy, don&rsquo;t run from me into the dark, or you&rsquo;ll be lost,
    too,&rdquo; cried Nurse.</p>
  <p>But it was too late. Algy <i>had</i> run into the dark! and he <i>was</i> lost!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ChapterFour"></a>Chapter Four<br>
  Lost And Found</b></h2>
  <p>ALGY kept on running and running until he was back again at the garden border
    where they had met Mrs Bee. But he did not find the other ants, and he did
    not find Nurse. So there he was, quite alone, without another ant in sight&mdash;lost
    in the great Australian grass! And it was very dark.</p>
  <p>Suddenly, there sounded a loud hooting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oooooh, there&rsquo;s the thing that hoots&mdash;I <i>think</i> you
    call it a fowl,&rdquo; said Algy, listening to the owl.</p>
  <p>Then there sounded a loud mewing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the thing that mews&mdash;I think you call it a
    hat,&rdquo; said Algy, listening to the cat.</p>
  <p>Next there sounded a loud barking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the thing that barks&mdash;I <i>think</i> you call
    it a frog,&rdquo; said Algy, listening to the dog. Then, after a big yawn
    he went on:</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page028.jpg" width="750" height="750"></h3>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;O-o-o-oh, the night is big and black and seems to wrap me round.<br>
    The moon peeped out behind a cloud and, when it saw me, frowned.<br>
    And I am very little, and the sky is very high.<br>
    I&mdash;I wish Nurse was here to tuck me in my comfy cosy-bye...<br>
    Nursey!...I&rsquo;m sleepy&mdash;<br>
    and the dark makes me feel creepy&mdash;<br>
    and I&rsquo;m by myself, alone...<br>
    Well, I&rsquo;ll crawl beneath this stone,<br>
    fold my two mandibles, shut each eye&mdash;<br>
    curl up my six feet&mdash;<br>
and&mdash;go&mdash;sleepy&mdash;bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So Algy crawled beneath the stone, set down his egg, folded his two mandibles,
    shut his two eyes, curled up his six feet and went to sleep.</p>
  <p>And while he slept the moon went in and the sun came out, and a rooster
    crowed and blowed to show it was morning.</p>
  <p>Algy opened his eyes, and smiled. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s day!&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;A new day! A <i>brand</i> new day! Oooh! Sun shines so bright
    he sizzles. The pickets chirp! I <i>think</i> you call them pickets,&rdquo; said
    Algy, listening to the crickets. Then he grew sad. &ldquo;But&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;still&mdash;lost.&rdquo; Then
    he smiled again, &ldquo;Still, as Nurse isn&rsquo;t
    here, I needn&rsquo;t have a wash, and I can eat what I like. Here&rsquo;s
    something that I like&mdash;a great biggest big cherry about
    a thousand times bigger than me. If I eat all this for breakfast, I won&rsquo;t
    want dinner or tea. Ummmmm!&rdquo; And he took a huge bite.</p>
  <p>Then suddenly, floating to him through the tall grass, came Nurse&rsquo;s
    voice, calling, &ldquo;Algy! Algy! Algy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here I am, Nursey!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Algy, I have found you at last!&rdquo; cried Nurse, bobbing round
    from behind a pebble. &ldquo;Let me feel you with my delicate horns to make
    sure it&rsquo;s really you...Yes, for sure it&rsquo;s you. I&rsquo;ve been
    hunting for you all night long. Where have you been? And what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I slept under a stone. And now I&rsquo;m eating&mdash;and eating&mdash;eating,&rdquo; said
    Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, so I see. But take it from <i>me</i>, if you eat too much
    you&rsquo;ll <i>pop</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t eat too much,&rdquo; said Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve eaten enough for two now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, yes, I&rsquo;m afraid I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> eat another
    crumb,&rdquo; Algy admitted. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m very, very, very thirsty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, take a sip of dew from that wood violet near you and pick up
    your egg. I hope you&rsquo;ve still <i>got</i> your egg, have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, here it is,&rdquo; said Algy, proudly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, now hold it very carefully and we&rsquo;ll walk along this
    way. I&rsquo;m sure I can smell ants on this track. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then far away through the jungle of grass a voice sounded faintly: &ldquo;Ant
    there! Ant there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Algy, listen! Did you hear some ant calling?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard&mdash;I heard&mdash;I heard,&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;Who
    can it be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Its probably a scout, sent out to find us. Yes, here comes a scout,
    waving his horns.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ant there! Ant there!&rdquo; cooed the scout. </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ant here! Ant here!&rdquo; answered Nurse.</p>
  <p>The scout marched up and, standing in front of Algy and Nurse, said in a
    very important voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for antling Algernon, and
    Nurse Number Six Hundred and Ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am Nurse Six Hundred and Ten,&rdquo; said Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I am antling Algernon,&rdquo; said Algy.</p>
  <p>The scout felt them with his sensitive feelers. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s you
    sure enough,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We heard you were lost, stolen or strayed,
    so I was sent to find you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Algy strayed and then he got lost,&rdquo; said Nurse.  &ldquo;Have
    you been searching for us long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since sun-up time. Come, follow me to our camp&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So Algy and Nurse followed the scout, who went hurrying and scurrying down
    the garden border. He walked so fast that Algy had to run to keep him in
    sight. Algy thought it best to run because he didn&rsquo;t want to be lost
    again, and he did so want to see his new home.</p>
  <p>At last the scout stopped and said, &ldquo;Here we are. You see we found
    a very good patch of ground on which to build our new nest. Every ant&rsquo;s
    been busy; and the engineers and miners, masons and builders are still on
    the job.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Algy, this will be a treat for you, seeing how a nest is built,&rdquo; said
    Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he ever seen a nest built before?&rdquo; asked the scout.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not old enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Algy did not like that. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m as old as any other ant my
    age.&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But how do we build the nest, Mr Scout?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; answered the scout, &ldquo;our engineers and surveyors
    came here and found this clear space of ground for us. Then we began the
    building.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page032.png" width="800" height="500"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;How did we do that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The miners dug down into the earth with their mandibles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have got two mandibles,&rdquo; Algy said, proudly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course. All ants have two mandibles. I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;d
    do without mandibles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d do without,&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;But tell me what
    the miners do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be able to see that for yourself if you watch,&rdquo; said
    the ant. &ldquo;I must get back to work.&rdquo; And off he hustled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a very big nest or very high,&rdquo; said Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s growing.&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;You just look.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are the miners?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are underneath, hollowing out the lower rooms. If you listen
    you can hear them chanting in their tunnels.&rdquo; And Algy listened and
    heard the miners chanting while they dug:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;First a little hole<br>
    we dig, and dig, and dig.<br>
    Till the little hole<br>
    grows big, and big, and big.<br>
    Standing in the soil,<br>
    digging down and deep,<br>
    piling grain on grain<br>
high up in a heap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;Every bit of soil the miners
    dig out of the earth is piled up in a heap on top of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. So you see our nest rises higher as it grows deeper. Then there
    are other workers, scattered about outside. Their job is to hunt and forage
    for bits and pieces to pile on the heap. Listen to them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Algy heard the workers chanting:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Forage in the dust!<br>
    treasures lie all round;<br>
    sheaves of grass and straw<br>
    everywhere are found.<br>
    Every load of leaf,<br>
    chunk of wood or straw,<br>
    we stack upon the heap,<br>
then search for more and more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They carry very large loads of leaf, and very large chunks of stick,
    don&rsquo;t they, Nursey? The load is sometimes so heavy that it knocks them
    over,&rdquo; said Algy.</p>
  <p>And tripping and slipping the foragers chanted:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;We stumble and tumble<br>
    head over toe,<br>
    but get up; and once up<br>
onward we go.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page035.png" width="635" height="750"></h3>
  <p>And onward they went, all the time saying, &ldquo;Onward we go! Onward we
    go! Onward we go!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then there are the masons,&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;They make the
    bricks. Listen to them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Algy listened and heard the masons chant:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;With a dab of dust,<br>
    we masons do our trick<br>
    roll the dust in dew,<br>
make a mighty brick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do the masons do with the bricks they make?&rdquo; asked Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see? They stick them into the places where the building
    looks unfinished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;Oh, what a lot of workers bustling
    about, everywhere&mdash; everywhere&mdash; everywhere!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Nurse, &ldquo;every part of the building is going
    on at the same time&mdash; inside and out, below and above.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And are they making rooms inside?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dozens and dozens of rooms and dozens of passages and galleries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s wonderful! I want to help, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to speak, Algy! Now you sound like a true ant,&rdquo; said
    Nurse and she looked very, very pleased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How can I help, Nursey? Which part shall I look at?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look, you <i>do</i>,&rdquo; said Nurse sternly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    an ant, Algernon&mdash;and ants work!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like working, Nursey. You know that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that your antics give me the frantics,&rdquo;  said Nurse. &ldquo;Now
    do as I do. Bring your egg inside to the nursery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ooh, have they got the nursery built?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course they have. The nursery is always the first room they build.
    That&rsquo;s where we keep our eggs&mdash;and our eggs are very, very important.
    Come along now and help!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming&mdash;I&rsquo;m coming&mdash;I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo; cried
    Algy. And he went running after the others to <i>watch</i> them work.</p>

  The New Home Is Built</b></h2>
  <p>THE ants worked on and on, on and on until their new home was even bigger
    than the last home. They then all stood off together and, gazing at it proudly,
    chanted each in turn:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;This is the Nest we ants built. These are the

  We ants built&mdash;<br>
  We ants built&mdash;<br>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Nursey, I say it is the bestest best nest in the world and the
    biggest big!&rdquo; cried Algy happily. &ldquo;Are we going to live here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and work here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ooooh&mdash;<i>work</i>.&rdquo;  The happy look left Algy s
    face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, your play days are over. You&rsquo;re a big ant now, so it&rsquo;s
    work for you, not play,&rdquo; said Nurse, frowning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t it just be the other way round, Nursey? Couldn&rsquo;t
    it just be play, not work?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, it just couldn&rsquo;t. So remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure to remember. I mean, I&rsquo;m sure to remember <i>something</i>.
    But I&rsquo;m not sure what the something will be that I&rsquo;ll remember.
    I have a sort-of-a, kind-of-a-feeling I&rsquo;ll be able to remember play <i>easier</i> than
    I can remember work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Algernon Ant!</i>&rdquo; said Nurse, looking very stern.</p>
  <p>Just then, hundreds and hundreds of ants came marching along, and chanting
    briskly,</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s work to do,<br>
    and we&rsquo;ll do it, too!<br>
    Keep on and on<br>
    till we get through.<br>
    To work&mdash;to work&mdash;to work&mdash;to work!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quick, Algy! Run and join the workers,&rdquo; Nurse ordered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re marching away, Nursey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re marching to work. Off you go, with them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming Nursey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going inside to look after the eggs. I&rsquo;m a nurse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m a&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a worker, Algy. Run on, or you&rsquo;ll never catch
    up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m running&mdash;and running&mdash;and running.&rdquo; said
    Algy miserably. And he really did run...a little way!</p>
  <p>The workers marched on ahead of him chanting &ldquo;To work! To work! To
    work! To work!&rdquo; until they came to a clear space between a dandelion
    and a clump of clover. Then they all scattered and ran this way and that
    way.</p>
  <p>Algy was taking a sip of honey-dew from a yellow daisy when a very busy-looking
    ant rushed up to him and said, &ldquo;I hear you are going to start work
    today.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Er&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said Algy, unhappily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you start?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<font size="-1">I&rsquo;m just waiting to start</font>,&rdquo; said Algy, in a small voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t wait to start! You start. And once you start, you
    don&rsquo;t wait until you&rsquo;ve finished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<font size="-1">Ooooooooo!</font>&rdquo; said Algy in an even smaller voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well START!&rdquo; said the worker, loudly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
    see we&rsquo;re all foraging. Why don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> forage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to forage,&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;What is
    foraging?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Foraging is hunting for supplies of food.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh food!&rdquo; cried Algy, and he smiled one of his biggest smiles. &ldquo;Food! <i>I&rsquo;m</i> hungry,
    too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the worker ant looked very stern. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not hunting for
    food to eat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hunting for it to take back
    to the nest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! Still, when you get it back to the nest, you do eat it then.
    Don&rsquo;t you, Worker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but we share it. You never see an ant eat alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you? Oh, but then you couldn&rsquo;t see him if he was
    alone, could you, Worker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play!&rdquo; shouted the worker ant. &ldquo;Work! Work!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;B&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look at that hunk of melon by your right three feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ooh, yes! It looks a tasty one, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;  cried Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It does. Hoist it over your shoulder and tramp back with it to the
    nest. That will be working. Go on, lift it up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Up&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;Got it!&rdquo; gasped Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now carry it back home,&rdquo; said the worker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how can I find my way home?&rdquo; asked Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ants always find their way home,&rdquo; said the worker. &ldquo;They
    have a homing instinct.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I might get lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ants can&rsquo;t get lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can get lost,&rdquo; said Algy proudly. &ldquo;I was with Nurse,
    and first Nursey and I lost sight of all the other Nurses, and then I lost
    sight of Nursey, and so I was really and truly lost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must have been very young.&rdquo; said the worker, and he sniffed
    a bit. &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, wait a minute,&rdquo; Algy called quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want now?&rdquo; the worker asked impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I was just thinking&mdash;and thinking&mdash;and thinking,&rdquo; said
    Algy. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;ll be alone when I&rsquo;m going back to the
    nest, won&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t eat this tasty speck of melon, do I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even take a nibble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not half a nibble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh dear, I <i>must</i> be a good ant!&rdquo; said Algy thoughtfully. &ldquo;I
    had no idea I was such a hero. Oh, don&rsquo;t go yet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked the worker, looking back over his
    shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was just thinking&mdash;and thinking&mdash;and thinking&mdash;er&mdash;suppose
    I forget to take this&mdash; um&mdash; tasty bit of melon back to the nest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I do forget&mdash;sometimes.&rdquo; said Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ants <i>never</i> forget.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Algy. Then he had another thought. &ldquo;Er-suppose
    I get frightened, going alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be frightened. Ants are never frightened&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Algy, suddenly feeling very big and brave. &ldquo;Being
    an ant is certainly being something very important isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the worker ant had dashed off to grab a piece of rotted apple core.
    So Algy, feeling very brave, and holding tightly to his piece of melon, set
    out to find his way back to the nest alone. And, as he went, he sang his
    bravest song.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Algernon Ant come skipping by,<br>
    the bravest ant beneath the sky.<br>
    No frightening thing can frighten me,<br>
    for frightening things delighten me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stopped in the middle of his song and said to himself, &ldquo;I hope
    I&rsquo;m on the right track.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It all depends where you wish to go, old thing!&rdquo;  said a very
    starchy voice, with a very-high-above-you accent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oooooh! Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; gasped Algy, shutting his eyes tight,
    and no longer feeling big and brave. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll just creep
    under this stone before I look.&rdquo; So he crept under the stone and then,
    very carefully, opened one eye and peeped slowly out. When he saw that the
    voice had come from a large pale-green grasshopper he felt quite big and
    brave again.</p>
  <p>He called out in his loudest voice, &ldquo;Oh, hullo, Mr Brassclopper, I&rsquo;m
    Algernon Ant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard you singing about it,&rdquo; replied the grasshopper. &ldquo;Why
    don&rsquo;t you come out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I like being under this stone. But I&rsquo;m not frightened,
    you know.&rdquo; And Algy smiled politely at the grasshopper, who was looking
    as grand as grasshoppers always do; for, like all the others, this one seemed
    to wear a long-tailed coat, and his sticking-out eye, glinting like a drop
    of dew, seemed for all the world like an eye-glass. This struck Algy, who
    said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very nice green coat you&rsquo;re wearing, and
    a very nice glass in front of your eye, Mr Brassclopper.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page044.jpg" width="642" height="750"></h3>
  <p>For answer the grasshopper began to sing. He sang:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;A grasshopper I&mdash;<br>
  with a glass in my eye&mdash;<br>
  it&rsquo;s a monocle really, old thing!<br>
  I&rsquo;ve a handsome green coat<br>
  with two tails that float<br>
  behind me, like flags, when I spring.</p>
  <p class="note">I&rsquo;m a beau and a fop<br>

    I fold my back legs like a spring,<br>
    then I stretch them out wide,<br>
    and sail off in a glide,<br>
    a tremendous stupendous great fling!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ooh, Mr Brassclopper, you did jump a long way,&rdquo;  cried Algy. &ldquo;I
    can&rsquo;t jump like that, but I can work, and I can remember, and I&rsquo;m
    never afraid, and I take the food I find back to the nest without eating
    it. In fact, I&rsquo;m an <i>ant!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You bore me!&rdquo; said Mr Grasshopper and he gave another huge
    jump that took him way up, over the tops of the grasses, out of sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s jumped home!&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d
    better skip home. Now where&rsquo;s my eye-glass.&rdquo; And, pretending
    to be a grasshopper-ant, he pretended to fix an eye-glass into his eye, and,
    still clutching his speck of melon, off he went, singing in a very starchy
    voice, with a very high-above-you accent,</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha, I declare<br>
    I am the ant you cannot scare!<br>

  The Ant Lion</b></h2>
  <p>ALGY had been skipping along through the grass, and singing for a long,
    long time but he wasn&rsquo;t home yet. &ldquo;I must be <i>nearly</i> there,&rdquo; he
    said to himself. He was feeling a bit tired and hot, and so was quite glad
    when a little breeze blew up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Here comes a breeze.<br>
    Its tossing the trees,<br>
    it&rsquo;s nodding the heads<br>
    of the flowers in their beds,<br>
    it&rsquo;s rippling the glass<br>
    of the pool&mdash;and the grass.</p>
  <p>Ooooh, how the grass sways! Every stalk is a swing. If I wasn&rsquo;t so
    good and in such a hurry to get back to the nest with this great big load
    of melon, I&rsquo;d have a swing on one of those stalks. But I must hurry
    home.</p>
  <p class="note">Bump the long-haired, green-eyed grass,<br>
    and knock the daffodils as I pass!<br>
    Ooooh, I&rsquo;d love to sit and sway<br>
    in a daffodil all day.<br>
    There I&rsquo;d swing high up and high,<br>
    high as herds fly in the sky!</p>
  <p>But I must&mdash;I <i>must</i> hurry home...Well perhaps I could have just
    a little swing. Just a tiny, teeny, weeny swing in the golden daffodil. Oh,
    here&rsquo;s a bell-blue! A bell&rsquo;s best of all, cos I&rsquo;ll ring
    as I swing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So down went his melon on the ground, and up the flower stalk went Algy
    to sit in the blue-cushioned bell. And the little breeze puffed itself up
    and up, and blew harder and harder, so that it tossed the bluebell from side
    to side, till it rang and rang, and Algy felt like a bird, flying way up
    high in the sky.</p>
  <p>But suddenly there was a loud noise of wings. &ldquo;Oh, oh,&rdquo; said
    Algy to himself, &ldquo;here comes a <i>real</i> herd, a big brown one&mdash;I <i>think</i> you
    call him a barrow. I&rsquo;d better get down before he sees me...Ah, I&rsquo;m
    on the ground again and he hasn&rsquo;t eaten me. Now where did I put my
    melon? Oh, oh, it isn&rsquo;t here!...Or there!...Or anywhere!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And while he was running this way and that way and every other way, looking
    for his melon, Algy suddenly tripped and slipped&mdash;down, down, <i>down</i>,
    into a great big sandy hole.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page047.png" width="600" height="427"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Got you!&rdquo; shouted a deep grumpy voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; squeaked Algy, shutting his eyes tightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am an ant lion. And you have fallen into the trap I made to catch
    you,&rdquo; answered the deep grumpy voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you dug this biggest big sandy hole, did you?&rdquo; asked Algy,
    opening his eyes and looking around.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did&mdash;with my shovel-shaped head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like lions,&rdquo; whimpered Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I like ants&mdash;to eat!&rdquo; and the ant lion smacked his
    lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<font size="-1">Y&mdash;you don&rsquo;t want to eat me, do you?</font>&rdquo; asked Algy,
    in his very smallest voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I do want,&rdquo; said the ant lion, and he
    smacked and smacked and smacked his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t eat me if I were you, Mr Lion, dear. Really,
    I wouldn&rsquo;t. Really and truly. I don&rsquo;t taste nice. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
    tough!&rdquo;  cried Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you&rsquo;re not tough. You&rsquo;re a nice, fat, juicy little
    antling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; cried Algy. And he struggled very hard to walk up
    the side of the hole; but wherever he tried to walk, the sand crumbled beneath
    his feet so that he fell back down into the hole again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here! Where do you think you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo; roared the ant
    lion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I have to get back to my nest. Nurse will be wondering where
    I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well you needn&rsquo;t think you can climb up the side of this funnel-shaped
    hole because you can&rsquo;t! It&rsquo;s much too cleverly built,&rdquo; snarled
    the ant lion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can try,&rdquo; said Algy. And he tried and tried, but all he could
    do was to keep slithering and sliding, while the ant lion laughed wickedly
    and sang:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a most amazing li-on:<br>
    I can&rsquo;t roar, but how I shi-on<br>
    at a-catching of you, Ant.<br>
    Like the fly with the spry spider<br>
    you quickly fall insider<br>
    little trap&mdash;and there you pant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And indeed Algy was panting so that it seemed his sides would burst, as
    the ant lion went on singing:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I hope you have relations<br>
    and some friends who&rsquo;ll have the patience<br>
    to search for you. Ho, my!<br>
    When they <i>all</i> fall in my trappy.<br>
    won&rsquo;t I be a happy chappy!<br>
    Yum! For tea I&rsquo;ll have ant-pie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me out! Let me out,&rdquo; screamed Algy. But the ant lion went
    on, rather crossly:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t splash around the scenery<br>
    or you&rsquo;ll find the sand machinery<br>
    will smother you like a flea.<br>
    Pray, stop it now and quickly<br>
    or the sand will make you prickly<br>
    and so spoil your taste for me,<br>
  <i>and you must taste good for me!<br>
    Yum-yum! my tasty tea!<br>
    My scrumptious, umptious tea!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to taste good! Let me out!&rdquo; wept Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t fuss! I do dislike a fussy meal,&rdquo;  said the
    ant lion.</p>
  <p>But Algy fussed and struggled. &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Ant
    there! Ant there! Ant there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Its no use shouting. Nothing can save you,&rdquo;  said the ant lion.</p>
  <p>But Algy went on shouting, &ldquo;Ant there! Ant there!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then, oh <i>then</i>&mdash;over the tops of the grasses, through the
    clover, in between the pebbles and way down even into the great trap of the
    ant lion, came floating a voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ant here!&rdquo; shouted the voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Some ant heard me!&rdquo; cried Algy and, looking up, he
    saw the face of an ant peering down at him from over the brink of the hole. &ldquo;Oh,
    please get me out of here, good kind ant!&rdquo; pleaded Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, if it isn&rsquo;t that young Algernon from our nest! And he&rsquo;s
    fallen into the pit of an ant lion!&rdquo; cried the ant. And soon dozens
    and dozens of ants came swarming and storming round the brink of the hole
    until Algy could see a whole frill of ant faces hanging over the rim and
    staring down at him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh please, please get me out of here!&rdquo; cried Algy, again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If we try to get you out, we might all fall in,&rdquo;  said the
    first ant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you will try, won&rsquo;t you? Nurse told me ants always help
    each other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll help you! But first, we&rsquo;ll have to work out
    a plan how to do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! Let them try to help you&mdash;that&rsquo;s just what I want.&rdquo; growled
    the ant lion, smacking his lips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll burrow my shovel-shaped
    head in the sand and send it swishing round and round like a whirlpool, so
    that no one can stand up in it. Aha! I toss my head round, and that tosses
    the sand, and the tossing sand tosses these ants down here to me, and then
    I toss them into my mouth and gobble them up. Yum, yum! Let them all come!
    But first I&rsquo;ll eat <i>you!</i>&rdquo; And the ant lion made a grab
    at Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help! Help! Help!&rdquo; screamed Algy, making his voice as loud
    as he could to that the ants way up on top of the hole could hear him.</p>
  <p>And way up on top of the hole, the first ant said to the other ants, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
    thought of a plan, mates. Quick! Make a living chain!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A living chain! A living chain! A living chain!&rdquo;  chanted the
    others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, first every ant must take hold of the ant next to him by his
    mandibles,&rdquo; said the first ant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; agreed the ants, all clutching hold of each other,
    so that the second ant held the first ant, and the third ant held the second
    ant, and the fourth ant held the third ant, and so on, until all together
    they had made one long living chain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; said the first ant. &ldquo;Now let the
    ant at the end of the chain take a firm hold of a grass stem...got it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got it!&rdquo; said the end ant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the first ant. &ldquo;Now I am the tip of your
    chain. And we must stretch out so that we swing right down into the pit.
    And don&rsquo;t forget, we must all keep hold of each other very, very tightly,
    so that our chain doesn&rsquo;t break! Are you all ready&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; shouted the ants.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, over the edge with me!&rdquo; cried the first ant. And over
    the edge, and down, down, <i>down</i> into the ant lions big sandy hole went
    the first ant&mdash;and the second ant&mdash;and the third ant, and so on,
    until the last ant, at the end of the chain, had to hold very, very tightly
    indeed to the grass stem; because he knew if he let it go, even for a second,
    all the ants would go reeling, head-over-heeling down into the hole, and
    be gobbled up by the ant lion.</p>
  <p>Then the first ant, who was at the head of the chain, stretched out his
    mandibles, and caught hold of Algy by his horns.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right now, Algy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    got you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the ant lion&rsquo;s got me, too!&rdquo; cried Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kick him and make him let you go!&rdquo; said the first ant. So Algy
    bent his legs, then shot them out again as hard as ever he could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ouch! Kick me with your six feet, would you, Ant?&rdquo; wheezed
    the ant lion, doubling up and making a face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I would,&rdquo; Algy cried out loudly, for the ants were pulling
    him up, up, up, so that by this time he was almost at the top of the hole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha, they can try to pull you out, but I&rsquo;ll soon have them all
    in,&rdquo; roared the ant lion. &ldquo;Just wait till I get my whirlpool
    of sand swirling! That&rsquo;ll cut the ground from beneath their feet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oooh, I&rsquo;m getting pelted with sand!&rdquo; cried Algy. &ldquo;Were
    all getting pelted with sand!&rdquo; gasped the first ant. But don&rsquo;t
    let our chain break, mates! Remember:</p>
  <p class="note">Through good and bad, through thick and thin,<br>
    You never see an ant give in.</p>
  <p>So pull, mates! Pull! Pull! Pull!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pull!&mdash;Pull!&mdash;Pull!&rdquo; echoed the ants. And they pulled
    and pulled and pulled until Algy was right up out of the hole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got him out. He&rsquo;s saved!&rdquo; cried the first
    ant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you all a great biggest big thanks for saving me!&rdquo; said
    Algy giving each of them a smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Algernon,&rdquo; said the first ant. &ldquo;But
    after this be careful of lion pits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are there many of them about?&rdquo; asked Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lots and lots. Often an ant, travelling alone, has fallen into one
    and has never been heard from again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ooh!&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;I fell into one, but you soon heard
    from <i>me!</i> I shouted!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said the first ant. &ldquo;And now, mates.
    let&rsquo;s get back to the nest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go home yet,&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;Not till I find
    my load of melon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, was that <i>your</i> melon? We found it under a bluebell just
    before we heard you call.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got my melon!&rdquo; cried Algy, skipping about joyfully. &ldquo;Oh,
    hurrah! hurrah! Now I can show Nursey that I can go out hunting for food
    and bring it back without even taking one lick, and I&rsquo;ll tell her I
    met the great biggest big lion and&mdash;and kicked him! Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, then!&rdquo; said the first ant. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s up with
    our loads and make for home!&rdquo; So each ant hoisted his bundle of straw,
    or grass, or stick, or leaf, or food, over his shoulder and made for home,
    chanting as he marched along:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;After we roam<br>
    we turn back home<br>
    to find our nest,<br>
    and it is best.<br>
    Home&mdash;home&mdash;home&mdash;home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hurrah! There&rsquo;s Nursey at the door of our nest. We&rsquo;re
    nearly there!&rdquo; cried Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Home! Home! Home! Home!&rdquo; chanted the ants, &ldquo;Home! Home!
    Home!&rdquo;</p>

    Algy Gets A Surprise</b></h2>
  <p>IT was very, very early in the morning&mdash;so early that Algy and all
    the other ants were asleep&mdash;and the sun was only just beginning to shine,
    and the first kookaburra only just beginning to laugh.</p>
  <p>The sentinels were the first to stir. They opened their eyes, stood up on
    their three pairs of legs, gave themselves a good lick, and began to open
    the doors to the nest. Soon all the other ants arose and began to sing to
    the air of &ldquo;The Campbells Are Coming&rdquo;:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;A new day is dawning, hurrah! hurrah!<br>
    A new day is dawning, hurrah! hurrah!<br>
    We&rsquo;ve worked for this morning,<br>
    so rise without yawning.<br>
    A new day is dawning, hurrah! hurrah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wake up, Algy, wake up,&rdquo; cried Nurse, giving him a gentle shake.
    Algy yawned, and yawned, and yawned. &ldquo;My, you were fast asleep,&rdquo; said
    Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Nursey, I wasn&rsquo;t fast asleep&mdash;only loosely,&rdquo;  said
    Algy. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m widest wide awake now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you have a wash and a brush down, and then I&rsquo;ve a surprise
    for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oooh! I like surprises&mdash;I mean the nice ones,&rdquo;  said Algy,
    hopping up and down on his six feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, be quick! For I must hurry and help take the eggs out on to
    the top of the nest,&rdquo; said Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do all you nurses take the eggs out every morning, Nursey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, to let the sun warm them and hatch them, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t leave them out in the sun, Nursey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. When the roof gets too hot, we carry them down into the warm
    hatching-room just under it. Then later, when the sun is high and the first
    hatching room has grown too hot, we carry them down to a lower room, where
    the air is cooler, and when that gets too hot, we carry them to a still lower
    room, and so on&mdash;all through the day. For, although we must keep the
    eggs warm, we mustn&rsquo;t let them get too hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, I&rsquo;m washed!&rdquo; cried Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you quite clean? Let me give you an extra lick! Stand still!
    Any ant would think you were a baby reptile the way you wriggle. Oh, stand
    still! You&rsquo;re as jumpy as a frog. There! Give yourself a brush down
    with your spurs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m brushed. Now for your surprise, Nursey!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, now that the sentinels have opened the doors you can go out.&rdquo; said
    Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the surprise, Nursey!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know that when you go out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know what happened last time?&rdquo; said Algy darkly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You mean about the old ant lion catching you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean about me getting away from him, and kicking him,&rdquo; giggled
    Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, you&rsquo;re certainly braver than you were, Algy. If
    only your memory were better and you liked working, you&rsquo;d be a first-rate
    little antling. Ah, here come the workers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The workers were all marching along the passages towards the open doors
    of the nest, chanting:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve work to do<br>
    and we&rsquo;ll do it, too!<br>
    Keep on and on<br>
    till we get through.<br>
    Work&mdash;work&mdash;work&mdash;work<br>
    Work&mdash;work&mdash;work&mdash;work&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go with them, Algy,&rdquo; said Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I went last time,&rdquo; said Algy, &ldquo;and you know what
    I did. I found a great biggest big speck of melon, and I carried it home&mdash;and
    carried it home&mdash;and carried it home!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did you need to carry it home three times?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, Nursey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why did you say you did?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, Nursey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well Algy, you said, &lsquo;I carried it home, and carried it home,
    and carried it home&mdash;like that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo; said Algy, thinking it out. &ldquo;Well, you see,
    first, I carried it <i>some</i> of the way; next, I carried it <i>more</i> of
    the way, and last, I carried it <i>all</i> of the way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still, I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t say things three times, Algy. It&rsquo;s
    most confusing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Nursey dear. After this, I&rsquo;ll try to say things
    only two times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once would be enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll try to say everything only once times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Work&mdash;work&mdash;work&mdash;work!&rdquo; chanted the workers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The workers are leaving the nest.&rdquo; cried Nurse.  &ldquo;Quick!
    Go with them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Nursey&mdash;but, Nursey&mdash;I don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You were born to be a worker. Algy, so if you are a good ant, you
    will work. Now what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;think I <i>am</i> a good ant,&rdquo; said Algy, very
    slowly.</p>
  <p>Nurse was delighted. &ldquo;Yes, I think you are too,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;In
    fact, I notice you&rsquo;re getting better in every way; you&rsquo;re not
    frightened any more, and you don&rsquo;t boast nearly as much as you used
    to, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t forget to remember, do I, Nursey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, even your memory is better than it was,&rdquo;  said Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if I could only like work&mdash;&rdquo; began Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, then you&rsquo;d be a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A first rate little antling,&rdquo; finished Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;Now run along to work, and that surprise
    I spoke of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m running! I&rsquo;m running! I&rsquo;m running!&rdquo; cried
    Algy, but then he remembered Nurse telling him not to say everything three
    times, so he said, &ldquo;I mean &lsquo;I&rsquo;m running&rsquo; just <i>once</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Outside the nest the workers were all marching along beside the garden border,
    looking very, very important. Algy ran after them and at last caught up to
    the end one. &ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;please, where do we work
    today?&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page059.png" width="754" height="731"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;On the third rose-tree to the left,&rdquo; said the worker. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
    going a-milking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A-milking? A-milking what?&rdquo; asked Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ant cows, of course. Would you like to milk, too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two? No, thank you, one would be enough,&rdquo; said Algy, politely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no! I didn&rsquo;t ask if you would like to milk two cows; I
    said would you, <i>too</i>, like to milk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not two; I&rsquo;m only one,&rdquo; said Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh dear! I&rsquo;ll put it this way&mdash;<i>would you like to milk?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milk what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A <i>cow!</i>&rdquo;  screamed the worker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Milk a cow?&rdquo; cried Algy, smiling, &ldquo;Oh, yes! Oh, yes!
    Oh, yes!&mdash;er, I mean, &lsquo;Oh, yes!&rsquo; just <i>once</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All this time, Algy and the workers had been hurrying down the garden border,
    under the grass of a strip of lawn, over the soil and pebbles of a flower
    garden, and up the stem of the third rose-tree. Now suddenly they all stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; the worker told Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! We&rsquo;re at the tippety-top of the rose-tree. Oooh, and
    look at all those little green animals on the rose-stem!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those are the cows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I like cows,&rdquo; said Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we ants all do,&rdquo; said the worker. &ldquo;But human people
    don&rsquo;t care for them because they eat the fresh shoots of rose-trees.
    Human people call the cows &lsquo;aphides&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look, look! They&rsquo;re eating now,&rdquo; said Algy. pointing
    at the cows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re sucking the sap from the rose-stems. Time to begin
    our milking. See underneath this first cow, a drop of liquid forming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I see it,&rdquo; said Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is the honey-dew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did it get there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the cow pumps sap from the rose-tree, the sap passes through
    it and oozes out as honey-dew, and then I&mdash;do&mdash;this!&rdquo; said
    the worker. and he caught the drop of honey-dew in his open sac. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    how we milk our cows. You try it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no drop there, now,&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;You
    took it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then stroke the cow with your horns. Pat him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m patting him&mdash;and&mdash;oh yes, there&rsquo;s another
    drop of honey-dew underneath him. It&rsquo;s ready to drop,&rdquo; cried
    Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then catch it in your sac!&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page061.png" width="601" height="750"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;Yeow! Here I go!&rdquo; shouted Algy, and&mdash;splash!&mdash;he
    caught the drop of honeydew in his sac.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep on stroking your cow and catching the drops, while I milk this
    other one!&rdquo; said the worker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; laughed Algy. And he began to sing to the air of &ldquo;Little
    Brown Jug&rdquo;:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Now I have a cow that gives honey-dew<br>
    I&rsquo;ll pat her gently, wouldn&rsquo;t you?<br>
    I&rsquo;ll stroke her so, in just this way,<br>
    and milk her forty times a day.<br>
    Ha, ha, ha, you and me,<br>
    little green cow don&rsquo;t I love thee!<br>
    Ha, ha, ha, you and me,<br>
    little green cow don&rsquo;t I love thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Algy went on singing and milking happily. Then suddenly he cried, &ldquo;Oh,
    oh, my sac is full!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So is mine.&rdquo; said the worker. &ldquo;We must go home now and
    take the honey-dew. The other milkers are ready to start too,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Home&mdash;home&mdash;home&mdash;home,&rdquo; chanted the workers
    as they marched back to the nest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Home&mdash;home&mdash;home!&rdquo; shouted Algy.</p>
  <p>Nurse was very pleased to see Algy return home without any mishap. &ldquo;Did
    you have a good time?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, Nursey! We&rsquo;ve been having a most splendiferous time.
    We&rsquo;ve been milking ant cows. And when our sacs were full of honey-dew,
    we came back to the nest, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did you do with the honey-dew?&rdquo; asked Nurse.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We shared it among all the ants who hadn&rsquo;t milked,&rdquo; answered
    Algy. &lsquo;With the engineers, and surveyors, our nurses, and miners, and
    foragers, and masons and all the other workers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you enjoyed working, didn&rsquo;t you, Algy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Working? I haven&rsquo;t been working, Nursey. I&rsquo;ve just been
    a-milking, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was work,&rdquo; said Nurse.</p>
  <p>Algy opened his eyes very wide. &ldquo;Was it? Oh, was it? Then I&rsquo;m
    really a worker who works? Oh, Nursey, and work&rsquo;s just lovely, after
    all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nurse chuckled, and Algy went on, &ldquo;But, Nursey, although I found that
    work could be fun, I didn&rsquo;t find your surprise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes you did, Algy. That was my surprise&mdash;that work can be fun!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! That is a surprise!&rdquo; cried Algy; and his voice cracked
    and split in two with amazement. &ldquo;That <i>is</i> a surprise!!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ChapterEight"></a>Chapter Eight<br>
  The Marriage Flight</b></h2>
  <p>ONE evening towards the end of August, all the ants began to shake and quiver
    all over with excitement; and when Algy asked the reason why, Nurse answered, &ldquo;Algy,
    Algy, don&rsquo;t you know what day it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Nursey, it&rsquo;s either Monday or Friday, but I think it&rsquo;s
    Wednesday,&rdquo; said Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s <i>wedding</i> day!&rdquo; cried Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Algy. &ldquo;So <i>that&rsquo;s</i> why we&rsquo;re
    all tippy-toe. Are we all getting married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;Workers never get married, only
    the ants with wings marry. Come along! hurry up and see the couples depart
    on their honeymoon. The workers wish them to swarm before the sun sets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Nursey, I&rsquo;ll hurry.&rdquo; said Algy. And he said it only
    once, and hurried along after Nurse to where the workers were opening the
    doors of the nest to let the men and women ants go out.</p>
  <p>Algy could easily tell the men ants from the women, because they were smaller
    and had larger eyes: and he could tell both the men and the women from the
    workers because they had wings.</p>
  <p>But Nurse said, &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t have their wings for long, now that
    they&rsquo;re to be married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo; shouted the workers, pushing the men and
    women out of doors.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do the workers have to push them?&rdquo; Algy asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    the men and women <i>want</i> to be married?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, they want to be married; but they&rsquo;re not used to doing
    things for themselves,&rdquo; said Nurse. &ldquo;You see, they&rsquo;ve never
    worked or ever done anything useful in their lives before: the workers have
    always managed things for them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo; cried the workers dragging the lagging brides
    and bridegrooms outside.</p>
  <p>Algy and Nurse ran outside, too. And there they saw lots of men and women
    ants getting ready for their marriage flight. They spread their wings and,
    for a good take-off, they climbed to the top of leaves and grasses and stood
    there on tip-toe, quivering and shivering with excitement. As they spread
    them, the gauzy wings crackled. Algy thought how beautiful they looked with
    the sun shining through them, shimmering and gleaming like bright bits of
    rainbow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The men ants seem even more excited than the women ants,&rdquo; he
    said to Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;This is what they were born and reared
    for&mdash;this marriage flight. Listen to them!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So Algy listened while the men ants chanted:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;For this we were born,<br>
    for this we shall die,<br>
    all our lives were for this&mdash;<br>
    let us fly&mdash;fly&mdash;fly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then the women ants answered:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;For this we were born,<br>
    to serve, not to die;<br>
    this our destiny&mdash;<br>
    so fly&mdash;fly&mdash;fly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Nurse. &ldquo;they&rsquo;re going to swarm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All the winged ants were rising into the air, waving their fine filmy wings,
    through which the sun shone even more beautifully than before. Up, up, up,
    they flew, and away, away till Algy could not see them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve flown away on their marriage flight.&rdquo;  said Nurse. &ldquo;And
    now it&rsquo;s getting dark. It&rsquo;s time you were in bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The next morning Algy awoke early as a bird, and ran outside to see if the
    men and women ants had returned from their honeymoon. But there was no sign
    of them.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><img src="2100211h-images/page065.png" width="600" height="540"></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;The men don&rsquo;t return,&rdquo; Nurse explained, &ldquo;and only
    some of the women.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How many women?&rdquo; asked Algy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as many as the workers need to lay the eggs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But only queens can lay eggs, Nursey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. After the marriage flight the women become queens.
    Some of them fly away to new nests of their own: and some of them come back
    here to lay the eggs that our new baby ants will be hatched from.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Queen Emmet lays all our eggs, Nursey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but Queen Emmet is growing old, Algy. She has laid thousands
    and thousands of eggs and now she is getting tired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tired&mdash;tired&mdash;tired!&rdquo; said a dreary, weary voice.
    Turning round, Algy saw a very large ant, and knew at once that it was Queen
    Emmet, for she was the largest ant in the whole nest. She had come outside
    for a moment, to see what was going on, but now several of the workers ran
    to her and, catching hold of her in their mandibles, led her back into the
    nest again.</p>
  <p>The queen sighed, but went quietly with the workers; and as she went, little
    round white things dropped from her body. These were eggs, so the nurses
    were quick to gather them up and carry them off to the nurseries.</p>
  <p>Algy heard the queen mumbling to herself, so he crept up close to hear what
    she said. This is what he heard:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a queen&mdash;<br>
    what&rsquo;s that mean?<br>
    Fourteen years old,<br>
    yet I do as I&rsquo;m told.<br>
    And I work&mdash;how I work!<br>
    I never must shirk.<br>
    Each night and each day<br>
    I lay&mdash;and I lay.<br>
    A whole generation<br>
    is my creation;<br>
    yet if I dare rest,<br>
    every ant in the nest<br>
    will fidget, and beg,<br>
  &lsquo;<i>Just one more egg!</i>&rsquo;</p>
  <p class="note">I&rsquo;m fourteen years old,<br>
  yet I do as I&rsquo;m told.<br>
  If I stroll through a door<br>
  I&rsquo;ll be circled, for sure,<br>
  by swarms who will say,<br>
&lsquo;Come home now, don&rsquo;t stray!&rsquo;</p>
  <p class="note">Yet I&rsquo;m proud as can be<br>
  of my industry.<br>
  A whole generation<br>
  is my creation.<br>
  So each night, each day<br>
  I shall lay, lay, and lay&mdash;<br>
  lay&mdash;and lay&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And fat old Queen Emmet wandered off, still laying and laying.</p>
  <p>Suddenly there was a great shout from the workers outside. Algy guessed
    it must be the new queens returning to the nest. And it was. In they came
    through an open door led by the workers, who at once began to tear off their
    lovely bridal wings, for the little queens would never fly again. From now
    on they would do as Queen Emmet did; and they began at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I must go and help gather up those new eggs,&rdquo;  said Nurse. &ldquo;What
    a pile of them already!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Nursey,&rdquo; said Algy, &ldquo;you know the more eggs there
    are, the more little antlings will be hatched from them. And the more little
    antlings that are hatched, the more workers there will be to build a bigger
    and better nest, and to care for us all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My!&rdquo; smiled Nurse. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the right idea at
    last, Algy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve another idea, Nursey. I&rsquo;ve the idea to help
    you with the eggs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Algy! It isn&rsquo;t your job to look after the eggs,&rdquo; said
    Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, my real job is to forage for food and to milk the ant cows,&rdquo; said
    Algy, feeling very big and important. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s such fun, milking,
    Nursey. We&rsquo;re going milking again today&mdash;on the fourth rose-tree
    in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just then the milkers came marching down the passage towards the open door,
    and chanting as they came:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;To work! To work!<br>
    To work! To work!<br>
    We&rsquo;ve work to do,<br>
    and we do it, too!<br>
    One for all, and all for one&mdash;<br>
that&rsquo;s the way to get things done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Algy!&rdquo; cried Nurse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye. Nursey dear! See you this evening!&rdquo;  And Algy ran
    off to work, singing.</p>
  <p>And here we leave Algy Ant busy and gay: you&rsquo;ll see him at work in
    your garden all day, and though you can&rsquo;t hear as he hurries along
    you know he&rsquo;ll be singing the same little song:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;One for all and all for one&mdash;<br>
  that&rsquo;s the way to get things done.&rdquo;</p>
