</h2>

<p>The following Tales&mdash;like the first series, issued in
December, 1935&mdash;have their settings in the Dandenong Hills.
The reasons, as set forth in the first story&mdash; &ldquo;Nellie
Moir&rdquo;&mdash;may be here re-stated:&mdash;</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;There is always something doing in the
Hills. Amid the Hills the human heart beats stronger and the mind
is more alert. Though they seem to brood, to doze, they are none
the less awake to all that matters. From every peak and shoulder
there is to be seen another view, and, to those who have eyes to
see and ears to hear, there is much more to be noted than can be
imagined. Their variety is measureless. Within their depths and on
their heights it is the unexpected that always happens. Surprise
lurks everywhere, and there is no manner of man who cannot be taken
unawares.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No copies of this booklet will be offered for sale, the whole
edition having been reserved for distribution amongst friends.</p>

<p>If any reader cares to express an opinion, it would be esteemed
a favour to receive a letter saying which Tale was liked the
better.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">THE CHARACTERS IN THESE STORIES ARE
FICTITIOUS</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="SimpleSimon" id=

</h2>

<p>&ldquo;So! Misther Detective there&rsquo;s the case! And if
ye&rsquo;ll go out to Jimmy Cowan&rsquo;s place ye&rsquo;ll see a
pair of Mary McArdle&rsquo;s shoes, and if I&rsquo;m not
mistaken&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the story had better begin at a point from whence the
narrative may proceed in orderly fashion to its natural conclusion.
In this case, perhaps, the most appropriate thing to do is to first
introduce the speaker of the opening words, for he is the central
character, and plays a prominent part in the events that are about
to be recorded.</p>

<p>Simon Slowe was what is known as &ldquo;a character!&rdquo;
There are several types to which this expressive phrase can be
applied, but in his case&mdash;owing to his attributes and
peculiarities&mdash;it was a particularly apt appelative. Because
of them he would have been noticeable anywhere, but in the limited
community of Gembrook he stood out in contrast with the rest. In
short, he was an oddity; but with such an amount of what is called
&ldquo;commonsense&rdquo; that, despite his mannerisms and
eccentricities, he was the first to be consulted in a
difficulty.</p>

<p>In person, Simon Slowe was fairly tall and slightly
round-shouldered. His face was weather-beaten and wrinkled, and
might have been considered ugly but for the shrewd intelligence
that gleamed in his kindly eyes. A quaint and whimsical method of
expression added a touch of humour to his searching glance, and
there was the suggestion of a faint and far-off brogue in the tones
of his voice.</p>

<p>From whence he had come originally no one knew for certain.
There were those who asserted that the North of Ireland had been
his birth-place. They based their belief on the fact that he was
wont to say &ldquo;ye&rdquo; for &ldquo;you,&rdquo; and pronounced
the word &ldquo;many&rdquo; as if it were spelt
&ldquo;man-ny.&rdquo; To all enquiries as to what country he came
from he invariably replied: &ldquo;From God&rsquo;s own
Country&rdquo;; and left it at that. Nor did anyone dare to
question him further, for there was a note of finality in his tone
that never failed to silence the enquirer.</p>

<p>As to his means, also, there was considerable speculation. The
general assumption was that he must either be a pensioner or have
some secret source of income which not even the most knowing
amongst them could discover. They scorned the idea that he could
maintain himself by the sale of the few curiosities he garnered
from the bush and the creeks. And, as enquirers never gained the
knowledge they sought, the riddle of his sustenance added to the
mystery that wrapped him round. On his side&mdash;although
inordinately curious&mdash;he was not given to asking personal
questions. Yet&mdash;as Mrs. Scott remarked to Mrs. McArdle:
&ldquo;He seems to know everything about everybody, and he never
forgets a thing you tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this stage it is appropriate to mention that Simon Slowe was
extraordinarily observant. Nothing escaped his notice, from the
direction being taken by the wind-driven clouds above to the least
movement of bird or beast amid the bush below. Strange
conformations and singular markings he was able to see&mdash;and
perhaps slightly emphasise&mdash; in all manner of things. In his
house were sticks and stones and roots; feathers and eggs and
bark&mdash;besides other bush curios&mdash;every item of which had
some distinctive feature.</p>

<p>Held by him in a certain way a water-worn pebble from the creek
would disclose a fairy face of delicate beauty. A wood-knot he had
placed upon a little stand looked like a crouching gnome. With the
stem of his pipe&mdash;as he moved it from point to point over the
surface of a speckled egg&mdash;he would trace a miniature
representation of the Southern Cross. Amongst other
treasures&mdash;and one with which he could not be induced to
part&mdash;was a collection of twenty-six roots, of varying shapes,
that he called: &ldquo;The Trees&rsquo; Alphabet.&rdquo; When
showing these to child visitors he used to solemnly observe that
&ldquo;the trees, ye see, have learned their A, B, C, and
ye&rsquo;s had better be careful what ye say in the
bush!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In some respects Simon Slowe belied his name. He could, on
occasion, be as quick as most&mdash;and as sure. What he knew, he
knew! Any statement he made was never known to be successfully
disputed. He admitted having had &ldquo;some schooling as a child
but his accuracy was not due to any special educational training.
Most of his knowledge was self-acquired, and not the result of
teaching or verbally imparted instruction. The books he read and
re-read were few in number, and, as a consequence, no one could be
more certain of their contents. It was said that he was so
conversant with certain chapters of the Bible that he could quote
them flawlessly, and in the whole of that great Book he was very
well versed.</p>

<p>In this respect his almost uncanny knowledge was sharply
illustrated on one well remembered occasion. Peter Smith, the
butcher, was telling of how he had been shown over Parliament
House, Melbourne, and of what he had seen there. Amongst other
listeners, Simon Slowe was not the least attentive. Yet all were
deeply interested, for none of them had ever seen anything more
than the outside of Victoria&rsquo;s Legislative Buildings; and
they were unusually silent as Peter described the Queen&rsquo;s
Hall; the Chambers in which the Members sat; the Library; and other
features that had caught his notice.</p>

<p>Enjoying the marked appreciation with which his narrative was
being received, Peter came to an enthusiastic conclusion by
saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in the Front Hall, in a great circle round the Royal
Coat of Arms worked in colored tiles on the floor, is a verse from
the Bible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;De ye remember the verse?&rdquo; enquired Simon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes! I think I do! One of our party walked around the
circle and read it aloud! What it says is: &ldquo;In the multitude
of Counsellors there is wisdom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let me tell ye its not correct!&rdquo; retorted
Simon in his soft voice. &ldquo;I know nothing about the Coat of
Arms worked in colored tiles, but I can tell ye that King Solomon
was too wise a man to say any such thing. What he said was:
&lsquo;Where no Counsel is the people fail; but in the multitude of
Counsellors there is safety.&rdquo; And those of ye who care to
look at your Bibles&mdash;&rdquo; (and he gave them chapter and
verse&mdash;Proverbs XI., 14)&mdash;&ldquo;can see for yourselves
that the word is &lsquo;safety&rsquo; and not
&lsquo;wisdom&rsquo;.&rdquo; He added in his whimsical way:
&ldquo;Wisdom is individual. Mankind, in the mass, is very unwise.
Parliament represents the mass. It may do things that are safe; but
whoever heard of it doing anything that was wise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which last remark would seem to indicate that Simon really was
an Irishman, and &ldquo;agin the Government!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to his nickname &ldquo;Simple&rdquo; Simon, a word or two may
be added. Strange as it may seem, it was out of his absolute
accuracy that Simon Slowe came to be dubbed &ldquo;Simple&rdquo;
Simon. Yet, so it was, for in deprecation of any praise bestowed
upon him, he invariably remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis simple! &rsquo;Tis very simple! Observe and
note! Knowledge mostly comes from what ye see and hear. If ye see
rightly, of if ye hear rightly, ye cannot make a misstatement,
<b>if ye tell the truth!</b> &rsquo;Tis them that don&rsquo;t
really see or hear the thing aright that leads others astray. They
only <b>think</b> they saw the things they talk about. Man-ny a
good man&rsquo;s lost his liberty because somebody didn&rsquo;t see
what he thought he saw. &rsquo;Tis just seeing and hearing,
that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, in himself, so perfectly trained were these two senses that
he could&mdash;without looking, and without mistake&mdash;name the
bird that flew over his head or the animal that moved in the
scrub!</p>

<p align="center">* * * *</p>

<p>But Simon Slowe was not unobservant of other things. To the
confusion of the thief&mdash;and the wonder of others&mdash; it was
his faculty of accurate observation that enabled him to name the
person who had robbed the till at Mrs. Scott&rsquo;s little
store.</p>

<p>Simon arrived just after that trusting soul had discovered her
loss. She was greatly distressed thereat, and, amid sobs and tears,
told him her story. She had gone out to feed the fowls, knowing
that, as usual, she would be called by Tim the milk-boy, who, at
half past seven every morning, sold her&mdash;his only cash
customer&mdash;a day&rsquo;s supply of milk. He had come in due
course&mdash;filled her jug&mdash;given her the expected
call&mdash;and then waited for her to come and pay him in the
accustomed way. To her dismay&mdash;when she opened the till it was
quite empty!</p>

<p>For a moment she thought that perhaps Tim was playing a trick on
her, and she had jokingly accused him of hiding her money. But he
most solemnly assured her that he hadn&rsquo;t got it, and she
could search him if she liked! Thinking then that he might be
teasing her, she actually did step round the counter with the
intention of going through his pockets, but, as he immediately came
forward opening his jacket for the examination, she felt that he
had told her the truth, and that somebody else must have slipped in
unawares and got away with the cash before he entered the
store.</p>

<p>When Simon Slowe could calm Mrs. Scott a little, he asked how
much money there had been in the drawer and how it was made up. She
knew exactly. There were two one pound notes, three half
sovereigns, sixteen shillings in silver and fourteen pence in
copper. In reply to a further question she said: &ldquo;Yes! I am
quite certain of the several amounts. You see, my takings are so
small that, after each sale, I just add the new sums on, and so I
always know how much I have in hand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Simon, &ldquo;that settles it! Tim has
your money, although he says he hasn&rsquo;t, and if ye&rsquo;ll
come with me I&rsquo;ll get it back for ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only too eager to recover her cash, the shop was closed and they
set off at once. As every detail of Tim&rsquo;s round was known to
them, they simply made for the place where they expected to see
him; and they were not disappointed. Simon straight away demanded
the return of Mrs. Scott&rsquo;s money; but Tim stoutly denied that
he had it, and, as before, offered himself to be searched.</p>

<p>At this&mdash;not unexpected&mdash;offer, Simon looked steadily
into the boy&rsquo;s eyes, but, as the youngster did not flinch
beneath his gaze, he shook his head and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So! I&rsquo;ll not search ye, for I wouldn&rsquo;t find
it! But come back to the house ye have just left and we&rsquo;ll
see what Mrs. Johnson can do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tim went willingly; depositing his milk-can at the back door
before stepping into the kitchen with the others. Mrs. Johnson
looked surprised at their entry, but, in his quiet way, Simon
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have just come inside to make a little investigation;
and we want your help. Have ye got such a thing as a clean wash
basin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Johnson replied that she had, and, at Simon&rsquo;s
request, it was brought from the bed-room and placed upon the
kitchen table. He then asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are ye fairly strong, Mrs. Johnson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She nodded a &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! Will you please lift in the milk-can that Tim left
outside, and pour the milk into the wash basin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words Tim made a spring for the door, but Simon,
anticipating the move, swiftly gripped him by the arm arid held him
fast. Then, without appearing to take any notice of the
youth&rsquo;s efforts to free himself, he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pour very carefully, Mrs. Johnson, for I don&rsquo;t want
ye to tip into the basin the parcel of money that&rsquo;s at the
bottom of the can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later on, when pressed to say how he knew the cash was in the
can, Simon made something like his usual reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas very simple! &rsquo;Twas only a matter of
seeing aright. When I went into Mrs. Scott&rsquo;s store to buy
some tobacco I saw several spots of milk about. They were not drips
but splashes. I was sure of that because drips&mdash; though they
might drop on the floor&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t fall upon the upright
face of the counter! Such carelessness was not like Tim, for, often
as I have seen him measuring out the milk, I have never seen him
splash any of it about. So, when Mrs. Scott told me her till had
been rifled, I immediately suspected Tim; but when she added that
he had offered to let her search him I was certain that he was the
thief&mdash; and what he had done with the money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What he did&mdash;as ye now know&mdash;was to take it out
of the drawer, wrap the silver and copper into the notes and then
roll the lot into a piece of paper and drop the parcel into the
milk-can. Unfortunately for him&mdash;in his hurry&mdash;it was the
weight of the parcel, and the sudden way he let it fall into the
can, that made the milk splash the counter and spot the floor. As
ye see, &rsquo;twas all very simple to make out, for Tim wrote his
name ye might say, in the milk marks he left on the front of the
counter.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>The exposure of Tim&rsquo;s trick, and the recovery of Mrs.
Scott&rsquo;s stolen money had been the means of establishing Simon
Slowe&rsquo;s reputation. From that time forth he was consulted on
all manner of matters where observation and reason were required to
solve local riddles. He it was who gave the right direction for the
finding of Danny Kelly&rsquo;s calf; and he it was who named the
canine culprit that was eating the eggs laid by Mrs.
McArdle&rsquo;s hens.</p>

<p>It was therefore only natural&mdash;when the great event
occurred&mdash;and the detectives were trying to unravel the
mystery of how Peter Smith, the butcher, met his death&mdash; that
Simon Slowe should be repeatedly asked to express an opinion. But
Simon kept his own counsel and refused to be drawn.</p>

<p>Early on a Saturday afternoon, in May, Peter went with his
sister to Melbourne. Peter was a bachelor and Lily kept house for
him. Once in a while, however, she would leave him to fend for
himself from one afternoon to the next, the while she went to have
what she termed &ldquo;a little break in the city.&rdquo; On this
occasion he accompanied her, it being his intention to spend an
hour or more at the football match between Carlton and Collingwood.
He returned about half past eight o&rsquo;clock the same evening,
and, as those who saw him were able to state&mdash;&ldquo;a good
deal the worse for liquor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amongst others who had seen him thus was &ldquo;handy&rdquo;
Jimmy Cowans. Jimmy was one of those oddities who are to be found
in out-of-the-way corners of the world. They constitute a class by
themselves, and their ways of getting a living are as varied as
their peculiarities. Cowans was of the inoffensive type; shy,
silent and reserved. He was not exactly a &ldquo;half-wit,&rdquo;
although he was not &ldquo;all there.&rdquo; It was only in some
respects that he was a little short of normal. In others he was
sharp, intelligent and reliable. For instance, he was particularly
clever in the use of tools &mdash;of which he had a
number&mdash;and in the mending of boots or broken things he was
regarded as a wonder. He lived, with his mother, in a little
cottage not far from Peter Smith&rsquo;s shop, behind which, at the
top of a gentle rise, stood the Smith&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>How it came to pass that Jimmy saw Peter was easily explained.
Peter had given him a little job to do. One of his large knives had
wooden sides to its handle, and one of these sides had split in two
and fallen away from the rivets. It was Jimmy&rsquo;s task to fit
on a new piece of wood. The repaired handle was to be ready on the
Saturday, and, though drunk, Peter remembered the promise and so
called for the knife on his way home. It was ready, and Peter had
taken it away in his hand, unwrapped.</p>

<p>As will be disclosed, these matters were to play a prominent
part in the final stages of the police enquiry. The
knife&mdash;stained with blood&mdash;was found upon a small table
in Peter&rsquo;s room, where Peter himself&mdash;with his throat
cut&mdash;lay dead on his bed. So was he discovered by his sister
Lily on her return from Melbourne on the Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>At first, suicide was suspected&mdash;then murder. But as
nothing in the house had been disturbed, and nothing stolen,
opinion was sharply divided. If Peter had taken his own life it was
impossible to believe that, after using the knife for that purpose,
he had calmly laid it on the nearby table. Moreover, the point was
toward the bed, which suggested that he must have used his left
hand: a ridiculous assumption seeing that he was a right handed
man. On the other hand, if murder had been committed, the fact that
his watch and chain&mdash;and his sovereign case with three
sovereigns in it&mdash;as well as the money in his pockets were all
untouched, was proof that robbery was not the motive.</p>

<p>Was there a motive? If so, what was it? Enquiries by the
detective in charge of the case elicited the fact that Peter had
greatly desired to take Mary McArdle to wife. But Mary would have
none of him, prosperous as he was, and, in some respects, a
desirable man for a husband. Her aversion angered him, and on
several occasions Mrs. McArdle had found Mary in tears over his
behaviour. The old lady naturally sided with her daughter, and it
was recorded that, three or four times at least, she had been heard
to say that what Peter wanted &ldquo;was a good hiding!&rdquo; It
was also alleged that she had more than once said: &ldquo;One of
these days I&rsquo;ll give him a smack on the head that&rsquo;ll
knock sense into it!&rdquo; Some such remarks she admitted having
made the night before his death.</p>

<p>This led to the very serious questioning of Mrs. McArdle and her
daughter Mary; but nothing came of it. They were able to prove
beyond all question that, on the Saturday night, two of their next
door neighbors had joined them in a game of cards, and that the
visitors had not departed until after ten o&rsquo;clock. The
friends said that it was eleven when they went to bed. Still
unsatisfied, the detective called again the following day and asked
for a pair of Mary&rsquo;s shoes. An hour later she was arrested,
taken to Melbourne, and charged with the murder of Peter Smith.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>The news spread with the rapidity of fire. Within a few
minutes&mdash;or so it seemed&mdash;almost everybody in Gembrook
was standing outside Peter Smith&rsquo;s closed shop, talking about
Mary&rsquo;s arrest. Of course, no one would have it that she had
killed Peter; but the fact that a Melbourne detective thought her
guilty shook the faith in each of them to its foundations. In a
stunned sort of way they sought&mdash; by speech&mdash;to seek
enlightenment and relief, one from another. But, as nothing anyone
said threw the least ray of light upon the situation, they
helplessly dispersed: puzzled and afraid for Mary&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>As soon as Simon Slowe heard the news he came into action. But
there was nothing slow or stunned about the way in which he set to
work. On the contrary, his moves were swift and decisive. Although
he hated the city, and had not paid it a visit for years, to
Melbourne he went; having just time to catch a round-trip motor car
on its way back. Arrived there, without any delay he called upon
the Chief Commissioner of Police&mdash;and, before that officer
could say a word, burst into vehement speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to see that daft detective ye have in charge of
the Gembrook murder case. Man-ny a good man&rsquo;s lost his
liberty because somebody didn&rsquo;t see what he thought he saw!
And now ye be like to lose a good girl her life because ye
can&rsquo;t see past a pair of shoes. Shame on ye! And shame on the
man that&rsquo;s to blame. Bring him to me and I&rsquo;ll tell him
of something he ought to have seen for himself. Get him at
once!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes later, when Detective George Brown appeared, Simon
was still more or less excited. With scarcely an acknowledgment of
Brown&rsquo;s greeting, he broke into the queerest mixture of
questions and statements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So ye found the print of Mary&rsquo;s shoes in the soft
earth did ye?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And ye&rsquo;s thought that that settled the matter I
suppose?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you not take notice that all the foot-prints were
coming away from the house and none were going to it? No! Of course
ye didn&rsquo;t! But I&rsquo;ll defy ye to find the front of
Mary&rsquo;s shoes facing any other way than towards the road! Did
ye think, maybe, that she was carried up to the house, and then
walked away from it? And would ye be after believing that Mary was
twice taken that way up the path&mdash;seeing that there are two
sets of footprints to be seen by them that looks at the marks
aright?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did ye also notice that one set o&rsquo; the heel
marks was deeper than the other? No! Ye didn&rsquo;t, ye bat-eyed
blunderer!&mdash;No! I&rsquo;ll not excuse ye! Wait till I finish.
&mdash;And because ye didn&rsquo;t notice the difference
ye&rsquo;ll be swearing a good girl&rsquo;s life away! Oh!
&rsquo;Tis murder it is!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will ye be past admitting that ye didn&rsquo;t see
the marks of a dog&rsquo;s feet for about half the distance up to
the house?&mdash;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me!&mdash;Tell-tale marks.
Story telling marks if ye were not too cross-eyed to read them! Oh!
&rsquo;Tis an innocent ye&rsquo;ll be after hanging in your
bob-eyed blindness!</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No! Listen to me, Misther Detective Brown, and
I&rsquo;ll tell ye what ye could have found out for yourself, but
what I would not tell ye except to save a life that is better than
the one that must now be lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>And what follows&mdash;reduced to narrative
form&mdash;summarises and sets out the facts and circumstances
which Simon laid before the detective.</p>

<p>When Lily Smith found her brother dead she rushed into the
street screaming the news. Although Simon may not have been the
first to hear her, he was the first to go with her to the house and
see the state of affairs for himself. After a close examination of
all there was to observe, he advised that the place be locked up
and nobody admitted until the police arrived; and that a telephone
message be sent to the Melbourne police at once. These things were
done.</p>

<p>Outside the bedroom Simon also made a very careful examination
of anything and everything that seemed to have a bearing on the
mystery. In particular, he paid special attention to the path
leading from the house to the street. Bending near to the earth, he
closely scrutinised every foot of the way; occasionally nodding his
head as if to confirm his thoughts.</p>

<p>Later, as the result of his observations and reasoning, he came
to certain definite conclusions. The theory of suicide he rejected.
The state of the bed-room; the burnt-out candle; the absence of any
signs of struggle&mdash;and the position of the knife all pointed
to the belief that Peter Smith had been murdered in his sleep.</p>

<p>But who had committed the murder, and why? The answers to those
questions were, as Simon put it, &ldquo;printed on the path.&rdquo;
But he read them one way and the detective another way. On behalf
of the detective, it has to be said, however, that Simon&rsquo;s
larger local knowledge gave him some advantage. He knew, for
instance, that about seven o&rsquo;clock on the evening of the
tragedy, there had been a light fall of rain; lasting for about a
quarter of an hour. This shower had been sufficient to soften the
earth a little. As a result, the imprints of a dog&rsquo;s forepaws
were plainly discernible. The marks extended from the street almost
half way to Smith&rsquo;s house; but, quite singularly, the
imprints of the animal&rsquo;s hind feet were scarcely visible. The
reason for the uneven marking Simon ultimately explained. He was
also able to state that&mdash;from his knowledge of the dogs of the
district&mdash;the marks were undoubtedly made by Jimmy
Cowans&rsquo; terrier!</p>

<p>On the left-hand side of the path going towards the house,
immediately in front of the dog&rsquo;s feet marks, were the
imprints of a pair of shoes. Other markings, made by the same
shoes, were also to be seen on the righthand side of the path; but
no dog&rsquo;s feet marks. Both sets of shoe imprints faced towards
the road. Superficially, it looked as if the wearer had twice
walked from the house to the entrance gate. That was extremely
strange because there was not the slightest trace of any walking to
the house. Stranger still, as Simon realised, the imprints had
unquestionably been made by Mary McArdle&rsquo;s shoes!</p>

<p>It was at this stage that Simon Slowe put on his
&ldquo;considering cap.&rdquo; As the outcome of his thinking he
made some guarded and cautious enquiries. These he followed up with
another and closer examination of the path to Smith&rsquo;s house.
He was then certain of his ground, and, in telling his deductions
to the detective he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye see, the shoe marks on the left side were not nearly
in as straight a line as those on the right, and the heels were
pressed more deeply into the ground. There was also the heavier
imprints of the forepaws of the dog. These things led me to think
that the wearer of the shoes had walked backwards, and that, for a
time, a dog was following up; barking. The barking was due to the
dog thinking that his master was playing a game by walking as he
did. As they got nearer the house it was realised that the noise
made by the dog might waken Peter Smith, who was believed to be
asleep. So, to get rid of the animal a kick was aimed at
him&mdash;(the deeper imprint of the left heel at the place where
the paw marks stop showed that to be the case)&mdash;and he was
ordered home. The reason for walking backwards was to have a clear
view of the road in order to be sure that no one noticed who was
making for Smith&rsquo;s dwelling. Had anyone appeared, whatever
purpose was in mind would at once have been abandoned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next point, as ye can see,&rdquo; said Simon Slowe,
&ldquo;was to discover who did the murder. From the first I knew it
wasn&rsquo;t Mary McArdle. It was some one a little bit heavier.
Then who could have obtained possession of her shoes, and who had
small enough feet to wear them? That was not difficult to determine
after I found out that Mary had left a pair with Jimmy Cowans to
mend. And suspicion grew into a certainty when I saw that the
impressions left on the soft earth were made either by new or
newly-mended shoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So! Misther Detective, there&rsquo;s the case! And if
ye&rsquo;ll go to Jimmy Cowans&rsquo; place, ye&rsquo;ll see a pair
of Mary McArdle&rsquo;s mended shoes; and, if I&rsquo;m not
mistaken, ye&rsquo;ll find the dirt of the walking still on them.
Furthermore, if ye&rsquo;ll get him to put them on&mdash;and then
ask him quietly&mdash;he&rsquo;ll probably tell ye why he did so
before, and how he came to be murdering Peter Smith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simon Slowe&rsquo;s advice was taken, and when Jimmy Cowans told
his story in the dock it was indeed a pitiable one. As pieced
together from the disjointed way in which the facts were elicited,
the pith of it may be reduced to the following brief statement:</p>

<p>He loved Mary McArdle. In his child-like infatuation he resented
Smith&rsquo;s attempts to win Mary for his wife; and he hated him
for the distress he sometimes caused her by his offensive language
and behaviour. He wanted to help Mary, but had not been able to
think how or in what way he could stop Smith from pestering her
with his attentions. For a long time he kept the matter to himself.
At last he became so troubled that he spoke to his mother, hoping
that she might do something, or tell him what to do. All that his
mother had said was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were in Mary McArdle&rsquo;s shoes I would know what
to do with Peter Smith!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In some confused sort of way, Cowans had taken his
mother&rsquo;s words to mean that if he got into Mary&rsquo;s shoes
he would find out how to rid her of Smith&rsquo;s
bullying&mdash;and he acted accordingly. It was the sight of the
candle still burning&mdash;after Smith must have gone to
bed&mdash;which made him think that Smith had fallen into a drunken
sleep; and, although he had thought he might &ldquo;bang Peter on
the head with the candlestick,&rdquo; it was evident that he had no
fixed plan of action in his mind. What he really felt was
that&mdash;with Mary&rsquo;s shoes upon his feet&mdash;he would
know what to do, and could safely have it out with the man he so
intensely disliked. He knew that the butcher&rsquo;s sister was
away from home and that he could never have such a chance again. He
had not taken any weapon with him. The impulse to murder Peter
Smith had come when he found him sound asleep&mdash;and the newly
mended knife lying on the table. He had &ldquo;only wanted to do
Mary a good turn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From which it is clear that it was not intentional murder which
actuated Jimmy Cowans&rsquo;s actions that fatal night. On the
contrary, his sole purpose was to prevent the one he loved from
being further distressed. The jury took the same view and returned
a verdict of &ldquo;murder whilst temporarily insane!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheNurse" id=

<p>&ldquo;HERE&rsquo;S &lsquo;the Nurse,&rsquo; Jack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To hell with &lsquo;the Nurse!&rsquo; I want no woman
messing about me. Get me a Doctor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no Doctor available at present.
We&rsquo;ll get one as soon as we can. The nearest is at Fern Tree

women! They&rsquo;re all the same! Either want to make love to you,
or pass you by as if you didn&rsquo;t exist!&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>The foregoing colloquy took place between Jack Hewitt &mdash;a
Council Foreman engaged upon the roads in the vicinity of
Olinda&mdash;and two fellow employees who chanced to see the
accident that had befallen him.</p>

<p>It was the duty of these men, amongst other things, to cut down
and remove dead or dangerous trees. Hewitt was so expert at the
work that he needed no assistance; and took pride in working alone.
Yet, by one of those unaccountable freaks of Fate, the tree upon
which he had been working creaked and fell before he could get
clear&mdash; with the result that he was badly injured. His shirt
was torn from his back, leaving it scored and bleeding. Luckily,
neither of his arms was hurt; but his left leg was very seriously
torn, and he had received such a smashing blow on the head that his
eyesight was affected and he could not see.</p>

<p>After he had been struck down, the other two men raced to the
fallen tree. They could not see Hewitt, but, by his calls for
assistance, they guessed he must be seriously injured. Within a
couple of minutes they were on the scene and had pulled and cut
away such portions of the tree as pinned him to the ground. Then,
as gently as possible, they lifted and carried him to his own
shack, a little off the roadside, further down the hill. There they
laid him on his bed, and it was whilst they were stanching his
wounds, and otherwise doing the best they could for him, that
Hewitt had spoken so impatiently.</p>

<p>On the way to Hewitt&rsquo;s shack they had met the
butcher&rsquo;s boy, driving around delivering orders. Seeing what
had happened, he agreed without the slightest hesitation to go and
look for &ldquo;The Nurse.&rdquo; Fortunately, she was at home and
agreed to go at once to Hewitt&rsquo;s shack. In point of fact the
readiness of her response was characteristic of her usual
promptitude, for, with everything ready: white overall, bag
containing such first aid things as she might require&mdash;and
bicycle in perfect order, she was never more than a minute or two
behind the messenger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Nurse&rdquo; was Mary Morrison. She had returned from
the Great War&mdash;still quite young&mdash;to find her widowed
mother unexpectedly dead. It was therefore only natural that she
should yield to the desire of her Aunt&mdash;who was waiting to
receive her on arrival&mdash;and go to Olinda &ldquo;for a
rest!&rdquo; The suggestion was also made that she might there
&ldquo;quietly make up her mind as to what she was going to do in
the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mary&rsquo;s mind was already &ldquo;made up&rdquo; as to
employment. It was her full intention to seek a position in one of
the Melbourne hospitals, and carry on with nursing work. And that
is probably what she would have attempted to do had not her Aunt
had another thought upon the subject. That capable woman&mdash;the
wife of an ailing husband&mdash;was the owner of one of those
little hillside stores which are such a God-send to people so
circumstanced. The business was growing a little, and the
indications were that it would further improve. The latter fact,
together with a realisation that she was getting older and could do
with some assistance, suggested the idea that her niece might set
up as a Nurse&mdash;and&mdash;when there was no nursing to do
&mdash;help about the house or in the store.</p>

<p>At first, Mary was not particularly enamoured of the proposal.
Later, yielding to her Aunt&rsquo;s earnest persuasion she agreed
to give it a reasonable trial. Very soon it was demonstrated that
the services she was able to render were highly appreciated by
those amongst whom she had come to live. From a broken finger to a
birth she came at everybody&rsquo;s call. As often as not she had
to advise that a Doctor be asked to see the patient before she
could undertake the case. But for all sorts of minor troubles she
was sufficiently skilled and efficient to act upon her own
initiative. So it was that she found herself filling a &ldquo;long
felt want;&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Nurse&rdquo; speedily became an
established part of the social system of Olinda and district.</p>

<p>As can be seen, to send for &ldquo;The Nurse&rdquo; in such a
case as Hewitt&rsquo;s was therefore just what the Roads men might
have been expected to do. That she would come at once neither of
them doubted. It never occurred to them&mdash;or, for that matter,
to anyone else&mdash;that she might have personal affairs of her
own to claim prior attention. As is so often found by those who
perform public services, she was regarded as an institution rather
than a human being, and not to have responded to a call for aid
would have astonished those who sought it, and left them inwardly
resentful. Some of this she understood; but so greatly did she love
her work&mdash;and such was her nature&mdash;that she simply
refused to assert her individuality, or to harbour ill-feeling
against those who treated her more or less as a machine.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>In person, there was nothing particularly striking about Mary
Morrison. She was neither tall nor short, and her figure, though
fairly proportioned, would not have secured her a position as an
artist&rsquo;s model. A ready smile&mdash; backed by a good set of
teeth&mdash;soft brown eyes, and a slight curl in her dark brown
hair were her chief attractions. Nevertheless, these were
sufficient to cause some of the local young men to think her
acquaintance desirable. It is certain, also, that more than one of
them would have married her if she had been willing; but all
advances which seemed to tend in that direction she playfully set
aside.</p>

<p>There was only one man for whom the others thought she showed a
preference. For him, even at her busiest, she would always spare a
few moments to indulge in a brief conversation. Why this should be
so was the theme of constant speculation, for the favoured one had
a hump on his back and earned a rather precarious living as a sort
of &ldquo;handy Andy.&rdquo; He was the odd jobs man &ldquo;for
everyone who lacked the right tools,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t see the way&rdquo; to do a certain piece of
work.</p>

<p>But there was nothing wrong with Jim Young&rsquo;s brain. It was
only in personal appearance that he differed from ordinary men. His
head was sunk between his shoulders. In consequence of this
deformity, his legs and arms were out of proportion to his height.
They seemed too long for his body. His face was drawn and thin; but
he had a well-shaped nose, and his eyes were noticeably clear and
blue. No wonder, then, that those who were hale and straight and
strong were puzzled to know why &ldquo;The Nurse&rdquo; should pay
so much more attention to him than to those of more presentable
mould. Eventually, however, it came to be generally understood that
sympathy for him was the only cause of her preferment.</p>

<p>However, Mary Morrison knew something that Jim Young did not
seem to know. Years before, though she did not tell him so, they
had both lived at East Brunswick. As children they had often played
together. One day&mdash;she being somewhat boyish then&mdash;they
were having a game of marbles on a piece of ground close to the
edge of what had once been a blue-stone quarry. It was at that time
partly filled with factory refuse, brick-bats and other kinds of
dry rubbish; but careful parents still regarded it as dangerous,
and warned the children not to go near the edge.</p>

<p>Whilst in the midst of their play another boy appeared upon the
scene. He was slightly known to both of them, but, as neither liked
him, he was left to look on without so much as a greeting. Sensing
their aversion, or perhaps out of a sheer desire to annoy them, he
pounced upon some of the marbles; held them in his open palm for
both to see; and, with a taunting laugh, called out:
&ldquo;Findings keepings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re mine!&rdquo; said Mary, sharply.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to pick them up like that! Give them
back!&rdquo; And she tried to snatch them from him. But he was too
quick, and swiftly lifting and closing his hand he gave her a push
and a kick that sent her sprawling. Her head was hurt, and for a
minute or two she was too dazed even to rise.</p>

<p>The boy with whom she had been playing was witness to what took
place. He immediately closed with the bigger, heavier one, and
sought to wrest the marbles from his grasp. It became a fight! The
marbles were dropped, and, weeping, Mary picked them up, but was
far too interested to run away. She watched the struggle intently,
and would like to have helped in the unequal contest, but could see
no opening. The stronger boy was steadily driving the other before
him. They approached the edge of the danger zone, and fearing what
might occur, Mary loudly called upon them to &ldquo;stop
fighting!&rdquo; If they heard they paid no heed, and presently the
weightier boy gave the smaller such a punch that he fell backwards
into the quarry hole.</p>

<p>As he struck the broken bricks and stones at the bottom he
screamed and then lay still. Mary scrambled down and tried to get
him on his feet. She found that she could not move him; he was too
heavy and too inert. But during her efforts he regained his senses,
and, with a hurried word about getting help, back she climbed to
the top of the hole and raced into the street looking for
assistance. A stone carter was coming up with his horse and dray.
Swiftly she ran towards him, shouting: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a boy
hurt down there, come and get him out! Oh! do come and get him
out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the time the stone carter and the girl reached the boy he was
unconscious again. Between them they somehow managed to get him out
of the quarry-hole and on to the footpath. Meantime his assailant
had disappeared, and Mary and the man were left to summon such aid
as could be found in a nearby cottage. Eventually&mdash;with the
assistance of the woman living in the cottage, they succeeded in
getting him home.</p>

<p>What happened after that Mary only knew by hearsay. Listening
carefully to the gossip of the neighbours it appeared that, on the
advice of the Doctor, the boy was sent to a hospital for treatment.
It was a long time before he appeared at school again. Even then he
was very weak, and, as everyone could see, Jim Young had a hump on
his back.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>But to return to Jack Hewitt. Mary Morrison&mdash;&rdquo;The
Nurse&rdquo;&mdash;paid no attention to the remarks he made to his
mates. She regarded his petulant observations as quite natural, for
she had heard much worse language from shell-torn men at the War.
One quick glance at his injuries and she set about her work.</p>

<p>In a moment, it seemed, she had coaxed the smouldering fire into
a blaze, and warm water was available. Very gently, she cut away
the ragged remnant of Hewitt&rsquo;s trouser leg, and gave first
aid attention to the wound in his thigh. It was a bad one; but
previous experience had taught her what to do, and she did it. Next
she bandaged his eyes, telling him that they had better be kept
from the light until the Doctor had examined them. That done, she
washed and dressed the cuts and scratches on his back. Finally, in
the skilled and modest way that Nurses have, she got him undressed
and into his pyjamas. He was then made comparatively comfortable in
his camp bed.</p>

<p>When the Doctor arrived, one quick glance at what &ldquo;The
Nurse&rdquo; had done was sufficient to evoke his praise. Getting
her to take off the bandages she had used, he carefully examined
the patient&rsquo;s wounds, and then said that, in his opinion, it
would be undesirable to move him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; he said to Hewitt, &ldquo;you have any female
relative, or know of any other woman who can come and attend to
your wants, that would be ideal. The Nurse will see that your
dressings are renewed, and will do such other things for you as
come within her province. I shall come again in a couple of days
just to see how you are getting along. Do what the Nurse tells you
to do and you&rsquo;ll be all right. Now what about a woman to help
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In answer, Hewitt said that his Mother was alive and well, and
would come if asked. He gave her address, and, in response to an
urgent telegram, she arrived the next day. It was also arranged
that the Nurse should stay with him until late that night, and
thereafter pay such regular visits and give such attention, as
might be required until the Doctor otherwise ordered.</p>

<p>Being a perfectly healthy man, Hewitt&rsquo;s minor wounds soon
healed. But it was quite a while before he recovered the full use
of his eyes, and still longer before his leg was fit for
service.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when he was well on the way to recovery, and
whilst Mary was attending to his leg, he remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somehow, I seem to know you! Feel as if I&rsquo;ve met
you before somewhere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Many people say that sort of thing!&rdquo; she
replied. &ldquo;I think they get used to seeing me about, and then
get the fancy that they have seen me somewhere else!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; said Hewitt
doubtfully. &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t get it out of my mind that I
have seen you, years ago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to forget it!&rdquo; he retorted,
and smiled.</p>

<p>A few days later, his mother having gone to the store to get
supplies, he caught the Nurse by the hands, pulled her to him, and
gave her a kiss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that again!&rdquo; said Mary sharply.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do!&rdquo; he answered with a laugh.
&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he added more seriously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
I spoke the way I did when you first came to nurse me! You&rsquo;ve
behaved like an angel, and I love you! Will you marry
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This sudden and unexpected proposal completely shattered
Mary&rsquo;s professional composure. Temporarily, those feelings
she had hitherto been able to control came to boiling point, and
she could not restrain her speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marry you?&rdquo; she questioned indignantly. &ldquo;Not
if you were as rich as Rockefeller, or the last man in the world!
I&rsquo;ve attended to you because it was my duty, and not for gain
or because I like you. No! No! I know you too well! I&rsquo;ve
known you longer than you think! It was you who took my marbles
from me and kicked me and pushed me as well. It was you who knocked
the boy, who tried to help me, into the quarry hole. It was Jim
Young you treated like that, and he&rsquo;s been deformed ever
since. Marry you? Never! Never! Never!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And being ready to leave she ran out of the shack.</p>

<p>The display of Mary&rsquo;s feelings, no less than her
passionate rejection of his offer, gave rise to a riot of anger in
Hewitt&rsquo;s breast. He burst into a fury, and cursed and swore
in the most outrageous fashion. Passion and jealousy and rage were
all aroused. &ldquo;So!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It is that damned
hunch-back who is my rival! Pity he wasn&rsquo;t killed in the
quarry hole! I remember it all now. Damn him! Well! Maybe I can
teach them both another lesson. Let them wait. I&rsquo;ll fix them
as sure as hell!&rdquo; And he turned his thoughts in the direction
of his desire to injure them.</p>

<p>Almost continuously Hewitt brooded over the matter. And all the
time he watched for an opportunity to do either Mary Morrison or
Jim Young bodily harm. There was no clear project in his mind; only
a savage desire to hurt and maim those against whom his hate was
directed. But nothing took place to give him a lead. He grew
taciturn and sour with everybody. In the language of those who knew
him best, &ldquo;there was no living with the fellow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eventually, however, something occurred which seemed to favour
his purpose. Two months or a little more after Mary had so
emphatically and dramatically refused his offer of marriage, she
was attending a motor accident case. On her way to and from the
sufferer&rsquo;s home she had to pass Hewitt&rsquo;s shack. Like
many others, he knew her movements, and, as the days were drawing
in and the dusk fell early, he saw the chance for which he had been
looking, and made his plans accordingly.</p>

<p>His first move was so simple as to be unobserved. As Mary came
pedalling home on her bicycle he pulled a string that he had tied
to a small bush a little up the bank on the opposite side of the
road to his own. Though it broke as it was touched by the bicycle
it nevertheless had the intended effect. Mary lost control of her
machine, and only just managed to avoid a fall. Before she could
recover her poise and go on again, Hewitt&mdash;who had been hiding
behind a tree&mdash;ran out, caught her in his arms, and made as
fast as he could for the shack. Mary screamed and fought but was
unable to break free. Within a few seconds he had her
inside&mdash;thrown her on his bed, and, leaping back, had bolted
the door.</p>

<p>The trick was well played; but, as sometimes happens, Providence
seemed to take a hand. That same afternoon&mdash; unknown to
Hewitt&mdash;Jim Young was working in a paddock on the other side
of the road, putting an extra strand of wire into a fence. When
&ldquo;the accident&rdquo; occurred he had finished his job; his
tools were back in his carpenter&rsquo;s basket and, though hidden
by the trees, he was within a few feet of the roadside when he saw
what took place!</p>

<p>In less time than it takes to tell of his feat he was at
Hewitt&rsquo;s door. To his dismay he found it securely
fastened.</p>

<p>There was only one thing to do; he must break it down. But how?
He tried a hammer; but it was too light, and made little or no
impression. Then his Mother-wit aided him. Out of his kit of tools
he picked an auger, and in feverish haste, used it to bore holes
over and below the line of the door-bolt! And all the
time&mdash;above the noise of the scuffling inside&mdash;he kept on
shouting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fight on! Nurse! I&rsquo;ll be with you in a minute!
Fight on! I shan&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so it proved, for the wood of the door was not thick. Very
soon therefore, Young thought that a sufficient number of holes had
been bored, and this time a hammer blow did its work; the bolt fell
to the ground and the door swung open.</p>

<p>But Hewitt was too quick for Young. He saw the door open, and,
in a flash, had flung himself upon the hunchback. They crashed to
the earth, and Young would very soon have been a dead man had not
Mary rushed to his rescue. Seizing an axe handle that stood beside
the chimney she ran out and struck Hewitt over the head with it.
The blow gave him such a shock that he lost his hold of Young and
the two of them sprang to their feet at the same time.</p>

<p>No doubt, thinking to disarm her, Hewitt faced Mary first. It
was an error in tactics that gave Young a lightning chance to
secure a weapon. It was the auger that he had dropped after boring
the holes in the door. And so it was that, even as Hewitt tries to
disposses Mary of the axe handle, a painful prod in the back caused
him to desist! He quickly turned about, and then jumped aside for
fear of a double attack.</p>

<p>As all three realised, the struggle was now ended. Hewitt was
almost beside himself in his fury. For a full minute he stood
glaring at Mary and Jim in impotent rage:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Clear out, or
I&rsquo;ll get my gun and do for the pair of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Mary knew this to be an empty threat. He hadn&rsquo;t got a
gun, and she moved aside as he strode towards the shack. Therein he
disappeared, and there, apparently, he stayed; for there was no
sign of him as Jim and Mary turned the corner on their way
home.</p>

<p>Later on&mdash;that evening&mdash;four resolute men called to
tell him that he must leave Olinda at once or they would take
measures to see that their orders were obeyed!</p>

<p>He had already departed!</p>

<p align="center">* * * * *</p>

<p>An appeal was being made to raise funds for the relief of
distressed sailors and soldiers. To assist in the sale of buttons
for this purpose, Mary Morrison had gone to the city. And very nice
she looked in her nurse&rsquo;s uniform; the red cape being
particularly suitable to her complexion. As a consequence the eyes
of many a mere male gave her more than a passing glance. Possibly
she was aware of the attention she evoked; but, quite regardless of
whom she addressed, her constant cry was: &ldquo;Buy a button! Buy
a button to assist disabled soldiers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was in response to this invitation that, just about mid-day,
some one fiercely said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buy a button you bitch? Not on your life. I&rsquo;ll see
you in hell first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary swiftly raised her eyes to see the scowling face of Jack
Hewitt. His eyes were glazing with malignant anger. As he took a
step back, and clenched his fist, Mary feared a blow. But before
she had time to speak or move a tall policeman looking on, promptly
intervened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop that language!&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;And move
on at once or I&rsquo;ll arrest you for offensive behaviour! Get on
now! Get out of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; said Mary, with a charming smile. And
then she added&mdash;although she could not afterwards think why
she did it&mdash;&rdquo;I&rsquo;m glad you were there! He hates me
because I refused to marry him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The policeman was interested and attracted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Looking at his face I
don&rsquo;t wonder you turned him down. Seems a bad lot. Got a
devil of a temper I should think. But tell me, how are you getting
along? Doing well with the buttons?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Not too well!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;The money
box is not very heavy yet!&rdquo; And she gave him a look which
seemed to say: &ldquo;How about you giving me a helping
hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He understood, and in her own vein said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! I&rsquo;ll make it heavier by a shilling if
you&rsquo;ll pin the button on my tunic!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will with pleasure!&rdquo; Mary answered. And as
she was fastening it below his soldier&rsquo;s ribbon, he
asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you at the War?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Villers-Brettoneux!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So was I,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Got wounded there; but
am alright now. Where do you live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Olinda!&rdquo; Up in the Dandenong Hills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Why, I was born there!&rdquo; he exclaimed in
surprise. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, and where can I find
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be up to see you on Sunday!&rdquo; he remarked as he
moved away.</p>

<p>To Mary&rsquo;s astonishment&mdash;for she was used to hearing
such assertions&mdash;he kept his word. Moreover, he came again and
again, and showed no sign of abandoning the practice! Soon she
began to look forward to his visits, and was disappointed when
anything occurred to prevent his promised coming. Before long, both
knew that their greatest joy was in each other. Their engagement
quickly followed, and, three months later they were quietly
married.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>

<p>After Mary Morrison had become Mrs. John Alderton, she went to
live at Carlton. About three months after settling there she
received a disturbing letter from her Aunt at Olinda. That kindly
woman had written&mdash;so she stated&mdash;at the very earnest
request of Jim Young who was &ldquo;very, very ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wanted to see Mary, he said, in order that he might tell her
something before he died.</p>

<p>Mary left at once; only taking time to write a brief note to her
husband to say where she had gone; and not to expect her back
before the following day. Her haste was prompted by a knowledge of
certain things concerning Jim that she had thought it wise not to
communicate to any one else. That he loved her she knew without
being told. She had known it for a long time, and &mdash; although
she did not love him in return, her womanly pity had been stirred
by the helplessness of his case, and she had shown him as much
kindness as she dared.</p>

<p>But after he had rescued her from Hewitt in the encounter at the
shack, the situation changed. She knew that he was filled with an
expectation of something more than a benevolent interest in his
affairs. This made her wary. Not for anything would she hurt his
feelings, and, in a well-intended effort to make his hopes subside,
she refrained from seeing him as often as had been her previous
habit. But this only led to his seeking her out, and she was not
altogether successful in keeping their relations at the old
standard.</p>

<p>When Alderton appeared upon the scene&mdash;not long after the
Hewitt affair&mdash;Jim saw at once that such a man was bound to
find favour in Mary&rsquo;s eyes. As the weeks passed &mdash;and he
learned of the steady way in which she was being wooed&mdash;he
became thoroughly despondent. After her marriage a kind of
lassitude descended upon him. He seemed to sink into himself, and
for long spaces would sit uncannily silent and still. Nothing
interested him. Slowly but certainly he fell into a decline. Quite
often he was unwell, and now and again had to take to his bed. All
these things Mary knew&mdash;and she had secretly mourned over his
condition. So it was that, when the summons came, she went to him
without the least delay.</p>

<p>It needed only a glance to tell her that he was nearing the end.
Nevertheless, she chose to speak to him in as cheery a manner as
she could command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! What&rsquo;s the matter, Jim? You&rsquo;re not
giving up are you? Pull yourself together, and make a bid to get
well again. We all want you to live you know! Do try!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she smoothed his brow with her cool soft hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying, and I know it!&rdquo; he weakly
responded. &ldquo;But&mdash;before I
go&mdash;I-wanted-to-ask-you-something.
What-made-you-fancy-the-policeman, Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled upon him as she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it must have been the uniform, Jim! They say no
woman can resist a uniform!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! It wasn&rsquo;t that!&rdquo; he wanly retorted.
&ldquo;Once&mdash; I&mdash; thought&mdash; you&mdash; loved&mdash;
me! But, when&mdash; I&mdash; saw&mdash; the&mdash; way&mdash;
you&mdash; looked&mdash; at&mdash; him&mdash;, I&mdash; knew&mdash;
better. I&mdash; think&mdash; I&rsquo;ve&mdash; always&mdash;
been&mdash; in&mdash; love&mdash; with&mdash; you, Mary! &mdash;
After&mdash; the&mdash; fight&mdash; with&mdash; Hewitt&mdash;
I&mdash; was&mdash; certain&mdash; of&mdash; it! As&mdash;
you&mdash; can&mdash; see, I&mdash; hung&mdash; the&mdash;
auger&mdash; on the wall. The&mdash; brown&mdash; bow&mdash;
you&mdash; see&mdash; tied&mdash; to&mdash; it&mdash; is&mdash;
the&mdash; one&mdash; that&mdash; fell&mdash; from&mdash;
your&mdash; dress,&mdash; that&mdash; day! I&rsquo;ve&mdash;
never&mdash; used&mdash; the&mdash; auger&mdash; since.
It&rsquo;s&mdash; a&mdash; it&rsquo;s&mdash; a&mdash; sort
of&mdash; idol! I&rsquo;ve prayed&mdash; for you&mdash; before
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash; don&rsquo;t&mdash; know&mdash; it,&mdash;
Mary! but&mdash; I&mdash; fought&mdash; for you&mdash; twice.
I&mdash; fought&mdash; the boy&mdash; who&mdash; tried&mdash;
to&mdash; steal&mdash; your marbles when&mdash; you&mdash;
were&mdash; a girl! &mdash;He&mdash; knocked me, into&mdash;
the&mdash; quarry&mdash; hole, and&mdash; broke&mdash; my&mdash;
back! Now, my heart&rsquo;s&mdash; broken, and&mdash; I&rsquo;m
going. Will&mdash; you&mdash; kiss&mdash; me&mdash; once,
just&mdash; once,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&mdash; let&mdash; me&mdash;
go&mdash; in peace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary stooped and kissed him on the lips.</p>

<p>As she rose&mdash;a smile&mdash;an ineffable smile&mdash;lighted
up his face; and then&mdash;as he took her hand in his&mdash;a calm
content slowly took its place. He sighed&mdash;happily&mdash;as her
fingers pressed upon his own. His eyes closed. The furrows on his
brow smoothed out. Upon his cheeks an almost imperceptible touch of
pink appeared. His breathing eased and softened. A moment later he
was dead.</p>
