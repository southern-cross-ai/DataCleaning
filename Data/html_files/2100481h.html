  <p>The following Tales like the first and second  series, issued in 1935, and 1938 respectively have their settings in the  Dandenong Hills. The reasons, as set forth in the first story &ldquo;Nellie Moir&rdquo; may  be here re-stated:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is always something doing in the Hills.  Amid the Hills the human heart beats stronger and the mind is more alert.  Though they seem to brood, to doze, they are none the less awake to all that  matters. From every peak and shoulder there is to be seen another view, and, to  those who have eyes to see and ears to hear, there is much more to be noted  than can be imagined. Their variety is measureless. Within their depths and on  their heights it is the unexpected that always happens. Surprise lurks  everywhere, and there is no manner of man that cannot be taken unawares.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No copies of this booklet will be offered for  sale, the whole edition having been reserved for distribution amongst friends.</p>
  <p>If any reader cares to express an opinion, it  would be esteemed a favour to receive a letter saying which Tale was liked the  best.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSinger"></a>&ldquo;The Singer&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>WHEN Christina Crossley married John Cross she  made a mistake. In her case the truth of the old saw&mdash;about changing the name  and not the letter being &ldquo;married for worse and not for better,&rdquo; &mdash; was bitterly  exemplified. Yet, at the time, there appeared to be every reason to believe  that the union would be a complete success. As one motherly old lady remarked  to another: &ldquo;In any case&mdash;if they quarrel&mdash;they can do what thousands of others  have done before; they can kiss and make it up again! That&rsquo;s life, my dear! And  as far as I can see there is no reason on earth why they shouldn&rsquo;t be happy!  They are both of an age to know their own minds!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And so it seemed. He was twenty six and she was  twenty four. Both had certain interests in common, and, in the matter of good  looks each was well endowed. She was fair-haired, blue eyed and graceful in  type, but, nevertheless, much stronger physically, and much more resolute mentally  than her appearance suggested. He was strikingly handsome. In addition to being  tall and splendidly proportioned, his wavy auburn hair, red-brown eyes, and  open countenance singled him out wherever he happened to be.</p>
  <p>In other ways, also, the marriage, seemed to be  an auspicious one, As the owner of a small business, in a rising suburb, the  future prospects for John Cross were deemed to be particularly bright. His free  and easy style made him a general favourite. Moreover, at local entertainments he  was a star performer and always in demand. This was due to the fact that he was  a first class Elocutionist who could recite a dramatic piece with force and  power, or, if it seemed more fitting, tell an amusing story inimitably. In  addition he was a passable singer; so that,&mdash;with his good looks, his geniality  and his talents&mdash;the number of customers attracted to his shop the purchasing of  their requirements was steadily increasing.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Christina Crossley  contributed her full share to the marriage partnership. Her pretty face and  fine figure were supplemented by nice manners and a truly sweet disposition.  She was well trained in domestic affairs; had a good knowledge of music, and  played the piano extremely well. As an accompanist, her ability to get into  sympathetic accord with the singer was extraordinary.</p>
  <p>It was this particular accomplishment which  originally drew her and John Cross into association. When she played for him,  his singing&mdash;which was not much above the average male standard&mdash;improved in  quality, and his audiences appreciated it the more. Thus it was that&mdash;in the  words of the clergyman who proposed the toast of the bride and the bridegroom  at the wedding breakfast&mdash;&ldquo;they seemed to be eminently suited to each other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But neither his good looks nor his talents,&mdash;not  even their common love of music&mdash;could stand the strain of continued neglect.  The callous indifference which John Cross eventually exhibited towards his wife  really originated in his popularity. It was not due&mdash;as some folks wrongly  alleged&mdash;to an aversion arising out of disappointed expectations. As a helpmeet  Christina was all that she ought to be, and in the performance of her household  duties might have served as a pattern to others.</p>
  <p>The truth is that John Cross was too popular,  and the feting and the flattery he received from outside ruinously enlarged his  self esteem. Moreover, the hospitality so frequently showered upon him was not  conducive to sobriety. From the taking of liquor in a social way he developed a  craving for it. The habit grew from bad to worse, and, ashamed of his vice, he  sought to conceal it by drinking in secret. Thus, self love and love of liquor  undermined his sense of duty, and both his wife and his business came to be  shamefully neglected.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Unrecognised by either of them, the trouble  began as soon as the honeymoon was over. Because of his abilities as an  entertainer, invitations to social gatherings poured upon them. This  manifestation of friendliness and goodwill so filled them with delight that, in  sheer happiness of spirits, they readily accepted much of the proffered  hospitality. As a matter of fact Christina enjoyed the outings&mdash;and her husband&rsquo;s  little triumphs&mdash;just as much as he did, and, with her piano playing, helped him  to his successes. And for rather more than a year they were very happy indeed.</p>
  <p>But, after their baby was born, she was not so  free to take her part at social gatherings as before that event. The child,  too, was somewhat sickly, and required so much attention that, except upon  those rare occasions when she ventured to take the baby with her, she politely  expressed her regret at being unable to attend. As a natural result it was not  long before she was left out altogether. Even after little Jean died, and she  was again in a position to accompany her husband, she was not asked; or, if she  were&mdash;as she sometimes suspected&mdash;her husband did not say so; selfishly  preferring to take his pleasure alone.</p>
  <p>As was to be expected, the time came when his  acquired habits brought him up with a round turn. For some time prior, neglect  and inattention began to affect his business. Occasionally he would go out and  not return until after closing time at night. Now and then&mdash;for days together&mdash;he  would give it only perfunctory service, and the suave and urbane manner by  which he had once captured customers was often superseded by irritability or  gloomy silence. It was not long, therefore, before John Cross was practically  insolvent; and also&mdash;by reason of his treatment of her&mdash;almost bankrupt in his  wife&rsquo;s affections. But, in his hour of need, love and loyalty triumphed over  resentment, and she right royally came to his assistance.</p>
  <p>With rare courage, she waited upon the head of  the Firm which was his largest creditor and pleaded, as only a wife can&mdash;for  another chance for her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; she argued, &ldquo;he could only be placed in  some part of a country district where the opportunities to obtain drink would  be absent, and social intercourse almost impossible, he would surely become his  old self again and we would succeed. If you will not help us I do not know what  we shall do. We have now neither money nor friends. The position, for me, is  terrible to contemplate. I am broken hearted and in despair. Please, oh please  do give him another chance!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The &ldquo;Head of the Firm&rdquo; pursed his lips and  wrinkled his brow. Such men do when they are thinking. This one also beat with  his pen upon the blotting pad. After a minute or two he said something about &ldquo;the  curse of drink&rdquo;! He went on to express some doubts about the possibility of her  husband&rsquo;s &ldquo;reformation&rdquo;; but concluded by saying that for her sake he would  look into the matter and advise her as soon as possible.</p>
  <p>Three days later, in response to a letter asking  her to call, she saw him again. In a few words he told her that, if she cared  to have it, a store was available &ldquo;in the hills.&rdquo; Her husband would do the  work, of course, but she must be responsible for the general conduct of the  business. Only on that condition &ldquo;would the Firm be prepared to finance the  business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With tears of gratitude in her eyes Christina  Cross accepted the offer! There was no time to consult her husband about it,  and even if there were, the responsibility was thrust upon her and she bravely  took it! In any case, it was a similar sort of business to the one with which  he had been associated, and consequently called for no fresh knowledge as to  its running. So it was that, in due course, John Cross and his wife found  themselves installed in a way-side store at Olinda, in the Dandenongs.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>For a time the bitter lesson taught by his  previous failure had a salutary effect upon&nbsp;  John Cross. The new surroundings were also helpful in that they were  healthful and invigorating. He enjoyed them. Above all, he sincerely felt that  he owed a duty to his wife for the way she had assisted him, and he was  grateful and happy in the renewal of her affectionate regard.</p>
  <p>These changes were noted by his wife with silent  delight. She became a new woman. Her personal appearance improved&mdash;for she too  was happy, and looked into the future with the highest hopes. But her dreams  did not come true. John Cross grew weary of his more or less humdrum life. He  longed for the old excitements. In particular&mdash;though he fought it down for a  while&mdash;he again developed a feverish desire for liquor. Very soon he found a way  to get it, and, over-night it seemed, he was once again the irresponsible and  neglectful husband of the recent past!</p>
  <p>Then it was that Christina Cross took up her  cross in resolute earnest. With might and main she strove to hold her home and  business together. The struggle grew more desperate as it proceeded. John soon  got to the stage when the help he gave was negligible. He became a perpetual  source of irritation and alarm to her, and she was never free from anxiety as  to what he would do next. He stole her money to obtain drink; and she was  eventually obliged to make him allowances in return for some pretended  services. Worse still, he occasionally threatened her with physical violence.  Life was a misery!</p>
  <p>In the midst of these troubles she gave birth to  a son. Such an event is always something of a burden to the Mother, but, in  this case, it could almost be described as the rueful crowning of her worries,  instead of the joy it should have been. To make matters worse she was quick to  perceive that, though the baby&rsquo;s little body was perfect, there was a decided  weakness in his legs. Becoming more and more alarmed at their failure to grow  proportionately to his arms she took him to a City Specialist for examination.  But there was only cold comfort in his advice, for, after giving the weakness  an unpronounceable name, he ordered regular daily massage.</p>
  <p>The blow was a bad one, for, of course,  Christina could neither afford the time nor the money for treatment in the  city. It followed that she herself had to do the best she could. Despite her  most assiduous efforts, however, the improvement was only slight. At three  years of age. Christopher, as he was named, was almost helpless. Ile could not  even crawl, and his only method of movement was by placing his hands upon the  floor behind his back and pushing himself along. So propelled he could slide  from place to place within the house, but, outside, wherever he went he was  carried.</p>
  <p>Christopher&rsquo;s hapless condition was enough to  have drawn pity and compassion from a stone; yet, for some inscrutable reason,  his father hated him. As a consequence Christina kept him out of sight as much  as possible. This was also a precautionary measure, for, when in drink, her  husband blamed her for the child&rsquo;s deformity, and, in the vilest language, was  given to uttering veiled threats against both of them. How she put up with it  all passes comprehension. Her patience must have been almost superhuman. But,  in spite of her forbearance, an end had to come to such misery of body and soul  as she endured. It came&mdash;as all such happenings do&mdash;with dramatic suddenness.</p>
  <p>One hot February afternoon John Cross returned  from the City inflamed with liquor&mdash;his clothes disordered and his whole  appearance degraded and bestial. He was a terrifying sight, and in the worst of  humours. Nothing satisfied him. He was perversity personified and could not be  appeased. He would do nothing and accept no suggestions. On other occasions he  had been subtly persuaded to &ldquo;take a rest until he felt better,&rdquo; but on this he  would have none of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! I don&rsquo;t want a cup of tea! And I don&rsquo;t want  to sleep. And I&rsquo;m not going to be stopped from speaking my mind. I know what  you&rsquo;re trying to do; damn you! And what&rsquo;s more, if you think I&rsquo;m tired you&rsquo;re  making a damned big mistake, I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And so, for rather more than three mortal hours,  he muttered and cursed and swore.... &ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s a damned disgrace! An object! And  its all Christina&rsquo;s fault! She bore him. She bore him&mdash;blast her! Pity she ever  did! Pity they&rsquo;re not both dead! A good thing for everybody if they were! A  hell of a good thing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And much more to the same effect in coarser  kind.</p>
  <p>Night drew on apace. In the semi-darkness John  Cross seemed more like an animal than a man. With his head sunk between his  shoulders, his arms swinging loosely as his body swayed drunkenly about&mdash;even as  he sat&mdash;he looked like an ape. His face, too, took on a more ferocious look the  more he raved. Christina watched his every movement in nervous dread. When,  staggering, he made his way towards the woodshed at the rear of the house  something prompted her to take Christopher in her arms and follow after, to see  what he would do. The next moment he was rushing at her, axe in hand, wildly  shouting that he would kill the pair of them &ldquo;and have done with the whole  blasted business for good!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Into the darkness of the bush she ran, the  madman lumbering in pursuit. Fortunately he tripped and fell, or, laden as she  was with the heavy boy, she must have been overtaken. As it was, fear lent her  strength until she was completely out of sight.</p>
  <p>No one saw John Cross rise. He was never seen  again. It may be that&mdash;after he recovered himself&mdash;he wandered into the denser  bush and so perished. But, whatever happened, his disappearance was complete.  Where Christina and the child took refuge was not discovered. So far as the  neighbors were concerned, Mother and Son had disappeared as completely as if  they had fallen into a mine. Police enquiries and all other attempts to solve  the mystery were futile. &ldquo;The Firm,&rdquo; being unable to trace either Mr. or Mrs.  Cross, took possession of the store. Later, it passed into the hands of a young  Scotchman and his wife. They, it was said, made the competency which might have  been secured by Christina Cross had the Fates so willed!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Singer! The Singer!! The Singer!!!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These words, in tones that varied from a whisper  to a muffled call, were being uttered by a goodly number of people over a wide  neighborhood in the hills about and beyond Sassafras. As used, they were meant  to announce that he who was known as &ldquo;The Singer&rdquo; was singing a song. They also  served as an invitation to those who might be inside their dwellings&mdash;or too far  away to be within range of his voice&mdash;to come out, or take up a position where  they could surely hear him. This was a courtesy that everyone paid to his  neighbor on such occasions.</p>
  <p>The singing always took place at night. This  time it was a calm still star-lit night in March. The air was softly cool after  the heat of the day, and&mdash;as it chanced&mdash;almost everybody was out of doors  enjoying it. To add to this pleasure&mdash;from somewhere down in the deep valley on  the way towards Olinda  a song came welling up to the eager listeners thinly scattered over the adjoining  heights. He who sang was as mysterious as his voice was glorious. No one had  ever seen him; and where and how he lived&mdash;if he lived at all&mdash;nobody knew. All  they could tell of him was that, for years past, at somewhat infrequent  intervals, his delightful voice had been heard in song. Sometimes it was so  soft and sweet and far away that it seemed to come from down beneath &ldquo;The  Mystic Lake&rdquo;&mdash;when the moonlight caused that mirage to be seen. At other times&mdash;from  some undiscoverable spot&mdash;it floated high and far and wide until the whole world&mdash;his  hearers felt&mdash;was pervaded by its power and beauty.</p>
  <p>On this particular evening he was singing a song  entitled: &ldquo;I dreamt my little boy of thee.&rdquo; It is a very old song, and its  sentiment is now perhaps, out of date. But the people of the hills in those far  away days loved every line of it. Some of the women folk&mdash;Mothers particularly&mdash;were  even known to have wept at its conclusion. This was no doubt due to the  remarkably sympathetic way in which the last verse was always rendered&mdash;not to  speak of the irresistible appeal which the sentimental words themselves made to  those whose emotions are easily stirred. As sung by him this is how they ran:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I dreamt my little boy of thee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw thee in thy manhood&rsquo;s days,<br>
    And knew that He who rules all hearts<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had kept thy soul in righteous ways!<br>
    So may He guide thee to the end<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is what I pray on bended knee,<br>
    And may that happy dream come true<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dreamt my little boy of thee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a moment or two, as usual, there was  absolute silence at the conclusion of the song. No one spoke, and there was no  applause; yet, just as if it were in response to an encore he sang again. This  was his invariable custom; sometimes extended to three songs in all. He knew a  goodly number, and as his voice had a very fine range, he was able to sing such  different types as &ldquo;Take a pair of sparkling eyes,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The heart bowed down!&rdquo;  Other favourites, in which he excelled, were: &ldquo;Steal away to Jesus&rdquo; and &ldquo;The  Holy City.&rdquo; To describe the impression he made when singing the last named song  is impossible. Out in the open amid the quiet of the silent trees and the  glamorous beauty of the starry night, his hearers forgot who they were and  where they were. To them&mdash;as with an Angel&rsquo;s voice he sang&mdash;&ldquo;The gates of Heaven  were open wide!!&rdquo; They saw the Holy City: Paradise  itself; and the glory of the vision and the magic of the silvery voice held  them spell-bound in wonder and in awe!</p>
  <p>By way of addition to his songs&mdash;though they were  unaccompanied in the true sense of the term&mdash;he always played a little music.  The instrument he used was a Cello, and on this it was his custom to give a  kind of introduction to whatever song he was about to sing. More briefly, he  did the same thing at the beginning of each succeeding verse, and he always  ended by playing&mdash;very softly, as if it were an echo&mdash;the last two lines of his  song. On very rare occasions&mdash;and never except upon a very calm still night&mdash;he  would play a complete number upon his Cello in between one song and another.  And his remarkable command of the instrument&mdash;no less than the strangely elusive  and mysterious airs he chose to play, were almost equalled by his voice. Yet,  without exception, it was a song&mdash;followed by a repetition of the last two lines  upon the Cello&mdash;that ended every performance.</p>
  <p>There were those who said that these peculiar  habits&mdash;and more especially the muted playing of the final notes&mdash;were really  precautionary measures to prevent anyone approaching him unawares. He had never  let himself be seen. Whether playing or singing, he always kept one ear  attentive to other sounds. The fall of a footstep or the crackling of a twig  was sufficient to bring him to a dead stop. The cleverest and most astute  amongst those who had tried to come upon him by surprise had seen little more  than a head and shoulders which vanished in an instant! It was altogether  inexplicable!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>But at long last there was a sudden end to his  playing and singing; and he himself was tragically revealed to them.</p>
  <p>On another night such as the one previously  described the unexpected happened. He had just finished singing: &ldquo;Steal away to  Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;and was beginning to play the concluding lines upon his Cello&mdash;when there  was a sudden stoppage. A moment later the audience in the hills&mdash;still waiting  for the final bars&mdash;were astonished to hear him calling for help. In a panic  stricken voice he was shouting:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! People! Come quickly! Come quickly! Mother  is dying! Come and help her! I am helpless and alone. Come at once! Oh! do come  quickly!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was an instantaneous response. From all  directions men rushed towards the spot whence they thought the cry had come.  Women followed as fast as they could; all anxiety to be of assistance!</p>
  <p>But everybody was baffled! They could not find  him. Encouraging calls failed to elicit a response. Shouted requests for the  direction to follow were met with a profound and stony silence. Except for a  little noise of movement&mdash;which those who first started were certain they had  heard&mdash;not another sound greeted the ears of any of them. They began to wonder  whether they might not have been deceived.</p>
  <p>At a late hour the search was abandoned until  the next day, Sunday. Then&mdash;more out of curiosity than otherwise a fair number  resumed their combing of the area which had yielded such unsatisfactory results  the previous evening. But daylight made a difference, and, after about an hour&rsquo;s  work, two of them came across &ldquo;The Singer&rdquo; lying face downwards in the  undergrowth.</p>
  <p>He was strangely clothed. The upper part of his  body&mdash;which was magnificently proportioned&mdash;was clad in a knitted woollen garment  of the cardigan type. His legs and feet were encased in the same kind of  material; but they were so very shrunken and small as to be grotesque. Those  who found him were so astonished that, for a brief space, they stood inactive.  Then&mdash;as others came running up in response to their call&mdash;they quickly raised  and turned him over in the hope that he was alive!</p>
  <p>He was dead! But the extraordinary beauty of his  features held them strangely silent. In every detail of form and coloring he  resembled the conventional pictures of Christ. The men were so astounded that  they involuntarily removed their hats; whilst the women, in awed voices,  whispered: &ldquo;The Saviour!&rdquo; and the more emotional amongst them sobbed as Mary  Magdalene may have done when she discovered that Jesus had departed from the  Sepulchre in which He had been laid!</p>
  <p>Very reverently, several of the men lifted the  body and carried it to the house of one of the bearers. A search for the young  man&rsquo;s Mother was then begun, for&mdash;as everybody now realised&mdash;his call for help  the night before had been quite genuine. When they found her&mdash;a minute or so  later&mdash;she, too, was dead. On a little patch of grassy ground she lay, the  fingers of one hand grasping two strings of a Cello by her side. To the  searchers, what had probably taken place was thus revealed. Attacked by a  sudden illness, she had laid her hand upon the strings to attract her son&rsquo;s  attention. He&mdash;surprised at such an extraordinary happening&mdash;instantly ceased playing.  The next moment&mdash;thoroughly alarmed at her condition&mdash;he had shouted for aid, and  then&mdash;in a panic, had set &omicron;ff to find it. The track he left behind him as he  crawled and scrambled along was plainly discernible. To follow it was easy, and  at its beginning, as expected, the search ended, for there his mother was  found. Then&mdash;as with &ldquo;The Singer&rdquo;&mdash;willing hands raised and bore the dead woman  to the house where her son lay; and someone undertook to find and bring a  Doctor.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>At the Coroner&rsquo;s inquest the several parts of a  truly remarkable story were pieced into an intelligent whole. Stripped of  formal questions and answers, as well as other unnecessary particulars, it may  be thus briefly told.</p>
  <p>Amid all her misfortunes Christina Cross; had  retained the friendship of Mr. Russell George, the proprietor of a Knitting  Mill in the City. He first met her when&mdash;some years before her marriage&mdash;he had  awarded her first prize for knitted work in a competition connected with her  Church. After she became Mrs. Cross, and her troubles began to develop, she  occasionally sought his advice. In later times she gave him her complete  confidence, and the fact that there was someone in whom she could confide  seemed to make her worries easier to bear.</p>
  <p>He knew and told the Coroner all about the  failure of the first business; of the change to Olinda; and of the fears that began to harass  her when Cross again took to drink. He also told of the continual dread she had  of a murderous attack upon her crippled boy, and of the constant strain she was  under in guarding against such an eventuality. It was a nightmare sort of  existence that would have been unsupportable but for the love she had for her  son.</p>
  <p>On the night she had fled from Cross&mdash;her Boy in  her arms&mdash;they had taken refuge in a cave. This cave had been shown to her  months before by a boy named Henry Stone, who, in turn, owed its discovery to  his dog chasing after a rabbit. The cave, which was very hard to find, was  entered from the top, and its opening was easily disguised. In any case, she  only left or entered it when certain that there was no one about. This was all  the easier to manage because Stone,&mdash;who was remarkably loyal to Mrs. Cross&mdash;had  acted as her eyes and ears almost up to the day of her death.</p>
  <p>The lad, Henry Stone, had been befriended by  Mrs. Cross when he was in serious trouble over a theft he had not committed. He  was grateful for the way in which she had helped him out, and he had said that  if ever she wanted anything done he would do it! Accepting him at his word&mdash;and  enjoining the strictest secrecy&mdash;she told him that if ever he learned that she  had left John Cross he was to come to her at the cave without delay. It was  through him she got her first food supplies, and it was by his aid in other  directions that she carried on until the need was past.</p>
  <p>In preparation for a possible severance from her  husband Mrs. Cross had slowly and secretly furnished the cave with a number of  things to make it habitable. She had also arranged with him&mdash;Russell George&mdash;that,  if anything did happen, he would give her knitting work to do in order that she  might live. In a special degree she was more than ordinarily skilful and her  earnings had been good.</p>
  <p>As a consequence, neither she nor her son lacked  anything they required. And although she had originally not intended to remain  for any length of time in the cave, she hated the thought of exposing  Christopher&rsquo;s deformity to the world, and so stayed. Thus, together, perfectly  happy, she had taught him to sing; given him a Cello on which to play; and  lavished upon him all the care and attention which his helplessness seemed to  demand. For him she lived, and, as he grew more and more like Christ in  appearance, her brain softened a little, and her love turned to worship.</p>
  <p>These things he&mdash;Russell George&mdash;knew from fairly  frequent contact with Mrs. Cross in the way of business. Some months before,  fearing what might happen, he had looked out Henry Stone, now a grown youth&mdash;and  had requested that he be immediately informed of any unusual occurrence.  Through Stone, and from the newspapers, he had become aware of what had  transpired, and feeling it was his duty to attend the enquiry, he had come to  tell all he knew about the two people who had been found dead.</p>
  <p>Henry Stone&mdash;who had assisted the searchers to  look for Mrs. Cross, corroborated the statements as to the help he had given to  the deceased woman.</p>
  <p>The medical man appointed to examine the bodies  said that Mrs. Cross had undoubtedly succumbed to a paralytic stroke, whilst  the young man, in his terrified excitement, and in his strenuous efforts to  secure help, had overstrained a weak heart.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>In death, as in life, mother and son were not  separated; for they both rest in the same grave. But, on the spot where  Christopher Cross was found, the people who had loved his singing built a  little cairn surmounted by a rough hewn wooden cross, to which was attached an  inscribed metal plate.</p>
  <p>That was many years ago, and the story of &ldquo;The  Singer&rdquo; is now nothing but a fast dying tradition. Since then, also, the  popularity of the Hills has greatly increased; but, unfortunately, that  popularity had tended to wreck rather than preserve their matchless natural  beauty. Far too much of it has been destroyed to make way for holiday  residences, most of them quite out of keeping with their forest surroundings,  and some of them unspeakably ugly. Week-enders, too, have thoughtlessly added  to the general desecration. So much so that the Cairn has long since been  reduced to scattered stones; whilst the cross and its metal plate have  completely disappeared. But&mdash;in the days when they were still intact&mdash;the curious  passer-by might have read this simple tribute:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there no letter for me, Postman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Mrs Treverton. Not this morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Well! Perhaps it may come to-morrow. It&rsquo;s  sure to come some day, Postman! I know it will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; the Postman  sympathetically observed, as he touched his cap and moved away.</p>
<p>These remarks&mdash;in practically the same order&mdash;had  passed, almost daily, between Mrs. Treverton and a succession of Postmen for  more than twenty years. In themselves, they were commonplace, but, for the lady&mdash;though  still instinct with tragedy&mdash;they were nevertheless the expression of an  unconquerable hope.</p>
<p>Twenty-four years earlier Mrs. Treverton must  have been a lovely woman. Although she was now nearing fifty, she still held  much of the charm that was assuredly hers in her younger days. All her  attributes were truly feminine; a soft and pleasing voice; gentle manners; a  pleasant smile. Her hair, turning silver, was plentiful and ever so slightly  curled. On her smooth soft cheeks there yet remained a faint pink flush of a  kind that stays to the end. In short, there was about her all the signs which  caused her to be spoken of as &ldquo;a dear old lady!&rdquo; Only in her eyes was there any  hint of suffering or sorrow, and that quickly disappeared whenever she was  addressed.</p>
<p>To the older residents of Sherbrooke her tragic story was well known.  This, in part, may have accounted for the kindly regard in which she was held  by them all. Amongst the younger generation, however, but few were aware of the  full facts, and it was her kindly disposition that brought her their esteem.  Amongst those who were spoken of as &ldquo;the new comers&rdquo; all they knew was that,  sometime and somewhere in the remote past, she had been the victim of an  undefined but terrible misfortune. Enquiries as to the details failed to elicit  a coherent story. Some were led to believe that her husband had treated her &ldquo;abominably&rdquo;;  but what had become of him no one was able to tell, Others understood that her  only child had mysteriously disappeared whilst very young; but again no one  seemed to know the facts. It is well, therefore, that they should now be set  forth in black and white.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Lena Longmore was most prepossessing, Wherever  she went her vivacity and good looks attracted attention; even amongst her own  sex. With the young men of her set she was very popular indeed; and it was  little wonder that, at various dances and other social engagements where they  met, she should catch the appraising eye of Bertam Treverton, a young man for  whom, it was generally agreed, &ldquo;there was a bright future in store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Longmore&rsquo;s father was dead, but had settled  upon her, in trust, such an amount as would yield to her&mdash;in interest&mdash;a decent  income for life. At her death she might dispose of the principal moneys as she  chose. Her mother with whom she lived, was similarly placed, and was reputed to  be &ldquo;very comfortable.&rdquo; These facts rendered Lena  not less attractive to Bertram Treverton, who, with great good looks, a fine  figure and a little cash, had just established himself as a Solicitor in Chancery Lane, Melbourne.</p>
<p>As the friends on both sides expected, Bertram  Treverton&rsquo;s wooing was successful. Lena fell  head over ears in love with him, and her Mother, well satisfied with one who,  she felt, was bound to rise in his profession, gladly agreed to entrust her  daughter to his keeping. Their engagement was therefore announced, and,  immediately, congratulations poured upon Treverton, whilst all manner of good  wishes were conveyed to his prospective bride. There was thus very good reason  for believing that&mdash;in the days to come&mdash;they would be happy and content.</p>
<p>In due course they were married, and, about  twelve months later&mdash;to the joy of all concerned&mdash;a baby boy was born to them.  This event was the crowning glory of their happiness. No one, least of all the  proud parents, imagined that the child was to play a principal part in  completely severing them one from another. Yet&mdash;such is the way of life at odd  times&mdash;that is precisely what took place.</p>
<p>But to hark back a little. Shortly after their  marriage Bertram and Lena took a trip into the  hills. With Sherbrooke  they were so pleased that, after enquiry, they found and purchased a nicely  situated block of land. On it they erected a very comfortable cottage to which  they became very much attached. So much so, indeed, that at long week ends, the  Christmas and other holidays, it never occurred to them to go elsewhere. It was  quiet and restful; they had a certain amount of pride in its ownership, and  they had no desire to make a change.</p>
<p>At the second Easter time after their marriage  they again went to &ldquo;Hill-Holm.&rdquo; The baby, who had been named Harold, was then  eleven months old and remarkably vigorous for his age. He was Lena&rsquo;s  idol, and Bertram&rsquo;s delight. In him they found mutual pleasure, and it would  have been extremely difficult to convince any of their friends that the  well-mated pair were not now settled for life.</p>
<p>But none of those people knew of a rich and very  personable young widow who was the handsome Bertram Treverton&rsquo;s &ldquo;most valued  client.&rdquo; Neither did any of them know that she considered it necessary &ldquo;to  consult her lawyer&rdquo; about all sorts of matters, some of them quite outside the  legal or business side of her affairs. Least of all could the most knowing  amongst them have guessed that such a cool professional man had once spoken  proudly to her of his baby son, or that, thereafter, she had induced him&mdash;in  divers ways to tell again and again of the growth and health of the said son.  And, of course, no one was ever told that on one occasion, after a particularly  glowing account of the baby&rsquo;s perfections, the captivating young widow had  thrown her arms about her legal adviser, and, on his breast, had sobbed out  that she &ldquo;would give anything in the world to have such a child!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>On Easter Tuesday morning Bertram Treverton took  his son in his arms and went for a walk. There was nothing unusual in this for  he had many times previously done the same thing. His wife delighted in the  practice. It showed his fondness for the child. Moreover she was thus left  perfectly free &ldquo;to tidy up and prepare for the lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But on this occasion he did not return as  punctually as was his wont. After the lapse of twenty minutes or more beyond  his usual time, she went to the gate and looked up and down the road for a  sight of him. He was not to be seen. Thinking that perhaps he had gone further  than the customary distance, she decided to go back and read for a while. It  was useless. Anxiety, began to develop and kept her moving. To and from the  gate she must have walked a dozen times before it occurred to her that he might  possibly have gone to Fern Tree Gully. It was a long way, and he must have  taken a service car there&mdash;but had missed it on the return journey. Yes! Of  course! That was the reason of his non-appearance. And she steeled herself to  wait the upward passing of the afternoon cars.</p>
<p>Not in all her life before had time dragged so  wearily. It seemed as if the first car would never come in sight. When it did  her heart leapt for joy. But the car did not stop. The disappointment was a  great shock; yet it nerved her into hailing the next and questioning the  driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; He had seen Mr. Treverton, with the baby  in his arms, on the Railway Station in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; He did not see him enter the Melbourne train, and he  could not say whether Mr. Treverton was still at Fern Tree Gully. He had only  seen him once.</p>
<p>Almost in despair, she stood until the last of  the service cars had passed. A frenzy seized her. Hatless and in her house  boots, she ran this way and that way shouting her husband&rsquo;s name. Her cries  soon attracted attention, and friendly folk, asking the cause of her distress,  were deeply sympathetic but rather at a loss to advise. At last one young man  suggested that she run down to the Township in her husband&rsquo;s little car, and there  make enquiries. On learning that she could not drive he volunteered his  services. They were tearfully and thankfully accepted.</p>
<p>The journey to Fern Tree Gully seemed endless.  Yet the search for information was worse. Quite a number of women&mdash;and several men&mdash;had  remarked the somewhat rare sight of a man, walking alone, with a baby in his  arms. Three people&mdash;a Porter and two others&mdash;had noticed him on the Railway  Station; but not a living soul could say what had become of him. It was late  when the young man drove Mrs Treverton back to &ldquo;Hill-Holm,&rdquo; and put away the  car. The maid&mdash;who met her at the door&mdash;was only just quick enough to prevent her  falling to the floor.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The next morning, though somewhat bewildered by  the happenings of yesterday, Mrs. Treverton&nbsp;  strove to think what ought to be done. Sub-consciously she realised that  the situation called for action, but she could not bring her thoughts to any  fixed idea. Like the planes of a windmill they kept turning round and round in  the winds of her distress. And all the while in impotent inaction she kept  saying to herself: &ldquo;What am I to do? Oh! what am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly these despairing cries were hushed. The  maid ran in calling: &ldquo;A letter! A letter! A letter from Mr. Treverton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aflame with eagerness, Mrs. Treverton sprang up  and seized it. In anxious haste, and trembling with excitement she tore the  envelope open and withdrew the missive. The next instant, still standing, she  began to read it. And the waiting maid&mdash;eager as her mistress for good news&mdash;soon  saw that the reverse was the case. Tense with excitement, she stood there as  Mrs. Treverton&mdash;with widening eyes and tragedy in every expression of her face,  read on and on until she collapsed.</p>
<p>The letter was a long one. It read:</p>
<p class="note">My dearest Lena,</p>
<p class="note">I have, I think, gone mad. That at least, is  what any sober minded person would say of me and my actions. Yet I am sane  enough to see the folly of what I am doing, although I cannot find strength to  resist the doing of it. All my training&mdash;moral and intellectual&mdash;tells me that I  am doing wrong. In my heart I know and acknowledge that to be the truth.  Nevertheless there is a force within me that has overcome all mental control.  It is so strong as to have swept aside every domestic, social and business  obligation, and is driving me, as I fully realise, to an act of cruelty at  which I shudder, but which I must, perforce, perform.</p>
<p class="note">If I could help it I would not do the thing I am  about to do. My feelings for you are as warm and tender as ever they were.  Although my actions will contradict my words, I still love you. Brutality and  unkindness I hate, and I would not, therefore, willingly hurt you either in  body or in mind. But I have become the slave of such emotions that I have  yielded up the mastery of myself. By the destroying power of those emotions my  senses have lost their finer edge, and, under their compulsion and against my  wish, I know that I am striking you down as a tiger might his prey.</p>
<p class="note">To-day I am leaving Victoria for another State, never to return.  Your forgiveness I do not ask, for I am unworthy of it. But, in the hope that  you may understand, and maybe pity me, I set out those facts and circumstances  which have led me to desert the best wife in the world for pleasures that are  only promised, and may soon pall. This I do, not because it will ease your  mind, but because it will at least let you know what has become of me.</p>
<p class="note">As you know, John Donald&mdash;the Builder&mdash;was my  friend and client. When he died, six months ago, he left a large amount of  money to his widow. Under his will&mdash;which I drew&mdash;she was appointed sole  Executrix. I advised him to have a Trustee Company to act with her; but he  would not agree. His argument was that, as they had no children, she could do  what she liked; it was her affair. As a concession to my pressing the matter,  he inserted a clause saying that she was to consult with me whenever she felt  the need of legal or business assistance.</p>
<p class="note">The immediate, but not the final results might  easily have been foreseen. Almost at once Mrs. Donald came to see me about her  affairs. We talked about taking out Probate, and the preparation of the  necessary papers. When these were ready I wrote and asked her to come in and  sign them. Perhaps about a fortnight later she looked in to ask about her  house; should she sell it and take a flat? As dealings in real estate were  brisk I thought the proposal a good one, and so advised. Other calls followed.  After a time I found that my opinion or advice was being asked about such  things as books to read, plays to see, or the best place in the City at which  to dine.</p>
<p class="note">Naturally, I could not help feeling that these  evidences of her faith in my taste and judgment were not altogether impersonal.  My vanity was touched. I felt flattered by the trust she reposed in me, and the  day came when I ventured to ask her to dine with me at &ldquo;The Australia.&rdquo; The  food and the wine were good. She grew a little confidential; telling me  that&nbsp; there were times when she felt a  bit lonely. The meal with me, she said, had made us friends. Would I mind if&mdash;once  in a while&mdash;she came to see me for a chat, as she did &ldquo;so enjoy my conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">Once again I felt the gossamer touch of personal  interest. I was also vaguely stirred by the appeal in her voice, and so  replied:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Come whenever you choose. I am always delighted  to see you, and it will be a pleasure to help you in any way I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">Her visits increased in number. We talked more  and more about every day affairs. We dined together several times. One  afternoon I told her about our baby, Harold. I saw her eyes glisten, and I  thought she was going to cry. I forgot for the moment, that she had none of her  own&mdash;and I resolved that I would not again speak of the boy. Yet the very next  time she called she said: &ldquo;How is the baby getting on? Tell me more about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">I am afraid I let myself go. She listened  intently. Her eyes were riveted on mine. Once she stirred restlessly, and I  paused. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; she urged. I did&mdash;for a few minutes longer. Then a singular  thing happened. On a sudden impulse I rose from my seat. So did she. The next  moment I felt her arms around my neck and on my breast she was sobbing out:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Oh! How I wish I had a child! I would give  anything in the world to have such a child!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">I tried to soothe her with such words as came to  my tongue. I patted her shoulder, and, when she tearfully looked up at me I  kissed her on the cheek. She swiftly returned the endearment on my lips, and,  in a minute, was gone!</p>
<p class="note">The next day she called again. Almost  automatically we kissed each other. Hers was electrical, and marked the beginning  of the end for me. It started such a riot of passion in my breast that the  desire for her was constantly in my mind. Repetition fed it to a fury.  Sometimes I feared that you must notice my pre-occupation and comparative  indifference. But nothing really sobered me, and, as was inevitable, the time  soon came when I declared my desire and sought to win her to my will. She  refused, saying that only on two conditions would she consent. We must leave Australia,  and our baby must be hers.</p>
<p class="note">The shock was terrible. For a few minutes I was  dumb. Temporarily, sober reason was restored to me. As calmly as I could, I  told her I was quite prepared to go with her wherever she pleased, but I could  not have her rob you of both husband and child. She gave me one swift  inexplicable look and fled.</p>
<p class="note">Weeks passed. The smouldering fire flamed up  again. I telephoned her to come and see me. When she came I fell on my knees  and begged her to abandon the condition concerning the child. She sadly shook  her head and said:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I cannot! You do not understand. The child  means more to me than you will ever realise. Let me go!&rdquo; And with a sharp little  cry she ran from the room.</p>
<p class="note">More weeks passed. Quite by chance I met her in Collins Street.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Come to my rooms!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I want to talk to  you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">She came. And once again I tried by every  argument I could command, to alter her resolve. She flung herself into my arms,  and, between her tears and her kisses, repeated her previous statements. The  warmth of her body, her soft endearments and her distress drove me mad.</p>
<p class="note">I succumbed. We planned together how everything  was to be done. Arrangements were made in advance. By the time this letter  reaches you we shall be many miles away. It is useless for you to attempt to  follow. I regret my act. I think I always shall. But the power which swayed me  and committed me to the course I have taken I was too weak to resist. I wish  that I could still sign myself: &ldquo;Your loving husband&rdquo;; but, as I cannot do so,  I truthfully and humbly write instead:</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your  sincere well-wisher,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bertram  Treverton.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When Mrs. Treverton recovered from the fainting  fit which followed the reading of her husband&rsquo;s letter, she sat for a long time  silent and still. The shock she had received affected her so grievously as to  render her incapable of physical movement. Mentally, also&mdash;in a dull sort of way&mdash;she  realised her irremediable loss, and could think of nothing else. All her hopes  had been utterly destroyed. There was no need to do anything. She was as  lifeless and as cold as a stone. Yet, after the first feelings of desolation  and despair had more or less subsided, she began to wonder whether anything in  her own conduct had contributed to his lapse. She looked again at the sentence:  &ldquo;Sometimes I feared that you must notice my pre-occupation and comparative  indifference.&rdquo; Why had she not noticed it and been more kind. The baby&mdash;which  she had now lost&mdash;had absorbed her too completely. &ldquo;Women sometimes make that  mistake,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity they are not warned of the danger they  run in paying more attention to the child than to its father.&rdquo; Aloud she added:  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity I did not heed my Mother more. She knew, and tried to tell me; but  I was so sure of myself and of him, that I did not take it in!&rdquo; And rising, she  mechanically walked into the kitchen and began to prepare a meal.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The deserted wife gradually settled down at &ldquo;Hill-Holm.&rdquo;  The furnished flat that she and her husband had occupied in the City was now  distasteful to her, and she vacated it. An offer of a home with her Mother was  gently declined. Why, she scarcely knew, though later on she realised that, at  the back of her mind, there was the thought that if ever she was to see her boy  again it would be at the place from which he was taken. So it was that, for  more than twenty years, she had remained steadfast in her hope. Her Mother,  grown older, eventually came to &ldquo;Hill-Holm&rdquo; and stayed there until she died.  The maid&mdash;still with Mrs. Treverton&mdash;was thus the only sharer of her expectation  that the Postman would some day deliver the long awaited letter.</p>
<p>One morning he was earlier than usual on the &ldquo;Hill-Holm&rdquo;  side of his round. The reason was that at long last he had a weighty letter to  deliver to Mrs. Treverton. Intuitively he felt that it was an important  communication, and he was eager to see how she would receive it. If he had  imagined a joyful reception, he was not disappointed. She, also, took it for  granted that this was the letter for which she had so long hoped, and a smile  that was good to see lighted up her face. An instant later, two great tears of  joy rolled over the light pink flush of her cheeks, and, with a kiss for the  surprised man, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now Postman! Come to-morrow and I&rsquo;ll tell  you all about it after I&rsquo;ve read it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The envelope was a large one. It contained two  letters; a larger and a smaller one. The large one was sealed with red wax; the  other was endorsed: &ldquo;Read First.&rdquo; It was dated from Menzies Hotel, Melbourne, and this is  what it said:</p>
<p class="note">Dear Mrs. Treverton,</p>
<p class="note">My Mother is dead. She died in London five months ago. In her Will she  directed that I was to send you the sealed letter which is enclosed. Another  letter&mdash;addressed to me&mdash;and also sealed, I was instructed not to open unless I  heard from you. If, within a reasonable time. I do not hear from you I am to  burn it&mdash;unopened.</p>
<p class="note">As you see, I write from a Melbourne address. After settling my late  Mother&rsquo;s affairs I decided to visit Australia. This was partly due to a  desire to see the Country and partly the result of curiosity. The fact is I  consider it singular that your name&mdash;a rather uncommon one&mdash;should be the same as  my own. I wonder if we are related?</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours  faithfully,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold  Treverton.</p>
<p>On breaking the seal of the larger envelope Mrs.  Treverton withdrew the following letter. It was without a heading and undated;  but was addressed.</p>
<p class="note">To Mrs. Bertram Treverton,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hill-Holm,&rdquo; Sherbrooke,  Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>Immediately under the address the letter  abruptly began:</p>
<p class="note">The writer is unknown to you. I am the woman who  robbed you of your husband and child. During the last three years or more I  have been suffering from an incurable complaint. In a week or two I shall be  dead.</p>
<p class="note">For a long time I have contemplated writing as I  do now. Conscience, or a sense of justice&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;now guides my  pen.</p>
<p class="note">I believed that I loved Bertram. In a way I did,  he was very handsome. But it was the thought of the child&mdash;young enough to be  mistaken for my own&mdash;that captured my mind.</p>
<p class="note">We went first&nbsp;  to Sydney and then to Canada. After a holiday time in  that great Country we left for England,  where we intended to remain. We travelled as Mr. and Mrs. Treverton. I thought  we should not have done so; but Bertram would not agree to a change. He said he  wanted the boy to bear his own name always.</p>
<p class="note">One day, when we were on the way to England,  Bertram and I were in the forefront of the ship watching the long waves break  against the bow. Occasionally a little spray broke over us, but it was so very  fine that we rather enjoyed it.</p>
<p class="note">Probably to get a better view, Bertram decided  to sit upon the flat rail of the ship&rsquo;s side. I said nothing, for there was no  apparent danger. But he was barely seated before a wave, seemingly no different  from the others, reared itself up, and, sending a long curving arm into the  air, literally snatched Bertram from his position. I screamed with all my  might: &ldquo;Bertram&rsquo;s overboard! Bertram&rsquo;s overboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">The Officer on the bridge had seen what took  place. The ship was instantly stopped, and a boat lowered with Officers and men  in their proper places. They searched for quite a long while, but without  avail. Bertram was gone forever!</p>
<p class="note">This dreadful happening made me cling more  closely to Harold&mdash;the baby. I was alone in the world, and he was my only  solace.</p>
<p class="note">In England  I had him educated at Eton and Oxford.  He did well, and can, if he chooses, practice as a Lawyer.</p>
<p class="note">All his life Harold has looked upon me as his  Mother. I do not care to undeceive him without being certain that you are still  alive. It is to find out that I write. If you do not reply to his letter&mdash;which  must accompany this one&mdash;he need never know the truth. On the other hand, if you  do reply, he has instructions to open and read a letter he will receive from my  Solicitors after my death.</p>
<p class="note">In that letter I have told him everything. As my  last wish, I have asked him to go to you at once. I have also requested him to  convey to you my sincere regret at having selfishly kept you apart so long; and  to ask you to forgive the woman who, being denied a child of her own, loved yours,  and held him to herself with such strong ropes of affection that nought but  death could sever them.</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucy Donald.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Having read all that Lucy Donald had written&mdash;Mrs.  Treverton, without another moment&rsquo;s delay&mdash;telegraphed her son:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Come at once. I am waiting for you, Lena  Treverton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon receiving that message, Harold read his own  letter. It was a revelation to him. Not for a moment had he suspected the  relationship between them that the letter disclosed. All his life he had  believed the dead woman to be his Mother. But the story she had written bore  the impress of truth, and was so convincing that he immediately sent an urgent  wire to say:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Coming Mother. Leaving now. Harold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, as swiftly as the driver of a taxi-cab  dared to take him, he raced to Sherbrooke.  He arrived before his message. The sight of him gladdened his Mother&rsquo;s eyes,  for he was the resplendent image of his father. She fell into his arms,  overwhelmed with joy!</p>
<p>They talked until late into the night. But time&mdash;and  the cost of a waiting taxi&mdash;mattered nothing. She clung to his arm in such a way  that he knew she was afraid to let him out of her sight. A dozen times he said:  &ldquo;I shall come again to-morrow!&rdquo; But she only nestled the closer and whispered: &ldquo;There  is no hurry! It&rsquo;s a long time since I lost you! I want to feel that you are  really home at last, and that nothing will ever part us again! I have hungered  for you for so many years that I cannot let you go just yet! Be kind to me, my  son, and stay a little longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last he told her he had a confession to make.  On the ship by which he came to Melbourne  he had met an Australian girl&mdash;and they had fallen in love. He would like his  real Mother to see her, and he hoped, learn to love her as much as he did.  To-morrow, if he might, he would bring Miss Allan with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Of course! I shall not rest until I see  her. Bring her by all means, for I feel certain that I can love her if she  loves you!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And so it came about that she who lost her son had him  restored to her, and, in addition, gained a daughter who took the place of one  she had hoped to have in the days long gone!</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="KatesRing"></a>&ldquo;Kate&rsquo;s Ring&rdquo;</b></h2>
<p>For those who need &ldquo;a change of air&rdquo; Kalorama,  in the Dandenong Hills, is frequently recommended. Many Doctors think it an  ideal health resort, and so advise their patients. But, when Kate Kearney  agreed to act as house-maid and waitress at a favourite Guest House there, no  medical man was in any way responsible for her acceptance of the position.  Although she pretended that she took it with the utmost reluctance, the truth  of the matter is that she had her own private reasons for what she did; reasons  which she had no intention to disclose. Nevertheless, just before she left  Kalorama, Kate told Mrs. Britten, the Proprietress of &ldquo;Berry House,&rdquo; the whole  story, and so it gained a certain amount of local publicity.</p>
<p>Kate was Irish. She came from Kerry, and her  hair was as black as her eyes were blue. But the one was not in keeping with  the other, for there was a perpetual twinkle in her &ldquo;peepers,&rdquo;&mdash;as she called  them&mdash;which betokened a humorous outlook on life as well as an alert  intelligence. She may then have been forty-two years of age; but her cheeks  still held the rosy glow of youth, and&mdash;although she was so plump as to be  almost fat&mdash;her energy and sprightliness were remarkable. Yet these were not the  attributes which endeared her to all with whom she came in contact. No! It was  her permanent and irresponsible good nature; her odd sayings, her ready wit,  and, above all, her inherent kindliness, that won for her the affectionate  regard of those with whom she became acquainted.</p>
<p>The tales told about her ways and sayings are  almost innumerable. Some of the latter so impressed her Mistress that she was  never tired of repeating them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says the funniest things, you know! Quaint;  and witty too! Really, you cannot help laughing in spite of yourself. And she&rsquo;s  as quick as a flash of lightning. So fast, indeed, that you wonder how she gets  her thoughts together in such a brief space of time. One very trying day&mdash;I  remember&mdash;she sent the dinner-table people into a roar of laughter by some  remark she made about its being &ldquo;so hot the Devil couldn&rsquo;t sup his own soup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reproving her later I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Kate! Kate! However do you think of such  things to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shure I dunno M&rsquo;am!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;They jist  pop inta me head, an befoore ye can say &ldquo;knife,&rdquo; they shlips outa me mouth like  a lozenge ahead av a shneeze!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another subject for many an anecdote was the way  in which she rallied sickly guests or handled humbugs. To a thin and dyspeptic  looking man she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; would ye be havin&rsquo; an egg wid your tay  Misther Ross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thank you!&rdquo; Ross replied. &ldquo;I do not care for  an egg at tea time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thin, be the powers, take two!&rdquo; retorted Kate  with a rougish smile. &rsquo;Tis feedin&rsquo; ye want, an&rsquo; not med&rsquo;cin! Thim Docthors is  all for shtarvin&rsquo; their payshunts; an&rsquo; the thinner they kapes thim the fatter  their own fees! Look ut here Misther Ross!&mdash;There&rsquo;s no sinse in thryin&rsquo; to make  the Landlady&rsquo;s forchun by shcrimpin&rsquo; yer food! If ye&rsquo;ll be takin&rsquo; my advice, ye&rsquo;ll  ate an&rsquo; ate till I tell ye to shtop! I&rsquo;ll put some flesh on y&rsquo;ur bones, I will.  An&rsquo; some courage in your hearrt too! Be the time I&rsquo;m done wid ye ye&rsquo;ll be  wantin&rsquo; t&rsquo; take me in y&rsquo;ur arrms an&rsquo; kiss me!&mdash;Neow, what about that egg&mdash;or two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she looked at Ross so quizzically that he  felt constrained to say:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Very well! Bring them along and I will see  what I can do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On another occasion she took a spoiled child in  hand. Because he was a trifle anaemic&mdash;and his mother not properly insistent&mdash;constant  petting and coaxing had turned him into a merciless little tyrant; wilful,  fractious, unbiddable, unbearable. As the first meal was about to be served,  his mother said to Kate:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo! I really don&rsquo;t know what to do with Rupert.  He wont eat what I offer him and he persists in asking for things that I am  sure are not good for him. Perhaps you could persuade him to take the right  kinds of food. I should be so pleased, for the Doctor thinks that proper  feeding will be his salvation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ho! An&rsquo; is that so?&rdquo; said Kate, looking the  young rebel in the eye. &ldquo;An&rsquo; do you be tellin&rsquo; me&rdquo;&mdash;she said to him&mdash;&ldquo;that ye are  such a big bully as all that? Be the Saints I wouldn&rsquo;t have belaved ye c&rsquo;ud  treat your own Mother like that! Ye&rsquo;ll be thryin&rsquo; it on me next, I suppose? But  it won&rsquo;t go down wid me Masther Rupert! I&rsquo;m that shtrong that I c&rsquo;ud kill ahnny  one wid a blow av me fisht!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! But I&rsquo;m kind too!&rdquo; she quickly added,  nodding her head affirmatively. &ldquo;Thim that I likes I brings the titbits from  the kitchen! Whist neow! Wait till I tell ye somethin&rsquo; your Mother caan&rsquo;t hear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she stooped and whispered in his ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come inta the kitchen, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll show ye the  loveliest t&rsquo;ing ye iver saw in yer life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He followed her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that neow!&rdquo; said she, pointing to a hot  roast turkey just ready for cutting up. &ldquo;Did ye iver see ahnnything so foine?  Shure your Mother&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo; ye to have a bit av the breast. Don&rsquo;t take it.  Ask fer the leg! An&rsquo; whin ye get it, pick it up in your fingers an&rsquo; bite the m&rsquo;ate  off the bone! &rsquo;Tis the shw&rsquo;atest &rsquo;atin&rsquo; ye iver thried!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so saying she winked at him in such a  confidential way&mdash;and yet with such a dare-devil look on her face; that the boy  sensed a game, and was instantly ready to play it.</p>
<p>They returned to the dining room. The bell had  rung for dinner, and the guests were seated. Rupert took the chair allotted him&mdash;opposite  his mother. When asked if he would have some roast turkey he promptly replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes please! Bring me the leg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Rupert!&rdquo; said his Mother; &ldquo;why not have a  piece of the breast? I&rsquo;m sure it would be much better for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I want the leg. And I&rsquo;m going to have the  leg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate brought it. A minute later he had it in his  fingers; and nothing his Mother could say would induce him to put it down until  he had picked it clean.</p>
<p>Of course, such conduct was quite improper, and  Kate knew it. But that was her way of gaining the boy&rsquo;s confidence, and to such  good purposes did she put it that&mdash;within a fortnight&mdash;his health had improved  and he was ready to eat whatever was given to him, Moreover, so subtly did she  influence his mind that his treatment of his Mother was decidedly better. She,  poor soul, thought it was all due to the mountain air; but could she have heard  the lessons Kate taught him when they were alone&mdash;which was often, for he was  her slave and followed her everywhere&mdash;she would certainly have doubled Kate&rsquo;s  tip.</p>
<p>As indicated, Kate easily won the good-will and  affection of almost all with whom she came in contact. Amongst others, Pearl  Grey&mdash;Mrs. Britten&rsquo;s younger sister&mdash;and Wyvern Waite, to whom Pearl was engaged to be married, were greatly  tickled with her effervescent humour. They were Members of the same Comedy  Company, and each was a rising star in the Theatrical Profession. On holiday  together at &ldquo;Berry House,&rdquo; Pearl renewed a  previous acquaintance with Kate, and Waite&mdash;despite Pearl&rsquo;s praise of her powers&mdash;was in no way  disappointed with her first exhibition of them.</p>
<p>But&mdash;before giving an account of &ldquo;the Session&rdquo;&mdash;as  Waite called it&mdash;a few words about a &ldquo;preliminary scene&rdquo; will pave the way to  the other. Of this scene nothing might have been heard except for Kate herself;  and then only because she mentioned it in connection with an enquiry concerning  a household matter.</p>
<p>Somewhere about nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning  after Waite&rsquo;s arrival at &ldquo;Berry House,&rdquo; Kate came to Mrs. Britten and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If y&rsquo; pl&rsquo;ase Ma&rsquo;am, would I be makin&rsquo; eliven o&rsquo;clock  tay f&rsquo;r iverybody t&rsquo;day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Mrs. Britten replied&mdash;not taking her  eyes from the letter she was writing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Kate! Of Course! Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; Kate slowly answered, &ldquo;nayther Miss  Pearrl &rsquo;r Misther Waite &rsquo;d have ahnny in bed this morning, an&rsquo; I wonder&rsquo;t if  they&rsquo;d be takin&rsquo; tay at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement caused Mrs. Britten to lift her  eyes, and looking at Kate she said&mdash;reflectively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes! I think so!... I know my sister takes  tea&mdash;and most men, now-a-days, like &lsquo;one at eleven!&rsquo; I think you might get it  ready for all the guests as usual!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; wid shwate biscuits f&rsquo;r all I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;  queried Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!... No!&rdquo;&nbsp;  answered Mrs. Britten. &ldquo;Better make a few sandwiches in case Mr. Waite does  not care for biscuits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allright Ma&rsquo;am! I&rsquo;ll do as y&rsquo; say!... But might  I be askin&rsquo; another question?... Is Misther Waite in his right moind, &rsquo;r is he  an acthor&mdash;like y&rsquo;r sisther&mdash;Miss Pearrl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! He&rsquo;s an Actor, Kate!&rdquo; replied Mrs.  Britten. &ldquo;And&mdash;so my sister says&mdash;he&rsquo;s as full of fun as an egg is full of meat!  But whatever made you think he wasn&rsquo;t in his right mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! Ma&rsquo;am &rsquo;Twas the way he carried on whin I  tuk him in his earrly mornin&rsquo; tay!... First av all he calls me He&mdash;Kate! Did ye  iver hear the like? &ldquo;Hello He-Kate!&rdquo; sez he as soon as I open&rsquo;t the doore.  Thin, as I stept in, he rowl&rsquo;t his eyes around&rsquo;t as if he wuz in mortal agony,  an&rsquo; sez in a hoarse kind av a voice: &ldquo;Get eout. He-Kate! &rsquo;Tis not yet time f&rsquo;r  toads on toast!&rdquo; ... An&rsquo; whin I dropped the cup an&rsquo; skedaddled, I c&rsquo;d hear him  laffin&rsquo; like a hyena!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last statement&mdash;and the puzzled look on Kate&rsquo;s  face&mdash;moved Mrs. Britten to laughter; but quickly recovering she said</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Kate! That was just his fun. He dearly  loves a joke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; is that so?&rdquo; snapped Kate. &ldquo;Thin be the  powers I&rsquo;ll be ready f&rsquo;r &rsquo;im the next time he thrys wan on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Kate!&rdquo; said Mrs. Britten sharply. &ldquo;Please  remember that the guests at &ldquo;Berry House&rdquo; are to be treated with respect&mdash;and  don&rsquo;t be rude to anyone! Both you and I may sometimes feel annoyed at things  which are said or done; but, for the good of the House we must bear them  patiently!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; said Kate, demurely. And she  softly left the room.</p>
<p>As to &ldquo;the Session&rdquo; itself, some introduction is  necessary.</p>
<p>When previously at &ldquo;Berry House&rdquo; Miss Grey twice  assisted in entertaining the guests at what was called &ldquo;An Evening Party.&rdquo; Kate&mdash;seated  somewhere out of sight&mdash;had been greatly impressed with her impersonations of  several well-known actresses, and afterwards told Mrs. Britten that she thought  her sister was &ldquo;the greatest mimic in the worrld!&rdquo; This remark she repeated on  learning that Miss Grey was again coming to Kalorama; and it was at her  suggestion that&mdash;on the evening of their arrival&mdash;Mrs. Britten had induced her  sister and Waite &ldquo;to do something&rdquo; on the following night.</p>
<p>In keeping with this promise&mdash;about an hour after  Kate&rsquo;s description of how he had &ldquo;carried on,&rdquo;&mdash;Waite entered the  Reception-Reading Room to do a little rehearsing. After carefully closing the  doors, he took a small book from his pocket and started reading to himself. A  minute or two later&mdash;apparently satisfied&mdash;he said aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! I think I know it now!... Let me see&mdash;it  will have to go like this!&rdquo; And turning to an imaginary audience he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen! I am come to speak the  prologue to our play to night!</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The World&rsquo;s a stage, as Shakespeare said one  day:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stage a world&mdash;was what he meant to say!<br>
  The outside world&rsquo;s a blunder, that is clear.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the real world that Nature meant is here!<br>
  Here every foundling finds its lost Mamma!<br>
  Each rogue, repentant, melts his stern Papa!<br>
  Misers relent; the spend-thrift&rsquo;s debts are paid&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cheats are taken in the traps they laid;<br>
  One after one the troubles all are past&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the fifth act comes right side up at last,<br>
  When the young couple, old folks, rogues and all.<br>
  Join hands, so happy, at the curtain&rsquo;s fall!<br>
...Ours then, sweet friends, the real world to-night.</p>
<p>But&mdash;just as he uttered the last word&mdash;there was a  loud knocking at the door on the right. In a flash Waite turned and laughingly  called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in if you&rsquo;re fat! Stay out if you&rsquo;re lean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly Kate opened the door: a broad grin on  her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ho! My Irish Kate!&rdquo; exclaimed Waite, and  without a pause, merrily warbled:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;And how do the praties in Ireland now do?<br>
Is the cow-milk as shwate as it used to be too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No less quickly&mdash;and imitating him to perfection&mdash;Kate  replied:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; as well&mdash;Misther Acthor&mdash;as you!<br>
An&rsquo; t&rsquo;day ye&rsquo;ll have both in a good Irish Stew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This effort so astonished Waite that, in sheer  admiration, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate! You&rsquo;re a jewel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! I know!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;Rough-cut an&rsquo; red,  like the ruby in the Sultan av Eyesore&rsquo;s hat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a brave attempt at gravity, Waite corrected  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! Kate! Not Eyesore; Mysore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; she said&mdash;doing her best to be dignified&mdash;&ldquo;I  seen his picture wanst; but I disremember whether &rsquo;twas Eyesore, Mysore, or His-sore that  wuz printed underneath ut!...But phwat I do remimber is that he had as mahnny  jew&rsquo;ls on his chest as a Mother Superior &rsquo;ud have in her hearrt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooroo for Ireland!&rdquo; half shouted Waite. And  then added&mdash;much more soberly&mdash;nodding his head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Kate, I think I&rsquo;ll have to kiss  you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate showed no surprise. On the contrary she  archly said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! &rsquo;Tis allright be me!... But ye won&rsquo;t find  me so tasty as y&rsquo;r shwateheart&mdash;Miss Grey!... Shtill&mdash;if ye care t&rsquo; risk it&mdash;&rsquo;twill  be like a birthday t&rsquo; me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Birthday? Is this your Birthday, Kate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! But &rsquo;tis just twenty-six years ago t&rsquo;day  since I had me first kiss fr&rsquo;m a mahn in Austhralia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha!&rdquo; yelled Waite. &ldquo;Come hither, my  bouncing beauty, and I&rsquo;ll give you one to remember!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon he stepped forward, swept her into his  arms, and kissed her warmly on her cheek and lips.</p>
<p>Breaking free, Kate quickly tried to get back to  the normal state of affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neow that&rsquo;ll be enough Misther Wyvern Waite!  Shure if Miss Pearrl were t&rsquo; come in neow y&rsquo;d be in throuble allright ...  Carryin&rsquo; on wid the likes av me! It won&rsquo;t do at all&mdash;at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course Waite pretended to be abashed; and  seeing this, Kate more composedly asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neow tell me! Couldn&rsquo;t I be callin&rsquo; ye somethin&rsquo;  else than &lsquo;Misther Wyvern Waite?&rsquo; &rsquo;Tis a fancy name t&rsquo; be shure&mdash;but &rsquo;tis a  terrible mouthful too! ... Couldn&rsquo;t I say &lsquo;Misther Wyvern&rsquo;...&rsquo;r &lsquo;Misther Waite&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much amused, Waite slowly replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! We might arrange that matter, Kate!.. You  see, my familiar friends call me &lsquo;Wyvern&rsquo;; others call me &lsquo;Waite&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ho!&rdquo; Kate chortled. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis just the same wid  meself! Ye see&rdquo;&mdash;imitating his style&mdash;&ldquo;the familiar wans call me Kate&mdash;others call  me Wait-ress! Ye can call me Kate if ye like!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And out of the room she ran; her contagious  laughter catching Waite before he could frame a reply.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When Kate had been at Kalorama a little over  four years, a most unusual incident occurred. Without warning, she did not  appear to serve afternoon tea at the appointed hour. This neglect of duty was  so extraordinary that her Mistress&mdash;Mrs. Britten&mdash;thought she must be unwell, and  went to enquire.</p>
<p>On entering Kate&rsquo;s room&mdash;after knocking&mdash;Mrs.  Britten was astonished to find her valued assistant in tears. As she said  later:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sight almost took my breath away. As you  know, Kate was the cheeriest soul I ever had in my house. Yet there she stood&mdash;with  a letter in her hand&mdash;just delivered by the afternoon post&mdash;silently weeping. &ldquo;Why  Kate,&rdquo; said I&mdash;when I could find words&mdash;&ldquo;Whatever is the matter? You crying!  surely you must have had some bad news. Tell me, can I help you? What is it?&rdquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis for joy Ma&rsquo;am that I weep,&rdquo; she answered  with a watery smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m that proud I c&rsquo;ud fill the Mystic Lake wid  me tears! Somebody&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; to see me&mdash;one that I haven&rsquo;t been t&rsquo; see meself for  years an&rsquo; years! An&rsquo; me just achin&rsquo; t&rsquo; see him all the time. Oh! &rsquo;Tis proud I  am that he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; t&rsquo; see me neow! Yes! Ma&rsquo;am an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s a Riverint too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Reverend? Do you mean that a Priest is coming  to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Ma&rsquo;am! He&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; t&rsquo;morra!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! But I must tell ye all about him! I&rsquo;ve just  got t&rsquo; tell somebody or I&rsquo;ll break in two wid joy. Haven&rsquo;t I kep meself an&rsquo; me  sowl bottled up fer years? Haven&rsquo;t I shut me teeth an&rsquo; bit me tongue from  tellin&rsquo; anybody why I kem t&rsquo; Kalorama, an&rsquo; the secret av me life? But, be the  Saints, I&rsquo;ll be happy t&rsquo; tell ye all about it neow. Don&rsquo;t l&rsquo;ave me! Let me tell  ye at once&rsquo;t &rsquo;r me hearrt&rsquo;ll burst.&rdquo; And she caught Mrs. Britten by the arm to  make sure that she would stay!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye see Ma&rsquo;am, &rsquo;twas like this: Whin the  American Naavy kem t&rsquo; Melbourne,  in 1908, I was workin&rsquo; fer me marrit sister who was keepin&rsquo; a Boordin&rsquo; House at  Port Melbourne. An&rsquo; one evenin&rsquo;, whin I&rsquo;m shtandin&rsquo; at the doore watchin&rsquo; the  Sailor bhoys go by, up comes a red haired gossoon wid sea-blue eyes an&rsquo; the  whitest laffin&rsquo; teeth ye iver see!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Kate!&rdquo; sez he, wid a shmile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! Pat!&rdquo; sez I, returnin&rsquo; his grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d yew know m&rsquo; name baby?&rdquo; sez he, wid a  soft sort av dhrawl on his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the same way as ye knew mine!&rdquo; sez I.  &ldquo;Guessed it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; a mighty good guess I guess!&rdquo; sez he,  laffin&rsquo; pretty, an&rsquo; showin&rsquo; his white teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thin sez he t&rsquo; me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;Yew know, yew&rsquo;re the livin&rsquo; image av me  cousin Kate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; is that so?&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;An&rsquo; d&rsquo; you  know that&mdash;although I haven&rsquo;t got a cousin Pat&mdash;you&rsquo;re the livin&rsquo; image av him,  an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a fact!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wid that he gave such a beautiful rollin&rsquo; laff  that it sent a tingle down me shpine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say&rdquo; he wint on, &ldquo;would yew like to go to a  dance t&rsquo;night</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I like t&rsquo; go to me own weddin&rsquo;?&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;an&rsquo;  me dancin&rsquo; mad! Thry me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along thin baby!&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; yew  around town t&rsquo;night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ye are, are ye? An&rsquo; me not even knowin&rsquo; y&rsquo;ur  name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me phwat the bhoys call me!&rdquo; sez he. &ldquo;Pee  Jay&rdquo;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allright &lsquo;Pee Jay&rsquo;,&rdquo; sez I. &ldquo;Just wait &rsquo;til  I put on me hat!&rdquo; An&rsquo; I rusht inside t&rsquo; get it. But as I was goin&rsquo; out me  Sister Mary yelled: &ldquo;Where ye goin&rsquo; Kate?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t tell her, for I was that  excited I couldn&rsquo;t even think!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ma&rsquo;am he gev me the time av me life. An&rsquo;  whin he was l&rsquo;avin me at me own doore he ups an&rsquo; sez, sez he:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would yew like t&rsquo; come aboard m&rsquo; ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; sez I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit partic&rsquo;lar; an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t  want to be captured be a pirate! Is y&rsquo;ur ship respectable&rsquo; An&rsquo; ahnnyhow, phwat&rsquo;s  its name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ver-mont&rdquo; sez he, handin&rsquo; me a narrow green  ribbon wid the name printed on it in gold letthers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Very well thin!&rdquo; sez  I. &ldquo;Seein&rsquo; that ye have ould Ireland&rsquo;s colours in y&rsquo;ur ribbon, I&rsquo;ll  risk it an&rsquo; go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morra?&rdquo; he asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; sez I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allright! Kiss me good-night Kate, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be  lookin&rsquo; out fer yew to&rsquo;morra afternoon about three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; sez I, pretendin&rsquo; like. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m that shy I  couldn&rsquo;t kiss ahnny one in the dark! An&rsquo; besides, I like t&rsquo; see who&rsquo;s kissin&rsquo;  me! But I&rsquo;ll tell ye phwat I&rsquo;ll do. Afther I&rsquo;ve been aboord, an&rsquo; whin I&rsquo;m l&rsquo;avin&rsquo;  the ship I&rsquo;ll give ye two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wid that he sweeps me into his arms, Ma&rsquo;am; an&rsquo;  I&rsquo;m all av a thrimble whin I get inside!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next afthernoon me sister Mary did&rsquo;nt want  me t&rsquo; go. She said that the Yankees were a murtherin&rsquo; mob. Down-right  blagyards! Birds av passage, widout ahnny morals &lsquo;r scruples. An&rsquo; she was just  goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; say somethin&rsquo; else whin I ups an&rsquo; shpeaks me mind:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s jealous ye are; me bein&rsquo; taken  aboord an&rsquo; not yourself? Well! I&rsquo;m takin&rsquo; the risks av this &ldquo;murtherin&rsquo; mob,&rdquo;  an&rsquo; not you!&rdquo; An&rsquo; I shticks me nose in the air an&rsquo; marches out while she stands  there wid her mouth open at me audacity in defyin&rsquo; her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! But t&rsquo;was a queer afthernoon ahnnyhow!  Phwat wid gun&rsquo; down t&rsquo; the Pier; an&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; on boord a puffin&rsquo; and stutterin&rsquo;  little t&rsquo;ing av a boat; an&rsquo; me nearly tumblin&rsquo; inta the watther when it rolled  as I shtepped on a rickety s&rsquo;ate; an&rsquo; me hat fallin&rsquo; down behind me head while  I wuz climbin&rsquo; up a kind av a ladder alongside the big battleship&mdash;shore I was  almost ready t&rsquo; cry wid worry an&rsquo; excitement! An&rsquo; whin I did get aboord little  chance I got t&rsquo; see the ship&mdash;wid him takin&rsquo; me inta places where there was  nobody else&mdash;so that he c&rsquo;ud cuddle me an&rsquo; squeeze me just as he pleased. Not  that I didn&rsquo;t like it meself. But whin me sister Mary asked me what I thought  av the ship, all that I c&rsquo;ud tell her was that it had more dark corners than a  cat&rsquo;s castle!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well Ma&rsquo;am! He kep takin&rsquo; me out all the time  his ship was in poort. An&rsquo; I had the father an&rsquo; mother av a glorious time!  Dancin&rsquo; an&rsquo; &rsquo;atin&rsquo; an&rsquo; goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; the the-atre until me very sowl seemed t&rsquo; be  swimmin&rsquo; in joy. Shure I&rsquo;ve niver had ahnnything like it befoore &rsquo;r since!...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once he brought me up t&rsquo; Kalorama here! in me  day off &rsquo;twas. I thought it the beautifullest place in the worrld. An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s  why I kem back here. One night,&mdash;I disremember how long it was afther I first  met up with him,&mdash;he sez t&rsquo; me as we were sitting&rsquo; on the grass in Albert Park:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate! I&rsquo;m shtarvin&rsquo; f&rsquo;r yew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; sez I, enquirin&rsquo; like. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re shtarvin&rsquo;  are ye? Well. I&rsquo;m hungry myself. Hungry &lsquo;s Hell fer coals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great jumpin&rsquo; geewhillikins!&rdquo; he sorter shouts.  &ldquo;D&rsquo; yew know phwat I mane? or hev ye got the notion av a hash-house an&rsquo; some &rsquo;ates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; sez I, lookin&rsquo; at him like a pussy cat  watchin&rsquo; a Tom comin&rsquo; over the fince. &ldquo;No! I wasn&rsquo;t thinkin&rsquo; about phwat ye calls  &lsquo;hot dawgs,&rsquo; &rsquo;r fish and chips!&rdquo;...</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that, Ma&rsquo;am, is all I&rsquo;ll be tellin&rsquo; ye  about that!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whin me baby kem, Mary, me sisther treated me  well. &rsquo;Twas the child that did it; me baby bhoy. Up to that time you&rsquo;d think  that her voice had been oiled wid vinegar&mdash;she was that scornful about me bein&rsquo; &lsquo;in  throuble&rsquo;, an&rsquo; the &lsquo;disgrace t&rsquo; the family,&rsquo; and all that! But shure I wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;in  throuble.&rsquo; I was that happy wid Pee Jay&rsquo;s babe comin&rsquo; t&rsquo; me that I could very  nearly have sung the &lsquo;Boyne Watther&rsquo;. an&rsquo; God knows that&rsquo;s harrd chune fora  loyal Irish gerrl t&rsquo; sing! No.! She wasn&rsquo;t bad at all! She let me kape the bhoy  at the boordin&rsquo; house till he was three years old. The little darlint thin  bekem such a thrial,&mdash;runnin&rsquo; all over the place, an&rsquo; wantin&rsquo; so much watchin&rsquo;  an&rsquo; tendin&rsquo;, that I just had t&rsquo; take him to the Catholic Bhoys Orphanage. Oh! &rsquo;Twas  a hearrt break fer me, so it wuz!...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Av course I had t&rsquo; tell the Riverint Father in  charge the whole story! An&rsquo; whin I had tould him it all.&mdash;l&rsquo;avin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; eout,&mdash;his  face was as harrd as a tombstone, an&rsquo; his for&rsquo;head as wrinkled as a washin&rsquo;  boord!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; sez he, as solemn a&rsquo; an owl, &ldquo;ye  committed a mortal sin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glory be t&rsquo; God fer that!&rdquo; sez I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phwat&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;In the name av the  Holy Virgin phwat are ye sayin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; sez I shlowly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis shurely betther t&rsquo;  commit a mortal sin than an immortal one!&rdquo; An&rsquo; I giv a bit av a laff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Kate!&rdquo; sez he, wid a funny shmile, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re  incolligible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m not&rdquo; I snaps &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what I want  fer me bhoy t&rsquo; be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phwat?&rdquo; sez he,&mdash;wid a puzzled frown,&mdash;&ldquo;Phwat d&rsquo;  you mane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mane,&rdquo; sez I, dhrawlin&rsquo; me words. &ldquo;that I  want&mdash;me bhoy&mdash;brought up&mdash;in a college!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ho!&rdquo; he chuckles. An&rsquo; in a minnit he had a  big book on the table, an&rsquo; was askin&rsquo; me the divil&rsquo;s own questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phwat&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; sez he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pee Jay,&rdquo; sez I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; sez he impatiently, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want t&rsquo;  know his initials, I want t&rsquo; know his full name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; amn&rsquo;t I tellin&rsquo; ye his full name? Shure  that was his father&rsquo;s name,&mdash;the only one I iver knew,&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve called him  afther his father! Phwat more would ye be wantin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; sez he, &ldquo;If ye cannot be tellin&rsquo; me his  father&rsquo;s real name, tell me the name av his ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Verr-mont!&rdquo; sez I, on me dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh Ah!&rdquo; he pipes, shtrokin&rsquo; his chin, an&rsquo;  lookin&rsquo; at me in a queer kind av a way. &ldquo;Oh Ah! The &lsquo;Ver-mont&rsquo; Eh? That means &lsquo;green  hill,&rsquo; Good! Very good! Thin we&rsquo;ll call y&rsquo;r &lsquo;Pee Jay&rsquo; be the name of &lsquo;Patrick  Joseph Greenhill!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; neow, Ma&rsquo;am, he&rsquo;s the Rivirint Father  Greenhill! Oh! I&rsquo;ve worked fer him, and saved fer him, an&rsquo; ped fer him at  College. Sent me money all the years till he was educated an&rsquo; bekem a Priest,  an&rsquo; me only seein&rsquo; him at odd times, an&rsquo; him never knowin&rsquo; that I&rsquo;m his marrit  mother, Oh! Mother av Moses, phwat am I sayin&rsquo;&mdash;I really m&rsquo;ane that he doesn&rsquo;t  know I&rsquo;m un-marrit! He thinks me a widdy! Oh! &rsquo;tis a haard worrld whin ye have  t&rsquo; dec&rsquo;ave y&rsquo;r own son! An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the reason I haven&rsquo;t seen much av him&mdash;an&rsquo;  not at all fer the last six years!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye see, Ma&rsquo;am, I didn&rsquo;t let him know where I  was whin he grew up a bit,&mdash;for fear he might ask me awkward questions! Oh! &rsquo;Tis  shtarved I was fer the sight av him. But I had t&rsquo; bear it. Thin I see be the  papers that he was goin&rsquo; down t&rsquo; Tasmania t&rsquo; take charge av a Parish there, an&rsquo;  the Mother&rsquo;s hearrt av me wouldn&rsquo;t let him go widout me seein&rsquo; him. So I wrote  him a letther a coupla days ago, On y&rsquo;ur letther paper Ma&rsquo;am. But instead av  signin&rsquo; &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; as I did before,&mdash;years ago,&mdash;whin I wuz sindin&rsquo; him a little  pocket money,&mdash;I sign&rsquo;t it &ldquo;Kate Greenhill, care av Mrs. Britten, Kalorama!&rdquo; An&rsquo;  me that scared&rsquo;t fer fear the divil &rsquo;ud be noticin&rsquo; pwhat I wuz doin&rsquo; an&rsquo; hold  it agin me. But I fooled him, Ma&rsquo;am. Oh! Yes! I tricked him allright! Ye see,  Ma&rsquo;am, he caant stand the Word av God; an&rsquo; he just flies from an open Bible! So  I just borrit y&rsquo;urs; open&rsquo;d it wide; put me letther on the face av it; an&rsquo; sign&rsquo;t  it like a dacent marrit woman!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah! But  neow I&rsquo;m in throuble, f&rsquo;r he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; t&rsquo; see me tomorra, Yes Ma&rsquo;am! Real  throuble, f&rsquo;r altho&rsquo; me hearrt is filled wid joy, me mind is thremblin wid  anxiety! . , An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye all this; an why I&rsquo;d be askin&rsquo; ye t&rsquo;  do me the greatest favor in the worrld... Would ye lend me y&rsquo;ur weddin&rsquo; ring  fer the time me bhoy&rsquo;ll be here?... An fer the love av the Holy Virgin don&rsquo;t be  callin&rsquo; me ahnnything but Kate &rsquo;r Mrs. Greenhill, f&rsquo;r I wouldn&rsquo;t have him  shamed,&mdash;not t&rsquo; be an angel in Heaven! No! Ma&rsquo;am! I wouldn&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s the  truth... &rsquo;twill be the lasht time I&rsquo;ll be seein&rsquo; him, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d always like t&rsquo;  have him believe himself as good as the best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Kate concluded her story. It had been told so  rapidly,&mdash;and under such a strong wave of emotion,&mdash;that, at the end, she was  shaking with nervous excitement. Tears were not far from her eyes,&mdash;and seeing  her state Mrs. Britten patted her on the shoulder and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There there Kate! You know that I&rsquo;ll do  anything I can for you. Yes! You shall even have the use of my wedding ring  during the time that your son is here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This show of kindness completely upset Kate&rsquo;s  reserve. She threw her arms around Mrs. Britten&rsquo;s neck and sobbed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! God bless ye Ma&rsquo;am! I&rsquo;m shure I don&rsquo;t know  phwat I&rsquo;d be doin&rsquo; widout y&rsquo;ur help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Britten gently disengaged herself from  Kate&rsquo;s embrace, and, with motherly cheerfulness, proceeded to give her some  advice,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now Kate, you should begin to think about  the meeting with your son, To-morrow you must put on your best black dress and  a clean white apron and cap,&mdash;for you must look as nice as you can... And,  whatever you do, do not weep. Men hate tears more than anything. It makes them  feel awkward and helpless. Just be your own bright self and all will be well.  And one more matter before you go back to your work. If you would like me to  keep you company whilst you are waiting your son&rsquo;s arrival to-morrow, I&rsquo;ll do  it. We can sit at the window and watch for the car together, and you will not  then feel so nervous. Here&rsquo;s my ring! You had better get used to the feel of it  on your finger, Now be off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with a grateful word of thanks Kate left the  room.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The next day was full of excitement for Kate;  and, indeed, for all others at &ldquo;Berry House,&rdquo; Almost as soon as lunch was over,  Kate prepared for the meeting with her son. He was expected to arrive about  three o&rsquo;clock. As that hour drew near, Kate dressed as suggested, and wearing  Mrs. Britten&rsquo;s wedding ring, went to the big window of the dining room and  stood gazing towards the entrance gates of the grounds. Presently her Mistress  joined her, for she, better than anyone else, understood the strain under which  Kate was labouring. And it was well that she did, for Kate was so filled with  interest, anxiety and love that she might otherwise have given way to her  emotions, As it was, Mrs. Britten&rsquo;s calming touch upon her arm kept her silent&mdash;though  not exactly still.</p>
<p>Precisely on time the Reverend Father Greenhill&rsquo;s  car drew up at the gate, As he came up the garden path all could see what a  fine figure of a man he was, and&mdash;when he got closer to the house&mdash;how handsome  he was as well. To Kate he was such a splendid being she could hold herself in  no longer, but&mdash;in a sort of awed whisper&mdash;said to Mrs. Britten:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Look ut him Ma&rsquo;am! The livin&rsquo; image of Pee  Jay! The very height an&rsquo; hair an&rsquo; eyes av him! Ah! there he shmiles; an&rsquo; the  dead rink av Pee Jay too! Glory be to God Ma&rsquo;am, I hope I won&rsquo;t faint wid joy!  An&rsquo; look at the shtyle av him too! Shure the Almighty caan&rsquo;t be very angry wid  me &lsquo;mortal sin&rsquo; whin he gev me a mahn like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment she was in his arms,</p>
<p>An hour or so later Kate was having a delightful  time listening to her son, who, it appeared, had already visited Tasmania, and was filled  with enthusiasm for its people, and what he hoped to accomplish in the Parish  to which he had been assigned. Suddenly he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to come to Tasmania with me? I shall probably be there  a very long time&mdash;perhaps for the rest of my life. Any return to Melbourne&mdash;even  a flying visit&mdash;is highly problematical&mdash;so that, unless you come to see me, we  may never meet again, And that is the last thing I should like to happen, for,  now that I have found you, Mother dear, I do not feel like losing you, I have  no doubt I could find you a place over there; or you might even act as my  house-keeper, and then we could see each other as often as we liked; maybe every  day, If the idea appeals to you as much as it does to me, then you have only to  tell me so and I will make all the necessary arrangements. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phwat do I say? Would I like t&rsquo; go t&rsquo; Tasmania wid ye? Don&rsquo;t  be askin&rsquo; me such a silly question. Shure I&rsquo;d go wid ye to the Cannibal Islands  if I had the chance&mdash;an&rsquo; me that plump I&rsquo;d be makin&rsquo; the haythin divils&rsquo; mouths  watther. Av coorse I&rsquo;ll go wid ye to Tasmania&mdash;or  ahnny other place in the worrld if ye&rsquo;d be askin me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Kate paused, and meditatively added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about goin&rsquo; is l&rsquo;avin&rsquo;  Mrs. Britten widout givin&rsquo; her dacent notice. She&rsquo;s been that good an&rsquo; kind t&rsquo;  me, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been so happy wid her, that I don&rsquo;t like l&rsquo;avin&rsquo; her in the lurch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Indeed!&rdquo; said Father Greenhill,  reflectively. &ldquo;That certainly would not be right. But could we not ask her  about it, and get her consent?... If need be I could leave you here for nearly  another week; but that would be cutting things very close, You see, the boat  leaves to-morrow week; and you would surely want some little time in the city  before sailing. There must be quite a number of things you would like to  purchase in Melbourne rather than in Tasmania!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as the last words were uttered. Mrs.  Britten came into the room, They naturally caught her ear, and, with a faint  tone of anxiety in her voice, she quickly asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about Tasmania, Kate? Are you proposing to take a  trip there some day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before Kate could answer, Father Greenhill  took the question up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is, Mrs. Britten, Mother has just  promised to come and keep house for me in Hobart!  She is very loth to leave you on short notice, for she has an affection for you  which is very deep-seated I find. But my time is limited, and, if not  inconvenient to you&mdash;she would like to get away about a week from now! That will  leave her a little more than a day in the city. Not much time to purchase  things she may require; but it will have to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although undoubtedly surprised, Mrs. Britten  promptly replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, Father Greenhill, it  will be inconvenient. But it would be just the same in a month&mdash;or a year!... I  have never had anyone else as competent as Kate&mdash;or who was as popular with the  guests... I shall miss her very much indeed&mdash;and so will many others.... Yet,  not for anything would I press her to stay with me. I know how she loves you,  and it would be a shame to keep you apart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind! Very kind!&rdquo; murmured Father  Greenhill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Britten. &ldquo;It is no  more than her due. Kate has earned the joy that has come to her, and&mdash;so far as  I am concerned&mdash;well&mdash;&lsquo;Berry House&rsquo; will manage somehow. Indeed, she may leave  whenever she pleases&mdash;even to-day&mdash;if it will make her as happy as she deserves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This generous gesture so astonished Father  Greenhill that he could scarcely contain himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really&mdash;Mrs. Britten&mdash;you overwhelm us with  kindness. To-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Father, to-day! .... I can see that you do  not quite understand. But the truth is I am trying to help myself&mdash;as well as  Kate&mdash;your Mother! Every hour, every minute that she remains with me now will be  a heartache for both of us. It is better that the parting should take place at  once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These brave words&mdash;although quietly spoken&mdash;did  not hide from Father Greenhill the deep emotional strain under which Mrs.  Britten laboured in giving them utterance. Her entirely unselfish attitude  revealed a spirit of generous kindliness as rare as it is beautiful. He was  greatly moved, and it was with a sincere appreciation of her self-sacrifice  that he hastened to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Britten, your sentiments&mdash;and your  generosity&mdash;do you credit! I can resist neither! And so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go t&rsquo;day!&rdquo; rapturously interjected Kate. &ldquo;Oh!  Ma&rsquo;am! Ye are the finest woman in the wide wide woorld!...An&rsquo; though I&rsquo;m l&rsquo;avin  ye t&rsquo;day&mdash;shure I&rsquo;d die f&rsquo;r ye tomorra!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she laughed so happily that the tenseness of  the situation was immediately relieved.</p>
<p>Discussion of departure details immediately  followed. The news that Kate was leaving late that afternoon soon spread  amongst the guests, Two of them assisted her to get ready, and several others  made her little presents, Mrs Britten added a purse containing five one-pound  notes, And so it came about that, her bags packed, arrayed in her best, and  with hat and gloves on&mdash;amid a small shower of fond farewells&mdash;Kate left Kalorama  for ever.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Although unnoticed by her son&mdash;and in spite of  her personal discomfort&mdash;Kate kept her gloves on until she was &ldquo;booked in&rdquo; at  the Melbourne Coffee Palace.</p>
<p>Shown to her room&mdash;which, of course, he must  inspect&mdash;she swiftly took off her hat and the distressful gloves. With the  removal of the latter she gave a startled look, and, in pretended dismay  exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at that me darlint!&rdquo; Holding out her  left hand, &ldquo;Would ye believe that ahnny woman could be so shtupid? B&rsquo;t I was  that excited about goin&rsquo; away wid ye&mdash;an&rsquo; so bustled about gettin&rsquo; me things t&rsquo;gether&mdash;that  I&rsquo;ve left me ring behind. In the name av God, Pee Jay&mdash;excuse me f&rsquo;r callin&rsquo; ye  by y&rsquo;r father&rsquo;s name&mdash;phwat will ye be thinkin&rsquo; av me? Am n&rsquo;t I the crankiest  divil av a craythur ye iver set eyes on? Oh! Phwat&rsquo;ll I do? Phwat&rsquo;ll I do?&rdquo;&mdash;she  almost wept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do? Mother dear. Do? You&rsquo;ll just come along  with me at once, and I&rsquo;ll buy you a new one! Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, the heavy hat and distasteful gloves  had to go on again, But what did Kate care? She had played her cards so  successfully that, at the moment&mdash;there could not have been a happier woman on  earth. But she was far too clever to show her triumph, and it was with an air  of grateful meekness&mdash;like unto one who has received a gracious gift&mdash;that she accompanied  her son to a jeweller&rsquo;s shop.</p>
<p>Once inside the door her attitude changed. She  put on all the dignity and calm that she could command; firmly resolved that  her demeanor should in no way belittle her son. Nevertheless, what took place  must have seemed extraordinary even to the case-hardened attendant who came  forward to serve them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Mother has lost her wedding ring and wants a  new one! Would you kindly show us some of your best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the word &ldquo;best&rdquo; Kate lifted her left eyebrow  in such a peculiar fashion, and looked at the shopman with such a mixture of  love and pride in her eyes, that he could scarcely refrain from laughing,  Controlling his feelings, however, he managed to utter a respectful &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo;  and opening a glass case behind him&mdash;took out a silver tray on which were set,  on a strip of black velvet, a number of plain gold rings, A thick and heavy one  was instantly picked up by her son, who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try this one, Mother! It&rsquo;s a beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Kate&mdash;who instinctively knew it to be the  dearest of them all&mdash;exhibited no enthusiasm. Somewhat slowly&mdash;and with a very  dubious look on her face&mdash;she put it on her finger; but could not refrain from  moving her hand this way and that to note the effect, As was plain to see, it  fitted perfectly; but she abruptly took it off, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis too thick, Shure it would shpread me other  fingers so badly they might think they were bein&rsquo; pushed off me hand, I&rsquo;d be  uncomfortable I would!&rdquo; And, with a surreptitious wink at the salesman, she  added: &ldquo;Pick me a thinner wan if you pl&rsquo;ase!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the man knew his work, and&mdash;seeing that her  son wished her to have a really good ring&mdash;he pressed her to take the expensive  one, saying that it was a perfect fit, and that in time she would get used to  wearing it, This was not what she had expected from him. Instead of getting his  help&mdash;as she hoped would be the case when she gave him the wink&mdash;he persisted in  his attempt to effect the sale of the highest priced ring, This annoyed her,  and she showed it in her own characteristic way,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look ut here me fine bhoy! Ye shop walkers an&rsquo;  the like get used t&rsquo; pushin&rsquo; things on to people that they don&rsquo;t need, an&rsquo; at  threble the price they&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo; t&rsquo; give! I won&rsquo;t be havin&rsquo; me son pay away  money that c&rsquo;ud be put to a betther use! &rsquo;Tis waste it is, an&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t shtand  for &rsquo;t! So ye can put y&rsquo;ur rings away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Hush! Mother!&rdquo; interjected her son, &ldquo;The  price doesn&rsquo;t matter in the least, I want you to have a really good ring!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ho! Ye do, do ye? An&rsquo; me nearly forthy-six  years ould. Shure I&rsquo;ll be dead befoore tis half worn out, an&rsquo; ye&rsquo;ll be buryin&rsquo;  the half av yer money wid me poor ould frame. Go along wid ye! If ye&rsquo;z will be  shpendjn&rsquo; so much money, buy me one at half the price&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be takin&rsquo; the  other fer new clothes fer me silver weddin&rsquo;&mdash;altho&rsquo;, glory be, that&rsquo;s past  ahnnyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These remarks, despite their obvious sincerity&mdash;were  yet so humorously expressed that neither the shopman nor Father Greenhill could  refrain from laughing. And though their mirth affected Kate, (whose own risible  faculties were easily moved), she, being in serious mood, was none the less a  little surprised at it, and so looked at them with such an air of puzzlement  that it only added fuel to the fire. But&mdash;seeing how matters stood&mdash;Father  Greenhill quickly recovered his gravity and made haste to add:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re incorrigible, Mother! But please  yourself! I want you to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shure I know phwat ye want!&rdquo; interrupted Kate, &ldquo;But  &rsquo;t is a long time since I heard that worrd befoore! An&rsquo; like y&rsquo;rself &rsquo;twas a  Riverint Father that used it too!... How d&rsquo;ye say it? In-col-ligible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! No! Mother dear! It&rsquo;s pronounced &lsquo;in-corr-igible,&rsquo;  and it means that you cannot be corrected: You will have your own way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; why not t&rsquo; be shure?&rdquo; queried Kate, lifting  her right shoulder and elevating her left eyebrow in such a comical manner that  the shopman had to turn away and smother another laugh. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t ye givin&rsquo; me  the choice av a ring t&rsquo; suit meself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Yes! Of course! That&rsquo;s exactly what I want  you to do!&rdquo; answered her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thin be holy Saint Pether I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; Kate  firmly retorted. And she quickly turned to the counter, picked a ring from the  tray and added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ye are me honey! Half the price, an&rsquo; just  as good! Put it on me finger! an&rsquo; may the blessin&rsquo;s av Heav&rsquo;n folla ye till the  end av yer days!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>That night&mdash;after a most wonderful day&mdash;Kate lay  in bed thinking of her good fortune. She had not switched off the electric  light, and&mdash;looking at the ring as it shone upon her finger&mdash;she whispered to  herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Kate! Kate!&mdash;ye wicked divil&mdash;ye don&rsquo;t  deserve it. Here ye are wid a weddin&rsquo; ring on y&rsquo;ur finger... An&rsquo; put there be a  Priest! Why, &rsquo;tis almost the same as gettin&rsquo; marrit in Churrch! Glory be, &rsquo;tis  nearly too beautiful to be thrue... An&rsquo; you wid a lovin&rsquo; son, too! An&rsquo; him that  handsome that he looks like a pic&rsquo;ture, Oh! &rsquo;Tis wonderful indade! Shure the  Almighty has fergiven ye intirely, or He wouldn&rsquo;t be so good to ye afther all  these years! An&rsquo; ye&rsquo;re gun&rsquo; t&rsquo; Tasmania,  too!...Where nobody&rsquo;ll know ahnnythin&rsquo; about y&rsquo;r past! ... An&rsquo; where ye can be  y&rsquo;r son&rsquo;s Mother&mdash;an&rsquo; tend him&mdash;an&rsquo; do f&rsquo;r him&mdash;an&rsquo; love him till ye die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as two big tears of joy welled into her  eyes, she added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Father in Heav&rsquo;n! &rsquo;Tis thankful I am&mdash;wid  all me sowl!... Pl&rsquo;ase don&rsquo;t let me lose me joy, &rsquo;r me bhoy! An&rsquo;, be the ring  av love,&rdquo; kissing it&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll serve ye night an&rsquo; day till I&rsquo;m done wid the worrld!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying&mdash;she switched off the light; and with a  murmured: &ldquo;Dear God&mdash;Good-night,&rdquo;&mdash;she once more pressed the ring to her lips,  and so fell asleep!!!</p>
