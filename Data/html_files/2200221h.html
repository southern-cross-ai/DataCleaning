<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. The White Flower of a Blameless
Life</h2>

<p>I have never attended anything more impressive than the funeral
of Pierre Curvellier. Autumn in Brittany is always beautiful, and
that year it seemed more beautiful than ever. St. Cyr-en-Bois lies
at a sharp angle of the Rinse. Sleepy old white buildings with grey
stone roofs nestle around the hill capped by the splendid dome of
the Sacred Heart. The narrow cobbled streets are steep and winding,
and are always crowded with slow-moving and quick-talking people,
in blue, and grey and white; pigs and cattle wander
indiscriminately, and sometimes you meet an ox-cart. The air has a
tang of apples and salt, and burning peat, and the products of
people who live by the soil. The woods are turning brown and
crimson and golden. Everything goes slowly at St. Cyr-en-Bois.</p>

<p>And up the winding streets the funeral cort&#65533;?¨ge of my
old friend went very slowly. Everyone walked. The coffin covered by
a deep purple pall was carried by priests. Acolytes carried the
Sacred Image. Censers swung, and the priests chanted in unison.
Madame Curvellier, tall, distinguished, and in deepest mourning,
leant, on the arm of her handsome son, L&eacute;on. The procession
must have been a quarter of a mile in length. The men stood
bareheaded, the women wept, and making the sign of the cross,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"God be merciful to our wise man."</p>

<p>All around one heard the muttered words of love and praise.</p>

<p>"Mother of God, but he was a good man. When my little Jeanne was
sick, he sat all night applying lotions..."</p>

<p>"He loved the poor. Who is there to take his place?"</p>

<p>"They say he lent that rascal Couperin the money to rebuild his
house, which he had burnt down in a drunken orgy."</p>

<p>"He forgave the boy who stole his fowls. Five times he forgave
him."</p>

<p>"He worketh for the poor, but he never took money from the
poor."</p>

<p>At the top of the hill the procession halted. In front of the
church a platform had been erected by the side of a catafalque.
Deputy Longuet, wearing the ribbon of the Legion of Honour, mounted
the platform and prayed. The crowd stood with bowed heads. Then
deputy Longuet stood up and addressed them. He was a short,
pale-faced man with a square black beard. He spoke in a rich
vibrant voice, charged with deep emotion. His voice carried across
the square.</p>

<p>"Before committing the body of our friend to the last solemn
rites of the holy Church, you have done me the honour to invite me
to address you," he began.</p>

<p>"Your request fills me with pride and humility. Pride at the
honour you confer on me, humility at my power to carry it out
worthily. You called him 'The Wise Man of St. Cyr-en-Bois' and you
were right. Today we proclaim him not only the Wise Man of St.
Cyr-en-Bois, but one of the wise men of France. Today the whole
heart of France bleeds with St. Cyren-Bois. She mourns the loss of
one of her most distinguished sons.</p>

<p>"He was my friend for thirty years or more. It is easy for me to
extol his virtues, but to pay tribute to the genius of his
intellect is a task of which I am not capable. It will take
time&mdash;perhaps a century&mdash;before the full measure of his
worth shall be proclaimed. He wrote many books, and many that have
not yet been published or adjudged. A lawyer, a scientist, a
philosopher, a man of letters, for a time a member of the Senate,
his whole life was consecrated to the betterment of his
fellow-creatures. The fruits of his intellect are the heritage of
us all. His works adorn our libraries, his teachings on ethics
remain a standard, the influence of his legislation still colours
our actions. He was a member of the Acad&eacute;mie, and France
does not forget. And France will not forget. His name shall be
written in letters of gold upon her scrolls through all posterity.
The fragrance of his memory shall survive the living episodes of
our time.</p>

<p>"Well, may you weep, my friends! Well may France weep! ... and
then when our hearts are filled to overflowing we will turn to God
and rejoice. Rejoice that in our time so great and good a man
should live; rejoice that France still sends forth into the world
noble spirits like Pierre Curvellier to work for her eternal good.
If I speak of his work in faltering terms, hesitating for the right
expression, it is only because it is not yet adjudged. I may say
too little or too much. But when I speak of the man himself, his
character and life, I have no misgiving. I may say too little, but
I cannot say too much. His life was crystal-clear, ennobled by a
great simplicity. His mind was an open book for anyone to read. At
an early age God granted him the greatest boon He can give to
man&mdash;a good wife. A loving husband, an affectionate father, a
loyal citizen, he was one of those men of whom it may be truly said
that no breath of scandal ever marred the serene nobility of his
name. He stood for all that was best and purest in this town, for
all that was best and purest in France. For the vile he had
compassion, for the poor charity, for the ignorant knowledge, and
for everyone&mdash;help and comfort. His great intellect was an
instrument used by him for the advancement of his moral
precepts.</p>

<p>"Holding high office in the town he served the poor with equal
consideration to the rich. Blessed with a home life of
irreproachable purity and beauty, he set it before men without any
ostentation, a place of comfort and welcome to all, a living
example to those less fortunate. Of him no evil word was spoken, no
envy, hatred, or malice engendered. He made no enemies. He lost no
friends.</p>

<p>"And so he passes on. Supreme in the councils of his country,
courageous in her adversities, steeped in her erudition, tolerant
of her faults, we commit his body reverently to the sacred dust of
St. Cyr-en-Bois, where he was born and where he spent the great
energies of his life, confident that his spirit rides on in triumph
to the glory of his country, to the glory of God."</p>

<p><br>
Deputy Longuet bowed, and a low murmur of approval rippled across
the square. The procession continued its way to the church. As the
librarian of the Municipal Library and an intimate friend of
Monsieur Curvellier, many of the townspeople knew me, and came
forward to press my hand and to mutter a word of sympathy.</p>

<p>"It is an hour of desolation for St. Cyr-en-Bois," said one.</p>

<p>Old Gabriel Fabre, who had closed his &eacute;picerie
establishment for the day as a token of respect, gripped my
hand.</p>

<p>"The deputy spoke well," he said. "Sublime...sublime. As he
said, 'not one word of scandal.' A pure life...a perfect life. God
rest his soul."</p>

<p>I was a secessionist from the Roman Church, but I had no
intention on that account to omit any respect which I could pay to
the memory of my old friend. Nevertheless, in the congestion which
occurred by the church doors, a sudden mood came to me to escape
from all the ceremony for a time and to enjoy a few moments'
solitary reflection. I wandered on into the cemetery and listened
to the deep notes of the organ. The leaden sky was reflected in the
dim waters of the Rinse. Nature appeared to be attuning itself to
the melancholy hour. I leant against the wall beneath the cypress
tree and my heart was heavy within me. Not a word of scandal!...How
blessed is the rain which falls, and the wind which blows the
yellowing leaves away and time which purifies the brown hills
against the coming of another spring, another cycle of birth and
life and death again. In the mausoleums of history, you may read
the records of great men inscribed in deathless marble. Loaded with
honours and dignity they go to their rest "without a breath of
scandal." Their lives are still to be read like an open book. The
purity of their domestic state, the love of their children, the
cleanliness, and honour, and chastity of their actions. And
yet&mdash;was there ever a garden, however fair, where the weeds
did not grow?...</p>

<p>I remember when he first came to St. Cyr-en-Bois, the young
notary, with a large brass plate in the little street off the
market-place. His coming attracted little attention. He was already
married to his tall, graceful wife, and they had two young babies.
The peasants and tradespeople of our province have no great love
for lawyers. They fear them and avoid them as much as possible.
They admired the erect figure of Monsieur Curvellier, his charm of
manner, his classic distinguished features with the penetrating
eyes. But perhaps his whole bearing savoured too much of the actor.
It was foreign to them. They preferred snuffly old Boyson, who
robbed them but did it with a certain amount of bluntness which
they mistook for candour. It was the skill with which he handled
the case of the widow La Roche against the depredations of an
overbearing landlord that first drew public attention to him. And
then after that a remarkable fact was discovered concerning him. He
had a genius for forgetting to send in an account to a poor
client.</p>

<p>I was one of the first people to make his acquaintance, for the
library was almost the first place he visited, and he remained an
indefatigable patron till the end of his days. I was immediately
impressed by the restless energy of the man. He absorbed books as
greedily as a cocotte will absorb scandal or petits-fours. He
appeared to have read everything and yet to thirst for more. He was
particularly interested in science and metaphysics, but he did not
despise history, or fiction, even the work of modern writers.</p>

<p>"I want to know everything, Monsieur Barzac," he said to me one
day. "Everything there is to know, and then I want to co-ordinate
it."</p>

<p>He invited me to his house and we became great friends. The
m&eacute;nage of Monsieur and Madame Curvellier was a model of what
a home should be.</p>

<p>Madame Curvellier was a charming hostess, devoted to her husband
and the two children. The house was furnished in the best of taste.
I often dined there, and afterwards we would sit talking till a
late hour upon the evolution of literature, the wonders of life,
the mysteries of science, when Madame Curvellier would go and place
her arms around his shoulders and say:</p>

<p>"Now, my dear..."</p>

<p>I knew the sign and I would jump up and say:</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons! I am keeping you up."</p>

<p>And Madame would smile at me and say:</p>

<p>"It is a great delight to have you, Monsieur Barzac, but you
spoil my husband. You are bad men, both of you. These late
hours!"</p>

<p>And Monsieur Curvellier would pat her hand and say:</p>

<p>"Tyrant! One must talk. Life is to be talked about!"</p>

<p>And she would reply:</p>

<p>"It is more important to live than to talk about life."</p>

<p>Then we would all laugh, and I would seek my hat.</p>

<p>She was a pretty woman with chestnut hair and dark reflective
eyes. Her adoration of Pierre was an experience merely to have
observed. She understood him profoundly. She studied his every
little move, and wish and fancy. She gave him everything which she
thought right for him to have, but she did not spoil him. I was
conscious of her ever managing him, like a mother with a clever
child.</p>

<p>One day when we were alone she said to me:</p>

<p>"Pierre is a genius. It is very difficult. A genius can never
stand alone. It has to be supported."</p>

<p>I did not understand her at the time, but in after years I often
thought over this remark. All the "difficulties" of Pierre
Curvellier were hidden from the world. They were packed around with
cotton-wool by his wife. He adored her, but he had no idea how he
relied upon her.</p>

<p>That he was a genius was a fact that was not proclaimed for many
years. His zeal for social progress soon inveigled him into
politics. At the age of thirty-three, when his son and daughter
were aged respectively eleven and ten, he was elected as a member
of the Senate for our department. The family left for Paris, where
they remained for nine years, in the meantime paying constant
visits to St. Cyr-en-Bois. Political life worried Monsieur
Curvellier considerably. He fought hard for his ideals, but he was
not happy. Whenever he came to Si. Cyr-en-Bois he always visited
me. His eyes sparkled when he beheld the covers of the old
volumes.</p>

<p>"Lucky fellow! Lucky fellow!" he would mutter. "I am becoming
embittered." He had little time for literature or scientific
research, but some essays on various ethical and scientific
subjects were already attracting attention.</p>

<p>One evening he arrived unexpectedly from Paris and came straight
to my house. His face was pale and drawn, but his eyes were shining
with a new excitement.</p>

<p>"It is finished," he said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I have resigned. It has taken me nine years, old friend, to
discover that I am not fitted for a political life. Possibly...it
has not all been wasted. I have done what I could."</p>

<p>I pressed his hand. "They spike of you as the coming man. There
is no office you might not have filled."</p>

<p>"I know. I know. But I am tired of them. It is all machinery and
corruption. One does not get down to essentials. One tinkers and
potters. The people one is most anxious to help are the people who
understand one least. There is an eternal impasse of
misunderstanding. But now..."</p>

<p>"Now, what are your plans, Monsieur Curvellier?"</p>

<p>He was very agitated, almost mysterious.</p>

<p>"My wife and daughter and I are coming back to St. Cyr-en-Bois.
My son is remaining in Paris to study architecture. I shall resume
my practice to a limited extent. And then I have other
ambitions."</p>

<p>Suddenly taking me by the shoulders he continued:</p>

<p>"This is a secret just between ourselves, Monsieur Barzac. I
have the ambition to write a complete history and analysis of
philosophy. And I do not wish the world to know. I shall do it in
secret. And I shall crave your help and encouragement."</p>

<p>I naturally expressed my keen anxiety to assist in this noble
project, and thanked him profusely for his confidence and friendly
trust.</p>

<p>It was then that the wise man became established at St.
Cyr-en-Bois. It was for me one of the happiest periods of my life.
During the ensuing five years the character of Monsieur Curvellier
seemed to reach its apotheosis. His finely modelled face, marked by
years of struggle and spiritual turmoil, assumed a placid, almost
saintly, mien. His hair was turning grey, but his figure was still
very erect. His eyes were the eyes of a dreamer, a seer. But when
addressed, they lighted up with quick sympathy. It was at this time
that the peasants first began to call him: "The wise man of St.
Cyr-en-Bois." They worshipped him. Every important dispute was
submitted to his decision. His word was never doubted, his opinion
never disputed.</p>

<p>He found time to help the poorest of them. With their instincts
of reverence and their ready faith in superstitions, they began to
attribute to him almost divine powers. No man in the province had
such power over them.</p>

<p>And Madame Curvellier still watched him, and managed him, and
mothered him. Proud of his genius, but not blinded by it. Proud of
his character, but never relaxing her gentle control. Their pretty
daughter Louise married the son of an Italian diplomatist and went
to live in Milan, and so Monsieur and Madame Curvellier were alone,
except for occasional visits of their son or daughter. Madame
Curvellier interested herself on various committees of charitable
institutions, assisted her husband in some of his work, kept house
for him, and unostentatiously shaped the course of his life.</p>

<p>The great work on the evolution of philosophy proceeded apace.
In three years' time he had completed two long volumes. It was to
be a five-volume work with an exhaustive index. He made an
arrangement with me that for certain hours in the afternoon he
worked in my house. I set apart a room for him specially for this
purpose. The arrangement had many advantages. For one thing, he was
never interrupted there by clients. It was a kind of hiding place.
The clerks in his office were instructed to say that they did not
know where Monsieur Curvellier was. In addition to that, mine was a
very quiet house just outside the town, in a secluded dell, and the
room I lent him was one that had been built on by a former client
and used as a laboratory. It had a separate entrance through a
small vegetable garden. I gave Monsieur Curvellier a latch-key so
that he was quite free to come and go whenever he wished. Madame
Curvellier approved of this scheme, and instructions were given
that when occupying this sanctum, consecrated to so noble a
purpose, under no circumstances was he to be disturbed.</p>

<p>Occasionally he invited me in to discuss some point of
reference, and when he did I always glowed with pride to observe
the steadily-growing pile of manuscript, and to think that my
humble abode should be the workshop of what might prove to be an
epoch-making composition.</p>

<p>The whole thing worked most satisfactorily. Those were halcyon
days. Love and community of interest, charming friendships, the
growing fame of our "wise man," pleasant social diversions,
glorious nights of talk, the eternal beauty of our Brittany
landscapes, occasional new friends to stimulate our mental outlook,
and always life going on and on, growing, improving, leading to
finer ends...</p>

<p>Summers and winters passed almost imperceptibly. And then one
summer there happened what I should have imagined to be an almost
unbelievable episode. It shook all the foundations of my belief. It
threatened to destroy the delicate fabric of happiness of a whole
community of people. It was unreasonable, improbable, terrifying,
like an inexplicable cyclone on a cloudless day in summer.</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile from my house on the main road to St.
Cyr-en-Bois was an obscure caf&eacute; called the Cafe &agrave; la
Colonne de Bronze. Occasionally on a summer's evening I and some of
my friends would take a glass of syrup and seltzer or a cup of
coffee, and sit and enjoy the sunset over the Rinse. It happened
that summer that the caf&eacute; changed hands and was occupied by
a Monsieur and Madame Bonzard, and their daughter Pauline. For my
part I was disappointed at this change, for I had always liked old
Poiret, who owned the place before and who had died after a
seizure, and I did not like these Bonzards at all. They were a
greedy, quarrelsome couple, and the daughter was a vain, frivolous,
consciously pretty little coquette. She had masses of fair hair,
and a furtive, supplicating feline manner. She was one of those
women, not uncommon in our big cities, who always seem to carry on
their persons the aroma of a possible romance. She spoke very
little, but her deep grey eyes were ever watchful, as though you or
I might possess the key to unlock the gates of some mysterious
paradise for which she yearned. She was very appealing. I detested
her.</p>

<p>I ask you then to conceive of my surprise when one night,
returning home from the library, I found Monsieur Curvellier and
Pauline Bonzard sitting facing each other at one of the little
tables overlooking the river. The actual event might not in itself
have been very surprising&mdash;the Wise Man of St. Cyr-en-Bois
talked to everyone&mdash;but there was just something, a certain
attitude of interest and absorption which arrested my attention. I
joined Monsieur Curvellier and the girl arose and went inside. He
greeted me in the usually friendly manner, but there was something
a little distracted and self-conscious about it. I naturally made
no comment and shortly afterwards we arose and went on to my house,
talking about the book.</p>

<p>I dismissed the incident from my mind, but a week later I found
them there again at a table inside. Even then I did not attach much
importance to the occurrence. My friend was now forty-seven,
grey-haired, married to a woman he adored, the father of two
charming children, a man of unique reputation for honour and
integrity, incapable of an evil thought.</p>

<p>It must have been another coincidence when I beheld him&mdash;I
believe it was, but I could not swear to it&mdash;strolling with a
girl who looked like Pauline Bonzard in a lane near my house an
hour after sun-fall.</p>

<p>It was indeed not till two months later&mdash;the end of
July&mdash;that my suspicions could no longer remain dormant. I had
thrust them back again and again. I simply would not listen to
their ugly voice. But one evening coming home a little earlier than
usual, I had cone into my garden to smoke a pipe before dinner. I
strolled about idly examining my roses and calceo-larias, and
listening to the pleasant drone of bees. When I reached the edge of
the vegetable garden I heard the sudden click of the little gate
connecting the laboratory with the garden. I looked over the hedge.
A figure came stealthily from beneath the porch and elided down the
path into the road. It was Pauline Bonzard.</p>

<p>Then suddenly I felt my heart beating rapidly. It was
unthinkable. Pierre! what possible interests could he and this girl
have in common? I refused to believe that there could be anything
in the nature of an intrigue. The girl must be in trouble of some
sort and Pierre was helping her. I waited till she was well out of
sight, then I walked round and tapped on the laboratory door. After
a brief interval a voice said: "Come in." When I entered the room I
could no longer persuade myself that the affair was entirely
insignificant. My old friend blushed and looked confused like a
school-boy caught stealing apples. He was feverishly spreading out
his manuscript on the table. He glanced at me and at once became
boisterously affable. What was I to do? Should I show him that I
had observed the visit? With anyone else I might have resented this
abuse of my hospitality, but with Pierre Curvellier the case was
different. As Madame said&mdash;he was a genius. My dearest friend,
destined perhaps to be one of the greatest men in France. My
mission obviously was to try and protect him. Madame Curvellier was
right. Genius was unable to look after itself. I said nothing, but
I'm afraid by my confusion I showed that I knew. Perhaps, after
all, it was the best way. We sat and chatted for a little while
about the events of the day, and then I left him.</p>

<p>That night I gave the matter mature consideration. I'm afraid my
conclusions were entirely Pagan. My friends, although my life has
been spent among books, I try to persuade myself that I am a man of
the world. We all know that these things go on. Let us be honest. I
decided that there was no great harm in Monsieur Curvellier's
little love affair, provided it did not become too serious, that it
did not compromise either of the parties, that it was kept quite
secret. Indeed the idea intrigued me a little, that so saintly and
intellectual a man should succumb to the wiles of a worthless
little minx.</p>

<p>"In a couple of weeks it will be all over," I thought to
myself.</p>

<p>But in a month's time it was not all over, and the case began to
alarm me. I feared these Bonzards who would not hesitate to cause a
scandal if it served their purpose. The couple were frequently
together, and my housekeeper informed me that she had seen the girl
go into the laboratory nearly every afternoon and stay several
hours. I tried to allay her suspicions by remarking that I believed
she was doing some work for Monsieur Curvellier, though what the
nature of the work might be I had not sufficient imagination to
suggest. Moreover, at this time the character of Monsieur
Curvellier was undergoing a change. He appeared restless and
distraught. In the occasions when I went to dine with him and his
wife, he assumed an attitude of jovial good-fellowship which did
not seem real. It was overdone. And then he would have sudden
periods of abstraction when he hardly seemed conscious of our
presence. I observed Madame Curvellier watching him closely, but
her face gave no impression of doubt or suspicion.</p>

<p>One day I decided on a very bold step. I went one morning and
visited Pauline. I asked her for a few moments' discussion of an
important matter alone. She looked a little apprehensive, but she
walked out into the road with me. When we were out of sight of the
inn, I said:</p>

<p>"My dear girl, I want to be quite frank with you. Monsieur
Curvellier is an old friend of mine. It is not for me to criticize
the actions of either him or you. I only want to implore you for
both your sakes to be circumspect. Do you not think that the time
has come when this friendship might end without dishonour or
scandal?"</p>

<p>She turned her languorous eyes to mine, and her bosom heaved.
Then she said in a breathless whisper: "I love him."</p>

<p>"The devil you do!" I thought, and I was completely nonplussed.
I did not like it at all. This catlike little creature looked
tenacious. She would take a lot of disengaging from her victim if
once she had her claws in. I offered her a considerable sum of
money to leave the town and she refused. I could do nothing with
her at all.</p>

<p>My worst suspicions were now confirmed. There was nothing left
but to tackle Monsieur Curvellier himself. It was a task I did not
relish. I let the weeks drift by hoping against hope that the
affair would end. I knew that he knew that I knew what was going
on. We never once referred to Pauline, but we became a little
self-conscious in each other's society. On occasions he avoided me.
It could not go on.</p>

<p>At last one evening I could stand it no longer. The girl had
been again. It was late in the evening. Hardly had she disappeared
down the road before I burst into his room.</p>

<p>"Pierre," I exclaimed, "I implore you, by all that you hold
sacred, by our old friendship, let this thing cease."</p>

<p>He gave me a quick pleading look, then suddenly he sat down and
buried his face in his hands. His voice came hoarsely through a
bosom struggling to choke down the sobs.</p>

<p>"I love her! I live her."</p>

<p>"The devil you do!" I thought.</p>

<p>This was appalling. That Pauline should love Monsieur Curvellier
was quite conceivable. But that Monsieur Curvellier should love
Pauline was a midsummer madness. What could they have in common?
What could he find to talk to her about? Where was that strength of
character which had raised him where he was, and made his name a
byword for honour and integrity in the town? I was very distressed.
I sat down and gazed at him, and muttered helplessly:</p>

<p>"I cannot believe it, Pierre. I cannot believe it."</p>

<p>He stood and paced the room, throwing at me glances of mingled
anger and contrition. He was obviously nonplussed how to act. I
pleaded with him once more, but he suddenly turned on me and
said:</p>

<p>"I beg you leave me to think this out alone."</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders and left him.</p>

<p>I hoped the next day to have a visit from him and a frank
acknowledgment of his unseemly lapse, but to my astonishment he
acted in just the opposite way. He wrote me a curt note. He thanked
me for my kindness in having lent him the laboratory for so long,
but under the circumstances he did not feel that he could abuse my
hospitality any longer. He was taking a room to work in <i>The
Caf&eacute; &agrave; la Colonne de Bronze!</i></p>

<p>"He is mad!" I thought. "Something has affected the poor man's
brain! He has been working too hard. It is this book 'The Evolution
of Philosophy!' Philosophy! Bah! What a grim travesty! The Wise Man
of St. Cyr-en-Bois!...a fool! An utter fool!"</p>

<p>I could not leave him like this. I could not let the matter
drift. I called on Madame Curvellier. She still did not apparently
suspect anything. She was quite calm and placid. She invited me to
dinner the following night and I accepted. Everything appeared to
be quite normal. Monsieur Curvellier was a little late, but he was
quite friendly to me. He apologized for his lateness and joked, and
talked as brilliantly as usual.</p>

<p>It was a complete revelation to me. I could hardly speak, but I
watched and listened. I saw my friends in a new light. The highbrow
of Monsieur Curvellier, the intellectual cast of countenance, the
brilliant eyes, the superb manner. I could find nothing lacking,
not even weakness, and yet&mdash;he had not appeared quite like
that the day before. When I again asked myself, "Where was the
strength of character which had raised him to where he was?" my eye
involuntarily turned in the direction of the calm woman facing me.
She was not perhaps a brilliantly, clever woman, but she possessed
something which Monsieur Curvellier lacked. She knew it, and he
didn't know it.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you how I suffered during the ensuing month. I
felt that I was losing my friend, that any minute a terrible
catastrophe might envelop us all, that all joy in life was oozing
away. I could not work or think coherently. I knew that the
wretched business was still going on, and I could do nothing to
stop it. The affair reached its climax on the last day of
September.</p>

<p>On the twenty-third of the month Pauline suddenly left St.
Cir-en-Bois, and my spirits arose accordingly. I was very much on
the watch, however, for signs and portents. I could not discover
where she had gone. I called at the Bonzards and Madame Bonzard
said that her daughter had gone to stay with some cousins, she
believed. She was not very interested or communicative.
Nevertheless I persisted in my campaign of watchfulness. Every
evening I called at the Bonzards and took a glass of groseille or
vermouth, and I continued my importunate advances to Monsieur
Curvellicr.</p>

<p>One evening I was alone in the caf&eacute;. Monsieur Bonzard was
out in the yard at the back chopping wood; Madame Bonzard was not
to be seen. The postman came and dumped a few letters down on the
bar, and singing out "Post!" he went away. A sudden uncontrollable
temptation came over me. I tiptoed to the bar and glanced at the
letters. One was addressed to Monsieur Curvellier and was in
Pauline's handwriting. Almost without thinking, I slipped the
letter into my pocket. I remained on a decent length of time, and
then hurried home.</p>

<p>My next operation was not a difficult one. I went into the
deserted laboratory and boiled a kettle of water. I opened the
letter quite easily. It was brief and fateful. It was written from
an address at Dinan, and ran as follows:</p>

<p>"Everything is arranged. I shall expect you here on the
thirtieth, but will write again. Till then, all my love, your own
P."</p>

<p>I could hardly get my breath when I read this. On thinking it
over, I decided that there was no point in my destroying the
letter. If he did not answer she would be sure to write again. I
could not intercept all their correspondence, but I meant to have
one more desperate interview with Monsieur Curvellier. I resealed
the letter, and put it back in the post. On the evening of the
twenty-eighth I again dined with the Curvelliers. There was still
no sign of the impending disruption. Madame Curvellier informed me
that her husband was going to Paris on the thirtieth on business,
and would be away three weeks.</p>

<p>I thought to myself:</p>

<p>"Oh, is he! Poor dear lady, if you only knew!"</p>

<p>On the evening of the twenty-ninth I had one of the most trying
experiences of my life. I tracked Monsieur Curvellier to the room
at the Colonne de Bronze, where he kept his manuscripts and a few
other odds and ends. I went straight in and seized him by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Pierre," I said, "I know your plans. To-morrow you mean to run
away to that girl."</p>

<p>For a moment he appeared startled, then suddenly his face
changed. It bore an expression I had never seen on it before. It
was weak, and desperate, and angry.</p>

<p>"What the devil business is it of yours?" he cried.</p>

<p>"My dear old friend," I said, "I am not thinking of myself, I
assure you. I am thinking of you and of Madame, your wife, and of
your son and daughter, and your good name."</p>

<p>He threw up his arms and snapped:</p>

<p>"Oh, you!...you can't understand. Leave me, for Heaven's
sake."</p>

<p>"Pierre," I answered, as calmly as I could, "I have known you
now for fifteen years. I had hoped to continue our friendship till
the end of our days. But even that I would sacrifice for the sake
of your wife. Permit me to picture to you&mdash;she is now a
middle-aged woman. She has been loyal and true to you. She loves
you as no woman has ever loved a man before. She will be getting
old. Think! think of the years approaching. She will sit there
alone, her hair turning white, her children scattered, her heart
broken. She will have nothing...nothing but memories, desolation,
despair. And all this for a mad infatuation for a worthless
chit."</p>

<p>"I will not allow you to speak of Mademoiselle Bonzard in that
way. Get out of the room!"</p>

<p>"But I will speak and you know that I speak the truth. You, who
are spoken of as the Wise Man of St. Cyr, with this mighty work on
philosophy to come from your hands. How will France be able to
reconcile the work with the man?"</p>

<p>I do not know whether I could have adopted a more reasonable
attitude, but in any case I could hardly have adopted one that had
more disastrous results. A sudden fury seemed to seize my friend.
He dashed across the room and picked up a whole armful of the
manuscript, and rushing to the stove he tried to squeeze the lot
in.</p>

<p>"Philosophy!" he cried. "Don't talk to me of philosophy. There's
no such thing. We are all fools."</p>

<p>I screamed when I saw what he was doing and dashed forward and
gripped his arm. But it was too late, for a great part of the work.
We struggled by the stove. I managed to save a fair portion from
being completely burnt, the burning leaves were fluttering about
the room, and I was seizing what I could and stamping out the fire.
Monsieur Curvellier uttered a low hysterical laugh and left me to
do the best I could. The second volume was completely destroyed and
half the third. The Wise Man of St. Cyr was on his way to the
little flame in Dinan.</p>

<p>On the evening of the thirtieth I was in a perfect fever. I
could not keep still. My mind was constantly occupied with the
vision of that poor woman sitting by her lonely fireside,
innocently dreaming of that perfect man who had betrayed her. At
half-past eight I waked into the town and visited her.</p>

<p>She was sitting alone in her little salon.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Monsieur Barzac," she said. "It is kind of you to
pay me a little visit."</p>

<p>Her voice was steady, but her face looked strained and wistful.
We exchanged little banalities, and kept watching each other. After
a time I gradually experienced one of those curious telepathic
communications to which we are all subject at times, especially
when under great stress. I knew that she knew. And she knew that I
knew. We hovered round the brink of the dismal subject, and
then&mdash;I must have been very unstrung by my experiences of the
last few days&mdash;I gave an involuntary sob, and buried my face
in my hands.</p>

<p>She behaved with charming simplicity. She arose and touched me
gently on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"I know, I know," she said, for all the world as though I was
the one to be commiserated with.</p>

<p>I pressed her hand and said:</p>

<p>"What can we do? What can we do?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be done," she answered.</p>

<p>Then this remarkable woman sat down and took up some
knitting.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Barzac," she said, "you must not distress yourself. He
will come back."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"<i>He always does!</i>"</p>

<p>I stared at her as though I could not believe my senses. He
always does! What was this grim intimatun lying at the back of so
simple a phrase?</p>

<p>I dared not ask. I sat there watching her as though she were
something entirely novel, which I had never seen before. In her
gentle voice she continued:</p>

<p>"I could almost tell you to the day when he will come back!"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"When he changes his pants!"</p>

<p>"Good God!" I thought, "the shock has turned her brain!"</p>

<p>She looked at me understandingly, and a pathetic smile played
round her mouth.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Barzac," she said, "you have been so good a friend to
us, so loyal to my husband, I do not feel any compunction in
telling you a little episode in our past life. You are one of those
men, I think, that if you see a fine horse racing along the road
you do not think any the less of it because its body is splashed
with mud."</p>

<p>I nodded anxiously and waited for her to continue.</p>

<p>"We spent our honeymoon in the Ardennes. We camped out among the
trees. It was surely the happiest, most beautiful honeymoon ever
spent. It was spring and the woods were carpeted with hyacinths and
bluebells. We had very little luggage. We were right away from the
world. On the third day when Monsieur Curvellier went to change his
pants he found that one leg had been cut off just below the knee. I
never quite knew how this had come about. Whether it was a
practical joke played on him by one of his friends, or whether
someone in an emergency had cut the leg off to make a bandage, I
cannot say. As you may imagine, the reason of it did not greatly
disturb us. My husband said it was uncomfortable, but a great joke.
We have laughed over the incident all our lives. Very trivial, you
may think, but one of those little incidents which make a bond. For
all that week, the most gloriously happy week of our lives, he went
about with the leg of one pant half a metre shorter than the other.
So absurd!...oh, so absurd!"</p>

<p>The humour of it still seemed to affect Madame Curvellier. She
buried her face in her hands and laughed weakly.</p>

<p>"But pray, Madame Curvellier, how do you think his little
incident will affect your husband's return in this case?"</p>

<p>She dabbed her eyes and looked up at me.</p>

<p>"I packed his bag the other day. I knew, oh yes, I knew quite
well where he was going, believe me. I have known everything all
along. Only...when Monsieur Curvellier goes to change his pants he
will find one leg cut away just below the knee. And then, Monsieur
Barzac, he will come back."</p>

<p>I sat there stupefied. Monsieur Curvellier owed everything to
this woman. At last I haltingly remarked:</p>

<p>"Is it possible? Do I understand you to say&mdash;should I be
taking too great an advantage of the confidence you have honoured
me with, if I ask...there have been, you say...other episodes?"</p>

<p>Madame Curvelier looked at me squarely. Her proud face did not
flinch.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Barzac," she said, "experience has taught me that life
is neither all joy nor all sorrow, neither all laughter nor all
tears, neither all purity nor all vice; but a commingling of these
things. And through them we grope our way to God...My husband is a
genius."</p>

<p>Her eyes seemed to challenge me; then she shrugged her shoulders
with an air of finality. I pressed her hand; my heart was too full
for words.</p>

<p>Five days later, Monsieur Curvellier returned from "Paris," and
soon after the Bonzards left the town fir good. We resumed our
normal life. The day after he returned he called upon me at the
library. He held out both hands to me.</p>

<p>"Ah, old friend," he said. "You were going to get me that volume
of Descartes." As he went down the library steps, I watched his
firm elastic step, the poise of his saintly head, the winning smile
he turned upon the old beggar as he handed him a franc.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>"Kyrie eleison."</p>

<p>"Christe eleison."</p>

<p>"Kyrie eleison."</p>

<p>Was it all a dream? The solemn chanting, the pomp and ceremony,
the utter stillness, the catafalque piled with all the symbols of
honour and respect? The peasants moving in awed reverence amidst
the trophies and the garlands of an honoured life? My eye,
fascinated by this heaped tribute, in which bays and laurels abound
with the ribbons of the Acad&eacute;mie, the Sorbonne, and other
learned Societies, Immortelles and wreaths from every corner of
France? A bird fluttering screaming above the laurel wreaths, as
though in search of berries, then swinging in a half-circle and
disappearing, beyond the wall? Is it all a dream? The ice-cold
voice of Abb&eacute; Foulard cuts the air with its stern note of
reality:</p>

<p>"<i>Libera me, Domine, de morte aeterna, in die illa tremenda:
Quando coeli movendi sunt et terra: Dum veneris judicare sacculum
per ignem.</i>"</p>

<p>In that tremendous day! In the end we are all humble. However
great and honourable we may be, we crave for mercy. We fear this
judgment of the world by fire. I, too...have I not concealed the
vicious actions of my heart? Have I always been honourable in word
and thought to my beloved but unbalanced friend?</p>

<p>She comes forward, apart from the rest, her pale face perfectly
controlled, this woman that I have loved in secret for thirty years
or more. With an inaudible murmur, she drops upon the grave a small
bunch of pure white flowers.</p>

<p>"Kyrie eleison."</p>

<p>"Christe eleison."</p>

<p>"Kyrie eleison."</p>

<p>I turn my back and gaze across the wall, to where a village
slumbers in the autumn mist, and the steel-grey waters of the Rinse
go hurrying towards the open sea.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. The Brothers</h2>

<p>In the twilight of his mind there stirred the dim realization of
pain. He could not account for this nor for his lack of desire to
thrust the pain back. It was moreover mellowed by the alluring
embraces of an enveloping darkness, a darkness which he idly
desired to pierce, and yet which soothed him with its caliginous
touch. Some subconscious voice, too, kept repeating that it was
ridiculous, that he really had control, that the darkness was due
to the fact that it was night, and that he was in his own bed. In
the room across the passage his mother was sleeping peacefully. And
yet the pain, which he could not account for, seemed to press him
down and to rack his lower limbs. There was a soothing interval of
utter darkness and forgetfulness, and then the little waves of
febrile consciousness began to lap the shores of distant dreams,
and visions of half-forgotten episodes became clear and
pregnant.</p>

<p>He remembered standing by the French window in their own
dining-room, his mother's dining-room, rapping his knuckles gently
on the panes. Beneath the window was the circular bed of hollyhocks
just beginning to flower, and below the terrace the great avenue of
elms nodding lazily in the sun. He could hear the coffee-urn on its
brass tripod humming comfortably behind him while lie waited for
his mother to come down to breakfast. He was alone, and the
newspaper in his hand was shaking. War! He could not grasp the
significance of the mad news that lay trembling on the sheets. His
mother entered the room, and as he hurried across to kiss her he
noted the pallor of her cheeks.</p>

<p>They sat down, and she poured him out his coffee as she had done
ever since he could remember. Then, fixing her dark eyes on his and
toying restlessly with the beads upon her breast, she said:</p>

<p>"It's true, then, Robin?"</p>

<p>He nodded, and his eyes wandered to the disfiguring newspaper.
He felt as though he were in some way responsible for the intrusion
of the world calamity into the sanctity of his mother's life; he
muttered:</p>

<p>"It's a dreadful business, mother."</p>

<p>His gaze wandered again out of the window between the row of
elms. Geddes, the steward, was walking briskly, followed by two
collies. Beyond the slope was a hay-cart lumbering slowly in the
direction of the farm. "Parsons is rather late with the clover," he
thought. He felt a desire to look at things in little bits; the
large things seemed overpowering, insupportable. Above all, his
mother must not suffer. It was dreadful that any one should suffer,
but most of all his mother. He must devote himself to protecting
her against the waves of foreboding that were already evident on
her face. But what could he say? He knew what was uppermost in her
mind&mdash;Giles! He had no illusions. He knew that his mother
adored his elder brother more passionately than she did himself. It
was only natural. He too adored Giles. Everybody did. Giles was his
hero, his god. Ever since he could remember, Giles had epitomized
to him everything splendid, brave, and chivalrous. He was so
glorious to look at, so strong, so manly. The vision of that
morning merged into other visions of the sun-lit hours with
Giles&mdash;his pride when quite a little boy if Giles would play
with him; his pride when he saw Giles in flannels, going in to bat
at cricket; the terror in his heart when one day he saw Giles
thrown from a horse, and then the passionate tears of love and
thankfulness when he saw him rise and run laughing after the beast.
He remembered that when Giles went away to school his mother found
him crying, and told him he must not be sentimental. But he could
not help it. He used to visualize the daily life of Giles and write
to him long letters which his brother seldom answered. Of course he
did not expect Giles to answer; he would have no time. He was one
of the most popular boys at school and a champion at every
sport.</p>

<p>Then the vision of that morning when the newspaper brought its
disturbing news vanished with the memory of his mother standing by
his side, her arm round his waist, as they gazed together across a
field of nodding corn...</p>

<p>Troubled visions, then, of Giles returning post-haste from
Oxford, of himself in the village talking to every one he met about
"the dreadful business," speaking to the people on the farm, and to
old Joe Walters, the wheelwright, whose voice he could remember
saying:</p>

<p>"Ay, tha' woan't tak' thee, Master Robin."</p>

<p>He remembered talking to Mr. Meads at the general shop, and to
the Reverend Quirk, whose precious voice he could almost hear
declaiming:</p>

<p>"I presume your brother will apply for a commission."</p>

<p>He had wandered then up on to the downs and tried to think about
"the dreadful business" in a detached way, but it made him tremble.
He listened to the bees droning on the heather, and saw the smoke
from the hamlet over by Wodehurst trailing peacefully to the sky.
"The dreadful business" seemed incredible.</p>

<p>It was some days later that he met his friend Jerry Lawson
wandering up there, with a terrier at his heels. Lawson was a
sculptor, a queer chap, whom most people thought a fanatic. Jerry
blazed down on him:</p>

<p>"This is hell, Robin. Hell let loose. It could have been
avoided. It's a trade war. At the back of it all is business,
business, business. And millions of boys will be sacrificed for
commercial purposes. Our policy is just as much at fault
as&mdash;theirs. Look what we did at&mdash;"</p>

<p>For an hour he listened to the diatribe of Lawson, tremulously
silent. He had nothing to reply. He detested politics and the
subtleties of diplomacy. He had left school early owing to an
illness which had affected his heart. He had spent his life upon
these downs and among his books. He could not adjust the gentle
impulses of his being to the violent demands of that foreboding
hour. When Lawson had departed, he had sat there a long time. Was
Lawson right?</p>

<p>He wandered home, determining that he would read more history,
more political economy; he would get to the root of "this dreadful
business."</p>

<p>He wanted to talk to Giles, to find out what he really thought,
but the radiant god seemed unapproachable; or rode roughshod over
the metaphysical doubts of his brother, and laughed. Giles had no
misgivings. His conscience was dynamically secure. Besides, there
was "the mater."</p>

<p>"When I go, Rob, you must do all you can to buck the mater up."
He had looked so splendid when he said that, with his keen, strong
face, alert and vibrant, Robin had not had it in his heart to
answer. And then had come lonely days, reading news books and
occasionally talking with Lawson. When Giles went off to his
training he spent more time with his mother, but they did not
discuss the dreadful thing which had come into their lives. His
mother became restlessly busy, making strange garments, knitting,
attending violently to the demands of the household. Sometimes in
the evening he would read to her, and they would sit trying to hide
from each other the sound of the rain pattering on the leaves
outside. He had not dared talk to her of the misgivings in his
heart or of his arguments with Lawson...</p>

<p>And then a vision came of a certain day in October. The wind was
blowing the rain in fitful gusts from the sea. He was in a sullen,
perverse mood. Watching his mother's face that morning, a sudden
fact concerning her had come home to him. It had aged, aged during
those three months, and the gray hair on that distinguished head
had turned almost white. He felt within him a surging conflict of
opposing forces. The hour of climacteric had arrived. He must see
it once and for all clearly and unalterably. He had put on his
mackintosh then and gone out into the rain. He walked up to the
long wall by Gray's farm, where on a fine day he could see the sea;
but not to-day, it was too wet and misty; but he could be conscious
of it, and feel its breath beating on his temples.</p>

<p>He stood there, then, for several hours, under the protection of
the wall, listening to the wind and to the gulls who went shrieking
before it. He could not remember where he had wandered to after
that, except that for some time he was leaning on a rock, watching
the waves crashing over the point at Youlton Bay. And then in the
evening he had written to Lawson.</p>

<p>"I want to see this thing in its biggest, broadest sense, dear
Terry."</p>

<p>He knew he had commenced the letter in this way, for it was a
phrase he had repeated to himself at intervals.</p>

<p>"Like you, I hate war and the thought of war. But, good heaven!
need I say that? Every one must hate war, I suppose. I agree with
you that human life is sacred...But would it be sacred if it stood
still?&mdash;if it were stagnant?&mdash;if it were just a mass
affair? It is only sacred because it is an expression of spiritual
evolution. It must change, go on, lead somewhere...</p>

<p>"Don't you think that we on this island have as great a right to
fight for what we represent as any other nation? With all our
faults and poses and hypocrisies, haven't we subscribed something
to the commonwealth of humanity?&mdash;something of honor, and
justice, and equity? I don't believe you will deny all this. But
even if you did, and even if I agreed with you, I still should not
be convinced that it was not right to fight. As I walked up by the
chalk-pit near Gueldstone Head, and saw the stone-gray cottages at
Lulton nestling in the hollow of the downs, and smelt the dear salt
dampness of it all, and felt the lovely tenderness of the evening
light, I thought of Giles and what he represents, and of my mother,
and what she represents, and of all the people I know and love with
all their faults, and I made up my mind that I would fight for it
in any case, in the same way that I would fight for a woman I
loved, even if I knew she were a harlot..."</p>

<p>Lying there in his bed, these ebullient thoughts reacted on him.
Drowsiness stole over his limbs, and he felt his heart vibrating
oddly. There seemed to be a sound of drums, beating a tattoo, of a
train rumbling along an embankment. And in fancy he was on his way
to London again, with the memory of his mother's eyes as she had
said:</p>

<p>"Come back safely, Robin boy."</p>

<p>The memory of that day was terrifying indeed. He was wandering
about a vast building near Whitehall, tremulously asking questions,
wretchedly conscious that people looked at him and laughed. And
then that long queue of waiting men! Some were so dirty, so
obscene, and he felt that most of them were sniggering at him. A
sergeant spoke sharply, and he shuddered and spilt some ink on one
of the many forms he had to fill up. Every one seemed rough and
violent. After many hours of waiting he was shown into another room
and told to strip. He sat on a form with a row of other men,
feeling incredibly naked and very much ashamed. The window was open
and his teeth chattered with the cold and the nervous tension of
the desperate experience. A doctor spoke kindly to him, and an old
major at a table asked him one or two questions. He was dismissed
and waited interminably in another room. At last an orderly entered
and called his name among some others, and handed him a card. He
was rejected.</p>

<p>He returned to Wodehurst that evening shivering and in a mood of
melancholy dejection. He was an outcast among his fellows, a being
with a great instinct towards expression, but without the power to
back it up. The whole thing appeared so utterly unlieroic, almost
sordid. He wondered about Giles. If presenting oneself at a
recruiting office was such a terrifying ordeal, what must the
actual life of a soldier be? Of course Giles was different,
but&mdash;the monotony, the cheerlessness of barrack life! And then
the worse things beyond.</p>

<p>After that he would devour the papers and tramp feverishly on
the downs; he tried to obtain work at a munition factory, and was
refused; made himself ill sewing bandages and doing chaotic odd
jobs. And all the time he thought of Giles, Giles, Giles. What
Giles was doing, how Giles was looking, whether he was un-happy,
and whether they spoke to him brusquely, like the sergeant had to
himself in London.</p>

<p>Then came the vision of the day when Giles came and bade
farewell, on his way to France&mdash;a terrible day. He could not
bring himself to look into his mother's eyes. He felt that if he
did so he would be a trespasser peering into the forbidden
sanctuary of a holy place. He hovered around her and murmured
little banalities about Giles's kit, the train he was to catch, the
parcel he was to remember to pick up in London. When it came to
parting time, he left those two alone and fled out to the trap that
was to take his brother to the station. He had waited there till
Giles came, running and laughing and waving his hand. He drove with
him to the station, and dared not look back to see his mother
standing by the window. They were silent till the trap had passed a
mile beyond the village; then Giles had laughed, and talked, and
rallied him on his gloomy face.</p>

<p>"I'll soon be back, old man. Buck the mater up, won't you? Whoa,
Tommy, what are you shying at?...By jove! won't it be grand on the
sea to-night!"</p>

<p>Oh, Giles! Giles! was there ever any one so splendid, so
radiant, so uncrushable? His heart went out to his brother at that
moment, and he could not answer.</p>

<p>So closely were his own sympathies interwoven with the feelings
of his brother that he hardly noticed the moment of actual
separation on the platform. His heart was with Giles all the way up
to London, then in the train again, and upon the sea with him that
night.</p>

<p>In his imagination, quickened by a close study of all the
literature he could get hold of on the actual conditions out there,
he followed his brother through every phase of his new life. He was
with him at the base, in rest camps, and in dug-outs, and more
especially was he with him in those zig-zagging trenches smelling
of dampness and decay. On dark nights he would hear the scuttle of
rats dashing through the wet holes. He would hear the shriek of
shells, and the tearing and ripping of the earth. He would start up
and try to make his way through the slime of a battered trench
which always seemed to be crumbling, crumbling. In his nostrils
would hang the penetrating smell of gases that had the quality of
imparting terror. So vivid were his impressions of these things
that he could not detach his own suffering from that of his
brother. There were times when he became convinced that either he
or Giles was a chimera. One of them did not exist...He seemed to
stand for an eternity peering through a slit in a mud wall and
gazing at another mud wall, and feeling the penetrating ooze of
dying vegetation creeping into his body. Above his head would loom
dark poles and barbarous entanglements. It was as though everything
had vanished from the world but symbols of fear and cruelty, which
rioted insanely against the heavens, as though everything that man
had ever learnt had been forgotten and destroyed; and he growled
there in the wet earth, flaunting the feral passions of his remote
ancestry. And the cold!&mdash;the cold was terrible...He remembered
a strange thing happening at that time. During some vague respite
from the recurring horror of these imaginings, he had, he believed,
been walking out through the meadows, when a numbness seemed to
creep over his lower limbs. He could not get back. He had lain
helpless in a field when George Carter, one of the farm hands, had
found him and helped him home. He had been very ill then, and his
mother had sent for Doctor Ewing. He could not remember exactly
what the doctor said or what treatment he prescribed, or how long
he had lain there in a semi-conscious state, but he vividly
remembered hearing the doctor say one day: "It's very curious,
madam. I was, as you know, out at the Front for some time with the
Red Cross, and this boy has a fever quite peculiar to the men at
the Front. Has he been out standing in the wet mud?" He could not
remember what his mother answered. He wanted to say: "Ho, no, it's
not I. It's Giles," but he had not the strength, and afterwards
wondered whether it were an illusion.</p>

<p>He knew that many weeks went by, and still they would not let
him walk. That was his greatest trouble, for walking helped him.
When he could walk, he could sometimes live in a happier world of
make-believe, but in bed the epic tragedy unfolded itself in every
livid detail, intensely real.</p>

<p>Long periods of time went by, and still he was not allowed to
leave his room. His mother would come and sit with him and read him
Giles's letters. They were wonderful letters, full of amusing
stories of "rags" and tales of splendid feeds obtained under
difficult circumstances. Of the conditions that existed so vividly
in Robin's mind there was not one word. To read Giles's letters one
would imagine that he was away on a holiday with a party of young
undergraduates, having the time of their lives. But the letters had
no reality to him. <i>He knew. He had seen it all</i>.</p>

<p>Time became an unrecognizable factor. Eaces came and went. His
mother was always there, and there appeared another kind face whom
he believed to be a nurse; and sometimes Jerry Lawson would come
and sit by the bed, and talk to him about the beauties of the
quattrocento and other things he had forgotten, things which
belonged to a dead world...</p>

<p>Lying there in bed, he could not detach these impressions very
clearly, nor determine how long ago they had taken place. There
appeared to be an unaccountable shifting of the folds of darkness,
a slipping away of vital purposes, and a necessity for focusing
upon some immediate development. This necessity seemed, somehow,
emphasized by the overpowering pain that had begun to rack his
limbs, more especially his right foot. He wanted to call out, but
some voice told him that it would be useless. The night was too
impenetrable and heavy, his voice would only die away against its
inky pall. There was besides a certain soothing tenderness about
it, as though it were caressing him and telling him that he must
wait in patience, and all would be well. He knew now that he was
sleeping in the open, and that would account for the chilling
coldness. At the same time it was not exactly the open. There were
walls about and jagged profiles, but apparently no roof or
distances. The ground was hard like concrete. He must be infinitely
patient and pray for the dawn...He began to feel the dawn before he
saw it. It came like the caressing sigh of a woman as she wakes and
thinks of her lover in some foreign clime. Somewhere at hand a bird
was twittering, aware too of the coming miracle. Almost
imperceptibly things began to form themselves. He was certainly
behind a wall, but there was a door, with the upper part leaning
in. A phrase occurred to his mind: "The white arm of dawn is
creeping over the door." A lovely passage! He had read it in some
Irish book. The angle at the top of the door was like a bent elbow.
It was very, very like the white am&mdash;of some Irish queen,
perhaps, or of the Mother of men&mdash;a white arm creeping over
the door, and in its whiteness delicately touching the eyelids of
the sleeping inmates, whilst a voice in a soft cadence whispered:
"Awake! pull back the door, and let me show you the silver
splendors of the unborn day."</p>

<p>A heavy dew was falling, and the cold seemed bitter, whilst all
around he became aware of the slow unfolding of desolation; except
for the leaning door, nothing seemed to take a recognizable shape,
everything was jagged and violent in its form and exuded the
cloying odors of death. Somewhere faintly he thought he heard the
sound of a cornet, bizarre and fantastic, and having no connection
with the utter stillness of this place of sorrow.</p>

<p>His eye searched the broken darkness in fugitive pursuit of a
solution of the formless void. Quite near him, apparently, was an
oblong board which amidst this wilderness of destruction seemed to
have escaped untouched. As the dim violet light began to reveal
certain definite concrete things, he became aware that on the board
were some Roman letters. He looked at them for some time
unseeingly. The word written there stamped itself without meaning
on his brain. The word was: "FILLES." He repeated it to himself
over and over again. The earth seemed to rock again with a sullen,
vibrating passion, as though irritated that the work of destruction
was not entirely complete. Things already destroyed seemed to be
subjected to further transmutation of formlessness. But still the
board remained intact, and he fixed his eyes on it. It imbued him
with a strange sense of tranquillity. <i>Ftiles!</i> A little word,
but it became to him a link to cosmic things. The desire to reason
passed, as the ability to suffer passed. Across the mists of time
he seemed to hear the laughter of children. He could almost see
them pass. There were Jeannette and Marie, with long black pigtails
and check frocks, and just behind them, struggling with a heavy
satchel, little fair-haired Ba-bette. How they laughed, those
children! and yet he could not determine whether their laughter
came from the years that had passed or from the years that were to
come. But wherever the laughter came from, it seemed the only thing
the powers of darkness could not destroy. He lay then for a long
time, conscious of a peace greater than any he could have
conceived. And the white arm of dawn crept over the door.</p>

<hr>

<p>The crowd who habitually came down by the afternoon train
trickled out of the station and vanished. The master of Wodehurst
came limping through the doorway. His face was bronzed and perhaps
a little thinner, but his eyes laughed, and his voice rang out to
the steward waiting in the dog-cart:</p>

<p>"Hullo! Sam, how are you?"</p>

<p>He was leaning on two sticks, and a porter followed with his
trunks.</p>

<p>"Can I help you up, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, it's all right, old man; I can manage."</p>

<p>He pulled himself up and laughed because he hit his knee upon
the mudguard.</p>

<p>"It's good to be home, Sam."</p>

<p>"Yes; I expect your mother will be glad, sir," answered Geddes,
touching up the horse. "And so will we all, I'm thinking."</p>

<p>They clattered down the road, and the high spirits of the
wounded warrior rose. He asked a thousand questions, and insisted
on taking the reins before they had gone far. It was dusk when they
began to draw near Wodehurst; a sudden silence had fallen on Giles.
The steward realized the reason. He coughed uncomfortably. They
were passing within a hundred yards of Wodehurst Church. Suddenly
he said in his deep burr:</p>

<p>"We were all very sorry, sir, about Master Robin."</p>

<p>The eyes of the soldier softened; he murmured:</p>

<p>"Poor old chap!"</p>

<p>"I feel I ought to tell you, sir. It was a very queer thing. But
one day that young Mr. Lawson&mdash;you know, the
sculptor&mdash;about a week after it all happened, he must have got
up at daybreak, I should say&mdash;nobody saw him do it. He must
have gone down there to the churchyard with his tools, and what do
you think? He carved something on the stone&mdash;on Mr. Robin's
stone."</p>

<p>Giles said quickly: "Carved! What?"</p>

<p>"He carved just under the name and date, 'He died for
England.'"</p>

<p>"'He died for England!' He carved that on Robin's grave? What
did he mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"Really! What a rum chap he must be!"</p>

<p>"We didn't know what to do about it, sir. I saw it, and I didn't
like to tell your mother, and nobody likes to interfere with a
tombstone, it seems profanelike. So there it is to this day."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sam. I'll think about it."</p>

<p>"Have you had much pain with your foot, sir?"</p>

<p>Giles laughed, and flicked the horse.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing to write home about, Sam. I had a touch of fever,
you know. I didn't tell the mater, It was later on that I got this
smash of my right foot. It happened at&mdash;I've forgotten the
name; some damned little village on the Flemish border. I was lucky
in a way, the shrapnel missed me. It was falling stonework that
billed up my foot. There was a building, a sort of school, I should
think. It got blown to smithereens. It was rather a nasty mess-up.
I was there for seven hours before they found me&mdash;Hullo! I see
the mater standing at the gate."</p>

<p>The horse nearly bolted with the violence of Giles's waving
arms...</p>

<p>The dinner&mdash;all the dishes that Giles specially
loved&mdash;was finished. With his arm round his mother's waist and
a cigar in the corner of his mouth, he led her into the warm
comfort of the white-paneled drawing-room.</p>

<p>"You won't mind my smoking in here to-night, mater?"</p>

<p>"My dear boy!"</p>

<p>They sat in silence, watching the red glow of the log fire.
Suddenly Giles said:</p>

<p>"I say, mater, do you know an awfully rum thing Geddes told
me?"</p>

<p>His mother looked up.</p>

<p>"I think perhaps I know. Do you mean in the cemetery?"</p>

<p>Giles nodded, puffing at his cigar in little nervous
inhalations.</p>

<p>"Yes. I knew. I saw it, of course. I've sat and wondered."</p>

<p>"Such a rum thing to do! What do you think we ought to do about
it, mater?"</p>

<p>He saw his mother lean forward; the waves of silver hair seemed
to enshrine the beautiful lines of her drawn face; her voice came
whispering:</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better leave it, Giles?...Perhaps he really did die
for England?"</p>

<p>The young man glanced at her quickly. He saw her aged and broken
by the war. He thought of his brother...Then he caught sight of his
own face in the mirror, lean, youthful, vigorous. The old tag
flashed through his mind:</p>

<p class="poem">"They also serve who only stand and wait."</p>

<p>He thrust away that emotional expression, and in the manner of
his kind stayed silent, rigid, with his back to the fire. And
suddenly he said:</p>

<p>"I say, mater, won't you play me something? Chopin, or one of
those Russian Johnnies you play so rippingly?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. A Good Action</h2>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that the majority of us perform the
majority of our actions through what are commonly known as mixed
motives.</p>

<p>It would certainly have been quite impossible for Mr. Edwin
Pothecary to analyze the concrete impulse which eventually prompted
him to perform his good action. It may have been a natural revolt
from the somewhat petty and cramped punctilio of his daily life;
his drab home life, the bickering, wearing, grasping routine of the
existence of fish-and-chips dispenser. A man who earns his
livelihood by buying fish and potatoes in the cheapest market, and
selling them in the Waterloo Hoad cannot afford to indulge his
altruistic fancies to any lavish extent. It is true that the
business of Mr. Edwin Pothecary was a tolerably successful
one&mdash;he employed three assistants and a boy named Scales who
was not so much an assistant as an encumbrance and wholesale
plate-smasher. Mr. Pothecary engaged him because he thought his
name seemed appropriate to the fish-trade. In a weak moment he
pandered to this sentimental whim, another ingredient in the
strange composition which influences us to do this, that, and the
other. But it was not by pandering to whims of this nature that Mr.
Pothecary had built up this progressive and odoriferous business
with its gay shopfront of blue and brown tiles. It was merely a
minor lapse. In tbe fish-and-cbip trade one has to be keen,
pushful, self-reliant, ambidexterous, a student of human nature,
forbearing, far-seeing, imaginative, courageous, something of a
controversialist with a streak of fatalism as pronounced as that of
a high-priest in a Brahmin temple. It is better, moreover, to have
an imperfect nasal organism, and to be religious.</p>

<p>Edwin had all these qualities. Every day he went from Quince
Villa at Buffington to London&mdash;forty minutes in the
train&mdash;and back at night. On Sunday he took the wife and three
children to the Methodist Chapel at the corner of the street to
both morning and evening services. But even this religious
observance does not give us a complete solution for the sudden
prompting of an idea to do a good action. Edwin had attended chapel
for fifty-two years and such an impulse had never occurred to him
before. He may possibly have been influenced by some remark of the
preacher, or was it that twinge of gout which set him thinking of
the unwritten future? Had it anything to do with the Boy-Scout
movement? Some one at some time had told him of an underlying
idea&mdash;that every day in one's life one should do one pure,
good and unselfish action.</p>

<p>Perhaps after all it was all due to the gayety of a spring
morning. Certain it is that as he swung out of the garden gate on
that morning in April something stirred in him. His round puffy
face blinked heavenwards. Almond blossoms fluttered in the breeze
above the hedgerows. Larks were singing...Suddenly his eye alighted
upon the roof of the Peels' hen-house opposite and Mr. Edwin
Pothecary scowled. Lord! How he hated those people! The Peels were
Pothe-cary's <i>b&#65533;?ªtes-noires</i>. Snobs! Pirates!
Rotters!</p>

<p>The Peels' villa was at least three times as big as the
Pothecarys'. It was, in fact, not a villa at all. It was a
"Court"&mdash;whatever that was. It was quite detached, with about
fourteen rooms in all, a coachhouse, a large garden, and two black
sheds containing forty-five fowls, leading an intensive existence.
The Pothecarys had five fowls which sometimes did and sometimes
didn't supply them with two or three eggs a day, but it was known
that the Peels sent at least two hundred and fifty eggs to market
every week, besides supplying their own table. Mr. Peel was a
successful dealer in quills and bristles. His wife was the daughter
of a post office official and they had three stuck up daughters who
would have no truck at all with the Pothecarys. You may appreciate
then the twinge of venom which marked the face of Edwin as he
passed through his front gate and observed the distant roof of the
Peels' fowl-house. And still the almond blossoms nodded at him
above the hedge. The larks sang...After all, was it fair to hate
any one because they were better off than oneself? Strange how
these moods obsess one. The soft air caressed Edwin's cheek. Little
flecks of cloud scudded gayly into the suburban panorama. Small
green shoots were appearing everywhere. One ought not to hate any
one at all&mdash;of course. It is absurd. So bad for oneself, apart
from tbe others. One ought rather to be kind, forgiving, loving all
mankind. Was that a lark or a thrush? He knew little about birds.
Dish now!...A not entirely unsatisfactory business really the fried
fish trade&mdash;when things went well. When customers were
numerous and not too cantankerous. Quite easy to run, profitable. A
boy came singing down the road. The villas clustered together more
socially. There was a movement of spring life...</p>

<p>As Edwin turned the corner of the Station Road, the impulse
crystallized. One good action. To-day he would perform one good,
kind, unselfish, unadvertised action. No one should ever know of
it. Just one today. Then perhaps one to-morrow. And so on; in time
it might become a habit. That is how one progressed. He took his
seat in the crowded third-class smoker and pretended to read his
newspaper, but his mind was too actively engaged with the problems
of his new resolution. How? When? Where? How does one do a
definitely good action? WEat is the best way to go to work? One
could, of course, just quietly slip some money into a poor-box if
one could be found. But would this be very good and
self-sacrificing? Who gets money put in a poor-box? Surely his own
family were poor enough, as far as that went. But he couldn't go
back home and give his wife a sovereign. It would be advertising
his charity, and he would look silly doing it. His business? He
might turn up and say to his assistants: "Boys, you shall all have
a day's holiday. We'll shut up, aud here's your pay for the day."
Advertising again; besides, what about the hundreds of poor workers
in the neighborhood who relied for their mid-day sustenance on
"Pothecary's Pride-of-the-Ocean Popular Plaice to Eat?" It would be
cruel, cruel and&mdash;bad for business in the future. The public
would lose confidence in that splendid gold-lettered tablet in the
window which said "Cod, brill, halibut, plaice, pilchards always on
hand. Eat them or take them away."</p>

<p>The latter sentence did not imply that if you took them away you
did <i>not</i> eat them; it simply meant that you could either
stand at the counter and eat them from a plate with the aid of a
fork and your fingers (or at one of the wooden benches if you could
find room&mdash;an unlikely contingency, alternatively you could
wrap them up in a piece of newspaper and devour them without a fork
at the corner of the street.</p>

<p>No, it would not be a good action in any way to close the
Popular Plaice to eat. Edwin came to the conclusion that to perform
this act satisfactorily it were better to divorce the proceeding
entirely from any connection with home or business. The two things
didn't harmonize. A good action must be a special and separate
effort in an entirely different setting. He would take the day off
himself and do it thoroughly.</p>

<p>Mr. Pothecary was known in the neighborhood of the Waterloo Eoad
as "The Stinker," a title easily earned by the peculiar qualities
of his business and the obvious additional fact that a Pothecary
was a chemist. He was a very small man, bald-headed with
yellowy-white side whiskers, a blue chin, a perambulating nostril
with a large wart on the port side. He wore a square bowler hat
which seemed to thrust out the protruding flaps of his large ears.
His greeny-black clothes were always too large for him and ended in
a kind of thick spiral above his square-toed boots. He always wore
a flat white collar&mdash;more or less clean&mdash;and no tie. This
minor defect was easily atoned for by a heavy silver chain on his
waistcoat from which hung gold seals and ribbons connecting with
watches, knives, and all kinds of ingenious appliances in his
waistcoat pockets.</p>

<p>The noble intention of his day was a little chilled on his
arrival at the shop. In the first place, although customers were
then arriving for breakfast, the boy Scales was slopping water over
the front step. Having severely castigated the miscreant youth and
prophesied that his chances of happiness in the life to come were
about as remote as those of a dead dog-fish in the upper reaches of
the Thames, he made his way through the customers to the room at
the back, and there he met Dolling.</p>

<p>Dolling was Edwin's manager, and he cannot be overlooked. In the
first place, he was remarkably like a fish himself. He had the same
dull expressionless eyes and the drooping mouth and drooping
mustache. Everything about him drooped and dripped. He was always
wet. He wore a gray flannel shirt and no collar or tie. His braces,
trousers, and hair all seemed the same color. He hovered in the
background with a knife, and did the cutting up and dressing. He
had, moreover, all the taciturnity of a fish, and its peculiar
ability for getting out of a difficulty. He never spoke. He simply
looked lugubrious, and pointed at things with his knife. And yet
Edwin knew that he was an excellent manager. For it must be
observed that in spite of the gold-lettered board outside with its
fanfare of cod, brill, halibut, plaice and pilchards, whatever the
customer asked for, by the time it had passed through Dolling's
hand it was just <i>fish</i>. No nonsense about it at all. Just
plain fish leveled with a uniform brown crust. If you asked for cod
you got <i>fish</i>. If you asked for halibut you also got
<i>fish</i>. Dolling was something of an artist.</p>

<p>On this particular morning, as Edward entered the back room,
Dolling was scratching the side of his head with the knife he used
to cut up the fish; a. sure sign tha t he was perplexed about
something. It was not customary to exchange greetings in this
business, and when he observed "the guv'nor" enter he just withdrew
the knife from his hair and pointed it at a packing case on the
side table. Edwin knew what this meant. He went up and pressed his
flat nose against the chest of what looked like an over-worked
amphibian that had been turned down by its own Trades Union. Edwin
sneezed before he had had time to withdraw his nose.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's a dud lot," he said. And then suddenly an
inspirational moment nearly overwhelmed him. Here was a chance. He
would turn to Dolling and say:</p>

<p>"Dolling, this fish is slightly tainted. We must throw it away.
We bought it at our risk. Yesterday morning when it arrived it was
just all right, hut keeping it in that hot room downstairs where
you and your wife sleep has probably finished it. We mustn't give
it to our customers. It might poison them&mdash;ptomaine poison,
you know...eh, Dolling?" It would be a good action, a
self-sacrificing action, eh? But when he glanced at the face of
Dolling he knew that such an explosion would be unthinkable. It
would be like telling a duck it mustn't swim, or an artist that he
mustn't paint, or a boy on a beach that he mustn't throw stones in
the sea. It was the kind of job that Dolling enjoyed. In the course
of a few hours he knew quite well that whatever he said, the
mysterious and evil-smelling monster would be served out in dainty
parcels of halibut, cod, brill, plaice, etc.</p>

<p>Business was no place for a good action. Too many others
depended on it, were involved in it. Edwin went up to Dolling and
shouted in his ear&mdash;he was rather deaf:</p>

<p>"I'm going out. I may not be back to-day."</p>

<p>Dolling stared at the wall. He appeared about as interested in
the statement as a cod might be that had just been informed that a
Chinese coolie had won the Calcutta sweep-stake. Edwin crept out of
the shop abashed. He felt horribly uncomfortable. He heard some one
mutter: " Where's The Stinker off to?" and he realized how
impossible it would be to explain to any one there present that he
was off to do a good action.</p>

<p>"I will go to some outlying suburb," he thought. Once outside in
the sunshine he tried to get back into the benign mood. He traveled
right across London and made for Golders Green and Hendon, a part
of the world foreign to him. By the time he had boarded the Golders
Green 'bus he had quite recovered himself. It was still a brilliant
day. "The better the day the better the deed," he thought aptly. He
hummed inaudibly; that is to say, he made curious crooning noises
somewhere behind his silver chain and signets; the sound was
happily suppressed by the noise of the 'bus.</p>

<p>It seemed a very long journey. It was just as they were going
through a rather squalid district near Cricklewood that the golden
chance occurred to him. The fares had somewhat thinned. There were
scarcely a dozen people in the 'bus. Next to him barely a yard away
he observed a poor woman with a baby in her arms. She had a thin,
angular, wasted face, and her clothes were threadbare but neat. A
poor, thoroughly honest and deserving creature, making a bitter
fight of it against the buffets of a cruel world. Edwin's heart was
touched. Here was his chance. He noticed that from her wrist was
suspended a shabby black bag, and the bag was open. He would slip
up near her and drop in a half-crown. What joy and rapture when she
arrived home and found the unexpected treasure! An unknown
benefactor! Edwin chuckled and wormed his way surreptitiously along
the seat. Stealthily he fingered his half-crown and hugged it in
the palm of his left hand. His heart beat with the excitement of
his exploit. He looked out of the window opposite and fumbled bis
band towards tbe opening in tbe bag. He touched it. Suddenly a
sharp voice rang out:</p>

<p>"That man's picking your pocket!"</p>

<p>An excited individual opposite was pointing at him. Tbe woman
uttered an exclamation and snatched at her bag. Tbe baby cried. Tbe
conductor rang the bell. Every one seemed to be closing in on
Edwin. Instinctively be snatched bis hand away and thrust it in bis
pocket (tbe most foolish thing be could have done). Every one was
talking. A calm muscular-looking gentleman who bad not spoken
seized Edwin by tbe wrist and said calmly:</p>

<p>"Look in your bag, Madam, and see whether be has taken
anything."</p>

<p>Tbe 'bus came to a halt. Edwin muttered:</p>

<p>"I assure you&mdash;nothing of tbe sort&mdash;"</p>

<p>How could be possibly explain that be was doing just tbe
opposite? Would a single person believe a word of his yarn about
the half-crown? The woman whimpered:</p>

<p>"No, 'e ain't taken nothin', bad luck to 'im. There was only
four pennies and a 'alfpenny anyway. Dirty thief!"</p>

<p>"Are you goin' to give 'im in charge?" asked the conductor.</p>

<p>"Yer can't if 'e ain't actually taken nothin', can yer? The
dirty thievin' swine tryin' to rob a 'ard workin' 'onest
woman!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't! I wasn't!" feebly spluttered Edwin, blushing a ripe
beetroot color.</p>

<p>"Shame! Shame! Chuck 'im off the 'bus! Dirty sneak! Call a
copper!" were some of the remarks being hurled about.</p>

<p>The conductor was losing time and patience. He beckoned
vigorously to Edwin and said:</p>

<p>"Come on, off you go!"</p>

<p>There was no appeal. He got up and slunk out. Popular opinion
was too strong against him. As he stepped off the back hoard, the
conductor gave him a parting kick which sent him flying on to the
pavement. It was an operation received with shrieks of laughter and
a round of applause from the occupants of the vehicle, taken up by
a small band of other people who had been attracted by the
disturbance. He darted down a back street to the accompaniment of
boos and jeers.</p>

<p>It says something for Edwin Pothecary that this unfortunate
rebuff to his first attempt to do a good action did not send him
helter-skelter back to the fried fish shop in the Waterloo Road. He
felt crumpled, bruised, mortified, disappointed, discouraged; but
is not the path of all martyrs and reformers strewn with similar
d&eacute;bris? Are not all really disinterested actions liable to
misconstruction? He went into a dairy and partook of a glass of
milk and a bun. Then he started out again. He would see more rural,
less sophisticated people. In the country there must be simple,
kindly people, needing his help. He walked for several hours with
but a vague sense of direction. At last he came to a public
park.</p>

<p>A group of dirty boys were seated on the grass. They were
apparently having a banquet. They did not seem to require him. He
passed on, and came to an enclosure. Suddenly between some
rhododendron bushes he looked into a small dell. On a seat by
himself was an elderly man in a shabby suit. He looked the picture
of misery and distress. His hands were resting on his knees, and
his eyes were fixed in a melancholy scrutiny on the ground. It was
obvious that some great trouble obsessed him. He was as still as a
shadow. It was the figure of a man lost in the past
or&mdash;contemplating suicide? Edwin's breath came quickly. He
made his way to him. In order to do this it was necessary to climb
a railing. There was probably another way round, but was there
time? At any minute there might be a sudden movement, the crack of
a revolver. Edwin tore his trousers and scratched his forearm, but
he managed to enter the dell unobserved. He approached the seat.
The man never looked up. Then Edwin said with sympathetic tears in
his voice:</p>

<p>"My poor fellow, may I be of any assistance&mdash;?"</p>

<p>There was a disconcerting jar. The melancholy individual started
and turned on him angrily:</p>

<p>"Blast you! I'd nearly got it! What the devil are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>And without waiting for an answer he darted away among the
trees. At the same time a voice called over the park railings:</p>

<p>"Ho! you, there, what are you doing over there? You come back
the way you came. I saw yer."</p>

<p>The burly figure of a park-keeper with gaiters and stout stick
beckoned him. Edwin got up and clambered back again, scratching his
arm.</p>

<p>"Now then," said the keeper. "Name, address, age, and
occupation, if <i>you</i> please."</p>

<p>a I was only&mdash;" began Edwin. But what <i>was</i> he only
doing? Could he explain to a park-keeper that he was only about to
do a kind action to a poor man? He spluttered and gave his name,
address, age, and occupation.</p>

<p>"Oh," exclaimed the keeper. "Fried fish, eh? And what were you
trying to do? Get orders? Or were you begging from his
lordship?"</p>

<p>"His lordship?"</p>

<p>"That man you was speaking to was Lord Budleigh-Salterton, the
great scientist. He's thinkin' out 'is great invention, otherwise
I'd go and ask 'im if 'e wanted to prosecute yer for being in 'is
park on felonious intent or what."</p>

<p>"I assure you&mdash;" stammered Mr. Pothecary.</p>

<p>The park-keeper saw him well off the premises, and gave him much
gratuitous advice about his future behavior, darkened with
melancholy prophecies regarding the would-be felon's strength of
character to live up to it.</p>

<p>Leaving the park he struck out towards the more rural
neighborhood. He calculated that he must be somewhere in the
neighborhood of Hendon. At the end of a lane he met a sallow-faced
young man walking rapidly. His eyes were bloodshot and restless. He
glanced at Edwin and stopped.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," he said.</p>

<p>Edwin drew himself to attention. The young man looked up and
down nervously. He was obviously in a great state of distress.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;h-hardly like to ask you, sir, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stammered shockingly. Edwin turned on his most sympathetic
manner.</p>

<p>"You are suffering. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Sh-Sh-Shell-shock, shir."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>At last! Some heroic reflex of the war darted through Edwin's
mind. Here was his real chance at last. A poor fellow broken by the
war and in need, neglected by an ungrateful country. Almost hidden
by his outer coat he observed one of those little strips of colored
ribbon, which implied more than one campaign.</p>

<p>"Where did you meet your trouble?" he asked.</p>

<p>"P&mdash;P&mdash;P-Palestine, sir, capturing a T-T-Turkish
redoubt. I was through Gallipoli, too, sir, but I won't
d-d-distress you. I am in a&mdash;in a&mdash;hospital at St.
Albans, came to see my g-g-g-girl, but she's
g-g-g-gone&mdash;v-v-vanished..."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!"</p>

<p>"T-t-trouble is I l-l-l-lost my p-pass back. N-not quite enough
m-mon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear me! How much short are you?"</p>

<p>"S-S-S-Six shill&mdash;S-S-S-Six&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Six shillings? Well, I' m very sorry. Look here, my good
fellow, here's seven-and-sixpence and God bless you!"</p>

<p>"T-T-thank you very much, sir. W-will you give me your n-name
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, no, that's quite all right. I'm very pleased to be of
assistance. Please forget all about it."</p>

<p>He pressed the soldier's hand and hurried on. It was done. He
had performed a kind, unselfish action and no one should ever hear
of it. Mr. Pothecary's eyes glowed with satisfaction. Poor fellow!
even if the story were slightly exaggerated, what did it matter? He
was obviously a discharged soldier, ill, and in need. The
seven-and-sixpence would make an enormous difference. He would
always cherish the memory of his kind, unknown benefactor. It was a
glorious sensation! Why had he never thought of doing a kindly act?
It was inspiring, illuminating, almost intoxicating! He recalled
with zest the delirious feeling which ran through him when he said,
"No, no, no!" He would <i>not</i> give his name. He was the good
Samaritan, a ship passing in the night. And now he would be able to
go home, or go back to his business. He swung down the lane,
singing to himself. As he turned the corner he came to a low
bungalow-building. It was in a rather deserted spot. It had a board
outside which announced "Tea, cocoa, light refreshments. Cyclists
catered for."</p>

<p>It was past mid-day, and although tea and cocoa had never made
any great appeal to the gastronomic fancies of Edwin Pothecary, he
felt in his present spiritually elevated mood that here was a
suitable spot for a well-merited rest and lunch.</p>

<p>He entered a deserted room, filled with light oak chairs, and
tables with green-tiled tops on which were placed tin vases
containing dried ferns. A few bluebottles darted away from the
tortuous remains of what had once apparently been a ham, lurking
behind tall bottles of sweets on the counter. The room smelt of
soda and pickles. Edwin rapped on the table for some time, but no
one came. At last a woman entered from the front door leading to
the garden. She was fat and out of breath.</p>

<p>Edwin coughed and said:</p>

<p>"Good-mornin', madam. May I have a bite of somethin'?"</p>

<p>The woman looked at him and continued panting. When her
pulmonary contortions had somewhat subsided she said:</p>

<p>"I s'pose you 'aven't seen a pale young man up the lane?"</p>

<p>It was difficult to know what made him do it, but Edwin lied. He
said:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she replied. "I don't know where 'e's got to. 'E's not
s'posed to go out of the garden. 'E's been ill, you know."</p>

<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>"'E's my nefyer, hut I can't always keep an eye on 'im. 'E's a
bright one, 'e is. I shall 'ave 'im sent back to the 'ome."</p>

<p>"Ah, poor fellow! I suppose he was&mdash;injured in the
war?"</p>

<p>"War!" The plump lady snorted. She became almost aggressive and
confidential. She came close up to Edwin and shook her finger
backwards and forwards in front of his eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll tell yer 'ow much war 'e done. When they talked about
conscription, 'e got that frightened, 'e went out every day and
tried to drink himself from a A1 man into a CIII man, and by God!
'e succeeded."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!"</p>

<p>"I do say so. And more. When 'is turn came, 'e was in the
'orspital with Delirious Trimmings."</p>

<p>"My God!"</p>

<p>"'E's only just come out. 'E's all right as long as 'e don't get
'old of a little money."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"If 'e can get 'old of the price of a few whiskies, 'e'll 'ave
another attack come on! What are yer goin' ter 'ave&mdash;tea or
cocoa?"</p>

<p>"I must go! I must go!" exclaimed the only customer Mrs. Boggins
had had for two days, and gripping his umbrella he dashed out of
the shop.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! there's another one got 'em!" ejaculated the good
landlady. "I wonder whether 'e pinched anything while I was out?
'Ere! Come back, you dirty little bow-legged swipe!"</p>

<p>But Mr. Pothecary was racing down the lane, muttering to
himself: "Yes, that was a good action! A very good action
indeed!"</p>

<p>A mile further on he came to a straggling village, a forlorn
unkempt spot, only relieved by a gaudy inn called "The Two
Tumblers." Edwin staggered into the private bar and drank two pints
of Government ale and a double gin as the liquid accompaniment to a
bunk of bread and cheese.</p>

<p>It was not till he bad lighted bis pipe after the negotiation of
these delicacies that he could again focus his philosophical
outlook. Then he thought to himself: "It's a rum thing 'ow
difficult it is to do a good action. You'd think it 'd be dead
easy, but everythin' seems against yer. One must be able to do it
<i>somewhere</i>. P'raps one ought to go abroad, among foreigners
and black men. That's it! That's why all these 'ere Bible Society
people go out among black people, Chinese and so on. They find
there's nothin' doin' over 'ere."</p>

<p>Had it not been for the beer and gin it is highly probable that
Edwin would have given up the project, and have returned to fish
and chips. But lying back in a comfortable seat in "The Two
Tumblers" his thoughts mellowed. He felt broad-minded, comfortable,
tolerant...one had to make allowances. There must be all sorts of
ways. Money wasn't the only thing. Besides, he was spending too
much. He couldn't afford to go on throwing away
seven-and-six-pences. One must be able to help people&mdash;by
helping them. Doing things for them which didn't cost money. He
thought of Sir Walter Raleigh throwing down his cloak for Queen
Elizabeth to walk over. Romantic but&mdash;extravagant and silly,
really a shrewd political move, no doubt; not a good action at all.
If he met an ill-clad tramp he could take off his coat and wrap
round his shoulders and then&mdash;? Walk home to Quince Villa in
his braces? What would Mrs. Pothecary have to say? Phew! One could
save people from drowning, but he didn't know how to swim. Fire!
Perhaps there would be a fire. He could swarm up a ladder and save
a woman from the top bedroom window. Heroic, but hardly
inconspicuous; not exactly what he had meant. Besides, the firemen
would never let him; they always kept these showy stunts for
themselves. There <i>must</i> he something...</p>

<p>He walked out of "The Two Tumblers."</p>

<p>Crossing the road, he took a turning off the High Street. He saw
a heavily-built woman carrying a basket of washing. He hurried
after her, and raising his hat, said: "Excuse me, madam, may I
carry your basket for you?"</p>

<p>She turned on him suspiciously and glared:</p>

<p>"No, thanks, Mr. Bottle-nose. I've 'ad some of that before. You
'op it! Mrs. Jaggs 'ad 'ers pinched last week that way."</p>

<p>"Of course," he thought to himself as he hurried away. "The
trouble is I'm not dressed for the part. A bloomin' swell can go
about doin' good actions all day and not arouse suspicions. If I
try and 'elp a girl off a tram-car I get my face slapped."</p>

<p>Mr. Pothecary was learning. He was becoming a complete
philosopher, but it was not till late in the afternoon that he
suddenly realized that patience and industry are always rewarded.
He was appealed to by a maiden in distress.</p>

<p>It came about fn this way. He found the atmosphere of Northern
London entirely unsympathetic to good deeds. All his action
appeared suspect. lie began to feel at last like a criminal. He was
convinced that he was being watched and followed. Once he patted a
little girl's head in a paternal manner. Immediately a woman
appeared at a doorway and bawled out:</p>

<p>"'Ere, Lizzie, you come inside!"</p>

<p>At length in disgust he boarded a south-bound 'bus. He decided
to experiment nearer home. He went to the terminus and took a train
to the station just before his own. It was a small town called
Uplingham. This should be the last dance of the moral philanderer.
If there was no one in Uplingham upon whom he could perform a good
action, he would just walk home&mdash;barely two miles&mdash;and go
to bed and forget all about it. To-morrow he would return to
Eish-and-chips, and the normal behavior of the normal citizen.</p>

<p>Uplingham was a dismal little town, consisting mostly of
churches, chapels and pubs, and apparently quite deserted. As Edwin
wandered through it there crept over him a sneaking feeling of
relief. If he met no one&mdash;well, there it was, he had done his
best; and he could go home with a clear conscience. After all it
was the spirit that counted in these things...</p>

<p>"O-o-oh!"</p>

<p>He was passing a small stone church, standing back on a little
frequented lane. The maiden was seated alone in the porch and she
was crying. Edwin bustled through the gate and as he approached her
he had time to observe that she was young, quietly dressed, and
distinctly pretty.</p>

<p>"You are in trouble," he said in his most feeling manner.</p>

<p>She looked up at him quickly, and dabbed her eyes.</p>

<p>"I've lost my baby! I've lost my baby!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, that's very unfortunate! How did it happen?"</p>

<p>She pointed at an empty perambulator in the porch.</p>

<p>"I waited an hour here for my friends and husband and the
clergyman. My baby was to be christened." She gasped incoherently.
"No one turned up. I went across to the Vicarage. The Vicar was
away. I believe I ought to have gone to St. Bride's. This is St.
Paul's. They didn't know anything about it. They say people often
make that mistake. When I got back the baby was gone.
O-o-o-oh!"</p>

<p>"There, there, don't cry," said Mr. Pothecary. "Now I'll go over
to St. Bride's and find out about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, do you mind waiting here with the perambulator while I
go? I want my baby. I want my baby."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course, of course."</p>

<p>She dashed up the lane and left Mr. Pothecary in charge of an
empty perambulator. In fifteen minutes' time a thick-set young man
came hurrying up to the porch. He looked at Edwin and pointing to
the perambulator said:</p>

<p>"Is this Mrs. Frank's or Mrs. Fred's? "</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Edwin, rather testily.</p>

<p>"You don't know! But you're old Binns, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not."</p>

<p>The young man looked at him searchingly and then disappeared.
Ten minutes elapsed and then a small boy rode up on a bicycle. He
was also out of breath.</p>

<p>"Has Mrs. George been 'ere?" be asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Edwin.</p>

<p>"Mr. Henderson says he's awfully sorry but he won't be able to
get away. You are to kiss the baby for 'im."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it."</p>

<p>"This is St. Bride's, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No, this is St. Paul's."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The boy leapt on to the bicycle and also vanished.</p>

<p>"This is absurd," thought Edwin. "Of course, the whole thing is
as plain as daylight. The poor girl has come to the wrong church.
The whole party is at St. Bride's, somebody must have taken the
baby on there. I might as well take the perambulator along. They'll
be pleased. Now I wonder which is the way."</p>

<p>He wheeled the perambulator into the lane. There was no one
about to ask. He progressed nearly two hundred yards till he came
to a field with a pond in it. This was apparently the wrong
direction. He was staring about when he suddenly became aware of a
hue and cry. A party of people came racing down the lane headed by
the thick-set man, who was exclaiming:</p>

<p>"There he is! There he is!"</p>

<p>Edwin felt his heart beating. This was going to he a little
embarrassing. They closed on him. The thickset man seized his
wrists and at the same time remarked:</p>

<p>"See he hasn't any firearms on him, Frank."</p>

<p>The large man alluded to as Frank gripped him from behind.</p>

<p>"What have you done with my baby?" he demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>"I 'aven't seen no baby," yelped Mr. Pothecary.</p>

<p>"Oh! 'Aven't yer! What are yer doin' with my perambulator
then?"</p>

<p>"I'm takin' it to St. Bride's Church."</p>

<p>"Goin' in the opposite direction."</p>

<p>"I didn't know the way."</p>

<p>"Where's the baby?"</p>

<p>"I 'aven't seen it, I tell yer. The mother said she'd lost
it."</p>

<p>"What the hell! Do you know the mother's in bed sick? You're a
liar, my man, and we're goin' to take you in charge. If you've done
anything to my baby I'll kill you with my hands."</p>

<p>"That's it, Frank. Let 'im 'ave it. Throw 'im in the pond!"</p>

<p>"I tell yer I don't know anythin' about it all, with yer Franks,
Freds and Georges! Go to the devil, all of yer!"</p>

<p>In spite of his protestations, some one produced a rope and they
handcuffed him and tied him to the gate of the field. A small crowd
had collected and began to boo and jeer. A man from a cottage bard
by produced a drag, and between them they dragged the pond, as the
general belief was that Edwin had tied a stone to the baby and
thrown it in and was then just about to make off.</p>

<p>The uproar continued for some time, mud and stones being thrown
about rather carelessly.</p>

<p>The crowd became impatient that no baby was found in the pond.
At length another man turned up on a bicycle and called out:</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Frank? You've missed the christening!"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Old Binns turned up with the nipper all right. He'd come round
the wrong way."</p>

<p>The crowd was obviously disappointed at the release of Edwin,
and the father's only solatium was:</p>

<p>"Well, it's lucky for you, old bird!"</p>

<p>He and his friends trundled the perambulator away rapidly across
the fields. Edwin had hardly time to give a sigh of relief before
he found himself the center of a fresh disturbance. He was
approaching the church when another crowd assailed him, headed by
the forlorn maiden. She was still in a state of distress, but she
was hugging a baby to her.</p>

<p>"Ah! You've found the baby!" exclaimed Edwin, trying to be
amiable.</p>

<p>"Where is the perambulator?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Your 'usband 'as taken it away, madam. He seemed to think
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>A tall frigid young man stepped forward and said:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, I am the lady's husband. Will you please explain
yourself?"</p>

<p>Then Edwin lost his temper.</p>

<p>"Well, damn it, I don't know who you all are!" Ihe case is quite
clear. You volunteered to take charge of the perambulator while my
wife was absent. On her return you announce that it is spirited
away. I shall hold you responsible for the entire cost&mdash;nearly
ten pounds."</p>

<p>"Make it a thousand," roared Edwin. "I'm 'aving a nice cheap
day."</p>

<p>"I don't wish for any more of your insolence, either. My wife
has had a very trying experience. The baby has been christened
Fred."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the matter with that?' 1 '</p>

<p>"Nothing," screamed the mother. "<i>Only that it is a girl! It's
a girl</i> and it has been duly christened Fred in a Christian
church. Oh! there's been an awful muddle."</p>

<p>"It's not this old fool's fault," interpolated the elderly woman
quietly. "You see, Mrs. Frank and Mrs. Fred Smith were both going
to have their babies christened to-day. Only Mrs. Frank was took
sick, and sent me along with the child. I went to the wrong church
and thinkin' there was some mistake, went back home. Mrs. Frank's
baby's never been christened at all. In the meantime, the ceremony
was ready to start at St. Paul's and Frank 'isself was there. No
baby. They sends old Binns to scout around at other churches.</p>

<p>People do make mistakes&mdash;finds this good lady's child all
primed up for christening in the church door, and no one near,
carries it off. In the meantime, the father had gone on the ramp.
It's him that probably went off with the perambulator and trounced
you up a bit, old sport. It'll learn you not to interfere so much
in future perhaps."</p>

<p>"And the baby's christened Fred!" wailed the mother. "My baby!
My Gwendoline!" And she looked at Edwin with bitter recrimination
in her eyes.</p>

<p>There was still a small crowd following and boys were jeering,
and a fox-terrier, getting very excited, jumped up and bit Mr.
Pothecary through the seat of his trousers. He struck at it with
his stick, and hit a small boy, whose mother happened to be
present. The good lady immediately entered the lists.</p>

<p>"Baby-killer...Hun!" were the last words he heard as he was
chased up the street and across the fields in the direction of his
own village.</p>

<p>When he arrived it was nearly dark. Mr. Pothecary was tired,
dirty, battered, tom, outraged, bruised and hatless. And his spirit
hardened. The forces of reaction surged through him. He was done
with good actions. He felt vindictive, spiteful, wicked. Slowly he
took the last turning and his eye once more alighted on&mdash;the
Peels's fowl house.</p>

<p>And there came to him a vague desire to end his day by
performing some action the contrary to good, something spiteful,
petty, malign. His soul demanded some recompense for its abortive
energies. And then he remembered that the Peels were away. They
were returning late that evening. The two intensive fowl-houses
were at the end of the kitchen garden, where all the young spring
cabbages and peas had just been planted. They could be approached
between a slit in the narrow black fence adjacent to a turnip
field. Rather a long way round. A simple and rather futile plan
sprang into his mind, but he was too tired to think of anything
more criminal or diabolic.</p>

<p>He would creep round to the back, get through the fence, force
his way into the fowl-house. Then he would kick out all those
expensive Rhode Island pampered hens and lock them out. Inside he
would upset everything and smash the place to pieces. The fowls
would get all over the place. They would eat the young vegetables.
Some of them would get lost, stolen by gypsies, killed by rats.
What did he care? The Peels would probably not discover the outrage
till the morrow, and they would never know who did it. Edwin
chuckled inwardly, and rolled his eyes like the smooth villain of a
fit-up melodrama. He glanced up and down to see that no one was
looking, then he got across a gate and entered the turnip
field.</p>

<p>Within five minutes he was forcing the door of the fowl-house
with a spade. The fowls were already settling down for the night,
and they clucked rather alarmingly, but Edwin's blood was up. He
chased them all out, forty-five of them, and made savage lunges at
them with his feet. Then he upset all the corn he could find, and
poured water on it and jumped on it. He smashed the complicated
invention suspended from the ceiling, whereby the fowls had to
reach up and get one grain of corn at a time. To his joy he found a
pot of green paint, which he flung promiscuously over the walls and
floor (and incidentally his clothes).</p>

<p>Then he crept out and bolted both of the doors.</p>

<p>The sleepy creatures were standing about outside, some feebly
pecking about on the ground. He chased them through into the
vegetable garden; then he rubbed some of the dirt and paint from
his clothes and returned to the road.</p>

<p>When he arrived home he said to his wife:</p>

<p>"I fell off a tram on Waterloo Bridge. Lost my hat."</p>

<p>He was cold and wet and his teeth were chattering. His wife
bustled him off to bed and gave him a little hot grog.</p>

<p>Between the sheets he recovered contentment. He gurgled
exultantly at this last and only satisfying exploit of the day. He
dreamed lazily of the blind rage of the Peels...</p>

<p>It must have been half-past ten when his wife came up to bring
him some hot gruel. He had been asleep. She put the cup by the
bedside and rearranged his pillow.</p>

<p>"Feeling better?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm right," he murmured.</p>

<p>She sat on a chair by the side of the bed and after a few
minutes remarked:</p>

<p>"You've missed an excitement while you've been asleep."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A fire!"</p>

<p>"A fire?"</p>

<p>"The Peels came home about an hour and a half ago and found the
place on fire at the back."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"Their cook Lizzie has been over. She said some straw near the
wash-house must have started it. It's burnt out the wash-house and
both the fowl-houses. She says Mr. Peel says he don't care very
much because he was heavily insured for the lot. But the funny
thing is, the fowls wasn't insured and they've found the whole lot
down the field on the rabbit-hutches. Somebody must have got in and
let the whole lot out. It was a fine thing to do, or else the poor
things would have been burnt up. What's the matter, Ned? Is the
gruel too hot?"</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. The Packet</h2>

<p class="cpb">I</p>

<p>Mr. Bultishaw stood leaning heavily against the bar in "The
Duchess of Teck," talking to his friend, Mr. Ticknett. Their
friendship had endured for nearly twenty-seven years, and they
still called each other "<i>Mr.</i>" Bultishaw and "<i>Mr.</i>"
Ticknett. They were on the surface a curiously ill-matched couple,
and the other salesmen and buyers from Cotterway's could never see
what they had in common. Bultishaw was a big puffy man, shabbily
florid. He had a fat babyish face, with large bright eyes which
always seemed to be on the verge of tears, but whether this
condition of liquefaction was due to his excessive emotionalism, or
to the generally liquid state of his whole body, it would be
difficult to decide. He was of an excitable nature, and though his
voice seemed to come wheezing through various local derangements of
his system, and was always pitched in a low key, it suggested a
degree of excitement&mdash;usually of a querulous kind&mdash;quite
remarkable in a person of his appearance. He was a man of moods,
too...He was not always querulous, in fact his querulousness might
generally be traced to an occasional revolt of his organic system
against the treatment to which it was normally subjected. There
were times when he was genial, playful, kind, sentimental, and
maudlin. His clothes had a certain pretentiousness of style and
wealth, not sustained by the dilapidated condition of their linings
and edges, and the many stains of alcohol and the burns from
matches and tobacco carelessly dropped. He was the manager of the
linoleum department at Cotterway's.</p>

<p>Ticknett had a similar position with regard to "soft goods" in
the same firm. But in appearance and character he was entirely
dissimilar to Bultishaw. One of the junior salesmen one day called
him "The Chinese God," and there was indeed something a little
Eastern in his reserved manner, his suavity, and his great capacity
for apparently minding his own business and yet at the same
time&mdash;well, nobody liked Ticknett, but they all admired his
ability, and most of them feared him. He was admired because he had
risen from the position of being a "packer" in the yard to that of
great influence, and he even shared the confidence of Mr. Joseph
Cotterway himself. Hie skin was rather yellow, and he had very
heavy black eyebrows and mustache and deep-set eyes with a slight
cast. His clothes were so well cut that in the bar of "The Duchess
of Teck" they seemed almost assertively unobtrusive.</p>

<p>Bultishaw was a prolific talker, and Ticknett was a patient
listener. This was perhaps one of their principal bonds of mutual
understanding. They had, of course, one common interest of an
absorbing nature. It bubbled and sparkled in the innumerable
glasses which, at all hours of the day, Mrs. Clarke and Daphne and
Gladys handed to them across the bar of "The Duchess of Teck,"
which in those days was always crowded with the salesmen and the
staff of Cotterway's.</p>

<p>On this particular morning, Bultishaw was holding a glass in his
fat fingers, and breathing heavily between each sentence. He was
saying:</p>

<p>"'Sperience is the thing that counts in the furnishing trade,
like anywhere else&mdash;ugh! Take any line you
like&mdash;ugh!&mdash;buying cork carpets, eating oysters, or
extending the Empire&mdash;ugh!&mdash;it's the man with'sperience
who counts. These young fellers!...ugh!..."</p>

<p>Bultishaw shrugged his shoulders expressively, and glanced round
the bar. Immediately a change came over his expression. His eyes
sparkled angrily, and he shook the dregs of whisky in his glass,
and drank them off with a spluttering gulp. Ticknett followed the
glance of his friend and was quickly observant of the reason of
Bultishaw's sudden trepidation. "Percy" had entered the bar. Percy
was Bultishaw's assistant and also his <i>béte noir</i>.</p>

<p>He was a slim young man dressed in a most extravagant manner. He
had a pale face, and a slightly receding chin. He wore a small
bowler hat with a very narrow brim, pointed patent leather boots, a
very shapely overcoat which almost suggested that he wore corsets,
a pale lemon tie held together by a gold pin, and a spotted green
waistcoat.</p>

<p>Percy was a very high-spirited young person&mdash;an
irrepressible&mdash;with, a genius for taking stage center. He was
invariably accompanied by several friends of his own age, and he
had a habit of greeting a whole barful of men, whether he knew them
or not, with a cheering cry of:</p>

<p>"Hullo! hullo! HULLO! So here we all are!"</p>

<p>He would deliver this greeting with such a gay abandon that
every one would look up and laugh. Men would nod, and call out:</p>

<p>"Hullo! here's Percy! How do, Percy?"</p>

<p>And even those who did not know him would be conscious of some
contagious fever of geniality. The conversation would grow louder
and livelier, and Percy would invariably become the center of a
laughing group.</p>

<p>In spite of his extravagance of manner, his irresponsibility,
his passion for misquoting poetry, he had been marked down by
several discriminating heads of the firm as "a smart boy."</p>

<p>He was indeed a very smart boy, from his gay clothes to his
sparkling repartée with Daphne and Gladys. To Daphne it was known
that he was an especial favorite. He would hold her hand across the
bar, and smile at her engagingly, and say:</p>

<p>"And how is the moon of my delight!" And other enigmatic and
brilliant things.</p>

<p>And Daphne would look at him with her sleepy, passionate eyes,
and say:</p>

<p>"Oh, go on! You are a one!"</p>

<p>She was a silent little thing, incredibly ignorant. She was not
pretty, but she had masses of gold-brown hair, and a figure rather
over-developed. There was about her something extremely attractive
to the men who frequented "The Duchess of Teck," a kind of brooding
motherliness. She had an appealing way of sighing, and her eyes
were always watchful, as though in the face of every stranger she
might discover the solution of her troubles.</p>

<p>Bultishaw hated Percy for several reasons. One was essentially a
question of personality. He hated his aggressive exuberance, his
youthfulness, his ridiculous clothes, his way of brushing back his
hair, and incidentally of scoring off Bultishaw. He hated him
because he had the habit of upsetting the placid calm of "The
Duchess of Teck." He created a restlessness. People did not listen
so well when Percy was in the room.</p>

<p>Moreover, he hated the way he took possession of Daphne. It is
difficult to know what Bultishaw's ideas were with regard to
Daphne. He was himself a widower, aged fifty-six, and he lived in a
small flat in Bloomsbury with his two daughters, who were both
about Daphne's age. He never made love to her, but he treated her
with a sort of proprietary sense of confidence. He told her all
about himself. In the morning when the bar was empty he would
expatiate on the various ailments which had assailed him overnight,
his sleeplessness, his indigestion, his loss of appetite. And he
found her very sympathetic. She would say:</p>

<p>"Oh, reely, Mr. Bultishaw! I am sorry! It's too bad! Have you
ever tried Ponk's Pills?"</p>

<p>They would discuss Ponk's Pills exhaustively, and their effect
on the system, but eventually Mr. Bultishaw would say that he
thought he would try "just a wee drop of Scotch." And so he would
start his day.</p>

<p>It must, alas! be acknowledged that the accumulated years of his
convivial mode of life were beginning to tell on Bultishaw. He was
not the man he was. At his best he was a good salesman. He knew the
cork lino industry inside out. He had had endless experience. But
there were days of fuddlement, days when he would make grievous
mistakes, forget appointments, go wrong in his calculations. And
the directors were not unobservant of the deterioration of his work
and of his personal appearance. There was a very big rumor that
Bultishaw was to be superseded by a younger man. This rumor had
reached Bultishaw himself, and he accepted it with ironic
incredulity.</p>

<p>"How can any one manage lino without'sperience?" he said.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the rumor had worried him of late, and had
increased his sleeplessness. He was conscious of himself&mdash;the
vast moral bulk of himself rolling down the hill. He knew he would
never be able to give up drinking. He had no intention of trying.
He had been at it too long. He had managed in his time to save
nearly a thousand pounds. If he were sacked it would bring in a
little bit, but not enough to live on. About fifty pounds a year,
but he spent quite this amount in the bar of "The Duchess of Teck"
alone. He would have to hunt round for another job. It would be
ignominious, and it might be difficult to secure at his age.</p>

<p>This was, then, another reason for disliking Percy, for "the
smart boy's" name had been mentioned in this very connection. And
what did this soapy-headed young fool know about cork carpets!
What'sperience had he had! A paltry two years. He was, too, so
insufferably familiar and insolent. He had even once had the
audacity to address Bultishaw as "Mr. Bulkychops," a pseudonym that
was not only greeted with roars of laughter but had been adopted by
others.</p>

<p>On this morning then when Percy made his accustomed entrance
with its bravura accompaniment: "Hullo! hullo! HULLO! So here we
all are!" Mr. Bultishaw's hand trembled, and he turned his back and
muttered:</p>

<p>"That young&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The yellow face of Ticknett turned in the direction of Percy,
but it was quite expressionless and he made no comment. He lighted
another cigarette and looked across the bar at Daphne. The girl's
cheeks were dimpled with smiles. Percy was talking to her. Suddenly
Ticknett said to her in his chilling voice:</p>

<p>"I want two more Scotch whiskies and a split soda."</p>

<p>The girl looked up, and the dimples left her cheeks. She seemed
almost imperceptibly to shrink within herself. She poured out the
drinks and handed them to Ticknett. Bultishaw continued his
querulous complaints about the insolence of young and ignorant men,
trying to oust older and more experienced men from their hardly
fought for positions.</p>

<p>And Ticknett listened, and his dark mustache moved in a peculiar
way as he said:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I quite agree with you, Mr. Bultishaw. It's too
bad."</p>

<p class="cpb">II</p>

<p>A week later there was a sudden and dramatic turn of events in
the firm of Cotterway's. Much to everybody's surprise, Percy was
suddenly sacked without any reason being given, and Bultishaw was
retained. In fact, Bultishaw was given another two years' contract
on the same terms as before.</p>

<p>To what extent Ticknett was responsible for this development or
what was really at the back of it all, nobody was ever quite clear.
It is certain that on the day of Percy's dismissal these two
friends dined together, and spent an evening of a somewhat
bacchanalian character. It is known that at that time Ticknett had
been conspicuously successful over some deal in tapestries with a
French firm, and that he had lunched one day alone with Mr. Joseph
Cotterway. It is doubtful even whether he ever gave the precise
details of his machinations to Bultishaw himself. The result
certainly had the appearance of quickening their friendship. They
called each other "dear old feller," and there were many whispered
implications about "insolent young swine."</p>

<p>The career of Percy was watched with interest. Of course he took
his dismissal with a laugh, and entertained a party of his friends
to a hilarious farewell supper.</p>

<p>But it happened that that summer was a peculiarly stagnant one
in the furnishing world. The brilliant youth did not find it so
easy to secure another situation. He was observed at first swinging
about the West End in his splendidly nonchalant manner, and he
Still frequented the bar of "The Duchess of Teck." But gradually
these appearances became more rare. As the months went by he began
to lose a little of his self-assurance and swagger, and it is even
to be regretted that his gay clothes began to show evidences of
wear. He once secured a situation at a small firm in Bayswater, but
at the end of three weeks he was again dismissed, the proprietor
going bankrupt owing to some unfortunate speculation. It would be
idle to imagine what Percy's career would have been had not the war
broken out in August when he was still out of employment. He
volunteered for service the morning after war was declared, and
then indeed there was a great scene of bibulous enthusiasm in "The
Duchess of Teck." He was toasted and treated, and every one was
crying out:</p>

<p>"Well, good luck, Percy, old man."</p>

<p>And Percy was in the highest spirits, and borrowed money from
every one to stand treat to every one else. And Daphne cried quite
openly, and in the corner of the bar Bultishaw was whispering to
Ticknett:</p>

<p>"This'll knock the starch out of the young swine."</p>

<p>And Ticknett replied:</p>

<p>"He'll get killed."</p>

<p>There was at times a certain curious finality about Ticknett's
statements that had a way of making people shudder.</p>

<p>Bultishaw laughed uncomfortably and repeated:</p>

<p>"It'll knock the starch out of him."</p>

<p>The departure of Percy was soon almost forgotten in the
bewilderment of drama that began to convulse Europe. Others went
also. There was upheaval, and something of a panic in the
furnishing world. Every man had his own interests to consider, and
there was the big story unfolding day by day to absorb all spare
attention. Perhaps the only man among all the devotees of "The
Duchess of Teck" who thought considerably about Percy was
Bultishaw. It was very annoying, but he could not dismiss the young
man from his thoughts.</p>

<p>When the autumn came on, and the cold November rains washed the
London streets, Bultishaw would suddenly think of Percy and he
would shiver. Percy had been sent to some camp in Essex for his
training, and often in the night Bultishaw would wake up and
visualize Percy sleeping out in the open, getting wet through to
the skin, possibly getting rheumatic fever. He was a ridiculously
delicate-looking young man, quite unfitted to be a soldier. It
occurred to Bultishaw more than once that if he and Ticknett
hadn't...if Percy had secured his position, which everybody said
was his due...he wouldn't have been sent out into all this.</p>

<p>And "all this" was a terrible thing to Bultishaw. During the
fifty-six years of his life he had made a god of comfort. He loved
warmth, good cheer, food, drink, security. The alternative seemed
to him hell. He could not believe that there could be any sort of
compensation in discomfort, and hardship, in restraint, and
discipline, and self-abnegation. It was the thing he could not
understand. And then at the end was the Awful Thing itself. He
could not bear to dwell on that. He drank more prodigiously than
ever.</p>

<p>The firm of Cotterway's was reorganized, and Bultishaw would
undoubtedly have had the sack if it had not been for his two years'
contract. As it was, expenses in every respect were cut down, and
Bultishaw's royalties only amounted to a very small sum. He lived
above his salary, and broke into his capital. He seemed more and
more to rely on Ticknett. The manager of soft goods seemed to him
the one stable thing in a shifting world.</p>

<p>When Percy one day made his sudden, meteoric, and final
appearance in "The Duchess of Teck" the whole thing seemed like a
dream. The usual crowd was gathered just before lunch, drinking
gins and bitters, and whisky, and beer, and talking about
"<i>our</i>" navy, and "<i>our</i>" army, and "<i>our</i>"
Government, and what "<i>we</i>" should do to the Germans, when the
level hum of conversation was broken by a loud and breezy:</p>

<p>"Hullo! hullo! HULLO! So here we all are!"</p>

<p>And lo! and behold, there was Percy, looking somehow bigger than
usual, the general gaiety of his appearance emphasized by a pink
complexion, a distinct increase of girth, and a beautiful khaki
suit. And Bultishaw found himself clapped on the back and the same
voice was exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Well, 'ow are you, Bulky-chops? Lookin' better than ever, 'pon
my word!"</p>

<p>And then the bar was immediately in a roar of conviviality.
Everybody struggled for the honor of standing Percy drinks, for he
explained that he was off the next day to France. It is to be
feared that during that afternoon Percy got rather drunk. He
certainly indulged in violent moods between boisterous hilarity and
a certain sullen pugnacity. At intervals he would continually ask
for Ticknett, but to Bultishaw's surprise, Ticknett had disappeared
almost immediately Percy entered the bar, and was not seen again
that day. While, on the other side, Daphne stood cowering against
the mahogany casings, looking deadly pale, with great black rings
around her eyes.</p>

<p>Percy was quite friendly to Bultishaw, and introduced him to a
friend of his in the same regiment, named Prosser, a young man who
had previously been in a drapery store. It was not till later in
the evening that the dull rumble of some imminent tragedy caused
the vast bulk of the linoleum manager's body to tremble. He had
been conscious of it all the afternoon. He was frightened. He did
not like the way Percy had asked for Ticknett. He did not like
Ticknett's disappearance, and above all he did not like the way
Daphne had cowered against the wall. There was something at the
back of all this, something uncomfortable. He dreaded things of
this nature. Why couldn't people go on quietly, eating and drinking
and being comfortable? He avoided "The Duchess of Teck," and
actually stayed late at his work and caught up some arrears. He
decided to go quickly home. When he got outside he commenced to
walk, when suddenly Percy came out of a doorway and took hold of
his arm. Bultishaw started.</p>

<p>"What is it? What do you want?" he said.</p>

<p>There was something very curious about Percy. He had never seen
him like that before. He had been drinking, but he was not drunk.
In fact, Bultishaw had never seen him in some ways so sober, so
grimly serious. His lips were trembling, and his eyes were
unnaturally bright. He gripped Bultishaw's coat and said:</p>

<p>"Where is your friend Ticknett?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I haven't seen him since this morning," Bultishaw
answered.</p>

<p>"Will you swear he isn't in the building? and that you don't
know where he is?"</p>

<p>"Yes," gasped the cork-lino manager.</p>

<p>Percy looked into his eyes for some moments, and then he said
queerly:</p>

<p>"Ticknett knows that I've got to report first thing in the
morning. I've just seen Daphne home. There'll be a packet for
Ticknett, do you see? I say there'll be a packet for him. D' you
understand, Bulky-chops?"</p>

<p>Bultishaw was very frightened. He did not know a bit what the
young man meant. He only knew that he wanted to get away. He didn't
want to be mixed up in this. He mumbled:</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;er&mdash;a packet?...I'll tell him."</p>

<p>"No, you needn't tell him," answered the soldier. "I'm sayin'
this for your benefit. I say there'll be a packet for him. D' you
understand? There'll be a packet for him."</p>

<p>And he melted into the night...</p>

<p class="cpb">III</p>

<p>From the day when Percy disappeared with these mysterious words
on his lips to the day when the news came that he had been killed
there was an interval of time that varied according to the
occupation and the preoccupation of his particular acquaintances.
To Bultishaw it appeared a very long time, but this may have been
partly due to the fact that in the interval he had spent most of
the time in bed with a very serious illness. He had been lying on
his back, staring at the ceiling, and he had not been allowed to
drink. The time had consequently hung very heavily on his hands,
and his thoughts had been feeding on each other. The exact time was
in effect eleven weeks.</p>

<p>During the latter part of this period his friend Ticknett paid
him many visits, and had been very kind and attentive. And it was
he indeed who brought the news that Percy had been killed.</p>

<p>It was one evening when it was nearly dark, and Bultishaw was
sitting up in his dressing-gown in front of the fire, and his
daughter Elsie was sitting on the other side of the fireplace,
sewing. Ticknett paid one of his customary visits. Elsie showed him
to an easy chair between the two, and after Ticknett's solicitous
enquiries regarding Bultishaw's health, the two men reverted to
their usual discussion of the staff of Cotterway's and their
friends. Suddenly Ticknett remarked quite casually:</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, young Percy has been killed at the front."</p>

<p>And then the room seemed to become violently darker. Bultishaw
struggled to frame some suitable comment upon this but the words
failed to come. He sat there with his fat, puffy hands pressing the
sides of his easy chair. At last he said:</p>

<p>"Elsie, you might go and get my beef-tea ready."</p>

<p>When his daughter had gone out of the room, he still had nothing
to say. He had not dismissed her for the purpose of speaking about
the matter to Ticknett, but simply because a strange mood had come
to him that he could not trust himself. In the gathering darkness
he could see the sallow mask of his friend's face looking at the
fire, and his cold eyes peering beneath his heavy brows. Bultishaw
at length managed to say:</p>

<p>"Any particulars?"</p>

<p>And Ticknett replied:</p>

<p>"No. It was in the papers yesterday."</p>

<p>And then Ticknett smiled and added:</p>

<p>"So you won't have to bother about your job any longer, Mr.
Bultishaw."</p>

<p>And Bultishaw thought:</p>

<p>"There'll be a packet for you, Ticknett. A packet. Do you
understand? And by God! you'll deserve it!"</p>

<p>He was still uncertain of what "the packet" would contain, but
he had thought a lot about it during his illness, and he was sure
the packet would contain something unpleasant, if not terrible. And
yet Ticknett was his friend, in fact his only friend; the man who
had saved him in a crisis, and who waited on him in his sickness.
He tried to pull himself together, and he managed to say in his
normally wheezy voice:</p>

<p>"I hope to be back next week."</p>

<p>And indeed on the following Tuesday he did once more report
himself to the heads of the firm. He was still very weak and ill,
and the doctor had warned him to avoid alcohol in any form. But by
half-past twelve he felt so exhausted he decided that a little
whisky and milk might help to get him through the day. He crawled
round to "The Duchess of Teck" and was soon amongst his congenial
acquaintances. It was very warm, very pleasant and ingratiating,
the atmosphere of the bar. He ordered his whisky and milk, and then
became aware of a striking vacancy. Daphne was not there. Mrs.
Clarke and Gladys were busy serving drinks, and a tall thin girl
was helping them. A peculiar sense of misgiving came to Bultishaw.
He did not like to say anything about it to Mrs. Clarke, but he
turned to an old habitué, named Benjamin Strigge, and he
whispered:</p>

<p>"Where's Daphne to-day, Mr. Strigge?"</p>

<p>And Mr. Strigge answered:</p>

<p>"Daphne? She ain't been here for nearly three months. There was
some story about her and young Percy. I've really forgotten what it
was all about. Of course, you 've been away, Mr. Bultishaw. You 've
missed all the spicy news, eh? They never interest me. Ha, ha, ha!
Can I order you another whisky and milk?"</p>

<p>Bultishaw declined with thanks, and stood there sucking his
pipe. In a few minutes Ticknett entered the bar. He appeared to be
quite cheerful, and for him garrulous. He was very solicitous about
Bultishaw's health, and insistent that he should not stand near a
draught. He talked optimistically about the war, and Bultishaw
replied in monosyllables. And all the time the ridiculous thought
kept racing through his mind:</p>

<p>"You 're going to get a packet, my friend."</p>

<p>It was a week later that Prosser turned up. He was one of eleven
men, the sole survivors of a regiment&mdash;Percy's regiment.
Prosser was slightly wounded in the foot, and strangely altered. He
stammered and was no longer a gay companion. He had a wild,
abstracted look, as though he had lost the power of listening, and
was entirely occupied with inner visions. They could get little
information out of him about Percy. He described certain scenes and
experiences very vividly, but the description did not convey much
to most of the men, for the reason that they were entirely devoid
of imagination. The regiment had, as a matter of fact, been
ambushed, and practically annihilated. A mine had done some deadly
work. He had seen Percy and another man come into the lines in the
morning. It was just daybreak. They had been on listening patrol.
He had seen them both making their way along a trench to a dug-out,
to the very spot where five minutes later the mine blew up.</p>

<p>"Didn't you never see Percy again!" some one asked.</p>

<p>"No," answered the warrior. "But I 'eard 'im laugh."</p>

<p>"Laugh!"</p>

<p>"Yes. You know the way he used to laugh. Loud and clear-like. He
must have been two hundred yards away. Suddenly he laughed, and I
says to Peters, who was on my right, ''Ark at that blighter, Percy!
Seems to think even this is amusin'.' I 'adn't got the words out of
my mouth when...just as though the whole bally earth had burst into
a gas...not a quarter of a mile away&mdash;thought I was gone
myself...right over in the quarter where Percy had gone...thousands
of tons of mud flung up into the sky...you could 'ear the earth
being ripped to pieces, and there were men in it...Oh, Gawd!"</p>

<p>Bultishaw shuddered and felt faint, and the rest of the company
seemed to think they were hearing a rather highly colored account
of some quite inconceivable phenomenon. Prosser was further
detailing his narrative, when he happened to drop a phrase that was
very illuminating to Bnltishaw. He was speaking of another man some
of them knew, named Bates. The phrase he used was:</p>

<p>"Charley Bates got a packet too!"</p>

<p>A packet! Bnltishaw paid for his drink and went out into the
street. He felt rather hot and cold round the temples. He took a
cab home, and went straight to bed, explaining to his daughters
that he had had 'a very heavy day.' When he rolled between the
sheets the true meaning of that sinister phrase "getting a packet"
kept revolving through his mind. It was evidently the military
expression, and very terse and grim and sardonic it was. These men
who met a violent end "got a packet." Percy had got a packet, Bates
had got a packet, but why should Ticknett, dividing his days
between a furnishing house and a saloon bar, get a packet? It was
incredible, preposterous. Men who went out to fight for their
country, well&mdash;they might expect it. But not men who lead
simple, honest, commercial lives. If Ticknett got a packet, why
should he not himself get a packet! He passed a sleepless night,
but there was one problem he determined to try and solve on the
morrow.</p>

<p class="cpb">IV</p>

<p>Somehow Bultishaw could not bring himself to ask Mrs. Clarke
about Daphne, and Gladys, whom he always suspected of laughing at
him, he would certainly not question. He eventually got her address
from a potman, who had carried some of her things home for her.</p>

<p>When he did get her address, it took him over a week to make up
his mind to visit her. He thumbed the envelope and breathed heavily
on it, put it back in his pocket and took it out again, and tried
to dismiss it from his mind, but the very touch of it seemed to
burn his body. At length, on the following Saturday night, he
tucked it finally into his waistcoat pocket, and set out in the
direction of Kilburn.</p>

<p>It was very dark when he found the obscure street. And the
number of the address was a gaunt house of four stories above a
low-class restaurant where sausages and slabs of fish were frying
in the window, to tempt hungry passers-by. He stumbled up the dark
stairs, and was told by two children whom he could not see that
"Miss Allen" lived on the third floor. He rang the wrong bell on
the third floor (there were two lots of inhabitants) and was told
by a lady that "she liked his bleeding cheek waking her in her
first sleep, ringing the wrong bell," and the door was slammed in
his face.</p>

<p>He tried the other bell, and the door was opened immediately by
a gaunt woman who said:</p>

<p>"Who's that? Oh, I thought it was the doctor!"</p>

<p>Bultishaw asked if Miss Daphne Allen lived there, and gave his
own name.</p>

<p>The woman stared at him and then said:</p>

<p>"Wait a minute."</p>

<p>She shut the door and left him outside. After a time she came
back and said:</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>Bultishaw said, "I just want to speak to her for a few
minutes."</p>

<p>The woman again retired, and left him for nearly five minutes.
He stood there shivering with cold on the stone stairs, and
listening to the strange mixture of noises: children quarreling in
the street below, and in the room opposite some one playing a mouth
organ. At last the woman came back. She said:</p>

<p>"Come in."</p>

<p>He followed her into a poky room, dimly lighted by a tin
paraffin lamp with a pink glass. In the corner of the room was a
bed on which a woman was lying, feeding a baby. Her face looked
white and thin and her hair was bound up in a shawl. It was Daphne.
She looked at him listlessly, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, have you brought any money from him?"</p>

<p>Bultishaw stood blinking at her, unable to comprehend. Whom did
she mean by "him"? He coughed, and tried to formulate some
sympathetic enquiry, when suddenly the gaunt woman who had shown
him in turned on him and cried:</p>

<p>"Well, what the hell are you standing there like that for?
You've come from him, I suppose? You're 'is greatest pal, ain't
yer? We've never seen a farthing of 'is money yet since the dirty
blackguard did 'er in. What 'ave you come slobbering up 'ere for,
if it ain't to bring some money? The b&mdash;&mdash;y 'ound! If it
'adn't been for 'im, she might be the wife of a respectable
sowljer, and gettin' 'er maintenance and pension, and all
that."</p>

<p>There was a mild sob from the bed, and a pleading voice that
cried:</p>

<p>"Aunty! Aunty!"</p>

<p>And the baby started to cry. While these little things were
happening, the slow-moving mind of Bultishaw for once worked
rapidly, came to a conclusion, and formed a resolution. He moved
ponderously to the lamp, and took out his purse. He looked across
the lamp at Daphne and said:</p>

<p>"He sends you this. He's sorry not to have sent before.
He..."</p>

<p>The elder woman dashed toward the table, and looked at the
money.</p>

<p>"How much is it?" she said, and then turning to Daphne, she
rasped: "It's two quid. That's better than nothing. Is there any
more to come?"</p>

<p>Bultishaw again looked at Daphne. She was bending over the
child. She seemed indifferent. A strand of her hair had broken
loose beneath the shawl. Bultishaw stammered:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;er&mdash;of course. There'll be&mdash;er&mdash;the
same again."</p>

<p>"'Ow often?" whined the elder woman.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;two pounds&mdash;every fortnight. Er&mdash;I'll bring
it myself."</p>

<p>The big man blew his nose, and shuffled from one foot to
another.</p>

<p>"Are you getting better? Is there anything else?" he
mumbled.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," whined the elder woman. "We 're living in the lap of
luxury. Everything we could want. Ain't we, Cissy?"</p>

<p>The woman on the bed did not answer, and Bultishaw fumbled his
way out of the room.</p>

<p>That night Bultishaw had a mild return of his illness. He was
very feverish. His mind became occupied with visions of Percy.
Percy, the gay, the debonair. There was a long line of poplars by a
canal, and some low buildings of a factory on the left. The earth
was seamed with jagged cuts and holes. Men were burrowing their way
underground like moles. The thing was like a torn fringe of
humanity, wildly insane. It was very dark, but one was conscious
that vast numbers of men were scratching their way toward each
other, zigzagging in a drunken, frenzied manner. There was a stench
of decaying matter, and of some chemical even more penetrating.
There were millions and millions of men, but they were all
invisible, silently scratching and listening. Suddenly amidst the
dead silence there was the loud burst of Percy's
laughter&mdash;just as he had laughed in the bar of "The Duchess of
Teck"&mdash;and his voice rang through the night:</p>

<p>"Hullo! hullo! HULLO! So here we all are!"</p>

<p>And this challenge seemed to awaken the lurking passions of the
night. Bultishaw groaned, and started up in bed, and cried out:</p>

<p>"O God! a thousand tons of mud! a thousand tons of mud!"</p>

<p>On the following day Bultishaw made a grievous mistake in his
accounts. He was severely hauled over the coals by the directors.
As the weeks proceeded he made other mistakes. He became morose and
abstracted. He drank his whisky with less and less soda, till he
was drinking it almost neat.</p>

<p>"Old Bulky-chops's brain's going," said some of the other
salesmen.</p>

<p>He would lean up against the bar, and stare at Ticknett. Their
old conversational relationship became reversed. It was Bultishaw
who listened, and Ticknett who did the talking. The soft goods
manager appeared to be in excellent trim at the time. He seemed
more light-hearted than he had been for years. He spoke in his
quiet voice about the tactics of Russian generals, and the need for
general compulsion in this country for everybody up to the age of
forty-five (Ticknett was forty-seven). At Christmas-time he sent
Bultishaw a case of old port wine. His position in the firm became
more assured. It was said that Ticknett had bought a large block of
shares in Cotterway's, Limited, and that he stood a good chance of
being put on the board of directorship.</p>

<p>And Bultishaw watched his upward progress with a curious
intentness. He himself was blundering down the hill. He had made a
large inroad into his capital, and the day could not be far distant
when he would be dismissed. Every fortnight he went out to Kilburn
and took two sovereigns, and he never spoke of this to
Ticknett.</p>

<p class="cpb">V</p>

<p>Elsie Bultishaw was very mysterious. In her black crepe dress
she bustled about the small room, holding the teapot in her
hand.</p>

<p>"They say you should never speak ill of the dead," she whispered
to her visitor. She emptied a packet of tea into a caddy, and
tipped three teaspoonsful into the pot.</p>

<p>"Of course," she continued, "it's very hard on me and Dorothy.
It's lucky Dorothy's got that job at the War Office, or I don't
know what we'd do."</p>

<p>"Your pore father was not a careful man, I know, my dear," said
the visitor.</p>

<p>Elsie poured the boiling water on to the tea-leaves, and
sighed.</p>

<p>"It wasn't only that, my dear," she answered. She coughed and
then added in a low voice:</p>

<p>"There was some woman in the case. A barmaid, in fact. Of
course, pore father's illness cost a lot of money, what with
doctors, and specialists, and loss of time and that. But it seems
he'd been keeping this woman too, taking her money every fortnight.
When everything's settled up, there won't be more 'n twenty pounds
a year for me and Dorothy."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" said the visitor. "It's all very tragic, my
dear."</p>

<p>"You can't think," Elsie continued, warming to the excitement of
her narrative, "what we 've been through. We could never have
<i>lived</i> through it, if it hadn't been for Mr. Ticknett. He's
been kindness itself. And such an extraordinary hallucination pore
father had about him. I didn't tell you, did I, dear?"</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>"I'll never forget that night father came home. He'd been
drinking, of course. But it wasn't only that. I've never seen him
like it. He just raved. It was very late, and me and Dorothy were
going to bed. He came stumbling into this room, his eyes lookin'
all bright and glassylike. He started by saying that the dead could
speak. He said he'd only obeyed the voice of the dead. And then he
said something about a packet, and about Mr. Ticknett. I was
terrified. He described something he said he'd just done. He walked
about the room. He pointed to that corner. 'Look,' he says,
'Ticknett was standin' there.' There'd been a dinner to celebrate
Mr. Ticknett's election on to the board of directors of
Cotterway's. 'I never take my eyes off him all the evening,' father
says. 'It was after the dinner, and we went into the saloon.
Ticknett was surrounded by his friends. I watched his lying,
treacherous, yellow face smirkin' all around. And suddenly a voice
spoke to me, a voice from some dim field in France. It says,
"Ticknett's going to have a packet." And then I drew my revolver
and shot him through the face!' Dorothy shrieked, and I tried to
get father to bed. Of course it was all rubbish. He'd never shot no
one. It was just raving. Everybody knows that Mr. Ticknett's been
father's best friend. He's helped him crowds of times. A nicer man
you couldn't meet. He's coming to tea on Sunday. We managed to get
poor father to bed, and to get a doctor. But it was no good. He
babbled like a child all night. It was so funny like. He really was
like a child. He kept on repeating, 'A thousand tons of mud!' and
then suddenly, about mornin', he got quite quiet, and his face
looked like some great baby's lying there...He died quite
peaceful."</p>

<p>Elsie performed a little mild weep, and the visitor indulged in
various exclamations of sympathy and interest.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," she concluded, "it's dreadful the things people
imagine when&mdash;they're like that."</p>

<p>Elsie went over all the details again, and the visitor recounted
a tragic episode she had heard of in connection with a corporal's
widow, who was a relation of her own landlady. They discussed the
dreadful war, and its effect on the price of bacon and
margarine.</p>

<p>After her departure, Elsie washed out and ironed some
handkerchiefs, and then prepared her sister's supper. Dorothy
arrived home about seven, and the two sisters discussed the events
of the day. They sat in front of the fire and listened to a pot
stewing. At a sudden pause, Dorothy looked into the fire, and
said:</p>

<p>"Do you think Ticknett's really keen on me, Elsie!"</p>

<p>Elsie giggled, and kissed her sister.</p>

<p>"You'd have to be blind not to see that," she said; and then she
whispered:</p>

<p>"Are you really keen on him!"</p>

<p>The younger sister continued staring into the fire.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I think I am. I&mdash;Isn't this stew nearly
done!"</p>

<p>Elsie again giggled, and proceeded to dish up the stew. Before
this operation was completed, there was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>Elsie said, "Oh, curse!" and went, and opened it.</p>

<p>In the doorway stood a woman with a small parcel. Her face was
deadly white and her lips colorless. She looked like a woman to
whom everything that could happen had happened long ago, and the
result had left her lifeless and indifferent. She said
listlessly:</p>

<p>"Are you Miss Bultishaw?"</p>

<p>And Elsie said, "Yes."</p>

<p>The woman entered, and looked round the room.</p>

<p>"May I speak to you a moment? Is this your sister?" she
said.</p>

<p>Elsie answered: "Yes; what do you want?"</p>

<p>"I want to make an explanation, and to give you some money."</p>

<p>She untied the packet, and placed some notes on to the
table-cloth.</p>

<p>"What the hell's this?" exclaimed Elsie.</p>

<p>"This is all I could find," muttered the listless woman. "I
found them in his breast-pocket. They belonged to your father. It
wasn't your father at all who&mdash;ought to have paid. <i>He</i>
ought to have paid. So I've taken them from him. I hope there's
enough. I'm afraid there may not be. It's all I have. It's only
right you should have it."</p>

<p>The two sisters stared at her, and involuntarily drew closer
together. It was Dorothy who eventually managed to speak:</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" she said. "Who do you mean by
'him'?"</p>

<p>"Ticknett!"</p>

<p>The sisters gasped, and Dorothy gave a little cry.</p>

<p>"Here! what do you mean?" she said breathlessly. "Have you
pinched this money from Ticknett? You'd better be careful. He's
coming here. We'll have you arrested."</p>

<p>The listless woman shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, no," she said in her toneless voice. "Don't you believe
that. He won't come here."</p>

<p>"Why won't he come here?" rasped Dorothy, with a note of
challenge.</p>

<p>The strange visitor stood staring vacantly at the fire. She
seemed not to have heard. Her lips were trembling. Suddenly she
answered in the same dull, lifeless manner:</p>

<p>"Because he's lying on my bed with a bullet through his
heart."</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. William's Narrow Squeak</h2>

<p>"Confound that Mrs. Buswell!"</p>

<p>Twenty minutes to nine, and she had not either called me or
brought my early cup of tea! During the four years in which I had
held the distinguished position of sub-manager to the Southrepps
Bank in Baker Street&mdash;the youngest sub-manager ever appointed
in the whole record of this famous Southrepps banking association,
sir&mdash;it had always been my proud boast that I had never been
one minute late in the morning, not one minute. Apart from the
eagerness and interest I flatter myself I have always taken in my
work, I consider it a valuable example to the junior clerks. I like
to be at my desk when they arrive, and to grade the quality of my
morning salutation to a precise scale of minutes. Sharp on time and
I say breezily: "Good morning, Mr. So-and-so!" Four minutes late:
"Morning." Five minutes late: a curt nod. Anything between five and
eight minutes: a black scowl. Anything beyond eight minutes: a
peremptory demand for explanation. Punctuality and precision have
always been the most pronounced of my characteristics. To these I
probably owe my success in life.</p>

<p>Now, I occupied a pleasant suite of rooms in a small house in
Motcombe Street. Mrs. Buswell was my landlady. I did my utmost to
inculcate into her the value and importance of these two strong
principles, and in a fair way I succeeded. On the whole I could not
complain of Mrs. Buswell. She knocked on my door every morning at
half-past eight, and set down a cup of tea. I would then rise,
drink the tea, shave, have a bath, dress, and enter my sitting-room
at ten minutes to nine. My breakfast was invariably ready.
Breakfast would occupy fifteen minutes. I would then smoke one
cigarette, glance at the newspaper, put on my boots, and leave the
house at nine-fifteen. I would walk along a quiet street parallel
to the Marylebone Road, and arrive at the bank about three minutes
before half-past nine. At half-past nine&mdash;I say&mdash;I would
be seated at my desk, pen in hand. Our manager, Mr. Woodward, did
not come till ten.</p>

<p>But recently Mrs. Buswell had developed a regrettable lapse. On
Monday she had been three minutes late. On Wednesday, four and a
half. On Thursday, so late that I had to go without marmalade, and
to take a 'bus along the Marylebone Road. I would rather go without
breakfast altogether than be late at the bank. And now on this
Friday morning she was again ten minutes late and there was no
sound of her. I rang the bell and waited, but there was no answer.
I went out on to the landing and called down: "Mrs. Buswell, are
you there?"</p>

<p>I could get no answer to this. The minutes were crowding by. I
was angry. I believe I swore. In any case I hastily donned a
dressing-gown and slippers and explored the basement. There was no
sign of Mrs. Buswell, and the fire was not lighted. Mystery of
mysteries! I went back and consulted my watch. Had it gone wrong?
Was I several hours fast? But no, I am a man peculiarly sensitive
to time. I knew by my sensations that it must be somewhere about
eight-forty-five. Without more ado I went upstairs and knocked on
Mrs. Buswell's bedroom door. Again there was no answer. I knocked
louder. A dread suspicion came to me. Perhaps she had died in the
night, or been murdered?</p>

<p>I boldly opened the door. Mrs. Buswell was not there. The bed
was sketchily made. I could not tell whether it had been slept in
or not. There was no one else in the house. It was all most
provoking. She must have gone out somewhere&mdash;perhaps to get
some bread or milk. Anyway, I could not afford to waste any more
time. I went back to my room, shaved in cold water, had a bath, and
dressed myself. By that time it was seven minutes past nine. Still
no sign of Mrs. Buswell. I went down into the kitchen. I just had
time to make myself a cup of tea, and then, by taking the
Marylebone Road 'bus, I could be at the bank at my usual time. I
filled the kettle, and struck a match to light the gas-stove, and
then I had my second shock. The gas was cut off.</p>

<p>"Now, that's a queer, mysterious thing!" I thought. I had a
cheerless breakfast of bread and butter and cold water. I would
<i>not</i> be late at the bank. I was just preparing to go when I
realized that my boots were not cleaned, and yesterday had been
muddy. I then really did swear at the defaulting landlady. To turn
up at the bank with yesterday's mud on one's boots is an even more
heinous offence than being five minutes late. I fetched my boots
and cleaned them.</p>

<p>In the end I had to run to the corner where the 'buses passed.
Of course, there was not one in sight! I waited several minutes,
fuming with impatience. No 'bus came, neither was there anyone
about.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the world?" I exclaimed, angrily. I
crossed the road and ran down the side street that led to Baker
Street. I ran nearly all the way. I did not pass a soul, but so
consumed was I with my special complexity I hardly noted the fact.
It is in any case a source of pride to me to be able to state that
when I entered the bank it was just one minute to the half-hour. I
was at my desk by half-past, pen in hand. We had at that time only
two junior clerks, Weaks and Burton. (Burton, indeed, was really
only an office boy.) Of course, they were both late. Burton had
been late on several occasions recently and I was in a bad temper.
I had had practically no breakfast in order to be in time, and I
prepared myself to put Master Burton in his place. Five-and-twenty
minutes to ten and neither had arrived. Twenty to, and a deadly
stillness pervaded the bank premises.</p>

<p>I became eerily conscious of a silence that I had never felt in
my life before. There was no sound of traffic outside at all!</p>

<p>"Perhaps there's been a strike," I thought. "And then, of
course, Weaks and Burton would both be unavoidably late."</p>

<p>But I didn't like it at all. I went out to the front door and
looked up and down Baker Street. There were no vehicles at all, no
people, no life of any sort!</p>

<p>An almost unrealizable horror gripped me. I looked up at
windows, peered into basements, and shouted at the top of my voice.
There was no answer, no response. The position was too staggering
to be grasped. Horrors, visions, black misgivings crept through me.
Prophetic utterances, and Biblical quotations.</p>

<p>"And one shall be taken and the other left!"</p>

<p>Had everyone been taken? and I the only other left? I am not an
hysterical man. I have always been sensible, orthodox, and
practical. I am a member of the Church of England, and an upholder
of the Throne and the Unionist party.</p>

<p>I said to myself, firmly: "William, get a grip on yourself!"</p>

<p><br>
I went back to my desk and waited. Perhaps Mr. Woodward would turn
up at ten. He was seldom late. It would be in any case an immense
relief to discuss the amazing phenomenon with someone. Ten o'clock
came, a quarter past, no Mr. Woodward. Then, indeed, I did become
slightly unbalanced. I had a sudden inspiration. The telephone! I
rushed to the instrument, lifted the receiver, and screamed into
it: "Hullo! Hullo! Hullo! Is anyone there?"</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then I distinctly heard a voice say,
weakly:</p>

<p>"Hullo, who is that?"</p>

<p>"It's I, William Mears, of the Southrepps Bank. Who are you, for
God's sake?"</p>

<p>I listened. There was no sound but the drone of the wires. I
waited, and called again and again. The low hum of the wires
continued. Then I thought to myself: "Nevertheless, the telephone
is working. If it is working, someone must be at the
power-station."</p>

<p>Where were the power-stations? I had distinctly heard that voice
at the other end&mdash;a man's.</p>

<p>I sat calmly at my desk, almost afraid to think. Eleven o'clock
came, eleven-fifteen, eleven-thirty. I hope you will place it to my
credit that between eleven-thirty and twelve I quietly continued my
office routine as though nothing were the matter. We were within a
week of our quarterly balances, and there was much to
do&mdash;especially with all the staff away.</p>

<p>Just before twelve, however, I thought to myself:</p>

<p>"What's the good of banking when there is no one to bank?"</p>

<p>I shut up the ledger, put on my hat, and went out, after
carefully locking everything up. The sun was shining, and the
roads, wet from yesterday's downpour, gaily reflected the blue and
white sky. In that strange hour it gave me a curious sense of
comfort to observe light cirrus clouds moving across the sky. Yes,
something was alive then.</p>

<p>I walked up Baker Street. The doors of some of the shops were
open, and I went in. There were neither shopkeepers nor customers.
I could have helped myself to things of untold value. At the corner
of Orchard Street was a newspaper placard. It said: "Latest from
Newmarket." There was no date on the paper. It seemed grimly ironic
to think of horse-racing when Oxford Street was entirely deserted.
There was Messrs. Harridge's vast emporium. One of the doors was
open and I went in. I walked through endless show-rooms, filled
with clothes, books, stationery, silver, plate, glass, all utterly
without value or interest to me. Then I came to a large provision
department, and my interest quickened. I remembered that I was
hungry. There were hundreds of hams, tongues, fowls, quails, and
all kinds of thing in jelly. Without any scruples I devoured two
jolly little quails in aspic and a fruit tart. The wine department
was packed with every conceivable wine, spirit, and liqueur, but I
am a temperate man, and these things did not tempt me. It was,
moreover, very necessary to keep a clear head. I left Messrs.
Harridge's and went farther on down Oxford Street, I was passing
the premises of a rival bank, and I went in. It was all open;
moreover, the safe was unlocked. I could have helped myself to a
bag or two of golden sovereigns and a sack of Treasury notes, but
what is the use of five thousand pounds when you cannot even buy
the sound of a human voice?</p>

<p>Just before reaching Regent Street I had a most emotional
experience. On the roof of a hosier's shop I espied a black cat. It
was mewing piteously. Now, I have never been very fond of cats, but
I suddenly felt an overwhelming desire for the company of this
black friend. I ran into the shop and up the stairs. With great
difficulty I managed to get on to the roof. The cat had
disappeared. What became of it I never knew. I felt terribly
affected by losing this cat. I said to myself:</p>

<p>"William, you are becoming mawkish. You <i>must</i> pull
yourself together."</p>

<p>In Regent Street a cheering sight met my gaze&mdash;a florist's
shop. I hurried in. There were masses of cut roses, lilac,
carnations, and violets. There were plants and dwarf trees in pots.
I examined them all carefully. The cut flowers were in water, the
plants were growing. The general scheme of things began to take
shape in my mind. The world was alive, the sun was in the heavens,
the clouds and the good air were just as usual. There was life
going on of some sort&mdash;flowers, a black cat, a voice on the
telephone. It appeared to be just human life conspicuous by its
absence. I gathered together a large bunch of dark red roses. I
buried my face in them, and clung to them as the only connecting
link with the things that mattered. I took them with me on my
further pilgrimage down West.</p>

<p>Piccadilly Circus was like a neglected dust-heap. Refuse was
scattered here and there. Near the Tube station were holes in the
wooden pavement, as though someone had started to dig it up and
then gone away. I wandered down the Haymarket, across Trafalgar
Square, past Charing Cross, and then to the Embankment. The dear
old river looked just the same as usual, except that there was no
sign of seagulls or pigeons. The little waves were lapping against
the piers of the bridge. The river in any case was another live
thing. It was crowded with barges, lighters, and small merchantmen,
all idle and deserted. I sought avidly for any sign of smoke. There
was none.</p>

<p>I went along the Embankment as far as Westminster, then turned
back past the House of Commons and along to the Green Park. The
Green Park soothed me. It <i>was</i> green, and the trees and
bushes were all in leaf. I knelt on the grass and examined it
closely. Was it actually growing? or had it reached its crisis and
this was the last day of all? I could not tell, but the grass
looked fresh and healthy enough.</p>

<p>By the time I reached Buckingham Palace it was a quarter to two,
and I felt hungry again. I went into the Palace unchallenged. I
wandered about the vast corridors and reception-rooms. At last I
came to the kitchens and larders. I found there a profusion of food
little less imposing than that at Messrs. Harridge's.</p>

<p>"Well, after all," I thought, "why not? His Majesty would hardly
begrudge a meal to his only remaining subject."</p>

<p>I made a fire with wood and coal, and cooked myself a cutlet and
boiled some Brussels sprouts ( I am very fond of sprouts). I placed
the meal on a tray and carried it up to the Throne Room. I sat on
the Throne of England and solemnly consumed my cutlet. I am
probably the only man who has ever eaten a cutlet whilst seated on
a throne. It was not very comfortable, but the irony of the
situation pleased me. Humour has never been considered my strong
point, but I was sensible enough to see that whatever humour I had
must be developed in order to sustain me through my amazing
ordeal.</p>

<p>I kept on pinching myself and saying: "Well, of course, all this
is simply a dream."</p>

<p>Then I would go to the window and look out. But no, I never felt
so vital and awake before in my life. Everything was vivid and
tangible. It had not that nebulous quality which characterized a
dream. Something abnormal and supernatural had happened, and I had
to face it. I had heard of people finding themselves in colourably
similar predicaments&mdash;being lost on a desert island, for
instance&mdash;and I knew that the great thing was to retain one's
sanity.</p>

<p>I had really hardly yet begun to think. I was observing and
taking my bearings. Serious thinking must come later. I must simply
keep sane.</p>

<p>In one of the courtyards of the Palace I came across several
large motor-cars. Another bright inspiration came to me. During the
war I had had the honour of being allowed to drive a V.A.D.
ambulance. I knew quite a bit about cars. I hurried to the first
one, a large touring Daimler. To my intense delight, the
self-starter acted promptly. I released the clutch and the thing
moved. This was perhaps the most satisfactory experience of the
day. With a car I could accomplish a great deal. I raced out into
the Mall. If need be, I could escape to the country, go up North,
or to the coast. There must be life somewhere. Then it occurred to
me that it would be an interesting experiment to go first to the
Zoo. I returned up Regent Street and I could not help grinning when
I realized that I automatically had to toot my horn and slow up at
corners. I was at the Zoo in less than fifteen minutes. Leaving the
car outside I clambered over the turnstiles. My worst apprehensions
were fulfilled. AH the animals had vanished. I ran from house to
house. There was no living thing. By some of the houses the ground
appeared to be scratched up, as though the animals might have
scratched their way out and escaped. Here and there I came across
bleached bones and skulls. I believe I could have made a life-long
friend of a sea-lion if only the thing had been there. Once I
thought I saw a mouse scamper across a jackal's cage, but I could
not be certain.</p>

<p>I gave up the Zoo and returned to my car. What should I do?
After mature reflection I decided to give up going into the country
till the morrow. I would thoroughly explore London first. After all
there seemed more probability of meeting people, or finding some
solution here rather than among the fields and commons. I went
round Regent's Park to the Finchley Road&mdash;and then on to
Hampstead, keeping my eyes skinned all the time for any appearance
of life. I went all through Hampstead and Highgate, and then
through Camden Town, Islington and Highbury. I made my way back to
the City and the East-end. I went to St. Paul's Cathedral, and
entered it questioningly. The great temple of the people gave me
back no answer.</p>

<p>I crawled slowly down Cheapside and Fleet Street. My eyes were
constantly intrigued by advertisements. "So-and-so's Soap."
"Broadstairs is so Bracing." "A readymade suit for seventy
shillings." "Give her Bovril." "George Robey to-night at the
Coliseum."</p>

<p>I <i>must</i> keep sane.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon I went back to the bank. Nothing had
changed. I tried the telephone again, but this time I did not even
hear the hum of the wires. I was feeling physically exhausted and
mentally overwrought by the day's experience. Where should I spend
the night? I had the choice of Buckingham Palace, the Savoy or
Carlton, or my own bed. I quickly decided in favour of the latter.
But first of all I must have another good meal. It surprised me
that in this respect I felt well and eager for good things. I
eventually went down to the Carlton, and once more routed out the
kitchens. I venture to say that I prepared myself a meal that the
chef himself would not have been too contemptuous of.</p>

<p>After my dinner I lay back in the lounge in the Carlton and
reflected. (I almost wished I had worn evening dress I) It was
certainly a situation which demanded profound reflection.</p>

<p>"One shall be taken and the other left."</p>

<p>Assuming that there had been some cataclysmic spiritual
manifestation, why should all the others be taken and I left? I
carefully reviewed the record of my past life. I could
conscientiously say that I had little to reproach myself with. I
had always been scrupulously honest, industrious, and sincere. I
had been a regular and devout communicant at St. Mary's Church,
Marylebone. I had no recollection of ever having done a
contemptible or mean action. I may on occasions have been a little
quicktempered, a little uncharitable to my subordinates, but surely
not sufficiently so to arouse the wrath of God.</p>

<p>But what was the position? What was God's idea? I found myself
alone, and in charge not only of the South-repps Bank in Baker
Street, but of the whole of London. I was King, Prime Minister, and
proprietor. I could go and draw out a hundred million pounds in
cash to-morrow and drive away&mdash;whither?</p>

<p>But more practical details began to impress themselves. At the
present moment London was full of fresh food, fruit, and
vegetables. On the other hand, there was no electric light or gas.
There was no one to attend to the water or the drainage, or to
scavenging in general. The streets were already untidy. In a few
days all the food would go bad. In a week's time the whole place
would be pestilentially insanitary. No, it was obviously the wisest
course to clear out. It would be best to find a small house by
itself somewhere in the country or near the sea, a house with a
well, perhaps. I could take with me stores of tinned food,
sufficient to last for years; and then I could grow vegetables and
fruit. I would go to one of the libraries and get books on this
subject. The sea was the most attractive proposition. Perhaps some
foreign ship would come along. Were all countries and cities like
this? Possibly not. And yet, there was no suggestion of a local
annihilation, no suspicion of poison-gas or plague. In this case
there would be the gruesome evidence of dead bodies. Everyone had
just vanished. I was entirely alone. And yet&mdash;what was that
voice on the telephone?</p>

<p>The evening was drawing on. I left the Carlton, drove up the
Haymarket in my car, called at a stores, and commandeered several
boxes of candles. I could see that another difficulty was going to
be bread. I must store quantities of flour, and read up from books
how to make bread. In the meantime, there were plenty of dry
unsweetened biscuits in tins. I filled up my car&mdash;or rather,
His Majesty's car&mdash;with all the edibles for my immediate use,
and then drove back to my rooms in Motcombe Street.</p>

<p>I was thoroughly worn out, but I found the sight of my small
familiar properties comforting. I smoked and reflected for another
hour, and then I went to bed. Having persuaded myself that I could
do nothing but trust to God and my good conscience, I soon fell
into a profound sleep.</p>

<p>I don't know how long I had been sleeping when I was disturbed
by a disconcerting noise. I awakened with a start, and listened.
When I realized what it was I could extract little comfort from a
sound which, although unusual in the room I occupied, was quite
familiar as a human experience.</p>

<p>It was the sound of a mouse or rat nibbling in the wainscoting
in a corner of the room. Now, it had always been a boast of Mrs.
Buswell's that her house was free from vermin of any sort, and I
knew that this was no idle boast. I threw a boot into the corner,
and the sound ceased. In five minutes' time, however, it started
again. When one's nerves are already a little on edge, there is
nothing so disconcerting in the stillness of the night as this
restless gnaw, gnaw, with the uncertainty of the progress and exact
location of the rodent. I lighted a candle and banged on the floor
again. Again there was a pause, but only of the briefest duration.
I left the candle burning, and so tired was I that after a time I
did fall asleep. It must have been several hours later when I awoke
with an involuntary start, warned by some foreboding movement of
the quilt. I opened my eyes in time to see a large brown rat
scuttle from the bed and dart out of sight. My heart beat violently
with pure dread.</p>

<p>Now, in nearly all living creatures there is some element of
companionableness, but in the rat&mdash;no! It is surely the most
sinister figure, next to the snake, in all organic life. I yearned
for living contact, but with the rat&mdash;oh, dear, no! I leapt
out of bed. The candle was guttering in its socket, and I quickly
lighted another. I shouted and hit the floor with my boots. There
was no sign of the rat. However, I found the hole through which he
had come, and I feverishly stuffed it up with a towel dipped in
paraffin. But I knew I should not sleep again that night. I lighted
more candles. I opened my bedroom door an inch or two, and I could
not be certain, but I fancied I heard scuttling and scuffling on
the linoleum of the passage. I shut the door quickly and spread
another towel along the bottom of it.</p>

<p>That decided me. First thing in the morning I would load up my
car and leave London. It was just what one might have expected.
Directly humanity departed, these awful things would come into
their own. In a few days London would probably be overrun with
rats. I took down a book and read until daylight filtered between
the window curtains.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light enough I arose. I went first to see if
my good car was outside. I don't know what I thought could have
happened to it, but in this crumbling world I realized that the
Daimler was the only friend I had. The sight of it in the road
beneath almost brought a lump into my throat. When I had
breakfasted I made a list of the things I must not forget to take
with me, not forgetting petrol and clothes. There would be a
certain pleasant satisfaction in rummaging in the big stores,
helping myself to a fur overcoat worth a thousand pounds, and
choosing the finest linen and wool. Then I would have a clock, and
a diary, for I decided during the night that, whatever the future
held in store for me, I would accept philosophically. Within my
capacity I would lead a normal life. I would shave and dress
meticulously, as befitted the sub-manager of the Southrepps Bank.
And I would set everything down and keep a record, so that if there
were some ultimate solution of this crazy problem I should be in a
stronger position to deal with it. Moreover, an ordered and
disciplined life would keep me sane.</p>

<p>I made out my list, collected a few household goods, and went
out to the car. I put the things in the car, and was just about to
board it when an appalling sight met my gaze. I could do nothing
but walk round the car and mutter, "My God!"</p>

<p><i>All the four tyres had been gnawed to ribbons!</i>
</p>

<p>I thought of my unpleasant visitor of the night and a cold
horror gripped my heart. It was not that there was anything very
surprising in a rat gnawing through a motor-tyre, but there was a
suggestion of deliberation about this. The tyres had not been
eaten. They were just ripped to pieces as though for a purpose.</p>

<p>I had to admonish myself roundly for giving way to an explosion
of despair.</p>

<p>"All right, William, don't lose your hair. There are plenty of
other cars in London. You saw hundreds yesterday."</p>

<p>I remembered that there were three taxi-cabs on the rank in the
Marylebone Road. Without hesitating a second I ran down the street
and turned the corner. There was no need for me to cross the road.
The three cabs were resting on their iron rims, the tyres all flat
and torn!</p>

<p>"Steady! Steady!" I thought. "There must be some locked up in
garages that the rats wouldn't have been able to get at."</p>

<p>I walked towards the wealthy residential quarters of Portland
Place and Harley Street. Some of the garages were locked up, and I
had to batter down the doors with iron bars or anything I could
find. It was a pilgrimage ol despair. I spent the whole morning
wandering from street to street, from garage to garage. I inspected
hundreds of cars, but not one had a tyre intact.</p>

<p>I lunched at the Carlton again, and attempted to formulate a new
plan. Of course, there was nothing to prevent me walking out of
London, but how was I to carry all my kit? I might get a barrow and
load that up, but it would be an arduous journey, and owing to the
sedentary life I had always led I was not very strong, and not a
very good walker. London is by no means an easy place to walk out
of. It would mean at least a ten or twelve-mile walk, pushing a
heavy barrow. But there seemed no alternative. I could not spend
another night in this awful city, alone amongst the loathsome
creatures.</p>

<p>It took me nearly two hours to find a barrow, which I eventually
did in Co vent Garden Market. I trundled it up the deserted streets
to Messrs. Harridge's. But on my wanderings in search of the barrow
I made another significant discovery. You may remember that on the
previous day the wooden pavement outside Piccadilly Tube Station
gave me the impression that someone had begun to dig it up and had
then neglected it. I now discovered that this was something very
different. It was a warren of small holes leading into the earth.
The same condition prevailed on the Haymarket side of the Tube, and
also at Leicester Square and Oxford Circus.</p>

<p>After making this discovery I went tentatively into Piccadilly
Tube Station, and went a little way down the spiral staircase till
it was too dark to see. A horrible odour assailed my nostrils, and
I hastily retreated. So that was it! It required no special
astuteness to envisage that vast warren and storehouse beneath,
with arteries connecting with the whole underworld of London. I
thought of the many evenings I had travelled in the Tubes about
theatre time, the gay lighting, pretty women in opera cloaks and
jolly youngsters out for an evening's fun, and then with a shudder
I thought of it now committed to eternal darkness and foulness,
controlled, moreover, by a mysterious cunning and sense of order.
The thought was unbearable.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Harridge's with my barrow I was trembling all
over. I wandered over the premises with my list, and chose the
things I wanted. It took much longer than I had anticipated, and in
the course of it I was subjected to further ominous misgivings. For
one thing, whereas on the previous day there had been scores of
boxes of candles, to-day there was not one in the building. Neither
were there any cheeses, lard, or butter. In the provision
department some hams which I had suspected of being slightly
tainted had disappeared. The fresh food remained untouched. Every
room, every floor and partition was honeycombed with holes.
Harridge's was being carefully watched.</p>

<p>This experience made me all the more anxious to get away from
London.</p>

<p>The barrow was very heavy when I had loaded it up, and I still
had to go back to Motcombe Street to collect the things I had left
in the car. As it was getting late I decided that I would only go
as far as Richmond that night. I would sleep there, and then push
on into Surrey the next day.</p>

<p>I tried at several other places to get candles, but they had all
disappeared.</p>

<p>By the time I had had a meal and was ready to start it was
sundown. I hesitated as to whether I would try and endure one more
night in my Motcombe Street rooms, but my first resolution was
fortified by the discovery that all the candles I had taken home
the previous day had also disappeared. I could have a fire, but
otherwise the evening would have to be spent in darkness.</p>

<p>I added the final touches to my strange outfit and started off
down the Marylebone Road. I decided to walk to Hammersmith, go
across Barnes Bridge, and so on to Richmond that way. I reckoned on
a good two hours' walk. But in doing so I had not allowed for
inevitable rests. For the first few hundred yards the barrow load
did not seem unduly heavy, but by the time I had reached Hyde Park
I felt as though I were pushing a railway truck laden with coal. I
was panting and puffing, and my hands were chafed and my back
ached. I took a good rest and started again. All along the side of
the Park as far as Notting Hill I had to rest every dozen yards or
so. When I reached Shepherd's Bush I felt doubtful whether I could
proceed. I was quite done up, and it was already getting dark. I
rested disconsolately on the edge of the barrow. Whilst doing so,
my eye caught sight of a rather gaudy public-house. I had never in
my life entered one of these places, but it flashed through my mind
that here was an occasion when the most fastidious could hardly
grieve at my defection. I entered the saloon bar. There was no lack
of every conceivable alcoholic refreshment, I drank a wineglassful
of neat brandy, and added the bottle to my effects. At the same
time I discarded some of my tinned food in order to lighten the
load. The effect of the brandy temporarily ameliorated the outlook,
but I was very weary and feverishly anxious to get on. I had an
impatient desire to get to the other side of the river. I felt I
would rather sleep in the open in Richmond Park, or on Barnes
Common, than endure another night in any of these unlighted and
cheerless houses. Moreover, I tried several times to dissuade
myself from accepting a conscious realization&mdash;things already
moving and scurrying in the fringes of the coming darkness!</p>

<p>As I struggled on painfully towards Plammersmith Broadway I
became gradually obsessed by a terrifying conviction. <i>I was
being watched!</i> A dark power was encircling me, and when the
moment came, I&mdash;I could not tell what would happen, but I knew
that I should no longer be master of my fate. I kept to the middle
of the road and prayed for strength. Just past the Broadway a swarm
of black objects swung in a body across my barrow from left to
right. A minute later another swarm swung across from right to
left. I looked back, and I became aware of a vast semi-circle of
black movement following me.</p>

<p>Before I had reached Barnes Bridge, I knew that I could not go
on. In any case, I could not go on with my load. I would discard my
barrow and run for it, chancing to find on the other side of the
river the necessities I needed. Perhaps on the morrow I could
return and reclaim my property in daylight. I left the barrow and
strode forward swinging a stick. It was less than a hundred yards
to the bridge, but before I had reached it I knew that I was
defeated. A pale moon was up and I could see sufficient. It was not
so much numbers that paralysed my will to go on, as the sense that
at the back of them was an ordered plan, a sinister intelligence.
I'm afraid I gave way to a moment of self-pity. I saw myself, the
conscientious and scrupulous sub-manager of the Southrepps Bank, a
pitiable figure, struggling to do his duty, and to behave as became
a Christian gentleman, and then&mdash;hemmed in and mastered by a
dark, unjust fate.</p>

<p>As I stood by the bridge, uncertain how to act, I was suddenly
startled by a new amazement. Creeping along the near bank was a
small tramp steamer or freighter. It was moving. There was smoke
coming out of the funnel. I could almost swear that I could see the
figure of a man at the wheel. Then, as I peered more eagerly, I was
certain that, though there might be a man at the wheel, the deck of
the steamer was swarming with that same dark restless movement. At
the top of my voice I yelled out:</p>

<p>"Hullo! Hullo! there! Who's that? Land, I say, for God's
sake!"</p>

<p>The steamer crept under the bridge and appeared the other side.
I rushed to it and screamed out again:</p>

<p>"Hullo! Hullo! I say. Is that a man? For God's sake, land!"</p>

<p>I waited. There was a noise of squeaking and the rushing of
water. As the steamer began to crawl out of sight, I could swear I
heard a husky answer:</p>

<p>"I can't. They won't let me!"</p>

<p>I groaned and cried out again, but no further answer came
back.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, was I becoming desperate. Why did the creatures
not attack me and make an end? I was utterly at their mercy. For a
moment I hesitated whether I would not rush on to the Bridge and
throw myself into the river, but the idea of suicide has always
appeared to me to be of all crimes, next to murder, the most
irreligious. No, I would fight to the end.</p>

<p>I walked back to my barrow, my consciousness almost numbed into
indifference. So absorbed was I with my spiritual tribulations that
I hardly heeded the movements of my black masters. I stood by the
barrow hesitating, and then the strangest thing of all happened. I
became aware of concentric movements, of swerves and formations,
like an army at manoeuvres.</p>

<p>"Now," I thought, "it's coming. Well, let it be
quick&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was in the middle of the road, and I could see fairly well. I
waited patiently, stick in hand. The manoeuvres seemed suddenly to
a stop, as though the Generalissimo had achieved a perfect
formation. Then two bodies detached themselves and took up
positions on either side of me. I could even see their leaders
gleaming menacingly on the flanks. And then a third smaller body
approached between them. It was apparently conveying a large dark
object. The whole cavalcade appeared to be closing in on me, and
then it suddenly retreated, leaving the dark object at my feet.</p>

<p>I peered down. It was a large brown rat, a very prince of rats,
an enormous fellow. He was wounded in the right leg, whether
through fighting or through falling on a sharp object I could not
say. The command was obvious. I was being watched by ten thousand
specks of light.</p>

<p><br>
I praised God for the thoroughness of my preparations before
leaving Harridge's. I had a first-aid outfit, and during the war I
had picked up a little knowledge of the valuable craft. I took the
things from the barrow, being careful to show no signs of hurry or
suspicion. Then I knelt down and bathed the wound, which was
bleeding, applied some antiseptic, and bound it up with a clean
bandage. I did it as well as I possibly could. The brown rat never
stirred. As a brilliant afterthought I smeared a little brandy over
his nose. I could not be sure how this would affect him, but I
thought the experiment might be worth while. Then I drew apart and
waited, to show that the operation was over. Followed a lot of
squeaking and whispering, the movement of further formations, and
the removal of the invalid. Nonchalantly I strolled off down the
street back to Hammersmith. I went unmolested, nevertheless, the
sense of depression became accentuated. Before I was in open
warfare; now I felt that I was a slave. If I was useful to them
they would neither kill me nor let me go.</p>

<p>Strolling back towards Kensington the truth of the whole
situation began to dawn on me. The voice on the telephone, the
black cat, the man on the steamer, myself&mdash;Humanity was not
defunct. It had simply been superseded. The earth was now dominated
by the rat. Man was a subsidiary and servile creature. A few human
beings would be allowed to live, provided they served some useful
purpose in the rodentary scheme of things.</p>

<p>In Kensington I found a large private hotel. I was tired, dazed,
and beaten. I stumbled in and found my way to a room on the top
floor. I struck matches, and satisfied myself that there were no
holes in the floor or walls. Then I threw myself on to the bed and
fell into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>It was, of course, only to wake later to the abrupt irritation
of that gnaw, gnaw, gnaw in the skirting.</p>

<p>"I shall go mad!" I whispered. Then:</p>

<p>"William, if ever there was a time to pull yourself together it
is now. What is to prevent you walking out of London to-morrow
morning? They don't come out in daylight. Get right away into the
clean, sweet air of the country, and leave everything. Better to
die of starvation or exposure than endure this. Besides, who knows
but that you may find a colony of humans somewhere?"</p>

<p>The gnawing went on, but I slept by fits and starts. My fears
were somehow less directly personal. I felt that my services to the
old brown rat would in some way secure me from immediate attack.
Once during the night I know that a rat scuttled across the bed. I
had no candles, and I was too weary to protest. What would be the
good? If I went to another room they would quickly make their way
thither. I tried to visualize London a hundred years hence, a
mouldy ruin entirely perforated, like an old leaf that has been
pressed between the leaves of a book and forgotten. It seemed
surprising that it was less than forty-eight hours ago that I had
been in this metamorphosed existence, and it already held me in an
ice-cold grip of fatality. If I could consider the matter logically
and dispassionately I might be able to persuade myself that I was
despairing too rapidly, surrendering too easily. But I was
enveloped by an atmosphere in which logic seemed to have no place,
reason no throne. A few days and nights of this and I should be an
old man.</p>

<p>The dawn at last. I rose hastily and began to dress. I had not
completed my toilette before I was confronted with a new disaster.
<i>The soles of my boots had been eaten!</i> There was again in
this the menace of deliberate purpose. There could have been no
reason to have eaten my boots for the nourishment they contained.
London was chock-full of food. I wandered over the hotel. I found
five pairs of gentlemen's boots. In each case the soles had been
destroyed. On the other hand, I found seven pairs of ladies' shoes.
They were untouched. Why?</p>

<p>So soon as I had consumed a hasty meal I hurried out into the
street in my socks. After a brief search I found a bootmaker's
shop. One glance satisfied me. All the boxes had been pulled down
and eaten into, and the soles of the boots destroyed. Even some
ladies' boots of the larger kind were destroyed; but there were
plenty of the latter with Louis heels and useless pointed toes. The
thing was diabolic. Could I walk out of London in my socks? In any
case I would try. It was my only hope. I bound my feet up in thick
bandages, after covering them with vaseline. On the top of this I
wore two pairs of thick socks.</p>

<p>This time I would go North, where there was no river to cross. I
made up a small parcel of food and a change of clothing, and set
forth. I will not distress you with a description of that journey.
It was a dull record of pain, weariness, and mental anguish. I lost
all sense of time or space. Sometimes I would rest on a doorstep
and nibble at my food. A curious conviction came over me that I was
instinctively imitating the rats' method of eating. It was again
nearly dark before I found that the houses were getting more widely
separated, and there were occasional lapses of fields and open
spaces. Even then&mdash;there would be many miles to go before I
was clear of it all.</p>

<p>I had nearly reached the end of my tether, and was passing a
red-brick wall that might have been the outside wall of some
institution, when suddenly I thought I heard the sound of a cry on
the other side of the wall&mdash;a human cry! With a superhuman
effort I leapt at the wall and scrambled to the top. Just on the
other side I beheld a woman. She was kneeling down and collecting
something from the ground. In the most futile and inane fashion I
called out:</p>

<p>"Hullo! Good-evening!"</p>

<p>She turned her face to me. It was the saddest face I have ever
seen. At the sight of me it expressed neither relief nor pleasure.
It simply looked utterly hopeless and scared. I said:</p>

<p>"Who are you? Will you come with me? Let us escape&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked round with a terrified glance, and muttered:</p>

<p>"No, no, no."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"They won't let me."</p>

<p>"Who won't?"</p>

<p>"The Masters."</p>

<p>And then with a groan she ran across the courtyard, and darted
through a gate which she slammed after her.</p>

<p><br>
Then I knew that all was finished. I was a creature in revolt. I
gripped my stick. I would not avoid rats any longer. I would seek
them out. I would attack, and die fighting for what I
represented.</p>

<p>I stumbled on to the next house I came to, a bleak buff-brick
villa. I stamped into the hall and cried out:</p>

<p>"Come on, you devils!"</p>

<p>A new strength seemed to enter my limbs. I went into a dark room
and struck at the floor and walls with my stick. But as the
strength came so it oozed away. Something unaccountable was
happening to me. I fell on to a couch and groaned. I seemed to be
rushing through space, through a noisy channel. At the other end
sounds detached themselves. I distinctly heard a voice say:</p>

<p>"Hullo, old man, that's better!"</p>

<p>There was an interval, and then the same voice said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, William, old man, you're all right now, eh? You
understand? You're all right."</p>

<p>The voice was strikingly familiar. Tom&mdash;of course, Tom
Stokes. What was he doing in this God-forsaken place? What place?
Where was I?</p>

<p>"You remember it all now, old man, don't you? We were having a
jolly talk about Bernard Shaw and Dean Inge&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dean Inge! The gloomy Dean, they called him. Something shaped
and cleared. I remembered a lot of things.</p>

<p>"I'll never forgive myself, old man. We were talking&mdash;a
jolly talk about what could happen to humanity. You leant over the
fireplace, knocking out your pipe. I reached up to get a spill,
and, like the clumsy ass I am, I knocked that big vase right over.
It fell on to your head. They've had to put in a couple of
stitches. You're all right now, old man, eh?"</p>

<p>More familiar than Tom's voice&mdash;the cosy security of my own
room. More dear to me than Tom's face&mdash;the eyes of my wife
welcoming me back. Queer, that all that part of my life had been
forgotten, that I should have jumped back to the time when I was a
sub-manager at a small bank. Queer&mdash;</p>

<p>"What could happen to humanity? The gloomy Dean, the gloomy
Dean. Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yes, I remembered it all.</p>

<p>Thank God!</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. When the Earth Stopped</h2>

<p>You may remember that the summer of 1938 was an exceptionally
hot one. Anti-cyclones over the eastern Atlantic caused a series of
heat waves in northern and western Europe. These conditions began
in early June, and they prevailed with only the briefest
interruptions right up to the third week in September. People had
never known such a hot summer.</p>

<p>One afternoon during the beginning of the first heat wave in
June, Lena Trevanna peeped beneath the sunblind and looked down on
to the marble terrace of her husbands palatial mansion at
Twickenham. The white marble seemed to be dancing and quivering in
the sun. Projecting from beneath the awning of an extending deck
chair she could see her husband's white buckskin boots, and the
sight filled her with bitterness. One might ask whether her
husband's boots were a special source of irritation to Lena. It is
difficult to say. Certainly, the right boot had once kicked her
during a paroxysm of the owner's anger. But it is doubtful whether
she hated his feet more than any of the rest of him. She had no
desire to see his face at that moment. She was all too familiar
with that heavy, puffy jowl, the bald head fringed with white hair,
the moist protruding eyes, the bristly tooth-brush moustache, the
overhanging eyelids, and the small dark eyes that missed nothing
and flashed alternately with anger and cunning.</p>

<p>She hated him, and she hated that miniature city, the roofs of
which she could just see on the other side of the park. They called
it Trevanna City. It comprised several square miles of studios,
workshops, and buildings of plaster and canvas, film factories, and
solid houses where lived actors and producers, and operators, and
all the rag-tag and bob-tail of that profession she had learned to
hate.</p>

<p>And Lena had not always hated it. When a very young girl it had
been the ambition of her life to be a filmstar. She had studied and
struggled and failed. She knew she was not beautiful. She was short
and dark and ill-proportioned. But she had something&mdash;she
believed she had the ability to portray emotion. For three years
she had withstood the buffets of the cinema world. No one gave her
the least encouragement. She became despondent and bitter. And then
one day she had met the great Julius Trevanna. Even at that
time&mdash;fifteen years ago&mdash;he was a big man in the film
world. And now?&mdash;was it not a notorious fact that he was the
central pivot of a virtual combine, the combine of all British and
Colonial film interests? Millions: millions; he had piled them up
as other men pile up shillings. And the millions brought no
satisfaction to Lena. She was nominally the mistress of the house.
In effect she was less than a servant. She was a servant without
the power to give notice. She was a slave, a chattle. She wandered
through the great corridors and galleries, and was
alone&mdash;utterly alone.</p>

<p>Some strange, almost perverse desire must have assailed Julius
when they first met. She was conscious of him observing her
sleepily and tugging at his little moustache as though considering
a problem. She disliked him instantly. He was physically repellent
to her. And then one day he had come and stroked her hair and
said:</p>

<p>"You're a nice little girl, eh?"</p>

<p>She did not know what to do. There suddenly flashed through her
mind two visions. One of Lena Baynes&mdash;unsuccessful, unknown,
penniless, getting old. The other of Lena Trevanna, rich,
successful, the greatest film star in the world. If she married him
he would be bound to give her leading parts. She had hesitated and
dallied. Julius was a masterful man. He had not given her
opportunities for long consideration. Money was no object in any of
his undertakings. And so one April day she found herself his wife.
For a few months there was a semblance of some kind of happiness in
their married life, and then came the rift. She almost at once
discovered that he was vicious, egotistical, and tyrannical. He
tired of her, but he would not let her go. When she suggested
herself in leading parts, he said:</p>

<p>"'Um, yes. Well, we shall see. Better begin at the bottom and
climb."</p>

<p>He gave her small parts and quickly showed he thought nothing of
her ability. One day she overheard him tell a producer that he
needn't bother about her because "she was a perfect fool." That was
the beginning. They quarrelled, and henceforth their lives were
lived apart. They shared the great palace and hardly ever exchanged
a word. He clothed her and fed her, but only made her a small
allowance. He ordered her about and bullied her. Sometimes he even
struck her. For fifteen years she had endured this life, hesitating
between numerous alternatives. What could she do? If she left him,
she would again have to face the struggle and the disgrace. She had
become quite convinced at last that she really had no ability as an
actress. And she was getting older. No wonder she began to hate
this unreal world. Everything was unreal and unconvincing.
Emotions, murders, and marriages and robberies were always being
enacted right under her nose. The house itself was frequently in
use, and she arrived at the condition of being unable to
differentiate between reality and posture. Every vision might be a
chimaera. The wljole countryside was unreal&mdash;film mad.</p>

<p>On this afternoon as she gazed on to the terrace, she sighed for
the days of her youth, when everything was vital and real. The sun
was apparently too hot for Julius. She saw him pull his hat over
his eyes and stroll into the house. At the same time she observed a
large aeroplane gliding downwards beyond the trees. After hovering
for a few seconds, it alighted on the landing stage across the
park. A small detachable motor-car appeared to be released from the
framework and in a few minutes was racing up the drive towards the
house.</p>

<p>"It's someone coming to see Julius," she thought.</p>

<p>In her enervated and bored mood she felt a sudden desire to see
who this stranger might be. Anything was better than eating her
heart out. She found her husband in the Louis XV. salon, still
smoking the cigar and glancing at a tape machine. She did not
address him. She went and perched herself in the window-seat.
Apparently he did not observe her. She pretended to be reading. In
a few minutes' time a butler entered with a card on a lacquer tray.
He handed it to Julius, who examined it.</p>

<p>"Good God!"</p>

<p>The importance of the message appeared to be so profound that he
swung round as though he could not restrain his excitement. He must
communicate it to someone. He observed Lena and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Mark Ulrich! Good God! Mark Ulrich himself! The biggest man in
the film world of the whole of America! What the devil does
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>Apparently feeling that he was being too familiar and
communicative, he turned once more to the butler and said:</p>

<p>"Show Mr. Ulrich in."</p>

<p>The room was flooded with a mellow light diffused by the skilful
arrangement of sunblinds. She lay shivering in her corner,
watchfully alert. The butler retired and re-entered, followed by
the visitor. There was little about the first impression of Mr.
Mark Ulrich to denote the biggest man in the cinema world. His
physique was insignificant, his face was grey and drawn, his
clothes dowdy. It was only when he advanced and held out his hands
that she observed the quiet power behind the eyes, the steady jaw,
the complete sense of assurance which only masterful men
possess.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trevanna?" he muttered, and smiled kindly.</p>

<p>Julius was obviously deeply affected, excited and a shade
suspicious. What had the American Film King come to him for? He
spoke as casually as he could:</p>

<p>"I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. Ulrich&mdash;a great honour.
Won't you sit down?"</p>

<p>The American perched himself on the corner of a Chesterfield,
and passed his hand over his brow.</p>

<p>"I have been most anxious to meet you, Mr. Trevanna. I am a bad
traveller. I preferred the old days when we used to come by sea.
Even now I insist upon the dirigible. They are slow but
comfortable. I must have my bath. It is two and a half days since I
left my home in Connecticut to come and visit you."</p>

<p>Julius raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Do I understand that you have come over specially to see
me?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich smiled.</p>

<p>"Why not? Yes, indeed. I have a matter I want to discuss with
you, if you can spare me the time."</p>

<p>"Why, of course, I have nothing urgent this afternoon or
to-night. May I put you up for a day or two?"</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you. I must return to America to-night,
however. But if you think well of my idea I shall return again in a
few days' time."</p>

<p>"Well, well, now. Make yourself at home. Have a cigar."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I do not smoke. If you can really spare me the time,
I will begin to lay my plans before you at once."</p>

<p>He coughed and looked round the room, and his eye alighted on
Lena. He gave a little exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>Julius, who had quite forgotten her, turned in her direction. He
barked out:</p>

<p>"My wife!"</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich immediately walked across the room and held out his
hand to her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Trevanna," he said, "I am delighted to make your
acquaintance."</p>

<p>The unaccustomed social attention quite unnerved Lena. She could
only gasp: "Thank you...Thank you."</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich looked slightly puzzled. He glanced from one to the
other and then resumed his seat. Julius appeared to hesitate
whether to order his wife out of the room, but apparently decided
that her presence made no difference one way or the other. The only
sound was the ticking of the tape machine. Mr. Ulrich leant forward
on his knees, and as he spoke a tinge of colour enlivened his
countenance:</p>

<p>"What I am about to propose to you may cause you considerable
surprise, and I shall not ask you to come to any decision in the
matter till my return from America. The idea has come to me slowly.
It is the outcome of the growth of my experience&mdash;many, many
long years in the film world. I think it began to take shape at the
time when the Chinese, and indeed all the Eastern people, began to
be absorbed by the fascination of moving picture work. Now, as you
know, Mr. Trevanna, the cinema industry is the first industry in
the world. It represents a larger flotation of capital, it employs
more people, and pays greater dividends than any other two
industries in the world put together. You and I, and perhaps a few
others, hardly realise the power that is in our hands."</p>

<p>Julius looked up at him quickly.</p>

<p>"Is your idea&mdash;an international combine?"</p>

<p>"In a sense&mdash;yes. But my idea is more comprehensive than
that. I am of opinion that what the famous League of Nations failed
to accomplish, the Universal Film Trust could accomplish quite
easily."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't see&mdash;the League of Nations! What have
we to do with politics?"</p>

<p>"We might have everything to do with politics. If we could live
up to the ideal which should inspire all parties to the agreement,
we could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What could we do?"</p>

<p>"We could stop the earth!"</p>

<p>"What the devil!"</p>

<p>"I do not mean that human life or activities would be stopped.
On the contrary, they would be helped, and encouraged, and
elevated. What I mean is that history could be stopped. There would
be armies, but they would be armies in fustian. We could fight
again the battle of the Marne, the battle of Poitiers, the battle
of Marathon, but there would never again be bloodshed. There would
be nations retaining their national characteristics but as nations
they would have no claws or talons. There would be Governments, but
they would be tools in our hands. We should enter the age of
retrospection. We would wind up the history of the world. We would
set it down, and reproduce it on the screens. All men would work
simply and reverently for the good of mankind. Agriculture and
manufacture and all arts and industries would still go on, of
course, but there would be no international politics. With the
power that we represent we could check any movement of political
aggression. We could stop the production of all armaments except
those made of wood and canvas."</p>

<p>"You must be mad!"</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich smiled gently, and raised his hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trevanna," he continued, "I need perhaps hardly point out
to you that my life and work have not all been the outcome of a
visionary existence. Many people consider me a hard, material man.
Even my numerous benefactions have been ascribed as 'good
business.' I may mention that, in spite of your unique position in
the British film world, you are not the first man I have
approached. I only crave your sympathetic consideration. As I say,
I do not expect you to give your decision until I return from
America."</p>

<p>Julius sucked the stump of his cigar, which had gone out.</p>

<p>"Might I ask&mdash;who else have you approached?"</p>

<p>"Ah Sing Fu."</p>

<p>"Ah Sing Fu!"</p>

<p>Lena observed her husband start and shrink back into the easy
chair. Mr. Ulrich twisted his fingers around his bony knees and
swayed backward and forwards.</p>

<p>"The world has yet to comprehend the Chinese. The Chinese are
the most numerous, the most intelligent, the most immovable race on
this earth. It may almost be said that they wound up their history
some time ago. They have begun to find out how to live. I have
spent many happy hours in the society of Ah Sing Fu. He is a
philosopher, an idealist, and an extremely able and practical man.
As you know, he is the presiding genius of that wonderful group of
Eastern film activities which have only come into force during the
last fifteen years. It embraces the whole of China and Eastern
Siberia and part of Japan. It has its ramifications throughout
India and the Malay Archipelago. It is a bigger corporation than
either yours or ours. Ah Sing Fu and I are the only people at
present who have discussed this idea. I now come to you. Within the
course of a few weeks trusted agents of ours will be active
throughout Europe and Africa and that part of Asia not yet
influenced by Ah Sing Fu."</p>

<p>"But what does it all amount to? How do you propose to go to
work?"</p>

<p>"The nations of the world, Mr. Trevanna, are still living on
paper credit as a result of the great war. They are, indeed, a lot
of bankrupts. They can dress well and dine well and stuff the bills
away into a drawer. They are just gambling on. Their very existence
depends on the goodwill and good sense of men controlling the
largest blocks of actual assets. We film industries are conducted
on a cash basis. We represent the biggest, solidest control of
capital in the world. Nothing can stand against it!"</p>

<p>"Then we could shove the prices up."</p>

<p>"We could, but that is not the idea of either Ah Sing Fu or
myself. Our idea is simply a moral one. On the contrary, we think
the charges should be reduced, the standard of production raised;
the ego could be turned inwards to absorb the moral of the past
and, through it, to determine the way to live."</p>

<p>The eyes of Julius were starting out of his head. He was
obviously convinced that he was in the presence of a lunatic, a
dangerous lunatic, and yet a person for whom he had a profound
respect. He had chafed his fingers once badly pulling the strings
against this very man. And Ah Sing Fu was a genius; the whole film
world acclaimed it.</p>

<p>He was uncomfortable and disturbed, and suspicious. Why couldn't
they leave him alone comfortably piling up his millions. Who cared
or believed in the "uplifting of humanity?" At the same time, if he
opposed them, what might they not do? His fortune was great, but
his commitments were greater. He depended on America, and Russia,
and even the East for many things. Unless he was circumspect, he
might find himself marooned. He temporised.</p>

<p>"It's a big idea."</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich blinked at the great salon and cracked a knuckle.
Then he arose and walked to the window, and looked across the park.
He appeared to be considering some new problem. Suddenly he turned
and said quietly:</p>

<p>"This is a very beautiful house. Very quiet and charming. It has
suddenly occurred to me&mdash;Ah Sing Fu and I had almost
determined to call a conference at Joachims in Prague at the end of
the month, but when I come to think of it&mdash;I wonder whether we
could trespass upon your hospitality! This would make an ideal
meeting place. And it would be more convenient in many ways. You
live here alone, do you not? Of course, it all depends upon the
word of Mrs. Trevanna..."</p>

<p>He smiled and bowed to her. Julius grunted and tugged at his
little moustache. Lena did not speak. The shafts of unspoken venom
passing between husband and wife must have been apparent to Mr.
Ulrich, but he gave no recognition of it. Julius suddenly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, certainly. Have it here, by all means."</p>

<p>But it was said less as a genial invitation than as an assertion
that the word of Mrs. Trevanna didn't count one way or the
other.</p>

<p>"Very kind, very kind of you indeed," murmured Mr. Ulrich. "As
you may imagine, there will be a great number of technicalities to
discuss. It will be necessary to get in everyone, and possibly
to&mdash;eradicate objectionable elements."</p>

<p>He uttered the last sentence very slowly and clearly. There was
a touch of velvet menace about it. Julius visualised Ah Sing Fu,
Ulrich and Joachim eradicating "objectionable elements." Joachim,
he knew, was another of these international fanatics who were
becoming so prolific. The centre of his operations was Prague, and
he controlled the film interests of all Central Europe. These three
together could eradicate anything. They were mad&mdash;stark,
staring mad; but they frightened him. Fortunately there was his
friend, Jonkers, in Brussels. He was a good man, a good, solid man,
with no nonsense about him. He would ring up Jonkers, and see what
he thought. Between them perhaps they could cope with these
lunatics, these visionaries. Damn it! what was his wife doing,
suddenly walking over to this American and shaking hands, saying
she would like to have the conference here? In his house! He, who
by his industry and genius, had built the place, and picked her out
of the gutter. He had half a mind to cancel the whole thing. He was
being rushed...</p>

<p>"Then that is settled, Mr. Trevanna. I do not mean that you will
agree at present to join the combination, but that you will agree
that we hold the conference here. It is so much more satisfactory
than any written or wirelessed way of communicating. It is
necessary that we should all know each other. The personal factor
still remains the dominant force in the world."</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich held out his hand, and Julius found himself gripping
it. The vanity of wealth over-rode his other feelings. He desired
to impress his rivals.</p>

<p>"Invite as many as you like," he exclaimed. "We could put up a
hundred or two and not notice them in this place."</p>

<p>"I do not think it will be necessary to ask more than about
twelve or fifteen&mdash;just a central body&mdash;but the
conference will naturally go on for several weeks. After
formulating a broadly-designed scheme, it will be necessary to keep
constantly in touch with our representatives in all parts of the
world. There will be opposition and misunderstanding, and we shall
have to clean it up bit by bit."</p>

<p>"I will stroll down the garden with you."</p>

<p>Julius felt a sudden accentuated aversion to his wife. He was
annoyed that she had been present. He felt that he was being made
to look weak and pliable, and it angered him that she should have
observed it. He scowled at her as he suggested the stroll in the
garden. It was meant to imply very forcibly that her presence was
undesirable. It was quite unnecessary, however. Lena made no
attempt to follow. She froze into her former conditionjof sullen
aloofness. Mr. Ulrich shook her hand, and the two men went into the
garden.</p>

<p>Lena watched them for some time talking earnestly beneath the
cedar tree. Ulrich did most of the talking. He was emphasising his
points deliberately and clearly, tapping the palm of his left hand
with two fingers of his right. In rather less than an hour's time,
he took his departure.</p>

<p>Julius came back into the house. He was in a very bad temper. He
kept snapping his fingers, a characteristic sign of extreme tension
and nervousness. When he saw her, he bawled at her:</p>

<p>"Make all preparations with the servants to entertain twenty men
here for three weeks in August."</p>

<p>She felt tempted to reply: "Don't you mean, 'make all
preparations with the <i>other</i> servants?'" but she forbore, and
shrank away from him. Alone in her room, she thought: "They are
going to stop the earth...everything will cease...everything will
be unreal for ever."</p>

<p>The unusual spell of heat continued. Three days later her
husband remarked to her in the morning:</p>

<p>"Jonkers is coming to-night. Have the Dubarry room prepared for
him."</p>

<p>She knew and detested this Jonkers. He was so very like her
husband, only not so fat. He had a disgusting, oleaginous,
over-familiar way of talking to her. He said one thing with his
mouth and another with his eyes. He was cunning, and supercilious,
and sensual. He sometimes flattered her, but she knew from his eyes
that he thought no more of her than her husband did. Nevertheless,
she was interested to hear of the visit. She knew that it was in
some way connected with the visit of Mr. Ulrich. All over the world
were springing up what her husband called "these crazy
internationalists." Ulrich, Ah Sing Fu, Joachim, and these others
were of that persuasion. They only awaited some lever. Jonkers and
Julius Trevanna would never agree with the rest. They would plot
behind the scenes. They would play for their own hands.</p>

<p>She knew that, and she knew it more fully when she saw them
together that night after dinner. She pretended to make herself
scarce, but she was watching and listening. Jonkers stayed two days
and nights, and the two friends talked far into the night. It was
very difficult. Julius was suspicious, and she had to appear more
dormant and preoccupied than ever. Only once did she manage to
overhear a portion of a conversation which completely showed the
trend of their ambitions.</p>

<p>"Of course, we shall have to agree," Julius was saying. "It's
too big a thing. But this is where we'll come in,
Jonkers&mdash;"</p>

<p>He explained some technical suggestion of Ulrich's. Lena could
not understand it, but she understood the chuckle of the Flemish
guest, when he interjected:</p>

<p>"Keep that dark, dear boy. You and I between us, we should make
four million a year clear profit over that&mdash;if we pretend,
see?"</p>

<p>Followed no relief from the prevailing high temperature. Jonkers
went and others came. Tapes and telephones and wires were always
active, and still the world was unsuspicious of being stopped. July
came and went and the day of the conference was drawing near.</p>

<p>Lena was pledged to secrecy. Not a word was to be breathed. The
affair was to have the appearance of an ordinary house party. The
servants would know nothing about the guests. If it came out that
all the film magnates were assembled at one point, the stock
markets of the world would be in panic.</p>

<p>Ah Sing Fu was the first arrival. He came with a retinue of
three servants and a secretary. He drifted into the house like an
autumn leaf indicating the wane of the year&mdash;an old man, with
a thin, white beard, suave, gentle, impenetrable. Lena would never
know him, but she felt that she could trust him.</p>

<p>"No man was ever so wise as some Chinamen look." Ah Sing Fu was
like that. There was something about him big, disinterested,
indestructible&mdash;a pioneer of perpetuity.</p>

<p>He and his retainers glided about the house in their slippered
feet. Their presence seemed permeating but intangible. Ulrich
followed within twelve hours. Then came Joachim, a jovial giant,
with a deep penetrating voice and a laugh that was good to hear.
Three others arrived in the night as if by magic. Rene Caradoc, a
Frenchman; Raddaes, a Portuguese; and an indeterminate person
called Linnsen, who might have been anything from a Moor to a
Chicago stock-raiser. They vanished to their rooms, met in the
morning, and talked in little groups over their coffee. The
conference was already begun. Golf was played in the afternoon,
obviously with the idea of giving an impression of normality.
Joachim broke a club, and his laugh could be heard across the park.
He had probably never played the game before. The afternoon brought
two gentlemen from South America and one from Cape Town. Lena was
beginning to lose the thread of their identities. Everything was
becoming dreamlike, fantastic. The heat was enervating. There was
an informal meeting of all parties in the library, and Julius
informed her that her presence was not desirable. Again in the
night arrived Moder, another American, and a Hindu, with a retinue
of five. Within the week the conference was complete. Twenty-three
sat round the circular table in the library. All the doors were
closed. Lena wandered about the grounds or sat in the garden
dreaming. What were they going to do? What would be the outcome of
it, this conspiracy to stop the earth? She liked Ulrich, and she
liked Joachim and Ah Sing Fu. They were good men. She was convinced
of that. But&mdash;this heat! She dreaded it, the stopping of the
earth, retrospection, going back, nothing happening again,
everything to be filmed and unreal. She would not be able to stand
it.</p>

<p>While things went on there always seemed a vestige of
hope...anything might happen. But if they were
successful&mdash;</p>

<p>She met them on the terrace and at meal times, pleasant,
charming men for the most part. They were very kind to her, very
considerate, but pre-occupied. Big things were on the move. Code
messages arrived and were despatched all day and night. The weeks
dragged by. She overheard occasional remarks which gave her an
inkling of development. There appeared to be trouble in South
Russia and the Balkans. There would be, of course. Joachim and
Ulrich were very active over this. Someone was being squeezed out.
The operation appeared to be conducted through a process of buying
and selling stock on the Vienna stock exchange. It was all quite
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>At the end of the third week two more men appeared; one a
German, the other an Albanian. They were initiated into the
mysteries. Once she heard one of them remark: "The Dutch are
obstinate." She knew they would be. Her heart went out to the
Dutch. Then the crushing process began on Amsterdam. Someone else
was superseded. It seemed horrible. The whole earth was being
cleaned up. And all the time Julius Trevanna and Jonkers were
playing some game of their own. Before the others, they did not
appear very intimate, but Lena knew that Julius invariably visited
Jonkers in his room at night after the others had retired. There
was a private telephone and wireless service there. One night she
tried to listen at the keyhole. She could hear them talking, but
could not hear what they said. And suddenly the door opened and
Julius came out. He caught hold of her arm and hurt her.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you doing?" he muttered, and he flung her
across the passage.</p>

<p>That night she did not sleep.</p>

<p>The next day she sought out Ulrich. She managed to detach him
from a group on the terrace. She whispered:</p>

<p>"Mr. Ulrich, may I have a private word with you?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, dear lady."</p>

<p>"Will you come to the end of the second orchid house in ten
minutes' time?"</p>

<p>When he came she could not get her breath. She was terrified.
She felt sure Julius would know. If she betrayed him, he would kill
her. She said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Ulrich, forgive me. I am worried. I know you are
good&mdash;you are all good men. But this power you are
wielding&mdash;suppose one day this power should...get into the
hands of someone who is not good?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich looked at her kindly, and patted her hand.</p>

<p>"My dear lady," he answered, "you are quite right. And we are
taking every precaution. As a matter of fact, the combination can
only exist while it is a moral force. You may be sure that
immediately it began to be abused humanity would turn and rend it.
Our ambition is to keep it dark for many years until its activities
have produced concrete results."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that the world won't know it has been
stopped?"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what I mean."</p>

<p>"But suppose&mdash;suppose someone <i>inside</i> abused it."</p>

<p>"There is a slight risk of that, of course. But he would have to
be wonderfully astute to deceive Ah Sing Fu and&mdash;some of the
others. Has anyone arrived at the conference whose character you
suspect?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"There, there, you must not distress yourself, Mrs. Trevanna.
Everything is going on splendidly. The meeting has exceeded my
wildest anticipations."</p>

<p>A messenger came seeking him. The conference was in session.
Lena ordered the car and told the chauffeur to drive fast. She
wanted air. The heat was getting unbearable. On her return the
party were again on the terrace. They seemed in very good spirits.
She heard Joachim say: "On Thursday, then, we will sign."</p>

<p>Ulrich replied: "Yes. If the reply from Brotzel is
satisfactory."</p>

<p>She moved among them, and with shy diffidence presided at the
silver tea urn. The men were all laughing and joking. Joachim
suddenly slapped his leg.</p>

<p>"I have it! I have it! I know what we must do," he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"We must film it."</p>

<p>"Film what?"</p>

<p>"Thursday. It must go down to posterity. The day when the
Conference was signed. All the incidents of the day. The members
signing&mdash;having tea, talking, enjoying the special delights of
Mrs. Trevanna's hospitality."</p>

<p>Ulrich nodded sagely.</p>

<p>"There would be no objection, I'm sure, provided that the films
were not released for many years."</p>

<p>"Naturally. What do you say, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>No one objected, although Ah Sing Fu seemed to consider it a
superfluous indignity. Rather trivial; nevertheless, he nodded
acquiescence. Jonkers smiled cynically.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Very good. You must be in this, too, Mrs.
Trevanna. Wife of British delegate ministering to her husband,
eh?"</p>

<p>The suggestion was greeted with shouts of approval. Lena frowned
and felt uncomfortable. What a mockery! And all these years she had
wanted to play&mdash;now, "the wife of British delegate ministering
to his wants." The future generations would never know. No one
would know except Jonkers, mocking and sneering behind his black
moustache. How unbearable! What could she do to stop it all?</p>

<p>On the Wednesday news came that Brotzel&mdash;whoever he
was&mdash;had been won to the cause. The coast was clear. The next
day the Conference would sign and break up. The world would begin
to stop.</p>

<p>That night Lena slept for an hour, and then awoke with a start.
She rose and went to the window. She pressed her temples against
the pane. The heat was intolerable. She looked out into the park.
Nothing stirred. Everything was unnaturally still. The silence was
oppressive. "The world has stopped...the world has stopped," she
thought. "Nothing will ever happen again. There will be no more
love, no more romance&mdash;only make-believe. It will get hotter
and hotter. The sun will scorch it to a cinder, and the other side
will freeze. Everyone will die, and either burn up or freeze.
Nothing will matter. Nothing will have any value. It will all be as
though it had never existed. Perhaps it never did exist. Perhaps
it's just a dream&mdash;a film."</p>

<p>Suddenly burying her face in her hands, she muttered:</p>

<p>"Oh God! give me power to be real&mdash;just once."</p>

<p>The day dawned clear and hot. The terrace glittered with
sunlight and crisp shadows. An excellent day for "shooting." The
operators were already busy in the park. She could see Joachim
laughing and striking preposterous attitudes. Ah Sing Fu fanning
himself unconcernedly. A small party having breakfast on the
terrace. Ulrich talking quietly and authoritatively. Where was
Julius Trevanna? Ah! the inevitable cigar. He strolls&mdash;or
rather rolls&mdash;like a bloated elephant to the easy chair to put
his feet up, a newspaper tucked under his arm. A breakfast tray on
a table by his left side, the plates and knives dishevelled. He has
been for the paper. He looks irritable and bored. A fat band of
flesh bulges above his collar. His thick lips are sucking at the
cigar.</p>

<p>Down she goes. The sunlight blinds and dizzies her. She could
almost faint with that first step into the light. Nervousness, a
kind of stage-fright, perhaps. Very, very slowly, like a cat, she
creeps across the terrace. A little man by the top of the steps is
watching her, and she is pleased. Years and years go by before she
reaches the table, but it doesn't matter because the world has
stopped. Her actions become slower and slower, and more mechanical.
She takes ages to choose the knife in such a collection. The
butter-knife would be foolish&mdash;possibly ineffective. The
bread-knife? No, that sharp, busy little thing so useful for
cutting ham. Cutting ham! She laughs inaudibly, but Julius does not
stir. The aggressive line of fat above the collar entices her. She
is conscious of her face clean cut in profile, expressing a real
emotion that shall go down to posterity, of the deliberate grace of
her posture as she slowly raises her arm and&mdash;thrusts
downwards above the collar, and of the voice of the little man at
the top of the steps:</p>

<p>"That's right, Mrs. Trevanna, not too fast. Hold it!
Fine...fine...My God! what have you done!"...The first big part
Julius Trevanna had ever given her an opportunity to play.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. The Brown Wallet</h2>

<p>Giles Meiklejohn was a beaten man. Huddled in the corner of a
third class railway carriage on the journey from Epsom to London,
he sullenly reviewed the unfortunate series of episodes which had
brought him into the position he found himself. Dogged by bad
luck!...Thirty-seven years of age; married; a daughter ten years
old; nothing attained; his debts exceeding his assets; and
now&mdash;out of work!</p>

<p>He had tried, too. A little pampered in his upbringing; when the
crisis came he had faced it manfully. When, during his very first
year at Oxford, the news came of his father's bankruptcy and sudden
death from heart failure, he immediately went up to town and sought
a situation in any capacity. His mother had died many years
previously, and his only sister was married to a missionary in
Burmah. His accomplishments at that time? Well, he could play
cricket and squash rackets; he knew a smattering of Latin and a
smudge of French; he remembered a few dates in history, and he
could add up and subtract (a little unreliably). He was good
looking, genial, and of excellent physique. He had no illusions
about the difficulties which faced him.</p>

<p>His father had always been a kind of practical visionary.
Connected with big insurance interests, he was a man of large
horizons, profound knowledge, and great ideals. Around his sudden
failure and death there had always clung an atmosphere of mystery.
That he had never expected to fail, and was unprepared for death a
week before it happened is certain. He had had plans for Giles
which up to that time he had had no opportunity of putting into
operation. The end must have been cyclonic.</p>

<p>Through the intervention of friends, Giles obtained a situation
as clerk in an insurance office, his wages amounting to fifteen
shillings a week, a sum he had managed to live on. In the evening
he attended classes, and studied shorthand and typewriting. At
first the freshness of this experience, aided by youth and good
health, stimulated him. But as time went on he began to realize
that he had chosen work for which he was utterly unsuited. He
worked hard but made no progress. He had not a mathematical mind;
he was slow in the up-take. The chances of promotion were remote.
The men around him seemed so quick and clever. At the end of two
years he decided to resign and try something else. If only he had
been taught a profession! After leaving the insurance office he
went through various experiences; working at a seedsman's nursery,
going round with a circus, attempting to get on the stage and
failing, working his passage out to South Africa, more clerking,
nearly dying from enteric through drinking polluted water, working
on an ostrich farm, returning to England as a male nurse to a young
man who was mentally deficient.</p>

<p>It was not till he met Minting that he achieved any success at
all. They started a press-cutting agency in two rooms in
Bloomsbury. Minting was clever, and Giles borrowed fifty pounds
(from whom we will explain later). Strangely enough the
press-cutting agency was a success. After the first six months they
began to do well.</p>

<p>It was at that time that he met Eleanor. She was secretary to
Sir Herbert Woolley, the well-known actor-manager, and she happened
to call one day concerning the matter of press-cuttings for her
employer. From the very first moment there was never any question
on either side but that both he and she had met their fate. Neither
had there been an instant's regret on either side ever since. They
were completely devoted. With the business promising well, he
married her within three months. It is probable that if the
business had not existed he would have done the same. They went to
live in a tiny flat in Maida Vale, and a child was born the
following year.</p>

<p>A period of unclouded happiness followed. There was no fortune
to be made out of press-cuttings, but a sufficient competence to
keep Eleanor and the child in reasonable comfort. Everything
progressed satisfactorily for three years. And then one July
morning the blow fell. At that time he and Minting were keeping a
junior clerk. Giles and Eleanor had been away to the sea for a
fortnight's holiday. Minting was to go on the day of their return.
When Giles arrived at the office he found the clerk alone. To his
surprise he heard that Minting had not been there himself for a
fortnight. He did not have long to wait to find the solution of the
mystery. The first hint came in the discovery of a blank
counterfoil. Minting had withdrawn every penny of their small
capital and vanished!</p>

<p>Giles did not tell his wife. He made a desperate effort to pull
the concern together, but in vain. There were a great number of
outstanding debts, and he had just nine shillings when he returned
from his holiday. He rushed round and managed to borrow a pound or
two here and there, sufficient to buy food and pay off the clerk,
but he quickly foresaw that the crash was inevitable. He had not
the business acumen of Minting, and no one seemed prepared to
invest money in a bankrupt press-cutting agency. In the midst of
his troubles the original source of the fifty pounds upon which he
started the business, wrote peremptorily demanding the money back.
He went there and begged and pleaded, but it was obvious that the
"original source" looked upon him as a waster and
ne'er-do-well.</p>

<p>He went bankrupt, and Eleanor had to be told. She took it in
just the way he knew she would take it. She said:</p>

<p>"Never mind, darling. We'll soon get on our feet again."</p>

<p>She had been a competent secretary, with a knowledge of French,
bookkeeping, shorthand and typewriting. She set to work and
obtained a situation herself as secretary to the manager of a firm
of wallpaper manufacturers, housing the child during the day with a
friendly neighbour.</p>

<p>Giles was idle the whole of August. They gave up the flat and
went into lodgings. In September he got work as a clerk to a
stationer. His salary was thirty shillings a week, a pound less
than his wife was getting. He felt the situation bitterly. Poor
Eleanor! How he had let her down. When he spoke about it though she
only laughed and said:</p>

<p>"If our troubles are never anything worse than financial ones,
darling, I shan't mind."</p>

<p>They continued to be only financial ones till the following year
when Eleanor became very ill. She gave birth to a child that died.
In a desperate state Giles again approached the "original source."
After suffering considerable recrimination and bullying he managed
to extract another ten pounds, which quickly vanished. It was three
months before Eleanor was well enough to resume work, and during
that time they lived in a state of penury. Giles lived almost
entirely on tea and bread, and became very run down and thin. He
pretended to Eleanor that he had had an increase, and that he had a
good lunch every day, so that all the money he earned could be
spent on her and the baby. In the meantime he dissected desperately
that grimmest of all social propositions&mdash;the unskilled labour
market. If only he had been taught to be a boot-maker, a plumber,
or a house-painter he would have been better off. Manners may make
men, but they don't make money, and one has to make money to live.
He became envious of his fellow clerks and shop assistants who had
never tasted the luxurious diet of a public school training. That
he had brains he was fully aware, but they had never been trained
in any special direction. They were, moreover, the kind of brains
that do not adapt themselves to commercial ends. He had always had
a great affection for his father, but he began to nurture a
resentment against his memory. His father had treated him badly,
bringing him up to a life of ease and assurance and then deserting
him.</p>

<p>It would be idle and not very interesting to trace the record of
his experiences during the next years up to the time when we find
him in the train on the way back from Epsom. It is a dreary story,
the record of a series of dull underpaid jobs, a few bright gleams
of hope, even days and nights of complete happiness, then dull
reactions, strain, worry, hunger, nervous fears, blunted ambitions,
and thwarted desires. Through it all the only thing that remained
unalterably bright and inspiring, was his wife's face. Not once did
she flinch, not once did she lose hope. Her constant slogan: "Never
mind, old darling, we'll soon be on our feet again," was ever in
his ears, buoying him up through the darkest hours.</p>

<p>And again he was out of work, again Eleanor was not well, and
again he had been to the "original source."</p>

<p>The "original source" was his uncle, his father's brother. He
was a thin, acid old gentleman, known in commercial circles as a
money-maniac. Living alone in a large house at Epsom, with all
kinds of telephonic connections with the city, he thought and
dreamed of nothing at all but his mistress&mdash;money. Between him
and Giles' father had always existed a venomous hatred, far more
pronounced on the side of his uncle than of his father. It had
dated back many years. When his father died and Giles appealed to
his uncle, the old gentleman appeared thoroughly to enjoy giving
him five pounds as an excuse for a lecture and a subtly conveyed
sneer at his father's character.</p>

<p>He was a very wealthy man, and he could easily have launched
Giles into the world by putting him through the training for one of
the professions, but he preferred to dole out niggardy litte bits
of charity and advice, and to boast that he himself was a self-made
man, who had had no special training.</p>

<p>"No," thought Giles, "but you have an instinct for making money.
I haven't. You don't have to train a duck to swim."</p>

<p>Naturally, they very quickly quarrelled, and his uncle seemed to
rejoice in his failures. It was only in his most desperate
positions that he appealed to him again.</p>

<p>Lying back in the dimly lighted railway carriage he kept on
visualizing his uncle's keen malevolent eyes, the thrust of the
pointed chin. The acid tones of his voice echoed through his
brain:</p>

<p>"It's quite time, my lad, you pulled yourself together. You
ought to have made your fortune by now. Don't imagine I'm always
going to help you."</p>

<p>Giles had humbled his pride for his wife and child's sake. He
had spent the night at his uncle's, and by exercising his utmost
powers of cajolery, had managed to extort three pounds. Three
pounds! and the rent overdue, bills pressing, his wife unwell and
he&mdash;out of work. What was he going to do?</p>

<p>The train rumbled into Waterloo Station without any satisfactory
answer being arrived at. He pulled his bag out from under the seat,
and stepped slowly out of the carriage.</p>

<p>Walking along the platform it suddenly occurred to him that he
was feeling weak and exhausted. "I hope to God I'm not going to be
ill," he thought.</p>

<p>The bag, which only contained his night things and a change of
clothes, seemed unbearably heavy. A slight feeling of faintness
came over him as he passed the ticket-collector.</p>

<p>"I believe I shall have to have a cab," flashed through him.</p>

<p>Two important-looking men got out of a taxi which had just
driven up. Giles engaged it, and having given his address he
stepped in and sank back exhausted on to the seat. It was very dark
in the cab, and he lay huddled in the corner&mdash;a beaten man.
Everything appeared distant and dim, and unimportant. He had hardly
eaten any lunch, and his uncle seemed to have arranged that he
should leave his house just before dinner. It was late, and he was
hungry and over-wrought.</p>

<p>The cab turned a corner sharply, and Giles lurched and thrust
his hand on to the other end of the seat to prevent himself
falling. As he did so his knuckles brushed against an object. Quite
apathetically he felt to see what it was. He picked it up and held
it near the window. It was a brown leather wallet, with a circular
brass lock. He regarded it dubiously, and for an instant hesitated
whether he should tell the driver to go back to the station, the
wallet presumably belonging to one of those two importantlooking
men who had got out. But would it be possible to find them? By that
time they would probably have gone off by train. No, the right
thing to do was to give it up to the police, of course.</p>

<p>It was a fat wallet, and he sat there with it in his hand
ruminating. He wondered what it contained. Quite easy just to have
a squint anyway. He tried to slip the catch but it wouldn't open.
It was locked. It is difficult to determine the extent to which
this knowledge affected him. If it had not been locked Giles
Meiklejohn's immediate actions, and indeed his future career might
have been entirely different. It irritated him that the wallet was
locked...tantalized him. If it was locked it meant that it
contained something...pretty useful. All round the park he lay back
in the cab hugging the wallet like one in a trance.</p>

<p>A desperate, beaten man, holding a fat wallet in his hand.
Contrary forces were struggling within his tired mind. Going up
Park Lane one of these forces seemed to succumb to the other.
Almost in a dream he leant out of the cab, and said quietly to the
driver:</p>

<p>"Drive to the Trocadero. I think I'll get a bit of supper
first."</p>

<p>Arriving there, he paid the cabman, concealed the wallet in his
overcoat and went in. He entered a lavatory and locked himself in.
With unruffled deliberation he took out a penknife and began to saw
away at the leather around the lock.</p>

<p>"I just want to have a squint," he kept on mentally
repeating.</p>

<p>It took him nearly a quarter of an hour to get the wallet open,
and when he did his heart was beating like a sledge hammer.</p>

<p>The wallet contained eight thick packets of one pound treasury
notes! He feverishly computed the number which each packet
contained, and decided that it must be two hundred and fifty. In
other words, he had two thousand pounds' worth of ready cash in his
possession!</p>

<p>A desperate, beaten man, with a wife and child, hungry...out of
work...two thousand pounds!...</p>

<p>There seemed no question about it all then. One side of the
scale was too heavily weighted. He took seventeen of the one pound
notes and put them in his pocket book, the rest he divided into the
pockets of his overcoat, where he also concealed the wallet. He
went up into the bar and ordered a double brandy and soda. He drank
it in two gulps and went out and hailed another taxi. On the way
home he stopped at a caterer's, and bought a cold fowl, some
pressed beef, new rolls, cheese, a box of chocolates, and a bottle
of wine. Then he drove homeward.</p>

<p>Up to this point his actions seemed to have been controlled by
some sub-conscious force. So far as his normal self was concerned,
he had hardly thought at all. But as he began to approach his own
neighbourhood&mdash;his own wife&mdash;the realization of what he
had done&mdash;what he was doing&mdash;came home to him...</p>

<p>"It was practically stealing. It is stealing, you know."</p>

<p>Yes, but what would any one else have done in that position? He
couldn't let his wife and child starve. There was only one thing he
was afraid of...his wife's eyes. She must never know. He would have
to be cunning, circumspect. He must get rid of the wallet, conceal
the notes from his wife&mdash;eke them out in driblets, pretend he
was making money somehow. But the wallet? He couldn't leave it in
the cab. It would be found and the cabman would give evidence. He
mustn't drive home at all. He must get out again, think again.
Between Paddington and Maida Vale runs a canal. Happy thought! a
canal! he stopped at the bridge and dismissed the man again,
tipping him lavishly. The banks of the canal were railed off. It
was only possible to get near enough to throw anything in from the
bridge. Thither he walked at a rapid stride. The feeling of
exhaustion had passed. He was tingling with excitement. He looked
eagerly about for a stone, and cursed these modern arrangements of
wooden pavements. There were no stones near the canal. Never mind,
the thing would probably sink. If it didn't, who could trace its
discovery to his action? The point was to get rid of it unseen.</p>

<p>He reached the bridge. A few stray people were passing backward
and forward&mdash;must wait till everyone was out of sight. He hung
about, gripping his portmanteau in one hand, and the wallet in his
right hand overcoat pocket. He crossed the bridge once, but still
seeing dark figures about he had to return. Why not throw it now?
No, there was someone watching in the road opposite&mdash;might be
a policeman! The police! never had cause to feel frightened at the
police before. There would be a splash. Someone might come out of
the darkness, a deep voice:</p>

<p>"What was that you threw in the canal?"</p>

<p>No, no, couldn't do it. The bridge was too exposed, too much of
a fairway. He hurried off walking rapidly down side streets in the
direction of his home. At last an opportunity presented itself.
Shabby, deserted little street, a low stone wall enclosing a meagre
garden. Not a soul in sight. Like a flash he slipped the wallet
over the wall and dropped it. Instantaneously he looked up at the
house connected with the garden. A man was looking out of the first
floor window, watching him!</p>

<p>He turned and walked quickly back. He thought he heard a call.
At the first turning he ran, the portmanteau banging against his
leg and impeding his progress. He only ceased running because
people stopped and looked at him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"It's all right! It's all right!" he kept saying to himself.
"I've got rid of it."</p>

<p>Yes, he was rid of that danger, but there loomed before him the
more insidious difficulty of concealing the notes. His pockets
bulged with them. When he arrived home, Eleanor would run out into
the landing and throw her arms round him. He could almost hear the
tones of her gentle voice saying:</p>

<p>"Whatever have you got in your pockets, darling?"</p>

<p>If he put them in the portmanteau she would be almost certain to
open it, or she would be in the room when he went to unpack. Very
difficult to conceal anything from Eleanor; she knew all about him;
every little thing about him interested her. Nothing in their rooms
was locked up. Moreover, she was very observant, methodical and
practical. Someone had called her psychic, but this was only
because she thought more quickly than most people, and had unerring
intuitions.</p>

<p>Giles would have to be very cunning. His mental energies were so
concerned with the necessity for deceiving Eleanor that the moral
aspect of his position was temporarily blurred. He plunged on
through the darkness, his mind working rapidly. At the corner of
their meagre street he was tempted to stuff the notes in a pillar
box and hurry home.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," said the other voice. "Here is comfort and
luxury interminably&mdash;not only for yourself, for the
others."</p>

<p>He went boldly up to the house and let himself in. He heard
other lodgers talking in the front ground floor room. He hurried by
and reached his own landing. To his relief Eleanor's voice came
from the room above:</p>

<p>"Is that you, darling?"</p>

<p>He dumped the bag down and in a flash had removed his overcoat
and hung it on a peg in a dark corner. Then he called out:</p>

<p>"Hullo, old girl. Everything all right?"</p>

<p>Within a minute his wife's arms were around him, and he
exclaimed with forced triumph:</p>

<p>"I touched the old boy for twenty pounds! I've brought home a
chicken and things."</p>

<p>"Oh! how splendid! A chicken! Rather extrav. isn't it,
darling?"</p>

<p>"One must live, dear angel."</p>

<p>Her confidence and trust in him, her almost childish glee over
the gay feast, her solicitude in his welfare, her anxiety that
little Anna should have some chicken, but keep the sweets till the
morrow, her voice later crooning over the child&mdash;all these
things mocked his conscience. But he couldn't afford to have a
conscience. He couldn't afford to say:</p>

<p>"I stole all this and more."</p>

<p>He was eager for the attainment of that last
instance&mdash;crooning over the child. Whilst he was putting the
little girl to bed, he crept but into the passage and extracted the
packets of notes from his overcoat pocket. He took them into the
sitting room and wrapped them up in brown paper. He wrote on the
outside, "stationery." Then he stuffed the parcel at the back of a
cupboard where they kept all kinds of odds and ends.</p>

<p>"That'll have to do for to-night," he thought. "I'm too tired to
think of anything better."</p>

<p>When she came down he enlarged the claims of his exhaustion. He
had a bit of a head he explained, just as well to turn in early. In
the darkness he clung to her fearfully, like a child in terror of
separation.</p>

<p>It was not till she was sleeping peacefully that the enormity of
his offence came home to him.</p>

<p>If he were found out! It would kill her.</p>

<p>He remembered her expression:</p>

<p>"If our troubles are never anything worse than financial ones,
darling, I shan't mind."</p>

<p>Good God! What had he done? He could call it &gt;what he liked,
but crudely speaking it was just stealing. He had stolen. He was a
criminal, a felon. If found out, it meant arrest, trial,
imprisonment&mdash;all these horrors he had only vaguely envisaged
as concerning a different type of person to himself. In the rough
and tumble of his life he had never before done anything criminal,
never anything even remotely dishonest. And she, Eleanor, what
would she think of him? It would destroy her love, destroy her
life, ruin the child.</p>

<p>He must get up, go into the other room and&mdash;what? What
could he do with the notes? Burn them? Eleanor had that mother's
curious faculty for profound, but at the same time, watchful sleep.
If he got out of bed she would be aware of it. If he went into the
next room and began burning things, she would be instantly
alert.</p>

<p>"What's that burning, darling?"</p>

<p>An ever-loving wife may be an embarrassment when one is not
quite playing the game. By destroying the wallet he had burnt his
boats. If he returned the money he would have to explain what the
wallet was doing in a neighbour's garden with the brass lock cut
away.</p>

<p>"Besides, you've already spent some," interjected that other
voice. "You're horribly in debt. Here's succour. The money probably
belongs to some rich corporation. It's not like taking it from the
poor. Don't be a fool. Go to sleep."</p>

<p>For hours he tossed feverishly, the pendulum of his resolutions
swinging backward and forward. If he was to keep the money, he
would have to invent some imaginary source of income, a fictitious
job, perhaps, and that would be very difficult because Eleanor was
so solicitous, such a glutton for details concerning himself. He
might have made out that his uncle had given him a much larger sum
of money, but in that case there was the danger that in her
impetuous manner Eleanor might have written to the old man, and the
old man would smell a rat. Doubtless the affair of the lost wallet
would be in the papers the next day, and wouldn't the old man be
delighted to bring it home to Giles!</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but to trust to fate. The milk
carts were clattering in the road before he slept.</p>

<p>It was hours later that he heard Anna's merry little laugh, and
his wife's voice saying:</p>

<p>"Hush, darling, daddy's asleep. He's very tired."</p>

<p>He got up and faced the ordeals of the day. The place at the
back of the lumber cupboard seemed the most exposed in the world.
He racked his brains for a more suitable spot. But whichever place
he thought of danger seemed to lurk. One never quite knew what
Eleanor might do. She was so keen on tidying up and clearing things
out. He decided that a crisp walk might clear his mind. He made up
the excuse that he was going to the public library to look through
the advertisements and went out. He meant to smuggle the parcel of
notes out with him, but Eleanor was too much on the spot. She
helped him on with his overcoat and said:</p>

<p>"It'll soon be all right again, darling."</p>

<p>Poor Eleanor! What a capacity she had for living! She ought to
have married a rich, successful, and clever man. She ought to have
everything a beautiful woman desires. Well?...He walked quickly to
the nearest news-agent and bought a paper. There was nothing in the
morning paper about the loss of the wallet. He felt annoyed about
this, until he realized that of course there wouldn't have been
time. It would come out later. And indeed whilst standing on the
curb anxiously scrutinizing his morning paper, boys came along the
street selling the <i>Star</i> and the <i>Evening News</i>.</p>

<p>A paragraph in the <i>Star</i>, headed "£2,000 left in a taxi,"
supplied him with the information he needed. It announced that Sir
James Cusping, K.B.E., a director of a well-known bank and a chief
cashier, left a wallet containing two thousand pounds in treasury
notes in a taxi at Waterloo Station. The money was the result of a
cash transaction concerning certain bank investments. Any one
giving information likely to lead to recovery would be suitably
rewarded. It also announced that Scotland Yard had the matter in
hand.</p>

<p>So far the information was satisfactory. Sir James Cusping was a
notoriously wealthy man, and the chief cashier was hardly likely to
be held seriously responsible for a loss for which such an
important person was jointly responsible. The bank mentioned was a
bank that advertised that its available assets exceeded four
hundred million pounds. Two thousand pounds meant less to it than
two pence would mean to Giles. No one was hurt by the transfer of
this useful sum to his own pocket. The sun was shining. Why be down
in the mouth about it? What he had done he had done, and he must
see it through.</p>

<p>How could anybody trace the theft to him? The two cabmen? They
would be hardly likely to remember his face, and neither of them
had driven him home. There was no danger from any one except
Eleanor. A sudden fever of dread came over him. She would assuredly
turn out that cupboard today, find the packet of "stationery."
Then&mdash;what?</p>

<p>He hurried back home. Approaching the house other fears assailed
him. He had visions of policemen waiting for him on the other side
of the hall door.</p>

<p>Damn it! His nerves were going to pot. He opened the door with
exaggerated nonchalance. There was no one there. No one up in his
rooms except his wife and child. Eleanor was singing. The kettle
was on the gas ring, ready for tea.</p>

<p>"What a cad I am to her," he thought.</p>

<p>The condition of frenzied agitation continued till the following
afternoon when it reached a crisis. He was feeling all unstrung.
Seated alone in their little sitting room he was struggling with
the resolution to confess everything to Eleanor, when she entered
the room. He glanced at her and nearly screamed. She was <i>holding
up the parcel in her hand!</i></p>

<p>In her cheerful voice she said:</p>

<p>"What is this parcel marked stationery, darling? I was turning
out the cupboard."</p>

<p>Like an animal driven to bay he jumped up and almost snatched it
from her. The inspiration of despair prompted him to exclaim:</p>

<p>"Oh!...that! Yes, yes, I wanted that. It's something a chap
wanted me to get for him...It doesn't belong to me."</p>

<p>A chap! What chap? Giles didn't usually refer to chaps. They had
no secrets apart. She looked surprised.</p>

<p>"I was just going to open it. As a matter of fact we have run
out of stationery."</p>

<p>"Eh? No, no, not that. I must send that back. I'll get some more
stationery."</p>

<p>He tucked the packet under his arm and went out into the
hall.</p>

<p>"You're not going out at once?" said Eleanor, following.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I must post it at once. I'd quite forgotten."</p>

<p>He slipped on his coat and went out without his customary
embrace.</p>

<p>Beads of perspiration were on his brow.</p>

<p>"That's done it!" he muttered in the street, "I must never take
it back."</p>

<p>An extravagant plan formed in his mind. He went to the library
and looked at the advertisements in a local paper. He took down
some addresses in St. John's Wood. In half an hour's time he was
calling on a landlady in a mean street.</p>

<p>"You have a furnished room to let?" he said when she
appeared.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this. I am an author. I want a quiet room to
work in during the day time."</p>

<p>"I've got a nice room as would suit you."</p>

<p>"Come on, then, let me see it, please."</p>

<p>He booked the room, a shabby little over-crowded apartment.</p>

<p>"I'll be coming in to-day," he said.</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. What name might it be?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;name? Oh, yes, name&mdash;er&mdash;John Parsons."</p>

<p>He fled down the street and sought a furnishing
establishment.</p>

<p>"I want an oak desk which I can lock up&mdash;a good strong
lock."</p>

<p>He paid seven pounds ten for the desk, and got it taken round at
once on a barrow. He then bought scribbling papers, paper, and ink.
He established himself in his room, stuffed the packet of notes in
the desk and locked it. Then he went out into the street again. The
fresh air fanned his temples. He almost chuckled.</p>

<p>"By God! Why didn't I think of this at first?" he reflected.
"After the life I've led one forgets the power of money."</p>

<p>He felt singularly calm and confident. It was dark when he got
home. He kissed Eleanor and made up an elaborate story about a
fellow clerk named Lyel Bristowe, who used to work in the same
office, and whom he had met in the street recently. He had wanted
this particular stationery most particularly. He had been to see
him, and Bristowe was giving him an introduction to a man who might
be able to offer him a good situation. The story went down
reasonably well, but he thought he detected a pucker of suspicion
about his wife's brow.</p>

<p>He was too involved now to turn back. The following day he
visited his furnished room. He anxiously unlocked the desk, took
out the notes, examined them, put them back, took them out again,
stuffed them in his pocket...Very dangerous after all leaving them
there, a flimsy lock...there might be a burglary. He had told the
landlady that he was an author, and it is true that he spent a
great portion of the day inventing fiction...lies to tell Eleanor.
He eventually locked the notes up again and went home.</p>

<p>He assumed a somewhat forced air of triumph. He had been
successful. Through the influence of Bristowe, he had secured a
position as chief cashier to a firm of surgical instrument makers
in Camden Town. His salary was to be five pounds a week to
commence. Eleanor clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, but how lovely, darling! I suppose you can do it? You're
such an old silly at figures!"</p>

<p>He explained that the work was quite simple, and added
ironically that the great thing Messrs. Binns and Binns wanted was
a man they could trust.</p>

<p>Then the narrow life of lies proceeded apace. Every day he went
to his room, fingered the notes, took some when he needed them,
deliberately invented the names and characters of his fellow
workers at Messrs. Binns and Binns, even made up little incidents
and stories concerning his daily experiences. The whole affair was
so inordinately successful. No further reference was made in the
newspapers to the missing wallet, and though Scotland Yard were
supposed to have the matter in hand, what could they do? Even if by
chance suspicion fell on him, there was nothing incriminating to be
found in his lodgings, and not a soul knew the whereabouts of "John
Parsons." His wife and child were living comfortably. He was
gradually paying off his debts.</p>

<p>But if the purely material side of his adventure was successful,
the same cannot be said of the spiritual. He was tortured beyond
endurance. Lies bred lies. The moral lapse bred other moral lapses.
He was conscous of his own moral degeneration. He was ashamed to
look his wife in the face. In the evening when he intended to be
gay and cheerful he sat morosely in the corner, wishing that the
night would come&mdash;and go. In the day time he would sit in his
room, fretful and desolate. In a mood of despair he began to set
down his experiences in terms of fiction, ascribing his feelings to
an imaginary person. Sometimes when the position became unbearable
he would go out and drink. Often he would go up to the West End and
lunch extravagantly at some obscure restaurant. He came into touch
with unsavoury people of the underworld.</p>

<p>The marks of his deterioration quickly became apparent to his
wife. One morning she said:</p>

<p>"Darling, you're working too hard at that place. You look
rotten. Last night when you came home you smelt of brandy."</p>

<p>Then she wept a little, a thing she had never done in their days
of adversity. He promised not to do such a thing again. He swore
that the work was not hard; the firm were very pleased with him and
were going to give him a raise.</p>

<p>The weeks and months went by and he struggled to keep straight.
But little by little he felt himself slipping back. He managed to
write a few things which he sent off to publishers, but for the
most part he avoided his room for any length of time, and sat about
in obscure caf&eacute;s in Soho, drinking and playing cards.</p>

<p>Between himself and his wife the great chasm seemed to be
yawning. She was to him the dearest treasure in the world, and he
was thrusting her away. In that one weak moment he had destroyed
all chance of happiness&mdash;hers and his. Too late! Too late! In
six months' time he found that he had spent nearly five hundred
pounds! At this rate in another eighteen months it would all be
gone, and then&mdash;what? His moral character destroyed, his wife
broken in health, the child without protection or prospects.</p>

<p>One morning he observed his wife glancing in the mirror as she
did her hair. It came home to him abruptly that she had aged, aged
many years in the last six months. Soon she would be turning gray,
middle-aged, old-aged. And he? His hair was thin on top, his face
flabby, his organisms becoming inefficient and weak, his nerves
eternally on edge. Sometimes he was rude and snappy to her. And he
buried his face in the pillow and thought:</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, what have I done? What have I done?"</p>

<p>That day he concentrated on a great resolve. This thing would
have to stop. He would rather be a starving clerk again, rather a
bricklayer's navvy, a crossing-sweeper, anything. He wandered the
streets, hugging his determination. He avoided his old haunts.
There must be no compromise. The thing should be cut clean out. He
would confess. They would send back the remainder of the money
anonymously, and start all over again. It was hard, but anything
was better than this torture.</p>

<p>He returned home early in the afternoon, his face pale and
tense. His wife was on the landing. She said:</p>

<p>"Oh, I was just going to send a telegram on to you. It's from
your uncle. He says come at once."</p>

<p>A queer little stab of the old instinct of conspiracy went
through him. If she had sent the telegram on, it would have come
back: "No such firm known at this address."</p>

<p>What did his uncle want? Come at once? Should he go, or should
he make his confession first?</p>

<p>"I think you ought to go, darling. It sounds important."</p>

<p>Very well, then. The confession should be postponed till his
return.</p>

<p>He caught a train at a quarter to four, and arrived at his
uncle's house in daylight. An old housekeeper let him in and
said:</p>

<p>"Ah! Your uncle's been asking for you. The doctor's here."</p>

<p>"Is he ill?"</p>

<p>"They say he hasn't long to live. The poor man is in great
agony."</p>

<p>He was kept waiting ten minutes. A doctor came out to him,
looking very solemn.</p>

<p>"I've just given him an injection of strychnine. He wishes to
see you alone."</p>

<p>His uncle was propped up against the pillows. His face
unrecognizable except for the eyes, which were unnaturally bright.
Giles went close up to him, and took his hand. The old man's voice
was only just audible. He whispered:</p>

<p>"Quickly! quickly! I shall be going&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is it, uncle?"</p>

<p>"It mustn't come out, see? musn't get into the newspapers,
nothing, the disgrace, see? That's why...no cheques must pass; all
cash transaction, see?"</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"On that bureau...a brown paper parcel...it's yours, all in
bonds and cash, see? Twenty-eight thousand pounds...it really
belongs to your father...I can't explain...I'm going. He&mdash;I
swindled him...he thought he was...its all through me
he...bankrupt, death, see?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean my father...killed himself?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, see? Hastened his end...thought he would get into
trouble. Take it, Giles, for God's sake! Let me die in peace."</p>

<p>"Why did you? Why did you?"</p>

<p>"I loved your mother...Take it, Giles, for God's sake. Oh, this
pain!...it's coming...God help me!"</p>

<p>It was very late when Giles arrived home. His wife was asleep in
bed. All the way home he had been repeating to himself in a dazed
way:</p>

<p>"Twenty-eight thousand pounds. No, twenty-six thousand. Two
thousand to be sent back anonymously to the bank. No need for
confession. Twenty-six thousand pounds. Eleanor, Anna. Oh, my
dears!"</p>

<p>On the table in the sitting-room was a letter from a firm of
publishers, addressed to Mr. John Parsons. It stated that the firm
considered the short novel submitted to be a work of striking
promise, and the manager would be glad if Mr. Parsons would call on
them.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I've found out what I can do," Giles meditated.</p>

<p>Eleanor came into the room in her dressing-gown and embraced
him.</p>

<p>"All right, darling?"</p>

<p>"Very much. Uncle has given me twenty-eight&mdash;I mean
twenty-six thousand pounds. He said he cheated my father out of
it."</p>

<p>"Darling! Cheated! How awful."</p>

<p>No, there was no need for confession. The sudden wild change in
their fortunes got into his blood. He gripped her round the waist
and lifted her up.</p>

<p>"Think of it, old girl, money to live on for ever. A place in
the country, eh? You know, your dream: a bit of land and an old
house, flowers, chickens, dogs, books, a pony perhaps. What about
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Giles, I can't realize it. But how splendid, too, about the
publishers' letter. Why didn't you tell me you were writing? Why do
you call yourself John Parsons?"</p>

<p>No need for confession, no, no, let's go to bed. But oh! to get
back to the old intimacy...</p>

<p>And so in the silent night he told her everything.</p>

<p>And the tears she shed upon his burning cheeks gave him the only
balm of peace he had enjoyed since the hour he had destroyed the
wallet.</p>

<p>It was Eleanor's hand which printed in Roman lettering on the
outside of a parcel the address of Sir James Cusping, K.B.E. Inside
were two thousand pounds in treasury notes, and on a slip of paper
in the same handwriting: "<i>Conscience money</i>. Found in a
taxi."</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. The Everlasting Club</h2>

<p>On the night of November 11th, 1918, seven men sat round a table
in an old barn in an obscure spot in Picardy. The news of the
Armistice had come through in the morning, and it was apparent that
the occupants of the barn were about to celebrate this historic
occasion with what means they had at their disposal. It cannot be
said that their faces expressed the kind of hysterical elation
which was at that moment marking the faces of the revellers in
Paris. London, and New York. Their faces certainly expressed
relief, but it was relief tempered by the too close contact of late
experience. They were like men dazed and a little drugged. Perhaps
their environment had something to do with this. The barn was dark,
and cold, and draughty. The rain was beating against the roof. A
small kerosene lamp, smelling abominably, gave out a feeble
suggestion of warmth. The table was lighted with candles stuck into
bottles. Perhaps their remoteness from their fellows gave them a
feeling that the news was unbelievable, or that it might be
contradicted any moment. The War had been on too long, and the
weariness and agony of it were stamped upon their faces.</p>

<p>McLagan and Treadway were <i>pukka</i> soldiers of the old army.
The other five had joined up early in the War. All had seen much
active service. Ross had served a year in Salonica and two years in
Mespot. Bessimer had nearly died from dysentery in Egypt.
Reid-Andover and Pirbright had been in Russia with Denikin.
McLagan, Treadway, and Dawbarn had spent the whole of their time in
France and Flanders. The reason of their meeting in this obscure
spot is of no consequence. It was in accordance with instructions
of certain higher authorities, who were apparently as unprepared
for the end of the War as they were for the beginning. It concerned
a report that was to be</p>

<p>drawn up upon the potentialities for military purposes of
certain by-products in local quarries. This was looking far ahead,
and now&mdash;well, the War was over. The 'vine having passed.
McLagan, who was the senior officer present, rose and said rather
huskily:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, the King!"</p>

<p>They all rose and barked in chorus: "The King!"</p>

<p>They drank the King's health, and then, as though the toast had
stirred them for the first time at some peculiar angle, making them
feel a little self-conscious, a little ashamed of this surprising
emotion, they began to task more animatedly.</p>

<p>Naturally they talked shop. They talked about "shows" and
blunders and guns, and old friends who had gone west. They appeared
diffident about discussing the future. They talked as though the
War was still going on.</p>

<p>Monsieur Poiret, who owned the ruined farmstead adjoining, had
supplied them with fowls and pork and vegetables. Their environment
was depressing, but the dinner was adequate. There was an unlimited
supply of fairly good red and white wine, and someone had produced
a bottle of brandy.</p>

<p>Pirbright and Dawbarn had only arrived that day, and were
strangers to the rest. But as the meal progressed, the whole
company found they had much in common. This was probably due to the
fact that in view of the nature of the enquiry they were called
upon to make, they were men of somewhat similar training,
experience, and education. In civilian life Pirbright and Bessimer
were both metallurgists. Reid-Andover was a fuel expert. Dawbarn
had done a lot of scientific research. Ross was a mining engineer.
McLagan and Treadway had been in the Geological department of the
Indian Army before the War.</p>

<p>Before the meal was finished they were discussing science and
moral philosophy, metaphysics, history, astronomy, sociology, and
even religion, the kind of subjects that are not habitually
discussed in an officers' mess. The meal being finished, and
cleared away, coffee was served and the bottle of brandy opened.
The table they were seated at was a circular one, and so it cannot
be said that anyone sat at the head of it. But if there was one man
who dominated it by force of personality that man was McLagan.</p>

<p>He was a big man with a long tapering jaw, dark reflecti?e eyes,
and black hair. Celt was written all over him. He was nicknamed
"The Wringer," and for this reason: he had a terrible grip. When he
shook hands he would bring tears into the eyes of the strongest,
and he was quite unconscious of it. He wore, moreover, a heavy
signet ring on his third finger, and after shaking hands with him
many a man would bear the impression of that ring upon his hand for
days. He was as animated a listener as he was talker. His eyes
wandered eagerly from one face to another as though he were drawing
them all together. He presided over them by an implied sense of
authority. His colleague, Treadway, sat on his right. He was a
typical officer of the modern school, tall, and almost too spare,
with close-cropped grey hair, sensitively modelled features, and
eyes whose gentleness and kindliness seemed to belie the profession
of arms. He listened, entranced by anything that McLagan said.</p>

<p>Bessimer was the only one of the company whose frame did not
seem too lean in that guttering candlelight, and even he looked fit
and hard in spite of greater girth, probably the result of taking
less exercise than the others. For he had an artificial leg. Ross
was a Scotsman, hollow-cheeked, and highly strung. He had a habit
of nodding his head constantly when spoken to, and mumbling
staccato acquiescence, as though anxious to agree and be done with
it. Reid-Andover, with his little clipped moustache and large
appealingly dark eyes, looked like a small dog with a biscuit on
its nose waiting for the words "Paid for!" He had left three
fingers of his right hand somewhere in Northern Russia.</p>

<p>Dawbarn was the oldest man present, quite grey and nearly bald.
His voice was almost inaudible and his eyes bloodshot, the result
of being gassed in Flanders. He made pathetic attempts to be gay
and to enter into the various arguments.</p>

<p>Pirbright was a poet. At least, he should have been a poet. He
was a man of abstractions, ideas, and visions. He loved to theorize
and speculate. He was the only one who talked of the future, and
even then with languid detachment. When someone mentioned the
Germans, he muttered: "Poor devils !" and lapsed into a reverie of
his own. He was tall and fair, with a large nose, the track of a
bullet along his left cheekbone, and a piece of his left ear
missing.</p>

<p>The evening wore on, and the men, huddling round the little
kerosene lamp, forgot the cold in the heat of argument. And they
talked of life and death and immortality. Each one of them, it was
found, believed in a life hereafter, but the manner in which man
was to survive, and the conditions of his future state, supplied
the matter for a spirited debate. The candles guttered in the
bottles, and others were produced. The rain had penetrated the roof
and dripped steadily into a pool in the corner. The brandy was
finished, but there was still plenty of tobacco and red wine.
McLagan did not smoke. He had a habit of leaning forward as he
spoke, with his large hands interlocked, and suddenly he would
throw back his head, disengage his hands, and emphasize a point by
shaking his index finger in the air. He made a Macabre figure
sitting there in the ill-lit barn, his dark eyes alight with a kind
of malicious excitement.</p>

<p>It was considerably past midnight when someone suggested that it
was time to turn in. McLagan had been silent for some time, deep in
thought. Suddenly he spoke:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, don't go for a moment. I want to make a
suggestion."</p>

<p>They all regarded him, and he leaned forward, peering into the
lamp.</p>

<p>"This is perhaps the most profound day in the history of human
life. It is hall-marked for posterity. It is an everlasting day. We
have all met under rather queer and exceptional circumstances. We
have talked of immortality. We are seven&mdash;a good Biblical
number. I suggest that in our fashion we immortalize this day."</p>

<p>He stopped, and the others watched him interestedly, expecting
him to go on, but he only continued to stare into the stove. At
last Bessimer said:</p>

<p>"In what way, McLagan?"</p>

<p>He looked up as though startled, and spoke quietly:</p>

<p>"Looking into the eyes of death every day for four years and a
half as we all have, we should go mad if we did not believe in the
Everlastingness of things. Let us form a club and demonstrate our
faith&mdash;just as seven."</p>

<p>He paused again, and Ross said:</p>

<p>"What kind of club, McLagan?"</p>

<p>"An Everlasting Club. Roughly speaking, I propose that we meet
on this date once a year in some remote place, like this barn. We
have a chairman and a secretary. We conduct it quite formally. We
dine perhaps, cooking our own food, for no stranger must be
present. Then afterwards we have a debate&mdash;some man putting
forward some new theory or record of experience or belief. We
discuss it in the manner we talked things over to-night. That is
all."</p>

<p>"But how would this be everlasting?" said Ross, nodding his head
jerkily. "We shall all die one at a time. Do you mean that when we
die another is elected in our place?"</p>

<p>"No," said McLagan. "That would be a negation of the idea. That
would be a concession that things are not everlasting."</p>

<p>And then he explained his idea of the Everlasting Club. The
others stared at him dumbfounded. The smoke from their pipes
trailed between them and away into the dim obscure corners of the
barn. A night bird screamed overhead, and McLagan went on talking.
Treadway gaped at him like one bewitched. Pirbright forgot to
smoke. Bessimer, Dawbarn, and Ross regarded him solemnly. Only Ross
appeared frankly cynical, nodding approval and speaking
disapproval.</p>

<p>"It's a mad idea, McLagan," he repeated more than once.
"Besides, it's dangerous. I wouldn't have anything to do with
it."</p>

<p>But when McLagan had finished his explanation, and the room
remained silent, except for the water dripping into the pool,
Pirbright stood up and said:</p>

<p>"I will join you for one, and I propose McLagan as President of
the Everlasting Club."</p>

<p>"And I will join," said Dawbarn, "and I second that
proposition."</p>

<p>"And I," whispered Reid-Andover huskily.</p>

<p>"I will join," said Bessimer, "if I do not have to return to
Egypt. I see no danger in it, Ross."</p>

<p>"No, no, not for me," said Ross. "I won't touch it."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Ross," said McLagan, "don't spoil our Biblical
number. Whatever danger can there be in it? It is only an
experiment, an experiment of faith. What else are we likely to
extract from this chaos? The War is over, but the troubles of the
poor old world are not over. Nevertheless, the whole thing may have
been worth while if out of the ashes emerges a knowledge of the
Everlasting."</p>

<p>"Knowledge!" gasped Ross. "I had an aunt once&mdash;in Edinburgh
it was&mdash;she had knowledge&mdash;she&mdash;she&mdash;went
mad!"</p>

<p>It is a remarkable tribute to the power of personality that
McLagan persuaded these other six men&mdash;including Ross in the
end&mdash;to join the astonishing club. Neither at first did there
appear to be anything so very astonishing about it. It appeared an
ordinary enough social club formed for the purposes of meeting once
a year&mdash;on Armistice Day&mdash;to debate, and discuss, and
establish a complete belief in the Everlasting. It did not meet for
two years, partly owing to the fact that Bessimer did go to Egypt
and Treadway had to return to India. But Bessimer again got fever
in Egypt and had to return to England the following summer.
Treadway retired from the Indian Army and came home at about the
same time. McLagan persuaded Treadway to take on the secretaryship,
and the first meeting was held on November 11th, 1920, in a
bungalow up on Leith Hill in Surrey. It was a disused bungalow on
an estate that had been left to McLagan by an uncle. The men had
all been interested in each other, and felt drawn together by the
associations of that historic evening in Picardy, and they fell in
with the idea eagerly, all with the exception of Ross, who went
down under protest, feeling, however, that he could not let his
comrades in.</p>

<p>The first meeting was quite an ordinary and cheery evening.
Except for the fact that the bungalow was waterproof, McLagan had
tried to reproduce as far as possible the same conditions as those
that prevailed in the barn in Picardy. They took food down with
them, which he and Treadway cooked. The room was lighted by candles
stuck in bottles, and warmed by a stove. Little Reid-Andover
created a round of laughter by saying that he only made one
stipulation about the Club, that was that he didn't have to have
his hand shaken by the president every time. They dined gaily,
talking of old times and friends, and drank red wine. When the meal
was finished they cleared the table and started the discussion.
Pirbright&mdash;by previous arrangement&mdash;read a brief but
thoughtful paper on "The Reasonableness of Re-Incarnation."
Bessimer spoke in opposition. Treadway, who wrote shorthand, took
down a summary of all the speeches. They were to be copied out and
embodied in the archives of the Club. Every member spoke in turn,
and McLagan gave a judicial summing up. Forgetting his
apprehensions in the excitement of debate, Ross spoke as eagerly as
anyone.</p>

<p>There would have been little to distinguish between this meeting
of the Everlasting Club and the next, had it not been that early in
the following autumn Dawbarn died. He caught a chill playing golf
one day in the rain, and, his lungs already affected by poison gas,
he contracted double pneumonia and died within three days. This
%vas in October, within three weeks of the next meeting of the
Everlasting Club. Now what was going to be McLagan's attitude? He
had made it pretty clear in his original explanation of the aims of
the Club. But how would it operate? Every man had signed a scroll
that under no circumstances would he miss a meeting, and that he
regarded it in very truth <i>as an Everlasting Club</i>. The
members were notified, and the meeting took place. It was the turn
of Ross to open the discussion.</p>

<p>He arrived late and was very much on edge, and his attention was
immediately riveted upon the empty chair that had been set for
Dawbarn; the empty chair, and the cutlery and glass, all as though
he were actually there. The others occupied their accustomed
places. He wanted to talk about Dawbarn, but some curious force
restrained him. He found that it was not the thing. You could talk
<i>to Dawbarn, but not about him</i>!</p>

<p>"Do you or do you not believe in the Everlasting?" a voice
seemed to whisper.</p>

<p>Dawbarn's absence was ignored. McLagan was in great spirits,
carrying in the fowl which he had roasted himself, making jokes
with Reid-Andover, proposing toasts. And all the time Ross's eye
kept wandering to the empty chair. He could almost see Dawbarn with
close-cropped hair and little bald head leaning over his plate. He
could almost hear his wheezy voice:</p>

<p>"My dear McLagan, my contention is&mdash;"</p>

<p>Treadway calmly read the minutes of the last meeting, as though
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>There was something terrible in the sinister assurance of
McLagan, and when in the course of the debate that followed he
suddenly turned to the empty chair and said:</p>

<p>"You will remember that at our last meeting, Dawbarn, you
referred to the Absolute&mdash;" Ross wanted to cry out. He could
not concentrate. Pirbright was also obviously overwrought, but the
others had succumbed to the spell of their chief. They carried on
the discussion with spirit and enthusiasm. The Everlasting Club
survived its first test.</p>

<p>In chronicling the activities of this remarkable Club, one must
make allowances for the unusual nature of its mental composition,
partly sentimental, partly ironic, partly genuinely interested in
psychological experiment, and wholly dominated by one strong and
dominating personality. The more Ross dreaded the meetings the more
keenly did he look forward to them, the more influenced was he by
the strange character of McLagan. Each meeting was like an entirely
novel experience, and productive of stimulating thought. It was
like an adventure on some uncharted island.</p>

<p>There were two meetings held around the empty chair of Dawbarn,
and then an even greater disaster befell the Club. Treadway was
killed in Ireland, and Bessimer died from blood-poisoning.</p>

<p>"That will leave four of us," Ross reflected shudderingly.
"Three empty chairs!"</p>

<p>The contemplation of three empty chairs seemed less disturbing
than the cold certainty of some ultimate and inevitable tragedy.
Ross was the youngest member of the Club, but his heart was weak.
When the four forgathered at the next meeting, his mind wavered
between the horror of two alternate visions. Perhaps next year his
chair would be empty, and still McLagan would be addressing him.
"You will remember, my dear Ross, that last year you
contended&mdash;" Would he be listening? Would he see the bubbles
in the wine poured out for him?...but there was a horror that he
dreaded more than that. He felt it coming, that inevitable
fate&mdash;to be the last to prove the Everlasting. The years
passed and Pirbright died.</p>

<p>And then Reid-Andover, Ross, and McLagan met and they looked
into each other's eyes without expressing the thoughts that lay
behind them. Four empty chairs! and Reid-Andover, who was now the
secretary, quickly read the minutes of the last meeting. The
records of the Club now formed quite a volume, and contained matter
that was in the nature of revelation, sacred to the members alone.
Nothing disturbed the equanimity of McLagan. He was more assured
than ever. Only his dark eyes searched the faces of the other two,
as though the only danger might lurk there.</p>

<p>The time had come when certain things had got to be said, and it
was McLagan's mission to say them. He leaned across the table and
gripped the hands of the other two men in his.</p>

<p>"Listen, you fellows," he said, "remember Treadway and Bessimer
both went the same year. It's possible two of us might go this. Let
us swear, whoever is left of us three, that he will see this
through to the end. This is an Everlasting Club. Swear! Swear!"</p>

<p>"God! I hope it won't be me," said Reid-Andover, "but I
swear."</p>

<p>"I swear, too," said Ross, his voice sounding faint and
distant.</p>

<p>"I swear," said McLagan firmly.</p>

<p>Reid-Andover had his wish gratified with dramatic suddenness,
for he was drowned the following autumn off the West Coast of
Scotland, his sailing-boat capsizing in a sudden gale.</p>

<p>"Now there's only McLagan," thought Ross, when he heard the
news. "I knew this would be. It was predestined. If only I could
die!"</p>

<p>He thought of going abroad, or writing to McLagan to say he
couldn't face it. But the more he desired to escape the closer he
felt bound to his obligations. He had promised. Besides, the
thought of betraying McLagan brought beads of perspiration to his
brow. It was he who held the book when they next met, and read the
minutes with as much control as he could display. Five empty
chairs! and McLagan never so buoyant. He had extended his spiritual
adventures. He had much to say, and there was much to be entered in
the book.</p>

<p>"On that night, Ross, in the barn at La Villanay, we little
thought we should get as far as this..."</p>

<p>He seized Ross's hand once more in his strong grip.</p>

<p>"One of us, Ross, will be the last. Swear on your honour, for
the last time perhaps, that if it is you who are left you will see
this thing through."</p>

<p>"I shall be the last," Ross replied hoarsely. "I feel it. It's
inevitable. I've known it from the first."</p>

<p>"Swear, then!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I swear...I swear."</p>

<p>They closed up the bungalow and left it for a year. And the next
year they met again. Ross had aged. His face was thin and drawn,
his expression preoccupied. He felt ill and overwrought. They went
through the usual formalities, lighting the candles, cooking a
modest meal, setting the table for the seven. They read the book,
and added to it.</p>

<p>A voice seemed to whisper to Ross: "I shall never see McLagan
again. But perhaps before the year is out I, too, shall have
gone."</p>

<p>They took the same vows over the book as before. As they were
parting McLagan said:</p>

<p>"Queer that the only thing the Great War has perpetuated
is&mdash;the Unknown. It is as though human society had reacted to
the clamour of its idols. In our hearts we preserve the conviction
of unknown faiths. In our temples we bury the&mdash;Unknown
Soldier. It is like starting all over again in our search for the
Everlasting."</p>

<p>One night in the late autumn McLagan was found dead in bed in an
hotel at Deauville. There was a certain amount of mystery
concerning his death. The tap of a gas-stove was turned on a
fraction of an inch, but whether this was accidental or intentional
no one could say. Death from misadventure was recorded. Ross heard
the news with equanimity. He was fully prepared for it. What
concerned him the more was the state of his own health. He
consulted a specialist, who affirmed that the condition of his
heart was serious. He should have a long and complete rest.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will a little later on," he said. To himself he
thought:</p>

<p>"I will not believe that McLagan ran away. He was not a coward.
In any case, I am under my vow."</p>

<p>October came and went, and the yellow leaves vanished on the
wind, dismantling the stage for the bleak and sombre entrance of
November. Ross checked the procession of eleven days, wherein
leaden skies, fog, rain, and darkness mingled in indivisible
proportion. When the eleventh day dawned, he thought to himself:
"And to think that it was this day so many years ago when the world
went nearly mad with joy! Where is it all gone, the sense of
relief, the spirit of brotherhood and forgiveness, that illumined
the face of humanity for twelve brief hours'</p>

<p>Of the task before him he felt little apprehension. His mind had
grown accustomed to it, and was more occupied with abstract
problems than with concrete fears. He filled a despatch case with
the records of the Everlasting Club. lie took wine with him and a
little food and set off for the bungalow in the hills. It was pitch
dark long before he got there.</p>

<p>He thrust the key into the rusty lock and stumbled in. He struck
matches and lighted the candles and the stove. He set the table,
and placed the seven chairs in position. He hummed to himself as he
grilled a small piece of steak. The mist drifted in between the
crevices of the windows and the door. The room seemed unnaturally
dark. He drank two glasses of the red wine, and when he had eaten
as much of the steak as he could, he stood up and said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, the King!"</p>

<p>He gulped the wine and glanced at the six empty chairs. There
they all seemed to be, watching him. Dawbarn and Pirbright, little
Reid-Andover, the solemn Bessimer, Treadway, elegant and urbane,
and more insistent than all&mdash;McLagan. He could almost hear
McLagan's sardonic laugh, and see the dark eyes checking his
movements.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, the Everlasting Club !"</p>

<p>He drank this second toast in grim silence. The boards creaked,
and he thought he heard a mouse or rat gnawing in the
wainscoting.</p>

<p>He read the minutes of the last meeting, stressing to the full
the balanced logic and the argument as promulgated by the
president. He gave a brief summary of his own comments. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"Is it your wish, gentlemen, that these minutes be passed?"</p>

<p>He glanced round the table and accepted the uncanny silence as
consent. He signed them, and then rose once more to open the last
debate. He spoke precisely as though all the other members were
present. He struggled to concentrate on the abstraction of their
united experiences. Once he thought he heard rain dripping into a
pool in the corner of the room, and that he&mdash;and
they&mdash;were back once more in the barn at La Villanay on
Armistice night. He felt a sudden desire to scream. He wanted to
scream into the growing obscurity across the table to McLagan:</p>

<p>"You fool!...You fool!...don't you know it yet? There's no such
thing as the Everlasting. Everything changes."</p>

<p>He gazed wild-eyed at McLagan's chair, and a cold fear settled
on his heart.</p>

<p>He pulled himself upright, and muttered:</p>

<p>"All right, McLagan, all right. I promised."</p>

<p>He struggled on till the candles guttered in the bottles and the
stove went out. Suddenly he threw himself forward and stretched his
right arm out in the direction of McLagan's chair.</p>

<hr>

<p>A gardener on the estate found him next morning lying face
downwards on the table, his right arm stretched out. And the
gardener noticed that the fingers of his hand were pressed closely
together, as though they had been held in a powerful grip, and on
two of the fingers was a mark that might have been indented by a
metal ring. By his side were the charred remnants of a book.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. Glittering Prizes</h2>

<p>The secretary, seated at the bureau, pen in hand, listened
alertly to the dictates of his chief. Now and then he would glance
at him furtively, his eyes filled with a kind of dread and
admiration. There was something fascinating in the man's sense of
power.</p>

<p>He stood with his back to the fireplace, his legs wide apart,
his eyes frowning at the carpet. It was characteristic of him that
he hardly revised a phrase, for he did not speak until it was
clear-cut in his mind. Between the puffs at his pipe he spoke
slowly and deliberately, every word carefully weighed.</p>

<p>He was a big man, of athletic build, with a clean-shaven face
that must have been extremely handsome in youth, and even now,
somewhere midway between forty and fifty, retained classic
proportions, and was only marked by the stresses of life and that
slight heaviness and over-emphasis which usually denote strength of
character. And yet there was about the eyes an enigmatic quality, a
certain sleepy cynicism, as of one who has spent his life amongst
inferiors whom he has learnt to despise. The draft finished, he
said:</p>

<p>"That will do, Bramscott. Have it typed out and let me see it
half an hour before the Minister comes."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What have I on now till he comes at twelve?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir. I imagined the draft would take you longer."</p>

<p>The secretary bowed, as though apologising for his subtle
compliment, collected the sheets of paper, and retired. Sir Ernest
refilled his pipe. Nothing on, eh? a strange experience for one who
boasted of never having a moment free in the twenty-four hours. But
still, one need never be idle. He advanced to the bureau, and as he
did so an under-secretary entered and handed him a card,
saying:</p>

<p>"This gentleman has no appointment, sir, but he wants to know
whether you can spare him a few minutes on an important
matter."</p>

<p>"What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't say, sir. He said you knew him. You were at
Winchester together."</p>

<p>Sir Ernest took up the card and examined it. On it was printed:
"Mr. Alfred Voysey."</p>

<p>He examined it carefully and pondered. The name conveyed nothing
to him. Now, was this the man Raikes had promised to send him with
information about those South American oil concessions&mdash;Raikes
said he would send him unannounced&mdash;or was it the same old
story, some broken-down Wykehamist come to borrow money, exploiting
the sentimental associa-don of the old school? He detested casual
visits, and cadgers, and this was to be one of the most important
days so far in his career. But, still&mdash;he had a few minutes to
spare. The fellow might have come from Raikes. He said
perfunctorily:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, show him in."</p>

<p>The secretary retired and in a few moments showed in a tall,
thin man, about his own age. His hair was rather long, untidy and
grey; his lined, rather pathetic face that of a dreamer. His
clothes were just not frayed. He was wearing a long brown ulster,
in his hand he carried a cloth cap.</p>

<p>"He <i>has</i> come to borrow!" thought Sir Ernest.</p>

<p>When the door was closed, the unwelcome individual said
timidly:</p>

<p>"It's very good of you to see me, Darlington. Do you remember
me? We were at Mr. Alston's house together for one term. It was my
last term and your first. I must be four years older than you."</p>

<p>"No, I don't remember you. What is it you want to see me
about?"</p>

<p>"To be quite candid, I'm most frightfully hard up. I have a wife
and two children, and I don't know where to turn to raise money to
buy their food."</p>

<p>Sir Ernest was annoyed. His first instinct was to give the
fellow a pound and get rid of him. But he was angry, more with
himself than with his visitor. He felt that he had been weak. A few
pounds one way or the other would make no difference to himself.
But why should he? He was all opposed to the principle of
promiscuous charity. It was not that he would begrudge the money,
it was the sense of being tricked. He should have known for certain
that the fellow had only called to borrow money. He didn't want to
be bothered with it. It was a sordid and stupid incident, holding
no place in the glittering programme of his day. He said
curtly:</p>

<p>"What work do you do?"</p>

<p>"I have been many things&mdash;a clerk, a reviewer, a writer of
lyrics, many things. My father was a publisher. He went bankrupt.
I've had no work for months."</p>

<p>Sir Ernest looked at the man witheringly. His mind could not
help registering an abrupt comparison. Here was this fellow with
his vague pale eyes, his rather weak chin and narrow chest&mdash;"a
clerk, a reviewer, a writer of lyrics." God! what a life! Here was
he, massive, powerful and successful, all the world at his feet.
Well, hadn't he worked for it? What was life but a struggle to
survive, the race to the swift, the battle to the strong? His jaw
set. He thought to himself: "No, I'm hanged if I will!" Out loud he
said bitingly:</p>

<p>"I really don't see what it's got to do with me. You had no
right to bluff your way in here to beg."</p>

<p>"I didn't bluff my way, Darlington. I merely asked to see you. I
thought that as we were at school together&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, cut all that out! You're simply taking advantage of it. Why
should I give you money? I know nothing about you. I have plenty of
calls on my charity. When I want to give, I like to choose my own
objects of charity. I'm not going to be wheedled by any stranger
who says he was at school with me."</p>

<p>The man lurched a little nearer.</p>

<p>"But I'm willing to work, Darlington. It's a serious matter. You
in your position probably can't realize what it is to be poor,
really poor, when it's a question of bread for those you love. You
have so much&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sir Ernest brought his hand down sharply on the lid of the
bureau.</p>

<p>"What I have is nothing to do with it. What I've made I've
fought for in the open. You say you were at school with me. Right.
That postulates the fact that we started with equal opportunities.
I've got on and you've failed. Why? Because I've worked and tried,
and made sacrifices and you haven't."</p>

<p>"Men are made differently," stammered the visitor.</p>

<p>"Suppose I give you a few pounds," continued Sir Ernest,
ignoring him, "what's the good of it? In a few days you will have
spent it. You'll be no better off. It's no kind of solution. It's
anti-social. It's all wrong."</p>

<p>"Oh, but&mdash;Darlington, in the meanwhile,
I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sir Ernest was losing his temper.</p>

<p>"Pressed as I am by a hundred important matters, I very much
resent this kind of intrusion. This is a very important day with
me. I particularly resent this playing down to the sentimental
association of schooldays."</p>

<p>He pressed a bell, and a tall butler entered.</p>

<p>"Show this gentleman out, please."</p>

<p>The visitor slunk away and vanished. The secretary re-entered
with some papers. Sir Ernest was immersed until the arrival of the
Minister at twelve o'clock. The distasteful episode was dismissed
from his mind. He spent a joyous hour with his elderly chief,
conscious of the impression he was making on him by the cold logic
of his reason, and the skilled manipulation of written phrases. The
old gentleman was delighted with him, and complimented him more
than once. Sir Ernest smiled ingratiatingly. There was nothing
about those dark eyes to betray the cynical reflection.</p>

<p>"Yes, my friend. When the moment is ripe I shall oust you from
your place. I, Ernest Darlington."</p>

<p><br>
The interview over, he said to his visitor:</p>

<p>"Will you stop to lunch, sir?"</p>

<p>No, the Minister thanked him profusely, but he was committed to
lunch at home. When he had gone, the secretary, rustling with
papers, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will you be lunching at home, sir? Lady Darlington has a small
party. You are due at the House at two-thirty."</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, well, I might as well. A man must feed somewhere."</p>

<p>Secretly he enjoyed surprising his family. He saw little of his
wife. He was submerged in his work and ambitions, she in social and
charitable claims. They had little in common, but he still admired
her rather sculpturesque beauty, with the clean-cut lines hinting
at her romantic origin. She was a daughter of one of the oldest
Scottish peers. He enjoyed the sensation of his rather late
arrival, the scarcely hushed expressions of surprise: his daughter
was there too, a rather plain girl, heavily built. Also a colonel,
two young cadets, a half a dozen others. He liked to watch the shy,
eager faces of the young men, to be conscious of their deference to
him. They would talk about him, and afterwards it would give them
pleasure to say to their friends:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you know, Sir Ernest himself was there!"</p>

<p>It gave him a pleasant feeling to select plain things out of a
rather elaborate menu, a cutlet, some cheese, and a pear; to drink
water when the young men were drinking wine; and to jump up before
the meal was finished and exclaim:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must excuse me. I am due at the House at two-thirty."</p>

<p>The House! It was there in this somewhat drab assembly that the
glitter was most dazzling. Late that afternoon he had to make an
eagerly awaited speech in the defence of the Government. Much was
expected of him, and he knew that he had the power. Every paper in
the country would report his speech to-morrow. His partisans would
praise him; the Opposi tun would criticize&mdash;possibly sneer at
him. What did it matter? On every tongue would be the name "Ernest
Darlington!" Even his enemies would not deny his cleverness.</p>

<p>Power&mdash;power&mdash;he loved the familiar tokens of his
welcome, the policemen touching their hats, the toadies in the
lobby, the sense of being watched and remarked about. And then
conspicuously, before a group of members, the cordial welcome by
his chief; the private conference in a Committee room, which he
dominated by force of personality.</p>

<p>Came the most insidious glitter of all&mdash;the debate itself.
As he lolled back on the Government benches, his hat tilted at an
insolent angle, his face expressing utter disdain and boredom, he
knew that hundreds of eyes were fixed on him. He knew that the
rumour had gone round: "Darlington is going to reply to the
motion."</p>

<p>It was not difficult to forecast the line of argument that would
be adopted by the Opposition, but he listened alertly, making
mental notes of weaknesses and discrepancies. At length his moment
came. He was upon his feet, to a roar of welcome from his party,
and packed benches all over the House.</p>

<p>He began quietly, as a pained father might speak to a
recalcitrant child. Then he spoke with cold incisiveness, quoting
figures, as though he were adjudging the issue with the detachment
of abstract logic, as though the case were of little concern to
himself, but was merely a pronouncement of unarguable evidence.
Then his voice warmed with a note of passion. He was appealing for
the broad interests of his fellow-citizens. He referred scathingly
to the narrow outlook of the leaders opposite.</p>

<p>Sometimes he received an interruption, sometimes a roar of
applause that appeared to come from all parts of the House. When
the need for concentration was less vital, and he could see the end
of his argument in sight, his mind for a moment reeled with a
drunken sense of elation. He had got them. Another big step up the
ladder of success had been reached. That which he had fought for
all his life was reaching a climax.</p>

<p>Power&mdash;power&mdash;power. "The race to the swift; the
battle to the strong!"</p>

<p>He rounded his speech off like an accomplished craftsman,
leaving the climax to tell its tale, and ending on a note of
respect towards the House, of chivalry towards his opponents.</p>

<p><br>
When it was over he mingled with his colleagues, drinking in their
praises, sensing the herd thought which dominated the group,
presaging avidly the next move in the game. The game! Never for one
instant was he oblivious to the consciousness that the whole thing
was a game. The thrill of the chase was upon him, the frenzy of the
hunter, the will to superimpose one type upon another. Men clever
as himself forgathered in another room, and planned the next phase
of the hunt. And they spoke earnestly, only their eyes sometimes
shifted with uneasy questionings, as much as to say:</p>

<p>"Are you in the game with us? or are you playing a game of your
own?"</p>

<p>The discussion over, he strolled into the corridors and there
ran into Cairn liven, the newspaper magnate and millionaire.</p>

<p>"Ah! Darlington," said the latter. "Many, many congratulations.
You routed them single-handed. We are meeting at dinner to-night. I
believe at the Duke of Shropshire's."</p>

<p>"To-night?" muttered Sir Ernest abstractedly. He had not
forgotten, but it tickled his vanity to appear indifferent to the
aged Duke's invitation.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, the Duke is most anxious you should come. You know
who else is coming? Mark Breitenstein, the Canadian; owns half Nova
Scotia, you know."</p>

<p>Niven's eyes narrowed, searching his face eagerly. Cairn liven
had a game to play, the old Duke also. Why were they so anxious for
him to go? He smiled knowingly. There would, of course, in days to
come be contracts, concessions, bartering, compromise. When he had
power&mdash;his brain envisaged many faces such as Cairn Niven's in
the days to come, dangling before him the lure of untold
wealth&mdash;if he only cared to be just a little unscrupulous. But
no, no, that was not part of his game. Nevertheless, he said
cordially:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course, Niven, I am coming. For the moment I had
forgotten."</p>

<p><br>
In Palace Yard he dismissed his car, telling the man to pick him up
at Shropshire House at a quarter to twelve. He felt the need of
mental relaxation. He turned westward and wandered along the
Embankment. It was a March evening, with already a tang of Spring
in the air. The sky was like a pale gauze mantle trying to hide the
almost invisible stars. The river was mysteriously alive with magic
lights and slow-moving dark objects.</p>

<p>When he had walked some distance he turned and regarded the
vague outlines of the towers of Westminster and the vast confusion
of buildings wherein operated the nerve force which directed the
destinies of a mighty and ancient empire. The sense of its might
and its antiquity became overpowering, more overpowering in this
silent and remote coign of vantage than within the precincts of the
building itself. Big Ben struck, and he reeled slightly like a man
drunk with the riches of his own ego. His heart vibrated:</p>

<p>"Power and antiquity and tradition&mdash;and to-morrow everyone
will be talking of me."</p>

<p>He sat clown on a bench, as though unable to bear the burden of
this overpowering revelation. And as he sat there, there strolled
towards him two figures. At first he was too preoccupied to notice
them. But as they came under the light of the lamp he could not but
observe that they were lovers. The man was a pale young clerk or
mechanic, and the girl, who was hatless, was slim and pretty of her
kind, with large grey eyes and a narrow oval face. His arm was
around her shoulders, and hers around his waist. He could see the
lovelight in her eyes, and the man's were almost tearful in their
dumb adoration.</p>

<p>His preoccupations were eclipsed. They never turned to glance at
him. Power, antiquity, tradition. What did they care? They were
probably going home to some poor haunt at Battersea or Chelsea.
Tomorrow all the world would be talking of him. What did they care?
They passed and left him staring at the dark wall that lined the
Embankment, as though some sudden strange doubt had entered his
heart. For a minute or two he sat there, frowning into nothingness.
Then he stood up, and lighting a cigar, walked briskly
eastwards.</p>

<p><br>
The dinner at the old Duke of Shropshire's was an unqualified
success. Covers were laid for eighteen, and His Grace himself was
in his most genial and reminiscent mood, relating stories of all
the celebrities of the mid-Victorian era from the Empress Eugénie
to General Gordon and Disraeli.</p>

<p>Cairn liven, with his little clipped moustache and ingratiating
voice, was making himself charming to the Duchess. The great Mark
Breitenstein was a little bewildered and taciturn. He was a man
with a large square head, strong jaw, and keen pale eyes. He ate
little and drank less, and his attitude seemed to be:</p>

<p>"Come, let's get on with it. Let's get rid of these women and
get down to brass tacks."</p>

<p>Sir Ernest was in no hurry for this diversion. It was the hour
when he allowed himself to relax. He realized that he was hungry,
and he did full justice to the Duke's good foods and ancient
vintages. He enjoyed being conspicuous in so glittering a company
by exercising the prerogative of the House in wearing an ordinary
lounge suit. The House was still sitting, and he liked to give the
impression that any minute he might be called away&mdash;a most
unlikely contingency, he knew.</p>

<p>Moreover, he found himself placed next to a well-known Society
beauty&mdash;Lady Muriel Lough-Waterspon, an enchanting creature,
who talked about him, and flattered him, and flirted with him
through the whole dinner. And Sir Ernest sparkled as only he could
sparkle, when the hour was ripe and the conditions attuned to his
mood. He had never met Lady Muriel before, but, of course, they
knew of each other, and there was for this reason a pleasant sense
of familiarity between them. Each was playing the same game, with
its thrills and dangers, penalties and prizes. His senses quickened
as he glanced round the table, and became aware of the many eyes
riveted upon them, of many heads nodding knowingly, and of faces
expressing:</p>

<p>"Sir Ernest and Lady Muriel&mdash;what a couple! They seem to be
enjoying themselves. I wonder&mdash;"</p>

<p>When the dinner was over the Duke found it difflicult to detach
him, so engrossed was he with his partner. The old gentleman
eventually had to go himself and dig him out from an annexe of one
of the reception rooms, where he was still talking and exchanging
imponderable trifles with glitter and abandon.</p>

<p>"Darlington, it distresses me to make this unwelcome and
unwarranted intrusion, but my friend Breitenstein is most anxious
to have your opinon on a trifling matter. My dear Muriel, you have
slain so many innocents, please postpone the slaughter of this one
for half an hour."</p>

<p>A delicious moment, not only to stoop and kiss her hand&mdash;a
most un-English proceeding&mdash;not only to detect the shadow of
disappointment on her face, but to see her eyes gleam, impressed
with his importance. To be dragged from her presence by a duke, to
talk politics. Oh, delicious!</p>

<p>Delicious to feign boredom when a millionaire is talking to you,
appealing to you subtly about his interests. Delicious to see
through him, and the other two men in this new game, to answer
evasively and yet to show a complete grasp of the subject. He saw
Breitenstein watching him like a fox-terrier at a rabbit hole. How
he could use these men when the power was his! He stored up in his
brain the information they gave him, and committed himself to
promises which he could easily modify in the future.</p>

<p>They talked till nearly midnight, talked till a real sense of
weariness crept over him. He excused himself on the strength of
work to-morrow. Secretly he promised himself a last half-hour with
Lady Muriel, perhaps the adventure of taking her home. But when he
returned to the drawing&mdash;room she had gone.</p>

<p>"She has gone on to a dance, Sir Ernest," said the Duchess.</p>

<p><br>
He was disappointed. He felt badly treated. Why could she not have
waited for him? He was unaccustomed to people who did not pursue
him. In the car on the way home he reflected upon the insincerity
and frailty of women. And yet he was bound to admit that he would
have done the same himself. He served his own purposes the whole
time, regardless of others. So did Lady Muriel. The reflection did
not raise his spirits, or soften his feeling of disappointment and
ill-usage. He wondered apathetically whether his wife and daughter
would be at home.</p>

<p>Arrived there he recognized by the silence of the house that
they were either in bed or out. He went into the library and rang a
bell. A butler entered.</p>

<p>"Are Lady Darlington and Miss Diana out, Jacques?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, they've gone to a ball, sir, I believe at the
American Embassy."</p>

<p>No change of expression passed over his face, but with an
impatient gesture he dismissed the butler, then lighted another
cigar and poured himself out a whisky and soda. The great library
with its many projections and recesses seemed incredibly silent
after the turmoil of the day. Upon the table by the fireplace were
the evening newspapers. He picked up one. In a flaming headline
across the top of the front page were the words: "Darlington hits
out." He smiled with grim satisfaction. He glanced at the
sub-headlines and read the résumé of his speech. Quite
satisfactory. Neither was he perturbed by the headlines of the
Opposition papers. "The old shibboleths." What did it matter? The
speech was treated just as importantly. It was all in the game to
say that.</p>

<p>When he had read through the paper's account of his speech he
sat back and dreamt of the future&mdash;all the world at his feet.
There flashed before his mind the faces of his fellow Ministers, of
his friends, of Lady Muriel and others&mdash;praising him, praising
him or regarding him with envy. Little remarks they had made were
stored up in his memory. Ha, ha! "Darlington hits out!"</p>

<p>The cigar went out and he threw the stump away. A feeling of
lassitude crept over him. He felt almost too tired to go up to bed.
The room seemed to be getting dimmer, the recesses deeper in
shadow. Books, with their voices whispering across the years, are
the harbourers of ghosts.</p>

<p>What a fool he was! He who had never flinched in the face of any
enemy; he who had fought and won in the great battle; he who did
not believe in any nonsense of that sort. It was simply
that&mdash;over there in that corner facing the fireplace&mdash;the
room seemed to have unpleasant associations. What were they? He
scowled into the obscurity and passed his hand over his jet-black
hair. Of course, what nonsense!&mdash;that fellow who had called in
the morning to borrow money. He had stood there. Well, that matter
was done with, and finished. His conscience was perfectly clear.
And yet he did not feel anxious to go to bed.</p>

<p>He sat down once more and picked up the evening paper. What else
was happening? Did anything else in the world matter beyond his
speech?</p>

<p>He glanced at the headlines&mdash;foreign politics, murder
trials, divorces, an earthquake in Japan, a small war in the Near
East. No, nothing of any consequence or interest. He turned to the
stop-press news. Still nothing. And then, just below, his eyes
caught sight of a tiny paragraph: "An unknown man, wearing a brown
ulster and a grey cloth cap, was knocked down and killed by a motor
lorry in the Blackfriars Road this afternoon."</p>

<p>Sir Ernest started and glanced involuntarily at the corner of
the room which had engaged his attention so mysteriously just
before he picked up the paper. A curious cold tremor seemed to pass
from the back of his head right down to the base of his spine. He
stood up and groped towards the fireplace, as though impelled to
seek protective measures&mdash;the poker, eh?</p>

<p>Gad! what a fool! He was himself again before he had reached it.
His clear brain had destroyed the miasma. Of course it was all just
silly. He was tired. It was no business of his. He was under no
obligation to give the fellow money. It was no fault of his if he
got run over. An accident? Well, what had he said? Let's see. No,
no, he had said he had a wife and child. A man wouldn't a wife and
child practically starving. Dash it all! What was the fellow's
name?</p>

<p>He couldn't remember. He had had enough to memorize that day.
But he had given him a card. What had he done with it? Abruptly he
remembered that immediately the fellow had gone out he had thrown
it on the fire in a mood of irritation.</p>

<p>He had said that they were at Winchester together. The old
school&mdash;hang it! He had no right to exploit it. A man who
truckles to sentimental whims gets nowhere. Sir Ernest squared his
jaw. That which had made him what he was leapt forward as if in
defence of his life's work. Casually he lit a cigarette and as
though in challenge to this sinister attack he walked to the door
and turned out all the lights. Then he strolled back calmly to the
fireplace and stood there with his back to it, legs wide apart in
the defiant attitude that he invariably adopted. He put his arms
behind him and scowled into the darkness.</p>

<p>"Well," he muttered, "what about it?"</p>

<p>He twirled the cigarette in the corner of his mouth and waited,
as though expecting an answer from some invisible agency. The red
embers of the fire cast the shadow of his legs across the carpet,
until they merged into the general obscurity. The fire crackled
gently, but no other sound came to break the silence. The books,
jealously guarding the wisdom of all the ages, had nothing to say.
No ghost spoke. The thin lines around Sir Ernest's nostrils,
denoting a contempt for human frailty, if not indeed contempt for
human nature itself, became accentuated. His yes challenged the
darkness and in his heart he laughed derisively, as the phrase
recurred to him: "Darlington hits out!"</p>

<p>As though observed by a large company of his fellow-beings he
finished his cigarette with studied nonchalance, and threw the end
into the fire. But he did not turn his back to the place where the
man had stood that morning. Then he strolled casually from the
room.</p>

<p>It was not till he reached his bedroom that he reacted to the
feelings of relief. He was indeed a little unstrung, victorious but
less certain of himself.</p>

<p>The white-panelled bedroom, with its chintz curtains, satinwood
furniture and cunningly modulated lights, failed to comfort him
entirely. He was master of his fate, and yet in the construction of
that fate there seemed something missing, like the very cornerstone
itself. He undressed quickly and went to bed. He tried to read, but
his mind refused to concentrate. He closed the book and turned out
the light.</p>

<p>He sometimes flattered himself that he had a quality in common
with Napoleon&mdash;the power to sleep at will. But possibly there
were nights when even Bonaparte could not sleep, when even he lay
awake questioning in his heart the dictates of his star of
destiny.</p>

<p>Certainly Sir Ernest could not sleep. He struggled fitfully to
piece together the memories of his first term at Winchester. But
no, no, it was all vague, an obscure, unhappy time compared with
the brilliant successes at work and sport that crowned his last
three years. And then came Oxford, where he became a byword.</p>

<p>"What's the good of going in for that? Darlington's entered for
it!"</p>

<p>And then the Bar. Everything, everything lying in wait for him,
coming so easily. Even his marriage with the eldest daughter of
Scotland's leading peer&mdash;was it not the envy of all his
colleagues? Was it not like Darlington? Was there ever such a
gifted, lucky fellow?</p>

<p>Dozing he saw the panoply of his marriage at St. Margaret's, the
glamour of Courts and of those who sit in high places, mingled with
the roar of applause at his first election address&mdash;wine! And
across this cut other visions&mdash;his mother, long since dead,
propped up by his side in a one-horse Victoria down at the old
place at Dalehurst, giving him homely advice about his digestive
organs and his God. Dear soul!</p>

<p>And then in later years that girl at Oxford&mdash;what was her
name? Lola? Lola, yes, that was it. An absurd name, but a nice
girl, the daughter of a book-seller. They loved each other
passionately the two terms before he went down. "Absurd! absurd!"
protested the wearying spirit. But her memory was very sweet. She
wore a lilac frock and they went for rambles in the meadows, and he
would meet her at night along the tow-path by the river. And when
he had become violent in his passionate entreaties, she had wept
and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Ernest, let me keep memories of you as I have at
present&mdash;pure, and sweet, and unspoilt. You could make me
happy, but I could never make you happy, dear, for I could not hold
you."</p>

<p>And he could see her eyes melting to him in the moonlight, and
oh! they haunted him for months. But he knew that she was wiser
than he, and he had pulled himself together, and kissed her
reverently. And when he had left her at her father's gate he had
looked back and seen her standing there, her hair all awry, her
lips parted, and her eyes blinded with tears...</p>

<p>The great world had held out its arms to him. And like the
strong man that he was, he had mastered the calls of these immature
emotions. He had never seen that girl again.</p>

<p>He kept repeating to himself:</p>

<p>"When to-morrow comes I shall be myself. I am dog-tired."</p>

<p>He tried to concentrate on to-morrow's work, to-morrow's
glamour, but he was constantly disturbed by outside visions. Above
all others, there was one that constantly recurred&mdash;the fair,
slim girl and her pale young lover, walking by the banks of the
river, too absorbed in each other to notice him, utterly
indifferent to the glittering prizes while they had each other. He
tried to follow them to their meagre nest in the suburbs. He tried
to share the prize that they had won, but it eluded him.</p>

<p>It was nearly dawn when he fell into a fitful sleep.</p>

<p>He had no idea how long he had slept, when his dreams were
suddenly irrupted by a scream. All his faculties were instantly
awake. The scream came from his wife's bedroom. Like a flash he was
out of bed, and across the room, and into the next. In the dim
light he was aware of two figures struggling. He snatched at the
electric-light switch and turned it on just in time to see his wife
fall, struck by some implement in the hand of a man. Her jewels
were scattered on the floor. With a growl Sir Ernest sprang at him,
and struck him senseless with his fist. The house was immediately
in a pandemonium. His daughter and the servants came hurrying down
the corridors. A doctor was telephoned for. The burglar was handed
over to the police.</p>

<p>Lady Darlington lay on the bed unconscious. A long wound
extended from the side of her head to her chin. She groaned feebly
as they bathed it. The mind of Sir Ernest reacted to the thrust of
this surprising experience. It was the kind of experience which one
reads about, one that happens to vague shadowy others, but which
one cannot associate with oneself. He tingled with the shock and
excitement of it, feeling almost exultant. The events of the
previous twenty-four hours faded into insignificance. He roamed
from one room to the other, while the doctor was dressing his
wife's wound, a cave man defending his own.</p>

<p>When she regained consciousness he sat by the bed, holding her
hand and murmuring little phrases of sympathy. He comforted and
reassured his daughter, who had shown symptoms of fainting. When
the day came he bathed, breakfasted, and only prepared to take up
his duties when fully assured that his wife's life was out of
danger, and that everything was being done to alleviate her
pain.</p>

<p>In the days that followed his work was somewhat affected by
personal preoccupation. If she had died! The analysis of his own
emotions began to surprise him. Custom is apt to dull our powers of
analysis. Gina led her life, and he led his. But she was always
there, a familiar and beautiful figure.</p>

<p>His symptoms were quickened by the knowledge imparted to him by
the doctor a week later. The scar would always remain. His wife was
disfigured for life. It was not his fault. He had indeed possibly
saved her life. And yet he felt responsible. If he had considered
her more, looked after her more&mdash;it was proved that the thief
had been following her movements carefully for some time&mdash;it
might never have occurred.</p>

<p>Whenever he could snatch an interval from his work he would go
to her room and regard her wonderingly. And his heart was filled
with an intense pity. He could see the pathos in her eyes, the
pathos and the pride. For she came of the kind who do not complain.
And as the weeks passed, the lesson came home to him that Gina,
brilliant, sought after and successful, was a cold image which held
for him no attractions; but Gina, broken and pathetic, stirred
within him emotions so profound that she seemed essential to his
very soul.</p>

<p>More and more would he leave his work and social demands to sit
and talk with her. And sometimes he would read to her, and discuss
his aims and ambitions. And she watched him and wondered too,
wondered why after all these years of neglect he should turn to her
when she was broken.</p>

<p>And one night she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ernest, I sometimes think you waste too much time with me. I
mustn't interfere with your career. They all say the same of you.
You have the whole world at your feet, dear. There is no prize you
might not win."</p>

<p>He took her hands and held them pressed against his temples, as
he whispered back:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear&mdash;my dear. It is only through suffering we
learn. We are all so apt to stretch out our hands towards prizes
that glitter far away, and then to miss the only prize worth
while."</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>10. The Baby Grand</h2>

<p>When the Gabril family first came to live in Camden Town, Gabril
was not their name. They were reputed to have come from Silesia,
and to have arrived with a name that was quite beyond the
capabilities of the neighbourhood to pronounce. Some genius
invented the name of Gabril for them, and it was probably a
contraction of a more grandiose nomenclature. They were of Jewish
stock, but had long ceased to practise or conform to any religious
creed. It may almost be said that they had ceased to conform to any
creed at all. They were a thoroughly unpleasant family. Solomon
Gabril, the father, was a piano-tuner. He had been married twice,
and both his wives had died. By his first wife he had two sons and
two daughters&mdash;Paul, Mischa, Selma, and Katie. By his second
wife, one daughter, Lena.</p>

<p>At the time when this story commences, Paul and Mischa were in
the early twenties, Selma was eighteen, Katie seventeen, and Lena
thirteen. They lived in three rooms and a scullery in a dingy house
in Benthal Street. Solomon was a thoroughly competent piano-tuner,
otherwise it is quite certain that the eminent firm of piano
manufacturers in Kentish Town would not have tolerated him. He was
dirty, untidy, wheezy, and vacillating. He indulged in drinking
bouts, when nothing would be seen of him for days. When sober his
manner was ingratiating, and somewhat facetious. He had a perpetual
sneering grin. He was, however, not entirely without feeling, and
not entirely a fool.</p>

<p>He was not capable of studied cruelty. He wished well towards
his family, and would give them the best of everything, if it
hadn't been that there was barely enough for his own indulgences,
and self came first. He paid the rent, allowed Selma, the eldest
girl, a sufficient sum weekly to buy the bare necessities of life
for the rest, and he never struck the children. It cannot be said
that either of his sons had so good a character. Paul was frankly
what is known as "a bad egg." He had been to prison twice for petty
thefts. He never kept a situation for more than a few weeks. He was
idle, depraved, and quarrelsome. Mischa was less objectionable than
his brother. He was quieter, had never been convicted in crime, but
was phlegmatic, morose, and stupid. He worked in a candle
factory.</p>

<p>Selma was a narrow strip of a girl, with eyes too close
together. She surreptitiously spent money meant for the food of the
family on trinkets. She was supposed to manage the household, and
to do the cooking and cleaning, and, during such time as she could
spare from the local picture-house, she did make some sort of
effort in this direction. She was furtive and selfish.</p>

<p>Katie, who did various odd jobs in teashops and private houses,
was more like her brother Mischa. She was of the flaccid kind, and
sighed her way through the dreary monotony of her days.</p>

<p>The whole family lived in a continuous state of hunger and
irritation, with the exception of Mr. Gabril, who was not
particularly interested in eating, but who always managed to get a
good dinner every day at a coffee-shop, and who drank sufficient
beer both to feed himself and to keep him in a static condition of
oleaginous indifference to the troubles of others.</p>

<p>Being, as it were, engrafted on to this deplorable family tree,
one may readily imagine that the conditions and prospects of the
youngest child, Lena, were anything but roseate. She was quite
obviously different from the rest. Her mother had been a singer who
died at Lena's birth. The child had a broad plump face, and dark
brown reflective eyes. She was curiously reserved, and she endured
the insults and bullying of her sisters, and the cuffs of her elder
brother, with almost uncanny fortitude, as though when all was said
and done she was stronger than they; as though she had enduring
treasures to defend.</p>

<p>She was sent to the local church school, more with the idea of
getting her out of the way, and keeping her out of mischief, than
with benefiting her with the liberal education obtainable at that
institution. Having bundled her off to school, the family interest
in her education and progress vanished. But it was instilled into
her in early life that she was the only one who contributed nothing
to the general upkeep of the house, and that the sooner she grew up
and went out and earned her living the better it would be for her.
She slept in one bedroom with the two step-sisters, the three men
occupied the other, whilst the third room was dubbed facetiously
"the parlour" by Mr. Gabril. It was the room where the whole family
congregated, fed, quarrelled, and indulged in whatever recreations
were available. It was furnished with a dilapidated sofa, four cane
chairs, two packing cases used as chairs, a deal table, a fitted
cupboard, an oleograph of King Edward as an admiral, and several
coloured plates taken from Christmas numbers. It had a smell of its
own, in which fish, cabbage, smoke, drying clothes, and unwashed
humanity mingled in degrees varying with the time of day and the
state of the weather.</p>

<p>Lena was not allowed to sit on the sofa, which was usually
occupied by the males, or in their absence the other two girls. She
usually sat on a packing-case by the window, and there she would
pore over her school books, trying to learn her lessons, amidst the
general din, bickering and disorder.</p>

<p>The family took no interest in her activities, other than those
which affected themselves. On her part she formed outside
friendships, and developed ambitions which she never imparted to
the rest.</p>

<p>And then one day a strange thing happened.</p>

<p>It was evening, and the family had just finished supper. The
boys had gone out. Mr. Gabril was sprawling on the sofa, smoking,
and reading the evening paper. Selma was washing up in the
scullery, Katie was making herself a blouse, and Lena was sitting
on her packing-case, reading, when there came a knock at the door.
Mr. Gabril said: "Come in!" and there entered a young, rather
good-looking clergyman.</p>

<p>The surprise and consternation of the family were immense. The
visit of a policeman could not have created a greater shock. Mr.
Gabril started as though he expected to be accused of some dreadful
vice. Katie dropped her sewing. Selma, catching sight of the
visitor through the open door, swiftly wiped her hands on a dry
rag, and prepared to re-enter the room. Lena alone seemed unmoved.
The stranger said, cheerily:</p>

<p>"Mr. Gabril?"</p>

<p>"That's my name," said Mr. Gabril, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Mr. Gabril. My name is Winscombe, of
the&mdash;er&mdash;church schools. I wanted to have a word with you
about your daughter. Ah! good-evening, Lena!"</p>

<p>The mystery deepened. He nodded familiarly to Lena, who smiled a
recognition. Now, what was this all about? The family had no
particular use for clergymen, a cold, repressive, prying lot. At
the same time, he was certainly a pleasant, gentlemanly fellow.
There might be something to be got out of him. The grin returned to
Mr. Gabril's face.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said. "I don't know. What's it about?"</p>

<p>Selma, who had entered the room, and liked the appearance of the
young man, <i>qua</i> young man, had a brain-wave. She said:</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, sir?"</p>

<p>He bowed, and replied:</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you. Your other two daughters, I presume.
Good-evening! Good-evening!"</p>

<p>He sat down and balanced his hat on his knee. Then he began
speaking eagerly.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mr. Gabril, we think your daughter has talent,
decided talent. I expect you know she was introduced to my sister
by Miss Watson at the school, who suspected her of being musical.
My sister has been giving her lessons for the last year, and she is
very impressed, very impressed indeed. My sister is not a great
musician herself, and she is of opinion that Lena should go to
someone more advanced."</p>

<p>"Well, the deuce! The nasty, furtive little cat! Why has she
said nothing about this?" reflected Mr. Gabril. Outwardly, he
continued to grin, and he spluttered out:</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh yes! Well, well!"</p>

<p>His mind became active. Plays the piano, eh? Well, what did the
fellow want? Did he think that he, Solomon Gabril, was going to
spend money on piano lessons? Was he such a fool as that? On the
other hand, if she could play, perhaps there was money in it.
Perhaps she could go on and play at the pictures. He'd heard of
girls getting two or three pounds a week at the game. Well? The
young fellow continued to talk.</p>

<p>"It has all fallen out rather fortunately, I hope you'll agree.
A friend of ours, a comparatively wealthy man, who is also a
musical patron, introduced her to Soltz, the well-known professor.
Lena played to him yesterday, and he too was impressed by her
extreme promise. My friend is willing to pay for a course of
lessons for her with Herr Soltz, I presume you would have no
objection?"</p>

<p>Something for nothing was entirely in keeping with Mr. Gabril's
sense of social morality. But what about this? In what way did
<i>he</i> benefit? It wanted thinking over. These people evidently
had money. It would be much better if they gave the money to him,
and <i>he</i> supervised the girl's musical education. On the other
hand, if they taught her to play properly&mdash;well, there was
money in that. Perhaps it would be better to agree in the meantime.
He said:</p>

<p>"Oh, really? Very nice, I'm sure&mdash;very nice."</p>

<p>The clergyman continued:</p>

<p>"She will, of course, be leaving school shortly, and then, if
she is allowed to devote her whole time to music, we think she may
go far&mdash;very far indeed."</p>

<p>"Playing for the pictures?" said Mr. Gabril, tentatively.</p>

<p>"Oh, farther than that, I trust."</p>

<p>"Playing at concerts, and so on?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, and giving her own recitals, and being engaged by
orchestral societies, becoming a great artiste, in fact."</p>

<p>Mr. Gabrielas eyes narrowed. He was a piano-tuner. He knew
something about the profession. There were people like Paderewski
and Pachmann making a lot of money. It had not occurred to him to
associate his scrubby little daughter with the dazzling side of a
musical career. He had not known till that moment that she knew a
note of music. This was an historical day in the history of the
Gabril family. But it had its reaction.</p>

<p>When the clergyman had gone, Selma flared up. She was jealous
and furious. She went up to Lena and said:</p>

<p>"You little sneak!" and she slapped her face. And then Mr.
Gabril saw red. He grabbed Selma, and screamed at her:</p>

<p>"You fool! Leave her alone, or I'll shake the life out of
you!"</p>

<p>Selma cried, and Lena cried, and Katie joined in the general
uproar, and eventually said she felt sick and was going to bed.
Their individual emotions were at cross-purposes. Selma couldn't
see that her father was primarily concerned with the commercial
potentialities of the situation. She accused him of taking Lena's
side against her, who did all the work. <i>She</i> was only drudge.
<i>She</i> wasn't given piano lessons. Rich people didn't come
chasing after <i>her</i>. A nice thing it was. She supposed Lena
would be having dancing lessons next, and be going to Buckingham
Palace to be presented at Court. Selma was very hysterical, her
mind a little confused by a film she had seen that afternoon,
called "The Heir to Millions." It was a thoroughly unpleasant
evening, and was not improved by the late advent of the two
brothers, both rather drunk. They were too drunk to be impressed by
the news about the clergyman's visit. Paul laughed
boisterously.</p>

<p>"A parson, eh?" he kept on repeating. "Fancy a parson coming
'ere!" He seemed to think it was quite the funniest thing that had
ever happened.</p>

<p>For several weeks Lena was subjected to a running fire of
jeering comments, vindictive on the part of her step-sisters,
ironic and inane on the part of her brothers. It was only Mr.
Gabril himself who displayed' any kind of tolerance. He cannot be
said to have shown any great sympathy, but he licked his lips and
leered, and bade the others shut up. He told romantic stories of
vast fortunes made out of playing the piano. None of the others
believed him. It was a dream so outside their normal conception of
life as lived in Camden Town that they could not visualize it. It
was possible that romantic figures in other settings did such
things, but scrubby little Lena, with whose superfluous person they
had been herded day and night all her wretched
life&mdash;nonsense!</p>

<p><br>
The only note of reality was struck three weeks after the
clergyman's visit, for one day a piano arrived. It was what is
known as a baby grand, and was put in "the parlour." Now this was a
concrete and astonishing occurrence. A piano costs money. Amidst
the packing-cases and flimsy furniture of the Gabrils' parlour it
struck a flamboyant, an alarming note. If it had been an ordinary
upright piano it would not have seemed out of place, but a grand!
Even Paul was slightly awed, and Selma disagreeably impressed. It
seemed to take up all the room, to be insolently assertive. Its
contempt for the flimsy furniture oozed from its shining black
sides. It was like a large Persian cat of ancient pedigree finding
itself in a room full of scraggy, ill-born kittens.</p>

<p>Mr. Gabril chuckled with satisfaction. He ran his fingers over
the keys, playing the few florid harmonies he was accustomed to
indulge in on his tuning rounds. It was a magnificent piano. The
angle of the family's attitude towards Lena shifted a little. What
if there were something in it after all? Each one naturally thought
of his or her own interests. "Suppose she does make money, where do
I come in?"</p>

<p>They stood round the piano in a group and made her play. They
seemed to expect some astounding miracle to happen right away. They
wanted her to give some definite proof that gold would quickly flow
as a result of her exertions. They were disappointed. She certainly
seemed to play all right. But she played very dull pieces. There
was nothing about the performance to dazzle or surprise.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they granted her a certain amount of freedom. She
was allowed to practise for several weeks unmolested, until the
novelty of the situation began to wear off. They got tired of her
scales, arpeggios, and repetitions. Besides, nothing was being said
about paying her large sums for playing in public. Paul wouldn't
let her play at all when he was in the house. Mischa brought home a
young man friend, who banged out jazz tunes for two evenings
running. Selma began to find the piano useful for piling up plates,
and pans, and pots. In three months' time the piano had ceased to
be an object of awe. Respect for it vanished. It became part and
parcel of the room. Its lid was scratched and marked. It was piled
up with papers and plates and odd rubbish. Lena only practised when
the others were out, and then she was always being interrupted by
knocks at the door, barrel-organs in the street below, or the
irksome duty of haying to keep one eye on a boiling pot.</p>

<p>Twice a week she went over to Kensington, and had a lesson from
Mr. Soltz. As her father refused to give her any money she had to
walk there and back, always hungry, frequently exhausted, ill-shod,
shabbily dressed, rain-soaked. But her eyes continued to glow with
the fire of her prescribed purposes, and a smile was ever ready on
her lips.</p>

<p><br>
A whole year passed before the deplorable incident in connection
with the piano happened.</p>

<p>Lena had left school. She was over fifteen. It was pointed out
to Mr. Gabril very forcibly by the other members of the family that
she might now be out earning money. There was no sign yet that all
this piano-playing was going to be any good. She might go on doing
it for years, and who was going to keep her? Why should she be
allowed to idle about at home, strumming on a piano, when Katie had
to go off every morning to a tea-shop?</p>

<p>Paul went out of a job, and Selma had become engaged to a flashy
young man who served in the stores, and backed horses. She wanted
to get married, and, of course, they had no money to start
housekeeping on. That fact was probably the basis of the idea which
led to the regrettable incident, that and Paul's unemployment and
depravity. It is certain that at the height of this condition of
discontent and disorder, Paul and Selma put their heads together.
They were both desperate and without moral bias. They plotted a
devilish dishonesty. One day, when everyone was out except these
two, a gentleman in a bowler hat paid them a visit. He made a
careful examination of the piano, and the three of them whispered
together in a corner.</p>

<p>On the following Thursday afternoon, Lena was over at
Kensington, having a lesson. Mr. Gabril was out tuning, and Katie
was, of course, at business also. A van drove up. Four men in green
aprons came upstairs. They picked up the "baby" as though it really
were a baby. They carried it gently downstairs and deposited it in
the van. The foreman handed Paul an envelope, and they drove off.
Paul and Selma had sold the piano for seventy pounds!</p>

<p>The plot was ingenious, but somewhat incomplete. They had taken
the precaution to deal with a firm in South London, and payment was
made in cash. It was obvious that they must not disappear. They
must brazen the thing out. Selma was to say that she was alone in
the house when the piano people called and said they had
instructions to take the piano away and restore it. She knew
nothing about it. She supposed it was all right. Nevertheless, it
was a risky game. It all depended upon what attitude Mr.
Winscombe's people might take. They might advertise. Paul and Selma
would have to stick together, and lie like anything. They shared
the spoil, but both felt dreadfully frightened. And, curiously
enough, Selma felt less frightened of detection than she did of
Lena. What would Lena do? There was something queer and uncanny
about the kid. You never knew what she would do.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for Paul that the transaction was a cash one.
He went out into the street with thirty-five pounds in his pocket.
He was not a good subject to have so much money on him. He had
never had so much before in his life. He was frightened and very
desperate. He went straight down the road and had three whiskies.
Then he began to see things more clearly. There would be a row. He
might be arrested, put in prison&mdash;anything. What did he care
about the family? Thirty-five pounds seemed an enormous sum. He
could live for months, and then perhaps something else might turn
up, another scoop. He wasn't going back to that house. Of course,
he had promised to stick by Selma, but still&mdash;what did it
matter? Selma could look after herself. Women were always all
right. Let's have a good night out first, anyway. He went up
West.</p>

<p>After an orgy that lasted three days and nights, he took a train
to Brighton, where, in the fullness of time, he married a fat
elderly lady, who owned a green-grocer's shop. His subsequent life
does not concern us, but, if rumour is to be believed, he got all
he deserved.</p>

<p>Selma was pluckier than Paul, and a little more cunning. To her
surprise, Lena took the news more philosophically than she had
expected. At first, of course, she believed Selma's story that they
had sent for the piano to do something to it, but, even when the
truth came out, that it had indeed been stolen, she only seemed a
little dazed and surprised. It was as though there were within her
vibrant forces that could not be deflected by the mere removal of
material things.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Gabril who caused Selma most trouble. He was furious.
He saw at once that some trick had been played, and he regarded the
playing of tricks as his own prerogative. He had, indeed, for some
time nurtured this identical idea of selling the piano, and he
would have done it more efficiently. He had many friends in the
piano-dealing world, friends who were capable of keeping their
mouths shut, too. He would have got a good price, and he did not
believe there was anything in Lena's future, or, if there were, it
would take too long to materialize.</p>

<p>When Paul failed to return the father's suspicions naturally
centred upon him. He accepted Selma's statement unquestioningly.
Well, what were they going to do? Selma hinted at keeping the
matter quiet.</p>

<p>"The piano was only lent. They will hold us responsible," she
said.</p>

<p>"Idiot!" yelled the father. "What's the good of that? They're
bound to find out in time. Besides, I'm going to find out who did
this dirty trick. I'm going to have my revenge."</p>

<p>"Suppose it was Paul?" said Selma, turning rather pale.</p>

<p>"If it was Paul he can go to gaol for it. He's been there
before. It's about the only place he's fit for," said the boy's
father.</p>

<p>Selma cursed her brother in her heart. The coward! The sneak!
Fancy running away, leaving her to bear the brunt of the whole
danger! How like a man!</p>

<p>Lena was only concerned with the question as to where she was to
practise, and on what piano. She went the first thing next morning
and reported the matter to Ih r. Winscombe. That gentleman arrived
later with a lawyer. Selma was closely cross-examined. She gave her
version of the case, only omitting the fact of Paul's
disappearance.</p>

<p>Later in the day Mr. Winscombe had an interview with Sir Robert
Ashington, the music patron and owner of the piano. He was a thin,
scholarly-looking old gentleman with snow-white hair.</p>

<p>"Well, well," he said, on hearing the clergyman's report, "what
are we to do about it?"</p>

<p>"We have already notified the police, and Channing suggests that
we might advertise it. If the firm who bought the piano are a
<i>bona fide</i> firm they might be willing to come forward. But
if, as is most likely, they got it for a song, they may keep quiet.
It is easy enough to sell a grand piano, and comparatively easy to
alter the number or change it in such a manner that after a little
interval they could dispose of it with safety."</p>

<p>"Do you suspect the family?"</p>

<p>The clergyman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"They are a terrible crowd, sir, terrible. They are certainly
capable, either individually or collectively, of doing such a
thing. The father, of course, is the most likely. He is in the
piano trade, and would know how to go to work."</p>

<p>"What about the child?"</p>

<p>Mr. Winscombe smiled.</p>

<p>"She is splendid. She came to me this morning, and there were
tears in her eyes. 'Oh, Mr. Winscombe,' she said, 'don't tell me
this is the end! I shall go mad if I cannot go on playing!'"</p>

<p>There was a certain humidity about the eyes of the older
man.</p>

<p>"Poor child!" he said. "Well, well, let us fix her up first. She
had better have a room in some respectable house we know of. I dare
say we can find her another piano. I saw Soltz two days ago. He
says she is making astonishing strides."</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Winscombe got busy. He had no room available in his
own house, but after a rapid search he made arrangements with an
American widow, who lived with her son and daughter in a large
house in Regent's Park. Her name was Mrs. Bouverie Bennington. She
was a warm-hearted, sympathetic woman, interested in social
questions, clever, and well read. She had a music-room and a grand
piano, which was seldom used in the day-time. Her son was at
college, and her daughter was not musical. She gave Lena permission
to go there and play whenever she liked.</p>

<p>An advertisement was put in the papers, but no reply was
received. Neither were the police ever able to solve the mystery of
the vanished baby grand. After a week or two, Selma breathed more
freely, but she was still frightened and entirely discontented with
her lot. She suffered from sleeplessness, and nightmares in which
giants in green baize aprons played pitch and toss with enormous
grand pianos that were for ever about to drop on her head. She
determined to marry her flashy young shop-assistant at the earliest
possible moment. She told him she had saved thirty-five pounds out
of her housekeeping money, and he, immediately inspired by the
thoughts of this noble endowment, conceived a great scheme by which
it could be trebled by a cunning system of backing outsiders for
small sums. Selma had no great faith in this, but after
considerable discussion she advanced him ten pounds to experiment
with. Unfortunately for Selma's future life, the investment was
surprisingly successful. It happened during the ensuing month that
several most unlikely outsiders romped home to a place. The ten
pounds accrued to forty-seven pounds, and they got married and went
to live in rooms at Holloway. Selma's half-share of the piano
bought her married life&mdash;so she also got her deserts.</p>

<p>Her departure was the beginning of the slow disintegration of
the whole Gabril family. Mischa went out to Canada, and they did
not hear from him again. Katie wanted to come home and take Selma's
place, but Mr. Gabril could not see that there was any point in
that. She was making good money: let her stop where she was. The
rooms could look after themselves. The three of them pigged along
as best they could.</p>

<p>A whole year went by. A year and eight months, and then Katie
was taken suddenly ill. She had to go to a hospital and have an
operation. It was not a serious operation, but in her anaemic and
enfeebled condition it proved too much for her. She died under the
anaesthetic.</p>

<p>Mr. Gabril was now running rapidly to seed. The firm still
employed him, but he was entrusted with less and less orders. His
income became automatically less. He began to regard Lena
restlessly. It was quite time she was making money&mdash;all this
talk about a great career! He had been gambling on it, perhaps
foolishly. She might be earning a pound a week or so at some honest
job. He went to see Mr. Winscombe, and explained.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," said that gentleman, "your daughter is getting on
splendidly. Everyone is delighted with her. They say she will be a
great artiste. But she must have time. It would be cruel to take
her away now."</p>

<p>"How much time?"</p>

<p>"At least another two years. She might give lessons before
then."</p>

<p>Two years! And he had got to keep her all that time? Oh no, the
game wasn't worth it. He growled an incoherent disapproval,
borrowed five shillings from the clergyman, and came away.
Something would have to be done. That evening he took Lena severely
to task.</p>

<p>"Now, look here," he said, "that parson said you could give
lessons. You'd better get busy and find some pupils. If you don't
get pupils within the next week I shall take you away and put you
in a job."</p>

<p>It happened that evening that Selma called with her husband. She
seemed querulous and tearful. The betting system had been a
complete failure since their marriage, and she was going to have a
baby. What were they going to do? Things were bad enough as it was.
How could they afford a child as well? And George was in debt up to
his eyes. George did not give the impression of being in debt. He
was well clothed and groomed, and his silver cigarette-case was
always flashing. He laughed indulgently at his wife. All would be
well when the flat-racing season started. He had had some very
sound information straight out of the horse's nose-bag.</p>

<p>"When are you going to start making all this money?" Selma
suddenly asked Lena.</p>

<p>"What money, Selma?"</p>

<p>Even Mr. Gabril was aghast at this flippant reply. Money! What
did the girl think she was doing all this ivory-thumping for? Fun?
Pleasure? As a matter of fact, Lena had given the subject little
thought. She had at times dreamed that she might one day be rich,
and then she would like to go about helping people, even her own
people, even Selma. But she did not associate the surging calls of
her muse with making money. It was so much bigger and beyond that,
so much more tremendous. Of course, she wanted to do her duty. She
didn't want to be mean, but she knew that in this social struggle
she was born to she had to fight her own battles.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can get some pupils," she said defensively.</p>

<p>During the next few days she did look round and make inquiries.
But pupils were not at all easy to secure. No one had heard of Lena
Gabril. She looked too young to have the authority of a teacher.
She consulted Mr. Winscombe, and in the end, on his recommendation,
a lady in the Camden Road engaged her to teach her two little
girls. She was to be paid thirty shillings a term for giving the
little girls twelve lessons each.</p>

<p>She broke the news to her father with triumph, but to her
chagrin he received it angrily.</p>

<p>"Thirty shillings!" he whined. "What's the good of thirty
shillings? You ought to be earning thirty pounds a term."</p>

<p>Thirty pounds! Oh, dear! That would mean teaching forty little
girls twelve hours each a term. Four hundred and eighty hours out
of the term. When was she to practise? She would have to be cunning
with her father, humour him, pretend she was trying to get more and
more pupils. The terrible menace of a "job" hung over her. She
imagined herself in a pickle factory or a draper's shop, or perhaps
out at service. The reflection drove her to work harder and harder
at her piano. She said nothing about the kindness Mrs. Bonnington
was showing her. She pretended she just went to a house, practised
in a room, and came away without seeing anyone. She dreaded that
her father might call, make a scene, borrow money, and behave in
some disgraceful fashion. Some profound instinct of
self-preservation prompted her to remain mute concerning the
delightful lunches and teas and talks she had with Mrs. Bennington
and her son and daughter. She had discovered a new world, a world
she had only been able dimly to imagine through the medium of
music. She was emerging through the dark mists of her upbringing
into a realm of light and understanding. She did not mean her
father and step-sister to drag her back without a bitter
struggle.</p>

<p>Two months passed before the climacteric was reached. She had
not been able to get any more pupils. Her father got more and more
vindictive, bitter, and inclined to violence. Mr. Gabril had been
on one of his periodic orgies. He arrived home one evening, his
eyes bloodshot and his breath whisky-laden. He had spent all his
money and he wanted more. Lena, of course, had none.</p>

<p>"Go and get some," he roared.</p>

<p>"Where can I get any money?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You lazy little slut!" he screamed, in a higher pitch. "Thirty
shillings a term you earn, do you? I've been keeping you for
seventeen years. To-morrow you'll come along with me. I'll get you
a job with a pal of mine who runs a public-house. That's what I'll
do. He said he'd give you a job&mdash;barmaid, see? In Kentish
Town. You'll like it. A nice merry life, plenty of boys and booze,
see? Now, you go right along to that woman in the Camden Road and
collect the thirty bob she owes you, and bring it back to me at
once. Go on, hurry up!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't do that," said Lena, colouring up. "I couldn't call
there in the evening like this and ask for money."</p>

<p>"Oh, you couldn't, couldn't yer?" said Mr. Gabril. "You couldn't
do what yer father tells yer, couldn't yer? Take that!"</p>

<p>And he struck at her. Lena was expecting this. She put up her
arm and parried the blow. She cowered against the wall. Her eyes
narrowed. She said quietly:</p>

<p>"All right. I'll go."</p>

<p>She put on her hat and cloak, tidied her hair in the broken
mirror, and went slowly out. After she had gone Mr. Gabril felt
ill. His heart was behaving queerly. He flopped on to the sofa and
lay down.</p>

<p>"I want a drink," he kept on repeating, "that's what's the
matter with me&mdash;hope she'll be quick. I want a drink."</p>

<p>He waited some time till drowsiness crept over him, and then he
sank into a drunken sleep. He was next conscious of cold,
discomfort, and wretchedness. He struggled through the coma to find
himself. When consciousness came it seemed only partial. Where was
he? What had happened? It was raw daylight, and he was lying on the
sofa in the parlour...Why, yes, of course, he had had a bit of a
binge. But why was he here? Where was Lena? Lena? Why, yes,
something had happened. Bit of a row, eh? He remembered now he had
sent her out to get some money. Where was she? He called out:</p>

<p>"Lena!"</p>

<p>There was no answer. He got up and stumbled to the girl's
bedroom. She was not there. Where the devil was she? He visited
each room in turn, and wandered out on to the staircase. It was
broad daylight, must be nearly midday, and she had gone out last
night. What had happened to her? Accident? Perhaps she'd jumped
into the canal because he'd struck her. Girls were like
that&mdash;silly, hysterical creatures. But Lena wasn't exactly the
sort. But what was he to do? He felt ill, and he had no money. He
crawled back to the sofa.</p>

<p>He lay there for hours in a kind of torpor, hoping that Lena
would return at any moment. There was a little food in the house,
but he felt too unwell to eat. Once he worked himself up into a
violent fit of rage. He swore and blasphemed loudly, but, finding
this only made him feel worse, he desisted. When the room began to
get dark again he became desperate. He scribbled a note to Selma,
telling her to come and see him at once. He got a boy on the floor
below to take it, on a promise of sixpence. Then he waited in the
increasing gloom.</p>

<p>It was three hours before Selma came. She came alone. He cursed
her for being so long, and she lost her temper. When she heard of
Lena's disappearance her expression became blacker still. When her
father suggested accident or suicide she cried out savagely:</p>

<p>"Not she, you fool! That's not her luck. I felt it from the
first. She's gone to her rich friends."</p>

<p>"Where do they live?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Somewhere in Regent's Park. I've never been
there. I don't know their name."</p>

<p>"I'll make the devils pay for this. How can we find them?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Winscombe would know."</p>

<p>"That's right, curse him! You go round now and find out. Got any
money, Selma? If so, for God's sake get me a drink first."</p>

<p>"I haven't any money for drinks for you, but I'Il go round to
Mr. Winscombe."</p>

<p>Mr. Gabril growled, and Selma went out. She felt tired herself,
but there was a sense of grim satisfaction in being able to hand
her step-sister over to the father's vengeance. Mr. Winscombe was
out, but he was expected in. He kept her waiting half an hour. When
he arrived he said that he knew nothing about Lena's disappearance.
He had not seen Mrs. Binnington for weeks. However, he reluctantly
gave Selma the name and address.</p>

<p>Armed with this weapon of vengeance, Selma returned to her
father. She found him lying face downwards by the fireplace.</p>

<p>She gave a feeble scream when she felt his stiff body. Then she
stood up and looked around her. The instinct of self-preservation
was fortified by her condition. She had no love for her father. She
looked at the sticks of furniture and reflected. She knew her
father had no money. But there were three rooms furnished in a way.
The whole lot would fetch several pounds. There was an unborn child
to consider, and the flat-racing season was not being any goad. Who
should have this furniture if not she?</p>

<p>She looked at the crumpled paper in her hand&mdash;Lena's
address. What should she do about that? If Lena had gone to live
with these people, she couldn't prevent her. She was a little
frightened of educated people&mdash;indeed, a little frightened of
Lena herself. Besides, if she returned she might claim her share of
the furniture. She flung the paper in the fireplace. Let Lena go
her own way. Let her rot.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
One spring morning seven years later Selma was walking down Great
Portland Street. Her right hand was holding the hand of a chubby
little girl of four. Under her left arm was a bundle of washing.
She took that narrow turning that runs by the side of the Queen's
Hall. Suddenly her eye alighted upon the lithograph of a portrait
that seemed familiar. Underneath the portrait in large black type
'vas printed "Lena Gabrielski," and then in red type, "First
appearance since her brilliantly successful American tour." Hardly
had she recovered from her astonishment at recognizing Lena's
portrait when a figure came down the steps from the artistes' door.
It was Lena herself. The two women looked straight into each
other's eyes. Lena was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Selma!" she gasped.</p>

<p>Selma was entirely nonplussed. She did not know how to act. She
let go of the child's hand and shifted the bundle from one arm to
the other, as though anxious to conceal it. She looked from Lena to
the poster, and said at random:</p>

<p>"Why do you call yourself that funny long name?"</p>

<p>Lena glanced at the poster.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was my agent's idea. How are you, Selma, and who is
this small person?"</p>

<p>"It's my little girl."</p>

<p>Lena stooped and took the child's hand.</p>

<p>"And what is your name?"</p>

<p>The child's eyes kindled at the vision of this beautiful lady so
beautifully gowned.</p>

<p>She said: "Irene."</p>

<p>Selma stood apart, consumed with the consciousness of jarring
contrast. Her own slatternliness, her bundle, her baby, and this
other woman with the clothes, the manner, and faint perfume of the
well-bred. Could it be possible that they had the same father? She
felt angry. A tear came into her eye, and she groped for the
child's hand as though anxious to escape. But the child was
apparently too occupied to notice her mother's anxiety. She
appeared to have suddenly made a new friend. When Lena had finished
her little talk she turned to Selma and said:</p>

<p>"Selma, I tried to find you once or twice, but you had moved and
no one knew your address. Why didn't you write to me?"</p>

<p>Selma didn't know what prompted her to do it, but she felt an
abrupt desire to hurt Lena, to hurt herself even more. She said
bitterly:</p>

<p>"Do you know it was me and Paul that stole your piano? We sold
it and shared the spoil."</p>

<p>Lena gave a little gasp. It was her turn to cry, but a smile
struggled through her tears. She pressed her step-sister's arm.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Selma. You did me a great service. If you had not
taken the piano I should never perhaps have met my&mdash;my
husband. And we are so happy, Selma."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;married!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I married Mrs. Bonnington's son. We live at
Hampstead. Won't you come and see us? I have babies of my own. I'd
like to help you, Selma."</p>

<p>For a moment the elder woman wavered. She dug her hard fingers
tighter into the bundle of washing. Then she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the good?"</p>

<p>A policeman at the corner watched the two women interestedly.
Their behaviour struck him as peculiar. Was the woman with the
bundle and the baby trying to beg? It didn't seem quite like it. In
fact, it looked almost the other way about. The child, too, seemed
to be taking an important part in the discussion and was appealing
to its mother. Was there going to be a scene? He strolled at the
law's pace in their direction. Before he reached them, however, he
saw the lady hail a taxi. The three of them entered it, and drove
off in the direction of Hampstead.</p>

<p>"Um!" he muttered to himself. "Rum creatures&mdash;women!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. The Dark Corridor</h2>

<p>When the iron door of the cell clicks to, and the convict is
shut in for the night, it is not often that the sound produces in
him a sense of elation. But to them all there is perhaps one
occasion when it does so&mdash;the night before release.</p>

<p>At the sound of that familiar click the mind of Raymond
Calverley instinctively registered the phrase, "The last time!"</p>

<p>When the door was opened again he would be free. The price would
have been paid. Till now he had hardly dare visualize this moment.
There had been whole days, whole nights, whole years when he could
not persuade himself that it would ever come to pass. He felt sick
with agitation. He sat upon the bed and buried his face in his
hands. Free, really, really free! He had been a good sleeper, but
to-night he would not sleep. Memories, fears, anticipations raced
through his brain. In a few hours more he would be facing the
outside world. There was something terrifying in the
thought&mdash;facing the unknown. His sympathies quickened towards
some of those old prison "lags" who, after serving twenty years or
so, preferred prison life. It was, in any case, familiar and
understandable. The outside world to them was completely
bewildering. They didn't know how to cope with it.</p>

<p>But he&mdash;he was only forty-six, and he had only served five
years and three months. Only! Five years and three months! Five
thousand years and three hundred months. There had been moments
during the first year when he thought he would go mad, when half an
hour seemed like an eternity, and he would think:</p>

<p>"That's half-an-hour. Now there's to be another half-hour. Then
another and another and another, and then eventually a whole day,
and a whole night. Then all over again and again and again till a
week passes. Then all over and over again till a month passes. Then
the seasons change. It will be winter again, and then summer, and
then winter again and then summer, and so on and on and on five
times. And I'm changing all the time. The outside world is
changing. All the things I desire are cut off from me. I shall
never endure it. Oh, God!"</p>

<p>But he had endured it. The reality had come to pass. In a few
hours...Of all the manifestations of Nature that which is called
human is the most adaptable. As the years passed he found himself
adapting himself to prison life, creating a life within a life.
There were times when he even persuaded himself that he was happy.
This was largely the outcome of a sense of physical well-being.
Prison life suited him. He had been forced to work out in the open
several hours a day, on the farms, and in the quarries, fourteen
hundred feet above the sea on Dartmoor. The air itself was a tonic.
He had been plainly but adequately fed. He had to retire for the
night at five o'clock. He had been cut off from alcohol, which had
been partly the cause of his undoing. During the last two years he
had been allowed to smoke for half-an-hour twice a day, but that
was all. Everything was regular, ordered, and methodical. He had no
responsibility. He was physically fit, much fitter than he had been
at any time since he left school. For part of the time he had
worked in the carpenter's shop. He had come to like the smell of
wood, and the sense of creating something which was going to be
used. There had been odd moments when the whole atmosphere of the
prison seemed friendly and satisfying. Some little concession would
be magnified into a great act of kindness. He had had opportunities
for reading, and greater ones for reflecting. And his dominant
reflection had been: "I must so manage my mind that I do not
eternally regard myself as a criminal." His struggle for self
respect had been acute. To foster this he took all the trouble he
could with his personal appearance. A wise provision of recent
years allows the convict a safety razor and the liberty to wear his
hair as he likes. Raymond took advantage of this. He shaved every
day, and brushed his grey locks carefully, sometimes even
lubricating them with a little of His Majesty's butter! His skin
was tanned with sun and wind. He would return to the outside world
a better specimen physically. But mentally and morally? here were
greater difficulties. His mind said: "I was guilty. I let things
drift. I was weak and foolish. I saw an opportunity to make a great
sum of money easily. I was dishonest. I was found out. They
punished me. I have paid the price. To this extent I am purged. I
see things more clearly now. I shall not be dishonest again. I have
no desire to be. I have lost the desire in the same way that I have
lost the desire for alcohol. I just want my chance to be a decent
citizen again. But will they let me? What will be their attitude
towards me? Above all&mdash;how can I face my son?"</p>

<p>At this point in his reflections he would groan aloud, for his
son was the mainspring of his life.</p>

<p>Raymond had been an importer of chemicals, with offices in
Fenchurch Street. At the age of twenty-two he had married the
daughter of a wealthy shipbroker. After their first passionate
attachment he and his wife found that their interests did not
dovetail. Had it not been for the son who was born the following
year, it is possible that he and his wife would have agreed to
separate. Not that there was any serious breach between them. It
was simply that familiar cleavage of little things. It took years
to discover that they had little in common, and when the discovery
was made each prepared to make the best of it&mdash;not an unusual
marital position. They had remained on perfectly friendly terms,
and it was only over the upbringing of the boy that they came into
conflict, and even then the contest was conducted without
bitterness.</p>

<p>His wife was a Society woman, with Society interests. She rode,
hunted, played golf, took the waters at fashionable places abroad,
went to church, and backed horses. Raymond liked books and rambling
in the country, and that Society spelt with a small "s" which one
meets in country inns or London taverns. When his wife condescended
to come to London they shared the same house, but they made all
their arrangements independently by mutual consent. But when it
came to the arrangements about the boy, Ralph, they were forced to
compromise. If he wanted the boy in London, she would want him in
Yorkshire. If he wanted to take him for a holiday to Cornwall, she
would want to take him to Trouville. If he wanted him to go up to
Oxford, she would insist on Cambridge. And so the ding-dong race
went on, with Kathleen usually a neck or two ahead.</p>

<p>With his wife usually abroad, and his son at college, Raymond
would have led a lonely life in the large house in Russell Square.
Only there are clubs. He belonged to several and he was a good club
man. Many considered him an ideal club man, being genial, lavishly
hospitable, and a good raconteur. He drifted into the habit of
lunching in clubs, dining in clubs, and calling at clubs between
meals. Like many men of his kind, without being a drunkard, he
drank considerably too much, in the sheer exuberance of social
intercourse. He could afford to be generous, as his business was
successful, and his wife had a large private fortune of her own.
But one day he was tricked by some Argentine gentlemen, and lost a
very large sum of money over a deal in nitrates. The bitterness of
this acted upon him disastrously. He was worried by the
complications arising from it, and he drowned his distress in the
accustomed way. He visited more clubs, and pubs. And unfortunately
in one of these expeditions he met Max Rawle. Max was one of those
people of no determinate age, nationality or profession, who
nevertheless seem to embody all the vices of every age, nation, and
profession, and to wrap up the same in a cloak of irresistible
charm. He was a natural swindler. People knew he was going to
swindle them, and they couldn't help it. They would even forgive
him after the deed was done, so plausible and charming was he.</p>

<p>And under the influence of Max Rawle Raymond became as clay in
the hands of the potter. They lunched and dined together, played
billiards, and went to night clubs. Max was a brilliant talker, and
had lived in strange lands and mixed with strange people.</p>

<p>The trouble had occurred soon after he and his wife had
disagreed about whether Ralph should go up to Oxford or Cambridge.
As usual she had had her way, and Ralph had gone up to Trinity.
Kathleen went off to Biarritz and had no intention of returning
till the end of the term. Raymond followed the easy path and found
himself getting into debt, and his moral fibre slackening. He was
too proud to apply to his wife for money to stabilize his affairs.
And one mad evening Max dangled before him the lure of a mighty
opportunity. It could hardly fail. So ingenious and yet so simple
did the scheme appear that Raymond was astonished that it had never
occurred to anyone before. It concerned the transference of certain
blocks of interests backwards and forwards between two different
companies at the opportune moment, thus giving an inflated
appearance to both. It hardly seemed dishonest in the way that Max
devised it. They were to go shares. But a few days after he had
completed his part of the bargain, Max had disappeared, and nothing
had been seen of him since. Raymond was left in the air. He was
unable to explain his position. A long and involved commercial
trial resulted in his being condemned to seven years penal
servitude for fraud. With a good conduct record this had been
reduced to five years and three months.</p>

<p>But how was he to face his son? His wife had taken the matter
better than he had anticipated. She had even written to him
regularly every three months, formal little letters about the boy
and family affairs. She had upbraided him for not appealing to her
when in financial straits. And had hinted that she would set him on
his feet again when released. The boy had written him chatty
school-boyish letters ignoring his father's crime; his only
resentment being apparently that he had had to leave Cambridge
before he had been up a year. He had been spending his time partly
with his mother, who had settled abroad, and partly with a tutor in
a remote village in Suffolk.</p>

<p>His son! Raymond would lie in his cell bed at night and groan.
He would think of the boy at all the stages of his life. When he
was a toddler and would lie in his arms, when he began to lisp and
talk. When he would run to him and throw his arms around him. He
could hear the sound of that baby voice: "Daddy, daddy!" And then
he taught him all the simple things, and Ralph went to school. How
proud he had been when the boy came home and asked his advice and
help. He would see the little sturdy figure come swinging along the
street, a satchel strapped over his scarlet jersey. His handsome
eager face would light up with pleasure when he saw his father. And
they would go for walks together, holding hands, and talking about
birds, and trees, and games. And the boy loved and respected him.
He also loved and respected his mother, and he could not understand
any differences between them. And so the parents compromised and
patched up a union of sorts, but they were jealous of each
other.</p>

<p>Raymond had loved to watch the unfolding of the boy's mind. He
had loved the steady growth of their greater intimacy. He had
searched fearfully for traces of his own failings and weaknesses.
His greatest desire had been that the boy should be a better man
than he. And everything pointed to his desire being fulfilled.
Ralph was a good boy, unselfish, affectionate, easy-going, and
considerate. He was intelligent, but he did not distinguish himself
very notably at school either at work or play. But what did that
matter? It is often the slow starter who wins the race. Besides, he
would always be well provided for. Raymond knew that his mother had
left everything to the boy in her will, and he did not resent one
penny of it. They would never have any more children. This sense of
security contributed largely to his own undoing. There was no need
to make efforts. As the boy had become more independent, and his
wife more occupied with her own affairs, Raymond became more
detached and irresponsible. His business had run smoothly,
requiring no great personal strain, and it didn't seem very
important whether it succeeded or not. There was no great need for
him to labour, neither did there appear any great call on him to
set an example, when Ralph was at college. The boy had been
launched. He had been handed health, security and good precepts.
Raymond had felt that his obligations to society at large were not
impressive. And he had begun to drift. The weakness was
inexcusable, but it had taken the cold stern experience and
suffering of prison life to make it clear to him. The price had
been paid. He had so managed his mind that he would leave the
prison feeling that he was no longer a criminal.</p>

<p>When the crash had come and he had stood in the dock at the Old
Bailey, and listened to the suave voice of the judge condemning him
to seven years imprisonment, there had flashed before his mind the
image of Ralph's eager young face exclaiming:</p>

<p>"What's all this about, Dad?"</p>

<p>The boy would never believe he was a criminal. He simply could
not understand. It had not been indeed a simple case to understand.
He had been able to make the excuse, but not the defence, that he
himself did not understand. He had muddled things up, signed the
wrong papers. The excuse satisfied the boy of course. But the law
is more explicit. The law gave him every opportunity, left him
every loophole, but was relentless in the logic of its ordered
facts.</p>

<p>But since that tragic day the boy had had five years to study
those facts. He had come to man's estate. People would have told
him, and explained to him, doubtless made things as unpleasant as
possible&mdash;some of them. And he would have wanted to
know&mdash;oh, so eagerly! He would not be likely to exclaim
now:</p>

<p>"What's all this about, Dad?"</p>

<p>Even his voice would have changed. Oh, God!</p>

<p>He dozed fitfully until the morning light crept between the
prison bars, when, strangely enough, he slept soundly, only to be
awakened by the familiar click of the cell door.</p>

<p>"The last time!"</p>

<p>He dressed carefully, washed, and had his breakfast. He was led
to a room where he filled up many forms. Then his clothes were
given him. There was much clanking of chains and keys. Crossing the
yard in charge of a warder he passed a working party on its way to
the farriers. All of the convicts were familiar to him. Many of
them would be there for ten years or more, and in two minutes he
would be free! He shuffled along feeling a little ashamed, as
though he were taking something from them which they had a right to
share. As they neared the outer gate, the warder, a fat elderly
person of the old school, said:</p>

<p>"Well, good luck, son!"</p>

<p>A lump came in his throat at this unexpected friendly gesture,
and he could not reply. A great wave of pity flooded him,
pity...oh, for all the world.</p>

<p>The gate opened. He stepped through into the sunshine. He heard
it click behind him. He was free. He stood for a moment bewildered.
Then he walked a little way up the road. There was no one about. He
stood by a wall and wept, for no palpable reason. He felt curiously
sick, like a man surfeited with rich food.</p>

<p>He had half expected...someone would meet him at the prison
gates. But the street was utterly deserted. His wife knew of the
day of his release and she had sent him money, but no hint of where
she was or where the boy was. It was like starting life all over
again. He was startled by the approach of a tall figure emerging
from a house. His instinct was to run. It was a familiar figure
coming to recapture him. A deep booming voice said:</p>

<p>"Well, Calverley, you're out, then!"</p>

<p>It was the prison chaplain. Raymond blinked and the chaplain
held out his hand. As he held it he realised that this was the
first human hand he had touched for five long years.</p>

<p>"Well, my good fellow, I trust you now to keep straight."</p>

<p>He resented this. Straight! What right had this person to
lecture him&mdash;Raymond Calverley, the man who was no longer a
criminal? Nevertheless he said weakly:</p>

<p>"I shall try, sir."</p>

<p>He wanted to get away. The chaplain made a few more unctuous
remarks, but he did not hear them. He hurried away and walked to
Princetown Station. He had a pass to London, and he sat in the
corner of the waiting-room. The train did not go for nearly an
hour. People regarded him furtively. In Princetown everything is
known. Every porter on the station would know that he was a
released convict.</p>

<p>The journey up was occupied with dreams. Dreams, and hope and
fear, and wild anticipations. Where should he go? His wife had no
house now in town, and he didn't know where she was, nor where the
boy was. Oh, if he could only find Ralph!</p>

<p>He arrived at Paddington late in the afternoon and wandered
around the streets adjoining the station. Everything seemed
incredibly noisy and bewildering. Newspaper placards were
announcing: "Fall of French Government." How futile and
unimportant! Didn't they realize that the only important thing was:
"Release of Raymond Calverley!" He would have been forgotten by
now, although at one time his name had been very much in the public
eye. At last he found a dingy little hotel in an obscure street,
where he engaged a room. Then he had some tea and wandered the
streets again, haunted by the vague idea that he might find Ralph.
He went up to the West End and strolled down Regent Street,
Piccadilly, and Mayfair. At the corner of Jermyn Street he met a
man with whom he had done a lot of business in the past, an old
club-fellow. He touched his arm and said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Frank!"</p>

<p>The man turned and looked at him. An extraordinary scared
expression came over his face. His eyes distended, as though he
were staring at some strange and dangerous animal. He managed to
say:</p>

<p>"Ho&mdash;yes, it's&mdash;Calverley, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. How are you?"</p>

<p>"All right. And you? You&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm free again."</p>

<p>He tried to smile, but the other man's terrified mien froze the
smile upon his lips. His expression seemed to say:</p>

<p>"How on earth am I to escape from this awful predicament?"</p>

<p>They exchanged a few banal remarks, and parted, without any
reference to the past, or suggestions for the future. As he walked
away Raymond winced.</p>

<p>"So that's to be it, is it!" he thought.</p>

<p>The restaurants were crowded with gay diners. If he cared to, he
could enter any one of them. He was free. He could mingle with his
fellows, and buy rich foods and good wines. But he felt no such
inclination. It was too late. He was not accustomed to feeding
after five o'clock. He did not feel hungry, and drink he knew would
upset him. Moreover, his experience with his old business colleague
damped his enthusiasm for social life. He might meet others who
would treat him in the same way. How could he expect them to know
that he was no longer a criminal? that his mind had been purged of
its weakness and self-indulgence?</p>

<p>He wandered about till nine o'clock when a great sense of
melancholy and exhaustion overcame him. He went back to his hotel,
and to bed. They had given him a room at the end of a dimly-lighted
corridor on the second floor. He slept soundly till dawn, when he
emerged through a tangled skein of dreams to consciousness. It was
as though his own dreams were happy ones, but that they were
eternally interrupted by the evil dreams of others. He washed and
dressed, and finding that it was too early to obtain breakfast in
the hotel, he went out to a coffee stall. He stood there drinking
hot weak coffee, and eating hard-boiled eggs, and listening to a
slightly inebriated gentleman in evening dress talking to two
cabmen about God. The cabmen were laughing, and the coffee
stall-keeper was joining in the argument earnestly. The morning air
had a tang of hope and defiance. He took a hand in the argument and
found himself laughing too. In this company he was happy and at
home. No one knew him or cared. In the old days of his prosperity
he had spent many a happy hour at a coffee stall. Here was
something that had not changed...flotsam and jetsam seeking
good-fellowship at the board of abstract argument. When the
inebriated gentleman and the cabmen had departed he felt fortified
to face his day's campaign.</p>

<p>In the uncertainty of his position he found one tangible
spot&mdash;his wife's lawyers. They would know of her whereabouts
and probably of Ralph's. He had been informed of "their address,
and of the fact that they were empowered to pay him twenty-five
pounds a month until further notice. He wandered the streets again
till ten o'clock his eyes wistfully seeking, and his heart aching
for his son. At ten o'clock promptly he presented himself at the
office of Tidworth, Bates and Mashie in Lincoln's Inn Fields. He
was kept waiting three-quarters of an hour before being shown into
the office of an elderly red-faced man, in a white waistcoat, who
said curtly:</p>

<p>"Yes, what is your business?"</p>

<p>"I want to know if you can tell me the whereabouts of my wife,
Mrs. Raymond Calverley?"</p>

<p>The lawyer looked up quickly, his face expressing a kind of
greedy morbid interest. It had something of the expression of his
business friend of the night before, only less furtive. The lawyer
was in no panic to get away. He had power on his side, and he was
prepared to take a certain amount of cynical-enjoyment out of it.
He coughed and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, so you are Raymond Calverley. Will you please show me your
discharge? I understand that I am to&mdash;er&mdash;make you a
remittance. What is your address?"</p>

<p>Raymond was patient during the formalities. When they were
completed he repeated his first question. The lawyer took a long
time to say:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am not empowered by my client to give you any such
information."</p>

<p>Damn the man! Why did he call her "my client" and not "your
wife"? Was the stigma of prison life to rob him for ever of even
the social amenities? Not even to know where she lived? There
flashed through his mind a sudden vision of a night when the
nightingales sang in a Devonshire garden and the swift avowal of
love passed from lip to lip. Could love like that die utterly?
Could passion vanish upon the wind, like the skeleton of a dead
leaf? He repeated inanely:</p>

<p>"Your client. Your client. I see." Then with greater
vehemence:</p>

<p>"Perhaps then you can give me the address of my son?"</p>

<p>The lawyer was enjoying the spectacle of his helplessness. He
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I cannot even give you that information."</p>

<p>Raymond saw red.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" he screamed. "He's my boy. He's as much my boy as
hers&mdash;more, I tell you. Who the devil are you to hold my son
from me?"</p>

<p>"You are a little unstrung, Mr. Calverley."</p>

<p>"Unstrung! If you had been five-and-a-quarter years in
prison&mdash;five thousand years in prison&mdash;your heart aching
all the time for your boy&mdash;and the day you are released some
stranger tells you that he will not tell you where he
is&mdash;wouldn't you be unstrung?"</p>

<p>The lawyer replied in dead level tones:</p>

<p>"I cannot tell where your son is, because&mdash;I do not
know."</p>

<p>"You do not know!"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I do not know."</p>

<p>Raymond gave a whine, like a dog that has been struck. He groped
for his hat upon the table. As he did so his eye alighted on a pile
of correspondence. One letter was projecting a little from the
rest. It was headed: Hotel Marguerita. Pau. Just below was the top
of a capital D. He recognised it as the way Kathleen formed this
letter. His face betrayed no recognition. He stumbled from the
room.</p>

<p>He would telegraph to Kathleen. Would she still be there? The
world seemed terribly harsh. His mind was constantly irrupted by
visions of Dartmoor, and strangely enough they were not unfriendly
visions. Dolling, who was serving twelve years for manslaughter,
and with whom he had had many whispered chats in the carpenter's
shop&mdash;Dolling would be missing him. Two young warders, Garrod
and Purvis, both had done him innumerable petty services. The moors
would be grand under this mottled sky...some queer pull about the
place...when you're utterly lonely.</p>

<p>He went to a post office and sent a telegram to his wife at Pau.
He said:</p>

<p>"Am at Bond's hotel Paddington where is Ralph."</p>

<p>He tried to think of any friend he could go to in the meantime.
He reviewed his old life and it seemed to reflect&mdash;clubs and
pubs! He could never get into a club again, and pubs did not
attract him. The illusory nature of friendships made in this way
became clear to him. He would have to go abroad&mdash;America
perhaps. If only he could find Ralph!</p>

<p>He waited for three days, and no telegram came from Kathleen. He
wandered the streets and sat in public libraries, reading the
newspapers and magazines, and trying to adj ust his mind to the
social question. Human activities as recorded in these productions
appeared to him complicated and futile. In the old days he had not
seen them in this light. Perhaps he had not troubled to think about
them. He had just accepted things as they were. Upon one matter he
made up his mind definitely&mdash;he would find work. He would not
go on accepting his wife's money in this ignominious manner.</p>

<p>On the third day he decided to go down to Ashtree, the village
in Suffolk, where Ralph spent part of his time with the tutor. It
was strange that the boy had made no effort to see him.</p>

<p>He arrived at Ashtree at dusk and left his bag at the local inn.
He then asked for the house of Mr. Flanders, the tutor. With
considerable difficulty he found it. It was over a mile from the
village. His heart was beating violently when he rang the bell. A
servant opened the door.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Flanders in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, what name?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Calverley."</p>

<p>She looked at him a little queerly, but showed him into a
sitting-room. In a few moments a thin elderly man entered the room.
He started at sight of his visitor, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought it was&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he stopped and scrutinized Raymond keenly.</p>

<p>"I came to ask after my son."</p>

<p>The elder man appeared very surprised. He stammered
slightly.</p>

<p>"Your son? Your son? Yes. Yes, of course, your son. But he went
up to London. He went up to&mdash;er&mdash;meet you, I
understand."</p>

<p>"To meet me! but I haven't seen him. I expected him."</p>

<p>"H'm. Very strange, Mr. Calverley. I'm afraid I can't help
you."</p>

<p>This respectable tutor, whom only poverty had driven to accept
the tutelage of the son of a convict, was obviously anxious to be
rid of the dilemma. With a few formal expressions of regret they
parted. Raymond returned to the inn, and found that there was no
train back to London that night.</p>

<p>He slept fitfully. What had happened to Ralph? Fear gripped him.
He visualized all kinds of terrible things happening to the
boy&mdash;accidents. The cup and the lip...oh, the grim irony of
it! After living that eternity and then on the very day of his
release&mdash;a skidding car perhaps, a train smash, a fall. At
that moment Ralph might lie groaning in a hospital, calling for
him. There was only one gleam of brightness in his sombre
reflections&mdash;Ralph had meant to meet him. The tutor had said
that hepiad gone to London on purpose. Freedom is a fine thing,
butlove is greater than freedom. Indeed, freedom without love is a
negative endurance. Before the dawn broke he had designed plans to
find his son. He would enquire at the police stations and
hospitals. He would put an advertisement in the agony column of the
<i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>And when he arrived in London that was the first thing he did.
He inserted:</p>

<p>"To Ralph Calverley. Am at Bond's Hotel, Paddington.
Father."</p>

<p>He then rang up the police stations and hospitals. No, no one
answering to the description of his son had been heard of.</p>

<p>He walked the streets disconsolately. London suddenly became a
city of menace and despair. The people appeared hard-featured and
cruel, beasts of prey stalking their victims, utterly indifferent
to the feelings and passions of each other. The drone of the
traffic was like the whirring of some great machine, grinding the
bones and blood of men and women into a colourless pulp. He had
never felt so lonely in his cell at Dartmoor.</p>

<p>Backwards and forwards between his hotel and the police station
he walked for several days. No answer came to the advertisement in
the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>One afternoon passing down a meagre street off the Edgware Road,
he saw a poor bedraggled woman weeping on another's bosom.</p>

<p>As he passed he heard her say:</p>

<p>"The y 'im 'cause 'e was out of work and stole for us. And now
they're turning us out&mdash;me and the five kids. What are we
going to do? Oh, my Gawd!"</p>

<p>And he heard the other woman, who was also poorly but rather
flashily dressed, one who wanders the streets, glancing
obliquely&mdash;he heard her say:</p>

<p>"Sorl right, Annie, don't you worry. I'll earn money for yer.
I'll keep yer goin' till things get brighter."</p>

<p>Without a second's hesitation Raymond dived his hand into his
pocket and drew out all the money he had on him, nearly two pounds.
He thrust it into the hands of the weeping woman.</p>

<p>"Go on with this, mother," he said huskily.</p>

<p>The woman stared at him, too amazed to speak. The other
said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, who are you?"</p>

<p>And they looked into each other's eyes, this ex-convict and this
woman who wandered the streets glancing obliquely, and the former
said:</p>

<p>"I'm like you. I'm one of the lonely ones."</p>

<p>And he hurried away. Back in his hotel, he went up to his room
and sat on the edge of his bed, as he had sat on the edge of his
bed in that cell at Dartmoor, pondering, pondering...It was dusk.
The working parties would be returning from the quarries. There
would be whispered talks together, glints of light from the
governor's house, the drone of the organ in the chapel...someone
practising for to-morrow's service.</p>

<p>"Lead Kindly Light<br>
Amidst the encircling gloom."</p>

<p>Oh, the weariness of it all! the injustice! His heart throbbed
to the beat of that haunting melody. In a grey vision he seemed to
see an endless procession walking, two and two, to the slow measure
of that hymn&mdash;all the unhappy in the world, the outcast, and
the weak. His breast was choked with sobs. He gripped the coverlet
of the bed and muttered:</p>

<p>"Ralph! Ralph! oh, my boy, my little boy!"</p>

<p>The room grew darker, outside the traffic still roared
relentlessly. He was about to throw himself on the bed, when the
door opened quietly. A figure glided in and stood with its back to
it. He peered forward, and saw a white ghostly face with hollow
eyes, regarding him fearfully. He tried to stand up but fell back
weakly on the bed. The figure said:</p>

<p>"Is that you, father?"</p>

<p>He stretched out his hands and groaned. The figure came nearer,
and then shrank back again to the door. Raymond forced himself to
rise. He beat the air with his arms, as though fearful that there
were forces at work trying to keep him from his son.</p>

<p>"Ralph! Ralph! oh, my boy, my little boy!"</p>

<p>And as he advanced so did the other shrink back further.</p>

<p>His voice, husky with passion, called out:</p>

<p>"Ralph! Ralph! you're not ashamed of your old father?"</p>

<p>And still the figure cowered furtively by the door. He went
close up and peered into his son's eyes.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ralph? What's the matter? My God! you look as
though it was you who had committed a crime and not I."</p>

<p>The figure still seemed to be warding him off and the voice said
faintly:</p>

<p>"It is I who have committed a crime."</p>

<p>And then the tension broke. The boy sobbed, and the father held
him in his arms at last.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ralph? Tell me. Tell your father, boy. Who should
not hear of it if not I?"</p>

<p>"For God's sake let me sit down. I'm so tired. I've been
wandering all night. I saw your advertisement this morning. And
even then I could not make up my mind to come. I'm so ashamed."</p>

<p>"Ashamed! Am I so pure? Am I likely not to forgive&mdash;not to
understand my son?"</p>

<p>The boy buried his face in his hands and spoke between his
fingers.</p>

<p>"I've been living foolishly, father, oh! for years now. Mother
spoilt me, gave me lots of money. I got into a funny
crowd&mdash;betting, drinking, women. She paid my debts again and
again. Last Tuesday Lcame up from Ashtree. I had meant to go down
to Dartmoor and meet you at the prison gates. But in the afternoon
I met Reggie de Tourneville. He was staying at the Grand Eclipse
Hotel He asked me to dine with him; then we went up to his room and
had a few drinks. Afterwards we went on to some funny joint at
Knightsbridge and played cards. There were a crowd of people there
and we played baccarat, I won a hundred pounds in about twenty
minutes With the excitement of that and the wine I had drunk I
simply went off the deep end. I thought I couldn't lose. I plunged
wildly. I loved the excitement, people watching me, pretty women,
you know, and all that kind of thing. Then of course I began to
lose. My luck varied but at about one in the morning I had lost
four hundred pounds. I hadn't got it in the world. I had borrowed a
hundred and fifty from Reggie. I didn't know where mother was.
Besides, she had helped me out so often. She had left Pau. I think
she was on her way home. I hadn't enough left to pay my hotel bill
or the fare down to Dartmoor. I woke up the next morning feeling
awful I wandered about the streets wondering what to do. And then
I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The father's breath was coming in little stabs.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ralph, what did you do, boy?"</p>

<p>"Oh I mucked the whole day away. I hadn t the the courage. It
was the next day I did it, the day you came out of prison, and I
never met you Reggie had treated me badly, I think. He woifldn t
lend me any more. I'm not sure the whole thing wasn t a plant. They
got me there. There were other young chaps, too Any way, I kept on
thinking of Reggie's room at the Grand Eclipse. When he lent me the
money he had gone to a box which he kept locked up in a trunk. It
was stuffed with notes. Late in the evening of that day I yielded
to temptation. Reggie had gone out to dinner. I went up to one of
the clerks downstairs and said casually:</p>

<p>"'Key of Number 141, please.' You know what those big hotels
are. Nobody knows anything about anyone. There are dozens of
clerks. He gave me the key. I went up by the stairs, and into his
room. I forced the lock of the trunk with a poker, but I couldn't
force the lock of the box. So I simply wrapped it up in paper and
took it away. I took it back to my hotel. Then I borrowed a
screwdriver and some pincers. I got it open somehow. Oh, God! what
have I done? There were bonds and papers and all kinds of things
and nearly three hundred pounds in cash. I never meant to take all
that. I just wanted enough to carry on with."</p>

<p>"What have you done with it?" whispered the hoarse voice of the
father.</p>

<p>"I've spent some of the money. All the other things I ve kept. I
left the hotel, of course, and have gone to another one South of
the river."</p>

<p>"What was the money in?"</p>

<p>"Treasury notes and fives, tens, and twenties."</p>

<p>"Have you changed any of the big notes?"</p>

<p>"I've changed one ten."</p>

<p>"You fool!"</p>

<p>"Why!"</p>

<p>"They'll trace the number. Where did you change it?"</p>

<p>"At Cook's. I've taken a ticket for Paris to-night."</p>

<p>"Would anybody at the hotel be likely to identify you?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm not sure. There are over a thousand passing
through every day."</p>

<p>"Reggie will suspect you, of course."</p>

<p>"He's bound to, after what happened. Oh father what can I do?
I'm terrified. It means&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was my fault, boy, my crime which led to it. I should have
been here to look after you."</p>

<p>"No, no, I've no excuse. I'm finished. And oh, father, I've been
so yearning to have you back."</p>

<p>The young man broke down and wept. Raymond pulled himself up. He
paced the room for several minutes in silence. Then he said
tensely:</p>

<p>"Ralph, boy, go and fetch me that box."</p>

<p>"Fetch it! Why father?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, carefully. This happened on the night I came out
of prison. Fetch me that box. <i>You</i> did not steal that box,
Ralph!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"These old criminals! It's the same story. It's in the blood.
You can do nothing for them. Directly they are released they start
all over again&mdash;the very same day sometimes. You'll read all
this in the papers in two days' time."</p>

<p>He laughed bitterly, and the young man looked up amazed.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you'd sacrifice yourself for me like
that? Oh, I couldn't let you do it, father."</p>

<p>"Why not? If you strolled into an hotel and asked for a key and
got it, why should not I, an old ex-convict? Besides, I am strong
now. I could endure it. I have nothing more to live for. Your life
is just beginning. But, oh, Ralph, boy, promise me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, no, father, I should go mad with remorse. I couldn't
let you...oh!"</p>

<p>He gave a low scream of fright for at that moment there was a
crisp tap on the door. When the door opened the father was standing
as though at attention on parade, the son was cowering against the
further wall. In the doorway stood Kathleen. They looked at each
other, but no one spoke. Then she turned and shut the door quietly,
and stood with her back to it. Her face was pale and drawn, and it
suddenly flashed through Raymond that in this company of his wife
and his son, he was the only one of flesh and blood. In the crisis
which was about to spring on the three of them, it would be
he&mdash;the ex-convict&mdash;who would have to hold the balance.
Strangely enough she turned to him first, and her voice was gentle.
She said:</p>

<p>"You are free, then, Raymond. I saw your advertisement, and I
came to find out what it's all about. I arrived in England
yesterday."</p>

<p>He bowed his head.</p>

<p>"I am free," he answered, "but I'm afraid not for long."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I have already got into mischief again."</p>

<p>The boy jumped up.</p>

<p>"It's a lie, mother. He is trying to shield me. I stole some
money the day he came out, and he wants to make out it was he."</p>

<p>Kathleen's eyes glittered and a tear came into them.</p>

<p>"Ralph! Ralph! don't tell me this is true."</p>

<p>The boy swept to her and flung his arms around her.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, save me. What am I to do? They'll catch me. I know
they'll catch me. I've taken a ticket for Paris, but there'll be a
man waiting there. He'll tap me on the shoulder. I've seen it all a
hundred times these last few days."</p>

<p>"Why did you do this, Ralph? Have I not helped you before? I
prayed to you to be less extravagant, but you know I would have
helped you again rather than&mdash;"</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands and wept.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear God! My husband and then my son, both&mdash;"</p>

<p>Raymond went to her and grasped her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, it is only through the eyes of suffering that one
sees things clearly and sees them whole. I have suffered and I have
learnt to see. It is the life of ease that dulls one and breeds
temptation. Give this boy a chance. You have given him everything
else, but they have always been the wrong things. Don't let him go
to Paris, let him go to where there are great open spaces, and life
is a battle to survive. As for this money, what does it matter to
me? I have accustomed myself to prison life. I shall be an old
'lag' in time, one who probably prefers prison life to
freedom."</p>

<p>A queer expression crept over Kathleen's face as she regarded
her husband. She said simply:</p>

<p>"You have changed, Raymond."</p>

<p>They were summng up in each other the toll of those five years.
His hair had turned quite grey, but his figure was firmer and more
erect, his eye clearer, and his skin healthier. She had become more
fragile, her face paler, but she was still a beautiful woman. She
turned suddenly to Ralph and said:</p>

<p>"Whom did you steal this money from?"</p>

<p>"Reggie de Tourneville."</p>

<p>Kathleen started, and her figure appeared to sway.</p>

<p>"Reggie de Tourneville!"</p>

<p>She put her hand to her bosom.</p>

<p>"Wait...wait..." she muttered. "Reggie de Tourneville!
Indeed!"</p>

<p>She seated herself and pondered. At last she said:</p>

<p>"Ralph, do you love your mother?"</p>

<p>"Mother, how can you ask?"</p>

<p>"Kiss me, dear."</p>

<p>Ralph flung his arms around her and kissed her. She sighed
contentedly.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "you wait here, you two. I know Reggie de
Tourneville. I have an idea I can settle this affair with him."</p>

<p>"No, no, mother, you mustn't demean yourself to that swine. He
will only snub you, be rude to you. He has an awful reputation in
every way. He's rich too, you can't buy him off."</p>

<p>"I can try. Wait for me, I may be some time. Do not move from
this room."</p>

<p>And before they could protest she had gone.</p>

<p>The night was cold, and the wind and rain battered against the
window panes of the little room. Father and son sat, one on the
bed, the other on a chair, listening and waiting. There seemed to
be nothing to say in this fateful interlude, or there was so much
to say that their strained voices would make it seem unreal. The
boat train to Paris went, and the dinner hour came and went. It was
nine o'clock and Ralph said:</p>

<p>"She's a long time, father."</p>

<p>"Yes...yes, she's a long time."</p>

<p>Raymond was indeed restless and nervous, and sometimes he would
jump up and pace the room. Ralph lighted a cigarette and offered
his father one, but the latter would not take it. The room got
colder and colder. At a quarter past ten Ralph said peevishly:</p>

<p>"What's she doing, father? She's an awful long time."</p>

<p>And Raymond replied a little hysterically:</p>

<p>"She's settling up! She's settling up!"</p>

<p>And about every ten minutes Ralph would exclaim:</p>

<p>"I wonder where she is. What is she doing, father? Why doesn't
she hurry up?"</p>

<p>And Raymond had no response to make.</p>

<p>Came eleven o'clock, half past, a quarter to twelve, midnight,
and still the two men sat there feverishly waiting. The ghosts in
this meagre hotel had all retired. At a quarter past twelve Ralph
was repeating his litany:</p>

<p>"What is she doing? Why doesn't she come, father?" when the
latter suddenly exclaimed irritably:</p>

<p>"The parents sacrifice themselves for the children. And then the
children grow up and sacrifice themselves for their children and so
it goes on. The story of life is an epic of suffering and
sacrifice. Birth is the tyrant." Then he lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>At a quarter to one Ralph exclaimed: "Listen."</p>

<p>There were footsteps in the corridor outside. The door opened
and Kathleen stood once more before them. Her face was pale except
for a spot in the centre of the cheeks, as though they had been
slightly rouged. Her eyes sunk in their dark hollows, had an
unnatural glitter. She sat down limply at the foot of the bed. The
boy, his voice sounding reedy and thin, called out:</p>

<p>"Well? Well?"</p>

<p>Speaking quietly and with perfect control, Kathleen said:</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning, Ralph, you will send that box back to Reggie
de Toumeville, with all the bonds and papers. The money I have
settled about. I think your father is right. I think it would be
good for you to go away for a time, to Canada perhaps."</p>

<p>"Canada!"</p>

<p>"I have been thinking about it, coming back in the cab. All
these years that your father has&mdash;has been away, I have
treated you too indulgently. I have perhaps been too indulgent
myself. One's moral fibre slackens."</p>

<p>She gave a little sob, and the son threw his arms around
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I will do anything you tell me."</p>

<p>She stroked his hair and whispered:</p>

<p>"There, there, dear, let us forget all about it, and start
again. Now go. I want to speak to your father alone."</p>

<p>The boy embraced them both, then picked up his hat, and stumbled
from the room.</p>

<p>Raymond waited for his wife to speak, but she sat there looking
down at her hands upon her lap. At last he said:</p>

<p>"Well, Kathleen, what have you to say to me?"</p>

<p>"I'm very, very tired, Raymond."</p>

<p>He went up to her and kissed her lightly on the temple.</p>

<p>"Is that all, my dear?"</p>

<p>"No, can't you feel there's something more?"</p>

<p>He gripped her shoulders firmly.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, is it possible...would you after all&mdash;take me
back?"</p>

<p>She whispered almost inaudibly:</p>

<p>"If you think I'm worthy of you."</p>

<p>The ex-convict laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"We all have things to regret, Kathleen...Ralph and I and even
you, perhaps. The fiercest joy is to know that one has someone to
suffer for, someone who can make one suffer. During the last few
days I have experienced the appalling loneliness of the crowded
streets. But if you put your ear to the ground you hear the eternal
rumble of pity passing from heart to heart. Only to-day I heard a
woman offering to sacrifice herself for another. Even in prison I
found this. It is the only Jhing that makes life worth while."</p>

<p>"Oh, Raymond, I was terrified of you returning from prison. I
thought you would look criminal and bitter, but somehow you look
finer. Come, give me your strong arms. I am so weary."</p>

<p>He crushed her to him and murmured:</p>

<p>"I will come for you to-morrow, dear."</p>

<p>For several minutes they clung to each other. Then he led her to
the door, and opened it.</p>

<p>"The corridor is dark," she whispered.</p>

<p>He took her hand and whispered back:</p>

<p>"Yes, it is dark, but there is a light at the end. And if we
hold each other's hands tightly we will find a way."</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>12. The Mother of Carmen
Colignon</h2>

<p class="cpb">I</p>

<p>If one Sunday morning you wander up the Rue Cadec in Montmartre
and lose yourself in the picturesque confusion of the market in
that narrow fairway&mdash;or perhaps you may have to go a little
further afield, round the corner in the Rue des Abesses&mdash;in
any case, in one of these delightful streets you are almost bound
to meet a very old lady who is always an object of universal
interest. She is very old, fragile, and bent. She leans for support
upon a stout hickory stick. In the other hand she carries a string
bag, revealing her modest purchases of leeks, <i>salsifis</i>,
bread, fish,' and candles. She appears to be a very popular figure
in the market. The men touch their hats and smile friendlily. The
women call out:</p>

<p>"Good morning, maman. May God preserve you!"</p>

<p>And her face lights up with an enchanting smile that is in some
queer way younger than her body. It is the smile of a young and
simple soul, easily flattered, sensitive to affection or
indifference. Antiquity has a beauty of its own. When all the
passions are dim memories, all the discords inaudible, all the
memories themselves mellowed by long years of serene detachment,
the face takes on an expression of spiritual beauty that makes one
wonder whether the owner were half so beautiful in the lambent
years of youth.</p>

<p>Now if you are a stranger, and you ask one of the habitués of
the market:</p>

<p>"Who is the dear old lady?"</p>

<p>You will receive a reply given eagerly and proudly:</p>

<p>"Oh, that? Don't you know, monsieur, that is the mother of
Carmen Colignon."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" you may reply, "and who is, or was, Carmen
Colignon?"</p>

<p>And then a most curious thing happens. Your fellow marketer
looks a little bewildered. If it is a man he probably tilts his hat
on one side and scratches his head behind the ear. If a woman, she
probably taps her cheek with a large latch-key, and then pouts and
shakes her head. But whichever sex your marketer may be, you will
assuredly get some such answer as this:</p>

<p>"Eh? H'm! Well, now, since you mention it, monsieur, upon my
soul I couldn't rightly tell you at the moment. Carmen Colignon?
Well, yes, she was&mdash;what was she? A singer? An actress? It has
escaped my memory. But that is her mother, I assure you, monsieur.
We always address her as such, "the mother of Carmen
Colignon.'"</p>

<p>Well, well, what would you? The life of the streets, the life of
the boulevards&mdash;indeed, all life is a fluid business. It flows
past us, leaving a trail of fading memories, impressing upon us one
central fact&mdash;that fame is a transitory thing, but that love
and beauty have an endurance of their own.</p>

<p class="cpb">II</p>

<p>Near the village of Cambo-les-Bains, at the foot of the
Pyrenees, there dwelt a small farmer named Raymond Marcillac with
his two sons and two daughters. He was regarded as a queer old
fish, taciturn and reserved, and somewhat quick-tempered, a
difficult man to know. After twenty years of a somewhat fractious
married life his wife had died. Monsieur and Madame Marcillac had
never been on the best of terms. She was a chicken-headed woman,
used to city life, and she had never adapted herself to the farm.
She was, moreover, considerably younger than her husband. Monsieur
Marcillac was now fifty-three, and one might have predicted that
the lamp of romance would have respectably guttered and died out.
But oh, dear, no! There came to Cambo a widow named Goud-chaux, who
was a consumptive, and her daughter, Honorine. They stayed at a
little sanatorium just adjoining the farm. Calling there one day to
deliver some butter, he chanced to meet the daughter, Honorine, in
the garden. He got into conversation with her. No one knows what
was said on either side, but immediately after the visit the
neighbours noted a striking and significant change in Monsieur
Marcillac. His unkempt beard was trimmed. He scrubbed his hands and
face at least twice a day. He bought a new suit and some smart
boots. He made curious noises at his work, which some declared to
be singing. And every day he made some excuse for calling at the
sanatorium.</p>

<p>Six months later he married Honorine Goudchaux, who was then in
her twenty-seventh year. Her mother had died, and she went to live
at the farm with Monsieur Marcillac and his two sons and
daughters.</p>

<p>It is difficult to discover what attraction the uncouth farmer,
who was twice her age, could have had for Honorine. But there!
these things do happen, and sometimes happen quite satisfactorily.
She was a tall woman, rather clumsily built; a simple soul,
refined, sensitive, and though by no means handsome, she had a
certain appealing charm by virtue of her transparent sincerity and
honesty of outlook. She loved her husband, and she made him a
devoted wife. All might have been well but for the children of
Monsieur Marcillac.</p>

<p>The two girls, Jeanne and Louise, were now respectively sixteen
and eighteen. They had been badly brought up. Their mother had
either neglected or spoilt them, and since her death they had lived
a life of idleness and indulgence. They naturally resented the
intrusion of this interloper, who was not only going to monopolise
their father's afiections but his property and savings. The sons
also resented it, but they were of less consequence in the affair,
as shortly afterwards they both married, and one went into the com
chandler's profession at Bayonne, whilst the other went to live on
an adjoining farm.</p>

<p class="cpb">III</p>

<p>These two daughters of Monsieur Marcillac soon set to work to
make their stepmother's life a misery. Coldly polite to her before
their father, they tyrannised her directly his back was turned. And
she was a good subject for tyranny, being sensitive and
warm-hearted. She did her utmost to be friendly to the girls, but
all her advances were repulsed. They sneered at her and mimicked
her, and saw to it that all the heavy work of the farmhouse fell
upon her shoulders.</p>

<p>After the early repulses she accepted the situation with
complacency. She was not unhappy. She worked hard and cheerfully,
and always met her husband with a bright smile. She said nothing to
him about the way his daughters treated her. And he, poor man,
sensed nothing of the antagonism. His daughters feared him. He had
an uncompromising way of dealing with disobedience and disrespect,
a way in which physical force was strikingly evident.</p>

<p>His new wife delighted him. When his day's work was done, he
would return to the house, and the family would sup together.
Afterwards he and his wife would sit out in the garden side by
side. They were not a talkative couple. Honorine seemed to be
satisfied just to be by his side, mending his socks or making up a
frock. Monsieur Marcillac would smoke his pipe and read the
newspaper. Sometimes he would put the paper down and talk to her
about the prospects of root crops, or the prices pigs were fetching
in the market at Biarritz. And Honorine would be enchanted. At
night beautiful dreams would come to her. In the twilight hour
between sleeping and waking she would be conscious of a mysterious
outflow of intense happiness...</p>

<p>The child was born the following year, and what a to-do there
was! Monsieur Marcillac was overjoyed. There was a baptism and a
feast, and the little girl was called Yvonne.</p>

<p>Now if the two daughters resented the intrusion of the mother,
the arrival of Yvonne added gall to their bitterness. Apart from
the importunacy of the "squealing brat"&mdash;as they called
it&mdash;it soldified the mother's side of the affair, and caused
the withdrawal from the work of the farmhouse of its most active
and efficient helper.</p>

<p>Monsieur Marcillac, moreover, quickly showed that of all his
children this was to be the favourite. He was for ever hovering
over the cot and nursing the little mite in his arms.</p>

<p>This strange household functioned without any outward hint of
cleavage for five years. It takes two parties to make a quarrel,
and Honorine refused to quarrel. She submitted to every kind of
insult and gibe. In only one particular did she assert her right
and authority&mdash;the child. She knew she could not trust the two
girls. They were capable of any criminal act. One day Louise
smacked Yvonne for no other reason than that she was crying.
Honorine flew at her and pushed her into a corner; then picking up
a carving fork she said, in accents the passionate quality of which
could not be misunderstood:</p>

<p>"If you ever touch my child again I will kill you."</p>

<p>Yvonne was left alone after that, but the mother was treated
more cruelly than ever. At five years of age Yvonne was a beautiful
child, quick and vivacious, with bright malicious eyes. Louise
became engaged to a small tenant farmer named Bartholomé
Ombrédanne. Soon, perhaps she would marry and go away&mdash;Jeanne
also. Everything would turn out well; Honorine held her course. In
any case they could not destroy her dreams...</p>

<p>And then one morning Monsieur Marcillac complained of a sore
foot. He had trodden on a rusty spike a few days previously and had
neglected it. A doctor was fetched. The wound was treated, and he
was ordered to stay in bed for several days. He did, indeed, stay
in bed for one day, but the next morning he awoke at dawn and said
to his wife:</p>

<p>"Honorine, my angel, who is taking those calves to the market at
Biarritz?"</p>

<p>"Jacques, beloved."</p>

<p>"Jacques! A pretty dolt to handle such a deal. He'll sell the
lot for a capful of sous."</p>

<p>And without more ado he rose from his bed. Honorine protested,
cajoled, and even wept, but she could not dissuade him. He
struggled into his clothes, limped down into the yard, saddled the
mare, got the calves roped into the cart, and drove off.</p>

<p>He returned early in the afternoon. His face was white, and he
was suffering great pain. Honorine got him to bed, and the doctor
was fetched. Everything that local knowledge, science, and skill
could do was done, but Monsieur Marcillac died within forty-eight
hours from blood-poisoning.</p>

<p class="cpb">IV</p>

<p>It was some weeks before Madame Marcillac recovered from the
first shock of her great grief. When she was once more able to
guage the measure of her working life, she found herself facing a
formidable situation. Monsieur Marcillac had made a will. It was a
most elaborate will, displaying that relish for meticulous detail
which is so characteristic of the French peasant. It might have
been the will of some huge landed proprietor rather than that of a
small peasant farmer. He had evidently devoted a lot of thought to
it. In effect, it amounted to the direction that the farm was to be
held in trust for Yvonne. Honorine,</p>

<p>the eldest son, and Monsieur Ombredanne were appointed trustees.
The bulk of the profits were to go to Honorine during her lifetime.
At the same time a share of the profits was to go to his two
daughters, who were to be allowed to remain at the farmhouse, and
who he trusted would always treat his wife and her child with
"Christian devotion and affection." It was further decreed that
Monsieur Ombredanne was to be appointed overseer at a fixed salary.
He left various small sums of money to his sons and friends, and
the furniture to his wife.</p>

<p>One day the son, together with Ombredanne, and a notary named
Pironneau, arrived to discuss the arrangements about the execution
of the will and the future conduct of the farm. Honorine was called
in, but they hardly addressed her. They talked animatedly about
legal terms which she did not understand. This Ombredanne was an
insolent, good-looking, youngish man, with a fair beard, large
flashing eyes, and slightly protruding teeth.</p>

<p>It was not till some time later that she realised that the
salary fixed for the overseer was considerably in excess of what
the small farm would stand. It was equally apparent that these
three men were hand in glove. She signed all the documents set
before her. And the realisation came too late that until Yvonne
came of age she was to be little more than an underpaid drudge. She
was tied to the farm, committed to live with the two sisters, and
was entirely in the hands of Ombredanne and the others so far as
finance was concerned.</p>

<p>She bowed to the situation for the sake of her child. Nothing
mattered provided little Yvonne had all that she required. And the
farm certainly supplied that. There was always milk and eggs, and
butter and bacon. But when it came to money&mdash;that was a
different story. There was machinery to buy, a barn to be
re-roofed, seeds and meal to be bought&mdash;Monsieur Marcillac had
been apparently very negligent. At the end of the first quarter it
was explained to her that the farm had made no profit at all. She
wanted money for clothes and boots both for herself and the child.
There was much shaking of heads, much elaborate explanation. Ah!
no, Madame Marcillac must wait. Perhaps after the harvest.</p>

<p>During the whole period of Ombredanne's overseership she never
managed to get out of him more than a few hundred francs a year.
She was forced to go shabby, to cut up clothes to make things for
the child, to slop about the house in old shoes. It would not have
been so bad&mdash;there was a fierce exaltation in the sense of
self-sacrifice for her little one&mdash;if only...She could
sometimes hear their cruel laughter, their whispers together, and
then Jeanne and Louise would go out smartly dressed, and they would
go for drives in the governess cart with Ombrédanne, and visit
travelling booths and fairs. After a decent period&mdash;for they
are very strict in those parts about the etiquette of
grief&mdash;it was announced that Louise and Ombredanne were going
to get married. It was also put to her, without equivocation, that
the room she occupied was far too large for a single person. It was
the only room in the house suitable to a married couple. Times had
changed, etc.</p>

<p>Well, well, little Yvonne was nearly six, and could run and
talk. There was no reason why she should not be happy in the room
above. It would be in any case farther out of the sound and
influence of the others. And so she gave up her bridal chamber and
moved up to the attic with her child. She was expected to do the
cooking and most of the housework, as well as attend to the poultry
and make and mend clothing for herself and Yvonne. And yet she
found happiness in all this. The sun would come aslant through the
open doorway, and she would peep out and behold visions of green
maize through a trellis of pollard oak trees, and down below the
pale blue ribbon of the Nive creeping from between the shoulders of
majestic hills. And in her heart she sang as she took little Yvonne
to the village school in the morning, and listened to her prattle
when they returned hand in hand across the fields in the evening.
She was a mother.</p>

<p class="cpb">V</p>

<p>As the years advanced her antipathies to the Ombre-danne
farmstead&mdash;he had now established himself as the
master&mdash;became finer and more acute. They were less coloured
by physical and material issues than by spiritual ones. Monsieur
Ombredanne was unscrupulous and selfish, but he was not altogether
a cad and a bully. He was rather seduced by the attractiveness of
Yvonne, who was indeed a fascinating child. He would sometimes
spoil her&mdash;give her sweets that were bad for her, pinch her
cheeks, and call her a little "bagful of sunshine." Sometimes he
would drink brandy and be loose in his conversation; he would say
things that bewildered and confused the child. The two sisters
showed no signs of living down their animosity. They seemed to
exult in saying unkind and improper things to Honorine in her
little daughter's presence, and the child was beginning to
understand. Something would have to be done.</p>

<p>One day she went to see the notary, Pironneau. With considerable
trepidation she unfolded her plan. The furniture had been left her
by her husband. She wished to sell it, and with the proceeds go to
another part of the country with her daughter. Monsieur Pironneau
put on his steel-rimmed spectacles and regarded her critically. He
then produced the papers relating to the estate. Placing a blue
form before her, he said laconically:</p>

<p>"You must have forgotten, Madame Marcillac, that you signed this
paper agreeing not to sell the furniture until your daughter
inherits the property."</p>

<p>She shrank from his unfriendly glance. "Yes, I had
forgotten."</p>

<p>Going back across the fields she heard a lark singing at some
invisible altitude. Apple blossoms were beginning to fall. Spring
was merging into summer.</p>

<p>"Never mind, my little one," she murmured, "a way shall be
found."</p>

<p>Nevertheless she remained two years more at the farm. And then
Louise had a baby, and Monsieur Ombrédanne drank more brandy and
sometimes became quarrelsome, and coarser and looser in his
behaviour; and Jeanne became more cantankerous because a young man
had made love to her, and then deserted her for another. And so one
day Honorine packed up her few small possessions and went away with
her daughter.</p>

<p class="cpb">VI</p>

<p>She obtained a situation at one of the little hotels catering
for invalids. It was seven miles from Cambo, on the outskirts of a
tiny village. The patron agreed to let her have the child, and they
slept in a room above the stables. Honorine's work began at six and
did not finish till the establishment closed at night, but she was
used to long hours. She had to scrub and scour, and wash the
saucepans and the blankets, in fact do all the heavy work of the
establishment, but it brought with it a sense of elation and
freedom. The patron soon realised her worth and was fairly kind and
considerate towards her. Yvonne went to the village school, and
played in the garden and learnt her lessons in a loft, where
Honorine strove to mould her mind, and night and morning they would
pray side by side. She was happier than at any time since her
husband's death. Sometimes she would awake abruptly at dawn, as
though caressed by invisible and loving arms, and she would
think:</p>

<p>"Why am I so happy?"</p>

<p>And she could not account for it. She would rise hastily and
make Yvonne's chocolate, and prepare eagerly for her day's work.
Perhaps she was happy because life is beautiful, and because her
own was directed by a singleness of purpose-love for her child. It
made her happy to make clothes for Yvonne when she herself was
tired to darn afid sew for her, to teach her and humour her,' to
suffer for her wilfulness.</p>

<p>And as the years passed she found that the occasions increased
when Yvonne made her suffer. She was spoilt at school, spoilt by
the visitors to the hotel, spoilt by neighbours and strangers. She
was already conscious of her prettiness and charm.</p>

<p>Madame Marcillac only partially realised this. Whatever faults
Yvonne might have, her mother took the blame upon herself. Neither
could she endure for an instant the little bursts of anger and
petulance when Yvonne was thwarted in her desires.</p>

<p>They stayed at this hotel for four years, and then Madame
Marcillac decided to make a change. She had saved up several
hundred francs, and she did not feel that Yvonne was getting the
opportunities for study and improvement which she might get in a
town.</p>

<p>They went to Biarritz, and took one room in a back street. Every
day she went out to work, and in the evening did sewing and
cleaning, or anything that came along. Nevertheless, she found life
here more precarious and harder. Everything was more expensive,
including Yvonne's education and the little extra luxuries she
increasingly demanded. At the end of the first year she had saved
nothing, and her daughter was clamouring for greater comforts. She
was of course incapable of understanding the situation. She mixed
with children in a better state of life, and she instinctively
nurtured a grudge against her mother because she did not supply her
with the luxuries these other children had.</p>

<p>Madame Marcillac struggled on. She worked late into the night
when Yvonne was asleep. She worked till her health gave way. She
would probably have worked herself into an early grave, but one day
she had a stroke of fortune. A neighbour brought her a Paris
newspaper in which was an advertisement by a firm of lawyers asking
for information regarding the whereabouts or existence of Honorine
Goudchaux, daughter of the late Monsieur and Madame Henri
Goudchaux. She wrote to the lawyers, who replied that if she were
indeed the individual advertised for, it would be worth her while
to go to Paris and interview them. Paris! But what a journey! What
an expense! How was it to be done? Could she endure the separation
from Yvonne?</p>

<p>But the same neighbour, having a shrewd suspicion that the money
would be well invested, offered to advance her her expenses.</p>

<p>And so one day, with much misgiving and heartburning over this
first separation from her beloved child, she set out for Paris
alone. The expedition was entirely satisfactory. She found the
lawyers and proved her identity. It appeared that her mother's
brother, who had lived in Athens and was in the currant trade, had
died intestate. He was unmarried, and Honorine was the only living
relative. The fortune he left, carefully invested, would bring her
in approximately twelve thousand francs a year.</p>

<p class="cpb">VII</p>

<p>On receipt of this news she felt bewildered and somewhat
apprehensive, as though she were appropriating something which by
rights belonged to others. And then suddenly she thought of Yvonne.
Yvonne! This meant clothes, presents, education, joy for Yvonne.
Comfort and security for ever, a dot on her marriage. Tears came
into her eyes as she thanked the lawyers.</p>

<p>When she returned to Biarritz her health broke down. She went to
Yvonne and flung her arms round her and kissed her, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Little one, everything is going to be better for you. You are
going to have frocks and better food, and a nice place to live in,
and a nice school, and everything you wish."</p>

<p>And then she trembled and burst into tears. She was obliged to
go to bed and remain there for many days. She could neither eat nor
sleep. A doctor came and gave her a powerful sleeping draught.</p>

<p>"You must have a long rest," he said, "you have been working too
hard."</p>

<p>The mother and daughter stayed in Biarritz for four more years.
At first the income seemed prodigious. She had no idea how far it
would go. But she quickly found that there was very little over
after they had moved to better quarters and she had paid for
Yvonne's schooling and her singing lessons and her multiplying
extravagances. The child was very advanced for her years. At the
age of sixteen she was already a woman, in many ways more
sophisticated than her mother. She could dance and sing, and look
at a man with that malicious gleam which predicates the
<i>cocotte</i>. But Honorine saw' nothing of this. Yvonne was
beyond all criticism.</p>

<p>One day she came to her mother and said:</p>

<p>"Maman, I am tired of this poky little town. Let us go and live
in Paris."</p>

<p>Paris! Why should they go and live in Paris? Honorine had got to
love this country, this little white town, the blue rolling waves
dancing against the rocks, the bold outline of the distant
Pyrenees, the happy Basque people in their native dress, the
tamarisks and eucalyptus trees. Paris! She sighed a little, knowing
that Yvonne would have her way.</p>

<p>And so it proved, for the following autumn the mother and child
went to live in Paris. They took a small apartment out in Levallois
Perret.</p>

<p>It took Honorine some time to accustom herself to the new
conditions. Paris was strange and bewildering. They knew no one
there, and the people were hard to deal with and unresponsive.
Yvonne announced her intention of having no more lessons except
dancing and singing, and so she attended a conservatoire in the Rue
Farzillan. It was known at that time&mdash;for some reason or
other&mdash;as the "Conservatoire Voltaire," and it was run by an
old gentleman named Sigogne, who had been a ballet master and
producer at several Parisian theatres.</p>

<p>At first Honorine was hardly conscious of the significance of
this determination of her daughter to devote herself to singing and
dancing. She was absorbed with the details of reconstructing their
new home, and only too happy that Yvonne was having what she
desired. As for Yvonne, she was deliriously happy. She found
herself suddenly plunged into a world which she had believed to be
unattainable. She was in Paris, the Mecca of her dreams. She met
girls who were going on the stage. She proved to her teachers that
she was a pupil of more than average promise.</p>

<p>At the end of six months Honorine received a visit from Monsieur
Sigogne. He was a tiny little bald-headed man, who looked like a
linnet. He hopped into the room and chirruped:</p>

<p>"Madame Marcillac, I congratulate you. Your daughter has great
talent. She shall stay with me for two years, and then she will go
far."</p>

<p>And patting her hands, he smiled, bowed, and took his departure
without another word. Even then Honorine did not entirely grasp the
significance of this new departure. It was brought home to her
slowly, in the fulness of time. It came about through their
friends. Honorine had few friends, but this deficit was more than
atoned for by her daughter. Yvonne rapidly formed a great circle of
passionate attachments. They were mostly fellow pupils or their
friends. They came flooding into the little apartment, and their
talk was all about stars, and salaries, and parts, and jealousies,
and scandals. They were amusing people, vain and naive,
self-centred, warm-hearted and impetuous. But Honorine was a little
frightened of them. Moreover they added considerably to the upkeep
of the establishment. They led Yvonne into extravagances which she
could not afford.</p>

<p>At the end of the first year she found they were living above
their means. She did not complain. She struggled on, denying
herself many little personal comforts. Then she heard these friends
talking among themselves. They were discussing the question of when
Yvonne would be ready, who she should go to, what line she should
take up, whether she should concentrate on singing or dancing.</p>

<p>One day when they were alone Madame Marcillac said to her
daughter:</p>

<p>"My darling, is it your intention to go on the stage?"</p>

<p>"But of course, my dear,"</p>

<p>Honorine looked down at her long fingers, lined and drawn with
years of toil. She heard her daughter add a little abruptly:</p>

<p>"I suppose you have no objection, mother?"</p>

<p>"No, little one...you must do as you desire," she said
quietly.</p>

<p>When rather less than nineteen, Yvonne went on the stage. She
obtained a small part in a musical comedy at Rouen. Honorine stayed
there with her. The piece ran for three months, but it gave Yvonne
little chance to distinguish herself. At the end of the run they
returned to Paris, and for a long time she got nothing else to do
at all. This early disappointment upset her badly. She became
querulous and bitter. It was Honorine who encouraged her, and
painted optimistic pictures of her future. It was nearly a year
before she got a small part in a musical piece that was to have an
extended tour. The salary was very small and after considerable
discussion it was decided that Honorine should not go with her. The
expense would be too great, and Yvonne seemed anxious to be left to
her own devices.</p>

<p>Honorine spent a lonely time in her little apartment. She wrote
to Yvonne every day. She sent her presents and all the money she
could spare, for Yvonne's salary was not large enough to live on in
the way she had recently become accustomed to. Yvonne replied
spasmodically. The longer she was away the less frequent became her
letters and when they came they were usually concerned with her
petty triumphs and conquests, and plaints concerning the expense of
living on tour.</p>

<p>Madame Marcillac decided that she must work. What could she do?
She had no skill or ability at anything except housework and
sewing. And she knew that Yvonne would be ashamed of her mother
occupying herself in this menial way. Nevertheless, she could not
remain idle, and something must be done to counteract her
daughter's extravagance. So she went out secretly and got work at a
<i>pension</i> near by. She worked nine hours daily, and at night
came home and wrote a cheery letter to her daughter, giving the
impression that she was leading a life of comfort and idleness.</p>

<p>When the tour finished Yvonne returned to Paris, and Honorine
deserted her <i>pension</i>, with a guilty feeling that she had
done wrong. It would be superfluous to chronicle the record of the
next three years of Yvonne's career. It was an ordinary story of
little successes and big disappointments. She ran into debt and
moved in strange company, whilst Honorine stood watchfully and
protectingly on the fringe of these experiences. But at the end of
the third year, she made a sudden leap to fame.</p>

<p class="cpb">VIII</p>

<p>A Jewish gentleman named Karl Matz saw her dance in a
<i>revue</i> at a cabaret in the Boulevard St. Martin. After the
performance he went round to see her. Without removing a cigar from
the corner of his mouth, he said:</p>

<p>"You are being badly managed. You can dance. I could do
something with you. Would you care for a contract?"</p>

<p>Care! Yvonne was beside herself with excitement, bhe signed the
contract with Monsieur Matz next day binding herself to him for
five years at a fixed salary' whether working or not.</p>

<p>It proved a highly satisfactory contract&mdash;for Monsieur
Matz.</p>

<p>He sent her to a dancing master, Poldini, to whom he gave very
precise instructions. He also told her that she must change her
name. Yvonne Marcillac sounded too sombre for a dancer. After a
good deal of discussion, it was decided that she was to be called
"Carmen Colignon." Three months later she appeared at the Folies
Bergeres in a ballet called <i>A Travers les Ages</i>. She was a
cave woman with bare legs and a panther skin in the opening act,
and in the last act a society woman in a snake skin. She made an
instantaneous hit.</p>

<p>Honorine watched the performance from the back of the
auditorium, and when she heard the roar of applause after Yvonne's
first dance tears trickled down her cheeks.</p>

<p>When the show was over she hurried behind to take her child
away. She found Yvonne surrounded by admirers. Her eyes were
dancing still. She was almost too excited to acknowledge her
mother, but when the latter whispered:</p>

<p>"Come, my little one, you must come home to supper; you will be
tired." The daughter replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I shan't be coming home to supper tonight. I've
promised to go out with Monsieur Matz and Mademoiselle Folvary and
some of the others."</p>

<p>That was the beginning of Honorine's tragic phase, doubly tragic
by reason of her own foresight of what was going to happen. One may
give to another one's life's blood, one's love, and passion, and
devotion, but one cannot make that other love one as one may desire
to be loved. Yvonne did not really love her mother. She was fond of
her, and she relied upon her, and respected her, but her real love
was the glamour of success. In the years that followed it
intoxicated her. She became the rage of Paris, and Monsieur Matz
became a rich man.</p>

<p>The more successful she became the more indifferent she became
towards her mother, and the more devoted her mother became to her.
She watched over her, and tended her, and prayed for her. When
Yvonne was not dancing she was always lunching or dining with her
friends, or driving in the Bois. It is to be feared that she was a
little ashamed of her mother in the presence of her brilliant
friends. Honorine was now nearly fifty. Her life of toil had left
its mark on her. She was a little what is known as "provincial."
She wore the same kind of old-fashioned frocks that she used to
wear at the farm at Cambo. Her hands were hard and bony, like a
servant's. Her remarks were trite and commonplace. She was out of
place in that astounding environment. Yvonne seldom introduced her.
She would go down to the theatre and hang about the corridors,
waiting to see if her daughter wanted anything. And people would
say:</p>

<p>"Who is that old countrywoman?"</p>

<p>And the answer would be:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you know? That's the mother of Carmen Colignon."</p>

<p>But even then she was not altogether unhappy. Sometimes she
would take herself to task and think: "Why am I not unhappy? I give
my whole life to my daughter, and she does not respond."</p>

<p>And she would look down into the darkening streets, and see the
crowds rushing hither and thither on dubious errands. Lamps being
lighted, and somewhere in the distance a bell would be
tolling...And she would think:</p>

<p>"Even if she does not love me I can still serve her. I am her
mother."</p>

<p>And dreams would come to her.</p>

<p class="cpb">IX</p>

<p>Within a very short time her mind was diverted by material
considerations. At first the two hundred francs a month which
Monsieur Matz had agreed to pay Yvonne appeared a princely sum. But
when she became a star it seemed to dwindle into nothingness. A
star must have attendant satellites and luxuries. Yvonne was far
too dazzled by her facile success to worry over such details as
settling bills or considering ways and means. The more she earned
the more she spent. At the end of the first year Madame Marcillac
found herself faced with debts she could see no way to meet except
by drawing on her capital. She put the matter to Yvonne, who
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, that doesn't matter, mother. I shall soon be earning more,
and when my contract runs out they'll have to pay me thousands a
night."</p>

<p>When her contract ran out! But that was four years hence. At the
present pace Madame Marcillac's capital would be exhausted before
then. She pleaded with her daughter to be economical, to think of
the future. Yvonne did make some sort of attempt to curb her
extravagances&mdash;until the next temptation came along. Between
the mother and daughter there began to yawn unbridgable chasms of
reserve. Yvonne did not mean to be denied the attainment of these
new delights. She became furtive and mendacious.. She borrowed
money on the quiet, and made all kinds of excuses for breaking into
Madame Marcillac's dwindling capital.</p>

<p>So far she had had many admirers but no one who could truthfully
be called a lover. But a year after her leap to fame there appeared
upon the scene a young actor named Max Gion. He was not a
particularly good actor, neither was he very successful, and he had
no money. They became engaged.</p>

<p>Madame Marcillac thrilled with delight at her daughter's
engagement. The man was young and good-looking, and he had charming
manners. It was a love match. She had always dreaded that Yvonne
might marry some elderly man for his money.</p>

<p>Soon, however, she found that what the young couple had most in
common was a passion for extravagance. When not performing they
spent most of their time in cabs and restaurants. Rather than being
relieved, her financial commitments were doubled. The capital began
to dwindle. Yvonne was dancing superbly, and "Carmen Colignon" was
a star of the first magnitude. Her portraits were everywhere. She
was painted and sculpted by famous artists. The journals rang with
her praises. But Monsieur Matz was not inclined to deviate one
franc from the terms of his contract. He had discovered her and
made her. He had run the risk of her being a failure.</p>

<p>At the end of the second year of their acquaintance the young
couple married and took a little flat in the rue de la Baume. It
was plainly hinted that Max would rather not have his beloved
Yvonne's mother to live with them. And so she took one room in a
little street just off the avenue des Ternes. She lived alone, but
her identity was soon established. When she walked quietly
backwards and forwards people nudged each other and said:</p>

<p>"Do you know who that is? That's the mother of Carmen
Colignon."</p>

<p>And they argued amongst themselves as to why so beautiful and
famous a star should have such a queer old fish for a mother. And
some wondered why the daughter did not see that her mother was kept
in happier circumstances. And they shrugged their shoulders. These
theatrical people!...</p>

<p>As the years passed Honorine lived more within herself. Her love
for her daughter became a vital abstraction. She gave her all that
Yvonne might lead the life she desired. But they had nothing in
common. Honorine hovered like a moth on the outskirts of this
dazzling and dangerous effulgence wherein her daughter pirouetted
to the clamorous approbation of the mob.</p>

<p class="cpb">X</p>

<p>One day her daughter came to her in great distress. Max&mdash;of
the good looks and charming manners&mdash;was not all that he
appeared. He had put his name on the back of a bill. Within seven
days he had to find fifteen thousand francs. The alternative was a
law case, bankruptcy&mdash;possibly arrest.</p>

<p>The fifteen thousand francs was withdrawn from Madame
Marcillac's capital. The gay life continued. Before Yvonne's
contract had run out her mother was ruined. She had not a penny in
the world except what she earned. She went out secretly and
reverted to her old profession of housework and sewing. Yvonne
seldom asked her mother how she passed her time.</p>

<p>In the meantime Yvonne's life had not been without emotional
incident. As their debts increased and they saw no possibility of
relief from the mother, they quarrelled bitterly. There were
scenes, recrimination, almost ending in a <i>crime passionelle</i>.
Eventually Yvonne had no difficulty in divorcing her depraved young
husband, and immediately afterwards she married a rich elderly
merchant named Mocquard. Paris was intrigued. Her reputation became
more assured. When her contract expired she was re-engaged at an
enormous figure. She was rich beyond her wildest dreams.</p>

<p>It was at that point that the cleavage with her mother became
pronounced. Madame Marcillac would not take a penny of her
daughter's money. She gave no reason. It was not for her to
criticise. She went calmly about her affairs, her eyes filled with
wonder and awe. She went frequently to see her daughter, at an hour
when she knew no one would be about. On only one occasion did she
show signs of distress. That was on the occasion of her first visit
to the new house in the avenue Malakoff, when Yvonne, all aglow
with her new wealth and success, openly boasted about it, and
offered to make her mother a handsome allowance. And the tears had
started to Honorine's eyes, and pressing her hand to her heart, she
had exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear...my little one..."</p>

<p>But she could say no more, and she went quietly away, after
refusing the offer. She was set down then definitely as a crank.
She was pointed at in the street and laughed at.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such an old sketch? That's the mother of
Carmen Colignon."</p>

<p>Her figure became familiar on the boulevards, and once Sem did a
caricature of her which appeared in <i>Le Rire</i>, and which made
Yvonne very angry. Honorine shifted her quarters, and took a room
up in Montmartre in the rue Cortot.</p>

<p>Years passed. Her eyesight was not too good, and she had trouble
with her feet, and one day she bought a stout hickory stick for
support. She found work a little tiring, but people were kind to
her. She made many friends among people of her own class, who were
always anxious and willing to help her.</p>

<p>One December day as she was walking through the square of St.
Pierre there came to her a sudden flow of memories of her youth, of
her husband, and the days on the old farm at Cambo. Cambo! Hard
upon these memories came the reflection that the farm at Cambo
belonged to her daughter. It was to be hers when she became of age.
Strange that she should have forgotten this all these years. If
Yvonne did not object she would not mind accepting the gift. It was
associated with a period of calm happiness and purity. It was
earned by her own husband by honest toil. She flushed a little at
the temptation. Perhaps she would go back there to end her
days...</p>

<p>Yvonne had no objection. She laughed contemptuously at what she
called "the old piggery." Most certainly her mother should have it.
She herself was far too engrossed in big things to worry about such
a trifle.</p>

<p>And so one day she packed an old black bag and returned to
Biarritz. She was away five days. She went to see Monsieur
Pironneau. He was very evasive. He used terms she could not
understand. Yes, Monsieur and Madame Ombredanne were still living
there. They had a large family. He talked about entail, and
forfeiture, and surrenders. She could not tell whether the farm was
to be her property or not. The next day she went out to Cambo and
wandered around it. She had not the heart to call. It all looked
very much the same. She went back to Biarritz and again interviewed
the lawyer. It is impossible to know how long she would have been
kept there in this indeterminate condition, but her visit was cut
short. On the fifth day she picked up a newspaper in the little
<i>pension</i> where she was staying, and a headline caught her
eye. "Serious illness of Carmen Colignon."</p>

<p>She caught the night train back to Paris, and drove to her
daughter's house in the avenue Malakoff. A servant admitted her.
The house was all in a fluster. Yes, Carmen Colignon was very ill.
The doctor believed it was smallpox, caught at the theatre from one
of the stage hands. Monsieur Mocquard was staying elsewhere. He had
been advised to, as the disease was very catching. She forced her
way upstairs. A dark-featured nurse met her on the landing, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You cannot go upstairs. The upper floor is isolated. Madame
Mocquard is seriously ill."</p>

<p>"I am going up."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am her mother."</p>

<p>She pushed back a curtain reeking with disinfectant, and went up
to her daughter's bedroom. Yvonne was semi-conscious. For six days
and nights she never went further from her daughter's bedside than
the adjoining room. She ate hardly anything and slept less. The two
nurses, after the first irruption of her entry, took kindly to her.
She was useful, and after all she was the patient's mother. She had
penetrated into the sick chamber, and if she was to catch the
disease she would catch it, whether she stayed or went. On the
sixth night she fainted from sheer exhaustion. One of the nurses
gave her a powerful sleeping draught. She slept for eleven hours.
She came to in a dreamy semi-comatose condition. She thought she
was back at the farm at Cambo. Little Yvonne was packing her sachel
preparatory for school. She was sing-ing in her childish tremulo a
song called "<i>Les fleurs qui passent.</i>"</p>

<p>The nurse entered and stood by her bedside. After a short pause
she said: "Madame Marcillac, I'm sorry to say your daughter passed
away in the night."</p>

<p>Madame Marcillac turned on her side, but she did not speak. She
wanted to hear little Yvonne finish the song, "<i>Les fleurs qui
passent</i>."</p>

<p>After a time she wept a little and rose from her bed. She put on
her cloak and went into her daughter's bedroom. When she beheld her
she made the sign of the cross, and knelt by the bedside. And there
she remained in prayer for a long while...</p>

<p class="cpb">XI</p>

<p>All Paris flocked to the funeral of Carmen Colignon. Senators,
merchant princes, artists, students, and actors drove out to Pere
La Chaise. There were carriages by the score, and magnificent
wreaths from Monsieur Mocquard, Monsieur Matz, and other fights of
the theatrical profession. The newspapers outvied each other in
eulogistic competition. It was an event.</p>

<p>Honorine walked to the funeral.</p>

<p>In the distinguished company hardly anyone noticed the old
countrywoman who hobbled into the cemetery, leaning on a hickory
stick. She stood on the outskirts of the crowd, and when the
ceremony was over she wandered away alone in the direction of the
Seine. Alone!...She had no definite plans formed in her mind. She
was stunned by the abruptness of the catastrophe, broken by the
completeness of it. She found herself wandering by the north bank
of the river, looking across at the pile of buildings on the He de
la Cite, dominated by Notre Dame. The water looked grey and
inviting...sleep-giving. Oh, how she needed sleep! It was Christmas
time. People were hurrying hither and thither with parcels and
flowers. No, it was not true that all Paris was at the funeral of
Carmen Colignon. "All Paris" is a phrase. Many had hardly heard of
her. Most were indifferent. Even those who wept and sent expensive
wreaths, how long would it be before they, too, forgot?...</p>

<p>Only love is permanent; only a mother's love perhaps...She
looked up at the cupola of <i>Notre Dame</i>, and her eye alighted
on the cross. <i>Notre Dame</i>! Oh, Mother of God! She seemed to
sense in that instant the whole significance of her own fife, and
yet she remained dumb...inarticulate. She could express nothing.
She had given something which finked her to a spirit greater than
her own. She looked up humbly, her eyes filled with wonder and
reverence. Barges glided by, and the people hurrying in their
thousands, people who had hardly heard of Carmen Colignon. She was
conscious of her heart filled with pity and compassion...of a great
immensity, of something vast wherein nestle the loves, passions,
fears, and frailties of every living thing. And turning her back on
the river, she walked slowly away...</p>

<p class="cpb">XII</p>

<p>Tap-tap! Tap-tap! Along the Rue Cadec she comes this Sunday
morning, smiling to herself as though with childish memories. And
the men touch their hats and the women cry: "Good-morning, maman.
May God preserve you!"</p>

<p>She hobbles on, her old bony fingers clutching the handle of the
string bag. She passes by, leaving a trail of unexplained
delight.</p>

<p>Tap-tap! Tap-tap!</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know? That's the mother of Carmen Colignon."</p>

<p>"And who in God's name is Carmen Colignon?"</p>

<p>Just by old Grognon's shop she pauses, and her face is
silhouetted against the dark opening. It is lined and scored by a
hundred tiny cracks and wrinkles, but the beauty remains. And one
regards it as, after many years, a reader might regard a leaf that
had been pressed between the leaves of some old volume and long
forgotten; and the reader gazes enchanted, held by the vision of
this magic network of myriad perfections.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>13. The Room</h2>

<p>The Room was in Praxton Street, which is not very far from the
Euston Road. It was fifteen feet by ten feet six inches. It had a
door and a window. The window was covered by stiff lace curtains
with several tears in them, framed by red plush curtains, which, if
pulled together, failed to meet by nearly a yard. The furniture
consisted of a circular mahogany table, a Victorian sideboard with
mirrors inset in the panels above, a narrow-seated horse-hair chair
which had a tendency to shoot the occupant into the fireplace, two
other mahogany chairs with green velvet seats, a white enamelled
flower-stand supporting a puce-coloured earthenware pot in which a
dismal aspidistra struggled for existence. In the angle between the
door and the window was an iron frame supporting what proved to be
a bed by night and a dumping ground for odds and ends by day. The
wall was papered with a strange pattern of violet and pink flowers
leaping in irregular waves ceiling-wards. On the walls were many
framed oleographs, one of the Crucifixion, one of a small boy
holding a piece of sultana cake on a plate, and a large collie dog
regarding the cake with melancholy greed. There was a photograph of
somebody's husband with a square beard and a white stock, two
water-colours of some foreign country characterized by blue
mountains reflected in a lake, and a large print of the coronation
of King George. On the floor was a yellow and red carpet of
indeterminate pattern worn right through in all the most frequented
spots of the room. Around the gas chandelier a dozen or so flies
played their eternal game of touch.</p>

<p>Now this is a brief description of inanimate
objects&mdash;except for the flies. But we all know that even
inanimate objects&mdash;particularly a collection of inanimate
objects&mdash;have a soul. That is to say that they subtly affect
everyone on the spiritual plane. Perhaps it would be safer to say
that they have a message.</p>

<p>To James Wilbraham Waite, seated on the horsehair chair on a
bright July afternoon, they brought an abrupt message. He looked
around the room and he said to himself out aloud:</p>

<p>"This is simply hell!"</p>

<p>He had occupied this room in the lodging-house for seven years,
and it had taken all this time to breed in him the special kind of
intense loathing and hate which he felt at that moment. It was not
the quick hate of sudden anger. It was the slow combustible passion
of years of disappointment and dissatisfaction. The room seemed to
embody in itself all that he detested and yearned to avoid.</p>

<p>His father had been a small Essex farmer, and James Wilbraham
had spent his boyhood on the farm. Owing, however, to Mr. Waite
senior's Iack of concentration on the commercial side of the farm,
and his too great concentration on the good stuff served over the
bar of the "Dog and Destiny," he 'vent bankrupt and died soon
after. His wife had died many years before and James Wilbraham,
being an only son, found himself at the age of eighteen alone in
the world without even a mangel-wurzel to his name. He was a dreamy
boy, loving an open-air life. He had done fairly well at the
Grammar School. He had no head for mathematics, but excelled at
theoretical subjects, which brought him no credit or marks. When
his father died there was apparently nothing for him to do but
become a farm hand. One of the masters at the school, who had taken
an interest in him, did his best to dissuade him from this course.
His name was Mr. Flint, and he pointed out the hopeless future of
manual labour without capital. He emphasized the fact that James
had had quite a good education and that he was intelligent, and
that he had only to use his brains to make his way in the world.
For two years James fought against the good advice of his friend.
He worked for a local farmer, and he might be working for the same
farmer now but for the fact that he fell in love with a girl he had
seen walking about the streets of Pondersham. He never spoke to
her, but she stirred some profound note in his nature. It was less
the girl herself, perhaps, than the idea of Iove in the abstract.
She was what was known as a lady, inaccessible, remote, fragile as
a china vase. He began to regard his rough hands and coarse clothes
with misgiving. And then one day he went to the pictures with an
acquaintance and found himself suddenly projected into a world of
magnificent Life, spelt with a very large L, where gorgeous women
flashed in and out of priceless automobiles, and powdered flunkeys
ushered them into marvellous palaces. The contrast was too violent.
If ever he wanted to possess one of these splendid
creatures&mdash;well, he could never do so as a farm hand.</p>

<p>His ideas of farming had never been academic, to put it mildly.
He had inherited a great deal of his father's vagueness. During his
father's lifetime he had regarded the soil as a mysterious
substitute for a mother. It succoured him with the good things he
liked, and made few calls on his industry. He liked to ride over
it, and see the little green shoots budding. Then he would dream by
a pond, or idle the hours away with a dog and a ferret.</p>

<p>Consequently when he informed his employer one day, with a sigh,
that he had decided to give up farming, that gentleman accepted his
resignation 'v ith unblushing satisfaction. Through the influence
of Mr. Flint he got a situation as a clerk in a corn chandler's at
Pondersham. He earned seventeen and sixpence a week, and managed to
keep himself&mdash;in a state of chronic hunger.</p>

<p>He endured this life for over a year, when again through the
influence of Mr. Flint he considerably improved his position. For
he obtained a situation at a scholastic employment agency in London
at a salary of thirty shillings a week. It was then that he made
his first introduction to the Room. He paid twelve shillings and
sixpence a week for it, and that included a breakfast, consisting
of tea and a boiled egg. To record his career during the seven
years that led up to this particular July afternoon would be
tedious in the extreme. It seemed to centre entirely around the
Room. By half-crowns and five shillings his salary had now risen to
three pounds five shillings. During the next seven years by similar
processes it might conceivably rise to five pounds. He would then
be thirty-five. But it was not these material considerations and
prospects alone which disturbed him. It was that eternal sense of
ingrained discontent.</p>

<p>He detested his work. At his desk he was always dreaming. He
dreamt of far-off countries, and beauty, and love, and romance. He
joined a local library and spent most of his evenings alone
reading. And when he had been completely transported into another
world he would look up and find himself in the Room. He would catch
his own reflection in the crazy mirrors, the boy and sultana cake
and the collie dog would appear to be grinning at him insipidly
from the wall, the vision of King George in his coronation robes
only produced in him a sense of acrid disloyalty. The wallpaper
leaping towards the ceiling made him want to scream. Even when he
turned out the gas and went to bed he was intensely conscious of
enveloping ugliness.</p>

<p>On this particular afternoon his venom focussed on the flies
around the chandelier. He had come home early&mdash;it was a slack
time at the office&mdash;and he was reading a novel with a setting
in the desert. He became absorbed with visions. He saw the sleepy
pile of grey and white buildings against the vivid green of
date-palms in an oasis. He could hear the distant sounds of strange
music, and breathe the rich perfumes of the African night. Then
suddenly he looked up and saw those London flies playing their
ridiculous game beneath the chandelier. He felt maddened. He put
down the book and made a swipe at them with his handkerchief. They
dispersed only to re-form a few seconds later. He hit at them again
and again without any tangible result. Then he sat down and
thought.</p>

<p>"I want a holiday," he said to himself. "My nerves are in a
rotten state." Owing to the exigencies of office work he had had
his fortnight's holiday in April. He would not get another
until&mdash;some time next year. And then he would probably go to
Hastings, or Bognor, or worse. It was awful, unendurable.</p>

<p>"I won't have you here," he suddenly said to the flies. There
was a look of grim determination on his face. He picked up a towel
and slightly damped it, and began a fresh campaign. He soon
realized that to hit them in the air was a chance in a hundred. You
have to wait till they settle. He tracked them about the room. He
killed several on the table, quite a lot on the wall and the
window, but nothing seemed to make any difference to the party
under the chandelier. He made wild swipes at them and actually hit
several on the wing, but back they came. This persistence was
either astonishing pluck or astonishing stupidity. It was almost
uncanny. He struck wildly at one on the chandelier itself, and
then&mdash;crash! down came the globe and smashed on the floor. A
few minutes later he heard the ponderous steps of his rheumaticky
landlady coming up the stairs. He gripped the towel hard. He felt
uncertain of himself. "If the old fool makes a fuss about that
globe I'll give her a swipe," his mind registered. There was the
familiar tap on the door and it opened.</p>

<p>To his surprise she held out a letter. She had not apparently
heard the globe smash, neither did she notice it.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bean's just left this," she said. "It came this morning,
but it was addressed to seventy-five."</p>

<p>He took the letter, and said "Thanks;" then, feeling that his
passions were somewhat vented, he pointed to the globe and said
casually:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I broke the globe, hitting at a fly."</p>

<p>She said: "Oh, dear! H'm! I'll go and get a dustpan and brush.
My legs are that bad."</p>

<p>"I'll get it for you if you like," he answered, feeling suddenly
quite amiable.</p>

<p>"I wish you would, Mr. Waite; it's under the kitchen
dresser."</p>

<p>The business of getting the dustpan and brush, clearing up the
broken glass, and listening to a story about the shocking pain Mr.
Bean was suffering with his kidney trouble occupied ten minutes.
She went at last and he opened the letter. It was from a firm of
lawyers in Liverpool informing him that an uncle of his had
recently died in Canada, and under the terms of the will he was the
inheritor of approximately six hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Six hundred pounds! For the first time he stared at the Room
with unseeing eyes. It had no horrors for him. He saw right through
the mahogany sideboard and the leaping wallpaper out into the great
broad spaces of the world. Gulls screamed above the heaving decks
of a mighty ship. He saw white cities with minarets and mosques
glittering in the sun. There were valleys aglow with myriad
flowers. A woman was coming towards him&mdash;</p>

<p>The desire to talk to someone about his amazing news was
irresistible. He knew no one in the house except the landlady. He
went downstairs and found her ironing some flannel underclothing in
the kitchen. He said:</p>

<p>"I say, Mrs. Beldam, I've come in for some money." The landlady
looked up at him with an expression of greedy interest. She
said:</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nice, I must say. How much is it?"</p>

<p>"About six hundred pounds."</p>

<p>She looked down at her flannel petticoat. She was cautiously
balancing the potentialities of the situation. She couldn't exactly
see how she was to come in over this. All it would amount to would
be that she would probably lose a lodger. She repeated:</p>

<p>"That's nice." Then, after blowing on her iron, she added:</p>

<p>"You take my advice, young man, and put it all in War Savings
Certificates."</p>

<p>"War Savings Certificates!"</p>

<p>He looked at her with horror. Ah! he could see through it all.
This social conspiracy to keep him in the Room. Here was the golden
key to freedom, and this woman, this state, social life itself,
talked to him about War Savings Certificates. Not likely! He barked
at her:</p>

<p>"We shall see," and almost ran out of the room.</p>

<p>It was nearly a month before he got his cheque. In the meantime
he had been carefully maturing his plans. He bought maps, and
guides, and works of reference. He gave the scholastic agency a
week's notice, and when he was free he devoted his time to reading
and polishing up his French, at which he had been fairly proficient
at school.</p>

<p>The Room, if anything, seemed more hideous than before. He felt
himself already superior to it; nevertheless, he was still a little
frightened. It had for so long dominated him, with its drab menace,
he could not believe that he would ever really escape from its
clutches. He dreamed of some feral vengeance. Perhaps on the last
night he would get busy with an axe or a poker. But no, this would
be very foolish. He would be made to pay, and so the Room would
score off him.</p>

<p>And so one day in early September he gave up the key of the Room
to the landlady and left it for ever.</p>

<p>He had about fifty pounds in cash on him. With the rest of the
money he had bought a World-wide Letter of Credit. What destiny had
in store for him when the money was spent he neither knew nor
cared. He was achieving his supreme ambition&mdash;to escape.</p>

<p>Four days later he arrived at Algiers, tired, bewildered, but
very excited. He regarded Algiers as a good kicking-off place for
his adventures. He wanted to get to the desert, but, knowing
nothing of the country, he didn't know how to proceed. He stayed
there for a week in a quiet hotel, wandering about, and getting
lost in the maze of the Arab quarter. The city repelled him a
little with its large hotels and terraces of French villas. Even
the Arab quarter had a sense of unreality. He felt every moment
that he might step out and find himself in the Earl's Court Road.
One day at lunch he got into conversation with a Frenchman, who
told him about a journey he was about to take to Laghouat in the
south. James Wilbraham pricked up his ears. The Frenchman, it
appeared, was a traveller in rugs and bric-à-brac. He was making
the journey with a companion, and they were going by car. Yes,
there were only the three of them, including the chauffeur, and if
James cared to join them and pay his share&mdash;the contract was
concluded then and there.</p>

<p>Three days later the party left. They motored the whole of the
first day through the richly fertile country of Northern Algeria,
and spent the night at Boghari up in the hills. The two Frenchmen
talked the whole time, and James gathered about one-third of their
conversation, which was mostly about women, the rate of exchange,
French politics, and trade. At Boghari it was very cold and
overcast.</p>

<p>The seeker after romance began to feel depressed that night. It
was all very beautiful, of course, but somehow things were not for
the moment shaping in the way he had hoped. A motor-car was an
unromantic way of travelling, and French commercial travellers can
be very boring. He felt a tripper, an alien. He wondered whether he
would ever fit into any <i>milieu</i> in which he found himself. In
the early morning he dreamt he was back in the Room, and the
chairs, and tables, and lace curtains were laughing at him.</p>

<p>The next day, however, the car wound its way down into the plain
below, and they began to approach the desert. By midday it was very
hot. They lunched at Djerfa on fish soup, bustard stewed in oil,
and Algerian wine. The food nauseated James, but the Frenchmen
became more and more garrulous. He wanted to get on to where
romance would begin. At last they started, and all the afternoon
the car raced on down a straight road through endless tracks of
sand dotted with scrub, clumps of coarse grass, and occasionally
pistacia-trees. It was nearly sundown before they reached the oasis
of Laghouat. They drove up to the little hotel just outside the
wall of the town.</p>

<p>Having washed and changed his clothes, James felt a great desire
to escape from the two Frenchmen. He put on his hat and hurried
out. Immediately outside the hotel he was surrounded by swarms of
Arab boys jabbering in French. He tried to shoo them off, but four
of them followed him everywhere he went. He learnt afterwards to
become accustomed to this attention, but at the moment it annoyed
him. He wanted to be alone. He crossed the road and climbed up a
rocky eminence, followed by his retinue. Clambering over the last
boulder he gave a gasp of astonishment. Laghouat is two thousand
feet above sea level, and from it the desert slopes gradually down.
At first glance it gave him the impression of the sea, an endless
quivering ocean glistening in the sun. In the foreground were
thousands of stately date-palms, while on his right the little
town, dominated by its minaret, was a pleasant jumble of
salmon-pink, grey, white, and brown. For the first time since he
left the Room he thrilled with a sense of satiety. He sat there for
a long while dreaming. The boys chattered to him and among
themselves, but he was hardly conscious of them. The sun tipped the
horizon, and suddenly he heard a gun fired, a flag fluttered from
the top of the minaret, and a diminutive figure in black appeared.
Against the clear blue sky, graduated to pale orange on the
horizon, the minaret stood out like a pillar of gold. A rich
bell-like voice rang out and seemed to reach the furthermost places
in the desert. It was the muezzin calling the faithful to
prayer.</p>

<p>James Wilbraham gave a sigh of content.</p>

<p>"I have found it," he thought to himself.</p>

<p>That night he slept badly. He was troubled by the problem of how
to keep what he had found. How could he fit into this atmosphere?
How could he live? He was at present a foreign guest staying at the
only hotel. The town was entirely Arab, its activities almost
entirely devoted to the breeding of sheep and cattle. For days he
wandered about, listening for signs and portents. The French
travellers returned to Algiers. A few other trippers came and went.
A week went by. And then one day he met his fate in the person of
Giles Duxberry. He was seated on the verandah of the hotel one
evening when a tall, angular figure, in a white burnous, came
slouching up the path. He seemed to know his way about the hotel,
for he made straight for the bell, rang it, and ordered an
anisette. Then he retired, washed himself, came back and sat at a
table next to James. He poured water into the colourless liquid,
drank it in two gulps, and ordered another. When he had consumed
four of these insidious drinks, he suddenly said:</p>

<p>"English, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said James, with surprise.</p>

<p>"Have a drink?"</p>

<p>It would have been inhuman to refuse, and James also had an
anisette. He had never drunk it before, and his single one had a
much more potent effect on him than the four did on his chance
acquaintance. He tried to be conversational, but it was very
difficult. Mr. Duxberry's skin was almost the colour of an Arab's,
but his eyes were tired, his manners lethargic. He was like a man
utterly bored with every human experience&mdash;except perhaps
drink. He barked in monosyllables, and explained things in little
disconnected sentences.</p>

<p>He was, it appeared, employed by a Lancashire firm in the halfa
business. It seemed that some genius had discovered that the long,
coarse halfa-grass, which grew in the desert, was excellent
material for making paper. It was garnered by the natives, and
deposited in bundles in various depôts about the country. Giles
Duxberry was in charge of a depôt in a tiny oasis fifteen miles
away. He lived there by himself, and the only thing he could find
in the job's favour was that once a week he could come into
Laghouat and get drunk. He proceeded to get drunk on this occasion,
and before the evening was far advanced he was quite
incoherent.</p>

<p>Before he had reached this stage, however, he had asked James to
come out and see him, and explained where it was. The only way of
getting there was on horseback. James felt grateful for his early
years spent on a farm. He could ride. The expedition, moreover,
carried with it an element of adventure. Perhaps he, too, could get
a similar situation.</p>

<p>It took him three days to obtain the loan of a horse, which he
eventually did through the intermediary of four people. He felt
singularly like a paladin setting out on some holy quest as he left
the town behind and cantered across the desert. He had no
difficulty in finding his destination. It was a small oasis with
the inevitable date-palms, barley, and castor-oil plants, a low,
rambling, lime-washed building made of mud and cement, and some
half-dozen nomad tents pitched in the sand. He found Duxberry just
sitting down to lunch. Without any particular show of warmth the
latter said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, you've come then!"</p>

<p>He shouted something in Arabic into the room beyond. The room
was plainly but comfortably furnished, and very clean. They had
lunch, and were waited on by an incredibly ugly old Ouled Nail
woman, with the tattoo mark on her forehead and henna stains on her
finger-tips. The food was excellently cooked. James talked and
asked questions, and received monosyllabic grunts in reply.
Afterwards they sat outside in the sun and smoked. During the
afternoon Arabs kept on arriving with donkeys laden with bundles of
halfa-grass. Duxberry checked their operations with idle
indifference. There was an amazing sense of peace and space. In an
idle moment James thought of the awful Room. What a contrast! He
felt envious of this hard-bitten, sunburnt manager. Before he left
he put out a feeler. He asked his host whether he knew if there
were any more jobs like that going.</p>

<p>Duxberry stared at him.</p>

<p>"What for?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Me."</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>He seemed unable to understand.</p>

<p>"But you've got your fare back to England, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'd rather live here."</p>

<p>"Rather live out in this God-forsaken place than in
England!"</p>

<p>"Much."</p>

<p>"What is there to it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It's just the sense of&mdash;oh, freedom and
space, and sun and air."</p>

<p>The older man regarded him gravely.</p>

<p>"Listen, son," he said; "when you've had as much of it as I have
you'll cut all that stuff out. I ran away from home when I was a
boy and worked my passage to South Africa. For thirty years I've
beach-combed all over the earth. I've only one ambition."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"To get back home."</p>

<p>"Good God!"</p>

<p>They looked at each other uncomprehendingly, like men who have
reached a mental impasse.</p>

<p>James Wilbraham left soon after and returned to Laghouat. For
days he wandered around the desert or sat in the hotel, pondering
over the problem of his own life. Certain realizations became clear
to him. He was unhappy. He wanted to stay out there. Giles Duxberry
was unhappy. He wanted to go back to England. Well, surely the
situation could be adjusted. Let Giles go back to the Room, and see
how he liked it. Let James take his place.</p>

<p>A few days later Giles arrived for his weekly "drunk." James
waited until he had had his fifth anisette, then he said:</p>

<p>"I say, Duxberry, I'd like to make a proposition to you."</p>

<p>"Carry on, son."</p>

<p>"Could you manage to wangle it so that I could take on your job?
If you could I would be pleased to give you a hundred pounds to pay
your fare back to England."</p>

<p>The beachcomber's eyes distended. He took a deep draught of the
milk-coloured liquid.</p>

<p>"A hundred pounds!" he exclaimed. His eyes said: "Well, of all
the blanketty, blanketty&mdash;idiots!"</p>

<p>They discussed ways and means. Two days later James again rode
out to see his friend. Yes, it was decided that it might be
wangled. Correspondence passed, resulting in James having to make a
trip to Algiers to interview a gentlernan who was born in
Blackburn. The arrangement was satisfactorily made. He returned to
Laghouat full of the joy of life. He spent a week with Giles
Duxberry, learing the small technicalities of his undertaking. He
began to pick up Arabic words and expressions. And then one day he
handed over a hundred good English pounds, and Duxberry counted the
notes carefully, pouched them, and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Good luck to you!" he said.</p>

<p>James felt strangely moved. He could hardly speak. It was not
that he had developed any particular affection for his new friend,
but that he felt him to be a poignant figure in his destiny. He
said:</p>

<p>"Good luck to <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>Nothing more was said. Duxberry mounted his horse, waved a
perfunctory farewell, and rode away. James stood there bare-headed,
breathing in the warm air, and absorbing the marvellous sense of
repose of the desert.</p>

<hr>

<p>And so one day Giles Duxberry found himself seated in a
horse-hair chair that had a tendency to shoot the occupant into the
fireplace. He had removed his boots, and was gazing into the fire.
Then he looked round and regarded the Room. There was a lovely
curly sideboard with mirrors, which reflected the vision of his
sunburnt face, a white stand with a pot and a plant, a circular
table, two other chairs, a bed. On the wall a pretty pattern and
some enchanting pictures&mdash;a sacred subject, a boy and a collie
dog and a piece of cake, some clever water-colour paintings, King
George in his magnificent coronation robes. Civilization!</p>

<p>It was a dream come true&mdash;a dream of thirty years. He
sighed with happy contentment. He had eighty pounds in cash on him.
He had only to stroll out and there were a dozen saloons within a
mile, where he could order any drink he liked. There were cinemas
and music-halls. There was life passing all the time, strange and
amazing things that might happen any moment. He might get a good
job, make money, marry some beautiful woman. He gazed fascinated by
the Room and murmured:</p>

<p>"Gosh! this is heaven!"</p>

<p>As a man accustomed to live in lonely places he had acquired a
habit of talking to himself. He addressed the fire:</p>

<p>"Jeminy! What a fool! what a lunatic! That guy will soon get fed
up with it. He'll come bundling back. Anyway, he's not going to
take my Room from me. It was a square deal."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>14. Funeral March</h2>

<p>She was a woman with a genius for apparent helplessness. She
drifted around the verandah of the Hotel Reina Christa like an
autumn leaf, and like an autumn leaf she was for ever changing her
hue. She was always wearing different-coloured cloaks and shawls,
which other people had to fetch for her. Not only men, but women.
She was so helpless, you see. To me she was like a white flower,
which one is only conscious of at night. One associated her with
the night&mdash;the dead white face with the little flick of
carmine on the lips, the blue-black hair, and those large, dark
appealing eyes. She was always appealing, appealing for sympathy
and understanding&mdash;and anything else. She seemed to give out
nothing of herself. She was nebulous. But in my whole life? have
never met anyone such a complete mistress of the verb
<i>schwärmen</i>. It is a pity there is no real translation for
this word, for she embodied it in her every phrase and movement.
The women, who were for the most part middle-aged English and
American women, staying there for health or pleasure, entirely
succumbed to her. They found her most fascinating. She certainly
could be amusing at times, and she had travelled a lot, and seen
sides of life that appeared entirely romantic and remote to most of
them. Moreover, she was Russian, which means so much when you are
susceptible to mystic influences.</p>

<p>The men, I noticed, were a little afraid of her, but as they
were men whose activities centred principally around golf and
bridge it is not surprising. They did not like being asked about
their souls, and when their physical beauty was praised openly
before a crowd of people they felt self-conscious. But some of them
seemed to like to sit and talk with her&mdash;alone. There was one
young sub&mdash;just out of the shell, with some of the yolk still
on his hair&mdash;who became apparently wildly infatuated. He
devoted not only his evenings, but many of the precious hours when
he might have been playing golf to her. The frenzy lasted for ten
days, and suddenly the pale youth disappeared. Poor Madame
Vieninoff wandered the grounds disconsolately.</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor dear Geoffrey," she said to everyone. "What has
happened to him? He was so sweet!&mdash;so sweet!"</p>

<p>She was discovered the same evening probing under the lilies on
the pond beyond the pergola with a walking-stick. I think it was a
disappointment to her not to discover that pale face floating
amongst them. She was <i>so</i> helpless.</p>

<p>It must have been an even greater disappointment when it
transpired that the young man had just remembered that he 'vas down
to play in a golf tournament in a town fifteen miles away, and he
had not had time to let her know. She soon, however, recovered from
this. To that frumpy old Mrs. Wyatt she would exclaim: "Oh, my
darling, how <i>beautiful</i> you look to-night! You must always
wear cerise and black. What exquisite pearls! They are like your
eyes, floating in the ether."</p>

<p>To little Mrs. Champneys she would say:</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, come and talk to me. I am <i>so</i> lonely. You
are <i>so sympathique</i>."</p>

<p>And she would tell Mrs. Champneys all about her dear beloved
husband, who she said had been a great musician, and had died many
years ago. She would sap this poor little woman's nervous vitality
with her moving stories of love, and death, and passion, with her
tales of suffering, interlarded with little flicks of cynical
humour. She could blow hot and cold too. She was heard one evening
screaming at her maid in French, on account of some trivial
ill-adjustment of her frock. She sulked for an afternoon because a
pretty woman named Viola Winch had occupied the whole of old
Colonel Gouchard's time during <i>déjeuner</i>.</p>

<p>But for the most part she had it all her own way. There was
little opposition. She was never so happy as when surrounded by
some dozen of the hotel habitués listening to her stories, or
absorbing her charm.</p>

<p>It was during one of these occasions that I noticed strange
little occurrence. The evening train used to come in while the
guests were at dinner, consequently the new arrivals usually dined
alone, and either did or did not join the others afterwards.</p>

<p>I was seated in a chair on the verandah facing the dining-room
obliquely. Madame Vieninoff was the centre of an admiring group as
usual. I had never heard her so entertaining. The French door to
the dining-room was open, and I observed an elderly
distinguished-looking man with white hair and a pointed
beard&mdash;one of the late-comers&mdash;dining alone. He was
obviously tired from a long journey and in need of his dinner,
which he enjoyed with the quiet satisfaction of a gourmet. He was
nearing the end, and had raised a glass of wine to his lips, when?
suddenly observed him stop, as though listening. He put the glass
down, and frowned perplexedly, as though trying to associate what
he was listening to with some past experience.</p>

<p>Then he finished his wine and pondered. After a few more minutes
he stood up and came to the open door, where I was sitting, and
looked out on to the verandah at the group of people. I saw his eye
alight on Madame Vieninoff, and a curious cynical smile twisted his
lips. He returned to finish his dinner. I could not see in the dim
light whether she had observed him, but I noticed as he went back
she was laughing rather hysterically at some reminiscence that she
had herself been recounting. Then she became curiously subdued.</p>

<p>When the elderly gentleman came out to partake of his coffee and
cognac, Madame Vieninoff had retired. She said the night was
oppressive, and was affecting her nerves. I thought to myself: "Ho,
ho!" which is another way of saying that we all love a mystery.</p>

<p>I made a point of engaging the newcomer in conversation,
although, of course, it was impossible at the moment to talk about
Madame Vieninoff. We talked about hotels, and the country, and
sport, and other safe subjects which hotel guests interminably
discuss. He was a quiet, cultivated Frenchman, prepared to be
friendly, but not too communicative&mdash;not a man to be rushed or
cross-examined. We retired early.</p>

<p>The next two days wrought an extraordinary change in Madame
Vieninoff. There was no disguising it. She still drifted about the
verandah, but it was in a furtive uncertain manner. She appeared
petulant and no one could get a smile out of her. She was
obviously, moreover, in dread of finding herself in the presence of
this new arrival. She kept her room for hours, and sent her maid
for time-tables, or to make enquiries at the bureau about the
departure of trains to here, there, and everywhere, which was
surprising, as she had told everyone that she meant to winter at
the Reina Christa. The poor woman was in great distress, and it
became apparent to my friend, whose name I discovered to be Louis
Denoyel. Everyone observed that Madame Vieninoff was not herself,
but I doubt whether anyone else, except myself, associated her
agitation with the arrival of Monsieur Denoyel. On the third
afternoon she carne on to the verandah, where I was drinking coffee
with Denoyel. She glanced at us and darted away.</p>

<p>Denoyel frowned, and the cynical smile left his face. He stroked
his beard, shrugged his shoulders, and muttered:</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's too bad! After all, she's a woman!"</p>

<p>He looked up at me quizzically, and I said:</p>

<p>"All of which I find intriguing."</p>

<p>He thought for a long while. Then he took out a visiting-card,
wrote something on it, and rang the bell for the waiter. When the
waiter came he said:</p>

<p>"Bring me an envelope, please, and I would like you to take this
message to Madame Vieninoff."</p>

<p>The waiter was away for nearly five minutes, and I sat there
anxiously hoping that my friend would show me what was written on
the card. He was amused at my curiosity, and in a sudden whim he
handed it across to me without a word. On it was written in
French:</p>

<p class="letter">"Do not be alarmed. I am leaving to-morrow
morning.&mdash;L. D."</p>

<p>When the waiter had taken the message, I said:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you cannot leave it at that."</p>

<p>He lightly beat a tattoo on the table with his left hand, and
then he said:</p>

<p>"No, I suppose, having gone so far, I must tell you the whole
thing. But wait till this evening, and we will go out for a stroll
along the bay."</p>

<p>The night was warm and fine, and seated on the carcass of a
fallen pine tree at the edge of the dunes, just above the bay,
Monsieur Denoyel told me this story:</p>

<p><br>
"It's a strange story," he said, "because it is a series of
contradictions. But all true stories manage somehow or other to
contradict themselves; life is like that, I suppose.</p>

<p>"In the days when the ill-fated Romanoffs flourished and
Imperial Russia was a force to be reckoned with, Serge Vieninoff
was a musician of some repute in Petersburg. He was inclined to be
lazy and had accomplished nothing very distinguished, but people
were beginning to talk of his future. He had a considerable private
fortune, and kept up a certain amount of style in the most
fashionable quarter of the city. He was popular, amiable, and
cultured. And then one day he met and fell in love with Wanda
Karrienski. She was the daughter of a small innkeeper, and was at
that time serving as a manicurist in one of the big stores. That is
our friend across the way."</p>

<p>And Monsieur Denoyel nodded in the direction of the Reina
Christa, whose lights were reflected upon the still surface of the
bay.</p>

<p>"She was of the clinging, helpless, passionate kind, exuding an
atmosphere of ingenuousness; but, as you yourself may easily
divine, not quite so ingenuous, indeed, not quite so helpless as
she appears. She made every kind of apparent protest against
marrying the aristocratic Serge. She was of a different class,
unworthy, too unsophisticated, and all that kind of thing. Oh, she
did the thing well. It was just the kind of attitude which
infatuated the musician. He would have none of it, and he married
her.</p>

<p>"Now you can imagine, coming from the hard conditions in which
she had been brought up, and the struggle and indignity of her
calling&mdash;for you must realize that a female manicurist in
Petersburg in those days did not hold the same kind of position as
a manicurist holds in London or New York. Her work was mostly
connected with young officers. Suddenly finding herself the
mistress of a large and fashionable household, and the legitimate
wife of a distinguished and wealthy man&mdash;well, what could you
expect?</p>

<p>"It was the kind of thing she had dreamed of, and read about in
cheap novels, but never considered realizable. And suddenly the
dream came true. She adapted herself to these conditions like a
duck to water. As you may observe, she is still by no means
unlovely, and in those days she was an extremely pretty woman.
Moreover, she had a certain native wit, and that most invaluable
asset to any woman&mdash;the genius of knowing exactly how to
dress. In spite of her lowly birth, Vieninoff's friends quickly
absorbed her. She became popular and sought after. Her life became
one round of dissipation, balls, theatres, dinners, sleigh rides,
receptions, and all the gay things which a woman of her nature
craves for. Vieninoff couldn't live up to it. He was a dreamer,
absorbed in his work; and for the most part he let her go her own
way, although devoted to her.</p>

<p>"There were two years of this, and then suddenly&mdash;biff!
War, revolution, fall of the monarchy, counterrevolution, defeat,
ruin! The whole edifice fell to the ground, and among the débris
wandered the disconsolate figures of Vieninoff and his wife. He was
ruined. The house and furniture were seized by the Bolshevik
government, his property was confiscated. Scraping together
whatever they could out of the shambles, they managed eventually to
reach Paris with a few thousand francs between them and actual
starvation.</p>

<p>"They rented two rooms in a meagre little street just off the
Rue des Ecoles. It was a wretched place, insufferably hot in the
summer, perishingly cold in the winter. But Mr. Vieninoff was a man
of spirit. He got together the few treasures they had saved out of
the wreck, and spent a portion of his small capital in hiring an
upright piano. 'I will teach,' he said. 'I will write and make
money. I will rise like a Phoenix. Courage, my little cabbage!'</p>

<p>"To Wanda it was&mdash;just hell! For a time she appeared dazed
by the whole thing. She had been genuinely frightened, and
experienced a certain sense of relief in escaping with her life.
But when she began to settle down and realize the situation, the
reaction was violent. She found herself cooped up in these two
wretched rooms with a man who did nothing but tinkle on a piano, or
scribble on sheets of paper. She wandered the streets and found a
city larger and gayer than Petersburg. She saw magnificent shops,
motorcars, restaurants, theatres, cabarets, and dancing-halls. She
saw gay parties of people on their way to these places, and the
sight made her eat her heart out. She did not believe in her
husband or his ridiculous music. She felt she had been deceived and
wronged. She turned against him, and vent all her pent-up spleen
upon the unfortunate musician. 'I married an old fool,' she would
tell him. 'Oh, my God! all my brilliance thrown away on a
nincompoop who thinks he's a genius! Oh, fool that I am.'</p>

<p>"Vieninoff struggled on. He managed to get a few pupils, sons
and daughters of tradespeople, who paid badly and were very stupid.
They came and went, came and went. He just managed to pay the rent,
and buy the barest necessities of life for them both. When not
teaching he spent his whole time trying to compose, and for this
reason he was happier than his wife. She did nothing but sit about,
nag her husband, and urge him to get work that brought in more
money.</p>

<p>"He was always optimistic. He believed that better times would
come, that he would be appreciated, but nothing happened. The years
went by, and their position became only worse. And then Mr.
Vieninoff began to cough. And he coughed, and coughed, and
something told him that the end was not far off, and the knowledge
brought with it an element of relief. For as he coughed so did
Wanda become more intolerant and abusive. It was bad enough to have
a poor husband, but a sick one was even worse.</p>

<p>"She began to prepare for her husband's death. When he died she
would sell that wretched piano, and the few sticks of furniture,
burn his musical manuscripts, and try to get back to her beloved
Russia. Or perhaps she would marry again, a rich man this time and
a brilliant one. Perhaps she would stop in Paris. There were many
rich men in Paris&mdash;Americans, English, Italian. What did it
matter? She had not yet lost her looks. She became quite eager for
her husband's death. She even did not hesitate to discuss it with
him, to jibe at him, and asked him what provision he had made when
he deserted her!"</p>

<p>Monsieur Denoyel threw the stump of his cigar far away across
the sand with an angry gesture. It whipped the night air like a
firefly, and settled behind some scrub. Then leaning forward on his
stick he continued:</p>

<p>"Vieninoff had been very good to his wife. In the early days he
had loved her passionately. When eyerything went wrong he had stuck
to her. In their material distress he had thought more of her than
of himself. When they were practically starving it was never she
who went without. But lying on his bed towards the end of his days
he suddenly realized with vivid intensity the kind of woman she
was. A slow anger and resentment began to burn within him. In fair
weather she had been all smiles and charm, in foul she proved
herself utterly callous and heartless. He felt a desire to punish
her in some way. But what could he do? It was perhaps bad enough to
leave her nearly penniless. That alone would have been intolerable
if she had loved him and been good to him. But he knew that when he
died she would not be penniless for long. She was not that kind of
woman. She would dance upon his grave. She would forget him, or
cherish his memory as an ugly nightmare. Lying there in the
darkness he went over and over again the tragic horror of the
situation. It stirred him at strange angles. It even aroused the
musician in him. Sombre musical phrases pounded through his brain.
<i>He would write his own funeral march!</i> Moreover, it should be
played at his own funeral at all costs. It seemed the only thing
left to him&mdash;a dignified gesture with which to leave the
world. The thought almost made him chuckle with anticipation and
glee.</p>

<p>"When she asked him the next day what he was doing, he replied:
'I'm writing my masterpiece.' She sneered at him and went out. Mr.
Vieninoff was very busy for weeks after that. He never left his
room. And then one day he pulled himself together, and putting on
an old hat on which the dust was very thick, he crawled out and
visited a notary in an adjoining street. 'I want to make my will,'
he said. He gave a careful detailed list of all his belongings, and
explained that on his death these were to be immediately sold and
the money set aside to defray the expenses of a band employed to
accompany him to the graye. And the band was to play his own
funeral march.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said the notary. 'And what about your wife?'</p>

<p>"'I leave her the residue of the estate,' he said, with a low
chuckle.</p>

<p>"'And what does that amount to?'</p>

<p>"Mr. Vieninoff shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"'Oh,' he replied, 'there are my manuscripts.'</p>

<p>"The notary probably thought he was a lunatic. But there it is.
The law's the law. The will was duly drawn up and signed. Haying
accomplished this feat Mr. Vieninoff's grip on life appeared to
cease. He died quietly one evening a few weeks later. He was quite
alone when the end came, his wife being out at a cabaret with a
woman friend."</p>

<p>Monsieur Denoyel lighted another cigar. The windows of some of
the upper rooms at the Reina Christa were beginning to add their
reflections to the pattern on the bay, suggesting that the early
people were already retiring. The deep melodious cry of a brown owl
reached us from a long way off across the dunes. My informant
coughed, and appeared a little uncertain how to complete the
picture he was conjuring up. At last he said:</p>

<p>"Paris is essentially a city of the unexpected. One should never
be surprised at anything one sees or hears there. But Mr.
Vieninoff's funeral was surely one of the most surprising
spectacles that ever appeared in that surprising city. Madame
Vieninoff had heard nothing about the will, and, as you may
imagine, when the notary appeared and read the terms of it to her
she was furious. Vieninoff had left her nothing but the
premeditated bonfire of his manuscripts. Madame Myrthil, the
landlady of the establishment, declared that in a moment of
hysterical rage Madame Vieninoff had actually struck her dead
husband with a roll of music. But let us prefer to believe that
this was an exaggeration. In any case, she found herself in a
helpless position. Monsieur Pitau, the notary, was a dry old stick,
but he was very efficient, and he performed his duties with
meticulous care. His trouble was being so pressed for time. It
appeared that Mr. Vieninoff had bought the piano on the
hire-purchase system, and it was now his property. This, of course,
made a considerable difference, and when everything was sold he
found that the estate realized several thousand francs. And this
money he had to spend on a band!</p>

<p>"A band! Monsieur Pitau knew nothing about bands. How to hire a
band? So the day before the funeral he went to a friend who
conducted an orchestra in a café in the Bouleyard Poissinnière.
This gentleman was a violinist conducting an orchestra of four. But
that wasn't sufficient. Monsieur Pitau wanted a <i>band</i>, a
large band to play a funeral march in the streets. He was prepared
to spend several thousand francs. The violinist said, 'Good,' leave
it to him. The next morning there assembled in a little yard off
the Rue des Ecoles the strangest band you can possibly imagine.
There were the four musicians from the café wearing a curious green
semi-military fustian which was their accustomed uniform. There
were seyen or eight students from the Conservatoire with piccolos,
clarionets, flutes, and saxophones. There were two drummers from an
infantry regiment, and several other odd people who had surely
newer had a musical instrument in their hands before. The parts
were handed round, and of course there was no time for a
rehearsal.</p>

<p>"When the hearse arrived, the conductor drew his strange company
up into some kind of order. The perfectly plain corn was covered
with a black pall on which reposed one wreath of immortelles. There
were no mourners, although Madame Vieninoff followed the band, as
though wildly hoping that even yet something might be extracted
from this exhibition of lunacy.</p>

<p>"The cavalcade started, and the band struck up. Now the
conductor, who played the violin, was some kind of a musician, and
he made a serious attempt to interpret the themes of the dead
composer. But the same cannot be said of the others. They began
solemnly marching down the Boulevard St. Michel. A crowd quickly
began to collect. And everyone was saying: 'Whose funeral is this?
What is this band? What are they playing?' No one could give an
answer. By the time they had crossed the river and reached the
Grands Boulevards thousands were following, and the band had got
quite out of hand. They had entirely lost all sense of a
composition. There never was heard such a raging cacophony, such a
screaming riot of discord. Long before they reached Montmartre the
students were ragging the whole thing. The saxophone was wailing
little bits of jazz, the flute interlarding passages from vulgar
popular songs. The people were roaring with laughter, refusing to
believe that it was a real funeral at all. It was only the
conductor and the two military drummers who lent to the performance
any sense of rhythm at all. So great was the congestion that before
Montmartre Cemetery was reached a large body of police was
telephoned for to keep the people in order. There was very nearly a
riot. And in any case, it led to an inquiry, which cost the country
thousands of francs. And thus it was that poor Mr. Vieninoff went
to his last resting-place, and Madame Vieninoff received her
punishment."</p>

<p>Monsieur Denoyel stood up.</p>

<p>"Let us stroll back," he said, "and I will tell you perhaps the
strangest part of the story on the way. The affair, as you may
imagine, got into the newspapers. It made what the papers calla
'story,' a good 'story' too. It occupied a prominent place on the
front page of not only all the French newspapers, but of the
English and American. There was something which captured the
imagination in an unknown composer writing his own funeral march,
and going to his grave to the strains of it.</p>

<p>"While the public interest was still hot on it, an astute
publisher had the wit to publish the composition with the 'story'
printed on the cover. And then, of course, the most surprising
thing of all happened. Someone quite by chance showed a copy to
Monsieur Taillandier, the conductor of the Philharmonic orchestra.
That gentleman glanced through it idly, and then his interest
became aroused. He took it home and studied it. And suddenly he
exclaimed to his wife: 'But this is a most interesting and original
composition!'</p>

<p>"You have already no doubt anticipated what was to follow.
Monsieur Taillandier sought information about this composer and his
work, and he was referred to Monsieur Pitau, who passed him on to
the widow. One afternoon, he called on Madame Vieninoff. He found
her surveying an enormous mass of music manuscripts piled up on the
stove. There were tears of anger in her eye, and a box of matches
in her hand.</p>

<p>"'What are you doing, madame?' he inquired.</p>

<p>"'I'm trying to destroy the relics of a wasted life,' she blazed
at him. 'And the filthy stuff won't burn. It's too thick.'</p>

<p>"Monsieur Taillandier snatched a bundle from the heated stove.
The edges of the music were charred. It was his turn to be
angry.</p>

<p>"'Imbecile!' he screamed at her.</p>

<p>"She did not, of course, know who he was, and she became even
angrier. They had a bad quarter of an hour, till at last he was
able to persuade her that the music might not only be good, but it
might have some commercial value. This altered the whole case. She
allowed him to come later with a secretary and sort the music out.
A musical agent was called in to deal with it. Monsieur Taillandier
proved himself a sound judge, but he never for a moment anticipated
the surprising results of his discovery. A lot of the work was
immature, particularly that done during his days of prosperity in
Petersburg. But all his later work was surprisingly brilliant. He
had written innumerable concertos, symphonies, and sonatas, to say
nothing of songs and piano solos. All these were published and
performed, and a Vieninoff composition became quite a vogue. But
the most profitable discovery for Madame Vieninoff was that of two
light operas. One, called 'Licette'&mdash;which he must have
written when he was starving&mdash;you have probably heard, or
heard of. It has been running simultaneously in Boston, Paris, and
Vienna for nearly a year. The other is shortly to be produced."</p>

<p>"You mean to say," I ventured, "that Madame Vieninoff is a
comparatively rich woman, all through her husband's despised
compositions?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Denoyel shrugged his shoulders. "She winters here at
the Reina Christa. She has her own maid. I have met her during the
season at Cannes, and Pau, and Seville. She has not yet found it
necessary to&mdash;marry her rich man."</p>

<p>We were approaching the wrought-iron entrance gate to the
hotel.</p>

<p>"There is one mystery I cannot yet understand, monsieur," I
said. "How is it that you know all the details of this affair?"</p>

<p>He pressed my arm confidentially.</p>

<p>"I was the doctor, monsieur, who attended Vieninoff till the
last. He told me all on his death-bed. I had the honour of being
the only person to send him a final tribute&mdash;a wreath of
immortelles. I am the only one who knows the whole truth. It is
perhaps for this reason that Madame Vieninoff is&mdash;well, shall
I say a little shy in my presence?"</p>

<p>We walked up the drive, and lo! there on the verandah in her
favourite seat was Madame Vieninoff, surrounded by her satellites.
I was conscious of a sudden wave of anger, the kind of anger which
youth invariably feels in the face of injustice. She had not seen
us, and I turned to my friend and whispered:</p>

<p>"You could make it very&mdash;unpleasant for her."</p>

<p>He smiled, and patted my shoulder.</p>

<p>"She is a woman," he said, as though this laconic phrase were
sufficient to dismiss any form of passionate judgment. Then he held
out his hand, and added: "Good night. Do not let her disturb your
dreams;" and he gave me a formal little bow and passed through the
door and out of my life.</p>

<p>Disturb my dreams! No, she shouldn't disturb my dreams, but she
was seriously disturbing my waking hours. Almost involuntarily I
ambled in the direction of the verandah. I sat on a wooden bench
below it, and I heard her talking, and these were the words which
reached me:</p>

<p>"Ah, my poor dear Serge, there was a genius if ever there was
one. Listen, darling, he would never have had the courage to
persist had I not so often told him success would one day come to
him. We were living in quite humble circumstances in those days, a
small flat with only one servant. Poor Serge used to despair, but
when things were at their blackest, I would take him by the hand
and whisper: 'Courage, my dear one, one little step down the fickle
road of destiny, and you will be there,' and I would lead him to
the piano-stool. I was always at his elbow. I was the rock upon
which he leant. During those long months when I nursed him night
and day, he clung to me for support and inspiration. He died in my
arms. 'Ah, my wife,' he whispered&mdash;and these were his last
words&mdash;'my wife, my love&mdash;my inspiration.' Isn't it
wonderful, darling, to have loved like that?"</p>

<p>A woman! Oh, my dear Monsieur Denoyel!</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>15. "Page 189"</h2>

<p>There is one theme over which the philosopher never tires of
wagging his finger at us. It is that of the illusory character of
riches. And there is, perhaps, no field in which his propaganda has
been less fruitful of results. One does not argue with him, of
course. No one argues with a philosopher; one treats him like a
child. One may say that philosophy is and always has been one of
the least potent factors in shaping human actions. Passion, greed,
prejudice, heredity, love&mdash;even the daily press&mdash;have all
done more.</p>

<p>And so again and again the philosopher and his father, and his
grandfather, right back to the days of Diogenes, have enlarged upon
the fact that wealth cannot buy any of the things that matter; that
riches do not make for happiness; that high thinking and low living
is the better programme; that the rich man cannot pass through the
eye of a needle. And we say: "Yes, father. You're quite right." And
directly his back is turned, we immediately begin to think how best
to collect the filthy impedimenta to true happiness. We are willing
to take our chance about the needle. Perhaps we shall be the one in
ten thousand who gets through. Anyway, it will be a pleasant
journey. We are in good company. Smith, Jones, and Pierpont Morgan
are all on the same road. If they negotiate the eye, why shouldn't
we?</p>

<p>It is an undoubted fact that a vast percentage of the
inhabitants of this earth, living in poverty, are in a condition of
constant anxiety; are held together, are sustained through years
and years of drab existences, by the vague hope that somehow,
somewhere, by some means of which they see no tangible evidence,
they will acquire&mdash;wealth. It is their constant dream; their
obsession. If they knew for certain that there was no possibility
of their ever becoming rich, they could not go on.</p>

<p>Old Tobias Tollery was not one of these unfortunate creatures.
He was enormously wealthy and he despised wealth. Possibly because
he had made his money himself, and for fifty years of his life had
been a comparatively poor man. Now a wealthy man who despises
wealth is, in the opinion of all right-minded people&mdash;a crank.
And there is no gainsaying the fact that Old Tollery was a crank in
every way. He looked like a crank. He dressed like a crank. He
talked like a crank. He was a crank.</p>

<p>At the age of seventy-three he lived alone in a large house in
the Cromwell Road, attended by two old servants. He spent most of
his time in a laboratory which he had built on the top floor. He
wore&mdash;anything comfortable which happened to be lying about.
Flannel trousers and a tweed coat and a scarf; never a collar or a
tie. He shuffled along at a great pace in his felt slippers, as
though his body was trying to catch up with his large, bald head,
which was always occupied with some urgent matter connected with
test-tubes, and cylinders, and microscopes. He had innumerable
relatives, who had discovered him in his old age, and who were
always calling upon him, and to whom he was extremely rude. The
sycophantic manner in which they accepted his rebuffs may have been
one of the causes of his somewhat cynical regard for wealth. An old
bachelor, seventy-three years of age, rather asthmatic, no
particular ties or responsibilities&mdash;to whom was he going to
leave all his money?</p>

<p>He had, however, one and&mdash;from the relatives' point of
view&mdash;dangerous friend, old Simon Occleve. Simon Occleve was
his lawyer; a man of similar age and disposition to Tobias himself.
He was, indeed, his only friend; the only person in whose society
Tobias expressed any pleasure. They dined together twice a week;
sometimes lunched together at an imposing club in St. James's
Street, and on occasions Tobias would go down to Simon's house at
Haslemere and spend a few days. Tobias would assuredly leave Simon
part of his fortune unless, happily, the lawyer should die
first.</p>

<p>It may be advisable at this point to enumerate the old
gentleman's relatives. They consisted, roughly speaking, of two
families&mdash;the Tollerys and the Bowers. All his immediate
family were dead; but he had a married niece, Laura, married to a
stationer in West Kensington, whose name was Valentine Bower, and
they had living with them two middle-aged, unmarried daughters,
Ethel and Clara Bower.</p>

<p>He also had a married nephew, the Reverend Guy Tollery, whose
living was at Highgate, and whose wife&mdash;a keen-featured,
domineering person&mdash;rejoiced in the name of Lettice. They, in
their turn, had a profligate son, Harold, who had married a barmaid
named Annie, a pretty, common, warm-hearted little thing, of whom
he was quite unworthy. Harold and Annie Tollery had a small boy of
six, named Richard.</p>

<p>These were the sum total of the old gentleman's relatives.</p>

<p>The financial status of the two families was somewhat similar.
They had enough, but not sufficient. They suffered from a kind of
financial unrest, owing to the unexpected propinquity of this rich
uncle. Otherwise, they seemed to have plenty of money to pay their
rent, buy good food and clothes, take reasonably long holidays, and
get postage stamps (the postage stamps being principally required
for the purpose of sending tactful appeals to Uncle Tobias). These
appeals were always wrapped up in most plausible
covers&mdash;church funds, extension of shop premises, education,
etc. The old man always said: "Rubbish and nonsense! Fiddlesticks!"
But he invariably paid.</p>

<p>The only one he had ceased to help was Harold, who was a
notorious gambler, and had been caught out on two occasions telling
Uncle Tobias a lie. But before dismissing him, he had delivered
himself of a little homily. He had said:</p>

<p>"It's no good your coming to me again. I shan't help you. Go and
educate yourself. You are not trying. My whole life has been spent
on educating myself, and I'm still doing it. I ran away to sea at
fifteen&mdash;the best education in the world. I settled in South
Africa and observed. That is what education is&mdash;applied
observation. I studied mining and chemistry. I went to South
America, Mexico, and then the States. It was in the States I made
my money&mdash;eventually and quite unexpectedly...you
know&mdash;the Tollery Tripod, an electric portable cooker. A
ridiculous invention. I take no pride in it. It was just an
accident during the course of my education. Go away and observe,
and perhaps you'll learn not to be a fool."</p>

<p>One night Tobias and Simon Occleve were dining alone in the
large house in Cromwell Road. Their dinner consisted of a lemon
sole, a cutlet, and a very ancient cheese. Tobias drank
barley-water, and Simon had a little weak whisky and water. When
the meal was finished, Tobias lighted a long, thin cigar. He never
offered them to his friend, because he knew he preferred a pipe. He
waited till the old woman had cleared the things away, then, making
himself thoroughly comfortable in the easy chair by the fire and
observing that Simon was in a similar happy position opposite, he
picked up the black cat from the rug and put it on his knee. He
stroked the cat gravely with his long, knobbly fingers, until the
purr of contentment attuned itself to the gentle harmony of the
hour. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Simon, I am anxious to put myself under a further obligation to
you."</p>

<p>"Come, come," smiled Simon; "I don't realize any past
obligations, Tobias. I am a professional man&mdash;a
lawyer&mdash;one of these 'thieving lawyers,' you know. I always
charge you for whatever I may have the good fortune to be able to
do for you."</p>

<p>Tobias pursed up his lips.</p>

<p>"Rubbish and nonsense! Your charges to me, I know, are nominal.
But the obligations I am under do not principally concern
professional matters."</p>

<p>"Well, what can I do?"</p>

<p>"I want you to find me an acid test."</p>

<p>"A chemical experiment?"</p>

<p>"Almost. Let us call it a psycho-physiological experiment."</p>

<p>"You excite me profoundly, Tobias."</p>

<p>"These people!" Tobias left off stroking the cat and waved his
arm impatiently in the direction of the door. "I am tired of it.
Something has got to happen. Those two women, Laura, you know (Mrs.
Bower), and that clergyman's wife (Lettice)&mdash;they were here
again this afternoon. It is 'Uncle Tobs!' and 'dear Uncle Tobs,
won't you come to our Christmas party?' I'm not a hard man, Simon,
although I've led a hard life. Even at my age I am loath to shut
out all affection. I realize that my blood relations have a certain
call on me. Only the holding of wealth makes one suspicious. I
suspect everyone, and yet how do I know? Some of them may have a
real affection for me. Since my return I have disbursed among my
relatives some four thousand pounds; Harold alone relieved me of
five hundred before I had been in the country a year. But my
suspicions, founded upon close observation, are that the matter
which interests them most deeply is the question of my demise. As
you know, Simon, I have made no will. In the event of my death, the
money will be divided by your meticulous care between all these
people."</p>

<p>"I have always wanted you to make a will, Tobias."</p>

<p>"I know. I know. And I have always put it off. I am now coming
to the opinion that I can put it off no longer."</p>

<p>"I think you're right, Tobias. Have you formed any general or
individual feelings with regard to your relatives?"</p>

<p>Old Tollery put the cat down and looked meditatively at the
fire.</p>

<p>"I cannot abide that clergyman; but Lettice, although
objectionable in many ways, I feel to be an honest woman. It is
deplorable to have a profligate son. At the same time, I am sorry
for Harold's wife&mdash;one of the pleasantest and least offensive
of them all&mdash;and the boy might be a nice boy, if he had the
chance of proper education. As for the Bowers, Valentine is a
greedy nonentity, Laura is kind in a way, but embittered by a long
life with a feeble partner. I sometimes think Ethel is a nice
woman. I'm not sure that she has not a real affection for me, or if
not, it is most cleverly simulated. I find her more companionable
than the gloomy Clara, though Clara, curiously enough, is the only
one who has never deliberately begged from me. I am wondering about
Clara. I'm not quite certain..."</p>

<p>Simon took a spill and relighted his pipe.</p>

<p>"It is not for me to influence you in any way...Of course, there
are institutions, hospitals. You have a pretty considerable
fortune, Tobias."</p>

<p>"Yes. I think I shall leave the bulk of my savings to Scientific
Research, but I will reserve a sum&mdash;say twenty thousand
pounds&mdash;for my relatives."</p>

<p>Then he leant forward and added:</p>

<p>"Of course, old friend, if <i>you</i> would be happier
with&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Simon immediately patted the other's knee vigorously.</p>

<p>"I appreciate what you are going to suggest thoroughly. But no,
no, no. I am an old man, Tobias. It is very doubtful whether I
shall survive you. In any case, I have more than enough for my
needs to the end of my days. I should be happier if you willed the
money elsewhere. Nevertheless, it is very kind, very kind and
thoughtful."</p>

<p>"Well, it must be like that then."</p>

<p>"But this is all quite simple. What do you mean by the acid
test, Tobias?"</p>

<p>"What I want to ask you to do is to find some way by which I can
test the affection and friendship of my relatives. Give them all an
equal chance. The one who proves him or herself the loyalest to me
shall inherit&mdash;nay, shall have at once&mdash;the sum of twenty
thousand pounds."</p>

<p>Simon looked down into the bowl of his pipe; then he smiled and
answered:</p>

<p>"Well, I am your lawyer. I must obey instructions. But you must
give me time."</p>

<p>"There is no hurry. In any case I do not mean to die for some
months&mdash;not till I have completed a little experiment I am
making concerning the extraction of nitrogen from the air."</p>

<p>Simon spent three weeks thinking out his scheme, then he came to
Tobias and said:</p>

<p>"I think, old friend, it would be better for me to reveal my
plan to you by instalments. In the first place, it will be
necessary for me to relieve you of all your money."</p>

<p>"I expected that."</p>

<p>"Naturally. The most obvious plan, but a good ground work."</p>

<p>"Is it necessary to actually do so?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. They will accept my word."</p>

<p>That same week every member of the Bowers and the Tollerys
received an identical letter.</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Sir or Madam,&mdash;Owing to the sudden
liquidation of a large company in which he held important interests
and the financial crisis arising therefrom, I am instructed by my
client, Mr. Tobias Tollery, to warn you that he will require the
return of the sum of &mdash;&mdash; advanced to you as a loan by
him on &mdash;&mdash;. My client will be glad if you will return
the same without interest, or in lieu, as great a part of it as you
are capable by Saturday week next, the 4th prox.<br>
<br>
Yours faithfully,<br>
Simon Occleve.</p>

<p>The effect of this letter was electrical. At ten o'clock the
next morning the old gentleman was disturbed at his breakfast by
the appearance of Lettice Tollery and Harold.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Uncle?" screamed Lettice.</p>

<p>"It doesn't mean you're losing your money, does it? It isn't
serious, is it?"</p>

<p>"You see what my lawyer says. I leave everything to him."</p>

<p>"Is he to be trusted?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is!"</p>

<p>"But all your money is surely not in this company."</p>

<p>"Practically."</p>

<p>"It's madness! I can't believe it. Let us call in another
lawyer."</p>

<p>"Why add the expense?"</p>

<p>"What's the name of the company, Uncle?" asked Harold.</p>

<p>Before the old man had had time to formulate an answer the door
flew open, and Mrs. Bower and Ethel burst into the room. Ethel
threw her arms round his neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Tobs, tell us it isn't true!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What does it amount to, dear?" breathlessly asked Mrs.
Bower.</p>

<p>"It's no good your all pestering me," snapped the old man. "I
can tell you nothing. What Simon Occleve says&mdash;stands."</p>

<p>"But I haven't got five hundred and sixty pounds to return,"
said Mrs. Bower.</p>

<p>"And I haven't got two hundred to my name," said Mrs.
Tollery.</p>

<p>"And I haven't got a bean in the world," said Harold, and he
picked up his hat and walked out.</p>

<p>The storm raged for ten days. It was very trying for Tobias. It
interfered with his experiment.</p>

<p>They swept backwards and forwards between the Cromwell Road and
Simon Occleve's office in the Temple. The old lawyer was terse and
uncommunicative. No, Mr. Tollery was not ruined. But he was badly
hit. It all depended upon certain delicate financial operations
during the next few weeks. In the meantime all available capital
was necessary. The difficulty might right itself if Mr. Tollery's
debtors would fulfil their obligations. He could tell them nothing
more.</p>

<p>The dreaded Saturday, the 4th prox., arrived. The two old
gentlemen dined alone at the end of the day.</p>

<p>"I am quite surprised that our request has met with the response
it has," said Tobias, when they had reached the nicotine stage.
"Clara has surprised me most. She has sent forty pounds and a
formal note of regret that it is not more. Lettice has sent fifteen
pounds and a letter of vituperative aggression. No one else has
sent money. The Reverend Guy has written a long letter forgiving me
my past sins and hoping I may yet find grace in the eyes of God. He
promises to send something later on. Valentine, a long whine of
excuses. Ethel, gush and regrets. Mrs. Bower, more excuses, and a
kind of veiled threat. Harold, nothing at all. His wife, nothing at
all. Now, what is the next move, Mr. Lawyer?"</p>

<p>"We must be thorough. We must clean you of every penny."</p>

<p>"The furniture?"</p>

<p>"My 'bailiffs' will arrive next week to take possession!"</p>

<p>"I don't like doing this, Simon. It seems mean."</p>

<p>"I am giving you the acid test."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>The "bailiff" arrived on the same day that every member of the
family received a letter, this time from Tobias:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear &mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;I have very serious
news for us all. I regret to say that Mr. Simon Occleve, whom I
have always trusted and looked upon as my greatest friend, has
absconded. I am completely bankrupt. Another firm of lawyers is
winding up my accounts.<br>
<br>
Yours, etc.,<br>
T. T.</p>

<p>Within the hour Mrs. Bower appeared with her husband, Valentine,
and Ethel, and they were quickly joined by Lettice, who came alone.
Tobias was busy in his laboratory, and thither they all pushed
their way, and there was a great scene. It reached its climax when
they learned that the two gentlemen in the hall were bailiffs. Even
the furniture was lost. There was nothing to sell at all.</p>

<p>"And you sit here," shouted Lettice, "messing about with those
stinking chemicals!"</p>

<p>"You've treated us disgracefully," echoed Mrs. Bower.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Uncle?" asked Ethel. "You'll have to
go to a workhouse."</p>

<p>"I told you all the time that that lawyer was a common thief.
You could see it in his face." This was Lettice.</p>

<p>"You should never trust lawyers," piped Valentine.</p>

<p>"I could see he was dishonest. Are the police on his track? We
shall demand to know all the details." The thin face of Mrs. Bower
was thrust forward, and she shook her curls at him
threateningly.</p>

<p>"You'll mind your own business," snapped Tobias, who was
beginning to feel uncomfortable and angry. But the mask was off.
There was no need for any further politeness.</p>

<p>"I shan't trouble to tell you what I think of you, you old
fraud!" added Mrs. Bower.</p>

<p>"If you had been a little more informing and friendly to your
relations you wouldn't have got into all this mess. You might, for
instance, have consulted the Reverend Guy. He's not an adventurer,
and he's not wealthy, but he has sound practical sense. He would
have looked after your affairs with pleasure."</p>

<p>The old man surveyed Lettice through his thick glasses and
remarked:</p>

<p>"Yes. I expect he would. Harold too, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Harold has never robbed anybody."</p>

<p>Just as they were all going Tobias had a surprise. Valentine
shuffled uncomfortably on the fringe of the crowd. The party had
reached the door, when the little stationer returned and furtively
thrust out his hand.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned sorry," he said in his reedy voice, twirling
his thin grey moustache with the other hand. "It's damned hard
lines." Then he slunk away to the protection of his wife's
skirts.</p>

<p>Simon wished to be thorough, but, like a good organizer, he
always had an eye to economy. The next day several men appeared.
The halls and staircase were gutted of furniture and carpets, which
were placed carefully inside various rooms. Then the doors were
locked and the shutters were put up. When the family next called
Tobias was apparently living in the laboratory, where an iron
bedstead had been put in. He was to remain in possession of the
house till quarter day, when he was going to Fulham Workhouse. He
was also to be allowed to retain his laboratory equipment to that
date. The old woman who waited on him had kindly consented to
remain also. The house appeared to be empty and utterly desolate.
The metamorphosis was complete. Tobias had everything he wanted in
the laboratory, but it cannot be said that he was happy. The thing
assumed larger dimensions than he had bargained for. It disturbed
horrid emotions. "Damn Simon," he thought "It's positively
cruel."</p>

<p>He experienced sudden waves of pity for these unfortunate
relatives which interfered with his work. The more contemptible and
pitiable they were, the more sorry he was for them. What a terrible
thing is this money-lust! They were not really in need. They could
all, indeed&mdash;possibly with the exception of Harold&mdash;have
paid him back. But they were mad to get his wealth. And in each one
it produced an individual eruption. It made them give themselves
away. It made him ashamed to enjoy the secret vision of so many
naked souls. It was like eavesdropping, uncannily unfair. But he
had placed himself in the hands of Simon, and he could not go back.
During the weeks that followed he learnt all there was to learn
about his blood relations.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bower and Mrs. Tollery called every day for a week, as
though they could not credit the disaster. Mrs. Bower continued her
abuse and threats to the end of that time; then she vanished, and
he never saw her again. Lettice called twice more, and was almost
as vindictive, but in the end she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you want anything you must let us know. I don't
say we'll do it, but you can let us know."</p>

<p>Ethel did not come at all, but one day Clara appeared. She was
surly and diffident. She neither criticized nor pitied him, but as
she went she put down another five pounds and said:</p>

<p>"I know I owe you more. That's the best? can do."</p>

<p>Valentine did not call, but he wrote a letter marked
<i>"private,"</i> and said again that he was damned sorry and that
it was a damned shame. Of Harold, of course, there was no sign; but
one day his wife called with the little boy, Richard, who was five
years old.</p>

<p>The mother looked worn and worried. She was losing her good
looks and her quick, little, birdlike movements. Her eyes were
ringed with dark circles. The boy, however, was a
fresh-complexioned, jolly little fellow. He put out his arms and
kissed "Uncle Tobs" soundly and mustily on the cheek. And Tobias
thrilled surprisingly. It was many years since he had been kissed
by a child. A pleasant boy...If only he could be
educated&mdash;escape from the demoralizing influence of his
father. Tobias moved uneasily in his chair. He was under a compact
with Simon. He must be entirely impartial with all the relatives.
They must all have an equal chance. Above all, he must be reserved,
abrupt, and rather taciturn.</p>

<p>"Are you reely ruined, Uncle Tobs?" said Annie Tollery. "It's an
awful thing. I know Harold treated you bad. What can we do? I hoped
he might get another chance. It's the horses, you know, and the
cards. He can't let it alone. He's not reely bad, Uncle, not
vicious like, except sometimes when they make him drink. It's
terrible for us, Uncle."</p>

<p>She pleaded as though she, too, could not credit the disaster.
Things must right themselves. Tobias said nothing, but once he
patted the little boy on the head. Then he turned away to his
bottles and powders.</p>

<p>"I must be getting on with my work," he grunted.</p>

<p>Annie sniffed and blew her nose. As she was going out she put a
paper-bag down on the table and said:</p>

<p>"Here's just a little something. I made it myself."</p>

<p>When they had gone he opened the parcel and found it contained a
pork pie! And Uncle Tobs turned it over and stared at it. His lips
trembled a little, and he replaced it on the table.</p>

<p>"It's very queer," he mumbled.</p>

<p>That evening he dined again with Simon, and their dinner
consisted of turbot, pork-pie and salad. He did not tell Simon
where the pork-pie came from, but the lawyer gave it as his opinion
that it was excellent. Over the fire he said:</p>

<p>"It is rather fortunate that just at this time I have opened a
new office in Brick Court. Quite an inaccessible spot to the
uninitiated. Of course, my old offices are still going, and it is
also a little fortunate that the style of my firm is still 'Messrs.
Mulberry &amp; Platt,' for, as you may imagine, we have had many
visitors. It has been necessary to let my head clerk, Peters, into
the secret. He reports that practically all your relatives have
called. Peters is very mysterious and secretive. He is enjoying
himself. 'Yes, he says, 'our Mr. Occleve is away just now. I can't
tell you more. Have you any demand or complaint against him?' And,
of course, they haven't. It's no business of theirs. Peters is
quite masterful. He tells them nothing, but gives an appearance of
nervous agitation. He asks them endless questions. He is very
sympathetic. When they go away they realize that they have done all
the talking. They have learnt nothing, but their feelings have been
soothed by a kind of vague insinuation that 'our Mr. Occieve really
must have absconded. It will all come out in due course. In the
meantime, if you have any definite charges to make, etc.'"</p>

<p>"I am beginning to wish the whole thing was over."</p>

<p>"My dear Tobias, of course you are; and I am willing to end it
at any time. But I should be glad of, at any rate, one more week of
general discomfort. I want to disillusion you of the idea that
people are wholly good or wholly bad. It is very unlikely that in
the end you will feel that any one of your relatives stands out
from the rest. You may want to divide the money equally, or shall
we say equitably, according to the various ways they have treated
you."</p>

<p>"I am certainly learning a lot."</p>

<p>During that last week Lawyer Occleve put three more tests to
these good people, and they were all a repetition. They consisted
of a letter from Tobias to each member of the family. He said he
was unwell and obliged to keep his bed. He specified three nights,
Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday. He had not the means to invite them
to dinner, but would they come in afterwards and read a scientific
book to him for a couple of hours? It was November and the nights
were cold, and dark, and wet.</p>

<p>In reply to this the Reverend Guy sent him a tract called, "Am I
walking in my Master's footsteps?" Valentine wrote and said he
would have come, but he was no reader; at the same time, he thought
it was a damned shame. No one else answered. On the Tuesday, much
to his surprise, Lettice appeared. She was in a very bad temper,
and she had last her umbrella on the bus coming along. She bullied
him, but read a few chapters of a book on <i>Crystals.</i> She read
so badly that Tobias was rude to her at the end of half an hour.
She rounded on him for having dragged her all that way for nothing.
She said she had had a headache and must go. Tobias was relieved
when she went. He noted that she had read as far as page
sixty-three. On Thursday no one came at all, but Ethel sent a
postcard to say she had meant to come on Tuesday, but vas prevented
at the last minute. She couldn't possibly manage either of the
other two nights. She hoped he was going on all right, and that
things might right themselves. On the last night of the tests the
two old gentlemen dined together again. It was considered so remote
a possibility that anyone would come that they decided to sit
upstairs in the laboratory. Tobias would wear his dressing-gown,
and if anyone should come, he would slip into bed, whilst Simon
would hide behind the curtain which concealed the sink and lavatory
at the end of the room.</p>

<p>The night was very dark and the wind was moaning round the
skylight, but the two old friends were in good spirits. Tobias
lighted his cigar and Simon his pipe, and they discussed cheerfully
the better times to come.</p>

<p>"I am very grateful to you, Simon," said Tobias. "I certainly
know how I stand, but I am very relieved that it is all over."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Well, we will make plans. We'll soon get you straight
again. And while the change is being effected you must come down to
Haslemere with me. But come, you were just going to tell me of this
new idea of yours with regard to the fourth dimension."</p>

<p>Tobias's eye lighted up. He peered above the ash of his cigar
and cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"The idea came to me on reflecting over this discovery of
Professor Einstein with regard to the curvature of light. One
presupposes that the stellar system&mdash;damn!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Tobias?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear? It was the bell."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Simon walked stealthily to the door and opened it. The wind
seemed to have found its way into the great corridors and passages.
He heard the heavy laborious tread of old Mrs. Turner coming slowly
up the stone staircase from the basement. She carried a lantern,
for the house was in complete darkness, the electric light being
presumably cut off. Tobias switched off the light in the laboratory
and lighted a paraffin lamp.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" he murmured. "This is the last test. If it's
Lettice, I shall simply be rude again."</p>

<p>"No, no, you must be fair," said Simon. "Remember she got as far
as page sixty-three."</p>

<p>Tobias got into bed, but Simon hovered by the door. He heard the
old woman go wheezing across the hall and slip back the chain on
the front door. He listened intently and then drew back into the
room.</p>

<p>"It's a man," he said. "I couldn't see whom."</p>

<p>He walked quietly across the room and took up his position
behind the curtain. Tobias again muttered "Damn!" and settled down
to the posture of the invalid. He was in a very bad mood. He had
been rubbed of a cigar in its most intriguing phase, and of the
development of an interesting theory at its very birth. They could
follow the slow progress of Mrs. Turner, in the van of her late
visitor, from floor to floor. Her steps resounded on the bare
boards, but the man they could not hear at all. On the landings she
stopped to get her breath, and her pulmonary disturbances carried
above the wind. The journey seemed interminable. At last she
fumbled against the latch of the door.</p>

<p>"A gentleman to see you, sir."</p>

<p>Simon peered through the crack of the curtain, and Tobias turned
his weary head in her direction.</p>

<p>In the doorway stood&mdash;Harold!</p>

<p>"He's shaved off his moustache," was the first thought which
flashed through the mind of Tobias.</p>

<p>There was something phantom-like, unconvincing, about the figure
of Harold. He appeared almost to hesitate whether to advance or to
bolt from the room again. He looked sideways at Mrs. Turner and did
not speak until she had closed the door. Then he walked gingerly up
to the bed and said: "Hallo, Uncle."</p>

<p>The visit was so unexpected, and the appearance so surprising,
that the old gentleman had no difficulty in simulating the dazed
outlook of the invalid. He put out his hand without speaking.</p>

<p>Harold took it and laughed nervously.</p>

<p>"I've come, you see," he stuttered at length, and glanced from
the invalid to the dim recesses of the laboratory. He seemed to be
listening to the retreating footsteps of Mrs. Turner.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Tobias, and he pointed to a chair by the
lamp.</p>

<p>"Bit lonely here, ain't you, Uncle? All alone in the house, eh?
Except for the old&mdash;" he jerked his thumb in the direction of
the door.</p>

<p>"What's his game?" thought Tobias, and he began to idly
speculate upon the young man's motives and character. His thin,
rather clever, dissolute face appeared in blotches of irregular
colour. His eyes were unnaturally bright. He was red round the
temples, but his lips and chin were white. He appeared to be
shivering, although the room was warm.</p>

<p>On the table, by the lamp, was an old and heavy volume on
<i>Crystals.</i> Tobias pointed a long finger at it and
remarked:</p>

<p>"There's the book."</p>

<p>Harold appeared startled, as though he did not understand. He
muttered:</p>

<p>"Eh?...the book?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you have come to read to me, haven't you?"</p>

<p>He stared at the book as though mesmerized by its ancient
pattern. He touched it with his fingers and turned it over. Then he
sniggered again.</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, yes, of course."</p>

<p>"Sit down then and begin at page one."</p>

<p>Harold obeyed. He thrust the book as near under the lamp as
possible and found the place. Then he coughed and looked round at
Tobias.</p>

<p>"Go on. Begin at the first paragraph."</p>

<p>He stared at the page fora long time, as though he was not
seeing it. Then hesitatingly he began to read. Curiously enough,
after the first few paragraphs, he read quite well. His voice was
thin and without resonance, but he spoke distinctly and as though
the words had meaning. Now and then he would stop and glance
furtively round the room. He did not look at Tobias. The wind was
still moaning against the skylight; otherwise the room seemed
unnaturally silent and remote. At the end of a chapter he sat
feverishly rubbing his chin and temple, like an animal heated in
the chase. Then he plunged into the book again as though it held
some secret charm against a sinister menace. Tobias made no
comment; he lay there listening and watching. The night grew late
and still Harold read on. Doubtless by this time the old woman
would have gone to her bed in the basement. She was rather
deaf...very feeble. A long way off could occasionally be heard the
hoot of a motor-horn. The room was getting cold. Harold stumbled
on, beginning to read huskily. Suddenly he turned over a page and
gave a cry...</p>

<p>He started up and stared hard at Tobias. The old man was
observing him intently.</p>

<p>"What is this? What is the meaning of this, Uncle?"</p>

<p>In his hand he held a thin, half-sheet of notepaper on which was
written the word "Stop" Beneath this sheet of paper was a Bank of
England note for one thousand pounds. Across his face there swept a
mingled expression of amazement, fear, greed, and a kind of
desperate resolve. What his immediate action would have been is
open to conjecture, for he was subjected to a further startling
shock. He seemed to hear a movement behind him and turning, he
beheld the trim figure of Lawyer Occleve, standing by the curtain
and idly toying with a long, steel straight-edge.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will allow me to explain on behalf of my
client."</p>

<p>The acid tones of the lawyer's voice seemed to bite the air. He
pointed at the chair and continued:</p>

<p>"You may sit down. There is nothing to be alarmed about. The
money is yours. My client, as you know, is what is known as a
crank. In one of his eccentric moods he set his relatives this
little test. When he is old, penniless, and ill, of no use to any
of them, whoever has sufficient charity of heart to turn out on a
cold night and come and read an uninteresting book to him so far as
page 189 shall have a thousand pounds. This is only one of many
little tests which, in his fanciful way, he has conceived."</p>

<p>Harold stood up.</p>

<p>"But I don't get the thousand pounds? Not for that? Not just for
doing that!"</p>

<p>"Yes, the money is yours."</p>

<p>And suddenly the young man behaved in a most peculiar way. He
flung the note from him, and burying his face in his hands, he
burst into sobs.</p>

<p>"No, no, no...I can't. You don't know. I'm bad, but&mdash;my
God! no!"</p>

<p>"My client is not so poverty-stricken as circumstances may
appear."</p>

<p>"I know all that."</p>

<p>He looked at Tobias and fell on his knees by the bed.</p>

<p>"Do you know why I came to-night?" he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I came to rob you."</p>

<p>He spoke rapidly, as though the relief of confession might be
thwarted by some further development.</p>

<p>"I've signed on for an oil ship leaving Tilbury at eight in the
morning for South America. I was desperate. Do you remember, Uncle,
telling me about education? Applied observation, you called it.
Well, I've done a bit of applied observation over this game. I knew
there was something on. I've been watching. I followed one of these
'bailiffs' to an office in Brick Court, and I watched that, and one
day I saw Mr. Occleve come out and get into a car, in which was Mr.
Peters. I was outside here one morning at six o'clock. I saw the
men gutting the halls and staircases, but I never saw no furniture
vans come to take the things away. So I reasoned they were still
here, and the house was full of valuables, and there was some game
on. I didn't know what it was. But it looked like some plan to let
the whole family in. Whatever happened, I knew I stood to get
nothing. If there was a will I shouldn't be in it. My only chance
was to find a will and destroy it; then I should be in the
share-out. I came to-night to&mdash;see if I could find a will. If
I couldn't, I was going to take anything I could find and clear
out. I was going to take it, mind you. I wasn't going to be
scrupulous how. There was only the old woman...I never saw you come
in, Mr. Occleve."</p>

<p>"No? Well, since you are making an honest confession, I will
tell you that I have an entry from the mews at the back through the
basement. And might I ask what you were prepared to do if any of
the other relatives called?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I got Annie to write to them all to say that she was
coming. And, as a matter of fact, she was. She wanted to come. Then
at the last minute I sent her a telegram to say that her mother was
sick at Hendon. I knew that would fetch her off."</p>

<p>"Then your wife didn't know you were coming here?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Does she know you're going away?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, how will she manage?"</p>

<p>"She'll be glad. She'll manage somehow like the others. I've
never been no use to her."</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned to Tobias and said eagerly:</p>

<p>"Uncle, if you can spare it&mdash;send her this thousand quid. I
don't want it. I've always been a gambler, and ready to take my
chance. Perhaps, in a way, it would make up a bit for the way I've
mucked things. She's been a good girl and little Dick..."</p>

<p>Tobias coughed and spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>"Very well. Give me an address. I can write to you."</p>

<p>"My name's Thomas Carter. I suppose 'Poste restante, Buenos
Ayres,' would find me. You're not going to give me in charge, then,
Uncle?"</p>

<p>"No. I've nothing to charge you with except&mdash;stupidity.
When you get to South America, try and apply your observation to
more worthy ends. Your wife shall be provided for. Good night!"</p>

<p>And the little old man got out of bed and lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>Harold stumbled forward and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Uncle, and God bless&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tobias gave the hand a little jerky pressure and muttered:</p>

<p>"All right, all right. If you are in difficulties, call on my
agent in the Plaza Gonzalo in Buenos Ayres. He may have word from
me. Switch on the electric light in the hall as you go out, and
pull the door to. Good-bye."</p>

<p>The two old gentlemen sat facing each other. They heard the
footsteps of Harold hurrying down the stairs, the click of the
electric light switch, and the bang of the front door. Then Tobias
stood up and walked slowly across the room.</p>

<p>"It is late, Simon; but I think a little night-cap, eh?"</p>

<p>"I am of opinion that it would be appropriate, and well
deserved."</p>

<p>They each compounded their own mixture. Tobias took three short
sips; then he said:</p>

<p>"With regard to the theory of the curvature of light, my opinion
is..."</p>

<p><br>
If you had access to the secret archives locked in one of Lawyer
Occleve's safes, you might come across a very remarkable document.
It is the will of Mr. Tobias Tullery. It would astound you with its
lucidity. You would be in a quandary to know whether to praise more
highly the fine craftsmanship of its construction or the
broad-minded liberality of its intention. Various institutions
working for the betterment of mankind are not only generously
endowed, but are given an invaluable lead in the wide
interpretation of their activities. Towards the end, under the head
of "family bequests," the phraseology appears to belong to another
mood, as though a lawyer had worded the earlier portions, but had
left this purely domestic section to the will-maker himself. It
runs as follows:</p>

<p class="letter">To my relatives I bequeath such sums as appear to
be merited by their behaviour to me when I endured a period of
great distress. To those of them who returned me a portion of the
money I lent them, I bequeath it a hundredfold. That is to say, to
Clara Bower, who returned me forty-five pounds, I bequeath four
thousand five hundred. To Lettice, Mrs. Guy Tollery, who returned
fifteen pounds, I bequeath fifteen hundred pounds. To Valentine
Bower, because he said he was "damned sorry," I leave five hundred
pounds. To the Reverend Guy Tollery I leave a dressing-case and a
new set of false teeth, as a memento of me. To Mrs. Valentine Bower
and her daughter Ethel, I leave two hundred pounds each, for no
reason other than that I am a fool. To Annie, wife of Harold Bower,
because she one day brought me a pork pie when she thought I was
hungry, and who would have read to me quite disinterestedly only
that her husband prevented her, I leave the residue of my estate to
be held in trust for her son Richard, for whom I have formed a real
affection.</p>

<p>Schis represented the family bequests of Tobias Tollery, no
mention being made of what he had done for them in life, or of a
Quixotic act of generosity he afterwards performed for a man who
would have murdered him.</p>

<p>Whether all these liberal benefices will ever be distributed as
ordained is still an open question, for old Tobias is still alive,
and he hasn't yet completed his experiment with regard to the
question of extracting nitrogen from the air.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>16. Two Bootmakers</h2>

<p>Jim Griggs was a bootmaker from the village of Walldren in
Essex. He was a mild-eyed placid little man, nearing his fortieth
year. He was happy in his home life with his true and faithful wife
Jenny and his three children Agnes, Isobel and young Scom, aged
three.</p>

<p>Jim Griggs made and repaired boots for the people of the
village, and the surrounding neighbourhood, and he took a quiet and
dignified pride in his work. He had no ambitions other than to do
his work well, and to keep his wife and children in decent comfort.
He had never travelled, except twice to London, and his education
was of the sort obtained at a village board school in the 'eighties
(and since forgotten). He lived laborious days, and in the evening
smoked a pipe and discussed the local gossip with his wife. On
Sundays he went to church and read the Sunday newspapers, and
occasionally played the harmonium in the stuffy little
sitting-room, which was only used on Sundays. There was a profusion
of antimacassars and photograph frames, a stuffed pheasant in a
glass case, and over the harmonium a coloured text which said,
"Christ died to save sinners." On rare occasions Jim would g? to
the village inn and drink a glass of beer with a neighbour, and
once or twice a year he would g? to the market, or to the flower
show at Dudlands Park. This was approximately the extent of his
recreations. If you had asked him a question about France, Germany,
or Russia, beyond knowing that they were foreign countries he would
have been almost as vague as if he were called upon to air his
views on the Fourth Dimension. Foreigners were romantic folk, very
often clever, but essentially people to be treated with suspicion.
Foreign boots were dumped on the market, "flashily built
machine-made things." They looked all right at first glance, but on
inspection they were found to be full of faults and moreover they
didn't last. There was nothing like English leather, and there were
no boots like the boots made by Jim Griggs in the village of
Walldren.</p>

<p>One day they came and told Jim Griggs that England, France and
Russia were at war with Germany and Austria, and Jim said:</p>

<p>"You don't say so! Dear, oh dear!"</p>

<p>Jim and the other villagers took a sudden interest in the
newspapers, which they read avidly. It soon became evident to them
from a careful study of the press that the Belgians, French and
Russians were splendid fellows, whilst the Germans and Austrians
were Huns and barbarians, who would have to be crushed. As the
months went by a certain mild surprise pervaded the village at the
difficulties of the task, and there was almost a consternation when
Mr. Pirbright, the schoolmaster, gave it out as his opinion that
the affair might last six months or even longer. Nevertheless the
war cannot be said to have assumed any very realistic shape to the
inhabitants. A few of the boys enlisted and were sent to a camp
near Colchester to train. Sco Jim Griggs the whole thing was beyond
imagination. He looked upon it as some peculiarly extravagant
manifestation of the press. It was like some vague historical
pageant that happened long ago and which would come to a
comfortable and satisfactory curtain in due course. He took little
interest in politics and had long ago forgotten all the history he
had learnt. These things bore very little relation to boots. If the
boot trade were to be affected, now!&mdash;</p>

<p>However, Jim found that in spite of the war people still wanted
boots. In fact boots seemed to be in greater demand than ever. He
experienced certain difficulties in getting leather, and there was
delay in the delivery of brads and paste, but apart from that, when
the first excitement was over, he had the rest of his
fellow&mdash;villagers settled down to their normal lives, and
accepted the war as an unfortunate accident which did not concern
them very greatly.</p>

<p>A year went by and the schoolmaster's prophecy was forgotten
among the limbo of other prophecies and rumours, and still the Huns
and barbarians were ravaging the fair fields of France and the busy
cities of Belgium. Sometimes at night they would be awakened by the
angry "gv-v-v" of Zeppelin propellers and the sharp crack of
anti-aircraft guns. A bomb was dropped in a turnip field at
Manningham, barely seven miles away. And still things seemed to get
worse rather than better.</p>

<p>Mr. Gates, the corn-chandler, learnt that his son was killed,
and young Lieutenant Archer, the vicar's only boy, lost both his
legs at the battle of Ypres. The months went slowly by and then
Conscription&mdash;that most un-English, liberty-tampering
invention&mdash;was brought in and more and more of the boys and
men disappeared from the villages and fields. The war indeed had
been in progress for nearly three years when Jim Griggs himself
received a buff slip of paper instructing him to report for a
medical examination.</p>

<p>Jim Griggs was slightly built, but he was wiry and he had
nothing organically wrong. He was passed in Grade I, and after a
brief interval ordered to report for military service.</p>

<p>Not till this final instruction was in his hands did he credit
that such a thing could be. He was forty. He had not given military
matters half an hour's consideration in his life.</p>

<p>"I ain't much of a fightin' man," he said somewhat pathetically
to old Skinner, the wheelwright, as he glanced round his shop. He
was not conscious of any militaristic or vindictive feeling to any
living thing. He had never been like that. Credit must be given to
Jim that his first and dominant thought was for Jenny and the
children. He discovered that a generous Government made provision
for his wife and children during his absence. It was not as much as
Jim Griggs made at bootmaking, but they would be able to subsist
upon it.</p>

<p>And so a day came when Jim went into his little workshop for the
last time. He threw an old canvas sack over his lasts, and wrapped
his tools up in oiled rags. He felt a queer choking sensation as he
looked round the shed, haunted by the ghosts of many happy and
laborious memories, but he thrust the feeling back, for he knew he
had a more difficult farewell to make. He kissed his wife and the
little girls quite cheerily, murmuring:</p>

<p>"1'11 be back all right quite soon, old girl. Be good, Agnes. Be
good, Issy." It was only when he picked the little boy up and
bounced him high above his head that a tear started to his eye as
he said:</p>

<p>"My little Tom! God bless you!"</p>

<p>He brushed the tear quickly away, for it would not do to let his
wife see his weakness. She walked with him to the cross-roads,
where they picked up Mr. Mellows' dog-cart. Mr. Mellows was a
farmer, driving in to Paveney junction to market, and he offered
Jim a lift.</p>

<p>The last he saw of his home life was the figure of his wife
waving to him from the cross-roads, and smiling through her tears.
And so, in similar case to many million others, Jim Griggs went off
to the Great War.</p>

<hr>

<p>Karl Schuch was a bootmaker in a small way at M&mdash;&mdash;, a
suburb of Chemnitz. He was a solemn kind-hearted man, and he adored
his plump wife Luise and his little son Hans, who was now five
years old. His affection for his two daughters, Martha and Cécile,
was only tempered by a mild disappointment that they had been born
girls and not boys, and that Martha was quite clever and carried
off prizes at the Bürgerschule. Apart from the period of his
military training when he had been sent to a garrison town in
Westphalia, Karl Schuch had spent the whole of his life in or near
Chemnitz, and there he had met and married his wife. Once he had
worked for two years in the Chemnitzer Schuhwaaren-Fabrik. It was a
large boot monopoly which catered to foreign markets, particularly
English and American. He had left at the end of that time because
he did not approve of their methods. They were slipshod and there
was too much machinery.</p>

<p>Karl was a sincere and conscientious bootmaker. He adored boots.
He would be quite happy in his little workshop amidst the smell of
hide and paste and he would sing to himself as he pored over his
work. Occasionally he would get up and go to the back, where the
family lived, and call out: "Wife, my clean apron!" or "Wife, when
do we eat to-day?" or "Cécile, bring the lamp from the yard."</p>

<p>Apart from bootcraft he was not a particularly clever man, but
of one thing he was rather proud. At the Chemnitzer
Schuhwaaren-Fabrik he had come in touch with English and American
agents and mechanics, and had picked up a smattering of English. He
would sometimes impress the family with some English phrase, and
the girls boasted at school that their father spoke English like a
native. Karl worked very long hours and very assiduously and even
then he found it difficult to make ends meet, and it would have
been almost impossible if Frau Schuch had not been a very competent
and efficient wife. She made a little go a long way, and not only
managed to do all her own house work, but also laundry work for
some of her better-off neighbours. The family lived in three rooms
at the back of the shop, with the help of an outhouse, where
washing was done. The living-room was a commodious place with a
large stove, some heavy walnut furniture upholstered in horsehair,
many cupboards with oleographs of royal personages swinging on the
doors, a quantity of coloured glass vases, and a photograph of a
tombstone covered with immortelles. The inscription on the
tombstone indicated that it was erected to the memory of Karl
Schuch's mother. The family worked hard all the week. Sunday was a
day of complete relaxation. In the summer evenings Karl and his
wife and one of the girls&mdash;alternately, according to a strict
rule&mdash;would go to a café and listen to the band in the square,
and in the winter would adjourn to the Hofbräuhaus, and there they
would all drink beer and Karl would smoke two cigars. Once a year
they always went to Dresden to the opera. On these occasions an
arrangement was made with a good neighbour to look after little
Hans, so that both the girls should be able to go. They always
stayed the night in Dresden with a married sister of Frau Schuch's,
and so they made up a large party and were very merry and happy.
Karl was a simple likeable fellow. He believed in God in a
half-hearted way, and in his Emperor in a whole-hearted way. He
made boots reverently and might have been more commercially
successful if he had not been quite so conscientious and thorough.
His life satisfied him and he had no great ambitions. One Sunday
night he was sitting at his favourite café, smoking his second
cigar; his wife was sitting next to him knitting, whilst Martha,
looking somewhat stiff and self-conscious in her Sunday clothes,
was gazing vacantly at the passers-by. There was an air of
suppressed excitement about the streets. A somewhat dishevelled
acquaintance came up and whispered something in his ear. Karl
started and his queer eyes protruded from his puffy cheeks. The
acquaintance departed, and Frau Schuch leant forward and said:</p>

<p>"Liebe Karl, what is it?"</p>

<p>Her good man stared solemnly through his thick glasses at the
passing crowd, then he threw his half-finished cigar into the
gutter, and replied:</p>

<p><i>"Kaput!"</i>
</p>

<p>Three days later he was called up to join the 181st Coy. of the
19th Saxon Dragoons. Within a month he had vanished behind the
mists of war somewhere over the Belgian frontier.</p>

<hr>

<p>And so it came about one night soon after the German drive of
March, 1917, had exhausted itself, Jim Griggs found himself out on
patrol duty in some godless swamp, groping and clambering through
the semi-darkness and the moving slush. Experience had already
hardened him to the terror of these things. He had adopted the
soldiers' religion, which is the religion of the Fatalist. Either
they get me or they don't. Either there's a bullet with my number
on or there isn't. Either I get back to Blighty or I go to hell.
Anyway it's no good worrying. At the same time don't be a
&mdash;&mdash; fool. It was a comfortable philosophy, only
qualified by the constant visages
of&mdash;Home-if-anything-should-happen! Jenny, Agnes, Issy and
little Scom. The old shed with the strips of leather and the canvas
sack covering up his tools. The night seemed alive with thousands
of mysterious eyes, all of which could see except his own. Someone
was always watching him from some angle. Something was always
crawling towards him across the mud. Splosh! Curse it, another
shell-hole. He was up to his waist in water. He struggled out and
reached a higher level. The ground here was all broken up into
shell-holes connecting with each other. He groped his way round the
angle of a projection and&mdash;bumped into another man. It was one
of those peculiar positions which have often happened at the front.
Each man realized that the other was an enemy. They were both
confined within a narrow space. Both realized that to fight would
mean certain death for one and probably for two. Neither felt at
all disposed to add to his present misery and discomfort. They
stood there within a few feet of each other silent, but very alert.
Then the German said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, mister, will you have some cigarette?"</p>

<p>And Jim replied:</p>

<p>"O thank you, I don't mind if I do."</p>

<p>The enemy produced a packet of cigarettes, and Jim, in order to
be as affable as possible, added:</p>

<p>"A nasty night! You talk English, then."</p>

<p>At that instant a star shell shot up and dropped right overhead,
and instinctively each man threw himself on the ground. For a few
seconds the unhappy spot they found themselves in was as light as
day. And then an apparently insignificant fact impressed itself on
Jim's mind. When he threw himself down he found his face within a
few inches of the German's boots. Under the glare of the star shell
he had nothing else to look at. The boots had just come through the
water and most of the mud had been washed off, but what impressed
Jim in that passing glimpse was that these were no ordinary boots.
They were certainly not service boots of any nationality. They were
hand-sewn boots, the work of a craftsman. The inevitable screaming
of high-explosive shells followed the disappearance of the light.
In the distance could be heard the steady rat-tat-tat of machine
guns. They both lay still for nearly five minutes. Then they sat up
and Jim said:</p>

<p>"I say, mate, that's a fine pair of boots of yours."</p>

<p>He could see the German grin with pleasure in the dim light as
he replied:</p>

<p>"You like? I make zem myself. I am a bootmaker."</p>

<p>Jim chewed his cigarette, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Go on! That's a funny thing! I'm a bootmaker, too!"</p>

<p>He showed the German his boots which he had made himself, and to
his surprise the enemy produced a pocket electric torch and Jim
found his boots being submitted to an exhaustive examination,
interspersed with grunts of approval. When the examination was
finished the German said:</p>

<p>"Ach! So! They are very beautiful boots!"</p>

<p>In broken sentences they discussed welts and leather and soles
and uppers, and then a silence fell between them. Machine-guns were
still busy in the distance, and rats went scuttling through the
water near their feet. At last Jim said:</p>

<p>"Are you married?"</p>

<p>"Yes. God has blessed me with a good wife and three small
children."</p>

<p>"Go on," replied Jim, as though it were a most surprising
statement. "I've got a wife and three kids too. What's yours? Boys
or girls?"</p>

<p>"I have two girls, Martha and Cécile, of twelve and thirteen
years. And I have little Hans, who makes five years."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a funny thing! My gals, Agnes and Issy, are ten
and eleven, and my young Tom's just three. Look 'ere, lend us your
torch, mate. I'll show you his photograph."</p>

<p>The torch was once more produced, and Tom's plump baby face with
his arms clinging round his mother's neck, and looking rather
scared at the photographer, met with instant approval.</p>

<p>"That's my old girl," Jim added by way of explanation. He also
produced two separate photographs of Agnes and Issy. And then Karl
Schuch unpacked, from beneath voluminous folds within his tunic, a
photograph of a family group. Karl himself was seated in the
centre, with little Hans on his knee. His wife was standing up, but
leaning over the chair with one hand on the boy's shoulder. The two
girls were standing rigidly one on either side. Karl pointed a fat
gloved finger at each member, declaiming solemnly:</p>

<p>"Frau Schuch, Martha, Cécile, little Hans."</p>

<p>Jim nodded sympathetically and repeated:</p>

<p>"Frow Schuch, Martha, Sessiler, little Hans." Then he added,
"Yes, that's very nice."</p>

<p>Karl replaced the photograph and they again relapsed into
silence. After a while Karl sighed. Jim looked across at him
quickly.</p>

<p>"It's all very rum," he thought. The night seemed to grow
darker. The propellers of some bombing plane could be heard very
far away. It occurred to him that this was a very dangerous thing
to do. It was what they called "fraternizing." You could be shot
for fraternizing. Well, anyway, one might be shot at any time or
even&mdash;something worse. What did it matter? They were out in No
Man's Land, but owing to the configuration of the shell holes they
were not observable from either lines, which at this particular
point were about two hundred yards apart. It was the confounded
Verey lights he detested. He produced a packet of Woodbines, and
his new acquaintance acknowledged that they were greatly superior
to the cigarettes he smoked himself. A fine rain began to fall, and
it was yet two hours before the dawn. In the intense loneliness,
surrounded by unknown terrors, Jim felt strangely drawn to this
silent fat man whom he ought to have been killing. He repeated once
more: "Frow Schuch, Martha, Sessiler, and little Hans!" and then he
became silent again. Through the driving masses of thin clouds,
stars would sometimes flicker and disappear as though they were
racing away from a polluted world. After a long interval, Jim
remarked:</p>

<p>"Boys are very cruel."</p>

<p>"Boys?" queried his companion.</p>

<p>"Yes. I don't know what made me think of it. I was just
thinking. I remember when I was at school the boys used to catch
two stag-beetles. You know those big black chaps with horns. Then
they'd draw lots as to who should cut his finger. The boy who lost
would make a little cut on his finger with a pen-knife. Then they'd
smear the blood over the beetles' heads and make 'em fight. It's
funny, but it did. They went for each other and got their horns
mixed up. They usually both got killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>Karl Schuch's knowledge of English did not enable him to follow
this account, but he felt that he was being told some pathetic
story, so he nodded his head sympathetically and murmured:</p>

<p>"Ja wohl! Yes...yes...very sad!"</p>

<p>At the end of another silence, Jim said suddenly:</p>

<p>"I believe that's the rest of my party working their way by them
farm buildings. I guess we'd better split."</p>

<p>The German nodded.</p>

<p>"I thank you for a pleasant time. Will you tell me your name,
bootmaker?"</p>

<p>"Why of course, matey."</p>

<p>And then by the light of the torch these men exchanged cards.
That is to say, Jim tore a corner off a sheet in his pay-book and
wrote his name and address. And Karl tore off the fly-leaf from a
neat diary and inscribed his. They exchanged these and shook
hands.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, old cock and good luck!" said Jim.</p>

<p>"God be with you, bootmaker!" replied the German, and he
stumbled through the rain and became lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>Three days after that Jim's company was almost annihilated. With
eleven others he was sent back to a base to be refitted and
redrafted. Then he was despatched to another part of the line. For
a month he lived almost continuously under fire. Three times he
went over the top. He lived through gas attacks with his mask on.
He bombed dug-outs, and became inured to death and anguish in every
form. But still the bullet with his number on did not find him. He
went for days and nights without food. Water was almost always
obtainable from shell holes when they were not choked with dead or
dying. He learnt some of the tricks of fighting and how to obtain
the best cover in attack. He observed the peculiar and
unaccountable effect of danger on the character of his
fellows&mdash;alternating waves of cowardice and bravery. One day
he found a sergeant who had performed amazing acts of heroism
hiding in a cellar and crying like a child. He slept in the open
with the rain pouring on him, and the angry purr of aeroplanes
overhead. He got to know the various shells before they "arrived,"
and to crack vermin in his shirt, and to cook Maconochie under a
candle end in the rain. And in brief moments of respite he cleaned
his brass buttons, and wrote to his wife a letter which always
commenced:</p>

<p><i>My dear wife, everything all right so far&mdash;</i>
</p>

<p>and always ended:</p>

<p><i>Well there's nothing more at present. My love and kisses to
you all and the girls and little Tom. With love, your loving
husband.</i>
</p>

<p>All these experiences Jim went through and he looked upon them
as "unusual." They did not impress him fundamentally. They had to
be endured, and there it was. Everybody else was doing it. He had
not the type of mind which questioned and analyzed. The only
experience which seemed to touch some questioning chord in his
nature was the experience of meeting a fellow
bootmaker&mdash;albeit an enemy and barbarian&mdash;on that dark
night. He felt in some peculiar way that under happier
circumstances he and the father of Martha, Sessiler and little Hans
might have found much in common, might indeed have been friends. At
odd moments, when not occupied in the primitive purposes of life,
he would gaze into space, and as though repeating a lesson would
mumble:</p>

<p>"Frow Shuck, Martha, Sessiler, and little Hans."</p>

<p>It seemed strange that Mr. Schuch, who knew nothing about him
and who made such excellent boots, and was the father of children
very like his own, should be sent to a foreign country to try and
kill him, Jim Griggs, who bore him no animosity. He did not argue
this query to any logical conclusion, but the sense of it left him
strangely disturbed. Some weeks later he was sent to a part of the
line amongst a lot of tumbled débris which had once been a village.
Here they were heavily attacked. A Saxon division came over in wave
after wave and were badly cut up. The battle lasted for nearly
thirty hours, and in the end the Germans were forced to retire.
Soon after dawn Jim and two others were bringing up supplies of
hand grenades through what was once the village street. It was
littered with dead and reeked of poison gas. His two companions
trailed ahead. By the angle of a wall Jim's eye lighted on the form
of a dead German twisted in a peculiar manner. He went up and
turned him over. It was his friend Karl Schuch of Chemnitz. He was
wounded in the leg and slightly on the head. His gas mask had been
destroyed. He had been probably brought down and then gassed by his
own people. He must have suffered horribly...And then Jim trembled
and an unaccountable feeling of sickness came over him. He had seen
hundreds of dead men during the last few weeks, hundreds of men who
had met that bullet with the right number on, but this seemed
somehow different. In a flash he seemed conscious of the dead man's
personality. He felt in some way responsible. The vision of his
home life, perhaps so much like his own, danced before his eyes.
Frow Schuch! little Hans! Jim knelt on the ground and tears started
to his eyes. For the first time he became a being in revolt.</p>

<p>"It's a damn shame! It's a damn shame!" he kept repeating. He
stroked the dead man's shoulders and his legs, and then a peculiar
impulse came to him. He looked at his boots and quite reverently he
removed them, cross-strung them, and added them to his many other
impedimenta.</p>

<p>He could not exactly account for his action. It was certainly
not with the idea of robbing the dead. He did not know what he
intended to do with the boots. He had no intention of wearing them,
and most assuredly he would not give them away. But they were in
some way a sacred link with a fellow-craftsman. No one else must
desecrate them. He felt that his friend would understand...</p>

<p>As he rose with the boots dangling round his waist, a voice
bawled from amongst some ruins:</p>

<p>"Nah then you there! 'Urry up! What yer 'anging abaht for?"</p>

<hr>

<p>It was three weeks later that Jim's bullet found him. It was a
machine-gun bullet, and it splintered the bone just above the
ankle. It was a very busy time, and men lay in heaps in the field
dressing stations awaiting attention. Someone ran a needle into his
chest and then he was left for twenty-four hours. By the time he
arrived at the operating table the wound had become septic. They
were also short of anaesthetics. They injected cocaine into his
thigh, and his leg was removed from just below the knee. Then he
was sent to a base hospital, where two other operations were found
to be necessary. After the second he developed pneumonia, and his
life hung in the balance for many days. When eventually he was fit
enough to hold a pencil, he wrote to his wife and varied his usual
opening. He commenced:</p>

<p><i>My dear wife, I have been a bit dicky since I last
wrote...</i>
</p>

<p>Also he varied the conclusion:</p>

<p><i>Please God I will be back home soon. Don't let them young
rabbits get into Mr. Mead's turnip field. My love to you all.</i>
</p>

<p>And then at last the great day dawned when he saw the cliffs of
Blighty through the sea mist. Two great days when he hung
impatiently about the bleak buildings of a discharge centre. And a
great night when he hobbled up the High Street of Walldren on
crutches with his wife by his side. And familiar faces came up out
of the mist and said:</p>

<p>"Why, bless me, it's old Jim! How be 'ee, Jim?"</p>

<p>He was all right. There was very little to tell. Thank God the
war was over. He was glad to be back home. How was old so-and-so?
The girls ran out to meet him, and in the cottage little Tom
screamed at first when he beheld his father with something so
peculiar about him, and hid his face in his mother's skirt. But
very quickly he got over this, and his bright eyes glowed as he
lisped an account of how Kitchener, the big black rabbit, had got
out into the road and been nearly run over by a cart. The
sitting-room had not been used while Jim was away and all the
furniture had been covered with newspapers, but on this occasion it
was formally reopened and the brass lamp stood in the centre of the
round table laden with good things. The girls sat up to supper and
Jim listened. They could not get him to talk about the war or of
his experiences. He wanted to hear all about everyone in the
village, and the girls' adventures at the school-treat, and the
troubles there had been about food.</p>

<p>After supper he lighted a candie and went out into the shed.
There was the canvas sack flung across the lasts, the bundles of
oiled tools, strips of leather and old tins and bootlaces,
everything as he had left it. He stood then sometime peering about
contentedly. On the morrow he could continue...everything would be
the same again. It was very wonderful. When his wife and the girls
had retired to bed he sat up some time smoking. The ashes had
fallen in the grate. The lamp made little spluttering noises. It
was extraordinarily quiet and peaceful. His eye wandered round the
room and lighted on the text above the harmonium:</p>

<p>"Christ died to save sinners."</p>

<p>"Yes," he thought quite inconsequently. "I nearly died too."</p>

<p>And he turned out the lamp and went upstairs to bed.</p>

<p>Somehow he could not bring himself to tell his wife about his
adventure with his fellow-bootmaker, nor of the plan which was
developing in his mind. He would not be able to explain it to her
satisfactorily, for indeed he could scarcely explain it to
himself.</p>

<p>If he had said to her, "My dear, I have the idea of making a
pair of boots for Frow Schuch, and also for Martha, Sessiler and
little Hans, she would have said:</p>

<p>"Whatever for, Jim?"</p>

<p>And if he had replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. You see&mdash;who will make boots for them
now? Suppose it had been the other way about?" His wife might have
replied:</p>

<p>"Well, suppose it had been. Would <i>he</i> have made boots for
us?"</p>

<p>This he could have had no possible reply to. In some ways it did
not seem pertinent. It was some peculiar kink in his own nature he
wanted to satisfy. He was dominated by the idea.</p>

<p>In the months that followed Jim was very busy. Everyone seemed
to have left having their boots repaired till he returned.
Nevertheless he found time to carry out his scheme. He had no
measurements to go by, but he knew the ages and he allowed an ample
margin. German people were fat, and the women had large feet. Many
a lady would have been grossly offended at receiving such a gift as
the pair of boots that Jim Griggs made for Frau Schuch. And on a
shelf just above where he worked there always rested a large pair
of field boots, their laces dangling free. Many people asked about
these boots, but Jim was not very communicative. They were just a
pair he had picked up. Farmer Iddles offered him two pounds for
them, but he refused the offer.</p>

<p>And then one day he tied up a very neat and careful package and
stitched it up in canvas. It contained four pairs of excellent
boots made with the best English leather. Very laboriously he
copied out the address, his tongue protruding from his lips as he
wrote:</p>

<p>"Frow Schuch, Pumpernickelstrasse 127, Chemnitz."</p>

<p>He gave no name or address of the sender, but he hobbled over to
Paveney Junction and sent it off himself, for as he thought he
didn't want old Brown at the general shop (which was also the local
post office) talking and asking questions.</p>

<hr>

<p>In a local sorting office not far from Dresden, two tired
officials were wearily carrying out their duties late one evening.
Their names were Salzmann and Bausch. Bausch was calling out the
destination of various parcels to Salzmann, who flung them
carelessly on to a long table divided into receptacles. After a
while Salzmann became conscious that Bausch had been silent for
several minutes, and, moreover, that he was examining and feeling
one package very carefully. He said:</p>

<p>"'What is it, comrade?"</p>

<p>"Boots! by all that's holy!"</p>

<p>Salzmann came slowly over to him and felt the package. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"Where is Quartermaster Zeitz?"</p>

<p>"He has gone to the corner. That pretty girl who squints will be
there..."</p>

<p>"Lend us your knife, comrade."</p>

<p>In less than a minute the canvas was ripped off.</p>

<p>"God in heaven! boots of the very best! Four stout pairs!"
exclaimed Bausch.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes," reiterated Salzmann. "Very, very fine boots, of
the very best leather. Why now, how this pair would fit my little
Walter! and these my two girls. They wore their boots out the year
before last. You're not a married man, lucky Bausch!"</p>

<p>"This big pair I could wear myself," answered Bausch
quietly.</p>

<p>"H'm! So! Well now, we won't quarrel about this, comrade. You
shall have the big pair for yourself and I will have the three
small pairs for my offspring."</p>

<p>"Well...as you say," acquiesced the lazy Bausch.</p>

<p>The two men started to walk gingerly across the room to the
passage where they kept their hats and coats, when suddenly a voice
roared out:</p>

<p>"Now then, you swine! What are you up to?"</p>

<p>"Damn!" muttered Bausch, "the girl who squints wasn't there.
He's drunk."</p>

<p>A fat man with very red cheeks and bristling hair bore down upon
them.</p>

<p>"Ah, you devils!" he bawled; "I've caught you! Stealing again!
Curse you, give me those things."</p>

<p>"The parcel arrived open, quartermaster," wailed Bausch. "We
were going to get some hemp."</p>

<p>"You dirty pigs, you lie!"</p>

<p>The big man grabbed the boots and the canvas and pushed Salzmann
violently over a desk. The small eyes of Salzmann glittered
dangerously. He glowered from behind a pile of sacks.</p>

<p>"That's enough of that," he screamed. "The day for that sort of
thing is over. I'll do you in if you report us. You're a thief
yourself."</p>

<p>Quartermaster Zeitz hurled one of the boots at his head and he
ducked. There was a brief scuffle and Salzmann was flung with
violence to the floor, whilst Bausch managed to strike the
quartermaster on the side of the head. It ended in a storm of
vituperation and threats, and eventually Zeitz retired to the
little office at the end of the room, clutching the boots and the
canvas covering in his hands. Once installed there he thrust the
canvas case into the stove without looking at the address, and he
sat there muttering and talking to himself. Then he gradually began
to consider the boots. They were magnificent boots, made of the
fines English leather. H'm, well, so! Zeitz had no children of his
own, and the large pair were not big enough for him. But, perhaps
they'd do who Lena, the girl who had failed to keep her
appointment. In any case, boot were&mdash;boots. On his way out he
said:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I lost my temper, comrades. I've been a bit
overwrought, worried by the war. Please forget all about it. Go and
buy yourselves some refreshments on your way home."</p>

<p>And he put down five marks on the corner of the table. But in
the early morning tramcar Zeitz went sound asleep, and the parcel
of boots was stolen by an individual named Straesemann, who earned
his living by stealing parcels and acting as a medium for shady
transactions. And Straesemann sold the boots to a dealer in Dresden
for two hundred marks, and on the proceeds drank himself into an
inebriates' home.</p>

<hr>

<p>In that mood which is neither dreamland nor reality Jim Griggs
was lying in his bed. It was just dawn and some sparrows were
already twittering outside the cottage window. And there came to
him a consciousness of something pleasant and pervadingly tranquil.
He had not yet focused any definite vision of the day or of his own
place in it, but he knew that it held some secret that was
peculiarly his own, something that even his wife did not share. It
was as though he had suddenly discovered that a thing of clay had
become a jewel possessing rare and uplifting qualities. It stilled
some clamorous instinct. It satisfied and enthralled him and became
more and more a thing of beauty, because it was always to be found
there in his heart. He might lose it for a time, he might not know
of its presence, but it would always come back to him, and no one
had the power to take it from him. Neither did it concern
covenants, nor indeed the bare attainment of success or failure. It
was something much bigger than that, because it called unto the
deep. It was more endurable than that, because it stretched out
through the darkness and was already conscious of the dawn, which
it desired so intensely...</p>

<p>Jim sighed and awakened to the world. He blinked at the light
and turning on his side he thought:</p>

<p>"I'll just have another forty winks. Then I must go and feed
them young rabbits."</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>17. Madame Fatality</h2>

<p>The inconsistencies of human nature&mdash;especially female
human nature&mdash;were a constant theme for discussion on the part
of Jean François Jacquemin. Now there was Marcelle. What did that
jagged scar on his own left jaw denote? Was it not eternal evidence
that he had fought for her and won? Was she not his woman? Had he
not even pandered to her feminine whimsy by going through a form of
marriage with her? Had he not for the last eight years kept her in
comparative comfort and even luxury? And was she satisfied?...Bah!
women were unreadable.</p>

<p>It is true that he was considerably older than she&mdash;for he
was fifty-three. But he still preserved a good deal of the vigour
of youth. His brain was still cool, his nerve steady, his eye
co-ordinating with the supple movement of muscles, almost as
efficiently as on the day when he had fought with the long-armed
Barouzel one early morning nine years ago in a disused brickfield
out beyond Charenton. It had been a pretty fight, both men stripped
to the waist, and armed with short knives of equal length. Each man
had three supporters, Barouzel's being members of a gang of which
he was the chief. There had also been present Marcelle and a lady
called "The Mountain of the Moon," a large flabby person. All
present knew what the fight was about, and it was conducted with
that precise regard for conformity which you may only find amongst
people who are a conscious unit in an inimical body. The fight had
lasted seven minutes. Jacquemin had lost the top of a thumb, and
had received a gash in the side and in the jaw. He had been
apparently a beaten man. The arms of Barouzel were too long for
him. And then, during a brief pause, his eye had alighted on
Marcelle. Her face was pale, and the eyes distended, the lips drawn
tightly over her small white teeth. Her expression gave no
indication of preference or prejudice. It was the ice-cold image of
detached judgment, cruel but terribly beautiful. Somehow or other
it nerved him to a supreme effort. He was no longer Jean François
Jacquemin. He was an atom in a chain of fatality, laughing
defiantly at death. He threw back his head and laughed and his
opponent rushed into administer the <i>coup de grâce.</i> Jacquemin
ducked and fell, and as he fell he lunged upward. The knife grazed
the wall of Barouzel's heart.</p>

<p>They buried him under a pile of bricks and nettles. The secret
of the battle had been honourably preserved. Barouzel's friends
were probably not on too good terms with the gendarmerie at that
time, and in any case there was no useful purpose to be served by
informing. Jacquemin had taken the girl away with him and married
her. She was enchanting, adorable, and baffling. He knew no more
about her now than he did on the day of the fight. Her moods varied
like April winds. She was passionate, gentle, sullen, cold, loving,
jealous and untameable. And always about her there was to Jean
François this sense of fatality. Fatality is perhaps the most
difficult of all things to understand. Many a time he would have
given anything to be rid of her, but always he came back to her
like a dog conscious of misbehaviour. She was the only thing he
feared, she and her sense of fate.</p>

<p>Soon after their marriage a clumsy little affair out at Neuilly,
where a fool of a colleague had awakened a household through
stepping through a skylight, had led to Jean François being put
under lock and key for two years. When he came out Marcelle was
waiting for him. He knew she would be. But she expressed no delight
or surprise at seeing him, neither did he ever discover how she had
managed to live during those two years, and he thought of
himself:</p>

<p>"When the time comes she will kill me as one does an old and
useless dog." This idea became an obsession, and as he got older he
would mumble about it to himself, retaining no animosity against
the woman herself, but simply regarding her as an instrument of
fate. He would talk about her detachedly as Madame Fatality.
Returning at night with the spoils of some dubious enterprise he
would mutter: "Well, now, my old cabbage, what will Madame Fatality
have to say about this? what will she demand, eh?"</p>

<p>But the strangest thing of all was her jealousy. Why should she
be jealous of him, a battered old crock of fifty-three. If he had
been jealous of her it might have been reasonable. She was young
and beautiful. But he! he had never even been much of a lady's man,
and now&mdash;well, Marcelle satisfied him. He had no designs about
other women, but should he so much as glance at one, he would see
that uncanny glitter creep into the back of his wife's eyes. There
was the absurd case of the widow Sélonier, who kept a little
brasserie over in the Marais. On occasions jean François had been
there for refreshment, for Madame Sélonier kept the things he
loved. There was an inviting bar at which one could sit up on a
high stool and regale oneself with sardines, olives, anchovies and
beer. It was his favourite kind of meal. And on two occasions
Marcelle had discovered him there passing the time of day with
Madame Sélonier. Her suspicions were aroused, and quickly fanned
the flames of an unreasonable jealousy. It was quite useless for
him to protest that it was Madame SéIonier's anchovies that
attracted him, and not her person. She simply did not believe it.
And Jean, his ears smarting with the burning accusations of his
wife, went along the street murmuring:</p>

<p>"There it is. I am a vile wanton. Madame Fatality says so."</p>

<p>Although meekly accepting this verdict, the incident about
Madame Sélonier and the anchovies rankled. Jean François always
prided himself upon his own gentlemanly behaviour. Among his
associates he moved like a prince. He sprang from some dubious
stock in which the gentleman was evident. During his career he had
been a clerk, a tramp, a sergeant in an infantry regiment, a cook,
a skilled decorator, a forger, a dealer in stolen property, a
housebreaker, a pick-pocket, a general agent, and at one time
nearly the mayor of a small town in Scouraine. All these
enterprises he conducted with a certain flair. He had killed two
men in open combat, and broken the faces of others, but he had
never murdered for money, or been a blackmailer or a seducer. He
dressed well, kept himself clean and his table manners were
irreproachable. This was one of the chief points of divergence
between himself and the woman who seemed to hold his destiny in the
hollow of her hands. Marcelle's table manners were abominable. She
made noises eating her soup, she put her knife in her mouth, picked
up her bones, and sometimes behaved as though knives and forks had
never been invented. For this reason Jean François frequently made
excuses to lunch or dine out by himself, and he would pass in any
restaurant as a thoroughly respectable citizen of the better class.
And then dining alone his thoughts would revert inexorably to
Marcelle. He could hardly finish his meal. He would push away the
dish of artichokes, and his hand would fumble in his breast pocket
for some trinket or jewel.</p>

<p>"Madame Fatality is calling me," he would think. And his mind
would register the queer reflection that her call upon him was more
potent when she was absent than when she was present. The very
uncertainty of his reception acted as a kind of magnet. When he
returned and thrust the trinket upon her, she might throw her arms
round him and kiss him passionately, or she might accept it
sullenly, or she might be entirely preoccupied, or perhaps immersed
in some trivial diversion that appeared to her a matter of enormous
consequence. It was as though he were regarding both the trinket
and himself as entirely passive properties in a drama being
performed by others.</p>

<p>As the years advanced stronger and stronger became this
hold.</p>

<p>One dull February morning when they had been married nine years,
Jean François sat up in bed and envisaged his day's programme. It
was to be a momentous twenty-four hours. By this time to-morrow he
might be either dead, in prison, or a rich man. He watched Marcelle
gliding about the little apartment in a blue and purple kimono. It
suited the pallor of her face and the dark swathes of her hair. She
was in one of her ice-cold moods. He watched her deftly stirring
the coffee and he thought:</p>

<p>"What is Madame Fatality preparing for me today?"</p>

<p>They had not drunk their coffee before they were interrupted by
the visit of a gentleman named Sennescheim. He was a thin
melancholy individual, carrying a large black valise. He merely
said: "I've got it, papa," and put the valise down on the bed and
opened it. Jean François examined the contents, and Marcelle
hovered disinterestedly in the background. The bag contained a few
silver plates and cups, a silver and tortoiseshell box, some
miniatures, two travelling clocks and a dozen silk scarves.</p>

<p>"A poor haul!" commented Jean François.</p>

<p>The elder man sighed. "Verdelot is a fool," he said. "Always in
too great a hurry. I believe there was money in the escritoire.
There were some carved ivories too&mdash;Chinese&mdash;any one of
them would have been worth this lot put together. What about it,
Papa?"</p>

<p>"I'll take them to Janicot if you like. He won't pay more than
about two hundred though."</p>

<p>"If any one can make the old devil stump up you can."</p>

<p>"Why not try Cohn?"</p>

<p>"No, no, he's watched. There was very nearly trouble over that
Nebecourt affair last week."</p>

<p>"Very well. Leave it to me. What about to-night?"</p>

<p>"Everything's in order. This is an early affair, you know, while
the family is at dinner. The old man and his wife and daughter are
dining alone at six-thirty. Jules has got a job as a handy man
around the stables and garden. He will let you in the back way.
There's no one else in the house except the butler, who will be
waiting, and his wife who will be cooking. The housemaid's away on
a holiday. The stairway at the back leads up to the first floor,
which is connected by a passage with the two principal bedrooms. In
the left-hand drawer of the dressing-table in the daughter's
room&mdash;the second door on the left when you come on to the
landing&mdash;is a case containing a pearl necklace, which her
fiancé has just given her. There's nothing else of any value. In
the old people's room&mdash;the first door&mdash;is a miniature
buhl cabinet, locked. It's got all the old lady's
jewellery&mdash;many thousand francs worth. If you can't open it
you can bring the whole thing away. This'll have to be a quick job.
At the bottom of the wardrobe on the right is a cash box. It'll
contain all his takings for the week. He banks to-morrow. I should
leave it at that, Papa. It'll be a good quick haul, and in these
daylight affairs you've always got to allow for the
unexpected."</p>

<p>Jean François stretched himself and drank the remainder of the
coffee at a gulp. Marcelle came forward and picked up the silk
scarves.</p>

<p>"I should like these," she said.</p>

<p>"She would like to have these," repeated her husband.</p>

<p>"They are worth money," Monsieur Sennescheim murmured
protestingly.</p>

<p>"It can be arranged."</p>

<p>The elder man shrugged his shoulders and departed.</p>

<p>The disposal of this small collection of stolen property was not
the only item in the agenda of Jean's programme, and directly his
visitor had departed, he arose and began to perform a rather
elaborate toilette. He washed, and shaved, and combed his grey
locks back with considerable brio. He donned an enormous black
stock, a lounge suit, and a flowing cape. With his felt hat at a
jaunty angle and his long ebony cane&mdash;which was incidentally a
sword-stick&mdash;he might have passed as an old actor from the
Odéon, going for a stroll between rehearsals. When ready he
said:</p>

<p>"My angel, I cannot say what time I shall be back. I have much
work to do to-day. But listen, my little white lily, if all goes
well&mdash;to-morrow, you and I, I think a little holiday might do
us good. The air of Paris is not too healthy at times. A little
jaunt South&mdash;perhaps over the border to Bordighera or Rapallo
might be well. What do you say?"</p>

<p>Marcelle was trying the scarves upon her head and looking at
herself in the mirror. She made no answer. Jean François added:</p>

<p>"If I were you, my dear, I would be careful not to wear those
scarves in public&mdash;just yet."</p>

<p>His route lay through the Luxembourg gardens, through which he
strolled nonchalantly, swinging the cane with one hand, and
carrying the black valise with the other. The air was raw but
stimulating, and charged with familiar odours. Crowds of children
and their nursemaids occupied the paths. His crafty eyes mellowed
at the sight of chubby babies, burbling in their prams. Certain
thoughts and reflections he thrust back.</p>

<p>"We all begin like that...if only Madame Fatality..."</p>

<p>The good Janicot received him indifferently. He was not
impressed with the goods, and went to considerable pains to profess
even greater indifference than he possessed.</p>

<p>The deal took the best part of an hour, but eventually Jean
François emerged from a murky passage with a small wad of notes
added to his wallet.</p>

<p>For his next engagement he found it necessary to take a
circuitous trip on the Métro to the Pont de Flandre. From there he
had to walk for nearly twenty minutes through congested mean
streets, till he came to a narrow cul-de-sac facing a canal. He
entered a house at the end and after making mysterious taps on an
inner door was admitted to a room on the ground floor. A man with
an extremely yellow face called into the darkness:</p>

<p>"It's all right. It's Uncle Jacquemin."</p>

<p>A thick-set man, with close-cropped hair, and the wickedest eyes
that ever challenged the light of day, came forward and said:</p>

<p>"Ah! my old blunderbuss. You arrive opportunely. It's not going
well."</p>

<p>He led the way to the back, where a trap-door revealed a spiral
staircase leading to the basement. The basement was lighted by two
powerful acetylene lamps. It had the appearance of a chemical
laboratory. The thick-set man walked over to a press and picked up
a pile of five-franc notes.</p>

<p>"Look," he said. "You couldn't pass them on a blind nag."</p>

<p>Jean François picked up the notes and examined them through a
magnifying glass. Then he shook his head and said:</p>

<p>"Let's look at the plates."</p>

<p>He knew something about the process, but it was subtle and
complicated. The thick-set man and his companion of the yellow face
were dispirited and querulous. He made many suggestions, and the
thickset man kept repeating:</p>

<p>"Yes, but this all takes time, time and money. How are we going
on? It means having others in. The more in the greater the risk.
Haven't you more money, Uncle Jacquemin?"</p>

<p>He felt himself getting dispirited too, and a little bewildered
and tired. This plant had cost him thousands of francs. Perhaps in
the end it would fail&mdash;He found himself muttering
savagely:</p>

<p>"Perhaps Matame Fatality is opposed to the idea. You can't, you
know...go against her."</p>

<p>"What's that?" exclaimed the thick-set man.</p>

<p>"Who? Madame Who?" barked the yellow man.</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, I don't know. What did I say? Listen, Martin, it's the
paper that's wrong."</p>

<p>The two men looked at him and then at each other suspiciously.
The discussion went on in a desultory manner. All the parties
concerned seemed more anxious about immediate ways and means than
in the successful achievement of their purpose. They all knew that
the thing was a failure, and wanted to escape with least disaster
to themselves.</p>

<p>To the other two men it meant disappointment and the threat of a
material predicament. But in Jean François it produced the added
menace of a portent, like ice-cold hands encircling him in a narrow
room. He produced the notes which he had just received from Janicot
and threw them on the table.</p>

<p>"Courage, my brave fellows," he exclaimed unconvincingly, "a
little more persistence and a mighty fortune is within our
grasp."</p>

<p>His attitude and the gift of the notes was a gesture of defence,
or rather of defiance, not against his two accomplices, but against
fate. He was glad to escape into the air. The raw light of day
steadied him.</p>

<p>"That is finished," he muttered. "Let them be caught there like
rats down a drain."</p>

<p>He wandered back in the direction of the Marais. Little
midinettes darting hither and thither, with long rolls under their
arms, reminded him that it was the hour to feed. He found himself
at the corner of the street where Madame Sélonier had her
delightful brasserie. Defiantly he directed his footsteps thither.
"It's perfectly absurd," he thought. "Madame Fatality must be shown
her own business."</p>

<p>He entered the brasserie and bowed elaborately to the
proprietress. Seated at his high stool and helping himself to the
delicious anchovies and hard-boiled eggs, he quickly forgot about
Madame Fatality. He talked to Madame Sélonier about the political
situation, about the frocks in the new revue at the Casino de
Paris, and about the right way to make a cheese soufflé. She was a
plump, middle-aged, rather attractive woman, but Jean François
hardly thought about her as a woman. She was just a pleasant
companion who served most excellent food and light wine. He was in
the brasserie less than half an hour. He then paid his reckoning
and departed. Twenty yards down the street he ran into
Marcelle!</p>

<p>Her keen eyes challenged him.</p>

<p>"Where have you just come from?"</p>

<p>Jean François did a thing he had not done for many a day. He
blushed. He gulped. His tongue seemed to fill his entire mouth. At
last he managed to splutter:</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, I have just&mdash;I was just coming&mdash;over from the
Pont de Flandre&mdash;my friends there&mdash;we are very much
engaged, you know. I'm sorry, my dear&mdash;I cannot escort
you&mdash;very urgent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You haven't had your déjeuner, I suppose."</p>

<p>"No, no, no, far too pressed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well. You can take me. I haven't lunched yet either."</p>

<p>So Jean François was enforced to lunch twice. He took her to
another little restaurant round the corner. Whilst making a parade
of eating he watched her obliquely, as a rabbit might watch a
rattlesnake. Enchanting and bewitching creature...if only she
wouldn't pick up bones and clean up her plate with bread, smack her
lips and pick her teeth with her fingers. Strange and
unaccountable...human attractions...fate. Why did he fear her? Why
couldn't he tell her the truth? Why did she make him such a
coward?</p>

<p>The second lunch over, he hurried away and left her. He had
urgent business to attend to on the other side of the river. In an
untidy street in Chavalaret he entered a shop which bore above the
window the inscription: P. Brimont. It appeared to be a kind of
neglected pharmacie, devoted mostly to photographs, postcards, and
light literature. A bell clanged crazily as he entered and a thin
young man said:</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, sir, you'll find the guv'nor upstairs. He is
expecting you."</p>

<p>He mounted three flights and entered a room occupied by four
men. Monsieur Brimont came forward and shook hands. He was a little
old man, with a very long nose, the tip of which seemed to almost
overlap his lower lip. He exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ah! Jacquemin, welcome! I have here the three promising young
birds. Gentlemen, this is Professor Jacquemin himself, who can
teach you more in an hour than I can in a week."</p>

<p>And for the next two hours Professor Jacquemin was very busy. He
instructed the three promising young gentlemen in various gentle
crafts. How, for instance, to remove a pocket-book or a watch and
chain in a crowd. How to brush against a stranger and perform the
same operation. How to snatch a woman's chatelaine, or remove her
purse from it. How to do thimble-rigging and the confidence
trick&mdash;altogether a thoroughly educational afternoon.</p>

<p>When it was over and the three young gentlemen had departed,
Monsieur Brimont took him on one side and said:</p>

<p>"Look here, old comrade, will you execute a commission for me?
You know Denise Vallé of the Folies Bergéres? Eh, well, I promised
her a packet of 'snow' this evening. The poor child is desperate.
Will you deliver it for me? People know I'm a pharmacist and they
don't like me hanging about an actress's flat. But with you, a
gentleman of independent means and an irreproachable character, it
doesn't matter at all. I'll give you her address. And listen, she
will give you two hundred francs. Don't let her have the stuff
until she has paid. By the way, I owe you one hundred and seventy,
commission on that Besnard case, so you can let me have the odd
thirty to-morrow."</p>

<p>"It's all in the day's work," responded Jean François, rather
fatuously. He was conscious of not being at his best. The printing
press had failed. He had been clumsy in his demonstrations to the
young men. Madame Fatality seemed likely to meet him at every turn.
Why should he give cocaine to a neurotic actress? And yet, after
all, if she was neurotic she couldn't do without the stuff. It was
fate. But why encourage these young men to lead the kind of life he
had led? Well, if he didn't, someone else would. He had only to
look at their faces to see that Nature had predestined them for a
life of crime. "It's all in the day's work."</p>

<p>He found Denise Vallé in a smart little flat in Etoile. She was
in a terrible state of agitation and distress. She thought Monsieur
Brimont had forgotten her. And how was she to appear to-night in
her new show at the Folies Bergéres without her beloved "snow"?
And, oh! of course, she had no money, only a very little,
twenty-five francs perhaps. Monsieur Brimont would surely trust
her. Jean François ended by letting her off paying altogether. He
was obsessed with a sudden misgiving. If Marcelle was suspicious of
him visiting Madame Sélonier, what would she think if she saw him
coming away from the flat of this notorious woman!</p>

<p>"That's all right. That's all right, mademoiselle, not distress
yourself."</p>

<p>He was almost surprised, when he got outside, to find she was
not there. He sighed drearily and set off in the direction of the
scene of his next and most desperate venture.</p>

<p>To this end he was obliged to take a train to Fontainebleau, for
the villa that he proposed to rob was in the forest. It was dusk
when he alighted at the little station of Fontainebleau-Avon. He
walked across to a café and sipped a cognac whilst waiting for the
moment of his appointment. He went carefully over all the details
of the directions and information given him by his accomplice.
Among them he was known as "the man with no nerves." But on this
night he felt strangely unwrought. He kept on trying to persuade
himself that nothing could go wrong. He conjured up a vision of the
complete success of his enterprise. It was such a simple case. But
always before his mind's eye came the image of Madame Fatality
spreading the network of her strange charms. He would never, never
understand her. Contrary to his usual custom he had another cognac
and then set out to walk briskly up the hill. At six-forty
precisely he rang the bell of the stables adjoining the villa.
Jules admitted him, and put his fingers to his lips.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Uncle," he whispered. "But wait awhile. They
have only just gone in. Wait till the sherry has passed and the
fish is served. Have you your rubber shoes?"</p>

<p>"Does an artist approach his easel without his paints and
brushes?" he replied showily, seating himself on a chair and
quietly removing his boots.</p>

<p>"The first staircase down the passage leads up to the quarters
where the chauffeur lives; he's away, you know. You go right
through two rooms on to another passage. You then take two sharp
turnings to the right and you are on the first floor of the villa.
The first door on the left is the old people's, the second is the
girl's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know all that. Hurry up and see how they are getting on."</p>

<p>It was ten minutes before Jules announced that the sherry had
passed and the fish was being served, then he set forth. Jean
François had always prided himself iii being a thoroughly efficient
burglar. He was swift in his movements; silent and deliberate. He
had, moreover, a quite peculiar sense of topography. Almost
automatically he seemed to sense just where things were and the
best and quickest way of arriving at his object. In spite of his
inward trepidation he never perhaps gave a more highly finished
demonstration of his technical skill than on this occasion when he
burgled the villa of Monsieur and Madame Lacau St. Just. Within
less than seven minutes from the time he had left his accomplice he
had found his way noiselessly to the daughter's room, extracted the
pearl necklace, entered the room of the old couple, stuffed the
cash-box and the miniature buhl cabinet into his bag, and commenced
to return.</p>

<p>But there is in the natural development of human affairs always
that elusive element which some call chance and others call fate.
Life might be safer without it, but it would assuredly be duller.
The tragic climacteric which suddenly came upon Jean François was
the direct outcome of an entirely fortuitous circumstance, of which
Monsieur Lacau St. Just himself was sponsor. The fish had hardly
appeared before the old gentleman said:</p>

<p>"Dear, oh dear! I have not taken my medicine. Henri, when you've
served the fish, will you fetch my little bottle of capsules. I
think I left it with my pipe in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>Now Henri was a portly person and very slow in his movements. He
was away some minutes and only returned to say that he could not
find Monsieur's bottle of capsules.</p>

<p>Then Madame Lacau St. Just interjected:</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, isn't it on the table in the dressing-room? I
think I saw it there this morning. Don't you remember you took some
after petit déjeuner. You didn't have any after lunch."</p>

<p>Such an unnecessary twist of fate...if the capsules had only
been with the pipe the lives of two people would not have been
suddenly enveloped under the dark mantle of tragedy. Jean François
was at the bedroom door with the bag in his hand. He was about to
reach out to the switch when he caught sight of the bald head of
the fat butler appearing above the stairs. He darted behind the
door and crouched down. During those few seconds whilst listening
to the sounds of pulmonary disorder getting nearer the room, a
hundred thoughts and reflections raced through his brain. If he was
caught&mdash;he was an old offender&mdash;he would probably get
seven years. He was now fifty-three. He would be sixty when he came
out. What was the good of anything at sixty? What would happen to
Madame Fatality? He wouldn't be caught. If the butler saw him he
would cry out. He <i>mustn't</i> cry out. That was the first thing;
the butler must be prevented from crying out. But he mustn't kill
him or make any noise. Could he cope with the whole household? Was
the old man armed? Could he rely on Jules?...No, he felt
intuitively that he could not rely on Jules. The man was a sneak
and a coward. The butler mustn't cry out...He saw his whole life in
an abrupt perspective. It was going to focus on one fierce instant.
He would fight for his life...The butler must be silenced...the
first thing...</p>

<p>He let him pass the door and advance two paces into the room,
then he swept at him like a whirlwind, his hands to the other's
throat, and flung him on to the bed. It was skilfully done. But as
they rolled over the butler brought his knee sharply up into the
assailant's stomach and winded him. The butler was fat, puffy and
out of condition, but he was a comparatively strong man. He was
trying to cry out, but the hands of Jean François were glued to his
throat. He hit and kicked wildly, and the struggle was by no means
unequal. Jean François felt sick from the stomach blow he had
received. The affair must be short and sharp. He would not be able
to keep this up long. Once he slipped off the edge of the bed, and
found himself falling. His hands lost their grasp. The other man
was spluttering. In a second he would call out. It was Jean
François on one side, his life, himself, his very existence opposed
to a world that wished to destroy him. He flung himself back and
gripped that throat again with his left hand, whilst the other
dashed at his hip pocket...In another two seconds the butler was
lying there inert, with a knife driven into his heart, the same
knife that had killed the long-armed Barouzel.</p>

<p>Not a sound came from downstairs. The episode had not lasted
more than three minutes. He flung the eiderdown over the body,
picked up his bag, turned off the light, shut the door, locked it,
and put the key in his pocket, and then returned the way he had
come. He was quite master of himself when he met Jules in the
little room off the stables.</p>

<p>"Well?" huskily whispered his confederate.</p>

<p>"All well. Meet me at Sonnescheim's on Sunday."</p>

<p>"You found everything? No difficulties?"</p>

<p>"No, no, pass me those boots, quick!"</p>

<p>"You're a wonder, Uncle."</p>

<p>The younger man sniffed, and nervously gnawed at his right
thumb-nail, and added:</p>

<p>"It's all right for you. You get back to Paris. I have to stay
on here. I shall have to go through it all right. Cross-questions,
examination. Give me a hundred to go on with, Uncle."</p>

<p>In sickening anxiety to be rid of the whole thing. Jean François
gave the young man fifty francs, and slipped quietly out. The
evening was dark and he hurried in the direction of the station.
Like a fool he had not looked up the times of the trains. If he had
to wait long it would be too dangerous. He would have to find some
other means of getting back. They could, however, hardly get an
alarm out in less than an hour.</p>

<p>He took a ticket and sat in a dark corner of the station. He did
not like to ask, as he did not want to run the risk of some
official remembering his face. There were quite a good few people
waiting, and he heard someone say: "The train is late."</p>

<p>In less than a quarter of an hour it came thundering
in&mdash;the Paris train. He entered feverishly, took his seat, and
closed his eyes. A horn sounded and the train moved out.</p>

<p>As he listened to the thundering of the train racing over the
metals he realised for the first time that he was saved. Up to that
point he had been acting in a kind of dream. He did not dare let
himself think. He stretched himself luxuriously. He tingled with
the sense of satisfactory accomplishment. He had murdered a
man&mdash;quite unwillingly, certainly&mdash;and he had escaped. It
could never be proved against him.</p>

<p>No one had seen him at Fontainebleau except Jules. It wouldn't
help Jules to inform against him. Even if he did, it was only one
man's word against another, and he had many friends in Paris who
would be delighted to swear on oath that at the moment of the crime
Jean François Jacquemin was playing "faro" with them. The whole
thing had been entirely successful, and his bag contained the
spoils that would keep him in material necessities and even
luxuries for many days to come.</p>

<p>To-morrow he would leave for the south, calling at Lyons on the
way. He knew of an admirable person in Lyons who would pay a good
price for the goods. He would take Madame Fatality with him and
they would go on to Italy...Madame Fatality! Why, amidst the
glowing fires that stirred within him in thinking of her, did there
creep the quenching element of dread? Where was she? What was she
doing? How would she receive him? He dozed and dreamed in the
corner of the carriage. The train would be back in Paris soon after
eight. He would drive out and fetch her and they would dine alone
at some quiet café. Yes, and on the morrow he would buy her an
emerald trinket to wear in her dark hair. She loved to decorate her
hair, and to stand and regard her image in the mirror as though
mesmerized by the apparition.</p>

<p>As the train ran into the Gare de Lyon he shivered. The night
seemed strangely cold. He was tired out and hungry. He must have
food and drink. He could not face Madame Fatality in his present
state. He went to the station buffet and drank two glasses of Amer
Picon. His tired senses responded greedily to this intriguing
stimulant. His fears dissipated. He was proud of his success, his
skill, his cool judgment, his virile assertion of personality. Life
was a battle. The weak went under; the strong prevailed. He had
faced death several times, and he was not going to be terrorized
by&mdash;his wife. No, no, never had he been afraid, he, "the man
with no nerves." Nevertheless, he thought he would dine alone. He
was happy with his present thoughts, his present self-centred mood.
He wanted no other society. In the obscure restaurant off the Rue
de Bercy, where he dined, he called loudly for a large bottle of
Château Laffitte, which he drank in great gulps. It was late and
the customers were slowly dwindling away. He felt the few remaining
regarding him with interest&mdash;wondering who this
distinguished-looking elderly actor might be. How splendid it would
be to stand up and say: "Yes, my dear friends, you do indeed behold
the great Jacquemin. Under this table I have the spoils of a most
distinguished burglary. But an hour ago I murdered a fat butler. I
am I."</p>

<p>He grinned sardonically into the ruby glass. The wine was going
to his head. He saw himself, as it were, from a distance, dining
majestically, behaving with exquisite decorum. What a pity it was
that Madame Fatality had such atrocious table manners. Soup, fish,
artichokes, pig's feet, salade, kidneys, Gruyère&mdash;he did
himself well. Had he not fought for it and earned it?</p>

<p>"Waiter, coffee and a fine champagne."</p>

<p>He lighted a cigarette, and leant back luxuriously. A stout,
red-faced man entered and took a seat opposite him. He was a
coarse, bourgeois bellicose-looking individual. He tucked his
napkin into his collar and greedily examined the menu. He produced
in Jean François a sudden feeling of loathing and disgust. Probably
a thoroughly sound respectable citizen&mdash;manager of a hat shop,
or a purveyor of canned meat. But, God in Heaven! what a pig!</p>

<p>He ordered hors d'oeuvres, and when the dish with all its little
divisions was set in front of him, he rolled his tongue
horizontally at great speed between his fat sensual lips. His small
eyes narrowed. He had already eaten half the dish in greedy
anticipations. He jabbed the fork discriminately into the
anchovies, herrings and olives. He gobbled them up, blowing the
stones of the olives wildly on to his plate. He shoved slices of
tomato into a mouth displaying half masticated portions of fish. He
snorted and wheezed, and shook with gastronomic excitement. He was
horrible. He was unbearable. Jean François leant forward and
said:</p>

<p>"Really! Really!"</p>

<p>The red-faced man looked up savagely.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Try and behave like a gentleman."</p>

<p>"What the devil! Who the devil!"</p>

<p>"It makes me feel sick to watch you eat."</p>

<p>And then, of course, the mad thing happened. Without a word the
fiery gentleman picked up the dish of hors d'oeuvres and flung the
lot in the face of Jean François. The latter's hand instinctively
dived towards his hip pocket. A woman on the other side of the room
screamed. A waiter ran forward, followed by the manager. The
red-faced gentleman stood up, ready for the battle. The waiter was
calling out:</p>

<p>"Please, gentlemen! Please, gentlemen!"</p>

<p>The manager, who had turned as white as a sheet, stood at the
table.</p>

<p>"What is this?"</p>

<p>Jean François wrenched himself back into a condition of
normality. He stood up and bowed.</p>

<p>"The gentleman was quite justified. I insulted him. I apologise
profoundly. I am tired. Forgive me. Please let me have my
bill."</p>

<p>No one spoke. The red-faced man sat down, glaring.</p>

<p>The waiter presented the bill, Jean François paid, tipped the
waiter lavishly, put on his hat, picked up his bag and bowed
again.</p>

<p>They followed him out without another word being spoken. He
called a cab and drove out to Montparnasse.</p>

<p>Nothing else seemed real. He entered the flat and saw Marcelle
standing by the fireplace in exactly the position he knew she would
be. The pallor of her face emphasized the brilliance of her dark
searching eyes and jet-black hair. She was wearing a black velvet
frock, and on the right side of her hair was a dark red rose.</p>

<p>He flung down his bag and cried out desperately: "There it is,
my little white lily...all for you. All for you."</p>

<p>Her eyes narrowed and searched him through and through. He
seemed to live an eternity whilst she was reading his soul,
determining his fate. What the devil was she thinking? He heard her
say: "To-morrow," and then repeat the word again and again. Well,
what about to-morrow?</p>

<p>She glided towards him and a mocking finger pointed at his
chest. He looked down and beheld the flaccid emblem of his doom.
Dangling between the folds of his waistcoat was the flabby remnant
of&mdash;an anchovy!</p>

<p>His heart was beating so rapidly that he was bound to grope for
a chair. How could he explain? Was she likely to believe his story
about the red-faced man? Was not Madame Sélonier the only person in
Paris who dispensed anchovies? Can one argue against fate? He sat
there watching her...waiting.</p>

<p>She seemed suddenly active, very occupied. She moved about the
room. Then she stood before him holding a hat in her hand, and from
it she drew a long steel hat-pin.</p>

<p>"Now she is going to kill me," thought he. "Well, well, it was
bound to come."</p>

<p>He felt strangely indifferent. It seemed a matter for reflection
rather than action.</p>

<p>"One builds and one builds. Everything is anticipated, every
craft acquired, every technical accomplishment perfected, and then
in the end one is destroyed&mdash;by an anchovy."</p>

<p>But she was saying terrible things to him, accusations,
recriminations; she was giving a calm, relentless statement of the
record of his life, a vivid analysis of the workings of his soul.
And he heard it and he knew it to be true, and yet it did not move
him very profoundly. It only moved him in as far as it affected
her. What was she going to do? Why didn't she kill him and be done
with it?</p>

<p>And then whilst wondering he heard a door slam, and the rain
beating on the skylight. He knew then that she had gone. He rushed
into the passage and called out:</p>

<p>"Marcelle!...Marcelle! Come back, come back!"</p>

<p>And all night long he sat there looking down at his long, thin
hands...those hands that had accomplished so many dubious deeds. It
was as though Fate itself had deserted him.</p>

<p>When the dawn broke, he picked up his bag and went out. He found
the destination he sought, and it struck him as queer that although
it was daylight the inspector was writing in a book under a
green-shaded light.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I have come to give myself up, monsieur."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I murdered the butler at the villa of Monsieur and Madame Lacau
St. Just at Fontainebleau. In this bag are things I stole from
there."</p>

<p>There seemed to be a long interval occupied by movement rather
than sound. Then the same voice:</p>

<p>"You understand what you are saying?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Brochard, detain this man."</p>

<hr>

<p>After a vast lapse of time, in which strange and bewildering
happenings took place, he was conscious of sitting upright on the
edge of a palliasse. A priest was talking to him.</p>

<p>"Have you a wife, my son?"</p>

<p>Jean François shook his head.</p>

<p>"Have you any friends or relations you would wish to communicate
with?"</p>

<p>The guilty man again shook his head.</p>

<p>"Is there any way in which I can help you, my son? I pray that
you realise the gravity of your position. Come, kneel by my side.
The hour is fast approaching."</p>

<p>Jean François jumped up and exclaimed fiercely:</p>

<p>"No! what have I to do with you? How can <i>you</i> help me when
Madame Fatality herself has left me?"</p>

<p>"Madame Fatality? Who is she?"</p>

<p>"I have been wedded to her...Oh, for many years ago."</p>

<p>The priest looked meditatively at the silver crucifix suspended
from his neck.</p>

<p>"Who was she? Who is she? You said you had no wife."</p>

<p>Jean François did not answer. He sank back on the palliasse, and
his eyes were again occupied by his own long supple fingers.</p>

<p>The grey eyes of the priest seemed to be searching for something
through the thick walls of the narrow cell. Suddenly he said:</p>

<p>"You still believe in her?"</p>

<p>Jean François sat there stonily without answering. The priest
sighed, shook his head, cleared his throat as though about to speak
again, buried his face in his hands and shuddered.</p>

<p>After a short interval he made the sign of the cross and went
quietly from the cell.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>18. In The Way of Business</h2>

<p>As the large, thick-set man with the red face, the bushy
mustache, and the very square chin swung round on his swivel chair,
at the great roll-top desk with its elaborate arrangements of
telephones, receivers, and electric buttons, he conveyed to the
little mild-eyed man waiting on 'a chair by the door the sense of
infinite power.</p>

<p>And surely it must be a position requiring singular gifts and
remarkable capacity. For was this not Dollbones, the house famous
throughout the civilized world for supplying trimmings, gimp,
embroidery, buttons, and other accessories to nearly every retail
furnisher in England and the colonies? and was not this Mr. Godfrey
Hylam, the London manager? To hold such a position a man must have
not only brains, and an infinite capacity for work and driving
power, but he must have character, a genius for judging people and
making quick decisions.</p>

<p>"Almost like a general," thought the mild-eyed man by the door.
He had waited fifty minutes in the outer office for his interview,
and on being at length shown in, had been told to "sit down a
minute." This minute had been protracted into thirty-five minutes,
but it was very interesting to watch the great man grappling with
the myriad affairs that came whispering through the wires, and
giving sharp instructions to the two flurried clerks who sat in the
same office, or dictating to the young lady stenographer who sat
furtively on a small chair by his side scribbling into a book with
a fountain-pen.</p>

<p>"She looks ill and worried," thought the little man. He was
indulging in a dreamy speculation on the girl's home life, when he
was suddenly pulled up by the percussion of Mr. Hylam's voice. He
realized that the great man was speaking to him. He was saying:</p>

<p>"Let's see, what's your name?"</p>

<p>"Thomas Pinwell, sir," he answered, and stood up.</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> name?" repeated the big man.</p>

<p>"Pinwell&mdash;Thomas Pinwell," he said in a rather louder
voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Hylam looked irritably among some papers and sighed. He then
continued dictating a letter to the stenographer. When that was
finished he got up, and went out of the room. He was absent about
ten minutes, and then came hurrying in with some more papers. He
called out as he walked:</p>

<p>"Jackson, have you got that statement from Jorrocks, Musgrove
&amp; Bellwither?"</p>

<p>One of the clerks jumped up and said:</p>

<p>"I'll find it, sir."</p>

<p>The clerk took some time to do this, and in the meanwhile Mr.
Hylam dictated another report to the young lady. Then the clerk
brought the statement, and he and Mr. Hylam discussed it at some
length. He gave the clerk some further instructions, which were
twice interrupted by the telephone bell. When this was finished,
Mr. Hylam again caught sight of the little man by the door. He
looked at him with surprise, and said:</p>

<p>"Let's see, what's your name?"</p>

<p>"Pinwell&mdash;Thomas Pinwell, sir," he answered patiently.</p>

<p>Mr. Hylam again sighed and fingered a lot of papers in
pigeon-holes. At that moment there was a knock, and a boy in
buttons entered and said:</p>

<p>"There's Mr. Curtis, of Curtis, Tonks &amp; Curtis, called."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Mr. Hylam. "Yes. All right. Er&mdash;ask him to
come in. I want to see him." He turned to the telephone, and asked
some one to put him on to some one else, and while waiting with the
receiver to his ear, his eye once more caught sight of the little
man by the door. He called out to him:</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;er&mdash;just wait outside a minute,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Hullo! is that you, Thomson?"</p>

<p>Finding himself temporarily dismissed, Mr. Pinwell took up his
hat and went into the outer office. There was a tall, elderly man
with a fur-lined overcoat standing there, and he was immediately
shown in. He remained with Mr. Hylam just one hour. At the end of
that time, one of the directors called and went out to lunch with
Mr. Hylam. A clerk gave Mr. Pinwell the tip that he had better call
back about four o'clock. He said he would do so. He had had thirty
years' experience in the furnishing trade, and he knew that
"business was business." One had to be patient, to conform to its
prescripts. A gentleman like Mr. Hylam lived under continual
pressure. He was acting according to his conscience in the best
interests of the firm. One had to take one's chance with him. After
all, it would be very nice to get the job. He had been out so long,
and he was not so young as he used to be. He thought of his placid
wife and the two children. They were indeed getting into a very
penurious state. He understood that the salary would be thirty
shillings per week,' and a small royalty on the sales. Not a
princely emolument but it would make all the difference. Besides,
what might not the royalties amount to? If he worked hard and
energetically he might make between two and three pounds per
week&mdash;who knows? He went into an aerated bread shop and had a
cup of tea and a piece of seed cake, and read the morning paper. He
stayed there as long as he dare, and then went for a stroll round
the streets. At four o'clock precisely he presented himself at the
managerial office at Dollbones once more. Mr. Hylam had not
returned. They expected him every minute. There were five other
people waiting to see him. At half-past four Mr. Hylam came in,
smoking a cigar. He was accompanied by another gentleman. They
walked right through the waiting crowd and went into the inner
office and shut the door. As a matter of fact, Mr. Pinwell did not
see the manager at all that day. So great was the congestion of
business in the trimming, gimp, embroidery, and button business
that afternoon that he was advised by one of the least aggressive
clerks, at about a quarter to six, to try his luck in the morning.
It was a quarterpast three on the following afternoon that he
eventually obtained his interview with Mr. Hylam, and it was from
his point of view entirely satisfactory. Mr. Hylam said:</p>

<p>"Let's see. You told me your name?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he answered. "Thomas Pinwell."</p>

<p>Mr. Hylam seemed at last to find the papers he desired. He
said:</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;just come here. Show me your references."</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell approached the great desk deferentially. On it was a
chart of London with one section shaded red. Mr. Hylam read the
references carefully and then asked one or two searching questions.
At last he said:</p>

<p>"Well, now, look here. This is your section. Go to Mr. Green,
and he will give you the cards and samples. Then go to Bodney in
the Outer London department upstairs, and he will give you a list
of several hundred furnishing houses with the names of the buyers
and a few particulars. Everything else you must find out. The
salary is thirty shillings a week and two per cent, on sales
completed. Settlement monthly. Good-day, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned to the telephone, and Mr. Pinwell's heart beat
rapidly. He had really got a job again! As he walked to the door he
had a vision of the expression of delight on his wife's face as he
told her the news. He visualized a certain day in a certain month
when he would bring home a lot of sovereigns and buy the children
things. Two per cent.! For every hundred pounds' worth of orders,
two golden sovereigns of his very own! It seemed too good to be
true!</p>

<p>His wife indeed did share with him the comforting joys of this
new vista of commercial prosperity. They occupied now two rooms in
Camling Town, and Tom had been out so long there was no immediate
prospect of a removal. But the rent was now secure and just the
barest necessities of life, and everything depended on the two per
cent, commission. He was to start on the following Monday, and the
intervening days were filled with active preparations. There were
shirts to mend, an overcoat to be stitched, a pair of boots to have
the heels set up, and three new collars to be bought. These were
vital things pertinent to the active propaganda of the
bread-winner. Other things were urgent,&mdash;a new piece of
oil-cloth for the bedroom, some underclothes for the girls, and
several small debts&mdash;but all these things could wait, at any
rate a month or two, till the commissions started coming in. For
Mrs. Pinwell herself there never seemed necessities. She always
managed to look somehow respectable, and, as Mr. Pinwell once
remarked to a neighbor, "My wife is a marvel, sir, with a string
bag. She always believes in bringing the things home herself. She
goes out into the High Street, Camling Town, on a Saturday night,
and I assure you, sir, it's surprising what she will bring back.
She will make a shilling go further than many of them would
half-a-crown. She is a remarkable woman. It surprises me how she
manages to bargain, being so unassuming, so diffident, as it were,
in the home."</p>

<p>There was nothing, then, missing in the necessary equipment of
Mr. Pinwell as he set out with his leather case of samples on the
following Monday. It was a cold, bright day, and he enjoyed the
exercise of walking. He was not by nature a pushful man and he
found the business of calling on people whom he did not know
somewhat irksome. Fortunately he was by temperament patient and
understanding, and he made allowances when people were rude to him,
or kept him waiting indefinitely and then gave him no orders. "It's
all in the way of business," he thought as he shuffled out of the
shop and sought the next street.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week he explained to his wife:</p>

<p>"You see, my dear, there's a lot of spade-work to be done yet.
I'm afraid Flinders, who had the round before me, must have
neglected it disgracefully. It all requires working up again. One
has to get to <i>know</i> people, the right people, of course. They
seem prejudiced against one like, at first."</p>

<p>"Was that Mr. Flinders who used to&mdash;" began Mrs. Pinwell in
a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, I'm afraid he drank. It was a very distressing
story, very distressing indeed. They say he drank himself to death.
A very clever salesman too&mdash;very clever! They tell me he
worked this district up splendidly, and then gradually let it go to
pieces."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear! I can't think how people do such things?" murmured
Mrs. Pinwell.</p>

<p>"It was a great recommendation in my case," continued her
husband, "that I was a teetotaler. Mr. Hylam made a great point of
that. He asked me several times, and read the letter of Judkins
&amp; Co. vouching for my honesty and sobriety for a period of
twenty-two years. He seemed very pleased about that."</p>

<p>At the end of the first month the orders that Mr. Pinwell had
secured for Dollbones were of a negligible character. He felt
discouraged&mdash;as though conscious of there being something
fundamentally wrong in his method of doing business&mdash;but his
wife cheered him by expressing her view that it would probably take
<i>months</i> before his initial spade-work would take effect.</p>

<p>He started on his rounds a little earlier after that, and stayed
a little later. He became more persistent and more patient. He went
back again and again to see people who seemed inaccessible. He
tried to be a little more assertive and plausible in his
solicitations, but at the end of the second month there was little
improvement in his returns, and his commissions amounted to
scarcely enough to pay for the new oil-cloth in the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>The optimism of Mrs. Pinwell was in no way affected by this
failure, but a more alarming note was struck by Mr. Rodney of the
"Outer London Department." He told Mr. Pinwell that Mr. Hylam was
<i>not at all satisfied</i> with his work so far, and he would have
to show greater energy and enterprise during the ensuing month, or
the firm would be impelled to try a new traveler for that district,
one who could show better results.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell was very alarmed. The idea of being "out" again kept
him awake at night. It was a very serious thing. He put in longer
hours still, and hurried more rapidly between his calls. He
increased his stock of samples till they amounted to a very
considerable weight. He made desperate appeals for orders, ringing
the changes on various ways of expressing himself. But at the end
of the next week there was still no improvement on the pages of his
order-book. There was one firm in particular who caused him
considerable heartburning&mdash;Messrs.. Carron and Musswell. These
were quite the biggest people in the neighborhood, and had five
different branches, each doing a prosperous business. Mr. Pinwell
for the life of him could not find out how to get into the good
graces of this firm. No one seemed to know who bought for them, and
he was referred from one person to another, and sent dashing from
one branch to another, all to no purpose.</p>

<p>He had one friend who had a small retail business of his own, a
Baptist named Senner, who gave him small orders occasionally. He
went into Mr. Senner's shop one Friday, and feeling thoroughly
tired and discouraged, he poured out his tale of woe to Mr. Senner.
Mr. Senner was a large doleful man, to whom the sorrows of others
were as balm. He listened to Mr. Pinwell's misfortunes in
sympathetic silence, breathing heavily. At the end of the
peroration his son entered the shop. He was a white-faced,
dissipated-looking young man who wore lavender ties and brushed his
hair back. One might have imagined that he would have been a source
of disappointment to Mr. Senner, but quite the contrary was the
case. The son had a genius for concealing his vices from his
father, and his father had a great opinion of the boy's
intelligence and character. He certainly had a faculty of securing
orders for his father's business.</p>

<p>On this occasion Mr. Senner turned to his son and said:</p>

<p>"Harry, who buys for Carron &amp; Musswell!"</p>

<p>The son looked at Mr. Pinwell and fidgeted with his nails. Then
he grinned weakly and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, you want to get hold of Clappe."</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell came forward and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! I'm really very much obliged to you. It's very
kind! Mr. Clappe, you say! Dear me! yes. Thank you very much. I'll
go and ask for Mr. Clappe." And he shook the young man's hand.</p>

<p>The young man continued grinning in rather a superior manner,
and at that moment Mr. Senner's attention was attracted by a
customer who entered the shop. Mr. Pinwell picked up his bags and
went out. He had not gone more than a dozen yards when he became
aware of Senner junior at his side. The young man still grinned,
and he said:</p>

<p>"I say, you know, it's no good your going to Carron &amp;
Musswell's and asking for Clappe. You'll never get hold of him in
that way."</p>

<p>"Really!" exclaimed Mr. Pinwell. "Now tell me, what would you
suggest?"</p>

<p>The young man sniffed and looked up and down the street, and a
curiously leery expression came over his face. Then he said:</p>

<p>"I expect I could fix it for you all right, Pinwell. You'd
better come with me into the bar of the 'Three Amazons' after
lunch. I'll introduce you. Of course, you know, Mr.
Pinwell,&mdash;er&mdash;you know, business is business. We always
like to oblige our friends, and so on&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked at Mr. Pinwell furtively and bit his nails. For the
moment Mr. Pinwell could not catch the drift of these smiles and
suggestions, but he had been in the upholstery line for
twenty-seven years, and it suddenly dawned upon him that of course
the young man was suggesting that if he introduced him, and
business came out of it, he would expect a commission or a bonus.
He was quite reasonable. He had a sort of ingrained repugnance to
these things himself, but he knew that it was done in business. It
was quite a usual thing. Some of the best firms&mdash;He took the
young man's hand and said:</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;of course&mdash;Mr. Senner, I shall be very pleased to
accommodate you. It's&mdash;er&mdash;only natural, only natural of
course. Business is business. Where shall I meet you?"</p>

<p>The appointment was made for the corner of Mulberry Road at
half-past two; and at that hour Mr. Pinwell arrived with two
heavily laden bags. He walked by the side of the young man down the
street, and then crossed over into the High Road. Right opposite
them was a large gaudy public house called "The Three Amazons," and
they crossed over to it. A feeling of diffidence and shyness came
over Mr. Pinwell. He had only entered a public house on about three
occasions in his life, and then under some very stringent business
demands, or else to get a bottle of brandy when his wife was very
ill. Nevertheless he followed the young man through a passage and
entered the saloon bar, in the corner of which he deposited his
bags. The bar was fairly crowded with business men, but there was
one figure that by its personality immediately arrested Mr.
Pinwell's attention. He was a very big man in a new shiny top-hat
with a curl to it. He was leaning heavily against the center of the
bar, and was surrounded by three or four other men who seemed to be
hanging on his words. He had a large red face and small, dark,
expressionless eyes. The skin seemed to be tight and moist, and to
bind up his features in inelastic bags, except round the eyes,
where it puckered up into dark yellowish layers of flesh. His hands
were fat and stiff and blue like the hands of a gouty subject. His
gray hair curled slightly under the brim of his hat, and his
clothes were ponderously impressive from the silk reveres of his
tail coat to the dark-brown spats that covered his square-toed
boots. As they entered, this impressive individual looked in their
direction and gave young Mr. Senner a faint nod, and then continued
his conversation.</p>

<p>"That's Clappe," whispered Mr. Pinwell's cicerone, and dusted
the knees of his trousers. He then added:</p>

<p>"We'd better wait a bit."</p>

<p>They stood there in the corner of the bar, and the young man
produced a silver cigarette-case and offered its contents to Mr.
Pinwell, an overt act of kindness which that gentleman appreciated
but did not take advantage of. They waited there twenty minutes
before an opportunity presented itself of making any approach to
the great man. But in the meantime Mr. Pinwell watched the
conversation with considerable interest. The four men stood very
close together, smoking, and speaking in thick whispers. He was
alarmed at moments by the way in which one would hold a glass of
whisky-and-water at a perilous angle over the waistcoat of another,
while fumbling with a cigarette in the unoccupied hand. He could
not hear the conversation, but occasional sentences reached him:
"It's the cheapest line there is." "Here! I tell you where you can
get&mdash;" "D'you know what they paid last year!" "I 'ad 'im by
the short 'airs that time." "'E says to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>It occurred to Mr. Pinwell that there was something distressing
about this scene, something repelling and distasteful, but he
consoled himself with the reflection that after all business had to
be conducted somehow. Money had to be made to pay for the streets
and the lamp-posts, and the public baths and the battleships.
"Business is not always pleasant," he reflected, "but it has to be
done."</p>

<p>At the end of twenty minutes two of the men went away and left
Mr. Clappe talking apathetically to the remaining man.</p>

<p>"Now's our chance," said Senner junior, and he walked across the
bar. He seized on a lull in the conversation to step forward and
touch Mr. Clappe on the arm.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;excuse me, Mr. Clappe," he said. "This is my friend
Mr. Pinwell, of Dollbones."</p>

<p>The big man glanced from Senner junior to Mr. Pinwell and gave
that gentleman an almost imperceptible nod. He then sighed,
breathed heavily, and took a long drink from the glass in front of
him.</p>

<p>"I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. Clappe," said Pinwell
nervously. "I 've heard about you. I'm with Dollbones, you know,
<i>the</i> Dollbones. We have&mdash;er&mdash;several very good
lines just now."</p>

<p>The great Clappe fixed him with his lugubrious eyes and suddenly
said in a thick voice:</p>

<p>"What'll you drink?"</p>

<p>It is curious that Mr. Pinwell with all his experience should
have been taken back by this hospitable request. He stammered and
said:</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you very much, sir. I don't think I'll&mdash;at
least, I'll have&mdash;er&mdash;a limejuice and soda."</p>

<p>And then Mr. Clappe behaved in a very extraordinary way. An
expression of utter dejection came over his face. He puffed his
cheeks out and suddenly muttered, "Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>And then he rolled round and <i>deliberately turned his back on
Mr. Pinwell and his friend</i>! It was a very trying moment. Mr.
Pinwell was at his wit's end how to act, and Senner junior did not
help him in any way. On the contrary he seemed to be taking Mr.
Clappe's side. He gave a sort of snigger of disgust, and called
across the bar in a jaunty voice:</p>

<p>"Johnny Walker and soda, please, Miss Parritt."</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell gaped ineffectually at the back of the great man,
and hesitated whether to make any further advance. But he was
relieved of the necessity of coming to a decision by the act of Mr.
Clappe himself, who slowly drained the remnants of refreshment in
his glass, and then walked heavily out of the bar, without looking
round.</p>

<p>In the meantime young Senner had acquired his drink, and was
feverishly tapping the end of a cigarette on the rail. He took a
long drink and spluttered slightly, and then, turning on Mr.
Pinwell, he said:</p>

<p>"What particular brand of blankety fool are you?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?" exclaimed Mr. Pinwell, amazed.</p>

<p>"I tell you," said the young man, "you 're a particular type of
blankety fool. You 've missed the chance of yer life! Don't you
know when a man like Clappe asks yer to have a drink yer a blankety
fool not to? D' you know that man places thousands and thousands of
pounds a year for Carron &amp; Musswell? Thousands, I tell yer! It
don't matter to 'im where he places the orders. He puts it all out
among 'is pals. You 'ad a chance of being a pal, and you've muffed
it!"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;" spluttered Mr. Pinwell. "I
really&mdash;I&mdash;had no idea. I said I would have a drink. It
was only that I ordered a&mdash;er&mdash;non-alcoholic drink. I
really can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Psaugh!"</p>

<p>Young Mr. Senner swirled the whisky round in his glass and drank
it at a gulp. Then he muttered:</p>

<p>"Gawd! Asking Clappe for a limejuice and soda!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell thought about this meditatively. He wondered whether
he had been in the wrong. After all, people all had their notions
of the way to conduct business. Business was a very big thing. It
had "evolved"&mdash;that was the word!&mdash;evolved out of all
sorts of complicated social conditions, supply and demand, and so
on. A man perhaps who had been in the habit of taking alcoholic
refreshment and expecting others to&mdash;it might perhaps be
difficult for him to understand.</p>

<p>"Don't you never drink?" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Senner.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;occasionally have a glass of stout," murmured
Mr. Pinwell. "Last Christmas my wife's sister brought us a bottle
of canary sac. I have no particular taste for&mdash;er&mdash;things
of this sort&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anyway," said Mr. Senner, "you're not under any bally
pledge?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, no!" exclaimed Mr. Pinwell.</p>

<p>"Well, then," answered his youthful adviser. "I should advise
you next time Clappe or any one like him asks you to have a drink,
lap it up like a poodle and stand him a quick one in return."</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell surveyed his friend over the rim of his glasses, and
thought for some minutes. Then he said:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Mr. Clappe is not likely to ask me to have a drink
again."</p>

<p>But the young man of precocious experience answered:</p>

<p>"If you come in here to-morrer, I'll bet yer he'll have
forgotten who you are."</p>

<p>It was all a very astounding experience, and that night in bed
Mr. Pinwell gave the matter long and serious consideration. If his
circumstances had been normal he would have hardly thought about it
for five consecutive minutes, but his circumstances were anything
but normal. They were somewhat desperate. He was on his last
month's trial. If he should be out again!...Both the children
wanted new clothes, and Eileen's boots were all to pieces. And then
there was that bill of Batson's for three pounds seventeen
shillings, for which payment was demanded by the seventeenth; there
were other bills less urgent perhaps but&mdash;the little man kept
turning restlessly in bed and even in his sleep he made febrile
calculations.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged that the result of Mr. Pinwell's
nocturnal meditations tended to loosen certain moral tendencies in
himself. He set out on the morrow in a peculiarly equivocal frame
of mind, wavering between conflicting impulses, but already
predisposed to temporize with his conscience if by so doing he
could advance what he considered to be the larger issues of
business considerations. These first concessions, curiously enough,
were not made at the instance of the great Mr. Clappe, however, but
at that of a certain Mr. Cherish whom he met during that day. He
was a breezy, amiable person, and the manager of the International
Hardwood Company. He was just going out to lunch as Mr. Pinwell
called, and being in a particularly buoyant mood, owing to a
successful business deal, he took hold of our hero's arm and drew
him into the street. As they walked along he asked what it was that
Pinwell wanted, and that gentleman immediately expatiated on the
virtues of the goods he had at his disposal. While talking he found
himself almost unconsciously led into the bar of a public-house
called "The Queen of Roumania." And when asked by Mr. Cherish,
"What he was going to have," a sudden desperate instinct of
adventure came over him, and he called for whisky. When it was
brought he drank it in little sips, and thought it the most
detestable drink he had ever tasted. But he determined to see the
matter through, and salved his conscience with the reflection that
it was just "in the way of business." He certainly had to
acknowledge that after drinking it he felt a certain elevated sense
of assurance. He talked to Mr. Cherish quite unselfconsciously and
listened to him with concentrated attention. This mental attitude
was quickened by the discovery that Mr. Cherish was actually in
need of certain embroideries that Dollbones were in a position to
supply. It would be quite a big order. He promised to bring samples
of the embroideries on the following day, and took his departure.
During the afternoon he felt a sudden reaction from the whisky and
was very tired. He went home early, complaining to his wife of "a
bad headache, as though something had disagreed with him."
Nevertheless the prospect of securing the order for the
embroideries excited him considerably, and he went so far as to
tell her that he hoped things were soon going to take a turn for
the better. He arrived at his appointment the next day to the
minute, carrying a very heavy valise stuffed with machine
embroideries. He was kept waiting by Mr. Cherish for nearly an
hour, and was then ushered into his presence. Mr. Cherish was still
in a very jovial mood and had another gentleman with him. He shook
Mr. Pinw ell's hand and immediately told him three obscene stories
that he had just heard&mdash;Mr. Cherish was reputed to have the
largest repertoire of obscene stories in the trade&mdash;and the
other gentleman also told two. Pinwell laughed at them to the best
of his ability, although they did not appear to him to be
particularly humorous. He then felt peculiarly uncomfortable in
that for the life of him he could not think of a story in reply. He
never could remember these stories. So he opened his valise and
displayed the tapestries. The other two gentlemen took a desultory
interest in them as tapestries, but a rapacious interest in them as
regards value. They were figured tapestries and the price was four
pounds seventeen and sixpence a yard. Mr. Cherish mentioned
casually that they would want about seventy yards. And then Mr.
Pinwell made the rapidest mental calculation he had ever made in
his life. Seventy yards at £4. 17s. 6d. would be £341. 5s. which,
at two per cent, would mean just on seven pounds for himself! It
was dazzling! Seven gold sovereigns! However, the order was not yet
given. The two gentlemen talked about it at some length, and looked
up other quotations. At last Mr. Cherish said:</p>

<p>"Well, I think we'll go and see what the 'Queen of Roumania' has
got up her sleeve."</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell and the other gentleman laughed, and they all went
out. Mr. Pinwell dreaded the prospect of drinking more whisky,
but&mdash;seven golden sovereigns! enough to pay that bill of
Batson's and to buy the children all the clothes they wanted! He
knew in any case the etiquette of the trade, and when they arrived
in the resplendent bar it was he who insisted on ordering "three
Scotch whiskies and a split soda." On the arrival of these
regenerating beverages the other two gentlemen resumed their
sequence of improper stories. And it was just after the glasses had
been re-charged at the instance of Mr. Cherish that he suddenly
recollected a story he had heard nearly twenty years ago. It was a
disgusting story, and it had impressed itself on his memory for the
reason that it struck him when he heard it as being so incredibly
vulgar that he could not understand how any one could appreciate
it. But as he neared the end of his second glass of whisky it
suddenly flashed into his mind that here was the story that Mr.
Cherish and his friend would like. He had by this time arrived at
an enviable state of unselfconsciousness, and he told the story as
well as he had ever told anything in his life. The result amazed
him. The other two gentlemen roared with laughter, and Mr. Cherish
tilted his hat back and slapped his leg.</p>

<p>"Gawd's truth! that's a damn good story, Pinwell!" he cried out
several times.</p>

<p>Other people came into the bar, and Mr. Pinwell found himself
something of a hero. Every one seemed to know Mr. Cherish, and he
introduced him, and on several occasions said, "I say, Pinwell,
tell Mr. Watson that story about the sea captain."</p>

<p>The story was an unqualified success, and seemed in some way to
endear him to Mr. Cherish. That gentleman became more confidential
and confiding, and they talked about business.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell believed he drank four whiskies-and-sodas that
afternoon. In any case, he arrived home feeling very bilious and
ill. He told his wife he had felt faint, and had taken some
brandy&mdash;"Thank heaven," he thought, "she doesn't know the
difference in smell between brandy and whisky!" He said he would go
to bed at once, he thought, and he kissed her in rather a maudlin
fashion, and said he knew she would be glad to hear that he had
that afternoon taken an order for £341&mdash;that would mean nearly
seven pounds to them! Enough to buy clothes for the children and
pay Batson's bill; he laughed a little hysterically after that, and
rolled into bed.</p>

<p>On the following day he was very unwell and unable to get up,
and Mrs. Pinwell wrote to the firm and explained that her husband
had got his feet wet on his rounds and had contracted a chill. She
also inclosed his order-book.</p>

<p>It was three days before he was well enough to resume his
rounds, and then he avoided the company of Mr. Cherish and set out
on a pilgrimage to the meaner parts of the district. But the orders
there seemed few and far between, and a feeling of depression came
over him.</p>

<p>On the 21st of the month he was bidden to the presence of Mr.
Rodney. That gentleman said that the firm was still dissatisfied
with his efforts, but on the strength of the order he had secured
from the International Hardwood Co. they were willing to keep him
on for another month's trial. But unless at the end of that time he
had secured further orders of a similar nature, he must consider
his engagement at an end.</p>

<p>It would be tedious and extremely disconcerting to follow the
precise movements of Thomas Pinwell during the ensuing four Weeks.
It need only be said that, utterly discouraged by his lonely
peregrinations in the paths of honest effort, he eventually once
more sought the society of young Mr. Senner and Mr. Cherish. In
their company he discovered what might be called "a cheering
fluidity." He found that whisky made him so ill that he simply
could not drink it, but he drank ale, stout, brandy, and gin. None
of these things agreed with him, but he found that by drinking as
little as possible and ringing the changes on them he could just
manage to keep going. The direct result of this moral defection was
that his circle of business acquaintances increased at an enormous
rate. He gradually got to know the right place and the right hour
to catch the right people. His efforts on behalf of Messrs.
Dollbones during the following three months were eminently
satisfactory, and his own commissions amounted to no mean sum.
Neither was his conscience seriously affected by this change of
habit. He considered it an inevitable development of his own active
progress "in the way of business." The very word "business" had a
peculiarly mesmerizing effect upon him. It was a fetish.</p>

<p>He looked upon it as an acolyte might look upon the dogma of
some faith he blindly believed in. He believed that people were in
some mysterious way pale adjuncts to the idea that, whatever
happens, "Business" must go on. He would stand in the corner of the
bar of "The Queen of Roumania" and look across the street at the
Camling Town public wash-houses, a mid-Victorian Gothic building in
stucco and red brick, and then, turning his mild, watery eyes
toward Senner junior, he would say:</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful thing&mdash;business, you know, Mr. Senner; a
very wonderful thing indeed. Now look at the wash-houses! They
simply have been the result of business. No progress is made,
nothing is done except through business. If it weren't for business
we should all be barbarians."</p>

<p>And then he would take a little sip at the gin and water in
front of him. After copious trials he found that gin affected him
less than any of the other drinks, so he stuck to that. He did not
like it, but he found that people simply would not do business with
him in Camling Town unless he drank and stood drinks. It was very
trying, and the most trying part was the necessity of concealing
these aberrations from his wife. When he first started he was
conscious that he often returned home smelling of the disgusting
stuff. He tried cloves, but they were not very effective. Then one
day he had a brilliant inspiration. He was unwell again. It
happened very often now&mdash;at least once a week&mdash;and the
doctor gave him some medicine. Then it occurred to him that the
medicine might smell like anything else. He would keep up the
medicine. His wife was very unsuspecting. He hated deceiving her.
He had never deceived her about anything, but he thought, "Women
don't understand business. It is for her benefit that I take
it."</p>

<p>Sunday was a great joy to him. He would take the children out
for a walk in the morning while his wife cooked the dinner. In the
afternoon he would have a nap; but the greatest luxury of the day
seemed to him that he need drink nothing except water.</p>

<p>At the end of six months there came a proud day when Mr. Rodney
informed him that Mr. Hylam was quite satisfied with his progress,
and his ordinary salary was raised to two pounds. It was
summertime, and the accumulation of his commissions justified the
family moving into larger rooms, one of which was to be a bathroom.
But Mr. Pinwell was beginning to feel his health very much
affected, and he looked forward with intense avidity to the two
weeks' holiday which was his due in September. In July he achieved
a great triumph. He met and got into the good graces of the great
Mr. Clappe. As Senner junior predicted, that gentleman had quite
forgotten their previous meeting, and it happened in the company of
the good Mr. Cherish. They all met in the bar of "The Cormorant,"
and after several drinks Cherish said:</p>

<p>"I say, Pinwell, tell Mr. Clappe that story about the sea
captain!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell complied, and when he had finished he saw the shiny
bags of flesh on Mr. Clappe's face shaking. He was evidently very
much amused, although his eyes looked hard and tired. He said
hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Damn good! What's yours?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell did not fail on this occasion, and asked for some
gin. And directly he noticed that the great man's glass was nearly
empty, he insisted on ordering some more all round. He found Mr.
Clappe an expensive client. He drank prodigiously, in a splendid
nonchalant manner, hardly noticing it, or taking any interest in
who paid for it. It took Mr. Pinwell several weeks, and cost him
the price of several whole bottles of whisky, before he became
sufficiently established in favor to solicit orders. But once
having arrived there, the rest was easy, for Mr. Clappe had the
reputation of being "loyal to his pals," and he had the power of
placing very large orders.</p>

<p>There came a day when Mr. Pinwell received an order for over
eight hundred pounds' worth of goods, and for the first time in his
life he got very drunk. He arrived home in a cab very late at night
and was just conscious enough to tell his wife that he had been
taken ill, and some one had given him some brandy, and it had gone
to his head. She helped him to bed, and seemed rather surprised and
alarmed.</p>

<p>On the following day he was very ill, and a doctor was sent for.
He examined him carefully, and looked stern. Out in the hall he
said to Mrs. Pinwell:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mrs. Pinwell, but does your husband drink rather a
lot?"</p>

<p>"Drink!" exclaimed the lady. "My Tom!...Why, he's practically a
teetotaler."</p>

<p>The doctor looked at her thoughtfully and murmured, "Oh!" Then,
as he turned to go, he said:</p>

<p>"Well, we'll pull him through this, I hope, but he must be very
careful. You must advise him never to touch alcohol in any form.
It's poison to him," and he left Mrs. Pinwell speechless with
indignation.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell's illness proved more obstinate than was
anticipated, and it was some weeks before he was well enough to get
about. When he arrived at that stage the firm of Dollbones were
considerate enough to suggest that he might take his holiday
earlier than had been arranged, and go away at once.</p>

<p>Consequently, on a certain fine morning in August, Mr. and Mrs.
Pinwell, with the two children, set out for a fortnight's holiday
to Herne Bay. The firm paid his salary while he was away, and in
addition he had now nearly thirty-five pounds in the bank, and all
his debts were paid. It was many years since the family had been in
such an affluent position, and everything pointed to the prospect
of a joyous and beneficial time. And so indeed, to a large extent,
it was. Mr. Pinwell felt very shaky when he arrived, and he spent
most of his time sitting in a deck chair on the sands, watching the
children, while his wife sat on the sands by his side, sewing. The
fresh breezes from the Channel made him very sleepy at first, but
he gradually got used to them. It was extremely pleasant sitting
there listening to the waves breaking on the shore and watching the
white sails of yachts gliding hither and thither; very pleasant and
very refreshing. It was only after some days that when he was left
alone a certain moroseness came over him. He could not explain this
to himself; it seemed so unreasonable. But he felt a curious and
restless desire and an irritability. These moods became more
pronounced as the week advanced, in spite of the fact that his
strength returned to him. He had moods when he wished to be alone
and the children tired him.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, he and his wife were strolling up from the
beach late in the afternoon, and they were nearing their lodgings
when he suddenly said:</p>

<p>"I think I'll just stroll round and get a paper."</p>

<p>"Oh! Shall I come with you?" his wife asked.</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear. Don't. Er&mdash;I'll just stroll round by
myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>He seemed so anxious to go by himself that she did not insist,
and he sauntered round the corner. He looked back to see that she
had gone in, and then he walked rather more quickly round into the
High Street. He hummed to himself and glanced rather furtively at
the contents of the newspaper bills, then, after looking up and
down the street, he suddenly darted into the saloon bar of the
principal hotel...</p>

<p>After his second glass of gin-and-water a feeling of comfortable
security crept over him. After all, it Was a very ingratiating
atmosphere this, ingratiating and sociable. He glanced round the
bar and carried on a brief but formal conversation with a florid
individual standing near him. He hesitated for a moment whether he
would tell him the story about the sea captain, but on second
thoughts decided to reserve it to a more intimate occasion.
Besides, he must not be away long.</p>

<p>After that it became a habit with Mr. Pinwell for the rest of
the holiday for him at some time during the day, and occasionally
twice or three times during the day, to "go for a stroll round by
himself." His wife never for one moment suspected the purpose of
these wanderings, though she was informed that he was taking
another bottle of the medicine.</p>

<p>When they returned to town Mr. Pinwell certainly seemed better
and more eager about his work. It may be that he had the measure of
his constitution more under control. He knew what was the least
damaging drink he could take, and he knew how much he dare consume
without immediately disastrous results. He gradually became a
well-known habitué of all the best-known saloon bars in the
neighborhood of his rounds. His character altered. He always
remained mild and unassertive, but his face became pinched and
thin, and he began to enjoy the reputation of being a "knowing
one." He did not make a fortune in his solicitations for orders for
gimp, trimmings, buttons, and embroidery, but he certainly earned a
very fair competence. In two years' time he was entirely intimate
with every buyer of importance in the Camling Town district and out
as far as the "Teck Arms" at Highgate. The family still occupied
the larger rooms (with the bathroom) that they had moved to, and
both the girls attended the Camling Town Collegiate School for
Girls, and showed every promise of being worthy and attractive
members of society.</p>

<p>It was not till the end of the second year that two events
following rapidly on each other's heels tended to disturb the
normal conditions of the Pinwell family. A letter arrived one day
from a lawyer. It appeared that a brother of Mr. Pinwell's whom he
had not seen for twelve years, and who had owned a farm in
Northamptonshire, had died intestate. He was not married, and Tom
Pinwiell was his only living relative. Under the circumstances he
inherited the whole of his brother's property. When this had been
assessed it was proved to he worth £140 per year. Needless to say
this news brought great joy to the traveler's family. Visions of
great splendor opened out before them, wealth, comfort, security.
The day after the settlement was made, Tom Pinwell entertained Mr.
Cherish, Mr. Clappe, and a few others of his friends to a supper at
"The Queen of Roumania," and the next day he was taken Very ill. He
lay in a critical state for ten days, nursed with a sort of feline
intensity by his wife. The doctor then said that he might
recover&mdash;he was a different doctor to the one who had so
exasperated Mrs. Pinwell with his outrageous suggestions&mdash;but
that he would be an invalid all his life. He would have to live on
special food and must not touch either sweets or alcohol in any
form.</p>

<p>On a certain evening Mr. Pinwell showed traces of convalescence
and was allowed to sit up in bed. His wife as usual sat by his
bedside, knitting. He seemed more cheerful than he had ever been
before, and Mrs. Pinwell took the opportunity of saying:</p>

<p>"What a blessing it is, dear, about this money!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," answered her spouse.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Tom," she said suddenly, "there is a thing I've
wanted to do all my life. And now perhaps is the opportunity."</p>

<p>"What is that, my dear?"</p>

<p>"To go and live in the country."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Think of it! When you 're better, we can go and get a little
cottage somewhere, with a bit of a garden, you know&mdash;grow our
own vegetables and that. You can live fine in some parts of the
country for £140 a year. You'll be able to give up this nasty
tiring old business. It'll be lovely."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear."</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell's voice sounded rather faint, and she busied herself
with his beef-tea. Nothing more was said about the idea that night.
But gradually, as he got stronger, Mrs. Pinwell enlarged on the
idea. She talked about the flowers they could grow, and the economy
of having your own fowls and potatoes. It would have to be right in
the country, but not <i>too</i> far from a village or town, so that
the girls could continue their schooling and meet other girls. To
all of this Mr. Pinwell agreed faintly, and he even made a
suggestion that he thought Surrey was nicer than
Buckinghamshire.</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell was confined to his bedroom for nearly two months.
And then one day a letter came from Messrs. Dollbones. It was to
say that in view of the short time that Mr. Pinwell had been in
their service they could not see their way to continue paying his
salary after the end of the month, unless he were well enough to
continue his work.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pinwell said:</p>

<p>"No, and they needn't continue to pay it at all, for all we
care!"</p>

<p>A troubled look came over her husband's face, and he said:</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;they've treated me very well, Emma, very well indeed.
There's many firms don't pay their employees at all when they're
ill."</p>

<p>"Well, then, they jolly well ought to," answered Mrs. Pinwell.
"People get ill through doing the firm's work."</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell sniffed. It was the one subject upon which he and
his wife were inclined to differ. Mrs. Pinwell did not understand
business; she had no reverence for it.</p>

<p>By the end of the month Mr. Pinwell was up again and going for
short walks up and down the street. One day he said:</p>

<p>"Let me see, my dear&mdash;next Thursday is the first of the new
month, isn't it!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Pinwell. "And thank goodness you haven't
got to go back to that horrid old business!"</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell said nothing at the time, but a few hours later he
said:</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;I've been thinking, my dear. I rather think I ought
perhaps to&mdash;er&mdash;to try and see if I could go for a little
while on Thursday. You see, the firm have treated me very
generously, very generously
indeed&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;business is business."</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" answered his wife. "I'm sure they've got
some one else doing your job by now. Besides, you 're not strong
enough."</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell fidgeted with his watch-chain and walked up the
street. During the next two days Mrs. Pinwell could tell that he
was fretting. He seemed distracted and inclined to be irritable. He
gave demonstrations of his walking powers and stayed out longer and
moved more quickly. He got into such a state on the Wednesday
evening, that in a weak moment Mrs. Pinwell made the mistake of her
life.</p>

<p>She agreed that he might try and go the next day just for an
hour or so, but he was to come home directly he felt tired.</p>

<p>Tom started out on the Thursday morning, and he seemed in a
great state of elation. In spite of his weakness he insisted on
taking one of his bags of samples. He walked more quickly down the
street than she had seen him walk for a long time. Mrs. Pinwell
then turned to her household duties. She was disappointed, but not
entirely surprised, that her husband did not come home to lunch,
but at half-past three a sudden curious feeling of alarm came over
her. She tried to reason with herself that it was all nonsense;
nothing had happened, Tom was a little late&mdash;that was all. But
her reason quailed before some more insidious sense of calamity.
The children came home from school at a quarter-past four, and
still he had not returned. She gave them their tea and somehow
their gay chatter irritated her for the first time. She would not
convey to them her sense of fear. She washed up the tea-things and
busied herself in the house.</p>

<p>It was a quarter to six when Tom came home. He staggered into
the hall. His eyes had a strange look she had not seen before. He
was trembling violently. She did not ask any questions. She took
his arm and led him into the bedroom and untied his collar and tie.
He lay on the bed and his teeth chattered. She got him a hot-water
bottle and gradually undressed him. Then she sent one of the girls
for the doctor.</p>

<p>In the meantime he started talking incoherently, although he
repeated on one or two occasions, "I've taken another bottle of the
medicine, Emm'."</p>

<p>The doctor was on duty in the surgery when the child called, and
he did not come round till half-past eight.</p>

<p>When he looked a t Pinwell and took his pulse, he said:</p>

<p>"What's he been doing?"</p>

<p>"He's been out," said Mrs. Pinwell. "He said he'd taken another
bottle of the medicine."</p>

<p>"Medicine? what medicine?" The doctor seemed to examine the lips
of the sick man very closely, then he shook his head. He turned to
Mrs. Pinwell as though he were going to make a statement, then he
changed his mind. It did not require any great astuteness to
determine from the doctor's face that the case was critical. He
gave the patient a powder, and after a few instructions to Mrs.
Pinwell he went, and said he would return later in the evening.
After the doctor had gone, Mr. Pinwell was delirious for an hour,
and then he sank into a deep sleep. The doctor returned just after
eleven. He examined him and said that nothing more could be done
that night. He would return in the morning. In the meantime, if
things took a more definite turn, they could send for him.</p>

<p>Tom Pinwell lay unconscious for nearly twenty-four hours,
sometimes mumbling feverishly, at other times falling into a deep
coma. But suddenly, late on the following evening, he seemed to
alter. His face cleared, and he sighed peacefully. Mrs. Pinwell
noticed the change and she went up close to the bed. He looked at
her and said suddenly:</p>

<p>"I don't think it would do, my dear, to go and live in the
country."</p>

<p>"No, no, dear; all right. We'll live where you like."</p>

<p>"You see," he said after a pause, "business has to be gone
through...There was Judkins &amp; Co., they treated me very fair,
then they went bankrupt. It was very unfortunate, very unfortunate
indeed...I wouldn't like these people&mdash;what's their name,
Emma? ..."</p>

<p>"Dollbones."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, Dollbones!...Dollbones. No, I wouldn't like them to
think I'd let them in like. Just because I had a little
money...It's a very serious thing&mdash;business..."</p>

<p>Mr. Pinwell seemed about to say something, but he smiled instead
and looked up at the ceiling. He became very still after that, and
Mrs. Pinwell placed a book so that the candle-light should not
shine on his face. All through the night she sat there watching and
doing the little things the doctor had told her to. But he was very
still. Once he sighed, and on another occasion she thought he
said:</p>

<p>"That was very amusin' about that invoice of Barrel and
Beelswright, Mr. Cherish...oh, dear me!"</p>

<p>About dawn, thoroughly exhausted with her vigil, Mrs. Pinwell
fell into a fitful sleep, sitting up in her chair. She only slept
for a few minutes, and then awakened with a start. The short end of
candle was spluttering in its socket, and its light was contending
with the cold blue glimmer of the early day. She shivered, her
frame racked by physical fatigue, and her mind benumbed by the
incredible stillness of the little room.</p>

<p class="cpb">
</p>

<p>"Consequently, ladies and gentlemen, after placing £17,500 in
the reserve fund, for the reasons which I have indicated to you, I
feel justified in recommending a dividend of 12½ per cent, on the
ordinary shares."</p>

<p>The big man with the square chin dabbed his forehead with his
handkerchief and took a sip of water as he resumed his seat. A
faint murmur of approval and applause ran round the room; papers
rustled, and people spoke in low, breathless voices. Twelve and a
half per cent.! It was a good dividend, a very good dividend! A
hundred different brains visualized rapidly what it meant to them
personally. To some it meant a few extra luxuries, to others
comforts, and to some a distinct social advance. If Dollbones could
only keep this up!</p>

<p>Sir Arthur Schelling was seconding the adoption of this report,
but it was a mere formality. No one took any interest in the
white-haired financier, except to nudge each other and say, "That's
Schelling. They say he's worth half a million." It was a curiously
placid meeting, there was no criticism, and every one seemed on the
best of terms. It broke up, and the shareholders dispersed into
little knots, or scattered to spread the good news that Dollbones
were paying twelve and a half per cent.</p>

<p>Sir Arthur took the chairman's hand and murmured:</p>

<p>"I must congratulate you, Hylam. An excellent report!"</p>

<p>The large man almost blushed with pleasure, and said:</p>

<p>"It's very kind of you, Sir Arthur. Are you lunching in
town?"</p>

<p>"I was going to suggest that you lunch with me at the Carlton. I
have my car here."</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you very much. I shall be delighted."</p>

<p>Mr. Hylam turned and gave a few instructions to his lawyer and
his private secretary, and handed various papers to each; then he
followed his host out of the Cannon Street Hotel.</p>

<p>They got into the great car, and each man lighted a well-merited
cigar. As they drove through the city, Sir Arthur discussed a few
details of the balance-sheet, and then added:</p>

<p>"I really think you have shown a remarkable genius of
organization in conducting this business, Hylam. It is a business
which I should imagine requires considerable technical knowledge
and great&mdash;er&mdash;tact."</p>

<p>Mr. Hylam laughed deprecatingly and muttered:</p>

<p>"Oh, we have our little difficulties!" He puffed at his cigar
and looked out of the window.</p>

<p>"So many&mdash;er&mdash;varieties of employees, I should
imagine?" said Sir Arthur.</p>

<p>"Yes, you 're right, sir. There are varieties. I've had a lot of
difficulty with the travelers this year." He gave a vicious puff at
his cigar and stamped on the ash on the floor, and suddenly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Drunken swine!"</p>

<p>Sir Arthur readjusted his gold-rimmed pince-nez and looked at
his friend.</p>

<p>"Is that so indeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mr. Hylam. "I don't know how it is. They nearly
all drink. In one district alone, I've had two travelers
practically drink themselves to death, one after the other."</p>

<p>"I'm very distressed to hear that," said Sir Arthur; "very
distressed. It's a very great social evil. My wife, as you may
know, is on a board of directorship of the Blue Biband Evangelists.
They do a lot of good work. They have a branch in Camling Town.
They have pleasant evenings, you know&mdash;cocoa and bagatelle,
and so on; and lectures on Sunday. But, I don't know, it doesn't
seem to eradicate the evil."</p>

<p>"No; I'm afraid it's in the blood with many of them," said the
managing director.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's very true. I often tell my wife I'm afraid she
wastes her time. It seems inexplicable. I can't see why they should
do it. What satisfaction can it be to&mdash;er&mdash;drink to
excess? And then it must hamper them so in the prosecution of their
work. It seems in a way so&mdash;ungrateful, to the people who
employ them, I mean. Ah! here we are at the Carlton! Champneys,
come back for me at&mdash;er&mdash;three-thirty. Yes, it's a great
social evil, a very great social evil indeed!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>19. The Beautiful, Merciless
Lady</h2>

<p>There are few men strong enough to withstand success. She is the
beautiful, merciless lady.</p>

<p>At the first tap on the shoulder the victim of her favour rocks
and staggers. She glances into his eyes, and unless he is a
creature of superb control he loses his head. He plunges hither and
thither, clutching at the golden aura in which she seems to float.
He feels himself a thing apart, transcendent, impervious,
invincible. The world of pigmy men around him are merely the drab
background to a brilliant picture. He can do no wrong. The
standards of morality and behaviour which these others have set up
are not his standards. He is the darling of the gods, and he
follows his mistress up and up, leaping from crag to crag on the
slope of the sunlit mountain.</p>

<p>Whither?</p>

<p>He never puts this query to himself. He lives in a welter of
exultation. All things are charged with the magic of a thousand
revelations. The younger he is when she first meets him the more
devastating are her allurements. Possibly this is why so many
infant prodigies never emerge from the infant stage. She stifles
them with a surfeit of her riches&mdash;the little bores! She likes
men best in their early manhood, when she may flirt with them at
her leisure. The old she seldom troubles about. They know her wiles
and are frequently too cunning or too weary.</p>

<p>Oh, but the young man, still with beauty and health and clean,
strong limbs!</p>

<p>It was such a one that she met in the person of my friend,
Johnny Lydgate. She led him away and destroyed him as completely as
the rose is destroyed by the breath of autumn winds.</p>

<p>There was no reason why he should have been destroyed, no
exterior cause. He had a thousand friends and no enemy, except the
one which she created in himself. Everything tended to produce in
Johnny Lydgate a creature of gentle bearing, of sanity, and
equipoise. His father was a delightful old gentleman, a librarian
in a country town, who kept homing pigeons and compiled
anthologies. His mother and sisters were charming and lovable
women. They formed a united, devoted family.</p>

<p>It was at Stoneleigh College that I first met Lydgate. We were
inseparable companions for nearly four years. My recollections of
him there were those of a pleasant, companionable, almost negative
schoolboy. He excelled at nothing and displayed no ambitions. He
was affectionate, intelligent, and amusing, but at work and at
sport he never rose above mediocrity.</p>

<p>We know a man's body by the familiar regard of its movements and
expressions. We know the quality of his mind as it is revealed to
us through his opinions and observations, but it is strange how we
may get to know a man's soul by some instant of revelation. We may
think we are entirely familiar with him. We may have known him
intimately for twenty years or more, but one day we suddenly
experience a scrap of recognition of something deeper. It may be a
phrase that he employs, a gesture, an attitude, some queer
telepathic message from his eyes; but in that instant we realize
that we know our man for the first time. All our values concerning
him become readjusted from that moment.</p>

<p>There came such a moment to me when Lydgate and I were in our
last term at Stoneleigh. I remember the moment vividly. It was
after our interhouse football match, in which Lydgate had played
very well&mdash;far above his average. Our Housemaster, who was a
very popular man, ran up and, slapping Johnny on the back, called
out: "Bravo, Lydgate! Bravo, bravo!" As he turned away I saw my
school chum look up at the sky and a queer expression came over his
face, a kind of drunken egoism, and I suddenly thought to
myself:</p>

<p>"So <i>that</i> is Johnny Lydgate, after all! And I thought I
knew&mdash;"</p>

<p>For a time after leaving school we lost touch with each other.
Boys are very apt to make vows of eternal friendship, and
then&mdash;well, other things happen along. Writing is such a
fag.</p>

<p>Johnny went to Paris to study art, whilst I walked the
hospitals. However, he had not been in Paris for a year&mdash;he
only wrote to me once!&mdash;when his father died. As may be
imagined, a man who specializes in homing pigeons and anthologies
does not leave a fortune. The Lydgate family found themselves in
distressed circumstances. Lydgate was recalled from Paris, and had
to do something immediately to earn money.</p>

<p>He took the position manfully, and with that cheery good humour
that was characteristic of him. He obtained a place as an assistant
to a firm of decorative designers, hoping that his meagre training
might be of some assistance. His remuneration was, naturally, quite
nominal, but the firm held out prospects of advancement. He stayed
with this firm for seven years and gave no evidence of special
ability. He jogged along stolidly, learning to make pleasant,
undistinguished designs for wallpapers, cretonnes, and furniture.
He was very popular in the studio where he worked, on account of
his unfailing good humour, unselfishness, and gift of fun. He
distinguished himself most by making caricatures of his colleagues,
and imitating their voices and mannerisms. He displayed no
particular ambitions, other than to jog along, and have as good a
time as his limited income would allow.</p>

<p>We saw each other occasionally, and when I at last got my
degrees I bought a practice in West Kensington, not far from where
Lydgate had his rooms. He was at that time earning three hundred a
year.</p>

<p>The house I had taken was a tall, gaunt place in an
inconspicuous street. I was unmarried, and the place was obviously
too large for my requirements. So I had the inspiration to suggest
to Lydgate that he should occupy the upper part, and pay me
whatever he was paying for his diggings. He accepted my offer with
alacrity. His mother and sisters were still living in the
country.</p>

<p>The arrangement was full of promise. We had great fun arranging,
furnishing, and decorating the rooms. Lydgate spent his evenings
and Sundays doing all his own painting and decorating, and he also
insisted on doing mine.</p>

<p>I was not convinced that the delicate scheme of grays which he
evolved for my consulting-room, with its frieze of stencilled
peacocks and yew trees, was quite in keeping with the dignity of my
bold brass plate on the front door, but then I knew nothing about
art, and Lydgate was so kind in the matter that I let it pass. I
had a boy to open the door, and an old woman kept the place
reasonably clean, and she used to cook us an evening meal, which we
had together.</p>

<p>That was a very happy time for both of us, and it lasted some
years. My brass plate did not seem to impress the neighbourhood as
I should have liked. Sometimes when I opened the door to people
they used to ask for the doctor. I once attended Lydgate when he
had a feverish chill, and he said my bedside manners were
appalling. But gradually it got about that young Doctor Berners was
not such a fool as you might imagine. Some said that he was a
fairly good, straight, sensible doctor, who took trouble with his
patients. At the end of the first year the practice began to show
signs of developing.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Lydgate had an affair with a married
ballad-singer. I could never quite get to the root of the matter.
Neither could I understand his infatuation. She was a fair, plump
person, with magnificent neck and shoulders, a brilliantly clear
but unsympathetic voice, and an almost unique gift of
self-concentration. She had this wonderful voice, but she knew
nothing, not even about music. She used to wear tiny paste diamonds
early in the morning, and a shiny vegetable silk jumper which made
her person appear even more capacious than it really was. Her name
was Betty Brandt, and she had a husband who travelled in automobile
accessories.</p>

<p>As I say, I do not know the details of this regrettable affair.
I only know that it was very passionate, rather involved, and it
went on for nearly six months. At the end of that time something
happened. Whether they quarrelled, or whether the traveller in
automobile accessories intervened, I cannot say. But Johnny Lydgate
was desperately unhappy. He sulked and moped and would not go out,
except backward and forward to his work. And then, one day, he did
not even go to that. He told me surlily that he had left. He gave
no reason. He sat about at home, and apparently drowned his sorrow
in charcoal and water-colours. He sketched and drew all day, things
which he said he never got an opportunity of doing at "that
confounded shop." I thought it as well to leave him alone. He paid
his rent the first week and then he asked me for credit, which I
naturally acceded.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning I went up to his room, and found the walls
covered with drawings and sketches. In my poor opinion they seemed
to be a brilliant advance on anything he had done before. I said
so, and he seemed pleased, and announced that he was going to hawk
his work around to editors, and try to start up on his own. I
wished him the best of luck.</p>

<p>At the end of a fortnight his campaign had apparently met with a
fair measure of success. He told me he had some commissions and he
hoped soon to be able to let me have some money. The next morning
he came into the dining-room. His face was crinkled with suppressed
laughter, his eyes brilliant with exultant glee. He unfolded a
drawing and held it up on the wall. It was a caricature of Betty
Brandt!</p>

<p>It was the most brilliant and, at the same time, the crudest
thing I have ever seen. It was no portraiture, but you could not
mistake it. I had never liked Betty Brandt, and I was on the point
of protesting, and then the realization that this drawing, in any
case, meant the end of the Betty affair, gave me such a feeling of
relief that I laughed almost hysterically. Johnny and I stood side
by side, laughing till the tears rolled down our cheeks. Poor
Betty!</p>

<p>He seemed freer after that, and worked assiduously at the orders
he had in hand. I am afraid they were not very remunerative. It was
a long time before he proffered any further contribution toward the
upkeep of our establishment, and when he did so, it was with many
groans and apologies for the smallness of the amount. I told him
that he was not to worry about it; my practice was beginning to pay
fairly well, and it made a great difference to me to have a
companion.</p>

<p>For a year I observed Lydgate's grim struggle with his artistic
conscience. The point was that for the work he wanted to do there
was no demand. But there was work which he could do for which there
was a demand. The latter gradually absorbed his energies. He
refused to sponge on me. In eighteen months' time he had wiped out
all debts and was beginning to make headway. He appeared to have
resigned himself to a life of steady toil. I found him particularly
companionable at that time. I think the Betty Brandt affair had
done him good. He was calmer, quicker in his sympathies, more
tolerant and reflective. He still had his moments of gay fun; his
capacity for fooling was enlarged, his perceptions and discernments
were more incisive.</p>

<p>When I was thirty and Lydgate twenty-nine we both seemed to have
settled down to a solid professional life. He was making five or
six hundred a year, and had even saved a little. I was making
rather more, and we had improved the conditions of our household.
We now had a "general," as well as a charwoman and a page-boy. On
occasions we actually entertained, bought reserved seats for the
theatre, and went away for week-end jaunts.</p>

<p>And then, without any ostentatious forewarning, Viola appeared
on the scene. She glided into our lives with the inevitableness of
a portent in a Greek drama. She had occupied her place upon the
stage before we had realized the significance of her entrance. She
was the daughter of an old fellow-practitioner, a Doctor Brayscott,
with whom I had been on friendly terms, and who had beeen extremely
kind to me when I started my practice. His wife was dead, but he
and his daughter lived two streets away, and we indulged in those
little social amenities which busy professional people always seem
to find time for&mdash;occasional dinners, a game of bridge, a
little music. Viola sang divinely. I was, of course, the first to
meet her, and I sang her praises to such good purpose that Lydgate
would not rest until he met her. And then, of course, our little
trouble began.</p>

<p>There was never a gentler, fairer, more adorable woman than
Viola Brayscott. She brought into a room a feeling of complete
tranquillity, warmed with the sun-kissed humours of virginal youth,
seeking for ever surprises and revelations, giving out love and
sympathy and drawing it to herself.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you of the agony and ecstasy of those months that
followed. She visited us sometimes with her father, sometimes
alone. We visited her, sometimes together, sometimes alone. It took
some weeks to realize that we both adored her. What was to happen?
Well, I think we played the game fairly. Each knew of the other's
infatuation. It was a fair field and no favour. One does learn
something, after all, at an English public school. We bore each
other no animosity. We took no unfair advantages.</p>

<p>And what of Viola? For some time the pendulum appeared to swing
backward and forward. There was no gainsaying the fact that she was
really fond of both of us. But the pendulum of that tenderer
passion does not swing backward and forward. It has a bias, a
rhythm of its own. And we each knew that the day would come when
the pendulum would not swing back to one of us.</p>

<p>Heigho! I need hardly tell you the outcome of this
contest&mdash;you will have foreseen it already. In the social
arena, when Lydgate chose to shine, I was no match for him. He had
all the advantages of good looks, engaging manners, and that genius
for always being at his best in her presence. He shone and sparkled
and glowed, whilst I sat dumb and dour and angry with myself. I
could not be surprised when the pendulum swung his way and did not
return to me.</p>

<p>They got married the following spring, and after a honeymoon in
Brittany, went to live in a flat at Barnes. We visited each other
occasionally, and the complete success of their union emphasized
the loneliness of my own dismal household. They were devoted to
each other and bewilderingly happy.</p>

<p>When the possessive sense is outraged, work is our only friend
and physician. I worked and worked and worked, and the practice
grew. But, oh, the emptiness of those waking hours!</p>

<p>The following year they had a child, a boy, with those
lustre-blue eyes of the father. Their happiness appeared complete.
Lydgate was still doing reasonably well at what he called his
"solid commercial stuff." He seemed to have put all other ambitions
behind him. As a social problem I would have wagered that there
would be nothing more to solve concerning him&mdash;in short, that
he was going to "settle down and live happily ever afterward."</p>

<p>But the face of the Sphinx is inscrutable.</p>

<p>It all occurred so surprisingly suddenly. I believe its first
inception came about through a caricature he did of Lord Balfour.
Balfour is an easy person to caricature, and this was not one of
Lydgate's best; but the drawing was published in a weekly and
attracted the attention of a well-known Jewish gentleman, who
called himself Maurice Loffley, and who dealt in other people's
brains. He asked to see some of Lydgate's work, and he admired it
extravagantly, especially the caricature of Betty Brandt; but he
said:</p>

<p>"My boy, it's celebrities we want. Famous people. Do some, and
I'll place them for you."</p>

<p>The outcome was not immediately successful. Lydgate did do some,
and some of them were placed; but Mr. Loffley was not very
satisfactory over his business arrangements, and Lydgate ended up
by doing a caricature of Mr. Loffley himself, which was the best
and crudest thing he had turned out since Betty. It was published
in another illustrated weekly, and caused joy to all of Mr.
Loffley's colleagues and rivals.</p>

<p>The success of this rapidly led to others. Apart from his skill
as a draughtsman, Lydgate had a keen wit and an adroit gift of
literary exposition. He worked out some wonderful gibes at various
famous people. His drawings began to be talked about, and to be in
demand by editors and publishers. Their commercial value rose in
direct ratio.</p>

<p>Barely six months after the incident of Mr. Loffley&mdash;could
his name possibly have been Moritz Loeffler?&mdash;Johnny Lydgate
had a one-man show at the Regent Galleries. The exhibition was a
most remarkable success. A publisher bought the copyright of the
entire collection right out, and nearly all the originals were sold
at high prices. The Press came out with headlines about the
discovery of a new satirist. Artists and society people flocked to
see the exhibition.</p>

<p>On the Saturday afternoon following the opening I was in the
galleries, talking to Johnny and his wife and Mr. Burrows, the
owner of the galleries. They were all flushed and excited, and
Viola was looking proud and very pretty.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Burrows dived across the room and returned with a
tall, striking-looking girl. I did not hear Mr. Burrows introduce
her, but, of course, I knew her well by sight. She was a very
famous and intellectual woman, the daughter of one of His Majesty's
ministers. Her photograph was always gracing the illustrated
papers. I saw her shake Johnny's hand, and then I heard her deep
contralto voice exclaim with feeling:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Lydgate, I'm so pleased to make your acquaintance. I
think your drawings are simply gorgeous!"</p>

<p>I could not hear Johnny's reply. They talked for several
minutes, and she passed on. And then I saw him stagger a few steps
and look up at the skylight.</p>

<p>My mind immediately reverted to a certain fateful moment at
Stoneleigh, on that spring day after the inter-house match, when he
was congratulated on his fine play, and I saw upon his face the
identical expression. He was like a man dazed and drunken with the
riches of his own ego. Instead of the open field and the cheering
boys, he was swaying under the narcotic of a more pervading
flattery&mdash;brilliant and clever people, the faint perfume of a
richly dressed woman, admiring and significant glances. "That is
he! That's Lydgate&mdash;Lydgate himself!"</p>

<p>The beautiful and merciless lady had begun to put her spell on
him.</p>

<p>What astonished me was the rapidity with which the poison
worked. Within a few months he became a celebrity. He was just
thirty-three, at the very fullness of his powers. His popularity
was no doubt greatly accelerated by the charm of his personality,
his good looks, genial manners, and quaint humour.</p>

<p>He was immediately "taken up" by a certain Lady Stradling, a
wealthy and adventurous American woman who adored lions. One
invitation led to another. He was always out at some dinner or
reception. He developed the club manner. He joined several Bohemian
clubs, where he became extremely popular. He would give an
entertainment at a drawing-board, making caricatures of people
present and keeping up a running fire of most amusing chatter. He
began to live extravagantly, but even then he was making more money
than he could spend.</p>

<p>At first Viola entered with zest into these manifestations of
social advancement. She accompanied him to many dinners and
functions, but gradually they began to pall upon her, and she let
him go by himself.</p>

<p>I remember meeting him one night the following winter at the
Wombats Club. I was enormously impressed by the change in him. I
was there when he arrived, and I saw him enter the room. He was
still good looking, but his face had become looser,</p>

<p>and a little coarser. He was greeted by cries of "Hallo, Johnny!
Good old Johnny!" "Who is that?" "Don't you know? That's
Lydgate&mdash;Johnny Lydgate!"</p>

<p>He tried to appear impervious to these manifestations, but at
the back of his eye I could detect the slow greedy satisfaction of
the man whose cup of happiness is overflowing. He spoke to me
pleasantly, but his eyes wandered, seeking distinguished names and
faces. He was not particularly proud at being seen in conversation
with a suburban doctor.</p>

<p>"Who is that? Ah, excuse me, old chap; I want a word with Edwin
Wray. Hallo, Wray, old boy!"</p>

<p>Of course, Edwin Wray is familiar to you? You may see his
picture on all the hoardings&mdash;the famous comedian.</p>

<p>Later, Johnny did one of his inimitable sketches&mdash;a huge
success, a wonderful hit at Edwin Wray. Afterward he sat at a table
near me, drinking rum and water. He had developed a rather affected
style of dress, with a voluminous blue and white stock, and peg top
trousers. Occasionally he made a note in a sketch-book, or flung an
epigram at a neighbour.</p>

<p>The din of the club increased. It was difficult to see across
the room for smoke. And suddenly I thought of Viola. Was he
neglecting her? Was he cruel to her?</p>

<p>It was very late when I took my departure, and I was crazy to
say something to him. I did indeed</p>

<p>manage to mumble something to him about this kind of life being
bad for one's nervous energies. He took another sip of rum and
said:</p>

<p>"It's a lovely life, old boy&mdash;a lovely life!" I left him
there.</p>

<p>The memory of that evening disturbed me. I felt that my position
as an old friend justified me in indulging in some course of
interference. A few days later I called, and found Viola alone. I
thought she seemed a little abstracted and self-conscious with me.
We talked of different things, and then I blurted out:</p>

<p>"I think Johnny is having too many late nights. He didn't look
well the other evening."</p>

<p>She bit her lip and said nothing. Suddenly she rose, pressed my
arm, and turned away. She was crying. I went up to her.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Viola, is anything wrong?"</p>

<p>She dabbed her eyes.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;oh, no; it's only that he&mdash;it's just what you
say. Too many late nights, and sometimes he drinks too much, and
has headaches and is sullen; there's nothing else, Tom. He loves me
as much as ever, I am certain. He hasn't the strength, that's
all."</p>

<p>Oh, the beautiful, merciless lady! She took nearly three years
to destroy my friend. You may say that drink was the cause of his
ultimate downfall. Drink certainly accelerated it, but it was not
the basic cause. He was drunk before he began to drink&mdash;drunk
with the rich wine of her charms.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a man destroyed in that way? The spectacle is
not edifying. He went rapidly from bad to worse. The miracle is how
he retained his powers as a draughtsman almost to the end. From a
pleasant good-looking young man he developed into a puffy,
distinguished-looking Georgian roue. The world spoiled him, and he
hadn't the strength to stand up against it. The standards of
morality and behaviour which these other men set up did not apply
to Johnny Lydgate. Oh, dear, no! He was above it all, a thing
apart, a genius, the observed of all observers. Sometimes he would
be out all night. Sometimes he would be lost for days together.
Then he would turn up, be very ill, and go to bed. Viola would
minister to him, and give him hot-water bottles. And he would cry
and become maudlin. He would swear not to do it again. He loved
her&mdash;oh, how he loved her!</p>

<p>And she would stroke his temple and whisper:</p>

<p>"Strength, dear, strength. You must try. Oh, you must try, for
my sake!"</p>

<p>Of course he would try. How ill he felt! And the days passed,
and his physical strength returned to him. Came also the little
whispers of the outside world. An invitation to Lady Stradling's;
telephone messages from anxious publishers; the sale of two
water-colours at a record price; the house dinner at the Wombats
Club. Just this once&mdash;oh, just this once, Viola!</p>

<p>Back he went, lost to the claims of common decency. His face
became lined and blotchy. He trembled in his movements; the veins
in his arms and his hands stood out like knotted cords.</p>

<p>To the very end she tended him, shielded him, mothered him, and
fought for him. The world will never know what that woman suffered
and endured. She says that he was never cruel to her, except by his
neglect and lack of consideration. In his behaviour toward her he
was always tender and passionate, contrite, disgusted with himself.
He knew quite well what he was doing. It was not that he loved
Viola any the less, but that he was clay in the hands of that more
powerful mistress&mdash;the glamour of publicity, to be talked
about, to be pointed at, to be praised in the Press.</p>

<p>Doctor Brayscott and I did what we could. We advised and argued
and cajoled, and even bullied. He had other real friends, too.
Everybody did what he could, but it was of no avail. When he sank
into that last illness from which he never recovered. I visited him
one day, and sat regarding the spectacle of "that unmatched form
and feature of blown youth, blasted with ecstasy." He opened his
eyes and looked at me. He gave me a quick glance of apprehension.
Suddenly he smiled in his old way and whispered:</p>

<p>"It was worth while, old boy!"</p>

<p>Some men are made that way. They must crowd their life into a
capsule and swallow it. They know they are wooing destruction, and
it is "worth while." Not for them the steady rhythm of an ordered
life. The beautiful, merciless lady pipes the tune and they must
dance.</p>

<hr>

<p>In spite of all, Johnny Lydgate remains a precious and endearing
memory to us&mdash;to Viola and me. When I married her, two years
after his death, we went abroad for a while, and on our return I
acquired a practice at Knayling, on the Sussex downs, and there we
built our home. The boy is a perfect joy to us. He has his father's
eyes and vivacious manners, and something of his mother's warmth
and tenderness. The study of his welfare and training is a constant
source of affectionate discussion. What will he become? What lies
before him? We are full of hope and tremulous surmises. Only at
times do the old doubts and fears assail us. He is twenty now, and
next term he leaves Cambridge. On this desk, as I write, there is a
letter from him, written to his mother:</p>

<p class="letter">Mother Dear,&mdash;<br>
<br>
What is all this about the Indian Civil Service? I should simply
hate it. Fancy seeing all one's life in perspective! Knowing
exactly how much you will be earning when you're forty-five;
knowing that you'll get a pension when you're sixty or seventy, or
whenever it is. Who cares what happens when they are seventy! No,
old thing. Tony Stephens is going to Paris to study art. I think I
should like to join him. You know I can draw, don't you? Smithers
thinks my life studies are pretty useful. I have a feeling that I
might do well. Anyway, we'll talk it over when I come down. Crowds
of love, mother dear.&mdash;<br>
<br>
Your loving<br>
Son.</p>

<p>And I sit here, turning it over and biting my pen. He has his
father's lustre-blue eyes. How would you answer this letter? Can
one advise the young?</p>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>20. Straight Griggs</h2>

<p>There was no doubt but that the meeting of the parents had been
a great success. During their seven years of married life Alec and
Barbara Griggs often discussed the regrettable fatality that when
his parents came over on a visit from America to stay with them,
her parents always happened to be abroad. In a way it is not
surprising, because although old Mr. and Mrs. John Griggs were
pretty methodical and punctilious in their way of going on, and
always gave plenty of notice of an intending visit, Barbara's
father, Colonel Whetstone, was one of these restless old gentlemen
with a passion for travel, and his wife shared this enthusiasm. In
spite of his seventy-two years he was erect and agile, and if he
once got the "go fever," go he must, despite any arrangements that
might have been made.</p>

<p>But at last it had come off. Old Mr. and Mrs. Griggs had come
from Florida to spend a couple of months, and Colonel and Mrs.
Whetstone were at home at their house across the valley. The month
was August and the visit coincided with that unusual English
experience&mdash;a heat wave. The weather was indeed glorious.
During the day Barbara was fairly occupied with her three children,
and Alec motored in to Tellinghurst, where he managed the "South
Downs Agricultural Implements Ltd." Consequently the parents were
thrown very much together.</p>

<p>At first Barbara was in a fever of apprehension. One never knew
who was going to get on with whom, did one? But her mind was soon
set at rest. Mrs. Griggs and Mrs. Whetstone, drawn together
instinctively by the adoration of their children and grandchildren,
were soon immersed in each other's company, whilst the two men
struck up an immediate intimacy. Both had travelled and knocked
about the world, and sitting side by side in the shade during the
day, or on the verandah at night, these two, the Colonel, with his
pipe, and John Griggs, with an endless procession of
formidable-looking black cigars, would yarn and discuss world
affairs all day, and half through the night (if they were allowed
to by their women folk).</p>

<p>Barbara was delighted. The whole thing was a great success.
Alec's position at the Agricultural Implement Works was a good one
and the firm was prospering, but neither he nor his wife made any
pretence to their neighbours that it was his income which supported
and sustained "Guestling," one of the most beautiful houses in the
whole of the Sussex Weald. High up, but protected on the north and
east by a thick belt of pine trees, it faced south, with a glorious
view right down the Tellinghurst valley towards the sea. It had
been a farmhouse in a very dilapidated condition when the Griggs
bought it, but had been restored and enlarged by Lutyens. It showed
that scholarly reverence for tradition, combined with the happy
application of material, breadth, airiness, comfort and fine
proportion which one associates with that eminent architect.</p>

<p>It had a sunk rose garden, a Dutch garden, a bathing pool, and
two tennis courts. Perhaps its most attractive feature, however,
was the broad terrace in front of the dining-room. On this was set
a lime-wood pergola, over which trailed azaleas, clematis, and
jasmine. The ground was flagged with broad rough stones, between
which grew exquisite little crimson, white and blue rock
flowers.</p>

<p>It was, of course, Alec's father, John Griggs, who had paid for
all this. He 'vas known to be a very rich man and Alec was the only
child. The Griggs were very popular on the countryside, and though
many may have been envious, no one begrudged Alec "an American
millionaire" father, especially as the hospitality at "Guestling"
was notorious. Whether old John Griggs was actually a millionaire
or not need not concern us. He was certainly a very rich man, but
what the natives of Tellinghurst and district did not know&mdash;or
only a few of them knew&mdash;was that although he was an American,
he was only an American by naturalization. He was born and had
spent the first twenty-three years of his life in England.</p>

<p>Indeed, many English men took him to task for thus forswearing
the land of his birth, but his argument was that, although his
heart was loyal enough to the motherland, you could not spend over
forty years in a country, enjoy all its opportunities of
advancement and make your fortune there, without ceding it whatever
benefits your citizenship might afford. America had made him, and
he was, moreover, indebted to it for the most priceless asset of
his career&mdash;his wife, the daughter of a professor of physics
at Columbia University.</p>

<p>No one seemed to know the details of John Griggs' chequered
career. He had been most things. But it was at St. Louis that he
had laid the foundation of his fortune, first in connection with a
bleaching business and then through a patent of his own known as
"Griggs' Fertilizer."</p>

<p>It was in this city too that he acquired a soubriquet, which had
stuck to him ever since: "Straight Griggs." No one was prouder of
this title than Alec, his son. If his father had handed down to him
one of the most honoured titles in the peerage, it would not have
given him such a thrill of pride as this simple and well-earned
description of his father's character. If his proprietorial
conscience sometimes smote him a little when he looked around the
beautiful house and grounds of "Guestling," he consoled him self
with the reflection that his possession of them was a source of
infinite gratification to the man who had really bought and paid
for that possession&mdash;"Straight Griggs."</p>

<p>During the first fortnight, owing to the excessive heat, the
Griggs hardly went outside the grounds, but the colonel and his
wife, who were used to tropical climates, would come over in the
afternoon, and very often in the early part of the evening the two
elderly gentlemen would have a game of bowls, before settling down
to their usual evening's "pow wow." In the third week the colonel
had to go up to London for four or five days to attend one or two
committee meetings. John went with him in the car to the station,
and their parting had quite a note of melancholy regret. The
colonel said he was afraid he would find the club he was staying at
extremely boring after their delightful talks, while John said
feelingly that he would be all the time looking forward to his
friend's return.</p>

<p>Now if there was one feature about Griggs which had impressed
the colonel more than another it was his innate buoyancy of
disposition. It was a quality which conveyed itself to the
listener. His eyes were the eyes of an incurable optimist. And when
he spoke, in spite of his sixty-three years, the bulk of which had
been spent struggling against adversity, his voice bad almost a
boyish ring. He was full of enthusiasms, sensitive to impressions,
and eager to listen.</p>

<p>It is advisable to keep these facts in mind in gauging the
colonel's apprehensions on the night of his return. He had parted
with "Straight Griggs" in the manner described, and with these
impressions of him indelibly graven on his mind. But on the Friday
night when he returned he was conscious of a subtle change in his
friend. It was not very marked, but it was there&mdash;quite
definitely. He was just as affable, just as prepared to talk and to
listen, but his manner was preoccupied. Some of his buoyancy had
gone, some of his enthusiasm. He was not talking quite so well, or
listening quite so well. Perhaps it was the heat. Sometimes during
the evening his eyes would wander. When they were seated on the
terrace he would let those terrible black cigars of his go out and
then restlessly light another. When the colonel was talking to him
he would suddenly turn and look down the valley, and the colonel
knew that there was something on his mind. Moreover, it was
something which had happened during his absence.</p>

<p>He made occasion to take Barbara on one side, but she knew
nothing. There had been no mail in from America during his absence.
The Griggs had received no letters. How had they spent their time?
Well, Mrs. Griggs had hardly been out of the grounds, but Mr.
Griggs had taken the car out on two afternoons and gone for a run
round the country, nowhere special, that she knew of. The colonel
was perplexed. He returned to the terrace and found his friend
still sitting alone in the dark. He determined to be as matter of
fact as possible. Perhaps this mood would pass.</p>

<p>"Well, John," he said breezily. "I hear you have been for a run
or two in my absence. Where did you get to?"</p>

<p>Without moving his cigar Griggs mumbled:</p>

<p>"Oh, one or two round trips&mdash;nowhere special.
Except"&mdash;he paused and looked away down the valley&mdash;"I
got to the sea, and took a look at Ticehurst and Brynne&mdash;came
back through Wantney and Glendisham&mdash;nowhere
special&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was an awkward little interval. The colonel wanted to hear
more of the story of these wanderings, but he felt that any
interruption might snap their flow. He merely murmured:
"Um&mdash;um;" and refilled his pipe. Then John suddenly got up and
appeared to stroll casually to the window that looked into the
drawing-room. The rest of the family had just settled down to what
had become an evening ritual&mdash;a few casual rubbers of bridge.
It was essentially a family game, in which the three ladies talked
all the time about dressmaking and the bringing up of children,
Alec behaved like a cheerful martyr, and no one seemed to know
whose deal it was, or what were trumps, or what the score was.
John's return to his seat had a more furtive character. He almost
tiptoed. When he had lighted a fresh cigar he leaned forward
confidentially towards the colonel, and the latter noticed that his
eyes had an unusual brightness.</p>

<p>"Colonel," he said quietly, "as you pass through Glendisham,
going east, there is a broad stretch of marshland on your left, but
the road leads up through a pinewood to Worsleydale Common. But
looking down through the trees you can just see the roofs of a long
stretch of rambling buildings, built of granite and slate-coloured
brick."</p>

<p>He stopped, and looked at the colonel as though asking a
question. The latter nodded his head and said almost under his
breath:</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right. Deadmoor prison."</p>

<p>John Griggs turned his head from left to right and back again,
like a large benevolent-looking eagle. He seemed to be assuring
himself thoroughly that he had heard aright. When he spoke again
his voice had a husky quality. "Deadmoor! Yes, I...I knew it
was."</p>

<p>The colonel felt himself on peculiarly delicate ground. His
upbringing decreed that the poking of one's nose into another man's
private affairs was a detestable form of ill-breeding. On the other
hand here was a fellow creature&mdash;and one for whom he had
developed an affection&mdash;obviously anxious to relieve himself
of some oppressive mental load. After a decent interval he said as
casually as he could:</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you knew of it then?"</p>

<p>There was an obvious sense of relief about the face of "Straight
Griggs." He seemed to rejoice that the question had been put to him
so squarely, that in fact the issue had become so defined. Leaning
towards his friend he said in a deep clear voice:</p>

<p>"<i>I escaped from there forty-one years ago last fall.</i>"</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other closely. It was the colonel who
was the more disturbed. He gasped, and repeated under his
breath:</p>

<p>"Good God! Good God!"</p>

<p>Griggs added calmly, as though meditating:</p>

<p>"I don't know how the law stands. Whether there's a time limit
or what. But I suppose if they knew they would put me back."</p>

<p>At this astounding revelation the colonel gave a quick
apprehensive glance at the beautiful house, silhouetted against the
night sky. Through the open window came the sound of Alec's
laughter, and his voice:</p>

<p>"Come on, Mother, you owe me one and threepence. Pay up!"</p>

<p>Griggs spoke more quickly, as though anxious to bridge the chasm
that was suddenly yawning between them.</p>

<p>"You will first of all, of course, wonder what I was doing in
prison. I will tell you in a few sentences. My father died just
after I came down from Oxford&mdash;my mother had died when I was a
small boy. He left me what seemed to be a pretty considerable
fortune&mdash;about £32,000. I was young, high-spirited and I had
no ties. I immediately proceeded to do all those things which
dashing youth regards as 'living.' As you may imagine I had no lack
of friends and acquaintances eager to help me in my anxiety to
dissipate this fortune. Without, I hope, being vulgarly excessive,
I did most of the usual things&mdash;travelled luxuriously,
entertained, and gambled. Incidentally, I'm afraid I gave a lot
away to worthless people.</p>

<p>"Anyway at the end of eighteen months I was astonished to find
that my capital of £32,000 had been reduced to rather less than
£6,000! It was then that I began to make up my mind to pull myself
together. This wouldn't do. I must settle down and find
remunerative employment. And it was then, unfortunately, that I
came in touch with Millingham. Millingham was one of the most
ingratiating people I have ever met. He was tall, good-looking, and
about twenty years older than I. We met, I remember, at a coffee
stall about five o'clock one morning. I told him a good deal about
my position, and afterwards went back with him to his flat in
Golden Square.</p>

<p>"Millingham, it seemed, had a successful outside brokers
business in the City. To cut it short he persuaded me to join him,
and I put £4,000 into his business. I was to have a salary of
£1,000 a year and a liberal percentage on the profits. The job
suited me admirably. I could live comfortably on £1,000 a year. I
was learning a business, and I was still my own master.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid dancing and other dissipations of youth still
claimed a lot of my time, and my hours at the office were rather
irregular. Nevertheless, I did a certain amount of work, and the
whole thing seemed to be going swimmingly. It was two years later
that the dreadful crash occurred. It was September, and I was going
away with a friend to Norway fishing for a month. On the day of my
departure I lunched with Millingham. We lunched lavishly, I
remember&mdash;cocktails, champagne and liqueurs. His hospitality
knew no bounds. About an hour before my train was due to depart he
suddenly said:</p>

<p>"'Why, you never signed those Tilbury and Co. documents. I must
have your signature before you go. If we take a taxi now you just
have time to pop into the office and then have plenty of time for
your train.' I nearly said: 'What are the Tilbury and Co.
documents?' but I wasn't sufficiently interested.</p>

<p>"My mind was on fjords and fishing. We dashed into the office. I
signed everything he put before me, about eight documents in all.
His signature was already on them. I caught my train. I had a grand
time in Norway. It was perhaps as well, for the day after I
returned I was arrested.</p>

<p>"It seemed that I had put my signature to what was nothing more
than an appalling kind of bucket-shop swindle. It came out at the
trial that Millingham's real name was Malini. He had done this kind
of thing once before in New York. He got seven years and I have
never seen him since. As for me what could I say or do? As you know
ignorance is no excuse in the eyes of the law. I did not even claim
not to have read the documents I signed. I made no defence. Legally
I had none. On account of my youth, and the fact that I was
probably influenced by my senior partner, I was let off with two
years.</p>

<p>"Gee! but I <i>was</i> young in those days. I was sent to
Wandsworth first, and when I found myself in that forbidding prison
I set my teeth, and determined to go through with it. I would make
good somehow. I didn't <i>feel</i> a criminal, that was the great
thing, and I was young and buoyant. At the end of four months I was
transferred to Deadmoor. Deadmoor was a less depressing prison than
Wandsworth, but Golly! how the time dragged! The dreadful monotony
of that routine, and then the&mdash;how can I describe it? kind of
filthy undercurrent of confirmed vice running through the bulk of
that unhappy crowd. I lie awake at night now sometimes, and think
of it. It's horrible. Living in it you gradually feel it gripping
you. I don't pretend to know what can be done, but the system's
wrong."</p>

<p>Griggs licked his dry lips and frowned into the darkness.</p>

<p>"It was about six months later that the idea of escape occurred
to me. There was a saying that no man had ever escaped from
Deadmoor. I can quite believe it. I had very little real hope of
escaping. But I felt that the mere effort of trying&mdash;however
much I was punished for it afterwards&mdash;might sustain my
momentary interest in life, and stimulate my self-respect.</p>

<p>"I began to take my bearings. At that time I was put to work
making mailbags in a large building near the centre of the prison.
I was passed daily from my cell to the exercise yard, and then to
the mailbag building, and so back again to my cell, always, of
course, under the eyes of warders. I could not see the slightest
loophole of hope. The outer wall of the prison was a most
formidable-looking structure, about 16 ft. high and crowned with a
close array of steel spikes. About the end of October, however, I
was transferred for two days a week to the laundry sheds. Our
'working party' consisted of about fifteen convicts, and in a long
black shed near the south wall we did all the laundry work of the
prison.</p>

<p>"On the second occasion of my visit there I began to take an
alert interest in certain possibilities that this new situation
offered. The windows of this shed faced north. The door was on the
east side. But on the south side, where there were no windows,
there was a space of less than twenty yards between the shed and
the outside wall. In this space we used to hang out clothes to dry
on clothes lines. I noticed when I was out there that the position
was not overlooked at all except by certain upper cells never
occupied in day time, and by the back windows of the sanatorium.
But it was, I think, these attractive lengths of clothes-line that
put temptation into a young fellow's head.</p>

<p>"I came to the conclusion that this was one of those things that
wanted doing without too much planning and forethought. It must be
like an act of inspiration done at the exact psychological moment.
It came a fortnight later. It was early November, late in the
afternoon, and already getting dark. There was a slight mist about.
I was sent out to collect some runner towels that had been out
there all the afternoon. I found myself alone in this secluded
space. Looking back on it after all these years I simply gasp at my
own coolness and audacity. Without a moment's hesitation I untied
about twenty feet of clothes-line. In a few seconds I had made a
noose at the end of it. I flung it up to the spikes. At my third
attempt the noose caught over one of the spikes. I then tied one of
the runner towels loosely round my neck&mdash;an inspiration this,
as you shall see. It was again only a few seconds before I was at
the top of that wall. But it was then that my more serious
difficulties began.</p>

<p>"In the first place, although in the yard below I was not
exposed up here I seemed to be silhouetted against the sky line for
the whole country to see. I was visible from the upper part of the
deputy-governor's house, the doctor's house, the sanatorium, and
various parts of the prison grounds. It seemed incredibk that I was
not immediately spotted. But I was too occupied to worry about
this. My position was perilous. The slightest slip, and I should be
impaled on those spikes. There was no space for a foothold, and it
looked utterly impossible to leap clear of that wall, which
appeared to slope outwards.</p>

<p>"It was then that my towel came in. I suppose it was again only
seconds, but it seemed an eternity while I twisted it into a kind
of pad. This I perched myself on gingerly on the top of the spikes.
There was still no chance of jumping, so I simply let myself
slither down the side of the wall. I fell with an unholy crash.
When I reached the bottom the skin was torn off both my hands and
arms, and my legs and body were badly cut and bruised, but I
realised that no bones were actually broken. I staggered to my feet
and ran.</p>

<p>"It is a curious fact when I look back on it, and I won't say
whether I should take credit for it or not, that during the whole
of that night's proceedings I never felt any fear. I reckoned the
odds against me about ten thousand to one. I made up my mind to
regard it as a kind of gallop and not to be broken-hearted when
they caught me. Sportsmen aver that the fox enjoys the chase. I
don't know anything about that, but I know that I got a curious
kind of thrill out of it. I seemed to regard myself in a detached
way, like a man looking down from a racestand on an outsider he has
backed.</p>

<p>"Going direct south led, I knew, to the marsh, so I just ran
till I was out of sight, then I made a wide detour and worked my
way to the north side of the prison. As you know, about half a mile
north is a pine wood, as the gradient of the hill begins to get
steeper. As I say, it was getting dark, and I reckoned if I could
make that wood before they caught me, my chances would improve
considerably. The trouble was I had to keep on stopping, hiding and
dodging, because there were a few stray people about. But I must
have had a good quarter of an hour's start before the gun went off.
I knew what that meant, but the immediate danger was that it made
the people I was likely to meet more alert. That confounded prison
garb!</p>

<p>"But my luck held. I knew if I could make the wood, so far as
men are concerned, I could give them a good run for their money,
for that night anyway; but what I didn't like the thought of was
<i>dogs,</i> which I knew they sometimes used on these occasions.
Just before reaching the wood, I had to cross a road and an open
field. A cart came blundering along the road, and I crouched down
under a hedge. While hiding there a sound reached my ears which
gave me a certain satisfaction&mdash;the sound of trickling water.
It was true. After the cart had gone I found a narrow stream by the
side of the field. I stepped into it, and waded over a hundred
yards, until I came to the edge of the wood.</p>

<p>"I reckoned that might put the dogs off a bit. It was beastly
cold and uncomfortable, but as I say I was young in those days. In
the wood I had a good drink of water and a rest. Whether they used
dogs or not I cannot say. I heard no sound of them. In fact I heard
nothing of my pursuers that night. I did not run any more, but
walked quickly, keeping my eyes and ears on the alert. I walked for
about another two hours and then had a rest on a fallen tree trunk.
I felt it necessary to have a kind of committee meeting of one.</p>

<p>"The trouble was I didn't know the country at all, or where I
was, or in what direction I was going. Not that this knowledge
would have been very much use to me. The night was dark, but
although one's eyes get used to it, it was impossible to see more
than one's immediate surroundings. I could, however, just tell
whether I was on a road or a common. After a time I decided to
stick to a narrow road. A road in any case must lead in one
direction, and I knew I was heading north. If I met anyone with a
lantern or a lighted cart or trap I hid in the hedge, otherwise I
did not hesitate to call out a cheery 'good night!' to passing
travellers.</p>

<p>"The sound of my own voice gave me confidence. You must remember
there were no motor cars in those days! I was beginning to get very
hungry, and coming to a field I grubbed up a swede and ate it. It
was better than nothing. I could see that my most urgent problem
was going to be that of clothes. Unless I could get hold of other
clothes the odds were going to remain 10,000 to 1 against me. I
dare not go near a village or habitation. It would mean hiding in
the daytime and travelling at night, both at great risk; and where
and to what end was I to travel?</p>

<p>"In the meantime, how was I to live? With a change of clothes I
could take risks. It would be fatal to be merely seen. I don't know
how long I plunged on through the darkness. Sometimes I tried to
approach some sleeping farm, but I was invariably scared by the
barking of dogs. But passing along my lane at some unholy hour of
the night, I caught sight of a long bungalow-looking building
almost hidden amidst trees. There appeared to be a few dim lights
about the place. I determined to reconnoitre, and avoiding the
carriage drive which led up to it, I got through the hedge, and
approached it Indian fashion, moving noiselessly from cover to
cover.</p>

<p>"When I got near enough I could see that it had the character of
a hospital or sanatorium. Not a very suitable place to burgle, you
may say, but still it held out the possibilities of my most vital
need&mdash;clothes. When I got to the gravel path that ran all
round the outside I took off my boots. I then went carefully across
it and approached a window. To my surprise the window was open
about two feet at the bottom, and the room was dimly lighted by a
gas jet. My first glance told me that my surmise was
correct&mdash;it was a hospital, apparently a small private
hospital. In this room were three beds, only one of which was
occupied, and that at the far end by a man who was asleep.</p>

<p>"I tried to take in the details of the room, and suddenly my
heart gave a jump. On a chair at the end of the man's bed, and
neatly folded up, was a suit of clothes and a collar and shirt!
Acting on my inspirational policy, I was through that window like a
knife. I shot silently out of the room and gripped my treasure. As
I lifted it I caught sight of a small pile of money on the mantel
piece. It is amazing how quickly one's mind acts in cases of this
kind. During my stay in prison I had vowed to myself again and
again that when I regained my freedom I would never do a thing that
was not meticulously honest and straightforward, and here I was
after a few hours' liberty committing a deliberate burglary! At the
same time my instinct of self-preservation was telling me that in
this lay my one chance in the 10,000, while my mind was registering
a decision that these trifles could be easily replaced when I had
made good.</p>

<p>"I had just gripped the money when I heard a brisk step in the
passage outside. If I had darted into the room, my outward journey
was even quicker. When I alighted on the flower bed outside the
window I had to peep back to see what happened. A nurse entered and
after glancing at the patient she went straight to the chair where
the clothes had lain! Then she stopped, and looked puzzled. She
looked on the floor, at the patient, and then around the room. She
was obviously bewildered. Without waiting for her bewilderment to
develop into suspicion of an outside burglary I crossed the gravel
path, collected my boots, sprinted across the garden, got through
the hedge and in a few minutes' time was among the furze bushes of
an adjoining common.</p>

<p>"It was an unpleasantly cold night to change one's clothes in
the open, but excitement kept me warm. I had no matches and I could
not see how much the money amounted to. But this seemed of less
importance than the clothes. They fitted me quite well, and I
stuffed the convict garb as far up as I could into a rabbit hole.
After walking on for another half hour there seemed to be no point
in plunging about in the dark, so I leant against a tree and tried
to get a little sleep. I must have slept an hour or two, for when I
awoke there was a glimmer of light in the sky, which served the
useful purpose of enabling me to locate the east.</p>

<p>"I was soon able to count my stolen money. There was a
sovereign, a half-sovereign, and eight shillings in silver. A very
useful accretion of capital upon which to start my new career!</p>

<p>"I was feeling stiff and very hungry, but when I looked at my
new brown suit my spirits rose. I should now have to risk entering
a town or village. I washed my face in a stream and did my hair as
well as I could with my fingers. I was bothered by having no hat.
Not that I particularly wanted to wear one, but in those days 'the
hatless brigade' was almost unknown, and I feared that this little
defect might make me conspicuous. I decided, however, that when I
came to a town I would amble along the streets very slowly with my
hands in my pockets, as though I had just strolled out of a
house.</p>

<p>"I made for a road and after walking rather less than a mile I
found myself coming to the outskirts of what appeared to be a
fair-sized town. It turned out afterwards to be Brindlehampton. I
passed a policeman, who I thought looked at me questioningly. I
ambled by him, whistling, and to my relief found that he was not
following me. The shops were shut, but a little further on I came
to a sight which gladdened me&mdash;a cheap eating house for
carters and market people. I strolled in and sat down, and a girl
came up to serve me. I ordered two fried eggs, some grilled ham,
bread, butter, marmalade and a pot of coffee.</p>

<p>"Oh, that breakfast! During the whole course of my life I have
never enjoyed such a meal. Afterwards I strolled out and bought
cigarettes, and matches. I then came across a hosiers. There I
invested in a three-and-ninepenny felt hat and a walking stick. The
walking stick was a luxury, but I felt it added conviction to my
make-up. I looked at myself in the long mirror. In my brown suit,
collar, tie, felt hat, with a cane hanging over my arm, a cigarette
in the corner of my mouth, there was nothing about me to betoken
the convict. Strolling up the town, my body sated with good food
and hot coffee, the odds of 10,000 to 1 against me suddenly seemed
to shift to a good level chance. Such is youth!"</p>

<p>"Straight Griggs" sighed. During the whole course of this
narrative the colonel could not but be impressed by the
extraordinary simplicity of the narrator. Having decided to tell
the story be never hesitated. He seemed to be living through the
exploits of that night all over again, and although he must have
done so a thousand times, the recounting of them appeared to give
him a certain boyish satisfaction. On account of "youth" he had
nothing to sigh about.</p>

<p>"I knew of course that the safest place in the wide world to
hide in was London, and thither I made my way. I even had the
audacity to ask a policeman the way to the station, and when he
addressed me as 'sir' I thrilled with delight. I really wonder I
didn't travel up first class.</p>

<p>"In London I made for the inconspicuous neighbourhood of Camden
Town, and took a furnished bedroom in a meagre street. I paid the
landlady a week's rent in advance and told her my luggage was on
its way from Scotland. It was impossible, of course, to make any
definite plans. My immediate problem was to remain hidden until the
keenness on my search had somewhat abated. Later on I might manage
to get out of the country. In the meantime it would be necessary to
get some kind of job&mdash;however menial&mdash;in order to keep
body and soul together, and at the same time not to mix among a
crowd of men, any one of whom might recognize me from my
photograph, which had appeared in the newspapers. I must say I had
managed to alter my appearance pretty considerably, from the
photograph.</p>

<p>"My luck was in. Two days later I heard from a man on a seat in
the Park about a big rush order a large firm of stationers were
dealing with for some continental government. They wanted men for
all-night work. I called and applied and was taken on at once,
without any question of reference or character. My job consisted
mostly in folding circulars, putting them in envelopes and stacking
them. I had to work on a nine-hour night shift, and I was paid
twenty-five shillings a week. A hard job, you may say, but I
realized that I was lucky. I saw no one but a lot of down-and-out
scallywags like myself.</p>

<p>"Towards the end of the week I had a queer little experience.
Every evening I used to go for a two hours' walk before going on
duty. I walked about the streets, avoiding the more conspicuous and
well-lighted thoroughfares, but I enjoyed this plunge into
adventure. One night I went as far as Oxford Street. I was walking
briskly down Margaret Street when a man who was passing me stopped
and exclaimed: 'Good God!' My heart gave a violent jump as I looked
up. It was Rusbridger. Rusbridger had been one of my pals in the
old halcyon days. He was a good chap, but a bit reckless, and
unfortunately a bit of a drunkard. Many a wild night had we had out
together. Almost instinctively he said: 'Come and have a drink, old
boy.'</p>

<p>"I hesitated. Rusbridger made the situation a little more
dangerous. At the same time I was in no position to flout a man who
might be friendly towards me at that moment. A few minutes later we
were in the corner of a saloon bar. Rusbridger knew that I had
escaped from prison, and of course he wanted me to tell him
everything. I realized that he only meant well, but I also realized
that he was a dangerous man to tell things to. He was obviously
rather thrilled at the adventure of meeting an escaped convict, but
I was certain that in his cups he would go and tell others all
about me, and they would tell others, and eventually the wrong
person would get to know. I showed my delight at his friendly
greeting, but was a bit evasive.</p>

<p>"At last he remembered he had an appointment. We went out and he
hailed a hansom cab, and got in. Just as he was saying good bye he
thrust his hand in my top waistcoat pocket and said: 'Well, good
luck, old boy!' When he had driven off I found two five-pound notes
in my pocket.</p>

<p>"During the next few days I developed a new obsession. I kept on
thinking of the man in the hospital whose suit I was wearing and
whose twenty-eight shillings I had stolen. I felt an overwhelming
desire to pay him back while I had the opportunity. With Rusbridger
it was different. I could regard the £10 as a gift (he had meant it
as such), or knowing his address, I could pay him back at any time.
I decided to devote the week-end to this act of atonement. We did
not have to work on Saturday night, but were supposed to begin
again on Sunday night.</p>

<p>"On Saturday morning I took the train down to Brindlehampton. I
wanted to be there in good time, for this reason. I should have to
restore the stolen property after dark. I did not know the name of
the hospital, and was not quite certain of its position. I wanted
to take my bearings in daylight. I decided to stay at a cheap
little commercial hotel, to buy a ready-made suit in the town, to
change, make a parcel of the brown suit, put the money in an
envelope inside, and then&mdash;if I had any luck&mdash;just drop
it through the open window.</p>

<p>"There was one thing causing me considerable perturbation. For
the last two days I had been feel ing far from well, and when I
reached Brindlehampton on the Saturday morning I was feeling much
worse. This was the eleventh day after my escape from prison. I
booked my room at the hotel, and then started out to try and
rediscover the hospital. I thought I would leave buying the suit
till I got back. I reached the outskirts of the town and then
realized that it was not going to be any good. My head and back
ached and I could hardly see which way I was going from giddiness.
Somehow I managed to get back to the hotel, and when I got there I
just had the wit to tell the proprietor that I was unwell and going
to bed, and I thought I had better have a doctor. It was as well I
did. I don't remember the doctor coming. I knew I had a very high
temperature and was delirious. I think they gave me sleeping
draughts.</p>

<p>"I seemed to be in a stage of unconsciousness for an
interminable wretched time. At one time I knew they were carrying
me in a stretcher. I got it into my head they were going to bury
me, thinking I was dead. I cried out and struggled. There was a
long interval of blackness after that...Then one night I seemed to
emerge, and look around me. And do you know where I found
myself?"</p>

<p>John Griggs shook his long index finger, as though lecturing a
small boy.</p>

<p>"I found myself in the same room from which I had stolen the
clothes! There was the same man asleep in the corner bed, and I was
occupying the bed next to his. Almost instinctively I looked round
for some sign of the police. 'They've got me all right,' I thought.
But there was no sign of police. After a time the same nurse
entered the room. She came up and smiled. Close to, I could see she
had a kind face. She gave me something to drink, and I whispered:
'Where am I, nurse?' She wouldn't tell me at first, but after a
time I got it out of her. I was in a <i>small-pox isolation
hospital.</i></p>

<p>"To cut this part of the story short for your benefit, for
twelve days I had been wearing the suit just removed from the
small-pox patient in the bed next to me! On the night of my
burglary when I had looked back through the window and saw the
nurse enter she had just come to take all his things to the
disinfecting chamber. Of course, I did not learn this at the time.
I pieced it all together afterwards.</p>

<p>"During my moments of consciousness during the next few days I
tried to anticipate the result of my burglary of the small-pox
hospital. Would it lead to my apprehension? There was nothing at
present to suggest that I was under suspicion. I had given a false
name at the hotel, of course, and was supposed to be a commercial
traveller. I gathered from the nurse that there had been a mild
epidemic of small-pox in the county recently, but it was now well
in hand.</p>

<p>"In this hospital there were only my room companion and my self,
but there were seven women cases in the other section. She told me
that my case was considered a mild one, but that my companion was
very bad. The doctor who visited me twice a day was kindness
itself. But what about the suit? I kept on thinking. When I was
brought in and undressed, did either the nurse or my fellow-patient
recognize it? The latter I could almost dismiss without question.
He was in no state to worry about a suit of clothes. As to the
nurse, I guessed that she would have been too occupied at the time
of the undressing, and if afterwards it struck her that there was
something familiar about the suit, she would hardly suspect it
could be the same one. This would be stretching the large arm of
coincidence too far.</p>

<p>"Besides, there is not, as a rule, anything peculiarly striking
about a man's clothes. She may not even have observed it very
closely before. In this surmise I discovered afterwards that I was
correct. But who would get the suit of clothes when we got well? It
would, I presume, be brought to me. But then, of course, would come
the danger. I could assume that by that time he would be much
better and alert. He would assuredly recognize the suit. Then how
could I explain? It is wonderful how, when one is ill, one's
imagination seems to become so active over trifles.</p>

<p>"I lay there for hours during both the day and the night,
tossing about, and visualizing all kinds of compromising situations
arising out of the brown suit. At the end of another ten days,
however, I gave up worrying, and I noticed that my companion was
beginning to show signs of some slight improvement. He had nodded
and smiled at me on several occasions, and at last we began to have
brief whispered conversations. I learnt that his name was Broome.
He was only a few years older than I, and had followed several
trades. Lately he had been quite successful, I gathered, as a
dealer in brass furnishings, had saved a little money, and was
talking of going out to Canada as soon as he was well enough.</p>

<p>"As the weeks went by it became more and more obvious that, in
spite of the fact that I did not enter the hospital till twelve
days after Broome that, so far as condition was concerned, I had
already overhauled him. His face was still a dreadful sight. I came
through it with only these few little scars on my left chin, and
many people now do not recognize them for what they are."</p>

<p>"I certainly had not," remarked the colonel.</p>

<p>"Brume, nevertheless, was quite hopeful. He had no idea how ill
he was. When he found a difficulty in writing he got me to attend
to his correspondence. There was always a certain amount of trouble
over this. They did not mind us receiving letters, but everything
we sent out had to be carefully disinfected and so on, and so they
didn't encourage us.</p>

<p>"At the end of two months the doctor said that in ten days' time
they would be able to let me go. My mind became active with plans
for the future. What on earth was I to do? I realized that I was a
fool to have escaped from prison. I had only had about another nine
months to serve, and then I could have started out, to work out my
own salvation in my own way. But as it was, I had contracted this
filthy disease and was liable to arrest at any moment. If caught
all this period of liberty would be set against me, and I should
get a further stretch as a punishment. It was, moreover, almost
inevitable that I should eventually be caught. In any case, I could
make no kind of honourable and successful career. My only hope lay
in being able to get out of the country.</p>

<p>"When I told Broome they were going to let me go, he somehow or
other got it into his head that he was to be released on the same
date, and began to make his plans accordingly. He got me to write
to a shipping company for him and book a passage to Quebec. This
was for just three weeks hence. I also wrote and got hold of a
passport which he already possessed. Broome became tremendously
excited. He had, I gathered, saved quite a useful sum of money, and
he had apparently no one dependent on him. He was full of the
fortune he was going to make as a brass furnisher in Canada. He
would talk far into the night, with corresponding rises of
temperature.</p>

<p>"The doctors could not make out what was the matter with him. It
went on for a week like this, and then the thing happened which was
to affect my whole career. Broome died. A curious chap, and I can't
profess to have felt any special interest in him, beyond the fact
that he left in my possession a passport and a second-class single
ticket from London to Quebec! Three days later I calmly donned the
brown suit again and strolled out to the cab that was to take me to
Brindlehamptone Station.</p>

<p>"I had a few busy days in London. The first was devoted to
getting an interview with Rusbridger. The good chap lent me £50.
And so one morning I turned up with a cabin trunk and a valise for
the boat train to Southampton. I felt full of confidence. It was
three months since I had escaped from prison, and the search for me
had probably relaxed, and the attack of small-pox had altered my
appearance, to say nothing of the fact that I had grown a beard. In
any case, I found myself ten days later a free man walking the
streets of Quebec.</p>

<p>"I cannot describe to you the queer sense of thrill I
experienced the first night I strolled about the streets of that
quaint old town. I had a kind of inspired feeling. I was bursting
with hope, determination, and good resolves. I seemed to detect the
hand of Providence in all my later experiences. It was as though I
had been duly punished and warned, but was now to be given another
chance. The escape, the extraordinary coincidence of my burgling
the smallpox hospital, resulting eventually in my free passage to
Canada, the lucky meeting with Rusbridger, all these things seemed
to stimulate my anxiety to make good.</p>

<p>"I don't propose, colonel, to bore you with an account of my
life until I did make good. In no case was it very interesting. Of
course I had my ups and downs, but generally speaking I was lucky
from the first. I worked hard, and discovered that I was no fool,
but the thing I kept foremost in my mind was, even in the smallest
dealings to play straight. I think you&mdash;you know that in later
years I succeeded pretty well. Of course, a fellow doesn't forget,
not entirely forget, not even after forty years. Do you think,
colonel, do you think a thing like that can be entirely lived
down...redeemed, as it were?"</p>

<p>The colonel hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I believe every thing is redeemable. Your wife
knows?"</p>

<p>Griggs nodded.</p>

<p>"I told her before we became engaged." His eyes glowed. "I
believe&mdash;I believe she has almost forgotten. It is so very
long ago."</p>

<p>The colonel nodded, and then in a low voice he whispered:</p>

<p><i>"And so you are Alec Stratford!"</i>
</p>

<p>The expression of utter amazement had hardly had time to fill
the eyes of "Straight Griggs" before he felt his forearm gripped in
a friendly pressure, and the colonel was saying:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. Forgive me, John. I did not mean to be so
theatrical. The temptation was too great. Understand at once that
not a word you have told me will ever pass my lips. Only it is
rather strange. Do you know that at the time of your escape, I had
just returned from the East and had accepted an appointment as
deputy governor of Deadmoor Prison. I had not been there a month
when one of the convicts&mdash;Alec Stratford&mdash;escaped. I got
into trouble about it. In fact, they were so rude to me that I
resigned. I did not mind much. I did not like the job. I remember
the escape quite well. Our cook, an Irish girl, saw you on top of
the wall from one of our upper windows. She did not tell us for two
days, and when I taxed her with this neglect afterwards, she burst
into tears. She said her first instinct was to call out, but when
she saw how young and brave and sad you looked, instead of doing
this she went down on her knees and prayed to the Holy Mother to
spare you. You may care to cherish this vision of Kathleen. She has
since died."</p>

<p>Griggs leant forward, deep in thought. There came the sound of a
piano from the drawing-room. Barbara was playing a Schubert
impromptu. A large white moth fluttered across the table between
the two men. From below there arose the heavy perfume of freesia.
The colonel was continuing in his gentle voice:</p>

<p>"There is one point about which I may allay any fears you may
have. You mentioned about being 'sent back to Deadmoor.' This shows
that on your ride the other day you did not get very near the
prison. If you had you would have observed one striking fact about
it. It is dismantled."</p>

<p>"Dismantled!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Some four or five years ago, owing to the general decrease
in crime the Home Office decided to close four prisons. Deadmoor
was one of them."</p>

<p>"But what are they going to do with it?"</p>

<p>The colonel smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, what does a government do in a case like that? Nothing at
all for years and years. And then&mdash;oh, I don't know, something
happens. The place gets pulled down and disappears. You could
probably buy it yourself for an old song!"</p>

<p>Griggs looked up quickly. He waved his long forefinger in front
of the colonel's face.</p>

<p>"There's an idea in that, colonel," he said.</p>

<hr>

<p>Should you at some time be motoring through Sussex and you pass
through the valley of Tellinghurst, just beyond Glendisham, where
the road turns northward, you will come to a plateau. On this
plateau is a large stretch of intensively cultivated land,
dominated by a low white building of elegant design in the Colonial
style. Around the grounds are numerous glass-houses, potting-sheds,
and so on. At the entrance to the drive a white board with dark
green lettering announces the fact that this is: "The Anne Griggs
Agricultural College for Women."</p>

<p>For a month or so every summer you might observe at odd times a
sprightly old couple walking amidst the flowers, talking to the
superintendent or the students, helping, planning, scheming. No one
seems tore member that in years gone by hardened convicts traipsed
the dead monotony of the exercise yard, where now on that same spot
fresh-complexioned girls move smilingly amidst the flowers, or
stoop in loving solicitude above the soil. Perhaps sometimes the
old man remembers it, but he gives no sign. The leaves fall, and
the soil takes them to its bosom, against the coming of a new and
distant birth. The cycle revolves, and in time everything is
forgotten...</p>

<p>But the soil goes on, producing, producing, indifferent to the
frailties of man, reorganizing neither good nor evil, but eternally
concentrated on the perpetuation of life. And the new birth comes,
and the young buds thrust themselves forward, eager for whatever
life may hold, regardless of the tribulations of the past.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>21. The Little Window of the
Night</h2>

<p>Well, well, what does it all matter? Pass the little silver
spoon. Stir. Stir very gently. For to-night is the night of the
carnival.</p>

<p>Quite soon Denise will be here. I shall hear her step upon the
stair, the click of the latch, and then her gay laugh, and the
mellow sound of that voice which means everything to me in heaven
above and the earth beneath.</p>

<p>"Well, Anton, darling, are you ready?"</p>

<p>Ready! O, God! how beautiful she is. She trembles in my arms.
She is all vivid youth, and all utterly mine. When she is not here
I do not exist, It is all a sluggard twilight; and suddenly she
comes, and the birds are singing in the trees and the kingcups are
glowing in a sunlit meadow. When I look into her eyes I am as young
as she, a strong man of virile purposes. The poignant moment is
all-sufficient. She is mine, and we are a twin-god praising the
beauty of the hour. I feel myself a person of tremendous power. All
that is best in me is newly discovered. I want to pour out all my
strength to serve her. I am breathless for the exchange of
understanding. Small things become charged with pregnant
significance. We create as we look into each other's eyes, and
touch each other's hands. We race along through golden corridors of
time. No other hour has ever been till this. And yet I have heard
men say she is not beautiful. Who am I to judge? It is just that
curve of those smooth cheeks that is Denise and no one else. Just
that little tilted nose, the dark-brown hair, the poise of that
dear chin and neck, the slender figure. It is all hers, and hers
and no other's. And therefore it is mine. And those eyes that await
on me, and are so eloquent, those eyes that never misunderstand me,
that anticipate my thoughts, that interpret my love. And as I watch
her move, and hear her speak, I do not ask whether she is
beautiful. She is Denise. She is the alpha and omega of life. There
could be nothing different. It would be unthinkable...</p>

<p>She sails across the room to me, holding out her arms. She is
wearing a frock of fantastic hues, and in her hair dark-red
poppies. Dark-red poppies!...Yes, yes, of course; to-night is the
night of the carnival!</p>

<p>So vivid are these moments that sometimes I dream she is here
before she actually arrives. I sit by my attic window, watching the
little particles of dust flicker in the pale shaft of sunlight.
Below me I hear the drone and cries of the great city. A woman over
the way is playing that Spanish thing of Debussy's&mdash;<i>Soirée
dans Grenade</i>. It always excites me. I see the sun sinking
behind the mountains. In the courtyard of a dim palace are groups
of people. Three swarthy, dark-featured men are playing the guitar
and the mandolin, their sensual faces grinning in the amber light.
A woman is dancing, quite unconscious of their animal glances. Her
body sways, expressing the subtle <i>rubato</i> in the music.
Figures are moving covertly in the recesses of a balcony. Fireflies
whip the shadows. It is a melody of joy and infinite sadness. The
melody of the life of each one of us...Strange that music should
have this power! And as I listen to it I recall my first meeting
with Denise, for <i>she</i>, too, is a dancer.</p>

<p>No one ever danced quite like Denise. When I first saw her she
was like grass blown by the wind, or blossom falling from an
appletree, or flecks of cloud scudding across the sky at the break
of dawn. She all purity and movement. It is odd how dancing may
express all the emotions, exhaust the gamut of all the senses,
excite, degrade, inspire, elevate. I had been riding since
forenoon. Business in connection with the transfer of one of my
father's estates in Picardy had necessitated it. My father was very
old, and I an only son. Tired and thirsty, I rode into the
courtyard of the inn at Couturet-en-bois. I gave my horse over to a
groom. From the back of the inn came the sound of music. Languidly
I went up to my room. I looked out of the window. I beheld a
pleasure-garden where peasants made merry in holiday season.
Beneath a tree two travelling musicians were playing a country
gigue. On the grass in the open Denise was dancing. And I stood
there and watched, and forgot all about my fatigue and my stiff
limbs. She was little more than a child then, supple, lithesome,
appealing. She had that peculiar genius of all good dancers in that
she appeared to be quite unconscious of her body, and yet to have a
complete control of it. A score or so peasants and travellers were
seated on the grass. In the intervals there was applause and the
buzz of talk. An old man took round a tambourine and collected
money. I waited till the dance was finished, and then I buried my
face in my hands. The figure of Denise had danced its way into my
life, never to be deleted. I rang the bell. To the woman who
answered it I said:</p>

<p>"Who is this girl I have observed dancing in the grounds
yonder?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" replied the chambermaid; "that is Denise Floquet.
She is the daughter of old Leon Floquet.&mdash;a worthless fellow,
Monsieur."</p>

<p>"How worthless?"</p>

<p>"He takes her round the countryside and makes her dance. He
lives on her. Monsieur. For himself, he does nothing."</p>

<p>"The old man with the tambourine?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, Monsieur,"</p>

<p>I thanked her and went down to the common room of the inn. I
made inquiries and found that Denise and her father had gone on. A
mood of melancholy came over me, as though I had lost my dearest
friend. I ate my dinner in silence. Half-way through I pushed my
plate away and went and sat out at the table pleasantly placed
under the trees of the orchard. I sipped my coffee and dreamed of
the little dancer. Three men came and occupied the table next to
mine. We were the only occupants of the garden. I paid little
attention to them, though I was conscious that one was a large,
red-faced man who, judging by his remarks, was a traveller for a
firm of spirit merchants; the other two were local tradesmen. When
they had consumed several liqueurs their conversation became
louder, and I could not help overhearing it. Suddenly I became
aware that the large, red-faced man had made an unspeakable
reference. He was laughing bucolically, and he said something which
I cannot repeat. It referred to Denise. I am a hot-tempered man,
and I sprang to my feet.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;unspeakable traducer, you!" I cried, and I
flung the contents of a glass pitcher of water full in his
face.</p>

<p>I will not recall all the details of that distressing episode.
We were all blind with rage. With the apple blossoms falling all
around us and the birds singing in the trees, we fought&mdash;the
four of us&mdash;among the marble-topped tables and the chairs.
People rushed out of the inn and separated us, but not before I had
knocked the large man senseless and flung him among the
rhododendron bushes. Denise did not know, and never has known, that
I had constituted myself her champion, or the price that I paid for
it. For in the struggle I cut my wrist upon a broken wine glass. It
bled profusely. In the night I became delirious, and a surgeon was
sent for. I developed blood-poisoning. For days I lay in a critical
condition in the bedroom of the inn. And then my old father came to
see me. I shall never forget his coming. You must know that my
father was devoted to me. He had an exaggerated idea of my
character and abilities. My mother had died when I was a small boy,
and my father wrapped his life round mine. He spoilt me in every
way. I could do nothing wrong.</p>

<p>I can see him now as he came shuffling into the room, thrusting
out his thin arms, and mumbling:</p>

<p>"My little boy...my brave heart!"</p>

<p>He would never believe that I was more than a little boy,
although he entrusted me with all the affairs of his estates. He
was educating me in the law, and had a great idea that I was to get
into the Senate. Of the origin of my quarrel we said nothing. I do
not know how much he learnt, but I know that the traveller in
spirits, who was clamouring to set the law on me, was squared. I
saw or heard nothing more of him. It was five weeks before I was
well enough to get about, and by that time the position between my
father and myself became reversed. He was the invalid, and I was
well enough to look after him. As a matter of fact, he ought never
to have travelled. He was very unwell when he started, and it was
only the nervous anxiety and his affection for me which kept him
going. When I began to recover, he collapsed. His heart was in an
extremely enfeebled state.</p>

<p>One evening I was seated at my window. The sun was setting in a
blaze of glory. The fruit blossoms were over, but the bees were
busy among the irises and roses. Suddenly I saw my father enter the
garden. He was carrying a rug. I was about to call out to him, but
somehow I felt constrained to watch him instead. He walked ever so
slowly, dragging one foot after the other. He stood amidst the
flowers, looking round. Then he appeared to sigh, and with great
deliberation he chose a spot under a young birch-tree. He spread
out the rug and lay himself down, facing the setting sun. I don't
know how it was, but his movements fascinated me. They were so
incredibly slow and so elaborate. It appeared to be so important to
choose the exact spot. His thin, straight figure lay so still...so
very still. Something seemed to tell me that my father was
disappointed in me. It was the <i>mise-en-scéne</i> of our little
tragedy. I watched him for twenty minutes, and he did not move;
then, leaning out of the window, I called gently:</p>

<p>"Father...Father!"</p>

<p>And he gave no sign. I darted back into the room. I was
frightened. I felt my heart beating. I sat trembling on the side of
the bed. After a long interval I went back to the' window and again
called:</p>

<p>"Father...Father!"</p>

<p>And the rigid figure remained inert. Then stealthily I crept
down the stairs. I walked across the lawn on tiptoe. I touched my
father's shoulder, and he did not wake. A wood-pigeon cooed
melodiously up above in the branches of an elm. The bees droned in
the young flowers, and the sun went down.</p>

<p>Three months later I was in Paris, studying for the Bar. My
father had left me a comparatively rich man, and the heir to great
ambitions. His name was to be perpetuated upon the scrolls of fame
with the names of the best sons of France. I had not seen Denise
again, and I had tried to dismiss her from my memory. I occupied
luxurious quarters in the Rue Ambrosine, and I was attended by an
old concierge and a valet named Canot. I passed my preliminary
examination with comparative ease, and the work interested me. I
moved in society of various sorts, and indulged in the orthodox
pleasures of my kind.</p>

<p>It was nearly three years later that I again met Denise.</p>

<p>I recognised her at once. It was at Dieppe. I had failed in my
final examinations for the Bar. Something went wrong at the end. I
failed badly. Discouraged and crestfallen, I had gone away with a
party of friends, amongst whom was Monsieur Léon Castille, the
Deputy! He was a good friend to me. He believed in me and trusted
me in my darkest hour. He insisted that there was a great career
for me in the political world. We motored through Brittany and
Picardy. At Dieppe we stayed at the Hotel de l'Univers.</p>

<p>One night after dinner I strolled through the back of the town
alone. I wanted to escape from people of my own world I went into a
little cabaret. It was quite amusing. I have always contended that
the humble cabarets supply better entertainment than the
much-advertised vaudevilles on the English and American plan. I had
no programme, but half-way through a roar of welcome greeted what
was evidently a popular number. The orchestra struck up a
bowdlerised edition of Mendelssohn's Spring Song. The lights went
up. The scene was set with a green cloth background. And suddenly
the joyous figure of Spring itself danced before my eyes. For a
second I wondered where I had experienced this before, and then the
whole thing came back to me&mdash;the pleasure-garden at
Couturet-en-bois! I sat entranced, clutching the arms of my
fauteuil. At the end of the performance I sent round my card.
Almost immediately I was admitted and shown to Mademoiselle's
dressing-room. Two other actresses were with her and a snuffly old
man, whom I recognised as her father.</p>

<p>Denise was examining my card quizzically, and her eyes were
still shining with the excitement of the dance. I bowed, and
said:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, pray forgive me. I had the great pleasure of
watching you dance, three years ago, at an inn at Couturet-en-bois.
Since then I have not had the good fortune to enjoy such an
experience until to-night."</p>

<p>She gave a little cry and looked at me.</p>

<p>"Oh, Monsieur," she cried, "you are extremely gracious."</p>

<p>"May I take the liberty," I hastened to add, "of congratulating
you on your well-deserved success, and of prophesying that even
greater laurels are awaiting you in the temples of
Terpsichore."</p>

<p>One of the actresses laughed at my rather stilted phrases, but
Denise did not take her eyes from mine. Her lips were parted, and
she smiled with friendly wonder. The old man snuffled at my elbow,
and mumbled:</p>

<p>"Some other time, Monsieur. We are engaged for tonight."</p>

<p>What did the old fool mean? I bowed to him and tried to wither
him with a glance. But Denise held out her hand.</p>

<p>"It is extremely kind of you, Monsieur," she said. "I remember
Couturet-en-bois so well. I was born near there. We are staying at
the Rue Bazin, number 47B. It would be so agreeable if Monsieur
would call one morning, and we could discuss the dear country which
I love."</p>

<p>I felt myself blushing as I bowed above her hand. I murmured my
enchantment at the invitation, and promised to call on the morrow.
When I had closed the door I heard the sound of shrill laughter
coming from within. But I knew it was not Denise who laughed.</p>

<p>And on the morrow my convictions were confirmed. I knew that
whatever feelings Denise might entertain towards me she would not
be likely to laugh at me. In the stuffy little apartment of the Rue
Bazin she treated me with a kind of surprised interest. We said
very little. We were like old friends who had known each other for
a long time, and suddenly discovered some new and amazing
revelation of sympathy. She told me of her struggles and ambitions,
and I told her mine. Her disgusting father hovered in the
background like a timid dealer at a sale of second-hand
furniture.</p>

<p>Three days later she was leaving for Amiens, and I managed to
see her once again. I gave her my card. She was to be in Paris in
the autumn at the time when I was putting up for the Senate. She
promised to come and see me. I cannot account for my lack of
enterprise at the time; perhaps our acquaintanceship had been too
brief. I was very young, schooled to a meticulous recognition of
the conventions. I may have been afraid she would misunderstand me,
and that I was taking an unfair advantage of her. But I know that
last morning, as we walked along the <i>plague</i>, and her eyes
reflected the restless movements of the sea&mdash;I knew that I
loved her, and there would never be any other woman for me. And I
could not bring myself to say it. I let her go, the old melancholy
gnawing at my heart.</p>

<p>And that evening I experienced one of the most distressing and
disconcerting moments of my life.</p>

<p>I could not go to the cabaret. My friends had made other social
engagements for the party, and the old tyrant of convention still
controlled me. When I arrived back at the hotel just before
midnight, I found old Floquet waiting for me in the hall. He stood
up as I entered, and indicated that he wanted to speak to me out in
the street. The old rascal had been drinking, without a doubt. He
mumbled to himself and tugged at my arm. When we arrived in an
unlighted corner of the promenade I asked him his business. He said
something about Mademoiselle, but I could not hear very distinctly.
He was almost incoherent. I asked if he had any message for me from
her. He nodded and winked mysteriously. Suddenly he said quite
clearly:</p>

<p>"The price will be a thousand francs,"</p>

<p>I clutched my cane. The promenade seemed to rock. The lights
went swinging away amongst the dim stars. I seized him by the coat
and shook him.</p>

<p>"Pardon, pardon!" he whined. "Let us say five hundred
francs."</p>

<p>He seemed to have an idea I was bargaining with him.</p>

<p>I thrust him heavily against a stone wall, and rushed back to my
hotel. When I look back upon that hour, it seems strange that I
never doubted the old man. I believed his statement that the
message from Denise was that "the price would be a thousand
francs!"</p>

<p>Alone in my room that night I suffered agonies of remorse and
disillusionment. I was like a drowning man from whom the life-belt
had been snatched away. I did not realise till that moment how I
had builded on this hope. It was to be the turning-point. The
sun-bathed meadows lay before me, and then suddenly...all was again
darkness. Two naked alternatives stood out before me. The one, to
end it all for ever. The other, to compromise; in other words, "to
pay the price." I laughed cynically as I contemplated my choice,
knowing full well I had not the courage to do the one, nor the
cruelty to do the other.</p>

<p>The following day my friends and I left for Paris. I was
occupied for the rest of the summer on literary work and
preparations for my political career. I addressed many meetings,
and was congratulated by my political colleagues. In certain moods
I certainly appeared to have the faculty of moving people. My
essays on "Currency" were commended by no less an authority than
Monsieur Duparc, of the Academy. Everything pointed to my failure
at the Bar being entirely obliterated by a more brilliant and
significant career. It would be idle to pretend that I dismissed
Denise from my mind. On the contrary, thoughts of her haunted me
day and night, but to an extent I controlled them. I steeled myself
to the idea that I should never see her again. I closed down the
shutters on that portion of my life.</p>

<p>At the end of September I experienced a great disaster. It was
at the last and most important political meeting I had to address.
The hall was packed to the ceiling. My friend Monsieur Leon
Castille occupied the chair. There was great excitement and
enthusiasm. When I was called on to address the meeting after my
friend had made a long and eloquent address, I suddenly...forgot! I
could remember nothing. I stumbled. I repeated myself. I said the
wrong thing. In the middle of a sentence I sat down.</p>

<p>I was defeated at the polls by a fairly large majority, and I
realised that <i>that</i> career was closed to me. For a long time
I could do nothing. I brooded upon my misfortune. I indulged in
social pleasures and read considerably. All my friends, with the
exception of Monsieur Castille, appeared to lose their confidence
in me. I moved out to Passy. In December I married Madame Ostrovic.
She was a Frenchwoman, but the widow of a Polish officer. If you
ask me candidly, I cannot tell you to this day why we married. We
had nothing in common at all, except that she was musical and I
myself am something of a 'cellist. We drifted together in a certain
social set, where perhaps the others bored us even more than we did
each other. Lisette Ostrovic was older than I, frivolous,
material-minded, and vain. In her way she was handsome, being tall,
dark, and well-developed, with straight firm brows and luminous
eyes.</p>

<p>We went for a protracted honeymoon to Rome, Sicily, and Algeria.
Indeed, the honeymoon was far too long. We stayed in Algeria for
nearly six months. At the end of that time I can say wthout
exaggeration that we hated each other. Poor Lisette! I am not going
to say who was right or who was wrong, but one day in Biskra we had
a terrible quarrel. I need not enter into the nature of it. It is
sufficient to say that the next morning I packed up and left her.
She told me that she forgave me, but that she never wished to see
me again.</p>

<p>It was the end of August when I arrived in Paris. The city was
deserted and very hot. I went back to my old rooms in the Rue
Ambrosine. I had some vague idea of writing a book upon
"International Problems," But when I arrived there I spent most of
my time playing the 'cello. Also I found that, owing to neglect, my
financial affairs had got into serious disorder. An attorney with
whom I had entrusted large blocks of shares and the collecting of
rents, had himself got into monetary difficulties. He came to me
one night with tears streaming down his cheeks, and confessed the
whole matter quite openly. He had appropriated certain funds of
mine to meet his own liabilities. He was in an awful muddle. Poor
old Lavalliere! I could not be angry with him. He was so
distressed. I took him into the library and gave him some
refreshment, and then I played the traumerei of Schumann to him
till he cried again. It was all very painful.</p>

<p>The following day I was sitting alone in the library, looking
through some papers, when Canot entered. He said:</p>

<p>"A young lady requests an interview with you, Monsieur."</p>

<p>I answered idly:</p>

<p>"Show her in here, if she is at all presentable, Canot; for I am
bored."</p>

<p>He retired, and in less than two minutes Denise was standing
before me.</p>

<p>I was so moved I could not get my voice. She bowed, and
said:</p>

<p>"Pardon the liberty I take, Monsieur. You were good enough to
ask me to call and see you last year. I did so, but I did not have
the good fortune to find you in."</p>

<p>"But, my God!" I answered, "they never told me. Did you not
leave your name?"</p>

<p>"I did not like to, Monsieur. I did not think it of any
consequence."</p>

<p>"But, good heavens! child, don't you know&mdash;it's of
tremendous consequence. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell
me?"</p>

<p>Almost blindly I groped my way towards her; then I sat down on a
chair facing her.</p>

<p>"Denise," I groaned, "if I'd only known!"</p>

<p>She did not understand me. She was a little frightened, but very
wistful and sympathetic. Her dear eyes were fixed on me with their
kind, mothering, innocent expression. She was more beautiful than
ever. How could I have believed that message? How could she be
anything but pure and noble, trusting, sublime? Why was I
distressing her like this? Why was fate so cruel? Quite
untruthfully, but with a vague idea of excusing my behaviour, I
blurted out:</p>

<p>"Someone told me you were married!"</p>

<p>A smile tickled the corners of her beautiful eyes. She
replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Monsieur. Not I. On the contrary, I understand that I
have to congratulate Monsieur."</p>

<p>I shook my head, and pandering to the mood of brutal frankness
that came over me, I said:</p>

<p>"You need not do that, Denise. My marriage is a failure."</p>

<p>I observed her start, and an expression of deep sympathy clouded
her pretty face. She stood up and murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm sorry. I'm so&mdash;very, very sorry."</p>

<p>Quite roughly I seized her hands and said hoarsely:</p>

<p>"What of your father?"</p>

<p>She did not resist my rough grasp, but with a tear in her voice
she answered:</p>

<p>"My father died last year, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Ah! Was he&mdash;cruel to you?"</p>

<p>"One does not speak ill of the dead."</p>

<p>I bowed my head. I felt ashamed. Releasing her hands, I choked
out:</p>

<p>"So you are not married? You are not engaged? You are not in
love? Tell me everything. Tell me about yourself."</p>

<p>She resumed her seat on the chair, like a little bird upon a
bough, with its wings at tension ready to fly away. She spoke quite
collectedly:</p>

<p>"No; I am heart-whole. I love my work. I have a good engagement
in Paris. Everyone is very kind to me. For the rest&mdash;I should
never marry a man I did not love and respect."</p>

<p>Love and respect! This remark did not reconcile itself with the
allusion to the thousand francs! Blind fool that I had been!</p>

<p>"Denise, Denise," I murmured, "I am lonely. Don't run away from
me. I want you to be my friend. I want you to trust me."</p>

<p>She held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Of course I trust you, Monsieur," she said simply.</p>

<p>"Call me Anton."</p>

<p>She hesitated. Tears hovered on the brink of her eyes. I
realised that I had been too precipitate. I released her hand.</p>

<p>"Or perhaps you will, one day. Let us meet again&mdash;to-day,
to-morrow."</p>

<p>The next day we drove in the Bois. She lunched with me at Fan
tin's. I called at her tiny flat and took her to the theatre.
Within a week our intimacy was complete.</p>

<p>We were like children. She called me Anton and she trusted me,
and I gave her no cause to regret her trust.</p>

<p>There began then that period of golden bliss, the ecstasy of
which lasts to this day. Life seemed to start for me all over
again. Nothing that had ever happened before was of any account. I
observed life from a new angle. I was swayed by new impulses, keen
desires, and fervid resolutions. Little actions became charged with
joy. We lived quite simply, and derived all our pleasure from the
mere contact of each other's presence. We met every day. She would
call for me, in her neat dove-grey frock. She would say:</p>

<p>"Well, Anton, are you ready?"</p>

<p>I was eager and trembling with the thousand important little
things I wanted to tell her since we had met on the previous day.
But I would be quite calm. I would reach down my hat and
answer:</p>

<p>"Yes, my little wood-pigeon, let us flutter away among the
trees."</p>

<p>And we would stroll away side by side, peeping at each other,
furtively touching each other's hands. We would sit under the trees
in the Luxembourg, and she would tell me all the latest gossip of
the theatre, and the colour her new frock was to be, and what the
<i>maitre de ballet</i> thought of her new dance, and where quite
the nicest omelettes in Picardy are to be obtained, and how she was
going to help her dresser's little boy, who was a consumptive, get
into a sanatorium in the South, and how careful I must be not to
stand in a draught when I called for her at the theatre; and it was
all so very, very&mdash;important.</p>

<p>It was the end of September when I told her that I loved her. It
was in my own room in the Rue Ambrosine. We sat facing each other,
and suddenly I took her hands and I held them over my eyes; and I
said:</p>

<p>"Denise, what are we going to do? I love you."</p>

<p>I felt her hands trembling, and she stood up. She put her arms
around my head and kissed me on the brow.</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered hoarsely; "I know...I know."</p>

<p>I clung to her hands. I dared not look at her. I repeated
helplessly</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?"</p>

<p>I felt her bosom heaving. At length she raised my head and
looked into my eyes.</p>

<p>"Anton darling, you know I love you," she answered, "and I want
to do what is best for you. I want to make you happy. You do not
love your wife, and she does not love you. It cannot be good to go
on like that. At the same time I could not be content to be just
your mistress. Oh, my dear, let us just go on being good friends.
Perhaps, one day&mdash;who knows?"</p>

<p>I kissed her then for the first time, and we clung to each
other, bewildered by the sudden vortex of emotion in which we were
swirled. It was Denise at last who said:</p>

<p>"We must not go on like this, Anton. This must be the last time.
I could not bear it&mdash;"</p>

<p>In October my wife returned to Paris. She wrote to me from Passy
a formal letter concerning business matters. She expressed no wish
to see me. In effect she demanded a settlement. She had apparently
been living considerably above her means. When I had satisfied her
and settled up affairs with my defaulting attorney I found myself a
comparatively poor man. I moved to humbler quarters and sold the
bulk of my furniture. My friend, M. Castille, was good enough to
find me an appointment in the Ministry of Justice, but the salary
was small.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that this change in my fortunes seriously
affected my spirits. On the contrary, I almost welcomed it. I was
so consumed with my love for Denise that nothing else mattered, and
I was relieved that my wife showed no disposition to see me again.
I told everything to Denise, and she was very loyal and
sympathetic.</p>

<p>"So long as I have you they may take every stick of furniture,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Little one," I said, "everything will be well for us. I know my
wife, and I know that before long there will be someone else. And
then I shall be free&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was right in my prophecy with regard to the fact, but wrong
with regard to the time. It is strange how a protraction or
prolongation of time may upset the best-laid plans. In war, in
peace, in love, time is an all-powerful factor. In this duel of
hatred it was my wife who gave way in the main essential, but she
defeated me. For it was nearly four years before I received the
formal intimation that she was living with Henri Martin, and that
divorce proceedings were easily negotiable. And in the
meanwhile&mdash;No, no, no; I would not for one instant have you
imagine that Denise did not remain loyal to me; I would not have
you doubt her purity and sincerity. Four years! Day in and day out
she was my dear and true friend. She stuck to her faith, and to her
principle. She would not marry a man she did not love and
<i>respect</i>. Even in my darkest days, when I was dismissed from
the Ministry of Justice, and reached the bed-rock of my capital,
she believed in me and stuck to me. Even when I lost situation
after situation; when M. Castille deserted me; when I pawned my
furniture; when I wandered footsore through the streets of Paris,
searching for employment, she&mdash;she was the one light in my
darkness. And when everything seemed finished, when I lay alone in
the darkness under the fever, she it was who nursed me, she it was
who bought the food which kept my soul and body together&mdash;she,
the dancing-girl, out of her hard-earned savings!</p>

<p>Four years! Oh God, if it had not been so long! If at our first
meeting I had had the pluck, the courage of my impulse! She might
have saved me from myself. It was time which destroyed me. Time and
the tyranny of habit. And if in the end she left me for another, I
have no one to blame but that other self of mine, which is even now
stirring the milk-white liquid in the glass. Only the little glass
is left me. The little glass in which I see the reflection of that
drawn face. Shall I ever forget that expression in her eyes when
she first began to suspect? the strained anxiety in her voice as
she whispered:</p>

<p>Anton...Anton, what is that...in the little glass?"</p>

<p>So stir; stir gently. Let me once more peep through the little
window of the night. Nothing else is left. It was through the
little glass I found Denise, and through the little glass I lost
her. It was through the little glass I lost my father, and his
fortune, and his fair name. It was through the little glass I found
and lost my wife. It was through the little glass I lost my career,
my position, my friends...everything. And it is only through the
little glass that Denise will come back to me to-night across the
ages. Thirty years ago! And she will be still vivid and young,
fresh and gay, in her fantastic frock, with dark-red poppies in her
hair...She will hold out her arms and say:</p>

<p>"Well, Anton, are you ready?"</p>

<p>Am I ready? Oh, God!...Ay, the musicians have already arrived. I
hear the slow Spanish dance; the carnival is commencing. And no one
at the carnival will dance like my Denise. And I shall hold her in
my arms, and she will be mine, mine, mine!</p>

<p>The particles of dust are drifting through the pale shaft of
sunlight; the shadows are deepening in the meagre room...The stove
is cold. Perhaps soon all will be darkness...darkness and silence;
or vivid lights and the movements of dancing feet.
Denise!...Denise!</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>22. One Thing Leads to
Another</h2>

<p class="cpb">I</p>

<p>"That's all very well," said Mr. William Egger. And after a
pause he repeated: "That's all very well."</p>

<p>In his shirt sleeves, carpet slippers, and embroidered
skull-cap, he shuffled restlessly from the breakfast-table to the
window, in the sitting-room above his general shop. His wife began
to clear away, with the obvious suggestion that it was her place to
make herself scarce. This was a father's duty. The boy stood
sheepishly staring out of the window. The day was going to be
scorching.</p>

<p>Of course it was his duty. It was always a father's duty. He
must be firm, admonishing, a little forensic. And all these things
came a little difficult to William. He was no orator. It was too
early in the morning. He had breakfasted well, and at the back of
his mind lurked the old hint of palliation: "Boys will be boys." He
cleared his throat and rumbled:</p>

<p>"You say pinching apples isn't stealing. You're wrong. Anything
you do becomes a habit. This is the second time Farmer James has
written to complain. That doesn't mean that it's only twice you've
stolen his apples. It means it's only twice you've been found
out."</p>

<p>"I swear it's only twice," said Tom, sulkily.</p>

<p>"That'll do. Don't answer me back. You acknowledge you stole
them. Well, what does it mean? You took what didn't belong to yer.
It's sinful. You steal apples, and it becomes a habit. Perhaps
to-morrow you steal pears, then peaches, then grapes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've never stolen no grapes!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, will yer! It's just a question of&mdash;one thing
leading to another. The downward path, the slippery slope,
the&mdash;er&mdash;Gadarene swine, and so on. If you take these
things p'r'aps one day you'll pinch a little money out of the
till&mdash;my till!&mdash;p'r'aps someone else's penknife,
umbreller, or whatnot. That's not the end. You're slipping down.
Stealing leads to other things&mdash;weakness, giving way all the
time. In the end, drinking, forgery, goin' to the pictures, all the
deadly sins&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Egger had re-entered the room with a brush and crumb-tray
and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Tom's a very bad boy, William. But you needn't drag in all the
deadly sins. One doesn't need to go to hell for pinchin' a few
apples."</p>

<p>William showed annoyance. Just like Agnes&mdash;to put him on to
the job and then interfere.</p>

<p>"I tell yer&mdash;one thing leads to another," he barked.</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's no 'but' about it. Sin is sin, and once on the slippery
path, down yer go."</p>

<p>"It's not so bad as all that," replied Mrs. Egger, quickly.</p>

<p>"What I ses is&mdash;it's not nice it getting about, us with the
shop and that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!...ugh!"</p>

<p>The whole matter might have petered out at that point, but for
the fact that, in the disturbance caused by Farmer James's letter,
Mrs. Egger had left the bacon-dish on the sideboard. On the
bacon-dish were several rinds from their breakfast. Ambling between
the window and the sideboard, Mr. Egger's attention had been
divided between this dish and a company of fowls in the yard below.
The situation was a little too embarrassing to glance at his son.
When his wife stood up in defence of the young man he pretended to
be annoyed, but he was really relieved. He had landed into this
tirade of abuse and admonition, and didn't see quite how to end
gracefully. In a moment of distraction he picked up one of the
bacon-rinds and flung it out to the fowls.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this story it is necessary to drop the
curtain on this domestic scene for the moment and follow the
adventures of the bacon-rind.</p>

<p><br>
The fowls were white leghorns, and from their appearance they fared
sumptuously. Doubtless a small general shop is a liberal found for
scraps, apart from the supply of grain which their kind demands.
But there is something about a bacon-rind that is irresistible to
nearly all living creatures. Dogs will fight to the death for it,
cats desert their kittens, birds and poultry perform prodigious
acts in the way of running, doubling, and ducking. The bacon-rind
is never safe until safely ensconced in the maw of some hungry
champion.</p>

<p>On this occasion three hens rushed at the bacon-rind, and one, a
little longer in the legs than the others, got possession. She
scampered towards the hedge, followed by seven others, clucking and
screaming. Before the hedge was reached the rind had changed
hands&mdash;beaks, rather&mdash;&mdash;three times. The original
bird had regained possession and was about to force her way through
a gap, when the cock flew from a savoury refuse heap and savagely
pecked her neck. Scandalous that a female should be allowed to
enjoy this essentially masculine luxury! There was a
rough-and-tumble in the hedge, and the cock got possession. But do
not think that he was allowed to enjoy his triumph in peace. The
fight was by no means over. So great is the appeal of bacon-rind
that the weak will attack the strong, wives will turn on their
husbands, the desperate will perform feats of valour which no other
incentive could stir them to.</p>

<p>The cock half-flew, half-ran, across the angle of the adjoining
field, followed by five of his screaming females. He knew a thing
or two, and doubled under an alder-bush and entered a narrow
coppice that ran alongside the road. But when he arrived there
three of the hens were still on his track.</p>

<p>Now it is one thing to capture a piece of bacon-rind, but quite
another thing to swallow it. The latter operation requires several
uninterrupted seconds, with the head thrown back. Even at the last
moment a rival may seize the end projecting and a fierce tug-of-war
take place. And that happened in this case. He ran and ran and ran.
He had no recollection afterwards how far he had run, but at last
he seemed to have outdistanced his pursuers. There was a moment's
respite somewhere by the side of someone's kitchen-garden. He threw
back his head, closed his eyes, and began to gulp the succulent
morsel inch by inch. Oh, the ecstasy of that oleaginous orgy! Was
there ever such a rind?</p>

<p>And then, of course, the thing happened! Someone had seized the
end just as it was disappearing, and was tugging it back
energetically. Curse! He opened his eyes and blinked. If it was one
of his own hens, he would&mdash;well, give her a very bad time.
Perhaps kill her, perhaps only neglect her. But, no! As he looked
into his rival's eyes he realized that he was up against a large
brown cock, one of the Rhode Island wretches that belonged to Mr.
Waite, the wheelwright. Venom and hatred stirred in his blood. When
this little matter of the rind was determined he would settle with
this Rhode Island upstart. He was somewhat exhausted and nearly two
inches of the rind had been reclaimed by his rival. Backwards and
forwards they swung, their feathers sticking out with sinister
promise of the real fight that was to follow. The white cock had
regained a quarter of an inch when the rind snapped. He gulped his
remaining portion, and drew back ready for the fray. Both beaks
were lowered, when suddenly the white cock beheld an approaching
terror, a large, savage mongrel dog rushing towards them. With a
scream he turned, flapped his wings, dashed through the bushes, and
left the brown cock to his fate.</p>

<p class="cpb">II</p>

<p>"Jim! Quick! Quick!" exclaimed Mrs. Waite, running out of the
cottage. Jim Waite appeared at the door of his shed, a hammer in
his hand:</p>

<p>"What is it? What's the matter, Ida?" he called out, running
towards her.</p>

<p>"That dog! That savage mongrel dog of the Beans has killed one
of our fowls! O Lordy, it's the cock, too! It's killed the
cock!"</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Look! Running across the road."</p>

<p>Jim Waite was angry. This was not the first time that mongrel
dog of the Beans had raised his ire. It always growled savagely at
him and at his wife and children. On one other occasion he had
found a fowl murdered, and he had had his suspicions.</p>

<p>He ran into the road in pursuit. The dog, scared at first by the
shouts of Mrs. Waite, had left its victim and darted under a
culvert the other side of the road. Jim bent down, picked up a
stone, flung it into the opening of the culvert, and, as chance
would have it, hit the dog on its flank. The dog became angry. It
saw red, and likewise Mr. Waite. It ran out and round him in a
circle, growling, and then made a sudden rush. Jim was a
powerfully-built man, and he brought the hammer down plomp on the
mongrel's skull. It would kill no more fowls.</p>

<p>The matter might have ended there had not Mr. Bean, the retired
corn-chandler, at that moment turned the corner in his dog-cart and
beheld Jim with the hammer in his hand, standing above the corpse
of his pet dog. Now Mr. Bean was a thin, wiry man of rather bucolic
and eccentric temper. Moreover, he had a great affection for this
most unpopular dog of indeterminate breed. Long before he reached
the group he roared out:</p>

<p>"What the devil have you done?"</p>

<p>Equally angry, Mr. Waite roared back:</p>

<p>"I've ridded the neighbourhood of this vile beast that's just
murdered my cock!"</p>

<p>"Your cock! What the devil does it matter about your cock!"</p>

<p>The dog-cart pulled up, and Mr. Bean jumped out. Before either
of the men could say another word, Mrs. Waite pointed to the other
side of the hedge and screamed:</p>

<p>"Look! Our only cock! Your blamed dog's killed it. It's always
trying to bite everyone."</p>

<p>Mr. Bean followed the direction where she was pointing. His
side-whiskers shaking, he exploded:</p>

<p>"Well, then, it was in my ground. If your cock comes into my
ground, my dog is justified in killing it."</p>

<p>"There was another cock there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be damned to that!"</p>

<p>Mr. Waite appeared, a formidable figure towering in the road,
with the hammer in his hand, as he said, savagely:</p>

<p>"You shall pay for my cock!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless Mr. Bean replied with spirit:</p>

<p>"You shall pay for my dog!"</p>

<p>"Dog, you call it? Bah!"</p>

<p class="cpb">III</p>

<p>The attitude of both men appeared threatening, particularly as
Mr. Waite handed the hammer to his wife and began to take off his
coat. What would have been the immediate outcome is difficult to
say. But the uproar and disturbance upset the rather highly-strung
young horse, which began to trot off up the road. Mr. Bean did not
notice this till it had gone about twenty yards. Then he called
after it, but the horse took no notice. So Mr. Bean began to run.
He would probably have caught it, but a little farther on a
farmhand, late for his breakfast, came swinging down a narrow lane
into the road on a solid-tyre bicycle. He did not expect to find a
horse and trap there, and he just ducked under the horse's nose and
his back tyre struck the left shaft, and he was thrown. So far as
the horse was concerned, that put the lid on things. He put back
his ears and bolted, with Mr. Bean a kind of forlorn "also
ran."</p>

<p>The farm-hand picked up his bicycle and swore. Jim Waite picked
up the dead dog, and flung it into Mr. Bean's strip of land. Mrs.
Waite picked up the dead cock, and muttering to Mr. Waite: "Well,
we'd meant to kill this week, anyway," she took it inside and
plucked it while it was warm.</p>

<p>Mr. Bean was a good runner, and he tore down the road, yelling:
"Stop him! Stop him!"</p>

<p>He had lost his dog, and the prospect of losing his horse also
spurred him on. But a young horse, even encumbered by a dog-cart,
can run faster than the fastest man. The distance between them
widened. He could see the dogcart swaying and swerving, but the
horse stuck to the road. Mr. Bean ran over half a mile. It was a
deserted part of the country, and nothing passed him. The horse and
cart were out of sight. He rested for a few moments, and then ran
on. When he had travelled about another four hundred yards he
beheld a group of dark objects at the angle of two narrow roads.
For some moments he could not distinguish what they were, but his
instinct told him that something had happened. On approaching
nearer, he beheld a large car, apparently jammed into the
embankment by the side of the road; his dog-cart appeared to be
hugging its mudguards. Two of three figures were moving about, but
there was no sign of the horse. He rushed up, panting. When within
hailing distance, he called out:</p>

<p>"What's up? What's happened? Where's my horse?"</p>

<p class="cpb">IV</p>

<p>Three busy men turned and regarded him. One was a young
chauffeur. The other two were a curious contrast: a tall,
white-moustached man of the Indian Army type, and a thin, aesthetic
young man in the early twenties.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Bean was in the mood when the great thing he needed in
life was sympathy. He was having a bad morning. It was therefore an
unpleasant shock to have the white-moustached gentleman turn on him
in a blaze of anger and exclaim:</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you? What the devil do you mean, letting your
damned horse and trap rush about the country? My God! you've
buckled both our front wheels, and I've a most important
appointment in forty minutes in Hornborough."</p>

<p>"Where's my horse?" wailed Mr. Bean. "I got out of the trap for
a moment, and he bolted."</p>

<p>"What the devil did you get out of the trap for?" roared the
stentorian individual. The younger man grinned and said,
casually:</p>

<p>"Your horse is all right, old boy. He's trotting about in the
meadow yonder, eating lotus-leaves."</p>

<p>Mr. Bean climbed up the embankment and looked over; and, sure
enough, there was the horse, two hundred yards down the meadow,
nibbling grass in the intervals of staring nervously around. He did
not appear damaged at all, but the left shaft of the dog-cart was
snapped at the base and the wheel badly twisted. Mr. Bean, however,
was not allowed to devote too much attention to his own troubles.
The elder man, whom he heard the other address as "General,"
ordered him down in such a commanding way that he had not the power
to disobey.</p>

<p>"Now, my man, listen to me," roared the parade-ground voice.
"How far is it to Hornborough?"</p>

<p>"Nine miles," replied Mr. Bean, almost involuntarily adding
"sir."</p>

<p>"God!" said the General. "And where is the nearest place we can
get a car?"</p>

<p>"There isn't a garage nearer than Hornborough that I know
of."</p>

<p>"Isn't there anyone in this God-forsaken part of the country who
has got a car?"</p>

<p>"Only Sir Samuel Lemby, and I know he's motored up to town
to-day."</p>

<p>"God!" repeated the General, and, turning to the younger man, he
said: "What the devil are we going to do, my lord?"</p>

<p>It occurred to Mr. Bean that the younger man, addressed as "my
lord," was vaguely amused. He scratched his chin and said:</p>

<p>"It looks like a wash-out, unless we walk, General."</p>

<p>"Walk! Nine miles in forty minutes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we could hire bicycles."</p>

<p>"Bicycles."</p>

<p>The General's face was a study in stupefied outrage. He turned
to Mr. Bean and exclaimed: "Are there no traps about here!"</p>

<p>"Plenty, sir," answered Mr. Bean, who by this time had
completely succumbed to the overwhelming atmosphere of a general
and a lord. "But no trap could do nine miles in forty minutes."</p>

<p>"But what the devil are we to do? The Minister can't wait. The
train won't wait. The House sits at two."</p>

<p>Mr. Bean was enormously impressed. He felt personally
responsible for some mysterious national disaster. He said, weakly:
"I don't know, sir. It's very awkward."</p>

<p>Then a bright inspiration occurred to him. "A racehorse could do
it. Sir Samuel Lemby has race-horses, but he's away, and it's not
likely the head-groom would lend any out for such a purpose."</p>

<p>The eyes of the General started out of his head.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't, wouldn't he? How far is it to this Lemby's?"</p>

<p>"There's the house, just up there, sir. Five minutes'</p>

<p class="cpb">V</p>

<p>The General appeared to be calculating savagely. At last he
turned to the younger man and said:</p>

<p>"Gevennah, it's our only chance. You could do this. You rode in
the Grand National. What you don't know about horses isn't worth
knowing. For God's sake run up the hill. Cajole, bribe,
steal&mdash;do anything to get the horse. Five minutes, say another
five minutes arguing&mdash;half an hour to do nine miles. Perhaps
you can get across country, save a bit, eh? There's just a chance.
The train goes at twelve-thirty-two. Oxted is bound to catch
it."</p>

<p>The young man's face lighted up. A queer smile twisted his
mouth.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "I'll have a shot. Give me the
report."</p>

<p>"Here it is. I'll follow you up the hill as fast as I can move,
in case they want more persuading."</p>

<p>Mr. Bean was left alone with the useless car and the broken
dog-cart. He saw the younger man sprinting up the hill like a
professional runner, and the elder chasing after him like some
valetudinarian crank trying to keep his fat down.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the younger man came slap on the
head-groom and a subordinate leading two silk-coated mares out of
the paddock for a canter. He approached the head-groom and
smiled.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said, "I'm going to ask you to break all the Ten
Commandments in one fell swoop. I am Lord Gevennah, a lover of
horseflesh and metaphysics. The gentleman yon observe coming up the
hill is not training for the Marathon. He is General Boyd-Boyd, of
the War Office Intelligence Staff. You may suggest that War Office
and intelligence are a contradiction in terms, but we have not time
to argue the matter. The point is. Sir Samuel is a very old friend
of the General's and we are convinced that he would come to our
rescue in the circumstances."</p>

<p>The head-groom leant forward and said: "Excuse me, sir, but
would you mind telling me what you're talking about?"</p>

<p>"A very reasonable request. Farther down the hill, at the
cross-roads, you may also observe a car jammed against the
embankment. Both the front wheels are buckled. It is essential that
we deliver a report&mdash;this report, my friend&mdash;to Sir
Alfred Oxted, the Minister. He is catching the twelve-thirty-two
train at Hornborough for London. The report affects the whole
aspect of the argument affecting a Bill that is being discussed in
the House this afternoon."</p>

<p>"What is it you want me to do, sir?"</p>

<p>"I want the loan of that beautiul roan mare which for the moment
your figure so gracefully adorns, for the purpose of riding to
Hornborough."</p>

<p>"What! Lend you one of Sir Samuel's racers!"</p>

<p>"Precisely, my friend."</p>

<p>"Not on your dear life! Lend you Iconoclast to go monkeying
about the high roads on! Why, it's more than my place is
worth."</p>

<p>"Is your place worth more than the interests of the
people&mdash;the vital necessities of the nation?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it. I work for Sir Samuel Lemby. If you
get his permission&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have his permission&mdash;morally. He is one of the
General's oldest friends."</p>

<p>"I've only got your word for it. Sir Samuel paid four thousand
seven hundred and fifty for this mare. It can't be done."</p>

<p>"Come! this is quibbling; time is precious. The General said we
should waste five minutes arguing. But if you will kindly dismount,
I shall still have half-an-hour to get to Hornborough. I promise to
bring the mare back safely."</p>

<p>"It can't be done, my son. For all I know the whole thing may be
a cock-and-bull story."</p>

<p>"Ah! here comes the General. General, I'm afraid our friend
demands security."</p>

<p>"Well, for God's sake give it to him. What the devil does he
think we are?"</p>

<p>"Produce everything you've got, General. Pocket-book, money,
despatches. I will do the same."</p>

<p>The head-groom beheld wallets of notes being produced, and he
became frankly interested. In the end he accepted a bribe of two
hundred and twenty-five pounds in cash for the loan of Iconoclast
for one hour.</p>

<p>"It's an awful risk," he said, dismally, as he dismounted.</p>

<p>"If you do not take risks you will never arrive," replied the
young man, leaping into the saddle. "Without taking risks great
battles would not have been won, colonies founded, discoveries
made. Iconoclast! an excellent name! Come, old friend! Iconoclast,
breaker of idols, shatterer of illusions, trusted enemy to false
prophets! Come!"</p>

<p>He pressed the mare's flanks gently with his knees, and she
responded.</p>

<p>"Only twenty-nine minutes!" roared the General.</p>

<p>The young man turned a laughing face and waved his hand. His
progress was visible to the anxious General's eye for nearly half a
mile. The narrow road flanked a sixty-acre field and led into a
bridle-path through a chain of little coppices. By taking this
bridle-path, the head-groom had explained that he would save a mile
or two, as well as the horse's feet. The last they saw of him, he
appeared to be leaning over, whispering in the mare's ear.
Iconoclast was travelling like the wind.</p>

<p>It was certainly a very beautiful ride. The bridle-path, which
once had been a Roman road, ran for nearly six miles in almost a
dead straight line. The ground was gently undulating. Woods flashed
by, and open spaces, commons with sparse trees, sandy cuttings with
gorse and furze projecting at tantalizing angles, stretches of blue
distance with cattle grazing, sleepy rivers. On, on, raced this
famous offspring of Babylon and Happy Days (you shall read of her
in Borwell's <i>History of the Turf</i>).</p>

<p>The young man's face was alight with pleasure. Occasionally he
slackened the mare's speed to glance at his wrist-watch. When the
road was reached there were three miles to go, and twelve minutes
to accomplish it. Iconoclast had justified her good name.</p>

<p>"Steady, now, old girl, steady! We're reaching the stormy
outposts of Christian gentlemen."</p>

<p>A sign-post pointed eastward to Hornborough. Fortunately the
road was still what is known as a secondary road. A few cars
flashed by, their drivers a little nervous of this bolting
apparition of man and beast. Hay-carts lumbering leisurely out of
fields were the serious source of danger, men on bicycles, market
carts, all the slow-moving things.</p>

<p>Twelve minutes, eleven minutes, ten&mdash;the road sloping
upwards violently to the headland that looks down on the Horn
valley.</p>

<p>Nine minutes, eight and a half, eight&mdash;the summit reached.
Down below, the sleepy valley, almost impervious to the thrusts of
time. Thus it must have looked in Boadicea's time. A few more
hamlets, a few more cultivated fields.</p>

<p>"Whoa up, old girl!"</p>

<p>The signboard said one and a quarter miles to Horn-borough
Station. One mile and a quarter, and eight minutes to go! His
faith! a worthy beast, this Iconoclast! One mile and a quarter, and
all the way a gentle slope downward. If ever there was a pleasant
sporting prospect, here was one. To travel at the rate so far
maintained would bring the horse and rider to their destination
with some minutes to spare. Away on the horizon appeared tiny white
balls of smoke, like little lumps of cotton-wool being shot out of
a toy gun. It was the train. He again consulted his wrist-watch and
estimated the distance. "It's four minutes late!" he exclaimed, a
shade of disappointment in his voice. It would appear, in any case,
not an occasion to tarry. One mile and a quarter, and twelve
minutes to go. But, curiously enough, the young man seemed in no
hurry. He tethered the mare to a gate, on the top bar of which he
perched himself, and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"A glorious ride, Iconoclast, old friend!" he said, stroking the
mare's nozzle. He appeared to be making a careful calculation, his
eyes wandering from the little blobs of cotton-wool to his watch.
After some minutes he flung his cigarette away, and again took to
the saddle. The last mile and a quarter was done at express speed,
but certainly not at the greatest speed of which the mare was
capable. The rider seemed a little agitated by some meticulous
calculation. Some of the road was covered in whirlwind fashion, but
there were unaccountable slackenings and halts.</p>

<p>When the little market town of Hornborough was reached, the
blobs of cotton-wool arrived simultaneously. There was a furious
ride along the broad High Street, terrifying the owners of booths
and stalls. Shopkeepers ran to their doors, women clutched their
children, and dogs barked. But horse and rider swung round the
corner into Church Street, dashed across Ponder's Green, up the
slope into the station-yard, and arrived <i>just as the train went
out</i>! The whole town must have observed that dramatic ride and
commented on it. A young man, on one of Sir Samuel's
race-horses&mdash;some said it was Iconoclast herself&mdash;racing
to the station to catch the London train&mdash;why?</p>

<p class="cpb">VI</p>

<p>He flung the reins to an outside porter, and dashed into the
station and on to the platform.</p>

<p>"The train has just gone, sir," exclaimed the ticket-collector,
grinning. It may be observed, at this juncture, that there is a
type of individual who loves to impart information of this kind. He
loves to tell you you have just missed your train, or that you are
in the wrong train, or that there isn't another one for four hours.
His supreme idea of joy is to be able to tell you that you have
just missed your last train. It isn't nice.</p>

<p>On this occasion our hero&mdash;for so he surely must
be&mdash;merely muttered the formal exclamations of disappointment,
and then went back and remounted his steed, after flinging the
improvised groom a purse of gold. (No, if we remember rightly, it
was a shilling.) Anyway, he galloped back through the town for all
the world to see.</p>

<p>Instead, however, of returning the way he had come, he bore off
to the west and, after ten minutes' ride, cantered up the chestnut
avenue that led to a Georgian house. In the circular drive in front
of the entrance-hall he espied a butler taking a parrot in a cage
out for an airing. He called out:</p>

<p>"Hi, Fareweather, can you hold my mare for five minutes? I can't
stop. Is Miss Alice in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord. With pleasure, my lord. She's in the Dutch
garden, watering the gentians."</p>

<p>Ah! watering the gentians! How like Alice! The Dutch garden was
excellent. It had the added charm of being sunk.</p>

<p>The girl looked up at him with that dreamy,
does-any-thing-else-exist-but-thou-and-I expression, and he crushed
her in his arms. These preliminaries being concluded, she said:</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>And appropriately enough he answered:</p>

<p>"There's a destiny which shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we
will!"</p>

<p>"You look as though you had just invented a new religion."</p>

<p>"And so I have, but I haven't had time to patent it. This
afternoon the Government will fall, and it will be my work.
Religion and opportunity are old bedfellows."</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>"You know the storm that has raged round the Subsidies Bill. It
has been working to a crisis. The Government have staked their all
on squashing the amendment which our people are putting this
afternoon. A delicate subject like this is largely a question of
figures. Figures can be impressive, but a clever man can use them
either way. That is what they've been doing. They have the control
end of statistics, and statistics can be wangled. Over the week-end
I was at Clive Hall. I was supposed to be there for polo, but I
found myself in a mare's nest of conspirators and wanglers.
Brigadiers and carpet-salesmen, they've been all over the country,
drawing up a report."</p>

<p>"Is it a false report, Mervyn?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and no. A report can be false not so much by what it says
as by what it leaves out. See? This was a devilish, wanglish,
naughty, spiteful report, and they were going to spring it on the
House this afternoon, to crush our people's amendment. I didn't
show my hand. I'm only a polo player. I was full of sympathy. A
chutney-biting brigadier named Boyd-Boyd fixed an appointment on
the 'phone with Oxted, at Hornborough Station, for the
twelve-thirty-two. Fie was to deliver the goods. I offered to
accompany him, making the excuse that I had to go to town. Cyril
lent us his car. We had got as far as some God-forsaken spot in the
Weynesham Valley. I was desperate. I couldn't make up my mind
whether to dot the old chap over the head and bolt or whether to
pinch the report and let it blow away, when fate supervened."</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"A horse in a dog-cart bolted. The fool of a man had got out for
some reason or other. In trying to avoid it, our chauffeur ran into
a bank, and buckled both the front wheels. We had nine miles to go,
and there wasn't such a thing as a car in the neighbourhood. The
old Purple Patch nearly went off his nut. Then some magician
produced a race-horse."</p>

<p>"A race-horse?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't it sweet? I jumped at the idea. I knew that it would be
up to me to do the flying handicap stuff, and with the report once
in my possession all would be well. I rode hell-for-leather, and
missed the train gracefully by a minute."</p>

<p>"But what will you do with the report?"</p>

<p>"Give it back. It doesn't matter. It will be too late. Figures
like that are only useful when used at the right moment. To-morrow
the Government will be down, and no one will care a rap about their
blinking old report."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I'm glad I don't have anything to do with
politics."</p>

<p>"You do. You are politics. You are what we fight for, and lie
for, and wangle for. You are religion. You are beauty. Haven't you
heard the saying: <i>Homo solus aut deus aut demon?</i> You are the
rose in the heart of the world. You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Talking about roses, Mervyn, how do you like my gentians?"</p>

<p>"There you go! You always spoil my best periods. Darling, one
kiss and I must away."</p>

<p>"Whither, O Lord?"</p>

<p>"To take the mare back, and face the fury of my bonny
brigadier."</p>

<p>"He <i>will</i> be angry!"</p>

<p>"What does it matter? Did you ever know a brigadier who
mattered? When the big story is told, you'll find he's about as
important as a&mdash;as a&mdash;piece of bacon-rind!"</p>

<p class="cpb">VII</p>

<p>"You didn't ought to have talked to the boy like that," said
Mrs. Egger, as she poured out Mr. Egger's glass of stout at
suppertime. "It's set the boy on thinking; and when a boy like Tom
starts thinking it's&mdash;it's&mdash;bad for his health."</p>

<p>"I like that," replied William, blowing the froth off the stout.
"Why, it was you put me up to it. Didn't you say&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I told yer to give him a good scolding. It would have been
better if you'd boxed his ears. Instead of all this talk."</p>

<p>"What talk?"</p>

<p>"Saying one thing leads to another, and so on."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't it true?"</p>

<p>"In a kind of way it's true. In a kind of way it's silly.
Anyway, it sets him on thinking. I saw him in the shop this
afternoon staring at them cooking-pears. I know he was thinking
about what you said. Now if he took apples to-day, he might take
pears to-morrow. It put the notion there, like. He'd never have
thought of it. And this evenin' he comes up to me and says, 'Mum,
dad said one thing leads to another,' and I says, 'Yes, Tom?' and
he says, 'Mum, what was the first thing from which the other things
come?' Did you ever hear such notions? Pass the pickles, dear."</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>23. The Angel of
Accomplishment</h2>

<p>In reconstructing the sombre story which gathered round the
professional association of those two clever men, James Wray and
Francis Vallery, it is necessary to know a little of their early
life and up-bringing. I am indebted very considerably to my friend,
Timothy Rallish, for the light of his somewhat sardonic perceptions
upon the character of Wray. They were at Marlborough together, and
afterward at Oxford, although at different colleges; Timothy at
Oriel, and Wray&mdash;as one would naturally expect&mdash;at
Balliol.</p>

<p>"I used to like him," said Timothy. "I suppose I was the only
chap who did. They hated him at Marlborough; he was so confoundedly
pious. Up at Oxford it was not so bad. There are always such a lot
of precious people at Balliol; it doesn't stand out so. He was an
idealist, without a conscience, if you know what I mean. He set up
impossible standards, never attempted to live up to them, or to
observe whether any one else attempted to. His contempt for his
fellow-creatures was almost abnormal. I think the whole attitude in
some queer way came out of his music-madness. Music was the
absorbing passion of his life, and even for the best of that he
never appeared to have a very great opinion. I believe he thought
that Bach's compositions were not too bad, and for Beethoven he
sometimes indulged in mild patronage. Schumann bored him, so did
Wagner, and for Chopin's 'sentimental tripe' he had no use."</p>

<p>"I am talking now of Wray between the age of seventeen and
twenty-three&mdash;the age when one's critical faculties are
relentless, when one knows every darned thing, don't you know. I
can't tell why I liked Wray. He did not&mdash;and never
has&mdash;liked me. Perhaps there was something about the
profundity of his discontent which appealed to me&mdash;his
restlessness and detachment. I like people who are dissatisfied.
But there was more than that about him: he was a spiritual wanton.
I believe he would have sacrificed a city full of babies to perfect
one musical phrase. You see, there was no reason at all why he
should have gone up to Oxford. He was only interested in music,
which has never been properly taught there. I think he liked to
compose tone-poems in the society of rich men's sons who were only
interested in sports and rag-time. The contact satisfied some
cynical kink in his own nature. It was certainly nothing to do with
the medievalism of Oxford, which only bored him. O Lord! The things
which bored Jimmy Wray when he was twenty-three!"</p>

<p>"At that time," I asked, "do you know anything of his standard
of accomplishments?"</p>

<p>"Very little," replied Timothy. "Of course I know nothing about
music myself, but people who did know something used to differ
considerably about Wray. I got the general impression that he was
talented in a nebulous kind of way; that he had ideas but that they
were too involved; that he could create atmosphere but that he
couldn't construct. He was a very pretty boy at that time, with a
thin aesthetic face, dark reflective eyes and two pink spots in the
centre of each cheek. He had got out of all sport on the ground
that he had a weak heart. It is certainly true that his
father&mdash;who made a small fortune out of accordion-pleated
skirts&mdash;died at an early age from heart disease. His mother
was a gentle negative kind of woman, who lived at Bournemouth,
knitted things for people, and distributed prizes at Girls'
Friendly Societies. He also had two sisters, one, I believe,
dabbled in Christian Science, the other married a sanitary
inspector. They played no great part in Wray's life, neither did
any of them, or any relative or ancestor, as far as I can find out,
supply any note to account for the peculiarly individual precocity
of James himself. Afterward, when he became famous, the whole
family was almost shocked."</p>

<p>This conversation with Timothy impressed itself on my memory
very vividly, for it occurred just after I had had an interview
with Wray's mother. At that time the study and analysis of
suppressions and complexes had not reached the degree of
fashionable absurdity which it has at the present day, but neurosis
has always been a popular complaint amongst those people unlucky
enough to be able to afford to indulge in it. As an ordinary,
rather over-worked local practitioner, I can only give my opinion
that neurosis only exists amongst that small minority of people who
do not have to fight for existence.</p>

<p>It appears to me that this instinct of fighting for existence is
born in every man or woman. When circumstances rob them of it they
are apt to raise some artificial standard and fight for that, for
fight they must. We have not reached the millennium. During my
thirty-three years' experience in the medical profession I have
never yet met the case of a man or a woman who worked hard for a
living being neurotic, unless his or her constitution was already
undermined by neurotic parentage. You may say that an artificial
standard is as good a thing to fight for as a real standard, and so
it may be. A man who fights for some spiritual cause is certainly
as justified as a man who fights to earn bread and wine. It is all
a question of equipoise. But a man who in Timothy's terms would
"sacrifice a city full of babies to perfect one musical phrase" is
in my opinion a lunatic.</p>

<p>But I am perfectly willing to admit that I may be wrong. For all
I know the whole social fabric may be changing its face values. We
can only act according to our lights. When Wray's mother came and
spoke to me about him I knew nothing about the man. He was
thirty-one then. I can see her now, that gentle old lady, with
silver curls and pleading eyes, extremely confiding and rather
outraged. Such things didn't happen at Bournemouth. But, dear her,
Jimmy had only been to Bournemouth once, and he refused to go again
because&mdash;the trams didn't run on Sundays and it took him two
hours to walk out of the town! Was ever such a ridiculous excuse
offered! He was a dear boy, a lovable, clever&mdash;oh, brilliantly
clever!&mdash;boy, but quite incomprehensible, and with such awful
moods. Then with great solemn shaking curls, bobbing above the
stiff corsets, worse than that&mdash;a terrible temper...cruel,
vindictive, he might do any thing in such moods. She regarded me
alertly. I think she thought I might prescribe some
pills&mdash;they do that in Bournemouth&mdash;one to be taken night
and morning, will cure asthma, sluggish liver or homicidal
mania.</p>

<p>I remarked obligingly that I would see the young man. But how
was that to be done? He lived in Chelsea, a terrible, irreligious
suburb of London, inhabited by artists and others...quite
irresponsible people. Besides, he was so exclusive, so apt to be
rude, even violent and abusive. He detested strangers. He was
altogether so unlike his dear papa, who treated everyone even his
<i>work-people</i> as though they were equals! And then came the
terrible crux of the story. It appeared that on Jimmy Wray's
solitary visit to Bournemouth he had murdered a cat. Not, mark you,
an ordinary stray, vagabond cat, but his mother's cat, his mother's
own darling Pee-Wee. The cat, it appeared, had annoyed him for
several nights when he was sitting up late, trying to compose. He
had warned his mother that something would have to be done. He had
appeared haggard and distraught in the mornings. But Mrs. Wray had
not taken the matter very seriously. Such a trivial affair! Dear
Pee-Wee! He was often like that. He made funny noises in the
night...There were several cats in the neighbouring houses,
doubtless friends of Pee-Wee's. And then one night the appalling
thing happened. Jimmy got up about one o'clock. He went out and
picked up a piece of plank. He beat the cat to a pulp! He had never
been to Bournemouth since. What can you suggest, Doctor
Parsons?</p>

<p>I am quite sure that I should have suggested nothing, done
nothing, had I not soon after come in touch with Timothy Rallish,
who reported upon Wray in the manner I have stated. I was amused to
hear Timothy say that he didn't know why he liked Wray. I knew the
reason. It was because Timothy couldn't help liking every one. He
was that kind of boy&mdash;rather short and stocky, with ingenuous
blue eyes which sparkled at you through enormous gold-rimmed
glasses. He found life absorbing. He had scrambled through Oxford,
accomplishing nothing of note beyond making himself popular. His
people were poor, and on coming down from Oxford he had plunged
into the vagaries of journalism.</p>

<p>He was full of enthusiasms, and was always doing the donkey-work
for some quack. He had a genius for compiling and card-indexing. He
edited and subedited various treatises and anthologies. I remember
that he once wrote a book with the impressive title, "Concentrate,"
for a South African pseudo-medical gentleman, who lived in
Westminster and charged three guineas a visit for the treatment of
concentration. Timothy wrote every word of the book, but when it
was published the author was announced as Mr. Hambro MacManus, and
this red-haired South African Scot who arranged his rooms in such a
theatrical way in Ashley Gardens, and made mysterious passes and
grunts over the back of people's heads, claimed the credit for it,
and also the royalties. Timothy thought the whole episode extremely
amusing.</p>

<p>"I never mind paying for experience," he said. "Poor old Mac! He
was quite wrong in most of his theories, but somehow I liked
him."</p>

<p>When I told Timothy about my interview with Mrs. Wray he was
wildly enthusiastic at the idea of my visiting Jimmy Wray when I
next went to London.</p>

<p>"It's no good going to him as a medical man, or letting him know
that his mother sent you. You must just meet him socially. He is
just possible on occasions. I could easily work it for you. I could
introduce you when you are up in town. You could meet him casually
at the Albatross Club or the Caf&eacute; Royale. I should love to
know what you think of him."</p>

<p>The whole matter passed out of my mind till five months later
when I had occasion to visit London for a few days in connection
with the idea of purchasing a half-practice from an old medical
friend of mine in West Kensington.</p>

<p>Timothy immediately looked me up and reminded me about Wray. His
method was characteristic. He came into my bedroom at the little
hotel at Paddington, and, striking a sentimental attitude, began
humming a well-known popular song. When I asked him what his
particular ailment was he laughed and said:</p>

<p>"Don't you know that tune?"</p>

<p>"I've heard it, I believe."</p>

<p>"That's 'The Sheen of thy Golden Tresses,' the most popular song
of the day, words by Francis Vallery, music by James Wray. How are
the mighty fallen!"</p>

<p>I met Wray that same evening at the Albatross Club. Either
Timothy's estimate of him was distorted, or he had altered
considerably, or else we had struck him on a good night. He was
quite charming to me. His dress was certainly a little affected,
but he was still very good looking, and he had a quiet sense of
fun, and was prepared to listen and to be entertained. I observed
that he was appreciably more friendly to me than he was to Timothy.
He had a curious high, rather squeaky voice as though it had never
cracked, and a laugh that corresponded. I could understand that
this characteristic of him might easily get on one's nerves after a
time. But on the whole I could find little to criticize about the
man or his behaviour. He even invited me to visit him in his rooms
at Chelsea. And there two nights later I met the great Francis
Vallery.</p>

<p>In looking back after all these years, and trying to analyze the
character of James Wray, it is impossible to do so without
associating it with that of Francis Vallery. Their lives and
characters dove-tailed and reacted upon one another in a
bewildering degree. Physically, they were a strange contrast.
Vallery was a heavy, masterful-looking man, with a wide loose
mouth, sloping forehead, and cynical, watchful eyes. He was
normally taciturn, unresponsive, and curiously brusque in his
manners. By comparison Wray seemed slim, debonair, almost
unsubstantial. I do not think they really liked each other from the
first. On that evening when I saw them together in the Chelsea
flat, I could tell by the expression of Vallery's face that Wray's
high reedy voice and laughter irritated him. I also came to the
conclusion before the evening was over that Vallery had a beast of
a temper.</p>

<p>Once an argumentative young student made a remark contradicting
a statement of Vallery's, and I saw the latter's eyes blaze with
anger and saliva ooze to the corners of his large mouth. He said
nothing, however. When we were leaving, the man in the hall handed
him his overcoat the wrong way round. Vallery snatched it angrily
from his grasp and growled. I knew that Wray was also capable of
murdering a cat in a fit of passion, so I said to myself that the
happy association which produced "The Sheen of thy Golden Tresses"
was not very likely to last.</p>

<p>And then comes the strange aspect of the case. The association
between Wray and Vallery lasted for twenty-seven years, and became
a by-word amongst English-speaking peoples.</p>

<p>In justice to the memory of them both I would like to hasten to
add that they never again did anything quite so bad as "The Sheen
of thy Golden Tresses." This song was a little difficult to account
for. It was in a way their meeting ground, the plank from which
they sprang. It was quite understandable Vallery writing the words,
but quite incomprehensible Wray composing the music. It is not
known and never will be known by what method or means Vallery
influenced Wray to suddenly forsake his precious muse and write
this appalling song. For a man who up to that time had considered
Chopin "sentimental tripe" to turn suddenly round and write this
ballad, which was devoid of any subtlety or distinction, is one of
those things one can only state and leave to the imagination of the
reader to account for. Vallery had certainly written a good deal of
sentimental prose tripe at that time, but nothing quite so bad as
that. I think they were both a little ashamed of the song, and
never mentioned it. It was nearly a year before anything else
sprang from their united efforts, and then was produced the musical
play, "The Oasis."</p>

<p>"The Oasis" was a great success and ran at the Lyric for over a
year. It was an astonishingly clever work, notable for its complete
unity. The words appeared to inspire the music; the music was a
vivid expression of the words. You could not think of one without
the other. If Vallery's libretto appeared ingenious and suggestive
of melody, Wray's music had a literary and whimsical flavour of its
own which helped the context enormously. It appeared as though from
two extreme poles both men had gone half way to meet the other.
Vallery had had little education. He was the son of an unsuccessful
bookmaker from Nottingham.</p>

<p>Up to that time he had been known as a writer of jingles and
sporting articles, but in "The Oasis" he displayed a considerable
ingenuity of construction and a really mordant sense of fun. Wray
came halfway down from his pinnacle of involved and atmospheric
experiment to write simple melodic airs. It was rather amusing to
observe in this work, and in others that followed, how he cunningly
employed some of the lesser known themes of the despised Schumann
and Chopin, adapted them, elaborated them and converted them into
"songs of the day!"</p>

<p>Timothy and I, and some of the others who knew them both, were
naturally intrigued to see how the personal side of the association
worked. Timothy offered to bet me five pounds that they would
quarrel and separate within six months. It certainly seemed
remarkable that they did not. It may have been a fortunate factor
that two men working together on these lines do not necessarily
work in the same room. Vallery brought Wray the libretto, and
probably discussed it a little. He was profoundly ignorant of the
technical side of music. Wray wrote the music and the lyrics; his
partner was clever enough to see that these were good and there was
little for him to criticize. They may have discussed joins, and
turns and intervals, but there were no great points of cleavage
over which they would be likely to fall foul.</p>

<p>During the succeeding five years, four Wray-Vallery productions
were staged in London and New York, and companies went on the road
with them. By that time they had established their reputation as a
unique combination. They were beginning to make money and to be big
people in the theatrical world. And Timothy and I were still
awaiting the great quarrel. I had by that time joined my friend
Doctor Brill in West Kensington, so that I was able to indulge
occasionally in the society of Timothy's friends and to visit the
theatre. The Wray-Vallery plays were a constant delight to me. I
really believe that Timothy was more interested in the men than in
their plays. But then he was like that. He would come and report to
me the latest scandal concerning them, and indeed their behaviour
was always open to criticism of some sort.</p>

<p>One evening Vallery was arrested for assaulting the head waiter
at the Amalfi restaurant because he moved his walking-stick from
the corner of the room to an umbrella-stand. He escaped with a fine
and a little gentle bantering from the Press. The more successful
he became the more overbearing became his manners. He hardly
troubled to speak to anyone, unless it was a pretty woman, or
someone to whom it paid him to be polite. Upon Wray the effect was
almost as disastrous, although it touched him in a different way.
His manners in some ways improved, that is to say, he was more
sociable and amenable. On the other hand he became more shallow and
insincere, more of a <i>poseur</i>.</p>

<p>He adopted the garb of the eccentric genius. He was wildly
extravagant, and took parties of girls to the Caf&eacute; Royale,
and to an ornate bungalow he had hired at Maidenhead. He became
less self-opinionated, but it was done as though opinion&mdash;no
one's opinion&mdash;was of any consequence. It was as though he had
lost something and the knowledge of it made him desperate. It was a
known fact that during those early years of their association Wray
and Vallery sometimes quarrelled, but the quarrel never reached an
open rupture. Once Wray appeared in my consulting-room. He was
looking haggard and ill. When I asked him the trouble he said:</p>

<p>"Pm not sleeping, Parsons."</p>

<p>I advised the usual remedies, recommended a complete rest and
change, but as I watched the restless movements of his features I
realized how inadequate is the authority of a medical man. We may
sometimes make a shrewd guess at the basic cause of a disaster, but
no medicine or advice will cure a megalomaniac. Just as he was
about to go he turned to me and with one of his quick appealing
looks he gasped:</p>

<p>"I hate that man, Valery!"</p>

<p>So you see the old faith in the fetish does not die. What did
Wray expect me to do? Possibly he would have been better advised to
have gone to a priest. That is, if he could have found a really
nice impressive priest, any one would have done, if they had only
had sufficient strength of character to change Wray. I thought of
his rather futile old mother and I felt sorry for him. I said what
I could. I tried to persuade him to give up his association with
Vallery. I pointed out that his health was more important than his
material success. It wasn't that, he tried to explain, not just the
material success. He had quite a decent private income (inherited
from his father in the accordion-pleated line). Then what was it?
Wray was quite incoherent. He went off late in the evening, and I
noticed after he had gone that he had left the prescription I had
given him on the table in the hall!</p>

<p>On discussing the matter afterward with Timothy I said:</p>

<p>"What is it that keeps these men together?"</p>

<p>And for all it may be worth I will quote just what Timothy
replied. For Timothy at that time had just married a charming girl,
a former typist to a dental surgeon in Kilburn, and he was becoming
something of a philosopher. This is what Timothy said:</p>

<p>"It is the angel of accomplishment, old man. When people are
working, doing things together, especially if they are doing them
in the face of difficulties, there is always some queer genie which
presides over their affections. Comrades in battle, however opposed
they may be temperamentally...Chaps who row in the same boat, play
in the same team at cricket or football, or are up against things
together. The angel of accomplishment presides over their fate.
It's afterward, or when they lose that united sense of conflict,
that the trouble sometimes comes."</p>

<p>In the light of what followed I found Timothy's remarks
interesting. It was during the production of their sixth success,
"The Apple-pie Bed," that the biggest cloud that had so far
gathered over the Wray-Vallery combination made its appearance.
And, as one might expect, it came in the form of a woman. Lydia
Looe played the part of the ingenue, Myra, in "The Apple-pie Bed."
She was a pretty girl, not quite so ingenuous as she appeared on
the stage, but in any case too good for either James Wray or
Francis Vallery, who were both approaching a rather dilapidated
middle-age. How their rivalry over the charms of this new discovery
never reached a crisis is a mystery to me. I spent a Sunday evening
at Wray's flat when all concerned were present, and the look of
venom that passed between the two men at the slightest success of
either upon the lady's favour was positively frightening. The
competition lasted eight months and Vallery appeared to be
winning.</p>

<p>"If the matter is really settled," I thought, "I shall dread to
pick up my newspaper."</p>

<p>Let me add that all this time the two men were working on a new
play, "The Island in Arabia." Timothy said he had seen the figure
of Wray all muffled up, hanging about outside Vallery's house in
Knightsbridge late at night "looking like an apache." The crash was
surely about to come, but in July the Gordian knot was severed by
Lydia Looe running away with the business manager of a jam and
pickle factory. "The Island in Arabia" was produced the following
month and became one of the biggest successes of the series. We all
hoped that the episode of Lydia Looe would tend to reconcile the
two men, and so apparently it did. But the following year Vallery
publicly accused Wray of swindling him. There was a fearful dispute
between principals and their lawyers and the matter came into
court. I forget the details of the case but it principally
concerned the royalties on the songs published separately from the
score. I know that Wray lost the case and that it cost him
thousands of pounds.</p>

<p>He went on the continent and married a wealthy Hungarian widow,
and we all believed that England had seen the last of him. But as
though not to be outdone in this, Vallery also married. His
marriage was about as disastrous an affair as ever disgraced the
records of a divorce court. It lasted eighteen months, and when
Mrs. Vallery was eventually persuaded to appeal to the courts she
had a most pitiable story to disclose. Not only had she no
difficulty in proving Vallery's guilt of faithlessness, but she
recorded a distressing series of cruelties. He had struck her on
innumerable occasions. He had thrashed her with a belt, locked her
in a cupboard, thrown her out into the garden on a wet night, and
many times threatened her with a revolver.</p>

<p>A few months after the divorce, news came that Wray's wife had
died suddenly under rather mysterious circumstances, in Buda-Pesth.
He returned to London, and three years after this law case Wray and
Vallery were again at work together on a play which was called,
"Wine, Woman, and Mr. Binns." It was one of the most amusing, most
lyrical plays seen in London for a decade, and ran for four hundred
and fifty odd nights. The Wray-Vallery combination then seemed to
make a most surprising spurt. They both settled down and worked
hard. Wray's experience in Hungary, whatever it had been, quieted
him. He became less eccentric, less depraved, in his appetites. On
the other hand, he was rapidly becoming more self-centred, shrewd,
and commercial. He appeared to be obsessed with the idea of making
a huge fortune. Vallery was also not without ambitions in this
direction. And between them they undoubtedly succeeded in grinding
the commercial axe to good purpose.</p>

<p>There is no question but that the series of plays that they
composed during this latter phase were artistically inferior to the
earlier ones, but on the other hand their sureness of touch was
more apparent. To use a hackneyed phrase they knew just what the
public wanted and how to give it to them.</p>

<p>At that time Timothy and I had quite lost touch with them.
Timothy was the proud father of three girls. He had written several
successful novels and stories, and was a reader to an eminent firm
of publishers. I myself had a son and daughter and an increasing
practice. We met frequently and indulged in little social
distractions, but we felt no great desire to seek further the
companionship of these two notorieties.</p>

<p>"They're getting a bit too thick," was Timothy's comment after
reading the details of Vallery's divorce. Nevertheless we still
followed their careers with considerable interest, and there often
came to us stories of their violent differences, of scenes at
rehearsals, ugly threats, and recriminations. On one occasion Wray
wanted to have the whole of their interests put in the hands of a
well-known agent, but Vallery objected. The dispute went on for
months and as usual Vallery had his way. It is said that they wrote
"The Girl at Sea" when they were not on speaking terms, and all the
score and libretto were passed backward and forward through a
lawyer. Still they went on from success to success. Together they
wrote some twenty odd variably successful plays. In one new year's
honour list we found the name of James Wray, the eminent composer,
under the knighthoods. The forces which control the distribution of
honours are as mysterious as the forces which control the stars,
and rather more inexplicable. How Sir James Wray managed to obtain
his title over the heads of many distinguished artists it is
impossible to say. These things are usually accepted with a smile
and a shrug, and a man's rivals are not often perturbed by
them.</p>

<p>But in the case of Vallery the affair reacted disastrously. He
was furious. He took the whole thing as a royal affront to himself.
If Sir James Wray why not Sir Francis Vallery? It is said that the
powers that be have a prejudice against people who have shown up
badly in the divorce court. This was true, but on the other hand
was Wray's private life above reproach?</p>

<p>His colleague's title broke Vallery up, and it certainly did no
good to Wray. They were both now prematurely old men, worn out, and
embittered. They never wrote another play together.</p>

<hr>

<p>Nestling in a hollow among the gentler slopes of the Pyrenees is
a little village called Cambo-les-Bains. No harsh winds ever come
to Cambo. Even in the few months of winter the air is soft and
tender. In February the hedges are aglow with primroses and
violets. In March rhododendrons and magnolias raise their insolent
heads. Thither Rostand, the famous French poet, laid out a dreamy
garden on the proceeds of the success which was to come to
"Chanticler." Alas, poor Chanticler! Somethings survive more
readily in a sturdier clime. Thither come people whose lungs are
not quite the thing&mdash;"just for a month or two, old boy." And
they lie there in camp beds out in the open under the
trees...waiting. It is a good place to die.</p>

<p>Thither one day came Francis Vallery, old and broken in health.
He took the ground floor of the Miramar Hotel, with his own valet,
and cook and secretary. And thither one day&mdash;strangely
enough&mdash;came Sir James Wray. It seems curious that after a
life's enmity they should have been drawn together in the end. It
was Vallery who invited Wray. It appears to me less remarkable that
Vallery should have invited Wray, than that Wray should have
accepted. Vallery was completely friendless. The vicious
associations of his youth were snapped. People of interest had
deserted him. Friends had betrayed him. Wray&mdash;no, Wray was not
his friend, but in any case they had worked together. They knew
each other's frailties. There were a thousand things they could
talk about, discuss...memories. Ah! perhaps the old inspiration
might once more spring forth&mdash;just one more play. It was seven
years now since the curtain had rung down on "The Picador."</p>

<p>But why did Wray go to Cambo? He had friends of a sort, society
people, artists. He was still a figure at dinner parties, first
nights. <i>His</i> lungs were still all right. His hatred of
Vallery was not assuaged. Perhaps he went because he feared him.
All through their association he had been under the spell of the
stronger party. At every great crisis he knew he had given way.
Vallery had him under his thumb from the first. Wray had sworn
never to write again, "not a phrase, not a bar." And yet one day he
took the train from Biarritz and drove up to the little village in
the hills, and there he stayed for seven months.</p>

<p>For the account of the tragic <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of this
visit Timothy and I are indebted to an American gentleman named
Scobie. Scobie had been to Cambo to visit his sister, who was
herself suffering from pulmonary trouble.</p>

<p>On his way back through London he had dined at Timothy's one
evening at Chelsea, and I was the only other guest. Mr. Scobie was
a lean-faced New Englander, with small keen gray eyes beneath
shaggy brows. He had long thin hands, the first fingers of which he
had the habit of shaking at us alternately as he spoke. He was not
anxious to talk about the Wray-Vallery affair. He said he would
rather forget all about it, but as Timothy had inveigled him there
with the express purpose of pumping in the matter, we were cruel
enough to insist. Mr. Scobie had certainly had enough of it. He had
had to give evidence in a French court through an interpreter, and
he had no great opinion either of French courts, their dilatory
methods, or their sanitary arrangements. You see, he was the sole
witness of the actual tragedy.</p>

<p>It appeared that his sister's suite of rooms was in the Hotel
Miramar annex. From her balcony he had a complete view of the South
Veranda, where Vallery spent most of the day. He had spoken to
Vallery once or twice, but finding that he was a "bear with a sore
neck" he desisted and devoted his attention to other hotel
guests.</p>

<p>Then he explained: "The other old boy with the squeaky voice
turned up."</p>

<p>"Sir James Wray?"</p>

<p>"Sure. I didn't take much stock of him at first, I used to hear
him piping away below, and the other occasionally barking back an
answer which I couldn't hear.</p>

<p>"But at last that voice began to get on my nerves. You see I
could hear just what he said, but I couldn't hear the reply. It was
like listening to a man on the 'phone. My! it was a voice. I was
almost on the point of wanting to call out to him to quit. But you
know how it is. If you listen to anyone you kind of can't help
wanting to hear what they are going to say next."</p>

<p>"What sort of things did he talk about?"</p>

<p>"Most every kind of dither, like old men will&mdash;the colour
of a girl's frock in some show put across when he was a young man;
the best place to buy over-shoes; the retail price of whisky. He
was a pretty good hand at whisky, too. He arrived with two cases.
The other man sat watching him. I didn't like them. I tried to get
my sister moved, but the hotel was full. I was away in Paris during
the fall and didn't return for some months. I got back to Cambo
three days before&mdash;the thing happened."</p>

<p>I don't think Mrs. Timothy took the interest in this incident
that we did. In any case she made some excuse about packing up
Christmas presents for the children, and left the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Scobie, Timothy and I, drew our chairs up round the
fire.</p>

<p>"How did you find things when you got back, Mr. Scobie?"</p>

<p>"Identically the same, sir. There were those two old boys still
on the veranda below, sitting some way apart, squeaky voice with
the whisky bottle in front of him letting on about the difference
between merino and linsey-woolsey, or the rise in home rails, or
the name of the girl who used to sell programmes at some
God-forsaken theatre. There was the other man, kind of vague in the
background, growling 'yes' and 'no' or be damned if he knew or
cared. It was November and the weather was heavy and overcast for
those parts. It's a dandy place, except for the sick people."</p>

<p>"What happened on the actual day?"</p>

<p>"It all grew out of the same thing, if you'll believe me. It was
early in the afternoon. I'd been out for a stroll. When I got to my
sister's room, I heard squeaky voice going strong. The other man
was asking him where some place was hard by. Yes, sir, I recollect
exactly now how the thing came through. Squeaky voice said: 'You
remember the villa next to Madam Ponsolle's Epicerie establishment.
There's a flower-pot in the window about the size of a stone
ginger-beer bottle&mdash;well, it's just opposite.' This seemed to
satisfy the big man, and except that he growled: 'Oh, it's there,
is it?' Then he added rather savagely: 'I know the place you mean.
I noticed the flower-pot myself but it's a good three times the
size of a stone ginger-beer bottle.'</p>

<p>"Then, believe me, the trouble began. It beats me why the
argument got them like that. Squeaky voice began to scream that he
had taken particular note of the flower-pot at the time, and he'd
swear it wasn't an inch higher than an ordinary stone ginger-beer
bottle. And each time he said that the bear got angrier and
growled: 'It's three times the size.' The argument raged for an
hour. Squeaky voice pointed out that the other was every kind of
walleyed, bone-headed thruster, and the bear rolled about the
veranda shaking his fist and using language that would have made a
Milwaulkee bartender hand in his checks. The exhibition tired me
and I went in.</p>

<p>"I think they slackened up, too, after a bit. Somewhere away in
the big rooms a meal was cooked. The night came on quick and the
moon broke through the clouds. After dinner Im darned if I didn't
hear them going it again hammer and tongs. 'I'm a judge of size,'
Squeaky was saying. 'There isn't an inch to it.' 'It's damn nearly
four times the size,' roared the other, who you see had raised his
figures. I was near to getting the hotel management on to quelling
the disturbance, but it slackened off. At least, I thought it had.
About ten o'clock I went to my room, which was right at the corner.
I went on to the balcony to take a last breather, and then I saw
the whole darn thing happen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have a little whisky, Mr. Scobie," said Timothy.</p>

<p>"I will, sir, thank you. It seemed dead still. I thought they
had gone in. But suddenly I saw Wray&mdash;that's the man's name,
sure, Wray&mdash;he was crouching in the corner of the veranda just
beneath me, and he had a bottle in his hand. I thought at first it
was a last carouse, then by the light of the moon I noticed he was
holding it by the neck and the bottle was empty. His thin voice
came up to me like a husky wail: 'Blast you, it is just the exact
size.' I could just see the shadowy form of the other man lying
back near the window at the end. He was mumbling: 'Five times as
big!'</p>

<p>"Wray went toward him like a cat. I called out, and I think the
effect of my cry was to get the big man alert to trouble. He was on
his legs by the time Wray reached him. I saw the bottle swing in
the air. Then they came to grips. Gosh! Tve seen men fight,
but&mdash;tables and chairs and glasses were scattered and broken.
I heard the bottle break, but one of them was still holding it by
the neck. Up and down the veranda they rolled and fought and bit.
Just like madmen. Then there was a scream. A man and a woman rushed
out. I went below. The big man Vallery was lying in a
heap&mdash;dead&mdash;his throat cut from ear to ear. Wray was
writhing by his side. He died the next morning: he died
blaspheming. Like a gump I gave out that I'd seen the whole thing
and they nailed me for the inquest. Those French courts of
justice&mdash;ugh! I wanted to forget the whole blamed
thing&mdash;wipe it out of my memory. But there I was nailed, made
to go over and over it again. I never thought it possible to see
such scarlet hate and passion&mdash;just savage beasts they
were&mdash;and all over the size of a flower-pot."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Rallish, just a finger."</p>

<p>The fire glowed in the warm security of the little room and snow
was drifting against the windows. In the drawing-room across the
passage Mrs. Timothy was running her hands over the keys of a
piano. Timothy smiled wistfully.</p>

<p>"Neither Wray nor Vallery ever liked me," he remarked apparently
irrelevantly. Then by way of explanation: "I'm going to have my
revenge upon them. It isn't often that a writer of fiction has
things like that left at his door&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Scobie nodded, and shook his long first finger at him.</p>

<p>"I see your point, sir. Provided you leave me out, the goods are
yours. Here's another small side issue might be useful to you. It
wasn't a flower-pot at all. I verified the fact the next day. It
was a child's red stockinette cap. Just think of it. They only had
to stroll ten minutes up the village street. They could have taken
a ruler, bet each other drinks, laughed the thing off. 'Stead of
that they thought it more amusing to fight with broken whisky
bottles. What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>We sat there staring at the fire. Timothy was sucking at an
empty pipe.</p>

<p>"I can see the explanation," he said at last.</p>

<p>"I should be entertained to hear it, sir."</p>

<p>"You see," said Timothy slowly, "the angel of accomplishment had
deserted them."</p>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>24. The Glow-worm</h2>

<p>Shedlock Graeme was young and very intense. The son of a small
linen-draper at Wolverhampton, he displayed at the grammar school
what his Uncle Roger described as "brains above his class." He was
a shy boy when he went there, without ambitions or ideals. But
after a few terms he found himself confronting a surprising
position, at least it seemed so to him at the first realization.
For the realization came to him that the other boys were
extraordinarily stupid. He had never regarded himself as clever,
but after a time the opaque stupidity of the other boys gave him
pause to think. Was it that they were inordinately dull and stupid
or was it possibly that&mdash;he was clever? They seemed to take
weeks to absorb propositions that were obvious to him at a glance.
The problems of Euclid seemed to him self-evident statements,
hardly worth going over. Why did these other boys forget dates,
historical facts, the rules that govern English construction, the
phenomena of natural science? It was all so easy, so easy to
remember and to reason about. He displayed a grasp of mathematics
that confounded some of the junior masters.</p>

<p>He went through the school like a knife through butter. He won
scholarship after scholarship; at the age of eighteen (he had been
keeping himself for two years) he won a scholarship that carried
him through to a college at Cambridge, that shall be nameless.</p>

<p>He had by this time convinced himself that he was unusually
clever, as so indeed he was. Up to that point his attitude towards
life had been almost an impersonal one. Brains, brains! he amassed
knowledge and information and pigeon-holed it, like a farmer
stacking a rick, more interested in his job than in the
consciousness that it was <i>his</i> rick, nor even wondering what
he was going to do with the rick when it was completed.</p>

<p>He lived with his father and mother and two sisters in a shabby
little villa. His father was a weak, gentle little man, who crept
off to his work in the morning, and returned in the evening,
looking tired out and harassed. His mother was the dominant member
of the household. With the peak of her cloth cap pulled down over
the back of her head, she raged through the domestic struggle from
dawn till night. She went out with her string bag in the morning,
and fought in the open market for cheap cuts of meat, vegetables,
and groceries, which she carried back with her. She bullied the
tradespeople, and haggled over halfpennies. She bullied her
husband, her daughters, and sometimes her son. They kept no
servant, and Mrs. Graeme's work was never done.</p>

<p>Lily worked in a milliner's shop, but Emma, who was only fifteen
and rather delicate, helped her mother in the house, which, in
spite of everything, was kept spotlessly clean and tidy. Shedlock
was undoubtedly Mrs. Graeme's favourite. Her pinched, drawn face,
ever concentrated on the problem of petty economies, sometimes
relaxed in the presence of her son. When he began to win prizes and
scholarships, she did not say much, but she ceased to bully him. He
was granted certain concessions, and little snacks of special food
were reserved for him.</p>

<p>Mr. Graeme was frightened of his wife, and used to defend
himself by an attitude of extravagant pleasantry. Sitting over his
breakfast perhaps a little longer than necessary, and hearing her
clattering down the stairs (she would have breakfasted hours
earlier), he would mutter:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, here comes mother! Behave yourselves, children."</p>

<p>He would make a gulp at his coffee and splutter, and as she
entered, exclaim:</p>

<p>"Good gracious, my dear, I nearly choked."</p>

<p>"Choked!" would snap Mrs. Graeme. "Time some of you choked!" and
she would bang things about and go out.</p>

<p>The girls were flabby creatures, their minds centred on fal-lals
and furtive visits to cinemas. They had neither loyalty nor
rebellion in their hearts. In a way the family hung together. Never
expressing any outward affection, they were nevertheless conscious
of unity. They became perhaps more alive to each other when some
member was away or sick.</p>

<p>Absorbed in his intellectual advancements Shedlock had devoted
little time to the abstract consideration of his family. Eternally
conscious of the general sordidness of their social condition, its
lack of variety, its physical and mental poverty, he only
occasionally experienced emotional stabs. Sometimes when his mother
had been particularly trying, he would lie awake at night and his
mind would react to her petty oppressions. And then he would
suddenly see her as she was, and the conditions that had made her,
and the pathos and the tragedy of her. And his heart would ache
with love and pity for her. After all she was his mother...</p>

<p>He pitied the poor blind, groping figure of his father, and he
loved him, too. He pitied and loved Lily and Emma. He had a kind of
deep animal love for them all, a love he felt the more acutely when
he was tired or discouraged. But when the morning came he would be
glad to be free of the house. The raw light of day had no place for
sentimental reflections. He became virile and real, his active mind
clamoured for new satisfactions. Ambitions were dawning. There were
unknown worlds to be conquered...</p>

<p>It was the news about Cambridge which most profoundly stirred
these personal preoccupations. In his scholastic life he had
accepted success as a natural prerogative. At the back of his mind
was the idea that he would one day slide into a good job, earn a
comfortable competence, perhaps marry, perhaps not...do something
decent for his people, get his mother away from the sweat and fume
of that boiler in the scullery. Help the old man&mdash;as he called
him&mdash;to have a less worrying time, do something for the girls,
give them a holiday, presents, or an introduction to some rich
friend of his who might marry one of them. All kinds of things.</p>

<p>But...Cambridge! To plod on with examinations and gain
scholarships seemed all part of the day's work. But to visualize
actually going up to Cambridge held various disturbing factors.
Knowing little about the prizes open to an academic life, he
instinctively enlarged their scope. It might lead to anything. On
the other hand, Cambridge presented the vision of something quite
distinct from any previous experience. It seemed to suggest a
certain social cleavage.</p>

<p>With his quick mind he could easily envisage adapting himself to
the life of the University. But the vision would be immediately
bi-sected by the incongruous vision of his mother at that
disgusting boiler, or his father slobbering over his food, or even
the girls with their cheap trinkets, feverishly queueing up at the
local cinema.</p>

<p>The mere acquisition of knowledge for acquiring's sake received
its first challenge. What was he doing with the rick? To whom was
he going to sell it? And for how much?</p>

<p>The solution of these problems fortunately could be deferred for
the moment. He could not deny to himself that his whole being was
thrilling with an inward anticipation. His ability had been proved;
the test of his character was to come.</p>

<p>His actual novitiateship to the University career was
unimpressive and a little disappointing. He did not sleep in
college, but in rooms in the town. He attended lectures and had
certain rights and privileges, but he had not been there many weeks
before he sensed the fact that though he might be at the college he
was not of it. There appeared to be slow and subtle processes at
work analyzing and tabulating him. The methods by which he had
arrived there, his birth, parentage and character were mutely
revealed before the tribunal of an iron-bound tradition. No one was
rude to him, no one questioned him; he was just made to realize
that he was not exactly the thing.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this assault on his vanity wounded him
profoundly. He had been prepared to make concessions. He knew that
there would be difficulties of this nature to overcome. But relying
upon his own intelligence and quickness, he had thought that they
might be overcome fairly quickly. Before the term was out he knew
that they could not be overcome at all. He would never be "if" the
University, or University life.</p>

<p>Returning to Wolverhampton for the holidays, he became more
acutely alive to the sordid ménage where he had been brought up. He
even nurtured a sudden resentment and detestation of his family.
Were they to be the white elephant destined to crush his social
career?</p>

<p>He went back determined that, whatever might be his social
failings, no one could prevent him from working, and working like a
madman. He eschewed games and sports, where he knew he was not
wanted, and concentrated on work, whether anyone wanted that work
or not. He neither made advances nor avoided his fellow-students.
He was like a perfectly controlled automaton, working, watching,
concentrating.</p>

<p>It took him two years to establish the fact that he was a
mathematician of no mean order. He won more scholarships, and the
don of his college flung him a few words of praise and
encouragement. And he was all the time aware that the greater his
success in this direction, the looser became the claims of social
kinship. It was as though a voice were whispering: "Oh, yes, we
know all about you and your type. Get on with it. Hurry up, get
your scholarships and clear out."</p>

<p>It was at about that time that he formed one of the only
friendships of his University career. Derrick Andrews was a young
Scotsman, and a scholarship man, like himself. He had been up
longer than Shedlock, but being attached to a different college,
they had only happened to meet quite recently. Derrick, it
appeared, was a red-hot Socialist, and he was astonished at
Shedlock's ignorance of social questions. They spent long hours
together, and Shedlock, who had thought but little on the general
subject, was first of all attracted by the economic side of the
question. When it came to economics he could talk Derrick off his
head. He found to his surprise that there was a Socialist Club in
Cambridge, and there Derrick dragged him, and he listened to all
sorts of strange people, expounding all sorts of strange
theories.</p>

<p>But it was not till the next term that the thing got him hot and
strong. He had won the Smith prize, and his father and mother had
been to see him. It was a dreadful day. His mother was all dressed
up, and his father was wearing brown boots with a black tail-coat.
His mother had been in a bad temper with his father, possibly
because her shoes pinched her. She had shouted about the
quadrangles in her broad Midland voice, and his father had looked
insignificant and pitiable. And they seemed to run into everyone in
the college who knew about him. No one made any remarks, or said
anything at all, but he was aware of the cynosure of general
disapproval.</p>

<p>This&mdash;as he knew they thought&mdash;"put the lid on it." He
felt on edge during the entire time of their visit. He was even
snappy to his mother himself. He heaved a mighty sigh of relief
when they had gone. But at night he suddenly thought of his
mother's face, lined and scarred by sixty years of uncongenial
tasks and sordid struggles, and his father's pathetic atmosphere of
sentimental futility. And he bit the pillow, and raved, and cursed.
Why should these snobs despise his father and mother? His own flesh
and blood! Weren't they as good as these pampered beasts!...From
that night on he became a devout follower of Derrick Andrews. In
fact, he soon became an ardent leader of Derrick Andrews. He read
carefully all the standard works on political economy. And then he
began to study blue books and white papers and modern economics.
And he <i>remembered</i> what he had read, facts and figures.</p>

<p>And on Thursday nights at the Socialist Club, no one was more
ardent than he, or eager to get on to their feet, and tear any
opposition to pieces.</p>

<p>And during his last term he startled the Cambridge Union by
several closely reasoned speeches, based on unarguable mathematics,
and several of the elders said: "Who is this young man? He appears
dangerous."</p>

<p>Politics, politics! During that last phase, he could think of
nothing but politics. All his ambitions to secure some lucrative
and paying post went by the board. He was going in for politics. He
would get into Parliament. He would stir the whole country up. He
had found his mission at last. With Derrick he paid a flying visit
to London, attended a sitting of a Trades Union Council, met some
of the leaders, cast an encouraging eye on the Houses of
Parliament, and made endless plans.</p>

<p>When his decision became known at Wolverhampton there was
considerable uneasiness. None of the family quite knew what it
portended.</p>

<p>"There's no money in politics," his mother wrote. "Is that what
all this is to end in, a spouter in Parliament, and on the wrong
side, too? If you must do it, why not keep in with the gentlemen's
party, where there's good money to be had anyway?"</p>

<p>His sisters thought it was thrilling, but rather foolish. His
father said: "Well, well!"</p>

<p>He came down from Cambridge with several degrees, the reputation
of a brilliant mathematician, and no money. He secured a post as
secretary to a Labour organization at three pounds a week, having
waived his very good chances of a lectureship at a Northern
University at six hundred a year. And then his grim political
campaign began. The lamp which had been lighted on that day when
his parents had visited him at Cambridge continued to burn
brightly, although in the pursuit of his new objectives they were
almost forgotten. The work, which came natural to him, thrilled and
inspired him. His enthusiasms, moreover, were always under the
control of his logical mind. He had a natural sense of order and
organization. He foresaw the stupendous difficulties of his party.
In the same way that at school he had found himself surrounded by
stupid boys, so here did he find himself surrounded by unbalanced
men. They appeared to him to be for the most part either sincere
and unbalanced, or clever, cynical and disgruntled.</p>

<p>How are we to get unity? was his constant wonder. The leaders
soon spotted in him a desirable recruit. There were not many of his
kind. He had that unusual combination of brains, passion, and
balance, so valuable, so rare in the party. He spoke on public
platforms, gave lectures, and wrote articles on economic subjects
for advanced weeklies. He was recognized as a distinct asset. His
personality, moreover, was beginning to develop. Without being
exactly good-looking, there was something compelling and attractive
about him, now that he had evaded the tremors of adolescence. On a
platform he was entirely without self-consciousness. In private he
could be sympathetic and urbane.</p>

<p>In two years' time he had become a valuable unit in the party.
His income had increased, but even then was less than four hundred
a year. Unless through graft there are no big prizes for the
political rank and file. But he was happy in the ends he served. He
was elected a member of "The Ptolemy," a most exclusive club for
shining lights in the Liberal and Labour world. And there he would
meet not only the virile spirits of the day, but men whose names
were a byword of the immediately preceding generation. And it was
there he met old John Wiggan. Wiggan was very old, as "old as God,"
someone described him. He had been a member of the House in the
days of Parnell, Disraeli, and Gladstone. He had been to prison,
had suffered, and struggled, been ostracized, mobbed, and derided.
He was a kind of living myth. He spent most of his time in "The
Ptolemy," hunched up in a corner by the fireplace. He seldom spoke,
and took no part in argument. Sometimes late at night he would
utter strings of almost inaudible pronouncements, like a voice
coming from the back of a dark temple. At one time he had had a
mild stroke, and his voice remained thick and somewhat
incoherent.</p>

<p>Shedlock liked to sit at the feet of the old man, and await
pellucid moments. There were times when in a phrase he seemed to
condense the varied arguments of a treatise. At other times he
would be foolish and wandering. The younger man nurtured a wild
desire to extract praise or encouragement from the veteran. But
such a thing was difficult and rare. He was not living in the
present. He never read the newspapers, and only followed the trend
of affairs through broad generalizations, studying men and their
characters, and their behaviour. He was like a monitor from the
past, listening at a keyhole. It was at the end of that second year
that Shedlock's sudden and dramatic opportunity occurred. Owing to
the death of a Conservative M.P. there was to be a by-election in
one of the boroughs at Preston. He was invited by the local Labour
organization to contest it. He was twenty-three! His mind
immediately reverted to William Pitt, who had been Prime Minister
at an even earlier age. His senses reeled at this dazzling
opportunity. His vanity had been flattered by his facile successes.
He felt he could do it. And as his determination formed he knew
that his convictions on abstract right and justice were already
slightly coloured by the glamour of personal success. And he did
not care. Had he not worked and earned his opportunity in open
competition? These fools at school, these unbalanced men&mdash;who
had a better right than he?</p>

<p>He went to Preston, armed with the irrefutable evidence of
figures, his retentive memory, the calm logic of his clear brain,
and then a little something more&mdash;the glitter of early
achievement, the growing sense of a platform manner. He went with
confidence and assurance. The campaign lasted five weeks and he
crowned himself with success. There was no Liberal candidate, and a
Conservative majority of over three thousand was converted into a
narrow Labour majority of six hundred and thirty.</p>

<p>He returned to London, flushed and triumphant. For several days
he relaxed. He sat about like a cat licking its wounds after a
battle. He wanted to be flattered and fussed over and handed warm
milk.</p>

<p>And one night he went into "The Ptolemy" very late. The club was
almost deserted. One or two members formally congratulated him, and
then took their departure. He knew that some of them were already
jealous. He felt hungry for praise. In the corner sat old Wiggan,
brooding and alone. He went up to him and said: "Good evening,
sir!"</p>

<p>The old man blinked at him, and nodded, but he said nothing.
After some time Shedlock added:</p>

<p>"I managed to get in at Preston, sir."</p>

<p>Again the old man nodded, and heaved a profound sigh. With
trembling hands he took a sip of what looked like gin and water.
They sat side by side for several minutes without anything being
said. It was Shedlock's turn to sigh. He felt disappointed and
piqued. Why couldn't the old fool speak?</p>

<p>He was about to rise and go when he became aware by certain
movements and shakings that the ancient politician was about to say
something. After a time his voice came like a thin rumble across
the ages:</p>

<p>"You young men&mdash;I've seen so many of you&mdash;you'll never
do it&mdash;you come and go. I've seen you all. You come up to
London&mdash;to the Mother of Parliaments&mdash;Bah!&mdash;full of
enthusiasms, ideals, beliefs&mdash;then do you know what it is
destroys you?"</p>

<p>Shedlock looked puzzled, and the old man regarded him absently.
Like a confidence, he whispered:</p>

<p>"It's the Glow-worm!"</p>

<p>"The Glow-worm?"</p>

<p>"I call it the Glow-worm because its appeal is more potent at
night. It works mostly by night. You may call it what you
like&mdash;social life perhaps. You of all people will never stand
up against it. I see what you are like&mdash;full of enthusiasm and
ideals, eh?&mdash;a short time passes&mdash;they get you
always&mdash;you are listening for the frou-frou of a woman's
frock. You are flattered and made much of&mdash;you find yourself
in gilded salons, midst modulated lights, where women move
softly&mdash;and where there is something, a kind of refinement, a
tradition, you had never dreamt of. And they <i>have</i> something
on their side, you know&mdash;it takes centuries&mdash;"</p>

<p>He waved his arm vaguely, and took another sip at the drink.</p>

<p>"The Glow-worm!&mdash;'Oh, Mr. Graeme, you're so clever and
original! So interesting!'&mdash;Women! all men want to please
women&mdash;they hate being boors&mdash;you find yourself in
competition for favours and encouragement&mdash;you desire to be
thought civilized&mdash;they hold these conventions, these leagues,
which you would expect to be the arena for abstract
argument&mdash;what do they become? Society functions!
<i>You&mdash;do</i> you think you are stronger than the rest? In
time you leave your enthusiasms, your ideals in the
umbrellastand&mdash;you, too, become 'civilized.'</p>

<p>"One talks of principles, but one deals with persons. Why is our
party so divided? The principles are there right enough&mdash;but
all our people are jealous of each other. We have no glow-worm,
nothing to lure the heart of a youth like you. You are a good boy,
but you will fail&mdash;fail like the rest of them&mdash;give me my
hat."</p>

<p>And without turning again in the direction of Shed-lock he went
slowly out. The newly elected M.P. felt bitter and resentful. The
one man whose encouragement he would have welcomed simply treated
him to a farrago of nonsense. The glow-worm! He laughed
sardonically. Rubbish and balderdash! He felt strong purposes
crystallizing within him. He would show the old fool whether he had
strength of character or not.</p>

<p>He avoided "The Ptolemy" after that, and dismissed old Wiggan
from his mind. And that mind had all its work cut out to keep
abreast of the claims upon it. Two days later he took his seat in
the House, to the cheers of his own party.</p>

<p>Issues of great moment were upon the country, and he was working
fourteen hours a day. The demands of the House claimed but a
fraction of his activities. He found himself acting as a kind of
liaison officer between certain rival factions. He had to begin to
feel his way, to study the intricate processes of procedure. His
maiden speech was a cut-and-dried affair, dealing with certain
economic aspects of a Port of London bill. It was well received by
a House which is always quick to detect sincerity. A word of praise
from a member of the Opposition caught him blushing like a
schoolboy. It seemed a curiously generous and sporting
tribute&mdash;something entirely personal.</p>

<p>He forgot it quickly in the rush of work, for there was much to
do. His mother, and father, and Emma came specially to town to hear
him speak. He met them afterwards and they came and had supper at
his rooms in Pimlico. The visit was frankly not a success. He felt
restless and bored and wanted them to go. He realized how he had
advanced, and how they had stopped still. They didn't begin to
understand him. His mother was still only interested in his work as
a job. She wanted to know all about his financial prospects, what
the thing was likely to lead to. Emma wanted to know whom he had
met and whether he knew certain titled members yet. The chit-chat
about all the people and doings in their dreary suburb of
Wolverhampton made him fret and fume.</p>

<p>What interest <i>did</i> they think it could be to him?</p>

<p>He promised to go and see them when the House broke up, and made
the excuse of not seeing them off at the station on the grounds
that he had an appointment with two of his colleagues. That night
the pathetic vision of his father and mother did not disturb his
dreams. He had moved up into a plane beyond them...There followed
then years of genuine toil, of small triumphs, of disillusionment,
bitter disappointments, and a general hardening of the spirit.
About his achievements there was nothing spectacular, but he began
to build a solid and enviable reputation. He was respected on both
sides of the House as a genuine worker, a clear-headed thinker, and
a debater not to be lightly disregarded.</p>

<p>What disconcerted him most profoundly at times was not the
miscarriage of an argument, or even the defeat of a principle which
he regarded as a right principle, but sudden strange undercurrents
where the personal equation came uppermost. It was as though
beneath the comity of mankind there were ever at work strange
forces no one could exactly locate. As though reason had moods,
logic passions, and justice a canker of personal envy. Among his
friends was Julius Padstowe, who edited a Labour weekly called
<i>Unity.</i> He was a sweet, gentle old man, with a grey beard and
large sentimental eyes. His essential kindliness attracted
Shedlock. By the time he came to realize that old Padstowe had more
heart than brains, he became a little involved in what was known at
that time as the Padstowe set, of which his daughter, Julie
Padstowe, was a leading light.</p>

<p>The Padstowes had a largish rambling house in Camberwell. It was
a curious mixture of penury and unnecessary luxury. They had no
servants&mdash;it would have been too undemocratic,
anyway&mdash;the housework and cooking were done by anyone who felt
in the mood. But they had a hard tennis court, and Mr. Padstowe
owned a car&mdash;or did it belong to the <i>Unity</i> newspaper?
It was a large ramshackle old six-seater usually driven by his son
Walter, an aesthetic young man who spike with a drawl, and appeared
to regard everything as frightfully amusing. Shedlock would
sometimes go there on a Sunday night to supper. It was supposed to
be a kind of open house for all their friends. After a tremendous
amount of talk it would be discovered that there was nothing in the
house for supper but two eggs and a small tin of sardines, for a
party of nine or ten. And so amidst great hilarity Walter would get
the ancient car out and go foraging. He would return in half an
hour's time with a cold roast fowl, which he had bought at
somewhere like the Trocadero, a bottle of stuffed olives, a
Camembert cheese, and a bottle of Benedictine. And then from his
pockets he would produce several large boxes of most expensive
Turkish cigarettes. Their flagrant inconsistencies were a constant
wonder to Shedlock. They were indeed extremely kind, and there was
much about them that was lovable. They would wax bitter for half an
hour on end about the chicanery and dishonesty of some minister in
the handling of a bill. A few minutes later Walter would tell with
great glee of some incident in which he had done a railway company
out of sevenpence.</p>

<p>Shedlock would probably have sickened of this atmosphere of
rather flabby sweetness had it not been for Julie. Julie was pretty
and just nineteen, and she regarded all social complexes with naive
optimism. The actions of all men and all women were to her coloured
by the essential purity of her outlook. Even Conservative leaders
and their wives and families were objects of her mothering pity.
She would believe ill of no one. The foolish inconsistencies of her
brother she looked upon as the amiable peccadilloes of a God.</p>

<p>In an active world, in which he was invariably the youngest
unit, Shedlock found it a great relief to come in contact with a
fellow creature&mdash;particularly so attractive a fellow
creature&mdash;younger than himself. She regarded him with
adoration, and in her presence he felt his personality expand and
glow. With her he felt as great as in the presence of Old Wiggan he
felt insignificant.</p>

<p>In a short time he realized that she was the woman he was
destined to marry. With Julie as his wife he saw life in a complete
and comfortable perspective. She was entirely sympathetic, without
being&mdash;as so many of the political women he met
were&mdash;assertive. Her mind, so far untrained, was of the right
quality. In his domestic life she would strike the right note; in
his political life she would follow him like an echo.</p>

<p>It was at about that time that he met Garrison. Garrison was the
most famous person he had ever met, more famous than any member of
Parliament that he was on speaking terms with. He wrote novels,
with colossal circulations, books on biology, sociology, and indeed
all subjects of public interest. He was recognized as one of the
world's great thinkers.</p>

<p>Shedlock was invited for a week-end to Garrison's "White Farm,"
in Sussex, an enormous place, with tennis courts, open-air swimming
baths, and paddocks. It was the openest of open houses Shedlock had
ever visited. Garrison, a middle-aged untidy-looking man, dressed
rather like the manager of a bicycle shop, conducted absurd games
during the day, and sat up half the night writing. He was living
with his second wife and a number of grown-up children, the progeny
of both his first and second wife. There were some twenty-five
people spending the week-end there, and Shedlock found that one
just had to tack on to a general state of mental exuberance. There
were no introductions. If you wanted food you went in search of it.
Garrison's attitude was a dead level of genial chaff. It was not
till he had been there forty-eight hours that Shedlock had any kind
of intimate talk with his host, and then he discovered that the
latter, in a raging, ragging kind of way, knew his soul inside out.
Shedlock felt himself completely tabulated. He was neither great
nor insignificant, but just himself, and what he had done and
thought.</p>

<p>He met other vivacious spirits at Garrison's, an American
professor of physics, an unruly lord, the editor of a monthly, two
other novelists, Bewayne, a Socialist M.P., people whose
professions he did not know, but who talked prodigiously and
well.</p>

<p>He returned to London feeling that in the game of shaping human
destinies, politics did not hold all the cards. It was in every way
an exciting visit, and the impression of it hung about his dreams,
and coloured his waking hours. There was something almost
intoxicating in this virile human fiction. From one of the
party&mdash;the American professor of physics&mdash;he accepted an
invitation to dine. And on that occasion he donned his evening
clothes without his usual misgivings of conscience. The professor,
after all, was a most interesting fellow, as accustomed to wearing
evening dress when he dined as Shedlock was to having a morning
tub. He felt himself pleasantly anticipating meeting the
professor's guests.</p>

<p>From one such house to another he drifted like an enamoured
moth, seeking he knew not what. After a crude day bickering on
committees, struggling to unravel the involved mechanism of the
party machine, there was something singularly attractive about
these well-ordered dinners in chaste rooms, where, amidst a
profusion of flowers and appropriate wines, civilization itself
seemed to sit and speculate idly upon the theory of existence. The
direct appeal olostncrete matters last its grip. It was a pleasant
game played according to rules recognized by every party and
class.</p>

<p>In the spring of the following year three important events
happened to Shedlock in rapid succession. A political upheaval
presaged the early fall cf the Government. The country was patently
dissatisfied and restless. During this upheaval he met Henniken one
evening in one of the lobbies. Henniken was official secretary to
the Labour Party, and a friend of Shedlock's. He was in an excited
state. He seized Shedlock by the buttonhole and said:</p>

<p>"If we get in&mdash;and everything points to it&mdash;the Chief
says he has got an eye on you. How does the Home Office strike
you?"</p>

<p>That was the first important thing, and in the ecstasy of it he
committed himself to the second important thing&mdash;he became
officially engaged to Julie Padstowe. The third important thing
followed hard upon it. At a dinner party at Garrison's town house
in Sloane Square he met Mrs. Groal-Chamberlin. She was a widow in
the late thirties, and her husband had been a famous Conservative
Foreign Minister for fifteen years. But there is no gainsaying that
if she had never met and married Groal-Chamberlin, Mrs.
Groal-Chamberlin would still have been a famous, not to say
notorious, woman. She had that curious personal magnetism that
caused her to be always the centre of attraction in any society.
She had an unanalyzable face. It was by no means pretty, but what
there was pretty about it was emphasized by her magnetic eyes and
her magnetic voice. She was reported to have had innumerable love
affairs, but always with famous people. Her name and photograph
were always in the papers. She was witty, cultured and courageous.
About everything about her, her clothes, her hair, the delicate
perfume that emanated from her body, civilization seemed to have
prepared and lavished something special and unique. When Shedlock
was introduced to her, she flashed at him:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Graeme, I've wanted for so long to meet you!"</p>

<p>Now to an impartial referee, sitting up aloft, that must have
seemed, for a start, rather like hitting below the belt. There was
Shedlock just emerged from the dim obscurity of a Wolverhampton
suburb, just getting his feet, just groping for the first&mdash;or
perhaps the second&mdash;rung of the ladder...</p>

<p>A Chinese drawing-room, old lacquer, cunningly shaded lights
flicking into prominence the flash of jewels, clusters of
rose-coloured azaleas in gilt baskets, strange and unfamiliar
perfumes, the jowls of men famous in many continents. Amidst it all
the boy from Wolverhampton perforated through and through by Mrs.
Growl-Chamberlin's magnetic eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Groal-Chamberlin! anxious to meet <i>him!</i>...</p>

<p>He swayed a little and managed to gasp:</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe it, madam."</p>

<p>"But indeed I do."</p>

<p>She turned to Garrison and said:</p>

<p>"Henry, whom am I sitting next to? Do let me sit next to this
nice man here?"</p>

<p>Garrison, with his ineradicable grin:</p>

<p>"Confound you, Agnes, you always upset my parties."</p>

<p>But he found himself leading her into dinner. The dinner was
like a dream. He had no idea that women of this kind knew so much,
could talk so profoundly, and listen so sympathetically. She seemed
to know the world from China to Vienna. She had mixed in foreign
courts, and could apparently speak innumerable languages. Little
flicks of food fluttered across his plate and vanished. He sipped
from a glass that never seemed to empty. At one perverse moment he
suddenly thought of supper at home in his mother's house&mdash;the
cold joint, a salad of the vegetables left from midday dinner,
cheese, bread, his father drinking stout, his mother complaining
about Lily reading a novel at meal times...</p>

<p>"I think I've read nearly all your speeches," Mrs.
Groal-Chamberlin was saying. "You have a rich and fertile mind, Mr.
Graeme. Everyone admires your constructive sense. It's so rare.
Listen, do come and call on me. I would so love to discuss all
these things with you."</p>

<p>She looked at him coyly and added: "You think all our people are
very&mdash;very reactionary, don't you now? I would so like to
persuade you they are not."</p>

<p>Of course he went to call on her, not once or twice, but many
times. He wasted hours when he should have been at work, dancing
attendance upon her. She argued with him gently and provocatively.
And the power of her arguments lay less in their logic than in the
precision of her personal discernments. Her personality overrode
the mere claims of avowed economics. She seemed to stand for
something almost indestructible.</p>

<p>To everyone's surprise the Government weathered the storm the
whole of that summer, but the end could not be far off.</p>

<p>Shedlock felt like a ship in some great harbour waiting for the
tide. Or rather he felt like the captain of that ship, all agog to
put to sea. He was fussing about to see that the bunkers were
filled with coal, the stores complete, the engines in perfect
working order. Sometimes he would pull himself together, and say to
himself firmly: "I am not in love with Mrs. Groal-Chamberlin."</p>

<p>He persuaded himself that this was a true statement of fact. He
was not in love with her. But there was something almost more
upsetting than being in love. On the other hand, was he in love
with Julie Padstowe? The more he associated with Mrs.
Groal-Chamberlin and her friends the more futile and unattractive
did the society of the Padstowes appear. In spite of their
inequalities they were thoroughly nice kind people, much nicer,
much more moral than Mrs. Groal-Chamberlin's friends. And
yet&mdash;he found himself neglecting the Padstowes, neglecting his
fiancée more and more. He felt himself swimming round in an eddy,
like a fly in a wash-basin when the plug has been pulled out.</p>

<p>During July and August he spent long week-ends at Mrs.
Groal-Chamberlin's delightful house in Hertfordshire. He was
flattered and made much of. He was made aware of degrees of
refinement which he found irresistibly soothing. Politics seemed
but a sordid game in the more consuming pastimes of art and
philosophy. It seemed of less significance what he thought of them
than of what they thought of him. The men there were mostly
political opponents, and he could not but be impressed by their
genuine English courtesy, breadth, and tolerance. He was never made
to feel an outsider. Whatever views a man might have it was of no
consequence provided he was a sportsman and behaved like a
gentleman. And the desire to make good his claim in this respect
usurped every other call.</p>

<p>With what he flattered himself was superhuman restraint he
refused her invitation to Scotland in September. It behoved him to
put his house in order. In October or November the tide was
destined to turn.</p>

<p>But during the weeks she was away he fretted and fumed. The
Pawstowes' house at Clerkenwell got on his nerves. Julie got on his
nerves. In a consciously dramatic moment he broke off his
engagement. There was a great emotional upheaval, tears...In
despair he rushed up to see his family at Wolverhampton. He stayed
a week, a dreadful week. He felt in a way he was taking leave of
them. His feelings were torn between that deep ineradicable
affection for one's kind and utter stupefaction at their mode of
life. If it were difficult for him to explain anything about
himself when he was starting on his political career, how much more
difficult now! And could he explain&mdash;or even
say&mdash;anything about Mrs. Groal-Chamberlin? If Lily and Emma
had merely known that he knew her, they would have made such a
ridiculous fuss, and uttered such banal and hopeless remarks it
would have made him almost ill.</p>

<p>At the beginning of October a letter came for him from her. She
was on her way to her villa at Rapallo. She urged him to come and
stay with her, and gave a list of a few select guests she was
expecting (a Cabinet Minister among them).</p>

<p>He could not bring himself to say yes or no. He wrote and
thanked her, and explained that it would all depend on the
political situation.</p>

<p>More committee meetings, more talk, more undercurrents, a strike
pending, a conspiracy against the party leaders. If his chief
didn't come into power, what would happen to Shedlock? would he,
too, be shelved? There were many jealous rivals anxious for his
destruction. Ideas were side-tracked right and left in the clamour
for personal advancement. He felt despondent and desperate.</p>

<p>In the third week of October he set out for Rapallo. What his
idea was he could not formulate, some vague impulse to escape from
he knew not what. He had not let her know he was coming, and when
he arrived at the little town scattered around the oval bay, his
heart failed him. He drove to a small hotel on the front and stayed
the night. His nerves were all on edge, and he kept lecturing
himself, and calling himself a fool. What was he doing here?
To-morrow he would go back to London and never tell her he had
been.</p>

<p>In the morning the sun was streaming through the green shutters.
He went out on to the balcony. The bay looked like an opal set in a
frame of olive-grey and grey. A hibiscus tree was in full bloom
beneath his window. He breakfasted and sat in the sun, and his
nerves were steadied by the calm serenity of his environment. He
spent the morning walking and dreaming. He learnt that there was a
train to Genoa at five o'clock. He would catch it. Of course he
would catch it.</p>

<p>Just before four o'clock he was returning to the hotel along the
coast road when a car that was passing him stopped, and a voice
said:</p>

<p>"Well, now, what do you mean by this?"</p>

<p>How could he explain himself? Why should he be in Rapallo at all
if it were not to come and visit her? He spluttered and
prevaricated.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, smiling, "I shall expect you up to dinner.
I will send for your things. Geoffrey Arne is with me, and Lady
Fordyke, and several people you know. I insist on you coming. Look!
that is my little villa up there among the tamarisks."</p>

<p>He bowed and left her, and somehow he felt old and defeated. He
sat on the shore and badgered his brains to think of a reasonable
excuse for going back and leaving her in this absurd and
unexplained manner. One voice within him said:</p>

<p>"Don't go to her, don't go! you'll lose everything if you go.
Better to burn your boats and not go." Another voice said:</p>

<p>"You have already burnt your boats. What does it matter? A few
days and nights ..."</p>

<p>When he returned to the hotel he went up to his room to wash. To
his surprise he found all his things had disappeared! He went down
to the hall porter to enquire. The latter looked surprised.</p>

<p>"But a lady called, sir, in a car. I understood it was arranged.
She has taken your trunks up to the Villa Igeia. She said you were
going there to dine, to stay, sir."</p>

<p>He felt angry. He had promised nothing. This was very like the
high-handed way these people went on, and yet...He turned away,
anxious to show no feeling. He picked up an Italian paper that had
just been delivered. He glanced at the headlines. During his
journey out he had studied an Italian phrase-book and grammar. He
had picked up enough to ask his way about and understand simple
phrases. And the phrase he read in that headline was simple enough.
It announced: "Resignation of the British Government."</p>

<p>He cursed Mrs. Groal-Chamberlin! He must go immediately. Every
hour now was valuable. Idiot that he was to have come out here! He
might have known it would happen like that! He looked at his watch
and swore out loud. Fetching away his bag like that made it just
impossible for him to catch the train. It meant waiting another
twelve hours. It meant...the night at Rapallo inevitably. It meant,
above all, seeing her again, being in her insidious atmosphere.</p>

<p>He went up to his room and lay on the bed, and thought. He
decided that although he had to stay the night he would not go and
stay with Mrs. Groal-Chamberlin. He would go back to-morrow without
his bag and without seeing her. He could buy a few necessities in
the town. It would be the only way. He lay there until it was dark.
Then he went downstairs and had a quiet dinner alone. Afterwards he
paced along the front, deep in thought. It must have been about
nine o'clock when, walking back in the direction of the hotel, his
eye became aware of an isolated villa, nestling among tamarisks,
near the top of a short steep hill. It was lighted up, not
garishly, but just gently aglow. It looked like a glow-worm against
the deep violet of the Mediterranean night.</p>

<p>A glow-worm! At that instant he gave a kind of inward groan. He
saw his whole life from the beginning. His zeal, enthusiasms,
dreams, ambitions, rushing in one direction. He saw his mother, her
cloth cap all awry, sweating at the kitchen boiler. He saw old
Wiggan huddling in the corner of the "Ptolemy Club."</p>

<p>"You can call it what you like. I call it the glowworm."</p>

<p>He clutched at his throat and muttered:</p>

<p>"I must get out of this."</p>

<p>He walked hither and thither, like a man distracted. But ten
minutes later he was pushing his way rapidly between the tamarisks,
towards that light at the top of the hill.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>25. The Deserter</h2>

<p>He was conscious that some of the men in cloth caps were
sniggering at him. They sat there in rows in the bare room,
swinging their legs, smoking cigarettes, laughing, muttering coarse
jests. They had all been thrown together that morning for the first
time, but they appeared drawn to each other by some instinctive
comradeship. Wainwright alone felt himself shut out, a being apart.
He had already spent three hours with them awaiting his turn to go
before the Medical Board, but his tentative approaches towards
companionship had been still-born. He was acutely self-conscious,
and his furtive offers of cigarettes to the men next to him were
received with chilling unresponsiveness. If he addressed one, the
answer would be:</p>

<p>"Eh?" or "What d' yer sye?"</p>

<p>They did not seem to be able to understand what he said, any
more than he could understand what they said. He made a bold
attempt on two occasions to be friendly, to make some laughing
comment, and the failure froze him. More and more he felt himself
thrust apart, until he was aware of small groups whispering
together and laughing at him. Doubtless his olive skin with the mop
of dark hair, and the patent fact that he was better dressed,
better educated, might act as a barrier, but the knowledge
distressed him. He did not feel himself superior to his fellow men,
whatever his character or position, but how to cross this terrible
mental chasm?</p>

<p>A sergeant and two privates were walking in and out of the room,
with lists of names and innumerable army forms. The men, in
driblets of dozens, passed through to another room, stripped and
went before the Board. When Wainwright's turn came he felt a
curious choking feeling, as though he could not get his breath. He
felt a desire to make a sudden dash from the building, and then
there dawned upon him for the first time the realization of a
sudden and terrible experience. He had lost his liberty. He was
twenty-four, and all his life to that minute he had been an
absolutely free man. He had occasionally been checked by small
fetters, but none which could not be instantly broken if he desired
it very much. He had been to school, and after school he had been
articled to an architect in London, an old friend of his father.
The indenture implied certain mutual obligations, but it was one
that could have been terminated at any time. There was no hint of
bondage. All his life he had been generously treated, perhaps
spoilt.</p>

<p>His father, who was a vicar in the East Riding of Yorkshire, had
died when he was at school. His mother had worshipped him, and she
had died only three years before. His only living relative was his
sister, who was married to a wealthy flax-merchant at Huddersfield.
In London he had few friends, but he was comfortable and happy in
his quiet introspective way. His parents had left him a small
private income, and he was absorbed in his work.</p>

<p>He occupied a commodious suite of rooms on Adelphi Terrace,
well-stocked with old furniture and books. He had never been
interested in politics and had not given the subject of war half an
hour's consideration in his life. Nevertheless he was not entirely
a book-worm. At school he had been keen on cricket and hockey, and
the latter game he still kept up and he played tennis in the
summer. He was perhaps highly-strung, but apart from that he was
not aware of any physical disability. When the war had come it had
seemed so preposterous he tried to thrust it aside as much as
possible. He wildly hoped that it would suddenly end in the same
cyclonic way it had begun. He would not argue about it. He
dismissed it again and again with the simple expression
"Ridiculous!" He could not feel a thing that was so much outside
himself, and he harboured the eternal suspicion which the artist
always had for the politician.</p>

<p>And then suddenly had come that little buff slip of paper
<i>ordering</i> him to appear before a certain Medical Board on a
certain day at a certain time. Even then he had not grasped the
full significance of this onslaught on his liberty. He still
thought it was "ridiculous." Something would happen. He would get
out of it. It was not till that moment when he stood naked among a
crowd of naked men that he realized that his liberty was really at
stake; that the war was something which tremendously concerned
himself.</p>

<p>He followed them into another room, where an old man was sitting
at a desk talking to a lieutenant, and a plump doctor in civilian
clothes appeared to be chasing naked men about the room and calling
out remarks in a mechanical voice to a clerk. They were weighed,
measured, examined in every detail, made to hop, skip, jump and
bend. Nothing seemed to be overlooked. Man was reduced to a
physical automaton, and nothing else appeared of the slightest
consequence.</p>

<p>Wainwright hopped, skipped and jumped with the rest. The doctor
asked one or two questions, and he found himself replying huskily:
"Yes, sir," or "No, sir," as the case might be. Eventually he found
himself standing before the old major and the doctor, feeling more
naked than ever, and the major was saying:</p>

<p>"You've never suffered from any organic disease then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>They drew apart and talked, and he suddenly felt a desire to go
up and say:</p>

<p>"I say, you know, I shan't be any good at this sort of
thing."</p>

<p>But that choking sense prevented him from doing this, and also
the realization that from their point of view this would also be
"ridiculous."</p>

<p>In a few moments the doctor turned round and said:</p>

<p>"All right. Dress up."</p>

<p>He dressed and waited interminably in another room, among his
friends in the cloth caps. At length they were despatched to a
corridor, where they waited for their names to be called out. He
received another buff slip of paper. He had been passed A1. He was
liable to be called in fourteen days' time as a first-class
fighting man in the Great War!</p>

<p>He walked out of the building, greedy for his momentary liberty,
but dazed by the astounding position he faced. He walked all the
way to Adelphi Terrace and let himself in. The quiet dignity and
beauty of his sitting-room calmed him. The soothing proportions of
his William and Mary walnut furniture, the Adams' bay-window
overlooking the river, on the table an open book on <i>Old English
Mansions</i>, and a pile of <i>Architectural Reviews</i> and
<i>Builders</i>.</p>

<p>A fire glowed in the grate and invited him to warm his toes as
he reclined on the tall easy-chair, by the side of which was a
book-rest and his favourite pipe. This was reality, and the
menacing disturbance outside was a dream. In any case here he was
himself, and here he could think this thing out to its bitter
conclusion.</p>

<p>And so from that time Wainwright began to try and think
earnestly and intensely about the war and his own position. And if
the conclusions he came to were not ours, we must in any case give
him the credit for having tried very hard to get his thoughts into
a true focus, and we must allow considerably for his upbringing and
environment. For the mind of Wainwright was a very complex affair,
and the effect of the war was like that of a bear disturbing a
beehive.</p>

<p>If you conceive a swarm of bees intent on the delicate
construction of a hive, and suddenly having their well-laid plans
obliterated by the nozzle of the fierce monster, you may imagine
how for some time his thoughts buzzed round in a complete state of
panic. There was no cohesion, no unity, no concentration. He felt
personally outraged. He had no feeling of animosity to any living
thing. He had read very little history and no political economy. He
abhorred politics, and lived for beauty. He had been brought up to
see the good in everything, to believe the best in every one, and
in the unswerving faith that war was a thing of pre-civilized ages.
Incidentally he distrusted newspapers and was always inclined to
see the other fellow's point of view more insistently than his own.
He became convinced that the war was a politico-economic affair
waged by two groups of uninspired and quite uninteresting
people.</p>

<p>The outcome of Wainwright's reflections was a determination to
become a deserter. Now Wainwright was a Yorkshireman, that is to
say, he had the power of combining his idealism with its full quota
of hard-headed sense. When he had once made up his mind to desert,
he decided to do the thing thoroughly and with the greatest degree
of circumspection. He spent a week thinking it all out in detail,
and then acted deliberately. He was in a peculiarly good position
to desert, for he had money and very few friends. There were barely
half a dozen people who would be likely to cause trouble.</p>

<p>His employer, Mr. Haynes, who was getting on in years and spent
his whole life at the office, except to go backwards and forwards
to his house at Northwood, two assistants who led a very similar
life, the woman who came to work for him, his landlord, his lawyer
and two or three others whose habitation and movements were
familiar to him. The whole scheme was daringly simple. He did not
go away and hide in a cave in the Welsh hills, or disguise himself
as a blind pedlar, but he simply moved from Adelphi Terrace to
South Kensington on the very day that the calling-up notice was
served upon him.</p>

<p>Now for any one who wishes to desert or to escape from the eyes
of the world we cannot imagine a safer or more appropriate retreat
than South Kensington. Nobody in South Kensington takes the
slightest notice of anybody else. The tall supercilious houses look
right over your head. The broad streets and pavements hold your
neighbours at a distance. Provided you are decently dressed, no one
takes any interest in you at all. A respectable person might wander
there unobserved for ever, like a conventional ghost in a city of
make-believe. Inquisitiveness soon exhausts itself in the
atmosphere of the Cromwell Road. The vast museum and institutions
have the faculty of making the individual appear trivial and
inconsequential.</p>

<p>This is of course all assuming&mdash;as we have said&mdash;that
the individual is <i>respectable</i>. If a gentleman in a cloth cap
and a scarf instead of a tie&mdash;such as Wainwright encountered
when he went before his Medical Board&mdash;were to make it a
practice to lounge about the Exhibition Road, we do not presume to
know what secret machinery might be set in motion to make enquiries
as to his <i>raison d'être</i>, but a clean collar and a well-cut
suit will always act as a soporific in this select neighbourhood.
Moreover, there are innumerable buildings which were at that time
occupied by gentlemen, dressed very like Wainwright, who were
employed in multifarious and mysterious ways in "getting on with
the war." All of this is nobody else's business. Certainly not
yours or mine. There is not the slightest doubt but that Wainwright
might have been wandering about there comfortably to this day, had
it not been for certain circumstances which we shall disclose
presently.</p>

<p>He took a suite of furnished rooms in a quiet square at the back
of South Kensington Station, in the name of George Plinth. He liked
the name of George Plinth. He took a long time inventing it. It
gave a pleasant suggestion of his profession, and seemed peculiarly
appropriate to the neighbourhood. He estimated that the
"ridiculous" war would be over within six months or in any case a
year, and then he would be able to return and everything would go
on as usual. He took two hundred pounds out of the bank and told
his lawyer he was going up to Yorkshire on business and would send
his address later. He told Mr. Haynes he regretted to leave his
employ, but he had been called up to do war work and he hoped to
come back to him after. He gave the woman who worked for him a
handsome tip and told her he was going to France.</p>

<p>When she had gone he took three taxi-loads of books, drawing
materials and household goods to his new address. He wrote to the
landlord and sent a year's rent and told him he was going to
Scotland. He wrote to two other people and told one he was going to
Bristol and the other that he was leaving to take up Red Cross work
in Serbia. Having completed this campaign of mellow mendacity, he
locked up the flat on Adelphi Terrace and left no address.</p>

<p>"They can take their choice," he said to himself that night in
his new rooms as he lighted his pipe after supper. Satisfied that
his plans had been executed with complete skill and foresight, he
sedulously dismissed the Army authorities from his mind and buried
himself in the study of architecture. His landlady was a
lantern-jawed, forlorn-looking widow with three young children. She
kept the place adequately clean, cooked well, and took no further
interest in him beyond that of securing her rent in advance and
stealing some of his butter and sugar, altogether an ideal landlady
for his purpose.</p>

<p>He spent his days studying, partly in his rooms and partly in
the Victoria and Albert Museum. It was for the time very
satisfactory. When the whole of Europe was in a death-grip, he
commenced to compile a book on <i>Doorways in the Reign of Charles
II.</i></p>

<p>Occasionally he went for strolls in Kensington Gardens, and he
did not hesitate to venture further afield if he felt in the mood,
though he timed his visits to the West End when he would not be
likely to meet Mr. Haynes or any other people who knew him. As time
went on he became bolder in these enterprises. He went to Hampstead
and occasionally into the country for a day. The summer exhausted
itself and still the "ridiculous" war went on. He settled down to
"stick it" through the winter. His work absorbed him, but he began
to experience transient moods of unrest. When he withdrew from his
books or his drawing-board, he was acutely conscious of an alien
world in the making. Everything socially appeared to be changing
kaleidoscopically.</p>

<p>New uniforms both for men and women appeared upon the streets
every day. Every one seemed intent and occupied, women especially.
He would notice them hurrying along the streets with their little
despatch cases, and a new light of independence and enthusiasm in
their eyes. And he felt shut out from all this. He would
occasionally talk to people, but he avoided controversy. He made no
friends and encountered no enemies. He passed thousands of
officers, and groups of military police, but no one took any notice
of him. He refused to take any interest in the war except to glance
at the papers to see if there were any probability of it coming to
an end.</p>

<p>One night he was awakened by the sound of guns. He jumped up and
went to the window. Flashlights were whipping the sky with jerky
movements. He could hear the drone of engines, and below in the
street he heard a woman scream. He dressed quickly and went out.
The streets were deserted. The night was very dark, and the guns
were booming thunderously. He could not see the Zeppelin, but he
walked quickly on. Occasionally some one would rush past him, or a
motor car dash drunkenly into the darkness. He felt an odd sense of
exhilaration in this experience. He thought to himself:</p>

<p>"Up there somewhere are ten or fifteen men&mdash;men of flesh
and blood like myself&mdash;seated in a cage, and their idea is to
kill me or anyone else they can."</p>

<p>The thing seemed to present itself at an unusual angle. It
appeared very real, but if anything more ridiculous than ever. Why
on earth should ten or fifteen good gentlemen whom he had never met
want to kill him or any one else? He had never felt any desire to
kill any one, not even in a passion. At the corner of a square he
ran into an oldish man with a grey beard gazing upwards. He looked
eccentric. Perhaps he too shared Wainwright's views. Wainwright
spoke to him. He spoke impulsively with that freedom common to men
who share a danger. The old man mumbled his replies. Wainwright
brought his harangue to the point of the "ridiculousness" of the
war. Suddenly the old man turned on him and said:</p>

<p>"Boy, anything that's worth having is worth fighting for. I've
got three lads out there. Why aren't you?"</p>

<p>Wainwright stole furtively away into the night, tingling with a
dull sense of disappointment. He hardly knew how he got through the
winter. Periods of depression became more and more acute, and more
and more frequent. The book on <i>Charles II Doorways</i> was
half-finished and then discarded. He lost interest in it. He took
up the study of Gothic tracery, but he found his mind wandering.
There dawned upon him at times the realization that he hadn't
perhaps faced the thing quite squarely, but that it was now too
late. You cannot destroy a thing by calling it ridiculous. Perhaps
it would have been better to become a conscientious objector and to
have gone to prison. It would certainly have been more courageous,
only...he knew he was not a conscientious objector. He would
assuredly fight for anything he believed in. It was only that he
objected to be made to fight for some affair he knew nothing about,
somebody else's affairs. But it must soon be over now.</p>

<p>The winter passed, but not the war. It appeared indeed to be
extending, to be developing, to have "only just begun," some people
said. He saw the snowdrops and the violets come and go in
Kensington Gardens, and then the daffodils raise their heads and
nod at him indifferently. And then one day he met Emma.</p>

<p>It was a warm day at the end of April. It was essentially a day
when the heart should be singing, but Wainwright was disconsolate.
The sunlight seemed to mock him. He sat on a bench gazing idly at
the flowers and listening to the drone of the traffic. Nursemaids
passed pushing go-carts and perambulators, children laughed, and
their high-spirited voices epitomized the gaiety of the day. He
became aware that one perambulator had passed him twice and was
returning. He looked up and into the eyes of&mdash;Emma.</p>

<p>She was a little thing, round and soft like a bird, with grey
mothering eyes ever watchful. She was undeniably pretty, with
pallid cheeks, glowing with a kind of warmth more emotional than
physical. She had a small nose and a full but not too firm mouth,
and a strand of light brown hair waved from under her nurse's cap.
As she passed she did not take her eyes from Wainwright's, but she
went on.</p>

<p>Twenty paces on she turned and looked timidly back. Then she
went on again. Wainwright looked at his hands.</p>

<p>"Somehow, somewhere, somewhere, I have looked into those eyes
before," he thought.</p>

<p>He had been instantly conscious of some sudden vital contact.
Something peculiar had happened. He had been raised in a flash from
the lowest depths of despair to an emotional plane that was in any
case exhilarating. He couldn't understand it and so he looked
helplessly and wonderingly and for no reason at all at his hands.
Then he shifted his legs and looked after her. She was walking
very, very slowly, and there was something peculiarly enticing and
feline about her movements. She saw him watching her. After a time
she turned and came back.</p>

<p>Wainwright felt his heart beating in an unaccountable manner. He
wondered whether he should get up and bolt, but his limbs appeared
atrophied and he sat there still staring at his hands. Very, very
slowly she approached once more, and this time she gave him an
almost imperceptible smile. She spoke to the baby, and her voice
was soft and purry. The baby made a little noise and it became
necessary to rearrange its pillow. After she had done this, still
talking to the baby, and as though not conscious of her own action,
she sat down at the other end of the bench, and Wainwright became
aware of being engulfed in the vortex of a strange and quite
inexpressible emotional experience. She appeared to half glance at
him occasionally, as though expecting him to speak, but he merely
sat there trembling and distracted at his own helplessness.</p>

<p>After a time, the baby not requiring any further attention, she
sat back and looked around her, like a little bird perched on a
bough. Then she took out a note-book and started to feel in her
bag. She was evidently in distress.</p>

<p>Then Wainwright behaved like a man.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he said, "do you happen to want a pencil?"</p>

<p>The grey eyes looked right into his, and the lips parted in a
slow smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you. Could you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Wainwright snatched the pencil out of his pocket and handed it
to her. She thanked him, and made some scribbling entry in the book
and returned it.</p>

<p>"It's a nice day," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;ripping," replied the young man.</p>

<p>"The daffodils are pretty," she remarked after a pause.</p>

<p>"Yes, aren't they fine!" he replied eagerly.</p>

<p>There was a most disconcerting pause, and then Wainwright in
desperation stood up and peered into the perambulator. He could
just see the tip of a pink nose. He said:</p>

<p>"I say, what a jolly baby!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is pretty, isn't it?" she replied.</p>

<p>"Is it yours?"</p>

<p>She laughed a low gurgly laugh.</p>

<p>"Not much. What do <i>you</i> think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know," exclaimed Wainwright, who felt
he'd made a very tactless remark.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind? I wish it was."</p>

<p>"Do you like babies?"</p>

<p>"Rather. I wish I had one of my own."</p>

<p>This seemed a desperate plunge into the most sacred intimacies
and in order to gain time to focus this tremendous confession,
Wainwright remarked:</p>

<p>"You're not married then?"</p>

<p>To his surprise she appeared suddenly very solemn.</p>

<p>She nodded and said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm married."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>There was another uncomfortable pause, and then she became
jerkily confidential.</p>

<p>"I only do this of a morning&mdash;to oblige Mrs. Merryfeather
of Knightsbridge. I'm married myself. We live at Hammersmith. I
used to do type-writing at one time."</p>

<p>It seemed difficult to reply to these disconnected comments, but
Wainwright felt that their acquaintanceship was sufficiently
developed to venture:</p>

<p>"Have you been married long?"</p>

<p>"Three years."</p>

<p>"Is your husband&mdash;in business?"</p>

<p>"He's foreman in a stonemason's yard. He's a very strong
man."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>The principal thing that Wainwright could see was that it was
extremely regrettable that so lovable and attractive a little
person should not have babies if she desired them. But he felt that
he had pursued the matter as far as it was decently appropriate,
and he added quickly:</p>

<p>"Do you come here often?"</p>

<p>"Every morning now. I only started last week."</p>

<p>"I seem to know you or to have met you before."</p>

<p>For reply she looked out at him from under her lowered lids and
smiled. He added:</p>

<p>"I must be going. Perhaps I'll see you again, then."</p>

<p>She leant forward as though making a mysterious and solemn
acquiescence and rose from the bench. Their ways parted and she did
not look back.</p>

<p>It may be difficult to gather what gleams of spiritual comfort
Wainwright managed to deduce from the foregoing banal conversation,
but it is an undoubted fact that it raised him to an unexpected
pinnacle of bliss. Possibly it was the things not said rather than
the things said, or it may have been the sudden contact with an all
too-human creature after a long period of emotional starvation. In
any case it is certain that the experience turned his head. For the
rest of the day he walked on air. Those grey eyes were between him
and his drawing-board. He could not work and he could not think.
Through the dull mists of his austere life, and the desperate
negation of these latter days, there suddenly fluttered the pennant
of a cavalier, a reckless dare-devil fellow, with boots and spurs,
and a quick desire for action.</p>

<p>He flung his books aside and went for a long walk. In the
evening he swaggered unblushingly into a music-hall. It is quite on
the cards that if he had met his former colleagues at Mr. Haynes'
or any others likely to be informers, he would not have hesitated
to speak to them. Fortunately for him no such contretemps
materialized. But the music only maddened him the more, and he
returned to his roams late at night to dream of grey eyes and the
morrow.</p>

<p>Wainwright was young, somewhat impulsive, and generally
illogical, but he was not a fool. Even in those first days when the
full glamour of that experience was on him, he entertained no
illusions on the score of Emma. He believed himself to be
desperately in love with her, but he knew that it was a love
without the hope of fruition. Apart from the fact of her being a
married woman he realized that she was a being quite apart from
himself. She was primitive, uneducated, amazingly ignorant, but the
very thought of her stimulated him, and her presence intoxicated
him. He had been brought up on strictly puritanical lines, and a
reverence for woman was ingrained in his nature. He had never been
in love before and literature which reflected variations of the
erotic passion did not interest him greatly. But this to him was
something altogether unique. No human being had ever been brought
face to face with so engaging an experience.</p>

<p>Every morning he went to meet her in the gardens, and sometimes
in the afternoon, when she was free of the baby, they would meet
again by appointment. They went to Richmond, and Kew, and Hampton
Court; but she always insisted on being back at her home at
Hammersmith at seven o'clock, because "he" came home at half-past,
and she had to prepare "his" supper.</p>

<p>Once Wainwright took her up into Richmond Park. They sat on a
low bench among the young ferns, far from the gaze of all living
things. She was in one of her unbreakable silent moods, leaning
forward on her knees and occasionally glancing at him furtively
with her cat-like eyes.</p>

<p>"What are your thoughts, little witch?" he said.</p>

<p>She smiled vaguely and shook her head. Wainwright took her hand
in his and kissed it.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about everything," he said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'everything'?" she answered faintly.</p>

<p>"You, your life, your home. Are you happy?"</p>

<p>She seemed to catch her breath. Then she nodded and replied
unconvincingly,</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He put his arm round her waist and pulled her to him.</p>

<p>"Let me help you. Let me make you happy, Emma."</p>

<p>She half-closed her eyes as though she were slipping away from
him. He kissed her on the cheek, and she neither responded nor
checked him. She sat there brooding and answering. Wainwright was
tortured by the unbridgeable chasm that always seemed to lie
between them. She appeared to be drawn to him, to like him and want
him, but then there came a point beyond which everything seemed
empty and unresponsive. And he was choking for want of sympathy and
understanding.</p>

<p>A lark swung upwards and started its song above the chestnut
trees. The river away beneath them trembled in a warm mist.
Suddenly Wainwright slipped on to his knees, and buried his head in
her lap. And then he held her hands over his eyes and he told her
everything. He told her about his parents and his upbringing, and
his work, and his experience at the Medical Board. He told her he
was a deserter, and he explained his views and reasons. He held his
cheek against hers, and whispered hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Do you blame me?"</p>

<p>He felt her bosom heaving as she replied simply:</p>

<p>"No. Everybody for himself, I say."</p>

<p>She would not kiss him, but she stroked his hair and after a
time she said:</p>

<p>"We must be going back, I think."</p>

<p>He lifted her up, and for a moment she clung limply to him. Then
they sauntered across the grass back to the station.</p>

<p>After that they seemed more to each other. Although Emma would
not speak to him of her home life, he found her more companionable.
He chatted to her indiscriminately about anything that came into
his head. Sometimes he made her laugh. He was happier, even when he
was not with her. He launched into his work once more. He took a
fresh interest in the <i>Charles II Doorways</i>. The war became
more and more a matter of minor importance. He found in Emma the
thing he had been looking for. She became his mother-confessor. He
idealized her. He basked in the self-martyrdom of believing that he
loved her and of controlling his passion. His attitude towards her
should always be knightly and chivalrous. He gloried in the agony
of wanting to kiss her lips, and then forbearing. He had strange
dreams concerning her, in which he always played the part of Sir
Launcelot.</p>

<p>One morning he noticed that her nurse's cap was pulled down
further across her brow than usual. He would not have commented
upon it only that once as she was stooping over the baby he
observed something else. He said:</p>

<p>"Emma, pull back your cap."</p>

<p>She frowned and shook her head.</p>

<p>"Emma, dear, you've got a bruise on your temple. How did you do
it?"</p>

<p>For a moment she was silent, and then her eyes were filled with
tears.</p>

<p>"I didn't do it."</p>

<p>"Who did it?"</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> did."</p>

<p>Wainwright started.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? He did it?"</p>

<p>She was shaking and she would not answer. He pressed her arm and
whispered:</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>But she only shook herself free and answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right."</p>

<p>From that day Wainwright passed through periods of maddening
disquiet. There dawned upon him the complete solution of her moods
of sullen unresponsiveness, weighed down as she must be by her
secret tragedy. Whenever he hinted that he should come to see her
in her home, she shivered and implored him not to. Neither would he
speak of it unless forced to. For the most part her attitude
remained watchful, supplicating, mildly playful. That she was fond
of him and liked to have him dancing attendance was patent. That he
stirred any deeper chords in her nature remained problematical.</p>

<p>In any case, they still continued meeting nearly every day, and
the fine-drawn skeins of chivalry were tested to their utmost
strength. Sometimes she would come to him playful, gay, almost
yielding. At other times with dark rims and pink lids to her eyes,
distracted and unresponsive. Once she did not appear for nearly a
week, and then no cunning arrangement of hat or coiffure could
conceal the fact that she was barely recovered from the effects of
a black eye.</p>

<p>It was the evidence of this phenomenon which stirred the
cavalier to drastic action. For on that evening he followed her
home to that block of tenements down by the river at Hammersmith,
grandiloquently named "Northallerton Buildings." Stealthily he
tracked her to Number 473B. But he did not on that occasion catch
sight of her husband, Jim Stroud.</p>

<p>He wandered the neighbourhood of wharfs, narrow gullies,
deserted plots of land, meagre dwellings, and vast factories, and a
feeling of despair and pity possessed him. For almost the first
time he felt dragged from the lure of books and precious study by
the call of the grim and terrible social realities. And as the days
and nights went by he found himself more and more frequently,
without any idea of meeting Emma, haunting this unattractive
neighbourhood. It fascinated him. It was nearly three weeks later
that he first beheld Jim Stroud.</p>

<p>He had been wandering down by the river one evening, and turning
the corner of a passage-way he crossed a mean street of
buff-coloured houses when he beheld a man and woman walking thirty
paces ahead. He recognized Emma at once. The man was a big heavy
chunk of humanity, clumsily built. He was slouching along several
yards ahead of the woman, and appeared to be drunk. He was in any
case rolling peculiarly and growling at her. Sometimes he would
lurch sideways and appear to be going to strike her, and she seemed
to shrink back and to be on the alert for some such contingency.
Wainwright increased his pace. As he approached he could hear the
man's remarks and curses, but he continued stumbling forward. In a
few minutes the gaunt frame of Northallerton Buildings loomed
against the sky, and swallowed them up as though fully aware that
its expansive body had been nourished for generations upon a diet
of similar morsels. Wainwright returned home consumed with a
melancholy resolution.</p>

<p>On the morrow he found Emma more morose than usual. She said she
was tired and did not want to go far. They went and sat on a seat
on the Chiswick side of the river. They were both unusually silent.
At length Wainwright said:</p>

<p>"Look here, Emma, this can't go on. I saw you last night with
your husband. He was cursing you. He looked as though he were going
to strike you any minute. Emma, dear, this can't go on. You must
leave him. You can't love him. Listen, you shall leave him and go
where you like. I will look after you. I promise you I'll never do
anything you don't wish me to. I will just be your servant. We will
leave London. Go right into the country&mdash;anywhere you like.
Say you will, Emma."</p>

<p>She was crying. She dabbed her eyes with her handkerchief and
shook all over. He kept trying to soothe her, touching her hands
and muttering, "Emma, dear."</p>

<p>At last she said:</p>

<p>"I lied to you. He is not my husband."</p>

<p>Wainwright started.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He is not my husband. He is my&mdash;man!"</p>

<p>"My God!"</p>

<p>The calm assertion of this amazing news left Wainwright
stupefied. He stared at the girl, at the river and at the sky. Then
gripping her forearm, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Then, by God, that settles it. But why haven't you left him
before?"</p>

<p>"He's my man," she answered simply.</p>

<p>"But, my dear&mdash;" Wainwright stood up. He found himself
groping amidst incomprehensible things. He stretched out his
arms.</p>

<p>"You'll come with me now though, won't you, Emma? You'll put up
with no more of this. Come, we'll start all over again, both of
us."</p>

<p>He pulled her up to him, and she swayed passively. Her bosom was
still heaving, and she could not control her voice to speak all the
way along to the bridge. As they approached the turning that led to
the Buildings, Wainwright lowered his voice.</p>

<p>"Emma," he whispered imploringly, "you will come, won't you? You
will come to me, or if you won't, you'll promise me to leave him? I
will pay for a room for you. You shall go unmolested. You shall be
free. Promise me you'll leave him."</p>

<p>Fora moment she appeared as she had when they first met, a
small, fluffy bird hovering on a branch, liable to dart away in any
direction. He squeezed her hands supplicatingly. Suddenly her eyes
lighted up with an incomprehensible burst of anger. She forced
herself free and cried out:</p>

<p>"He is my man."</p>

<p>And he beheld her small cat-like body gliding away into the
fading light. A little way down the street, she turned and threw
him a kiss, and then ran on. Wainwright began to realize that there
are things which you cannot get to learn in books. And in the days
that followed he felt odd forces working within him. Something was
hardening. Some inner impulse clamouring for concrete expression.
He remembered the old man's saying on the night of the Zeppelin
raid:</p>

<p>"Anything that's worth having is worth fighting for!"</p>

<p>He began to see himself in a different light, to be conscious of
a social entity. There were other people in the world besides
himself, inextricably interdependent. There must be reasons for
everything. And if one asserts oneself, struggles for what one
believes in, there must be inevitably&mdash;conflict.</p>

<p>"He shan't knock her about! He shan't knock her about in any
case," he kept on repeating to himself.</p>

<p>He met her again. She was still incomprehensible, bewildering
and more attractive than ever. She seemed at pains to atone for her
repulsion of his chivalry. She allowed him to see her home, and she
showed him the stone-mason's yard where her man worked. It stood at
the angle of the river and a tiny canal. A narrow passage with a
low stone wall connected it with the Causeway and a little
frequented road. On the left one passed a deserted wharf.</p>

<p>It is necessary to briefly describe this wharf, because it was
in this that the affairs of Wainwright reached a crisis on a
certain Monday evening in June. A black door always ajar in the
midst of a long stretch of black hoarding led into an L-shaped
piece of ground partly mud and weeds, but flanked on one side by a
strip of broken stone pavement. The land was protected from the
river by a stone building with its windows boarded up and its
solitary crane out of repair, whilst on the other side was a high
wooden fencing, and three tarred huts stood at right angles to the
lane.</p>

<p>On the Monday evening we have mentioned it had been raining and
the air was still moist and the sky overcast. As Jim Stroud came up
the lane from the yard, a young man with a pale face and a mop of
dark hair appeared at the doorway of this deserted wharf.</p>

<p>He put his head out and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Stroud."</p>

<p>Jim stared at this peculiar apparition without much interest or
apprehension, merely acknowledging his name by not denying it. And
then the young man suddenly delivered himself of the following
incredible speech. He said:</p>

<p>"Look here, Jim Stroud. This has got to stop. No one can prevent
you living with Emma if she wishes it. But if she does you've got
to treat her decently. If you strike her or knock her about again,
you'll have to answer for it."</p>

<p>Jim Stroud was a man of remarkably few words when sober. He
would frequently go through a day's work without speaking to any
one. On this occasion he did not belie his reputation in this
respect. He simply pushed through the doorway and pushed the young
man back. He then forced the door to behind him.</p>

<p>They were then alone in the deserted wharf. Even then he did not
seem to show any inclination to speak. He came grimly onwards till
he had the young man's face silhouetted against the black hoarding
and then he struck at it with his right fist.</p>

<p>In the fight which followed one of the most disconcerting things
for Wainwright was this utter silence of his opponent. He never
said a word. Whether he knew all about Wainwright and his
relationship to Emma, or whether he looked upon this as merely an
ordinary wharfside social amenity, Wainwright was never able to
determine.</p>

<p>Wainwright had done a little boxing at school, but he had never
fought with bare knuckles in his life. He knew that his chances
against the stone-mason were about one in a hundred, but it
required some fantastic demand on fate such as these odds suggested
to attune him to his new mood. His mind was working very rapidly.
He felt exhilarated and utterly indifferent to his danger. He knew
that there were one or two things in his favour. He was quicker
than his opponent, and he had plenty of elbow room. There was,
moreover, no friendly referee to give a breather. His tactics must
be to exhaust and wind his man.</p>

<p>He met the first onrush of Stroud's terrific blows on his arms.
They hurt, and so did his own knuckles when he got them to Shroud's
ribs. The man was horribly strong. Wainwright darted round him, and
sometimes simply ran away. If he could have got the other to run
after him the tactics might have paid, but Stroud was in no hurry.
He just turned and followed him grimly and slowly, certain of his
prey.</p>

<p>Wainwright tried to remember some of the instructions of his old
gym. instructor up in Yorkshire. He remembered one point, though
rather vaguely. It concerned what he called "in-fighting." He knew
that if he could get his opponent to lunge heavily at his face, and
then step quickly to the left he could crash with his right to the
other's jaw. He knew that the jaw was the place to go for.</p>

<p>"You could knock a giant out if you tap him on the side of the
jaw," he seemed to hear his old instructor say. Shroud's jaw was a
massive affair, and it seemed terribly inaccessible, with two steel
bands swinging in front of it. Nevertheless, Wainwright made a
sudden determination to try desperately for the other's jaw. He
went straight at him, giving blow for blow. In two minutes he was
lying on his back in the mud, a blow over the heart like a kick
from a horse having laid him there.</p>

<p>He leapt to his feet, and rushed in again. Four times he tried
these rushing tactics, and four times he measured his length on the
ground. Something else would have to be done. A fine rain was
falling, some gulls were whining overhead. Blood was flowing from
his mouth, the result of some blow of which he had no recollection.
He knew he was badly cut, bruised, and damaged, but it didn't seem
to matter. He became like a primitive thing, indifferent to pain,
obsessed with the one idea&mdash;to get one blow in on the point of
that jaw.</p>

<p>He was fighting, being beaten and was enjoying the analysis of
his sensations under the trial. He had no idea the mind could think
so quickly; he was intensely alert for any strategic advantage; at
the same time all sorts of other things kept racing through his
brain, odd and ridiculous trifles, snatches of music, nothing
whatever to do with the bitter case in hand. He fought
mechanically, darting in and breaking away, receiving punishment
and inflicting none. Little pools of water lay about the yard. The
men would sometimes splash into them, and Stroud's iron-bound boots
would slip upon a stone.</p>

<p>"If I can get him on to that wet pavement, he might trip up in
those boots," suddenly occurred to Wainwright. He worked his way
round so that his back was to the pavement. He was getting weaker.
Stroud came on doggedly, driving him back. Foot by foot he gave
way. At last he felt his heel touch the stone. Now was the time to
be wary. He appeared to be making a great effort, and then suddenly
threw up his arms helplessly and fell back. Stroud with a growl
rushed in to finish him off. Wainwright heard his iron-clamped
boots strike the stone pavement. He saw his malevolent face as he
struck with his left. Wainwright sidestepped, and knew that the
other had missed and lost his balance. He felt the blow graze his
temple, and then with every ounce of strength that was left in him,
he swung his right to the point of the stonemason's jaw.</p>

<p>It was not till he beheld his opponent lying insensible on the
pavement that Wainwright realized that three spectators had been
watching the fight. They were three other men from the mason's
yard, and they might have been there all the time for all he knew.
They ran up, and one said:</p>

<p>"Bravo, lad, you're a bonny fighter. My God You've knocked out
old Jim Stroud!"</p>

<p>They seemed immensely impressed by the fact, and quite
indifferent to the cause of the quarrel. On Wharf-side men often
fight for the sake of fighting. Two of them propped Jim up and
bathed his face.</p>

<p>"You put him to sleep a treat," said one. "He'll be all right in
half an hour. What's your name, lad?"</p>

<p>"Plinth."</p>

<p>"Plinth! That's a funny name. You ought to be
a&mdash;stone-mason."</p>

<p>"Plinth" bathed his face and staggered home. He was feeling very
groggy. He managed to stagger to bed. He stayed there for three
days, telling his forlorn landlady that he had been in a cab
accident. She said: "Reely! How awful!" but took no further
interest in the matter. All night he was in a mild fever, going
over every incident of the fight. He was obsessed by one fantastic
whim. He wished Emma had been there to see it!</p>

<p>He had done it for her, fought for her, proved that in the end
he was more of a man than her man. It was only right she should
have beheld his triumph. Besides, it might have made all the
difference. This man had no more legal claim on her than he had.
She was only frightened of him. She was attracted by certain virile
qualities in him, and somehow Wainwright had not so far impressed
her in that way. And yet, God in Heaven! what did she think? Were
all women enigmas?</p>

<p>Come what may, nothing would ever be quite the same after this.
When he got about again he avoided Kensington Gardens and their
other favourite haunts.</p>

<p>"She must send for me," he thought autocratically.</p>

<p>Ten days went by, and he was becoming anxious. And then one
morning there arrived by post a scrawled note.</p>

<p class="letter">"Meet me to-morrow night at the lane by Potter's
Wharf at nine o'clock.&mdash;E."</p>

<p>A quiet sense of triumph stole over him. She had had to write
after all. He had asserted his position as the dynamic male.
Probably she had heard of his victory and his courage. Now
everything would become gradually different. He spent the day
calmly at his work, the <i>Charles II Doorways</i> being nearly
complete.</p>

<p>At half-past eight he left home. He knew Potter's Wharf well.
The little winding lane at the back was a popular rendezvous of
theirs. There were some quiet seats near there underneath a clump
of willows by the riverside. It was a favourite resort of
Hammersmith lovers. It was getting dark as he crossed the bridge,
but the sky was clear and the air warm with the breath of early
summer. A glorious evening for lovers. He hummed to himself as he
took the first turning in Potter's Lane.</p>

<p>And then the thing happened with dramatic suddenness. There was
a sharp bend by the wall and an open piece of land stretching to
the water-side. As he swung round the corner, four figures closed
on him. They were in khaki. A red-faced sergeant said:</p>

<p>"This is the young man we want. You're under arrest, Mr. Plinth
or Wainwright, or whatever you call yourself. Fall in, son."</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second the world seemed to rock, his heart
beat with sickening fear, the colour left his lips. Then he looked
up. Some gulls went screaming into the evening sky, the great river
still glided to the wastes. All was movement, and betokened a world
of invisible activities. Low against a wall a girl was crouching, a
girl with grey watchful eyes, the only person who knew, the only
one he had ever told that he vas a deserter. The evening star
glimmered above the bridge in a sky that appeared too light and
fragile to hold so precious a diadem. He looked round at the men,
then pulling himself up, he faced about and said quietly:</p>

<p>"All right, Sergeant. I'm ready."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>26. The Most Wonderful Thing in
the World</h2>

<p>It seemed too good to be true. To-morrow she would be home.
Home! magic and immortal word. Little Miss Bracegirdle sipped her
tea and sank back against the cushions. Her sister-in-law's flat in
Ashley Gardens was cosily furnished, but it was not home. Her
sister-in-law was talking to her in her gruff manly
voice&mdash;blunt, outspoken and a good sort summed up Laura
Sieveright&mdash;but Millicent Bracegirdle was too preoccupied with
her own anticipations to pay particular heed to any discourse.
To-morrow she would be back in her own rooms at the deanery.
Easingstoke! The dear, sleepy, familiar little town. The Cathedral
close, the elms, the Queen Anne houses with their white doors and
brass knockers, the rooks chattering above, the river ambling
between the high red-brick houses, leaving them reluctantly for the
meadows and the sea.</p>

<p>Across the close her brother, the dean, would come, his gown
fluttering in the breeze, sheathes of papers under his
arm&mdash;always so rushed, dear Peter. There had been times when
she hardly dare hope to see Easingstoke again. She loved it so
passionately that she had tried to thrust it from her mind, as one
might try to blur the image of an inaccessible lover.</p>

<p>For ten months she had been a wanderer and outcast. During the
preceding summer a chill caught in Scotland had led to a severe
attack of congestion of the lungs. And that was not all. A
learned-looking gentleman in Harley Street had tapped her all over,
and held mysterious rubber tubes to her back and chest. And he had
shaken his head pontifically and enunciated her doom:</p>

<p>"You must winter abroad. There's no help for it."</p>

<p>Followed then much bitterness and misgiving, a fluttering and
arranging and a hundred farewells and then&mdash;Madeira. Oh, the
dreariness of those long months. What are sunshine and warmth when
your heart is elsewhere? What are the orange groves of the south
compared with the bleak meadows of the north, peopled by the ghosts
of all that we hold dear?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, one must not be unmindful of God's bountiful
goodness. That same learned gentleman had again applied his little
rubber tubes. The oracle had again spoken:</p>

<p>"It is a complete cure. The lung is entirely unaffected."</p>

<p>Completely cured and going home to Easingstoke! Oh, she would
like to cut short Laura's harangue. What <i>was</i> she talking
about? Oh, yes, of course, about the unfairness to women of some
law regarding divorce. What did it matter? She wanted to run out of
the flat, to fly to the station and scream into the ticket
office:</p>

<p>"Third single to Easingstoke, please."</p>

<p>But no, she must be patient till the morrow. The dear Dean had
written one of his charming and affectionate letters. He wanted her
to do him a great favour. His old friend, Dr. Mildmay Midstone, was
lecturing that evening at some hall in the city on a subject which
was leading to bitter and acrimonious discussion throughout the
ecclesiastical world, namely. the vexed question of the revision of
the Prayer Book. Owing to a diocesan conference, he, the Dean, was
unable to attend. But as Millicent was actually to be passing
through London that day he would be extremely grateful if she would
go to the lecture and give him a short précis of Dr. Midstone's
opinion. Of course, it was unavoidable.</p>

<p>Moreover, she would have to attend the lecture alone, because
Laura said she did not want to go. That was so like Laura, so
characteristic. She did things&mdash;not because it was right to do
them, or because it was her duty&mdash;but because she wanted to.
In the same way she didn't do things because she didn't want to do
them. With regard to this lecture she actually said that she
"didn't want to go to the silly old lecture," and added that she
"didn't care whether they revised the Prayer Book or not." But that
was just Laura, of course. She was <i>so</i> amusing, <i>such</i> a
character!</p>

<p>They sat a long time over tea, Millicent talking and listening
abstractedly. The lecture was not till eight o'clock. At six
o'clock the evening paper was brought in. Laura picked it up. She
glanced at the first page and remarked:</p>

<p>"Quite right too! No reprieve for that man Holies."</p>

<p>"What is that, dear?" said Millicent.</p>

<p>"He's a beauty, he is. A married man with children, been
carrying on for years with a married woman. The husband caught him
one night, and Holles hit him over the head with a spanner and
killed him. He's going to be hanged to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"How awful!"</p>

<p>Millicent wished that her sister-in-law hadn't told her about
this grim tragedy. She seldom read the newspapers, and, in any
case, always studiously avoided reading about crimes. There was so
much beauty in the world&mdash;She, she couldn't be sure whether it
was right to know about these things or not. They upset one so. At
Easingstoke people never discussed them. Neither did they in
Madeira. In Madeira everyone seemed gentle, delicate and pleasant.
Even the natives were like that. There were lots of churches,
flowers, promenades and invalid carriages. But no one seemed to be
frightfully ill, and no one was ever reported as doing anything
frightfully wicked. The abrupt transition from this atmosphere to a
sordid London tragedy was almost too painful, and Laura had a way
of almost gloating over it. Wasn't that perhaps the most tragic
side of tragedy that people did indeed gloat over it? Tragedy
breeds tragedy. Crime breeds crime.</p>

<p>Laura's terse summary of the affair seemed to cast an ugly
glamour over more than one aspect of vice. It was not only that the
poor wretched man was a murderer. But little Miss Bracegirdle
refused to gloat. She refused to assist in any way. When a man is
hanged the spirit of a community follows him to the scaffold, and
thereby becomes polluted. That is what she believed.</p>

<p>"It matters less about the criminal than about the hangman."</p>

<p>She did not say this to her sister-in-law, but her mind
registered the reflection as she moved across to the window and
looked down into the darkening streets, where newsboys with raucous
voices were gloatingly announcing:</p>

<p>"No reprieve for Vauxhall murderer!"</p>

<p>"I think I will go and change my frock," she said.</p>

<p>Laura was going out to dinner with some friends, so Millicent
had a little supper by herself at seven o'clock. and then set out
for the lecture.</p>

<p>She took a bus to Charing Cross and walked up the Strand. The
streets were crowded with people, and gaily lighted. By the time
she reached the Strand the news about there being no reprieve for a
murderer was almost stale. Something else was happening&mdash;in
Turkey this time. Old men were selling gollywogs. Wounded
ex-service men were playing cornets, grinding barrel-organs and
singing. She gave one a penny and hurried on as if she had
committed an offence. Desperate-looking painted women flashed by. A
large policeman, with white cotton gloves, juggled nonchalantly
with the traffic. Nobody took any notice of Miss BracegirdIe. She
was as inconspicuous in that crowd as one of the wooden blocks with
which the Strand was paved.</p>

<p>As she hurried on this feeling of loneliness pervaded her. At
odd queer moments she knew that she had experienced it all her
life. It was always her sense of duty which prevented her giving
way to it. Alone, alone, utterly alone. Even at Easingstoke, even
at Madeira, but here more especially than anywhere, amidst this
great bustling, self-contained crowd of strangers. And yet her
heart ached for them. On many of the faces she read the soul-hunger
which consumed herself. They, too, were lonely, shouting into the
void, yearning for something they knew not what. How wicked she was
to think like that. She, whose health had been restored to her, who
was blessed with every worldly and spiritual comfort. She was
wicked and selfish. She must think of others, help them, bring
light and happiness into their dark lives. Her dear
brother&mdash;</p>

<p>The lecture hall was not so crowded as the importance of the
occasion led her to expect. As she glanced at the sparsely filled
benches, she thought of Laura. "I don't care whether they revise
the Prayer Book or not." She sighed. Laura represented the great
bulk of people she feared. At Easingstoke the matter might seem
impressive and vital, but here nobody cared. They were out in the
streets, in the restaurants, in the music-halls and cinemas, swarms
of lonely people trying to escape from themselves. The Prayer Book!
They hardly knew what a Prayer Book was.</p>

<p>Dr. Midstone came on the platform, a tall, cadaverous,
scholarly-looking man with gold-rimmed glasses. He had a very
pronounced stoop, and a way of thrusting out his long arms
menacingly at the audience as though he were warding off blows. His
voice was rich and full, and regulated by that "sing" which
everyone connected with the Church seems to think indispensable. He
spoke clearly and conviningly, but without a shade of passion.</p>

<p>He had been speaking for nearly twenty minutes when a terrible
realization came to Millicent. She was not listening. Somehow the
disturbing mood of the evening still obsessed her. She was thinking
of other things, of the people she had seen in the street, 0f
herself, of life in the abstract. Her conscience challenged her.
"Do you yourself really care whether they revise the Prayer Book or
not?"</p>

<p>She blushed at the sheer wickedness of the thought She
<i>must</i> concentrate. What would she be able to say to her
brother if she could not remember broadly the gist of Dr.
Midstone's discourse? Now what is he saying?</p>

<p>For nearly five minutes she followed the speaker closely. Then
she found herself thinking about a man she used to know fifteen
years ago. She was a girl then, and he was&mdash;oh, he was a
splendid person, and he used to come to the deanery smelling of
Harris tweed. He was large and breezy and...one day he ran away
with a girl employed at a local dairy. Fifteen years ago.
Heigh-ho!</p>

<p>Dr. Midstone was certainly rather verbose. The minds of other
people were wandering, too. Hands were raised to conceal furtive
yawns. It would be interesting to know the thoughts that pass
through the minds of a hundred people when listening to a
sermon.</p>

<p>Perhaps the journey had tired her. She simply could not
concentrate. It was half-past nine when the lecture was over, and
she had no clear idea as to whether Dr. Midstone was in favour of
or opposed to the idea of revising the Prayer Book. It was awful.
She could not lie to her brother. She would have to confess that
she was too tired to listen.</p>

<p>But once out in the air again she did not feel tired at all. On
the contrary, she felt peculiarly buoyant. She decided to walk
home. It was not far, and Laura would not be home till past ten.
The streets were still crowded, although their character was
changing. The profit-seeker was giving way to the pleasure-seeker.
People were darting in and out of doors and taxi-cabs on dubious
errands. The roar of the traffic was broken by the fragmentary
exchange of confidences and appeals. The beggar was evident with
his shuffle, and his hope-surrendered glance. Hatless people in
evening dress were dawdling outside a theatre, taking a breather
between the acts. A drunken man rolled across the street, treating
the traffic with the sublime indifference of his kind. A swerving
taxi missed him by a matter of inches, and he turned round and put
his tongue out at the driver. It was thrilling. Miss Bracegirdle
was conscious of a profound sense of contentment. Her heart
expanded. She loved all these people, with their frailties, and
passions, and queer attitude towards an existence which was
entirely alien to her own. She yearned for someone to talk to, to
share the spectacle with; otherwise her spirits were in the
ascendant. Life seemed a bigger thing than the lecture of Dr.
Midstone. She passed Trafalgar Square and walked down Whitehall, a
deserted but still impressive fulcrum of a mighty empire. Whitehall
excited her enormously. She did not know what all the buildings
were, but her mind was busy with the ghosts who peopled it. Pitt,
Chatham, john Bright, and Gladstone. To think that she, little Miss
Bracegirdle, from Easingstoke, was walking over the very flags that
the feet of these great men had touched! She passed the Abbey and
the House, which was lighted up. Fancy, at that very moment all
those clever gentlemen were sitting there passing acts and bills
for the people's good! It seemed so splendid of them to sit up late
in the evening to do this, whilst the people themselves were mostly
enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>She crossed over to Victoria Street and took a turning on the
left. She walked on for several hundred yards and then realized she
had taken the wrong turning. She ought to have taken the turning
that led direct to the new Roman Catholic Cathedral. Instead of
that she had turned too soon. She was about to retrace her steps
and then reflected that it would make no difference. She would
certainly be able to work her way round to Ashley Gardens by
bearing to the right She passed a row of meagre shops and stalls.
She was in one of those slums that one comes on more abruptly in
London than in any other city of the world. It impressed her as
strange that within five minutes' walk of all those gentlemen
passing bills for the good of the people some of these same people
were living in filth and squalor. A curious inexplicable world.</p>

<p>It was a long way before she came to a turning on the right, and
this seemed to lead to a more poverty-stricken district still. All
this area lay almost between the shadows of two mighty cathedrals.
This could hardly lead to Ashley Gardens. Miss Bracegirdle had lost
herself, and there was no one about she felt she could ask to
direct her.</p>

<p>She was about to turn back when at the corner of a mews the
amazing experience happened to her.</p>

<p>There was a woman with a baby in her arms talking angrily to a
boy about twelve years old. She was apparently requesting him to do
something which he refused to do. She used words which Miss
Bracegirdle knew not the meaning of, but which she sensed as being
vehicles of profanity and obscenity. She was hurrying by when the
woman suddenly turned to her and said:</p>

<p>"Here, lidy, you're the sort. Hold my baby a minute."</p>

<p>Before she had time to grasp what it was all about, Millicent
Bracegirdle found a baby in her arms, and the woman had darted into
the mews and the boy after her.</p>

<p>All her life Miss Bracegirdle had been schooled to acts of
Christian charity. It was her habit of mind and heart to sacrifice
herself for others. But there was about this sudden action an
element of outrage. The woman had not asked her or given her a
chance of refusing. She did not want to hold the baby, but perhaps
her most incisive resentment was that she was about to be made
ridiculous. She had sometimes held her little nieces in her arms,
but she knew nothing about babies. It would cry or scream. Perhaps
it wasn't clean. Really, too bad! Nobody had apparently observed
the episode except the boy. Oh, well, perhaps the woman would
really only be a minute. There was nothing to do but wait. She
peeped into the mews. It was not exactly a mews. It was more like a
narrow alley leading to another mean street at the end. At the
further corner she noticed a shabby little public-house. Ah, that
was it! The dreadful woman had gone in there to get a drink. There
was a very just law that women must not take their babies into
these awful places. But how callous and terrible! What did the
baby's mother know of her? Fancy a woman's craving for drink being
so strong that she would even risk losing her baby for the sake of
it. Miss Bracegirdle waited patiently, but the woman did not
return. Five minutes, ten minutes went by and nothing happened. She
began to get scared. Once she thought she saw the boy in the alley.
She walked into it, but she could not find him. Other bedraggled
people passed her, but no one took any notice of her. If the woman
did not come soon, there would be no alternative but to look into
the public-house and see if she were there. In the meantime the
baby was sleeping peacefully in her arms. She waited twenty
minutes, then she screwed up her courage and walked timidly up to
the public-house. She tried to peer in, but the glass was opaque.
Nothing to do but go boldly in. She pushed the door open and
entered. In the bar were some eight or ten people drinking. She had
hardly time to glance round before a rough voice bawled out:</p>

<p>"'Ere! out you go! You can't bring a baby in 'ere!"</p>

<p>If the man had struck her with a whip he could not have jarred
her sensibilities more acutely. She, Millicent Bracegirdle, sister
of the Dean of Easingstoke, being brutally ordered out of a common
public-house, holding an unwanted and unexplainable infant in her
arms! In that instant she experienced a terrifying vision of
Easingstoke&mdash;if anyone she knew had seen her!</p>

<p>Fortunately for her spirit of self-respect, her mind was
instantly occupied by the more pressing claims of her predicament.
She had time to observe that the woman was not there.</p>

<p>She backed out flushed and discomforted. On the pavement once
more she was slightly encouraged by a familiar apparition&mdash;the
boy, who had apparently been watching her proceedings. She ran up
to him.</p>

<p>"Little boy, where is&mdash;the lady? the baby's mother?"</p>

<p>The boy grinned at her stupidly, and she repeated the question.
Then he made a funny noise and pointed at his ears and mouth. He
was deaf and dumb. She tried to make signs to him with her
disengaged arm, but he laughed and ran up the street. The position
then was indeed serious.</p>

<p>If the woman did not appear soon there was only one course of
action to follow. She must give the child up to the police. She
strolled indeterminately up and down the alley. The place smelt
eerie and dank. Disreputable people drifted by her, mostly coming
or going to the public-house. In one of the buildings she heard a
child screaming.</p>

<p>The baby in her arms began to stir. She felt his little legs
kicking feebly against her thin breasts. At that instant a strange
yearning came over her. Lonely...lonely. The mother had deserted
her child. Poor little mite! It was in her power to take him away
from this wretched environment, to bring him up in healthy
surroundings, in clean sweet air and simple faith. Perhaps it was
the mother's wish.</p>

<p>Oh, how she had desired a child. The physical aspects of
marriage had always appeared to her alarming, but&mdash;a
<i>child</i>. She had hardly dare visualize the blinding joys of
motherhood. And at that moment all the repressions and inhibitions
of her life reacted to a spiritual call. Her breath came in little
stabs. Would it be wicked? very, very wicked? Perhaps the law would
not allow her. Her brother, the Dean, what would he say?</p>

<p>It was as though the strange mood which had obsessed her all the
evening had here found its solution. She had never faced so
venturesome, so desperate a temptation. So consumed was she with
the central fact of her potentiality, she could not envisage
details. All these minor things would work themselves out if she
could only make peace with her conscience.</p>

<p>It was nearly an hour since the woman had left. She must have
intended to desert this little waif. She waited the full hour,
flustered and tremulous. Then she went back into the street. A
policeman was standing at the corner. She went by him furtively,
re-traced her steps to Victoria Street, and returned to Ashley
Gardens. Laura had just come in, and was smoking a cigarette in
front of the fire. When she saw Millicent with the baby in her
arms, she uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"What in God's name&mdash;"</p>

<p>Millicent told her story quietly.</p>

<p>"A woman thrust it in my arms and went away. I waited an hour.
She didn't return."</p>

<p>"But, you idiot! What have you brought it here for? Why didn't
you give it to the police?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know. I thought I'd keep it."</p>

<p>And then Laura must needs throw herself on to the Chesterfield
and scream with laughter. Millicent 'vas hurt. Laura's harsh,
ironic laughter jarred her. What was there so funny about her
keeping the child? When Laura could control herself, she said:</p>

<p>"Dear lunatic, of course you can't do it. You would not be
allowed to without the mother's consent&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have a feeling the mother would consent. She wanted to get
rid of it."</p>

<p>Again Laura was obliged to double up with laughter. Millicent
was getting angry.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. You're a scream, Milly. You look so funny
sitting there holding the baby as though it were made of glass. You
go out to a lecture on the revision of the Prayer Book, and come
back with a wretched little brat, which you calmly announce you're
going to adopt. Let's have a look at it."</p>

<p>She walked across the room and lifted a gauze veil which had
been concealing the baby's face. It was still sleeping, a plump,
pretty little thing, with its tiny fist thrust confidingly against
Millicent's breast.</p>

<p>"It's sweet," said Millicent in a faint voice.</p>

<p>"It's not too bad," said Laura. "But it's no good, my dear. It's
no good being foolish about it. Why, you don't even know how to
feed it. Perhaps the mother feeds it. You don't know how old it is,
or anything."</p>

<p>"I shall go across and see Mrs. Browning in the flat opposite.
She has two babies of her own. She will know."</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd. Let me take it downstairs to the policeman at
the corner."</p>

<p>Miss Bracegirdle's eyes flashed with sudden anger.</p>

<p>"Policeman! what should a policeman know about a baby? Why
should we send him to prison like a criminal&mdash;the innocent
mite. It must be nearly time he had his milk. It is an hour and a
half already since the mother left him. Oh, leave me alone."</p>

<p>Laura had never seen her sister-in-law before in so fierce a
mood. Her laughter and incredulity died down. Within a few minutes
Millicent was in Mrs. Browning's flat making Allenbury's and being
instructed in the first principles of baby-craft.</p>

<p>Mrs. Browning was a large, sympathetic person, who said:</p>

<p>"I should certainly keep it for the night, my dear. To-morrow we
can think what is the best thing to do."</p>

<p>When Millicent had borrowed a cot, given the baby its milk and
ensconced it comfortably in her own bedroom, Laura came in and
tried her trump card.</p>

<p>"There's just one thing I'd like to point out to you, Milly. You
left Easingstoke last summer and went to Scotland. There you were
taken ill. You were unable to go back to Easingstoke. You went
abroad. Everybody in Easingstoke heard all about it. Very good. You
are away ten months, and then suddenly you turn up with a baby you
can't explain. You say someone left it in your arms in London. It
sounds like the stork story. What <i>do</i> you think people will
say?"</p>

<p>Millicent had not thought. She cried out passionately:</p>

<p>"Say! What do I care what they say! Nobody who knows me&mdash;my
brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, of course, of course. But people <i>will</i> talk, you
know. Mrs. Rusbridger, that old cat Lady Ninelms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Laura, don't be so disgusting&mdash;so mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>Laura shrugged her shoulders, kissed Millicent in the cheek, and
maliciously hoped that she would have a good night.</p>

<p>Millicent indeed had a wonderful night, perhaps the most
wonderful night she had ever enjoyed in her life. She was a
creature suddenly metamorphosed. Her eyes shone with the light of
one beholding revelation. She was a protector, a person of
responsibility, above all things she was&mdash;a mother!</p>

<p>She hung round the cot like a tigress watching a cub. She obeyed
Mrs. Browning's instructions meticulously. When the baby began to
cry she turned it over, rocked it gently, and crooned phrases of an
old half-forgotten lullaby. It was midnight before she could bring
herself to undress and get into her own bed, and even then she lay
awake watching the cot, and constantly peeping at the little
innocent face within.</p>

<p>Laura's Parthian shaft troubled her but little. She refused to
believe that anyone in Easingstoke would harbour such disgusting
suspicions of her. And if they did&mdash;what did it matter? Was
this not something greater and more ennobling? Was it not the most
wonderful thing in the world?...motherhood without passion. The
mother of God...she dozed, and dreamed. Little man, little man. He
would grow up and she would teach him to speak. In years to come he
would gamb?l at her knees. He would call her mummy. Oh, she would
make such a good and beautiful boy of him. She would teach him to
pray, and then the baby lessons, the unfolding of a dormant
soul.</p>

<p>She slept fitfully and dreamed again. She could see him going
off to school with his satchel, kissing her good-bye. In the
evening frowning over his lessons, asking her questions. And she
would put him to bed again, watching him, ministering to him,
mothering his mind with inspiring precepts and thoughts. And he
would go to college, a jolly, breezy boy. fond of games and open
air and intellectual experiments. He would come to her with all his
troubles..."Mummy, I'm sorry..." Oh, how kind she would be to him,
how helpful, how proud to sacrifice herself. How proud to be seen
with him, to lean upon his strong young arms. The years would creep
upon her noiselessly, unwittingly, and she would not mind. All that
she had to give of spirit, heart and matter should be his, joyous
and welcome gifts. The clean young man with strong limbs and a
radiant mind would look up to her and love her. His letters...his
work, and then perhaps one day another woman. Ah! she would not
resent that. Her little man would not be likely to make mistakes.
She would love this other woman as a daughter. She would be getting
old then, old and weary of the physical struggle just to live. Even
as a girl she could listen to the "Nunc dimittis" and her heart
would be filled with a kind of quiet joy of resignation. God's
will. If she could just live to see his children. The richness and
the fullness of her life was overbearing. She had always had so
much to give. And now...oh, little man, little man.</p>

<p>She drifted away to a dreamless sleep, only to be awakened by a
disconcerting sound. The baby was crying. She started from her bed.
She was tired and lethargic. She had perhaps only slept a few
minutes&mdash;she could not tell. There was milk to warm, the
bottle to rinse out and fill, the rubber teat to inspect and see
that the milk did not come too quickly. Otherwise the poor mite
would have indigestion. Surprising the number of little things to
think of and do in connection with so fragile a body. She must not
give way. She must learn to school herself to sleepless nights, to
petty worries and abrupt fears. The path of childh?od is
honeycombed with pitfalls and dangers. If anything should happen to
him? But no, that was the first thing&mdash;to believe that nothing
could happen, to trust in the mercy of God. Apart from this, to do
one's best, to go on.</p>

<p>She was indeed tired when morning came. The emotional strain of
this novel experience, the lack of sleep, and the keen anxiety with
regard to the future all combined to sap her physical strength. But
her nervous energy keyed her almost to a state of exuberance. It
was she who was inclined to laugh, and Laura who was inclined to be
touchy. Laura was one of those people who are always at their worst
in the morning, and in the raw cold light she protested that "this
baby idea is just silly."</p>

<p>Millicent could not be argued with. Both Laura and Mrs. Browning
affirmed that she could not possibly take the baby away without
giving information to the police, and having inquiries made. She
would be likely to get into trouble, imprisonment perhaps. But
Millicent shook her head and went on calmly making her
arrangements. She meant to catch the 4.45 to Easingstoke.</p>

<p>She walked up and down the rooms, holding the baby in her arms,
her flesh exulting at the magic of that warm contact. She bathed
him, and dressed him, and fed him with his many bottles. She was
wildly happy, trying to thrust back the doubts and menaces which
assailed her through the telepathic communion with her two
sceptical friends. She would not discuss the matter with them. She
was too fearful to see that they were right. If only she could get
away to Easing-stoke...the afternoon found her in a fever to be
gone. It was as if the waves of fear were flooding her from
without. She dreaded the ring of the bell, the tap on the door. She
visualized burly policemen and inspectors accusing her, perhaps
taking her to prison. Well, she would face them all. If it must be
prison, then let it be. What kind of love is it that will not risk
chains and manacles, nay, even a crown of thorns?</p>

<p>Three o'clock. In another hour she would be free. She would
escape with her treasure from this sordid and terrifying city. She
sketchily packed her own trunk. Laura had gone to a matinée,
thoroughly disgruntled with her sister-in-law's absurd behaviour.
Her delicate fingers trembled as she collected her simple
belongings. The day was misty and the rooms were already
darkening.</p>

<p>Going from her bedroom to the sitting-room to collect some
books, she suddenly started. Her heart beat violently against her
ribs. And yet it was only the ring of the front-door bell.</p>

<p>She stood there almost unable to move, as she heard the maid go
to the door. There was a muttering in the hall, and the maid came
in.</p>

<p>"Please, miss, there's a&mdash;person to see you."</p>

<p>She could not speak. She merely nodded a resigned acquiescence.
Within a minute a woman was standing before her. Millicent could
not but observe that she was almost pretty, with dark, bright eyes
and full passionate lips. At the same time it was the face of a
woman emerging from a terrible experience, like a patient coming-to
after an anaesthetic. She looked bedraggled and awful. The woman
stared at her and said dully but deliberately:</p>

<p>"I've come for my baby."</p>

<p>Millicent felt too stunned to scream the protest which her heart
dictated. She returned the same dull stare whilst her mind sought
defensive weapons. She repeated meaninglessly:</p>

<p>"Your baby."</p>

<p>"Yus. I've come for my baby."</p>

<p>Should she deny that the baby was there? should she lie? or
bribe, plead, cajole or fight?</p>

<p>A second's reflection and she knew that she could do none of
these things. She merely said limply:</p>

<p>"Why did you&mdash;-how did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The woman did not seem unduly surprised at the vague queries.
She said:</p>

<p>"My other boy&mdash;the deaf and dumb one&mdash;followed you
home."</p>

<p>Millicent said: "I see," as though it were a most ordinary
experience. But a slight feeling of faintness came over her, and
she sat down on an upright chair. Suddenly the woman seemed to
emerge from the slattern of the street into an impressive figure.
She glanced round the room and said in a rough coarse voice:</p>

<p>"Gawd! what do you know of the life we lead&mdash;you
people!"</p>

<p>Advancing upon Millicent, she keyed her voice to an hysterical
pitch.</p>

<p>"Do you know why I left my baby with you? Because I couldn't
face the night and dawn. You'd do the same if you was me. Do you
think I'd 'ave got through that night waiting for eight o'clock
this morning&mdash;waiting for the hour to strike, and 'im waiting
there in 'is cell. And we <i>was</i> something to each other in the
past. We was, you know, in spite of 'er. I drunk myself till I
didn't know what was what last night. You'd 'ave done the
same&mdash;I knew nothing till two hours ago. It was all over then.
Oh, my Gawd!"</p>

<p>What was it all about? What was this woman saying? Who was "'im
waiting there in 'is cell"? What had happened? What was it the
woman couldn't face? Little Miss Bracegirdle sat upright on her
chair, her eyes straining at the other as though she would read her
soul. She heard her own voice whisper:</p>

<p>"What has happened?"</p>

<p>The woman was crying sloppily and savagely, dabbing her pink
eyes with a filthy rag, biting the end of it in nervous agitation.
After her outburst she had turned and leant sideways on the arm of
the Chesterfield. Now she swung round on Millicent again. Her voice
was tense, and yet not untinged with that furtive enjoyment of
horror, which is characteristic of a certain class. She judged her
dramatic periods with a nice appreciation of their efffect. She
said:</p>

<p>"Don't you know? Don't you know what's happened?"</p>

<p>"No." She nodded her head in the direction of the other
room.</p>

<p>"'is father...my 'usband...'e was 'anged at 'Olloway this
mornin' at eight o'clock."</p>

<p>Millicent again heard her own voice say inanely:</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Holles."</p>

<p>There was nothing to say. But a prodigious amount to think. Miss
Bracegirdle suddenly found herself weeping. Her thoughts ran riot
in overlapping reflections. Her sensibilities appeared less
overwhelmed by the tragedy of this woman's position than by the
reflection that the baby, which had been so nearly hers, should
have a mother so coarse-fibred, a father...a murderer! The innocent
mite. And one day long ago that same father must have been as sweet
and pretty as the little thing in the next room. Years of training
and teaching and striving and then&mdash;"hanged by the neck until
dead." Could it be possible that the vicious germs were already
there in that sleeping unconscious organism? or wasn't it rather
environment, bad influence? Wasn't her dream still worth fighting
for?</p>

<p>Miss Bracegirdle thrust out her arms and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry...so sorry. How terrible." Then she added
desperately:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Holles, listen to me. Won't you let me have the baby to
look after? I will take care of him. He shall have every loving
care and kindness, good schooling, good influences, a
career...everything possible shall be done."</p>

<p>Over the mother's face there crept an expression of animal
unreason. A dangerous light flickered in her eyes. The sense of
theatricality evaporated. She spoke with cold, naked intensity:</p>

<p>"'Ere, none of that. You give me back my baby."</p>

<p>And then Miss Bracegirdle knew. She dropped her arms and shrank
back. She saw clearly and she saw it whole. It was not she, but
this woman facing her, who was the possessor of the most wonderful
thing in the world.</p>

<p>In a kind of trance she rose from her seat and conducted the
formalities of deliverance. She acted with calm dignity,
marshalling her emotions adroitly. She would not give way. The
beauty of that fabric we call life is dependent upon the finely
adjusted interweaving of heart and brain. Over this perhaps she had
not thought sufficiently&mdash;and yet, O God!</p>

<hr>

<p>The door had snapped to, and the woman and her baby gone.
Millicent was glad she had remembered one thing. She had given the
woman some money&mdash;all she had to spare. She had not given her
her address at Easingstoke. What was the use? About this affair
there could be no compromise. It must be one thing or the other.
She finished packing her bag, telephoned for a taxi, and drove to
the station.</p>

<p>"Third single to Easingstoke, please."</p>

<p>It was dark when she reached the old town of many churches. Her
brother met her at the station. He kissed her affectionately on
both cheeks, and helped her with her luggage into a horse cab.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, how are you?"</p>

<p>"Rather tired, Peter. I slept badly last night."</p>

<p>That was all she ever said about the episode of the baby, but
all the way along in the cab she was trying to imagine what it
would be like still holding the baby in her arms. Trying to imagine
it and not being able to. The familiar streets and landmarks, the
dim outline of the old Cathedral, the slow-moving people, the
propinquity of her brother combined to make the experience seem
unreal. Things like that didn't happen in Easingstoke. Nothing
changed. It was all as though she had never been away at all, as
though nothing had ever happened to her, or could happen.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, did you go and hear Dr.Midstone?"</p>

<p>Dr. Midstone! Yes, Dr. Midstone appeared a reality, and she
could not remember a word had said! She muttered something about a
most interesting discourse. She would defer details. She was so
tired.</p>

<p>Inside the deanery everything appeared almost unbelievably the
same. The cosy, rambling rooms, every chair and waste-paper basket
in its exactly right place. Mrs. Burnet, the plump housekeeper,
with the familiar waddle and smile and the cracked voice.</p>

<p>"Glad to hear thee 're better, miss."</p>

<p>The same quiet dinner, the Dean mildly garrulous concerning the
Diocesan Conference. Afterwards the drawing-room, with the two
lamps Maggie brings in while the Dean enjoys his one glass of port.
Framed woolwork and an etching of Ely Cathedral, a smoke-grey
Persian cat sleeping in front of the fire, utterly indifferent to
the comings and goings of mere mortals.</p>

<p>She looks into the flames and dreams. The bells of St. Mary's
are chiming. Idly she wonders why...St. Mary! Oh, little man.</p>

<p>Her brother joins her. They talk quietly and dispassionately
about familiar subjects and familiar people. She writes a letter to
her sister-in-law to thank her for her kindness. She puts it with
the Dean's letters in the basket in the hall.</p>

<p>It is ten o'clock. The servants are summoned, and the Dean
offers up a few short prayers, thanking God for the benefits and
the blessings of the day. Then everyone has cocoa and they retire
for the night.</p>

<p>Her bedroom with its white walls and chintz curtains smells
faintly of lavender and sandal-wood, and some kind of cleaning
soap. Over the fireplace is an ivory and ebony crucifix. On one
side a watercolour drawing of Lake Lucerne by a cousin. On the
other a reproduction of a painting of the Nativity by Cimabue. The
room is lighted by two candles. Maggie has already unpacked her
things. She disrobes almost stealthily as though the act of
disrobing were not quite a right and proper thing to do. She lets
her hair fall loosely round her shoulders, and standing in her
white night-dress looks at herself in the mirror. The plain,
ingenuous face with deep-set grey reflective eyes appears small in
its frame of dark brown. Beautiful hair, beautiful hair faintly
tinged with grey. Nobody ever sees her like that. Nobody ever sees
how beautiful her hair can look. A tear starts to her eye. She
dashes it away and ties her hair up in a knot, her white hands
moving rapidly and skilfully.</p>

<p>Then she kneels by the bed, her hands pressed on either side of
her temples.</p>

<p>And so we will leave her there, for we have no place in that
sanctuary, where little Miss Bracegirdle is confiding to her God
the spiritual record of her day.</p>
