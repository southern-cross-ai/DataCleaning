  Lenoble Of Beaubocage</h2>
<p>In the days when the Bourbon reigned over Gaul,  before the &ldquo;simple, sensuous, passionate&rdquo; verse of Alfred de Musset had  succeeded the <em>d&eacute;bonnaire</em> Muse of  B&eacute;ranger in the affections of young France, &mdash; in days when the site of the  Trocadero was a remote and undiscovered country, and the word &ldquo;exposition&rdquo;  unknown in the Academic dictionary, and the Gallic Augustus destined to rebuild  the city yet an exile, &mdash; a young law-student boarded, in common with other  students, in a big dreary-looking house at the corner of the Rue  Grande-Mademoiselle, abutting on the Place Lauzun, and within some ten minutes  walk of the Luxembourg. It was a very dingy quarter, though noble gentlemen and  lovely ladies had once occupied the great ghastly mansions, and disported  themselves in the gruesome gardens. But the young students were in nowise  oppressed by the ghastliness of their abode. They sang their B&eacute;ranger, and they  pledged each other in cheap Bordeaux, and clinked their glasses noisily in  their boisterous good-fellowship, and ate the messes compounded for them in a  darksome cupboard, known as the kitchen, by old Nanon the cook, purblind, stone-deaf,  and all but imbecile, and popularly supposed to be the venerable mother of  Madame Magnotte. The youngsters grumbled to each other about the messes when  they were unusually mysterious; and it must be owned that there were <em>vol-au-vents</em> and <em>fricandeaux</em> consumed in that establishment which were awful and  wonderful in their nature; but they ventured on no complaint to the mistress of  the mansion. She was a grim and terrible personage. Her terms were low, and she  treated her boarders <em>de haute en bas</em>.  If they were not content with her viands, they might go and find more agreeable  viands elsewhere.</p>
<p>Madame Magnotte was altogether mysterious and  inscrutable. Some people said that she was a countess, and that the wealth and  lands of her family had been confiscated by the committee of public unsafety in  &rsquo;93. Others declared that she had been a popular actress in a small theatre in  the days of Napoleon. She was tall and thin &mdash; nay, of an exceptional leanness &mdash;  and her complexion was of a more agreeable yellow than the butter that appeared  on her hospitable board; but she had flashing black eyes, and a certain  stateliness of gait and grandeur of manner that impressed those young  Bohemians, her boarders, with a kind of awe. They talked of her as the  &ldquo;countess,&rdquo; and by that name she was known to all inmates of the mansion; but  in all their dealings with her they treated her with unfailing respect.</p>
<p>One of the quietest among the young men who enjoyed  the privileges of Madame Magnotte&rsquo;s abode was a certain Gustave Lenoble, a  law-student, the only son of a very excellent couple who lived on their own  estate, near an obscure village in Normandy. The estate was of the smallest; a  dilapidated old house, known in the immediate neighbourhood as &ldquo;the Ch&acirc;teau,&rdquo;  and very dear to those who resided therein; a garden, in which everything  seemed to have run to seed; and about forty acres of the poorest land in  Normandy. These possessions constituted the patrimonial estate of Fran&ccedil;ois  Lenoble, <em>propri&eacute;taire</em>, of Beaubocage,  near Vevinordin, the department of Eure.</p>
<p>The people amongst whom the good man lived his  simple life called him M. Lenoble de Beaubocage, but he did not insist upon  this distinction; and on sending out his only son to begin the battle of life  in the great world of Paris, he recommended the young man to call himself  Lenoble, <em>tout court</em>.</p>
<p>The young man had never cherished any other design.  He was of all creatures the least presuming or pretentious. The father was  Legitimist to the very marrow; the son half Buonapartist, half republican. The  father and son had quarrelled about these differences of opinion sometimes in a  pleasantly disputatious manner; but no political disagreement could lesser the  love between these two. Gustave loved his parents as only a Frenchman can  venture to love his father and mother &mdash; with a devotion for the gentleman that  bordered on enthusiasm, with a fond reverence for the lady that was the very  essence of chivalry. There was a sister, who regarded her brother Gustave as  the embodiment of all that is perfect in youthful mankind; and there were a  couple of old house-servants, a very stupid clumsy lad in the stables, and half  a dozen old mongrel dogs, born and bred on the premises, who seemed to share  the young lady&rsquo;s opinions. There was not a little discussion upon the subject  of Gustave Lenoble&rsquo;s future career; and it was not without difficulty that the  father could be persuaded to approve the choice of a profession which the young  man had made. The seigneur of Beaubocage cherished an exaggerated pride of race  little suspected by those who saw his simple life, and were pleased by his  kindly unaffected manners. The house of Lenoble, at some remote and almost  mythical period of history, had distinguished itself in divers ways; and those  bygone grandeurs, vague and shadowy in the minds of all others, seemed very  real to Monsieur Lenoble. He assured his son that no Lenoble had ever been a  lawyer. They had been always lords of the soil, living on their own lands,  which had once stretched wide and far in that Norman province; a fact proved by  certain maps in M. Lenoble&rsquo;s possession, the paper whereof was worn and yellow  with age. They had stooped to no profession save that of arms. One seigneur of  Beaubocage had fought under Bayard himself; another had fallen at Pavia, on  that great day when all was lost <em>hormis  l&rsquo;honneur</em>; another had followed the white plume of the Bernais; another &mdash;  but was there any need to tell of the glories of that house upon which Gustave  was so eager to inflict the disgrace of a learned profession?</p>
<p>Thus argued the father; but the mother had spent  her girlhood amidst the clamour of the Buonapartist campaigns, and the thought  of war was very terrible to her. The memory of the retreat from Russia was not  yet twenty years old. There were men alive to tell the story, to depict those  days and nights of horror, that mighty march of death. It was she and her  daughter Cydalise who had helped to persuade Gustave that he was born to  distinguish himself in the law. They wanted him to study in Paris &mdash; the young  man himself had a wild desire to enjoy the delights of that wondrous capital &mdash;  and to return in a few years to set up for himself as <em>avocat</em> at the town of Vevinord, some half-dozen leagues from the  patrimonial estate. He was created to plead for the innocent, to denounce the  guilty, to be grand and brave and fiery-hot with enthusiasm in defence of  virtuous peasants charged unjustly with the stealing of sheep, or firing of  corn-ricks. It never struck these simple souls that he might sometimes be called  upon to defend the guilty, or to denounce the innocent.</p>
<p>It was all settled at last. Gustave was to go to  Paris, and enter himself as a student of law. There were plenty of  boarding-houses in the neighbourhood of the Ecole de Droit where a young man  might find a home; and to one of these Gustave was recommended by a friend of  his family. It was the Pension Magnotte to which they had sent him, the big  dreary house, <em>entre cour et jardin</em>,  which had once been so grand and noble. A printer now occupied the lower  chambers, and a hand painted on the wall pointed to the <em>Pension Magnotte, au premier. Tirez le cordon, s.v.p.</em></p>
<p>Gustave was twenty-one years of age when he came to  Paris; tall, stalwart, broad of shoulders and deep of chest, with a fair frank  face, an auburn moustache, candid, kind blue eyes &mdash; a physiognomy rather Saxon  than Celtic. He was a man who made friends quickly, and was soon at home among  the students, roaring their favourite songs, and dancing their favourite dances  at the dancing-places of that day, joining with a pleasant heartiness in all  their innocent dissipations. For guilty dissipation the young provincial had no  taste. Did he not carry the images of two kind and pure women about with him  wherever he went, like two attendant angels ever protecting his steps; and  could he leave them sorrowing on thresholds <em>they</em> could not pass? Ah, no! He was loud and boisterous and wild of spirits in those  early days, but incapable of meanness or vice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a brave heart,&rdquo; Madame Magnotte said of him,  &ldquo;though for the breaking of glasses a scourge &mdash; <em>un fl&eacute;au</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladies of the Pension Magnotte were for the  most part of mature age and unattractive appearance &mdash; two or three lonely  spinsters, eking out their pitiful little incomes as best they might, by the  surreptitious sale of delicate embroideries, confectioned in their dismal  leisure; and a fat elderly widow, popularly supposed to be enormously rich, but  of miserly propensities. &ldquo;It is the widow of Harpagon himself,&rdquo; Madame Magnotte  told her gossips &mdash; an old woman with two furiously ugly daughters, who for the  last fifteen years had lived a nomadic life in divers boarding-houses, fondly  clinging to the hope that, amongst so many strange bachelors, husbands for  these two solitary ones must at last be found.</p>
<p>These, with a pale young lady who gave music  lessons in the quarter, were all the feminine inmates of the mansion; and  amongst these Gustave Lenoble was chief favourite. His tender courtesy for  these lonely women seemed in some manner an evidence of that good old blood  whereof the young man&rsquo;s father boasted. Francis the First, who listened with  bent knee and bare head to his mother&rsquo;s discourse, was not more reverential to  that noble Savoyarde than was Gustave to the shabby-genteel maiden ladies of  the Pension Magnotte. In truth, this young man had a heart pitiful and tender  as the heart of woman. To be unfortunate was to possess a sure claim upon his  pity and regard; to be poor and friendless was the best appeal to his kindness.  He spent his evenings sometimes in the great dreary desert of a salon, and  listened respectfully while Mademoiselle Servin, the young music-teacher,  played dismal sonatas of Gluck or Gr&eacute;try on a cracked old piano that had been  one of the earliest made of those instruments, and was now attenuated and  feeble as the very ghost of music. He listened to Madame Magnotte&rsquo;s stories of  departed splendour. To him she opened her heart as she never had opened it to  those other young men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They mock themselves of everything &mdash; even the  religion!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with horror. &ldquo;They are Diderots and Holbachs in the  bud, less the talent. But you do not come of that gutter in which they were  born. You are of the old blood of France, M. Lenoble, and I can trust myself to  you as I cannot to them. I, who speak to you &mdash; I, too, come of a good old race,  and there is sympathy between we others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, after babbling to him of her lost  station, the lady would entertain him with some dainty little supper with which  she was wont to indulge herself and her lady boarders, when the students &mdash; who  were treated something after the manner of school-boys &mdash; were out of doors.</p>
<p>For four years the law-student had enjoyed his  Parisian life &mdash; not altogether idle, but not altogether industrious &mdash; amusing  himself a great deal, and learning very little; moderate in his expenditure,  when compared with his fellow-students, but no small drain upon the funds of  the little family at home. In sooth, this good old Norman family had in a  pecuniary sense sunk very low. There was real poverty in the tumble-down house  at Beaubocage, though it was poverty that wore a cheerful face, and took things  pleasantly. A very humble English farmer would have despised the income which  supported M. Lenoble&rsquo;s household; and it was only the economy and skill of the  matron and her daughter which sustained the dignity of the small establishment.</p>
<p>There was one great hope cherished alike by the  proud simple-minded old father, the fond mother, the devoted sister, and that  was the hope in the grand things to be done, in the dim future, by Gustave, the  son, the heir, the pole-star of the household.</p>
<p>Out of poverty, out of obscurity, into the broad  light of honour and riches, was the house of Lenoble to be lifted by this young  law-student. On the broad shoulders of this modern Atlas the Lenoble world was  to be sustained. To him they looked, of him they thought, in the long dreary  winter evenings during which the mother nodded over her knitting, the father  slept in his capacious easy-chair, the sister toiled at her needle-work by her  little table of <em>palissandre</em>.</p>
<p>He had paid them more than one visit during his two  years of study, bringing with him life and light and gladness, as it seemed to  the two women who adored him; and now, in the winter of 1828, they expected  another visit. He was to be with them on the first day of the new year. He was  to stay with them till his Mother&rsquo;s f&ecirc;te &mdash; the 17th of January.</p>
<p>The father looked to this special visit with an  unusual anxiety. The mother too was more than ever anxious. The sister, if she  who loved her brother with a somewhat morbid intensity could be more anxious  than usual, was more so now. A dreadful plot, a dire conspiracy, of which  Gustave was to be the subject and victim, had been concocted beneath that  innocent-seeming roof. Father, mother, and sister, seated round the family  hearth, fatal as some domestic Parc&aelig;, had hatched their horrid scheme, while  the helpless lad amused himself yonder in the great city, happily unconscious  of the web that was being woven to enmesh him.</p>
<p>The cord which monsieur unwound, the mesh which  madame held, the needle which dexterous mademoiselle wielded, were employed in  the fabrication of a matrimonial net. These unsophisticated conspirators were  bent upon bringing about the marriage of their victim, a marriage which should  at once elevate and enrich the Lenobles of Beaubocage, in the person of  Gustave.</p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Lenoble&rsquo;s best friend and nearest  neighbour was a certain Baron Frehlter, of Germanic origin, but for some  generations past naturalised to the Gallic soil. The Baron was proprietor of an  estate which could show ten acres for one of the lands of Beaubocage. The Baron  boasted a family tree which derived its root from a ramification of the  Hohenzollern pedigree; but, less proud and more prudent than the Lenobles, the  Frehlters had not scorned to intermingle their Prussian blue blood with less  pure streams of commercial France. The <em>&eacute;picier</em> element had prevailed in the fair brides of the house of Frehlter for the last  three or four generations, and the house of Frehlter had considerably enriched  itself by this sacrifice of its family pride.</p>
<p>The present Baron had married a lady ten years his  senior, the widow of a Rouen merchant, alike wealthy and pious, but famous  rather for these attributes than for any personal charm. One only child, a  girl, had blessed this union. She was now a young person of something under  twenty years of age, newly emerged from her convent, and pining for some share  in the gaieties and delights of a worldly paradise, which had already been open  to many of her schoolfellows.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Frehlter&rsquo;s companions had, for the  most part, left school to be married. She had heard of the <em>corbeille</em>, the wedding dress, the wedding festivities, and  occasionally a word or two about that secondary consideration the bridegroom.  The young lady was therefore somewhat inclined to take it ill of her father  that he had not secured for her the <em>&eacute;clat</em> of an early marriage. Her departure from the convent of the Sacr&eacute; Coeur, at  Vevinord, was flat and tame to an extreme degree. The future lay before her, a  dreary desert of home life, to be spent with a father who gorged himself daily  at a greasy and savoury banquet, and who slept away the greater part of his  existence; and with a mother who divided her affections between a disagreeable  poodle and a still more disagreeable priest &mdash; a priest who took upon himself to  lecture the demoiselle Frehlter on the smallest provocation.</p>
<p>The ch&acirc;teau of the Frehlters was a very grand abode  as compared to the tumble-down house of Beaubocage; but it was cold and stony  to a depressing degree, and the furniture must have been shabby in the days of  the Fronde. Faithful old servants kept the mansion in a state of spotless  purity, and ruled the Baron and his wife with a rod of iron. Mademoiselle  execrated these devoted retainers, and would have welcomed the sauciest of  modern domestics who would have released her from the bondage of these servants  of the old school.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle had been at home a year &mdash; a year of  discontent and ill-humour. She had quarrelled with her father, because he would  not take her to Paris; with her mother, because she would not give her more new  gowns and bonnets and feathers and fur-belows; with the priest, the poodle,  with the autocracy below-stairs, with everybody and everything. So at last the  Baron decided that mademoiselle should marry, whereby he might be rid of her,  and of her complaints, vagaries, ill-tempers, and general dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Having once made up his mind as to the wisdom of a  matrimonial arrangement, Baron Frehlter was not slow to fix upon a bridegroom.  He was a very rich man, and Madelon was his only child, and he was furthermore  a very lazy man; so, instead of looking far afield for a wealthy or  distinguished suitor for his daughter, he was inclined to take the first that  came to hand. It is possible that the Baron, who was of a somewhat cynical turn  of mind, may have cherished no very exalted idea of his daughter&rsquo;s attractions,  either personal or mental. However this might be, it is certain that when the  demoiselle had ill-treated the poodle, and insulted the priest, and quarrelled  with the cook &mdash; that high-priestess of the kitchen who alone, in all Normandy,  could concoct those messes which the Baron loved &mdash; the master of C&ocirc;tenoir decided  on marrying his heiress out of hand.</p>
<p>He communicated this design to his old crony,  Fran&ccedil;ois Lenoble, one day when the Beaubocage family dined at Ch&acirc;teau C&ocirc;tenoir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think of marrying my daughter,&rdquo; he said to his  friend, when the ladies were safely out of hearing at the other end of the long  dreary saloon. &ldquo;Now thy son Gustave is a fine fellow &mdash; brave, handsome, and of  a good race. It is true he is not as rich as Madelon will be by-and-by; but I  am no huckster, to sell my daughter to the best bidder&rdquo; (&ldquo;and I doubt if there  would be many bidders for her, if I were so inclined,&rdquo; thought the Baron, in  parenthesis); &ldquo;and if thy son should take a fancy to her, and she to him, it  would please me well enough, friend Fran&ccedil;ois.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friend Fran&ccedil;ois pricked up his ears, and in his old  eyes flickered a feeble light. C&ocirc;tenoir and Beaubocage united in the person of  his son Gustave! Lenoble of Beaubocage and C&ocirc;tenoir &mdash; Lenoble of C&ocirc;tenoir and  Beaubocage! So splendid a vision had never shone before his eyes in all the dreams  that he had dreamed about the only son of whom he was so proud. He could not  have shaped to himself so bold a project as the union of those two estates. And  here was the Baron offering it to him, with his snuff-box, <em>en passant</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a great marriage,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a very  great marriage. For Gustave I can answer without hesitation. He could not but  be charmed by such a union &mdash; so amiable a bride would enchant him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked down the room to the spot where Madelon  and Cydalise were standing, side by side, admiring Madame Frehlter&rsquo;s poodle.  Madelon could afford to be civil to the poodle before company. The contrast  between the two girls was sufficiently striking. Cydalise was fair and  bright-looking &mdash; Mademoiselle Frehlter was square and ungainly of figure,  swarthy of complexion, dark of brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could not but be charmed,&rdquo; repeated the old  man, with feeble gallantry.</p>
<p>He was thinking of the joining together of  Beaubocage and C&ocirc;tenoir; and it seemed a very small thing to him that such a  union of estates would involve the joining of a man and woman, who were to hold  to each other and love each other until death should part them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be no marriage of convenience,&rdquo; said the  Baron, in a generous spirit; &ldquo;my daughter is somewhat ill-tem &mdash; that is to say,  my daughter finds her life somewhat dull with her old father and mother, and I  think she might be happier in the society of a husband. I like your son; and my  wife, too, likes him better than any other young man of our acquaintance.  Madelon has seen a good deal of him when she has been home from the convent in  her holidays, and I have reason to think she does not dislike him. If he likes  her and she likes him, and the idea is pleasing to you and madame, we will make  a match of it. If not, let it pass; we will say no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the seigneur of Beaubocage assured his friend  that Gustave would be enchanted with the proposal; and again it was of C&ocirc;tenoir  that he thought, and not of the heart or the inclinations of his son.</p>
<p>This conversation took place late in autumn, and at  the new year Gustave was to come. Nothing was to be said to him about his  intended wife until he arrived; that was a point upon which the Baron insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young man may have fallen in love with some  fine young person in
  Paris,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and in that case we will say nothing to him of Madelon. But if we find him with the heart free, and inclined to take to my daughter, we may give him encouragement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was solemnly agreed between the two fathers.  Nor was Mademoiselle Frehlter to be told of the matrimonial scheme until it  ripened. But after this dinner at C&ocirc;tenoir the household at Beaubocage talked  of little else than of the union of the two families. What grandeur, what  wealth, what happiness! Gustave the lord of C&ocirc;tenoir! Poor Cydalise had never  seen a finer mansion than the old ch&acirc;teau, with its sugar-loaf towers and stone  terraces, and winding stairs, and tiny inconvenient turret chambers, and long  dreary salon and <em>salle-&agrave;-manger</em>. She  could picture to herself nothing more splendid. For Gustave to be offered the  future possession of C&ocirc;tenoir was as if he were suddenly to be offered the  succession to a kingdom. She could not bring herself to consider that Madelon  was neither agreeable nor attractive, and that, after all, the wife must count  for something in every marriage contract. She could see nothing, she could  think of nothing, but C&ocirc;tenoir. The glory and grandeur of that estate absorbed  every other consideration.</p>
<p>No one of those three conspirators feared any  opposition on the part of their victim. It was just possible that Gustave might  have fallen in love with some Parisian damsel, though his letters gave no hint  of any such calamity. But if such a misfortune had happened, he would, of  course, fall out of love again, return the damsel her troth and obtain the  return of his own, and straightway offer the second-hand commodity to  Mademoiselle Frehlter.</p>
<p>The object of all these cares and hopes and dreams  arrived at last, full of life and spirits, with plenty to tell about Paris in  general, and very little to tell about himself in particular. The women  questioned him unmercifully. They insisted on a graphic description of every  female inmate of the boarding-house, and would scarcely believe that all except  the little music-mistress were elderly and unattractive. Of the music-mistress  herself they were inclined to be very suspicious, and were not altogether  reassured by Gustave&rsquo;s assertion that she was neither pretty nor fascinating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a dear, good, industrious little thing,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;and works harder than I do. But she is no miracle of beauty; and her  life is so dreary that I often wonder she does not go into a convent. It would  be gayer and pleasanter for her than to live with those old women at the  Pension Magnotte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there are many beautiful women in  Paris?&rdquo; said Cydalise, bent upon knowing the worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I dare say there are,&rdquo; Gustave answered  frankly; &ldquo;but we students don&rsquo;t see much of them in our quarter. One sees a  pretty little milliner&rsquo;s girl now and then, or a washerwoman. In short, there  are a good many grisettes in our part of the world,&rdquo; added the young man,  blushing, but for no sin of his own. &ldquo;We get a glimpse of a handsome woman  sometimes, rattling past in her carriage; but in Paris handsome women do not go  on foot. I have seen prettier girls at Vevinord than in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cydalise was enchanted with this confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;our Normandy is the place  for pretty girls.
  Madelon Frehlter, for example, is not she a very &mdash; amiable girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say she&rsquo;s amiable enough,&rdquo; answered  Gustave; &ldquo;but if there were no prettier girls than Mademoiselle Frehlter in  this part of the world, we should have no cause to boast. But there are  prettier girls, Cydalise, and thou art thyself one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this speech the young man bestowed upon his  sister a resounding kiss. Yes; it was clear that he was heart-whole. These  noisy, boisterous good spirits were not characteristic of a lover. Even  innocent Cydalise knew that to be in love was to be miserable.</p>
<p>From this time mother and sister tormented their  victim with the merits and charms of his predestined bride. Madelon on the  piano was miraculous; Madelon&rsquo;s little songs were enchanting; Madelon&rsquo;s  worsted-work was a thing to worship; Madelon&rsquo;s devotion to her mother and her  mother&rsquo;s poodle was unequalled; Madelon&rsquo;s respectful bearing to the good Abb&eacute;  St. Velours &mdash; her mother&rsquo;s director &mdash; was positively beyond all praise. It was  virtue seraphic, supernal. Such a girl was too good for earth &mdash; too good for  anything except Gustave.</p>
<p>The young man heard and wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you rave about Madelon Frehlter!&rdquo; he  exclaimed. &ldquo;She seems to me the most commonplace young person I ever  encountered. She has nothing to say for herself; she never appears to know  where to put her elbows. I never saw such elbows; they are everywhere at once.  And her shoulders! &mdash; O heaven, then, her shoulders! &mdash; it ought to be forbidden  to wear low dresses when one has such shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was discouraging, but the schemers bore up  even against this. The mother dwelt on the intellectual virtues of Madelon; and  what were shoulders compared to mind, piety, amiability &mdash; all the Christian  graces? Cydalise owned that dear Madelon was somewhat <em>gauche</em>; Gustave called her <em>b&ecirc;te</em>.  The father remonstrated with his son. Was it not frightful to use a word of the  barracks in connection with this charming young lady?</p>
<p>At last the plot revealed itself. After a dinner at  C&ocirc;tenoir and a dinner at Beaubocage, on both which occasions Gustave had made  himself very agreeable to the ladies of the Baron&rsquo;s household &mdash; since, indeed,  it was not in his nature to be otherwise than kind and courteous to the weaker  sex &mdash; the mother told her son of the splendid destiny that had been shaped for  him. It was a matter of surprise and grief to her to find that the revelation  gave Gustave no pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage was the last thing in my thoughts, dear  mother,&rdquo; he said, gravely; &ldquo;and Madelon Frehlter is the very last woman I  should think of for a wife. Nevertheless, I am gratified by the honour Monsieur  le Baron has done me. That goes without saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the two estates! &mdash; together they would make  you a great proprietor. You would not surely refuse such fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cydalise gave a little scream of horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C&ocirc;tenoir! to refuse C&ocirc;tenoir! Ah, surely that would  be impossible! But figure to yourself, then, Gustave&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Cydalise, you forget the young lady goes with  the ch&acirc;teau; a fixture that we cannot dispense with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she, so amiable, so pious&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So plain, so stupid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So modest, so charitable&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, so admirably adapted for a Sister of  Charity,&rdquo; replied Gustave. &ldquo;But no, dear Cydalise. C&ocirc;tenoir is a grand old  place; but I would as soon spend my life at Toulon, dragging a cannon-ball at  my heels, as in that dreary salon where Madame Frehlter nurses her maladies and  her poodle, and where the good-humoured, easy-going old Baron snores away  existence. &rsquo;Tis very well for those elderly folks, you see, my sister, and for  Madelon &mdash; for hers is an elderly mind in a youthful body; but for a young man  full of hope and gaiety and activity &mdash; bah! It would be of all living deaths  the worst. From the galleys there is always the hope of escaping &mdash; an  underground passage, burrowed out with one&rsquo;s finger-nails in the dead of the  night &mdash; a work lasting twenty years or so, but with a feeble star of hope  always glimmering at the end of the passage. But from the salon, and mamma, and  the poodle, and the good, unctuous, lazy old director, and papa&rsquo;s apoplectic  snoring, and the plaintive little songs and monotonous embroideries of one&rsquo;s  wife, there would be no escape. Ah, bah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave shuddered, and the two women shuddered as  they heard him. The prospect was by no means promising; but Madame Lenoble and  her daughter did not utterly despair. Gustave&rsquo;s heart was disengaged. That was  a great point; and for the rest, surely persuasion might do much.</p>
<p>Then came that phenomenon seen very often in this  life &mdash; a generous-minded, right-thinking young man talked into a position which  of all others is averse from his own inclinations. The mother persuaded, the  sister pleaded, the father dwelt dismally upon the poverty of Beaubocage, the  wealth of C&ocirc;tenoir. It was the story of auld Robin Gray reversed. Gustave  perceived that his refusal to avail himself of this splendid destiny would be a  bitter and lasting grief to these people who loved him so fondly &mdash; whom he  loved as fondly in return. Must he not be a churl to disappoint hopes so  unselfish, to balk an ambition so innocent? And only because Madelon was not  the most attractive or the prettiest of women!</p>
<p>The young man stood firm against all their  arguments, he was unmoved by all their pleading. It was only when his anxious  kindred had given up the battle for lost that Gustave wavered. Their mute  despair moved him more than the most persuasive eloquence; and the end was  submission. He left Beaubocage the plighted lover of that woman who, of all  others, he would have been the last to choose for his wife. It had all been  settled very pleasantly &mdash; the dowry, the union of the two estates, the two names.  For six months Gustave was to enjoy his freedom to finish his studies; and then  he was to return to Normandy for his marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard very good accounts of you from  Paris,&rdquo; said the Baron. &ldquo;You are not like some young men, wild, mad-brained. One  can confide in your honour, your steadiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good folks of Beaubocage were in ecstacies.  They congratulated Gustave &mdash; they congratulated each other. A match so  brilliant would be the redemption of the family. The young man at last began to  fancy himself the favoured of the gods. What if Madelon seemed a little dull &mdash;  a little wanting in that vivacity which is so pleasing to frivolous minds? she  was doubtless so much the more profound, so much the more virtuous. If she was  not bright and varied and beautiful as some limpid fountain dancing in summer  sunlight, she was perhaps changeless and steady as a rock; and who would not  rather have the security of a rock than the summer-day beauty of a fountain?</p>
<p>Before Gustave departed from his paternal home he had  persuaded himself that he was a very lucky fellow; and he had paid Mademoiselle  Frehlter some pretty little stereotyped compliments, and had listened with  sublime patience to her pretty little stereotyped songs. He left the young lady  profoundly impressed by his merits; he left his own household supremely happy;  and he carried away with him a heart in which Madelon Frehlter&rsquo;s image had no  place.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  In This Wide World I Stand Alone</h2>
<p>Gustave went back to his old life, and was not much  disturbed by the grandeur of his destiny as future seigneur of C&ocirc;tenoir and  Beaubocage. It sometimes occurred to him that he had a weight upon his mind;  and, on consideration, he found that the weight was Madelon Frehlter. But he  continued to carry that burden very lightly, and his easy-going student life  went on, unbroken by thoughts of the future. He sent polite messages to the  demoiselle Frehlter in his letters to Cydalise; and he received from Cydalise  much information, more graphic than interesting, upon the subject of the family  at C&ocirc;tenoir; and so his days went on with pleasant monotony. This was the brief  summer of his youth; but, alas, how near at hand was the dark and dismal winter  that was to freeze this honest joyous heart! That heart, so compassionate for  all suffering, so especially tender for all womankind, was to be attacked upon  its weaker side.</p>
<p>It was Gustave Lenoble&rsquo;s habit to cross the gardens  of the Luxembourg every morning, on his way from the Rue Grande-Mademoiselle to  the Ecole de Droit. Sometimes, when he was earlier than usual, he carried a  book with him, and paced one of the more obscure alleys, reading for an odd  half-hour before he went to the daily mill-grinding in the big building beyond  those quiet gardens.</p>
<p>Walking with his book one morning &mdash; it was a volume  of Boileau, which the student knew by heart, and the pages whereof did not  altogether absorb his attention &mdash; he passed and repassed a bench on which a  lady sat, pensive and solitary, tracing shapeless figures on the ground with  the point of her parasol. He glanced at her somewhat carelessly the first time  of passing, more curiously on the second occasion, and the third time with  considerable attention. Something in her attitude &mdash; helplessness, hopelessness,  nay indeed, despair itself, all expressed in the drooping head, the listless  hand tracing those idle characters on the gravel &mdash; enlisted the sympathies of  Gustave Lenoble. He had pitied her even before his gaze had penetrated the  cavernous depths of the capacious bonnet of those days; but one glimpse of the  pale plaintive face inspired him with compassion unspeakable. Never had he seen  despair more painfully depicted on the human countenance &mdash; a despair that  sought no sympathy, a sorrow that separated the sufferer from the outer world.  Never had he seen a face so beautiful, even in despair. He could have fancied  it the face of Andromache, when all that made her world had been reft from her;  or of Antigone, when the dread fiat had gone forth &mdash; that funeral rites or  sepulture for the last accursed scion of an accursed race there were to be  none.</p>
<p>He put Boileau into his pocket. That glimpse of a  suffering human mind, which had been unconsciously revealed to him, possessed  an interest more absorbing than the grandest flight of poet and satirist. As he  passed for the fifth time, he looked at the mournful lady still more  searchingly, and this time the sad eyes were lifted, and met his pitying looks.  The beautiful lips moved, and murmured something in tones so tremulous as to be  quite unintelligible.</p>
<p>The student took off his hat, and approached the  lady, deferential as knight-errant of old awaiting the behest of his liege  mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what can I have the happiness to be agreeable  to you, madame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good, monsieur,&rdquo; murmured the lady in  very decent French, but with an accent unmistakably foreign &mdash; English, as  Gustave opined. &ldquo;I &mdash; I &mdash; am quite a stranger in Paris, and &mdash; and &mdash; I have heard  there are numerous lodging-houses in this quarter &mdash; where one may obtain a  lodging &mdash; cheaply. I have asked several nursemaids, and other women, in the  gardens this morning; but they seem very stupid, and can tell me nothing; and I  do not care to ask at the hotel where I am staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave pondered. Yes, there were many lodgings, he  informed the lady. And then he thought of Madame Magnotte. Was it not his duty  to secure this stray lodger for that worthy woman, if possible?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If madame has no objection to a boarding-house&mdash;&rdquo;  he began.</p>
<p>Madame shook her head. &ldquo;A boarding-house would suit  me just as well,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but it must not be expensive. I cannot afford to  pay much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of a boarding-house very near this place,  where madame might find a comfortable home on very reasonable terms. It is, in  point of fact, the house in which I myself reside,&rdquo; added Gustave, with some  timidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will kindly direct me to the house&mdash;&rdquo; said  the lady, looking straight before her with sad unseeing eyes, and evidently  supremely indifferent as to the residence or non-residence of M. Lenoble in the  habitation referred to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, madame, if you will permit me to conduct you  there. It is but a walk of five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger accepted the courtesy with a gentle  indifference that was not ingratitude, but rather incapacity for any feeling  except that one great sorrow which seemed to absorb her mind.</p>
<p>Gustave wondered what calamity could thus overwhelm  one so young and beautiful.</p>
<p>The lady was quite silent during the little walk  from the gardens to the Rue Grande-Mademoiselle, and Gustave observed her  attentively as he walked by her side. She was evidently not more than  four-and-twenty years of age, and she was certainly the prettiest woman he had  ever seen. It was a fair delicate English beauty, a little worn and faded, as  if by care, but idealized and sublimated in the process. At her brightest this  stranger must have been strikingly beautiful; in her sorrow she was touchingly  lovely. It was what Gustave&rsquo;s countrymen call a <em>beaut&eacute; navrante</em>.</p>
<p>Gustave watched her, and wondered about her. The  dress she wore was sufficiently elegant, but had lost the gloss of newness. Her  shawl, which she carried as gracefully as a Frenchwoman, was darned. Gustave  perceived the neat careful stitches, and divined the poverty of the wearer.  That she should be poor was no subject for surprise; but that she, so  sorrowful, so lonely, should seek a home in a strange city, was an enigma not  easy to solve.</p>
<p>To Madame Magnotte Gustave introduced the stranger.  She gave just one look round the dreary saloon; but to Gustave&rsquo;s fancy that one  look seemed eloquent. &ldquo;Ah me!&rdquo; it said; &ldquo;is this the fairest home I am to find  upon this inhospitable earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not seem to belong to this world,&rdquo; the  young man thought, as he went back to the garden where he had found his fair  stranger, having been very coolly dismissed by Madame Magnotte after his  introduction had been made.</p>
<p>And then M. Lenoble, being of a romantic turn of  mind, remembered how a lady had been found by a student sitting on the lowest  steps of the guillotine, desolate and helpless, at night; and how the student  had taken her home and sheltered her, and had straightway fallen desperately in  love with her, to discover, with unutterable horror, that her head had been  severed from her fair shoulders by the cruel knife twelve hours before, and  that her melancholy loveliness was altogether phantasmal and delusive.</p>
<p>Was this English stranger whom Gustave had found in  the gardens of the Luxembourg twin sister to that ghostly lady of the familiar  legend? Her despair and her beauty seemed to him greater than earthly sorrow or  earthly beauty; and he was half inclined to wonder whether she could be of the  same race as Madelon Frehlter. And from this hour the sense of a weight upon  his mind, before so vague and intermittent, became an enduring oppression, not  to be shaken off by any effort of his will.</p>
<p>All through that day he found himself thinking more  of the unknown
  Englishwoman than was consistent with a strict performance of his duties.
  He was vexed with himself on account of this foolish distraction of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a frivolous fellow I must be,&rdquo; he said to  himself, &ldquo;to dwell upon such a trifle! This comes of leading such a monotonous  life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At dinner he looked for the lady; but she did not  appear at the long table, where the shrill old ladies, the epicurean old  bachelors, the noisy students, daily devoured and grumbled at the four or five  courses which old Nanon developed out of her inner consciousness and a rather  scantily furnished larder. He questioned Madame Magnotte after dinner, and was  told that the lady was in the house, but was too tired to dine with the other  inmates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to thank thee for a new boarder, my  friend,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Madame Meynell will not pay largely; but she seems a quiet  and respectable person, and we shall doubtless be well pleased with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Meynell!&rdquo; repeated Gustave, congratulating  himself on finding that the Englishwoman was an inhabitant of the house he  lived in. &ldquo;She is a widow, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is a widow. I asked that question, and  she answered, yes. But she told me nothing of her late husband. She is not at  all communicative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all Gustave could obtain from Madame  Magnotte. She was not communicative. No; she was, indeed, scarcely less silent  than that ghostly lady who had been found sitting at the foot of the guillotine.  There was some kind of mystery involved in her sorrowful face, her silent  apathy. It was possibly the fact of this mystery which interested M. Lenoble.  Certain it is that the young man&rsquo;s interest had been aroused by this unknown  Englishwoman, and that his mind was more occupied by the image of her whom he  had seen but once than by that of his plighted wife.</p>
<p>He waited anxiously for the next day; but on the  next day Madame Meynell still pleaded fatigue and illness. It was only on the  third day that she appeared at the noisy banquet, pale, silent, absent-minded,  sheltering herself under the wing of Madame Magnotte, who was disposed to be  kind to this helpless stranger. To Gustave the young English widow seemed like  a ghost at that crowded board. He looked at her every now and then from his  distant seat, and saw her always with the same hopeless far-away look in her  sad eyes. He himself was silent and <em>distrait</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what dost thou dream, my droll one?&rdquo; said his  nearest neighbour.&ldquo;Thou art positively insupportable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Lenoble could not become vivacious or  entertaining at the behest of his fellow-student. The consciousness of that  strange pale face haunted and oppressed him. He hoped to have a few minutes&rsquo;  talk with the English lady after dinner, but she disappeared before the removal  of those recondite preparations which in the Pension Magnotte went by the  generic name of &ldquo;dessert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For more than a week she appeared thus at the  dinner-table, eating very little, speaking not at all, except such monosyllabic  replies as the hostess now and then extorted from her pale lips. A creature at  once so beautiful and so profoundly sad became an object of interest to others  besides Gustave; but in no breast was the sympathy which her sadness and beauty  excited so poignant as in his. Her face haunted him. The familiar pleasures and  amusements became distasteful to him. He spent his evenings at home in the  dismal salon, and was content to listen to the chatter of the old women, the  little music-mistress&rsquo;s dreary sonatas, the monotonous roll of wheels on the  distant quay &mdash; anything rather than the hackneyed round of student-life that  had once been agreeable to him. He did not fail to write his weekly letter to  Cydalise; but, for some reason or other, he refrained from any allusion to the  English stranger, although it was his custom to relate all his adventures for  the amusement of the family at Beaubocage.</p>
<p>An evening came at last on which Madame Meynell was  persuaded to remain with the other ladies after dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be very cold and cheerless for you in your  bedroom,&rdquo; said Madame Magnotte; &ldquo;why not spend your evening with us, in a  pleasant and social manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good, madame,&rdquo; murmured the  Englishwoman, in the slow timid accents that had so plaintive a sound to  Gustave&rsquo;s ear; &ldquo;if you wish it, I will stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to submit rather from utter weakness and  inability to refuse anything asked of her than from any hope of finding  pleasure in the society of the Magnotte salon.</p>
<p>It was an evening in March &mdash; cold, blustrous,  dreary. The east wind blew clouds of dust athwart the Rue Grande-Mademoiselle,  and the few foot-passengers in that dull thoroughfare looked pinched and  wretched. The old ladies gathered round the great black stove, and gossipped in  the twilight; the music-mistress went to her feeble piano, and played, unasked,  unheeded; for Gustave, who was wont to turn the leaves, or sit attentive by the  piano, seemed this evening unconscious of the music. Madame Meynell sat in one  of the windows, alone, half-hidden by the faded yellow damask curtains, looking  out into the street.</p>
<p>Something &mdash; some impulse which he tried to resist,  but could not &mdash; drew Gustave towards that lonely figure by the window. He went  close up to the strange lady. This evening, as in the gardens of the  Luxembourg, she seemed to him a living statue of despair. Now, as then, he felt  an interest in her sorrow which he was powerless to combat. He had a vague idea  that even this compassionate sympathy was in some manner an offence against  Madelon Frehlter, the woman to whom he belonged, and yet he yielded to the  fatal weakness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I belong to her,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;I  belong to Madelon Frehlter. She is neither pretty nor fascinating; but I have  every reason to believe her very good, very amiable; and she is the only woman,  except those of my own kindred, in whom I have any right to be interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not say this in so many words; but this was  the shape which his thoughts assumed as he yielded to the tempter, and walked  straight to the distant window by which Madame Meynell had seated herself.</p>
<p>She started slightly as he approached her, and then  looked up and recognized him as her acquaintance of the Luxembourg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, monsieur,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I have to  thank you for having helped me to find a comfortable home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this in a low gentle voice, she looked  out into the street once more with her mournful unseeing eyes. It was evident  that she had no more to say to M. Lenoble.</p>
<p>The student, however, had no idea of leaving the  window just yet, although he knew &mdash; yes, knew &mdash; that his presence there was a  wrong done to Madelon Frehlter; but a wrong so small, so infinitesimal, that it  was really not worth consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am enchanted to think that I was of some slight  service to you, madame,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I fear you will find this quarter of  Paris very dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not take any notice of this remark until  Gustave had repeated it, and then she spoke as if suddenly awakened from a  trance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dull?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No, I have not found it dull. I  do not care for gaiety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this M. Lenoble felt that he could say no  more. The lady relapsed into her waking trance. The dust-clouds in the silent  street seemed more interesting to her than M. Lenoble of Beaubocage. He  lingered a few minutes in the neighbourhood of her chair, thoughtfully  observant of the delicate profile, the pale clear tints of a complexion that  had lost its bloom but not its purity, the settled sadness of the perfect  mouth, the dreamy pensiveness of the dark-grey eye, and then was fain to  retire.</p>
<p>After this, the English widow lady spent many  evenings in Madame Magnotte&rsquo;s salon. The old Frenchwoman gossipped and wondered  about her; but the most speculative could fashion no story from a page so blank  as this joyless existence. Even slander could scarcely assail a creature so  unobtrusive as the English boarder. The elderly ladies shrugged their shoulders  and pursed up their lips with solemn significance. There must needs be  something &mdash; a secret, a mystery, sorrow, or wrong-doing &mdash; somewhere; but of  Madame Meynell herself no one could suspect any harm.</p>
<p>Gustave Lenoble heard little of this gossip about  the stranger, but she filled his thoughts nevertheless. The vision of her face  came between him and his work; and when he thought of the future, and of the  damsel who had been allotted to him for a wife, his thoughts were very bitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fate is like Laban,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;a man  works and does his duty for seven years, and then Fate gives him Leah instead  of Rachel. No doubt Leah is a very good young woman; one has no complaint to  make against her, except that she is not Rachel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not a hopeful manner of looking at things  for the destined master of C&ocirc;tenoir. M. Lenoble&rsquo;s letters to the anxious folks  at Beaubocage became, about this time, somewhat brief and unsatisfactory. He no  longer gave ample details of his student-life &mdash; he no longer wrote in his  accustomed good spirits. His letters seemed stiff and constrained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid he is studying too much,&rdquo; said the  mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay the rascal is wasting his time in  dissipation,&rdquo; suggested the father.</p>

  &ldquo;Past Hope, And In Despair&rdquo; </h2>
<p>Two months had elapsed since the bleak spring  morning on which Gustave Lenoble found the solitary lady under the leafless  trees of the Luxembourg gardens. The inmates of the Pension Magnotte had grown  accustomed to her presence, to her silence, her settled sadness, and troubled  themselves no further respecting herself or her antecedents. The lapse of time  had brought no improvement to her spirits; indeed, Gustave, who watched her  closely, perceived that she had grown paler and thinner since that March  morning when he met her in the public garden. Her life must have been painfully  monotonous. She very rarely went out of doors, and on no occasion ventured  beyond the gardens of the Luxembourg. No one visited her. She neither wrote nor  received any letters. She was wont to make a pretence of reading as she sat in  her retired corner of the salon; but Gustave had discovered that she gave  little attention to her book. The open volume in her hand seemed no more than  an excuse for brooding upon her sorrows.</p>
<p>If people, prompted by curiosity or by compassion,  endeavoured to get into conversation with this lonely lady, the result was  always the same. She would answer their questions in a low gentle voice, with a  quiet politeness; but she never assisted them in the smallest degree to  interchange thoughts with her. It seemed as if she sought neither friend nor  sympathizer, or as if her case was so entirely hopeless as to admit of neither.  She paid for her board and lodging weekly with a punctilious exactness, though  weekly payments were not the rule of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My movements are uncertain,&rdquo; she said to Madame  Magnotte. &ldquo;I cannot tell how long I may be with you. It will therefore be  better for me to pay you weekly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had been in the house two months, dining every  day at the public table, spending all her evenings in the public saloon; and  during that time her settled gloom had never been broken by any outburst of  grief or passion. She might have been a creature of ice, a statue of despair  modelled in snow by a Michael Angelo. But one night the ice melted, the statue  of snow became in a moment a passionate, grief-stricken woman.</p>
<p>It was one bright evening late in May. Ah, how near  at hand was the appointed date of those nuptials to which the household of  Beaubocage looked forward with supreme happiness! The old ladies of the Pension  Magnotte were for the most part out of doors. The long saloon was almost empty.  There were only Gustave, Madame Magnotte, and the little music-mistress, who  sat at her piano, with the western sunlight shining full upon her, rosy-hued  and glorious, surrounding her with its soft radiance until she looked like a  humble St. Cecilia.</p>
<p>Madame Meynell had seated herself close to the  piano, and was listening to the music. Gustave hovered near, pretending to be  occupied with a limp little sheet of news published that evening.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Servin, the teacher of music, upon  this occasion deserted her favourite masters. She seemed in a somewhat dreamy  and sentimental humour, and played tender little melodies and simple plaintive  airs, that were more agreeable to Gustave than those grand examples of the  mathematics of counter-point which she so loved to interpret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like this melody of Gr&eacute;try&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the  music-mistress, as M. Lenoble seated himself close to the piano. &ldquo;I do not  think you care for classic sonatas &mdash; the great works of Gluck, or Bach, or  Beethoven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the young man frankly; &ldquo;I do not care  about anything I can&rsquo;t understand. I like music that goes to one&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, too, Madame Meynell, like simple  melodies?&rdquo; mademoiselle asked of that lady, who was not wont to come so near  the little piano, or to pay so much attention to Mademoiselle Servin&rsquo;s  performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; murmured the Englishwoman, &ldquo;I like such  music as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, too, think that Beethoven never composed  simple plaintive airs &mdash; for example,&rdquo; exclaimed the pianist, playing softly  while she spoke. &ldquo;You think he wrote only sonatas, quartettes, fugues, grand  operas, like <em>Fidelio</em>. Have you never  heard this by your scientific Beethoven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hereupon she played &ldquo;Hope told a flattering tale,&rdquo;  with much tenderness and delicacy. Her two hearers listened, mute and deeply  moved. And then from that familiar melody she glided softly into another, most  musical, most melancholy, which has been set to some of the sweetest verses  that Thomas Moore ever composed:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Those evening bells, those evening bells!<br>
  How many a tale their music tells<br>
  Of youth and home, and that sweet time<br>
When last I heard their soothing chime!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the world sang the verses of Ireland&rsquo;s divine  bard in those days. The song was one which the Englishwoman had sung years ago  in a happy home. What recollections, what associations, were evoked by that  plaintive melody, who shall say? The words came back with the music to which  they have been eternally wedded. The words, their mournful meaning, the faces  of the friends amongst whom she had last sung them, the picture of the peaceful  home whose walls had echoed the music, &mdash; all these things arose before her in a  vision too painfully vivid; and the lonely boarder at the Pension Magnotte  covered her face with her hands, and sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>The passion of tears lasted but a minute. Madame  Meynell dried her eyes, and rose to leave the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not question me,&rdquo; she said, perceiving that her  two companions were about to offer her their sympathy. &ldquo;I cannot tell you the  memories that were conjured up by that music. It brought back a home I shall  never see again, and the faces of the dead &mdash; worse than dead to me &mdash; and the  happiness I have lost, and the hopes and dreams that once were mine. Oh, I pray  God I may never hear that melody again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a passion, a depth of feeling, in her  tone quite new to Gustave Lenoble. He opened the door for her without a word,  and she passed out of the salon quietly, like a ghost &mdash; the ghost of that  bright young creature who had once borne her shape, and been called by her  name, in a pleasant farmhouse among the Yorkshire wolds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but how that poor soul must have suffered!&rdquo;  cried the sympathetic Mademoiselle Servin, as the door closed on the  Englishwoman. &ldquo;I did not think it was in her to feel so deeply. I thought she  was stone, and now I begin to think it must be of such stone as Niobe &mdash; the  petrification of despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon Gustave Lenoble this scene made a profound  impression. He lay awake during the greater part of that night, thinking of the  lonely lady&rsquo;s tears and anguish. The music of &ldquo;Those evening bells&rdquo; pervaded  his dreams. He rose unrefreshed, feverish, forgetful of C&ocirc;tenoir and Madelon  Frehlter, as if that place and that person had never emerged from the shapeless  substances of chaos. He wanted to see <em>her</em> again, to console her, if that were possible. Oh, that it might be his  privilege to console her! He pitied her with a compassion so intense, that thus  to compassionate her woes, was himself to suffer a poignant anguish. He pitied  her. Yes, he told himself again and again that this sentiment which so absorbed  his heart and mind was no more than pity. But oh, if this were pity, what were  love? That was a question which also presented itself to the mind of M. Gustave  Lenoble, of Beaubocage <em>in esse</em>, and  C&ocirc;tenoir <em>in posse</em>.</p>
<p>Madame Meynell rarely appeared at the common  breakfast in the grim dining-room of the Pension Magnotte. Gustave was  therefore in nowise surprised to miss her on this particular morning. He took a  cup of coffee, and hurried off to his daily duties. There was a fever on him which  he could neither understand nor shake off, and he hastened to the gardens of  the Luxembourg, as if there were some special necessity for speed. So do men  often hasten unconsciously to their predestined doom, defiant of augury.  Soothsayers may menace, and wives may dream dreams; but when his hour comes,  C&aelig;sar will go to the appointed spot where the daggers of his assassins await  him.</p>
<p>In the alley where he had first looked upon her sad  face, beneath the umbrage of young limes and chestnuts just bursting into  bloom, he saw the Englishwoman to-day, seated on the same bench, almost in the  same attitude.</p>
<p>He went up to her, and bade her good morning; and  then, intensely conscious of his own temerity, seated himself by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not expect to find you here so early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I seldom come out so soon; but this morning I  have to make some inquiries upon a matter of business, and I am only resting  here before going to make them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a little weary sigh at the end of this  speech. It seemed a strange manner of transacting business to rest in the  Luxembourg gardens, which were distant but a few hundred yards from her home.  Gustave divined that it was for very forlornness she lingered there, shrinking  from some difficult encounter that lay before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I not make the inquiries for you?&rdquo; he asked.  &ldquo;Pray command me. It will be my happiness to be useful to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good. I cannot trouble you so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray do not talk of trouble. It can be no trouble  to me to aid you in any manner. Ah, madame, you do not know how much I would  sacrifice to be useful to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She must have been dull indeed had she failed to  perceive the earnestness of his tone. She did perceive it, and was vaguely  conscious that in this student of law she had a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know when the diligence for Calais  leaves Paris, and from what office,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am going back to England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was surprised to see the young man&rsquo;s face  blanch as she announced this simple fact. The young man himself was surprised  by the sudden anguish inflicted by her announcement. It was in this moment that  he first discovered how completely he had given his heart into this strange  woman&rsquo;s keeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are really going to leave Paris? &mdash; for ever?&rdquo;  he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have been here too long already. I have no  business here. I ought to have gone back to England that day when I first met  you here, but I put off the day of my return. I can put it off no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are going back to your friends?&rdquo; Gustave  asked, in a very mournful tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going back to my friends? Yes!&rdquo; Her lips  quivered a little, and the unbidden tears came to her eyes.</p>
<p>Ah, what was the sorrow that oppressed this  beauteous lonely creature? What agony of grief or self-reproach was this pain  which consumed her? Gustave remembered her passion of tears on the previous  night; her talk of friends that were dead, and happiness lost; and now to-day  she talked of going home to her friends: but O the bitterness of expression  with which she had spoken that word &ldquo;friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going alone, Madame Meynell?&rdquo; he inquired,  after a pause. He could not tear himself from that seat by her side. He could  not be manly or rational where she was concerned. The image of Madelon Frehlter  rose before his mental vision, reproachful, menacing; but a thick fog  intervened to obscure that unwelcome image. His whole life resolved itself into  those thrilling moments in which he sat here, on this common garden bench, by  this stranger&rsquo;s side; the entire universe was contracted into this leafy walk  where they two sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am going alone,&rdquo; madame replied, with a  little laugh. &ldquo;Who should I have to go with me? I am quite alone in the world.  I think I had better make these inquiries myself, M. Lenoble. There is no  reason why I should give you so much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no such thing as trouble. I will bring  you all necessary information to-day at dinner, if that will be soon enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite soon enough, I thank you, monsieur,&rdquo; she  answered, with a sigh. &ldquo;I must ask you kindly to ascertain for me also the  expense of the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly, madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This request set him wondering whether she were  poor, and how poor. But she had evidently no more to say to him; she had again  become impenetrable. He would fain have stayed, though honour and conscience  were clamorous in their demands for his departure. Happily for honour and  conscience, the lady was silent as death, impervious as marble; so M. Lenoble  presently bowed and departed.</p>
<p>He thought of her all day long. The farce of pity  was ended. He knew now that he loved this Englishwoman with an affection at  once foolish and sinful, &mdash; foolish, since he knew not who or what this woman  was; sinful, since the indulgence of this passion involved the forfeiture of  his plighted word, the disappointment of those who loved him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;I cannot do this  base and wicked thing. I must marry Madelon. All the hopes of my mother and  father rest on that marriage; and to disappoint them because this stranger&rsquo;s  face has bewitched me? Ah, no, it cannot be. And even if I were willing to  trample my honour in the dust, how do I know that she would value or accept the  sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Lenoble made all necessary inquiries at the  office of the Messageries, and carried the intelligence to Madame Meynell. He  could see that she winced a little when he told her the cost of the journey,  which in those days was heavy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must certainly be poor,&rdquo; he said to himself;  and it rent his heart to think that even in this paltry matter he could be of  no use to her. The destined master of Beaubocage and C&ocirc;tenoir was entirely  without ready money. He had his watch. He put his hand upon that clumsy  timekeeper as he talked to madame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Je te  porterai chez ma tante, mon gars</em>,&rdquo; he said to himself. But he doubted  whether the high priests of the pious mountain &mdash; the Dordona of Pauperism &mdash;  would advance much upon this antique specimen of the watchmaker&rsquo;s art.</p>
<p>After this evening he looked forward daily, hourly,  to the anguish of her departure. She would vanish out of his life, intangible  as a melted snow-flake, and only memory would stay behind to tell him he had  known and loved her. Why should this be so hard to bear? If she stayed, he  dared not tell her she was dear to him; he dared not stretch forth his hand to  help her. In all the world there was no creature more utterly apart from him  than she, whether she lived in the same house with him or was distant as the  Antipodes. What did it matter, then, since she was destined to disappear from  his life, whether she vanished to-day or a year hence? He argued with himself  that it could be a question of no moment to him. There was a death-blow that  must descend upon him, cruel, inevitable. Let it come when it would.</p>
<p>Every day when he came home to dinner, M. Lenoble  expected to behold a vacant place by the side of his hostess; every day he was  pleasantly disappointed. The pale hopeless face was still to be seen,  ghost-like, at that noisy board. The face was more pale, more hopeless, as it  seemed to Gustave, every day he looked upon it.</p>
<p>He asked Madame Magnotte when the English lady was  going to leave, but she could not tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She talks of leaving from day to day,&rdquo; said  madame; &ldquo;it will no doubt be soon. I am sorry to lose her. She is very gentle,  and gives no trouble to any one. But she is sad &mdash; ah, how sad she is! She has  suffered, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave agreed to this. Yes, she had suffered; but  what, and how?</p>
<p>He watched her closely, but she was always the  same. She no longer spent her evenings in the salon, but in her own apartment.  He saw her only at dinner-time, and had no opportunity of speaking to her.</p>
<p>At last the day came upon which he missed her at  the usual hour. He sat through the tedious meal without speaking; eating a  little, drinking a little, mechanically, but with no consciousness of what he  ate or drank. There was a mist before his eyes, a confusion of voices in his  ears; but the faculties of sight and hearing seemed suspended. The agony he  suffered during that miserable hour was bitter as death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, my God, how I love her!&rdquo; he said to himself,  while Raoul&rsquo;s bass roar brayed in his ear on one side, and Leon&rsquo;s shrill squeal  tortured him on the other.</p>
<p>He made his way to Madame Magnotte directly after  dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is gone?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who, my friend? Ah, yes; it is of that poor  Madame Meynell you speak. How you are interested in her! No, she is not gone,  poor woman. She remains always. She has the air of a person who knows not her  own mind. Yet I am sure she thinks of going. To-day, for the first time, she  has been writing letters. Reine came to tell me she had seen her occupied in  her own room for the first time. It is not her habit to occupy herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave&rsquo;s heart gave a great jump. She was not  gone; he might see her again &mdash; if it were but a glimpse of her pale face  looking out of the diligence as it drove out of the Cour de Messageries. One  look, one glance; it would be something to carry in his heart all his life. All  his life! He looked forward and shuddered. What a dreary life it must needs be!  C&ocirc;tenoir, Beaubocage, Madelon, the law; to plead, to read papers, to study dry  as dust books. He shrank appalled from the contemplation of that dreary desert  of existence &mdash; a life without her.</p>
<p>She had been writing letters &mdash; doubtless letters to  her friends to announce her return. Her departure must be very near at hand.</p>
<p>Gustave refused to go out that evening. His  fellow-students were bent on a night&rsquo;s pleasure at a dancing-garden then in  vogue, where there would be twinkling lamps and merry music under the May moon.  The lamp-lit parterres, the joyous waltzes, had no attractions for Gustave  Lenoble. He haunted the dull salon, dim and dreary in the twilight; for Madame  Magnotte was chary of lamps and candles, and prolonged to its utmost limits the  pensive interval between day and night. He walked softly up and down the room,  unheeded by the ladies clustered in a group by one of the windows. Restless and  unhappy, he could neither go nor stay. She was not coming down to the salon  this evening. He had clung to the faint hope that she might appear; but the faint  hope died away in his breast as the night deepened. What purpose could be  served by his remaining in that dismal room? He was no nearer her than he would  have been in the remotest wilds of Central America. He would go out &mdash; not to  the odious dancing-garden, but to the cool dark streets, where the night wind  might blow this fever from his brain.</p>
<p>He left the room suddenly, and hurried downstairs.  At the bottom of the staircase he almost stumbled against a woman, who turned  and looked at him in the light of a little oil-lamp that hung over the door of  the portress&rsquo;s lodge.</p>
<p>It was the Englishwoman, deadly pale, and with a  wild look in her face that Gustave had never seen there before. She gave him no  sign of recognition, but passed out of the courtyard, and walked rapidly away.  That unusual look in her face, the strangeness of the fact that she should be  leaving the house at this hour, inspired him with a vague terror, and he  followed her, not stealthily, without a thought that he was doing any wrong by  such an act &mdash; rather, indeed, with the conviction that he had a right so to  follow her.</p>
<p>She walked very quickly &mdash; at a more rapid pace than  Gustave would have supposed possible for so fragile a creature. She chose the  lonelier streets, and Gustave had no difficulty in following her; she never  looked back, but went straight on her course, without pause or slackening of  her pace, as if with a settled purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can she be going?&rdquo; Gustave asked himself;  and an answer, vague, hideous, terrible, suggested itself to his mind. The idea  that occurred to him was one that would scarcely have occurred to an Englishman  under the same circumstances, but to a Frenchman it was a very familiar idea.</p>
<p>It was dark now &mdash; the darkness that reigns between  early sunset and late moonrise. As the lonely woman went farther along the  dreary streets parallel with the quay, the dreadful suspicion grew stronger in  Gustave&rsquo;s mind. From that instant he had but one thought; in that moment he put  away from him for ever all sense of obligation to Madelon Frehlter; he shook  off father, mother, sister, old associations, home ties, ambition, fortune &mdash; he  lived alone for this woman, and the purpose of his life was to save her from  despair and death.</p>
<p>They emerged upon the quay at last. The long stretch  of pavement was deserted. Ah, now she looked back &mdash; she looked on every side  with wild unseeing eyes &mdash; and now there could be little doubt as to the purpose  that brought her here. She crossed the road, and went upon the bridge, Gustave  following close; in the next minute she was standing on the stone bench, a  tremulous, fluttering figure, with arms stretched towards the water; in a  breath she was clasped to Gustave&rsquo;s breast, clasped by arms that meant to hold  her for ever.</p>
<p>The shock of that surprise utterly unnerved the  wretched creature. She shivered violently, and struggled to free herself from  those strong arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; she cried in English. &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; And  then, finding herself powerless, she turned and looked at her captor. &ldquo;M.  Lenoble! O, why do you persecute me? Why do you follow me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I want to save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To save me! To snatch me back when I was going to  find rest &mdash; an end for my weary life! O yes, I know that it is a sinful end;  but my life has been all sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your life all sin! Foolish one, I will never  believe that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she cried, with passionate  self-reproach. &ldquo;The sin of selfishness, and pride, and disobedience. There is  no fate too hard for me &mdash; but, O, my fate is very hard! Why did you keep me  from that river? You do not know how miserable my life is &mdash; you do not know. I  paid my last penny to Madame Magnotte this morning. I have no money to take me  back to England, even if I dared go there &mdash; and I dare not. I have prayed for  courage, for strength to go back, but my prayers have not been heard; and there  is nothing for me but to die. What would be the sin of my throwing myself into  that river! I must die; I shall die of starvation in the streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Gustave passionately; &ldquo;do you think  I have dragged you back from death to give you to loneliness and despair? My  dear one, you are mine &mdash; mine by right of this night. These arms that have kept  you from death shall shelter you, &mdash; ah, let them shelter you! These hands shall  work for you. My love, my love! you cannot tell how dear you are to me. If  there must be want or trouble for either of us, it shall come to me first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had placed her on the stone bench, bewildered  and unresisting, and had seated himself by her side. The fragile figure,  shivering still, even in the mild atmosphere of the spring night, was sustained  by his encircling arm. He felt that she was his, irrevocably and entirely &mdash;  given to him by the Providence which would have seemed to have abandoned her,  but for the love it had implanted for her in this one faithful heart. His tone  had all the pleading tenderness of a lover&rsquo;s, but it had something more &mdash; an  authority, a sense of possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providence sent me here to save you,&rdquo; he said,  with that gentle yet authoritative tone; &ldquo;I am your providence, am I not,  dearest? Fate made me love you &mdash; fondly, hopelessly, as I thought. Yesterday  you seemed as far away from me as those pale stars, shining up yonder &mdash; as  incomprehensible as that faint silvery mist above the rising moon &mdash; and  to-night you are my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew not what ties might be broken by this act.  He had indeed a vague consciousness that the step which he was now taking would  cause a lifelong breach between himself and his father. But the time had gone  by in which he could count the cost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go back, M. Lenoble,&rdquo; the Englishwoman said  presently. The faintness of terror was passing away, and she spoke almost  calmly. &ldquo;Let me go back to the house. It is you that have saved me from a  dreadful sin. I promise you that I will not again think of committing that  deadly sin. I will wait for the end to come. Let me go, my kind friend. Ah, no,  no; do not detain me! Forget that you have ever known me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not in my power. I will take you back to  the Pension Magnotte directly; but you must first promise to be my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife! O, no, no, no! That is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you do not love me,&rdquo; said Gustave, with  mournful gravity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am not worthy of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humiliation and self-reproach unspeakable were  conveyed in those few words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are worth all the stars to me. If I had them  in my hands, those lamps shining up there, I would throw them away, to hold  you,&rdquo; said the student passionately. &ldquo;You cannot understand my love, perhaps. I  seem a stranger to you, and all I say sounds wild and foolish. My love, it is  true as the heaven above us &mdash; true as life or death &mdash; death that was so near  you just now. I have loved you ever since that bleak March morning on which I  saw you sitting under the leafless trees yonder. You held me from that moment. I  was subjugated &mdash; possessed &mdash; yours at once and for ever. I would not confess  even to myself that my heart had resigned itself to you; but I know now that it  was so from the first. Is there any hope that you will ever pay me back one  tithe of my love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love me,&rdquo; the Englishwoman repeated slowly, as  if the words were almost beyond her comprehension,&mdash; &ldquo;you love <em>me</em>, a creature so lost, so friendless!  Ah, but you do not know my wretched story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not ask to know it. I only ask one question &mdash;  will you be my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be mad to offer your name, your honour to  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am mad &mdash; madly in love. And I am waiting  for your answer. You will be my wife? My angel, you will say yes! It is not  much that I offer you &mdash; a life of uncertainty, perhaps even of poverty; but a  fond and constant heart, and a head and hands that will work for you while God  gives them strength. It is better than the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that was thoughtless and hopeful in his  disposition was expressed in these words. The woman to whom he pleaded was  weakened by sorrow, and the devotion of this brave true heart brought her  strength, comfort, almost hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be my friend?&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;Your  words seem to bring me back to life. I wanted to die because I was so wretched,  so lonely. I have friends in England &mdash; friends who were once all that is dear  and kind; but I dare not go to them. I think a cruel look from one of those  friends would kill me with a pain more bitter than any other death could give.  And I have no right to hope for kind looks from them. Yours are the only words  of friendship I have heard for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will give me the right to work for you &mdash;  to protect you? You will be my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather be your servant,&rdquo; she answered,  with sad humility. &ldquo;What right have I to accept so great a sacrifice? What  folly can be so foolish as your love for me &mdash; if it is indeed love, and not a  wild fancy of to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a fancy that will last my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you do not know how such fancies change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing except that mine is changeless.  Come, my love, it is
  growing late and cold. Let me take you home. The portress will wonder.
  You must slip past her quietly with your veil down. Did you give old
  Margot your key when you came down stairs to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is in my pocket. I was not thinking &mdash; I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped with a sudden shudder. Gustave  understood that shudder; he also shuddered. She had left her room that night  possessed by the suicide&rsquo;s madness; she had left it to come straight to death.  Happily his strong arm had come between her and that cruel grave by which they  were still lingering.</p>
<p>They walked slowly back to the Rue  Grande-Mademoiselle under the light of the newly-risen moon. The Englishwoman&rsquo;s  wasted hand rested for the first time on M. Lenoble&rsquo;s arm. She was his &mdash; his by  the intervention and by the decree of Providence! That became a conviction in  the young man&rsquo;s mind. He covered her late return to the house with diplomatic  art, engaging the portress in conversation while the dark figure glided past in  the dim lamplight. On the staircase he paused to bid her good night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will walk with me in the Luxembourg garden  to-morrow morning, dearest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have so much to say &mdash; so much. Until  then, adieu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her hand, and left her on the threshold  of her apartment, and then went to his own humble bachelor&rsquo;s chamber, singing a  little drinking song in his deep manly voice, happy beyond all measure.</p>
<p>They walked together next day in the gardens of the  Luxembourg. The poor lonely creature whom Gustave had rescued seemed already to  look up to him as a friend and protector, if not in the character of a future  husband. It was no longer this fair stranger who held possession of Gustave; it  was Gustave who had taken possession of her. The stronger nature had subjugated  the weaker. So friendless, so utterly destitute &mdash; penniless, helpless, in a  strange land, it is little matter for wonder that Susan Meynell accepted the  love that was at once a refuge and a shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you my wretched story,&rdquo; she pleaded, as  she walked under the chestnut-trees by her lover&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Let me tell you  everything. And if, when you have heard what an unhappy creature I am, you  still wish to give me your heart, your name, I will be obedient to your wish. I  will not speak to you of gratitude. If you could understand how debased an  outcast I seemed to myself last night when I went to the river, you would know  how I must feel your goodness. But you can never understand &mdash; you can never  know what you seem to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then in a low voice, and with infinite shame  and hesitation, she told him her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was a tradesman in the city of London,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;We were very well off, and my home ought to have been a happy one.  Ah, how happy such a home would seem to me now! But I was idle and frivolous  and discontented in those days, and was dissatisfied with our life in the city  because it seemed dull and monotonous to me. When I look back now and remember  how poor a return I gave for the love that was given to me &mdash; my mother&rsquo;s  anxiety, my father&rsquo;s steady, unpretending kindness &mdash; I feel how well I have  deserved the sorrows that have come to me since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused here, but Gustave did not interrupt her.  His interest was too profound for any conventional expression. He was listening  to the story of his future wife&rsquo;s youth. That there could be any passage in  that history which would hinder him from claiming this woman as his wife was a  possibility he did not for a moment contemplate. If there were shame involved  in the story, as Madame Meynell&rsquo;s manner led him to suppose there must be, so  much the worse was it for him, since the shame must be his, as she was his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my father and mother died, I went into  Yorkshire to live with my married sister. I cannot find words to tell you how  kind they were to me &mdash; my sister and her husband. I had a little money left me  by my father, and I spent the greater part of it on fine dress, and on foolish  presents to my sister and her children. I was happier in Yorkshire than I had  been in London; for I saw more people, and my life seemed gayer and brighter  than in the city. One day I saw a gentleman, the brother of a nobleman who  lived in the neighbourhood of my sister&rsquo;s house. We met by accident in a field  on my brother-in-law&rsquo;s farm, where the gentleman was shooting; and after that  he came to the house. He had seen my sister before, and made some excuse for  renewing his acquaintance. He came very often, and before long he asked me to  marry him; and I promised to be his wife, with my sister&rsquo;s knowledge and  consent. She loved me so dearly, and was so proud of me out of her dear love,  that she saw nothing wonderful in this engagement, especially as Mr. Kingdon,  the gentleman I am speaking of, was a younger son, and by no means a rich man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she stopped, and waited a little before  continuing her story. Only by a gentle pressure of the tremulous hand resting  on his arm did Gustave express his sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you, how happy I was in those days &mdash;  so bright, so brief. I cannot tell you how I loved Montague Kingdon. When I  look back to that time of my life, it seems like a picture standing out against  a background of darkness, with some strange vivid light shining upon it. It was  arranged between Montague and my sister that we should be married as soon as  his brother, Lord Durnsville, had paid his debts. The payment of the debts was  an old promise of Lord Durnsville&rsquo;s, and an imprudent marriage on his brother&rsquo;s  part might have prevented the performance of it. This is what Montague told my  sister Charlotte. She begged him to confide in her husband, my kind  brother-in-law, but this he refused to do. There came a day very soon after  this when James Halliday, my brother-in-law, was told about Montague Kingdon&rsquo;s  visits to the farm. He came home and found Mr. Kingdon with us; and then there  was a dreadful scene between them. James forbade Mr. Kingdon ever again to set  foot in his house. He scolded my sister, he warned me. It was all no use. I  loved Montague Kingdon as you say you love me &mdash; foolishly, recklessly. I could  not disbelieve or doubt him. When he told me of his plans for our marriage,  which was to be kept secret until Lord Durnsville had paid his debts, I  consented to leave Newhall with him to be married in London. If he had asked me  for my life, I must have given it to him. And how should I disbelieve his  promises when I had lived only amongst people who were truth itself? He knew  that I had friends in London, and it was arranged between us that I was to be  married from the house of one of them, who had been my girlish companion, and  who was now well married. I was to write, telling her of my intended journey to  town; and on the following night I was to leave Newhall secretly with Montague  Kingdon. I was to make my peace with my sister and her husband after my  marriage. How shall I tell you the rest? From the first to last he deceived me.  The carriage that was, as I believed, to have taken us to London, carried us to  Hull. From Hull we crossed to Hamburg. From that time my story is all shame and  misery. I think my heart broke in the hour in which I discovered that I had  been cheated. I loved him, and clung to him long after I knew him to be selfish  and false and cruel. It seemed to be a part of my nature to love him. My life  was not the kind of life one reads of in novels. It was no existence of  splendour and luxury and riot, but one long struggle with debt and difficulty.  We lived abroad &mdash; not for our pleasure, but because Mr. Kingdon could not  venture to appear in England. His brother, Lord Durnsville, had never promised  to pay his debts. That was a falsehood invented to deceive my sister. For seven  long weary years I was his slave, a true and faithful slave; his nurse in  illness, his patient drudge at all times. We had been wandering about France  for two years, when he brought me to Paris; and it was here he first began to  neglect me. O, if you could know the dreary days and nights I have spent at the  hotel on the other side of the river, where we lived, you would pity me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear love, my heart is all pity for you,&rdquo; said  Gustave. &ldquo;Do not tell me any more. I can guess the end of the story. There came  a day in which neglect gave place to desertion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Mr. Kingdon left me one day without a warning  word to break the blow. I had been waiting and watching for him through two  weary days and nights, when there came a letter to tell me he was on his way to  Vienna with a West Indian gentleman and his daughter. He was to be married to  the daughter. It was his poverty, he told me, which compelled this step. He advised  me to go back to my friends in Yorkshire. To go back! &mdash; as if he did not know  that death would be easier to me. There was a small sum of money in the letter,  on which I have lived since that time. When you first met me here, I had not  long received that letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the end of her story. In the depth of her  humiliation she dared not lift her eyes to the face of her companion; but she  felt his hand clasp hers, and knew that he was still her friend. This was all  she asked of Providence.</p>
<p>To Gustave Lenoble the story had been unutterably  painful. He had hoped to hear a tragedy untarnished by shame, and the shame was  very bitter to him. This woman whom he loved so fondly was no spotless martyr,  the victim of inevitable fate, beautiful and sublime in her affliction. She was  only a weak vain, village beauty who had suffered herself to be lured away from  her peaceful home by the falsehoods of a commonplace scoundrel.</p>
<p>The story was common, the shame was common, but it  seemed to M. Lenoble that the woman by his side was his destiny; and then,  prompt to the rescue of offended pride, of outraged love &mdash; tortured to think  that she, so distant and pure a creature to him, should have been trampled in  the dust by another &mdash; came the white-winged angel Pity. By her weakness, by her  humiliation, by the memory of her suffering, Pity conjured him to love her so  much the more dearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;it is a very sad  story, and you and I will never speak of it again. We will bury the memory of  Montague Kingdon in the deepest grave that was ever dug for bitter  remembrances; and we will begin a new life together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the end of M. Lenoble&rsquo;s wooing. He could  not speak of his love any more while the sound of Montague Kingdon&rsquo;s name had  but lately died away on Susan Meynell&rsquo;s lips. He had taken her to himself, with  all her sorrows and sins, in the hour in which he snatched her from death; and  between these two there was no need of passionate protestations or sentimental  rapture.</p>
<p>M. Lenoble speedily discovered that the law had  made no provision for the necessities of a chivalrous young student eager to  unite himself with a friendless foreign woman, who could not produce so much as  one of the thirty witnesses required to establish her identity. A very little  consideration showed Gustave that a marriage between him and Susan Meynell in  France was an impossibility. He explained this, and asked her if she would  trust him as she had trusted Montague Kingdon. In Jersey the marriage might  easily be solemnised. Would she go with him to Jersey, to stay there so long as  the English law required for the solemnization of their union?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you take so much trouble about me?&rdquo;  said Susan, in her low sad voice. &ldquo;You are too good, too generous. I am not  worth so much care and thought from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does that mean that you will not trust me, Susan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would trust you with my life in a desert,  thousands of miles from the rest of mankind &mdash; with a happier life than mine. I  have no feeling in my heart but love for you, and faith in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this the rest was easy. The lovers left the  Pension Magnotte one bright summer morning, and journeyed to Jersey, where,  after a fortnight&rsquo;s sojourn, the English Protestant church united them in the  bonds of matrimony.</p>
<p>Susan was a Protestant, Gustave a Catholic, but the  difference of religion divided them no more than the difference of country.  They came back to Paris directly after the marriage, and M. Lenoble took a very  modest lodging for himself and his wife in a narrow street near the Pantheon &mdash;  a fourth story, very humbly furnished. M. Lenoble had provided for himself an  opportunity of testing the truth of that adage which declares that a purse  large enough for one is also large enough for two.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  A Decree Of Banishment</h2>
<p>After those stormy emotions which accompany the  doing of a desperate deed, there comes in the minds of men a dead calm. The  still small voice of Wisdom, unheard while Passion&rsquo;s tempest was raging,  whispers grave counsel or mild reproof; and Folly, who, seen athwart the  storm-cloud, sublime in the glare of the lightning, seemed inspiration, veils  her face in the clear, common light of day.</p>
<p>Let it not for a moment be supposed that with M.  Lenoble time and reflection brought repentance in their train. It was not so.  The love which he felt for his English wife was no capricious emotion; it was a  passion deep and strong as destiny. The worst that afterthought could reveal to  him was the fact that the step he had taken was a very desperate one. Before  him lay an awful necessity &mdash; the necessity of going to Beaubocage to tell those  who loved him how their air-built castles had been shattered by this deed of  his.</p>
<p>The letters from Cydalise &mdash; nay, indeed, more than  one letter from his mother, with whom letter-writing was an exceptional  business &mdash; had of late expressed much anxiety. In less than a month the  marriage-contract would be made ready for his signature. Every hour&rsquo;s delay was  a new dishonour. He told his wife that he must go home for a few days; and she  prepared his travelling gear, with a sweet dutiful care that seemed to him like  the ministration of an angel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling girl, can I ever repay you for the  happiness you have brought me!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he watched the slight girlish  figure flitting about the room, busy with the preparations for his journey.</p>
<p>And then he thought of Madelon Frehlter &mdash;  commonplace, stiff, and unimpressionable &mdash; the most conventional of  school-girls, heavy in face, in figure, in step, in mind even, as it had seemed  to him, despite his sister&rsquo;s praises.</p>
<p>He had been too generous to tell Susan of his  engagement, of the brilliant prospects he forfeited by his marriage, or the  risk which he ran of offending his father by that rash step. But to-night, when  he thought of Madelon&rsquo;s dulness and commonness, it seemed to him as if Susan  had in manner rescued him from a dreadful fate &mdash; as maidens were rescued from  sea-monsters in the days of Perseus and Heracles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madelon is not unlike a whale,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;They  tell us that whales are of a sagacious and amiable temper, &mdash; and Cydalise was  always talking of Madelon&rsquo;s good sense and amiablity. I am sure it is quite as  easy to believe in the unparalleled virtues of the whale as in the unparalleled  virtues of Madelon Frehlter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His valise was packed, and he departed for  Beaubocage, after a sad and tender parting from his wife. The journey was a  long one in those days, when no express train had yet thundered across the  winding Seine, cleaving its iron way through the bosom of fertile Norman  valleys. M. Lenoble had ample time for reflection as he jogged along in the  ponderous diligence; and his heart grew more and more heavy as the lumbering  vehicle approached nearer to the town of Vevinord, whence he was to make his  way to the paternal mansion as best he might.</p>
<p>He walked to Beaubocage, attended by a peasant lad,  who carried his portmanteau. The country was very pleasant in the quiet summer  evening, but conscious guilt oppressed the heart and perplexity disturbed the  mind of M. Gustave Lenoble, and his spirits were in nowise elevated by the  walk.</p>
<p>Lights in the lower chambers gleamed dimly athwart  the trim garden at Beaubocage. One faint twinkling candle shone in a little  pepper-castor turret, his sister&rsquo;s room. The thought of their glad welcome  smote his heart. How could he shape the words that must inform them of their  disappointment? And then he thought of the gentle pensive wife in the Parisian  lodging, so grateful for his devotion, so tender and submissive, &mdash; the wife he  had rescued from death and eternal condemnation, as it seemed to his pious  Catholic mind. The thought of this dear one gave him courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe much to my parents,&rdquo; he thought to himself,  &ldquo;but not the privilege to sell me for money. The marriage they want to bring  about would be a sordid barter of my heart and my honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes after this he was standing in the  little salon at Beaubocage, with his mother and sister hanging about him and  caressing him, his father standing near, less demonstrative, but evidently well  pleased by this unexpected arrival of the son and heir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard thy voice in the hall,&rdquo; cried Cydalise,  &ldquo;and flew down from my room to welcome thee. It seems to me that one can fly on  these occasions. And how thou art looking well, and how thou art handsome, and  how I adore thee!&rdquo; cries the damsel, more ecstatic than an English sister on a  like occasion. &ldquo;Dost thou know that we began to alarm ourselves about thee? Thy  letters became so infrequent, so cold. And all the while thou didst plot this  surprise for us. Ah, how it is sweet to see thee again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the mother took up the strain, and anon  was spoken the dreaded name of Madelon. She too would be glad &mdash; she too had  been anxious. The prodigal made no answer. He could not speak, his heart sank  within him, he grew cold and pale; to inflict pain on those who loved him was a  sharper pain than death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gustave!&rdquo; cried the mother, in sudden alarm, &ldquo;thou  growest pale &mdash; thou art ill! Look then, Fran&ccedil;ois, thy son is ill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother, I am not ill,&rdquo; the young man replied  gravely. He kissed his mother, and put her gently away from him. In all the  years of her after-life she remembered that kiss, cold as death, for it was the  farewell kiss of her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to speak a few words with you alone,  father,&rdquo; said Gustave.</p>
<p>The father was surprised, but in no manner alarmed  by this request. He led the way to his den, a small and dingy chamber, where  there were some dusty editions of the French classics, and where the master of  Beaubocage kept accounts and garden-seeds and horse-medicines.</p>
<p>When they were gone, the mother and sister sat by  one of the open windows, waiting for them. Without all was still. Distant  lights glimmered through the summer twilight, the lighted windows of C&ocirc;tenoir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How pleased Madelon will be,&rdquo; said Cydalise,  looking towards those glimmering windows. She had really taught herself to  believe that the demoiselle Frehlter was a most estimable young person; but she  would have been glad to find more enthusiasm, more brightness and vivacity, in  her future sister-in-law.</p>
<p>The interview between the father and son seemed  long to Madame Lenoble and Cydalise. The two women were curious &mdash; nay, indeed,  somewhat anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear he has made debts,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;and  is telling thy father of his follies. I know not how they are to be paid,  unless with the dowry of Madelon, and that would seem a dishonourable use of  her money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was half an hour before any sound broke the  stillness of that quiet house. Twilight had thickened into night, when there  came a banging of doors and heavy footsteps in the hall. The door of the salon  was opened, and M. Lenoble came in alone. At the same moment the outer door  closed heavily.</p>
<p>M. Lenoble went straight to the open window and  closed the Venetian shutters. He went from thence to the second window, the shutters  whereof he fastened carefully, while the women stared at him wonderingly, for  it was not his habit to perform this office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am shutting out a vagabond,&rdquo; he said, in a cold,  cruel voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Gustave?&rdquo; cried the mother, alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is coming back, is he not, directly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never while I live!&rdquo; answered M. Lenoble. &ldquo;He has  married an English adventuress, and is no longer any son of mine.&rdquo;</p>

  The Fate Of Susan Lenoble</h2>
<p>Seven years after that miserable summer night at  Beaubocage on which Gustave Lenoble was disowned by his father, a man and  woman, with a boy five years of age, were starving in a garret amongst the  housetops and chimneys of Rouen. In the busy city these people lived lonely as  in a forest, and were securely hidden from the eyes of all who had ever known  them. The man &mdash; haggard, dying &mdash; cherished a pride that had grown fiercer as  the grip of poverty tightened upon him. The woman lived only for her husband  and her child.</p>
<p>The man was Gustave Lenoble. The world had gone ill  with him since he cast his destiny into the lap of the woman he loved. In all  these years no olive-bearing dove had spanned the gulf that yawned between the  prodigal and his father. The seigneur of Beaubocage had been marble. A  narrow-minded old man, living his narrow life, and nursing one idea with  fanatical devotion, was of all men the least likely to forgive. Vain had been  the tears and entreaties of mother and sister. The doors of that joyless  dwelling on the fertile flats beyond Vevinord were sealed against the offender  with a seal not to be broken, even had he come thither to plead for pardon,  which he did not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father would have sold me as negro slaves are  sold <em>l&agrave;-bas</em>,&rdquo; he said, on those rare  occasions when he opened his old wounds, which were to the last unhealed: &ldquo;I am  glad that I escaped the contemptible barter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was in very truth glad. Poverty and hardship  seemed to him easier to bear than the dreary prosperity of C&ocirc;tenoir and a wife  he could not have loved. The distinguishing qualities of this man&rsquo;s mind were  courage and constancy. There are such noble souls born into the world, some to  shine with lustre supernal, many to burn and die in social depths, obscure as  ocean&rsquo;s deepest cavern.</p>
<p>In his love for the woman he had chosen Gustave  Lenoble never wavered. He worked for her, he endured for her, he hoped against  hope for her sake; and it was only when bodily strength failed that this  nameless foot-soldier began to droop and falter in life&rsquo;s bitter battle. Things  had gone ill with him. He had tried his fate as an advocate in Paris, in Caen,  in Rouen &mdash; but clients would not come. He had been a clerk, now in one  counting-house, now in another, and Susan and he had existed somehow during the  seven years of their married life.</p>
<p>They clung to each other with affection that seemed  to grow with every new sorrow; nor did love exhibit any inclination to spread  his wings and take flight from the window, though poverty came in every day at  the door, and sat by the hearth, a familiar companion and inevitable guest.</p>
<p>The mother and sister contrived to help this poor  castaway with the veriest scrapings of a miserly household. The old man, soured  by his great disappointment, grew sordid and covetous with increasing years,  and the lives of the women were hard and hopeless. By little cheats, and petty  contrivances, and pitiful falsifications of financial statements, they managed  to scrape together a few louis now and then for the struggling exile; and to do  this was the sole delight of their patient lives. They contrived also to  correspond secretly with Gustave, and were informed of the birth of his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, if thou couldst see how beautiful he is,&rdquo;  wrote the father, &ldquo;this child of pure and true love, thou wouldst no longer  regret my breach of faith with Madelon Frehlter. I knew not until now how like  infant children are to angels. I knew not how true to nature are the angels in  the pictures of Raffaelle and Murillo. Thou knowest the print of Murillo&rsquo;s  Assumption; the picture is in the Louvre. If thou canst remember that picture,  dear mother, thou hast but to recall the face of one of the cherubim about the  feet of our Lady, and thou hast the portrait of my boy. He opens his eyes, and  looks at me as I write. Ah! that he and I and my Susan were with thee in the  little salon at Beaubocage &mdash; my sister, Susan, you, and I united round this  darling&rsquo;s cradle. He has been born in poverty, but his birth has made us very  happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentiment of this letter was no spurious or  transient feeling. For this child Gustave Lenoble evinced an unchanging  fondness. It was indeed no part of his nature to change. The little one was his  comfort in affliction, his joy during every brief interval of prosperity. When  the battle was well nigh fought, and he began to feel himself beaten; his chief  anxieties, his ever-returning fears, were for his wife and child.</p>
<p>To Susan the thought of parting from him was a  despair too deep for tears. She would have been something less than woman if  she had not loved her husband with more than common affection. She watched the  change that illness brought in the frank face, the stalwart figure; and little  by little the awful truth came home to her. The hour was at hand in which she  must lose him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could have rest, Gustave, better medical  advice, more comforts, you would soon be strong again. I am sure your father  would not refuse to forgive you now. Write to him, dearest. Go back to  Beaubocage, and let your mother and sister nurse you. I will stay here with the  little one. It shall be forgotten that you have a wife and child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear one; I will not desert you, even for a  day, to buy back my father&rsquo;s love. I would rather be here with you than in the  pleasantest home without you. But we must face the future, Susan; we must be  brave and wise, for the little one&rsquo;s sake. You are not so strong that you can  afford to trust blindly in your power to protect him by-and-by. I have written  a letter to my father. He has proved himself a hard man to me, cruel and  obdurate beyond all my fears; but I know he is not altogether heartless. When I  am dead, you will take the letter in one hand, the child in the other, and go  to Beaubocage. I believe he will adopt the boy, and that the little one will  give him the comfort and happiness he hoped from me. He must be very lonely;  and I cannot doubt that his heart will melt when he sees the child&rsquo;s face, and  hears that he has no longer a son. As for yourself, my poor girl, I see for you  no hope except in the old Yorkshire home, and the friends you fear to see  again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I no longer fear them,&rdquo; said his wife, with  unwonted energy, &ldquo;I could not go to them seven years ago; but I can go to them  as your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, thank God, the poor name is worth something  for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear; and I will go back to them &mdash; to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, Gustave. I have been selfish and cruel  to delay so long. The old dread of seeing my sister&rsquo;s reproachful face has been  strong enough to hold me back, when a little courage might have enabled me to  help you. The burden has been all on you, and I have done nothing. O, what a  wretch I must have been to sit idly by and see you suffer, and make no effort  to help you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my darling, you have not been idle. You have  been the dearest and most industrious of wives, and have helped me to bear my  burden. You have done more, dear &mdash; you have made my burden pleasant to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try to lighten it, Gustave,&rdquo; cried Susan,  with excitement. &ldquo;O, why, why did I never try before! My sister and her husband  are well off &mdash; rich perhaps. If they are still living, if no cruel changes have  come to pass at Newhall, they could help us with a little money. They might  even give us a home. I will start for England to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my dear, you are not strong enough to travel  so far alone. It seems, indeed, a happy thought this of your rich relations;  but you must not undertake such a journey. You might write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Gustave, I will trust to no letter; I will go.  It will be no pain for me to humble myself for your sake. I will go straight to  my sister. I know what a tender compassionate heart it is that I shall appeal  to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was much discussion; but Susan was resolute.  To scrape together the money for the journey she made efforts that were heroic  in a nature so weak as hers. She went to the Monte de Pi&eacute;t&eacute; with the last of  her little treasures, that one dear trinket to which she had clung even when  hunger was at the door &mdash; the gimmal or alliance ring that Gustave had placed  upon her finger before God&rsquo;s altar &mdash; the double symbolic circlet which bore on  one side her name, on the other her husband&rsquo;s. This dearest of all her  possessions she surrendered for a few francs, to make up the sum needful for  her journey.</p>
<p>What it cost her to do this, what it cost her to  tear herself away from her sick husband and her only child, who shall say?  There are pangs that cannot be counted, agonies that will come within no  calculation &mdash; the infinite of pain. She went. Two kind souls, a labourer and  his wife, lodgers in the same garret-story, promised to care for and help the  invalid and child. There is no desolation in which a child will not find a  friend.</p>
<p>The journey was long and fatiguing; the anguish of  her poor aching heart almost too much for endurance &mdash; a heart so heavy that  even hope could scarce flutter it. It was dull damp weather, though in the  middle of summer. The solitary traveller caught cold on the journey, and  arrived in London in a high fever. Ill, faint, and helpless, the great city  seemed to her unspeakably dismal &mdash; most stony of all stony-hearted mothers to  this wretched orphan. She could go no farther than the darksome city inn where  the coach from Southampton brought her. She had come <em>vi&acirc;</em> Havre. Here she sank prostrate, and had barely sufficient  strength to write an incoherent letter to her sister, Mrs. Halliday, of Newhall  Farm, near Huxter&rsquo;s Cross, Yorkshire.</p>
<p>The sister came as fast as the fastest coach on the  great northern road could carry her. There was infinite joy in that honest  sisterly heart over this one sinner&rsquo;s repentance. Fourteen years had gone by  since the young city-bred beauty had fled with that falsest of men, and most  hardened of profligates, Montague Kingdon; and tidings from Susan were unlooked  for and thrilling as a message from the grave.</p>
<p>Alas for the adverse fate of Susan Meynell! The  false step of her youth had set her for ever wrong upon life&rsquo;s highway. When  kind Mrs. Halliday came, Gustave Lenoble&rsquo;s wife was past her help; wandering in  her mind; a girl again, but newly run away from her peaceful home; and with no  thought save of remorse for her misdeeds.</p>
<p>The seven years of her married life seemed to have  faded out of her mind. She raved of Montague Kingdon&rsquo;s baseness, of her own  folly, her vain regret, her yearning for pardon; but of the dying husband in  the garret at Rouen she uttered no word. And so, with her weary head upon her  sister&rsquo;s breast, she passed away, her story untold, no wedding-ring on her  wasted finger to bear witness that she died an honest man&rsquo;s wife; no letters or  papers in her poor little trunk to throw light on the fourteen years in which  she had been a castaway.</p>
<p>Mrs. Halliday stayed in London to see the wanderer  laid in the quiet city churchyard where her family rested, and where for her  was chosen an obscure corner in which she might repose forgotten and unknown.</p>
<p>But not quite nameless. Mrs. Halliday could not  leave the grave unmarked by any record of the sister she had loved. The stone  above the grave of Gustave&rsquo;s wife bore her maiden name, and the comforting  familiar text about the one sinner who repenteth.</p>

  Forgiven Too Late</h2>
<p>For a week of long days and longer nights there was  no step sounded on the stair, no opening or shutting of a door in the old  dilapidated house where he lay languishing on the brink of an open grave, that  did not move Gustave Lenoble with a sudden emotion of hope. But the footsteps  came and went, the doors were opened and shut again and again, and the  traveller so waited, so hoped for did not return.</p>
<p>The boy &mdash; the brave bright son, who seemed to  inherit all that was noblest and best in his father&rsquo;s nature &mdash; pined for his  mother. The man endured a martyrdom worse than the agony of Damiens, the slow  tortures of La Barre. What had befallen her? That she could desert him or his  child was a possibility that never shaped itself in his mind. <em>That</em> drop of poison was happily wanting  in his cup; and the bitterness of death was sweet compared to the  scorpion-sting of such a supposition.</p>
<p>She did not return. Calamity in some shape had  overtaken her &mdash; calamity dire as death; for, with life and reason, she could  not have failed to send some token, some tidings, to those she loved. The sick  man waited a week after the day on which he had begun to expect her return. At  the end of that time he rose, with death in his face, and went out to look for her  &mdash; to look for her in Rouen; for her whom the instinct of his heart told him was  far away from that city &mdash; as far as death from life. He went to the Cour de  Messageries, and loitered and waited amidst the bustle of arriving and  departing diligences, with a half-imbecile hope that she would alight from one  of them. The travellers came and went, pushing and hustling him in their  selfish haste. When night came he went back to his garret. All was quiet. The  boy slept with the children of his good neighbour, and was comforted by the  warmth of that strange hearth.</p>
<p>Gustave lit his candle, a last remaining morsel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will last my time, friend,&rdquo; he said, with a  wan smile.</p>
<p>He seated himself at the little table, pushed aside  the medicine-bottles, searched for a stray sheet of letter-paper, and then  began to write.</p>
<p>He wrote to his mother, telling her that death was  at hand, and that the time had come in which she must succour her son&rsquo;s orphan  child. With this he enclosed a letter to his father &mdash; that letter of which he  had spoken to his wife, and which had been written in the early days of his  illness. This packet he directed to Madame Lenoble, at Beaubocage. There was no  longer need for secrecy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When those letters are delivered I shall be past  blame, and past forgiveness,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>In the morning he was dead.</p>
<p>The neighbours posted the letter. The neighbours  comforted and protected the child for two days; and then there came a lady,  very sad, very quiet, who wept bitterly in the stillness of that attic chamber  where Gustave Lenoble lay; and who afterwards, with a gentle calmness of manner  that was very sweet to see, made all necessary arrangements for a humble, but  not a mean or ignominious, funeral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was my brother,&rdquo; she said to the good friends  of the neighbouring garret. &ldquo;We did our best to help him, my mother and I; but  we little thought how bitterly he wanted help. The brave heart would not suffer  us to know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she thanked them with much tenderness for  their charity to the dead man; and with these good people she went on foot  through the narrow streets of the city to see her brother laid in his grave.</p>
<p>Until this was done the mournful lady, who was not  yet thirty years of age, and of a placid nun-like beauty, abandoned herself to  no transport of love for her orphan nephew; but when that last office of  affection had been performed, she took the little one on her knees, and folded  him to her breast, and gave him her heart, as she had given it long ago to his  father; for this gentle unselfish creature was one who must needs have some  shrine at which to offer her daily sacrifice of self. Already she was beginning  to think how the orphan was to be cared for and the widow also, for whose  return she looked daily.</p>
<p>For the return of Susan Lenoble Cydalise waited at  Rouen several days after the funeral. She had, happily, an old school-fellow  comfortably established in the city; and in the house of this old friend she  found a home. No one but her mother and this friend, whom she could trust, knew  of the business that had brought her from Beaubocage. In seven years the father  had never uttered his only son&rsquo;s name; in all the seven years that name had  never been spoken in his hearing.</p>
<p>When three weeks had gone by since the departure of  Susan for England, all hope of her return was abandoned by Mademoiselle Lenoble  and the neighbours who had known the absent woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had the stamp of death on her face when she  went away,&rdquo; said the labourer&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;as surely as it was on him that she  left. I told her she had no strength for the journey; but she would go: there  was no moving her from that. She had rich friends <em>l&agrave;-bas</em>, who might help her husband. It was for that she went. That  thought seemed to give her a kind of fever, and the strength of fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there has come no letter &mdash; nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this Cydalise determined to return to  Beaubocage. She could not well leave the child longer on the hands of these  friendly people, even by paying for his maintenance, which she insisted on  doing, though they would fain have shared their humble <em>pot-&agrave;-feu</em> and coarse loaf with him unrecompensed. She determined on  a desperate step. She would take her brother&rsquo;s orphan child back with her, and  leave the rest to Providence &mdash; to the chance of some sudden awakening of  natural affection in a heart that had long languished in a kind of torpor that  was almost death.</p>
<p>The little fellow pined sadly for those dear  familiar faces, those tender soothing voices, that had vanished so suddenly  from his life. But the voice of his aunt was very sweet and tender, and had a  tone that recalled the father who was gone. With this kind aunt he left Rouen  in the lumbering old vehicle that plied daily betwixt that city and Vevinord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou canst call me Cydalise for a while, my little  one,&rdquo; she said to him; for she did not wish the child to proclaim the  relationship between them yet awhile.</p>
<p>Ah, what bitter tears the two women shed over the  soft fair curls of that little head, when they had the boy all to themselves in  the turret chamber at Beaubocage, on whose white walls the eyes of Cydalise had  opened almost every morning of her pure eventless life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why dost thou cry so, madame?&rdquo; the child asked of  his grandmother, as she held him in her arms, kissing and weeping over him;  &ldquo;and what have they done with my father &mdash; and mamma too? She went away one day,  but she told me that she would come back, so quickly, ah, so quickly! and the  days passed, and they shut papa in his room, and would not let me go to him;  and mamma did not come, though I asked the Blessed Virgin to send her back to  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child, thy father and mother are in a  brighter place than this hard world, where they had so much sorrow,&rdquo; Madame  Lenoble answered, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they were often sorry,&rdquo; murmured the boy  thoughtfully. &ldquo;It was because of money; but then, when there was no money,  mamma cried and kissed me, and kissed papa, and the good papa kissed us both,  and somehow it always ended in happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Lenoble was, happily, absent on this day  of tribulation. The women took their fill of sorrow, but it was sorrow mingled  with a strange bitter sweetness that was almost joy. The seigneur of Beaubocage  had gone to dine, as he still often did, with his old friend Baron Frehlter;  for the breach of faith which had caused a lifelong disunion of father and son  had not divided the two proprietors. Nay, indeed the Baron had been generous  enough to plead the cause of the castaway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man cannot dispose at will of his affections, my  friend,&rdquo; he urged; &ldquo;and it was more generous in your son to break faith with my  daughter before marriage than after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Frehlter had not broken her heart on  account of her lover&rsquo;s falsehood. She had been sufficiently indignant on the  occasion, and had been more impatient of her mother&rsquo;s pet priest and pet poodle  during the brief period in which she wore the willow. She had recovered her  good humour, however, on being wooed by a young subaltern in a cavalry regiment  stationed at Vevinord, the offshoot of a grander house than that of Lenoble,  and whose good looks and good lineage had ultimately prevailed with the Baron.  That gentleman had by no means too good an opinion of the son-in-law thus  forced upon him; but peace was the highest good (with unlimited tobacco) to  which his Germanic soul aspired; and for the sake of peace in the present he  was content to hazard his daughter&rsquo;s happiness in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>That</em> is  very brilliant,&rdquo; he said of M. Paul de N&eacute;rague, the young lieutenant of light  cavalry; &ldquo;but it is not solid, like Gustave. Your son is honest, candid &mdash; a  brave heart. It is for that I would have given him Madelon. But it is  Providence which disposes of us, as our good father St. Velours tells us often;  and one must be content. Young N&eacute;rague pleases my daughter, and I must swallow  him, though for me he smells too strong of the barracks: <em>&ccedil;a flaire la caserne, mon ami</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That odour of the barracks which distinguished the  sub-lieutenant Paul de N&eacute;rague became more odious after his marriage with the  virtuous Madelon, when he was established &mdash; <em>nich&eacute;</em>,  as he himself called it &mdash; in very comfortable, though somewhat gruesome,  apartments at C&ocirc;tenoir. His riotous deportment, his hospitable disposition (as  displayed in the frequent entertainment of his brothers-in-arms at the expense  of his father-in-law), his Don Juan-like demeanour in relation to the  housemaids and kitchen-wenches of the ch&acirc;teau &mdash; innocent enough in the main,  but on that account so much the more audacious &mdash; struck terror to the hearts of  Madame Frehlter and her daughter; and the elder lady was much gratified by that  thirst for foreign territory which carried the greater part of the French army  and the regiment of the vivacious Paul to the distant wilds of Algeria.</p>
<p>The virtuous Madelon was too stolid to weep for her  husband. But even her stolidity was not proof against the fiery influence of  jealousy, and, waking and sleeping, her visions were of veiled damsels of  Orient assailing the too inflammable heart of Lieutenant de N&eacute;rague.</p>
<p>The young officer was yet absent at that period in  which Cydalise returned from Rouen with her brother&rsquo;s child.</p>
<p>The little boy was sleeping peacefully in a cot  beside his aunt&rsquo;s bed (it had been his father&rsquo;s cot thirty years ago) when  Fran&ccedil;ois Lenoble returned from C&ocirc;tenoir that night.</p>
<p>It was not till the next day that he saw the child.  He had been making his usual morning&rsquo;s round in the gardens and orchards, when  he came into the salon, and saw the little boy seated near his grandmother&rsquo;s  chair, playing with some dominoes. Something &mdash; perhaps the likeness to his dead  son &mdash; the boy&rsquo;s black clothes, for Cydalise had contrived to dress him in  decent mourning &mdash; struck suddenly on the old man&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;Who is that boy?&rdquo; he  asked, with a strange earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son Gustave&rsquo;s only child,&rdquo; answered his wife  gently,&mdash; &ldquo;his orphan child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Lenoble looked at her, and from her to the  boy; tried to speak, but could not; beckoned the child, and then dropped  heavily into a chair and sobbed aloud. Until this moment no one had ever seen  him shed a tear for the son he had put away from his home &mdash; and, as it had  seemed, from his heart. Not by one sigh, not by one mournful utterance of the  familiar name, had he betrayed the depth of that wound which he had endured,  silently, obstinately, in all these years.</p>
<p>They suffered him to bemoan his dead son unhindered  by stereotyped consolations. The two women stood by, and pitied him in silence.  The little boy stared wonderingly, and at last crept up to the sorrow-stricken  father. &ldquo;Why do you cry, poor old man?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You have not lost your papa  and mamma, as I have lost mine, have you? I want to stay with you and be your  little boy, please. She told me to say that,&rdquo; he added, pointing to  Cydalise.&mdash; &ldquo;And I have said it right, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he asked of the same lady.&mdash; &ldquo;I  think I shall love you, because you are like my papa, only older and uglier,&rdquo;  the little one concluded, with angelic candour.</p>
<p>The seigneur of Beaubocage dried his tears with an  effort. Beaubocage &mdash; C&ocirc;tenoir. Ah, me! what empty sounds those two once magic  names seemed to him now that his son&rsquo;s life had been sacrificed to so paltry an  ambition, so sordid a passion, so vile and grovelling a desire! He took the boy  on his knee, and kissed him tenderly. His thoughts bridged over a chasm of  five-and-twenty years as his lips pressed that fair young brow; and it was his  own son &mdash; the son whom he had disowned &mdash; whose soft hair was mingling itself  now with the grey bristles on his rugged chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; he murmured softly, &ldquo;the fear is that I  shall love thee too well, and be to thee as much too weakly indulgent as I was  wickedly stern to thy father. Anything is easier to humanity than justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said to himself rather than to the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me thy name, little one,&rdquo; he asked presently,  after a few moments&rsquo; pensive meditation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have two names, monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou must call me grandfather. And the two names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fran&ccedil;ois Gustave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall call thee Gustave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But papa always called me Fran&ccedil;ois, and mamma said  it was the name of a cruel man; but papa said he loved the name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no more, little one!&rdquo; cried the lord of  Beaubocage suddenly; &ldquo;thou knowest not with what dagger-thrusts thou dost  pierce this poor old heart.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  Gustave The Second</h2>
<p>The little Gustave grew and flourished. Such love  was lavished on him as rarely falls to the lot of children, though the spring  of many lives may be rich in love&rsquo;s pure white blossom. The existence of this  child seemed all happiness. He brought hope, and a sense of atonement, and all  sweet things, to the quiet family at Beaubocage; and as he grew from childhood  to boyhood, from boyhood to manhood, it seemed to that household as if the  first Gustave of their love had never been taken from them. That Orphic fable  of Zagreus repeats itself in many households. For the one bright creature lost  another is given; and then comes a time when it is almost difficult to separate  the image of the missing one from the dear substitute who so nearly fills his  place.</p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Lenoble and his wife enjoyed a green old  age, and the affection of their grandson made the cup of life sweet for them to  the very dregs. There are, happily, some natures which indulgence cannot  injure; some luxuriant flowers which attain strength as well as beauty under  the influence of these tropical heats of affection. Gustave the second possessed  all the noble qualities of Gustave the first. Frank, generous, brave, constant,  affectionate, light-hearted, he shone on the failing eyes of his kindred  radiant as a young Apollo, brave as a mortal Hercules.</p>
<p>Those things which the ignorant heart has at some  time so passionately desired are apt to be granted when the desire has grown  somewhat cold and dead. Thus it was with the ambition of Fran&ccedil;ois Lenoble. He  lived to see the lands of C&ocirc;tenoir and Beaubocage united in the person of his  grandson, who married Clarice, the only surviving child of M. and Madame de  N&eacute;rague. Two sons and a daughter had been born at C&ocirc;tenoir; but the sons  withered and faded in early boyhood, and even the daughter, though considered a  flourishing plant in that poor garden of weakling blossoms, was but a fragile  creature.</p>
<p>The old people at Beaubocage survived the seigneur  and ch&acirc;telaine of C&ocirc;tenoir by some years, and survived also the fiery  lieutenant, who fell in Algeria without having attained his captaincy, or added  any military renown to the good old name of de N&eacute;rague in his own magnificent  person.</p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois saw his grandson established at C&ocirc;tenoir  before he died. He expired with his hand in that of Gustave, whom, in the  half-consciousness of that last hour, he mistook for the son he had disowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What door was that that shut?&rdquo; he asked, in an  eager whisper. &ldquo;Who said I turned my son out of doors &mdash; my only son? It&rsquo;s  false! I couldn&rsquo;t have done it! Hark! there&rsquo;s the door shutting again! It  sounds like the door of a tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this he dozed a little, and woke with a smile  on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been dreaming of thy father, Gustave,&rdquo; he  said calmly. &ldquo;I thought that I saw him with a light shining in his face, and  that he kissed and forgave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the end. The faithful wife was not slow to  follow her husband to the grave, and there was now only a placid maiden lady at  Beaubocage, Mademoiselle Cydalise Lenoble, whom everyone within ten leagues of  Vevinord knew and loved, &mdash; a lay abbess, a Sister of Mercy in all save the robes;  a tender creature, who lived only to do good.</p>
<p>Ten years passed, and M. Lenoble of C&ocirc;tenoir was a  widower with two fair young daughters at a convent school on the outskirts of  Vevinord, and a boisterous son at an academy in Rouen. Gustave had never followed  any profession; the lands of Beaubocage secured him a competence, so prudently  had the small estate been managed by the kindred who adored him. His marriage  had given him fortune. He had no need of trade or profession. His life was laid  out for him like a prim Dutch flower-garden. He was to live at C&ocirc;tenoir, and  look after his estate, and smoke his pipe, as Baron Frehlter had done, and be a  good husband to his wife, a kind father to his children. This latter part of  his duty came natural to M. Lenoble. It was not in him to be otherwise than  kind to women and children. His invalid wife praised him as a model of marital  perfection. It was Gustave who wheeled her sofa from one room to another,  Gustave who prepared her medicines, Gustave whose careful hands adjusted  curtains and <em>porti&egrave;res</em>. The poor  woman lived and died believing herself the happiest of wives. She mistook  kindness for love.</p>
<p>M. Lenoble bore his wife&rsquo;s demise with Christian  calmness. He was sorry that the fragile creature should have been taken so  early from the pleasant home that was hers by right, but of passionate grief,  or dreary sense of irreparable loss, there was none in that manly heart. There  were times when the widower reproached himself for this want of feeling; but in  very truth Madame Lenoble, <em>jeune</em>, had  lived and died a nonentity. Her departure left no empty place; even her  children scarcely missed her. The father was all-in-all.</p>
<p>Gustave had married at twenty years of age. He was  twenty-nine when his wife died. His eldest daughter, Clarice, eight; his  second, Madelon, seven; the boy, a spoilt young dog of five, not yet despatched  to the great school at Rouen.</p>
<p>But in &rsquo;65 Mademoiselle Clarice was fifteen years  of age, and a very charming performer on the pianoforte, as the good nuns at the  Convent of the Sacred Heart, at Vevinord, told the father. Mademoiselle Madelon  was looking forward to her fourteenth anniversary, and she, too, was a very  pretty pianist, and altogether a young prodigy of learning and goodness, as the  nuns told the master of C&ocirc;tenoir. The demoiselles of C&ocirc;tenoir stood high in the  estimation of pupils and mistress; they were a kind of noblesse; and the  simple-minded superioress spoke of these young persons with some pride when she  described her establishment to a stranger. It was a very comfortable little  colony, a small world enclosed by high walls. The good mothers who taught and  cherished the children were for the greater part ladies of superior and even  exalted station; and there was a gentleness, a tenderness, in their care for  these young lambs not always to be insured by the payment of an annual stipend.  It must be confessed that the young lambs were apt to be troublesome, and  required a good deal of watching. To the eye of the philosopher that convent  school would have afforded scope for curious study; for it is singular to  discover what exceptional vices the youthful mind can develop from its inner  consciousness, in homes as pure as this. There were black sheep even in the  convent of the Sacr&eacute; Coeur, damsels marked with a sign that meant &ldquo;dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happily for Gustave Lenoble, his daughters were  amongst the brightest and the purest of those girl-graduates. They gave him no  trouble, except when they asked him for a home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so dull and dreary at C&ocirc;tenoir, papa,&rdquo;  they said, &ldquo;though you are always so kind. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like home.  Beaubocage is more home-like. At C&ocirc;tenoir, when you are out, there is no one to  talk to; and we have no little parties, no excursions into the country, none of  those pleasures which the other girls tell us they have during the holidays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the gist of the lamentations of  Mademoiselles Clarice and Madelon; and the father knew not how to supply the  mysterious something which was wanting to make C&ocirc;tenoir a pleasant home. The  girls could complain of no restraint, or pine for no indulgence, since their  father was always prompt to gratify every whim. But there was some element of  happiness wanting, nevertheless; and M. Lenoble perceived that it was so. The  life at C&ocirc;tenoir was desultory, straggling; an existence of perpetual dawdling;  a life of shreds and patches, half-formed resolutions, projects begun and  broken off in the middle. The good genius, the household angel, order, was  wanting in that mansion. There was waste, dirt, destruction of all kinds, in  the rambling old ch&acirc;teau; old servants, too weak or too lazy to work; old  tradesmen, presuming on old-established habits of imposition, unquestioned so  long as to have become a right &mdash; for the feudal system of fine and forfeiture has  only changed hands. The power still flourishes, only it is the villein who  takes tithe of his lord.</p>
<p>The servants at C&ocirc;tenoir had gone their own ways  with but little interference since the death of Madame de N&eacute;rague, which  occurred two years before that of her daughter, Clarice Lenoble. Poor invalid  Clarice had been quite unable to superintend her household; and since her death  Mademoiselle Cydalise had been too feeble of health to assume any authority in  her nephew&rsquo;s establishment, even if the household of C&ocirc;tenoir would have  submitted to interference from Beaubocage, which in all likelihood they would  not.</p>
<p>Thus it happened that things had taken their own  course at the ch&acirc;teau, and the course had been somewhat erratic. There is  nothing so costly as muddle, and Gustave Lenoble had of late begun to perceive  that he had the maximum of expense with the minimum of comfort. Meanwhile the  kind old aunt at Beaubocage gave her nieces much valuable advice against the  time when they should be old enough to assume the management of their father&rsquo;s  house. The sweet unselfish lady of Beaubocage had indeed undergone hard  experience in the acquirement of the domestic art. Heaven and her own memory  alone recorded those scrapings and pinchings and nice calculations of morsels by  which she had contrived to save a few pounds for her outcast brother. Such  sordid economics show but poorly on earth; but it is probable that in the mass  of documentary evidence which goes before the Great Judge, Mademoiselle  Lenoble&rsquo;s account-book will be placed on the right side.</p>
<h1 align="center"><em><a name="BookTheThird"></a>Book The Third<br>
  The Horatiad</em></h1>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  Chiefly Retrospective</h2>
<p>Captain Paget went his way to Rouen in a placid but  not an exulting mood, after parting with his young friend Valentine Hawkehurst  at the London Bridge terminus of the Brighton line. He was setting out upon an  adventure wild and impracticable as the quest of Jason and his Argonauts; and  this gallant captain was a carpet-knight, sufficiently adventurous and  audacious in the diplomatic crusades of society, but in nowise eager to hazard  his life on tented field and in thick press of war. If the Fates had allowed  the accomplished Horatio to choose his own destiny, he would have elected to  live in the immediate neighbourhood of St. James&rsquo;s Street, from the first day  to the last of the London season, and to dine artistically and discreetly at  one of those older and more exclusive clubs dear and familiar to him from the  bright years of his youth. He was by nature a <em>fl&acirc;neur</em>, a gossip, a lover of expensive luxuries and frivolous  pleasures. He was not only incapable of a high thought himself, but was an  unbeliever in the possibility of high thoughts or noble principles in the world  he lived in. He measured the universe by that narrow scrap of tape which was  the span of his own littleness. To him C&aelig;sar was an imperial brigand, Cicero a  hypocritical agitator. To him all great warriors were greedy time-servers like  John Churchill; all statesmen plausible placemen; all reformers self-seeking  pretenders. Nor did Captain Paget wish that it should be otherwise. In his  ideal republic, unselfishness and earnestness would have rendered a man rather  a nuisance than otherwise. With the vices of his fellow-men the diplomatic  Horatio was fully competent to deal; but some of his most subtle combinations  on the chess-board of life would have been checkmated by an unexpected  encounter with intractable virtue.</p>
<p>The necessity of living was the paramount  consideration to which this gentleman had given his mind from the time when he  found himself a popular subaltern in a crack regiment, admired for his easy  manners and good looks, respected by meaner men for his good blood, and rich in  everything except that vulgar dross without which the life of West-end London  is so hollow a delusion, so bitter a comedy of mean shifts and lying devices.</p>
<p>That freebooter of civilization, the man who lives  by his wits, is subject to strange fluctuations from prosperity to adversity.  He is the miner or gold-digger of civilized life; and as there are times when  his pickaxe strikes suddenly on a rich lode, so there are dreary intervals in  which his spade turns up nothing but valueless clay, and the end of each day&rsquo;s  work leaves him with no better evidence of his wasted labour than the aching  limbs which he drags at nightfall to his dismal shanty.</p>
<p>For some months Captain Paget had found Philip  Sheldon a very useful acquaintance. The stockbroker had been the secret  inaugurator of two or three joint-stock companies, though figuring to the outer  world only as director; and in the getting-up of these companies Horatio had  been a useful instrument, and had received liberal payment for his labours.  Unhappily, so serene an occupation as promoting cannot go on for ever; or  rather, cannot remain for ever in the same hands. The human mind is naturally  imitative, and the plagiarisms of commerce are infinitely more audacious than  the small larcenies of literature. The joint-stock company market became day by  day more crowded. No sooner did Philip Sheldon float the Non-destructive  Laundry Company, the admirable organization of which would offer a guarantee  against the use of chloride of lime and other destructive agencies in the  wash-tub, than a rival power launched a colourable imitation thereof, in the  Union-is-Strength Domestic Lavatory Company, with a professor of chemistry  specially retained as inspector of wash-tubs. Thus it was that, after the  profitable ripening of three such schemes, Mr. Sheldon deemed it advisable to  retire from the field, and await a fitter time for the further exercise of his  commercial genius.</p>
<p>Captain Paget&rsquo;s relations with the stockbroker did  not, however, terminate with the cessation of his labours as secretary,  jack-of-all-trades, and promoter. Having found him, so far, clever, and to all  appearance trustworthy &mdash; and this was an important point, for no man so much  needs honourable service as a rogue &mdash; Philip Sheldon determined upon confiding  to Horatio the conduct of a more delicate business than anything purely  commercial. After that discovery of the telegraphic message sent by his brother  George to Valentine Hawkehurst, and the further discovery of the advertisement  relating to the unclaimed wealth of the lately deceased John Haygarth, Mr.  Sheldon lost no time in organizing his plans for his own aggrandizement at the  expense of his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George refused to let me in for a share of chances  when I showed myself willing to help him,&rdquo; thought Philip. &ldquo;He may discover  by-and-by that I have contrived to let myself into his secrets; and that he  might have played a better game by consenting to a partnership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A life devoted to his own interests, and a  consistent habit of selfishness, had rendered Mr. Sheldon, of the Lawn,  Bayswater, and Stags Court, City, very quick of apprehension in all matters  connected, immediately or remotely, with the making of money. The broken  sentences of the telegram betrayed by the blotting-pad told him a great deal.  They told him that there was a certain Goodge, in the town of Ullerton, who  possessed letters so valuable to George Sheldon, as to be bought by his agent  Valentine Hawkehurst. Letters for which Sheldon was willing to give money must  needs be of considerable importance, since money was a very scarce commodity  with that hunter of unconscious heirs-at-law. Again, a transaction which required  the use of so expensive a medium as the electric telegraph rather than the  penny post, might be fairly supposed a transaction of some moment. The letters  in question might relate to some other estate than that of John Haygarth, for  it was quite possible that the schemer of Gray&rsquo;s Inn had other irons in the  fire. But this was a question of no moment to Philip Sheldon.</p>
<p>If the letters &mdash; or the information contained  therein &mdash; were likely to be useful to George, they might be useful to him. If  George found it worth his while to employ an agent at Ullerton, why should not  he (Philip) have his agent in the same town? The pecuniary risk, which might be  a serious affair to George, was child&rsquo;s play for Philip, who had always plenty  of money, or, at any rate, the command of money. The whole business of  heir-at-law hunting seemed to the stockbroker a very vague and shadowy piece of  work, as compared to the kind of speculation that was familiar to him; but he  knew that men had made money in such a manner, and any business by which money  could be made, was interesting to him. Beyond this, the notion of cutting the  ground from under his brother&rsquo;s feet had a certain attraction for him. George&rsquo;s  manner to him had been somewhat offensive to him on more than one occasion since  &mdash; well, since Tom Halliday&rsquo;s death. Mr. Sheldon had borne that offensiveness in  mind, with the determination to &ldquo;take it out of&rdquo; his brother on the earliest  opportunity.</p>
<p>It seemed as if the opportunity had arrived, and  Philip was not one of those men who wait shivering on the shore when Fortune&rsquo;s  tide is at the flood. Mr. Sheldon launched his bark upon the rising waters, and  within two hours of his discovery in the telegraph-office was closeted with  Horatio Paget in the little parlour in Omega Street, making arrangements for  the Captain&rsquo;s journey to Ullerton.</p>
<p>That Horatio was the right man for the work he  wanted done, Mr. Sheldon had been quick to perceive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows Hawkehurst, and will be able to reckon up  any manoeuvres of his better than a stranger; and is, I think, altogether as  deep an old gentleman as one could hope to meet with, barring <em>the</em> traditional gentleman who did odd  jobs for Dr. Faustus,&rdquo; the stockbroker said to himself, as his hansom sped  along Park Lane on its way to Chelsea. The eagerness with which Captain Paget  took up the idea of this business was very agreeable to his patron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an affair in which success hinges on  time,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon; &ldquo;so, if you mean to go in for the business, you must  start for Ullerton by the two o&rsquo;clock express. You&rsquo;ll have just time to throw  your razors and a clean shirt into a carpet-bag while I talk to you. I&rsquo;ve got a  cab outside, and a good one, that will take you to Euston Square in half an  hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain showed himself prompt in action. His bedchamber  was a small apartment at the back of the parlour, and here he packed his bag  while conversing with his employer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you get upon the ground in time, you may obtain  a look at the letters before they are handed over to Hawkehurst, or you may  outbid him for them,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon; &ldquo;but remember, whatever you do must be  so done as to keep Hawkehurst and George completely in the dark as to our  proceedings. If once they find out we are on their track, our chances will be  gone, for they have got the information and we haven&rsquo;t; and it&rsquo;s only by  following close in their footsteps we can hope to do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is understood,&rdquo; replied the Captain, stooping  over his bag; &ldquo;I shall keep myself as close as possible, you may depend upon  it. And it shan&rsquo;t be my fault if Valentine sees me or hears of me. I shall want  money, by the bye; for one can&rsquo;t stir a step in this sort of affair without  ready cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite aware of that. I stopped at the  West-end branch of the Unitas and cashed a cheque for forty pounds. You can do  a good deal in the way of bribery for forty pounds, in such a place as  Ullerton. What you have to do is to keep your eye on Hawkehurst, and follow up  every channel of information that he opens for you. He has the clue to the  labyrinth, remember, the reel of cotton, or whatever it was, that the young  woman gave that Roman fellow. All you have to do is to get hold of it, and  follow your leader.&rdquo; continued Philip, with his watch in his hand. &ldquo;This  business of the letters will be sharp work, for the chances are against us  here, as it&rsquo;s more than likely the papers will have changed hands before you  can get to Ullerton. But if you can&rsquo;t buy the letters, you may buy the  information contained in them, and that is the next best thing. Your first move  will be to ferret out this man Goodge. Everybody knows everybody else in such a  place as Ullerton, large and busy as the town is, and you won&rsquo;t find that  difficult. When you see Goodge, you&rsquo;ll know how to deal with him. The mode and  manner of your dealing I leave to yourself. You are a man of the world, and  will know how to manipulate the gentleman, whoever he may be. And now lock your  bag and cut downstairs as fast as you can. Time&rsquo;s up. Here&rsquo;s your money &mdash; three  tens, two fives. Good day.&rdquo;</p>

  Epistolary</h2>
<p class="note"><em>FROM HORATIO  PAGET to Philip Sheldon</em>.</p>
<p class="note">Royal Hotel, Ullerton, Oct. 7, 186 &mdash; .</p>
<p class="note">My dear sir, &mdash; I arrived here last evening just in  time to run against Hawkehurst on the platform, which was rather a provoking  encounter at the outset. He went further north by the same train that brought  me from London. This train only stops at three places after Ullerton &mdash;  Slowport, Black Harbour, and Manchester; and I shall take pains to discover  which of these towns was Hawkehurst&rsquo;s destination. There was one satisfaction  in seeing his departure by this train, inasmuch as it assured me that I had the  ground clear for my own operations.</p>
<p class="note">I had no difficulty in discovering the whereabouts  of Goodge &mdash; <em>the</em> Goodge we want &mdash; and  at eight o&rsquo;clock was comfortably seated in that gentleman&rsquo;s parlour, talking  over the affair of the letters. Tolerably quick work, I think you will allow,  my dear sir, for a man whose years have fallen into the sere and yellow leaf.</p>
<p class="note">Mr. Goodge is a Methodist parson &mdash; a class of  person I have always detested. I found him peculiarly amenable to monetary  influence. I need scarcely tell you that I was careful to conceal my identity  from this person. I made so bold as to borrow the cognomen of an  old-established firm of solicitors in the Fields, and took a somewhat high tone  throughout the interview. I informed Mr. Goodge that the young man who had  called on him with reference to certain letters connected with the affairs of  the Haygarth family &mdash; and I perceived from Mr. Goodge&rsquo;s face that we were on  the right track &mdash; was a person of disreputable character, engaged in an  underhand transaction calculated to injure a respected client of our house. I  saw that the words &ldquo;house&rdquo; and &ldquo;our&rdquo; were talismanic in their effect upon the  Methodist parson. You see, my dear sir, there is no one can manage this sort of  thing so well as a gentleman. It comes natural to him. Your vulgar diplomatist  seldom knows how to begin, and never knows when to stop. Here I had this  low-bred Methodist fellow impressed by the idea of my individual and collective  importance after five minutes&rsquo; conversation. &ldquo;But this comes too near the  praising of myself; therefore hear other things,&rdquo; as the bard observes.</p>
<p class="note">A very little further conversation rendered Mr.  Goodge malleable. I found that Hawkehurst had approached him in the character  of your brother&rsquo;s articled clerk, but under his own proper name. This is one  point gained, since it assures me that Valentine is not skulking here under a  feigned name; and will enable me to shape my future inquiries about him  accordingly. I also ascertained Hawkehurst&rsquo;s whereabouts when in Ullerton. He  stays at a low commercial house called the Black Swan. It appears that the man  Goodge possesses a packet of letters written by a certain Mrs. Rebecca  Haygarth, wife of one Matthew Haygarth. In what relationship this Matthew may  stand to the intestate is to be discovered. It is evident he is an important  link in the chain, or your brother would not want the letters. I need not  trouble you with our conversation in detail. In gross it amounted to this: Mr.  Goodge had pledged himself to hand over Mrs. Haygarth&rsquo;s letters, forty or so in  number, to Hawkehurst in consideration of twenty pounds. They would have been  already in Hawkehurst&rsquo;s possession, if Mr. Goodge had not objected to part with  them except for ready money. In consideration of a payment of twenty pounds  from me, he was willing to let me read all the letters, and select any ten I  pleased to take. This bargain was not arrived at without considerable  discussion, but it certainly struck me as a good one.</p>
<p class="note">I opened the packet of papers then and there, and  sat up until six o&rsquo;clock the next morning, reading Mrs. Haygarth&rsquo;s letters in  Mr. Goodge&rsquo;s parlour. Very fatiguing occupation for a man of my years. Mr.  Goodge&rsquo;s hospitality began and ended in a cup of coffee. Such coffee! and I  remember the mocha I used to get at Arthur&rsquo;s thirty years ago, &mdash; a Promethean  beverage, that illumined the dullest smoking-room bore with a flash of wit or a  glimmer of wisdom.</p>
<p class="note">I enclose the ten letters which I have selected.  They appear to me to tell the history of Mrs. Haygarth and her husband pretty  plainly; but there is evidently something mysterious lurking behind the  commonplace existence of the husband. That is a matter for future  consideration. All I have to do in the present is to keep you as well informed  as your brother. It may strike you that the letters I forward herewith, which  are certainly the cream of the correspondence, and the notes I have made from  the remaining letters, are scarcely worth the money paid for them. In reply to  such an objection, I can only say that you get more for <em>your</em> money than your brother George will get for his.</p>
<p class="note">The hotel at which I have taken up my quarters is  but a few paces from the commoner establishment where Hawkehurst is stopping.  He is to call on Goodge for the letters to-day; so his excursion will be of  brief duration. I find that the name of Haygarth is not unknown in this town,  as there are a family of Judsons, some of whom call themselves Haygarth Judson.  I intend inviting my landlord &mdash; a very superior person for his station &mdash; to  discuss a bottle of wine with me after my chop this evening, and hope to obtain  some information from him. In the meantime I shall keep myself close. It is of  vital consequence that I should remain unseen by Hawkehurst. I do not believe  he saw me on the platform last night, though we were as close to each other as  we well could be.</p>
<p class="note">Let me know what you think of the letters, and  believe me to be, my dear sir, very faithfully yours,</p>
<p class="note">H. N. C.  PAGET</p>

<p class="note">Bayswater, Oct. 8,186-.</p>
<p class="note">DEAR PAGET, &mdash; The letters are mysterious, and I  don&rsquo;t see my way to getting much good out of them, but heartily approve your  management of matters, and give you <em>carte  blanche</em> to proceed, according to your own lights.</p>

<p class="note"><em>Horatio Paget  to Philip Sheldon</em>.</p>
<p class="note">Royal Hotel, Oct. 9, 186-.</p>
<p class="note">MY DEAR SIR, &mdash; The cultivation of my landlord has  been very profitable. The house is the oldest in the town, and the business has  descended in a direct line from father to son since the time of George the  Second. This man&rsquo;s grandfather entertained the officers of William Duke of  Cumberland, honoured by his contemporaries with the soubriquet of Billy the  Butcher, during the &ldquo;forty-five.&rdquo; I had to listen to and applaud a good many  stories about Billy the Butcher before I could lead my landlord round to the  subject of the Haygarths. But he was not more prosy than many men I have met at  dinner-parties in the days when the highest circles in the land were open to  your humble servant.</p>
<p class="note">The Haygarth family, of which the intestate John  Haygarth was the last male descendant, were for a long period inhabitants of  this town, and obtained their wealth by trading as grocers and general dealers  in a shop not three hundred yards from the room in which I write. The building  is still standing, and a curious, old-fashioned-looking place it is. The last  of the Haygarths who carried on business therein was one Jonathan, whose son  Matthew was the father of that Reverend John Haygarth, lately deceased,  intestate. You will thus perceive that the letters I sent you are of much  importance, as they relate solely to this Matthew, father of our intestate.</p>
<p class="note">My next inquiries related to the Judson family, who  are, it appears, descended from the issue of a certain Ruth Haygarth&rsquo;s marriage  with one Peter Judson. This Ruth Haygarth was the only sister of the Matthew  alluded to in the letters, and therefore was aunt of the intestate. It would  herefrom appear that in this Judson family we must naturally look for the  rightful claimant to the fortune of the deceased John Haygarth. Possessed of  this conviction, I proceeded to interrogate my landlord very cautiously as to  the status, &amp;c. of the Judson family, and amongst other questions, asked  him with a complete assumption of indifference, whether he had ever heard that  the Judsons expected to inherit property from any branch of the Haygarth  family.</p>
<p class="note">This careless interrogatory produced information  of, as I imagine, a very valuable character. A certain Theodore Judson,  attorney of this town, calls himself heir-at-law to the Haygarth estates; but  before he can establish his claim, this Theodore must produce evidence of the  demise, without heirs, of one Peter Judson, eldest surviving grandson of Ruth  Haygarth&rsquo;s eldest son, a scamp and ne&rsquo;er-do-well &mdash; if living, supposed to be  somewhere in India, where he went, as supercargo to a merchant vessel about,  the year &rsquo;41 &mdash; who stands prior to Theodore Judson in the succession. I  conclude that the said Theodore, who, as a lawyer, is likely to do things <em>secundum artem</em>, is doing his <em>possible</em> to obtain the necessary  evidence; but in the meantime he is at a dead lock, and the whole affair  appears to be in a charming condition for speculative interference. I opine,  therefore, that your brother really has hit upon a good thing this time; and my  only wonder is, that instead of allowing his agent, Hawkehurst, to waste his  time hunting up old letters of Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s (to all appearance valueless  as documentary evidence), he does not send Valentine to India to hunt for Peter  Judson, who, if living, is the rightful heir to the intestate&rsquo;s fortune, and  who, as a reckless extravagant fellow, would be likely to make very liberal  terms with any one who offered to procure him a large lump of money.</p>
<p class="note">I confess that I am quite at a loss to understand  why your brother George does not take this very obvious course, and why  Valentine potters about in this neighbourhood, when a gold mine is waiting to  be <em>exploit&eacute;</em> on the other side.</p>
<p class="note">I shall be very glad to have your views upon this  subject, for at the present moment I am fain to acknowledge that I do not see  my way to taking any further steps in this business, unless by commencing a  search for the missing Peter.</p>
<p class="note">I am, my dear Sir, very truly yours,</p>

<p class="note">Bayswater, Oct. 10, 186 &mdash; .</p>
<p class="note">DEAR PAGET, &mdash; When so old a stager as G. S. does  not take the obvious course, the inference is that there is a better course to  be taken &mdash; <em>not</em> obvious to the  uninitiated.</p>
<p class="note">You have done very well so far, but the information  you have obtained from your landlord is only such information as any one else  may obtain from the current gossip of Ullerton. You haven&rsquo;t yet got to the <em>dessous des cartes</em>. Remember what I told  you in London. G. S. <em>has</em> the clue to  this labyrinth; and what you have to do is to hold on to the coat-tails (in a  figurative sense) of his agent, V. H.</p>
<p class="note">Don&rsquo;t put your trust in prosy old landlords, but  continue to set a watch upon that young man, and follow up his trail as you did  in the matter of the letters.</p>
<p class="note">If the Peter Judson who went to India  three-and-twenty years ago were the right man to follow, G.S. would scarcely  give twenty pounds for the letters of Mrs. Matthew Haygarth. It appears to me  that G. must be looking for an heir on the Haygarth side of the house; and if  so, rely upon it he has his reasons. Don&rsquo;t bewilder yourself by trying to  theorize, but get to the bottom of G.&rsquo;s theory.</p>

<p class="note">Royal Hotel, Oct. 12, 186. &mdash;</p>
<p class="note">MY DEAR SIR, &mdash; Considering the advice contained in  your last very good, I lost no time in acting upon it. I need hardly tell you,  that to employ the services of a hired spy, and to degrade myself in some sort  to the level of a private inquirer, was somewhat revolting to a man, who, in  the decadence of his fortunes, has ever striven to place some limit on the  outrages which that hard taskmaster, poverty, may have from time to time  compelled him to inflict upon his self-respect. But in the furtherance of a  cause which I conclude is in no manner dishonourable, since an unclaimed  heritage must needs be a prize open to all, I submitted to this temporary  degradation of my higher feelings, and I trust that when the time arrives for  the settlement of any pecuniary consideration which I am to derive from these  irksome and uncongenial labours, my wounded self-respect may not be omitted  from the reckoning. The above exordium may appear to you tedious, but it is  only just to myself to remind you that you are not dealing with a vulgar  hireling. My first step, after duly meditating your suggestions, was to find a  fitting watch for the movements of Hawkehurst. I opined that the best person to  play the spy would be that class of man whose existence seems for the most part  devoted to the lounging at street corners, the chewing of straw, and that  desultory kind of industry known in the <em>patois</em> of this race as &ldquo;fetching errands.&rdquo; This is the man, or boy, who starts up from  the pavement (as through a trap-door in the flags) whenever one alights from or  would enter any kind of vehicle. Unbidden, unrequired, and obnoxious, the  creature arises, and opens a door, or lays some rag of his wretched attire on a  muddy wheel, and then whines, piteous, for a copper. Such a man, or such a boy,  I felt convinced must exist among the hangers-on of the Royal Hotel; nor was I  mistaken. On inquiring for a handy lad, capable of attending upon my needs at  all hours in the day, and not a servant in the hotel, but a person who would be  wholly at my own disposal, I was informed that the Boots had a younger brother  who was skilled in the fetching of errands, and who would be happy to wait upon  me for a very reasonable remuneration, or in the words of the waiter himself,  would be ready to leave it &mdash; i.e. the remuneration &mdash; to my own generosity. I  know that there are no people who expect so much as those who leave the  assessment of their claims to your own generosity; but as I wanted good  service, I was prepared to pay well. The younger Boots made his appearance in  due course &mdash; a sharp young fellow enough &mdash; and I forthwith made him my slave by  the promise of five shillings a day for every day in which I should require his  services. I then told him that it was my misfortune to own &mdash; with a strong  inclination to disown &mdash; a reprobate nephew, now an inhabitant of that very  town. This nephew, I had reason to believe, was going at a very rapid rate to  the dogs; but my affectionate feelings would not allow him to consummate his  own destruction without one last effort to reclaim him. I had therefore  followed him to Ullerton, whither I believed him to be led by the worst  possible motives; and having done so, my next business was to keep myself  informed of his whereabouts.</p>
<p class="note">Seeing that the younger Boots accepted these  statements with unquestioning faith, I went on to inquire whether he felt  himself equal to the delicate duty of hanging about the yard of the Black Swan,  and watching the doors of exit from that hotel, with a view to following my  recreant nephew wherever he might go, even if considerably beyond the limits of  Ullerton. I saw that the lad&rsquo;s intelligence was likely to be equal to this  transaction, unless there should arise any difficult or complicated position by  reason of the suspicion of Hawkehurst, or other mischance. &ldquo;Do you think you  can watch the gentleman without being observed?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty well sure  I can, sir,&rdquo; answered the boy, who is of an enterprising, and indeed audacious,  temper. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will go to the Black Swan Inn. Hawkehurst is  the name by which my nephew is known there, and it will be your duty to find  him out.&rdquo; I gave the boy a minute account of Valentine&rsquo;s appearance, and other  instructions with which I need not trouble you. I further furnished him with  money, so that he might be able to follow Hawkehurst by rail, or any other mode  of conveyance, if necessary; and then despatched him, with an order to come  back to me when he had seen our man safely lodged in the Black Swan after his  day&rsquo;s perambulations. &ldquo;And if he shouldn&rsquo;t go out at all?&rdquo; suggested the lad.  &ldquo;In that case you must stick to your post till nightfall, and pick up all the  information you can about my unfortunate nephew from the hangers-on of the  hotel,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I suppose you know some one at the Black Swan?&rdquo; The boy  informed me, in his untutored language, that he knew &ldquo;a&rsquo;most all of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; and  thereupon departed.</p>
<p class="note">At nine o&rsquo;clock at night he again appeared before  me, big with the importance of his day&rsquo;s work. He had seen my nephew issue  forth from the Black Swan within an hour of leaving my presence, and had  followed him, first to Mr. William Judson&rsquo;s in Ferrygate, where he waited and  hung about nearly an hour, keeping himself well out of view round the corner of  Chalkin Street, a turning close to Mr. Judson&rsquo;s house. After leaving this  gentleman&rsquo;s house, my renegade nephew had proceeded &mdash; carrying a letter in his  hand, and walking as if in very good spirits (but that fellow Hawkehurst would  walk to the gallows in good spirits) &mdash; to the Lancaster Road, where he was  admitted into Lochiel Villa, a house belonging, as my Mercury ascertained from  a passing baker&rsquo;s boy, to Miss Judson, sister of the William Judson of Ferrygate.  You will perceive that this town appears to teem with the Judson family. My  messenger, with praiseworthy art, contrived to engage in a game of tip-cat  (what, I wonder, <em>is</em> a tip-cat?) with  some vagrant boys disporting themselves in the roadway, within view of Miss  Judson&rsquo;s house. Hence, after the lapse of more than an hour, Boots-Mercury  beheld my recreant relative emerge, and from this point followed him &mdash; always  with extreme caution &mdash; back to the Black Swan. Here he hung about the yard,  favoured by his close acquaintance with the ostler, until eight o&rsquo;clock in the  evening, no event of the smallest importance occurring during all those hours.  But at eight there arrived a young woman, with a packet from Miss Judson to Mr.  Hawkehurst. The packet was small, and was sealed with red wax. This was all my  Mercury could ascertain respecting it; but this was something.</p>
<p class="note">I at once divined that this packet must needs  contain letters. I asked myself whether those letters or papers had been sold  to Hawkehurst, or only lent to him, and I immediately concluded that they could  only have been lent. It was all very well for Goodge, the Methodist parson, to  traffic in the epistles of Mrs. Matthew Haygarth, but it was to the last degree  unlikely that a well-to-do maiden lady would part with family letters or papers  for any pecuniary consideration whatever. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;the  documents have been lent, and will have to be returned;&rdquo; and thereupon I laid  my plans for the next day&rsquo;s campaign, with a view to obtaining a peep at those  letters, by fair means or foul. I told the boy to be at his post in the inn  yard early the next morning, and if my nephew did not leave the inn, my agent  was to ascertain what he was doing, and to bring me word thereof. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell  you what it is, Boots,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I have reason to believe that sadly disposed  nephew of mine has some wicked intention with regard to Miss Judson, who is  nearly related to a young lady with whom that unprincipled young man is, or  pretends to be, in love; and I very much fear that he means to send her some  letters, written by this foolish niece of hers to my more foolish nephew, and  eminently calculated to wound the good lady&rsquo;s feelings. Now, in order to  prevent this very shameful conduct on his part, I want to intercept any packet  or letter which that mistaken youth may send to Miss Judson. Do you feel  yourself capable of getting hold of such a packet, on consideration of a bonus  of half-a-sovereign in addition to the five shillings per diem already agreed  upon?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">This, in more direct and vulgar phraseology, was  what I said to the boy; and the boy departed, after pledging himself to bring  me any packet which Hawkehurst might despatch from the Swan Inn. The only fear  was that Hawkehurst might carry the packet himself, and this contingency  appeared unpleasantly probable.</p>
<p class="note">Fortune favoured us. My reprobate nephew was too  ill to go out. He intrusted Miss Hudson&rsquo;s packet to his waiter, the waiter  confided it to the Boots, the Boots resigned the responsibility in favour of my  boy Mercury, who kindly offered to save that functionary the trouble of a walk  to the Lancaster Road.</p>
<p class="note">At eleven A.M. the packet was in my hands. I have  devoted the best part of to-day to the contents of this packet. They consist of  letters written by Matthew Haygarth, and distinguished by a most abominable  orthography; but I remember my own father&rsquo;s epistolary composition to have been  somewhat deficient in this respect; nor is it singular that the humble citizen  should have been a poor hand at spelling in an age when royal personages  indulged in a phonetic style of orthography which would provoke the laughter of  a modern charity-boy. That the pretender to the crown of England should murder  the two languages in which he wrote seems a small thing; but that Frederick the  Great, the most accomplished of princes, bosom-friend of Voltaire, and sworn  patron of the literati, should not have been able to spell, is a matter for  some astonishment. I could but remember this fact, as I perused the epistles of  Matthew Haygarth. I felt that these letters had in all probability been  carefully numbered by the lady to whom they belong, and that to tamper with  them to any serious extent might be dangerous. I have therefore only ventured  to retain one insignificant scrawl as an example of Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s  caligraphy and signature. From the rest I have taken copious notes. It appears  to me that these letters relate to some <em>liaison</em> of the gentleman&rsquo;s youth; though I am fain to confess myself surprised to  discover that, even in a period notorious for looseness of morals, a man should  enter into such details in a correspondence with his sister. <em>Autres temps, autres moeurs</em>. I have  selected my extracts with great care, and hope that you may be able to make  more use of them than I can at present imagine possible. I shall post this  letter and enclosure with my own hands, though in order to do so I must pass  the Black Swan. I shall despatch my messenger to Lochiel Villa, with Miss  Judson&rsquo;s packet, under cover of the darkness.</p>
<p class="note">In much haste, to catch the London mail,</p>
<p class="note">Truly yours, H.N.C.P.</p>

<p>Captain Paget returned to town, mystified by that  sudden summons from his patron, and eager to know what new aspect of affairs  rendered his further presence in Ullerton useless or undesirable.</p>
<p>Horatio arrived in the great city half-a-dozen  hours before his sometime prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and was comfortably installed when Valentine  returned to those lodgings in Omega Street, Chelsea, which the two men occupied  in common.</p>
<p>Captain Paget went into the City to see Philip  Sheldon on the day of his return, but did not succeed in finding the  stockbroker. The evening&rsquo;s post brought him a letter from Philip, appointing an  interview at Bayswater, at three o&rsquo;clock on the following day &mdash; the day after  Valentine&rsquo;s return from Ullerton.</p>
<p>Punctual to the moment appointed by this letter,  Captain Paget appeared at the Lawn on the following day. He was ushered into  Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s study, where he found that gentleman awaiting him, grave and  meditative of mood, but friendly, and indeed cordial, in his manner to the  returning traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Paget, sit down; I am delighted to see  you. Your trip has made you look five years younger, by Jove! I was sorry to  find you had called while I was out, and had waited for me upwards of an hour  yesterday. I have a good deal of worry on my shoulders just now; commerce is  all worry, you know. The Marquis of Lambeth has come into the market and bought  up two-thirds of the Astrakhan Grand Trunk debenture bonds, just as our house  had speculated for the fall. And since it has got wind that the Marquis is  sweet upon the concern, the bonds are going up like a skyrocket. Such is life.  I thought we had better have our little talk here; it&rsquo;s quieter than in the  City. Have some sherry and soda; you like that Manzanilla of mine, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the hospitable Philip rang the bell, without  thinking it necessary to wait for his guest&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>There was a cordiality, a conciliating friendliness  about the stockbroker&rsquo;s manner which Horatio Paget did not like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too civil by half,&rdquo; the Captain said to  himself; &ldquo;he means to do me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now about this Ullerton business,&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon  began, when the wine and soda-water had been brought, and a tall tumbler of  that refreshing compound filled for the Captain; &ldquo;you have really managed  matters admirably. I cannot too much applaud your diplomatic tact. You would  have put a what&rsquo;s-his-name &mdash; that fellow of Napoleon&rsquo;s &mdash; to the blush by your  management of the whole business. But, unfortunately, when it&rsquo;s all done it  comes to nothing; the whole affair is evidently, from beginning to end, a  mare&rsquo;s-nest. It is one of those wild geese which my brother George has been  chasing for the last ten years, and which never have resulted in profit to him  or anybody else; and I should be something worse than a fool if I were to lend  myself any longer to such a folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; muttered the Captain, &ldquo;here is a change  indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon answered coolly. &ldquo;I dare  say my conduct does seem rather capricious; but you see George put me out of  temper the other day, and I was determined, if he had got a good thing, to cut  the ground from under his feet. All your communications from Ullerton tend to  show me that he has not got hold of a good thing, and that in any attempt to  circumvent him I should only be circumventing myself, wasting your time, and my  own money. This Judson family seems numberless; and it is evident to me that  the Reverend John Haygarth&rsquo;s fortune will be a bone of contention amongst the  Judsons in the High Court of Chancery for any indefinite number of years  between this and the milennium. So I really think, my dear Paget, we&rsquo;d better  consider this transaction finished. I will give you whatever honorarium you  think fit to name for your trouble, and we&rsquo;ll close the affair. I shall find  plenty more business as good, or better, for you to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; replied the Captain, in nowise  satisfied by this promise. It was all too smooth, too conciliatory. And there  was a suddenness in this change of plan that was altogether mysterious. So  indeed might a capricious man be expected to drop a speculation he had been  eager to inaugurate, but Philip Sheldon was the last of men to be suspected of  caprice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have taken an immense deal of trouble  with those extracts, now,&rdquo; said the stockbroker carelessly, as Horatio rose to  depart, offended and angry, but anxious to conceal his anger. &ldquo;What, are you  off so soon? I thought you would stop and take a chop with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks; I have an engagement elsewhere. Yes, I  took an inordinate trouble with those extracts, and I am sorry to think they  should be useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, it is rather provoking to you, I dare  say. The extracts would be very interesting from a social point of view, no  doubt, to people who care about such things; but in a legal sense they are  waste-paper. I can&rsquo;t understand why Hawkehurst was in Ullerton; for, as you  yourself suggested, that Peter Judson who went to India must be the Judson  wanted for this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother may be in league with some other  branch of the Judson family. Or what if he is hunting for an heir on the Haygarth  side?&rdquo; asked the Captain, with a very close watch upon Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s face. Let  the stockbroker be never so skilful a navigator of the high seas of life, there  was no undercurrent, no cross trade-wind, no unexplained veering of the  magnetic needle to the west, in the mysteries whereof the Captain was not also  versed. When Columbus wanted to keep his sailors quiet on that wondrous voyage  over an unknown ocean to the Western world, the diplomatic admiral made so bold  as to underrate the length of each day&rsquo;s sail in an unveracious log, which he  kept for the inspection of his crew; but no doctoring of the social log-book  could mislead the acute Horatio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the Haygarth side of the house?&rdquo; he  asked again; for it had seemed to him that at his first mention of the name of  Haygarth Mr. Sheldon had winced, ever so little. This time, however, he  betrayed not the faintest concern; but he was doubtless now on his guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see how there can be any claimant on  that side of the house,&rdquo; he said carelessly. &ldquo;You see, according to your old  landlord&rsquo;s statement &mdash; which I take to be correct &mdash; Jonathan Haygarth had but  one son, a certain Matthew, who married one Rebecca So-and-so, and had, in his  turn one only son, the intestate John. Now, in that case, where is your heir to  come from, except through Matthew&rsquo;s sister Ruth, who married Peter Judson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just possible that Matthew Haygarth may  have married twice, and had other children? Those letters certainly suggest the  idea of a secret alliance of some kind on Haygarth&rsquo;s part, and the existence of  a family, to whom he appears to have been warmly attached. My first idea of  this affair was that it must have been a low <em>liaison</em>; but I could hardly realize the fact of Matthew&rsquo;s confiding  in his sister under any such circumstances, however lax in his morals that  gentleman may have been. Mrs. Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s letters hint at some mystery  in her husband&rsquo;s life. Is it not likely that this hidden family was a  legitimate one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite see my way to that idea,&rdquo; Mr.  Sheldon answered, in a meditative tone. &ldquo;It seems very unlikely that any  marriage of Haygarth&rsquo;s could have remained unknown to his townsmen; and even if  it were so, I doubt the possibility of our tracing the heirs from such a  marriage. No, my dear Paget, I have resolved to wash my hands of the business,  and leave my brother George in undisturbed possession of his ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, perhaps, you will return my notes;  they are interesting to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here again the faintest indication of annoyance in  the stockbroker&rsquo;s face told its tale to Captain Paget. For your accomplished  navigator of the unknown seas there is no ocean bird, no floating weed, that  has not a language and a significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have your notes, if you want them,&rdquo;  answered Mr. Sheldon; &ldquo;they are at my office. I&rsquo;ll hunt them up and send them  to you; or you had better look in upon me in the City early next week, and I  can give you a cheque at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. I will be sure and do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say the orthography of the original letters  was queer. I suppose your copies were faithful in all matters except the  orthography. And in the names, you of course adhered to the original spelling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most decidedly,&rdquo; replied Captain Paget, opening  the door to depart, and with a somewhat cynical smile upon his face, which was  hidden from Mr. Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there is no doubt of your accuracy with  regard to the name of
  Meynell, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least. Good afternoon. Ah, there&rsquo;s our  young friend Hawkehurst!&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain, in his &ldquo;society&rdquo; voice, as he  looked out into the hall, where Valentine was parting with Diana.</p>
<p>He came and greeted his young friend, and they left  the house together.</p>
<p>This was the occasion upon which Valentine was  startled by hearing the name &ldquo;Meynell&rdquo; pronounced by the lips of Philip  Sheldon.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  Captain Paget Is Paternal</h2>
<p>Horatio Paget left the Lawn after the foregoing  interview, fully convinced that Mr. Sheldon was only desirous to throw him off  the scent, in order to follow up the chase alone, for his sole profit and  advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My last letter conveyed some intelligence that  altered his whole plan of action,&rdquo; thought the Captain; &ldquo;that is perfectly  clear. He was somewhat wanting in tact when he recalled me so suddenly. But I  suppose he thought it would be easy to throw dust in my poor old eyes. What was  the intelligence that made him change his mind? That is the grand question.&rdquo;  Captain Paget dined alone at a West-End restaurant that evening. He dined well,  for he had in hand certain moneys advanced by his patron, and he was not  disposed to be parsimonious. He sat for some time in meditative mood over his  pint bottle of Chambertin, and the subject of his meditation was Philip  Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he murmured at last, &ldquo;that is it. The charm  is in the name of Meynell. Why else should he question me about the orthography  of that name? I sent him information about Matthew Haygarth in the wife&rsquo;s  letters, and he took no special notice of that information. It was only when  the name of Meynell cropped up that he changed his tactics and tried to throw  me over. It seems to me that he must have some knowledge of this Meynell  branch, and therefore thinks himself strong enough to act alone, and to throw  me over the bridge. To throw me over,&rdquo; the Captain repeated to himself slowly.  &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see about that. We&rsquo;ll see; yes, we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At noon on the following day Captain Paget  presented himself again at the Bayswater villa, where his daughter ate the  bread of dependence. He appeared this time in a purely paternal character. He came  to call upon his only child. Before paying this visit the Captain had improved  the shining hour by a careful study of the current and two or three back  volumes of the Post-Office and Trade Directories; but all his researches in  those interesting volumes had failed to reveal to him the existence of any  metropolitan Meynells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Meynells whom Sheldon knows may be in the  heart of the country,&rdquo; he said to himself, after these futile labours.</p>
<p>It was a fine autumnal morning, and as Miss Paget  was at home and disengaged, her affectionate father suggested that she should  take a walk with him in Kensington Gardens. Such a promenade had very little  attraction for the young lady; but she had a vague idea that she owed a kind of  duty to her father not remitted by his neglect of all duties to her; so she  assented with a smile, and went out with him, looking very handsome and stylish  in her simple but fashionable attire, no part of which had been provided by the  parent she accompanied.</p>
<p>The Captain surveyed her with some sense of family  pride. &ldquo;Upon my word, my dear, you do me credit!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a somewhat  patronising kindness of tone and manner; &ldquo;indeed any man might be proud of such  a daughter. You are every inch a Paget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, papa,&rdquo; said the girl involuntarily;  but the Captain&rsquo;s more delicate instincts had been considerably blunted in the  press and jostle of life, and he did not feel the sting of this remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps you are right, my love,&rdquo; he replied  blandly; &ldquo;the Pagets <em>are</em> an unlucky  family. Like those Grecian people, the Atri &mdash; , what&rsquo;s-his-name &mdash; the man who  was killed in his bath, you know. His wife, or the other young person who had  come to visit his daughters, made the water too hot, you know &mdash; and that kind  of thing. I am not quite clear about the story, but it&rsquo;s one of those farragos  of rubbish they make young men learn at public schools. Yes, my dear, I really  am amazingly pleased by your improved appearance. Those Sheldon people dress  you very nicely; and I consider your residence in that family a very agreeable  arrangement for all parties. You confer a favour on the girl by your society,  and so on, and the mother provides you with a comfortable home; All I wonder is  that your good looks haven&rsquo;t made their mark before this with some of Sheldon&rsquo;s  rich stockbroking fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see very little of the stockbroking fellows, as  you call them, at the
  Lawn, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! I thought Sheldon kept a great deal of  company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no. He gives a dinner now and then, a  gentleman&rsquo;s dinner usually; and poor Mrs. Sheldon is very anxious that it  should all go off well, as she says; but I don&rsquo;t think he is a person who cares  much for society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His mind seems completely occupied by his  business, you see, papa. That horrible pursuit of gain seems to require all his  thoughts, and all his time. He is always reading commercial papers, the <em>Money Market</em> and <em>On Change</em>, and the <em>Stockbrokers&rsquo;  Vade Mecum</em>, and publications of that kind. When he is not reading he is  thinking; and by his manner one would fancy his thoughts were always gloomy and  unpleasant. What a miserable, hateful, unholy life to lead! I would not be that  man for all the money in the Bank of England. But it is a kind of treachery to  tell these things. Mr. Sheldon is very good to me. He lets me sit at his table  and share the comforts of his home, and I must be very ungrateful to speak  against him. I do <em>not</em> mean to speak  against him, you see, papa &mdash; I only mean that a life devoted to money-making is  in itself hateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, you may be assured that anything  you say to <em>me</em> will go no further,&rdquo;  said the Captain, with dignity; &ldquo;and in whom should you confide, if not in your  father? I have a profound respect for Sheldon and his family &mdash; yes, my love, a  profound respect; and I think that girl Sarah &mdash; no, I mean Charlotte &mdash; a very  charming young person. I need scarcely tell you that the smallest details of  your life in that family possess a keen interest for me. I am not without a  father&rsquo;s feelings, Diana, though circumstances have never permitted me to  perform a father&rsquo;s duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here the solitary tear which the accomplished  Horatio could produce at will trembled in his eye. This one tear was always at  his command. For the life of him he could not have produced a second; but the  single drop never failed him, and he found one tear as effective as a dozen, in  giving point and finish to a pathetic speech.</p>
<p>Diana looked at him, and wondered, and doubted.  Alas, she knew him only too well! Any other creature in this wide world he  might deceive, but not her. She had lived with him; she had tasted the  bitterness of dependence upon him &mdash; ten times more bitter than dependence on  strangers. She had shown him her threadbare garments day after day, and had  pleaded for a little money, to be put off with a lying excuse. She could not  forget this. She had forgiven him long ago, being of too generous a nature to  brood upon past injuries. But she could not forget what manner of man he was,  and thank him for pretty speeches which she knew to be meaningless.</p>
<p>They talked a little more of Mr. Sheldon and his  family, but Diana did not again permit herself to be betrayed into any vehement  expressions of her opinions. She answered all her father&rsquo;s questions without  restraint, for they were very commonplace questions, of a kind that might be  answered without any breach of faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst the Sheldons&rsquo; acquaintances did you ever  hear of any people called Meynell?&rdquo; Captain Paget asked at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Diana replied, after a moment&rsquo;s thought;  &ldquo;the name is certainly very familiar to me;&rdquo; and then, after a pause, she  exclaimed, &ldquo;Why, the Meynells were relations of Charlotte&rsquo;s! Yes, her  grandmother was a Miss Meynell; I perfectly remember hearing Mrs. Sheldon talk  about the Meynells. But I do not think there are any descendants of that family  now living. Why do you ask the question, papa? What interest have you in the  Meynells?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, I have my reasons, but they in no  manner concern Mr. Sheldon or his family; and I must beg you to be careful not  to mention the subject in your conversation with those worthy people. I want to  know all about this Meynell family. I have come across some people of that  name, and I want to ascertain the precise relationship existing between these  people and the Sheldons. But the Sheldons must know nothing of this inquiry for  the present. The people I speak of are poor and proud, and they would perish  rather than press a relationship upon a rich man, unless fully justified by the  closeness of family ties. I am sure you understand all this, Diana?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very clearly, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, it is a delicate position, and  perhaps somewhat difficult for the comprehension of a third party. All you need  understand is the one fact, that any information respecting the Meynell family  will be vitally interesting to my friends, and, through them, serviceable to  me. There is, in fact, a legacy which these friends of mine could claim, under  a certain will, if once assured as to the degree of their relationship to your  friend Charlotte&rsquo;s kindred on the Meynell side of the house. To give them the  means of securing this legacy would be to help the ends of justice; and I am  sure, Diana, you would wish to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, papa, if I can do so without any breach  of faith with my employers. Can you promise me that no harm will result to the  Sheldons, above all to Charlotte Halliday, from any information I may procure  for you respecting the Meynell family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Diana, I can promise you that. I repeat  most solemnly, that by obtaining such information for me you will be aiding the  cause of justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Horatio Paget might ever be betrayed into the  inconsistency of a truthful assertion, it seemed to his daughter that it was  likely to be in this moment. His words sounded like truth; and, on reflection,  Diana failed to perceive that she could by any possibility inflict wrong on her  friends by obliging her father in this small affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think the matter over, papa,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Diana; what thinking over can be wanted  about such a trifle? I never before asked you a favour. Surely you cannot  refuse to grant so simple a request, after the trouble I have taken to explain  my reasons for making it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some further discussion, which ended in  Miss Paget consenting to oblige her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will manage matters with tact?&rdquo; urged the  Captain, at parting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no especial tact required, papa,&rdquo; replied  Diana; &ldquo;the matter is easy enough. Mrs. Sheldon is very fond of talking about  her own affairs. I have only to ask her some leading question about the  Meynells, and she will run on for an hour, telling me the minutest details of  family history connected with them. I dare say I have heard the whole story  before, and have not heeded it: I often find my thoughts wandering when Mrs.  Sheldon is talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days after this Captain Paget called on Mr.  Sheldon in the City, when he received a very handsome recompense for his  labours at Ullerton, and became repossessed of the extracts he had made from  Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s letters, but not of the same Mr. Haygarth&rsquo;s autograph  letter: that document Mr. Sheldon confessed to having mislaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has mislaid the original letter, and he has had  ample leisure for copying my extracts; and he thinks I am such a consummate  fool as not to see all that,&rdquo; thought Horatio, as he left the stockbroker&rsquo;s  office, enriched but not satisfied.</p>
<p>In the course of the same day he received a long  letter from Diana containing the whole history of the Meynells, as known to  Mrs. Sheldon. Once set talking, Georgy had told all she could tell, delighted  to find herself listened to with obvious interest by her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust that you have not deceived me, my dear  father,&rdquo; Diana concluded, after setting forth the Meynell history. &ldquo;The dear  good soul was so candid and confiding, and seemed so pleased by the interest I  showed in her family affairs, that I should feel myself the vilest of wretches  if any harm could result to her, or those she loves, from the information thus  obtained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The information was very complete. Mrs. Sheldon had  a kindly and amiable nature, but she was not one of those sensitive souls who  instinctively shrink from a story of bitter shame or profound sorrow as from a  cureless wound. She told Diana, with many lamentations, and much second-hand  morality, the sad history of Susan Meynell&rsquo;s elopement, and of the return,  fourteen years afterwards, of the weary wanderer. Even the poor little trunk,  with the name of the Rouen trunk-maker, Mrs. Sheldon dwelt upon with graphic  insistence. A certain womanly delicacy had prevented her ever telling this  story in the presence of her brother-in-law, George Sheldon, whose hard worldly  manner in no way invited any sentimental revelation. Thus it happened that  George had never heard the name of Meynell in connection with his friend Tom  Halliday&rsquo;s family, or had heard it so seldom as to have entirely forgotten it.  To Horatio his daughter&rsquo;s letter was priceless. It placed him at once in as  good a position as Philip Sheldon, or as George Sheldon and his coadjutor,  Valentine Hawkehurst. There were thus three different interests involved in the  inheritance of the Reverend John Haygarth.</p>
<p>Captain Paget sat late by a comfortable fire, in  his own bedchamber, that night, enjoying an excellent cigar, and meditating the  following jottings from a pedigree: &mdash;</p>
<p class="note">CHARLOTTE MEYNELL, married JAMES HALLIDAY.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br>
  THOMAS HALLIDAY, only son of above, married GEORGINA, now Mrs. SHELDON;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| had issue,<br>
  CHARLOTTE HALLIDAY.</p>
<p class="note">SUSAN MEYNELL, only and elder sister of the  above-named Charlotte, ran away from her home, in Yorkshire, with a Mr.  Kingdon, brother to Lord Darnsville. Fate unknown during fourteen years of her  life. Died in London, 1835. Buried under her maiden name; but no positive  evidence to show that she was unmarried.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  The Captain&rsquo;s Coadjutor</h2>
<p>Once in possession of the connection between the  intestate John Haygarth and the Halliday family, Captain Paget&rsquo;s course was an  easy one. He understood now why his investigations had been so suddenly brought  to a standstill. Philip Sheldon had discovered the unexpected connection, and  was eager to put a stop to researches that might lead to a like discovery on  the part of his coadjutor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Sheldon expects to prove his stepdaughter&rsquo;s  claim to this fortune?&rdquo; thought the Captain. &ldquo;He will affect ignorance of the  whole transaction until his plans are ripe, and then spring them suddenly upon  his brother George. I wonder if there is anything to be made out of George by  letting him into the secret of his brother&rsquo;s interference? No; I think not.  George is as poor as a church mouse, and Philip must always be the more  profitable acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the broad basis afforded by Diana&rsquo;s letter  Captain Paget was able to build up the whole scheme of the Haygarthian  succession. The pedigree of the Meynells was sufficiently simple, if their  legitimate descent from Matthew Haygarth could be fairly proved. Charlotte  Halliday was heiress-at-law to the fortune of John Haygarth, always provided  that her great-aunt Susan died without legitimate issue.</p>
<p>Here was the one chance which appeared to the  adventurous mind of Horatio Paget worth some trouble in the way of research.  Fourteen years of Susan Meynell&rsquo;s life had been spent away from all who knew  her. It was certainly possible that in that time she might have formed some legitimate  alliance.</p>
<p>This was the problem which Horatio set himself to  solve. Your adventurer is, of all manner of men, the most sanguine. Sir Walter  Raleigh sees visions of gold and glory where grave statesmen see only a fool&rsquo;s  paradise of dreams and fancies. To the hopeful mind of the Captain these  fourteen unrecorded years of Susan Meynell&rsquo;s life seemed a very Golconda.</p>
<p>He did not, however, rest satisfied with the  information afforded by
  Diana&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have the story of these Meynells at  first-hand as well as at second-hand,&rdquo; he said to himself; and he lost no time  in presenting himself again at the Villa &mdash; this time as a visitor to Mrs.  Sheldon.</p>
<p>With Georgy he had been always a favourite. His  little stories of the great world &mdash; the Prince and Perdita, Brummel and  Sheridan &mdash; though by no means novel to those acquainted with that glorious  period of British history, were very agreeable to Georgy. The Captain&rsquo;s florid  flatteries pleased her; and she contrasted the ceremonious manners of that  gentleman with the curt business-like style of her husband, very much to the  Captain&rsquo;s advantage. He came to thank her for her goodness to his child, and  this occasion gave him ample opportunity for sentiment. He had asked to see  Mrs. Sheldon alone, as his daughter&rsquo;s presence would have been some hindrance  to the carrying out of his design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are things I have to say which I should  scarcely care to utter before my daughter, you see, my dear Mrs. Sheldon,&rdquo; he  said, with pathetic earnestness. &ldquo;I should not wish to remind the dear child of  her desolate position; and I need scarcely tell you that position is <em>very</em> desolate. A father who, at his  best, cannot provide a fitting home for a delicately nurtured girl, and who at  any moment may be snatched away, is but a poor protector. And were it not for  your friendship, I know not what my child&rsquo;s fate might be. The dangers and  temptations that beset a handsome young woman are very terrible, my dear Mrs.  Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was intended to lead up to the subject of  Susan Meynell, but Georgy did not rise to the bait. She only shook her head  plaintively in assent to the Captain&rsquo;s proposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam; beauty, unallied with strength of mind  and high principles, is apt to be a fatal dower. In every family there are sad  histories,&rdquo; murmured the sentimental Horatio.</p>
<p>Even this remark did not produce the required  result; so the Captain drew upon his invention for a specimen history from the  annals of his own house, which was a colourable imitation of Susan Meynell&rsquo;s  story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was the end of this lovely Belinda  Paget&rsquo;s career, my dear Mrs. Sheldon?&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;The gentleman was a man  of high rank, but a scoundrel and a dastard. Sophia&rsquo;s brother, a cornet in the  First Life Guards, called him out, and there was a meeting on Wimbledon Common,  in which Lavinia&rsquo;s seducer was mortally wounded. There was a trial, and the  young captain of Hussars, Amelia&rsquo;s brother, was sentenced to transportation for  life. I need scarcely tell you that the sentence was never carried out. The  young man fell gloriously at Waterloo, at the head of his own regiment, the  Scotch Fusiliers, and Lavinia &mdash; I beg pardon, Amelia; nay, what am I saying?  the girl&rsquo;s name was Belinda &mdash; embraced the Roman Catholic faith, and expired  from the effects of stigmata inflicted by her own hands in a paroxysm of  remorse for her brother&rsquo;s untimely death at the hands of her seducer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This lively little impromptu sketch had the desired  effect. Melted by the woes of Belinda, or Sophia, or Amelia, or Lavinia Paget,  Mrs. Sheldon was moved to relate a sad event in her husband&rsquo;s family; and  encouraged by the almost tearful sympathy of the Captain, she again repeated  every detail of Susan Meynell&rsquo;s life, as known to her kindred. And as this  recital had flowed spontaneously from the good soul&rsquo;s lips, she would be  scarcely likely to allude to it afterwards in conversation with Mr. Sheldon;  more especially as that gentleman was not in the habit of wasting much of his  valuable time in small-talk with the members of his own household.</p>
<p>Captain Paget had duly calculated this, and every  other hazard that menaced the intricate path he had mapped out for himself.</p>
<p>Satisfied by Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s repetition of Susan  Meynell&rsquo;s story, and possessed of all the information he could hope to obtain  from that quarter, Horatio set himself to consider what steps must next be  taken. Much serious reflection convinced even his sanguine mind that the  enterprise was a difficult one, and could scarcely be carried through  successfully without help from some skilled genealogist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George Sheldon has given his lifetime to this sort  of thing, and is a skilled lawyer to boot,&rdquo; Captain Paget said to himself. &ldquo;If  I hope to go in against him, I must have someone at my elbow as well versed in  this sort of business as he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having once admitted this necessity, the Captain  set himself to consider where he was to find the right person. A very brief  meditation settled this question. One among the numerous business transactions  of Captain Paget&rsquo;s life had brought him in contact with a very respectable  little French gentleman called Fleurus, who had begun his career as a notary,  but, finding that profession unprofitable, had become a hunter of pedigrees and  heirs-at-law &mdash; for the most part to insignificant legacies, unclaimed stock, and  all other jetsam and flotsam thrown up on the shadowy shores of the Court of  Chancery. M. Fleurus had not often been so fortunate as to put his industrious  fingers into any large pie, but he had contrived to make a good deal of money  out of small affairs, and had found his clients grateful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man of men,&rdquo; thought Horatio Paget; and he  betook himself to the office of M. Fleurus early next day, provided with all  documents relating to the Haygarthian succession.</p>
<p>His interview with the little Frenchman was long  and satisfactory. On certain conditions as to future reward, said reward to be  contingent on success, M. Fleurus was ready to devote himself heart and soul to  the interests of Captain Paget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To begin: we must find legal evidence of this  Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s marriage to the mother of this child C., who came afterwards  to marry the man Meynell; and after we will go to Susan Meynell. Her box came  from Rouen &mdash; that we know. Where her box came from she is likely to have come  from. So it is at Rouen, or near Rouen, we must look for her. Let me see: she  die in 1835! that is long time. To look for the particulars of her life is like  to dive into the ocean for to find the lost cargo of a ship that is gone down  to the bottom, no one knows where. But to a man really expert in these things  there is nothing of impossible. I will find you your Susan Meynell in less than  six months; the evidence of her marriage; if she was married; her children, if  she had children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In less than six months &mdash; the margin seemed a wide  one to the impatient Horatio. But he knew that such an investigation must needs  be slow, and he left the matters in the hands of his new ally with a sense that  he had done the best thing that could be done. Then followed for Horatio Paget  two months of patient attendance upon fortune. He was not idle during this  time; for Mr. Sheldon, who seemed particularly anxious to conciliate him, threw  waifs and strays of business into his way. Before the middle of November M.  Fleurus had found the register of Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s marriage, as George  Sheldon had found it before him, working in the same groove, and with the same  order of intelligence. After this important step M. Fleurus departed for his  native shores, where he had other business besides the Meynell affair to claim  his attention. Meanwhile the astute Horatio kept a close eye upon his young  friend Valentine. He knew from Diana that the young man had been in Yorkshire;  and he guessed the motive of his visit to Newhall, not for a moment supposing  that his presence in that farmhouse could have been accidental. The one turn of  affairs that utterly and completely mystified him was Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s sanction of  the engagement between Valentine and Charlotte. This was a mystery for which he  could for some time find no solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheldon will try to establish his stepdaughter&rsquo;s  claim to the fortune; that is clear. But why does he allow her to throw herself  away on a penniless adventurer like Hawkehurst? If she were to marry him before  recovering the Haygarth estate, she would recover it as his wife, and the  fortune would be thrown unprotected into his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More deliberate reflection cast a faint light upon  Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s motives for so quixotic a course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl had fallen in love with Val. It was too  late to prevent that. She is of age, and can marry whom she pleases. By showing  himself opposed to her engagement with Val, he might have hurried her into  rebellion, and an immediate marriage. By affecting to consent to the  engagement, he would, on the contrary, gain time, and the advantage of all  those chances that are involved in the lapse of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a few days of Christmas came the following  letter from M.
  Fleurus: &mdash;</p>
<p class="note"><em>From Jacques  Rousseau Fleurus to Horatio Paget</em>.</p>
<p class="note">Hotel de la Pucelle, place Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, Rouen, 21st  December, 186 &mdash; .</p>
<p class="note">MONSIEUR, &mdash; After exertions incalculable, after  labours herculean, I come to learn something of your Susan Meynell, &mdash; more, I  come to learn of her marriage. But I will begin at the beginning of things. The  labours, the time, the efforts, the courage, the patience, the &mdash; I will say it  without to blush &mdash; the genius which this enterprise has cost me, I will not  enlarge upon. There are things which cannot tell themselves. To commence, I  will tell you how I went to Rouen, how I advertised in the journals of Rouen,  and asked among the people of Rouen &mdash; at shops, at hotels, by the help of my  allies, the police, by means which you, in your inexperience of this science of  research, could not even figure to yourself &mdash; always seeking the trace of this  woman Meynell. It was all pain lost. Of this woman Meynell in Rouen there was  no trace.</p>
<p class="note">In the end I enraged myself. &ldquo;Imbecile!&rdquo; I said to  myself, &ldquo;why seek in this dull commercial city, among this heavy people, for  that which thou shouldst seek only in the centre of all things? As the rivers  go to the ocean, so flow all the streams of human life to the one great central  ocean of humanity &mdash; PARIS! It is there the Alpha and the Omega &mdash; there the  mighty heart through which the blood of all the body must be pumped, and is  pumping always,&rdquo; I say to myself, unconsciously rising to the sublimity of my  great countryman, Hugo, in whose verse I find an echo of my own soul, and whose  compositions I flatter myself I could have surpassed, if I had devoted to the  Muses the time and the powers which I have squandered on a <em>vilain</em> metier, that demands the genius of a Talleyrand, and rewards  with the crust of an artisan.</p>
<p class="note">In Paris, then, I will seek the woman Meynell, and  to Paris I go. In my place an inexperienced person would advertise in the most  considerable papers; would invite Susan Meynell to hear of something to her  advantage; and would bring together a crowd of false Susan Meynells, greedy to  obtain the benefice. Me, I do nothing in this style there. On the contrary, in  the most obscure little journals of Paris I publish a modest little  advertisement as from the brother of Susan Meynell, who implores his sister to  visit him on his deathbed.</p>
<p class="note">Here are follies, you will say. Since Susan Meynell  is dead it is thirty years, and her brother is dead also. Ah, how you are dull,  you insulars, and how impossible for your foggy island to produce a Fouch&eacute;, a  Canler, a genius of police, a Columbus of the subterranean darknesses of your  city.</p>
<p class="note">The brother, dying, advertises for the sister,  dead; and who will answer that letter, think you? Some good Christian soul who  has pity for the sick man, and who will not permit him to languish in waiting  the sister who will come to him never. For us of the Roman Catholic religion  the duty of charity is paramount. You of the Anglican faith &mdash; bah, how you are  cold, how you are hard, how you are unpitiable!</p>
<p class="note">My notice appears once, my notice appears twice,  three times, four times, many times. I occupy myself about my other business,  and I wait. I do not wait unusefully. In effect, a letter arrives at last at  the address of the dying, from a lady who knew Susan Meynell <em>before her marriage with M. Lenoble.</em></p>
<p class="note">Think you not that to me this was a moment of  triumph? <em>Before her marriage with M.  Lenoble!</em> Those words appear under my eyes in the writing of the unknown  lady. &ldquo;It is found!&rdquo; I cry to myself; and then I hasten myself to reply to the  unknown lady. Will she permit me to see her?</p>
<p class="note">With all politeness I make the request; with all  politeness it is answered. The lady calls herself Mademoiselle Servin. She  resides in the street Grande-Mademoiselle, at the corner of the Place Lauzun.  It is of all the streets of Paris the most miserable. One side is already  removed. In face of the windows of those houses that still stand they are  making a new Boulevard. Behind they are pulling down edifices of all kinds in  the formation of a new square. At the side there is a yawning chasm between two  tall houses, through which they pierce a new street. One sees the interior of many  rooms rising one above another for seven stories. Here the gay hangings of an  apartment of little master; there the still gaudier decoration of a boudoir of  these ladies. High above these luxurious salons &mdash; ah, but how much more near to  the skies! &mdash; one sees the poor grey paper, blackened and smoky, of a garret of  sempstress, or workman, and the hearths black, deserted. These interiors thus  exposed tighten me the heart. It is the autopsy of the domestic hearth.</p>
<p class="note">I find the Mademoiselle Servin an old lady, grey  and wan. The house where she now resides is the house which she has inhabited  five-and-thirty years. They talk of pulling it down, and to her the idea of  leaving it is exquisite pain. She is alone, a teacher of music. She has seen  proprietors come and go. The <em>pension</em> has changed mistresses many times. Students of law and of medicine have come  and passed like the shadows of a magic lantern; but this poor soul has remained  still in her little room on the fourth, and has kept always her little old piano.</p>
<p class="note">It was here she knew Susan Meynell, and a young  Frenchman who became in love with her, for she was beautiful like the angels,  this lady said to me.</p>
<p class="note">Until we meet for all details. Enough that I come  to discover where the marriage took place, that I come to obtain a copy of the  register, and that I do all things in rule. Enough that the marriage is a good  marriage &mdash; a regular marriage, and that I have placed myself already in  communication with the heir of that marriage, who resides within some few leagues  of this city.</p>
<p class="note">My labours, my successes I will not describe. It  must that they will be recompensed in the future. I have dispensed much money  during these transactions.</p>
<p class="note">Agree, monsieur, that I am your devoted servitor,</p>
<p class="note">JACQUES  ROUSSEAU FLEURUS</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It was in consequence of the receipt of this  missive that the Captain trusted himself to the winds and waves in the  cheerless December weather. He was well pleased to find that M. Fleurus had  made discoveries so important; but he had no idea of letting that astute  practitioner absorb all the power into his own hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see Susan Meynell&rsquo;s heir,&rdquo; he said to  himself; &ldquo;I must give him clearly to understand that to me he owes the  discovery of his claims, and that in this affair the Frenchman Fleurus is no more  than a paid agent.&rdquo;</p>

  Halcyon Days</h2>
<p>Once having offered up the fondest desires of her  own heart on the shrine of duty, Diana Paget was not a person to repent herself  of the pious sacrifice. After that Christmas night on which she had knelt at  Charlotte&rsquo;s feet to confess her sad secret, and to resign all claim to the man  she had loved so foolishly, so tenderly, with such a romantic and unselfish  devotion, Miss Paget put away all thought of the past from her heart and mind.  Heart and mind seemed empty and joyless without those loved tenants, though the  tenants had been only fair wraiths of dreams that were dead. There was a sense  of something missing in her life &mdash; a blank, dull calm, which was at first very  painful. But for Charlotte&rsquo;s sake she was careful to hide all outward token of  despondency, and the foolish grief, put down by so strong a hand, was ere long  well-nigh stifled.</p>
<p>Those dark days which succeeded Christmas were a  period of halcyon peace for Valentine and Charlotte. The accepted lover came to  the villa when he pleased, but was still careful not to encroach on the license  allowed him. Once a week he permitted himself the delight of five-o&rsquo;clock tea  in Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s drawing-room, on which occasions he brought Charlotte all the  news of his small literary world, and a good deal of useful information out of  the books he had been reading. When Mr. Sheldon pleased to invite him to dinner  on Sunday he gladly accepted the invitation, and this Sunday dinner became in  due course an established institution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well make this your home on a Sunday,&rdquo;  said Mr. Sheldon one day, with careless cordiality; &ldquo;I dare say you find Sunday  dull in your lodgings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; cried Charlotte, &ldquo;he does find it very  dull &mdash; dreadfully dull &mdash; don&rsquo;t you, Valentine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she regarded him with that pretty, tender,  almost motherly look, which young ladies who are engaged are apt to bestow on  their affianced lovers.</p>
<p>Miss Halliday was very grateful to her stepfather  for his kindness to her landless adorer, and showed her appreciation of his  conduct in many pretty little caressing ways, which would have been infinitely  bewitching to a person of sentiment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Mr. Sheldon was not sentimental, and  any exhibition of feeling appeared to have an irritating effect upon his  nerves. There were times when he shrank from some little sudden caress of  Charlotte&rsquo;s as from the sting of an adder. Aversion, surprise, fear &mdash; what was  it that showed in the expression of his face at these moments? Whatever that  strange look was, it departed too quickly for analysis; and the stockbroker  thanked his stepdaughter for her little affectionate demonstration with his  wonted smile &mdash; the smile he smiled on Change, the smile which was sometimes on his  lips when his mind was a nest of scorpions.</p>
<p>To Valentine, in these rosy hours, life seemed full  of hope and brightness. He transferred his goods and chattels from Omega  Street, Chelsea, to the pleasant lodging in the Edgware Road, where he was  nearer Charlotte, and out of the way of his late patron Captain Paget, in the  event of that gentleman&rsquo;s return from the Continent.</p>
<p>Fortune favoured him. The gaiety of heart which  came with his happiness lent a grace to his pen. Pleasant thoughts and fancies  bedecked his pages. He saw everything in the rosy light of love and beauty, and  there was a buoyant freshness in all he wrote. The Pegasus might be but a  common hackney, but the hack was young and fresh, and galloped gaily as he  scented the dewy morning air. It is not every poet whose Pegasus clears at a  bound a space as wide as all that waste of land and sea the watchman views from  his tall tower on the rock.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s papers on Lauzun, Brummel,  Sardanapalus, Rabelais, Lord Chesterfield, Erasmus, Beau Nash, Apelles,  Galileo, and Philip of Orleans, were in demand, and the reading public wondered  at this prodigy of book-making. He had begun to save money, and had opened a  deposit account at the Unitas Bank. How he gloated over the deposit receipts in  the stillness of the night, when he added a fresh one to his store! When he had  three, for sums amounting in all to forty pounds, he took them to Charlotte,  and she looked at them, and he looked at them, as if the poor little bits of  printed paper had been specimens of virgin ore from some gold mine newly  discovered by Mr. Hawkehurst. And then these foolish lovers kissed each other,  as William Lee and his wife may have embraced after the penniless young student  had perfected his invention of the stocking-frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty pounds!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Halliday, &ldquo;all won  by your pen, and your poor fingers, and your poor, poor head! How it must ache  after a long day&rsquo;s work! How clever you must be, Valentine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear; amazingly clever. Clever enough to know  that you are the dearest girl in Christendom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, sir! You are not clever  enough to have the privilege of doing that yet awhile. I mean, how learned you  must be to know such lots of things, all about Erasmus, and Galileo, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my darling, not Erasmus and Galileo. I knew  all about Erasmus last week; but I am working at my paper on Galileo now, an  exhaustive review of all the books that were ever written on the subject, in  ten pages. I don&rsquo;t ask other people to remember what I write, you know, my dear,  and I don&rsquo;t pledge myself to remember it. That sort of thing won&rsquo;t keep. There  is a kind of sediment, no doubt, in one&rsquo;s note-book; but the effervescence of  that vintage goes off rather quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only know that you are a very clever person, and  that one obtains an immensity of information from your writings,&rdquo; said  Charlotte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearest, there is a kind of wine that must be  made into negus for such pretty little topers as you &mdash; the &lsquo;Wine of Cyprus,&rsquo; as  Mrs. Browning called it. It is better for pretty girls to have the negus than  to have nothing, or only weak home-brewed stuff that results in head-ache. My  dearest, Fate has been very good to me, and I love my profession of letters. I  am sure that of all educational processes there is none better than book-making;  and the man who begins by making books must be a dolt, dunce, and dunderhead,  if he do not end by writing them. So you may yet hope to see the morning that  shall make your Valentine famous &mdash; for a fortnight. What man can hope to be  famous for <em>more</em> than a fortnight in  such a railroad age as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this halcyon period, in which Mr. Hawkehurst  cultivated alternately the society of the Muses and his mistress, he saw little  or nothing of George Sheldon. He had washed his hands of all share in the work  of establishing Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s claim to the Reverend John Haygarth&rsquo;s  thousands. Indeed, since that interview in which Philip Sheldon had made so  light of his stepdaughter&rsquo;s chances, and ratified his consent to her marriage  with so humble a literary adventurer as himself, Mr. Hawkehurst had come to  consider the Haygarthian inheritance as altogether a visionary business. If it  were certain, or even probable, that Charlotte was to inherit a hundred  thousand pounds, was it likely that Mr. Sheldon would encourage such an  alliance? This question Mr. Hawkehurst always answered in the negative; and as  days and weeks went by, and he heard no more of the Haygarth fortune, the idea  of Charlotte&rsquo;s wealth became more and more shadowy.</p>
<p>If there were anything doing in this matter, the  two brothers were now working together, and George had no further need of  Valentine&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>The two brothers were not working entirely  together. Philip Sheldon had taken the matter into his own strong hand, and  George found it very difficult to hold an inch of ground against that  formidable antagonist. The papers and information which George had boasted of  to Valentine, and the possession whereof was, as he asserted, the very keystone  of the arch, proved to be of such small account that he ultimately consented to  hand them over to his brother on the payment of expenses out of pocket, and a  bonus of one hundred and fifty pounds, together with a written undertaking from  Miss Halliday to pay him the fifth share of any fortune recovered by means of  those papers.</p>
<p>This undertaking had been executed in the easiest  manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother has taken it into his wise head that  there is some unclaimed stock standing in your grandfather&rsquo;s name which you are  entitled to, Lotta,&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon said one morning; &ldquo;and he wants to recover the  amount for you, on condition of receiving a clear fifth when the sum is  recovered. Have you any objection to sign such an undertaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear papa, how can I object?&rdquo; cried Charlotte  gaily. &ldquo;Why, stocks are money, are they not? How fortunate we are, and how rich  we are getting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine and I,&rdquo; murmured the girl, blushing. &ldquo;I  cannot help thinking of him when any windfall of good fortune comes to me. What  do you think, papa? He has saved forty pounds in little more than three months  &mdash; all earned by his pen!</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Behold<br>
  The arch-enchanter&rsquo;s wand! Itself a nothing;<br>
  But taking sorcery from the master-hand<br>
  To paralyze the Caesars, and to strike<br>
The loud earth breathless!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Miss Halliday spouted the glowing lines of the  noble dramatist with charming enthusiasm. She signed the required undertaking  without looking at it, and it was duly witnessed by her stepfather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your talk with your mother and Valentine, I  should advise you to be as silent about this small business as about your own  little fortune,&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon remarked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t I tell Valentine?&rdquo; cried Charlotte, making  a wry face; &ldquo;I should so like to tell him &mdash; just about these stocks. I daresay <em>he</em> knows what stocks are; and it would  be such cheering news for him, after he has worked his poor brain so for that  forty pounds. I don&rsquo;t so much care about telling poor mamma; for she does  exclaim and wonder so about things, that it is quite fatiguing to hear her. But  please let me tell Valentine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Halliday pursed-up her lips and offered her  stepfather one of those kisses which she had of late been prompted to bestow on  him out of the gratitude of a heart overflowing with girlish joy. He took the  kiss as he might have taken a dose of medicine, but did not grant the request  preferred by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to be a fool, you can tell your lover  of this windfall; but if you wish to prove yourself a sensible girl, you will  hold your tongue. He has saved forty pounds by hard work in the last three  months, you say: do you think he would have saved forty pence if he had known  that you had five thousand pounds at his disposal? I know that class of men;  look at Goldsmith, the man who wrote the &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rasselas,&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Clarissa Harlowe,&rdquo; and so on. I have read somewhere that he never wrote  except under coercion &mdash; that is to say, want of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte acknowledged the wisdom of this argument,  and submitted. She was not what was called a strong-minded woman; and, indeed,  strength of mind is not a plant indigenous to the female nature, but an  exceptional growth developed by exceptional circumstances. In Charlotte&rsquo;s life  there had been nothing exceptional, and she was in all things soft and womanly,  ready to acknowledge, and to be guided by, the wisdom of her seniors. So  Valentine heard nothing of the undertaking executed by his lady-love.</p>
<p>After this, Mr. Sheldon took counsel&rsquo;s opinion, and  set to work in real earnest to recover the estate of the deceased John Haygarth  from the yawning jaws of that tame but all-devouring monster, the Crown. The  work was slow, and the dry as dust details thereof need not be recorded here.  It had but just begun when Horatio Paget suddenly returned from his Continental  expedition, and established himself once more in the Omega Street lodgings.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  Captain Paget Awakens To A Sense Of His Duty</h2>
<p>Captain Paget&rsquo;s return was made known to the  Sheldon circle by a letter from the returning wanderer to his daughter. The  Captain was laid up with rheumatic gout, and wrote quite piteously to implore a  visit from Diana. Miss Paget, always constant to the idea of a duty to be  performed on her side, even to this <em>p&egrave;re  prodigue</em>, obeyed the summons promptly, with the full approval of Georgy,  always good-natured after her own fussy manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you&rsquo;d like to take your papa a bottle of  Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s old port, Diana, remember it&rsquo;s at your disposal. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve  heard people say that old port is good for the gout &mdash; or perhaps, by the bye,  what I heard was that it <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> good.  I know old port and gout seem to run together in my head somehow. But if  there&rsquo;s anything in the house your papa would like, Diana &mdash; wine, or gunpowder  tea, or the eider-down coverlet off the spare bed, or the parlour croquet, to  amuse him of an evening, or a new novel &mdash; surely one couldn&rsquo;t forfeit one&rsquo;s  subscription by lending a book to a non-subscribing invalid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Georgy was suggesting the loan of almost  every portable object in the house as a specific for Captain Paget&rsquo;s gout,  Charlotte sent for a cab and made things smooth for her friend&rsquo;s departure. She  wrapped her warmly against the February blast, and insisted upon going out to  see her seated in the cab, whereby she offered to the pedestrians of that  neighbourhood a seraphic vision of loveliness with tumbled hair. Charlotte had  been always delightful, but Charlotte engaged to Valentine Hawkehurst was a  creature of supernal sweetness and brightness &mdash; a radiant ministering angel,  hovering lightly above a world too common for her foot to rest upon.</p>
<p>Miss Paget found her father suffering from a by no  means severe attack of a respectable family gout, a little peevish from the  effects of this affliction, but not at all depressed in mind. He had, indeed,  the manner of a man with whom things are going pleasantly. There was a  satisfaction in his tone, a placidity in his face, except when distorted for  the moment by a twinge of pain, that were new to Diana, who had not been  accustomed to behold the brighter side of her father&rsquo;s disposition. He seemed  grateful for his daughter&rsquo;s visit, and received her with unwonted kindness of  manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have come very promptly, my dear, and I am  gratified by your early compliance with my request,&rdquo; he said with dignified  affection, after he had given his daughter the kiss of greeting. &ldquo;I was a great  sufferer last night, Diana, a great sufferer, a prisoner to this chair, and the  woman below attempted to send me up a dinner &mdash; <em>such</em> a dinner! One would think a very small degree of education  necessary for the stewing of a kidney, but the things that woman gave me last  night were like morsels of stewed leather. I am not an epicure, Diana; but with  such a constitution as mine, good cooking is a vital necessity. Life in  lodgings for a man of my age is a sore trial, my dear. I wish you were well married,  Diana, and could give your father a humble corner at your fireside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana smiled. It was a somewhat bitter smile; and  there was scorn of herself, as well as scorn of her father in that bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not the sort of person to marry well, papa,&rdquo;  she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? You are handsomer than nine-tenths of  the women who marry well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, papa; that is your sanguine manner of looking  at your own property. And even if I were married to some one to whom I might  give obedience and duty, and all that kind of thing, in exchange for a  comfortable home, as they say in the advertisements, would you be content with  a peaceful corner by my fireside? Do you think you would never pine for clubs  and gaming-tables &mdash; nay, even for creditors to &mdash; to diplomatize with, and  difficulties to surmount?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear. I am an old man; the clubs and  gaming-houses have done with me, and I with them. I went to see a man at  Arthur&rsquo;s a few months ago. I had written to him on a little matter of business  &mdash; in fact, to be candid with you, my love, for the loan of a five-pound note &mdash;  and I called at the club for his reply. I caught sight of my face in a distant  glass as I was waiting in the strangers&rsquo; room, and I thought I was looking at a  ghost. There comes a time towards the close of a long troublesome life in which  a man begins to feel like a ghost. His friends are gone, and his money is gone,  his health is gone, his good looks are gone; and the only mistake seems to be  that the man himself should be left behind. I remember an observation of Lord  Chesterfield&rsquo;s: &lsquo;Lord &mdash;&mdash; and I have been dead for the last two years, but we  don&rsquo;t tell anyone so,&rsquo; he said; and there are few old men who couldn&rsquo;t say the  same. But I am not down-hearted to-day, my dear. No, the habit of hoping has  never quite deserted me; and it is only now and then that I take a dismal view  of life. Come, my love, lay aside your bonnet and things. Dear me! what a  handsome black silk dress, and how well you look in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a present from Charlotte, papa. She has a  very liberal allowance of pocket-money, and is generosity itself. I don&rsquo;t like  to take so much from her, but I only wound her by a refusal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, my dear. There is nothing so ungracious  as a refusal, and no mark of high breeding so rare as the art of gracious  acceptance. Any booby can give a present; but to receive a gift without  churlish reticence or florid rapture is no easy accomplishment. I am always  pleased to see you well-dressed, my love&rdquo; &mdash; Diana winced as she remembered her  shabby hat and threadbare gown at F&ocirc;retdech&ecirc;ne&mdash; &ldquo;and I am especially pleased to  see you elegantly attired this evening, as I expect a gentleman by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman, papa!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Paget, with  considerable surprise; &ldquo;I thought that you had sent for me because you were ill  and depressed and lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, Diana, I certainly am ill; and I  suppose it is scarcely unnatural that a father should wish to see his only  daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana was silent. A father&rsquo;s wish to see his  daughter was indeed natural and common; but that Captain Paget, who in no  period of his daughter&rsquo;s life had evinced for her the common affection of  paternity, should be seized all of a sudden with a yearning for her society,  was somewhat singular. But Diana&rsquo;s nature had been ennobled and fortified by the  mental struggle and the impalpable sacrifice of the last few months, and she  was in nowise disposed to repel any affectionate feeling of her father&rsquo;s even  at this eleventh hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>He</em> tells  us the eleventh hour is not too late,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;If it is not too late in  the sight of that Divine Judge, shall it be thought too late by an erring  creature like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few minutes of thoughtful silence, she  knelt down by her father&rsquo;s chair and kissed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear father,&rdquo; she murmured softly, &ldquo;believe me,  I am very pleased to think you should wish to see me. I will come to you  whenever you like to send for me. I am glad not to be a burden to you; but I  should wish to be a comfort when I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain shed his stock tear. It signified  something nearer akin to real emotion than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is very pleasing,  very pleasing indeed. The day may come &mdash; I cannot just now say when &mdash; and  events may arise &mdash; which &mdash; the nature of which I am not yet in a position to  indicate to you &mdash; but the barren fig-tree may not be always fruitless. In its  old age the withered trunk may put forth fresh branches. We will say no more of  this, my love; and I will only remark that you may not go unrequited for any  affection bestowed on your poor old father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana smiled, and this time it was a pensive rather  than a bitter smile. She had often heard her father talk like this before. She  had often heard these oracular hints of some grand event looming mighty in the  immediate future; but she had never seen the vague prophecy accomplished.  Always a schemer, and always alternating between the boastful confidence of  hope and the peevish bewailings of despair, the Captain had built his castle  to-day to sit among its ruins to-morrow, ever since she had known him.</p>
<p>So she set little value on his hopeful talk of this  evening, but was content to see him in good spirits. He contemplated her  admiringly as she knelt by his easy-chair, and smoothed the shining coils of  her dark hair with a gentle hand, as he looked downward at the thoughtful face  &mdash; proud and grave, but not ungentle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a very handsome girl, Diana,&rdquo; he murmured,  as much to himself as to his daughter; &ldquo;yes, very handsome. Egad, I had no idea  how handsome!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has put such a fancy into your head to-night,  papa?&rdquo; asked Diana, laughing. &ldquo;I do not believe in the good looks you are so  kind as to attribute to me. When I see my face in the glass I perceive a pale  gloomy countenance that is by no means pleasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be out of spirits when you look in the  glass. I hope you are not unhappy at Bayswater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I be unhappy, papa? No sister was ever  kinder or more loving than Charlotte Halliday is to me. I should be very  ungrateful to Providence as well as to her if I did not appreciate such  affection. How many lonely girls, like me, go through life without picking up a  sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are right, my dear. Those Sheldon people  have been very useful to you. They are not the kind of people I should have  wished a daughter of mine to be <em>li&eacute;e</em> with, if I were in the position my birth entitles me to occupy; but as I am not  in that position, I submit. That black silk becomes you admirably. And now, my  love, be so kind as to ring the bell for lights and tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had been sitting in the firelight &mdash; the mystic  magical capricious firelight &mdash; which made even that tawdry lodging-house  parlour seem a pleasant chamber. The tea-tray was brought, and candles. Diana  seated herself at the table, and made tea with the contents of a little  mahogany caddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pour out the tea just yet,&rdquo; said the  Captain; &ldquo;I expect a gentleman. I don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;ll take tea, but it will  look more civil to wait for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is this mysterious gentleman, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Frenchman; a man I met while I was abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Really</em> a  gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Diana,&rdquo; replied her father, with  offended dignity. &ldquo;Do you think I should admit any person to my friendship who  is not a gentleman? My business relations I am powerless to govern; but  friendship is a different matter. There is no man more exclusive than Horatio  Paget. M. Lenoble is a gentleman of ancient lineage and amiable character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And rich, I suppose, papa?&rdquo; asked Diana. She  thought that her father would scarcely speak of the gentleman in a tone so  profoundly respectful if he were not rich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Diana. M. Lenoble is master of a very fair  estate, and is likely to be much richer before he dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he has been kind to you, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has shown me hospitality during my  residence in Normandy. You need not speak of him to your friends the Sheldons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even to Charlotte?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even to Charlotte. I do not care to have my  affairs discussed by that class of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear papa, why make a mystery about so  unimportant a matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not make a mystery; but I hate gossip. Mrs.  Sheldon is an incorrigible gossip, and I daresay her daughter is no better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte is an angel, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very possible. But I beg that you will  refrain from discussing my friend M. Lenoble in her angelic presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, papa,&rdquo; said Diana gravely. She felt  herself bound to obey her father in this small matter; but the idea of this  mystery and secrecy was very unwelcome to her. It implied that her father&rsquo;s  acquaintance with this Frenchman was only a part of some new scheme. It was no  honest friendship, which the Captain might be proud to own, glad to show the  world that in these days of decadence he could still point to a friend. It was  only some business alliance, underhand and stealthy; a social conspiracy, that  must needs be conducted in darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did papa summon me here if he wants his  acquaintance with this man kept secret?&rdquo; she asked herself; and the question  seemed unanswerable.</p>
<p>She pictured this M. Lenoble to herself &mdash; a  wizened, sallow-faced Macchiavellian individual, whose business in England must  needs be connected with conspiracy, treason, commercial fraud, anything or  everything stealthy and criminal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would let me go back to Bayswater  before this gentleman comes, papa,&rdquo; she said presently. &ldquo;I heard it strike  seven just now, and I know I shall be expected early. I can come again whenever  you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my love; you must stop to see my friend.  And now tell me a little about the Sheldons. Has anything been stirring since I  saw them last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing whatever, papa. Charlotte is very happy;  she always had a happy disposition, but she is gayer than ever since her  engagement with &mdash; Valentine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an absurd infatuation!&rdquo; muttered the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he &mdash; Valentine &mdash; is very good, and works very  hard at his literary profession &mdash; and loves her very dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It cost her an effort to say this even now, even  now when she fancied herself cured of that folly which had once been so sweet  to her. To speak of him like this &mdash; to put him away out of her own life, and  contemplate him as an element in the life of another &mdash; could not be done  without some touch of the old anguish.</p>
<p>There was a loud double-knock at the street-door as  she said this, and a step sounded presently in the passage; a quick, firm  tread. There was nothing stealthy about that, at any rate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend Lenoble,&rdquo; said the Captain; and in the  next instant a gentleman entered the room, a gentleman who was in every quality  the opposite of the person whom Diana had expected to see.</p>
<p>These speculative pictures are seldom good  portraits. Miss Paget had expected to find her father&rsquo;s ally small and  shrivelled, old and ugly, dried-up and withered in the fiery atmosphere of  fraud and conspiracy; in outward semblance a monkey, in soul a tiger. And  instead of this obnoxious creature there burst into the room a man of  four-and-thirty years of age, tall, stalwart, with a fair frank face, somewhat  browned by summer suns; thick auburn hair and beard, close trimmed and cropped  in the approved Gallic fashion &mdash; clear earnest blue eyes, and a mouth whose candour  and sweetness a moustache could not hide. Henry of Navarre, before the white  lilies of France had dazzled his eyes with their fatal splendour, before the  court of the Medici had taught the Bearnois to dissemble, before the sometime  Protestant champion had put on that apparel of stainless white in which he went  forth to stain his soul with the sin of a diplomatic apostasy.</p>
<p>Such a surprise as this makes a kind of crisis in  the eventless record of a woman&rsquo;s life. Diana found herself blushing as the  stranger stood near the door awaiting her father&rsquo;s introduction. She was  ashamed to think of the wrong her imagination had done him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter, Diana Paget &mdash; M. Lenoble. I have been  telling Diana how much I owed to your hospitality during my stay in Normandy,&rdquo;  continued the Captain, with his grandest air, &ldquo;I regret that I can only receive  you in an apartment quite unworthy the seigneur of C&ocirc;tenoir. &mdash; A charming  place, my dear Diana, which I should much like you to see on some future  occasion. &mdash; Will you take some tea, Lenoble? &mdash; Diana, a cup of tea. &mdash; The  Pagets are a fallen race, you see, my dear sir, and a cup of tea in a  lodging-house parlour is the best entertainment I can give to a friend. The  Cromie Pagets of Hertfordshire will give you dinner in gold plate, with a  footman standing behind the chair of every guest; but our branch is a younger  and a poorer one, and I, among others, am paying the price of youthful  follies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave Lenoble looked sympathetic, but the glance  of sympathy was directed to Diana, and not to the male representative of the  younger Pagets. To pity the distressed damsel was an attribute of the Lenoble  mind; and Gustave had already begun to pity Miss Paget, and to wonder what her  fate in life would be, with no better protector than a father who was  confessedly a pauper. He saw that the young lady was very handsome, and he  divined, from some indefinable expression of her face, that she was proud; and  as he thought of his own daughters, and their easy life and assured future, the  contrast seemed to him very cruel.</p>
<p>Chivalrous as the house of Lenoble might be by  nature, he could scarcely have felt so keen an interest in Captain Paget&rsquo;s  daughter at the first glance, if his sympathies had not been already enlisted  for her. The noble Horatio, though slow to act a father&rsquo;s part, had shown  himself quick to make capital out of his daughter&rsquo;s beauty and virtues when the  occasion offered.</p>
<p>In his intercourse with the seigneur of C&ocirc;tenoir,  which had developed from a mere business acquaintance into friendship, Captain  Paget had discoursed with much eloquence upon the subject of his motherless  daughter; and M. Lenoble, having daughters of his own, also motherless, lent  him the ear of sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard much of you, Miss Paget,&rdquo; said  Gustave presently, &ldquo;and of your devotion to your father. He has no more  favourite theme than your goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana blushed, and Diana&rsquo;s father blushed also.  That skilled diplomatist felt the awkwardness of the situation, and was prompt  to the rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my daughter has been a heroine.  There are Antigones, sir, who show their heroic nature by other service than  the leading to and fro of a blind father. From the earliest age my poor child  has striven to stand alone; too proud, too noble to be a burden on a parent  whose love would have given all, but whose means could give but little. And now  she comes to me from her home among strangers, to soothe my hour of pain and  infirmity. I trust your daughters may prove as worthy of your love, M.  Lenoble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are very dear girls,&rdquo; answered the Frenchman;  &ldquo;but for them life has been all sunshine. They have never known a sorrow except  the death of their mother. It is the storm that tests the temper of the tree. I  wish they might prove as noble in adversity as Miss Paget has shown herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was more than Diana could bear without some  kind of protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not take papa&rsquo;s praises <em>au pied de la lettre</em>, M. Lenoble,&rdquo; she  said; &ldquo;I have been by no means brave or patient under adversity. There are  troubles which one must bear. I have borne mine somehow; but I claim no praise  for having submitted to the inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was spoken with a certain noble pride which  impressed Gustave more than all the father&rsquo;s florid eloquence had done. After  this the conversation became less personal. M. Lenoble talked of England. It  was not his first visit; but he had only the excursionist&rsquo;s knowledge of the  British Isles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been to Scotland,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your Scotland  is grand, mountainous &mdash; all that there is of the most savage and poetic. It is  a Switzerland lined with Brittany. But that which most speaks to the heart of a  stranger is the peaceful beauty of your English landscape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like England, M. Lenoble?&rdquo; said Diana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I not reason? My mother was English. I was  only five years old when I lost her. She went out of my life like a dream; but  I can still recall a faint shadow of her face &mdash; an English face &mdash; a countenance  of placid sadness, very sweet and tender. But why do I talk of these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this the Frenchman&rsquo;s talk took a gayer turn.  This M. Lenoble showed himself a lively and agreeable companion. He talked of  Normandy, his daughters and their convent, his little son at Rouen, his aunt  Cydalise, the quiet old lady at Beaubocage; his grandfather, his grandmother,  the old servants, and everything familiar and dear to him. He told of his  family history with boyish candour, untainted by egotism, and seemed much  pleased by Diana&rsquo;s apparent interest in his unstudied talk. He was quite  unconscious that the diplomatic Horatio was leading him on to talk of these  things, with a view to making the conversation supremely interesting to him.  That arch diplomatist knew that there is nothing a man likes better than  talking of his own affairs, if he can have a decent excuse for such discourse.</p>
<p>The clock struck nine while Diana was listening,  really interested. This glimpse of a life so far apart from her own was a  relief, after the brooding introspective reveries which of late had constituted  so large a portion of her existence. She started up at the sound of the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now, Cinderella?&rdquo; cried her father. &ldquo;Have you  stopped beyond your time, and will your fairy godmother be angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one will be angry, papa; but I did not mean to  stay so late. I am sorry your description of Normandy has been so interesting,  M. Lenoble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and see Vevinord and C&ocirc;tenoir, and you will  judge for yourself. The town-hall of Vevinord is almost as fine as that of  Louvain; and we have a church that belongs to the time of Dagobert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall see them before long,&rdquo; said the Captain;  &ldquo;I shall have business in Rouen again before the next month is out; and if my  daughter is a good girl, I will take her over there with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana stared at her father in utter bewilderment.  What could be the meaning of this sudden display of affection?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not be free to go with you, papa, even if  you were able to take me,&rdquo; she replied, somewhat coldly; &ldquo;I have other duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She felt assured that there was some lurking  motive, some diplomatic art at the bottom of the Captain&rsquo;s altered conduct, and  she could not altogether repress her scorn. The astute Horatio saw that he had  gone a little too far, and that his only child was not of the stuff to be  moulded at will by his dexterous hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will come and see me again, Diana?&rdquo; he said in  a pleading tone: &ldquo;I am likely to be a prisoner in this room for a week or  more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, papa; I will come if you wish it. When  shall I come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let me see &mdash; to-day is Thursday; can you  come on Monday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will come on Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cab was procured, and Miss Paget was conducted to  that vehicle by her new acquaintance, who showed a gallant anxiety for her  comfort on the journey, and was extremely careful about the closing of the  windows. She arrived at Bayswater before ten, but being forbidden to talk of M.  Lenoble, could give but a scanty account of her evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was your papa kind, dear?&rdquo; asked Charlotte,  &ldquo;and did he seem pleased to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was much kinder and more affectionate than  usual, Lotta dear; so much so, that he set me wondering. Now, if I were as  confiding and eager to think well of people as you are, I should be quite  delighted by this change. As it is, I am only mystified. I should be very glad  if my father and I could be drawn closer together; very glad if my influence  could bring about an amendment in his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Miss Paget was discussing her father&rsquo;s  affectionate and novel behaviour, the noble Horatio was meditating, by his  solitary hearth, upon the events of the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m half-inclined to think he&rsquo;s hit already,&rdquo;  mused the Captain. &ldquo;I must not allow myself to be deluded by manner. A  Frenchman&rsquo;s gallantry rarely means much; but Lenoble is one of those  straightforward fellows whose thoughts may be read by a child. He certainly  seemed pleased with her; interested and sympathetic, and all that kind of  thing. And she is an uncommonly handsome girl, and might marry any one if she  had the opportunity. I had no idea she was so handsome until to-night. I  suppose I never noticed her by candlelight before. By Jove! I ought to have  made her an actress, or singer, or something of that kind. And so I might, if  I&rsquo;d known her face would light up as it does. I wish she wasn&rsquo;t so  impracticable &mdash; always cutting in with some awkward speech, that makes me look  like a fool, when, if she had an ounce of common sense, she might see that I&rsquo;m  trying to make her fortune. Yes, egad, and such a fortune as few girls drop  into now-a-days! Some of your straitlaced church-going people would call me a  neglectful father to that girl, I daresay; but I think if I succeed in making  her the wife of Gustave Lenoble, I shall have done my duty in a way that very  few fathers can hope to surpass. Such a high-principled fellow as Lenoble is  too! &mdash; and <em>that</em> is a consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  &ldquo;What Do We Here, My Heart And I?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>After that first summons to Chelsea, Diana went  many times &mdash; twice and three times a week &mdash; to comfort and tend her invalid  father. Captain Paget&rsquo;s novel regard for his only child seemed to increase with  the familiarity of frequent intercourse. &ldquo;I have had very great pleasure in  making your acquaintance, my dear Diana,&rdquo; he said one day, in the course of a <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> with his daughter; &ldquo;and I am  charmed to find you everything that a well-born and well-bred young woman ought  to be. I am sure you have excellent reason to be grateful to your cousin,  Priscilla Paget, for the excellent education you received in her abode; and you  have some cause to thank me for the dash and style imparted to your carriage  and manner by our foreign wanderings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain said this with the air of a man who had  accompanied his daughter on the grand tour solely with a view to her  intellectual improvement. He really thought she had reason to be grateful to  him for those accidents of his nomadic life which had secured her a good accent  for French and German, and the art of putting on her shawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear child,&rdquo; he continued with dignity,  &ldquo;it affords me real gratification to know you better. I need scarcely say that  when you were the associate of my pilgrimage, you were not of an age to be  available as a companion. To a man of the world like myself, a young person who  has not done growing must always savour somewhat of the schoolroom and the  nursery. I am not going to repeat the Byronic impertinence about  bread-and-butter; but the society of a girl of the hobbledehoy age is apt to be  insipid. You are now a young woman, and a young woman of whom any father might  with justice be proud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few such speeches as these, Diana began to  think that it was just possible her father might really experience some novel  feeling of regard for her. It might be true that his former coldness had been  no more than a prejudice against the awkwardness of girlhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was shabby and awkward, I daresay, in those  days,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;and then I was always asking papa for money to buy new  clothes; and that may have set him against me. And now that I am no burden upon  him, and can talk to him and amuse him, he may feel more kindly disposed  towards me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some foundation for this idea. Captain  Paget had felt himself more kindly disposed towards his only child from the  moment in which she ceased to be an encumbrance upon him. Her sudden departure  from For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne had been taken in very good part by him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very spirited thing for her to do, Val,&rdquo; he had  said, when informed of the fact by Mr. Hawkehurst; &ldquo;and by far the best thing  she could do, under the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that time his daughter had never asked him for  a sixpence, and from that time she had risen steadily in his estimation. But  the feeling which he now exhibited was more than placid approval; it was an  affection at once warm and exacting. The fact was, that Horatio Paget saw in  his daughter the high-road to the acquirement of a handsome competence for his  declining years. His affection was sincere so far as it went; a sentiment  inspired by feelings purely mercenary, but not a hypocritical assumption. Diana  was, therefore, so much the more likely to be softened and touched by it.</p>
<p>She was softened, deeply touched by this late  awakening of feeling. The engagement of Valentine and Charlotte had left her  own life very blank, very desolate. It was not alone the man she loved who was  lost to her; Charlotte, the friend, the sister, seemed also slipping away from  her. As kind, as loving, as tender as of old, this dear friend and adopted  sister still might be, but no longer wholly her own. Over the hearts of the  purest Eros reigns with a too despotic power, and mild affection is apt to  sneak away into some corner of the temple on whose shrine Love has descended.  This mild affection is but a little twinkling taper, that will burn steadily  on, perhaps unseen amidst the dazzling glory of Love&rsquo;s supernal lamp, to be  found shining benignantly when the lamp is shattered.</p>
<p>For Charlotte, Valentine &mdash; and for Valentine,  Charlotte &mdash; made the sum-total of the universe at this time; or, at best, there  was but a small balance which included all the other cares and duties,  affections and pleasures, of life. Of this balance Diana had the lion&rsquo;s share;  but she felt that things had changed since those days of romantic school-girl  friendship in which Charlotte had talked of never marrying, and travelling with  her dearest friend Diana amongst all the beautiful scenes they had read of,  until they found the loveliest spot in the world, where they would establish  themselves in an ideal cottage, and live together for the rest of their lives,  cultivating their minds and their flower-garden, working berlin-wool chairs for  their ideal drawing-room, and doing good to an ideal peasantry, who would be  just poor enough to be interesting, and sickly enough to require frequent gifts  of calf&rsquo;s-foot jelly and green tea.</p>
<p>Those foolish dreams were done with now; and that  other dream, of a life to be spent with the reckless companion of her girlhood,  was lost to Diana Paget. There was no point to which she could look forward in  the future, no star to lure her onward upon life&rsquo;s journey. Her present  position was sufficiently comfortable; and she told herself that she must needs  be weak and wicked if she were not content with her lot. But beyond the present  she dared not look, so blank was the prospect &mdash; a desert, without even the  mirage; for her dreams and delusions were gone with her hope.</p>
<p>Possessed by such a sense of loneliness, it is  scarcely strange if there seemed to her a gleam of joy, a faint glimmer of  hope, in the newly awakened affection of her father. She began to believe him,  and to take comfort from the thought that he was drifting to a haven where he might  lie moored, with other battered old hulks of pirate and privateer, inglorious  and at rest. To work for him and succour him in his declining years seemed a  brighter prospect to this hopeless woman of four-and-twenty than a future of  lonely independence. &ldquo;It is the nature of woman to lean,&rdquo; says the masculine  philosopher; but is it not rather her nature to support and sustain, or else  why to her is entrusted the sublime responsibility of maternity? Diana was  pleased to think that a remorseful reprobate might be dependent on her toil,  and owe his reformation to her influence. She was indeed a new Antigone, ready  to lead him in his moral blindness to an altar of atonement more pure than the  ensanguined shrine of the Athenian Eumenides.</p>
<p>Her visits to Omega Street were not entirely  devoted to <em>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;tes</em> with her  father. By reason of those coincidences which are so common to the lives of  some people, it generally happened that M. Lenoble dropped in upon his invalid  friend on the very day of Miss Paget&rsquo;s visit. M. Lenoble was in London on  business, and this business apparently necessitated frequent interviews with  Captain Paget. Of course such interviews could not take place in the presence  of Diana. Gustave was wont, therefore, to wait with praiseworthy patience until  the conclusion of the young lady&rsquo;s visit; and would even, with an inconsistent  gallantry, urge her to prolong her stay to its utmost limit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will always be time for my affairs, Miss  Paget,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;and I know how your father values your society; and he well  may value it. I only hope my daughters will be as good to me, if I have the  gout, by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana had spent nearly a dozen evenings in Omega  Street, and on each of those evenings had happened to meet M. Lenoble. She  liked him better on every occasion of these accidental meetings. He was indeed  a person whom it was difficult for any one to dislike, and in the thirty-four  years of his life had never made an enemy. She had been pleased with him on the  first evening; his bright handsome face, his courteous reverence for her sex &mdash;  expressed in every word, every tone, every look &mdash; his sympathy with all good  thoughts, his freshness and candour, were calculated to charm the coldest and  most difficult of judges. Diana liked, and even admired him, but it was from an  abstract point of view. He seemed a creature as remote from her own life as a  portrait of Henry of Navarre, seen and admired in some royal picture-gallery  to-day, to fade out of her memory to-morrow.</p>
<p>There was only one point in connection with Gustave  Lenoble which occupied her serious thoughts; and this was the nature of his  relations with her father.</p>
<p>This was a subject that sorely troubled her. Hope  as she might for the future, she could not shut her eyes to the past. She knew  that her father had lived for years as a cheat and a trickster &mdash; now by one  species of falsehood and trickery, now by another &mdash; rarely incautious, but  always unscrupulous. How had this village seigneur of Normandy fallen into the  Captain&rsquo;s toils; and what was the nature of the net that was spread for him?</p>
<p>The talk of business, the frequent interviews, the  evident elation of her father&rsquo;s spirits, combined to assure her that some great  scheme was in progress, some commercial enterprise, perhaps not entirely  dishonest &mdash; nay even honest, when regarded from the sanguine speculator&rsquo;s point  of view, but involving the hazard of Gustave Lenoble&rsquo;s fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite as easy for my father to delude  himself as it is for him to delude others. This M. Lenoble is ignorant of English  commerce, no doubt, and will be ready to believe anything papa tells him. And  he is so candid, so trusting, it would be very hard if he were to be a loser  through his confidence in papa. His daughters, too; the hazard of his fortune  is peril to their future.&rdquo; Such doubts and fears, gradually developed by  reflection took stronger hold on Miss Paget&rsquo;s mind after every fresh visit to  Omega Street. She saw the Frenchman&rsquo;s light-hearted confidence in all humanity,  her father&rsquo;s specious manner and air of quixotic honour. His sanguine tone, his  excellent spirits, filled her with intolerable alarm. Alas! when had she ever  seen her father in good spirits, except when some gentlemanly villany was in  progress?</p>
<p>Miss Paget endured this uneasiness of mind as long  as she could, and then determined to warn the supposed victim. She planned the  mode of her warning, and arranged for herself a diplomatic form which would  reflect the least possible discredit upon her father; and having once come to  this resolution, she was not slow to put it into effect.</p>
<p>When her father was about to send for a cab to  convey her back to Bayswater, after her next visit to Omega Street, she  surprised him by intercepting his order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a cab-stand in Sloane Square, papa,&rdquo; she  said; &ldquo;and if M.
  Lenoble will be so kind as to take me there, I &mdash; I would rather get the
  cab from the stand. The man charges more when he is fetched off the rank,
  I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could think of no better excuse for seeing  Gustave alone than this most sordid pretence. She blushed as she thought how  mean a sound it must have in the ears of the man for whose advantage she was  plotting. Happily M. Lenoble was not among the people who see nothing but  meanness in the desire to save sixpence. His aunt Cydalise had shown him the loveliness  of poverty; for there are vows of holy poverty that need no spoken formula, and  that are performed without the cloister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; thought M. Lenoble; &ldquo;I dare say even  the cost of her coach is a consideration with her; and one dare not pay the  coachman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was how Gustave read that blush of shame which  for a moment dyed
  Diana&rsquo;s cheek. Her father&rsquo;s was a very different reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The minx sees my game, and is playing into my  hands,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;So demure as she is, too! I should never have supposed her  capable of such a clever manoeuvre to secure ten minutes&rsquo; <em>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</em> with an eligible admirer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bade his daughter good night with more than  usual effusion. He began to think that she might prove herself worthy of him  after all.</p>
<p>The district between Omega Street and Sloane Square  is after dusk of all places the most solitary. It is the border-land of  Pimlico, or, to borrow from Sidney Smith, the knuckle end of Belgravia. In  these regions of desolation and smoke-blackened stucco Diana and her companion  were as secure from the interruption of the jostling crowd as they might have  been in the primeval forests of Central America.</p>
<p>Miss Paget&rsquo;s task was not a pleasant one. Shape her  warning as she might, it must reflect some discredit upon her father. He had of  late been kind to her; she felt this keenly to-night, and it seemed that the  thing she was about to do was a sort of parricide. Not against her father&rsquo;s  life was her cruel hand to be lifted; but her still more cruel tongue was to  slay her father&rsquo;s good name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This M. Lenoble likes him and trusts him,&rdquo; she  thought to herself. &ldquo;What a happiness for that poor broken-down old man to have  so kind a friend! And I am going to interfere in a manner that may put an end  to this friendship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the shape which her thoughts assumed as she  walked silently by Gustave&rsquo;s side, with her hand lying lightly on his arm. He  spoke to her two or three times about the dulness of the neighbourhood, the  coldness of the night, or some other equally thrilling subject; but, finding by  her replies that she was thinking deeply, he made no further attempt at  conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child! she has some trouble on her mind,  perhaps,&rdquo; he thought to himself sadly, for his sympathy with this young lady  was a very profound feeling. This was the first occasion on which he had ever  been alone with her, and he wondered to find what a strange emotion was  developed by the novelty of the situation. He had married at twenty years of  age, and had never known those brief fancies or foolish passions which waste  the freshness of mind and heart. He had married a wife whom he never learned to  love; but his nature was so essentially a happy one, that he had failed to  discover the something wanting in his life. In all relations &mdash; as grandson,  husband, father, master &mdash; he had been &ldquo;all simply perfect,&rdquo; as Mademoiselle  Cydalise pronounced him; and in a mind occupied by cares for the welfare and  happiness of others, he had never found that blank which needed to be filled in  order to make his own life completely happy. Only of late, in his thirty-fourth  year, had he come to the knowledge of a feeling deeper than dutiful regard for  an invalid wife, or affectionate solicitude for motherless children; only of  late had he felt his heart stirred by a more thrilling emotion than that placid  resignation to the will of Providence which had distinguished his courtship of  Mademoiselle de N&eacute;rague.</p>
<p>They had nearly reached Sloane Square before Diana  took courage to broach the subject so naturally repugnant to her. She had need  to remember that the welfare of M. Lenoble and all belonging to him might be  dependent on her fortitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Lenoble,&rdquo; she began at last, &ldquo;I am going to say  something I shall find it most painful to utter, but which I feel it my duty to  say to you. I can only ask you to receive it in a generous spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Miss Paget, I pray you not to say  anything that is disagreeable to you. Why should you give yourself pain? &mdash;  why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is my duty to warn you of a danger  which I know only too well, and of which you may be quite ignorant. You are my  father&rsquo;s friend, M. Lenoble; and he has very few friends. I should be sorry if  anything I were to say should rob him of your regard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that you say shall rob him of my  friendship. But why should you persist thus to say anything that is painful?  What can you tell me that I do not know, or that I cannot guess? Will you tell  me that he is poor? But I know it. That he is a broken-down gentleman? And that  also I know. What, then, would you tell me? That he has a daughter who is to  him a treasure without price? Ah, mademoiselle, what must I be if I did not  know that also? &mdash; I, who have contemplated that daughter so many times &mdash; ah, so  many! &mdash; when she could not know with what sympathy my eyes watched her dutiful  looks, with what profound emotion my heart interpreted her life of affectionate  sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a warmth, a tenderness in his tones which  touched Diana&rsquo;s heart as it had not been touched of late. Suddenly,  unexpectedly, the full meaning of those tender accents came home to her. The  love that she had once dreamed of from the lips of another spoke to her  to-night in the words of this stranger. The sympathy for which she had yearned  long ago, in the days of her wanderings with Valentine, was given to her  to-night without stint or measure. Unhappily it came too late; and it did not  come from the only lips which, as it seemed to her to-night, could make  sympathy precious or love divine. But to this lonely girl a good man&rsquo;s  affection seemed a treasure for which she must needs be deeply grateful. It was  something to discover that she could be loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I too,&rdquo; she said to herself,&mdash; &ldquo;I, of whose presence  Valentine is scarcely conscious when he enters a room where Charlotte and I are  together; I, whom he greets day after day with the same careless words, the  same indifferent look; I, who might fade and waste day by day with some slow  disease, until I sank into the grave, before he would be conscious of any  change in my face, &mdash; is it possible that amongst the same race of beings there  can be any creature so widely different from Valentine Hawkehurst as to love <em>me</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the bitter complaint of her heart as she  compared the tenderness of this stranger with the indifference of the man to  whom, for three long years of her girlhood, she had given every dream, every  thought, every hope of her existence. She could not put him away from her heart  all at once. The weak heart still fondly clung to the dear familiar image. But  the more intensely she had felt the cold neglect of Valentine, the more  grateful to her seemed the unsought affection of Gustave Lenoble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know me as little as you know my father, M.  Lenoble,&rdquo; she said, after a long pause, during which they had walked to the end  of the long dull street, and were close to the square. &ldquo;Let us go back a little  way, please; I have much more to say. I wish you to be my father&rsquo;s friend  always, but, if possible, without danger to yourself. My father is one of those  sanguine people who are always ready to embark in some new enterprise, and who  go on hoping and dreaming, after the failure of a dozen schemes. He has no  money, that I know of, to lose himself, and that fact may make him,  unconsciously, reckless of other people&rsquo;s money. I have heard him speak of business  relations with you, M. Lenoble, and it is on that account I venture to speak so  plainly. I do not want my poor father to delude you, as he has often deluded  himself. If you have already permitted him to involve you in any speculation, I  entreat you to try to withdraw from it &mdash; to lose a little money, if necessary,  rather than to lose all. If you are not yet involved, let my warning save you  from any hazard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Paget, I thank you a thousand times  for your advice, your noble thoughtfulness for others. But no, there is no  hazard. The business in which your father is occupied for me is not a  speculation. It involves no risk beyond the expenditure of a few thousand  francs, which, happily, I can afford to lose. I am not at liberty to tell you  the nature of the business in question, because I have promised your father to  keep that a secret. Dear young lady, you need have no fear for me. I am not a  rash speculator. The first years of my life were passed in extreme poverty &mdash;  the poverty that is near neighbour to starvation. That is a lesson one cannot  forget. How shall I thank you for your concern for me? &mdash; so generous, so  noble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only my duty to warn you of my poor  father&rsquo;s weakness,&rdquo; replied Diana. &ldquo;If I needed thanks, your kindness to him is  the only boon I could ask. He has bitter need of a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he shall never lack one while I live, if only  for your sake.&rdquo; The last half of the sentence was spoken in lower tones than  the first. Diana was conscious of the lurking tenderness of those few words,  and the consciousness embarrassed her. Happily they had reached the end of the  quiet street by this time, and had emerged into the busier square. No more was  said till they reached the cab-stand, when Diana wished her companion good  night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going back to Normandy in a week, Miss Paget;  shall I see you again before I leave England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know; our meetings are generally  accidental, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, of course, always accidental,&rdquo; replied  Gustave, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you are going to leave London &mdash; for  papa&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, too, am sorry &mdash; for my own sake. But, you  see, when one has daughters, and a farm, and a chateau, one must be on the  spot. I came to England for one week only, and I have stayed six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have found so much to amuse you in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, mademoiselle, so much to interest me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is almost the same thing, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand times no! To be amused and to be  interested &mdash; ah, what can be so widely different as those two conditions of  mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Good night, Mr. Lenoble. Please ask the  cabman to drive as fast as he can venture to do with consideration for his  horse. I am afraid I shall be late, and my friends will be anxious about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be late. You consider your friends at  Bayswater, and you consider even the cabman&rsquo;s horse. You are charity itself.  Will you not consider me a little also, Miss Paget?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see you before I go back to Normandy. Your  papa likes to see you twice a week, I know. This is Monday night; will you come  to see him on Thursday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he wishes it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does wish it. Ah, how he wishes it! You will  come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mrs. Sheldon and Charlotte can spare me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cannot spare you. No one can spare you. That  cannot be. It is amongst the things that are impossible. But they will have  pity upon &mdash; your father, and they will let you come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please ask the cabman to start. Indeed, I shall be  late. Good night,
  M. Lenoble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand in his, and kissed it, with the  grace of a Bayard. He loved her, and took no trouble to conceal his passion. No  shadow of doubt darkened that bright horizon to which M. Lenoble looked with  hopeful eyes. He loved this penniless, motherless girl, as it was in the blood  of the Lenobles to love the poor and the helpless; especially when poverty and  helplessness presented themselves in the guise of youth and beauty. He loved  her, and she would love him. But why not? He was ten years her senior, but that  makes nothing. His auburn hair and beard, in the style of Henry the Great,  could show no streak of grey. His eyes had the brightness of one-and-twenty;  for the eyes of a man whose soul preserves its youthfulness will keep their  clear lustre for half a century. The tall figure, straight as a dart; the frank  handsome face which M. Lenoble saw in the glass when he made his toilet, were  not calculated to dishearten a hopeful lover; and Gustave, by nature sanguine,  enjoyed his dream of happiness, untroubled by one morbid apprehension.</p>
<p>He loved her, and he would ask her for his wife.  She would accept his offer; her father would rejoice in so fortunate an  alliance; her friends of Bayswater would felicitate a change so desirable. And  when he returned to Normandy he would take her with him, and say to his  children, &ldquo;Behold your mother!&rdquo; And then the great rambling mansion of C&ocirc;tenoir  would assume a home-like aspect. The ponderous old furniture would be replaced  by lightsome appointments of modern fashion; except, of course, in the grand  drawing-room, where there were tapestries said to be from the designs of  Boucher, and chairs and sofas in the true Louis Quinze style, of immovable  bulkiness.</p>
<p>There was but one trifling hitch in the whole  scheme of happiness &mdash; Diana was a Protestant. Ah, but what then! A creature so  sweet, so noble, could not long remain the slave of Anglican heresy. A little  talk with Cydalise, a week&rsquo;s &ldquo;retreat&rdquo; at the Sacr&eacute; Coeur, and the thing would  be done. The dear girl would renounce her errors, and enter the bosom of the  Mother Church. Pouff! M. Lenoble blew the little difficulty away from his  finger-tips, and then wafted a kiss from the same finger-tips to his absent  beloved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this noble heart warned me against her own  father!&rdquo; M. Lenoble said to himself, as he walked towards the hotel at  Blackfriars where he had taken up his abode, quite unconscious that the foot of  Blackfriars Bridge was not the centre of West End London. &ldquo;How noble, how  disinterested! Poor old man! He is, no doubt, a speculator &mdash; something even of  an Adventurer. What then? He shall have an apartment at C&ocirc;tenoir, his place at  the family table, his <em>fauteuil</em> by the  hearth; and there he can do no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>There was a strange sentiment in Diana&rsquo;s mind after  this evening&rsquo;s conversation with Gustave Lenoble. To feel herself beloved, to  know that there was some one creature in the wide crowded world interested in,  nay, even attached to her, was a mystery, a surprise, and in some sort a source  of pleasure to her. That Gustave Lenoble could ever be any nearer to her than  he was at the present time did not occur to her as being within the limits of  possibility. She had thrust Valentine from her heart, but the empty chamber  could receive no new tenant. It was not swept and garnished; nay, indeed, it  was sadly littered with the shreds and patches left by the late occupant. But,  while this was so, to know that she could be loved was in some manner sweet to  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, now I know that the poet is right,&rdquo; she said  to herself. &ldquo;There is no creature so desolate but some heart responds unto its  own. And I have found the generous responsive heart that can pity and love me  because I seem so sorely to need love and pity. All my life &mdash; my blank, empty  life &mdash; I will remember and be grateful to him, the first good man who ever  called my father friend; the first of all mankind who thought this poor hand  worthy to be lifted to his lips.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  Sharper Than A Serpent&rsquo;s Tooth</h2>
<p>Having pledged herself to visit Omega Street on  Thursday, Diana considered herself bound to perform that promise. She felt,  however, that there was some touch of absurdity in the position, for to keep a  promise so made was in a manner to keep an appointment with M. Lenoble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say he has a habit of falling in love with  every young woman he meets,&rdquo; she thought, when she considered his conduct from  a more prosaic standpoint than the grateful enthusiasm his generous sympathy  had at first awakened in her mind. &ldquo;I have heard that it is a Frenchman&rsquo;s  faculty to consider himself irresistible, and to avow his adoration for a new  divinity every week. And I was so foolish as to fancy there was a depth of  feeling in his tone and manner! I am sure he is all that is good and generous;  but the falling in love is no doubt a national failing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She remembered the impertinent advances of divers  unknown foreigners whom she had encountered on pier or <em>digue</em>, kursaal or beach, in the frequently unprotected hours of her  continental wanderings.</p>
<p>She had not seen the best side of the foreign mind  in her character of unattended and doubtfully attired English demoiselle. She  knew that Gustave Lenoble was of a very different stamp from those specimens of  the genus tiger whose impertinent admiration had often wounded and distressed  her; but she was inclined to attribute the fault of shallowness to a nature so  frank and buoyant as that of her father&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>She walked from Bayswater to Chelsea on the  appointed Thursday, for the cost of frequent journeys in cabs was more than her  purse could supply. The walk across the Park was pleasant even in the bleak  March weather, and she entered the little parlour in Omega Street with the  bloom of damask roses upon her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, papa dear?&rdquo; she began, as she came  into the dusky room; but the figure sitting in her father&rsquo;s accustomed place  was not that of her father. It was M. Lenoble, who rose to welcome her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is papa worse?&rdquo; she asked, surprised by the  Captain&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, he is better, and has gone out in  a hired carriage for a breath of fresh air. I persuaded him to go. He will be  back very shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote to tell him I should be here to-day, but I  am very glad he has gone out, for I am sure the air will do him good. Was he  well wrapped up, do you know, M. Lenoble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enveloped in railway-rugs and shawls to his very  nose. I arranged all that with my own hands. He looked like an ambassador from  all the Russias.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How kind of you to think of such things!&rdquo; said  Diana gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tell me why should I not think of such things?  Do you imagine that it is not a pleasure to me to wait upon your father &mdash; for  your sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some amount of awkwardness in this kind  of thing. Diana busied herself with the removal of her hat and jacket, which  she laid neatly upon a stony-hearted horsehair sofa. After doing this she  placed herself near the window, whence she contemplated the dusky street,  appearing much interested in the movements of the lamp lighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an admirable way they have of lighting the  lamps now,&rdquo; she remarked, with the conversational brilliance which usually  marks this kind of situation; &ldquo;how much more convenient it must be than the old  method with the ladder, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have no doubt,&rdquo; said Gustave, bringing  himself to her side with a couple of steps, and planting himself deliberately  in a chair next to hers; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t you think, as I start for Normandy to-morrow,  we might talk of something more interesting than the lamplighter, Miss Paget?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to talk of anything you like,&rdquo; replied  Miss Paget, with that charming assumption of unconsciousness which every woman  can command on these occasions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good. Do you know that when I  persuaded your father to go out for an airing, I was prompted by a motive so  selfish as to render the proceeding quite diabolical? Don&rsquo;t be alarmed! The  doctor gave his permission for the airing, or I should not have attempted such  a thing. Hypocrisy I am capable of, but not assassination. You cannot imagine  the diplomacy which I exhibited; and all to what end? Can you imagine that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I might secure one half-hour&rsquo;s uninterrupted  talk with you; and, unhappily, you are so late that I expect your father&rsquo;s  return every minute. He was to be back again before dusk, and the appearance of  the lamplighter demonstrates that the dusk has come. I have so much to say, and  so little time to say it; so much, Diane&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started as he called her thus, as if in that  moment of surprise she would have risen from her chair by his side. She knew  what was coming, and having expected nothing so desperate, knew not how to  arrest the confession that she would fain have avoided hearing. M. Lenoble laid  his hand firmly on hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much, Diane; and yet so little, that all can be  told in three words.
  I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Lenoble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are surprised, you wonder, you look at me  with eyes of sweet amazement! Dear angel, do you think it is possible to see  you and not to love you? To see you once is to respect, to admire, to bow the  knee before beauty and goodness; but to see you many times, as I have done, the  patient consoler of an invalid and somewhat difficult father &mdash; ah, my sweet love,  who is there so hard amongst mankind that he should escape from loving you,  seeing all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question had a significance that the speaker  knew not. Who amongst mankind? Why, was there not one man for whom she would  have been content to be the veriest slave that ever abnegated every personal  delight for the love of a hard master? And he had passed her by, indifferent,  unseeing. She had worshipped him on her knees, as it seemed to her; and he had  left her kneeling in the dust, while he went on to offer himself, heart and  soul, at another shrine.</p>
<p>She could not forget these things. The memory and  the bitterness of them came back with renewed poignancy at this moment, when  the voice of a stranger told her she was beloved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear one, will you not answer me?&rdquo; pleaded  Gustave, in nowise alarmed by Diana&rsquo;s silence, which seemed to him only the  natural expression of a maidenly emotion. &ldquo;Tell me that you will give me  measure for measure; that you will love me as my mother loved my father &mdash; with  a love that trouble and poverty could never lessen; with a love that was  strongest when fate was darkest &mdash; a star which the dreary night of sorrow could  not obscure. I am ten years older than you by my baptismal register, Diane; but  my heart is young. I never knew what love was until I knew you. And yet those  who know me best will tell you that I was no unkind husband, and that my poor  wife and I lived happily. I shall never know love again, except for you. The  hour comes, I suppose, in every man&rsquo;s life; and the angel of his life comes in  that appointed hour. Mine came when I saw you. I have spoken to your father,  and have his warm approval. He was all encouragement, and hinted that I might  be assured of your love. Had he sufficient justification for that half-promise,  Diane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had none,&rdquo; Miss Paget answered gravely, &ldquo;none  except his own wishes. You have made me hear more than I wished to hear, M.  Lenoble, for the treasure you offer me is one that I cannot accept. With all my  heart I thank you for the love you tell me of. Even if it is, as I can but  think it, a passing fancy, I thank you, nevertheless. It is sweet to win the  love of a good man. I pray you to believe that with all my heart and mind I  honour your generous nature, your noble sympathy with the weak and friendless.  If you can give me your friendship, you shall find how I can value a good man&rsquo;s  regard, but I cannot accept your love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Gustave, aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I cannot give you measure for measure, and  I will not give you less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in time, Diane, in time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time cannot show me your character in a nobler  light than that in which I see it now. You do not lack the power to win a  woman&rsquo;s heart, but I have no heart to give. If you will be my friend, time will  increase my affection for you &mdash; but time cannot restore the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means that your heart is dead, Diane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, with unutterable sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love some one younger, happier than I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, M. Lenoble, no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have loved? Yes! &mdash; a scoundrel, perhaps; a  villain, who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A spasm of pain contracted his face as he looked at  the girl&rsquo;s drooping head; her face, in that dim light, he could not see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me this, Diane,&rdquo; he said presently, in an  altered voice; &ldquo;there is no barrier between us &mdash; no irrevocable obstacle that must  part us for ever? There is no one who can claim you by any right&mdash;&rdquo; He paused;  and then added, in a lower voice, &ldquo;by any wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; answered Miss Paget, lifting her head,  and looking her lover full in the face. Even in that uncertain light he could  see the proud steady gaze that seemed the fittest answer of all doubts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Ah, how could I fear,  even for one moment, that you could be anything but what you seem &mdash; the purest  among the pure? Why, then, do you reject me? You do not love me, but you ask my  friendship; you offer me your friendship, even your affection. Ah, believe me,  if those are but real, time will ripen them into love. Your heart is dead. Ah,  why should that young heart be dead? It is not dead, Diane; it needs but the  fire of true love to warm it into life again. Why should you reject me, since  you tell me that you love me; unless you love another? What should divide us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shadows and memories,&rdquo; Diana replied  mournfully,&mdash; &ldquo;vague and foolish; wicked, perhaps; but they come between you and  me, M. Lenoble. And since I cannot give you a whole heart, I will give you  nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have loved some one, some one who did not  value your love? Tell me the truth, Diane; you owe me at least as much as  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do owe you the truth. Yes; I have been very  foolish. For two or three years of my life there was a person who was our daily  companion. He travelled with us &mdash; with my father and me; and we saw many  changes and troubles together. For a long time he was like my brother; and I  doubt if many brothers are as kind to their sisters as he was to me. In his  heart that feeling never changed. He was always equally kind, equally careless.  Once I deluded myself with the fancy that in his looks and tones, and even in  his words, there was some deeper feeling than this careless brotherly kindness;  but it was no more than a delusion. My eyes were opened rudely enough. I saw  his heart bestowed elsewhere. Do not think that I am so weak, or so wicked, as  to abandon myself to despair because I have been awakened from my foolish  dream. I can look the realities of life in the face, M. Lenoble; and I have  taught myself to wish all good things for the dear girl who has won the heart  that I once thought was mine. The person I am speaking of can boast no superior  graces of mind or person. He is only a very commonplace young man, with a  certain amount of talent, a disposition inclined to good rather than to evil.  But he was the companion of my girlhood; and in losing him it seems to me as if  I had lost a part of my youth itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Diana&rsquo;s mind this seemed the end of the  discussion. She expected M. Lenoble to bow his head to the inevitable, to utter  a friendly farewell, and depart for his Norman home, convinced, if not  satisfied. But the light-hearted, easy-tempered Gustave was not a lover of the  despairing order, nor an easily answered suppliant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is all!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in the cheeriest  tone. &ldquo;A companion of your girlhood, for whom you had a girl&rsquo;s romantic fancy!  And the memory of this unspeakable idiot &mdash; great Heaven! but how idiotic must  this wretch have been, to be loved by you, and not even to know it! &mdash; the  memory of this last of the last is to come between you and me, and divide us  for ever? The phantom of this miserable, who could be loved by an angel without  knowing it, is to lift its phantasmal hand and thrust me aside &mdash; me, Gustave  Lenoble, a man, and not an idiot? Ah, thus we blow him to the uttermost end of  the world!&rdquo; cried M. Lenoble, blowing an imaginary rival from the tips of his  fingers. &ldquo;Thus we dismiss him to the Arctic regions, the torrid zone &mdash; to the  Caucasus, where await vultures to gnaw his liver &mdash; wherever earth is most  remote and uncomfortable &mdash; he and the bread-and-butter miss whom he prefers to  my Diane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This manner of taking things was quite unexpected  by Diana. It was much more pleasant than gloomy despair or sullen resentment;  but it was, at the same time, much more difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone!&rdquo; cried Gustave presently; &ldquo;he is on  the topmost heights of Caucasus, and the vultures are sharpening their beaks!  And now, tell me, Diane &mdash; you will be my wife, will you not? You will be a  mother to my children? You will transform the old chateau of C&ocirc;tenoir into a  pleasant home? You will cease to live amongst strangers? You will come to those  who will love and cherish you as their own, their dearest and best and  brightest? You will give your poor old father a corner by your fireside? He is  old and needs a home for his last years. For his sake, Diane, for mine, for my  children, let your answer be yes! Ah, not so fast!&rdquo; he cried, as she was about  to speak. &ldquo;Why are you so quick to pronounce your fatal judgment? Think how  much depends on your reply &mdash; your father&rsquo;s happiness, my children&rsquo;s, mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of yours only I must think,&rdquo; Miss Paget  answered earnestly. &ldquo;You fancy it is so easy for me to say no. Believe me, it  would be much easier to say yes. When you speak of my father&rsquo;s declining years,  I, who know his weary life so well, would be hard of heart indeed if I were not  tempted by the haven you offer. Every word that you say gives me some new proof  of your goodness, your generosity. But I will not wrong you because you are  generous. I shall always be your grateful friend, but you must seek elsewhere  for a wife, M. Lenoble. You will have little difficulty in finding one worthier  than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will seek nowhere else for a wife; I will have  no wife but you. I have had a wife of other people&rsquo;s choosing; I will choose  one for myself this time. Let us be friends, Diane, since your decision is as  irrevocable as the laws of Draco. You are stone, you are adamant; but no  matter, we can be friends. Your father will be disappointed. But what then? He  is no doubt accustomed to disappointments. My daughters &mdash; for them it is a  profound affliction to be motherless, but they must support it. C&ocirc;tenoir must  go to wreck and ruin a little longer &mdash; a few more rats behind the panelling, a  few more moths in the tapestry, that is all. My children say, &lsquo;Papa, our home  is not comfortable; all is upside-down;&rsquo; and I reply. &lsquo;But what will you, my  children? A home without a wife is always upside down.&rsquo; And then I take them  between my arms, in weeping. It is a poignant picture to rend the heart. But  what does it matter, Miss Paget? What is that verse of your grand Will? &mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;Blow, blow, thou wintry wind;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;And let go weep the stricken land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While harts ungalled go play.</p>
<p>Perhaps I have mixed him up somehow; but the  meaning is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A hollow-sounding and somewhat awful cough heralded  the approach of Captain Paget, who entered the room at this juncture. If the  Captain had prolonged his first airing, after six weeks&rsquo; confinement to the  house, until this late period of the afternoon, he would have committed an  imprudence which might have cost him dearly. Happily, he had done nothing of  the kind, but had re-entered the house unobserved, while Diana and Gustave were  conversing close to the window, having preferred to leave his fly at the end of  the street, rather than to incur the hazard of interrupting a critical  t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te. The interval that had elapsed since his return had been spent by  the Captain in his own bedchamber, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the  folding-doors between that apartment and the parlour. What he had heard had  been by no means satisfactory to him; and if a look could annihilate, Miss  Paget might have perished beneath the Parthian glance which her father shot at  her as he came towards the window, with a stereotyped smile upon his lips and  unspeakable anger in his heart.</p>
<p>He had heard just enough of the conversation to  know that Gustave had been rejected &mdash; Gustave, with C&ocirc;tenoir and a handsome  independence in the present, and the late John Haygarth&rsquo;s fortune in the  future. Rejected by a penniless young woman, who at any moment might find herself  without a roof to shelter her from the winds of heaven! Was ever folly,  madness, wickedness supreme as this?</p>
<p>Horatio trembled with rage as he took his  daughter&rsquo;s hand. She had the insolence to extend her hand for the customary  salutation. The Captain&rsquo;s greeting was a grip that made her wince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Miss Paget,&rdquo; said Gustave gravely, but  with by no means the despondent tone of a hopeless lover; &ldquo;I &mdash; well, I shall  see you again, perhaps, before I go to Normandy. I doubt if I shall go  to-morrow. I have my own reasons for staying &mdash; unreasonable reasons, perhaps,  but I shall stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was said in a tone too low to reach  Captain Paget&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to leave us, Lenoble?&rdquo; he asked in a  quavering voice. &ldquo;You will not stop and let Di give you a cup of tea as usual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night, Captain. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrung the old man&rsquo;s hand and departed. Captain  Paget dropped heavily into a chair, and for some minutes there was silence.  Diana was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad your doctor considered you well enough  to go out for a drive, papa,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, my dear,&rdquo; answered her father with a  groan; &ldquo;I hope my next drive may be in a different kind of vehicle &mdash; the last  journey I shall ever take, until they cart away my bones for manure. I believe  they do make manure from the bones of paupers in our utilitarian age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, how can you talk so horribly! You are  better, are you not? M.
  Lenoble said you were better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am better, God help me!&rdquo; answered the old  man, too weak alike in mind and body to hide the passion that possessed, him.  &ldquo;That is one of the contradictions of the long farce we call life. If I had  been a rich man, with a circle of anxious relations and all the noted men of  Savile Row dancing attendance round my bed, I dare say I should have died; but  as I happen to be a penniless castaway, with only a lodging-house drudge and a  half-starved apothecary to take care of me, and with nothing before me but a  workhouse, I live. It is all very well for a man to take things easily when he  is ill and helpless, too weak even to think. <em>That</em> is not the trying time. The real trial arrives when a little  strength comes back to him, and his landlady begins to worry him for her rent,  and the lodging-house drudge gets tired of pitying him, and the apothecary  sends in his bill, and the wretched high-road lies bare and broad before him,  and he hears the old order to move on. The moving-on time has come for me, Di;  and the Lord alone knows how little I know where I am to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, you are not friendless; even I can give you  a little help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Captain with a bitter laugh; &ldquo;a  sovereign once a quarter &mdash; the scrapings of your pittance! That help won&rsquo;t save  me from the workhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is M. Lenoble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is M. Lenoble; the man who would have  given me a home for my old age: he told me so to-day &mdash; a home fit for a  gentleman &mdash; for the position he now occupies is nothing compared to that which  he may occupy a year hence. He would have received me as his father-in-law,  without thought or question of my antecedents; and if I have not lived like a  gentleman, I might have died like one. This is what he would have done for me.  But do you think I can ask anything of him now, after you have refused him? I  know of your refusal to be that man&rsquo;s wife. I heard &mdash; I saw it in his face. You  &mdash; a beggar, a friendless wretch, dependent on the patronage of a stockbroker&rsquo;s  silly wife &mdash; <em>you</em> must needs give  yourself grand airs, and refuse such a man as that! Do you think such men go  begging among young ladies like you, or that they run about the streets, like  the roast pigs in the story, begad, with knives and forks in their backs,  asking to be eaten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain was walking up and down the room in a  fever of rage. Diana looked at him with sad wondering eyes. Yes, it was the old  selfish nature. The leopard cannot change his spots; and the Horatio Paget of  the present was the Horatio Paget of the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t be angry with me, papa,&rdquo; said Diana  sorrowfully; &ldquo;I believe that I have done my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done your fiddlesticks!&rdquo; cried the Captain, too  angry to be careful of his diction. &ldquo;Your duty to whom? Did you happen to  remember, miss, that you owe some duty to me, your father, but for whom you  wouldn&rsquo;t be standing there talking of duty like a tragedy queen? By Jove! I  suppose you are too grand a person to consider my trouble in this matter; the  pains I took to get Lenoble over to England; the way I made the most of my gout  even, in order to have you about me; the way I finessed and diplomatized to  bring this affair to a successful issue. And now, when I have succeeded beyond  my hopes, you spoil everything, and then dare to stand before me and preach  about duty. What do you want in a husband, I should like to know? A rich man?  Lenoble is that. A handsome man? Lenoble is that. A gentleman, with good blood  in his veins? Lenoble comes of as pure a race as any man in that part of  France. A good man? Lenoble is one of the best fellows upon this earth. What is  it, then, that you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to give my heart to the man who gives me  his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what, in the name of all that&rsquo;s preposterous,  is to prevent you giving Gustave Lenoble your heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor any one else. But let us have no more of  this nonsense. If you call yourself a daughter of mine, you will marry Gustave  Lenoble. If not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain found himself brought to a sudden stop  in his unconscious paraphrase of Signor Capulet&rsquo;s menace to his recalcitrant  daughter, Juliet. With what threat could the noble Horatio terrify his daughter  to obedience? Before you talk of turning your rebellious child out of doors,  you must provide a home from which to cast her. Captain Paget remembered this,  and was for the moment reduced to sudden and ignominious silence. And yet there  must surely be some way of bringing this besotted young woman to reason.</p>
<p>He sat for some minutes in silence, with his head  leaning on his hand, his face hidden from Diana. This silence, this attitude,  so expressive of utter despondency, touched her more keenly than his anger. She  knew that he was mean and selfish, that it was of his own loss he thought; and  yet she pitied him. He was old and helpless and miserable; so much the more  pitiable because of his selfishness and meanness. For the heroic soul there is  always some comfort; but for the grovelling nature suffering knows no  counterbalance. The ills that flesh is heir to seem utterly bitter when there  is no grand spirit to dominate the flesh, and soar triumphant above the regions  of earthly pain. Captain Paget&rsquo;s mind, to him, was not a kingdom. He could not  look declining years of poverty in the face; he was tired of work. The schemes  and trickeries of his life were becoming very odious to him; they were for the  most part worn out, and had ceased to pay. Of course he had great hopes, in any  event, from Gustave Lenoble; but those hopes were dependent on Gustave&rsquo;s  inheritance of John Haygarth&rsquo;s estate. He wanted something more tangible than  this &mdash; he wanted immediate security; and his daughter&rsquo;s marriage with Gustave  would have given him that security, and still grander hopes for the future. He  had fancied himself reigning over the vassals of C&ocirc;tenoir, a far more important  personage than the real master of that ch&acirc;teau. He had pictured to himself a <em>pied-&agrave;-terre</em> in Paris which it might be  agreeable for him to secure, for existence in Normandy might occasionally prove <em>ennuyeux</em>. These things were what he  meant when he talked of a haven for his declining years; and against the  daughter who, for some caprice of her own, could hinder his possession of these  things, he had no feeling but anger.</p>
<p>Diana compassionated this weak old man, to whose  lips the cup of prosperity had seemed so near, from whose lips her hand had  thrust it. He had been promised a home, comfort, respectability,  friendship&mdash; &ldquo;all that should accompany old age&rdquo; &mdash; and she had prevented the  fulfilment of the promise. Heaven knows how pure her motives had been; but as  she watched that drooping head, with its silvered hair, she felt that she had  been cruel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; she began presently, laying her hand  caressingly upon her father&rsquo;s neck; but he pushed aside the timid, caressing  hand&mdash; &ldquo;papa, you think me very unkind, only because I have done what I believe  to be right; indeed it is so, papa dear. In what I said to Gustave Lenoble this  evening, I was governed only by my sense of right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried the Captain, with a strident laugh;  &ldquo;and where did you pick up your sense of right, madam, I should like to know?  From what Methodist parson&rsquo;s hypocritical twaddle have you learnt to lay down  the law to your poor old father about the sense of right? &lsquo;Honour your father  and your mother, that your days may be long in the land,&rsquo; miss, <em>that&rsquo;s</em> what your Bible teaches you; but  the Bible has gone out of fashion, I dare say, since I was a young man; and your  model young woman of the present generation taunts her father with her sense of  right. Will your sense of right be satisfied when you hear of your father  rotting in the old-men&rsquo;s ward of a workhouse, or dying on the London stones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not unfeeling, papa. With all my heart I pity  you; but it is cruel on your part to exaggerate the misery of your position, as  I am sure you must be doing. Why should your means of living fail because I  refuse to marry M. Lenoble? You have lived hitherto without my help, as I have  lived of late without yours. Nothing could give me greater happiness than to  know that you were exempt from care; and if my toil can procure you a peaceful  home in the future &mdash; as I believe it can, or education and will to work must go  for nothing &mdash; there shall be no lack of industry on my part. I will work for  you, I will indeed, papa &mdash; willingly, happily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When your work can give me such a home as C&ocirc;tenoir  &mdash; a home that one word of yours would secure for me &mdash; I will thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will only wait, papa, if you will only have  patience&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience! Wait! Do you know what you are talking  about? Do you prate of patience, and waiting, and hope in the future to a man  who has no future &mdash; to a man whose days are numbered, and who feels the  creeping chills of death stealing over him every day as he sits beside his  wretched hearth, or labours through his daily drudgery? I can live as I have  always lived! Yes; but do you know, or care to know, that with every day life  becomes more difficult for me? Your fine friends at Bayswater have done with  me. I have spent the last sixpence I shall ever see from Philip Sheldon.  Hawkehurst has cut me, like the ungrateful hound he is. When they have squeezed  the orange, they throw away the rind. Didn&rsquo;t Voltaire say that, when Frederick  of Prussia gave him the go-by? Heaven knows it&rsquo;s true enough; and now you, who  by a word might secure yourself a splendid position &mdash; yes, I say splendid for a  poor drudge and dependent like you, and insure a home for me &mdash; you, forsooth, must  needs favour me with your high-flown sentiments about your sense of right, and  promise me a home in the future, if I will wait and hope! No, Diana, waiting  and hoping are done with for me, and I can find a home in the bed of the river  without your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not be so wicked as to do that!&rdquo; cried  Diana, aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the wickedness of the act. But,  rely upon it, when my choice lies between the workhouse and the river, I shall  prefer the river. The modern workhouse is no inviting sanctuary, and I dare say  many a homeless wretch makes the same choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some minutes there was silence. Diana stood  with her elbows resting on the chimneypiece, her face covered with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lord, teach me to do the thing which is right!&rdquo;  she prayed, and in the next breath acted on the impulse of the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have me do?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What any one but an idiot would do of her own  accord &mdash; accept the good fortune that has dropped into your lap. Do you think  such luck as yours goes begging every day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have me accept Gustave Lenoble&rsquo;s offer,  no matter what falsehoods may be involved in my acceptance of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see no reason for falsehood. Any one but an  idiot would honour such a man; any one but an idiot would thank Providence for  such good fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, papa,&rdquo; exclaimed Diana, with a laugh  that had no mirthful music, &ldquo;I will not be the exceptional idiot. If M. Lenoble  does me the honour to repeat his offer &mdash; and I think from his manner he means  to do so &mdash; I will accept it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall repeat it!&rdquo; cried the Captain, throwing  off his assumption of the tragic father. The Oedipus Coloneus, the Lear &mdash; the  venerable victim of winter winds and men&rsquo;s ingratitude &mdash; was transformed in a  moment into an elderly Jeremy Diddler, lined with Lord Foppington. &ldquo;He shall  repeat it; I will have him at your feet to-morrow. Yes, Di, my love, I pledge  myself to bring that about, without compromise to your maidenly pride or the  dignity of a Paget. My dear child, I ought to have known that reflection would  show you where your duty lies. I fear I have been somewhat harsh, but you must  forgive me, Di; I have set my heart on this match, for your happiness as well  as my own. I could not stand the disappointment; though I admired, and still  admire, the high feeling, and all that kind of thing, which prompted your  refusal. A school-girlish sentimentality, child, but with something noble in  it; not the sentimentality of a vulgar schoolgirl. The blue blood will show  itself, my love; and now &mdash; no, no, don&rsquo;t cry. You will live to thank me for  to-night&rsquo;s work; yes, my child, to thank me, when you look round your  comfortable home by-and-by &mdash; when my poor old bones are mouldering in their  unpretending sepulchre &mdash; and say to yourself, &lsquo;I have my father to thank for  this. Adverse circumstances forbade his doing his duty as happier fathers are  allowed the privilege of doing theirs, but it was his forethought, his  ever-watchful care, which secured me an admirable husband and a happy home.&rsquo;  Mark my words, the time will come when you will say this, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try to think of you always kindly, papa,&rdquo;  Miss Paget answered in a low sad voice; &ldquo;and if my marriage can secure your  happiness and Gustave Lenoble&rsquo;s, I am content. I only fear to take too much,  and give too little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My love, you must certainly be the lineal  descendant of Don Quixote. Too much, and too little, forsooth! Let Lenoble find  a handsomer woman, or a more elegant woman, by gad, elsewhere! Such a woman as  a duke might be proud to make his duchess, by Jove! There shall be no sense of  obligation on our side, my love. Gustave Lenoble shall be made to feel that he  gets change for his shilling. Kiss me, child, and tell me you forgive me for  being a little rough with you, just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive you? &mdash; yes, papa. I dare say you are wiser  than I. Why should I refuse M. Lenoble? He is good and kind, and will give us a  happy home? What more can I want? Do I want to be like Charlotte, to whom life  seems all poetry and brightness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is going to throw herself away upon a  penny-a-liner, by Jove!&rdquo; interjected the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I hope to be like that girl, with her happy  ignorance of life, her boundless love and trust! O, no, no, papa; those things  are not for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laid her head upon her father&rsquo;s breast, and  sobbed like a child. This was her second farewell to the man she had loved, the  dreams she had dreamed. The Captain comforted her with a paternal embrace, but  was as powerless to comprehend her emotion as if he had found himself suddenly  called upon to console the sorrows of a Japanese widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hysterical,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;These noble natures are  subject to that kind of thing. And now, my love,&rdquo; he continued, in a more  business-like tone, &ldquo;let us talk seriously. I think it would be very advisable  for you to leave Bayswater, and take up your abode in these humble lodgings  with me immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason is sufficiently obvious, my love. It is  not right that you should continue to eat the bread of dependence. As the  future wife of Gustave Lenoble &mdash; and in this case, the word future means  immediately&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; cried Diana suddenly, &ldquo;you will not hurry  me into this marriage?
  I have consented for your sake. You will not be so ungenerous as to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to hurry you? No, my dear, of course not. There  shall be no indecent haste. Your wishes, your delicate and disinterested  motives, shall be consulted before all things; yes, my love,&rdquo; cried the  Captain, sorely afraid of some wavering on the part of his daughter, and  painfully anxious to conciliate her, &ldquo;all shall be in accordance with your  wishes. But I must urge your immediate removal from Bayswater; first, because  M. Lenoble will naturally wish to see you oftener than he can while you are  residing with people whose acquaintance I do not want him to make; and  secondly, because you have no further need of Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s patronage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been kindness, affection, papa &mdash; never  patronage. I could not leave Mrs. Sheldon or Charlotte abruptly or  ungraciously, upon any consideration. They gave me a home when I most bitterly  needed one. They took me away from the dull round of schoolroom drudgery, that  was fast changing me into a hard hopeless joyless automaton. My first duty is  to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain&rsquo;s angry sniff alone expressed the  indignation which this impious remark inspired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My next shall be to you and M. Lenoble. Let me  give Mrs. Sheldon due notice of the change in our plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call due notice?&rdquo; asked Horatio,  peevishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarter&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, indeed! Then for three months you are to dance  attendance upon Mrs.
  Sheldon, while M. Lenoble is waiting to make you his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must consult the wishes of my friends, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, my dear,&rdquo; replied the Captain, with a  sigh that was next of kin to a groan; &ldquo;you must please yourself and your friends,  I suppose; your poor old father is a secondary consideration.&rdquo; And then,  timeously mindful of the skirmish he had just had with his daughter, Captain  Paget made haste to assure her of his regard and submission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All shall be as you please, my love,&rdquo; he murmured.  &ldquo;There, go into my room, and smooth your hair, and bathe your eyes, while I  ring for the tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana obeyed. She found eau-de-cologne and the most  delicate of Turkey sponges on her father&rsquo;s wash-handstand; jockey-club, and  ivory-backed brushes, somewhat yellow with age, but bearing crest and monogram,  on his dressing-table. The workhouse did not seem quite so near at hand as the  Captain had implied; but with these sanguine people it is but a step from  disappointment to despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to tell Mrs. Sheldon, papa?&rdquo; she asked,  when she was pouring out her father&rsquo;s tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think you had better say nothing, except  that my circumstances have somewhat improved, and that my failing health  requires your care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate secrets, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, my dear; but half-confidences are more  disagreeable than secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana submitted. She secretly reserved to herself  the right to tell Charlotte anything she pleased. From that dear adopted sister  she would hide nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If M. Lenoble should repeat his offer, and I  should accept it, I will tell her all,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;It will make that dear  girl happy to know that there is some one who loves me, besides herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she thought of the strange difference of  fate that gave to this Charlotte Halliday, with her rich stepfather and  comfortable surroundings, a penniless soldier of fortune for a lover, while to  her, the spendthrift adventurer&rsquo;s daughter, came a wealthy suitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will hers be the dinner of herbs, and mine the  stalled ox?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Ah, Heaven forbid! Why is it so difficult to love  wisely, so easy to love too well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She remembered the cynical French proverb, &ldquo;When we  can not have what we love, we must love what we have.&rdquo; But the cynical proverb  brought her no comfort.</p>
<p>She went back to Bayswater with a strange  bewildered feeling; after having promised her father to go to Omega Street  whenever he sent for her. There was no actual pain in her mind, no passionate  desire to recall her promise, no dread horror of the step to which she had  pledged herself. The feeling that oppressed her was the sense that such a step  should have been the spontaneous election of her grateful heart, proud of a  good man&rsquo;s preference, instead of a weak submission to a father&rsquo;s helplessness.</p>
<h1 align="center"><em><a name="BookTheFifth"></a>Book The Fifth<br>
  The First Act Of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s Drama</em></h1>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  Taken By Storm</h2>
<p>Two days after her interview with Gustave Lenoble,  Miss Paget received a brief note from her father, summoning her again to Omega  Street.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;He has not gone back to Normandy,&rdquo; wrote the  Captain. &ldquo;My child, he positively worships the ground you  walk upon. Ah, my love, <em>it is something  to have a father</em>! I need scarcely tell you that his first idea of your  excellence was inspired by those glowing descriptions of your goodness, your  beauty, your heroism, which I favoured him with, <em>en passant</em>, during our conversations at C&ocirc;tenoir, where the happy  accident of a business transaction first introduced me to him. The interests of  my only child have ever been near and dear to me; and where a duller man would  have perceived only a wealthy stranger, my paternal instincts recognized at a  glance the predestined husband of my daughter. It needed my wide experience of  life &mdash; and, as I venture to believe, my subtle knowledge of the human heart &mdash;  to understand that a man who had lived for five-and-thirty years buried alive  in a French province &mdash; a charming place, my love, and for your refined taste  replete with interest &mdash; never seeing a mortal except his immediate neighbours,  would be the man of men to fall in love with the first attractive young woman  he met among strangers. Come to me this afternoon without fail, and come early.  &mdash; Yours,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;H.N.C.P.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Diana obeyed this summons submissively, but still  troubled by that strange sense of bewilderment which had affected her since her  stormy interview with Captain Paget. She was not quite certain of herself. The  old dreams &mdash; the sweet foolish girlish fancies &mdash; were not yet put away  altogether from her mind; but she knew that they were foolish, and she was  half-inclined to believe that there had been some wisdom in her father&rsquo;s scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I want more?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;He is  good and brave and true, and he loves me. If I were a princess, my marriage  would be negotiated for me by other people, and I should have reason to  consider myself very happy if the man whom the state selected for my husband  should prove as good a man as Gustave Lenoble. And he loves me; me, who have  never before had power over a man&rsquo;s heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked across Hyde Park on this occasion, as on  the last; and her thoughts, though always confused &mdash; mere rags and scraps of  thought &mdash; were not all unpleasant. There was a smile, half shy, half tender, on  her face as she went into the little sitting-room where Gustave was waiting for  her. She had seen his hat and overcoat in the passage, and knew that he was  there waiting for her. To this poor desolate soul there was something sweet in  the idea of being waited for.</p>
<p>As she stood but a little within the doorway,  blushing, almost trembling with the sense of her changed position, her lover  came across the room and took her in his arms. The strong brave arms held her  to his breast; and in that one embrace he took her to his heart, and made her  his own for ever.</p>
<p>In every story of life-long affection, there is one  moment in which the bond is sealed. Diana looked up at the frank tender face,  and felt that she had found her conqueror. Master, friend, protector, husband,  adoring and devoted lover, gallant and fearless champion &mdash; he was all; and she  divined his power and his worth as she glanced shyly upward, ashamed to be so  lightly won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Lenoble,&rdquo; she faltered, trying to withdraw  herself from the strong encircling arm that held her, as if by right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gustave, now and for ever, my Diane! There shall  be no more Monsieur Lenoble. And in a few weeks it shall be &lsquo;my husband.&rsquo; Your  father has given me to you. He tells me to laugh at your refusals your  scruples; to assail you like your Shakespeare&rsquo;s Petruchio assails his Katherine  &mdash; with audacious insolence that will not be denied. And I shall take his  advice. Look up into my face, dear angel, and defy me to take his advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happily the dear angel looked only downwards. But M  Lenoble was resolved to have an agreeable response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, then, thou canst not defy me!&rdquo; he cried, in  the only language he spoke; and the &ldquo;<em>tu</em>&rdquo;  for the first time sounded very tender, very sweet. &ldquo;Thou canst not tell me  thou art angry with me. And the other &mdash; the imbecile; &mdash; he is gone for ever, is  he not? Ah, say yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is gone,&rdquo; said Diana, almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he quite gone? The door of thine heart locked  against him, his luggage thrown out of the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone!&rdquo; she murmured softly. &ldquo;He could not  hold his place against you &mdash; you are so strong &mdash; so brave; and he was only a  shadow. Yes, he is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said this with a little sigh of relief. It was  in all sincerity that she answered her suitor&rsquo;s question. She felt that a  crisis had come in her life &mdash; the first page of a new volume; and the old sad  tear-blotted book might be cast away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear angel, wilt thou ever learn to love me?&rdquo;  asked Gustave, in a half-whisper, bending down his bearded face till his lips  almost touched her cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible not to love you,&rdquo; she answered  softly. And indeed it seemed to her as if this chivalrous Gaul was a creature  to command the love of women, the fear of men; an Achilles <em>en frac</em>; a Bayard without his coat of mail; Don Quixote in his  youth, generous, brave, compassionate, tender, and with a brain not as yet  distempered by the reading of silly romances.</p>
<p>Captain Paget emerged from his den as the little  love scene ended. He affected a gentlemanly unconsciousness of the poetry  involved in the situation, was pleasantly anxious about the tea-tray, the  candles, and minor details of life; and thus afforded the lovers ample time in  which to recover their composure. The Frenchman was in no wise discomposed; he  was only abnormally gay, with a little air of triumph that was not unpleasing.  Diana was pale; but there was an unwonted light in her eyes, and she had by no  means the appearance of a victim newly offered on the sacrificial altar of  filial duty. In sober truth, Miss Paget was happier to-night than she had been  for a long time. At three-and-twenty she was girl enough to rejoice in the  knowledge that she was truly loved, and woman enough to value the sense of  peace involved in the security of a prosperous future.</p>
<p>If she was grateful to her lover &mdash; and the  affection he had inspired in her heart had grown out of gratitude &mdash; it was no  mercenary consideration as to his income or position that made her grateful.  She thanked him for his love &mdash; that treasure which she had never expected to  possess; she thanked him because he had taken her by the hand, and led her out  of the ranks of lonely dependent womanhood, and seated her upon a throne, on  the steps whereof he was content to kneel. Whether the throne were a rushen  chair in some rustic cottage, or a gilded <em>fauteuil</em> in a palace, she cared very little. It was the subject&rsquo;s devotion that was new  and sweet to her.</p>
<p>She went to Charlotte&rsquo;s room that night, when Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s small household was at rest; as she had gone on Christmas Eve to  renounce her lover and to bless her rival. This time it was a new confession  she went to make, and a confession that involved some shame. There is nothing  so hard to confess as inconstancy; and every woman is not so philosophic as  Rahel Varnhagen, who declared that to be constant was not always to love the  same person, but always to love some one.</p>
<p>Miss Paget seated herself at Charlotte&rsquo;s feet, as  she had done on that previous occasion. The weather was still cold enough to  make a fire very pleasant, though it was more than two months since the  Christmas bells had rung out upon the frosty air. Diana sat on a low hassock,  playing with the tassels of her friend&rsquo;s dressing-gown, anxious to make her  confession, and solely at a loss for words in which to shape so humiliating an  avowal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte,&rdquo; she began abruptly at last, &ldquo;have you  any idea when you and
  Valentine are to be married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Halliday gave a little cry of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course not, Di! How can you ask such a  question? Our marriage is what uncle George calls a remote contingency. We are  not to be married for ages &mdash; not until Valentine has obtained a secure position  in literature, and an income that seems almost impossible. That was the special  condition upon which Mr. Sheldon &mdash; papa &mdash; gave his consent to our engagement.  Of course it was very proper and prudent of him to think of these things; and  as he has been very kind and liberal-minded in his conduct to me throughout, I  should be a most ungrateful person if I refused to be guided by his advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose that means that your engagement is  to be a long one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The longest of long engagements. And what can be  happier than a long engagement? One gets to know and understand the man one is  to marry so thoroughly. I think I know every turn of thought in Valentine&rsquo;s  mind; every taste, every fancy; and I feel myself every day growing to think  more and more like him. I read the books he reads, so as to be able to talk to  him, you know; but I am not so clever as you, Di, and Valentine&rsquo;s favourite  authors do sometimes seem rather dry to me. But I struggle on, you know; and  the harder I find the struggle, the more I admire my dear love&rsquo;s cleverness. Think  of him, Di &mdash; three different articles in three different magazines last month!  The paper on Apollodorus, in the <em>Cheapside</em>,  you know; and that story in the Charing Cross&mdash;&rsquo;How I lost my Gingham Umbrella,  and gained the Acquaintance of Mr. Gozzleton.&rsquo; <em>So</em> funny! And the exhaustive treatise on the Sources of Light, in  the <em>Scientific Saturday</em>. And think of  the fuss they make about Homer, a blind old person who wrote a long rigmarole  of a poem about battles, and wrote it so badly that to this day no one knows whether  it&rsquo;s one complete poem, or a lot of odds-and-ends in the way of poetry, put  together by a man with an unpronounceable Greek name. When I think of what  Valentine accomplishes in comparison to Homer, and the little notice the  reviewers take of him, except to make him low-spirited by telling him that he  is shallow and frivolous, I begin to think that literature must be going to the  dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here Charlotte became meditative, absorbed in  the contemplation of Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s genius. Diana had begun the conversation  very artfully, intending to proceed by a gentle transition from Charlotte&rsquo;s  love affairs to her own; but the conversation was drifting away from the  subject into a discussion upon literature, and the brilliant young essayist  whose first adventurous flights seemed grand as the soaring of Theban eagle to  this tender and admiring watcher of his skyward progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lotta,&rdquo; said Miss Paget, after a pause, &ldquo;should  you be very sorry if I were to leave you before your marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me before my marriage, Diana! Is it not  arranged that you are to live with mamma, and be a daughter to her, when I am  gone? And you will come and stay with Valentine and me at our cottage; and you  will advise me about my house-keeping, and teach me how to be a sensible, useful,  economical wife, as well as a devoted one. Leave us, Di! What have I done, or  mamma, or Mr. Sheldon, or anybody, that you should talk of anything so  dreadful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done, dear girl, dear friend, dear  sister? Everything to win my undying love and gratitude. You have changed me  from a hard disappointed bitter-minded woman &mdash; envious, at times, even of you &mdash;  into your loving and devoted friend. You have changed me from a miserable  creature into a contented and hopeful one. You have taught me to forget that my  childhood and youth were one long night of wretchedness and degradation. You  have taught me to forgive the father who suffered my life to be what it was,  and made no one poor effort to lift me out of the slough of despond to which he  had sunk. I can say no more, Charlotte. There are things that cannot be told by  words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want to leave me!&rdquo; said Charlotte, in  accents half-wondering, half-reproachful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father wants me to leave you, Lotta; and some  one else &mdash; some one whom you must know and like before I can be sure I like him  myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him!&rdquo; cried Charlotte, with a faint shriek of  surprise. &ldquo;Diana, WHAT are you going to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A secret, Lotta; something which my father has  forbidden me to tell any one, but which I will not hide from you. My poor  father has found a kind friend &mdash; a friend who is almost as good to him as you  are to me. How merciful Heaven is in raising up friends for outcasts! And I  have seen a good deal of this gentleman who is so kind to papa, and the result  is that &mdash; chiefly for papa&rsquo;s sake, and because I know that he is generous and  brave and true, I mean papa&rsquo;s friend, M. Lenoble &mdash; I have consented to be his  wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana!&rdquo; cried Charlotte, with a sternness of  manner that was alarming in so gentle a creature, &ldquo;it shall never be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sacrifice! No, dear, no! I understand it all.  For your cruel mercenary heartless designing father&rsquo;s sake, you are going to  marry a man whom you can&rsquo;t love. You are going to offer up your poor bruised  desolate heart on the altar of duty. Ah, dear, you can&rsquo;t think I forget what  you told me only two short months ago &mdash; though I seem selfish and frivolous,  and am always talking about <em>him</em>, and  parading my happiness, as it must seem to you, reckless of the wounds so newly  healed in your noble unselfish heart. But I do not altogether forget, Diana,  and such a sacrifice as this I will not allow. I know you have resigned him to  me &mdash; I know you have thrust him from your heart, as you told me that night. But  the hollow aching void that is left in your lonely heart shall be sacred, Di.  No stranger&rsquo;s image shall pollute it. You shall not sacrifice your own peace to  your father&rsquo;s selfishness. No, dear, no! With mamma and me you will always have  a home. You need stoop to no cruel barter such as this marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And hereupon Miss Halliday wept over and caressed  her friend, as the confidante of Agamemnon&rsquo;s daughter may have wept over and  caressed that devoted young princess after the divination of Calchas had become  common talk in the royal household.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I think it my duty to accept M. Lenoble&rsquo;s  offer, Lotta?&rdquo; urged Miss Paget with some embarrassment of manner. &ldquo;M. Lenoble  is as rich as he is generous, and my marriage with him will secure a happy home  for my father. The foolish dreams I told you about on Christmas Eve had faded  from my mind before I dared to speak of them. I could only confess my folly  when I knew that I was learning to be wise. Pray do not think that I am sordid  or mercenary. It is not because M. Lenoble is rich that I am inclined to marry  him, it is because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you want to throw yourself away for the  advantage of your selfish heartless father,&rdquo; interjected Charlotte. &ldquo;He has  neglected you all your life, and now wants to profit by the sacrifice of your  happiness. Be firm, Di, darling; your Charlotte will stand by you, and find a  home for you always, come what may. Who is this M. Lenoble? Some horrible ugly  old creature, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Paget smiled and blushed. The vision of  Gustave&rsquo;s frank handsome face arose before her very vividly as Charlotte said  this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;M. Lenoble is not an old  man &mdash; five-and-thirty at most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five-and-thirty!&rdquo; repeated Charlotte, with a wry  face; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t call that young? And what is he like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, I think he is the sort of man whom  most people would call handsome. I&rsquo;m sure you would like him, Lotta. He is so  candid, so animated, so full of strength and courage. The sort of man to whom  one would naturally look in any emergency or danger; the sort of man in whose  company fear would be impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana,&rdquo; cried Charlotte, suddenly, &ldquo;you are in  love with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lotta!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, you are in love with him,&rdquo; repeated  Miss Halliday, embracing her friend with effusion; &ldquo;yes, over head and ears in  love with him. And you are ashamed to confess the truth to me; and you are half  ashamed to confess it even to yourself &mdash; as if you could deceive an old stager  like me!&rdquo; cried Charlotte, laughing. &ldquo;Why, you dear inconstant thing, while I  have felt myself the guiltiest and most selfish creature in the world for  robbing you of Valentine, you have been quietly transferring your affections to  this M. Gustave Lenoble &mdash; who is very rich, and brave, and true, and generous,  and what most people would call handsome! Bless you, a thousand times, my  darling! You have made me so happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Lotta!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear. The thought that there was a blank in  your life made a dark cloud in mine. I know I have been very selfish, very  thoughtless, but I could never have been quite free from a sense of  self-reproach. But now there is nothing for me but happiness. O darling, I so  long to see your M. Lenoble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see him, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime tell me what he is like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Halliday insisted upon a full, true, and  particular account of M. Lenoble&rsquo;s personal appearance. Diana gave it, but not  without some sense of embarrassment. She could not bring herself to be  enthusiastic about Gustave Lenoble, though in her heart there was a warmth of  feeling that surprised her. &ldquo;What a hypocrite you are, Di!&rdquo; exclaimed Charlotte  presently. &ldquo;I know you love this good Frenchman almost as dearly as I love  Valentine, and that the thought of his affection makes you happy; and yet you  speak of him in little measured sentences, and you won&rsquo;t be enthusiastic even  about his good looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is difficult to pass from dreams to realities,  Lotta. I have lived so long among dreams, that the waking world seems strange  to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is only a poetical way of saying that you are  ashamed of having changed your mind. I will tell M. Lenoble what a lukewarm  creature you are, and how unworthy of his love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall tell him what you please. But remember,  dear, my engagement must not be spoken about yet awhile, not even to your  mamma. Papa makes a strong point of this, and I have promised to obey, though I  am quite in the dark as to his reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Halliday submitted to anything her friend  wished; only entreating that she might be introduced to M. Lenoble. Diana  promised her this privilege; but it speedily transpired that Diana&rsquo;s promise  was not all that was wanted on this occasion.</p>
<p>For some time past, in fact from the very  commencement of Charlotte&rsquo;s engagement, Mr. Sheldon had shown himself  punctilious to an exceeding degree with regard to his stepdaughter. The places  to which she went, and the people with whom she consorted, appeared to be  matters of supreme importance in his mind. When speaking of these things he  gave those about him to understand that his ideas had been the same from the  time of Charlotte&rsquo;s leaving school; but Diana knew that this was not true. Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s theories had been much less strict, and Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s practice had  been much more careless, prior to Miss Halliday&rsquo;s engagement.</p>
<p>No stately principal of a school for young ladies  could have been more particular as to the movements of her charges &mdash; more  apprehensive of wolf-in-sheep&rsquo;s-clothing in the shape of singing or  drawing-master &mdash; than Mr. Sheldon seemed to be in these latter days. Even those  pleasant walks in Kensington Gardens, which had been one of the regular  occupations of the day, were now forbidden. Mr. Sheldon did not like that his  daughter should walk in public with no better protector than Diana Paget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something disreputable in two girls  marching about those gardens together according to my ideas,&rdquo; said this  ultra-refined stockbroker, one morning at the family breakfast-table. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  like to see my stepdaughter do anything I should forbid my own daughter to do.  And if I had a daughter, I should most decidedly forbid all lonely rambles in  Kensington Gardens. You see, Lotta, two girls as attractive as you and Miss  Paget can&rsquo;t be too particular where you go, and what you do. When you want air  and exercise, you can get both in the garden; and when you want change of  scene, and a peep at the fashions, you can drive out with Mrs. Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this deprivation Charlotte submitted, somewhat  unwillingly, but with no sign of open rebellion. She thought her stepfather  foolish and unreasonable; but she always bore in mind the fact that he had been  kind and disinterested in the matter of her engagement, and she was content to  prove her gratitude by any little sacrifice of this kind. Was not her lover  permitted to spend his Sundays in her society, and to call on her, at his  discretion, during the week? And what were walks in Kensington Gardens compared  with the delight of his dear presence! It is true that she had sometimes been  favoured with Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s society in the course of her airing; but she  knew that he sacrificed his hours of work or study for the chance of half an  hour in her society; and she felt that there might be gain to him in her loss  of liberty.</p>
<p>She told him, when next they met, that the morning  walks were forbidden; and, so jealous a passion is love, that Mr. Hawkehurst was  nowise sorry to find that his pearl was strictly watched and carefully guarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it seems very particular of Mr. Sheldon, of  course,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but, upon my word, I think he&rsquo;s right. Such a girl as you  oughtn&rsquo;t to go about with no better protection than Diana can give you. Fellows  will stare so at a pretty girl, you know; and I can&rsquo;t bear to think my pearl  should be stared at by impertinent strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst did not, however, find the strict  notions of his lady-love&rsquo;s stepfather quite so agreeable when he wanted to take  his &ldquo;pearl&rdquo; to the winter exhibitions of pictures. He was told that Miss  Halliday could go nowhere, except accompanied by her mamma; and as Georgy did  not care about pictures, and found herself unequal to the fatigue of attending  the winter exhibitions, he was obliged to forego the delight of seeing them  with Lotta on his arm. He pronounced Mr. Sheldon on this occasion to be a  narrow-minded idiot; but withdrew the remark in a contrite spirit when  Charlotte reminded him of that gentleman&rsquo;s generosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, he has certainly been very kind and  very disinterested &mdash; more disinterested than even you think; but, somehow, I  can&rsquo;t make him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very well for Miss Halliday that she had  submitted to this novel restriction with as good a grace, inasmuch as Mr.  Sheldon had prepared himself for active opposition. He had given orders to his  wife, and further orders to Mrs. Woolper to the effect that his step-daughter  should not be permitted to go out of doors, except in his own or her mother&rsquo;s  company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a very good girl, you see, Nancy,&rdquo; he said  to the old housekeeper, &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s young, and she&rsquo;s giddy; and of course I  can&rsquo;t take upon myself to answer for Miss Paget, who may or may not be a good  girl. She comes of a very bad stock, however; and I am bound to remember that.  Some people think that you can&rsquo;t give a girl too much liberty. My ideas lean  the other way. I think you can&rsquo;t take too much care of a very pretty girl whom  you are bound by duty to protect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this sounded very noble and very conscientious.  It sounded thus even to Mrs. Woolper, who in her intercourse with Philip  Sheldon could never quite divest herself of one appalling memory. That memory  was the death of Tom Halliday, and the horrible thoughts and fears that had for  a time possessed her mind in relation to that death. The shadow of that old  ghastly terror sometimes came between her and Mr. Sheldon, even now, though she  had long ago assured herself that the terror had been alike groundless and  unreasonable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see my own nephew carried off by a fever  twice as sudden as the fever that carried off poor Mr. Halliday?&rdquo; she said to  herself; &ldquo;and am I to think horrid things of him as I nursed a baby, because a  cup of greasy beef-tea turned my stomach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Convinced by such reasoning as this that she had  done her master a grievous wrong, and grateful for the timely shelter afforded  in her old age, Mrs. Woolper felt that she could not do too much in her  benefactor&rsquo;s service. She had already shown herself a clever managing  housekeeper; had reformed abuses, and introduced a new system of care and  economy below-stairs, to the utter bewilderment of poor Georgy, for whom the  responsibilities of the gothic villa had been an overwhelming burden. Georgy  was not particularly grateful to the energetic old Yorkshirewoman who had taken  this burden off her hands, but she was submissive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never felt myself much in the house, my dear,&rdquo;  she said to Lotta; &ldquo;but
  I am sure since Ann Woolper has been here I have felt myself a cipher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Woolper, naturally sharp and observant, was  not slow to perceive that Mr. Sheldon was abnormally anxious about his  stepdaughter. She ascribed this anxiety to a suspicious nature, an inherent  distrust of other people on the part of her master, and in some measure to his  ignorance of womankind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to think that she&rsquo;d run away and get  married on the sly, at a word from that young man; but he doesn&rsquo;t know what a  dear innocent soul she is, and how sorry she&rsquo;d be to displease any one that&rsquo;s  kind to her. I don&rsquo;t know anything about Miss Paget. She&rsquo;s more stand-offish  than our own Miss, though she is little better than a genteel kind of servant;  but she seems fair-spoken enough. As to our Miss, bless her dear heart! she  wants no watching, I&rsquo;ll lay. But I daresay those City folks, with their stocks  going up and going down, and always bringing about the ruin of somebody or  other, go which way they will, get their poor heads so muddled with figures  that they can&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s such a thing as honesty in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the gist of Mrs. Woolper&rsquo;s evening musing  in the snug little housekeeper&rsquo;s room at the Lawn. It was a very comfortable  little room, and held sacred to Mrs. Woolper; the three young females, and the  boy in buttons, who formed Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s in-door establishment, preferring the  license of the kitchen to the strict etiquette of the housekeeper&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>This apartment, as well as every other room in the  stockbroker&rsquo;s house, bore the stamp of prosperity. A comfortable easy-chair  reposed the limbs of Mrs. Woolper; a bright little fire burned in a bright  little grate, and its ruddy light was reflected in a bright little fender.  Prints of the goody class adorned the walls; and a small round table, with a  somewhat gaudy cover, supported Mrs. Woolper&rsquo;s work-box and family Bible, both  of which she made it a point of honour to carry about with her, and to keep  religiously, through good fortune and through evil fortune; neither of which,  however, afforded her much employment. She felt herself to be much nearer grace  with the family Bible by her side than she would have been without it; she  felt, indeed, that the maintenance and due exhibition of the family Bible was  in itself a kind of religion. But that she should peruse its pages was not in  the bond. Her eyes were old and weak &mdash; sharp enough to discover the  short-comings of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s young maid-servants, but too feeble even for  long-primer.</p>
<p>As she looked round that snug little chamber of an  evening, when her day&rsquo;s labours were ended, and her own particular  Britannia-metal tea-pot was basking in the fender, her own special round of  toast frizzling on the trivet, she was very grateful to the man to whom she  owed these comforts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I be but for him?&rdquo; she asked herself  with a shudder; for the vision of that darksome abode shut in by high black  walls &mdash; the metropolitan workhouse &mdash; arose before her. She did not know what  difficulties would have barred her entrance even to that dreary asylum; she  only thought of the horrors of that sanctuary, and she blessed her master for  the benevolence that had accepted the service of her failing hands.</p>
<p>This was the servant on whom Philip Sheldon relied.  He saw that she was grateful, and that she was ready to serve him with an  almost slavish devotion. He knew that she had suspected him in the past, and he  saw that she had outlived her suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a statute of limitations to these things  as well as for debt,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;A man can live down anything, if he  knows what he is about.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  Firm As A Rock</h2>
<p>After that midnight interview between the two girls  in Miss Halliday&rsquo;s bedroom, life went very smoothly at the gothic villa for two  or three days, during which the impulsive Charlotte, being forbidden to talk  openly of the change in her friend&rsquo;s position, was fain to give vent to her  feelings by furtive embraces and hand-squeezings, sly nods and meaning becks,  and mischievous twinkling of her arch grey eyes.</p>
<p>She talked of Valentine more than ever now, feeling  herself at liberty to sing what p&aelig;ans she pleased in praise of her hero, now  that her friend had also a fitting subject for p&aelig;ans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now it&rsquo;s your turn to talk of M. Lenoble,  dear,&rdquo; she would say na&iuml;vely, when she had entertained Diana with the minute  details of her last conversation with her lover, or a lively sketch of the  delights of that ideal cottage which she loved to furnish and unfurnish in  accordance with the new fancy of the hour.</p>
<p>Diana was pleased to listen to her girlish talk: to  hang and rehang the ideal draperies, to fill and refill the ideal bookcase, to  plan and replan the arrangements of that ideal existence which was to be all  joy and love and harmony; but when her turn came, and she was asked to be  rapturous about her own lover, she could say nothing: that which she felt was  too deep for words. The thought of her lover was strange to her; the fact of  his love was mysterious and wonderful. She could not talk of him with the  customary frivolous school-girl talk; and love for him had so newly taken root  in her heart that there were as yet no blossoms to be gathered from that  magical plant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to talk of him, Lotta, dear;&rdquo; she  said. &ldquo;I am not yet sure that I love him; I only feel that it is sweet to be  loved by him. I think Providence must have sent him to me in pity for my  desolation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was almost the same fancy that had occurred to  Susan Meynell five-and-thirty years before this time, when Gustave the first  had rescued her from the suicide&rsquo;s unrepentable sin.</p>
<p>That chivalrous turn of mind which was hereditary in  the race of Lenoble predisposed these men to pity loneliness and beauty,  weakness and sorrow. This pity for helplessness may have been indeed only an  element of their exceeding strength. Was not the rescue of weaklings and women  an unfailing attribute in the mighty men of old? Who so prompt as Hercules to  fly to the rescue of Hesione? Who so swift as Perseus to save Andromeda? And  what sea-monster more terrible than loneliness and poverty?</p>
<p>In a few days there came another letter from  Captain Paget, containing a fresh summons to Omega Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenoble positively returns to Normandy to-morrow,&rdquo;  he wrote, &ldquo;to see his girls, and, no doubt, break the news of his approaching  marriage. He much wants to see you, and, as I have forbidden his calling on you  at the Lawn, can only meet you here. He is to drink tea with me at the usual  time to-morrow evening, and I shall expect to see you early in the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This afforded an opportunity for that introduction  to which Miss Halliday looked forward with so much interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mr. Sheldon and your mamma will let you come  with me this afternoon, dear, I shall be very pleased to take you,&rdquo; said Diana;  and she felt that she would appear less in the character of a lamb led to the  slaughter if she could go to meet her betrothed accompanied by Charlotte.</p>
<p>But in this matter both the young ladies were  doomed to disappointment. Mr. Sheldon showed himself a social Draco in all  things relating to his stepdaughter. Being forbidden to reveal the existence of  Gustave Lenoble, Charlotte could only urge a frivolous desire to accompany her  friend in a pilgrimage dictated by filial duty. To the practical mind of Philip  Sheldon this desire appeared altogether absurd and unreasonable, and he did not  hesitate to express himself to that effect in a <em>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</em> with his stepdaughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good on earth can you do by going to see a  gouty old man, who has his own daughter to dance attendance upon him?&rdquo; asked  Mr. Sheldon. &ldquo;Really, Charlotte, I am surprised to hear such a proposition from  a girl of your good sense. Miss Paget is your companion, not your visitor. It  is her duty to indulge your whims, but it is not your place to give way to  hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is a whim of mine, papa; I should really  like to spend the afternoon at Chelsea. It would be a change, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon looked at his stepdaughter with a sharp  and searching gaze, a gaze in which there was suspicion as well as curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very discreditable whim for a young lady  in your position,&rdquo; he said sternly; &ldquo;and I beg that such a proposition may not  be made to me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was decisive. Charlotte submitted, and Diana  went alone to Omega Street. She found Gustave waiting for her. He proposed a  walk, and Captain Paget was enthusiastic upon the subject of fresh air, and the  benefits arising therefrom. So the lovers went out in the bleak winter  afternoon, and wandered in the dreary Pimlico region as far as St. James&rsquo;s Park  &mdash; Gustave delighted to have Diana&rsquo;s hand upon his arm, and Diana almost  bewildered by a sense of happiness, which seemed unreal by reason of its very  novelty.</p>
<p>Gustave was all enthusiasm, full of plans for the  future. He would have had the marriage take place immediately, if such a thing  had been possible; but Diana showed him that it would not be possible. Her first  duty was to the only friends she had ever known. Gustave argued the point  resolutely for nearly an hour, during which time they made their way to the  very gates of St. James&rsquo;s Park, but Diana was more resolute still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a tyrannical wife I shall have by-and-by!&rdquo;  said Gustave. &ldquo;I think you care for these Sheldons more than for me, Diane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Sheldons have been so good to me in the  past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I mean to be so good to you in the future,&rdquo;  answered Gustave. &ldquo;You shall be the happiest wife in Normandy, if a foolish  doting husband&rsquo;s devotion can make you happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I done to deserve so much devotion?&rdquo;  Diana murmured wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done? Nothing, less than nothing.  You will not even run the hazard of offending your family of Sheldon in order  to make me happy. But Fate has said, &lsquo;At the feet of that girl with the dark  eyes and pale proud face shall poor Lenoble of C&ocirc;tenoir put down his heart.&rsquo; Do  you know what I said to myself when I saw you first in the little parlour  yonder? Ah, no! How should you guess? &lsquo;She is there,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;behold her! It  is thy destiny, Lenoble, on which thou gazest!&rsquo; And thou, love, wert calm and  voiceless as Fate. Quiet as the goddess of marble before which the pagans  offered their sacrifices, across whose cold knees they laid their rich  garments. I put my treasures in your lap, my love; my heart, my hopes, &mdash; all  the treasures I had to offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all very sweet, but there was a sting even  mingled with that sweetness. Diana told herself that love like this should only  be offered on the purest shrine; and when she remembered the many stains upon  her father&rsquo;s honour, it seemed to her that a part of the shame must needs  cleave to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gustave,&rdquo; she said presently, after an absent  meditative mood, from which her lover had vainly tried to beguile her, &ldquo;does it  not seem to you that there is something foolish in this talk of love and  confidence between you and me; and that all your promises have been a little  too lightly made? What do you know of me? You see me sitting in my father&rsquo;s  room, and because my eyes happen to please you, or for some reason as foolish  as that, you ask me to be your wife. I might have been one of the worst of  women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have been? &mdash; yes, dear, but you are not.  And if you had been, Gustave Lenoble would not have flung his heart into your  lap, even if your eyes had been sweeter than they are. We impulsive people are  people of quick perceptions, and know what we are doing better than our  reflective friends imagine. I did not need to be an hour in your company, dear  love, in order to know that you are noble and true. There are tones in the  voice, there are expressions of the face, that tell these things better than  words can tell them; for, you see, words can lie, while tones and looks are apt  to be true. Yes, my angel, I knew you from that first night. My heart leapt  across all conventional barriers, and found its way straight to yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see that you think much better of me than I  deserve; but even supposing you not to be deceived as to myself, I fear you are  much deceived as to my surroundings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that your father is poor, and that the  burden of his poverty weighs heavily on you. That is enough for me to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, M. Lenoble; it is not enough for you to know.  If I am to be your wife, I will not enter your family as an impostor. I told  you the truth about myself the other day when you questioned me, and I am bound  to tell you the truth about my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she told him, in the plainest frankest  language, the story of her father&rsquo;s life. She inflicted no unnecessary shame on  Captain Paget; she made no complaint of her neglected childhood and joyless  youth; but she told Gustave that her father had been an adventurer, keeping  doubtful company, and earning his bread by doubtful means.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope and believe that if a peaceful home could  be secured for his declining years, he would live the rest of his life like a  gentleman and a Christian; and that, the bitter struggle for existence being  ended, he would be sorry for the past. I doubt if the sense of shame ever  deserted him when he was living that wretched wandering life, leaving debts and  difficulties behind him everywhere &mdash; always harassed and hunted by creditors,  who had good cause to be angry. Yes, Gustave, I do believe that if it should  please Providence to give my father a peaceful home at last, he will be  thankful for God&rsquo;s mercy, and will repent the sins of life. And now I have told  you the kind of heritage I can bring my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear love, I will accept the heritage, for the  sake of her who brings it. I never meant to be less than a son to your father;  and if he is not the best of fathers, as regards the past, we will try to make  him a decent kind of father as regards the future. I have long understood that  Captain Paget is something &mdash; ever so little &mdash; of an adventurer. It was the  pursuit of fortune that brought him to me; and without knowing it, he brought  me my fortune in the shape of his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana blushed as she remembered that Captain Paget  had not been so innocent of any design in this matter as the Frenchman  imagined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will receive even papa for my sake?&rdquo; asked  Diana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are indeed a generous lover!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lover who is not generous is &mdash; bah! there is  nothing in creation so mean as the wretch whom love does not render generous.  When one sees the woman whom Fate intends for one&rsquo;s wife, is one to stop to  inquire the character of her father, her mother, her sister, her cousin? &mdash; for  there is no stopping when you begin that. A man who loves makes no inquiries.  If he finds his jewel in the gutter, he picks it out of the mud and carries it  away in his bosom, too proud of his treasure to remember where he found it;  always provided that the jewel is no counterfeit, but the real gem, fit for a  king&rsquo;s crown. And my diamond is of the purest water. By-and-by we will try to  drain the gutter &mdash; that is to say, we will try to pay those small debts of  which you speak, to lodging-house keepers, and tradesmen who have trusted your  father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would pay papa&rsquo;s debts!&rdquo; cried Diana in  amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not? All these little debts, the thought  of which is so bitter to you, might be discharged for two or three thousand  pounds. Your father tells me I am to be very rich by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father tells you! Ah, then, you have allowed  him to involve you in some kind of speculation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has involved me in no speculation, and in no  risk that two or three hundred pounds will not cover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole business seems very mysterious,  Gustave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps; it has to do with a secret which I am  pledged to keep. I will not allow your father to lead me into any quagmire of  speculation, believe me, dear one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this they went back to Omega Street in the  winter gloaming, and Diana loved and admired this man with all her heart and  mind. A new life lay before her, very bright and fair. There, where had been  only the barren desert, was now a fair landscape, shining in the sunlight of  hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think your children will ever love me,  Gustave?&rdquo; she asked, not without some sense of wonder that this impulsive  light-hearted lover should be the owner of children. She fancied that a  responsibility so grave as paternity must needs have impressed some stamp of  solemnity upon the man who bore it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever love thee!&rdquo; cried Gustave. &ldquo;Child, they will  adore thee. They ask only some one to love. Their hearts are gardens of  flowers; and thou shalt gather the flowers. But wilt thou be happy at C&ocirc;tenoir,  thou? It is somewhat sad, perhaps &mdash; the grave old ch&acirc;teau with the long sombre  corridors. But thou shalt choose new furniture, new garnitures at Rouen, and we  will make all bright and gay, like the heart of thy affianced. Thou wilt not be  dull?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dull, with you and yours! I shall thank God for my  happy home day and night, as I never thought to thank Him a few months ago,  when I was dissatisfied, wicked, tired of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you thought of that other one? Ah, how he  was an imbecile, that other one! But thou wilt never think of him again; it is  a dream that is past,&rdquo; said M. Lenoble.</p>
<p>That self-confidence which was an attribute of his  sanguine nature rendered the idea of a rival not altogether unpleasant to him.  He was gratified by the idea of his own victory, and the base rival&rsquo;s  annihilation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diane, I want to show thee the home that is to be  thine,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;Your Sheldon family must give thee at least a  holiday, if they refuse to let thee go altogether. Thou wilt come to Normandy  with thy father. He is coming for a week or two, now that his gout is better. I  want to show thee C&ocirc;tenoir &mdash; and Beaubocage, the place where my father was  born. It will seem dreary, perhaps, to thine English eyes; but to me it is very  dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that is dear to you shall appear dreary to  me,&rdquo; said Diana.</p>
<p>By this time they had arrived at Omega Street.  Again Miss Paget made tea for her lover. Strange to say, the operation seemed  to grow more agreeable with every repetition. While taking his tea from the  hands of his beloved, Gustave pressed the question of Diana&rsquo;s visit to  Normandy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About her Sheldon family she is adamant,&rdquo; he said  to Captain Paget, who sipped his tea and smiled at the lovers with the air of  an aristocratic patriarch. &ldquo;There is to be no marriage till it pleases Mrs.  Sheldon to set her free. I consent to this only as man must consent to the  inevitable; but I say to her, can she not come to Normandy for a fortnight &mdash;  say but one short fortnight &mdash; to see her home? She will come with you. She has  but to ask a holiday of her friends, and it is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain, &ldquo;she shall come  with me. If necessary, I myself will ask it of Sheldon. &mdash; But it will be best  not to mention where you are going, Diana. There are reasons, best known to our  friend Gustave and myself, which render secrecy advisable just at present. You  can say Rouen. That is quite near enough to the mark to come within the limits  of truth,&rdquo; added Horatio, with the tone of a man who had never quite outstepped  those limits. &ldquo;Yes, Rouen. And you will come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With us,&rdquo; said Gustave. &ldquo;I will put off my journey  for a day or two for the sake of going with you. You have to meet Fleurus in  Rouen haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he is to be there on the fifth of March, and  this is the last day of February. I had a letter from him this morning. All  goes swimmingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana wondered what it could be which went  swimmingly; but she was obliged to content herself with her lover&rsquo;s assurance  that he had not allowed her father to involve him in any kind of speculation.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  Against Wind And Tide</h2>
<p>Between Philip Sheldon and his brother there was at  this time a state of feeling somewhat akin to the relations between a  subjugated country and its conqueror. The vanquished is fain to accept whatever  the victor is pleased to give, though discontent and impotent rage may be  gnawing his entrails. George Sheldon had been a loser in that game in which the  Haygarthian inheritance was the stake. He had held good cards, and had played  them with considerable cleverness; but no play could prevail against his  antagonist&rsquo;s ace of trumps. The ace of trumps was Charlotte Halliday; and as to  his mode and matter of playing this card, Mr. Sheldon was for the present  profoundly mysterious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have known a good many inscrutable cards in my  time,&rdquo; the solicitor of Gray&rsquo;s Inn observed to his elder brother, in the course  of fraternal converse; &ldquo;but I think for inscrutability you put the topper on  the lot. What do you expect to get out of this Haygarth estate? Come, Phil, let  us have your figures in plain English. I am to have a fifth &mdash; that&rsquo;s all signed  and sealed. But how about your share? What agreement have you got from Miss  Halliday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would the world think of me if I extorted  money, or the promise of money, from my wife&rsquo;s daughter? Do you think I could  enforce any deed between her and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see; you go in for respectability. And you  are going to leave the settlement of your claims to your stepdaughter&rsquo;s  generosity. You will let her marry Hawkehurst, with her hundred thousand  pounds; and then you will say to those two, &lsquo;Mr. and Mrs. Hawkehurst, be so  kind as to hand over my share of the plunder.&rsquo; That is not <em>like</em> you, Phil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will be good enough to spare yourself  the trouble of speculating about my motives. Go your way, and leave me to go  mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is a case in which I have an interest. If  Charlotte marries Hawkehurst, I don&rsquo;t see how you are to profit, to any extent  that you would care about, by the Haygarth fortune. But, on the other hand, if  she should die unmarried, without a will, the money would go to your wife. O my  God! Philip Sheldon, is <em>THAT</em> what you  mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was so sudden, the tone of horror in  which it was spoken so undisguised, that Mr. Sheldon the stockbroker was for  one moment thrown off his guard. His breath thickened; he tried to speak, but his  dry lips could shape no word. It was only one moment that he faltered. In the  next he turned upon his brother angrily, and asked what he meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been promised <em>your</em> reward,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;leave me to look after mine. You&rsquo;ll take  those papers round to Greenwood and Greenwood; they want to talk to you about  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll take the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greenwood and Greenwood were Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s own  solicitors &mdash; a firm of some distinction, on whose acumen and experience the  stockbroker placed implicit reliance. They were men of unblemished  respectability, and to them Mr. Sheldon had confided the care of his  stepdaughter&rsquo;s interests, always reserving the chief power in his own hands.  These gentlemen thought well of the young lady&rsquo;s prospects, and were handling  the case in that slow and stately manner which marks the handling of such cases  by eminent firms of the slow-and-stately class.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon wished his brother good-day, and was  about to depart, when
  George planted himself suddenly before the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you here, Phil,&rdquo; he said, with an intensity  of manner that was by no means common to him; &ldquo;I want to say a few words to  you, and I will say them. There was an occasion, ten years ago, on which I  ought to have spoken out, and didn&rsquo;t. I have never ceased to regret my  cowardice. Yes, by Jove! I hate myself for it; and there are times when I feel  as if my share in that wretched business was almost as bad as yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. That&rsquo;s your text, and you&rsquo;ll stick  to it. But you <em>do</em> know what I mean,  and you shall know what I mean, if plain words can tell you. You and I had a  friend, Phil. He was a good friend to me, and I liked him as much as a man of  the world can afford to like anybody. If I had been down in the world, and had  asked him for a hundred pounds to give me a new start in life, I think he&rsquo;d  have said, &lsquo;George, here&rsquo;s a cheque for you.&rsquo; <em>That&rsquo;s</em> my notion of a friend. And yet I stood by that man&rsquo;s  deathbed, and saw him sinking, and knew what ailed him, and didn&rsquo;t stretch out  my hand to save him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be so good as to move away from that door,&rdquo; said  Mr. Sheldon, livid to the lips with smothered fury, but able to put on a bold  front nevertheless. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here to listen to rhodomontade of this kind,  or to bandy words with you. Get out of my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till I&rsquo;ve said my say. There shall be no  rhodomontade this time. I stood by and saw my best friend murdered &mdash; by you. I  kept my counsel for your sake, and when you had made your fortune &mdash; by his  death &mdash; I asked you for a little money. You know how much you gave me, and how  graciously you gave it. If you had given me twenty times the sum you gained by  Tom Halliday&rsquo;s death, I would give it back, and twenty times as much again, to  bring him back to life, and to feel that I had never aided and abetted a  murderer. Yes, by God, I would! though I&rsquo;m not straitlaced or over-scrupulous  at the best of times. But that&rsquo;s past, and all the money in the Bank of England  wouldn&rsquo;t undo what you did in Fitzgeorge Street. But if you try on any such  tricks with Tom Halliday&rsquo;s daughter, if <em>that&rsquo;s</em> the scheme you&rsquo;ve hatched for getting hold of this money, as surely as we two  live, I&rsquo;ll let in the light upon your doings, and save the girl whose father  you murdered. I will, Philip, let come what may. You can&rsquo;t get <em>me</em> out of the way when it suits you, you  see. <em>I know you.</em> That&rsquo;s the best  antidote against your medicines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be so good as to say these things on  &rsquo;Change, I can bring an action for libel, or get you put into a madhouse.  There&rsquo;s no good in saying them here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip Sheldon, even in this crisis, was less  agitated than his brother, being of a harder nature, and less subject to random  impulses of good or evil. He caught his accuser by the collar of his coat, and  flung him violently from the doorway. Thus ended his visit to Gray&rsquo;s Inn.</p>
<p>Boldly as he had borne himself during the  interview, he went to his office profoundly depressed and dispirited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am to have him against me?&rdquo; he said to  himself. &ldquo;He can do me no real harm; but he can harass and annoy me. If he  should drop any hint to Hawkehurst? &mdash; but he&rsquo;ll scarcely do that. Perhaps I&rsquo;ve  ridden him a little too roughly in the past. And yet if I&rsquo;d been smoother,  where would his demands have ended? No; concession in these cases means ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shut himself in his office, and sat down to his  desk to confront his difficulties. For a long time the bark which was freighted  with Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s fortunes had been sailing in troubled waters. He had been  an unconscious disciple of Lord Bacon, inasmuch as the boldness inculcated by  that philosopher had been the distinguishing characteristic of his conduct in  all the operations of life. As a speculator, his boldness had served him well.  Adventures from which timid spirits shrunk appalled had brought golden harvests  to this daring gamester. When some rich argosy upon the commercial ocean fired  her minute-guns, and sent up signals of distress, menaced by the furious  tempest, lifted high on the crest of mountainous waves, below which, black and  fathomless, yawn the valleys of death, &mdash; a frail ark hovering above the  ravening jaws of all-devouring Poseidon, &mdash; Philip Sheldon was among that chosen  band of desperate wreckers who dared to face the storm, and profit by the  tempest and terror. From such argosies, while other men watched and waited for  a gleam of sunlight on the dark horizon, Mr. Sheldon had obtained for himself  goodly merchandise. The debenture of railways that were in bad odour; Unitas  Bank shares, immediately after the discovery of gigantic embezzlements by  Swillenger, the Unitas-Bank secretary; the Mole-and-Burrow railway stock, when  the Mole-and-Burrow scheme was as yet in the clouds, and the wiseacres  prognosticated its failure; the shares in foreign loans, which the Rothschilds  were buying <em>sub rosa</em>; &mdash; these, and  such as these, had employed Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s capital; and from the skilful  manipulation of capital thus employed, Mr. Sheldon had trebled the fortune  secured by his alliance with Tom Halliday&rsquo;s widow.</p>
<p>It had been the stockbroker&rsquo;s fate to enter the money  market at a time when fortunes were acquired with an abnormal facility. He had  made the most of his advantages, and neglected none of his opportunities. He  had seized Good Fortune by the forelock, and not waited to find the harridan&rsquo;s  bald and slippery crown turned to him in pitiless derision. He had made only  one mistake &mdash; and that he made in common with many of his fellow-players in the  great game of speculation always going on eastward of Temple Bar &mdash; he had  mistaken the abnormal for the normal: he had imagined that these splendid  opportunities were the natural evolvements of an endless sequence of everyday  events; and when the sequence was abruptly broken, and when last of the seven  fat kine vanished off the transitory scene of life, to make way for a dismal  succession of lean kine, there was no sanguine youngster newly admitted to the  sacred privileges of &ldquo;The House&rdquo; more astounded by the change than Mr. Sheldon.</p>
<p>The panic came like a thief in the night, and it  found Mr. Sheldon a speculator for the rise. The Melampuses and Amphiar&auml;uses of  the Stock Exchange had agreed in declaring that a man who bought into consols  at 90 <em>must</em> see his capital increased;  and what was true of this chief among securities was of course true of other  securities. The panic came, and from 90, consols declined dismally, slowly,  hopelessly, to 85-1/2; securities less secure sank with a rapidity  corresponding with their constitutional weakness. As during the ravages of an  epidemic the weaker are first to fall victims to the destroyer, so while this  fever raged on &rsquo;Change, the feeble enterprises, the &ldquo;risky&rdquo; transactions, sank  at an appalling rate, some to total expiry. The man who holds a roaring lion by  the tail could scarcely be worse off than the speculator in these troublous  times. To let go is immediate loss, to hold on for a certain time might be  redemption, could one but know the exact moment in which it would be wise to  let go. But to hold on until the beast grows more and more furious, and then to  let go and be eaten up alive, is what many men did in that awful crisis.</p>
<p>If Philip Sheldon had accepted his first loss, and  been warned by the first indication that marked the turning of the tide, he  would have been a considerable loser; but he would not accept his loss, and he  would not be warned by that early indication. He had implicit belief in his own  cleverness; and he fancied if every other bark in that tempest-tossed ocean  foundered and sank, his boat might ride triumphantly across the harbour-bar,  secure by virtue of his science and daring as a navigator. It was not till he  had seen a small fortune melt away in the payment of contango, that he  consented to the inevitable. The mistakes of one year devoured the fruits of  nine years&rsquo; successful enterprise, and the Philip Sheldon of this present year  was no richer than the man who had stood by Tom Halliday&rsquo;s bedside and waited  the advent of the equal foot that knows no difference between the threshold of  kingly palace or pauper refuge. Not only did he find himself as poor a man as  in that hateful stage of his existence &mdash; to remember which was a dull dead pain  even to <em>him</em> &mdash; but a man infinitely  more heavily burdened. He had made for himself a certain position, and the fall  from that must needs be a cruel and damaging fall, the utter annihilation of  all his chances in life.</p>
<p>The stockbroker&rsquo;s fitful slumbers at this time  began to be haunted by the vision of a black board fixed against the wall of a  public resort, a black board on which appeared his own name. In what strange  places feverish dreams showed him this hideous square of painted deal! &mdash; Now it  was on the walls of the rooms he lived in; now on the door of a church, like  Luther&rsquo;s propositions; now at a street-corner, where should have been the name  of the street; now inky-black against the fair white headstone of his own  grave. Miserable dream, miserable man, for whom the scraping together of sordid  dross was life&rsquo;s only object, and who, in losing money, lost all!</p>
<p>This agonizing consciousness of loss and of  close-impending disgrace was the wolf which this Spartan stockbroker concealed  beneath his waistcoat day after day, while the dull common, joyless course of  his existence went on; and his shallow wife smiled at him from the opposite  side of his hearth, more interested in a new stitch for her crotchet or  berlin-wool work than by the inner life of her husband; and Charlotte and her  lover contemplated existence from their own point of view, and cherished their  own dreams and their own hopes, and were, in all things, as far away from the  moody meditator as if they had been natives of Upper India.</p>
<p>The ruin which impended over the unlucky speculator  was not immediate, but it was not far off; the shadow of it already wrapped him  in a twilight obscurity. His repute as a clever and a safe man had left him. He  was described now as a daring man; and the wiseacres shook their heads as they  talked of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the next to go will be Sheldon,&rdquo; said the  wiseacres; but in these days of commercial epidemic there was no saying who  would be the first to go. It was the end of the world in little. One was taken,  and another left. The Gazette overran its customary column like a swollen  river, and flooded a whole page of the Times newspaper; and men looked to the  lists of names in the Wednesday and Saturday papers as to the trump of  archangels sounding the destruction of the universe.</p>
<p>For some time the bark in which Mr. Sheldon had  breasted those turbulent waters had been made of paper. This was nothing. Paper  boats were the prevailing shipping in those waters; but Captain Sheldon&rsquo;s bark  needed refitting, and the captain feared a scarcity of paper, or, worse still,  the awful edict issued from some commercial Areopagus that for him there should  be no more paper.</p>
<p>Once before, Mr. Sheldon had found himself face to  face with ruin complete and irredeemable. When all common expedients had been  exhausted, and his embarrassments had become desperate, he had found a  desperate expedient, and had extricated himself from those embarrassments. The  time had come in which a new means of extrication must be found as desperate as  the last, if need were. As Philip Sheldon had faced the situation before, he  faced it now &mdash; unshrinkingly, though with a gloomy anger against destiny. It  was hard for him that such a thing should have to be repeated. If he pitied  anybody, he pitied himself; and this kind of compassion is very common with  this kind of character. Do not the Casket letters show us &mdash; if we may trust  them to show us anything &mdash; that Mary Stuart was very sorry for herself when she  found herself called upon to make an end of Darnley? In Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s  wonderful study in morbid anatomy, there are perhaps no finer touches than  those which reveal the Queen&rsquo;s selfish compassion for her own heartlessness.</p>

  Diana Asks For A Holiday</h2>
<p>Diana informed Mrs. Sheldon of her father&rsquo;s wish  that she should leave Bayswater. Before doing this, she had obtained the  Captain&rsquo;s consent to the revelation of her engagement to be married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to leave them in a mysterious manner,  papa,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have told Charlotte a good deal already, under a promise of  secrecy; but I should like to tell Mrs. Sheldon that there is a real reason for  my leaving her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, my love, since you are so amazingly  squeam &mdash; honourable,&rdquo; interposed the Captain, remembering how much depended on  his daughter&rsquo;s marriage, and what a very difficult person he had found her.  &ldquo;Yes, my dear, of course; I respect your honourable feeling; and &mdash; er &mdash; yes &mdash;  you may tell Mrs. Sheldon &mdash; and that of course includes Mr. Sheldon, since the  lady is but an inoffensive cipher &mdash; that you are about to be married &mdash; to a  French gentleman of position. You will, of course, be obliged to mention his  name, and then will arise the question as to where and how you met him; and,  upon my word, it&rsquo;s confoundedly awkward that you should insist on enlightening  these people. You see, my dear girl, what I want to avoid, for the present, is  any chance of collision between the Sheldons and Lenoble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; exclaimed Diana, impatiently, &ldquo;why must  there be all this scheming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, very well, Miss Paget; tell them what you  like!&rdquo; cried the Captain, aggravated beyond endurance by such inherent  perversity. &ldquo;All I can say is, that a young woman who quarrels with her  bread-and-butter is likely to come to dry bread; and very little of that,  perhaps. I wash my hands of the business. Tell them what you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not tell them more than I feel to be  actually necessary, papa,&rdquo; the young lady replied calmly. &ldquo;I do not think Mr.  Sheldon will trouble himself about M. Lenoble. He seems very much occupied by  his own affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Sheldon seems harassed, anxious, does he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, papa; I have thought so for the last  few months. If I may venture to judge by the expression of his face, as he sits  at home in the evening, reading the paper, or staring at the fire, I am sure he  has many anxieties &mdash; troubles even. Mrs. Sheldon and Charlotte do not appear to  notice these things. They are accustomed to see him quiet and reserved, and  they don&rsquo;t perceive the change in him as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, there is a change, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a decided change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the deuce couldn&rsquo;t you tell me this before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I tell you that Mr. Sheldon seems  anxious? I should not have told you now, if you had not appeared to dread his  interference in our affairs. I can&rsquo;t help observing these things; but I don&rsquo;t  want to play the part of a spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re so infernally punct &mdash; so  delicate-minded, my love,&rdquo; said the Captain, pulling himself up suddenly, for  the second time. &ldquo;Forgive me if I was impatient just now. You look at these  things from a higher point of view than that of a battered old man of the world  like me. But if you should see anything remarkable in Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s conduct on  another occasion, my love, I should be obliged to you if you would be more  communicative. He and I have been allied in business, you see, and it is  important for me to know these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not seen anything remarkable in Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s conduct, papa; I have only seen him thoughtful and dispirited. And I  suppose anxieties are common to every man of business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Georgy received Miss Paget&rsquo;s announcement with  mingled lamentations and congratulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I am heartily glad for your sake,  Diana,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but what we shall do without you, I don&rsquo;t know. Who is to  see to the drawing-room being dusted every morning, when you are gone? I&rsquo;m sure  I tremble for the glass shades. Don&rsquo;t imagine I&rsquo;m not pleased to think you  should settle in life advantageously, my love. I&rsquo;m not so selfish as that; though  I will say that there never was a girl with more natural talent for making-up  pretty little caps than you. The one I have on has been admired by everybody.  Even Ann Woolper this morning, when I was going into the butcher&rsquo;s book with  her &mdash; for I insist upon going into the butcher&rsquo;s book with her weekly, whether  she likes it or not; though the way that man puts down the items is so  bewildering that I feel myself a perfect baby in her hands, &mdash; even Ann admired  it, and said how young-looking it is. And then she brought up the time in  Fitzgeorge Street, and poor Tom&rsquo;s illness, and almost upset me for the rest of  the day. And now, dear, let me offer you my sincere congratulations. Of course,  you know that you would always have had a home with me; but service, or at  least companionship, is no inheritance, as the proverb says; and for your own  sake I&rsquo;m very glad to think that you are going to have a house of your own. And  now tell me what he is like, Monsieur what&rsquo;s-his-name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheldon had been told, but had not remembered  the name. Her great anxiety, as well as Charlotte&rsquo;s, was to know what manner of  man the affianced lover was. If Diana&rsquo;s future happiness had been contingent on  the shape of her husband&rsquo;s nose, or the colour of his eyes, these two ladies could  not have been more anxious upon the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he long eyelashes, and a dreamy look in his  eyes, like Valentine?&rdquo; asked Charlotte, secretly convinced that her lover had a  copyright in these personal graces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he wear whiskers?&rdquo; asked Georgy. &ldquo;I remember,  when I was quite a girl, and went to parties at Barlingford, being struck by  Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s whiskers. And I was quite offended with papa, who was always  making sarcastic remarks, for calling them mutton-chop whiskers; but they  really were the shape of mutton-cutlets at that time. He wears them differently  now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheldon branched off into a disquisition on  whiskers, and Diana escaped from the task of describing her lover. She could  not have described him to Georgy.</p>
<p>By-and-by she asked permission to leave Bayswater  for a fortnight, in order to see her lover&rsquo;s home and friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will come back to you, and stay as long as you  like, dear Mrs. Sheldon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and make you as many caps as you please.  And I will make them for you by and by, when I am living abroad, and send them  over to you in a bandbox. It will be a great delight to me to be of some little  service to a friend who has been so kind. And perhaps you will fancy the caps  are prettier when they can boast of being French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You darling generous-minded girl! And you won&rsquo;t go  away for a fortnight and never come back again, will you, dear? I had a cook  who did that, and left me with a large dinner-party hanging over my head; and  how I got through it &mdash; with a strange man-cook, who charged a guinea, and used  fresh butter, at twentypence, a pound, as if it had been dirt, and two strange  men to wait &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know. It all seemed like a dream. And since then we have  generally had everything from the confectioner&rsquo;s; and I assure you, to feel that  you can wash your hands of the whole thing, and sit down at the head of your  table with your mind as free from care as if you were a visitor, is worth all  the expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana promised she would not behave like the cook;  and two days after this conversation left the London Bridge terminus with her  father and Gustave Lenoble.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon troubled himself very little about this  departure. He was informed of Miss Paget&rsquo;s intended marriage; and the  information awakened neither surprise nor interest in his heavily-burdened  mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Frenchman, a friend of her father&rsquo;s!&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;some swindling adventurer, no doubt,&rdquo; he thought. And this was as much  consideration as he could afford to bestow upon Miss Paget&rsquo;s love affairs at  this present time.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
  Assurance Doubly Sure</h2>
<p>On the day after Miss Paget&rsquo;s departure Mr. Sheldon  came home from the City rather earlier than usual, and found Charlotte alone in  the drawing-room, reading a ponderous volume from Mudie of an instructive and  edifying character, with a view to making herself clever, in order that she  might better understand that prodigy of learning, Mr. Hawkehurst.</p>
<p>She was somewhat inclined to yawn over the big  book, which contained a graphic account of recent discoveries of an antiquarian  nature. Her mind was not yet attuned to the comprehension of the sublimer  elements in such discoveries. She saw only a dry as dust record of futile  gropings in desert sand for the traces of perished empires. Her imagination was  not cultivated to that point whereat the gift which Mr. Lewes calls &ldquo;insight&rdquo;  becomes the daily companion, nay, indeed, the ever-haunting and  nightmare-bringing influence of the dreamer. For her sands were only sands, the  stones were only stones. No splendour of fallen palaces, no glory and pride of  perished kings, no clash and clamour of vanished courts, arose from those  barren sands, with all their pomp and circumstance, conjured into being by half  a word on a broken pillar, or a date upon a Punic monument. Miss Halliday  looked up with a sigh of fatigue as her stepfather came into the room. It was  not a room that he particularly affected, and she was surprised when he seated  himself in the easy-chair opposite her, and poked the fire, as if with the  intention of remaining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t read by firelight, my dear,&rdquo; he  said; &ldquo;it is most destructive to the eyesight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say my sight will last my time, papa,&rdquo; the  young lady replied carelessly; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s very kind of you to think of it, and I  won&rsquo;t read any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon made no reply to this observation. He  sat looking at the fire, with that steady gaze which was habitual to him &mdash; the  gaze of the man who plans and calculates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said by-and-by, &ldquo;it seems that this  money to which you may or may not be entitled is more than we thought at first;  in fact, it appears that the sum is a considerable one. I have been, and still  am, particularly anxious to guard against disappointment on your part, as I  know the effect that such a disappointment is apt to produce upon a person&rsquo;s  life. The harassing slowness of Chancery proceedings is proverbial; I am  therefore especially desirous that you should not count upon this money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never do that, papa. I should certainly  like a fine edition of the Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica for Valentine, by-and-by, as  he says that is essential for a literary man; and a horse, for people say  literary men ought to take horse exercise. But beyond that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need scarcely go into these details, my dear. I  want you to understand the broad facts of the case. While, on the one hand, our  success in obtaining the inheritance which we are about to claim for you is  uncertain, on the other hand the inheritance is large. Of course, when I  presented you with the sum of five thousand pounds, I had no idea of this  possible inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, of course not, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I now find that there is such a possibility as  your becoming a &mdash; well &mdash; a rich woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which case I may conclude that your mother  would benefit in some measure from your good fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you doubt that, papa? There should be no  measure to her benefit from any money obtained by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not doubt that, my dear. And it is with that  idea that I wish to make a proposition to you &mdash; for your mother&rsquo;s possible  advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be happy to do anything you wish, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be done as a spontaneous act of your own,  Charlotte, not in accordance with any wish of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it that I am to do?&rdquo; asked Charlotte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, you see it is agreed between us  that if you do get this money, your mother is certain to benefit considerably.  But unhappily the proceedings are likely to drag on for an indefinite time; and  in the course of that time it comes within the limits of possibility that your  decease may precede that of your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In which case your mother would lose all hope of  any such advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte could not help thinking that there was  something sordid in this discussion &mdash; this calculation of possible gain or loss  contingent on her fresh young life. But she concluded that it was the nature of  business men to see everything from a debased standpoint, and that Mr. Sheldon  was no more sordid than other men of his class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, papa?&rdquo; she asked presently, after some  moments of silence, during which she and her stepfather had both been absorbed  in the contemplation of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sheldon slowly, &ldquo;I  have been thinking that the natural and easy way of guarding against all  contingencies would be by your effecting an insurance on your life in your  mother&rsquo;s favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, papa!&rdquo; cried Charlotte, with unwonted  vehemence; &ldquo;I would rather do anything than that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can be your objection to such a very simple  arrangement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say my objection seems foolish, childish  even, papa; but I really have a horror of life assurances. I always think of  papa &mdash; my own poor father, whom I loved so dearly. It seemed as if he put a  price upon his life for us. He was so anxious to insure his life &mdash; I remember  hearing him talk of it at Hyley, when I was a child &mdash; to make things straight,  as he said, for us; and, you see, very soon afterwards he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t suppose the insurance of his life  had anything to do with his death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, I am not so childish as that;  only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only you have a foolish lackadaisical prejudice  against the only means by which you can protect your mother against a  contingency that is so remote as to be scarcely worth consideration. Let it  pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was more anger in the tone than in the words.  It was not that angry tone, but the mention of her mother, that impressed Miss  Halliday. She began to consider that her objections were both foolish and  selfish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you really think I ought to insure my life, I  will do so,&rdquo; she said presently. &ldquo;Papa did as much for those he loved; why  should I be less thoughtful of others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having once brought Miss Halliday to this frame of  mind, the rest was easy. It was agreed between them that as Valentine  Hawkehurst was to be kept in ignorance of his betrothed&rsquo;s claim to certain  moneys now in the shadowy under-world of Chancery, so he must be kept in  ignorance of the insurance.</p>
<p>It was only one more secret, and Charlotte had  learned that it was possible to keep a secret from her lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose before we are married I shall be able to  tell him everything?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my dear. All I want is to test his  endurance and his prudence. If the course of events proves him worthy of being  trusted, I will trust him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid of that, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, my dear. But, you see, I have to protect  your interests; and I cannot afford to see this gentleman with your eyes. I am  compelled to be prudent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stockbroker sighed as he said this &mdash; a sigh of  utter weariness. Remorse was unknown to him; the finer fibres upon which that  chord is struck had not been employed in the fabrication of his heart. But  there is a mental fatigue which is a spurious kind of remorse, and has all the  anguish of the nobler feeling. It is an utter weariness and prostration of  spirit &mdash; a sickness of heart and mind &mdash; a bitter longing to lie down and die &mdash;  the weariness of a beaten hound rather than of a baffled man.</p>
<p>This was what Mr. Sheldon felt, as the threads of  the web which he was weaving multiplied, and grew daily and hourly more  difficult of manipulation. Success in the work which he had to do depended on  so many contingencies. Afar off glittered the splendid goal &mdash; the undisputed  possession of the late John Haygarth&rsquo;s hundred thousand pounds; but between the  schemer and that chief end and aim of all his plottings what a sea of troubles!  He folded his arms behind his head, and looked across the girlish face of his  companion into the shadow and the darkness. In those calculations which were  for ever working themselves out in this man&rsquo;s brain, Charlotte Halliday was only  one among many figures. She had her fixed value in every sum; but her beauty,  her youth, her innocence, her love, her trust, made no unit of that fixed  figure, nor weighed in the slightest degree with him who added up the sum. Had  she been old, ugly, obnoxious, a creature scarcely fit to live, she would have  represented exactly the same amount in the calculations of Philip Sheldon. The  graces that made her beautiful were graces that he had no power to estimate. He  knew she was a pretty woman; but he knew also that there were pretty women to  be seen in any London street; and the difference between his stepdaughter and  the lowest of womankind who passed him in his daily walks was to him little  more than a social prejudice.</p>
<p>The insurance business being once decided on, Mr.  Sheldon lost no time in putting it into execution. Although he made a point of  secrecy as regarded Mr. Hawkehurst, he went to work in no underhand manner, but  managed matters after a highly artistic and superior fashion. He took his stepdaughter  to the offices of Greenwood and Greenwood, and explained her wishes to one of  those gentlemen in her presence. If he dwelt a little more on Miss Halliday&rsquo;s  anxiety for her mother&rsquo;s pecuniary advantage than his previous conversation  with Miss Halliday warranted, the young lady was too confiding and too  diffident to contradict him. She allowed him to state, or rather to imply, that  the proposed insurance was her spontaneous wish, an emanation of her anxious  and affectionate heart, the natural result of an almost morbid care for her  mother&rsquo;s welfare.</p>
<p>Mr. Hargrave Greenwood, of Greenwood and Greenwood,  seemed at first inclined to throw cold water on the proposition, but after some  little debate, agreed that extreme caution would certainly counsel such a step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should imagine there was no better life amongst  the inhabitants of London,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than Miss Shel &mdash; pardon me &mdash; Miss  Halliday&rsquo;s. But, as the young lady herself suggests, &lsquo;in the midst of life we  are&mdash;&rsquo;; and, as the young lady herself has observed, these things are &mdash; ahem &mdash;  beyond human foresight. If there were any truth in the aphorisms of poets, I  should say Miss Halliday cannot insure too quickly; for the remark of Cowper &mdash;  or, stay, I believe Pope&mdash;&lsquo;whom the gods love die young,&rsquo; might very well be  supposed to apply to so charming a young lady. Happily, the secretaries of  insurance offices know very little about the poets, unless, indeed, Miss  Halliday were to go to the Royal Widow&rsquo;s and Orphan&rsquo;s Hope, the secretary of  which is the author of dramas that may fairly rank with the works of Knowles  and Lytton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, an elderly gentleman of the  ponderous and port-wine school, laughed at his own small jokes, and took things  altogether pleasantly. He gave Mr. Sheldon a letter of introduction to the  secretary of his pet insurance company, the value of which to that gentleman  was considerable. Nor was this the only advantage derived from the interview.  The lawyer&rsquo;s approval of the transaction reassured Charlotte; and though she  had heard her own views somewhat misrepresented, she felt that an operation  which appeared wise in the sight of such a lawyer, standing on such a Turkey  hearthrug, commanding such gentlemanly-looking clerks as those who came and  went at Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s bidding, must inevitably be a proceeding at once  prudent and proper.</p>
<p>The business of the insurance was not quite so easy  as the interview with the lawyer. The doctor to whom Miss Halliday was  introduced seemed very well satisfied with that young lady&rsquo;s appearance of  health and spirits, but in a subsequent interview with Mr. Sheldon asked  several questions, and shook his head gravely when told that her father had  died at thirty-seven years of age. But he looked less grave when informed that  Mr. Halliday had died of a bilious fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Halliday die in London?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like &mdash; ahem &mdash; if it were possible, to see  the medical man who attended him. These fevers rarely prove fatal unless there  is some predisposing cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this case there was none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak rather confidently, Mr. Sheldon, as a  non-professional man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak with a certain amount of professional  knowledge. I knew Tom
  Halliday for many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon forebore to state that Tom Halliday had  died in his house, and had been attended by him. It is, perhaps, only natural  that Philip Sheldon, the stockbroker of repute, should wish to escape  identification with Philip Sheldon, the unsuccessful dentist of Bloomsbury.</p>
<p>After a little more conversational skirmishing, the  confidential physician of the Prudential Step Assurance Company agreed to  consider that Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s constitution had been in no manner compromised by  his early death, and to pass Charlotte&rsquo;s life. The motives for effecting the  insurance were briefly touched upon in Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s letter of introduction,  and appeared very proper and feasible in the eyes of the directors; so, after a  delay of a few days, the young lady found herself accepted, and Mr. Sheldon put  away among his more important papers a large oblong envelope, containing a  policy of assurance on his stepdaughter&rsquo;s life for five thousand pounds. He did  not, however, stop here, but made assurance doubly sure by effecting a second  insurance upon the same young life with the Widow&rsquo;s and Orphan&rsquo;s Hope Society,  within a few days of the first transaction.</p>

  At C&ocirc;tenoir</h2>
<p class="note">BEAUBOCAGE, NEAR VEVINORD, March 15, 186 &mdash; .</p>
<p class="note">My darling Lotta, &mdash; As you extorted from me a  solemn pledge that I would write you a full and detailed account of my adventures,  I seat myself in Mademoiselle Lenoble&rsquo;s pretty little turret-chamber, in the  hope of completing the first instalment of my work before papa or Gustave  summons me to prepare for a drive and visit to the Convent of the Sacred Heart,  which, I believe, has been planned for to-day.</p>
<p class="note">What am I to tell you, dear, and how shall I begin  my story? Let me fancy myself sitting at your feet before your bedroom fire,  and you looking down at me with that pretty inquisitive look in your dear grey  eyes. Do you know that M. Lenoble&rsquo;s eyes are almost the colour of yours, Lotta?  You asked me a dozen questions about his eyes the other day, and I could give  you no clear description of them; but yesterday, as he stood at the window  looking out across the garden, I saw their real colour. It is grey, a deep  clear grey, and his lashes are dark, like yours. How shall I begin? That is the  grand difficulty! I suppose you will want to know something even about the  journey. Everything was very pleasant, in spite of the cold blusterous March  weather. Do you know what my last journey was like, Lotta? It was the long  dreary journey from For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne to St. Katharine&rsquo;s Wharf, when Mr. Hawkehurst  advised and arranged my return to England. I had been sitting quite alone in a  balcony overlooking the little town. It was after midnight, but the lights were  still burning: I can see the lamplit windows shining through the night mist as  I write this, and the sense of the hopeless misery of that time comes back to  me like the breath of some freezing wind. I can find no words to tell you how  desolate I was that night, or how hopeless.</p>
<p class="note">I dared not think of my future life; or of the next  day, that was to be the beginning of that hopeless future. I was obliged to  bind my thoughts to the present and all its dreariness; and a kind of dull  apathetic feeling, which was too dull for despair, took possession of me that  night. While I was sitting there Mr. Hawkehurst came to me, and told me that my  father had become involved in a quarrel, under circumstances of a very shameful  nature, which I need not tell you, darling. He recommended me to leave  For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne &mdash; indeed, almost insisted that I should do so. He wanted to rescue  me from that miserable life. Your lover had noble and generous impulses even  then, you see, dear; at his worst he was not all bad, and needed only your  gentle influence to purify and elevate his character. He gave me all the money  he possessed to pay the expenses of my journey. Ah, what a dreary journey! I  left For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne in the chill daybreak, and travelled third class, with  dreadful Belgians who smelt of garlic, to Antwerp. I slept at a very humble inn  near the quay, and started for England by the Baron Osy at noon next day. I  cannot tell you how lonely I felt on board the steamer. I had travelled  uncomfortably before, but never without my father and Valentine &mdash; and he had  been always kind to me. If we were shabbily dressed, and people thought ill of  us, I did not care. The spirit of Bohemianism must have been very strong with  me in those days. I remembered how we had sat together on the same boat  watching the sleepy shores of Holland, or making fun of our respectable  fellow-passengers. Now I was quite alone. People stared at me rudely and  unkindly, as I thought. I could not afford to dine or breakfast with the rest;  and I was weak enough to feel wounded by the idea that people would guess my  motive for shunning the savoury banquets that sent up such horrid odours to the  deck where I sat, trying to read a tattered Tauchnitz novel. And the end of my  journey? Ah, Charlotte, you can never imagine what it is to travel like that,  without knowing whether there is any haven, any shelter for you at the end of  your wanderings! I knew that at a certain hour we were to arrive at St.  Katharine&rsquo;s Dock, but beyond that I knew nothing. I counted my money. There was  just enough to pay for a cab that would carry me to Hyde Lodge. I should land  there penniless. And what if my cousin Priscilla should refuse to receive me?  For a moment I fancied even that possible; and I pictured myself walking about  London, hungry and homeless.</p>
<p class="note">This was my last journey. I have dwelt upon it  longer than I need have done; but I want you to understand what it is that  makes Gustave Lenoble dear to me. If you could feel the contrast between the  past and the present as I felt it when I stood on the deck of the Dover packet  with him by my side, you would know why I love him, and am grateful to him. We  stood side by side, watching the waves and talking of our future, while my  father enjoyed a nap in one of the little deck cabins. To Gustave that future  seems very bright and clear; to me it seems unutterably strange that the future <em>can</em> be anything but a dismal <em>terra incognita</em>, from the contemplation  of which it is wise to refrain.</p>
<p class="note">Papa stays with Gustave at C&ocirc;tenoir; but it had  been arranged for me to visit Mademoiselle Lenoble, Gustave&rsquo;s aunt, at  Beaubocage, and to remain with her during my stay in Normandy. I at once  understood the delicate feeling which prompted this arrangement. We dined at  Rouen, and came to Vevinord in a coach. At Vevinord a queer little countrified  vehicle met us, with a very old man, of the farm-servant class, as coachman.  Gustave took the reins from the old man&rsquo;s hand and drove to Beaubocage, where  Mademoiselle Lenoble received me with much cordiality. She is a dear old lady,  with silvery bands of hair neatly arranged under the prettiest of caps. Her  gown is black silk, and her collar and cuffs of snowy whiteness; everything  about her exquisitely neat, and of the fashion of twenty, or perhaps thirty,  years ago.</p>
<p class="note">And now, I suppose, you will want to know what  Beaubocage is like. Well, dear, much as I admire Mademoiselle Lenoble, I must  confess that her ancestral mansion is neither grand nor pretty. It might have  made a very tolerable farmhouse, but has been spoiled by the architect&rsquo;s  determination to make it a ch&acirc;teau. It is a square white building, with two  pepper-castor-like turrets, in one of which I write this letter. Between the  garden and the high road there is a wall, surmounted with plaster vases. The  garden is for the greater part utilitarian; but in front of the salon windows  there is a grassplot, bordered by stiff gravel-walks, and relieved by a couple  of flower-beds. A row of tall poplars alone screens the house from the dusty  high road. At the back of it there is an orchard; on one side a farmyard;  behind the orchard lie the fields that compose the farm of Beaubocage and the  paternal estate of the Lenoble family. All around the country is very flat. The  people seem to be kind and simple, and devotedly attached to &ldquo;Mademoiselle.&rdquo;  There is a rustic peacefulness pervading everything which, for me, stands  instead of beauty.</p>
<p class="note">I am hypocrite enough to pretend to be pleased with  everything, for I can perceive how anxiously M. Lenoble watches me in order to  discover whether I like his native country. He was not born at Beaubocage, but  in Paris. Mademoiselle Lenoble told me the story of his childhood, and how she  brought him to Beaubocage, when quite a little fellow, from Rouen, where his  father died. About his mother there seems to have been some mystery.  Mademoiselle told me nothing of this, except that her brother, Gustave the  elder, made a love-match, and thereby offended his father. She has the little  crib in which her nephew, Gustave the younger, slept on the night of his  coming. It had been his father&rsquo;s little bed thirty years before. She shed tears  as she told me the story, and how she sat and watched by the little fellow as  he cried himself to sleep with his head lying on her arm, and the summer  moonlight shining full upon his face.</p>
<p class="note">I was deeply touched by her manner as she told me  these things; and I think, if I had not already learned to love M. Lenoble, I  should love him for the sake of his aunt. She is charming; a creature so  innocent and pure, that one considers one&rsquo;s words in speaking to her, almost as  if she were a child. She is about forty years older than I; yet for worlds I  would not tell her of the people and the scenes I have beheld at foreign  watering-places and gambling-rooms. She has spent the sixty years of her life  so completely out of the world, that she has retained the freshness and  sweetness of her youth untainted in the least degree. Can there be magical  philtre equal to this &mdash; a pure unselfish life, far away from the clamour of  cities?</p>
<p class="note">The old servant who waits upon me is seventy-five  years of age, and remembers Ma&rsquo;amselle Cydalise from her childhood. She is  always singing the praises of her mistress, and she sees that I like to hear  them. &ldquo;Ah, ma&rsquo;amselle,&rdquo; she said to me, &ldquo;to marry a Lenoble is to marry one of  the angels. I will not say that the old seigneur was not hard towards his son.  Ah, yes, but it was a noble heart. And the young monsieur &mdash; that one who died  in Rouen, the Poor! &mdash; ah, that he was kind, that he was gracious! What of  tears, what of regrets, when the Old chased him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">My position is quite recognised. I think the very  cowboy in the farmyard &mdash; a broad-shouldered lad, with a good-natured mindless  face, and prodigious wooden shoes like clumsy canoes &mdash; even the cowboy knows  that I am to be Madame Lenoble of C&ocirc;tenoir. C&ocirc;tenoir is the Windsor Castle of  this district; Beaubocage is only Frogmore. Yes, dear, the bond is signed and  sealed. Even if I did not love M. Lenoble, I have bound myself to marry him;  but I do love him, and thank him with all my heart for having given a definite  end and aim to my life. Don&rsquo;t think I underrate your kindness, darling; I know  that I should never want a home while you could give me one. But &rsquo;tis hard to be  a hanger-on in any household; and Valentine will exact all his sweet young  wife&rsquo;s love and care.</p>
<p class="note">I have written you a letter which I am sure will  require double postage; so I will say no more except goodbye. Take care of  yourself, dear one. Practise your part in our favourite duets; remember your  morning walk in the garden; and don&rsquo;t wear out your eyes over the big books  that Mr. Hawkehurst is obliged to read.</p>
<p class="note">Ever your affectionate</p>

<p class="note"><em>From  Charlotte Halliday to Diana Paget</em>.</p>
<p class="note">The dullest house in Christendom, Monday.</p>
<p class="note">EVER DEAREST Di, &mdash; Your letter was a welcome relief  to the weariness of my existence. How I wish I were with you! But that is too  bright a dream. I am sure I should idolise Beaubocage. I should not mind the  dismal row of poplars, or the flat landscape, or the dusty road, or anything,  so long as it was not like Bayswater. I languish for a change, dear. I have  seen so little of the world, except the dear moorland farmhouse at Newhall. I  don&rsquo;t think I was ever created to be &ldquo;cabined, cribbed, confined,&rdquo; in such a  narrow life as this, amid such a dull, unchanging round of daily commonplace.  Sometimes, when the cold spring moon is shining over the tree-tops in  Kensington-Gardens, I think of Switzerland, and the snow-clad mountains and fair  Alpine valleys we have read of and talked of, until my heart aches at the  thought that I may never see them; and to think that there are people in whom  the word &lsquo;Savoy&rsquo; awakes no fairer image than a cabbage! Ah, my poor dear! isn&rsquo;t  it almost wicked of me to complain, when <em>you</em> have had such bitter experience of the hard cruel world?</p>
<p class="note">I am quite in love with your dear Mademoiselle  Lenoble; almost as deeply as I am in love with your magnanimous, chivalrous,  generous, audacious &mdash; everything ending in <em>ous</em> &mdash; Monsieur Lenoble.</p>
<p class="note">How dare you call him M. Lenoble, by the bye? I  have counted the occasions on which you write of him in your nice long letter,  and for one Gustave there are half a dozen M. Lenobles. It must be Gustave in  future to me, remember.</p>
<p class="note">What shall I tell you, dear? I have nothing to  tell, really nothing. To say that I wish you were with me is only to confess  that I am very selfish; but I <em>do</em> wish  for you, dear &mdash; my friend and adopted sister, my old school companion, from  whom, willingly, I have never concealed one thought.</p>
<p class="note">Valentine called on Tuesday afternoon; but I have  nothing to tell you even about him. Mamma dozed in her corner after her cup of  tea, and Val and I sat by the fire talking over our future, just like you and  M. Lenoble on board the Calais boat. How much engaged people find to say about  the future! Is it our love that makes it seem so bright, so different from all  that has gone before? I cannot fancy life with Valentine otherwise than happy.  I strive to picture trials, and fancy myself in prison with him, the wind  blowing in at broken windows, the rain coming through the dilapidated roof and  pattering on the carpetless floor; but the most dismal picture I can paint  won&rsquo;t seem dismal if his figure is a part of it. We would stop the broken  windows with rags and paper, we would wipe up the rain with our  pocket-handkerchiefs, and sit side by side and talk of the future, as we do  now. Hope could never abandon us while we were together. And then, sometimes,  while I am looking at Valentine, the thought that he might die comes to me  suddenly, like the touch of an icy hand upon my heart.</p>
<p class="note">I lie awake at night sometimes thinking of this,  and of papa&rsquo;s early death. He came home one night with a cold, and from that  hour grew worse until he died. Ah, think what misery for a wife to suffer!  Happily for mamma, she is not capable of suffering intensely. She was very  sorry, and even now when she speaks of papa she cries a little; but the tears  don&rsquo;t hurt her. I think, indeed, they give her a kind of pleasure.</p>
<p class="note">See, dear, what a long egotistical letter I have  written, after all. I will say no more, except that while I am delighted to  think of your pleasure among new friends and new scenes, my selfish heart still  longs for the hour that is to bring you back to me.</p>
<p class="note">Pray tell me all you can about your daughters that  are to be.</p>
<p class="note">Ever and ever your loving CHARLOTTE.</p>

<p class="note"><em>From Diana  Paget to Charlotte Halliday</em>.</p>
<p class="note">Beaubocage, near Vevinord, March 30, 186 &mdash; .</p>
<p class="note">MY DEAR LOTTA, &mdash; In three days more I hope to be  with you; but I suppose, in the meantime, I must keep my promise, and send you  a faithful account of my life here. Everyone here is more kind to me than words  can tell; and I have nothing left to wish for, except that you were here to be  delighted, as I am sure you would be, with the freshness and the strangeness of  everything. If I ever do become Madame Lenoble &mdash; and even yet I <em>cannot</em> picture to myself that such a  thing will be &mdash; you must come to C&ocirc;tenoir, you and Valentine. I was taken  through every room in the old ch&acirc;teau the day before yesterday, and I fixed in  my own mind upon the rooms I will give you, if these things come to pass. They  are very old rooms, and I can fancy what strange people must have lived in  them, and died in them perhaps, in the days that are gone. But if you come to  them, they shall be made bright and pretty, and we will chase the shadows of  the medi&aelig;val age away. There are old pictures, old musical instruments, quaint  spindle-legged chairs and tables, tapestries that crumble as you touch them &mdash;  the ashes and relics of many generations. Gustave says we will sweep these poor  vestiges away, and begin a new life, when I come to C&ocirc;tenoir; but I cannot find  it in my heart to obliterate every trace of those dead feet that have come and  gone in all the dusky passages of my future home.</p>
<p class="note">And now I must tell you about my daughters that are  to be &mdash; my daughter that is, I may say of the elder &mdash; for I love her so well  already that no breach between Gustave and me could rob her of my affection.  She is the dearest, most loving of creatures; and she reminds me of you! I dare  say you will laugh at this, dear; and, mind, I do not say that Clarice Lenoble  is actually like you in complexion or feature &mdash; those common attributes which  every eye can see; the resemblance is far more subtle. There is a look in this  dear girl&rsquo;s face, a smile, an I-know-not-what, which every now and then recalls  your own bright countenance. You will say this is mere fancy &mdash; and that is what  I told myself at the first; but I found afterwards that it is no fancy, but  really one of those vague, indefinable, accidental likenesses which one  perceives so often. To me it seems a very happy accident; for my first glance  at my daughter&rsquo;s face told me that I should love her for your sake.</p>
<p class="note">We went to the convent the day before yesterday. It  is a curious old place, and was once a stately ch&acirc;teau, the habitation of a  noble family. A little portress, in the black robes of a lay sister, admitted  us, and conducted us to the parlour, a fine old room, decorated with pictures  of a religious character, painted by members of the sisterhood. Here Gustave  and I were received by the superioress, an elderly woman, with a mild holy  face, and a quiet grace of manner which might become a duchess. She sent for  the demoiselles Lenoble, and after a delay of a quarter of an hour &mdash; you  remember the toilet the girls at Hyde Lodge were obliged to make before they  went to the drawing-room, Lotta &mdash; Mademoiselle Lenoble came, a tall, slim,  lovely and lovable girl, who reminded me of the dearest friend I have in this  world. She ran to her papa first, and saluted him with an enthusiastic hug; and  then she stood for a moment looking shyly at me, confused and doubtful. It was  only for a moment she was left in doubt. Gustave bent down to whisper something  in her ear &mdash; something for which his letters had in some manner prepared her.  The fair young face brightened, the clear grey eyes looked up at me with a  sweet affectionate gaze, and she came to me and kissed me. &ldquo;I shall love you  very much,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;And I love you very much already,&rdquo; I answered, in  the same confidential manner. And I think these few words, that one pretty  confiding look in her innocent eyes, made a tie between us that it would take  much to loosen. Ah, Lotta, what a wide gulf between the Diana Paget who landed  alone at St. Katharine&rsquo;s Wharf, in the dim cheerless dawn, and uncertain where  to find a shelter in all that busy city, and the same creature redeemed by your  affection, and exalted by the love and trust of Gustave Lenoble!</p>
<p class="note">After this my second daughter appeared &mdash; a pretty  young hoyden, with lovable clinging ways; and then the superioress asked if I  would like to see the garden. Of course I said yes; and we were taken through  the long corridors, out into a fine old garden, where the pupils, who looked  like the Hyde Lodge girls translated into French, were prancing and scampering  about in the usual style. After the garden we went to the chapel, where there  were more pictures, and flower-bedecked altars, and pale twinkling tapers  burning here and there in the chill sunlight. Here there were damsels engaged  in pious meditation, from five years old upwards. They send even the little  ones to meditate, Clarice tells me; and there are these infants kneeling before  the flower-bedecked altars, rapt in religious contemplation, like so many  Thomas &agrave; Kempises. The young meditators glanced shyly at us as we passed. When  they had shown me everything of special interest in the pleasant old place,  Clarice and Madelon ran off to dress for walking, in order to accompany us to  C&ocirc;tenoir, where we were to dine.</p>
<p class="note">It was quite a family party. Mademoiselle Lenoble  was there, and papa. He arrived at the ch&acirc;teau while Gustave and I were paying  our visit to the convent. He is in the highest spirits, and treats me with an  amount of affection and courtesy I have not been accustomed to receive at his  hands. Of course I know the cause of this change; the future mistress of  C&ocirc;tenoir is a very different person from that wretched girl who was nothing to  him but a burden and an encumbrance. But even while I despise him I cannot  refuse to pity him. One forgives anything in old age. In this, at least, it is  a second childhood; and my father is very old, Lotta. I saw the look of age in  his face more plainly at C&ocirc;tenoir, where he assumed his usual <em>debonnaire</em> man-of-the-world tone and  manner, than I had seen it in London, when he was a professed invalid. He is  much changed since I was with him at For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne. It seems as if he had kept  Time at bay very long, and now at last, the common enemy will be held at  arm&rsquo;s-length no longer. He still braces himself up in the old military manner,  still holds himself more erect than many men of half his age; but, in spite of  all this, I can see that he is very feeble; shaken and worn by a long life of  difficulty. I am glad to think that there will be a haven for him at last; and  if I did not thank Gustave with my whole heart for giving me a home and a place  in the world, I should thank him for giving a shelter to my father.</p>
<p class="note">And now, dear, as I hope to be with you so very  soon, I shall say no more. I am to spend a day in Rouen before we come back &mdash;  papa and I, that is to say; Gustave stays in Normandy to make some arrangements  before he comes back to England. I cannot comprehend the business relations  between him and papa; but there is some business going on &mdash; law business, as it  seems to me &mdash; about which papa is very important and elated.</p>
<p class="note">I am to see the cathedral and churches at Rouen,  and I shall contrive to see the shops, and to bring you something pretty. Papa  has given me money &mdash; the first he ever gave me unasked. I have very little  doubt it comes from Gustave; but I have no sense of shame in accepting it. M.  Lenoble&rsquo;s seems to me a royal nature, formed to bestow benefits and bounties on  every side.</p>
<p class="note">Tell Mrs. Sheldon that I shall bring her the  prettiest cap I can find in
  Rouen; and, with all love, believe me ever your affectionate  DIANA.</p>

<h1 align="center"><em><a name="BookTheSeventh"></a>Book The Seventh<br>
  A Cloud Of Fear</em></h1>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  The Beginning Of Sorrow</h2>
<p>Who heeds the cloud no bigger than a man&rsquo;s hand  amidst a broad expanse of blue ether? The faint, scarce perceptible menace of  that one little cloud is lost in the wide brightness of a summer sky. The  traveller jogs on contented and unthinking, till the hoarse roar of stormy  winds, or the first big drops of the thunder-shower, startle him with a sudden  consciousness of the coming storm.</p>
<p>It was early May, and the young leaves were green  in the avenues of Kensington Gardens; Bayswater was bright and gay with  fashionable people; and Mrs. Sheldon found herself strong enough to enjoy her  afternoon drive in Hyde Park, where the contemplation of the bonnets afforded  her perennial delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they are actually smaller than ever this  year,&rdquo; she remarked every season; and every season the headgear of fashionable  London did indeed seem to shrink and dwindle, &ldquo;fine by degrees, and beautifully  less.&rdquo; The coalscuttle-shaped headdress of our grandmothers had not yet  resolved itself into a string of beads and a rosebud in these days, but was  obviously tending thitherward.</p>
<p>Charlotte and Diana accompanied Mrs. Sheldon in her  drives. The rapture of contemplating the bonnets was not complete unless the  lady had some sympathising spirit to share her delight. The two girls were very  well pleased to mingle in that brilliant crowd, and to go back to their own  quiet life when the mystic hour came, and that bright vision of colour and  beauty melted into the twilight loneliness. It had seemed just lately, however,  as if Charlotte was growing a little weary of the gorgeous spectacle &mdash; the  ever-changing, ever-splendid diorama of West End life. She no longer exclaimed  at the sight of each exceptional toilette; she no longer smiled admiringly on  the thoroughbred horses champing their bits in the immediate neighbourhood of  her bonnet; she no longer gave a little cry of delight when the big drags came  slowly along the crowded ranks, the steel bars shining as they swung loosely in  the low afternoon sunlight, the driver, conscious of his glory, grave and tranquil,  with the pride that apes humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Lotta,&rdquo; said Miss Paget, upon an especially  bright May evening, as one of these gorgeous equipages went past Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  landau, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s another drag. Did you see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you tired of four-in-hands? You used to  admire them so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admire them as much as ever, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you scarcely gave those four splendid  roans a glance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Charlotte answered, with a faint sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you tired, Lotta?&rdquo; Miss Paget asked, rather  anxiously. There was something in Charlotte&rsquo;s manner of late that had inspired  her with a vague sense of anxiety; some change which she could scarcely define  &mdash; a change so gradual that it was only by comparing the Charlotte of some  months ago with the Charlotte of the present that she perceived how real a  change it was. The buoyancy and freshness, the girlish vivacity of Miss  Halliday&rsquo;s manner, were rapidly giving place to habitual listlessness. &ldquo;Are you  tired, dear?&rdquo; she repeated, anxiously; and Mrs. Sheldon looked round from her  contemplation of the bonnets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Di, dearest, not tired; but &mdash; I don&rsquo;t feel  very well this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the first confession which Charlotte  Halliday made of a sense of weakness and languor that had been creeping upon her  during the last two months, so slowly, so gradually, that the change seemed too  insignificant for notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feel ill, Lotta dear?&rdquo; Diana asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, not exactly ill. I can scarcely call it  illness; I feel rather weak &mdash; that is really all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Mrs. Sheldon chimed in, with her eyes  on a passing bonnet as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, you are so dreadfully neglectful of your  papa&rsquo;s advice, Lotta,&rdquo; she said, in a complaining tone. &ldquo;Do <em>you</em> like pink roses with mauve  areophane, Diana? I do not. Look at that primrose tulle, with dead ivy-leaves  and scarlet berries, in the barouche. I dare say you have not taken your glass  of old port this morning, Charlotte, and have only yourself to thank if you  feel weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did take a glass of port this morning, mamma. I  don&rsquo;t like it; but I take it every morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like old tawny port, that your papa bought  at the sale of a bishop of somewhere? It&rsquo;s perfectly absurd of you, Lotta, to  talk of not liking wine that cost fifteen shillings a bottle, and which your  papa&rsquo;s friends declare to be worth five-and-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry it is so expensive, mamma; but I can&rsquo;t  teach myself to think it nice,&rdquo; answered Charlotte, with a smile that sadly  lacked the brightness of a few weeks ago. &ldquo;I think one requires to go into the  City, and become a merchant or a stockbroker, before one can like that sort of  wine. What was it Valentine quoted in the <em>Cheapside</em>,  about some lady whom somebody loved?&mdash;&lsquo;To love her was a liberal education.&rsquo; I  think to like old port is a commercial education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure such wine <em>ought</em> to do you good,&rdquo; said Georgy, almost querulously. She thought  this bright blooming creature had no right to be ill. The headaches, and little  weaknesses and languors and ladylike ailments, were things for which she (Georgy)  had taken out a patent; and this indisposition of her daughter&rsquo;s was an  infringement of copyright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say the port will do me good, mamma, in  time. No doubt I shall be as strong as that person who strangled lions and  snakes and dogs with incalculable heads, and all that kind of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really wish you would not talk in that absurd  manner, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheldon with offended dignity. &ldquo;I think you really  cannot be too grateful for your papa&rsquo;s kind thoughtfulness and anxiety about  you. I am sure I myself am not so anxious as he is; but of course his medical  knowledge makes him doubly careful. Six weeks ago he noticed that you wanted  strength &mdash; tone is what he calls it. &lsquo;Georgina,&rsquo; he said to me, &lsquo;Charlotte  wants tone. She is beginning to stoop in a really lamentable manner: we must  make her take port or bark, or something of a strengthening kind.&rsquo; And then a  day or two afterwards he decided on port, and gave me the key of the cellar &mdash;  which is a thing he rarely gives out of his own hands &mdash; and told me the number  of the bin from which I was to take the wine &mdash; some old wine that he had laid  by on purpose for some special occasion; and no one is to have it but you, and  you are to take a glass daily at eleven o&rsquo;clock. Mr. Sheldon is most particular  about the hour. The regularity of the thing is half the battle in these cases,  he says; and I am sure if you do not observe his wishes and mine, Charlotte, it  will be really ungrateful of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear mamma, I do observe Mr. &mdash; papa&rsquo;s wishes.  I take my glass of port every morning at eleven. I go to your cupboard in the  breakfast-room and take out my special decanter, and my special glass, in the  most punctiliously precise manner. I don&rsquo;t like the wine, and I don&rsquo;t like the  trouble involved in the ceremony of drinking it; but I go through it most  religiously, to please you and papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you mean to say that you do not feel  stronger after taking that expensive old port regularly for nearly six weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say that I do not, mamma. I think if  there is any change, it is that I am weaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sheldon captiously,  &ldquo;you are really a most extraordinary girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheldon could almost have found it in her  heart to say, a most ungrateful girl. There did seem a kind of ingratitude in  this futile consumption of old port at fifteen shillings a bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Lotta,&rdquo; she said  presently, &ldquo;I am convinced that your illness &mdash; or your weakness &mdash; is all  fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so, mamma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, if it were real weakness, that old port  must have made you stronger. And the fact that the port does you no good, is a  proof that your weakness is only fancy. Girls of your age are so full of  fancies. Look at me, and the martyrdom I go through with my nervous headaches,  which perfectly prostrate me, after the least worry or excitement. The nerves  of my head, after going into the butcher&rsquo;s book, are perfect agony. When you  come to have a house to look after, and find what it is to have the same saddle  of mutton charged for twice over, with the most daring impudence &mdash; or to have  capers and currie-powder, that you <em>know</em> you&rsquo;ve never had, staring at you from every page of your grocer&rsquo;s book, and  nothing but your memory between you and utter ruin &mdash; you&rsquo;ll discover what it is  to be really ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this easy manner did Mrs. Sheldon dismiss the  subject of her daughter&rsquo;s illness. But it was not so easily dismissed by Diana  Paget, who loved her friend with a profound and pure affection, than which no  sister&rsquo;s love was ever warmer or stronger. Even Valentine&rsquo;s preference for this  happy rival had not lessened Diana&rsquo;s love for her friend and benefactress. She  had been jealous of Charlotte&rsquo;s happier fate: but in the hour when this  jealousy was most bitter there had been no wavering in her attachment to this  one true and generous friend.</p>
<p>Miss Paget was very silent during the homeward  drive. She understood now what that change had been in her friend which until  now had so perplexed her. It was a decay of physical strength which had robbed  Lotta&rsquo;s smile of its brightness, her laugh of its merry music. It was physical  languor that made her so indifferent to the things which had once awakened her  girlish enthusiasm. The discovery was a very painful one. Diana remembered her  experience of Hyde Lodge: the girls who had grown day by day more listless, now  in the doctor&rsquo;s hands for a day or two, now well again and toiling at the old  treadmill round of study, now sinking into confirmed invalids; until the bitter  hour in which parents are summoned, and the doctor urges rest, and the fond  mother carries her darling home, assured that home comfort and tenderness will,  speedily restore her. Her schoolfellows cluster round the carriage to bid her  &ldquo;good-bye until next half,&rdquo; full of hopeful talk about her swift recovery. But  when the vacation is over, and Black Monday comes, she is not amongst the  returning scholars. Has she not gone up to the higher school, and answered <em>Adsum</em> to the call of the Great Master?</p>
<p>Diana remembered these old experiences with cruel  pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls, as bright and lovable as she is, have  drooped and faded away, just when they seem brightest and happiest,&rdquo; she  thought as she watched Charlotte, and perceived to-day for the first time that  the outline of her fair young cheek had lost its perfect roundness.</p>
<p>But in such a case love can do nothing except watch  and wait. That night, in the course of that girlish talk in Charlotte&rsquo;s  bedroom, which had become a habit with the two girls, Diana extorted from her  friend a full account of the symptoms which had affected her within the last  few weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t look so anxious, dear Di,&rdquo; she said  gaily; &ldquo;it is really nothing worth talking of; and I knew that if I confessed  to feeling ill you and mamma would straightway begin to worry yourselves about  me. I have felt a little sick and faint sometimes; and now and then a sudden  dizziness has come over me. It is nothing of any consequence, and it passes  away very quickly. Sometimes I have a kind of torpid languid feeling, which is  scarcely unpleasant, only strange, you know. But what does it all amount to,  except that I am nervous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have change of air, Lotta,&rdquo; said Diana  resolutely, &ldquo;and change of scene. Yes, no doubt you are nervous. You have been  kept almost a prisoner in the house through Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s punctilious nonsense.  You miss our brisk morning walks in the Gardens, I dare say. If you were to go  to Yorkshire, now, to your friends at Newhall, you would like that change,  dear, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should dearly like to see Aunt Dorothy and  uncle Joe; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should scarcely like being at Newhall, unless &mdash;  you&rsquo;ll think me very foolish, Di &mdash; unless Valentine was with me. We were so  happy there, you see, dear; and it was there he first told me he loved me. No,  Di, I couldn&rsquo;t bear Newhall without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Aunt Dorothy, poor uncle Joe! feathers when  weighed in the scale against a young man whom their niece has known less than a  twelvemonth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more was said about Charlotte&rsquo;s illness; Diana  was too prudent to alarm her friend by any expression of uneasiness. She  adopted a cheering tone, and the conversation drifted into other channels.</p>
<p>While Diana&rsquo;s concern for her friend&rsquo;s altered  health was yet a new feeling, she found herself called upon to attend her  father once more in the character of a ministering angel. And this time Captain  Paget&rsquo;s illness was something more than gout. It was, according to his doctors  &mdash; he had on this occasion two medical attendants &mdash; a general breaking up of the  system. The poor old wanderer, &mdash; the weary Odysseus, hero of so many  trickeries, such varied adventures, &mdash; laid himself down to rest, within view of  the Promised Land for which his soul yearned.</p>
<p>He was very ill. Gustave Lenoble, who came back to  London, did not conceal from Diana that the illness threatened to end fatally.  At his instigation the Captain had been removed from Omega Street to pleasant  lodgings at the back of Knightsbridge Road, overlooking Hyde Park. This was  nearer Bayswater, and it was very pleasant for the fading old worldling. He could  see the stream of fashion flowing past as he sat in his easy-chair, propped up  with pillows, with the western sunlight on his face. He pointed out the  liveries and armorial bearings; and told many scandalous and entertaining  anecdotes of their past and present owners to Gustave Lenoble, who devoted much  of his time to the solacement of the invalid. Everything that affection could  do to smooth this dreary time was done for the tired Ulysses. Pleasant books  were read to him; earnest thoughts were suggested by earnest words; hothouse  flowers adorned his cheerful sitting-room; hothouse fruits gladdened his eye by  their rich warmth of colour, and invited his parched lips to taste their cool  ripeness. Gustave had a piano brought in, so that Diana might sing to her  father in the dusky May evenings, when it should please him to hear her. Upon  the last feeble footsteps of this old man, whose life had been very selfish and  wicked, pity waited with a carefulness so fond and tender that he might well  mistake it for love. Was it fair that his last days should be so peaceful and  luxurious, when many a good man falls down to die in the streets, worn out with  the life-long effort to bear the burden laid upon his weary shoulders? In the  traditions of the Rabbins it is written that those are the elect of God who  suffer His chastisement in the flesh. For the others, for those who on earth  drain the goblet of pleasure, and riot in the raptures of sin, for them comes  the dread retribution after death. They are plunged in the fire, and driven  before the wind; they take the shape of loathsome reptiles, and ascend by  infinitesimal degrees through all the grades of creation, until their  storm-tossed wearied degraded souls re-enter human semblance once more. But even  then their old stand-point is not yet regained; their dread penance not yet  performed. As men they are the lowest and worst of men; slaves toiling in the  desert; dirt to be trampled under the feet of their prosperous brethren. Inch  by inch the wretched soul regains its lost inheritance; cycles must elapse  before the awful sentence is fulfilled.</p>
<p>Our Christian faith knows no such horrors. Even for  the penitent of the eleventh hour there is promise of pardon. The most earnest  desire of Diana&rsquo;s heart was that her father should enroll himself amongst those  late penitents &mdash; those last among the last who crowd in to the marriage feast,  half afraid to show their shame-darkened faces in that glorious company.</p>
<p>If we forgive all things to old age, so much the  more surely do we forgive all injuries to the fading enemy. That she had  suffered much cruelty and neglect at the hands of her father, was a fact that  Diana could not forget, any more than she could forget the name which he had  given her. It was a part of her life not to be put off or done away with. But  in these last days, with all her heart she forgave and pitied him. She pitied  him for the crooked paths into which his feet had wandered at the very outset  of life, and from which so weak a soul could find no issue. She pitied him for that  moral blindness which had kept him pleasantly unconscious of the supreme depth  of his degradation &mdash; a social Laplander, who never having seen a western  summer, had no knowledge that his own land was dark and benighted.</p>
<p>Happily for Diana and her generous lover, the  Captain was not a difficult penitent. He was indeed a man who, having lost the  capacity and the need for sin, took very kindly to penitence, as a species of  sentimental luxury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; he said complacently &mdash; for even in  the hour of his penitence he insisted on regarding himself as a social  martyr&mdash; &ldquo;my life has been a very hard one. Fortune has not been kind to me. In  the words of the immortal bard, my lines have <em>not</em> been set in pleasant places. I should have been glad if  Providence had allowed me to be a better father to you, a better husband to  your poor mother &mdash; a better Christian, in fact &mdash; and had spared me the repeated  humiliation of going through the Insolvent Debtors&rsquo; Court. It is not always  easy to understand the justice of these things: and it has often appeared to me  that something of the favouritism which is the bane of our governments on earth  must needs obtain at a higher tribunal. One man enters life with an entailed  estate worth seventy thousand a-year, while another finds himself in the hands  of the Jews before he is twenty years of age. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s something in this world  amiss shall be unriddled by-and-by,&rsquo; as the poet observes. The circumstances of  my own existence I have ever regarded as dark and enigmatic. And, indeed, the  events of this life are altogether inexplicable, my love. There is that fellow  Sheldon, now, who began life as a country dentist, a man without family or  connections, who &mdash; well, I will not repine. If I am spared to behold my  daughter mistress of a fine estate, although in a foreign country, I can depart  in peace. But you must have a house in town, my dear. Yes, London must be your  head-quarters. You must not be buried alive in Normandy. There is no place like  London. Take the word of a man who has seen the finest Continental cities, and  lived in them &mdash; that is the point, my love &mdash; lived in them. For a fine  afternoon in the beginning of May, an apartment in the Champs Elys&eacute;es, or the  Boulevard, is an earthly paradise; but the Champs Elys&eacute;es in a wet December &mdash;  the Boulevard in a sweltering August! London is the only spot upon earth that  is never intolerable. And your husband will be a rich man, my dear girl, a  really wealthy man; and you must see that he makes a fitting use of his wealth,  and does his duty to society. The parable of the Talents, which you were  reading to me this afternoon, is a moral lesson your husband must not forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this fashion did the invalid discourse.  Gustave and Diana perceived that he still hoped to have his share in their future  life, still looked to pleasant days to come in a world which he had loved, not  wisely, but too well. Nor could they find it in their hearts to tell him that  his journey was drawing to a close, and that on the very threshold of the  peaceful home which his diplomatic arts had helped to secure, he was to abandon  life&rsquo;s weary race.</p>
<p>They indulged his hopes a little, in order to win  him the more easily to serious thoughts; but though at times quite ready to  abandon himself to a penitential mood that was almost maudlin, there were other  times when the old Adam asserted himself, and the Captain resented this  intrusion of serious subjects as a kind of impertinence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not aware that I am at my last gasp, Diana,&rdquo;  he said with dignity, on one of these occasions; &ldquo;or that I need to be talked  to by my own daughter as if I were on my deathbed. I can show you men some  years my senior driving their ph&aelig;tons-and-pairs in that Park. The Gospel is all  very well in its place &mdash; during Sunday-morning service, and after morning  prayers, in your good old county families, where the household is large enough  to make a fair show at the end of the dining-room, without bringing in hulking  lads who smell of the stables: but I consider that when a man is ill, there is  a considerable want of tact in bringing the subject of religion before him in  any obtrusive manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus the Captain alternated from sentimental  penitence to captious worldliness, during many days and weeks. The business of  the Haygarthian inheritance was progressing slowly, but surely. Documents were  being prepared, attested copies of certificates of marriages, births, baptisms,  and burials were being procured, and all was tending towards the grand result.  Once, and sometimes twice a week, M. Fleurus came to see Captain Paget, and  discussed the great affair with that invalid diplomatist. The Captain had long  ago been aware that in entering upon an alliance with that gentleman, he had  invoked the aid of a coadjutor likely to prove too strong for him. The event  had justified his fears. M. Fleurus had something of Victor Hugo&rsquo;s famous <em>Poulpe</em> in his nature. Powerful as  flexible were the arms he stretched forth to grasp all prizes in the way of  heirs-at-law and disputed heritages, unclaimed railway-stock, and forgotten  consols. If the Captain had not played his cards very cleverly, and contrived  to obtain a personal influence over Gustave Lenoble, he might have found  himself thrust entirely out of the business by one of the Frenchman&rsquo;s  gelatinous arms. Happily for his own success, however, the Captain did obtain a  strong hold upon Gustave. This enabled him to protect his own interests  throughout the negotiation, and to keep the insidious Fleurus at bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; he said, in his grand  Carlton-House manner, &ldquo;I am bound to protect the interests of my friend M.  Lenoble, in any agreement to be entered upon in this matter. I cannot permit M.  Lenoble&rsquo;s generosity or M. Lenoble&rsquo;s inexperience to be imposed upon. My own  interests are of secondary importance. That I expect to profit by the  extraordinary discovery made by me &mdash; by ME &mdash; alone and unaided, I do not affect  to deny. But I will not profit at the expense of a too generous friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what recompense am I to have for my work &mdash; a  work at once painful and impoverishing?&rdquo; asked the little Frenchman, with an  angry and suspicious look. &ldquo;Do you believe that I do that to amuse me? To run  the streets, to go by here, by there, in hunting the papers of that marriage,  or this baptism? Believe you that is so agreeable, Monsieur the Captain? No; I  desire to be paid for my work. I must have my part in the heritage which I have  help to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not won yet. We will talk of your recompense  by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will talk of it this instant &mdash; upon the field.  It must that I comprehend where I am in this affair. I will not of  mystifications, of prevarications, of lies&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. Fleurus!&rdquo; cried the Captain, with a hand  stretched towards the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will sound &mdash; you will chase me! Ah, but no! &mdash;  you cannot afford to chase me yet. I have to find more papers of baptisms and  burials. Go, then, we will talk of this affair as friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This friendly talk ended in Captain Paget&rsquo;s  complete victory. M. Fleurus consented to accept his costs out of pocket in the  present, and three per cent, of the heritage in the future. It was further  agreed that the Captain should select the English attorney who should conduct  M. Lenoble&rsquo;s case in the Court of Chancery.</p>
<p>This conversation occurred at Rouen, and a day or  two afterwards the necessary document was drawn up. Gustave pledged himself to  pay over a fourth share of the Haygarthian fortune to Horatio Paget, and three  per cent, upon the whole amount to Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Fleurus. The document was very  formal, very complete; but whether such an agreement would hold water, if Gustave  Lenoble should choose to contest it, was open to question.</p>
<p>The solicitor to whom Horatio Paget introduced M.  Lenoble was a Mr. Dashwood, of the firm of Dashwood and Vernon; a man whom the  Captain had known in the past, and from whom he had received good service in  some of the most difficult crises of his difficult career. To this gentleman he  confided the conduct of the case; and explained his apprehensions with regard  to the two Sheldons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, as the case now stands, they think they  have the claimant to this money in Miss Halliday &mdash; Sheldon&rsquo;s stepdaughter. But  if they got an inkling of Susan Meynell&rsquo;s marriage &mdash; and, in point of fact &mdash;  the actual state of the case &mdash; they might try to get hold of my friend, Gustave  Lenoble. They could <em>not</em> get hold of  him, mind you, Dashwood, but they would try it on, and I don&rsquo;t want trying on  of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I know Sheldon, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn. He  is rather &mdash; well, say <em>shady</em>. That&rsquo;s  hardly an actionable epithet, and it expresses what I mean. Your friend&rsquo;s case  seems to me tolerably clear. That little Frenchman is useful, but officious. It  is not a speculative affair, I suppose? There is money to meet the current  expenses of the business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is money. Within reasonable limits my  friend is prepared to pay for the advancement of his claims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this the Haygarthian business progressed,  slowly, quietly. The work was up to this point underground work. There were  still papers wanting &mdash; final links of the chain to be fitted together; and to  the fitting of these links Messrs. Dashwood and Vernon devoted themselves, in  conjunction with M. Fleurus.</p>
<p>This was how matters stood when Captain Paget  drooped and languished, and was fain to abandon all active share in the  struggle.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
  Fading</h2>
<p>While the invalid in the pleasant lodgings  overlooking Hyde Park grew day by day weaker, there was a change as marked in  the bright young creature whose loving spirit had first brought the influence  of affection to bear upon Diana Paget&rsquo;s character. Charlotte Halliday was ill &mdash;  very ill. It was with everyday increasing anxiety that Diana watched the slow  change &mdash; slow in its progress, but awfully rapid to look back upon. The pain,  the regret, with which she noted her father&rsquo;s decay were little indeed compared  with the sharp agony which rent her heart as she perceived the alteration in  this dear friend, the blighting of this fair young flower.</p>
<p>That the withered leaves of autumn should fall is  sad, but natural, and we submit to the gloomy inevitable fact of decay and death.  But to see our rose of roses, the pride and glory of the garden, fade and  perish in its midsummer prime, is a calamity inexplicable and mysterious. Diana  watched her father&rsquo;s decline with a sense of natural sorrow and pity; but there  was neither surprise nor horror in the thought that for him the end of all  things was drawing nigh. How different was it with Charlotte &mdash; with that happy  soul for whom life and love wore their brightest smile, before whose light  joyous footsteps stretched so fair a pathway!</p>
<p>The illness, whatever it was &mdash; and neither Mr.  Sheldon nor the portly and venerable physician whom he called in could find a  name for it &mdash; crept upon the patient with stealthy and insidious steps.  Dizziness, trembling, faintness; trembling, faintness, dizziness; the symptoms  alternated day by day. Sometimes there was a respite of a few days; and  Charlotte &mdash; the youthful, the sanguine, the happy &mdash; declared that her enemy had  left her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure mamma is right, Di,&rdquo; she said on these  occasions. &ldquo;My nerves are the beginning and end of the mischief; and if I could  get the better of my nerves, I should be as well as ever. I don&rsquo;t wonder that  the idea of my symptoms makes mamma almost cross. You see, she has been  accustomed to have the symptoms all to herself; and for me to plagiarise them,  as it were, must seem quite an impertinence. For a strong young thing like me,  you know, Di dear &mdash; who have only just broken myself of plunging downstairs two  and three steps at a time, and plunging upstairs in the same vulgar manner &mdash; to  intrude on mamma&rsquo;s shattered nerves, and pirate mamma&rsquo;s low spirits, is utterly  absurd and abominable; so I have resolved to look my nerves straight in the  face, and get the better of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, you will get the better of them if you  try,&rdquo; said Diana, who did at times beguile herself with the hope that her  friend&rsquo;s ailments were mental rather than bodily. &ldquo;I dare say your monotonous  life has something to do with your altered health; you want change of scene,  dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Change of scene, when I have you and Valentine!  No, Di. It would certainly be very nice to have the background shifted now and  then; to see Capability Brown&rsquo;s prim gardens melt into Alpine heights or  southern vineyards, or even into Russian steppes or Hungarian forests. One does  get a little tired of <em>toujours</em> Bayswater; and Mr. Sheldon; and crimped skate; and sirloin of beef, and the  inevitable discussion as to whether it is in a cannibal state of rawness or  burnt to a cinder; and the glasses of pale sherry; and the red worsted doyleys  and blue finger-glasses; and the almonds and raisins, and crisp biscuits, that  nobody ever eats; and the dreary, dreary funereal business of dinner, when we  all talk vapid nonsense, with an ever-present consciousness of the parlourmaid.  I am tired of the dull dinners, and of mamma&rsquo;s peevish complaints about Ann  Woolper&rsquo;s ascendancy downstairs; and of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s perpetual newspapers,  that crackle, crackle, crackle all the evening through; and <em>such</em> papers! &mdash; <em>Money Market Monitor, Stockholder&rsquo;s Vade-Mecum</em>, and all sorts of  dreadful things of that kind, with not so much as an interesting advertisement  in one of them. I used never to feel these things an annoyance, you know, dear,  till I made the acquaintance of my nerves; but from the moment I allowed my  nerves to get the better of me, all these trifles have worried and excruciated  me. But I am happy with you, darling; and I am happy with Valentine. Poor  Valentine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pronounced his name with a sigh; and then,  after a pause, repeated mournfully, &ldquo;Poor Valentine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you speak of him so sadly, dear?&rdquo; asked  Diana, very pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because &mdash; because we have planned such a happy  life together, dear, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a thing to be sad about, darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &mdash; if it should happen, after all, that we have  to part, and he go on alone, the world may seem so sad and lonely to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte!&rdquo; cried Diana, with a laugh that was  almost choked by a sob, &ldquo;is this looking your nerves in the face? Why, my dear  one, this is indeed plagiarism of your mamma&rsquo;s low spirits. Lotta, you shall  have change of air; yes, I am determined on that. The stately physician who  came in his carriage the other day, and who looked at your tongue, and said  &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; and then felt your pulse and said &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; again, and then called for  pen-and-ink and wrote a little prescription, is not the doctor we want for you.  We want Dr. Yorkshire; we want the breezes from the Yorkshire moors, and the  smell of the farmyard, and our dear Aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s sillabubs, and our uncle Joe  to take us for long walks across his clover-fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to Newhall, Di. I couldn&rsquo;t bear  to leave &mdash; him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is to prevent your meeting <em>him</em> at the white gate this time, as you  met him last October? Might not accident take <em>him</em> to Huxter&rsquo;s Cross again? The arch&aelig;ological work &mdash; of which we  have heard no more, by the bye &mdash; might necessitate further investigations in  that district. If you will go to Newhall, Lotta, I will pledge myself for Mr.  Hawkehurst&rsquo;s speedy appearance at the white gate you have so often described to  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest Di, you are all kindness; but even if I  were inclined to go to Newhall, I doubt if mamma or Mr. Sheldon would like me  to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure they would be pleased with any  arrangement that was likely to benefit your health. But I will talk to your  mamma about it. I have set my heart on your going to Newhall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Paget lost no time in carrying out her idea.  She took possession of Georgy that afternoon, while teaching her a new stitch  in <em>tricot</em>, and succeeded in  impressing her with the conviction that change of air was necessary for  Charlotte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t think Lotta really ill?&rdquo; asked Mrs.  Sheldon, nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust she is not really ill, dear Mrs. Sheldon;  but I am sure she is much changed. In talking to her, I affect to think that her  illness is only an affair of the nerves; but I sadly fear that it is something  more than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is the matter with her?&rdquo; exclaimed  Georgy, with a piteous air of perplexity; &ldquo;that is the question which I am  always asking. People can&rsquo;t be ill, you know, Diana, without having something  the matter with them; and that is what I can&rsquo;t make out in Charlotte&rsquo;s case.  Mr. Sheldon says she wants tone; the physician who came in a carriage and pair,  and ought to know what he is talking about, says there is a lack of vigour. But  what does that all amount to? I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve wanted tone all my life. Perhaps  there never was a creature so devoid of tone as I am; and the internal sinking  I feel just before luncheon is something that no one but myself can realize. I  dare say Lotta is not so strong as she might be; but I do not see that she can  be ill, unless her illness is something definite. My poor first husband&rsquo;s  illness, now, was the kind of thing that any one could understand &mdash; bilious  fever. The merest child knows what it is to be bilious, and the merest child  knows what it is to be feverish. There can be nothing mysterious in bilious  fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear Mrs. Sheldon,&rdquo; said Diana, gravely,  &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think that the weakness of constitution which rendered Charlotte&rsquo;s  father liable to be taken off in the prime of life by a fever is a weakness  that Charlotte may possibly have inherited?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Diana!&rdquo; cried Georgy, with sudden  terror; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean to say that you think my Charlotte is going to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was but one step with Mrs. Sheldon from peevish  incredulity to frantic alarm; and Diana found it as difficult to tranquillise  her newly-awakened fears as it had been to rouse her from absolute apathy.</p>
<p>Change of air &mdash; yes, of course &mdash; Charlotte must  have change of air that instant. Let a cab be sent for immediately to take them  to the terminus. Change of air, of course. To Newhall &mdash; to Nice &mdash; to the Isle  of Wight &mdash; to Malta; Mrs. Sheldon had heard of people going to Malta. Where  should they go? Would Diana advise, and send for a cab, and pack a travelling  bag without an instant&rsquo;s delay? The rest of the things could be sent  afterwards. What did luggage matter, when Charlotte&rsquo;s life was at stake?</p>
<p>At this point a flood of tears happily relieved  poor Georgy&rsquo;s excited feelings, and then common sense and Diana Paget came to  the rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Sheldon,&rdquo; she said, with a quiet  cheerful tone that went far to reassure the excited lady, &ldquo;in the first place  we must, above all things, refrain from any appearance of alarm. Her illness  may, after all, be only an affair of the nerves; and there is certainly no  cause for immediate fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Georgy was tranquillised, and agreed to take  matters quietly. She promised to arrange Charlotte&rsquo;s departure for Newhall,  with Mr. Sheldon, that evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you know, my dear, I like to consult  him about everything,&rdquo; she said, apologetically. &ldquo;It is a duty which one owes  one&rsquo;s husband, you know, and a duty which, as a young woman about to marry, I  cannot too much impress upon you; but in this case it is quite a matter of  form: Mr. Sheldon never has objected to Charlotte&rsquo;s going to Newhall, and he is  not likely to object now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The event proved Mrs. Sheldon mistaken as to this  matter. Georgy proposed the visit to Newhall that evening, while the two girls  were strolling listlessly in the dusky garden, and Mr. Sheldon most decidedly  rejected the proposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she wants change of air &mdash; and Dr. Doddleson  recommended nothing of the kind &mdash; Newhall is not the place for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too cold. Northerly aspect &mdash; no shelter &mdash;  three hundred feet above
  York minster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dorothy Mercer is such a kind motherly  creature; she&rsquo;d delight in nursing Lotta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Sheldon, with a laugh, &ldquo;and in  quacking her. I know what those good motherly creatures are when they get an  excuse for dosing some unhappy victim with their quack nostrums. If Charlotte  went to Newhall, Mrs. Mercer would poi &mdash; would make her ten times worse than  she is with old woman&rsquo;s remedies. Besides, as I said before, the place is too  cold. That is a conclusive argument, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this with some impatience of tone and  manner. There was a haggard look in his face, a hurried harassed manner  pervading him this evening, which had been growing upon him of late. Georgy was  too slow of perception to remark this; but Diana Paget had remarked it, and had  attributed the change in the stockbroker&rsquo;s manner to a blending of two  anxieties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is anxious about money matters,&rdquo; she had said  to herself, &ldquo;and he is anxious about Charlotte&rsquo;s health. His lips, moving in  whispered calculations, as he sits brooding by the fire, tell me of the first  anxiety; his eyes, wandering furtively to his step-daughter&rsquo;s face every now  and then, tell me of the second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This furtive anxiety of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s increased  Diana Paget&rsquo;s anxiety. This man, who had a certain amount of medical knowledge,  could no doubt read the diagnostics of that strange insidious illness, which  had, as yet, no name. Diana, furtively watching his furtive looks, told herself  that he read of danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Charlotte wants change of air, let her go to  Hastings,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that is the kind of place for an invalid. I want rest  myself; and there&rsquo;s such utter stagnation in the City nowadays that I can very  well afford to give myself a holiday. We&rsquo;ll run down to Hastings, or the  immediate neighbourhood of Hastings, for a week or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Philip, how kind and considerate you are! I am  sure, as I was observing to Miss Paget only today, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, by the bye, there&rsquo;s Miss Paget. Is it  absolutely necessary that Miss
  Paget should go to Hastings with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, you see she has so kindly desired to  remain with me for the quarter, so as to give me time to turn round, you know,  with regard to caps and summer things, and so on &mdash; for, really, she has such  taste, and does strike out such excellent ideas about turning, and dipping, and  dyeing, that I don&rsquo;t know what will become of me when she leaves us; and it  would look so pointed to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she had better go with us. But why all this  fuss about Charlotte? &ldquo;Who put it into your head that she wants change of air?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon evidently considered it an established  fact that any idea in his wife&rsquo;s head must needs have been put there by someone  or other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, Diana and I were talking of Lotta  this afternoon, and
  Diana quite alarmed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sheldon, with a quick frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she said it was evident, by the fact of poor  dear Tom&rsquo;s dying of a fever, that his constitution must have been originally  weak. And she said that perhaps Charlotte had inherited Tom&rsquo;s weak constitution  &mdash; and frightened me dreadfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no occasion for you to be frightened;  Charlotte will get on very well, I dare say, with care. But Miss Paget is a  very sensible young woman, and is right in what she says. Charlotte&rsquo;s  constitution is not strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Philip!&rdquo; said Georgy, in a faint wailing voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say she will live to follow you and me to  our graves,&rdquo; said Mr.
  Sheldon, with a hard laugh. &ldquo;Ah, here she is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she was, coming towards the open window near  which her stepfather sat. Here she was, pale and tired, with her sauntering  walk, dressed in white, and spectral in the gloaming. To the sad eyes of her  mother she looked like a ghost. To the eyes of Philip Sheldon, a man not prone  to poetic fancies, she looked even more ghostlike.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
  Mrs. Woolper Is Anxious</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of her illness, Charlotte  Halliday had been the object and subject of many anxious thoughts in the minds  of several people. That her stepfather had his anxieties about her &mdash; anxieties  which he tried to hide &mdash; was obvious to the one person in the Bayswater villa  who noted his looks, and tried to read the thoughts they indicated.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s alarm, once fairly awakened, was not  to be lulled to rest. And in Valentine Hawkehurst&rsquo;s heart there was an aching  pain &mdash; a dull dead load of care, which had never been lightened from the hour  when he first perceived the change in his dear one&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>There was one other person, an inhabitant of the  Bayswater villa, who watched Charlotte Halliday at this time with a care as  unresting as the care of mother or stepfather, bosom friend or plighted lover.  This person was Ann Woolper. Mrs. Woolper had come to the villa prepared to  find in Miss Halliday a frivolous self-satisfied young person, between whom and  an old broken-down woman like herself there could be no sympathy. She had  expected to be contemptuously &mdash; or, at the best, indifferently &mdash; entreated by  the prosperous well-placed young lady, whom Mr. Sheldon had spoken of as a good  girl, as girls go; a vague species of commendation, which, to the mind of Mrs.  Woolper, promised very little.</p>
<p>As clearly as Philip Sheldon dared express his  wishes with regard to Charlotte Halliday, he had expressed them to Ann Woolper.  What he would fain have said, was, &ldquo;Watch my stepdaughter, and keep me well  acquainted with every step she takes.&rdquo; Thus much he dared not say; but by  insinuating that Tom Halliday&rsquo;s daughter was frivolous and reckless, and that  her lover was not to be trusted, he had contrived to put Mrs. Woolper on the <em>qui vive</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Philip&rsquo;s afraid she may go and marry this  young man on the sly, before he&rsquo;s got the means to support a wife,&rdquo; she said to  herself, as she meditated upon the meaning of her master&rsquo;s injunctions; &ldquo;and  well he may be. There&rsquo;s no knowing what young women are up to nowadays; and the  more innocent and inexperienced a young woman is, the more she wants looking  after. And Miss Georgy Craddock always was a poor fondy, up to naught but  dressing herself fine, and streaming up and down Barlingford High Street with  her old schoolfellows. Such as she ain&rsquo;t fit to be trusted with a daughter; and  Mr. Philip knows that. He always was a deep one. But I&rsquo;m glad he looks after  Missy: there&rsquo;s many men, having got fast hold of th&rsquo; father&rsquo;s brass, would let  th&rsquo; daughter marry Old Scratch, for the sake of gettin&rsquo; rid of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is how Mrs. Woolper argued the matter. She  came of a prudent race; and anything like prudence seemed to her a commendable  virtue. She wished to think well of her master; for her he had been a  Providence in the hour of calamity and old age. Where else could she look, if  not to him? And to suspect him, or think ill of him, was to reject the one  refuge offered to her distress. A magnanimous independence of spirit is not an  easy virtue for the old and friendless and poor. The drowning wretch will  scarcely question the soundness of the plank that sustains him upon the  storm-tossed billows; nor was Mrs. Woolper inclined to question the motives of  the man to whom she now owed her daily bread.</p>
<p>It is possible that before invoking Mrs. Woolper  from the ashes of the past to take her seat by the hearthstone of the present,  Mr. Sheldon may have contemplated the question of her return in all its  bearings, and may have assured himself that she was his own, by a tie not  easily broken &mdash; his bond-slave, fettered hand and foot by the bondage of  necessity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What choice can she have, except the choice  between my house and the workhouse?&rdquo; he may naturally have asked himself; &ldquo;and  is it likely she will quarrel with her bread-and-butter in order to fall back  upon dry bread?&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon, contemplating this and all other questions from  his one unchanging standpoint, may reasonably have concluded that Mrs. Woolper  would do nothing opposed to her own interests; and that so long as it suited  her interest to remain at the Lawn, and to serve him, she would there remain,  his docile and unquestioning slave.</p>
<p>The influence of affection, the force of generous  impulse, were qualities that did not come into Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s calculations upon  this subject. His addition and subtraction, division and multiplication, were  all based on one system.</p>
<p>That happy and unconscious art by which Charlotte  Halliday made herself dear to all who knew her had a speedy effect upon the old  housekeeper. The girl&rsquo;s amiable consideration for her age and infirmities; the  pretty affectionate familiarity with which she treated this countrywoman, who  had known her father, and who could talk to her of Yorkshire and Yorkshire  people, soon made their way to Nancy Woolper&rsquo;s heart of hearts. For Miss  Halliday to come to the housekeeper&rsquo;s room with some message from her mother,  and to linger for a few minutes&rsquo; chat, was a delight to Mrs. Woolper. She would  have detained the bright young visitant for hours instead of minutes, if she  could have found any excuse for so doing. Nor was there any treason against Mr.  Sheldon in her growing attachment to his stepdaughter. Whenever Nancy spoke of  that master and benefactor, she spoke with unfeigned gratitude and affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I nursed your step-papa as a baby, Miss Halliday,&rdquo;  she said very often on these occasions. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think, to look at him  now, that he ever was <em>that</em>, would  you? But he was one of the finest babies you could wish to see &mdash; tall, and  strong, and with eyes that pierced one through, they were so bright and big and  black. He was rather stubborn-spirited with his teething; but what baby isn&rsquo;t  trying at such times? I had rare work with him, I can tell you, Miss, walking  him about of nights, and jogging him till there wasn&rsquo;t a jog left in me, as you  may say, from sleepiness. I often wonder if he thinks of this now, when I see  him looking so grave and stern. But, you see, being jogged doesn&rsquo;t impress the  mind like having to jog; and though I can bring that time back as plain as if  it was yesterday, with the very nursery I slept in at Barlingford, and the  rushlight in a tall iron cage on the floor, and the shadow of the cage on the  bare whitewashed walls &mdash; it&rsquo;s clean gone out of his mind, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it has, Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, O, I was fond of him, Miss Halliday; and what  I went through with him about his teeth made me only the fonder of him. He was  the first baby I ever nursed, you see, and the last; for before Master George  came to town I&rsquo;d taken to the cooking, and Mrs. Sheldon hired another girl as  nurse; a regular softy <em>she</em> was, and  it isn&rsquo;t her fault that Master George has got anything christian-like in the  way of a back, for the way she carried that blessed child used to make my blood  run cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus would Mrs. Woolper discourse whenever she had  a fair excuse for detaining Miss Halliday in her comfortable apartment.  Charlotte did not perceive much interest in these reminiscences of Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s infancy, but she was much too kind to bring them abruptly to a close  by any show of impatience. When she could get Nancy to talk of Barlingford and  Hyley, and the people whom Charlotte herself had known as a child, the  conversation was really interesting; and these recollections formed a link  between the old woman and the fair young damsel.</p>
<p>When the change arose in Charlotte&rsquo;s health and  spirits, Mrs. Woolper was one of the first to perceive it. She was skilled in  those old woman&rsquo;s remedies which Mr. Sheldon held in such supreme contempt, and  she would fain have dosed the invalid with nauseous decoctions of hops, or  home-brewed quinine. Charlotte appreciated the kindness of the intent, but she  rebelled against the home-brewed medicines, and pinned her faith to the more  scientific and less obnoxious preparations procured from the chemist&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>For some time Nancy made light of the girl&rsquo;s  ailments, though she watched her with unfailing attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a-done growing yet, miss, I&rsquo;ll lay,&rdquo; she  said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m more than twenty-one, Nancy. People don&rsquo;t  grow after they&rsquo;re of age, do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known them as have, miss; I don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s  common, but it has been done. And then there&rsquo;s the weakness that comes after  you&rsquo;ve done growing. Girls of your age are apt to be faint and lollopy-like, as  you may say; especially when they&rsquo;re stived up in a smoky place like London.  You ought to go to Hyley, miss, where you was born; that&rsquo;s the place to set you  up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The time had come when the change was no longer  matter for doubt. Day by day Charlotte grew weaker and paler; day by day that  bright and joyous creature, whose presence had made an atmosphere of youth and  gladness even in that prim dwelling-place, receded farther into the dimness of  the past; until to think of what she had been seemed like recalling the image  of the dead. Nancy marked the alteration with a strange pain, so sharp, so  bitter, that its sharpness and bitterness were a perpetual perplexity to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the poor dear young thing is meant to go,  there&rsquo;s no need for me to fret about it all day long, and wake up sudden in the  night with cold water standing out upon my forehead at the thought of it. I  haven&rsquo;t known her six months; and if she is pretty and sweet-spoken, it&rsquo;s not  my place to give way at the thoughts of losing her. She&rsquo;s not my own flesh and  blood; and I&rsquo;ve sat by to watch them go, times and often, without feeling as I  do when I see the change in her day after day. Why should it seem so dreadful  to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why indeed? This was a question for which Mrs.  Woolper could find no answer. She knew that the pain and horror which she felt  were something more than natural, but beyond this point her thoughts refused to  travel. A superstitious feeling arose at this point, to usurp the office of  reason, and she accounted for the strangeness of Miss Halliday&rsquo;s illness as she  might have done had she lived in the sixteenth century, and been liable to the  suspicion of nocturnal careerings on broomsticks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Mr. Philip&rsquo;s house should be unlucky to  that sweet young creature,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;It was unlucky to the father;  and now it seems as if it was going to be unlucky to the daughter. And Mr.  Philip won&rsquo;t be any richer for her death. Mrs. Sheldon has told me times and  often that all Tom Halliday&rsquo;s money went to my master when she married him, and  he has doubled and trebled it by his cleverness. Miss Charlotte&rsquo;s death  wouldn&rsquo;t bring him a sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the gist of Mrs. Woolper&rsquo;s meditations  very often nowadays. But the strange sense of perplexity, the nameless fear,  the vague horror, were not to be banished from her mind. A sense of some  shapeless presence for ever at her side haunted her by day and night. What was  it? What did its presence portend? It was as if a figure, shrouded from head to  foot, was there, dark and terrible, at her elbow, and she would not turn to  meet the horror face to face. Sometimes the phantom hand lifted a corner of the  veil, and the shade said, &ldquo;Look at me! See who and what I am! You have seen me  before. I am here again! and this time you shall not refuse to meet me face to  face! I am the shadow of the horror you suspected in the past!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shadowy fears which oppressed Mrs. Woolper  during this period did not in any way lessen her practical usefulness. From the  commencement of Charlotte&rsquo;s slow decline she had shown herself attentive, and  even officious, in all matters relating to the invalid. With her own hands she  decanted the famous port which Georgy fetched from the particular bin in Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s carefully arranged cellar. When the physician was called in, and  wrote his harmless little prescription, it was Mrs. Woolper who carried the  document to the dispensing chemist, and brought back the innocent potion, which  might, peradventure, effect some slight good, and was too feeble a decoction to  do any harm. Charlotte duly appreciated all this kindness; but she repeatedly  assured the housekeeper that her ailments were not worthy of so much care.</p>
<p>It was Mrs. Woolper whom Mr. Sheldon employed to  get lodgings for the family, when it had been ultimately decided that a change  to the seaside was the best cure for Miss Halliday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am too busy to go to Hastings myself this week,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;but I shall be prepared to spend a fortnight there after next Monday.  What I want you to do, Nancy, is to slip down tomorrow, with a second-class  return-ticket, and look about for a nice place for us. I don&rsquo;t care about being  in Hastings; there&rsquo;s too much cockneyism in the place at this time of year.  There&rsquo;s a little village called Harold&rsquo;s Hill, within a mile or so of St. Leonard&rsquo;s  &mdash; a dull, out-of-the-way place, but rustic and picturesque, and all that kind  of thing &mdash; the sort of place that women like. Now, I&rsquo;d rather stay at that  place than at Hastings. So you can take a fly at the station, drive straight to  Harold&rsquo;s Hill, and secure the best lodgings you can get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think as the change of air will do Miss  Halliday good?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Woolper anxiously, after she had promised to do all  her kind master required of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I think it will do her good? Of course I do.  Sea-air and sea-bathing will set her up in no time; there&rsquo;s nothing particular  the matter with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Philip; that&rsquo;s what bothers me about the  whole thing. There&rsquo;s nothing particular the matter with her; and yet she pines  and dwindles, and dwindles and pines, till it makes one&rsquo;s heart ache to see  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s face darkened, and he threw  himself back in his chair with an impatient movement. If he had chosen to do  so, he could have prevented that darkening of his face; but he did not consider  Mrs. Woolper a person of sufficient importance to necessitate the regulation of  his countenance. What was she but an ignorant, obstinate old woman, who would  most probably perish in the streets if he chose to turn her out of doors? There  are men who consider their clerks and retainers such very dirt, that they would  continue the forging of a bill of exchange, or complete the final touches of a  murder, with a junior clerk putting coals on the fire, or an errand-boy  standing cap in hand on the threshold of the door. They cannot realize the fact  that dirt such as this is flesh and blood, and may denounce them by-and-by in a  witness-box.</p>
<p>Of all contingencies Mr. Sheldon least expected  that this old woman could prove troublesome to him &mdash; this abject wretch, whose  daily bread depended on his will. He could not imagine that there are  circumstances under which such abject creatures will renounce their daily  bread, and die of hunger, rather than accept the means of life from one hateful  hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to know anything about Miss Halliday&rsquo;s  illness,&rdquo; he said in his hardest voice, and with his hardest look, &ldquo;you had  better apply to Dr. Doddleson, the physician who has prescribed for her. I do  not attend her, you see, and I am in no way responsible for her health. When I  was attending her father you favoured me by doubting my skill, if I judged  rightly as to your tone and manner on one occasion. I don&rsquo;t want to be brought  to book by you, Mrs. Woolper, about Miss Halliday&rsquo;s altered looks or Miss  Halliday&rsquo;s illness; I have nothing to do with either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I think you had, sir? Don&rsquo;t be angry  with me, or hard upon me, Mr. Phil. I nursed you when you was but a baby, and  you&rsquo;re nearer and dearer to me than any other master could be. Why, I have but  to shut my eyes now, and I can feel your little hand upon my neck, as it used  to lie there, so soft and dear. And then I look down at the hand on the table,  strong and dark, and clenched so firm, and I ask myself, Can it be the same?  For the sake of that time, Mr. Phil, don&rsquo;t be hard upon me. There&rsquo;s nothing I  wouldn&rsquo;t do to serve you; there&rsquo;s nothing you could do that would turn me from  you. There&rsquo;s no man living in this world, sir, that oughtn&rsquo;t to be glad to know  of one person that nothing can turn from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very fine sentiment, my good soul,&rdquo;  replied Mr. Sheldon coolly; &ldquo;but, you see, it&rsquo;s only an <em>ex parte</em> statement; and as the case stands there is no opportunity  for the display of those fine feelings you talk about. You happen to want a  home in your old age, and I happen to be able to give you a home. Under such  circumstances, your own good sense will show you that all sentimental talk  about standing by me, and not turning away from me, is absolute bosh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman sighed heavily. She had offered her  master a fidelity which involved the abnegation of all impulses of her own  heart and mind, and he rejected her love and her service. And then, after the  first dreary sense of his coldness, she felt better pleased that it should be  so. The man who spoke to her in this harsh uncompromising way could have no  cause to fear her. In the mind of such a man there could surely be no secret  chamber within which she had, with his knowledge, almost penetrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t trouble you any more, sir,&rdquo; she said  mournfully. &ldquo;I dare say I&rsquo;m a foolish old woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are, Nancy. We don&rsquo;t get wiser as we grow  older, you see; and when we let our tongues wag, we&rsquo;re apt to talk nonsense.  The quieter you keep your tongue, the better for yourself, in more ways than  one. To a useful old woman about the place I&rsquo;ve no objection; but a chattering  old woman I will not have at any price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this everything was settled in the most  agreeable manner. Nancy Woolper&rsquo;s journey to Hastings was fully arranged; and  early the next morning she started, brisk and active, in spite of her  sixty-eight years of age. She returned at night, having secured very pleasant  lodgings at the village of Harold&rsquo;s Hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a very sweet place it is, my dear Miss Lotta,&rdquo;  she said to Charlotte the next day, when she described her adventures. &ldquo;The  apartments are at a farmhouse overlooking the sea; and the smell of the cows  under your windows, and the sea-breezes blowing across the farmyard, can&rsquo;t fail  to bring the colour back to your pretty cheeks, and the brightness back to your  pretty eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
  Valentine&rsquo;s Skeleton</h2>
<p>The idea of this visit to the Sussex village by the  sea seemed delightful to every one except Gustave Lenoble, who was still in  town, and who thought it a hard thing that he should be deprived of Diana&rsquo;s  society during an entire fortnight, for the sake of this sickly Miss Halliday.</p>
<p>For the rest, there was hope and gladness in the  thought of this change of dwelling. Charlotte languished for fresher breezes  and more rustic prospects than the breezes and prospects of Bayswater; Diana  looked to the sea-air as the doctor of doctors for her fading friend; and  Valentine cherished the same hope.</p>
<p>On Valentine Hawkehurst the burden of an  unlooked-for sorrow had weighed very heavily. To see this dear girl, who was  the beginning, middle, and end of all his hopes, slowly fading before his eyes,  was, of all agonies that could have fallen to his lot, the sharpest and most  bitter. Not Ugolino sitting silent amidst his famishing children &mdash; not Helen,  when she would fain that the tempest had swept her from earth&rsquo;s surface on that  evil day when she was born &mdash; not Penelope, when she cried on Diana, the  high-priestess of death, to release her from the weariness of her days &mdash; not  Agamemnon, when the fatal edict had gone forth, and his fair young daughter  looked into his face, and asked him if it was true that she was to die &mdash; not  one of these typical mourners could have suffered a keener torture than that  which rent this young man&rsquo;s heart, as he marked the stealthy steps of the  Destroyer drawing nearer and nearer the woman he loved. Of all possible  calamities, this was the last he had ever contemplated. Sometimes, in moments  of doubt or despondency, he had thought it possible that poverty, the advice of  friends, caprice or inconstancy on the part of Charlotte herself, should sever  them. But among the possible enemies to his happiness he had never counted  Death. What had Death to do with so fair and happy a creature as Charlotte  Halliday? she who, until some two months before this time, might have been the  divine Hygieia in person &mdash; so fresh was her youthful bloom, so buoyant her  step, so bright her glances. Valentine&rsquo;s hardest penance was the necessity for  the concealment of his anxiety. The idea that Charlotte&rsquo;s illness might be &mdash;  nay, must be &mdash; for the greater part an affair of the nerves was always  paramount in his mind. He and Diana had talked of the subject together whenever  they found an opportunity for so doing, and had comforted themselves with the  assurance that the nerves alone were to blame; and they were the more inclined  to think this from the conduct of Dr. Doddleson, on that physician&rsquo;s visits to  Miss Halliday. Mrs. Sheldon had been present on each occasion, and to Mrs.  Sheldon alone had the physician given utterance to his opinion of the case.  That opinion, though expressed with a certain amount of professional dignity,  amounted to very little. &ldquo;Our dear young friend wanted strength; and what we  had to do was to give our dear young friend strength &mdash; vital power. Yes &mdash; er &mdash;  um, that was the chief point. And what kind of diet might our dear young friend  take now? Was it a light diet, a little roast mutton &mdash; not too much done, but  not underdone? O dear, no. And a light pudding? what he would call &mdash; if he  might be permitted to have his little joke &mdash; a nursery pudding.&rdquo; And then the  old gentleman had indulged in a senile chuckle, and patted Charlotte&rsquo;s head  with his fat old fingers. &ldquo;And our dear young friend&rsquo;s room, now, was it a  large room? &mdash; good! and what was the aspect now, south? &mdash; good again! nothing  better, unless, perhaps, south-west; but, of course, everyone&rsquo;s rooms can&rsquo;t  look south-west. A little tonic draught, and gentle daily exercise in that nice  garden, will set our dear young friend right again. Our temperament is nervous  we are a sensitive plant, and want care.&rdquo; And then the respectable  septuagenarian took his fee, and shuffled off to his carriage. And this was all  that Mrs. Sheldon could tell Diana, or Nancy Woolper, both of whom questioned  her closely about her interview with the doctor. To Diana and to Valentine  there was hope to be gathered from the very vagueness of the physician&rsquo;s  opinion. If there had been anything serious the matter, the medical adviser  must needs have spoken more seriously. He came again and again. He found the  pulse a little weaker, the patient a little more nervous, with a slight  tendency to hysteria, and so on; but he still declared that there were no  traces of organic disease, and he still talked of Miss Halliday&rsquo;s ailments with  a cheery easy-going manner that was very reassuring.</p>
<p>In his moments of depression Valentine pinned his  faith upon Dr. Doddleson. Without organic disease, he told himself, his darling  could not perish. He looked for Dr. Doddleson&rsquo;s name in the Directory, and took  comfort from the fact of that physician&rsquo;s residence in a fashionable West End  square. He took further comfort from the splendour of the doctor&rsquo;s equipage, as  depicted to him by Mrs. Sheldon; and from the doctor&rsquo;s age and experience, as  copiously described by the same lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one fact that I have ever reproached  myself with in relation to my poor Tom,&rdquo; said Georgy, who, in talking to  strangers of her first husband, was apt to impress them with the idea that she  was talking of a favourite cat; &ldquo;and that is, the youthfulness of the doctor  Mr. Sheldon employed. Of course I am well aware that Mr. Sheldon would not have  consulted the young man if he had not thought him clever; but I could lay my  head upon my pillow at night with a clearer conscience if poor Tom&rsquo;s doctor had  been an older and more experienced person. Now, that&rsquo;s what I like about Dr.  Doddleson. There&rsquo;s a gravity &mdash; a weight &mdash; about a man of that age which  inspires one with immediate confidence. I&rsquo;m sure the serious manner with which  he questioned me about Lotta&rsquo;s diet, and the aspect of her room, was quite  delightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Dr. Doddleson, under Providence, Valentine was  fain to put his trust. He did not know that the worthy doctor was one of those  harmless inanities who, by the aid of money and powerful connections, are  sometimes forced into a position which nature never intended them to occupy.  Among the real working men of that great and admirable brotherhood, the medical  profession, Dr. Doddleson had no rank; but he was the pet physician of fashionable  dowagers suffering from chronic laziness or periodical attacks of ill-humour.  For the spleen or the vapours no one was a better adviser than Dr. Doddleson.  He could afford to waste half an hour upon the asking of questions which the  fair patient&rsquo;s maid might as well have asked, and the suggestions of remedies  which any intelligent abigail could as easily have suggested. Elderly ladies  believed in him because he was pompous and ponderous, lived in an expensive  neighbourhood, and drove a handsome equipage. He wore mourning-rings left him  by patients who never had anything particular the matter with them, and who,  dying of sheer old age, or sheer over-eating, declared with their final gasp  that Dr. Doddleson had been the guardian angel of their frail lives during the  last twenty years.</p>
<p>This was the man who, of all the medical profession  resident in London, Mr. Sheldon had selected as his stepdaughter&rsquo;s medical  adviser in a case so beyond common experience, that a man of wide practice and  keen perception was especially needed for its treatment.</p>
<p>Dr. Doddleson, accustomed to attribute the fancied  ailments of fashionable dowagers to want of tone, and accustomed to prescribe  the mildest preparations with satisfaction to his patients and profit to  himself dwelt upon the same want of tone, and prescribed the same harmless  remedies, in his treatment of Charlotte Halliday. When he found her no better &mdash;  nay, even worse &mdash; after some weeks of this treatment, he was puzzled; and for  one harmless remedy he substituted another harmless remedy, and waited another  week to see what effect the second harmless remedy might have on this somewhat  obstinate young person.</p>
<p>And this was the broken reed to which Valentine  clung in the day of his trouble.</p>
<p>Bitter were his days and sleepless were his nights  in this dark period of his existence. He went to the Bayswater villa nearly  every day now. It was no longer time for etiquette or ceremony. His darling was  fading day by day; and it was his right to watch the slow sad change, and, if it  were possible, to keep the enemy at arm&rsquo;s-length. Every day he came to spend  one too brief hour with his dear love; every day he greeted her with the same  fond smile, and beguiled her with the same hopeful talk. He brought her new  books and flowers, and any foolish trifle which he fancied might beguile her  thoughts from the contemplation of that mysterious malady which seemed beyond  the reach of science and Dr. Doddleson. He sat and talked with her of the  future &mdash; that future which in their secret thoughts both held to be a sweet sad  fable &mdash; the hyperborean garden of their dreams. And after spending this too  sweet, too bitter hour with his beloved, Mr. Hawkehurst would diplomatise in  order to have a little talk with Diana as he left the house. Did Diana think  his dear girl better to-day, or worse &mdash; surely not worse? He had fancied she  had more colour, more of her old gaiety of manner. She had seemed a little  feverish; but that might be the excitement of his visit. And so on, and so on,  with sad and dreary repetition.</p>
<p>And then, having gone away from that house with an  aching heart, the young magazine-writer went back to his lodgings, and plunged  into the dashing essay or the smart pleasant story which was to constitute his  monthly contribution to the <em>Cheapside</em> or the <em>Charing Cross</em>. Gaiety,  movement, rollicking, Harry Lorrequer-like spirits were demanded for the <em>Cheapside</em>; a graceful union of  brilliancy and depth was required for the <em>Charing  Cross</em>. And, O, be sure the critics lay in wait to catch the young scribbler  tripping! An anachronism here, a secondhand idea there, and the <em>West End Wasp</em> shrieked its war-whoop in  an occasional note; or the <em>Minerva</em> published a letter from a correspondent in the Scilly Islands, headed &ldquo;Another  Literary Jack Sheppard,&rdquo; to say that in his &ldquo;Imperial Dictionary&rdquo; he had  discovered with profound indignation a whole column of words feloniously and  mendaciously appropriated by the writer of such and such an article in the <em>Cheapside</em>. While the sunlight of hope  had shone upon him, Mr. Hawkehurst had found the hardest work pleasant. Was he  not working for <em>her</em> sake? Did not his  future union with that dear girl depend upon his present industry? It had  seemed to him as if she stood at his elbow while he wrote, as Pallas stood  beside Achilles at the council, invisible to all but her favourite. It was that  mystic presence which lent swiftness to his pen. When he was tired and  depressed, the thought of Charlotte had revived his courage and vanquished his  fatigue. Pleasant images crowded upon him when he thought of her. What could be  easier than for him to write a love-story? He had but to create a shadowy  Charlotte for his heroine, and the stream of foolish lover&rsquo;s babble flowed from  his pen perennial and inexhaustible. To his reading she lent a charm and a  grace that made the most perfect poetry still more poetical. It was not  Achilles and Helen who met on Mount Ida, but Valentine and Charlotte; it was  not Paolo and Francesca who read the fatal book together, but Valentine and  Charlotte, in an unregenerate and medi&aelig;val state of mind. The mere coincidence  of a name made the &ldquo;Sorrows of Werter&rdquo; delightful. The all-pervading presence  was everywhere and in everything. His religion was not Pantheism, but  Charlottism.</p>
<p>Now all was changed. A brooding care was with him  in every moment. The mystic presence was still close to him in every hour of  his lonely days and nights; but that image, which had been fair and blooming as  the incarnation of youth and spring-time, was now a pale shrouded phantom which  he dared not contemplate. He still wrote on &mdash; for it is marvellous how the pen  will travel and the mind will project itself into the shadow-world of fancy  while cankerous care gnaws the weary heart. Nay, it is perhaps at these times  that the imagination is most active; for the world of shadows is a kind of  refuge for the mind that dare not dwell upon realities. Who can say what dull,  leaden, care may have weighed down the heart of William Shakespeare when his  mind conceived that monster of a poet&rsquo;s grand imaginings, Othello! There is the  flavour of racking care in that mighty creation. The strong soul wantonly  tortured by a sordid wretch; the noble spirit distraught, the honourable life  wrecked for so poor a motive; that sense of the &ldquo;something in this world amiss,&rdquo;  which the poet, of all other creatures, feels most keenly.</p>
<p>With grief and fear as his constant companions,  Valentine Hawkehurst toiled on bravely, patiently. Hope had not deserted him;  but between hope and fear the contest was unceasing. Sometimes hope had the  best of it for a while, and the toiler comforted himself with the thought that  this dark cloud would pass anon from the horizon of his life; and then he  counted his gains, and found that the fruit of his labours was increasing  monthly, as his name gained rank among the band of young <em>litt&eacute;rateurs</em>. The day when he might count upon that income which  Mr. Sheldon demanded as his qualification for matrimony did not appear far  distant. Given a certain amount of natural ability, and the industrious and indefatigable  young writer may speedily emerge from obscurity, and take his place in the  great army of those gallant soldiers whose only weapon is the pen. Whatever  good fortune had come to Valentine Hawkehurst he had worked for with all  honesty of purpose. The critics were not slow to remark that he worked at a  white-hot haste, and must needs be a shallow pretender because he was laborious  and indefatigable.</p>
<p>Before the beginning of Charlotte&rsquo;s slow decline he  had fancied himself the happiest of men. There were more deposit-receipts in  his desk. The nest-egg, about the hatching whereof there had been such cackling  and crowing some months ago, was now one of many eggs; for the hard-working  scribbler had no leisure in which to be extravagant, had he been so minded. The  purchase of a half-circlet of diamonds for his betrothed&rsquo;s slim finger had been  his only folly.</p>
<p>Charlotte had remonstrated with him on the  impropriety of such an extravagance, and had exacted from him a promise that  this wild and Monte-Christo-like course should be pursued no further; but she  was very proud of her half-hoop of diamonds nevertheless, and was wont to press  it tenderly to her lips before she laid it aside for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be no more such extravagance, sir,&rdquo; she  said to her lover, when he sat by her side twisting the ring round and round on  her pretty finger. Alas, how loose the ring had become since it had first been  placed there!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider the future, Valentine,&rdquo; continued the  girl, hopeful of mood while her hand rested in his. &ldquo;Do you suppose we can  furnish our cottage at Wimbledon if we rush into such wild expenses as diamond  rings? Do you know that <em>I</em> am saving  money, Valentine? Yes, positively. Papa gives me a very good allowance for my  dresses, and bonnets, and things, you know, and I used to be extravagant and  spend it all. But now I have become the most miserly creature; and I have a  little packet of money upstairs which you shall put in the Unitas Bank with the  rest of your wealth. Diana and I have been darning, and patching, and cutting,  and contriving, in the most praiseworthy manner. Even this silk has been  turned. You did not think that, did you, when you admired it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst looked at his beloved with a tender  smile. The exact significance of the operation of turning, as applied to silk  dresses, was somewhat beyond his comprehension; but he felt sure that to turn  must be a laudable action, else why that air of pride with which Charlotte  informed him of the fact?</p>

  At Harold&rsquo;s Hill</h2>
<p>The summer sun shone upon the village of Harold&rsquo;s  Hill when Charlotte arrived there with Mrs. Sheldon and Diana Paget. Mr.  Sheldon was to follow them on the same day by a later train; and Valentine was  to come two days afterwards to spend the peaceful interval between Saturday and  Monday with his betrothed. He had seen the travellers depart from the London  Bridge terminus, but Mr. Sheldon had been there also, and there had been no  opportunity for confidential communication between the lovers.</p>
<p>Of all Sussex villages Harold&rsquo;s Hill is perhaps the  prettiest. The grey old Saxon church, the scattered farmhouses and pleasant  rustic cottages, are built on the slope of a hill, and all the width of ocean  lies below the rustic windows. The roses and fuchsias of the cottage gardens seem  all the brighter by contrast with that broad expanse of blue. The fresh breath  of the salt sea blends with the perfume of new-mown hay and all the homely  odours of the farmyard. The lark sings high in the blue vault of heaven above  the church, and over the blue of the sea the gull skims white in the sunshine.  The fisherman and the farm labourer have their cottages side by side, nestling  cosily to leeward of the hilly winding road.</p>
<p>This hilly winding road in the July afternoon  seemed to Charlotte almost like the way to Paradise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like going to heaven, Di!&rdquo; she cried, with  her eyes fixed on the square tower of the old grey church. She wondered why  sudden tears sprang to Diana&rsquo;s eyes as she said this. Miss Paget brushed the  unbidden tears away with a quick gesture of her hand, and smiled at her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, the village is very pretty, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks awfully dull!&rdquo; said Mrs. Sheldon, with a  shudder; &ldquo;and, Diana,
  I declare there isn&rsquo;t a single shop. Where are we to get our provisions?
  I told Mr. Sheldon St. Leonards would have been a better place for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O mamma, St. Leonards is the very essence of all  that is tame and commonplace, compared to this darling rural village! Look, do  look, at that fisherman&rsquo;s cottage, with the nets hanging out to dry in the  sunshine; just like a picture of Hook&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of going on about fishermen&rsquo;s  cottages, Lotta?&rdquo; Mrs.
  Sheldon demanded, peevishly. &ldquo;Fishermen&rsquo;s cottages won&rsquo;t provide us with
  butcher&rsquo;s meat. Where are we to get your little bit of roast mutton? Dr.
Doddleson laid such a stress upon the roast mutton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea-air will do me more good than all the  mutton that ever was roasted at Eton, mamma. O, dear, is this our farmhouse?&rdquo;  cried Charlotte, as the vehicle drew up at a picturesque gate. &ldquo;O, what a love  of a house! what diamond-paned windows! what sweet white curtains! and a cow  staring at me quite in the friendliest way across the gate! O, can we be so  happy as to live here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sheldon, in a solemn voice,  &ldquo;not a single shop have we passed &mdash; not so much as a post-office! And as to  haberdashery, I&rsquo;m sure you might be reduced to rags in this place before you  could get so much as a yard of glazed lining!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmhouse was one of those ideal homesteads  which, to the dweller in cities, seems fair as the sapphire-ceiled chambers of  the house of Solomon. Charlotte was enraptured by the idea that this was to be  her home for the next fortnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it could be for ever, Di,&rdquo; she said, as the  two girls were inspecting the rustic, dimity-draperied,  lavender-and-rose-leaf-perfumed bedchambers. &ldquo;Who would wish to go back to prim  suburban Bayswater after this? Valentine and I could lodge here after our  marriage. It is better than Wimbledon. Grand thoughts would come to him with  the thunder of the stormy waves; and on calm bright days like this the rippling  water would whisper pretty fancies into his ear. Why, to live here would make  any one a poet. I think I could write a novel myself, if I lived here long  enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this they arranged the pretty sitting-room,  and placed an easy-chair by the window for Charlotte, an arm-chair opposite  this for Mrs. Sheldon, and between the two a little table for the fancy work  and books and flowers, and all the small necessities of feminine existence. And  then &mdash; while Mrs. Sheldon prowled about the rooms, and discovered so many  faults and made so many objections as to give evidence of a fine faculty for  invention unsuspected in her hitherto &mdash; Charlotte and Diana explored the garden  and peeped at the farmyard, where the friendly cow still stared over the white  gate, just as she had stared when the fly came to a stop, as if she had not yet  recovered from the astonishment created in her pastoral mind by that phenomenal  circumstance. And then Charlotte was suddenly tired, and there came upon her  that strange dizziness which was one of her most frequent symptoms. Diana led  her immediately back to the house, and established her comfortably in her  easy-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be very ill,&rdquo; she said, plaintively; &ldquo;for  even the novelty of this pretty place cannot make me happy long.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon arrived in the evening, bringing with  him a supply of that simple medicine which Charlotte took three times a day. He  had remembered that there was no dispensing chemist at Harold&rsquo;s Hill, and that  it would be necessary to send to St. Leonards for the medicine, and had  therefore brought with him a double quantity of the mild tonic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very kind of you to think of it, though I  really don&rsquo;t believe the stuff does me any good,&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;Nancy  Woolper used to get it for me at Bayswater. She made quite a point of fetching  it from the chemist&rsquo;s herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Sheldon. &ldquo;Nancy troubled  herself about your medicine, did she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa; and about me altogether. If I were her  own daughter she could scarcely have seemed more anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stockbroker made a mental note of this in the  memorandum-book of his brain. Mrs. Woolper was officious, was she, and  suspicious? &mdash; altogether a troublesome sort of person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a few weeks of workhouse fare would be  wholesome for that old lady,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;There are some people who  never know when they are well off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon came in due course, after a long  and dreary interval, as it seemed to Charlotte, for whom time travelled very  slowly, so painful was the weariness of illness. Now and then a sudden flash of  excitement brought the old brightness to her face, the old gaiety to her  accents; but the brightness faded very soon, and the languor of illness was  very perceptible.</p>
<p>Punctual to the hour at which he was expected, Mr.  Hawkehurst appeared, in radiant spirits, laden with new magazines, delighted  with the village, enraptured with the garden, enchanted with the sea; full of  talk and animation, with all sorts of news to tell his beloved. Such and such a  book was a failure, such and such a comedy was a fiasco; Jones&rsquo;s novel had made  a hit; Brown&rsquo;s picture was the talk of the year; and Charlotte must see the  picture that had been talked about, and the play that had been condemned, when  she returned to town.</p>
<p>For an hour the lovers sat in the pretty farmhouse  parlour talking together thus, the summer sea and the garden flowers before  them, and a bird singing high in the calm blue heaven. Charlotte&rsquo;s talk was  somewhat languid, though it was perfect happiness for her to be seated thus,  with her betrothed by her side; but Valentine&rsquo;s gaiety of spirits never  flagged; and when Mrs. Sheldon hinted to him that too long a conversation might  fatigue the dear invalid, he left the parlour with a smile upon his face, and a  cheery promise to return after an hour&rsquo;s ramble.</p>
<p>He did not ramble far. He went straight to a little  wooden summer-house in the remotest corner of the humble garden; and thither  Diana Paget followed him. She had learned the language of his face in the time  of their daily companionship, and she had seen a look as he left the house  which told her of the struggle his cheerfulness had cost him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not be downhearted, Valentine,&rdquo; she said,  as she went into the summer-house, where he sat in a listless attitude, with  his arms lying loosely folded on the rustic table.</p>
<p>He did not answer her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think her worse &mdash; much worse &mdash; do you,  Valentine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse? I have seen death in her face to-day!&rdquo; he cried;  and then he let his forehead fall upon his folded arms, and sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>Diana stood by his side watching that outburst of  grief. When the passionate storm of tears was past, she comforted him as best  she might. The change so visible to him was not so plain to her. He had hoped  that the breath of the ocean would have magical power to restore the invalid.  He had come to Harold&rsquo;s Hill full of hope, and instead of the beginning of an  improvement he saw the progress of decay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did not Sheldon send for the doctor,&rdquo; he  asked, indignantly,&mdash; &ldquo;the physician who has attended her? He might have  telegraphed to that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte is taking Dr. Doddleson&rsquo;s medicine,&rdquo;  said Diana, &ldquo;and all his directions are most carefully obeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of that, if she grows worse? The doctor  should see her daily, hourly, if necessary. And if he cannot cure her, another  doctor should be sent for. Good heavens, Diana! are we to let her fade and sink  from us before our eyes? I will go back to London at once, and bring that man Doddleson  down by the night mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your going back to London would grieve and alarm  Charlotte. You can telegraph for the doctor; or, at least, Mr. Sheldon can do  so. It would not do for you to interfere without his permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not do!&rdquo; echoed Valentine, angrily. &ldquo;Do  you think that I am going to stand upon punctilio, or to consider what will do  or will not do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above all things, you must avoid alarming  Charlotte,&rdquo; pleaded Diana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I do not know that? Do you think I  did not feel that just now, when I sat by her side, talking inane rubbish about  books and plays and pictures, while every stolen glance at my darling&rsquo;s face  was like a dagger thrust into my heart? I will not alarm her. I will consult  Mr. Sheldon &mdash; will do anything, everything, to save her! To save her! O my God,  has it come to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grew a little calmer presently under Diana&rsquo;s  influence, and went slowly back to the house. He avoided the open window by  which Charlotte was sitting. He had not yet schooled himself to meet her  questioning looks. He went to the room where they were to dine, a duller and  darker apartment than the parlour, and here he found Mr. Sheldon reading a  paper, one of the eternal records of the eternal money-market.</p>
<p>The stockbroker had been in and out of the house  all day, now sauntering by the sea-shore, now leaning moodily, with folded  arms, on the garden gate, meditative and silent as the cow that stared at  Charlotte; now pacing the garden walks, with his hands in his pockets and his  head bent. Diana, who in her anxiety kept a close watch upon Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  movements, had noted his restlessness, and perceived in it the sign of growing  anxiety on his part. She knew that he had once called himself surgeon-dentist,  and had some medical knowledge, if not so much as he took credit for  possessing. He must, therefore, be better able to judge the state of  Charlotte&rsquo;s health than utterly ignorant observers. If he were uneasy, there  must be real cause for uneasiness. It was on this account, and on this account  only, that Diana watched him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must love her better than I gave him credit for  being able to love any one,&rdquo; Miss Paget said to herself. &ldquo;Dear girl! The  coldest heart is touched by her sweetness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon looked up from his newspaper as  Valentine came into the room, and saluted the visitor with a friendly nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, Hawkehurst,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;<em>Semper fidelis</em>, and that kind of thing;  the very model of devoted lovers. Why, man alive, how glum you look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have reason to look glum,&rdquo; answered Valentine,  gravely; &ldquo;I have seen Charlotte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes? And don&rsquo;t you find her improving? &mdash;  gradually, of course. That constitutional languor is not shaken off in a hurry.  But surely you think her improving &mdash; brightening&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brightening with the light that never shone on  earth or sea. God help me! I &mdash; I &mdash; am the merest child, the veriest coward,  the&mdash;&rdquo; He made a great effort, and stifled the sob that had well-nigh broken his  voice. &ldquo;Mr. Sheldon,&rdquo; he continued quietly, &ldquo;I believe your stepdaughter is  dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dying! Good heavens! &mdash; my dear Hawkehurst, this  alarm is most &mdash; most premature. There is no cause for fear &mdash; at present, no  cause &mdash; I give you my word as a medical man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No cause for alarm at present? That means my  darling will not be taken from me to-night, or to-morrow. I shall have a few  days breathing-time. Yes, I understand. The doom is upon us. I saw the shadow  of death upon her face to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Hawkehurst&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Sheldon, for pity&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t treat me as  if I were a woman or a child. Let me know my fate. If &mdash; if &mdash; this, the worst,  most bitter of all calamities God&rsquo;s hand &mdash; raised against me in punishment of  past sins, sinned lightly and recklessly, in the days when my heart had no  stake in the game of destiny &mdash; can inflict upon me; if this deadly sorrow is  bearing down upon me, let me meet it like a man. Let me die with my eyes  uncovered. O, my dearest, my fondest, redeeming angel of my ill-spent life!  have you been only a supernal visitant, after all, shining on me for a little  while, to depart when your mission of redemption is accomplished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Powers above!&rdquo; thought Mr. Sheldon, &ldquo;what nonsense  these sentimental magazine-writers can talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was in nowise melted by the lover&rsquo;s anguish,  though it was very real. Such a grief as this was outside the circle in which  his thoughts revolved. This display of grief was unpleasant to him. It grated  painfully upon his nerves, as some of poor Tom Halliday&rsquo;s little speeches had  done of old, when the honest-hearted Yorkshireman lay on his deathbed; and the  young man&rsquo;s presence and the young man&rsquo;s anxiety were alike inconvenient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me the truth, Mr. Sheldon,&rdquo; Valentine said  presently, with suppressed intensity. &ldquo;Is there any hope for my darling, any  hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon considered for some moments before he  replied to this question. He pursed-up his lips and bent his brows with the  same air of business-like deliberation that he might have assumed while  weighing the relative merits of the first and second debenture bonds of some  doubtful railway company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask me a trying question, Hawkehurst,&rdquo; he said  at last. &ldquo;If you ask me plainly whether I like the turn which Charlotte&rsquo;s  illness has taken within the last few weeks, I must tell you frankly, I do not.  There is a persistent want of tone &mdash; a visible decay of vital power &mdash; which, I  must confess, has caused me some uneasiness. You see, the fact is, there is a  radical weakness of constitution &mdash; as Miss Paget, a very sensible girl and  acute observer &mdash; herself has remarked, indeed a hereditary weakness; and against  this medicine is sometimes unavailing. You need apprehend no neglect on my  part, Hawkehurst; all that can possibly be done is being done. Dr. Doddleson&rsquo;s  instructions are carefully obeyed, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Dr. Doddleson competent to grapple with  the case?&rdquo; asked
  Valentine; &ldquo;I never heard of him as a great man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fact proves how little you know of the  medical profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of it; I have had no need for  doctors in my life. And you think this Dr. Doddleson really clever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His position is a sufficient answer to that  question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let me telegraph for him &mdash; this afternoon  &mdash; immediately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot telegraph from this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but from St. Leonards I can. Do you think I am  afraid of a five-mile walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why send for Dr. Doddleson? The treatment he  prescribed is the treatment we are now following to the letter. To summon him  down here would be the merest folly. Our poor Charlotte&rsquo;s illness is, so far,  free from all alarming symptoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not see the change in her that I can see,&rdquo;  cried Valentine piteously. &ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, Mr. Sheldon, let me have my way  in this. I cannot stand by and see my dear one fading and do nothing &mdash; nothing  to save her. Let me send for this man. Let me see him myself, and hear what he  says. You can have no objection to his coming, since he is the man you have  chosen for Charlotte&rsquo;s adviser? It can only be a question of expense. Let this  particular visit be my affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can afford to pay for my stepdaughter&rsquo;s medical  attendance without any help from your purse, Mr. Hawkehurst,&rdquo; said the  stockbroker with offended pride. &ldquo;There is one element in the case which you  appear to ignore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The alarm which this summoning of a doctor from  London must cause in
  Charlotte&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It need cause no alarm. She can be told that Dr.  Doddleson has come to this part of the world for a Sunday&rsquo;s change of air. The  visit can appear to be made <em>en passant.</em> It will be easy to arrange that with the doctor before he sees her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, Mr. Hawkehurst,&rdquo; the stockbroker  replied coldly. &ldquo;I consider such a visit to the last degree unnecessary; but if  Dr. Doddleson&rsquo;s coming can give you any satisfaction, by all means let him  come. The expense involved in summoning him is of the smallest consideration to  me. My position with regard to my wife&rsquo;s daughter is one of extreme  responsibility, and I am ready to perform all the obligations of that  position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good: your conduct in relation to  Charlotte and myself has been beyond all praise. It is quite possible that I am  over-anxious; but there was a look in that dear face &mdash; no &mdash; I cannot forget  that look; it struck terror to my heart. I will go at once to St. Leonards. I  can tell Charlotte that I am obliged to telegraph to the printer about my copy.  You will not object to that white lie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. I think it essential that Charlotte  should not be alarmed. You had better stop to dine; there will be time for the  telegram after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not risk that,&rdquo; answered Valentine. &ldquo;I  cannot eat or drink till I have done something to lessen this wretched  anxiety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went back to the room where Charlotte was  sitting by the open window, through which there came the murmur of waves, the  humming of drowsy bees, the singing of birds, all the happy voices of happy nature  in a harmonious chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O God, wilt thou take her away from such a  beautiful world,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;and change all the glory of earth to darkness and  desolation for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His heart rebelled against the idea of her death.  To save her, to win her back to himself from the jaws of death, he was ready to  promise anything, to do anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my days will I give to Thy service, if Thou  wilt spare her to me,&rdquo; in his heart he said to his God. &ldquo;If Thou dost not, I  will be an infidel and a pagan &mdash; the vilest and most audacious of sinners.  Better to serve Lucifer than the God who could so afflict me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this is where the semi-enlightened Christian  betrays the weakness of his faith. While the sun shines, and the sweet gospel  story reads to him like some tender Arcadian idyl, all love and promise, he is  firm in his allegiance; but when the dark hour comes, he turns his face to the  wall, with anger and disappointment in his heart, and will have no further  commune with the God who has chastised him. His faith is the faith of the  grateful leper, who, being healed, was eager to return and bless his divine  benefactor. It is not the faith of Abraham or of Job, of Paul or of Stephen.</p>
<p>Valentine told his story about the printers and the  copy for the <em>Cheapside</em> magazine,  about which there had arisen some absurd mistake, only to be set right by a  telegram.</p>
<p>It was not a very clear account; but Charlotte did  not perceive the vagueness of the story; she thought only of the one fact, that  Valentine must leave her for some hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evening will seem so long without you,&rdquo; she  said. &ldquo;That is the worst part of my illness; the time is so long &mdash; so weary.  Diana is the dearest and kindest of friends. She is always trying to amuse me,  and reads to me for hours, though I know she must often be tired of reading  aloud so long. But even the books I was once so fond of do not amuse me. The  words seem to float indistinctly in my brain, and all sorts of strange images  mix themselves up with the images of the people in the book. Di has been  reading &ldquo;The Bride of Lammermoor&rdquo; all this morning; but the pain and weariness  I feel seemed to be entangled with Lucy and Edgar somehow, and the dear book  gave me no pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, you &mdash; you are too weak to listen to  Diana&rsquo;s reading. It is very kind of her to try to amuse you; but &mdash; but it would  be better for you to rest altogether. Any kind of mental exertion may help to  retard your recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had placed himself behind her chair, and was  bending over the pillows to speak to her. Just now he felt himself unequal to  the command of his countenance. He bent his head until his lips touched the  soft brown hair, and kissed those loose soft tresses passionately. The thought  occurred to him that a day might come when he should again kiss that soft brown  hair, with a deeper passion, with a sharper pain, and when Charlotte would not  know of his kisses, or pity his pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Valentine!&rdquo; cried Charlotte, &ldquo;you are crying; I  can see your face in the glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had forgotten the glass; the little rococo  mirror, with an eagle hovering over the top of the frame, which hung above the  old-fashioned chiffonier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so very ill, dear; I am not indeed,&rdquo; the  girl continued, turning in her chair with an effort, and clasping her lover&rsquo;s  hands; &ldquo;you must not distress yourself like this, Valentine &mdash; dear Valentine! I  shall be better by-and-by. I cannot think that I shall be taken from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had broken down altogether by this time. He  buried his face in the pillows, and contrived to stifle the sobs that would  come; and then, after a sharp struggle, he lifted his face, and bent over the  chair once more to kiss the invalid&rsquo;s pale upturned forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear one, you shall not, if love can guard and  keep you. No, dear, I <em>cannot</em> believe  that God will take you from me. Heaven may be your fittest habitation; but such  sweet spirits as yours are sorely needed upon earth. I will be brave, dearest  one; brave and hopeful in the mercy of Heaven. And now I must go and telegraph  to my tiresome printer. <em>Au revoir</em>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried away from the farmhouse, and started at  a rattling pace along the pleasant road, with green waving corn on his left,  and broad blue ocean on his right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can get a fly to bring me back from St.  Leonard&rsquo;s&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;I should only lose time by hunting for a vehicle here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was at St. Leonards station within an hour after  leaving the farm. He despatched the message in Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s name, and took  care to make it urgent.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
  Desperate Measures</h2>
<p>Fitful and feverish were the slumbers which visited  Mr. Hawkehurst on that balmy summer&rsquo;s night. His waking hours were anxious and  unhappy; but his sleeping hours were still more painful. To sleep was to be the  feverish fool of vague wild visions, in which Charlotte and Dr. Doddleson, the  editor of the <em>Cheapside</em>, the  officials of the British Museum reading-room, Diana Paget, and the Sheldons,  figured amidst inextricable confusion of circumstances and places. Throughout  these wretched dreams he had some consciousness of himself and the room in  which he was lying, the July moon shining upon him, broad and bright, through  the diamond-paned lattice. And O, what torturing visions were those in which  Charlotte smiled upon him, radiant with health and happiness; and there had  been no such thing as her illness, no such thing as his grief. And then came  hurried dreams, in which Dr. Doddleson was knocking at the farmhouse door, with  the printer of the <em>Cheapside</em>. And  then he was a spectator in a mighty theatre, large as those Roman  amphitheatres, wherein the audience seemed a mass of flies, looking down on the  encounter of two other flies, and all the glory of an imperial court only a  little spot of purple and gold, gleaming afar in the sunshine. To the dreamer  it was no surprise that this unknown theatre of his dreams should be vast as the  gladiatorial arena. And then came the deep thunderous music of innumerable  bass-viols and bassoons: and some one told him it was the first night of a  great tragedy. He felt the breathless hush of expectation; the solemn bass  music sank deeper; dark curtains were drawn aside, with a motion slow and  solemn, like the waving of mountain pines, and there appeared a measureless  stage, revealing a moonlit expanse, thickly studded with the white headstones  of unnumbered graves, and on the foremost of these &mdash; revealed to him by what  power he knew not, since mortal sight could never have reached a point so  distant &mdash; he read the name of Charlotte Halliday. He awoke with a sharp cry of  pain. It was broad day, and the waves were dancing gaily in the morning  sunlight. He rose and dressed himself. Sleep, such as he had known that night,  was worse than the weariest waking. He went out into the garden by-and-by, and  paced slowly up and down the narrow pathways, beside which box of a century&rsquo;s  growth rose dark and high. Pale yellow lights were in the upper windows. He  wondered which of those sickly tapers flickered on the face he loved so fondly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a year since I first saw her,&rdquo; he  thought: &ldquo;one year! And to love her has been my &lsquo;liberal education;&rsquo; to lose  her would be my desolation and despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To lose her! His thoughts approached that dread  possibility, but could not realize it; not even yet.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock Diana came to summon him to  breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I see Charlotte?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; for some time past she has not come down to  breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of night has she had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very quiet night, she tells me; but I am not  quite sure that she tells me the truth, she is so afraid of giving us  uneasiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She tells you. But do you not sleep in her room,  now that she is so ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I was anxious to sleep on a sofa at the foot  of her bed, and proposed doing so, but Mr. Sheldon objects to my being in the  room. He thinks that Charlotte is more quiet entirely alone, and that there is  more air in the room with only one sleeper. Her illness is not of a kind to  require attention of any sort in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still I should have thought it better for her to  have you with her, to cheer and comfort her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, Valentine, I wished to be with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of that, dear,&rdquo; he answered kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s authority, as a man of  some medical experience, that conquered my wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose he is right. And now we must go in  to breakfast. Ah, the dreary regularity of these breakfasts and dinners, which  go on just the same when our hearts are breaking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The breakfast was indeed a dreary soul-dispiriting  meal. Farmhouse luxuries, in the way of new-laid eggs and home-cured bacon,  abounded; but no one had any inclination for these things. Valentine remembered  the homestead among the Yorkshire hills, with all the delight that he had known  there; and the &ldquo;sorrow&rsquo;s crown of sorrow&rdquo; was very bitter. Mr. Sheldon gave his  Sabbath-morning meditations to the study of a Saturday-evening share-list; and  Georgy plunged ever and anon into the closely printed pages of a Dissenting  preacher&rsquo;s biography, which she declared to be &ldquo;comforting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana and Valentine sat silent and anxious; and  after the faintest pretence of eating and drinking, they both left the table,  to stroll drearily in the garden. The bells were ringing cheerily from the grey  stone tower near at hand; but Valentine had no inclination for church on this  particular morning. Were not all his thoughts prayers &mdash; humble piteous  entreaties &mdash; for one priceless boon?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you see the doctor when he comes, and manage  matters so as not to alarm Charlotte?&rdquo; he asked of Mr. Sheldon. That gentleman  agreed to do so, and went out into the little front-garden to lie in wait for  the great Doddleson&mdash; &ldquo;Dowager Doddleson&rdquo; as he was surnamed by some irreverent  unbelievers.</p>
<p>A St. Leonards fly brought the doctor while the  bells were still ringing for morning service. Mr. Sheldon received him at the  gate; and explained the motive of his summons.</p>
<p>The doctor was full of pompous solicitude about  &ldquo;our sweet young patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really one of the most interesting cases I ever  had upon my hands,&rdquo; the West-end physician said blandly; &ldquo;as I was remarking to  a very charming patient of mine &mdash; in point of fact, the amiable and  accomplished Countess of Kassel-Kumberterre, only last Tuesday morning. A case  so nearly resembling the Countess&rsquo;s own condition as to be highly interesting  to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really ought to apologize for bringing you  down,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon, as he led the doctor into the house. &ldquo;I only consented  to your being sent for in order to tranquillize this young fellow Hawkehurst,  who is engaged to my daughter; a rising man, I believe, in his own particular  line, but rather wild and impracticable. There is really no change for the  worse, absolutely none; and as we have not been here more than three days,  there has been positively no opportunity for testing the effect of change and  sea air, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed rather like giving the learned  physician his cue. And there were those among Dr. Doddleson&rsquo;s professional  rivals who said that the worthy doctor was never slow to take a cue so given,  not being prejudiced by any opinions of his own.</p>
<p>Charlotte had by this time been established in her  easy-chair by the open window of the sitting-room, and here Dr. Doddleson saw  her, in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Sheldon; and here Dr. Doddleson went  through the usual Abracadabra of his art, and assented to the opinions  advanced, with all deference, by Mr. Sheldon.</p>
<p>To Georgy this interview, in which Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  opinions were pompously echoed by the West-end physician, proved even more  comforting than the benignant career of the Dissenting minister, who was wont  to allude to that solemn passing hence of which the ancients spoke in dim  suggestive phrase, as &ldquo;going upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana and Valentine strolled in the garden while  the physician saw his patient. Dr. Doddleson&rsquo;s ponderous polysyllables floated  out upon the summer air like the droning of a humble-bee. It was a relief to  Valentine to know that the doctor was with his patient: but he had no intention  to let that gentleman depart unquestioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take no secondhand information,&rdquo; he  thought; &ldquo;I will hear this man&rsquo;s opinion from his own lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went round to the front of the house directly  the droning had ceased, and was in the way when Dr. Doddleson and Mr. Sheldon  came out of the rose-hung porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have no objection,&rdquo; he said to Mr. Sheldon,  &ldquo;I should like to ask
  Dr. Doddleson a few questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> have  no objection,&rdquo; replied the stockbroker; &ldquo;but it is really altogether such an  unusual thing, and I doubt if Dr. Doddleson will consent to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here he cast a deprecating glance at the  doctor, as who should say, &ldquo;Can you permit yourself to comply with a demand so  entirely unwarranted by precedent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dowager Doddleson was eminently good-natured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is our sweet young friend&rsquo;s <em>fianc&eacute;</em>,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;dear me &mdash; dee-ar me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he looked at Valentine with bland  pale-blue eyes that twinkled behind his gold-framed spectacles; while Valentine  was taking his measure, so far as the measure of any man&rsquo;s moral and  intellectual force can be taken by the eyes of another man. &ldquo;And this is the  man who is chosen to snatch my darling from the jaws of death!&rdquo; he said to  himself, with burning rage in his heart, while the amiable physician repeated  blandly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is our sweet young patient&rsquo;s <em>fianc&eacute;</em>. Dee-ar me, how very  interesting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three men strolled round to the garden behind  the house, Mr. Sheldon close at the physician&rsquo;s elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake tell me the truth, Dr. Doddleson!&rdquo;  said Valentine in a low hoarse voice, directly they were beyond ear-shot of the  house. &ldquo;I am a man, and I can steel myself to hear the worst you can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But really, Hawkehurst, there is no occasion for  this kind of thing,&rdquo; interjected Philip Sheldon; &ldquo;Dr. Doddleson agrees with me,  that the case is one of extreme languor, and no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unquestionably,&rdquo; said the doctor in a fat voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Dr. Doddleson also coincides with me in the  opinion that all we can do is to wait the reviving influence of sea-air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; said the doctor, with a solemn nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is this all?&rdquo; asked Valentine hopelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, what else can I say?&rdquo; said the  doctor; &ldquo;as my good friend Mr. Sheldon has just remarked, there is extreme  languor; and as my good friend Mr. Sheldon further observes, we must await the  effect of change of air. The &mdash; aw &mdash; invigorating sea-breezes, the &mdash; aw &mdash;  enlivening influence of new surroundings, and &mdash; aw &mdash; so forth. Dr. Poseidon, my  dear sir, is a very valuable coadjutor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think your patient no worse, Dr.  Doddleson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor has just left Mrs. Sheldon much  comforted by his assurance that her daughter is better,&rdquo; said the stockbroker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. Doddleson; &ldquo;no, no! <em>there</em> my good friend Mr. Sheldon  somewhat misrepresents me. I said that our patient was not obviously worse. I  did not say that our patient was better. There is a dilatation of the pupil of  the eye which I don&rsquo;t quite understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mental excitement,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon, somewhat  hastily; &ldquo;Charlotte is nervous to an extreme degree, and your sudden arrival  was calculated to shake her nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; rejoined the doctor; &ldquo;and it is  unquestionable that such a dilatation of the pupil might, under certain  circumstances, be occasioned by mental excitement. I am sorry to find that our  patient&rsquo;s attacks of dizziness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which are purely the effect of fancy,&rdquo; interjected  Mr. Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which are no doubt, in some measure, attributable  to a hypochondriacal condition of mind,&rdquo; continued the doctor in his fat voice.  &ldquo;I am sorry to find that this periodical dizziness has been somewhat increased  of late. But here again we must look to Dr. Poseidon. Tepid sea-baths, if they  can be managed, in the patient&rsquo;s own room; and by-and-by a dip in the waves yonder,  may do wonders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine asked no further questions; and the  physician departed in the St. Leonards fly, to turn his excursion to profitable  use by calling on two or three dowagers in Warrior Square and Marina, who would  doubtless be glad of an unexpected visit from their pet doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Hawkehurst,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon, when the fly  had driven away, &ldquo;I hope you are satisfied now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satisfied!&rdquo; cried Valentine; &ldquo;yes, I am satisfied  that your stepdaughter is being murdered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered!&rdquo; echoed the stockbroker, his voice thick  and faint; but
  Valentine did not heed the change in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, murdered &mdash; sacrificed to the utter  incompetence of that old idiot who has just left us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip Sheldon drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;do you doubt Doddleson&rsquo;s  skill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in it? Do you? No; I cannot think  that a man of your keen perception in all other matters &mdash; half a medical man  yourself &mdash; can be the dupe of so shallow an impostor. And it is to that man&rsquo;s  judgment my darling&rsquo;s life has been confided; and it is to that man I have  looked, with hope and comfort in the thought of his power to save my treasure!  Good God! what a reed on which to rely! And of all the medical men of London,  this is the one you have chosen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must really protest against this rant,  Hawkehurst,&rdquo; said Philip Sheldon. &ldquo;I hold myself responsible for the selection  which I made, and will not have that selection questioned in this violent and  outrageous manner by you. Your anxiety for Charlotte&rsquo;s recovery may excuse a  great deal, but it cannot excuse this kind of thing; and if you cannot command  yourself better, I must beg you to absent yourself from my house until my  stepdaughter&rsquo;s recovery puts an end to all this fuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in Dr. Doddleson&rsquo;s skill?&rdquo; asked  Valentine doggedly. He wanted to have that question answered at any cost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most decidedly I do, with the rest of the medical  world. My choice of this gentleman as Charlotte&rsquo;s adviser was governed by his  reputation as a safe and conscientious man. His opinions are sound,  trustworthy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His opinions!&rdquo; cried Valentine with a bitter  laugh; &ldquo;what in heaven&rsquo;s name do you call his opinions? The only opinions I  could extract from him to-day were solemn echoes of yours. And the man himself!  I took the measure of him before I asked him a question; and physiology is a  lie if that man is anything better than an impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His position is the answer to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His position is no answer. He is not the first  impostor who has attained position, and is not likely to be the last. You must  forgive me, if I speak with some violence, Mr. Sheldon. I feel too deeply to  remember the conventionalities of my position. The dear girl yonder, hovering  between life and death, is my promised wife. As your stepdaughter she is very  dear to you, no doubt, and you are of course anxious to do your duty as her  stepfather. But she is all the world to me &mdash; my one sweet memory of the past,  my sole hope for the future. I will not trust her to the care of Dr. Doddleson;  I claim the right to choose another physician &mdash; as that man&rsquo;s coadjutor, if you  please. I have no wish to offend the doctor of your choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all sheer nonsense,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nonsense about which you must let me have my  own way,&rdquo; replied Valentine, resolutely. &ldquo;My stake on this hazard is too heavy  for careless play. I shall go back to town at once and seek out a physician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know any great man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but I will find one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go today, you will inevitably alarm  Charlotte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True; and disappoint her into the bargain. I  suppose in such a case tomorrow will do as well as to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go by the first train, and return with my  doctor in the afternoon.
  Yes, I will go tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon breathed more freely. There are cases  in which to obtain time for thought seems the one essential thing &mdash; cases in  which a reprieve is as good as a pardon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray let us consider this business quietly,&rdquo; he  said, with a faint sigh of weariness. &ldquo;There is no necessity for all this  excitement. You can go to town to-morrow, by the first train, as you say. If it  is any satisfaction to you to bring down a physician, bring one; bring half a  dozen, if you please. But, for the last time, I most emphatically assure you  that anything that tends to alarm Charlotte is the one thing of all others most  sure to hinder her recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that. She shall not be frightened; but she  shall have a better adviser than Dr. Doddleson. And now I will go back to the  house. She will wonder at my absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to the bright, airy room where Charlotte  was seated, her head lying back upon the pillows, her face paler, her glances  and tones more languid than on the previous day as it seemed to Valentine.  Diana was near her, solicitous and tender; and on the other side of the window  sat Mrs. Sheldon, with her Dissenting minister&rsquo;s biography open on her lap.</p>
<p>All through that day Valentine Hawkehurst played  his part bravely: it was a hard and bitter part to play &mdash; the part of hope and  confidence while unutterable fears were rending his heart. He read the epistle  and gospel of the day to his betrothed; and afterwards some chapters of St.  John &mdash; those profoundly mournful chapters that foreshadow the agonising close.  It was Charlotte who selected these chapters, and her lover could find no  excuse for disputing her choice.</p>
<p>It was the first time that they had shared any  religious exercise, and the hearts of both were deeply touched by the thought  of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How frivolous all our talk must have been,  Valentine, when it seems so new to us to be reading these beautiful words  together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her head was half supported by the pillows, half  resting on her lover&rsquo;s shoulder, and her eyes travelled along the lines as he  read, in a calm low voice, which was unbroken to the end.</p>
<p>Early in the evening Charlotte retired, worn out by  the day&rsquo;s physical weariness, in spite of Valentine&rsquo;s fond companionship.  Later, when it was dusk, Diana came downstairs with the news that the invalid  was sleeping quietly. Mrs. Sheldon was dozing in her arm-chair, the Dissenting  minister having fallen to the ground; and Valentine was leaning, with folded  arms, on the broad window-sill looking out into the shadowy garden. Mr. Sheldon  had given them very little of his society during that day. He went out  immediately after his interview with Valentine, on a sea-coast ramble, which  lasted till dinner-time. After dinner he remained in the room where they had  dined. He was there now. The light of the candles, by which he read his papers,  shone out upon the dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come for a stroll with me, Diana?&rdquo; asked  Valentine.</p>
<p>Miss Paget assented promptly; and they went out  into the garden, beyond the reach of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s ears, had that gentleman  been disposed to place himself at his open window in the character of a  listener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you my plans about Charlotte,&rdquo;  Valentine began. &ldquo;I am going to London to-morrow to search for a greater  physician than Dr. Doddleson. I shall find my man in an hour or so; and, if  possible, shall return with him in the evening. There is no apparent reason to  anticipate any sudden change for the worse; but if such a change should take  place, I rely on you, dear, to give me the earliest tidings of it. I suppose  you can get a fly here, if you want one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can get to St. Leonards, if that is what you  mean,&rdquo; Miss Paget answered promptly. &ldquo;I dare say there is a fly to be had; if  not, I can walk there. I am not afraid of a few miles&rsquo; walk, by day or night.  If there should be a change, Valentine &mdash; which God forbid &mdash; I will telegraph  the tidings of it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better address the message to me at  Rancy&rsquo;s, Covent Garden; the house where the Ragamuffins have their rooms, you  know, dear. That is a more central point than my lodgings, and nearer the  terminus. I will call there two or three times in the course of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may trust my vigilance, Valentine. I did not  think it was in my nature to love any one as I love Charlotte Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gustave Lenoble&rsquo;s letters lying unanswered in her  desk asserted the all-absorbing nature of Diana&rsquo;s affection for the fading  girl. She <em>was</em> fading. The  consciousness of this made all other love sacrilege, as it seemed to Diana. She  sat up late that night to answer Gustave&rsquo;s last letter of piteous complaint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had forgotten him. Ah, that he had been  foolish &mdash; insensate &mdash; to confide himself in her love! Was he not old and grey  in comparison to such youth &mdash; such freshness &mdash; a venerable dotard of  thirty-five? What had he with dreams of love and marriage? Fie, then. He  humiliated himself in the dust beneath her <em>mignon</em> feet. He invited her to crush him with those cruel feet. But if she did not  answer his letters, he would come to Harold&rsquo;s Hill. He would mock himself of  that ferocious Sheldon &mdash; of a battalion of Sheldons still more ferocious &mdash; of  all the world, at last &mdash; to be near her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, dear Gustave, I do not forget,&rdquo; wrote  Diana, in reply to these serio-comic remonstrances. &ldquo;I was truly sorry to leave  town, on your account and on my father&rsquo;s. But my dear adopted sister is  paramount with me now. You will not grudge her my care or my love, for she may  not long be with me to claim them. There is nothing but sorrow here in all our  hearts; sorrow, and an ever-present dread.&rdquo;</p>

  A Fight Against Time</em></h1>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
  A Dread Revelation</h2>
<p>The early fast train by which Valentine Hawkehurst  travelled brought him into town at a quarter past nine o&rsquo;clock. During the  journey he had been meditating on the way in which he should set to work when  he arrived in London. No ignorance could be more profound than his on all  points relating to the medical profession. Dimly floating in his brain there  were the names of doctors whom he had heard of as celebrated men &mdash; one for the  chest, another for the liver, another for the skin, another for the eyes; but,  among all these famous men, who was the man best able to cope with the  mysterious wasting away, the gradual, almost imperceptible ebbing of that one  dear life which Valentine wanted to save?</p>
<p>This question must be answered by some one; and  Valentine was sorely puzzled as to who that some one must be.</p>
<p>The struggling young writer had but few friends. He  had, indeed, worked too hard for the possibility of friendship. The cultivation  of the severer Muses is rarely compatible with a wide circle of acquaintances;  and Valentine, if not a cultivator of these severe ones, had been a hard and  honest worker during the later reputable portion of his life. His friendships  of the previous portion had been the friendships of the railway-carriage and  the smoking room, the <em>caf&eacute;</em> and the  gaming-table. He could count upon his fingers the people to whom he could apply  for counsel in this crisis of his life. There was George Sheldon, a man for  whom he entertained a most profound contempt; Captain Paget, a man who might or  might not be able to give him good advice, but who would inevitably sacrifice  Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s welfare to self-interest, if self-interest could be served  by the recommendation of an incompetent adviser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would send me to some idiot of the Doddleson  class, if he thought he could get a guinea or a dinner by the recommendation,&rdquo;  Valentine said to himself, and decided that to Horatio Paget he would not  apply. There were his employers, the editors and proprietors of the magazines  for which he worked; all busy over-burdened workers in the great mill, spending  the sunny hours of their lives between a pile of unanswered letters and a  waste-paper basket; men who would tell him to look in the Post-office  Directory, without lifting their eyes from the paper over which their restless  pens were speeding.</p>
<p>No. Amongst these was not the counsellor whom  Valentine Hawkehurst needed in this dire hour of difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some very good fellows among the  Ragamuffins,&rdquo; he said to himself, as he thought of the only literary and  artistic club of which he was a member; &ldquo;fellows who stuck by me when I was  down in the world, and who would do anything to serve me now they know me for  an honest worker. But, unfortunately, farce writers and burlesque writers, and  young meerschaum-smoking painters, are not the sort of men to give good advice:  I want the advice of a medical man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst almost bounded from his seat as he  said this. The advice of a medical man? Yes; and was there not a medical man  among the Ragamuffins? and something more than a medical man? That very doctor,  who of all other men upon this earth could best give him counsel &mdash; the doctor  who had stood by the deathbed of Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>He remembered the conversation that had occurred at  Bayswater, on the evening of Christmas day, upon this very subject. He  remembered how from the talk about ghosts they had drifted somehow into talking  of Tom Halliday; whereupon Mrs. Sheldon had been melted to tears, and had gone  on to praise Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s conduct to his dying friend, and to speak of Mr.  Burkham, the strange doctor, called in too late to save, or, it might have  been, incapable to save.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheldon seems to have a genius for calling in  incapable doctors,&rdquo; he thought bitterly.</p>
<p>Incapable as Mr. Burkham might have been for the  exigencies of this particular case, he would at least be able to inform  Valentine who among the medical celebrities of London would be best adapted to  advise in such an illness as Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if, as Diana has sometimes suggested, there is  any hereditary disease, this Burkham may be able to throw some light upon the  nature of it,&rdquo; thought Valentine.</p>
<p>He went straight from the railway terminus to the  quiet tavern upon the first floor of which the Ragamuffins had their place of  rendezvous. It was not an hour for the encounter of many Ragamuffins. A  meek-looking young man, of clerical aspect, who had adapted a Palais Royal  farce, and had awoke in the morning to find himself famous, and eligible for  admission amongst the Ragamuffins, was sipping his sherry and soda-water while  he skimmed the morning papers. Him Mr. Hawkehurst saluted with an absent nod,  and went in search of the steward of the club, from whom he obtained Mr.  Burkham&rsquo;s address, with some little trouble in the way of hunting through old  and obscure documents.</p>
<p>It was the old address; the old dingy, comfortable,  muffin-bell-haunted street in which Mr. Burkham had lived ten years before,  when he was summoned to attend the sick Yorkshire farmer.</p>
<p>Mr. Burkham&rsquo;s career had not been brightened by the  sunshine of prosperity. He had managed to live somehow, and to find food and  raiment for his young wife, who, when she considered the lilies of the field,  may have envied their shining robes of pure whiteness, so dingy and dark was  her own apparel. When children came, the young surgeon contrived to find food  and raiment for them also, but not without daily and hourly struggles with that  grim wolf who haunts the thresholds of so many dwellings, and will not be  thrust from the door. Sometimes a little glimmering ray of light illumined Mr.  Burkham&rsquo;s pathway, and he was humbly grateful to Providence for the brief  glimpse of sunshine. But for a meek fair-faced man, with a nervous desire to do  well, a very poor opinion of his own merits, and a diffident, not to say  depressed manner, the world is apt to be a hard battle-ground.</p>
<p>Mr. Burkham sometimes found himself well-nigh  beaten in the cruel strife; and at such times, in the dead silence of the  night, with mortal agonies, and writhings as of Pythoness upon tripod, Mr.  Burkham gave himself up to the composition of a farce, adapted, not from the  French, but from his memories of Wright and Bedford in the jovial old student  days, when the pit of the Adelphi Theatre had been the pleasant resort of his  evenings. He could no longer afford the luxury of theatrical entertainments,  except when provided with a free admission. But from the hazy reminiscences  floating in his poor tired brain he concocted little pieces which he fondly  hoped might win him money and fame.</p>
<p>With much effort and interest he contrived to get  himself elected a Ragamuffin; believing that to be a Ragmuffin was to secure a  position as a dramatic writer. But with one or two fortunate exceptions, his  pieces were refused. The managers would not have the poor little feeble  phantasmagoria of bygone fun, even supported by the whole clan of Ragamuffins.  So Mr. Burkham had gradually melted into the dimness of Bloomsbury, and haunted  the club-room of the Ragamuffins no more.</p>
<p>A hansom carried Valentine Hawkehurst swiftly to  these regions of Bloomsbury. It was no time for the saving of cab-hire. The  soldier of fortune thought no longer of his nest-eggs &mdash; his Unitas Bank  deposit-notes. He was fighting with time and with death; foes dire and  dreadful, against whose encroachments the sturdiest of mortal warriors can make  but a feeble stand. He found the dingy-looking house in the dingy-looking  street; and the humble drudge who opened the door informed him that Mr. Burkham  was at home, and ushered him into a darksome and dreary surgery at the back of  the house, where a phrenological head, considerably the worse for London smoke,  surmounted a dingy bookcase filled with the dingiest of books. A table, upon  which were a blotting-book and inkstand, and two shabby horsehair chairs,  composed the rest of the furniture. Valentine sent his card to the surgeon, and  seated himself on one of the horsehair chairs, to await that gentleman&rsquo;s  appearance.</p>
<p>He came after a brief delay, which seemed long to  his visitor. He came from regions in the back of the house, rubbing his hands,  which seemed to have been newly washed, and the odour of senna and aloes hung  about his garments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if you remember my name, Mr. Burkham,&rdquo;  said Valentine; &ldquo;but you and I are members of the same club, and that a club  among the members of which considerable good feeling prevails. I come to ask a  favour&rdquo; &mdash; Mr. Burkham winced, for this sounded like genteel begging, and for  genteel beggars this struggling surgeon had no spare cash&mdash; &ldquo;which it will  scarcely cause you a moment&rsquo;s thought to grant. I am in great distress&rdquo; &mdash; Mr.  Burkham winced again, for this sounded still more like begging&mdash; &ldquo;mental  distress&rdquo; &mdash; Mr. Burkham gave a little sigh of relief&mdash; &ldquo;and I come to you for  advice.&rdquo; Mr. Burkham gave a more profound sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can assure you that my best advice is at your  command,&rdquo; he said, seating himself, and motioning to his visitor to be seated.  &ldquo;I am beginning to remember your face amongst the members of the club, though  the name on your card did not strike me as familiar. You see, I have never been  able to afford much time for relaxation at the Ragamuffins&rsquo;, though I assure  you I found the agreeable conversation there, the literary <em>on dits</em>, and so on, a very great relief. But my own little efforts  in the dramatic line were not successful, and I found myself compelled to  devote myself more to my profession. And now I have said quite enough about  myself; let me hear how I can be useful to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, let me ask you a question. Do  you know anything of a certain Dr. Doddleson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Plantagenet Square?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; of Plantagenet Square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not much. I have heard him called Dowager  Doddleson; and I believe he is very popular among hypochondriac old ladies who  have more money than they know what to do with, and very little common sense to  regulate their disposal of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Dr. Doddleson a man to whom you would intrust  the life of your dearest friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most emphatically no!&rdquo; cried the surgeon, growing  red with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mr. Burkham; my dearest friend, a young  lady &mdash; well, in plain truth, the woman who was to have been my wife, and whom I  love as it is not the lot of every plighted wife to be loved &mdash; this dear girl  has been wasting away for the last two or three months under the influence of  an inscrutable malady, and Dr. Doddleson is the only man called to attend her  in all that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mistake!&rdquo; said Mr. Burkham, gravely; &ldquo;a very  great mistake! Dr. Doddleson lives in a fine square, and drives a fine  carriage, and has a reputation amongst the class I have spoken of; but he is  about the last man I would consult as to the health of any one dear to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is precisely the opinion which I formed after  ten minutes&rsquo; conversation with him. Now, what I want from you, Mr. Burkham, is  the name and address of the man to whom I can intrust this dear girl&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see. There are so many men, you know, and  great men. Is it a case of consumption?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heart-disease, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; there is no organic disease. It is a languor &mdash;  a wasting away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burkham suggested other diseases whereof the  outward sign was languor and wasting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Valentine; &ldquo;according to Dr.  Doddleson there is actually no disease &mdash; nothing but this extreme prostration &mdash;  this gradual vanishing of vital power. And now I come to another point upon  which I want your advice. It has been suggested that this constitutional  weakness may be inherited; and here I think you can help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You attended the lady&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried Mr. Burkham, delighted. &ldquo;This is  really interesting. In what year did I attend this gentleman? If you will allow  me, I will refer to some of my old case-books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew out a clumsy drawer in the clumsy table, in  order to hunt for old memoranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not quite certain as to the year,&rdquo; answered  Valentine; &ldquo;but it was more than ten years ago. The gentleman died close by  here, in Fitzgeorge Street. His name was Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burkham had drawn out the drawer to its  farthest extent. As Valentine pronounced this name, he let it drop to the  ground with a crash, and sat, statue-like, staring at the speaker. All other  names given to mortal man he might forget; but this one never. Valentine saw  the sudden horror in his face, before he could recompose his features into  something of their conventional aspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, looking down at the fallen drawer  with its scattered papers and case-books, &ldquo;yes, I have some recollection of the  name of Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some very strange and agitating recollection it  would seem by your manner, Mr. Burkham,&rdquo; said Valentine, at once assured that  there was something more than common in the surgeon&rsquo;s look and gesture; and  determined to fathom the mystery, let it be what it might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear no,&rdquo; said the surgeon nervously; &ldquo;I was not  agitated, only surprised. It was surprising to me to hear the name of a patient  so long forgotten. And so the lady to whom you are engaged is a daughter of Mr.  Halliday&rsquo;s? The wife &mdash; Mrs. Halliday &mdash; is still living, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but the lady who was then Mrs. Halliday is  now Mrs. Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; he married her,&rdquo; said Mr. Burkham.  &ldquo;Yes; I remember hearing of the marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had tried in vain to recover his old composure.  He was white to the lips, and his hand shook as he tried to arrange his  scattered papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; thought Valentine. &ldquo;Mrs.  Sheldon talked of this man&rsquo;s inexperience. Can it be that his incompetency lost  the life of his patient, and that he knows it was so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Halliday is now Mrs. Sheldon,&rdquo; repeated the  surgeon, in a feeble manner. &ldquo;Yes, I remember; and Mr. Sheldon &mdash; the dentist,  who at that time resided in Fitzgeorge Street &mdash; is he still living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is still living. It was he who called in Dr.  Doddleson to attend upon Miss Halliday. As her stepfather, he has some amount  of authority, you see; not legal authority &mdash; for my dear girl is of age &mdash; but  social authority. He called in Doddleson, and appears to place confidence in  him; and as he is something of a medical man himself, and pretends to  understand Miss Halliday&rsquo;s case thoroughly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Mr. Burkham, suddenly abandoning all  pretence of calmness. &ldquo;Has he &mdash; Sheldon &mdash; any interest in his stepdaughter&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, certainly not. All her father&rsquo;s money went to  him upon his marriage with her mother. He can gain nothing by her death; on the  contrary, he may lose a good deal, for she is the heir-at-law to a large  fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if she dies, that fortune will go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know where it will go,&rdquo; Valentine  answered carelessly: he thought the subject was altogether beside the question  of Mr. Burkham&rsquo;s agitation, and it was the cause of that agitation which he was  anxious to discover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mr. Sheldon can gain by his stepdaughter&rsquo;s  death, fear him!&rdquo; exclaimed the surgeon, with sudden passion; &ldquo;fear him as you  would fear death itself &mdash; worse than death, for death is neither so stealthy  nor so treacherous as he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in Heaven&rsquo;s name do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That which I thought my lips would never utter to  mortal hearing &mdash; that which I dare not publicly proclaim, at the hazard of  taking the bread out of the mouths of my wife and children. I have kept this  hateful secret for eleven years &mdash; through many a sleepless night and dreary  day. I will tell it to you; for if there is another life in peril, that life  shall be lost through no cowardice of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What secret?&rdquo; cried Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The secret of that poor fellow&rsquo;s death. My God! I  can remember the clasp of his hand, and the friendly look of his eyes, the day  before he died. He was poisoned by Philip Sheldon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be mad!&rdquo; gasped Valentine, in a faint  voice.</p>
<p>For one moment of astonishment and incredulity he  thought this man must needs be a fool or a lunatic, so wildly improbable did  the accusation seem. But in the next instant the curtain was lifted, and he  knew that Philip Sheldon was a villain, and knew that he had never wholly  trusted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never until to-day have I told this secret,&rdquo; said  the surgeon; &ldquo;not even to my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; answered Valentine, in the same  faint voice; &ldquo;with all my heart, I thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, the curtain was lifted. This mysterious illness,  this slow silent decay of bloom and beauty, by a process inscrutable as the  devilry of medieval poisoner or Hecate-serving witch &mdash; this was murder. Murder!  The disease, which had hitherto been nameless, had found its name at last. It  was all clear now. Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s anxiety; the selection of an utterly  incompetent adviser; certain looks and tones that had for a moment mystified  him, and had been forgotten in the next, came back to him with a strange  distinctness, with all their hidden meaning made clear and plain as the broad  light of day.</p>
<p>But the motive? What motive could prompt the slow  destruction of that innocent life? A fortune was at stake, it is true; but that  fortune, as Valentine understood the business, depended on the life of  Charlotte Halliday. Beyond this point he had never looked. In all his  consideration of the circumstances relating to the Haygarthian estate, he had  never thought of what might happen in the event of Charlotte&rsquo;s decease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a diabolical mystery,&rdquo; he said to himself.  &ldquo;There can be no motive &mdash; <em>none</em>. To  destroy Thomas Halliday was to clear his way to fortune; to destroy Charlotte  is to destroy his chance of fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he remembered the dark speeches of George  Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! and this was what he meant, as plainly as  he dared tell me! He did tell me that his brother was an unutterable scoundrel;  and I turned a deaf ear to his warning, because it suited my own interest to  believe that villain. For her dear sake I believed him. I would have believed  in Beelzebub, if he had promised me her dear hand. And I let myself be duped by  the lying promise, and left my darling in the power of Beelzebub!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thoughts followed each other swift as lightning  through his overwrought brain. It seemed but a moment that he had been sitting  with his clenched hands pressed against his forehead, when he turned suddenly  upon the surgeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, help me, guide me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You  have struck a blow that has numbed my senses. What am I to do? My future wife  is in that man&rsquo;s keeping &mdash; dying, as I believe. How am I to save her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you. You may take the cleverest man  in London to see her; but it is a question if that man will perceive the danger  so clearly as to take prompt measures. In these cases there is always room for  doubt; and a man would rather doubt his own perceptions than believe the  hellish truth. It is by this natural hesitation so many lives are lost. While  the doctor deliberates, the patient dies. And then, if the secret of the death  transpires &mdash; by circumstantial evidence, perhaps, which never came to the  doctor&rsquo;s knowledge, &mdash; there is a public outcry. The doctor&rsquo;s practice is  ruined, and his heart broken. The outcry would have been still louder if he had  told the truth in time to save the patient, and had not been able to prove his  words. You think me a coward and a scoundrel because I dared not utter my  suspicion when I saw Mr. Halliday dying. While it was only a suspicion it would  have been certain ruin for me to give utterance to it. The day came when it was  almost a conviction. I went back to that man Sheldon&rsquo;s house, determined to  insist upon the calling in of a physician who would have made that conviction  certainty. My resolution came too late. It is possible that Sheldon had  perceived my suspicions, and had hastened matters. My patient was dead before I  reached the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I to save her?&rdquo; repeated Valentine, with  the same helpless manner. He could not bring himself to consider Tom Halliday&rsquo;s  death. The subject was too far away from him &mdash; remote as the dim shadows of  departed centuries. In all the universe there were but two figures standing out  in lurid brightness against the dense night of chaos &mdash; a helpless girl held in  the clutches of a secret assassin; and it was his work to rescue her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Tell me what I am to  do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What it may be wisest to do I cannot tell you,&rdquo;  answered Mr. Burkham, almost as helplessly as the other had asked the question.  &ldquo;I can give you the name of the best man to get to the bottom of such a case &mdash;  a man who gave evidence on the Fryar trial &mdash; Jedd. You have heard of Jedd, I  daresay. You had better go straight to Jedd, and take him down with you to Miss  Halliday. His very name will frighten Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go at once. Stay &mdash; the address! Where am I  to find Dr. Jedd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Burlington Row. But there is one thing to be  considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The interference of Jedd may only make that man  desperate. He may hasten matters now as he hastened matters before. If you had  seen his coolness at that time; if you had seen him, as I saw him, standing by  that poor fellow&rsquo;s deathbed, comforting him &mdash; yes, with friendly speeches &mdash;  laughing and joking, watching the agonising pain and the miserable sickness,  and all the dreary wretchedness of such a death, and <em>never</em> swerving from his work; if you had seen him, you would  understand why I am afraid to advise you. That man was as desperate as he was  cool when he murdered his friend. He will be more reckless this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he has reached a higher stage in the science  of murder. The symptoms of that poor Yorkshireman were the symptoms of  arsenical poisoning; the symptoms of which you have told me to-day denote a  vegetable poison. <em>That</em> affords very  vague diagnosis, and leaves no trace. That was the agent which enabled the  Borgias to decimate Rome. It is older than classic Greece, and simple as <em>a b c</em>, and will remain so until the  medical expert is a recognized officer of the law, the faithful guardian of the  bed over which the suspected poisoner loiters &mdash; past-master of the science in  which the murderer is rarely more than an experimentalist, and protected from  all the hazards of plain speaking by the nature of his office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heaven, how am I to save her?&rdquo; exclaimed  Valentine. He could not contemplate the subject in its broad social aspect; he  could only think of this one dear life at stake. &ldquo;To send this Dr. Jedd might  be to hasten her death; to send a less efficient man would be mere  childishness. WHAT shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked despairingly at the surgeon, and in that  one glance perceived what a frail reed this was upon which he was leaning. And  then, like the sudden gleam of lightning, a name flashed across his mind, &mdash;  George Sheldon, the lawyer, the schemer, the man who of all the world best knew  this vile enemy and assassin against whom he was matched; he it was of whom  counsel should be asked in this crisis. Once perceiving this, Valentine was  prompt to act. It was the first flash of light in the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to stand by me in this, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he  asked Mr. Burkham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart and soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Then you must go to Dr. Jedd instantly. Tell  him all you know &mdash; Tom Halliday&rsquo;s death; the symptoms of Charlotte&rsquo;s decline,  as you have heard them from me &mdash; <em>everything</em>;  and let him hold himself in readiness to start for Hastings directly he hears  from or sees me. I am going to a man who of all men can tell me how to deal  with Philip Sheldon. I shall try to be in Burlington Row in an hour from this  time; but in any case you will wait there till I come. I suppose, in a  desperate case like this, Dr. Jedd will put aside all less urgent work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust to you to secure his sympathy,&rdquo; said  Valentine.</p>
<p>He was in the darksome entrance-hall by this time.  Mr. Burkham followed, and opened the door for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have no fear of me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men shook hands with a grip significant as  masonic sign-manual. It meant on the one part hearty co-operation, on the other  implicit confidence. In the next moment Valentine sprang into the cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;King&rsquo;s Road &mdash; entrance to Gray&rsquo;s Inn, and drive  like mad!&rdquo; he shouted to the driver. The hansom rattled across the stones,  dashed round corners, struck consternation to scudding children in pinafores,  all but annihilated more than one perambulator, and in less than ten minutes  after leaving Mr. Burkham&rsquo;s door, ground against the kerbstone before the  little gate of Gray&rsquo;s Inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant that George Sheldon may be at home!&rdquo;  Valentine said to himself, as he hurried towards that gentleman&rsquo;s office.  George Sheldon was at home. In this fight against time, Mr. Hawkehurst had so  far found the odds in his favour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; exclaimed the lawyer, looking up  from his desk, as Valentine appeared on the threshold of the door, pale and  breathless; &ldquo;to what do I owe the unusual honour of a visit from Mr.  Hawkehurst? I thought that rising <em>litt&eacute;rateur</em> had cut all old acquaintances, and gone in for the upper circles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come to you on a matter of life and death,  George Sheldon,&rdquo; said Valentine; &ldquo;this is no time to talk of why I haven&rsquo;t been  to you before. When you and I last met, you advised me to beware of your  brother Philip. It wasn&rsquo;t the first, or the second, or the third time that you  so warned me. And now speak out like an honest man, and tell me what you meant  by that warning? For God&rsquo;s sake, speak plainly this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot afford to speak more plainly than I have  spoken half a dozen times already. I told you to beware of my brother Phil, and  I meant that warning in its fullest significance. If you had chosen to take my  advice, you would have placed Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s fortune, and Charlotte  Halliday herself, beyond his power, by an immediate marriage. You didn&rsquo;t choose  to do that, and there was an end of the matter. I have been a heavy loser by  your pigheaded obstinacy; and I dare say before you and Phil Sheldon have done  with each other, you too will find yourself a loser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help me, yes!&rdquo; cried Valentine, with a groan;  &ldquo;I stand to make the heaviest loss that was ever made by man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; exclaimed George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you what you meant when you warned me  against your own brother? Shall I tell you why you so warned me? You know that  Philip Sheldon murdered Tom Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the secret is out. You knew it; how or when  you discovered it I cannot tell. You knew of that one hellish crime, and would  have prevented the commission of a second murder. You should have spoken more  plainly. To know what you knew, and to confine yourself to cautious hints and  vague suggestions, as you did, was to have part in that devilish work. If  Charlotte Halliday dies, her blood be upon your head &mdash; upon yours &mdash; as well as  upon his!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man had risen in his passion, and stood  before George Sheldon with uplifted hands, and eyes that flashed angry lightnings.  It seemed almost as if he would have called down the Divine vengeance upon this  man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Charlotte Halliday dies!&rdquo; repeated George, in a  horror-stricken whisper; &ldquo;why should you suggest such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she is dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause. Valentine flung himself  passionately upon the chair from which he had just risen, with his back to  George Sheldon, and his face bent over the back of the chair. The lawyer sat  looking straight before him, with a ghastly countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him he meant <em>this</em>,&rdquo; he said to himself, in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;I told him in this  office not six months ago. Powers of hell, what a villain he is! And there are  people who do not believe there is a devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments Valentine gave free vent to his  passion of grief. These tears of rage, of agony the most supreme, were the  first he had shed since he had bent his face over Charlotte&rsquo;s soft brown hair,  to hide the evidence of his sorrow. When he had dashed these bitter drops away  from his burning eyes, he turned to confront George Sheldon, pale as death, but  very calm. And after this he gave way no more to his passion. He was matched  against Time, of all enemies the most pitiless and unrelenting, and every  minute wasted was a point scored by his foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want your help, George Sheldon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If  you have ever been sorry that you made no effort to save Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s  father, prove yourself his friend by trying to save her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>If</em> I  have ever been sorry!&rdquo; echoed the lawyer. &ldquo;Why, my miserable dreams have never been  free from the horror of that man&rsquo;s face. You don&rsquo;t know what it is &mdash; murder!  Nobody knows who hasn&rsquo;t been concerned in it. You read of murders in your  newspapers. A shot B, or C poisoned D, and so on, all through the letters of  the alphabet, with a fresh batch for every Sunday; but it never comes home to  you. You think of the horror of it in a shadowy kind of way, as you might think  of having a snake twisted round your waist and legs, like that blessed man and  boys one never sees the last of. But if you were to look at that plaster cast  all your life, you couldn&rsquo;t realize ten per cent of the horror you&rsquo;d feel if  the snake was <em>there</em>, alive, crushing  your bones, and hissing in your ear. I have been face to face with murder,  Valentine Hawkehurst; and if I were to live a century, I should never forget  what I felt when I stood by Tom Halliday&rsquo;s deathbed, and it flashed upon me,  all at once, that my brother Phil was poisoning him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you did not try to save him &mdash; your friend?&rdquo;  cried Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; replied the other, in a strange  slow way, &ldquo;it was too late to save him: I knew that, and &mdash; I held my tongue.  What could I do? Against my own brother! That sort of thing in a family is ruin  for every one! Do you think anybody would have brought their business to me  after my brother had stood in the Old Bailey dock to take his trial for murder?  No; my only course was to keep my own counsel, and I kept it. Phil made  eighteen thousand pounds by his marriage with poor Tom&rsquo;s widow, and a paltry  hundred or two is all <em>I</em> ever touched  of that money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you <em>could</em> touch that money?&rdquo; cried Valentine, aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money carries no infection. Did you ever ask any  questions about the money you won at German gaming-tables. I dare say some of  your napoleons and ten-thaler notes could have told queer stories if they had  been able to talk. Taking Phil&rsquo;s money has never weighed upon my conscience.  I&rsquo;m not very inquisitive about the antecedents of a five-pound note; but I&rsquo;ll  tell you what it is, Hawkehurst, I&rsquo;d give all I have, and all I ever hope to  have, and would go out and sweep a crossing to-morrow, if I could get Tom  Halliday&rsquo;s face out of my mind, with the look that he turned upon me the last  time I saw him. &lsquo;Ah, George,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;in illness a man feels the comfort of being  among friends!&rsquo; And he took my hand and squeezed it, in his old hearty way. We  had been boys together, Hawkehurst, birds-nesting in Hyley Woods; on the same  side in our Barlingford cricket-matches. And I shook his hand, and went away,  and left him to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here Mr. Sheldon of Gray&rsquo;s Inn, the Sheldon who  was in with the money-lenders, sharpest of legal prestigitators, most ruthless  of opponents, most unscrupulous of allies, buried his face in a flaming  bandanna, and fairly sobbed aloud. When the passion had passed, he got up and  walked hastily to the window, more ashamed of this one touch of honest emotion  than of all the falsehoods and chicaneries of his career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I could have been such an ass,&rdquo; he  muttered sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not hope that you could feel so deeply,&rdquo;  answered Valentine. &ldquo;And now help me to save the only child of your ill-fated  friend. I am sure that you can help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without waiting to be questioned, Valentine related  the circumstances of
  Charlotte&rsquo;s illness, and of his interview with Mr. Burkham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not even know that the poor girl was ill,&rdquo;  said George Sheldon. &ldquo;I have not seen Phil for months. He came here one day,  and I gave him a bit of my mind. I told him if he tried to harm her I&rsquo;d let the  light in upon him and his doings. And I&rsquo;ll keep my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his motive? What, in the name of Heaven, can  be his motive for taking her innocent life? He knows of the Haygarth estate,  and must hope to profit by her fortune if she lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and to secure the whole of that fortune if  she dies. Her death would make her mother sole heir to that estate, and the  mother is the merest tool in his hands. He may even have induced Charlotte to  make a will in his favour, so that he himself may stand in her shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would not have made a will without telling me  of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that. My brother Phil can do  anything. It would be as easy for him to persuade her to maintain secrecy about  the transaction as to persuade her to make the will. Do you suppose <em>he</em> shrinks from multiplying lies and  forgeries and hypocrisies? Do you suppose anything in that small way comes  amiss to the man who has once brought his mind to murder? Why, look at the  Scotch play of that fellow Shakespeare&rsquo;s. At the beginning, your Macbeth is a  respectable trustworthy sort of person, anxious to get on in life, and so on,  and that&rsquo;s all; but no sooner has he made an end of poor old Duncan, than he  lays about him right and left &mdash; Banquo, Fleance, anybody and everybody that  happens to be in his way. It was lucky for that Tartar of a wife of his that <em>she</em> hook&rsquo;d it, or he&rsquo;d soon have put a  stop to her sleep-walking. There&rsquo;s no such wide difference between a man and a  tiger, after all. The tiger&rsquo;s a decent fellow enough till he has tasted human  blood; but when once he <em>has</em>, Lord  save the country-side from the jaws of the man-eater!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake let us waste no time in talk!&rdquo;  Valentine cried, impetuously. &ldquo;I am to meet Burkham in Burlington Row directly  I have got your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see Dr. Jedd, and take him down to Hastings, if  possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Jedd&rsquo;s appearance would give Phil the  office. Jedd gave evidence on the Fryar trial, and must be a marked man to him.  All Jedd can tell you is that Charlotte is being poisoned. You know that  already. Of course she&rsquo;ll want medical treatment, and so on, to bring her  round; but she can&rsquo;t get that under my brother&rsquo;s roof. What you have to do is  to get her away from that house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know how ill she is. I doubt if she  could bear the removal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything is better than to remain. <em>That</em> is certain death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your brother would surely dispute her  removal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would, and oppose it inch by inch. We must get  him away, before we attempt to remove her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will find the means for that. I know something  of his business relations, and can invent some false cry for luring him off the  trail. We <em>must</em> get him away. The poor  girl was not in actual danger when you left her, was she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank God, there was no appearance of  immediate danger. But she was very ill. And that man holds her life in his  hand. He knows that I have come to London in search of a doctor. What if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep yourself quiet, Hawkehurst. He will not  hasten her death unless he is desperate; for a death occurring immediately after  your first expression of alarm would seem sudden. He&rsquo;ll avoid any appearance of  suddenness, if he can, depend upon it. The first thing is to get him away. But  the question is, how to do it? There must be a bait. What bait? Don&rsquo;t talk to  me, Hawkehurst. Let me think it out, if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer leaned his elbows on the table, and  abandoned himself to profound cogitation, with his forehead supported by his  clenched hands. Valentine waited patiently while he thus cogitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go down to Phil&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; he said at last,  &ldquo;and ferret out some of his secrets. Nothing but stock-exchange business, of an  important character, would induce him to leave Charlotte Halliday. But if I can  telegraph such a message as will bring him to town, I&rsquo;ll do it. Leave all that  to me. And now, what about your work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am at a loss what to do, if I am not to take Dr.  Jedd to Harold&rsquo;s
  Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him to St. Leonards; and if I get my brother  out of the way, you can have Charlotte conveyed to an hotel in St. Leonard&rsquo;s,  where she can stop till she picks up strength enough to come to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think her mother will consent to her  removal?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I think you will be such an idiot as to ask for  her consent?&rdquo; cried George Sheldon impatiently. &ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s wife is so weak a  fool, that the chances are she&rsquo;d insist on her daughter stopping quietly, to be  poisoned. No; you must get Mrs. Sheldon out of the way somehow. Send her to  look at the shops, or to bathe, or to pick up shells on the beach, or anything  else equally inane. She&rsquo;s easy enough to deal with. There&rsquo;s that young woman,  Paget&rsquo;s daughter, with them still, I suppose? Yes. Very well, then, you and she  can get Charlotte away between you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for me to take those two girls to an hotel &mdash;  the chance of scandal, of wonder, of inquiry? There ought to be some other  person &mdash; some nurse. Stay, there&rsquo;s Nancy Woolper &mdash; the very woman! My darling  has told me of that old woman&rsquo;s affectionate anxiety about her health &mdash; an  anxiety which was singularly intense, it seemed to Lotta. Good God! do you  think she, Nancy Woolper, could have suspected the cause of Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s  death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say she did. She was in the house when he  died, and nursed him all through his illness. She&rsquo;s a clever old woman. Yes,  you might take her down with you; I think she would be of use in getting  Charlotte away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take her, if she will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure of that; our north-country folks  have stiffish notions about fidelity to old masters, and that kind of thing.  Nancy Woolper nursed my brother Phil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she knows or suspects the fate of Charlotte&rsquo;s  father, she will try to save Charlotte,&rdquo; said Valentine, with conviction. &ldquo;And  now, good bye! I trust to you for getting your brother out of the way, George  Sheldon; remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out his hand; the lawyer took it with a  muscular grip, which, on this occasion, meant something more than that base  coin of jolly good fellowship which so often passes current for friendship&rsquo;s  virgin gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may trust me,&rdquo; George Sheldon said gravely.  &ldquo;Stop a moment, though; I have a proposition to make. If my brother Philip has  induced that girl to make a will, as it is my belief he has, we must counter  him. Come down with me to Doctors&rsquo; Commons. You&rsquo;ve a cab? Yes; the business  won&rsquo;t take half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A special licence for your marriage with Charlotte  Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; her marriage invalidates her will, if she has  made one, and does away with Phil&rsquo;s motive. Come along; we&rsquo;ll get the licence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the delay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly half an hour. Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer dashed out of his office. &ldquo;At home in an  hour,&rdquo; he shouted to the clerk, and then ran downstairs, followed closely by  Valentine, and did not cease running until he was in the King&rsquo;s Road, where the  cab was waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Newgate Street and Warwick Lane to Doctors&rsquo;  Commons!&rdquo; he cried to the cabman; and Valentine was fain to take his seat in  the cab without further remonstrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo; he began, as the cabman drove  away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. It&rsquo;s all right; you&rsquo;ll put the licence in  your pocket, and call at the church nearest which you hang out, Edgware Road  way, give notice of the marriage, and so on; and as soon as Charlotte can bear  the journey, bring her to London and marry her. I told you your course six  months ago. Your obstinacy has caused the hazard of that young woman&rsquo;s life.  Don&rsquo;t let us have a second edition of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be governed by your advice,&rdquo; answered  Valentine, submissively.&ldquo;It is the delay that tortures me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The delay was indeed torture to him. Everything and  everybody in Doctors&rsquo; Commons seemed the very incarnation of slowness. The  hansom cab might tear and grind the pavement, the hansom cabman might swear  until even monster waggons swerved aside to give him passage; but neither  tearing nor swearing could move the incarnate stolidity of Doctors&rsquo; Commons.  When he left that quaint sanctuary of old usages, he carried with him the  Archbishop of Canterbury&rsquo;s benign permission for his union with Charlotte  Halliday. But he knew not whether it was only a morsel of waste paper which he  carried in his pocket; and whether there might not ere long be need of a  ghastlier certificate, giving leave and licence for the rendering back of  &ldquo;ashes to ashes, and dust to dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine&rsquo;s first call, after leaving George  Sheldon at the gate of Doctors&rsquo; Commons, was at the head-quarters of the  Ragamuffins. His heart sank as he ran into the bar of the hostelry to ask for  the telegram which might be waiting for him.</p>
<p>Happily there was no telegram. To find no tidings  of a change for the worse seemed to him almost equivalent to hearing of a  change for the better. What had he not feared after his interview with the  surgeon of Bloomsbury!</p>
<p>From Covent Garden the hansom bowled swiftly to  Burlington Row. Here Valentine found Mr. Burkham, pale and anxious, waiting in a  little den of a third room, on the ground-floor &mdash; a ghastly little room, hung  with anatomical plates, and with some wax preparations in jars, on the  mantelpiece, by way of ornament. To them presently came Dr. Jedd, as lively and  business-like as if Miss Halliday&rsquo;s case had been a question of taking out a  double-tooth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very sad!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;these vegetable poisons &mdash;  hands of unscrupulous man. Very interesting article in the <em>Medical Quarterly</em> &mdash; speculative analysis of the science of  toxicology as known to the ancients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will come down to Harold&rsquo;s Hill at once, sir?&rdquo;  said Valentine, imploringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes; your friend here, Mr. Burkham, has  persuaded me to do so, though I need hardly tell you that such a journey will  be to the last degree inconvenient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an affair of life and death,&rdquo; faltered the  young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, my dear sir. But then, you see, I have  half-a-dozen other affairs of life and death on my hands at this moment.  However, I have promised. My consultations will be over in half an hour; I have  a round of visits after that, and by &mdash; well, say by the five o&rsquo;clock express, I  will go to St. Leonards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The delay will be very long,&rdquo; said Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It cannot be done sooner. I ought to go down to  Hertfordshire this evening &mdash; most interesting case &mdash; carbuncle &mdash; three  operations in three consecutive weeks &mdash; Swain as operator. At five o&rsquo;clock I  shall be at the London Bridge station. Until then, gentlemen, good day. Lawson,  the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Jedd left his visitors to follow the  respectable white-cravatted butler, and darted back to his consulting-room.</p>
<p>Mr. Burkham and Valentine walked slowly up and down  Burlington Row before the latter returned to his cab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you heartily for your help,&rdquo; said  Valentine to the surgeon; &ldquo;and I believe, with God&rsquo;s grace, we shall save this  dear girl&rsquo;s life. It was the hand of Providence that guided me to you this  morning. I can but believe the same hand will guide me to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this they parted. Valentine told his cabman to  drive to the Edgware Road; and in one of the churches of the immediate  neighbourhood of that thoroughfare he gave notice of his intention to enter the  bonds of holy matrimony. He had some difficulty in arranging matters with the  clerk, whom he saw in his private abode and non-official guise. That  functionary was scarcely able to grasp the idea of an intending Benedick who  would not state positively when he wanted to be married. Happily, however, the  administration of half-a-sovereign considerably brightened the clerk&rsquo;s  perceptions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you want,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Young lady a  invalid, which she wants to leave her home as she finds uncomfortable, she  being over twenty-one years of age and her own mistress. It&rsquo;s what you may call  a runaway match, although the parties ain&rsquo;t beholden to any one, in a manner of  speaking. <em>I</em> understand. You give me  half an hour&rsquo;s notice any morning within the legal hours, and I&rsquo;ll have one of  our young curates ready for you as soon as you&rsquo;re ready for them; and have you  and the young lady tied up tight enough before you know where you are. We ain&rsquo;t  very long over <em>our</em> marriages, unless  it is something out of the common way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk&rsquo;s familiarity was more good-natured than  flattering to the applicant&rsquo;s self-esteem; but Valentine was in no mood to  object to this easy-going treatment of the affair. He promised to give the  clerk the required notice; and having arranged everything in strictly legal  manner, hurried back to his cab, and directed the man to drive to the Lawn.</p>
<p>It was now three o&rsquo;clock. At five he was to meet  Dr. Jedd at the station.
  He had two hours for his interview with Nancy Woolper, and his drive from
  Bayswater to London Bridge.</p>
<p>He had tasted nothing since daybreak; but the  necessity to eat and drink never occurred to him. He was dimly conscious of  feeling sick and faint, but the reason of this sickness and faintness did not  enter into his thoughts. He took off his hat, and leant his head back against  the cushion of the hansom as that vehicle rattled across the squares of  Paddington. The summer day, the waving of green trees in those suburban  squares; the busy life and motion of the world through which he went, mixed  themselves into one jarring whirl of light and colour, noise and motion. He  found himself wondering how long it was since he left Harold&rsquo;s Hill. Between  the summer morning in which he had walked along the dusty high-road, with  fields of ripening corn upon his left, and all the broad blue sea upon his  right, and the summer afternoon in which he drove in a jingling cab through the  noisy streets and squares of Bayswater, there seemed to him a gulf so wide,  that his tried brain shrank from scanning it.</p>
<p>He struggled with this feeling of helplessness and  bewilderment, and overcame it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me remember what I have to do,&rdquo; he said to  himself; &ldquo;and let me keep my wits about me till that is done.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
  Phoenicians Are Rising</h2>
<p>While Mr. Hawkehurst arranged his affairs with the  clerk of St. Matthias-in-the-fields, in the parish of Marylebone, George  Sheldon sat in his brother&rsquo;s office writing a letter to that distinguished  stockbroker. The pretext of writing a letter was the simplest pretext for being  alone in his brother&rsquo;s room; and to be alone in Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s room was the  first step in the business which George had to do.</p>
<p>The room was distractingly neat, and as handsomely  furnished as it is possible for an office to be within the closest official  limits. A Spanish mahogany desk with a cylinder cover, and innumerable drawers  fitted with invisible Bramah locks, occupied the centre of the room; and four  ponderous Spanish mahogany chairs, with padded backs, and seats covered with  crimson morocco, were primly ranged against the wall. Upon the mantelpiece  ticked a skeleton clock; above which there hung the sternest and grimmest of  almanacks, on either whereof were fastened divers lists and calendars of awful  character, affected by gentlemen on &rsquo;Change.</p>
<p>Before penetrating to this innermost and sacred  chamber, George Sheldon wasted some little time in agreeable gossip with a  gentleman whom he found yawning over the <em>Times</em> newspaper in an outer and less richly furnished apartment. This gentleman was  Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s clerk, the younger son of a rich Yorkshire farmer, who had  come to London with the intention of making his fortune on the Stock Exchange,  and whose father had paid a considerable sum in order to obtain for this young  man the privilege of reading the Times in Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s office, and picking up  whatever knowledge might be obtained from the business transactions of his  employer.</p>
<p>The career of Philip Sheldon had been watched with  some interest by his fellow-townsmen of Barlingford. They had seen him leave  that town with a few hundreds in his pocket, and they had heard of him twelve  years afterwards as a prosperous stockbroker, with a handsome house and a handsome  carriage, and the reputation of being one of the sharpest men in the City. The  accounts of him that came to Barlingford were all more or less exaggerated; and  the men who discussed his cleverness and his good luck were apt to forget that  he owed the beginning of his fortunes to Tom Halliday&rsquo;s eighteen thousand  pounds. The one fact that impressed Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s townsmen was the fact that  a Barlingford man had made money on the Stock Exchange; and the one inference  they drew therefrom was the inference that other Barlingford men might do the  same.</p>
<p>Thus it had happened that Mr. Stephen Orcott, of  Plymley Rise farm, near Barlingford, being at a loss what to do with a somewhat  refractory younger son, resolved upon planting his footsteps in the path so victoriously  trodden by Philip Sheldon. He wrote to Philip, asking him to receive the young  man as clerk, assistant, secretary &mdash; anything, with a view to an ultimate  junior partnership; and Philip consented, upon certain conditions. The sum he  demanded was rather a stiff one, as it seemed to Stephen Orcott, but he opined  that such a sum would not have been asked if the advantages had not been  proportionately large. The bargain was therefore concluded, and Mr. Frederick  Orcott came to London. He was a young man of horsey propensities, gifted with a  sublime contempt for any kind of business requiring application or industry,  and with a supreme belief in his own merits.</p>
<p>George Sheldon had known Frederick Orcott as a boy,  and had been in his society some half-dozen times since his coming to London.  He apprehended no difficulty in obtaining from this young gentleman any  information he had the power to afford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do, Orcott?&rdquo; he said, with agreeable  familiarity. &ldquo;My brother Phil not come back yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the other, sulkily. &ldquo;There have been  ever so many people here bothering me about him. Where has he gone? and when  will he be back? and so on. I might as well be some d &mdash;&mdash; d footman, if I&rsquo;m to  sit here answering questions all day. High Wickham races are on to-day, and I  wanted to see Barmaid run before I put my money on her for Goodwood. She was  bred down our way, you see, and I know she&rsquo;s like enough to win the cup, if  she&rsquo;s fit. They don&rsquo;t know much about her this way, either, though she&rsquo;s own  sister to Boots, that won the Chester Cup last year, owing to Topham&rsquo;s being  swindled into letting him off with seven lbs. He ran at the York Spring, you  see, for a twopenny-halfpenny plate, and the boy that rode him pulled his head  half off &mdash; I saw him do it &mdash; and then he won the Chester, and brought his  owners a pot of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This information was not exactly what George  Sheldon wanted, but he planted himself on the hearthrug in an easy attitude,  with his back against the mantelpiece, and appeared much interested in Mr.  Orcott&rsquo;s discourse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything stirring in the City?&rdquo; he asked  presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stirring? No &mdash; nothing stirring but stagnation, as  some fellow said in a play I saw the other night. Barlingford folks say your  brother Philip has made a heap of money on the Stock Exchange; but if he has,  he must have done a good deal more business before I came to him than he has  done lately. I can&rsquo;t see how a man is to develop into a Rothschild out of an  occasional two-and-sixpence per cent on the transfer of some old woman&rsquo;s savings  from railway stock to consols; and that&rsquo;s about the only kind of business I&rsquo;ve  seen much of lately. Of course Phil Sheldon has got irons of his own in the  fire; for he&rsquo;s an uncommonly deep card, you see, that brother of yours, and it  isn&rsquo;t to be expected he&rsquo;ll tell <em>me</em> all he&rsquo;s up to. I know he&rsquo;s up to his eyebrows in companies, but I don&rsquo;t see  how he&rsquo;s to make his fortune out of <em>them</em>,  for limited liability now-a-days seems only another name for unlimited crash.  However, I don&rsquo;t care. It pleased my governor to get me into Sheldon&rsquo;s office,  and it suited my book to come to London; but if the author of my being thinks  I&rsquo;m going to addle my blessed brains with the decline and fall of the money  market, he&rsquo;s a greater fool than I took him for &mdash; and that&rsquo;s saying a great  deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here Mr. Frederick Orcott lapsed into admiring  contemplation of his boots, which were the <em>chefs-d&rsquo;oeuvre</em> of a sporting bootmaker; boots that were of the ring, ringy, and of the corner,  cornery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;and Phil doesn&rsquo;t tell you much  of his affairs, doesn&rsquo;t he? That&rsquo;s rather a bad sign, I should think. Looks as  if he was rather down upon his luck, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no knowing, you see, with that sort  of close fish. He may have made his book for a great haul, and may be keeping  himself quiet till the event comes off. He may be laying on to something with  all his might, you know, on safe information. But there&rsquo;s one thing I know he  stands to lose by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Phoenician Loan. He speculated in the bonds  when they began to go down; and I&rsquo;m blessed if they haven&rsquo;t been dropping ever  since, an eighth a day, as regular as the day comes round. He bought them for  the March account, and has been paying contango since then, and holding on in  hopes of a rise. I don&rsquo;t know whether the purchase was a large one, but I know  he&rsquo;s been uncommonly savage about the drop. He bought on the strength of  private information from the other side of the Channel. The Emperor was putting  his own money into the Phoenician business, and it was the best game out, and  so on. But he seems to have been made a fool of, for once in a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bonds may steady themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they <em>may</em>;  but, on the other hand, they mayn&rsquo;t. There are the Stock Exchange lists, with  Phoenicians ticked off by your brother&rsquo;s own pen. A steady drop, you see. &lsquo;Let  me have a telegram if there&rsquo;s a sudden rise,&rsquo; said Sheldon to me the day he  left London; &lsquo;they&rsquo;ll go up with rush when they do move.&rsquo; But they&rsquo;ve been  moving the other way ever since; and I think if he stayed away till doomsday it  would be pretty much the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;<em>Phoenicians  are rising rapidly. Come back to town.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were the words of the telegraphic despatch  which shaped itself in George Sheldon&rsquo;s brain, as his brother&rsquo;s clerk revealed  the secrets of his employer.</p>
<p>It was found &mdash; the solution of the one great  question as to how Philip
  Sheldon was to be lured away from the bedside of his unconscious victim.
  Here was the bait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I could do it; I knew I could get all I  wanted to know out of this shallow-brained idiot,&rdquo; he said to himself,  triumphantly.</p>
<p>And then he told the shallow-brained idiot that he  thought he would write a line to his brother; and on that pretence went into  Philip&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Here, use his eyes as he might, he could discover  nothing; he could glean no stray scrap of information. The secrets that could  be guarded by concealed Bramah locks and iron safes, with mystic words to be  learned by the man who would open them, Philip Sheldon knew how to protect.  Unhappily for himself, he had been compelled to confide some of his secrets to  human receptacles not to be guarded by Bramah locks or mystic words.</p>
<p>The lawyer did not waste much time in his brother&rsquo;s  office. A very hasty investigation showed him there was nothing to be learned  from those bare walls and that inviolable cylinder-topped desk. He scribbled a  few lines of commonplace at a table by the window, sealed and addressed his  note, and then departed to despatch his telegram, &ldquo;Phoenicians are rising  rapidly,&rdquo; he wrote, and that was all. He signed the despatch Frederick Orcott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phil and Orcott may settle the business between  them,&rdquo; he said to himself, as he forged the Yorkshireman&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;What I have  to do is to get Phil away, and give Hawkehurst a chance of saving Tom  Halliday&rsquo;s daughter; and I shan&rsquo;t stand upon trifles in the doing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having despatched this telegram, George  Sheldon found himself much too restless and excited for ordinary business. He,  so renowned even amongst cool hands for exceptional coolness, was on this  occasion thoroughly unnerved. He dropped into a City tavern, and refreshed  himself with a dram. But, amidst all the bustle and clatter of a crowded bar,  the face of Tom Halliday, haggard and worn with illness, was before his eyes,  and the sound of Tom Halliday&rsquo;s voice was in his ears. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t settle to  anything this afternoon,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run down to Bayswater, and  see whether Hawkehurst has managed matters with Nancy Woolper.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
  The Sortes Virgilian&aelig;</h2>
<p>While George Sheldon was still in the depths of the  City Valentine Hawkehurst arrived at the gothic villa, where he asked to see  Mrs. Woolper. Of the woman herself he knew very little: he had seen her once or  twice when some special mission brought her to the drawing-room; and from  Charlotte he had heard much of her affectionate solicitude. To have been kind  to his Charlotte was the strongest claim to his regard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This woman&rsquo;s help would be of inestimable  service,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;her age, her experience of sickness, her familiarity  with the patient, especially adapt her for the office she will be required to  fill. If Dr. Jedd should order a nurse to watch by the sick-bed, here is the  nurse. If it should prove possible to remove the dear sufferer, here is the  guardian best calculated to protect and attend her removal.&rdquo; That the desperate  step of an immediate marriage would be a wise step Valentine could not doubt,  since it would at once annihilate Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s chances, and destroy his  motive. But in contemplating this desperate step Valentine had to consider the  reputation as well as the safety of his future wife. He was determined that  there should be no opportunity for scandal in the circumstances of his stolen  marriage, no scope for future mischief from the malignity of that baffled  villain to whose schemes their marriage would give the death-blow. He, who from  his cradle had been familiar with the darker side of life, knew how often the  innocent carry a lifelong burden, and perform a perpetual pennance for the sins  or the follies of others. And over his darling&rsquo;s life in the future, should it  please God that he might save her, he would have no shadow cast by imprudence  of his in the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sharp-witted, sharp-tongued Yorkshirewoman  will be the woman of women to protect her,&rdquo; he thought, as he seated himself in  Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s study, whither the prim parlour-maid had ushered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Woolper have just gone upstairs to clean  herself,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;which we are a-having the dining-room and droring-room  carpets up, while the family are away. Would you please to wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot wait very long,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I shall be  obliged if you will tell Mrs. Woolper that I wish to see her on very important  business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The parlour-maid departed, and Valentine was left  to endure the weariness of waiting until Mrs. Woolper should have &ldquo;cleaned  herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s study at Bayswater did not offer much  more to the eye of the investigator than Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s office in the City.  There were the handsomely bound books behind the inviolable plate-glass doors,  and there was the neat writing-table with the machine for weighing letters, and  the large business-like looking blotting-pad, and the ponderous brass-rimmed  inkstand, with no nonsense about it; and yonder, on a clumsy little oak table  with thick legs, appeared the copying machine, with a big black iron lever, and  a massive screw with which to screw all the spontaneous feeling out of every  letter that came beneath its crushing influence.</p>
<p>Up and down this joyless den Valentine Hawkehurst  paced, with the demon of impatience raging in his breast. The July sunshine  blazed hot upon the window, and the voices of croqu&ecirc;t-players in adjacent  gardens rose shrill upon the summer air. And there were girls playing croqu&ecirc;t  while she, his &ldquo;rose of the garden, garden of girls,&rdquo; lay sick unto death! O,  why could he not offer a hecatomb of these common creatures as a substitute for  that one fair spirit?</p>
<p>He looked into the garden &mdash; the prim modern garden,  but a few years reclaimed from that abomination of desolation, the &ldquo;eligible  lot of building land.&rdquo; Across the well-kept lawn there brooded no shadow of  Old-World cedar; no century-old espaliers divided flower and kitchen ground; no  box-edging of the early Hanoverian era bordered the beds of roses and mignonette.  From one boundary-wall to the other there was not a bush old enough to hang an  association upon. The stereotyped bed of flaming yellow calceolaria balanced  the conventional bed of flaming crimson verbena; the lavender heliotrope faced  the scarlet geranium, like the four corners in a quadrille. The garden was the  modern nurserymen&rsquo;s ideal of suburban horticulture, and no more. But to  Valentine this half-acre of smooth lawn and Wimbledon gravel pathway had seemed  fair as those pleasure gardens of Semiramis, at the foot of the Bagistanos  mountain, the fame whereof tempted Alexander to turn aside from the direct  road, during his march from Chelone to the Nysaic horse pastures.</p>
<p>To-day the contemplation of that commonplace garden  gave him direful pain. Should he ever walk there again with his dear love, or  in any other garden upon earth?</p>
<p>And then he thought of fairer gardens, in supernal  regions whither his soul was slow to travel. &ldquo;Not easy is the journey from  earth to the stars,&rdquo; says the sage; and from this young wanderer the stain of  earthly travel had yet to be washed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she is taken from me, shall I ever be pure  enough to follow her?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Will a life that began in such  darkness ever rise to the light which is her natural element? If she is taken,  and I stay behind, and bear my burden patiently in the hope to follow her, will  there not be a gate closed against me in the skies, beyond which I shall see  her, shining among her kindred spirits, in the white robes of perfect innocence?  Ah, my love, my love, as between us on this earth must for ever be a gulf your  pure soul cannot pass, so between us in the skies will rise a barrier to sever  me from your sweet company!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought of probable separation upon earth, of  possible separation in heaven, was too bitter to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not think of these things,&rdquo; he said to  himself; &ldquo;I will not believe in that possibility of this sacrifice. Ah, no! she  will be saved. Against the bright young life the awful fiat has not gone forth.  Providence has been with me to-day. Providence will go with me till the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought how other men had so stood, as he was  standing now, face to face with the great uncertainty, the crisis, the  turning-point &mdash; the pivot on which life itself revolved. The pendulum of the  mighty clock swings solemnly to and fro; with every vibration a moment; with  every moment each man&rsquo;s shrouded fates move another step in their inexorable  progress. And the end? What was the goal towards which those dark relentless  shapes were moving?</p>
<p>He thought of Rousseau, balancing the awful  question of his soul&rsquo;s salvation &mdash; his poor weak soul adrift upon a sea of  doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold yonder tree which faces me, as I sit and  meditate the problem of my destiny &mdash; the destiny of me, Jean Jacques Rousseau, self-conscious  genius, and future regenerator of my age. I pick up a pebble, and poise it  between my fingers before taking my aim. In another moment the question will be  answered. If the pebble hits the tree, I, Jean Jacques, am reserved for  salvation. If I miss &mdash; O awful, overwhelming possibility! &mdash; my name will blaze  upon that dreadful scroll which numbers the damned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happily the tree is bulky, and within but a few  yards of the speculator; and the great enigma of the Calvinistic church is  answered in favour of Madame de Warenne&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;, whose propensities and  proclivities at that period did not very strongly indicate his claim to a place  among the elect.</p>
<p>Valentine remembered the <em>sortes Virgilian&aelig;</em> &mdash; the Wesleyan&rsquo;s drawing of inferences from Bible  texts. Ah, could he not find an answer to the question that was the one thought  of his mind? He would find some answer &mdash; a lying oracle, perhaps. It might be a  voice from heaven, &mdash; some temporary assuagement of this storm of doubt that  raged in his breast. &ldquo;I doubt if Mr. Sheldon owns either a Bible or an  &lsquo;&AElig;neid,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said to himself, as he stopped in his rapid pacing of the room; &ldquo;I  will open the first book I can put my hand upon, and from the first line my eye  falls on will draw an augury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked about the room. Behind the glazed doors  of the mahogany bookcase appeared Hume and Smollett, Scott and Shakespeare; and  conspicuous among these a handsome family Bible. But the glazed doors were  locked. In Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s study there appeared to be no other books than these  few standard works. Yes, on some obscure little shelves, low down in one of the  recesses formed by the projection of the fireplace and the chimney, there were  three rows of large quarto volumes, in dingy dark-green cloth cases.</p>
<p>What these volumes might contain Valentine  Hawkehurst knew not; and the very fact of his ignorance rendered these books  all the more suitable for the purpose of augury. To dip for a sentence into any  of these unknown volumes would be a leap in darkness more profound than he could  find in the Bible or the &ldquo;&AElig;neid,&rdquo; where his own foreknowledge of the text might  unwittingly influence the oracle. He went over to the recess, bent down, and  ran his hand along the backs of the volumes, with his face turned away from the  books towards the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first obstruction that arrests my hand shall  determine my choice of the volume,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>
<p>His hand ran easily along the volumes on the upper  shelf &mdash; easily along the volumes on the second shelf; and he began to doubt  whether this mode of determining his choice could be persisted in. But in its  progress along the third and lowest range of volumes, his hand was arrested  midway by a book which projected about half an inch beyond its fellows.</p>
<p>He took this book out and carried it to the table,  still without looking at it. He opened it, or rather let its leaves fall open  of their own accord &mdash; still without looking at it; and then, with a strange  superstitious fear &mdash; mingled in his mind with the natural shame that  accompanied his conscious folly &mdash; he looked at the page before him. The line on  which he fixed his eye was the heading of a letter. It was in larger type than  the rest of the page, and it was very plain to him as he stood a little way  from the table, looking down at the open book.</p>
<p>The line ran thus:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;On the  Fallibility of Copper Gauze as a Test for the Detection of Arsenic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book was a volume of the <em>Lancet</em>; the date twenty years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an oracle!&rdquo; thought Valentine, with a cynical  laugh at his own folly, and some slight sense of relief. In all feeble  tamperings with powers invisible there lurks a sense of terror in the weak  human heart. He had tempted those invisible ones, and the oracle he only half  believed in might have spoken to his confusion and dismay. He was glad to think  the oracle meant nothing.</p>
<p>And yet, even in this dry as dust title of a  scientific communication from a distinguished toxicologist there was some  sinister significance. It was the letter of a great chemist, who demonstrated  therein the fallibility of all tests in relation to a certain poison. It was  one of those papers which, while they aid the cause of science, may also  further the dark processes of the poisoner, by showing him the forces he has to  encounter, and the weapons with which he may defend himself from their power.  It is needless to dwell here upon the contents of this letter &mdash; one of a series  on the same subject, or range of subjects. Valentine read it with eager  interest. For him it had a terrible importance in its relation to the past and  to the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I let the book fall open, and it opened at that  letter,&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;Will it open there a second time, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He repeated the experiment, and the book opened in  the same place. Again; and again the book opened as before. Again, many times,  and the result was still the same.</p>
<p>After this he examined the book, and found that it  had been pressed open at this page, as by a reader leaning on the opened  volume. He examined it still more closely, and found here and there on the page  faint indications of a pencil, which had under-scored certain lines, and the  marks of which had been as far as possible erased. The deduction to be drawn  from these small facts seemed only too clear to Valentine Hawkehurst. By some  one reader the pages had been deliberately and carefully studied. Could he  doubt that reader to have been the man in whose possession he found the book,  the man whom that very day he had heard plainly denounced as a poisoner?</p>
<p>He drew out the previous volume, and in this a  rapid search revealed to him a second fact, significant as the last.</p>
<p>An old envelope marked the place where appeared an  article on the coincidences common to the diagnostics of a certain type of low  fever and the diagnostics of a certain class of poisons. Here the volume again  opened of itself, and a blot of ink on the page seemed to indicate that the  open book had been leant upon by a person engaged in making memoranda of its  contents. Nor was this all. The forgotten envelope that marked the place had  its own dismal significance. The postmark bore the date of the year and the  month in which Charlotte&rsquo;s father had died.</p>
<p>While this volume was still open in his hand the  door opened suddenly, and Mrs. Woolper came into the room.</p>
<p>She had kept Valentine waiting more than half an  hour. He had little more than half an hour at most in which to break the ice of  absolute strangeness, and sound the very depths of this woman&rsquo;s character. If  she had come to him earlier, when his plan of action was clear and definite,  his imagination in abeyance, he would have gone cautiously to work, with  slowness and deliberation. Coming to him now, when his mind, unsettled by the  discovery of fresh evidence against Philip Sheldon, was divided between the  past and the present, she took him off his guard, and he plunged at once into  the subject that absorbed all his thoughts.</p>
<p>Mrs. Woolper looked from Valentine to the open  books on the table with a vague terror in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I was so long, sir; but I&rsquo;d been  polishing the grates and fenders, and such like, and my hands and face were  blacker than a sweep&rsquo;s. I hope there&rsquo;s nothing wrong at the seaside, where  Miss&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is much that&rsquo;s wrong, Mrs. Woolper &mdash;  hopelessly, irrecoverably wrong. Miss Halliday is ill, very ill &mdash; doomed to  die, if she remain in your master&rsquo;s keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord help us, Mr. Hawkehurst! what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terror in her face was no longer a vague  terror. It had taken a form and substance, and was a terror unutterably  hideous, if ever human countenance gave expression to human thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that your master is better skilled in the  use of the agents that kill than the agents that cure. Charlotte&rsquo;s father came  to Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s house a hale strong man, in the very prime of manhood. In  that house he sickened of a nameless disease, and died, carefully tended by his  watchful friend. The same careful watcher stands by Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s  deathbed, and she is dying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dying! O, sir, for God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is dying, as her father died before her, by  the hand of Philip
  Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, sir! Mr. Hawkehurst!&rdquo; cried the old woman, with  clasped hands lifted in piteous supplication towards her master&rsquo;s denouncer.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true. It is not true. For God&rsquo;s dear love don&rsquo;t tell me it is true! I  nursed him when he was a baby, sir; and there wasn&rsquo;t a little trouble I had to  bear with him that didn&rsquo;t make him all the dearer to me. I have sat up all the  night through, sir, times and often, when he was ill, and have heard  Barlingford church clock strike every hour of the long night; and O, if I had  known that this could ever come to him, I should have wished him dead in the  little crib where he lay and seemed so innocent. I tell you, sir, it can&rsquo;t be  true! His father and mother had been respected and looked up to in Barlingford  for many a year, &mdash; his grandfather and grandmother before them. There isn&rsquo;t a  name that stands better in those parts than the name of Sheldon. Do you think  such a man would poison his friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> said  nothing about poison, Mrs. Woolper,&rdquo; said Valentine, sternly.</p>
<p>This woman had known all, and had held her tongue,  like the rest, it seemed. To Valentine there was unutterable horror in the  thought that a cold-blooded murder could be thus perpetrated in the sight of  several people, and yet no voice be raised to denounce the assassin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is our modern civilization!&rdquo; he said to  himself. &ldquo;Give me the desert or the jungle. The sons of Bowanee are no worse  than Mr. Sheldon, and one might be on one&rsquo;s guard against them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nancy Woolper looked at him aghast. He had said  nothing about poison!
  What, then &mdash; had she betrayed her master?</p>
<p>He saw that she had known, or strongly suspected,  the worst in the case of Tom Halliday, and that she would easily be influenced  to do all he wanted of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Woolper, you must help me to save Charlotte,&rdquo;  he said, with intensity. &ldquo;You made no attempt to save her father, though you  suspected the cause of his death. I have this day seen Mr. Burkham, the doctor  who attended Mr. Halliday, and from his lips I have heard the truth. I want you  to accompany me to Hastings, and to take your place by Charlotte&rsquo;s bed, as her  nurse and guardian. If Mr. Sheldon suspects your knowledge of the past, and I  have little doubt that he does&rdquo; &mdash; a look in the housekeeper&rsquo;s face told him  that he was right&mdash; &ldquo;you are of all people best fitted to guard that dear girl.  Your part will not be a difficult one. If we dare remove her, we will remove  her beyond the reach of that man&rsquo;s power. If not, your task will be to prevent  food or medicine, that his hand has touched, from approaching her lips. You <em>can</em> do it. It will only be a question of  tact and firmness. We shall have one of the greatest doctors in London for our  guide. Will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe my master poisoned his friend,&rdquo;  said Nancy Woolper, doggedly; &ldquo;nor I won&rsquo;t believe it. You can&rsquo;t force me to  think bad of him I loved when he was little and helpless, and I carried him in  my arms. What are you and your fine London doctor, Mr. Burkham &mdash; he was but a  poor fondy, as I mind well &mdash; that I should take your word against my master? If  that young man thought as Mr. Halliday was being poisoned, why didn&rsquo;t he speak  out, like a man, then? It&rsquo;s a fine piece of work to bring it up against my  master eleven years afterwards. As for young missy, she&rsquo;s as sweet a young  creature as ever lived, and I&rsquo;d do anything to serve her. But I won&rsquo;t think,  and I can&rsquo;t think, that my master would hurt a hair of her head. What would he  gain by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has settled that with himself. He has gained by  the death of Tom Halliday, and depend upon it he has made his plans to gain by  the death of Tom Halliday&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; the old woman repeated in the  same dogged tone.</p>
<p>For such resistance as this Mr. Hawkehurst was in  no manner prepared. He looked at his watch. The half hour was nearly gone.  There was little more time for argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heaven!&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;what argument  can I employ to influence this woman&rsquo;s obdurate heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What argument, indeed? He knew of none stronger  than those he had used. He stood for some moments battled and helpless, staring  absently at the face of his watch, and wondering what he was to do next.</p>
<p>As Valentine Hawkehurst stood thus, there came a  loud ringing of the bell, following quickly on the sound of wheels grinding  against the kerbstone.</p>
<p>Mrs. Woolper opened the door and looked out into  the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s master!&rdquo; cried one of the maids, emerging  from the disorganized dining-room, &ldquo;and missus, and Miss Halliday, and Mass  Paget &mdash; and all the house topsy-turvy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte here!&rdquo; exclaimed Valentine. &ldquo;You are  dreaming, girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you told me she was dying!&rdquo; said Mrs. Woolper,  with a look of triumph. &ldquo;What becomes of your fine story now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> Miss Halliday!&rdquo; cried the housemaid, as she opened the door. &ldquo;And O my!&rdquo; she  added, looking back into the hall with a sorrowful face, &ldquo;how bad she do look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine ran out to the gate. Yes; there were two  cabs, one laden with luggage, the two cabmen busy about the doors of the  vehicles, a little group of stragglers waiting to see the invalid young lady  alight. It was the next best thing to a funeral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t she look white!&rdquo; cried a shrill girl with  a baby in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a decline, I dessay, pore young thing,&rdquo; said a  matron, in an audible aside to her companion.</p>
<p>Valentine dashed amongst the group of stragglers.  He pushed away the girl with the baby, the housemaid who had run out behind  him, Mr. Sheldon, the cabman, every one; and in the next moment Charlotte was  in his arms, and he was carrying her into the house.</p>
<p>He felt as if he had been in a dream; and all that  exceptional force which the dreamer sometimes feels he felt in this crisis. He  carried his dear burden into the study, followed by Mr. Sheldon and Diana  Paget. The face that dropped upon his shoulder showed deadly white against his dark-blue  coat; the hand which he clasped in his, ah, how listless and feeble!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine!&rdquo; the girl said, in a low drowsy voice,  lifting her eyes to his face, &ldquo;is this you? I have been so ill, so tired; and  they would bring me away. To be near the doctors, papa says. Do you think any  doctors will be able to cure me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, with God&rsquo;s help. I am glad he has  brought you here. And now I must run away,&rdquo; he said; when he had placed  Charlotte in Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s arm-chair, &ldquo;for a very little while, darling. I have  seen a doctor, a man in whom I have more confidence than I have in Dr.  Doddleson. I am going to fetch him, my dearest,&rdquo; he added tenderly, as he felt  the feeble hand cling to his; &ldquo;I shall not be long. Do you think I shall not  hurry back to you? My dearest one, when I return, it will be to stay with you &mdash;  for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was too ill to note the significance of his  words; she only knew that they gave her comfort. He hurried from the room. In  less than an hour he must be at the London Bridge terminus, or in all  probability the five o&rsquo;clock train would carry Dr. Jedd to St. Leonards; and on  Dr. Jedd his chief hope rested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe me now?&rdquo; he asked of Mrs. Woolper  as he went out into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she answered in a whisper; &ldquo;and I will do  what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took his hand in her wrinkled horny palm and  grasped it firmly. He felt that in this firm pressure there was a promise  sacred as any oath ever registered on earth. He met Mr. Sheldon on the  threshold, and passed him without a word. The time might come in which he would  have to mask his thoughts, and stoop to the hateful hypocrisy of civility to  this man; but he had not yet schooled himself to do this. At the gate he met  George Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; asked the lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you send your message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I telegraphed to Phil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been trouble wasted. He has brought her  home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? I pray God that he may have overreached  himself. I have set a watch upon my dear love, and no further harm shall come  to her. I am going to fetch Dr. Jedd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are not afraid of Phil&rsquo;s smelling a rat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid of nothing that he can do  henceforward. If it is not too late to save her, I will save her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited for no more, but jumped into the cab.  &ldquo;London Bridge terminus!
  You must get me there by a quarter to five,&rdquo; he said to the driver.</p>
<p>George Sheldon went no further than the gate of his  brother&rsquo;s domain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether the Harold&rsquo;s Hill people will  send that telegram after him,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be rather unpleasant for Fred  Orcott if they do. But it&rsquo;s ten to one they won&rsquo;t. The normal condition of  every seaside lodging-house keeper in one degree removed from idiotcy.&rdquo;</p>

  Through The Furnace</em></h1>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter32"></a>Chapter 32<br>
  Something Too Much</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Is that young man mad?&rdquo; asked Philip Sheldon, as  he went into his study immediately after Valentine had passed him in the hall.</p>
<p>The question was not addressed to any particular  individual; and Diana, who was standing near the door by which Mr. Sheldon  entered, took upon herself to answer it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he is very anxious,&rdquo; she said in a half  whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brought him here just now? He did not know we  were coming home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Woolper answered this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came for something for Miss Charlotte, sir;  some books as she&rsquo;d had from the library. They&rsquo;d not been sent back; and he  came to see about their being sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What books?&rdquo; murmured Charlotte. But a pressure  from Mrs. Woolper&rsquo;s hand prevented her saying more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never encountered any one with so little  self-command,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon. &ldquo;If he is going to rush in and out of my house  in that manner, I must really put a stop to his visits altogether. I cannot  suffer that kind of thing. For Charlotte&rsquo;s welfare quiet is indispensable; and  if Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s presence is to bring noise and excitement, Mr. Hawkehurst  must not cross this threshold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with suppressed anger; with such evident  effort to restrain his anger, that it would have seemed as if his indignation  against Valentine was no common wrath.</p>
<p>Charlotte caught his last words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear papa,&rdquo; she pleaded in her faint voice, &ldquo;pray  do not be angry with
  Valentine; he is so anxious about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not angry with him; but while you are ill, I  will have quiet &mdash; at any price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m sure you should not have brought  Charlotte home,&rdquo; exclaimed Georgy, in tones of wailing and lamentation; &ldquo;for of  all the miseries in life, there is nothing worse than coming home in the very  midst of a general cleaning. It was agreed between Ann Woolper and me that  there should be a general cleaning while we were away at the seaside. We were  to be away a fortnight, and everything was to be as neat as a new pin when we  came home. But here we are back in less than a week, and everything at  sixes-and-sevens. Where we are to dine I know not; and as for the carpets, they  are all away at the beating-place, and Ann tells me they won&rsquo;t be home till  Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can exist without carpets,&rdquo; answered Mr.  Sheldon, in a hard dry voice. &ldquo;I suppose they are seeing to Miss Halliday&rsquo;s  room?&rdquo; he added, addressing himself to Mrs. Woolper. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go and look  after them, Nancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarah knows what she has to do. The bed-rooms was  done first; and there&rsquo;s not much amiss in Miss Charlotte&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon dropped wearily into a chair. He looked  pale and haggard. Throughout the journey he had been unfailing in his attention  to the invalid; but the journey had been fatiguing; for Charlotte Halliday was  very ill &mdash; so ill as to be unable to avoid inflicting trouble upon others. The  weariness &mdash; the dizziness &mdash; the dull intervals of semi-consciousness &mdash; the  helpless tottering walk, which was like the walk of intoxication rather than  ordinary weakness &mdash; the clouded sight &mdash; all the worst symptoms of this nameless  disease, had every hour grown more alarming.</p>
<p>Against this journey to London Mrs. Sheldon and  Diana had pleaded &mdash; Georgy with as much earnestness as she could command; Diana  as forcibly as she dared argue a question in which her voice had so little  weight.</p>
<p>But upon this point Mr. Sheldon was adamant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will be better off in London,&rdquo; he said  resolutely. &ldquo;This trip to the seaside was a whim of my wife&rsquo;s; and, like most  other whims of my wife&rsquo;s, it has entailed trouble and expense upon me. Of  course I know that Georgy did it for the best,&rdquo; he added, in reply to a  reproachful &ldquo;O Philip!&rdquo; from Mrs. Sheldon. &ldquo;But the whole business has been a  mistake. No sooner are we comfortably settled down here, than Hawkehurst takes  it into his head to be outrageously alarmed about Charlotte, and wants to bring  half-a-dozen doctors round the poor girl&rsquo;s bed, to her inevitable peril; for in  an illness which begins and ends in mental depression, all appearance of alarm  is calculated to do mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having said this, Mr. Sheldon lost no time in  making arrangements for the journey. A carriage was ordered; all possible  preparations were made for the comfort of the invalid &mdash; everything that care or  kindness could do was done; but the cruelty of the removal was not the less  obvious. Georgy wailed piteously about the sixes-and-sevens to which they were  being taken. Diana cared nothing about sixes-and-sevens; but she felt supreme  indignation against Charlotte&rsquo;s stepfather, and she did not attempt to conceal  her feelings.</p>
<p>Nor was it without an effort to oppose Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s authority that Miss
  Paget succumbed to the force of circumstances. She appealed to his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Sheldon, I beg you not to suffer Lotta&rsquo;s  removal,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;You do not know how ill she is &mdash; nor can Mr.  Sheldon know, or he would not take such a step. As her mother, your authority  is superior to his; you have but to say that she shall not be taken from this  house in her present state of prostration and sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only to say!&rdquo; cried Georgy, piteously. &ldquo;O  Diana, how can you say such a thing? What would be Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s feelings if I  were to stand up against him, and declare that Charlotte should not be moved?  And he so anxious too, and so clever. I&rsquo;m sure his conduct about my poor dear  Lotta is positively beautiful. I never saw such anxiety. Why, he has grown ten years  older in his looks since the beginning of her illness. People go on about  stepfather this, and stepfather that, until a poor young widow is almost  frightened to marry again. But I don&rsquo;t believe a real father ever was more  thoughtful or more careful about a real daughter than Philip has been about  Lotta. And what a poor return it would be if I were to oppose him now, when he  says that the removal will be for Charlotte&rsquo;s good, and that she will be near  clever doctors &mdash; if she should require clever doctors! You don&rsquo;t know how  experienced he is, and how thoughtful. I shall never forget his kindness to  poor Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Paget impatiently, &ldquo;but Mr.  Halliday died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Diana,&rdquo; whimpered Georgy, &ldquo;I did not think you  could be so unkind as to remind me of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only want to remind you that Mr. Sheldon is not  infallible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon entered the room at this juncture, and  Diana left it, passionately indignant against the poor weak creature, to whom  no crisis, no danger, could give strength of mind or will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sheep would make some struggle for her lamb,&rdquo;  she thought, angrily.&ldquo;Mrs. Sheldon is lower than a sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time she had thought unkindly of  this weak soul, and her anger soon melted to pity for the powerless nature  which Mr. Sheldon held in such supreme control. She made no further attempt at  resistance after this; but went to Charlotte&rsquo;s room and prepared for the  journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, why am I to be moved, dear?&rdquo; the girl asked  piteously. &ldquo;I am too ill to be moved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for your good, darling. Mr. Sheldon wants  you to be near the great physicians, who can give you health and strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no physicians who can do that. Let me  stay here, Di. Beg papa to let me stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana hid her face upon the invalid&rsquo;s shoulder. Her  tears choked her. To repress her grief was agony scarcely endurable. But she  did hide all trace of anger and sorrow, and cheered the helpless traveller  throughout the weariness of the journey.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Charlotte was lying on a sofa in her bedroom, with  Mrs. Woolper in attendance upon her, when Dr. Jedd arrived. It was a quarter to  six, and the low western sunshine flooded the room.</p>
<p>The physician came with Valentine, and did not ask  to see Mr. Sheldon before going to his patient&rsquo;s room. He told the housemaid who  admitted him to show the way to Miss Halliday&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nurse is there, I suppose?&rdquo; he said to the  girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; leastways, Mrs. Woolper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon heard the voice in the hall, and came  out of the library as the doctor mounted the step of the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this? What is this?&rdquo; he asked of Valentine  Hawkehurst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I was not satisfied with Dr.  Doddleson&rsquo;s opinion,&rdquo; answered the young man coolly. &ldquo;This gentleman is here by  appointment with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray by what right do you bring a doctor of  your own choosing to visit my stepdaughter without previous consultation with  me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the right of my love for her. I am not  satisfied as to the medical treatment your stepdaughter has received in this  house, Mr. Sheldon, and I want to be satisfied. Miss Halliday is something more  than your stepdaughter, remember: she is my promised wife. Dr. Jedd&rsquo;s opinion  will be more assuring to me than the opinion of Dr. Doddleson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of Dr. Jedd&rsquo;s name Mr. Sheldon started  slightly. It was a name he knew only too well &mdash; a name he had seen among the  medical witnesses in the great Fryar trial, the record of which had for him  possessed a hideous fascination. He had fancied himself in the poisoner Fryar&rsquo;s  place; and the fancy had sent an icy chill through his veins. But in the next  minute he had said to himself, &ldquo;I am not such a reckless fool as that man Fryar  was; and have run no such risks as he ran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the name of Jedd the same icy shiver ran through  his veins again. His tone of suppressed anger changed to a tone of civility  which was almost sycophantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the honour to know Dr. Jedd by repute very  well indeed, and I withdraw my objection to your course of proceeding, my dear  Hawkehurst; though I am sure Dr. Jedd will agree with me that such a course is  completely against all professional etiquette, and that Dr. Doddleson will have  the right to consider himself aggrieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are cases in which one hardly considers  professional etiquette. I shall be very happy to meet Dr. Doddleson to-morrow  morning. But as Mr. Hawkehurst was very anxious that I should see Miss Halliday  to-night, I consented to waive all ceremony, and come with him on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot blame his anxiety to secure so valuable  an opinion. I only wonder what lucky star guided him to so excellent an  adviser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon looked from Dr. Jedd to Valentine  Hawkehurst as he said this. The physician&rsquo;s face told him no more than he might  have learnt from a blank sheet of paper. Valentine&rsquo;s face was dark and gloomy;  but that gloomy darkness might mean no more than natural grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take you to my stepdaughter&rsquo;s room at  once,&rdquo; he said to the physician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will be better for me to see the young  lady alone,&rdquo; the doctor answered coolly: &ldquo;that is to say, in the presence of  her nurse only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon replied.</p>
<p>He went back to his study. Georgy was sitting  there, whimpering in a feeble way at intervals; and near her sat Diana, silent  and gloomy. A settled gloom, as of the grave itself, brooded over the house.  Mr. Sheldon flung himself into a chair with an impatient gesture. He had  sneered at the inconvenience involved in uncarpeted floors, but he was  beginning to feel the aggravation of that inconvenience. These two women in his  study were insupportable to him. It seemed as if there was no room in the house  in which he could be alone; and just now he had bitter need of solitary  meditation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them arrange the dining-room somehow, carpet  or no carpet,&rdquo; he said to his wife. &ldquo;We must have some room to dine in; and I  can&rsquo;t have you here, Georgy; I have letters to write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheldon and Diana were not slow to take the  hint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want to be here, or anywhere,&rdquo;  exclaimed Georgy in piteous accents; &ldquo;I feel so miserable about Charlotte, that  if I could lie down and die, it would be a comfort to me. And it really seems a  mockery having dinner at such a time. It&rsquo;s just as it was during poor Tom&rsquo;s  illness; there were fowls and all sorts of things cooked, and no one ever ate  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake go away!&rdquo; cried Mr. Sheldon  passionately; &ldquo;your perpetual clack is torture to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Georgy hurried from the room, followed closely by  Diana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see any one more anxious?&rdquo; Mrs.  Sheldon asked, with something like pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather see Mr. Sheldon less anxious!&rdquo;  Diana answered gravely.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter33"></a>Chapter 33<br>
  Dr. Jedd&rsquo;s Opinion</h2>
<p>Alone, Philip Sheldon breathed more freely. He  paced the room, waiting for the appearance of the doctor; and with almost every  turn he looked at the clock upon the chimneypiece.</p>
<p>How intolerable seemed the slow progress of the  moments! How long that man Jedd was staying in the sick-room! And yet not long;  it was he, Philip Sheldon, who was losing count of time. Where was Valentine?  He opened the door of the room, and looked out. Yes, there was a figure on the  stairs. The lover was waiting the physician&rsquo;s verdict.</p>
<p>A door on the landing above opened, and the step of  the Doctor sounded on the upper flight. Mr. Sheldon waited for Dr. Jedd&rsquo;s  appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to hear your opinion,&rdquo; he said  quietly; and the Doctor followed him into the study. Valentine followed the  Doctor, to Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s evident surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hawkehurst is very anxious to hear what I have  to say,&rdquo; said Dr.
  Jedd; &ldquo;and I really see no objection to his hearing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have no objection, I can have none,&rdquo; Mr.  Sheldon answered. &ldquo;I must confess, your course of proceeding appears to me  altogether exceptional, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Sheldon; but then, you see, the case is  altogether an exceptional case,&rdquo; said the physician, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly. The young lady is in extreme danger.  Yes, Mr. Sheldon, in extreme danger. The mistake involved in her removal to-day  is a mistake which I cannot denounce too strongly. If you had wanted to kill  your stepdaughter, you could scarcely have pursued a more likely course for the  attainment of your object. No doubt you were actuated by the most amiable  motives. I can only regret that you should have acted without competent  advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believed myself to be acting for the best,&rdquo; replied  Philip Sheldon, in a strange mechanical way.</p>
<p>He was trying to estimate the true meaning of the  Doctor&rsquo;s address. Was he merely expressing anger against an error of ignorance  or stupidity, or was there a more fatal significance in his words?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You overwhelm me,&rdquo; the stockbroker said presently;  &ldquo;you positively overwhelm me by your view of my daughter&rsquo;s condition. Dr.  Doddleson apprehended no danger. He saw our dear girl on Sunday morning &mdash;  yesterday morning,&rdquo; added Mr. Sheldon, wonder-stricken to find that the  interval was so brief between the time in which he had walked with Valentine  and Dr. Doddleson in the garden at Harold&rsquo;s Hill and the present moment. To  Valentine it seemed still more wonderful. What a bridgeless gulf between  yesterday morning and to-night! All his knowledge of this man Sheldon, all the  horror involved in Tom Halliday&rsquo;s death, had come upon him in that brief span.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see Dr. Doddleson&rsquo;s  prescriptions,&rdquo; said Dr. Jedd, with grave politeness.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon produced them from his pocket-book with  an unshaken hand. No change of countenance, no tremulous hand, no broken voice,  betrayed his apprehension. The one distinguishing mark of his manner was an  absent, half-mechanical tone, as of a man whose mind is employed otherwise than  in the conversation of the moment. Prompt at calculation always, he was at this  crisis engaged in a kind of mental arithmetic. &ldquo;The chances of defeat, so much;  the chances of detection &mdash; ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rapid survey of his position told him what those  chances were. Detection by Dr. Jedd? Yes. That had come to him already perhaps.  But would any actual harm to him come of such detection?</p>
<p>He calculated the chances for and against this &mdash;  and the result was in his favour. That Dr. Jedd should form certain opinions of  Miss Halliday&rsquo;s case was one thing; that he should give public utterance to  those opinions was another thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can his opinion matter to me?&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon  asked himself; &ldquo;opinion cannot touch me in a case where there is no such thing  as certainty. He has seen the dilatation of the pupil &mdash; even that old fool  Doddleson saw it &mdash; and has taken fright. But no jury in England would hang a  man on such evidence as that; or if a jury could be found to put the rope round  a man&rsquo;s neck, the British public and the British press would be pretty sure to  get the rope taken off again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chloric &aelig;ther, spirits of ammonia &mdash; hum, ha, hum &mdash;  yes,&rdquo; muttered Dr. Jedd, looking at one prescription. &ldquo;Quinine, yes; aqua  pura,&rdquo; he murmured, looking at another.</p>
<p>He threw them aside with a half-contemptuous  gesture, and then took up a pen and began to write.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mode of treatment will be quite different from  that adopted by Dr. Doddleson,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I apprehend no difficulty in  bringing that gentleman round to my view of the case when we meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he wrote his prescription Philip Sheldon rose  and looked over his shoulder.</p>
<p>The form of the prescription told him that Dr. Jedd  knew &mdash; all! He had suspected this from the first, and the confirmation of this  suspicion did not shake him. He grew firmer, indeed; for now he knew on what  ground he was standing, and what forces were arrayed against him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really do not understand the basis of your  treatment,&rdquo; he said, still looking over the physician&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Dr. Jedd turned his chair with a sudden movement,  and faced him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I talking to Mr. Sheldon the stockbroker, or  Mr. Sheldon the surgeon-dentist?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p><em>This</em> was a blow. This allusion  to the past was a sharper stroke than any that Philip Sheldon had before  received. He looked at Valentine; from Valentine to the physician. What did it  mean, this mention of the past? That blabbing fool George had talked to his  friend of the days in Fitzgeorge Street, no doubt; and Valentine had blabbed  Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s antecedents to the physician.</p>
<p>Was this what it all meant? Or did it mean more  than this? Whatever it might mean, he faced the hidden danger, and met the  uncertainties of his position as calmly as he met its certainties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no desire to interfere with your  treatment,&rdquo; he said, very quietly; &ldquo;but I have some knowledge of the  Pharmacopoeia, and I confess myself quite at a loss to understand your  prescription.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Doddleson will understand it when he has heard  my opinion. There is no time to be lost &mdash; Mr. Hawkehurst, will you take this to  the chemist, and wait for the medicine? Miss Halliday cannot take it too soon.  I shall be here to-morrow at nine o&rsquo;clock. &mdash; If you wish me to see Dr.  Doddleson, Mr. Sheldon, you will perhaps arrange an appointment with him for  that hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rather an early hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hour is too early in a case attended with so  much danger. Perhaps it will be as well for me to call on Dr. Doddleson as I  drive home. I shall make a point of seeing Miss Halliday twice a day. I find  your housekeeper a very sensible person. She will remain in close attendance  upon the sick-room; and I must beg that there is no quackery &mdash; no home-made  remedies. I have given your housekeeper all directions as to treatment and  diet, and she has my orders to allow no one but herself in the invalid&rsquo;s room.  There is a marked tendency to delirium, and quiet is indispensable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said as much myself,&rdquo; answered Mr. Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hawkehurst will undertake to see to the  making-up of my prescriptions,&rdquo; continued Dr. Jedd, as he drew on his gloves.  &ldquo;He is very anxious about the young lady, and it will afford him some relief of  mind to be employed in her service. No, thanks,&rdquo; he said, putting aside Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s hand as that gentleman offered him his fee. &ldquo;I have already received  my honorarium from Mr. Hawkehurst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no more to be said. The physician wished  the two men good evening, and returned to his carriage, to be driven home to  dinner by way of Plantagenet Square, where he saw Dr. Doddleson, and appointed  to meet him next day, much to the delight of that individual, who was proud to  be engaged in a case with the great Jedd.</p>
<p>Valentine left the house on the heels of the  Doctor. He came back in about twenty minutes with the medicine. He did not go  to the principal gate, but to a little side gate, near the offices of the  gothic villa &mdash; a gate to which butchers and bakers came with their wares in the  morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see Miss Paget,&rdquo; he said to the maid who  answered his summons; &ldquo;and I want to see her without disturbing Mr. and Mrs.  Sheldon. Do you know where to find her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; she&rsquo;s in her own room. I took her a cup  of tea there ten minutes ago. She&rsquo;s got a headache with fretting about our poor  young lady, and she won&rsquo;t go down to dinner with master and missus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you ask her to step out here and speak to me  for a few minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come indoors and see her, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;d rather see her in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was still daylight here, but it was growing  shadowy among the avenues in Kensington Gardens. The gate near which Valentine  waited was not to be seen from the windows of dining or drawing-room.</p>
<p>The housemaid ran off to summon Miss Paget; and in  less than five minutes
  Diana appeared, dressed in her hat and garden jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come out into the road with me, dear?&rdquo;  asked Valentine. &ldquo;I have something serious to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am so anxious to hear what the Doctor has  said,&rdquo; answered Diana, as she took Valentine&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>The road before the Lawn was very quiet at this  hour of the evening, and here they were safely beyond Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s ken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me the Doctor&rsquo;s opinion, Valentine,&rdquo; Diana  said, eagerly. &ldquo;Does he think the case very serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does. It is more serious than you or I could  have imagined, if
  Providence had not helped me to discover the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Valentine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave her in brief the story of his day&rsquo;s work.  She listened to him breathlessly, but uttered no exclamation until his story  was finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is most horrible,&rdquo; she said at last; &ldquo;but I  believe it is most true. There has been so much in that man&rsquo;s conduct that has  mystified me; and <em>this</em> explains all.  But what earthly motive can have prompted this hideous crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He believes that he has a beneficial interest in  her death. I cannot fully understand his motive; but, rely upon it, there is a  motive, and a sufficient one. And I have let that man delude me into belief in  his honesty after I had been warned against him! But there is no time for  regrets. Diana, I look to you to help me in saving my dear love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not too late to save her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Jedd will commit himself to no positive  statement. He tells me she is in danger, but he does not refuse all hope. Now  listen, my dear. In that house I have only two people to help me &mdash; Ann Woolper  and yourself. Ann Woolper I hold only by a feeble bond. I think she will be  true to us; but I am not sure of her. Sheldon&rsquo;s influence over her is a  powerful one; and God knows what concession he might extort from her. She is  the ostensible guardian of Charlotte&rsquo;s room; you must contrive to be the real  guardian. You must keep custody over the custodian. How is your room situated  in relation to Charlotte&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doors of the two rooms are exactly opposite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providence favours us there. Can you keep watch  over Charlotte&rsquo;s door from your room without making your guardianship too  apparent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Day and night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Day and night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, dear! Her life may be saved by your  fidelity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would do as much to render her a smaller  service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl! And now go back to the house. Here  is the medicine. You will give that into Mrs. Woolper&rsquo;s hands; she has received  her instructions from Dr. Jedd, and those instructions leave no room for doubt.  If she permits Sheldon to tamper with the medicine or the food of her patient,  she will be the wilful accomplice of a murderer. I think she may be trusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will watch her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The charge of procuring the medicine is mine. I  shall come to this house many times in the course of every day; but I am bound  to prepare myself for the hour in which Mr. Sheldon may forbid me his house. In  that event I shall come to this gate. I suppose the servants would stand by me  if you pleaded for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure they would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, dear, go; the medicine is wanted. I shall  come back in a few hours to inquire if there is any change for the better. Go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had returned to the gate ere this. He grasped  the hand which she held out to him, and stood by the little gate watching her  till she had disappeared through the door of the servants&rsquo; quarters. When the  door closed, he walked slowly away. He had done all that it was possible for  him to do, and now came his worst misery. There was nothing left for him but to  wait the issue of events.</p>
<p>What was he to do? Go home to his lodgings &mdash; eat,  drink, sleep? Was it possible for him to eat or to sleep while that precious  life trembled in the balance? He walked slowly along the endless roads and  terraces in a purposeless way. Careless people pushed against him, or he pushed  against them; children brushed past him as they ran. What a noisy, busy, clattering  world it seemed! And she lay dying! O, the droning, dreary organs, and the  hackneyed, common tunes, how excruciating they were to him to-night!</p>
<p>He emerged into the high road by-and-by, in all the  bustle and riot of Notting Hill. The crowded shops, the clamorous people,  seemed strange to him. It was like the clamour of a foreign city. He walked on  past the bustle and riot, by the quieter terraces near Holland Park, and still  held on to Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, where he went into a little public-house and called  for some brandy.</p>
<p>There was a bench on one side of the space in front  of the bar, and towards this he pushed his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you shoving to, my young swell?&rdquo; growled  a sturdy cabman, indignant at the outrage inflicted by Valentine&rsquo;s elbows; but  in the next moment the sturdy cabman dashed suddenly forward and caught the  young swell in his strong arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My eye, young un!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;where do you want to  go to? Here, some one bring a mug of cold water: I&rsquo;m blest if he ain&rsquo;t in a  fit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Happily it was no fit, only a dead faint into which  Mr. Hawkehurst had fallen. He came back to consciousness presently, after a few  spoonfuls of brandy had been forced into his mouth, and looked about him with a  helpless stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m jiggered if I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s fainted for the  want of wittles!&rdquo; cried the cabman. &ldquo;They keeps up till they drop, sometimes,  these seedy swells &mdash; walks about, lookin&rsquo; like so many Dossays, on a hempty  stomach. Here, some one bring a plate o&rsquo; cold meat, and look sharp about it.  I&rsquo;ll stand sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine looked up with a faint smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll stand sam for anything you like to order,  my friend,&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand to the good-natured cabman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  eaten nothing since last night; but I haven&rsquo;t fasted for want of money. There  are worse troubles than an empty pocket, &mdash; and I&rsquo;m not unacquainted with <em>that</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said the man,  sheepishly, very much ashamed of his benevolence; &ldquo;but, you see, it ain&rsquo;t the  fust time I&rsquo;ve seen a swell come to the pavement with a cropper, in consequence  of having gone it too fast, and cleaned hisself out, in a manner of speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 34<br>
  Non Dormit Judas</h2>
<p>The summer darkness closed round the Bayswater  villa, but of sleep there was little for any one in that household during this  sad night. Is there not, in almost every household, a memory of such days and  nights &mdash; dread intervals in which the common course of life and time seems to  be suspended, and all the interests of the universe hang upon the fitful breath  of one dear sufferer?</p>
<p>Lonely were the watchers in Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s house.  Georgy was in her own room, forbidden to disturb the invalid by her restless  presence &mdash; now lying down, now pacing to and fro, now praying a little, now  crying a little &mdash; the very ideal of helpless misery.</p>
<p>In the sick-room there was no one but the invalid  and Ann Woolper. In the room opposite watched Diana Paget, her door ajar, her  senses sharpened by anxiety, quick to hear the faintest sound of footfall on  the stairs, or to feel the slightest vibration from stealthily opened door on  the story below.</p>
<p>Alone in the study sat Philip Sheldon, at the table  where he was accustomed to write &mdash; a blank sheet of paper before him, a pen  held loosely in his outstretched hand, and his eyes fixed in an unseeing gaze  upon the bookcase opposite &mdash; the living image of care. Now that the turmoil of  the day was done, and there was silence in the house, he had set himself to  face his position. It was no trifling task which he had to perform. Not one  difficulty, or one set of difficulties, had he to meet and master. The armed  enemies up-springing from the dragon&rsquo;s teeth which he had sown were not to be  set fighting amongst themselves, nor were they to be smashed by any rocks that  he could hurl amongst them. They stood around him in an awful circle, and turn  which way he would, he saw the same appalling figure, armed to the teeth, and  invincible as death.</p>
<p>What had he to fear?</p>
<p>Detection of a past crime? No, that was a fool&rsquo;s  terror which shook him at the sound of Tom Halliday&rsquo;s name &mdash; a child&rsquo;s fear of  the nursery bogie. Detection in the present was more to be dreaded. The work  that he had done was, according to his belief, work that could not be proved  against him. But there are crimes of which to be accused is to be condemned.  Lawyers may plead, and juries may acquit; but the fiat of public opinion goes  forth against the suspected wretch, and on <em>his</em> forehead for ever shows the dark brand of Cain.</p>
<p>For the criminal of almost every shade of colour,  save this one dread hue, society has a sanctuary and earth a refuge. The forger  may find a circle in which the signing of another man&rsquo;s name, under the  pressure of circumstances, is held to be a misfortune rather than an offence.  The swindler has the gentlemanly brotherhood and sisterhood of Macaire for his  family, and need never be lonely. The thief may dance away his jovial nights  among kindred spirits, and be carried to his grave by sorrowing fellow-artists.  The coiner may be jolly in his hiding-place among his chosen band of brother  coiners. But for the murderer there is no such thing as human sympathy; and,  when the blood of Nancy dyes his cruel hand, Bill Sykes may thank God if he has  a dog that will follow him to his wretched end, for from mankind he can hope  nothing.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon did not contemplate his position from  any sentimental point of view; but he told himself that to be suspected of  having poisoned his friend, and to be accused of poisoning, or attempting to  poison, his daughter, would be ruin &mdash; ruin social and commercial, ruin complete  and irretrievable.</p>
<p>And having faced one of these dread armed  antagonists, he passed on to another shadowy enemy.</p>
<p>What if Charlotte recovered, and he escaped the  taint of uttered suspicion &mdash; for Dr. Jedd&rsquo;s private opinion he cared very  little &mdash; what then?</p>
<p>Then the grim antagonist lifted his visor, and  showed him the countenance of Commercial Disgrace.</p>
<p>Unless within the next few weeks he could command  from eight to ten thousand pounds, his disgrace as a member of the Stock  Exchange was inevitable. Charlotte&rsquo;s death would give him the means of raising  as much upon the policies of assurance obtained by her, and which, by the terms  of her will, he would inherit. The life-insurance people might be somewhat slow  to settle his claims; but he had all possible facilities for the raising of  money upon any tangible security, and he could count upon immediate cash, in  the event of Charlotte&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>But what if she should not die? What if this  nameless languor, this mysterious atrophy, taken vigorously in hand by Dr.  Jedd, should be vanquished, and the girl should live?</p>
<p>What indeed? A sharp spasm contracted the  stockbroker&rsquo;s hard cold face as he pictured to himself the result of failure.</p>
<p>He saw the crowd of busy faces in the House, and  heard the low hum of many voices, and the dull sound of the big half-glass  doors swinging to and fro, and the constant tread of hurrying feet. He heard  the buzz of voices and the tramp of feet stop as suddenly as if that busy tide  of human life had been arrested by an enchanter&rsquo;s wand. The enchanter is no  other than the head-waiter of the Stock Exchange, who takes his position by a  stand in the midst of that great meeting-place, and removes his hat.</p>
<p>After that sudden silence comes a faint sound of  anxious whisperings; and then again a second silence, still more profound,  prevails in that assembly. Three times, with wooden hammer sounding dull  against the woodwork of his stand, the waiter raps his awful rap. To some it is  the call of doom. The commercial Nemesis hides her awful countenance. Slow and  solemn sound those three deliberate strokes of the wooden hammer. You can hear  the stertorous breathing of an apoplectic stockbroker, the short panting  respiration of some eager speculator &mdash; the rest is silence. And then the voice  of the waiter &mdash; proxy for the commercial Nemesis &mdash; calmly enunciates the dread  decree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philip Sheldon begs to inform the members of the  House that he cannot comply with his bargains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden flutter of the leaves of many note-books  follows that awful announcement. Voices rise loud in united utterance of  surprise or indignation. The doors swing to and fro, as hurrying members dash  in and out to scan the market and ascertain how far they may be affected by  this unlooked-for failure.</p>
<p>This was the scene which the watcher pictured to  himself; and for him Fate could wear no aspect more terrible. Respectability,  solvency, success &mdash; these were the idols to which he had given worship and  tribute in all the days of his life. To propitiate these inexorable ones he had  sacrificed all the dearest and best blessings which earth and heaven offer to  mankind. Rest or happiness, as other men consider these blessings, he had never  known; the sense of triumph in success of the present, the feverish expectation  of success in the future &mdash; these had stood to him in the place of love and  hope, pleasure and idlesse, all the joys and comforts of this lower world, and  all the holy dreams of purer pleasures in a world to come.</p>
<p>One vague brief thought of all that he had  sacrificed flashed across his brain; and swift upon his track followed the  thought of what he stood to lose.</p>
<p>Something more than his position upon the Stock  Exchange was at stake. He had done desperate things in the vain hope of  sustaining that position against the destroying sweep of Fortune&rsquo;s turning  tide. Bills were afloat which he must meet, or stand before the world a  detected forger, &mdash; bills drawn upon companies that were shadowy as the regions  of their supposed operations. Bills amounting to five thousand pounds, drawn,  upon the Honduras Mahogany Company, Limited; other bills amounting to upwards  of three thousand pounds, against the Pennsylvanian Anthracite Coal  Corporation, Limited. The sum he might raise on the policies of insurance would  about cover these bills; and, simultaneously with their withdrawal, fresh bills  might be floated, and the horse-leech cry of the brokers for contango might be  satisfied until there came a reaction in the City, and the turning tide should  float him into some harbour of safety. Beyond this harbour shone a splendid  beacon, the dead girl&rsquo;s inheritance &mdash; his, to claim by right of the same will  that would give him the sum insured upon her life.</p>
<p>Without this immediate ready money there was no  extraction from the hideous labyrinth. His position had been already too long  sustained by bills of exchange. There were people in the City who wanted, in  vulgar parlance, to see the colour of his money. He knew this &mdash; and knew how  frail the tenure by which he held his position, and how dire the crash which  would hurl him down to ruin.</p>
<p>After the proclamation of his inability to meet his  differences &mdash; the Deluge: and, looking gloomily athwart the flood and tempest,  he saw neither ark nor Ararat.</p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s death was the one chance of redemption;  and to that event he looked as to a figure in a mathematical proposition. Of  this girl herself, with all her wealth of beauty and goodness, of hope and  love, he had scarcely any definite idea. She had so long been no more to him  than an important figure in the mathematics of his life, that he had lost the  power to behold her in any other light.</p>
<p>The hardness of his nature was something lower than  absolute cruelty of heart. It was less human than the half-insane ferocity of a  Nero. It was a calm indifference to the waste of human life, which, displayed  upon a larger field of operation, would have made a monster cold and  passionless as Sphinx or Chim&aelig;ra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see Ann Woolper,&rdquo; he said to himself,  presently, &ldquo;she will not dare to exclude me from that room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He listened to the striking of the Bayswater  clocks. Two o&rsquo;clock. Within and without the house reigned a profound silence.  The room immediately over Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s study was Charlotte&rsquo;s room, and here  there had been for a long time no sound of life or movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep, I dare say,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Sheldon,  &ldquo;invalid and nurse both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He exchanged his boots for slippers, which he kept  in a little cupboard below the bookshelves, among old newspapers, and went  softly from the room. The gas was burning dimly on the stairs and on the  landing above. He opened the door of the invalid&rsquo;s room softly, and went in.</p>
<p>Mrs. Woolper was seated beside the bed. She looked  up at him with unwinking eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you was abed, sir,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am too anxious to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think every one is anxious, sir,&rdquo; Mrs. Woolper  answered, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is your patient?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pretty white curtains of the little brass  Arabian bedstead were drawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is asleep, sir. She sleeps a great deal. The  doctor said that was only natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has taken her medicine, I suppose?&rdquo; said Mr.  Sheldon.</p>
<p>He glanced round the room as he asked this  question, but could see no trace of medicine-bottle or glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; she has taken it twice, the poor dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look at the medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strange doctor said as I was to let no one  touch it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely; but that direction doesn&rsquo;t apply to  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said no one, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an old fool!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Sheldon,  savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah no, sir,&rdquo; the housekeeper answered, with a  profound sigh; &ldquo;I am wiser than I was when poor Mr. Halliday died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This answer, and the sigh, and the look of solemn  sadness which accompanied it, told him that this woman knew all. She had  suspected him long ago; but against her unsupported suspicion the mere force of  his character had prevailed. She was wiser now; for on this occasion suspicion  was confirmed by the voice of science.</p>
<p>He stood for a few minutes looking at his old  nurse, with a dark moody face. What could he feel except supreme indignation  against this woman, who dared to oppose him when he had the best right to rely  on her faithful service? She had promised him her fidelity, and at the first  hint from a stranger she coolly deserted him and went over to the enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you refuse to let me look  at the medicine which you have been giving to my stepdaughter?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to say that I will obey the orders given me  by the strange doctor,&rdquo; the old woman answered, with a calm sadness of tone,  &ldquo;even if it turns you against me &mdash; you that have given me a comfortable home  when there was nothing before me but the workhouse; you that I carried in my  arms forty years ago. If it was anything less than her dear life that was in  danger, sir, and if I hadn&rsquo;t stood by her father&rsquo;s deathbed, I couldn&rsquo;t stand  against you like this. But knowing what I do, I will stand firm as a rock  between you and her; and think myself all the more truly your faithful servant  because I do not fear to offend you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so much arrant humbug, Mrs. Woolper. I  suppose you&rsquo;ve made your book with Miss Halliday and Miss Halliday&rsquo;s lover, and  think you can serve your turn best by sticking to them and throwing me over the  bridge. It&rsquo;s only the way of the world. You&rsquo;re genuine Yorkshire, and know how  to pack your cards for winning the trick. But suppose I were to spoil your game  by turning you out of doors neck and crop? What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll do that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you dare do it, in the face of that  strange doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t? And so Dr. Jedd is the master of this  house, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Till that poor dear young lady is well  again, if ever that day comes, I think Dr. Jedd will be the real master in this  house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By &mdash;&mdash; ! Mrs. Woolper, you&rsquo;re a cool hand, I must  say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could say no more. Of passionate or declamatory  language he had no command. The symbols of thought that obtained in his world  were of a limited and primitive range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cool hand,&rdquo; he repeated, under his  breath. And then he turned and left the room, opening and closing the door less  cautiously than on his entrance.</p>
<p>The door of the opposite room was opened softly as  he came out into the corridor, and Diana Paget stood before him, dressed as she  had been in the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed, impatiently, &ldquo;are you up  too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Sheldon. I cannot sleep while Lotta is so  ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I suppose you mean to get yourself on the  sick-list, and give us another invalid to nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not trouble you to nurse me if I should be  ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; growled the stockbroker, as he went to his  own room, &ldquo;you are a pack of silly women altogether; and your fine friend  Hawkehurst is more womanish than the silliest of you. Goodnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went into his own room, where he found his wife  still awake. Her weak lamentings and bewailings were insupportable to him; and  at three o&rsquo;clock he went downstairs, put on his boots and a light overcoat, and  went out into the dim regions of Bayswater, whence he saw the sun rise red  above the eastern roofs and chimneys, and where he walked until the first  clatter of hoofs and roll of wheels began to echo through the empty streets,  and, with faint distant cries of sweeps and milk-women, life&rsquo;s chorus  recommenced.</p>
<p>It was seven o&rsquo;clock when he went back to his  house, and let himself in softly with his latchkey. He knew that he had been  walking a long time, and that he had seen the sun rise; but what streets or  squares he had been walking in he did not know. He crept upstairs to his  dressing-room with stealthy footsteps, and made an elaborate toilet. At eight  o&rsquo;clock he was seated at breakfast in the hastily-arranged dining-room, with  the newspapers by the side of his cup and saucer. At nine he went into the hall  to receive Dr. Jedd and Dr. Doddleson, who arrived almost simultaneously. His  carefully-arranged hair and whiskers, his well made unpretentious clothes, his  spotless linen, would have done credit to an archbishop. Of all the cares and  calculations of his long dreary night there was no trace, except a certain  dulness in his eyes, and the dark half-circles below them.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter35"></a>Chapter 35<br>
  Counting The Cost</h2>
<p>For four days and four nights there were fear and  watching in Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s house; and in all that time the master never quitted  it, except stealthily, in the dead of the night, or at early daybreak, to roam  in a purposeless manner he knew not where. The doctors came and went &mdash; Dr.  Doddleson once a day, Dr. Jedd two or three times a day &mdash; and every one in  villas adjoining and villas opposite, and even in villas round the corner, knew  that the stockbroker&rsquo;s stepdaughter lay sick unto death; for the white horses  of Dr. Jedd&rsquo;s landau were as the pale horse of the Pale Rider himself, and  where they came was danger or death. Ah, thank God! to some they have brought  hope and blessing; not always the dread answer, &ldquo;You have called me in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine Hawkehurst came many times in the day,  but between him and Mr. Sheldon there could be no safe meeting; and the lover  came quietly to the little gate, where a kindly housemaid gave him a little  note from Diana Paget. Miss Paget wrote half a dozen little notes of this kind  in the course of every day, but she never left her post in the room opposite  the sick-chamber. She complained of headache, or of some vague illness which  prevented her taking her meals in the dining-room, and Mr. Sheldon was fain to  be satisfied with this explanation of her conduct.</p>
<p>She was on guard; and the wretched master of the  house knew that she was on guard, and that if Ann Woolper could be bought over,  or frightened into compliance with his wishes, this girl would still remain,  faithful as watchdog, by the door of her friend and companion. He asked himself  whether by violent or diplomatic process, he could rid himself of this second  watcher; and the answer was in the negative. The circle around him was a circle  not to be broken.</p>
<p>His wife, as yet, had been told nothing of the  suspicions that reigned in the breasts of other people. He knew this; for in  his wife&rsquo;s face there was no token of that dark knowledge, and she, of all  people, would be least skilled to deceive his scrutinizing eyes. Nor had the  younger servants of his household any share in the hideous suspicion. He had  watched the countenance of the maid who waited on him, and had convinced  himself of this.</p>
<p>It was something to know that even these were not  yet leagued against him; but he could not tell at what moment they too might be  sworn into that secret society which was growing up against him in his own  house. Power to carry out his own schemes in the face of these people he felt  that he had none. Upon the dark road which he had travelled until of late  without let or hindrance, there had arisen, all at once, an insurmountable  barrier, with the fatal inscription, Here there is no Thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Beyond this barrier he could not pass. Sudden as  the dread arrest of Lot&rsquo;s wife was the mandate which had checked his progress.  He was brought to a dead stop; and there was nothing for him to do but to wait  the issue of Fate. He stood, defiant, unabashed, face to face with the figure  of Nemesis, and calmly awaited the lifting of the veil.</p>
<p>He hoped that Charlotte Halliday would die. If by  her death he could tide over his difficulties and drift into smooth water, it  would be but a very small thing to him that Dr. Jedd, and Dr. Doddleson  enlightened by his colleague, and Valentine Hawkehurst, and Diana Paget, and a stupid  pig-headed old Yorkshirewoman, should carry in their minds for the remainder of  their lives the suspicion that by his means that fair young life had been  brought to its early close.</p>
<p>What would it amount to in the future of his own  existence? Prudential considerations would induce these people to lock the  secret of this suspicion in their own breasts. Dr. Jedd would bow to him  somewhat coldly, perhaps, if they met in the streets of London, or possibly  might refuse to make any return to his passing salutation; but the cut direct  from Dr. Jedd would not cast a shadow over his commercial career, or even  weaken his social position. If, by the loud folly of Hawkehurst, some evil  rumour about him should float as far eastward as the Stock Exchange, who would be  found to give credence to the dark report? Men would shrug their shoulders and  shake their heads incredulously; and one of these wise men of the east would  remark that, &ldquo;A fellow in Sheldon&rsquo;s position doesn&rsquo;t do that kind of thing, you  know;&rdquo; while another would say, &ldquo;I dined with him at Greenwich last summer, and  a remarkably good dinner he gave us. Dawkins, the great shipbuilder, and  M&rsquo;Pherson, of M&rsquo;Pherson and Flinders, the Glasgow merchants, were there. Very  jolly affair, I assure you. Deuced gentlemanly fellow, Phil Sheldon.&rdquo; And so  the matter would end.</p>
<p>Would there be an inquest in the event of his  stepdaughter&rsquo;s death? Well, no. Jedd knew that in such a case all <em>post-mortem</em> inquiry must end in  confusion and perplexity, statement and counter-statement from medical  witnesses, who would contradict one another persistently in the support of  their pet theories, and who would regard the investigation as a very convenient  opportunity for ventilating their own opinions and airing their own importance.  A considerable number of the canine race would be slaughtered, perhaps, in the  process of dilettante experiments; the broad principles of chemical science  would be discussed from every point of view, in innumerable letters published  in the <em>Zeus,</em> and the <em>Diurnal Hermes</em>; and the fact that an  amiable and innocent young woman had been foully murdered would be swept out of  the minds of mankind before a whirlwind of technical debate. Jedd was the last  man to stake his reputation upon such a hazard. No: Mr. Sheldon knew that he  had played a cautious game; and if he should ultimately lose the stake for  which he had ventured, it would be because he had been just a little too  cautious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These things are generally done too quickly,&rdquo; he  said to himself. &ldquo;My mistake has been to make matters too slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Come what might, of after-consequences to himself  from Charlotte
  Halliday&rsquo;s illness or death he had no apprehension.</p>
<p>Thus it was that he met Dr. Jedd day after day with  a face as calm as the stony countenance of that distinguished physician  himself. Such anxiety as an affectionate stepfather should feel during the  peril of his stepdaughter Mr. Sheldon took care to express. Greater anxiety  than this by no look or gesture did he betray. He knew that he was watched; and  that the people about him were inimical to himself and to his interests; and he  was never off his guard.</p>
<p>It had been necessary for him to come to London in  order to be within easy reach of that troubled sea, the money-market. But  perilous though the voyage of his bark across that tempestuous ocean was, he  could not guide the helm in person. He was obliged to confide matters to the  care of Mr. Frederick Orcott, whom he harassed with telegraphic despatches at  all hours of the day, and who at this period seemed to spend his life between  the stockbroker&rsquo;s office and Bayswater.</p>
<p>It seemed as if Mr. Sheldon meant to hold his  ground in that house until the issue of events was determined. Valentine  Hawkehurst and George Sheldon met at the solicitor&rsquo;s offices, and there was a  long and serious consultation between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing seems pretty clear,&rdquo; said George,  conclusively, &ldquo;and that is, that my brother Phil isn&rsquo;t to be got off the  premises except by some very deep move. The question is, what move can be deep  enough to trap such a man as he? He&rsquo;s a man who knows the inside of your mind  better than you do yourself; and can reckon you up as easily as the simplest  sum in arithmetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men talked together very seriously for some  time after this, and on the same day Valentine lay in wait for Dr. Jedd as he  left Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s house, and was driven back to town in that gentleman&rsquo;s  carriage. On the road there was much serious talk between Miss Halliday&rsquo;s  physician and Miss Halliday&rsquo;s lover. Valentine was still very grave and very  anxious when he took his leave of Dr. Jedd; but he was more hopeful than he had  been for the last few days.</p>
<p>On the same evening Gustave Lenoble received a  brief epistle from his plighted wife.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;MY DEAR GUSTAVE, &mdash; I regret to find from your  letter that the doctors consider my father weaker than when I was last at  Knightsbridge; but, even knowing this, I cannot come to him just yet. The duty  which detains me here is even more sacred than his claim upon my care. And I  know your goodness to him, and feel that in you he has a better friend and  comforter than I could be to him. I thank you, dear, for your kindness to this  poor broken-down wanderer even more than for your generous devotion to me. And  now I am going to ask you a favour. It is, that you will afford Mr. Hawkehurst,  the person who will give you this letter, the help of your friendship and  counsel in very difficult and critical circumstances, which he will explain to  you. I have spoken to you of him very little, though his devotion to my dear  adopted sister, Charlotte Halliday, brings him very near to me. Her long, and  of late dangerous, illness has been a bitter time of trial to him, even more  than to me; but the trial has proved him true as steel. I think your counsel  may be of some service to him just now, and I am sure your friendship will help  to support him in a period of acute anxiety.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Do not ask to see me, dear Gustave. I <em>cannot</em> leave this house while Charlotte  is in danger; but if it please God to remove that danger, I shall then be free  to go where I please, and my future life shall be at your disposal. Do not  think me cold or ungrateful; I am only faithful to the first friend I ever  knew. &mdash; Yours always, with all affection,</p>
<p class="note"><strong>&ldquo;</strong>DIANA PAGET.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="Chapter36"></a>Chapter 36<br>
  The Beginning Of The End</strong> </h2>
<p>Three days elapsed after the delivery of this  letter. Upwards of a week had gone by since the return of Mr. Sheldon and his  family from Harold&rsquo;s Hill: and as yet Philip Sheldon knew not what the issue of  events was to be. Very vague were the oracular sentences which his questioning  extorted from Dr. Jedd, and he had tried in vain to obtain a <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> interview with Dr.  Doddleson. The physician of Burlington Row took care that his feeble colleague  should not fall alone and defenceless into the pathway of Philip Sheldon. Of  Charlotte&rsquo;s actual condition her stepfather, therefore, knew very little. He  was told that her state was attended by danger; and the solemn faces which  greeted him on every side implied that the danger was extreme. From her room he  was in a manner excluded. If he went to her door to make some benevolent and  paternal inquiry, he was met on the threshold by Ann Woolper, the sleepless and  unresting. If he hinted a natural desire to see his invalid stepdaughter, he  was told that she had that moment fallen asleep, or that she was too ill to see  him. There was always some plausible reason why he should not be admitted to  her room; and finding that this was so, he did not press the question.</p>
<p>He had taken Mrs. Woolper&rsquo;s measure, and had found  that she was too strong for him; doubly strong since she was supported and  sustained by that second sleepless watcher, Diana Paget, whom Mr. Sheldon had  long ago pronounced to be a strong-minded and superior young person.</p>
<p>From his wife he could obtain no real information &mdash;  nothing but weepings and lamentations; weak apprehensions of future woe, weaker  retrospective reflections on the fatal illness and untimely end of her first  husband. Georgy was admitted once or twice a day to the sick-room; but she  emerged therefrom no wiser than she entered it. Sorrow in the present, and the  fear of greater sorrow to come, had utterly prostrated this poor weak soul. She  believed what other people told her to believe, she hoped what they told her to  hope. She was the very incarnation and express image of helpless misery.</p>
<p>So, in utter darkness of mind, Mr. Sheldon awaited  his destiny. The day drew very near on which he must find certain sums of ready  money, or must accept the dreary alternative of ruin and disgrace. He had the  policies of assurance in his cash-box, together with the will which made him  Charlotte&rsquo;s sole legatee; he had fixed in his own mind upon the man to whom he  could apply for an advance of four thousand pounds on one of the two policies,  and he relied on getting his banker to lend him money on the security of the  second. But for the one needful event he had yet to wait. That event was  Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Of his dreary wanderings in the early morning the  household knew nothing. The time which he chose for these purposeless rambles  was just the time when no one was astir. The watchers in the two rooms above  heard neither his going out nor his coming in, so stealthy were his movements  on every occasion. But without this intermission from the dreadful  concentration of his life, without this amount of physical exercise and fresh  air, Philip Sheldon could scarcely have lived through this period. The solitude  of shipwrecked mariner cast upon a desolate island could hardly be more lonely  than this man&rsquo;s life had been since his return from Harold&rsquo;s Hill. From his  study to the dining-room, and from the dining-room back to his study, was the  only variety of his dreary days and nights. He had an iron bedstead put up in  his study, and there he lay in the earlier hours of the night, taking such rest  as he could from fitful dozing that was scarcely sleep, or from brief intervals  of heavy slumber made horrible by torturing dreams.</p>
<p>In this room he could hear every sudden movement in  the hall, every footstep on the stairs, every opening and shutting of the outer  door. Here, too, he could keep his watch, holding himself ready to counter the  movements of his enemies, should any opportunity arise for action on his part,  defensive or aggressive.</p>
<p>To this room he stealthily returned one brilliant  summer morning as the clocks were striking six. He had been walking in the  Bayswater Road, amidst all the pleasant stir and bustle of early morning.  Waggons coming in from the country, milkwomen setting forth on their daily  rounds, clamorous young rooks cawing among the topmost branches of the elms,  song-birds chirruping and gurgling their glad morning hymn; and over all things  the glory and the freshness of the summer sunshine.</p>
<p>But to Philip Sheldon it was as if these things  were not. For the last twelve or fifteen years of his life he had taken no heed  of the change of the seasons, except insomuch as the passage of time affected  his bill-book, or the condition of that commercial world which was the  beginning and end of his life. Now, less than ever, had he an ear for the  carolling of birds, or an eye for the glory of summer sunlight, or the  flickering shadows of summer leaves faintly stirred by the soft summer wind.</p>
<p>He re-entered his house with a half-dazed sense of  the stir and life that had been about him in the high road. It was a relief to  him to escape this life and brightness, and to take shelter in the gloom of his  study, where the shutters were closed, and only a faint glimmer of day crept  through a chink in the shrunken woodwork.</p>
<p>For the first time since the beginning of this  dreary period of idleness and suspense he felt himself thoroughly beaten, and  instead of going up to his dressing-room for his careful morning toilet, as it  was his habit to do at this hour, he flung himself, dressed as he was, upon the  low iron bedstead, and fell into a heavy slumber.</p>
<p>Yes, there they were &mdash; the familiar tortures of his  slumbers, the shadows of busy, eager faces; and upon all one universal  expression of mingled anger and surprise. The sound of a wooden hammer striking  three solemn strokes; the faint tones of Tom Halliday&rsquo;s voice, thanking him for  his friendly care; the dying look in Tom Halliday&rsquo;s face, turned to him with  such depth of trust and affection. And then across the shadowy realm of dreams  there swept the slow solemn progress of a funeral <em>cortege</em> &mdash; plumed hearses, blacker than blackest night; innumerable  horses, with funereal trappings and plumed headgear waving in an icy wind; long  trains of shrouded figures stretching on into infinite space, in spectral procession  that knew neither beginning nor end. And in all the solemn crowd passing  perpetually with the same unceasing motion, there was no sound of human  footfall, no tramp of horse&rsquo;s hoof, only that dismal waving of black plumage in  an icy wind, and the deep boom of a bell tolling for the dead.</p>
<p>He awoke with a start, and exclaimed, &ldquo;If this is  what it is to sleep, I will never sleep again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the next minute he recovered himself. He had  been lying on his back. The endless pageant, the dreadful tolling of the  funeral bell, meant no more than nightmare, the common torment of all humanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool I must be!&rdquo; he muttered to himself, as  he wiped his forehead, which had grown cold and damp in the agony of his dream.</p>
<p>He opened the shutters, and then looked at the  clock on the mantelpiece. To his surprise he found that he had been sleeping  three hours. It was nine o&rsquo;clock. He went upstairs to dress. There was an  unusual stir in the corridor above. Ann Woolper was standing there, with her  hand on the door of the sick-room, talking to Diana, who covered her face  suddenly as he approached, and disappeared into her own room.</p>
<p>The beating of his heart quickened suddenly.  Something had happened to disturb the common course of events. Something? What  was likely to happen, except the one dread circumstance for which he hoped and  waited with such horrible eagerness?</p>
<p>In Ann Woolper&rsquo;s solemn face he read an answer to  his thought. For the first time he was well nigh losing his self-possession. It  was with an effort that he steadied himself sufficiently to ask the usual  conventional question in the usual conventional tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she any better this morning, Ann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, she is much better,&rdquo; the Yorkshirewoman  answered solemnly. &ldquo;She is where none can harm her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes; it was the usual periphrase of these vulgar  people. He knew all their cant by heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say &mdash; she &mdash; is dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He no longer tried to conceal his agitation. It was  a part of his duty to be agitated by the news of his stepdaughter&rsquo;s untimely  death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, sir, you may well be sorry,&rdquo; said the  Yorkshirewoman, with deep feeling. &ldquo;She was the sweetest, most forgiving  creature that ever came into this world; and to the last no hard or cruel word  ever passed her innocent lips. Yes, sir, she is gone; she is beyond the power  of any one to harm her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that sort of stuff is so much hypocritical  twaddle, Mrs. Woolper,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Sheldon impatiently; &ldquo;and I recommend you  to keep it for the chaplain of the workhouse in which you are likely to end  your days. At what time &mdash; did &mdash; did this &mdash; sad event &mdash; happen?</p>
<p>&ldquo;About an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the very hour when, in his hideous dream, he had  beheld the solemn funeral train winding on for ever through the dim realms of  sleep. Was there some meaning in such foolish shadows, after all?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why was I not sent for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were asleep, sir. I came downstairs myself,  and looked into your room. You were fast asleep, and I wouldn&rsquo;t disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very wrong; but it was of a piece with  the rest of your
  conduct, which has been from first to last antagonistic to me. I suppose
  I can see my stepdaughter now,&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon added, with a grim smile.&ldquo;There is no further excuse &mdash; about headache &mdash; or sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, you cannot see her yet. In an hour, if  you wish to come into this room, you can come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are extremely obliging. I begin to doubt  whether I am really in my own house. In an hour, then, I will come. Where is my  wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In her own room, sir, lying down; asleep, I  believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not disturb her. How about the registration,  by-the-by? That must be seen to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Jedd has promised to attend to that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Dr. Jedd been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was here an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good. And he will see to that,&rdquo; muttered Mr.  Sheldon thoughtfully.</p>
<p>The event for which he had been so long waiting  seemed at the last a little sudden. It had shaken his nerves more than he had  supposed it possible that they could be shaken.</p>
<p>He went to his dressing-room, and on this occasion  made a very hasty toilet. The event had been tardy, and he had no time to lose  in discounting it now that it had come to pass. He went from his dressing-room  back to his study, took the jacket containing the policies of assurance and the  will from the deed-box, and left the house.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter37"></a>Chapter 37<br>
  Confusion Worse Confounded</h2>
<p>A cab conveyed Mr. Sheldon swiftly to a dingy  street in the City &mdash; a street which might have been called the pavement of  wasted footsteps, so many an impecunious wretch tramped to and fro upon those  dreary flags in vain.</p>
<p>The person whom Mr. Sheldon came to see was a distinguished  bill-discounter, who had served him well in more than one crisis, and on whose  service he fancied he could now rely.</p>
<p>Mr. Kaye, the bill-discounter, was delighted to see  his worthy friend Mr. Sheldon. He had just come up from his family at Brighton,  and had quite a little court awaiting him in an outer chamber, through which  Mr. Sheldon had been ushered to the inner office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather early for such a visitor as you,&rdquo; Mr.  Kaye said, after a few commonplaces. &ldquo;I have not been in town half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My business is too important for any consideration  about hours,&rdquo; answered Mr. Sheldon, &ldquo;or I should not be here at all. I have  just come from the deathbed of my wife&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed the bill-discounter, looking  inexpressibly shocked. Until that moment he had lived in supreme ignorance of  the fact that Mr. Sheldon had a stepdaughter; but his sorrow-stricken  expression of countenance might have implied that he had known and esteemed the  young lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very sad,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon; &ldquo;and  something more than sad for me. The poor girl had great expectations, and would  have come into a very fine fortune if she had lived a year or two longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! dear me, how very unfortunate! Poor young  lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jedd and Doddleson &mdash; you know them by repute, of  course &mdash; have been attending her for the last six weeks. There will be no end  of expense for me; and it has been all of no use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumption, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no; not pulmonary disease. A kind of  atrophy. I scarcely know what to call it. Now, look here, Kaye. This illness  has thrown all my affairs into a muddle. Taken in conjunction with the  depressed state of the money-market, it has been altogether an upset for me. I  have been staying at home looking after this poor girl and my wife &mdash; who of  course is dreadfully cut up, and that sort of thing &mdash; when I ought to have been  in the City. Luckily for me, and for my wife, in whose interests I acted, I  took the precaution to get her daughter&rsquo;s life insured eight or nine months  ago; in point of fact, immediately after finding she was heir-at-law to a  considerable fortune. The policy is for five thousand pounds. I want you to  give me four thousand immediately upon the strength of the document and of my  stepdaughter&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give you four thousand!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Kaye, with  a little unctuous laugh. &ldquo;Do you suppose I keep such a balance as that at my  banker&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that you can give me the money if you  like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might be able to get it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s a kind of humbug a hundred years old.  We&rsquo;ve heard all about little Premium and his friend in the City, and so on,  from that man who wrote plays and cut a figure in Parliament. You can give me  the money on the spot if you like, Kaye; and if I didn&rsquo;t want ready money very  badly I shouldn&rsquo;t come to you. The insurance company will give me five thousand  in a month or two. I can give you my bill at two months&rsquo; date, and deposit the  policy in your hands as collateral security. I might get this money from other  quarters &mdash; from my bankers&rsquo;, for instance; but I don&rsquo;t want to let them know  too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kaye deliberated. He had assisted Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  financial operations, and had profited thereby. Money advanced upon such a  security must be as safe as money invested in Consols, unless there were  anything doubtful in the circumstances of the policy; and that, with a man of  Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s respectability, was to the last degree unlikely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you want this money?&rdquo; he asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of next week. On the twenty-fifth  at latest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the twentieth. Sharp work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. You could give me the money this  afternoon, if you pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll think it over. It&rsquo;s a matter in which I  feel myself bound to take my solicitor&rsquo;s opinion. Suppose you meet him here  to-morrow at twelve o&rsquo;clock? You can bring the necessary evidence to support  the claim &mdash; the doctor&rsquo;s and registrar&rsquo;s certificate, and so on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon answered, thoughtfully; &ldquo;I will  bring the documentary evidence. To-morrow at twelve, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very little more was said. Mr. Sheldon left the  will and the policy in the bill-discounter&rsquo;s possession, and departed. Things  had gone as smoothly as he could fairly expect them to go. From Mr. Kaye&rsquo;s  office he went to the Unitas Bank, where he had a very friendly, but not  altogether satisfactory, interview with the secretary. He wanted the Unitas  people to advance him money on the strength of the second policy of assurance;  but his balance had been very low of late, and the secretary could not promise  compliance with his desires. Those Unitas shares valued at five thousand  pounds, which he had transferred to his beloved stepdaughter, had been  retransferred by the young lady some months before, with a view to the more  profitable investment of the money.</p>
<p>This money, as well as all else that Philip Sheldon  could command, had gone to the same bottomless pit of unlucky speculation. From  the bank the stockbroker went to his office, where he saw Frederick Orcott, to  whom he announced his stepdaughter&rsquo;s death with all due appearance of sorrow.  He sat for an hour in his office, arranging his affairs for the following day,  then sent for another cab, and drove back to Bayswater. The noonday press and  noise of the City seemed strange to him, almost as they might have seemed to a  man newly returned from lonely wanderings in distant wildernesses.</p>
<p>The blinds were down at the Lawn. His own handsome  bedchamber and adjoining dressing-room faced the road, and it was at the  windows of these two rooms he looked. He fancied his weak foolish wife wailing  and lamenting behind those lowered blinds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shall have to endure her lamentations,&rdquo; he  thought, with a shudder. &ldquo;I shall have no further excuse for avoiding her. But,  on the other hand, I shall have the pleasure of giving Mrs. Woolper and Miss  Paget notice to quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He derived a grim satisfaction from this thought.  Yes; insolence from those two women he would endure no longer. The time had  come in which he would assert his right to be master in his own house. The game  had been played against him boldly by Jedd and these people, and had been lost  by them. He was the winner. He could not dismiss doctors, nurse, friend, lover.  Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s death made him master of the situation.</p>
<p>He went into his house with the determination to  assert his authority at once. Within all was very quiet. He looked into the  dining-room &mdash; it was quite empty; into the study &mdash; also empty. He went slowly  upstairs, composing his face into the appropriate expression. At the door of  that chamber which to him should have seemed of all earthly chambers the most  awful, he knocked softly.</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>He knocked a little louder, but there was still no  answer. A little louder again, and with the same result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no one there?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;No one,  except &mdash; ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door, and went in, with unshaken  nerves, to look upon that one quiet sleeper whom his summons could not awaken,  whom his presence could not disturb.</p>
<p>There was no nurse or watcher by the bed.  Everything was arranged with extreme neatness and precision; but it seemed to  him that there were objects missing in the room, objects that had been familiar  to him during the dead girl&rsquo;s illness, and which were associated with her  presence, &mdash; the clock that had stood on the table by her bed, a stand of books,  a low easy-chair, with embroidered cover worked by her mother and Diana Paget.  The room looked blank and empty without these things, and Mr. Sheldon wondered  what officious hand had removed them.</p>
<p>Yonder stood the pretty little bedstead, shrouded  by closely drawn white curtains. Philip Sheldon walked slowly across the room,  and drew aside one of the curtains. He had looked upon the death-sleep of  Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s father, why not upon hers?</p>
<p>She was not there! Those closely drawn curtains  shrouded only the bed on which she had slept in the tranquil slumbers of her  careless girlhood. That cold lifeless form, whose rigid outline Philip Sheldon  had steeled himself to see, had no place here.</p>
<p>He put his hand to his head, bewildered. &ldquo;What does  it mean?&rdquo; he asked himself; &ldquo;surely she died in this room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went hurriedly to his wife&rsquo;s room. They had  taken Charlotte there, perhaps, shortly before her death. Some feverish fancy  might have possessed her with the desire to be taken thither.</p>
<p>He opened the door and went in; but here again all  was blank and empty. The room was arranged after its usual fashion; but of his  wife&rsquo;s presence there was no token. His sense of mystification and bewilderment  grew suddenly into a sense of fear. What did it mean? What hellish fooling had  he been the dupe of?</p>
<p>He went to Diana&rsquo;s room. That, too, was empty. A  trunk and a portmanteau, covered and strapped as if for removal, occupied the  centre of the room.</p>
<p>There was no other room upon this floor. Above this  floor there were only the rooms of the servants.</p>
<p>He went downstairs to the dining-room and rang the  bell The parlour-maid came in answer to his summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your mistress?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone out, sir; she went at eight o&rsquo;clock this  morning. And O, if you please, sir, Dr. Jedd called, and said I was to give you  this &mdash; with the certificate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The certificate! Yes, the certificate of Charlotte  Halliday&rsquo;s death, &mdash; the certificate which he must produce to-morrow, with other  evidence, for the satisfaction of the bill-discounter and his legal adviser. He  stared at the girl, still possessed by the sense of bewilderment which had come  upon him on seeing those empty rooms upstairs. He took the letter from her  almost mechanically, and tore it open without looking at the address. The  certificate dropped to the ground. He picked it up with a tremulous hand, and  for some moments stood staring at it with dazzled, unseeing eyes. He could see  that it was a document with dates and names written in a clerkly hand. For some  moments he could see no more. And then words and names shone out of the  confusion of letters that spun and whirled, like motes in the sunshine, before  his dazzled eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine Hawkehurst, bachelor, author, Carlyle  Terrace, Edgware Road, son of Arthur Hawkehurst, journalist; Charlotte Halliday,  spinster, of the Lawn, Bayswater, daughter of Thomas Halliday, farmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read no more.</p>
<p>It was a copy of a certificate of marriage &mdash; not a  certificate of death &mdash; that had been brought to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go,&rdquo; he said to the servant hoarsely.</p>
<p>He had a vague consciousness that she was staring  at him with curious looks, and that it was not good for him to be watched by  any one just now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About dinner, sir, if you please?&rdquo; the young woman  began timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I know about dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will dine at home, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dine at home? Yes; Mrs. Woolper can give you your  orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Woolper has gone out, sir. She has gone for  good, I believe, sir; she took her boxes. And Miss Paget&rsquo;s luggage will be sent  for, if you please, sir. There&rsquo;s a letter, sir, that Mrs. Woolper left for you  on the mantelpiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was very good. That will do; you can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl departed, bewildered like her  fellow-servants by the strangeness of the day&rsquo;s proceedings, still more  bewildered by the strangeness of her master&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter38"></a>Chapter 38<br>
  &ldquo;There Is A Word Will Priam Turn To Stone&rdquo;</h2>
<p>When the servant was gone, Mr. Sheldon sat down and  examined the document she had given him.</p>
<p>Yes, it was in due form. A certified copy of the  certificate of a marriage performed that morning at the church of St.  Matthias-in-the-fields, Paddington, and duly witnessed by the registrar of that  parish. If this document were indeed genuine, as to all appearance it was,  Valentine Hawkehurst and Charlotte Halliday had been married that morning; and  the will and the policy of assurance deposited with Mr. Kaye the  bill-discounter were so much waste-paper.</p>
<p>And they had fooled him, Philip Sheldon, as easily  as this! The furious rage which he felt against all these people, and, more  than against them, against his own besotted folly for allowing himself to be so  fooled, was a sharper agony than had ever yet rent his cruel heart. He had been  a scoundrel all his life, and had felt some of the pains and penalties of his  position; but to be a defeated scoundrel was a new sensation to him; and a  savage impotent hate and anger against himself and the universe took possession  of his mind.</p>
<p>He walked up and down the room for some time,  abandoned wholly to the ungovernable rage that consumed him, and with no  thought beyond that blind useless fury. And then there came upon him the  feeling that was almost a part of his mind &mdash; the consciousness that something  must be done, and promptly. Whatever his position was, he must face it. His  hurried pacing to and fro came to a sudden stop, and he took the crumpled  document from his packet, and examined it once more.</p>
<p>There seemed little doubt that it was genuine; and  a visit to the church where the marriage was stated to have been performed  would immediately place the matter beyond all doubt. With the copy of the  certificate, he had taken from his pocket the letter that had enclosed it. He  saw now that the envelope was addressed in Hawkehurst&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Favoured by Dr. Jedd,&rdquo; he had written in a corner  of the envelope.</p>
<p>Why should Dr. Jedd &ldquo;favour&rdquo; Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s  letter? Why, indeed, unless there had been a conspiracy concocted by these men  against his authority and his interests?</p>
<p>Valentine&rsquo;s letter was brief and business-like.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;SIR, &mdash; With the full approbation of her mother and  only near relation, my dear Charlotte has this day become my wife. The enclosed  attested copy of the certificate of our marriage will afford you all  particulars. I shall refrain from entering upon any explanation of my conduct;  and I believe such explanation to be wholly unnecessary. You can scarcely fail  to understand why I have acted in this manner, and why I congratulate myself  and my dear wife on her departure from your house as on an escape from imminent  peril. It will be, I fear, little satisfaction to you to hear that the doctors  have pronounced your stepdaughter to be out of danger, though still in very  weak health. She is now comfortably established in a temporary home, with her  mother and Diana Paget; and in all probability some months must elapse before  she and I can begin our new life together. To afford my darling girl the legal  protection of marriage was the object of this sudden and secret union. You, of  all men, will most fully comprehend how necessary such protection had become to  ensure her safety.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Should you, however, require farther enlightenment  as to the motives that prompted this step, Dr. Jedd will be the fittest person  to give you such information; and has expressed his willingness to answer any  questions you may please to put to him.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;For the rest, I beg to assure you that the rights  of Mrs. Hawkehurst in relation to the inheritance of the late John Haygarth&rsquo;s  wealth will be as carefully protected as those of Miss Halliday; nor will the  hasty marriage of this morning hinder the execution of any deed of settlement  calculated to guard her interests in the future.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;With this assurance, I remain, sir,<br>
  Your obedient servant,<br>
  VALENTINE HAWKEHURST.<br>
  Carlyle Terrace, Edgware Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enclosed with this there was a second letter &mdash; from  his wife.</p>
<p>He read it with a countenance that expressed  mingled anger and contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;this is about the only  service she could do me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter was long and incoherent; blotted with  tears &mdash; in places completely illegible. Mr. Sheldon cared only to master the  main facts contained in it, which were these: &mdash; His wife had left him for ever.  Dr. Jedd and Valentine Hawkehurst had told her of something &mdash; something that  affected the safety of her darling and only child &mdash; and the knowledge of which  must separate her for ever from him. Of the money which she had brought to him  she claimed nothing. Even her jewels, which were in his keeping, in the iron  safe where he kept his papers, she did not attempt to obtain from him.  Valentine would not allow her to starve. The humblest shelter, the poorest  food, would suffice her in the future; but no home of his providing could she  ever inhabit again.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;What I have suffered in this last few days is only  known to myself and to heaven,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;O Philip, how could you &mdash; how could  you even shape the thought of such a deed as this, which you have been doing,  day after day, for the last two months? I could not have believed what they  have told me, if I had not seen my child fade hour by hour under your care,  slowly, surely &mdash; and recover as surely directly you were excluded from any part  in our care of her. If it were possible not to believe these people, I would  disbelieve them, and would cling to you faithfully still; but the voices  against you are too many, the proofs against you are too strong.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Do not seek to see me. I am with my poor child,  who was but just able to bear the removal from your house, and to go through  the ceremony that was performed this morning. Little did I ever think my  daughter would have such a wedding. What a mockery all my plans seem now! &mdash; and  I had chosen the six bridesmaids, and arranged all the dresses in my own mind.  To see my dear girl dressed anyhow, in her oldest bonnet, standing before the  altar huddled up in a shawl, and given away by a strange doctor, who kept  looking at his watch in a most disrespectful manner during the ceremony, was  very bitter to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon flung aside the letter with an oath. He  had no time to waste upon such twaddle as this. He tore open Nancy Woolper&rsquo;s  letter. It was a poor honest scrawl, telling him how faithfully she had served  him, how truly she had loved him in the past, and how she could henceforth  serve him no more. It exhorted him, in humble ill-spelt phrases, to repentance.  It might not yet be too late even for such a sinner as he had been.</p>
<p>He tore these two epistles into infinitesimal  fragments, and flung them into the fireplace. Valentine Hawkehurst&rsquo;s letter he  kept. It was a document of some legal importance.</p>
<p>For a moment there had flashed across his brain the  thought that he might punish these people for their interference with his  affairs. He might bring an action against Dr. Jedd for slander, and compel the  physician to prove the charges insinuated against him, or pay the penalty  attendant upon an unjustifiable accusation. He was well assured that Dr. Jedd  could prove very little; and a jury, if properly worked, might award him  exemplary damages.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the circumstantial evidence  against him was very strong; and evidence which might be insufficient to prove  him guilty in a trial for his life might be a sufficient defence for his  enemies against an action for slander; if, indeed, the course which Dr. Jedd  and Valentine Hawkehurst had taken did in itself constitute a slanderous and  malicious imputation. Nor could any such action invalidate the marriage  solemnized that morning; and that one fact comprised his utter ruin.  Charlotte&rsquo;s interests were merged in the interests of her husband. No shadow of  claim upon John Haygarth&rsquo;s wealth remained to him.</p>
<p>His ruin was complete and dire. For a long time his  circumstances had been desperate &mdash; no avenue of escape open to him but the one  dark way which he had trodden; and now that last road was closed against him.  The day was very near at hand when his fictitious bills on shadowy companies  must be dishonoured; and with the dishonour of those bills came the end of all  things for him, &mdash; a complete revelation of all those dishonest artifices by  which he had kept his piratical bark afloat on the commercial waters.</p>
<p>He surveyed his position in every light, calmly and  deliberately, and saw there was no hope. The whole scheme of his existence was  reduced to the question of how much ready-money he could carry out of that  house in his pocket, and in what direction he should betake himself after  leaving it.</p>
<p>His first care must be to ascertain whether the  marriage described in the duplicate certificate had really taken place; his  next, to repossess himself of the papers left with Mr. Kaye.</p>
<p>Before leaving the house he went to his study,  where he examined his banker&rsquo;s book. Yes, it was as they had told him at the  bank. He was overdrawn. Among the letters lying unopened on his writing-table  he found a letter from one of the officials of the Unitas, calling his  attention, politely and respectfully, to that oversight upon his part. He read  the letter, and crumpled it into his pocket with an angry gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am just about as well off now as I was twelve  years ago, before Tom Halliday came to Fitzgeorge Street,&rdquo; he said to himself;  &ldquo;and I have the advantage of being twelve years older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, this is what it all came to, after all. He had  been travelling in a circle. The discovery was humiliating. Mr. Sheldon began  to think that his line of life had not been a paying one.</p>
<p>He opened his iron safe, and forced the lock of the  jewel-case in which his wife had kept the few handsome ornaments that he had  given her in the early days of their marriage, as a reward for being good &mdash;  that is to say, for allowing her second husband to dispose of her first  husband&rsquo;s patrimony without let or hindrance. The jewels were only a few rings,  a brooch, a pair of earrings, and a bracelet; but they were good of their kind,  and in all worth something like two hundred pounds.</p>
<p>These, and the gold chronometer which he carried in  his waistcoat-pocket, constituted all the worldly wealth which Mr. Sheldon  could command, now that the volcanic ground upon which his commercial position  had been built began to crumble beneath his feet, and the bubbling of the  crater warned him of his peril. He put the trinkets into his pocket without  compunction, and then went upstairs to his dressing-room, where he proceeded to  pack his clothes in a capacious portmanteau, which in itself might constitute  his credentials among strangers, so eminently respectable was its appearance.</p>
<p>In this dread crisis of his life he thought of  everything that affected his own interests. To what was he going? That question  was for the moment unanswerable. In every quarter of the globe there are happy  hunting-grounds for the soldier of fortune. Some plan for the future would  shape itself in his mind by-and-by. His wife&rsquo;s desertion had left him  thoroughly independent. He had no tie to restrain his movements, nothing to  dread except such proceedings as might be taken against him by the holders of  those bills. And such proceedings are slow, while modern locomotion is swift.</p>
<p>What was he leaving? That was easily answered. A  labyrinth of debt and difficulty. The fine house, the handsome furniture, were  held in the same bondage of the law as his household goods in Fitzgeorge Street  had been. He had given a bill of sale upon everything he possessed six months  before, to obtain ready-money. The final terrible resource had not been  resorted to until all other means had been exhausted. Let this fact at least be  recorded to his credit. He was like the lady whom the poet sings, who,</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&rdquo;tolerably mild,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a wash would <em>hardly</em> boil a child:&rdquo;</p>
<p>that is to say, she would try all other materials  for her cosmetic preparation first; and if they failed, would at last resort,  unwillingly, to the boiling of children.</p>
<p>No; he had nothing to lose by flight &mdash; of that fact  it was easy for him to assure himself.</p>
<p>He went downstairs, and rang for the servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to join my wife and her  daughter, and return with them to the sea-side. There is a portmanteau upstairs  in my room, ready packed. You will give it to the messenger I shall send in the  course of the next day or two. At what time did Mrs. Sheldon and Miss Halliday  leave this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock, sir. Mr. Hawkehurst came to  fetch them in a carriage. They went out by the kitchen passage and the side  gate, sir, because you were asleep, Mrs. Woolper said, and was not to be  disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At eight. Yes. And Mrs. Woolper and Miss Paget?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went a&rsquo;most directly after you was gone out,  sir. There was two cabs to take Miss Halliday&rsquo;s and Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s things, and  such like, &mdash; just as there was when you came from Harold&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was half inclined to ask the young woman if she  had heard the direction given to the drivers of these two cabs. But he  refrained from doing so. What could it profit him to know where his wife and  stepdaughter were to be found? Whether they were in the next street or at the  antipodes could matter very little to him, except so far as the knowledge of  their place of habitation might guide him in his avoidance of them. Between him  and them there was a gulf wider than all the waters of the world, and to  consider them was only foolish waste of time and thought. He left the house,  which for the last five years of his life had been the outward and visible sign  of his social status, fully conscious that he left it for ever; and he left it  without a sigh. For him the word home had no tender associations, and the  domestic hearth had never inspired him with any sense of comfort or pleasure  with which he might not have been inspired by the luxurious fireside of a  first-class coffee-room. He was a man who would have chosen to spend his existence  in joint-stock hotels, if there had not been solidity of position to be  acquired from the possession of a handsome house.</p>
<p>He went to the Paddington church. It was only five  o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon by the clock of that edifice. The church was closely  shut, but Mr. Sheldon found the clerk, who, in consideration of a handsome  donation, took him to the vestry, and there showed him the register of  marriages &mdash; the last entry therein.</p>
<p>Yes, there was Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s signature, a  little uncertain and tremulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are one of the young lady&rsquo;s  relations, sir,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;It was rather a strange affair; but the young  lady&rsquo;s ma was with her; and the young lady was over age, so, you see, there&rsquo;s  nothing to be said against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon had nothing to say against the  marriage. If any false statement of his, however base or cruel, could have  invalidated the ceremonial, he would have spared no pains to devise such a  falsehood. If he had been a citizen of the Southern States, he might have suborned  witnesses to prove that there was black blood in the veins of Valentine  Hawkehurst. If he had not been opposed to so strong an opponent as Dr. Jedd, he  might have tried to get a commission of lunacy to declare Charlotte Halliday a  madwoman, and thus invalidate her marriage. As it was, he knew that he could do  nothing. He had failed. All was said in those three words.</p>
<p>He wasted no time at the church, but hurried on to  the City, where he was just in time to catch Mr. Kaye leaving his office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you sent those papers to your solicitor?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I was just going to take them round to him. I  have been thinking that it will be necessary to ascertain that there is no will  of Miss Halliday&rsquo;s subsequent to this; and that will be rather difficult to  find out. Women never know when to leave off making wills, if they once begin  making them. They have a positive rage for multiplying documents, you know. If  the testator in that great codicil case had been a woman, a jury would scarcely  have refused to believe in the story of half a dozen different codicils hidden  away in half a dozen different holes and corners. Women like that sort of  thing. Of course, I quite understand that you bring me the will in all good  faith; but I foresee difficulties in raising money upon such a security.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need give yourself no further trouble about  the matter,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon coolly. &ldquo;I find that I can do without the money,  and I&rsquo;ve come to reclaim the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Kaye handed them to his client. He was not  altogether pleased by this turn of affairs; for he had expected to profit  considerably by Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s necessities. That gentleman honoured him with no  further explanations, but put the papers in his pocket, and wished the  bill-discounter good day.</p>
<p>And this was the last time that Philip Sheldon was  ever seen in his character of a solid and respectable citizen of London. He  went from the bill-discounter&rsquo;s office to a pawnbroker in the City, with whom  he pledged Georgy&rsquo;s trinkets and his own watch for the sum of a hundred and  twenty pounds. From the pawnbroker&rsquo;s he went back to Bayswater for his  portmanteau, and thence to the Euston Hotel, where he dined temperately in the  coffee-room. After dinner he went out into the dull back streets that lurk  behind Euston Square, and found an obscure little barber&rsquo;s shop, where he had  his whiskers shaved off, and his hyacinthine locks cropped as close as the  barber&rsquo;s big scissors could crop them.</p>
<p>The sacrifice of these hirsute adornments made an  extraordinary change in this man. All the worst characteristics of his  countenance came out with a new force; and the face of Mr. Sheldon, undisguised  by the whiskers that had hidden the corners of his mouth, or the waving locks  that had given height and breadth to his forehead, was a face that no one would  be likely to trust.</p>
<p>From the Euston Station he departed by the night  mail for Liverpool, under the cover of darkness. In that city he quietly  awaited the departure of the Cunard steamer for New York, and was so fortunate  as to leave England one day before that fatal date on which the first of his  fictitious bills arrived at maturity.</p>

  Harbour, After Many Shipwrecks</em></h1>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter39"></a>Chapter 39<br>
  Out Of The Dark Valley</h2>
<p>Not with pomp or with splendour, with rejoicing or  strewing of summer blossoms in the pathway of bride and bridegroom, had the  marriage of Valentine and Charlotte been solemnized. Simple and secret had been  the ceremonial, dark with clouds was the sky above them; and yet it is doubtful  if happier bridegroom ever trod this earth than Valentine Hawkehurst as he went  to his lonely lodging under the starry summer sky, after leaving his young wife  to her mother&rsquo;s care in the new home that had been found for them.</p>
<p>He had reason to rejoice; for he had passed through  the valley of the shadow of death. He had seen, very near, that dread presence  before which the angels of faith and love can avail nothing. Fearless as  Alcides had he gone down to the realms of darkness; triumphant and glad as the  demigod he returned from the under-world, bearing his precious burden in his  strong arms. The struggle had been dire, the agony of suspense a supreme  torture; but from the awful contest the man came forth a better and a wiser  man. Whatever strength of principle had been wanting to complete the work of  reformation inaugurated by love, had been gained by Valentine Hawkehurst during  the period of Charlotte&rsquo;s illness. His promised wife, his redeeming angel, she  for whose affection he had first learned to render thanks to his God, had  seemed to be slipping away from him. In the happiest hour of his prosperous  courtship he had known himself unworthy of her, with no right, no claim, to so  fair a prize, except the right of pure and unselfish love. When the hour of  trial came to him he had said, &ldquo;Behold the avenger!&rdquo; and in that hour it seemed  to him that a lurking anticipation of future woe had been ever present with him  in the midst of his happiness, &mdash; it seemed so natural, so reasonable that this  treasure should be taken away from him. What had he done, that he should go  unpunished for all the errors and follies of his youth?</p>
<p>He looked back, and asked himself if he had been so  vile a sinner as in these hours of self-reproach he was inclined to esteem  himself? Could his life have been otherwise? Had he not been set in a groove,  his young feet planted in the crooked ways, before he knew that life&rsquo;s journey  might be travelled by a straighter road?</p>
<p>Alas, the answer given at the tribunal of  conscience went against him! Other men had come into this world amidst  surroundings as bad, nay, indeed, worse than the surroundings of his cradle.  And of these men some had emerged from their native mire spotless and pure as  from newly-fallen snow. The natural force of character which had saved these  men had not been given to him. His feet had been set in the crooked ways, and  he had travelled on, reckless, defiant, dimly conscious that the road was a bad  one, and that his garments were bespattered with more mud-stains than would be  agreeable to some travellers.</p>
<p>It was only when the all-powerful influence of love  was brought to bear upon this plastic nature that Valentine Hawkehurst became  fully awakened to the degradation of his position, and possessed with an  earnest desire to emerge from the great dismal swamp of bad company. Then, and  then only, began the transformation which was ultimately to become so complete  a change. Some influence, even beyond that of happy love, was needed to give  force to this man&rsquo;s character; and in the great terror of the last three months  that influence had been found. The very foundations of Valentine Hawkehurst&rsquo;s  life had been shaken, and, come what might, he could never be again what he had  been.</p>
<p>He had almost lost her. All was said in that. She  had been almost taken from him &mdash; she, who to this man was father, mother, wife,  household, past, present, future, glory, ambition, happiness &mdash; everything  except that God who ruled above and held her life and his peace in the hollow  of His hand. He had been face to face with death; and never, in all the years  to come &mdash; never in the brightest hour of future happiness, could he forget the  peril that had come upon him, and might come again. He had learned to  understand that he held her, not as a free gift, but as a loan &mdash; a treasure to  be reclaimed at any moment by the God who lent her.</p>
<p>The darksome valley was past, and Valentine stood  by his darling&rsquo;s side, safe upon the sunlit uplands.</p>
<p>The doctors had declared their patient safe. The  hour of danger had been passed in safety, and the mischief worked by the  poisoner&rsquo;s slow process had been well nigh counteracted by medical skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In six weeks&rsquo; time you may take your wife for her  honeymoon tour, Mr. Hawkehurst, with her health and spirits thoroughly  re-established,&rdquo; said Dr. Jedd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that you say about honeymoon tours?&rdquo; cried  Gustave Lenoble. &ldquo;Hawkehurst and his wife will spend their honeymoon at  C&ocirc;tenoir; is it not, Diana?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana replied that it was to be, and must be so.</p>
<p>It was impossible to imagine a happier party than  that which met day after day in those pleasant lodgings at Kilburn, wherein  Georgy and Diana and Charlotte had been established with much devotion and care  on the parts of Valentine and Gustave. Mr. Hawkehurst had chosen the  apartments, and M. Lenoble had spent the day before the wedding in rushing to  and fro between the West End and Kilburn, carrying hot-house flowers,  comestibles of all kinds from Fortnum and Mason&rsquo;s, bonbon boxes, perfumery, new  books, new music, and superintending the delivery of luxurious easy-chairs,  hired from expensive upholsterers, a grand piano, and a harmonium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have music in the evenings,&rdquo; he said to  Diana, upon her expressing surprise on beholding these arrangements, &ldquo;when we  are assembled here, all. How thou dost open thine eyes on beholding these  nothings! Do you think it has been no pleasure to me to testify my affection  for one who has been so good to thee &mdash; thy friend, thine adopted sister? I  wished that all things should look bright around her, when they brought her  here, after that she had come to escape from the jaws of death. And thou, was  it not that thou wert also coming to make thy home here for some days, until  thy day of marriage? Thy father astonishes himself to hear of such sudden  events. Thou wilt go to see him, soon, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear Gustave. I will go to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on the next day, and found Captain Paget  much weaker than on her last visit.</p>
<p>It was evident that for him the end was very near.  He was much changed and subdued by his long illness; but the spirit of  worldliness had not been altogether exorcised even in this dismal period of  self-communion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean, Diana?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  understand being kept in the dark like this. Here are you suddenly leaving Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s house without rhyme or reason, to take up your quarters in lodgings  with Mrs. Sheldon. Here is a mysterious marriage taking place at a time when I  have been given to understand that one of the parties is at death&rsquo;s door; and  here is Lenoble introduced to Valentine Hawkehurst, in express opposition to my  particular request that my future son-in-law should be introduced to none of  the Sheldon set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine is not one of the Sheldon set, papa. I  do not think it likely that he will ever see Philip Sheldon again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Paget. &ldquo;There  has been something serious going on, then, surely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this he insisted on an explanation, and Diana  told him the story of the last two or three weeks: Charlotte&rsquo;s increasing  illness &mdash; so mysterious and incurable; the sudden return from Harold&rsquo;s Hill;  Valentine&rsquo;s fears; Dr. Jedd&rsquo;s boldly-expressed opinion that the patient was the  victim of foul play; the systematic exclusion of Philip Sheldon from the  sick-room, followed immediately by symptoms of amelioration, leading to gradual  recovery.</p>
<p>All this Captain Paget heard with an awe-stricken  countenance. The distance that divides the shedder of blood from all other  wrong-doers is so great, that the minor sinner feels himself a saint when he  contemplates the guilt of the greater criminal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great God! is this possible?&rdquo; exclaimed the  Captain, with a shudder.&ldquo;And I have taken that man&rsquo;s hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later in the evening, when Diana had left him, and  he had been thinking seriously of his own career, and those many transactions  of his troubled life which, in the slang denomination of the day, would be  called &ldquo;shady,&rdquo; he derived some scrap of comfort from one consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never hurt a worm,&rdquo; he murmured to himself,  complacently. &ldquo;No, I can lay my hand upon my heart and say, I never hurt a  worm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain did not pause to reflect that some of  the merit involved in this amiable trait of character might have been referable  to the fact, that he had never happened to fall upon a state of society in  which a comfortable living was to be made by the hurting of worms. He thought  only of the story he had heard about Philip Sheldon; and he told himself that  not in the direst necessity of his life could his brain have fashioned the  thought of such a deed as that, in the doing of which this man had persevered  for nearly three months.</p>
<p>For Charlotte Hawkehurst the summer days which  succeeded her marriage passed very quietly. She had not been told the real  motive of that hasty and stolen marriage which had given her to the man she  loved and trusted so completely. Valentine and Diana had between them contrived  to mould Mrs. Sheldon to their will; and it was at her request that Charlotte  had consented to so strange a step.</p>
<p>The fable invented to account for this desire on  the part of Mrs. Sheldon was very innocent. The doctors had ordered a milder  climate than England for the dear convalescent &mdash; Madeira, Algeria, Malta &mdash; or  some other equally remote quarter of the globe. It was impossible that Mr. or  Mrs. Sheldon could take so long a journey; Mr. Sheldon being bound hand and  foot to the mill-wheel of City life, Mrs. Sheldon being the slave and helpmeet  of her husband. Nor could dear Charlotte go to Malta alone, or attended only by  faithful Diana Paget. In short, there was no course so obvious or so prudent as  a hasty marriage, which would enable the invalid to seek a milder clime,  accompanied and guarded by her natural protector &mdash; a husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consent, dearest, I entreat you,&rdquo; wrote Valentine,  in the little note which supported Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s request, &ldquo;however strange our  wishes may seem to you. Believe that it is for the best, for your own sake, for  the sake of all who love you, and ask no questions. Say only yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the prayer in this letter, to the entreaties of  her mother and Diana, Charlotte yielded. She wondered why Mr. Sheldon avoided  her, and asked anxiously, on more than one occasion, why she did not see that  gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is papa ill,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;that he never comes to  see how I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctors have forbidden many people in your  room, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a few days ago, when I was so very ill; but  now that I am better, papa might come. I want to thank him for all his anxious  care of me, and to be sure that <em>he</em> consents to this marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, be assured the marriage is for the  best,&rdquo; pleaded Diana.</p>
<p>And the marriage took place.</p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s innocent soul was thus spared the pain  of a revelation which must have cast a dark shadow on the bright beginning of  her wedded life. Georgy pledged herself to keep the fatal secret from her  daughter; and Diana Paget rewarded her discretion by the most patient attention  to her piteous and prosy lamentations upon the iniquity of mankind in general,  and Philip Sheldon in particular.</p>
<p>Of that hideous secret of the past, lately revealed  by Mr. Burkham, Mrs. Sheldon had been told nothing. No good end could have been  served by such a revelation. The criminal law has its statute of limitations &mdash;  unwritten, but not the less existent. A crime which would have been difficult  of proof at the time of its commission must after the lapse of twelve years  have travelled beyond the pale of justice. For three people to come forward and  declare that at the time of Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s death they had suspected Mr. Sheldon  of poisoning him, would be to prove nothing to the minds of a British jury,  except that the three people in question were libellous and ill-disposed  persons. The greater the issue, the wider the chances of escape given to the  accused; and a petty offender will be condemned for picking a pocket upon much  lighter grounds than will be considered sufficient to prove a man guilty of  blowing up the Houses of Parliament.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter40"></a>Chapter 40<br>
  After The Wedding</h2>
<p>The manner in which Mr. Sheldon would act in the  future was a matter of considerable fear to his wife. She had a hazy idea that  he would come to the pleasant Kilburn lodgings to claim her, and insist upon  her sharing his dreary future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could only have a divorce,&rdquo; she said  piteously, when she discussed the subject with her son-in-law. &ldquo;There ought to  be divorces for such dreadful things; but I never heard of one before Sir  Creswick, or the new judge, whose name I can&rsquo;t remember. O Valentine, I cannot  live with him; I cannot sit down to dinner day after day with such a man as  that. And to think that I should have known him when I was the merest girl, and  have danced my very first polka with him when it first came in, and people wore  polka boots and polka jackets, and wrote their notes of invitation upon polka  paper, and sang polka songs, and worked polking peasants in Berlin wool, and  went on altogether in the most absurd manner. And O Valentine, whom can one  trust, if not the man one has known all one&rsquo;s life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst pledged himself to protect his  mother-in-law from any attempt at persecution upon the part of her husband. He  did not know what difficulties he might have to encounter in the performance of  this pledge; for, in his ignorance of the stockbroker&rsquo;s desperate  circumstances, he imagined that Philip Sheldon would make some attempt to right  himself in the eyes of the world, by compelling his wife to reassume her  position in his house.</p>
<p>He went to George Sheldon&rsquo;s office within a few  days after his marriage to take counsel from that astute adviser. He found the  lawyer hard at work, and in very good spirits. It was by his advice the  marriage had been hurried on; Charlotte&rsquo;s stealthy removal from the house while  Philip Sheldon slumbered had been planned by him; and he was triumphant in the  thought that the plot had succeeded so well, and that Philip, the coolest and  deepest of schemers, had been so completely baffled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Ann Woolper is a treasure,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t think it was in her to do what she has done. Nothing could be neater  than the way she kept Phil at bay; and nothing could be better than her tact  and cleverness in getting Charlotte and her mother quietly off the other  morning while my precious brother was in the land of nod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has been invaluable to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that girl Paget, too; she has turned out a  regular trump. I used to think her a very stiff, consequential piece of goods  when I saw her at the Lawn; but, egad, she has shown herself the genuine metal  all through this business. Now that&rsquo;s a young woman I wouldn&rsquo;t mind making Mrs.  George Sheldon any day in the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do her too much honour,&rdquo; said Valentine, with  an internal shiver. &ldquo;Unhappily, a prior engagement will prevent Miss Paget&rsquo;s  availing herself of so excellent an opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It mayn&rsquo;t be such a very bad chance as you seem to  think it, my friend,&rdquo; George replied, with some indignation. &ldquo;Whenever the  Reverend John Haygarth&rsquo;s estate drops in, I stand to win fifty thousand pounds.  And that&rsquo;s not so bad for a start in life. I suppose you haven&rsquo;t forgotten that  your wife is heir-at-law to a hundred thousand pounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have not forgotten her position in relation  to the Haygarth estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I should rather think not. People don&rsquo;t  generally forget that kind of thing. But you are uncommonly cool about the  business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have passed through a fiery furnace in  which all the bullion in the Bank of England will not serve a man. That kind of  ordeal upsets one&rsquo;s old notions as to the value of money. And, again, I have  never been able to contemplate Charlotte&rsquo;s inheritance of that fortune as  anything but a remote contingency; the business is so slow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it has been going on. Affidavits have  been made; the whole affair is in progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it. Don&rsquo;t think that I pretend  not to value the prospect of wealth; I have only learnt to know that money is  not the be-all and end-all of life. I could be very happy with my dear wife if  there were no prospect of this Haygarthian inheritance; but if it does come to  us, we shall, no doubt, be all the happier. The millionaire sees the world from  a very pleasant point of view. I should like my dear girl to be the mistress of  as fair a home as money can buy for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;d like to have your name stand high  in the statistics of Government stockholders. Don&rsquo;t be sentimental, Hawkehurst;  that kind of thing won&rsquo;t wash. Thank God, we managed to save poor Tom&rsquo;s  daughter from the fangs of my brother Phil. But you can&rsquo;t suppose that I am  going to shut my eyes to the fact that this affair has been a very good thing  for you, and that you owe your chances of a great fortune entirely to me? You  don&rsquo;t pretend to forget <em>that</em>, I suppose?&rdquo;  said George Sheldon, with some acrimony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I pretend to forget that, or any  circumstance of our business relations? I am perfectly aware that you started  the hunt of the Haygarths, and that to your investigations is to be traced the  discovery that proves my wife a claimant to the estate now held by the Crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good; that&rsquo;s outspoken and honest, at any  rate. And now, how about our agreement? It&rsquo;s only a parole agreement, but an  honest man&rsquo;s word is as good as his bond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our agreement!&rdquo; repeated Valentine, with a puzzled  expression of countenance. &ldquo;Upon my word, I forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I thought it would come to that; I thought you  would manage to forget the terms agreed upon by you and me in the event of your  marriage with Charlotte Halliday. My memory is not so short as yours; and I can  swear to a conversation between you and me in this room, in which you consented  to my taking half the Haygarthian estate as the price of my discovery and the  fair reward of my labours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;I remember that  conversation; and I remember saying that the demand was a stiff one, but that  I, as Charlotte&rsquo;s future husband, would not oppose such a demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; and if my wife is willing to consent to your  terms, I will hold to my promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife&rsquo;s consent is not wanted. She married you  without a settlement, and her rights are merged in yours. To all intents and  purposes, <em>you</em> are heir-at-law to John  Haygarth&rsquo;s estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine laughed aloud; the whole affair seemed a  tremendous joke. He, the homeless, penniless, friendless reprobate of but one  year ago &mdash; he, the son and heir of a man who had been always on the verge of  social shipwreck for want of five pounds &mdash; he, of all other men upon this  earth, claimant against the Crown for an estate worth one hundred thousand  pounds!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole affair seems ridiculously improbable,&rdquo;  he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother wouldn&rsquo;t have done what he did if the  whole thing had seemed improbable to him. However, we needn&rsquo;t estimate the  chances for or against; all I want is a legal agreement between you and me,  securing my share of the plunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to execute any reasonable agreement;  but I am bound to protect my wife&rsquo;s interests, and I must have a solicitor to  act for me in this affair. Greek must meet Greek, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good. I could have conducted the business  myself without the interference of strangers; but if you are going in for  extreme caution, you&rsquo;d better leave your wife&rsquo;s affairs in the hands of Messrs.  Greenwood and Greenwood, who have acted for her hitherto, and have all papers  relating to the case in their possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greenwood and Greenwood? My dear girl told me she  had signed some document, and had seen some lawyers; but she did not tell me  the nature of the document, or the name of the lawyers. I have forborne to  speak to her on business matters. The treatment that she has undergone has left  her very nervous, and we try to keep all unpleasant subjects out of her mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all very well; but business is  business, you know. You&rsquo;d better see Messrs. Greenwood and Greenwood at once.  Tell them of your marriage. You&rsquo;ll have to keep Phil&rsquo;s conduct dark, of course;  that is understood between us. You must say the marriage was a love-match  against my brother&rsquo;s wish, romantic, sentimental, and so on. They&rsquo;ll raise no  objections when they find you are willing to leave the case in their hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard nothing of your brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no &mdash; nothing, or next to nothing. I called  at his office yesterday. He has not been there since the beginning of  Charlotte&rsquo;s illness, and there has been no letter or message for Orcott since  your wedding-day. Things look rather piscatorial, altogether. Orcott hints that  Phil&rsquo;s affairs are in queer street; but he&rsquo;s a shallow-headed fool, and knows  very little. It seems, by his account, that Phil was a Bull, and that the fall  in every species of stock has been ruin to him. You see, when a man once goes  in for the Bull business, he never by any chance turns Bear &mdash; and <em>vice versa</em>. There&rsquo;s a kind of infatuation  in the thing, and a man sticks to his line until he&rsquo;s cleaned out &mdash; at least,  that&rsquo;s what stockbrokers have told me &mdash; and I believe it&rsquo;s pretty near the  truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all that Valentine could ascertain about  Mr. Sheldon at present. Every knock fluttered Georgy; every accidental visitor  at the Kilburn villa seemed like the swooping of eagle on dovecote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot get over the feeling that he will come  and take me away with him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If Sir Wilde Creswick would only do  something, so that my second husband mayn&rsquo;t be able to insist upon my living in  that dreadful, dreadful house, where I suffered such nights and days of agony,  that I am convinced the sight of chintz curtains lined with pink will make me  wretched as long as I live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Sheldon, he shall not come,&rdquo; said  Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could only go ever so far away from him, and  feel that there was the sea, or something of that kind, between us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will take you away &mdash; across the British  Channel, or further still, if you like. Diana and M. Lenoble are to be married  soon; and directly Lotta is strong enough for the journey we are to go over to  Normandy, to their chateau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chateau, indeed!&rdquo; Mrs. Sheldon exclaimed  peevishly. &ldquo;The idea of Diana Paget, without a sixpence, and with a regular  scamp of a father, marrying a man with a chateau, while my poor Charlotte &mdash; ! I  don&rsquo;t wish to wound your feelings, Mr. Hawkehurst, but it really does seem  hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard that Lotta should not have married a  prince &mdash; all the grandeurs of a prince in a fairy tale would only be her due;  but it happens fortunately, you see, dear Mrs. Sheldon, that our sweet girl has  simple tastes, and does not languish for jewels or palaces. If she should ever  become rich&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; sighed, Georgy despondently, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect  that. I can&rsquo;t understand anything about this idea of a fine fortune that Mr.  Sheldon had got into his head. I know that my husband&rsquo;s mother was a Miss  Meynell, the daughter of a carpet-warehouseman in the city, and I can&rsquo;t see how  any grand fortune is to come to Charlotte through her. And as for the Hallidays  &mdash; Hyley and Newhall farms were all the property they ever owned within the  memory of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fortune for which Charlotte is a claimant  comes from the maternal ancestor of Christian Meynell. I do not count upon her  possession of it as a certain good in the future. If it comes we will be  thankful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a very large sum of money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes; I believe it is a considerable sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty thousand pounds, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been told that it is as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not want Georgy&rsquo;s weak mind to become  possessed of the idea of shadowy wealth. He remembered what Philip Sheldon had  said to him on the Christmas night in which they had paced the little Bayswater  garden together, and he felt that there was a substratum of common sense in  that scoundrel&rsquo;s artful warning.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter41"></a>Chapter 41<br>
  Greek Against Greek</h2>
<p>Valentine Hawkehurst called upon Mr. Greenwood, of  the firm of Greenwood and Greenwood, within a week of his marriage, and  exhibited the certificate to that gentleman. Mr. Greenwood received the  information with much solemnity, and even severity, of manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you aware that this is a very serious step  which you have taken, Mr. Hawkehurst?&rdquo; he demanded, sternly. &ldquo;You entrap &mdash; that  is to say, you persuade a lady into a hasty marriage &mdash; without consultation  with her legal advisers, without settlements of any kind whatever &mdash; while at  the same time you are aware that the lady in question is heir-at-law to a very  large fortune, proceedings for the recovery of which are now pending. Pardon me  if I observe that there is a want of delicacy &mdash; of &mdash; a &mdash; hem &mdash; right-mindedness  in the transaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The imputation contained in your remarks is not a  pleasant one, Mr. Greenwood,&rdquo; Valentine remarked quietly; &ldquo;but I am quite willing  to pardon any injustice which you may inflict upon me by your desire to protect  the interests of your client. I think you will speedily discover that those  interests are in no way endangered by the lady&rsquo;s marriage with me. There are  social complications which are not to be settled by either law or equity. Miss  Halliday&rsquo;s surroundings of the last few months were of a very painful nature;  so painful, that the legal protection of marriage became the only means of  saving her from imminent peril. I cannot enter more fully into those painful  circumstances. I can only assure you that I married your client with the  consent and approval of her only near relation, and uninfluenced in the  smallest degree by mercenary considerations. Whatever post-nuptial settlement  you please to make for my wife&rsquo;s protection I shall promptly execute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You express yourself in a very honourable and  highly creditable manner, Mr. Hawkehurst,&rdquo; exclaimed the lawyer, with sudden  cordiality; &ldquo;and I beg distinctly to withdraw any offensive observations I may  have made just now. Your own affairs are, I conclude, in a sufficiently solvent  state?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not owe a sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good; and Mr. Sheldon, the lady&rsquo;s stepfather and  my client &mdash; had you his approval for this hasty marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The marriage took place without Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  knowledge or consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask your reason for this secrecy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Greenwood; it is just that one reason that  I cannot tell you.
  Accept my assurance that it was an all-powerful reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am compelled to do so, if you decline to confide  in my discretion; but as Mr. Sheldon is my client, I am bound to think of his  interests as well as those of Miss Halliday &mdash; er &mdash; Mrs. Hawkehurst. I am  somewhat surprised that he has not called upon me since the marriage. He has been  made aware of that circumstance, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I wrote to him immediately after the  ceremony, enclosing him a copy of the certificate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The marriage will make a considerable difference  to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in the event of his stepdaughter&rsquo;s death. If  she had died unmarried and intestate, this fortune would have gone to her  mother; besides which, there was the insurance on Miss Halliday&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An insurance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Were you not apprised of that fact? Mr.  Sheldon, with very natural precaution, insured his stepdaughter&rsquo;s life for a  considerable sum &mdash; in point of fact, as I believe, five thousand pounds; so  that, in case of her death prior to the recovery of the Haygarth estate, her  mother might receive some solatium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had insured her life!&rdquo; said Valentine, under  his breath.</p>
<p>This, then, was the key to the mystery. The  Haygarthian inheritance was but a remote contingency, a shadowy prize, which  could scarcely have tempted the secret assassin; but the insurance had offered  the prospect of immediate gain. The one link wanting to complete the chain of  evidence against Philip Sheldon was found. There was no longer a question as to  his motive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man knows of one insurance on her life,&rdquo;  Valentine thought to himself; &ldquo;there may have been more than one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a brief silence, in which Mr. Hawkehurst had  been lost in thought, the lawyer proceeded to discuss the terms of the  post-nuptial settlement necessary for the protection of his client&rsquo;s interests.  In the course of this discussion Valentine explained his position in relation  to George Sheldon, and stated the demands of that sharp practitioner.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood was utterly aghast upon hearing Mr.  Hawkehurst&rsquo;s views on this subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to tell me that this man claims a clear  half of the Haygarth estate &mdash; fifty thousand pounds &mdash; in consideration of his  paltry discoveries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is the demand he has made, and which I have  pledged myself not to oppose. He certainly does open his mouth very wide; but  we are bound to consider that but for these discoveries of his, my wife and my  wife&rsquo;s relatives would in all probability have gone down to their graves in  ignorance of their claim to this estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Hawkehurst. If Mr. George  Sheldon had not made the discovery, some one else would have made it sooner or  later, depend upon it. There would have been a little loss of time, that is  all. There are plenty of men of George Sheldon&rsquo;s class always on the look-out  for such chances as this &mdash; and for very small chances in comparison to this.  Why, I know a fellow, a Frenchman, called Fleurus, who will take as much  trouble about a few hundred pounds&rsquo; worth of unclaimed stock as this man,  George Sheldon, has taken about the Haygarth succession. And he has really the  impudence to claim fifty thousand pounds from you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A claim which I have pledged myself not to  oppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But which you have not pledged yourself to  support. My dear Mr. Hawkehurst, this is a business which you must allow me to  settle for you, as your wife&rsquo;s legal adviser. We will consider you quite out of  the question, if you please; you will thus come out of your relations to Mr.  George Sheldon with perfectly clean hands. You will not oppose his claim; but I  shall oppose him in my character of legal adviser to your wife. Why, are you  aware that this man executed an agreement with his brother, consenting to  receive a fifth share of the estate, and costs out of pocket, in complete  acquittance of all claims? I have an abstract of the agreement, amongst Miss  Halliday&rsquo;s &mdash; Mrs. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some further discussion, Valentine agreed to  leave the whole matter in Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s hands. Greek must meet Greek. Gray&rsquo;s  Inn and the Fields must settle this business between themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am only prince consort,&rdquo; he said, with a smile.  &ldquo;I pretend to no actual interest in my wife&rsquo;s estate. I doubt, indeed, whether  I should not have felt more complete happiness in our marriage if she had not  been heiress to so large a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Mr. Greenwood laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Mr. Hawkehurst,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;that  really won&rsquo;t do. I am an old stager, you know &mdash; a man of the world; &mdash; and you  mustn&rsquo;t ask me to believe that the idea of your wife&rsquo;s expectations can afford  you anything but unqualified satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot believe? No, perhaps not,&rdquo; Valentine  answered, thoughtfully. &ldquo;But you do not know how nearly these expectations have  lost me my wife. And even now, when she is mine by virtue of a bond that only  death can loosen, it seems to me as if her wealth would make a kind of division  between us. There are people who will always consider me a lucky adventurer,  and look at my marriage as the result of clever scheming. I cannot advertise to  the world the fact that I loved Charlotte Halliday from the first hour in which  I saw her, and asked her to be my wife three days before I discovered her claim  to John Haygarth&rsquo;s estate. A man can&rsquo;t go through the world with his  justification pinned upon his breast. I think it will be my fate to be  misjudged all my life. A twelvemonth ago I cared very little about the opinions  of my fellow-men; but I want to be worthy of my wife in the esteem of mankind,  as well as in the depths of my own moral consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and finish your honeymoon,&rdquo; said the lawyer,  digging his client in the ribs with elephantine playfulness; &ldquo;the moon must be  in her first quarter, I should think. Go along with you, and leave me to tackle  Mr. George Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter42"></a>Chapter 42<br>
  Only A Dream</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I say, Lenoble,&rdquo;  Captain Paget began abruptly one afternoon when his daughter and his future  son-in-law were in attendance upon his sofa, &ldquo;when are you and Diana to be  married? There is nothing to hinder your marriage now, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana looked at the speaker with a grave  countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear papa, there can be no marriage while you are  so ill,&rdquo; she said gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And afterwards, when I&rsquo;m gone, you won&rsquo;t like to  marry within six months of your father&rsquo;s funeral; and you will be left alone in  the world. You can&rsquo;t hang on to Hawkehurst and his wife. The best thing you can  do, Lenoble, is to marry her out of hand, and let me see her by my bedside as  Madame Lenoble of C&ocirc;tenoir. It will be some consolation for me to see that day.  I thought to have shared your home, with a run to Paris occasionally just to  freshen myself up a little; but that&rsquo;s all over now. It does seem rather hard  to me sometimes; and I think of Moses, and his forty years in the Desert with  those ill-conditioned Israelites, who were always getting into some scrape or  other &mdash; setting up golden calves, and that kind of thing &mdash; if he turned his  back on them for twenty-four hours. A pack of ungrateful beggars too, always  ready for mutiny &mdash; regular radicals, begad! And he went through it all: the  sand, and the <em>toujours</em> quails, and  the ingratitude; and after forty years of it, when he saw the Promised Land  stretched before him green and fertile on the other side of the river &mdash; he  died! I&rsquo;ve been through my desert, the dreary wanderings over the barren sand,  and the ingratitude of men I&rsquo;ve served. Yes, I&rsquo;ve gone through it all; and just  as I catch a glimpse of Canaan, the curtain drops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this they comforted him; and sustained him with  the promise of a brighter Canaan than C&ocirc;tenoir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said in a dreamy voice, &ldquo;I read about it  very often. A city with foundations of jasper and chalcedony, emerald and  sardonyx; gates of pearl, pavements of gold. That&rsquo;s what St. John the  Evangelist saw in his vision; and we&rsquo;ve only his word for it. But there&rsquo;s  something that I can believe and can understand: &lsquo;In my Father&rsquo;s house there  are many mansions.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s more hope for a sinful man of the world in that  promise than in all St. John&rsquo;s dreams about gates of pearl and foundations of  emerald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain was failing fast. He had exchanged his  easy-chair for a sofa now; and the time seemed near at hand when he must  exchange the sofa for his bed. After that there would remain but one last  change, to the contemplation whereof the sick man was becoming daily more  reconciled.</p>
<p>He had read his Gospel more diligently of late, and  had taken comfort from those sublime pages. Do they not contain consolation,  hope, promise for all &mdash; for the weary man of the world as well as for the  saint? There is to be found the only creed that can adapt itself to every  condition of life, and has a margin wide enough for every weakness of erring  humanity. Buddhism may contain a scheme of morality almost as perfect; Mahomet  may have expounded hopes that seem well-nigh as divine; but in the Gospel is  the only system that will adapt itself at once to the culture of the spiritual  man, and the active life of the practical worker in this lower world.</p>
<p>Gustave Lenoble was only too glad to claim his  promised wife a little sooner than he had hoped to claim her. &ldquo;Thou hast put me  off long enough, cruel,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and now it is thy father&rsquo;s wish that our  marriage should be soon. It shall be this week; I will take no longer thine  excuses. We shall be the sooner ready to receive thy friends, thy Charlotte and  her Hawkehurst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Gustave, you are always kind,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>It was very sweet to her to think that her new home  would afford a pleasant haven for that dear friend who had sheltered her. And  with Charlotte, the dear adopted sister, would come the man she had once loved,  to share whose cares had once been the brightest dream.</p>
<p>She wondered at her own inconstancy on perceiving  how completely the dream had flown. Before the stern realities of life &mdash; before  sickness and sorrow and the dread shadow of death &mdash; that schoolgirl&rsquo;s vision  had utterly melted away. It is just possible that Gustave&rsquo;s manly outspoken  love may have helped to blot from the tablet of her mind the fantastic picture  of the life that might have been. She scarcely knew whether this was so; but  she did know that a new and happier existence began for her from the hour in which  she gave her heart in all truth and loyalty to Gustave Lenoble.</p>
<p>The wedding was arranged to take place within a  week of Captain Paget&rsquo;s expressly declared wish. It was to be solemnised at a  church near Knightsbridge, and again at a Catholic chapel in the neighbourhood  of Sloane-street; by which double ceremonial a knot would be tied that no legal  quibble could hereafter loosen. Charlotte was just sufficiently recovered to  obtain permission to be present at the ceremonial, after some little exercise of  her persuasive powers with the medical practitioner to whose care Dr. Jedd had  committed her when all danger was past.</p>
<p>The Captain protested, with an eager insistence,  that the wedding breakfast should be eaten at his domicile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Val,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;be sure Val is with you. I  have a secret to tell him &mdash; a kind of atonement to make; some news to give him  that he won&rsquo;t quite relish, perhaps. But that&rsquo;s no fault of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bad news, I hope, papa; for Charlotte&rsquo;s sake as  well as for
  Valentine&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends upon how they both take it. Your  friend Charlotte is not particularly fond of money, is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fond of money, papa? A baby knows as much of the  value of money as Lotta. Except to give to beggars in the streets, or to buy  pretty frivolous presents for her friends, she has neither use nor desire for  money. She is the most generous, most disinterested of created beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to hear it,&rdquo; said the Captain,  drily. &ldquo;And how about
  Hawkehurst, now? Do you think it was a real love-match, his marriage with
  Miss Halliday? No <em>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</em> &mdash; no  looking out for the main chance at
  the bottom of his romantic attachment, eh, Di?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, papa. I am sure there was never truer love  than his. I saw him under most trying circumstances, and I can pledge myself  for the truth of his devotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to hear it. Be sure you bring  Hawkehurst and his wife to my little breakfast. A chicken, a pine, a bottle of  sparkling hock, and a fond father&rsquo;s blessing, are all I shall give you; but the  chicken and the hock will be from Gunter, and the blessing from the bottom of a  paternal heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Bright shone the day that gave Diana to her  husband, and very beautiful looked the bride in her simple dress. Gustave  Lenoble&rsquo;s marriage was no less quietly performed than that union which had  secured the safety of Charlotte Halliday and the happiness of Valentine  Hawkehurst. The shadow of death hovered very near bride and bridegroom; for  they knew full well that he who was to preside that day at their simple  marriage-feast would soon have tasted that last sacred cup which has no  after-flavour of bitterness.</p>
<p>The breakfast promised by the Captain was arranged  with much elegance. Hothouse flowers and fruits; wines with the icedew  sparkling on the dark glass; chickens and tongue, idealized by the  confectioner&rsquo;s art, and scarcely recognizable beneath rich glazings and  embellishments of jellies and forcemeats; the airiest and least earthly of  lobster salads, and a pyramid of coffee-ice, testified to the glory of the  Belgravian purveyor. It had been pleasant to Captain Paget to send his orders  to Gunter, certain of funds to meet the bill. It was almost a glimpse of that  land of milk and honey, that Canaan in Normandy, which he was never to inhabit.</p>
<p>He was very weak, very ill; but the excitement of  the occasion in some measure sustained and revivified him. The man who had been  engaged to nurse and wait upon him had attired him with much care in a  dressing-gown as elegant as the robe in which he had disported himself, a  penniless young cornet, in his luxurious garrison quarters, some fifty years  before. His loose white locks were crowned with an embroidered smoking-cap; his  patrician instep was set off by a dainty scarlet slipper. He had put away the  Gospel, and all thoughts of that dread reckoning which he had really some  shadowy desire and hope to settle satisfactorily, by some poor dividend which  might discharge his obligations to that merciful Creditor who forgives so many  just debts. To-day he was of the world, worldly. It was a kind of <em>ante-mortem</em> lying-in-state &mdash; his last  levee; and he was equal to the occasion.</p>
<p>The prettily adorned table was drawn near the sofa  where the invalid host reclined, supported by numerous pillows. His daughter  and her husband, Valentine, Charlotte, and Georgy, made a little circle about  him. His own man, and a clerical-looking person from Gunter&rsquo;s, assisted at the  airy banquet. Very little was eaten by any of the guests, and it was a relief  to every one when the clerical personage and Captain Paget&rsquo;s factotum retired,  after serving tea and coffee with funereal solemnity.</p>
<p>Valentine Hawkehurst was all gentleness and  cordiality towards his old taskmaster. The wrong must indeed be dire which is  considered in such an hour as this. Valentine remembered only that with this  old man he had seen many troubled days; and that for him the end of all earthly  wanderings was very near.</p>
<p>The little banquet was not served in Captain  Paget&rsquo;s ordinary sitting-room. For this distinguished occasion the landlady had  lent a dining-room and drawing-room on the ground floor, just deserted by a  fashionable bachelor lodger who had left town at the close of the season. This  drawing-room on the ground floor, like the room above, overlooked the Park, and  to this apartment the Captain requested his guests to adjourn, with the  exception of Mr. Hawkehurst, some little time after the departure of the  servants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to have a few words with Val in private,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;I have a secret to communicate. Diana, show Mrs. Hawkehurst the  Drive. You can see the Bow from my room, but not from these lower windows.  There are a good many carriages still, but it is too late for the <em>cr&ecirc;me de la cr&ecirc;me</em>. I remember when the  West End was a desert at this time of year; but I have lived to see the  levelling of all distinctions, those of time as well as of class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte and Diana retired to the adjoining room  with Mrs. Sheldon and M. Lenoble. Valentine was at a loss to imagine what  manner of confidential communication his late patron and employer could desire  to impart to him. The cautious Horatio waited until the rest of the party were  quite out of hearing, talking gaily by the open window, beyond which appeared  all the fluttering life and motion of summer leaves, all the brightness of  summer green below, and deep blue sky above. When they seemed to him to be  quite engaged with their own conversation, Captain Paget turned to his old  companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Val,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have seen hard times together;  we&rsquo;ve roughed it among strange places and strange people, you know and so on;  and I think there is a friendly kind of feeling between us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out his poor wasted hand, and Valentine  grasped it firmly in his own with prompt cordiality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear governor, I have no feeling in my heart  that is not friendly to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was perfectly true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And even if I had been inclined to bear any grudge  against you on account of the old days, when, you know, you were a little apt  to be indifferent as to what scrape you left me in, provided you got off  scot-free yourself; if I had been inclined to remember that kind of thing  (which, on my honour, I am not), your daughter&rsquo;s noble courage and devotion in  the time of my dear wife&rsquo;s peril should have stood against that old wrong. I  cannot tell you how deeply I feel her goodness in that bitter time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a Paget,&rdquo; murmured the Captain,  complacently. &ldquo;<em>Noblesse oblige.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine could scarcely refrain from a smile as he  remembered the many occasions upon which the obligations of a noble lineage had  weighed very lightly on his aristocratic patron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Val,&rdquo; the Captain resumed, in a dreamy tone,  &ldquo;we have seen many strange things together. When I began my travels through  this world, in the palmy days of the Regency, I little thought what a weary  journey it was to be, and what queer people I was to encounter among my  fellow-passengers. However, I&rsquo;ve come to the last stage of the long journey  now, and I thank Providence that it ends so comfortably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this Valentine assented kindly, but he was at a  loss to understand why Captain Paget should have required the adjournment of  the rest of the party before giving utterance to these mild commonplaces.</p>
<p>For some moments the invalid relapsed into  thoughtful silence. Then, rousing himself as if with an effort, he took a few  sips of a cooling drink that stood by his side, and began with a startling  abruptness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember your journey to Dorking, Val, last  October, when you went to see that mysterious old aunt of yours, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine blushed as the Captain recalled this  cunningly-devised fable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said gravely; &ldquo;I remember telling you  that I was going to see an aunt at Dorking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An aunt who had a little bit of money, eh, Val?&rdquo;  asked the Captain, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I may have gone so far as to speak of a  little bit of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And neither the aunt nor the bit of money ever  existed, eh, Val? They were mere figments of the brain; and instead of going to  Dorking you went to Ullerton, eh, Val? You stole a march upon me there. You  wanted to throw your old chum off the scent, eh? You thought you had got hold  of a good thing, and you were afraid your friend and companion might get a  share of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, my friend and companion had a knack  of getting the lion&rsquo;s share. Besides, this good thing was not my own affair. I  had to protect the interest of another person &mdash; my employer, in point of fact;  and it was by his suggestion, and in compliance with his request, that I  invented that harmless fiction about Dorking. I don&rsquo;t think there was any  dishonourable dealing in the matter. We were soldiers of fortune both; and the  stratagem with which I protected myself against you was a very innocent one.  You would have employed any stratagem or invented any fiction under the same  circumstances. It was a case of diamond cut diamond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely; and if the older soldier, if the free  lance of many a campaign, got the best of it in the long run, the younger  freebooter could hardly think himself ill-used &mdash; could he now, Val?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I suppose not,&rdquo; replied Valentine,  puzzled by the significance in the face of his old companion. That sly twinkle  in the Captain&rsquo;s eyes, that triumphant smile wreathing the Captain&rsquo;s lips, must  surely mean mischief.</p>
<p>Valentine Hawkehurst remembered the vague suspicion  that had flashed into his mind on that Christmas Eve when Captain Paget and he  had dined together at a West End restaurant, and the Captain had toasted  Charlotte Halliday with a smile of sinister meaning. He began to anticipate  some startling and unpleasant revelation. He began to understand that in some  manner this inscrutible schemer had contrived to overreach him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to tell me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I see  there is some lurking mischief in your mind. How was it you were at Ullerton  when I was there? I met you on the platform of the station, and I had a vague  half suspicion that you followed me up on more than one occasion. I saw a glove  in a man&rsquo;s parlour &mdash; a glove which I could have sworn to as yours. But when I  came back, you were so plausible with your talk of promoting business, and so  on, that I was fool enough to believe you. And I suppose you cheated and  tricked me after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheated and tricked are hard words, my dear Val,&rdquo;  said the Captain, with delightful blandness. &ldquo;I had as much right to transact  imaginary business in the promoting line at Ullerton as you had to visit a  fictitious aunt at Dorking. Self-interest was the governing principle in both  cases. I do not think you can have any right to consider yourself injured by me  if I did steal a march upon you, and follow close upon your heels throughout  that Ullerton business. I do not think that you can have, on moral grounds, any  justification for making a complaint against your old ally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose you are right enough in that,&rdquo;  said Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake hands upon it, then. I have not very long to  live, and I want to feel myself at peace with mankind. You see, if you had come  to me in the first place, in a frank and generous spirit, and had said, &lsquo;My  dear friend, here is a good thing; let us go into it together, and see what  there is to be made out of it,&rsquo; you would have placed the matter on such a  footing that, as a man of honour, I should have been bound to regard your  interests as my own. But when you set up a separate interest, when you try to  throw dust in my eyes, to hoodwink me &mdash; me, Horatio Paget, a man of the world,  possessed of some little genius for social diplomacy &mdash; you attempt to do that  which no man ever yet succeeded in doing, and you immediately release me from  those obligations which an honourable man holds sacred. It was my glove which you  saw in Mr. Goodge&rsquo;s parlour. I had a very satisfactory interview with that  reverend person while you were absent from Ullerton on some short excursion, as  to the purpose of which I am still in the dark. On certain terms Mr. Goodge  agreed to give me the privilege of selecting a stated number from the letters  of Mrs. Rebecca Haygarth. I have reason to believe that I made a judicious  choice; for the information thus obtained placed me at once upon a track which  I followed industriously until it led me to a triumphant result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand&mdash;&rdquo; began Valentine; but the  Captain did not allow him time to say more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not understand that there could be any  other genealogical line than that which you and George Sheldon fitted together  so neatly. You have neither of you the experience of life which alone gives  wideness of vision. You discovered the connections of the Haygarth and the  Meynell families in the past. That was a step in the right direction. The  discovery, so far as it went, was a triumph. You allowed the sense of that  triumph to intoxicate you. In a business which of all businesses within the  range of man&rsquo;s intellect most requires deliberation and sobriety, you went to  work in a fever of haste and excitement. Instead of searching out <em>all</em> the descendants of Christian  Meynell, you pounce upon the first descendant who comes to hand, and elect her,  at your own pleasure, sole heiress to the estate of the deceased John Haygarth.  You forget that there may be other descendants of the said Christian Meynell &mdash;  descendants standing prior to your wife Charlotte in the line of succession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine no such descendants existing,&rdquo; said  Valentine, with a puzzled manner. &ldquo;You seem to have made yourself master of our  business; but there is one point upon which you are mistaken. George Sheldon  and I did not go to work in a fever of haste. We did fully and thoroughly  examine the pedigree of that person whom we &mdash; and legal advisers of  considerable standing &mdash; believe to be the sole heir-at-law to the Haygarth estate;  and we took good care to convince ourselves that there was no other claimant in  existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call convincing yourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christian Meynell had only three children &mdash;  Samuel, Susan, and Charlotte. The last, Charlotte, married James Halliday, of  Newhall and Hyley farms; the other two died unmarried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that? How do you propose to  demonstrate that Samuel and
  Susan Meynell died unmarried?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan was buried in her maiden name. Mrs.  Halliday, her sister, was with her when she died. There was no question of  marriage; nor is there the record of any marriage contracted by Samuel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that is no proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! I should have thought the evidence  sufficient. But, in any case,
  the <em>onus probandi</em> is not upon us. Can  you prove the marriage of the
  Samuel Meynell who died at Calais, or of the Susan Meynell who died in
  London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can. Susan Meynell&rsquo;s legitimate son is in the  next room. It&rsquo;s an unpleasant kind of revelation to make, Val; as he, the son  of one sister, stands prior to your wife, the granddaughter of the other  sister, in the order of succession. AND HE TAKES ALL!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He takes all!&rdquo; repeated Valentine, bewildered.  &ldquo;He! Susan Meynell&rsquo;s son? &mdash; in the next room? What does all this mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that when Susan was deserted by the scoundrel  who took her away from her home, she found an honest fellow to marry her. The  name of her husband was Lenoble. Gustave Lenoble yonder, my daughter&rsquo;s husband,  is her only child by that marriage. A perfectly legal marriage, my dear Val &mdash;  everything <em>en regle</em>, I assure you.  The business is in the hands of Messrs. Dashwood and Vernon of Whitehall &mdash; a  first-class firm; counsel&rsquo;s opinion most decided as to Lenoble&rsquo;s position. They  have been rather slow about the preliminary steps; and, <em>entre nous</em>, I have not cared to hurry them, for I wanted to get my  daughter&rsquo;s marriage over quietly before we began our proceedings in Chancery.  It comes rather hard upon you, Val, I allow; but, you see, if you had acted  generously, not to say honourably, towards me in the first instance, you&rsquo;d have  had the advantage of my experience. As it is, you have been working in the  dark. However, things are not so bad as they might be. You might have married  some ugly old harridan for the sake of this Haygarth estate; you have secured a  pretty and amiable wife, and you mustn&rsquo;t be downhearted if you find yourself,  from a financial point of view, most outrageously sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain could not refrain from a laugh as he  contemplated his young friend&rsquo;s surprise. The laugh degenerated into a fit of  coughing, and it was some little time before the enfeebled Horatio was ready to  resume the interrupted conversation. In this pause Valentine had leisure to  face this new position. There was for the moment a sharp sense of  disappointment. It is not possible for humanity to be quite indifferent to a  hundred thousand pounds. So much of the &ldquo;light and sweetness&rdquo; of life is  attainable for that sum, &mdash; such pleasures, of the purest and noblest, are in  the power of the possessor. But in this moment Valentine fully realized the  fact that he had never taken the idea of this fortune into his mind &mdash; never  made it part and parcel of himself, to be plucked out of his heart with  anguish, and to leave a bleeding wound in the place where it had grown. It  seemed to him as if he had been wakened abruptly from some bright bewildering  dream; but the sharp pang of mercenary desires disappointed, of sordid hopes  suddenly reft, was not for him.</p>
<p>Beyond this sense of uncertainty, which had made  the Haygarthian fortune seem at best such &ldquo;stuff as dreams are made of,&rdquo; there  had been ever present in his mind of late the dismal association connected with  this money. For this, and to get power over this through the rights of his weak  wife, had Philip Sheldon plotted against the life of that sweet girl who was  but newly rescued from the jaws of the grave. The bitter memory of those days  and nights of suspense could never have been quite dissociated from the money  that had been the primary cause of all this slow torture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I shall love my wife any less because  she has no claim to the Haygarth estate?&rdquo; he exclaimed presently, looking with  half-contemptuous indignation upon the broken-down Bohemer. &ldquo;I loved her long  before I knew the name of Haygarth; I should have loved her if I had found her  a beggar in the London streets, a peasant-girl weeding for sixpence a day in  some dismal swamp of agricultural poverty and ignorance. I am not going to say  that this money would not have brought us pleasure; pictures and gardens, and  bright rooms, and books without number, and intercourse with congenial  acquaintance and delightful journeyings to all the fairest places upon the  earth, and the power to do some good in our generation, and a sense of security  for our future, and by-and-by, perhaps, for the future of dear children, for  whose prosperity we should be more anxious than for our own. Pleasure the money  would most probably have brought for us in abundance; but I doubt if it could  buy us more perfect happiness than we may know in the simplest home that my  toil can support. Ah, Captain, I question if you ever knew the sweetest  sensation life can give &mdash; the delight of working for those we love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Paget stared at his sometime prot&eacute;g&eacute; in a  kind of rapture of wonder, not entirely unmingled with admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I have read of this kind of  thing in novels; but in the whole course of my experience I never met with  anything equal to it. My son-in-law, Lenoble yonder, is a generous foo &mdash; fellow  enough; but then, since infancy, he has never known the want of money. And  generosity from that kind of man is no more of a virtue than the foolhardiness  of a child who pokes his finger into the candle, not knowing the properties of  the thing he has to deal with. But anything like generosity from you, from a  man reared as you were reared, is, I freely confess, a little beyond my  comprehension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it is a transformation, is it not? But I  don&rsquo;t think I was ever inordinately fond of money. Your genuine Bohemian rarely  is. He is too well schooled in the art of living without cash, and he asks so  little here below. His pipe, his friend, his dog, his books, his garret, his  billiards, his beer. It is all a question of a few pounds a week. And if, some  day, the divine enchanter Love takes the poor fellow under his guidance, and  teaches him to do without billiards and beer, your Bohemian settles down into  the purest and best of men. Think what Goldy might have been if some good woman  had taken compassion upon him and married him, and henpecked him ever  afterwards. He might have written as many novels as Sir Walter Scott, and died  master of some Hibernian Abbotsford, some fair domain among the bright green  hills that look down upon broad Shannon&rsquo;s silvery falls. No, Captain; your  intelligence has not annihilated me. I can face the future boldly with my dear  young wife upon my arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul, Val, you&rsquo;re a very noble fellow!&rdquo;  exclaimed Horatio Paget, with real enthusiasm; &ldquo;and I am sorry I have kept you  in the dark so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have kept me in the dark? Yes; to be sure. How  long have you known this &mdash; about Susan Meynell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear boy, not very long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how long? A month &mdash; two months? Yes; you have  known Lenoble&rsquo;s position ever since you knew him; and Charlotte told me three  months ago of Diana&rsquo;s engagement to Lenoble. Do you know that if Sheldon had  succeeded, Charlotte&rsquo;s blood would have been upon your head? If you had not  concealed the truth, his villany would never have been attempted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Val,&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain  piteously, &ldquo;I was not to know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you were not to know that there could be such  a wretch as Philip Sheldon upon this earth. We will say no more of that. I kept  my secret, you kept yours. Mischief unspeakable well-nigh came of all this  underhand work. But heaven has been merciful to us. We have passed through the  valley of the shadow of death; and if anything could make my wife dearer to me  than she was when first I won her promise to be mine, it would be the sorrow of  the last few months. And now I will go and shake hands with Lenoble, my wife&rsquo;s  kinsman. He is a fine fellow, and well deserves his good fortune. Stay; one  word. Did Diana know this? did she know that her lover is heir to the Haygarth  estate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not know it now. She has never heard the  name of Haygarth. And, between you and me, Val, it cost me a world of trouble  to persuade her to say yes to Lenoble&rsquo;s offer, though he is a very decent match  for her, even without reference to the Haygarth estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad she knew nothing of this,&rdquo; said  Valentine; &ldquo;I am very glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this he again shook hands with Captain Paget,  at that gentleman&rsquo;s request, and the Captain expressed himself much relieved by  the conversation, and by his late prot&eacute;g&eacute;&rsquo;s very generous behaviour. He called  to his daughter and the rest presently, and they came at his summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your long talk finished, papa?&rdquo; asked Diana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is the secret told?&rdquo; demanded Charlotte of her  obedient husband and slave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, it is told,&rdquo; he answered gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it is a pleasant secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think the knowledge of it will give you  much pain, dearest. You have learnt to think yourself a &mdash; a kind of an heiress  of late, have you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa &mdash; Mr. Sheldon &mdash; told me that I had a claim to  some money; but I have not thought much about it, except that I should give you  Grote and Macaulay in dark-brown calf, with bevelled boards and red edges, like  that edition you saw at the auctioneer&rsquo;s in Bond Street, and have talked about  ever since; and a horse, perhaps; and a glass porch to our cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, darling, the books in dark-brown calf, and  the horse, and the glass porch, may all be ours in the future; but the money  was only a dream &mdash; it has melted away, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Charlotte. &ldquo;Why, I dare say  the day will come when you will be as rich as Sir Walter Scott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime I have something to give you  instead of the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; a cousin. Will that do as well, my love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cousin? I shall like her very much if she is  nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cousin I mean is a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is he to come from?&rdquo; cried Charlotte,  laughing. Has he dropped from the moon? The only relations I have in the world are  Uncle and Aunt Mercer. How can you pretend to find me a cousin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember telling me of your grandmother&rsquo;s  only sister &mdash; Susan
  Meynell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Charlotte, with a sudden blush; &ldquo;I  remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Miss Meynell married a gentleman of Normandy,  and left one only child, a son. His name is Gustave Lenoble, and he is standing  by your side. He is heir-at-law to a very large fortune, which it was once  supposed you could claim. Are you sorry, Lotta, to find a kinsman and lose a  fortune? &mdash; and are you contented to begin the world with no hope except in your  husband&rsquo;s patience and courage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And genius!&rdquo; cried Charlotte, with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The sweet, blinding glamour of love shone upon this  young scribbler, and she believed that he was indeed worthy to take rank among  the greatest of that grand brotherhood of which he was so humble a member. She  looked up at him with the prettiest confidence; her clinging hand clasped his  with love and trust immeasurable. He felt and knew that love like this was a  treasure beside which the Reverend John Haygarth&rsquo;s hoarded thousands must needs  seem but sorry dross.</p>
<p>After this there was much explanation and  congratulation. Gustave Lenoble was delighted to claim so fair a kinswoman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art like my eldest, my cousin,&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;Diana saw the likeness at the Sacr&eacute; Coeur when she beheld my daughter; and I  too saw my eldest&rsquo;s look in thine eyes when I first met thee. Remember, it was  convened between us that C&ocirc;tenoir should be a home for thee and for Hawkehurst  before I knew what link bound thee to the house of Lenoble. Now thou and thy  husband will be of our family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana was bewildered, grieved, indignant with the  father who had deceived her by his studious suppression of the truth. She found  herself placed in the position of rival to Charlotte, and the whole proceeding  seemed to her mean and treacherous.</p>
<p>But it was no time for remonstrance or open  expression of indignant feeling. Her father&rsquo;s days were numbered. She knew  this, and she held her peace. Nor did Mrs. Sheldon utter any word of complaint,  though the disappointment she experienced upon hearing this revelation was very  keen. The idea of the four or five thousand pounds which were to come to  Charlotte had been a consolation to her in the midst of that confusion and  desolation which had newly come upon her life. She left Knightsbridge that  evening somewhat depressed in spirits, and half inclined to be angry with  Charlotte and her husband for their gaiety of manner, and evident happiness in  each other&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems hard to have to begin the world at my  age,&rdquo; she murmured hopelessly, &ldquo;after being accustomed to have everything nice  about me, as I had at the Lawn; though I own that the trouble and care of the  servants was wearing me to the grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear mamma,&rdquo; exclaimed Charlotte tenderly, &ldquo;there  is no fear of trouble or poverty for you or for us. Valentine has plenty of  money, and is on the high road to securing a comfortable income. Authors do not  starve in garrets now, you know, as they used to do, poor things, when Doctor  Johnson ate his dinner in a cave, or something dreadful of that kind; and when  Sir Richard Steele thought it quite a wonderful thing to get a pound of tea for  his wife. And Valentine&rsquo;s heart is in his profession, and he will work for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as I have a hand that can write, and a  brain that can guide my pen,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Hawkehurst, gaily. &ldquo;I have given  hostages to Fortune. I can face the hazard boldly. I feel as confident and as  happy as if we lived in the golden age, when there was neither care nor toil  for innocent mankind, and all the brightest things of earth were the  spontaneous gift of the gods.&rdquo;</p>

  Bohemian Independence</h2>
<p>Monsieur and Madame Lenoble went to Brighton for  their honeymoon. A letter or a telegraphic message would bring them thence  swiftly to the bedside of the dying Captain, should the last fatal change set  in suddenly. Diana had wished to stay with her father, but Horatio insisted  upon the honeymoon trip, and that everything should be done in a correct and  gentlemanly manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can engage rooms at the Albion,&rdquo; Captain Paget  had said to his son-in-law a few days before the quiet wedding. &ldquo;The house is  extremely comfortable; and you will be received by a compatriot. The proprietor  is a Frenchman, and a very gentlemanly person, I assure you; the <em>cuisine</em> irreproachable. I remember the  old Steyne when Mrs. FitzHerbert lived close by, and received all the best  people, in the days when the Cockney had not yet taken possession of  Brighthelmstone, and the Chinese dragons and pagodas were bright and fresh in  the Pavilion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Brighton, therefore, the bride and bridegroom  departed; Diana attended by a maid, an appanage which the Captain had insisted  upon. Poor Diana was sorely puzzled as to what she should find for the maid to  do when her hair had been dressed early in the morning, and her costume laid  out in state for the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I must buy some handkerchiefs for her to  hem,&rdquo; she said to Gustave; &ldquo;it will be quite dreadful for her to have nothing  to do all day long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weather was warm and bright. The sea danced and  sparkled under the windows. Gustave was always in the same happy frame of mind.  An elegant landau had been secured for the period of their visit, and a pair of  capital horses carried them out on long and pleasant expeditions to the pretty  Sussex villages, or across the broad bare downs, beyond which the sea stretched  blue and bright.</p>
<p>In the evening, when the lamp was lighted and the  urn hissed gaily, Diana felt that she and her husband were at home. It was the  first home she had known &mdash; the first time she had been sole mistress and centre  of a household. She looked back at all the old desolation, the dreary shifting  from lodging to lodging, the degradation, the self-abasement, the dull apathy  of despair; and then she looked across at her husband as he lounged in his  easy-chair, contemplating her with dreamy adoring eye, in a kind of lazy  worship; and she knew that for this man she was the centre of the universe, the  very keystone in the arch of life.</p>
<p>She stretched out her hand to him with a smile, and  he pressed it fondly to his lips. There were twinkling jewels upon the slender  fingers; for the prettiest shop in Brighton &mdash; the brightest shop in Brighton &mdash;  had been ransacked that morning by the fond, frivolous, happy husband, as  pleased to bedeck his wife as a child to dress her last new doll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I ever be worthy of so much affection,  Gustave!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as he kissed the twinkling fingers.</p>
<p>And it did indeed seem to her that for this free  gift of love she could never render a sufficient recompense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wilt make C&ocirc;tenoir a home,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;thou  knowest not how I have sighed for a home. This room, with the lamplight shining  on thy face, and thy white hands moving about the teacups, and thy sweet smile,  which greets me every now and then when thou lookest by here, &mdash; it is more of  home than I have ever known since I left Beaubocage, that modest dwelling where  lived those two angels of kindness, my aunt and my grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one of those long pleasant drives to a distant  village nestling under the lee of a steep hill, the husband and wife had much  serious talk about the position of the former with reference to the Haygarth  estate. The result of that conversation was shown in a letter which Charlotte  Hawkehurst received the next day from her friend Diana Lenoble.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Albion Hotel, Brighton.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;EVER DEAR LOTTA, &mdash; Gustave and I have discussed  the Haygarth business with great satisfaction to ourselves, since it transpired  in the course of our conversation that we are both of one mind in the matter.  It is agreed between us that, as he is very well off already, and as he never  hoped or expected to inherit a fortune from his maternal ancestor, it is only  just that he should divide this unlooked-for wealth with his dear cousin, whose  claim to that inheritance he recognizes as equal to his own; the mere fact of  seniority making only a legal and not a moral difference in the degree of  relationship to the Reverend John Haygarth. Do you understand, darling? &mdash; <em>you</em> are to have half this money. My  husband will not step in between you and good fortune. I cannot tell you how  happy this determination of Gustave&rsquo;s has made me. I felt myself in a manner  base and ungrateful when I thought I was to share wealth that might have been  yours; but I ought to have better understood the justice of my husband&rsquo;s mind.  And now, dearest, all will be arranged very simply; Gustave will come to London  and see his lawyers, and execute some kind of deed, and the whole affair will  be settled.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;We have had some charming drive,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>Here the young wife branched off into a description  of the simple pleasures of their honeymoon holiday.</p>
<p>This letter was answered by Valentine Hawkehurst in  person. He came down to Brighton to thank his friends for their generous desire  to enrich his wife, and to decline, on her part, any share in John Haygarth&rsquo;s  wealth.</p>
<p>It was in vain that Gustave and Diana argued the  point, Mr. Hawkehurst was fixed as fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, it is better as it is,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Charlotte and I have arrived at this conviction with all due thought and  deliberation. We are both young, and the world is all before us. There is much  in the past that I have to redeem, as Diana well knows. It is better that I  should fight the battle of life unaided, and rise from the ranks by right of my  merit as a soldier. If ever we have need of help &mdash; if ever I find myself  breaking down &mdash; you may be sure that it is to you I shall come. By and by, if  Providence gives me children to work for, I will refuse no bounty that you may  bestow on them. Their future may be rendered secure by your generosity, if you  please, Lenoble; they will be your kindred. But for an alien like myself there  is no discipline so wholesome as honest hard work. I am as rich as John Milton  when he set up a school in St. Bride&rsquo;s Churchyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this resolution Mr. Hawkehurst adhered with a  gentle firmness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art chivalrous like Don Quixote,&rdquo; said  Gustave Lenoble; &ldquo;but it shall be as thou wouldest. Touch there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He offered his hand, which the other grasped with  all heartiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be godfather to thy little first one, and I  will settle on him ten thousand pounds before he cuts his first tooth,&rdquo; said  Gustave decisively.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter44"></a>Chapter 44<br>
  Beyond The Veil</h2>
<p>Diana and her husband did not linger long at  Brighton; they went back to town in time to see the last of that old wayfarer  whose troubled journey came to so peaceful an ending. It was a very calm haven  in which this battered old privateer lay at anchor after life&rsquo;s tempestuous  course; but to the Captain himself it seemed a hard thing that he should not  have been permitted one brief cruise upon that summer sea which danced so gaily  beneath the keel of the Lenobles&rsquo; prosperous bark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have shared adversity, my love,&rdquo; he said sadly,  when he talked with his daughter in the last few days; &ldquo;but your prosperity I  am to have no share in. Well, I suppose I have no right to complain. My life  has been an erring one; but poverty is the most vicious companion that a man  can consort with. If I had come into six or seven thousand a year, I might have  been as starch in my notions as a bishop; but I have been obliged to live,  Diana &mdash; that was the primary necessity, and I learnt to accommodate myself to  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That he had erred, the Captain was very ready to  acknowledge. That he had sinned deeply, and had much need to repent himself of  his iniquity, he was very slow to perceive. But sometimes, in the still watches  of the night, when the faint lamplight on the shadowy wall was more gloomy than  darkness, when the nurse, hired to assist his own man in these last days, dozed  in her comfortable chair, the truth came home to his shallow soul, and Horatio  Paget knew that he had been indeed a sinner, and very vile among sinners. Then,  for a moment, the veil of self-deception was lifted, and he saw his past life  as it had really been, &mdash; selfish, dishonourable, cruel beyond measure in  reckless injury of others. For a moment the awful book was opened, and the  sinner saw the fearful sum set against his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can wipe out the dread account?&rdquo; he asked  himself. &ldquo;Is there such a thing as forgiveness for a selfish useless life &mdash; a  life which is one long offence against God and man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In these long wakeful nights the dying man thought  much of his wife. The sweet tender face came back to him, with its mournful  wondering look. He knew, now, how his falsehoods and dishonours had wounded and  oppressed that gentle soul. He remembered how often she had pleaded for the  right, and how he had ridiculed her arguments, and set at naught her tender  pleadings. He had fancied her in a manner inimical to himself when she urged  the cause of some angry creditor or meek deluded landlady. Now, with the light  that is not upon earth or sea shining on the picture of his past career, he  could see and understand things as he had never seen or understood them before.  He knew now that it was for his own sake that faithful and devoted wife had pleaded,  his own interest that had been near to her pitying heart, as well as the  interest of bakers and butchers, landladies and tailors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might have made a good man of me, if I had let  her have her way,&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;I know that she is in heaven. Will  she plead for me, I wonder, at the foot of the Great Throne? I used to laugh at  her bad English, or fly in a passion with her sometimes, poor soul, when I  wanted her to pass for a lady, and she broke down outrageously. But there her  voice will be heard when mine appeals in vain. Dear soul! I wonder who taught  her to be so pure and unselfish, and trusting and faithful? She was a Christian  without knowing it. &lsquo;I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because  Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them  unto babes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of his wife&rsquo;s lonely deathbed, and  compared it with his own. For him there was luxury; by him watched a devoted  and all-forgiving daughter, a generous friend and son-in-law. All that could be  done to soothe the painful descent was done for him. For her there had been  nothing but loneliness and sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she might be certain of a speedy welcome in a  better home,&rdquo; thought Horatio; &ldquo;and I &mdash; ? Ah, dear kind creature, <em>there</em> the difference was all in her  favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the closing scene grew nearer, he thought more  and more of his gentle low-born wife, whose hold upon him in life had been so  slender, whose memory had occupied until now so insignificant a place in his  mind. His daughter watched with him unceasingly in the last two days and  nights. His mind wandered. On the day of his death he mistook Diana for that  long-lost companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not been a kind husband, Mary, my dear,&rdquo; he  faltered &ldquo;but the world has been hard upon me &mdash; debts &mdash; difficulties &mdash; crack  regiment &mdash; expensive mess &mdash; set of gamblers &mdash; no pity on a young man without  fortune &mdash; force of example &mdash; tied a millstone round my wretched neck before I  was twenty-one years of age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, when the doctor had felt his pulse for the  last time, he cried out suddenly, &ldquo;I have made a statement of my affairs, the  liabilities are numerous &mdash; the assets nil; but I rely on the clemency of this  court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were his last words. He sank into a kind of  stupor betwixt sleeping and waking, and in this he died.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter45"></a>Chapter 45<br>
  Better Than Gold</h2>
<p>The little fleet of paper boats which Mr. Sheldon  had pioneered so skilfully over the commercial seas came to grief very soon  after the disappearance of the admiral. A bill drawn upon the Honduras Mahogany  Company, Limited, was the first to reach maturity. The bill was referred to the  drawer &mdash; the drawer was not to be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not seen Sheldon for the last fortnight,&rdquo;  Mr. Orcott informed the gentleman who brought him the document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of business for a fortnight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not been in business for a month. His  stepdaughter has been very ill &mdash; at death&rsquo;s door, and all that kind of thing,  and my governor was awfully cut up about it. There used to be a couple of  doctors at the house every day, and no end of fuss. I took Sheldon his letters,  and managed matters for him here, and so on. And one fine morning my young lady  runs off and gets married on the quiet; so I suspect there was a good deal of  shamming about the illness &mdash; and those old fogies, the doctors, winked at it.  Between them all, I fancy Sheldon was completely sold; and he has turned savage  and gone off somewhere in the sulks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he had chosen any other time for his  sulks,&rdquo; said the holder of the bill; &ldquo;my partner and I have discounted several  acceptances for him. He gave us liberal terms, and we considered any paper of  his as safe as a Bank of England note; and now this confounded bill comes back  to us through our bankers, noted, &lsquo;Refer to drawer&rsquo; &mdash; a most unpleasant thing,  you know, and very inconsiderate of Sheldon to leave us in such a fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has forgotten the bill, I suppose,&rdquo; said Mr.  Orcott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but you see, really now, a business man  ought not to forget that kind of thing. And so Miss Halliday has made a runaway  match, has she? I remember seeing her when I dined at Bayswater &mdash; an uncommonly  fine girl. And she has gone and thrown herself away upon some penniless  scapegrace, most likely? Now, by the bye, how about this Honduras Company, Mr.  Orcott; they don&rsquo;t seem to have any London offices?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe not. We&rsquo;ve some of their prospectuses  somewhere about, I think. Would you like to see one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should, very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Orcott opened two or three drawers, and after  some little trouble produced the required document.</p>
<p>It was a very flourishing prospectus, setting forth  the enormous benefits to be derived by shareholders from the profitable  dealings of the company. Some good high-sounding names figured in the list of  directors, and the chairman was Captain H. N. Cromie Paget. The prospectus  looked well enough, but the holder of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s dishonoured bill was not  able to derive much comfort from high-sounding phrases and high-sounding names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down to Bayswater, and see if I can hear  anything of your governor,&rdquo; he said to Mr. Orcott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not there yesterday when I called, and his  servants could tell me nothing of his whereabouts,&rdquo; the young Yorkshireman said  very coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried the holder of the dishonoured bill  in some alarm. &ldquo;Now, really, that is not right; a business man ought not to do  that kind of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He called a cab and drove to the Lawn. There was  the smart gothic villa, with its pointed gables, and florid chimneys, and oriel  windows, and in the Tudor casements of the ground-floor appeared the bills of a  West-end auctioneer, announcing in large letters that the lease of this  charming mansion, together with the nearly new furniture, linen, books, china,  plate, carefully-selected proof-prints after distinguished modern artists,  small cellar of choice wines, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., would be disposed of  by auction on the following day.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s victim went into the house, where he  found some men preparing for the forthcoming sale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of all this?&rdquo; he asked,  aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bill of sale, sir. Messrs. Napthali and Zabulon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was enough. The holder of the bill went back  to the City. Another bill came due on the following day, and before the members  of the Stock Exchange took their luncheon, it was known that Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s  credit was among the things of the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always thought he was out of his depth,&rdquo; said  one set of talkers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the last man I should have expected to see  come to grief,&rdquo; said another set of talkers.</p>
<p>On settling-day came the awful proclamation &mdash;  Philip Sheldon had absconded, and would not meet his differences.</p>
<p>On the same day came a terrible revelation to Mr.  George Sheldon, of Gray&rsquo;s Inn, solicitor, genealogist, and pedigree hunter. The  first official step in the advancement of Gustave Lenoble&rsquo;s claim against the  Crown was taken by Messrs. Dashwood and Vernon, the solicitors, of Whitehall;  and George Sheldon discovered that between Charlotte Hawkehurst and the  Haygarth estate there stood a prior claimant, whereby all his toil, trouble,  costs out of pocket, and wear and tear of body and mind, had been wasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is enough to make a man go and cut his throat,&rdquo;  cried George, in his first savage sense of utter disappointment.</p>
<p>He went into his slovenly bedroom, and took out one  of his razors, and felt the corrugated surface of the left side of his neck  meditatively. But the razor was blunt, and the corrugated surface seemed very  tough and unmanageable; so George Sheldon decided that this kind of operation  was an affair which might be deferred.</p>
<p>He heard the next day that his brother was <em>non est</em>, and, in his own phraseology,  that there was a pretty kettle of fish in the City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Phil and I seem to have brought our  pigs to a very nice market,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I dare say, wherever that fellow has  gone, he has carried a well-lined purse with him. But I wouldn&rsquo;t have his  conscience for all the wealth of the Rothschilds. It&rsquo;s bad enough to see Tom  Halliday&rsquo;s face as I see it sometimes. What must it be to <em>him</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little more than a year after this, and the  yellow corn was waving on the fertile plains of Normandy, fruit ripening in  orchards on hillside and in valley; merry holiday folks splashing and dabbling  in the waves that wash the yellow sands of Dieppe; horses coming to grief in  Norman steeplechases; desperate gamesters losing their francs and half-francs  in all kinds of frivolous games in the Dieppe <em>&eacute;tablissement</em>; and yonder, in the heart of Normandy, beyond the  tall steeples of Rouen, a happy family assembled at the Chateau C&ocirc;tenoir.</p>
<p>One happy family &mdash; two happy families rather, but  so closely united by the bonds of love and friendship as to seem indeed one.  Here are Gustave Lenoble and his young wife Diana, with two tall slender  damsels by their side; and here is Valentine Hawkehurst, the successful young  scribbler, with his fair young wife Charlotte; and out on the terrace yonder  are two nurses walking with two babies, at that early, and, to some minds,  obnoxious stage of babyhood in which a perpetual rocking, and pacing to and  fro, and swaying backwards and forwards in the air, is necessary for the  preservation of anything approaching tranquillity. But to the minds of the two  young mothers and the two proud fathers, these small creatures in their long  white robes seem something too bright for earth. The united ages of the babies  do not amount to six months; but the mothers have counted every gradual stage  of these young lives, and to both it seems as if there had been no time in  which the children were not, with so firm a hold have they possessed themselves  of every thought in the foolish maternal mind, of every impulse in the weak  maternal heart.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawkehurst has brought her son to see his aunt  Diana; for Diana has insisted upon assuming that relationship by  letters-patent, as it were. Madame Lenoble&rsquo;s baby is a daughter, and this fact  in itself seems to the two friends to be a special interposition of Providence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not be delightful if they should grow up  to love each other and marry?&rdquo; exclaimed Diana; and Charlotte agreed with her  that such an event in the future did indeed seem in a manner foreshadowed by  the conduct of the infants in the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He takes notice of her already!&rdquo; she exclaimed,  looking out at the little creature in white muslin robes, held up against the  warm blue sky; &ldquo;see, they are cooing at each other! I am sure that must be  cooing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the two mothers went out upon the sunny  terrace-walk and fondly contemplated these domestic treasures, until the  domestic treasures were seized with some of the inexplicable throes and  mysterious agonies of early babyhood, and had to be borne off shrieking to  their nurseries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear angel,&rdquo; said Gustave, of his &ldquo;little last  one,&rdquo; &ldquo;she has the very shriek of Clarice here, poignant and penetrating, until  to drown the heart. Dost thou figure to thyself that thy voice was penetrating  as that, my beautiful, in the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed his beautiful, and she ran off to join  the procession following the two babies, &mdash; alarmed nurses, distracted mammas,  shrieking infants, anxious damsels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>C&rsquo;est un  vrai tourbillon</em>,&rdquo; as Gustave remarked to his companion Valentine  Hawkehurst; &ldquo;these women, how they love their children! What of saints, what of  Madonnas, what of angels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon he spouted Victor Hugo:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Lorsque l&rsquo;enfant para&icirc;t, le cercle de famille<br>
  Applaudit &agrave; grands cris; son doux regard qui brille<br>
  Fait briller tous les yeux;<br>
  Et les plus tristes fronts, les plus souill&eacute;s peut-&ecirc;tre,<br>
  Se d&eacute;rident soudain &agrave; voir l&rsquo;enfant para&icirc;tre,<br>
Innocent et joyeux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All things had gone well for M. Lenoble. His direct  descent from Matthew Haygarth, the father of the intestate, had been proved to  the satisfaction of Crown lawyers and High Court of Chancery, and he had been  in due course placed in possession of the reverend intestate&rsquo;s estate, to the  profit and pleasure of his solicitors and M. Fleurus, and to the unspeakable  aggravation of George Sheldon, who washed his hands at once and for ever of all  genealogical research, and fell back in an embittered and angry spirit upon the  smaller profits to be derived from petty transactions in the bill-discounting  line, and a championship of penniless sufferers of all classes, from a damsel  who considered herself jilted by a fickle swain, in proof of whose inconstancy  she could produce documentary evidence of the &ldquo;pork-chop and tomato sauce&rdquo;  order, to a pedestrian who knocked his head against a projecting shutter in the  Strand, and straightway walked home to Holloway to lay himself up for a  twelvemonth in a state of mental and bodily incapacity requiring large  pecuniary redress from the owner of the fatal shutter. To this noble protection  of the rights of the weak did George Sheldon devote his intellect; and when  malicious enemies stigmatized these Quixotic endeavours as &ldquo;speculative  actions,&rdquo; or when, in the breaking-down of some oppressed damsel&rsquo;s cause by  reason of the slender evidence afforded by some reticent lover&rsquo;s epistolary  effusions, unjust judges told him that he &ldquo;ought to be ashamed of himself&rdquo; for  bringing such an action, the generous attorney no doubt took consolation from  an approving conscience, and went forth from that court, to look for other  oppressed damsels or injured wayfarers, erect and unshaken.</p>
<p>Some little profit Mr. Sheldon of Gray&rsquo;s Inn did  derive from the Haygarth estate; for at the request of Gustave Lenoble Messrs.  Dashwood and Vernon sent him a cheque for one thousand pounds, as the price of  those early investigations which had set the artful Captain upon the right  track. He wrote a ceremoniously grateful letter to Gustave Lenoble on receiving  this honorarium. It is always well to be grateful for benefits received from a  rich man; but in the depths of his heart he execrated the fortunate inheritor  of the Haygarthian thousands.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst was not quite so vehement in the  expression of his feelings as that lively Celt, Gustave; but deep in his heart  there was a sense of happiness no less pure and exalted.</p>
<p>Providence had given him more than he had ever  dared to hope; not John Haygarth&rsquo;s thousands; not a life of luxurious idleness,  and dinner-giving, and Derby days, and boxes on the grand tier, and carriage-horses  at five hundred guineas a pair; not a palace in Belgravia, and a shooting-box  in the Highlands, and a villa at Cowes; not these things, in which he would  once have perceived the <em>summum bonum</em>;  but a fair price for his labour, a dear young wife, a tranquil home.</p>
<p>Nor had his researches among the dusty records of  the departed Haygarths been profitless in a pecuniary sense to himself. Gustave  Lenoble insisted that he should accept that honorarium of three thousand pounds  which had been promised by George Sheldon as the reward of his success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Paget would never have been put on the  right track if he had not filched your secrets from you,&rdquo; said the son and heir  of Susan Meynell. &ldquo;It is to your researches, in the first place, that I owe  this inheritance; and you cannot refuse to accept the agreed price of your  labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine did not refuse this fairly-earned reward,  nor did he oppose the settlement which Gustave made in favour of Charlotte&rsquo;s  infant son. It seemed to him only just that some share of the heritage should  fall to the descendant of poor Susan&rsquo;s younger sister and faithful friend.</p>
<p>With this capital of three thousand pounds  comfortably invested in consols, and with the interest of that sum of ten  thousand pounds settled on his infant son, Mr. Hawkehurst began the world, in  his new character of a husband and a father, very pleasantly.</p>
<p>Of his literary career very little need be said  here. He was yet at the beginning of the long dusty road that leads to the  temple of Fame. It is enough to state that he found the dusty high-road rather  difficult walking, and that he was pelted with more mud, flung by nameless  assailants hidden behind the hedges, than he had anticipated when he set out  upon the first stage of his journey. Happily, he found pleasant  fellow-travellers and kindly encouragement from an indulgent public, and was  thus able to accept the mud which bespattered his garments in a very placid  spirit, and to make light of all obstacles in the great highway.</p>
<p>The cottage at Wimbledon was no longer a dream. It  was a pleasant reality, the pride and delight of Mrs. Sheldon and Ann Woolper.  It was a picturesque dwelling-place, half cottage, half villa, situated on the  broad high-road from London to Kingston, with all the woodland of Richmond Park  to be seen from the windows at the back. Only a wall divided Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s  gardens from the coverts of the Queen. It was like a royal demesne, Charlotte  said; whereupon her husband insisted that it should be christened by the name  of a royal dwelling, and so called it Charlottenburgh.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst had secured this delightful abode  for a considerable term of years, and upon the furnishing and decoration of the  pretty rustic rooms Charlotte and he lavished unmeasured care. The delicious  excitement of &ldquo;picking up,&rdquo; or, in more elegant parlance, &ldquo;collecting,&rdquo; was to  these two happy people an inexhaustible source of pleasure. Every eccentric  little table, every luxurious chair, had its special history, and had been the  subject of negotiation and diplomacy that might have sufficed a Burleigh in the  reorganization of Western Europe. The little Dresden and Vienna cups and  saucers in the maple cabinet had been every one bought from a different dealer.  The figures on the mantelpiece were Old Chelsea, of a quality that would have  excited the envy of a Bernal or a Bonn, and had only fallen to the proud  possessors by a sequence of fortuitous circumstances, the history of which was  almost as thrilling as the story of Boehmer&rsquo;s diamond-necklace. The curtains in  the drawing-room had draped the <em>porti&egrave;res</em> of the lovely Lady Blessington, and had been bought for a song by Valentine  Hawkehurst, after passing through the hands of brokers and dealers innumerable.  The tapestry-covered Louis-Quatorze chairs had belonged to Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;,  and had furnished that dull country house whence she wrote the liveliest  letters extant to her disreputable cousin, Bussy, Count of Babutin. These  inestimable treasures had been picked up by Mr. and Mrs. Hawkehurst from a  bric-&agrave;-brac merchant in a little court at the back of the Rue Vivienne, whither  the young couple had gone arm-in-arm to choose a bonnet on their first  pleasure-trip to Paris. The clock in the modest dining-room had been secured  from the repository of the same merchant, and was warranted to have sounded the  last domestic hours of Maximilian Robespierre in his humble lodging <em>chez le Menuisier</em>. The inkstand into  which Mr. Hawkehurst dipped his rapid pen had served the literary career of  Voltaire; the blotting-book on which he wrote had been used by Balzac.</p>
<p>To the plausible fictions of the second-hand dealer  Mr. and Mrs. Hawkehurst lent willing ears, and it seemed to them as if these  associations, for which they had paid somewhat dearly, imparted a new grace to  their home.</p>
<p>The arrangement and superintendence of all these  treasures gave poor Georgy endless pleasure and employment; but in her heart of  hearts she believed in the prim splendours of the dismantled Lawn as much  superior to these second-hand objects of art and upholstery. Nor did Ann  Woolper regard the Chelsea figures and Dresden teacups and old black  Albert-D&uuml;rer engravings as anything better than an innocent eccentricity on the  part of the master of the house, for the saving of whose purse she managed and  economized as faithfully as she had done for that lost master whereof the  memory was so bitter.</p>
<p>It will be seen, therefore, that Mr. Hawkehurst  with a wife, a mother-in-law, and a faithful old servant, was likely to be well  taken care of; a little spoiled perhaps by &ldquo;much cherishing,&rdquo; but carefully  guarded from all those temptations which are supposed to assail the bachelor  man-of-letters, toiling alone and neglected in Temple chambers. For him the  days passed in a pleasant monotony of constant labour, lightened always by the  thought of those for whom he worked, cheered ever by the fond hope of future  fame. He was no longer a bookmaker. He had written a book, the proceeds of  which had enabled him to furnish the Wimbledon villa; and he was engaged in  writing a second book, the fruits whereof would secure the needs of the  immediate future. He had insured his life for a considerable amount, and had  shown himself in all things prudent to a degree that verged upon Philistinism.  But the policies taken out on Charlotte&rsquo;s life by Mr. Sheldon had been suffered  to lapse. Valentine would have no money staked on that dear head.</p>
<p>The steed which Charlotte had desired for her  husband&rsquo;s pleasure, the library which she had catalogued so often, were yet  among the delights of the future; but life has lost half its brightness when  there is no unfulfilled desire left to the dreamer; and the horse which Mr.  Hawkehurst was to ride in time to come, and the noble library which he was to  collect, were the pleasant themes of Charlotte&rsquo;s conversation very often, as  she and her husband walked on the heights of Wimbledon in the twilight, when  his day&rsquo;s work was done.</p>
<p>These twilight walks were the happy holidays of his  life, and a part of his liberal education. He told his wife everything, every  literary scheme, every fancy, every shadowy outline of future work, every new  discovery in the boundless realms of Bookland. His enthusiasm; his  hero-worship; his setting-up of one favourite and knocking-down of another; his  unchristian pleasure in that awful slating of poor Jones in this week&rsquo;s <em>Saturday</em>, or the flaying alive of  Robinson in the <em>Bond Street Backbiter</em>;  &mdash; in a word, his &ldquo;shop&rdquo; never became wearisome to Charlotte. She listened  always with a like rapture and sympathy; she worshipped his favourites of Bookland;  she welcomed his friends and fellow-workers with unvarying sweetness; she  devised and superintended the fitting-up of a smoking-room that was perfectly  paradisaical, a glimpse of the Alhambra in miniature; and that obnoxious dish,  the cold shoulder, was never served in Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s dwelling. So sweet a  wife, so pleasant a home, popularized the institution of matrimony among the  young writer&rsquo;s bachelor friends; and that much-abused and cruelly maligned  member of the human race, the mother-in-law, was almost rehabilitated by Mrs.  Sheldon&rsquo;s easy good-nature and evident regard for the interests of her  daughter&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>And after all the groping among dry as dust records  of a bygone century, after all the patient following of those faint traces on  the sands of time left by the feet of Matthew Haygarth, <em>this</em> was Charlotte&rsquo;s Inheritance, &mdash; a heart whose innocence and  affection made home a kind of earthly paradise, and gave to life&rsquo;s commonest  things a charm that all the gold ever found in California could not have  imparted to them. This was Charlotte&rsquo;s Inheritance, &mdash; the tender, unselfish  nature of the Haygarths and Hallidays; and thus dowered, her husband would not  have exchanged her for the wealthiest heiress whose marriage was ever  chronicled in <em>Court Circular</em> or <em>Court Journal</em>.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter46"></a>Chapter 46<br>
  Lost Sight Of</h2>
<p>A year and a half had passed since the  disappearance of Philip Sheldon from the circle in which he had been considered  a person of some importance. The repudiation of those bills by which he had  sustained his exhausted credit, or rather the discovery that the companies upon  which the bills pretended to be drawn were of all shadows the most shadowy, had  brought consternation upon many, and ruin upon some. Bitter and unmeasured were  the terms in which City men spoke of that Phil Sheldon with whom they had eaten  the sacred bait and quaffed the social moselle in the taverns of Greenwich and  Blackwall.</p>
<p>There is a saying current on the Stock Exchange to  the effect that the man who fails, and disappears from among his fellows behind  a curtain of commercial cloud, is sure to return sooner or later to his old  circle, with a moustache and a brougham. For Philip Sheldon there was, however,  no coming back. The moustache and the brougham of the chastened and penitent defaulter  were not for him. By his deliberate and notorious dishonour he had shut the  door against the possibility of return. It may be supposed that the defaulter  knew this, for he did not come back; and since he had no lack of moral courage,  he would scarcely have refrained from showing himself once more in his old  haunts, if it had been possible for him to face the difficulties of his  position.</p>
<p>Time passed, and there came no tidings of the  missing man, though a detective was despatched to America in search of him by  one vengeful sufferer among the many victims of the fictitious  bills-of-exchange. It was supposed that he must inevitably go to America, and  thither went his pursuer, but with no result except the expenditure of money  and the further exasperation of the vengeful sufferer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do with him, if you get him?&rdquo; asked  a philosophical friend of the sufferer. &ldquo;He has nothing to surrender. Zabulon  had a bill-of-sale on his furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furniture!&rdquo; cried the infuriated victim; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  want his furniture. I want his flesh and bones. I want to shut him up in  Dartmoor Prison, or to get him twenty years&rsquo; hard labour at Portland Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sort of man would get a ticket-of-leave in  less than twelve months,&rdquo; replied the philosophic friend. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you are  only throwing good money after bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The event proved this gentleman but too able a  seer. In the monster city of New York Philip Sheldon had disappeared like a  single drop of water flung upon the Atlantic Ocean. There was no trace of him:  too intangible for the grasp of international law, he melted into the mass of  humanity, only one struggler the more in the great army perpetually fighting  life&rsquo;s desperate battle.</p>
<p>From among all those who had known him this man had  utterly vanished, and not one sigh of regret followed him in his unknown  wanderings &mdash; not one creature amongst all those who had taken his hand and  given him friendly greeting thought of him kindly, or cared to know whither he  went or how he prospered. He had not left in the house that had sheltered him  for years so much as a dog to whine at his door or listen for his returning  footstep.</p>
<p>This fact, if he had known it or considered it,  would have troubled him very little. He had played his game for a certain  stake, and had lost it. This he felt, and cursed his own too cautious play as  the cause of his defeat. That there were higher stakes for which he might have  played an easier game, was a fact that never occurred to him. In his philosophy  there was indeed nothing higher given to the hopes of man than worldly success,  and a dull, cold, prosperous life spent among prosperous acquaintance.</p>
<p>He was gone, and those who remembered him most  keenly &mdash; Valentine Hawkehurst, Diana Paget, Ann Woolper &mdash; remembered him with a  shudder. The old Yorkshirewoman thought of him sometimes as she bent over the  little muslin-bedecked cradle where the hope of the Hawkehursts slumbered, and  looked round fearfully in the gloaming, half expecting to see his dreaded face  glower upon her, dark and threatening, from between the curtains of the window.</p>
<p>It was a belief of all ancient races, nay indeed, a  belief still current amongst modern nations, that it is not given to man to  behold the beings of another world and live. The Arab who meets a phantom in  the desert goes home to his tent to die. He knows that the hand of doom is upon  him. He has seen that upon which, for mortal eyes, it is fatal to look. And it  is thus in some measure with those who are admitted within the dark precincts  of murder&rsquo;s dread sanctuary. Not swiftly does the curtain fall which has once  been lifted from the hidden horrors of that ghastly temple. The revelations of  an utterly wicked soul leave a lasting impress upon the mind which unwillingly  becomes recipient of those awful secrets.</p>
<p>The circumstances of Tom Halliday&rsquo;s death and of  Charlotte&rsquo;s illness were not to be forgotten by Ann Woolper. The shadow of that  dark cruel face, which had lain upon her bosom forty years before, haunted many  a peaceful hour of her quiet old age. Her ignorance, and that faint tinge of  superstition which generally accompanies ignorance, exaggerated the terror of  those dark memories. The thought that Philip Sheldon still lived, still had the  power to plot and plan evil against the innocent, was an ever-present source of  terror to her. She could not understand that such an element could exist among  the forces of evil without fatal result to some one. It seemed to her as if a  devil were at large, and there could be neither peace nor security until the  evil spirit was exorcised, the baneful presence laid in nethermost depths of  unfathomable sea.</p>
<p>These feelings and these fears would scarcely have  arisen in the old woman&rsquo;s breast, had she alone been subject to the possible  plottings of that evil nature. For herself she had little fear. Her span of  life was nearly ended; very few were the sands that had yet to run; and, for  her own sake, she would have cared little if some rough hand had spilt them  untimely. But a new interest in life had been given to Mrs. Woolper just as  life drew near its close. That peerless child, the son and heir of the  Hawkehursts, had been intrusted to the old woman&rsquo;s care; and this infant she  loved with an affection much more intense than that which had once made Philip  Sheldon so dear to her.</p>
<p>It was by the cradle of this much-treasured child  that Ann Woolper nursed her fear of her old master. She knew that he had been  counter-plotted and beaten ignominiously in that deadly game which he had  played so boldly. And she asked herself whether he was the man to submit to  such utter defeat without any effort to revenge himself upon those who had  helped to compass his failure.</p>
<p>On that night when Charlotte Halliday had lain  between life and death, suffering on the one hand from the effects of a  prolonged and gradual course of poison, on the other from the violent measures  taken to eliminate that poisonous element from her system, &mdash; on that night when  the precious life yet trembled in the balance, Ann Woolper had seen murderous  looks in the face of the man whom she dared boldly to defy, and who knew in  that hour that his ghastly plot was discovered. Even now, secure in a haven of  safety, she could not forget that baneful look in Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s eyes. She  could not find perfect rest while she knew not where that man might be, or what  mischief he might be plotting against those she loved.</p>
<p>Her fears showed themselves in many ways. When she  read of dark and vengeful deeds in her newspaper, she thought of her old  master, and how, in such or such an act, his fatal hand might reveal itself. He  might lie in wait for Valentine some night on the dark road between  Charlottenburgh and the distant railway-station. She could fancy the young  wife&rsquo;s agony of terror as the night wore on, and her husband did not return;  the unspeakable horror that would come over all that happy household when the  news came that its young master had been found on the lonely road slain by some  unknown hand. Open utterance to her fears she was too wise to give; but she  warned Mr. Hawkehurst of the dangers on that dark road, and besought him to arm  himself with a trusty bludgeon wherewith to meet and vanquish any chance  assailant. Valentine laughed at her anxious warning; but when Charlotte took up  the cry he was fain to content her by the purchase of a sturdy stick, which he  swung cheerily to and fro as he walked homewards in the gloaming, planning a  chapter in his new book, and composing powerful and eloquent sentences which  eluded his mental grasp when he tried to reduce his evening reverie to  pen-and-ink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the air blows fresh across the common, and  the distant lights twinkle, and the bright stars peep out in the pale-yellow  sky, my language flows as it never does when I sit at my desk, Lotta,&rdquo; he said  to his wife. &ldquo;I feel myself a Swift or a Junius out there; equal to the  tackling of any social question that ever arose upon this earth, from the Wood  halfpence to the policy of American taxation, and triennial elections. At home  I am only Valentine Hawkehurst, with an ever-present consciousness that so many  pages of copy are required from me within a given time, and that my  son-and-heir is cutting his teeth, and making more fuss about it than I ever  made about <em>my</em> teeth; and that the man  about the water-rate is waiting to see me, please, and is desperately anxious  about making-up his books; and that I have the dearest wife in Christendom, who  opens my door, and puts her pretty head into my room once in half an hour to  see how I am getting on, or to ask whether I want any more coals, or to borrow  my ink to make-up her washing-book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, sir, that I prevent your becoming a  Junius?&rdquo; cried Charlotte, with an enchanting <em>moue</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear. I begin to understand why Swift kept  his poor ill-used wife at a respectful distance. She would have made him too  happy if he had allowed her to be on the premises. She would have given the  cruel indignation no chance of lacerating his heart; and such writing as  Swift&rsquo;s is only produced by a man whose heart is so lacerated. No, my darling,  I shall never be a Swift or a Junius while your pretty head is thrust into my  room once or twice an hour; but I may hope to be something better, if bright  eyes can inspire bright thoughts, and innocent smiles give birth to pleasant  fancies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this there was the usual little demonstration of  affection between this young couple; and Charlotte praised her husband as the  most brilliant and admirable of men; after which pleasing flattery she favoured  him with a little interesting information about the baby&rsquo;s last tooth, and the  contumacious behaviour of the new housemaid, between whom and Mrs. Woolper  there had been a species of disagreement, which the Yorkshirewoman described as  a &ldquo;standfurther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus occupied in simple pleasures and simple cares,  the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Hawkehurst went on, untroubled by any fear of that  crime-burdened wretch whose image haunted the dreams and meditations of Ann  Woolper. For these two Mr. Sheldon was numbered among the dead. To Charlotte  the actual truth had never been revealed; but she had been, in the course of  time, given to understand that her stepfather had committed some unpardonable  sin, which must for ever separate him from herself and her mother. She had been  told as much as this, and had been told that she must seek to know no more. To  this she submitted without questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry for him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and for  mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She concluded that the unpardonable offence must  needs have been some sin against her mother, some long-hidden infidelity  brought suddenly to light, with all the treachery and falsehood involved  therein. She never mentioned her stepfather after this but in her prayers the  sinner was not forgotten.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter47"></a>Chapter 47<br>
  Eteocles And Polynices</h2>
<p>George Sheldon went his ways, picking up as good a  living as he could from that chivalrous assertion of the rights of the weak  which has been already described; and the thought of his brother&rsquo;s sin-burdened  soul troubled him very little. He did think of Tom Halliday; for that last  grasp of the honest Yorkshireman&rsquo;s hand, that last look in his old friend&rsquo;s  face, were haunting memories which this sharp practitioner had found himself  powerless to exorcise. If his brother, after an absence of many years in the  remote regions of the East Indies, had come home to his fatherland with a  colossal fortune, and the reputation of having strangled a few natives during  the process of amassing that fortune, George Sheldon would have welcomed the  returning wanderer, and would, in his own parlance, have &ldquo;swallowed the  natives.&rdquo; A few niggers, more or less, sent untimely to Gehenna, would have  seemed scarcely sufficient cause for quarrel with a fraternal and  liberally-disposed millionaire. But the circumstances of Tom Halliday&rsquo;s death  had brought all the horror of crime and treachery home to the spectator of that  deliberate assassination, and had produced such an impression as no other  circumstances could on so hard a nature.</p>
<p>It was some satisfaction to George Sheldon to know  that his old friend&rsquo;s daughter had found a happy home; and he was apt to take  some credit from his own share in his brother&rsquo;s discomfiture. He met Valentine  sometimes in the course of his peregrinations in the neighbourhood of the  British Museum, and the greeting between the two men was sufficiently cordial;  but Mr. Hawkehurst did not invite his old employer to Charlottenburgh, and  George was able to comprehend that to that household no one bearing the name of  Sheldon could be a welcome visitor.</p>
<p>He jogged on comfortably enough in his own way;  living in his chambers, and consorting with a few chosen friends and kindred  spirits of the jolly-good-fellow class, whom he met at an old-established  tavern in the west-central district, and in whose society, and the society of  the subscription-ground in the Farringdon Road, he found the <em>summum bonum</em> in the way of social  intercourse. He did a little speculation upon the turf, and discounted the  bills of needy bookmakers, or bought up their bad debts, and thereby gained  introductions to the noble patrons of the humble &ldquo;scums,&rdquo; and pushed his  business into new grooves. He had no idea that such an existence was in any way  ignoble; nay, indeed, when he had paid his rent, and his clerk, and his  laundress, and his tavern score, and &ldquo;stood glasses round&rdquo; amongst his friends,  he lighted his cigar, and thrust his hands into the depths of his pockets, and  paced the flags of Holborn happy in the belief that he had performed the whole  duty of man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are men whose business obliges them to keep  up an establishment, and go to church twice a day, and all that kind of thing,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;and I dare say they find it pay. My clients don&rsquo;t care a doit where I  live, or how I spend my Sundays; and I&rsquo;d rather have five pounds a week and my  liberty than the best family connection in the Fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fate of that wretched man, who had dropped out  of his old circle and vanished no one knew whither, in no manner disturbed the  peace of George Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my word for it, that gentleman has fallen on  his feet,&rdquo; he said, on the only occasion when the fate of Philip was discussed  by Valentine and himself. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing well enough, somewhere or other, you may  depend; but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll ever be able to show his nose in London after  those bill transactions. There&rsquo;s a very strong feeling against him on &rsquo;Change.  He&rsquo;s looked upon as a discredit to the order, and that sort of thing, you see.  It isn&rsquo;t often a member of the House goes to the bad like that. No, I don&rsquo;t  think Phil will ever show himself in London again; but such a man as that can  always find a platform somewhere&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And go on to the end of his days unpunished, I  suppose,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
  Hawkehurst, with some bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes; I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s to touch him in the  future. Of course he could be dropped upon for those bills, if he came in the  way of being dropped upon; but, as I said before, he&rsquo;s too deep a card for  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus did George Sheldon dismiss the subject. That  his brother was an exile for life from his native land he did not doubt; but he  took it for granted that in whatever distant spot of earth Philip had found a  refuge, he would there contrive to prosper and to show a bold front in the city  of his adoption.</p>
<p>This belief Mr. Sheldon of Gray&rsquo;s Inn cherished  until one snowy Christmas Eve, a year and a half after that event, or series of  events, which the lawyer briefly designated &ldquo;the burst-up at Bayswater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bleak and bitter was that December, a December not  long gone by. The heart of the prosperous British nation melted as the heart of  one man. The columns of the <em>Zeus</em> and  the <em>Diurnal Hermes</em>, the <em>Flag</em> and the <em>Hesper</em>, overflowed with the record of subscriptions to charity  funds; and the leaders of the morning journals all preached the same kindly  sermon on the same Christian text. Thick lay the snow upon the housetops;  &ldquo;thick and slab&rdquo; the greasy slush upon the pavements of crowded thoroughfares;  merry the rogues and ragamuffins of the great city. The ideal Christmas of our  dreams seemed to have come at last, and the heart of every true Briton  rejoiced; while skaters in the parks made merry, and cabmen demanded fabulous  sums of helpless wayfarers; and luckless, overworked, under-fed horses stumbled  and fell at every turn, and the familiar steep of Holborn was dangerous as  Alpine mountain.</p>
<p>To George Sheldon neither the weather nor the  Christmas season made much difference. The even current of his life was little  disturbed by festive pleasures or dissipations. An extra glass at his tavern,  an invitation to dinner from some friend in the bill-discounting line, were the  most exciting events the season was likely to bring him. He saw the shops  brighten suddenly with semi-supernal glories of crystallized fruits and  gorgeous bonbon-boxes, and he was aware of a kind of movement in the streets  that was brisker and gayer than the plodding hurry of everyday life. He stood  aside and let the mummeries go by him, and was glad when these Christmas  follies were done with, and the law-courts in full swing once more. In the  happiest and most innocent days of his youth, Christmas had brought him no more  than extraordinary indulgences in the way of eating and drinking, swiftly  followed by that dread avenger, the demon of the bilious.</p>
<p>Upon this particular occasion Mr. Sheldon had  pledged himself to dine with a horsey publican lately retired from business,  and big with all the pride and glory of a &ldquo;place&rdquo; at Hornsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down and see my place, Sheldon,&rdquo; this  gentleman had said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to do the swell thing; but I force my own  pines and grow my own grapes, and can put as good a dessert on my table as you  could buy in Covent Garden for a five-pun&rsquo; note. That&rsquo;s my missus&rsquo;s fad, that  is, and I can afford it; so why shouldn&rsquo;t I do it? You come and eat your  Christmas dinner with us, Sheldon. I&rsquo;ve got a friend coming that can sing as  good a song as Reeves hisself, and might make a fortune, if he wasn&rsquo;t above coming  out at one of them music-halls. And I&rsquo;ll give you a bottle of Madeira that you  won&rsquo;t match at any nobleman&rsquo;s table, if noblemen&rsquo;s tables was in your line of  business, which you and I know they ain&rsquo;t, old fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the jolly good fellow dug his fat fingers  into George Sheldon&rsquo;s ribs, and George accepted the invitation; not with any  elation of spirits, but sufficiently pleased to secure a good dinner with a man  who promised to be a profitable client, and whose house was within a reasonable  cab-fare from the west-central district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cabmen are trying it on, anyhow, just now,&rdquo;  thought Mr. Sheldon; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll try it on with me. And if they  do, there&rsquo;s the Marylebone stage. I&rsquo;m not afraid of a five-mile walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having accepted this invitation, and thus disposed  of his Christmas-day, George Sheldon refrained from the delights of social  converse at his tavern on Christmas-eve, and occupied himself with business.  His clerk left him at the usual hour; but the master sat, long after dark,  writing letters and reading law-papers, while the snow drifted against his  windows and whitened the quiet quadrangle below.</p>
<p>He had just laid aside his papers and lighted a  cigar, when he was startled by a stealthy knocking at his door. He was not  unaccustomed to late visitors, as he was known to live at his chambers, and to  work after office-hours; but the knocking of to-night was not the loud  rollicking rat-a-tat of his jolly-good-fellow friends or clients. If he had  been a student of light literature, and imbued with the ghostly associations of  the season, he would have gone to his door expecting to behold a weird figure  clothed in the vestments of the last century; or an old woman in ruff and  martingale, whose figure in the flesh had once haunted those legal precincts;  or the ghostly semblance of the Baron of Verulam himself, revisiting the  glimpses of the moon and the avenue of elms that were planted by his order.</p>
<p>In George Sheldon&rsquo;s nature there was, however, no  lurking dread of fiend or phantom. His ideas in connection with ghosts were  limited to a white sheet, a broomstick, and a hollow turnip with a lighted  candle inside it; and he would have set down the most awful apparition that  ever was revealed to German ghost-seer, with a scornful grin, as a member of  the sheet and-hollow-turnip confraternity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how it&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he would have said, if the  spectral form had glowered upon him in midnight churchyard or ruined abbey.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go and try it on somewhere else, my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>To a superstitious mind the THING which crept  across the dark lobby and dragged itself into the glare of the gas-lighted  office might have seemed, indeed, some creature too loathsome for humanity. A  plague-stricken corpse galvanized into a spasmodic life could scarcely have  lifted to the light a more awful countenance than that on which George Sheldon  looked with mingled anger and disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want here&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Do you take this  for the workhouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the creature answered, in a faint hoarse  voice; &ldquo;but I take you for my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;WHAT!&rdquo; cried George Sheldon, aghast.</p>
<p>He bent down and looked at the awful face. Yes,  from the cavernous hollows of those sunken cheeks, beneath the shaggy penthouse  of those bony brows, the fierce black eyes of Philip Sheldon looked out at him  with a savage glare that he had never seen in them before &mdash; even when the  savage nature of the man had revealed itself most nakedly &mdash; the fierce glare of  fever and starvation.</p>
<p>This walking horror, this mass of loathsome rags  endued with motion, this living disease, was the sometime prosperous  stockbroker, the man whom it had been impossible to think of except furnished  with linen of spotless whiteness, and the glossy broad-cloth, and well-made  boots, and keyless chronometer, and silk umbrella of commercial success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; exclaimed George, horror-stricken, &ldquo;is  it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s I,&rdquo; answered the creature in his strange  husky accents; and the change &mdash; nay, indeed, the degradation, of the voice was  as complete as the degradation of the man. &ldquo;Yes, George, it&rsquo;s I; your brother  Phil. You&rsquo;re surprised to see me fallen so low in the world, I suppose; but you  can&rsquo;t be more surprised than I am myself. I&rsquo;ve tried hard enough to hold my  head above water. There&rsquo;s scarcely any trade that mortal man ever tried to earn  his bread by, that I haven&rsquo;t tried &mdash; and failed in. It has been the experience  of Fitzgeorge-street over and over again, in every trade and every profession.  I started as doctor in Philadelphia, and was doing well; &mdash; till &mdash; till a patient  died &mdash; and things went against me. I&rsquo;ve been clerk in more offices than you can  count on your ten fingers; but there was always something &mdash; my employer  levanted, or was bankrupt, or died, or dismissed me. I&rsquo;ve been  travelling-dentist, auctioneer, commission-agent, tout, pedlar, out yonder; but  it all came to the same thing &mdash; ruin, starvation, the hospital, or the pauper&rsquo;s  ward. I have swept crossings in the city, and camped out in the wilderness  among the bears and opossums. One day I thought I&rsquo;d come home. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s  George,&rsquo; I said to myself; &lsquo;if I can get money enough to take me across the  Atlantic, I shall be all right. George will give me a lift.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t stand  alone in the world. A man&rsquo;s own flesh and blood won&rsquo;t let him starve &mdash; can&rsquo;t  let him starve. Blood&rsquo;s thicker than water, you know, George. So I came home. I  got the money; never you mind how. I needn&rsquo;t tell you what it cost me to scrape  half-a-dozen pounds together. When a man&rsquo;s as low down in the world as I am,  there&rsquo;s not a shilling he earns that doesn&rsquo;t cost him a drop of his heart&rsquo;s  blood; there&rsquo;s not a pound he gets together that isn&rsquo;t bought by the discount  of so much of his life. I found money enough for my passage in an emigrant  vessel; and here I am, ready for anything. I&rsquo;ll work like your bought nigger.  I&rsquo;ll do the work your clerk does for a quarter of his wages. I&rsquo;ll sweep out  your office, and run errands for you. You&rsquo;ll give me something to keep body and  soul together, won&rsquo;t you, George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could be more utterly abject than the tone  of this most abject wretch.</p>
<p>This man, who in prosperity had been the very  personification of hardness and insolence, was transformed into a grovelling,  cringing supplicant, ready to lie face downward in the dust beneath the feet of  that brother whose patronage, or charity, he besought.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon the younger contemplated the supplicant  with looks of undisguised gratification. He walked a few paces backward from  the spot where his brother had fallen, in a half-sitting, half-crouching  attitude, and where he remained, hugging himself in his rags, too abject to be  acutely conscious of his degradation. A year ago and he would have held himself  obstinately aloof from all old associations, and would have declared himself  ready to face starvation, rather than accept, still less supplicate, relief  from his younger brother. The events of that one year had involved alternations  and convulsions that change a year into a cycle. He had faced starvation; he  had walked with hunger for his travelling companion; he had lain down night  after night in such lairs as the tramp can find for his refuge, with sickness  and pain for his bed-fellows. The crucible through which he had passed had left  in him no more of humanity than its outward semblance, and scarcely that; for  when the moral man sinks to the level of the beasts of prey, the physical man  undergoes an assimilative process only less marked than that which transforms  the mental nature.</p>
<p>For six months this man had lived by fawning upon  or threatening his fellow-men; by violence or craft; by the degradation of the  vagrant or the audacity of the thief. There is no limit to man&rsquo;s capacity for  infamy which he had not touched. Vilest amongst the vile, he had been cast  forth from the haunts of beggars and reprobates, as no fitting company for  honourable thieves or cadgers of good repute.</p>
<p>George Sheldon seated himself astride upon a chair,  and, with his folded arms resting on the back of it, contemplated this hideous  spectacle. It was a picture that he had never thought to see, and the feeling  with which he surveyed it was not unmingled with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you rode me rough-shod, my friend, I used to  think how I should enjoy taking my change out of you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I never  thought I should have such an opportunity as this &mdash; never, by Jove! I thought  you would ride the high horse to the end of the journey; I didn&rsquo;t think your  steed would land you in the gutter. And so you&rsquo;ve tried every move, have you? &mdash;  tumbled upon every platform? &mdash; and you&rsquo;ve found all your cleverness no go upon  the other side of the three thousand miles of everlasting wet, as my Yankee  friends call the Atlantic; and you&rsquo;ve come back whining to me, and I&rsquo;m to help  you, am I, and to give you a fresh start in life, I suppose, and make you my  clerk, or my junior partner, eh? &mdash; that would be better. Messrs. Sheldon and  Sheldon wouldn&rsquo;t look bad on my door. That&rsquo;s about what you mean when you talk  of blood being thicker than water, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The abject wretch who had once been Philip Sheldon  felt that his brother was trifling with him, savouring to the last drop that  cup of triumph which the chances of fortune had offered to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play the fool with me, George,&rdquo; he said  piteously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you much &mdash; a crust of bread, a corner to sleep in, and  a cast-off suit of clothes: that&rsquo;s not much for one brother to ask of another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; replied George Sheldon; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a  great deal for you to ask of me. You&rsquo;ve had your turn, Phil; and you made the  most of it, and contrived to keep me at arm&rsquo;s length. My turn has come at last,  and you may depend upon it I shall contrive now to keep <em>you</em> at arm&rsquo;s length.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vagrant stared at him aghast. Here he had felt  secure of food and shelter; and he had endured miseries and deprivations that  reduce a man to a state in which food and shelter seem to constitute the  supreme good that can be obtained in this life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t refuse to do something for me, George,&rdquo;  he whined piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do nothing for you. Do you hear that, my  man? Nothing! You taught me that blood is not thicker than water twelve years  ago, when you married Tom Halliday&rsquo;s widow, and drew your purse-strings, after  flinging me a beggarly hundred as you&rsquo;d throw a bone to a dog. You made me  understand that was all I should ever get out of your brotherly love, or your  fear of my telling the world what I knew. You gave me a dinner now and then,  because it suited you to keep your eye upon me; and you had generally some  piece of dirty work on hand that made the advice of a sharp practitioner like  me uncommonly useful to you. I don&rsquo;t believe that you ever gave me so much as a  dinner that you didn&rsquo;t take payment for in meal or in malt. Don&rsquo;t come howling  here now, trying to persuade me that blood is thicker than water, or that  brotherhood means anything more than the accident of birth. And now I&rsquo;ve said  all I have to say; and the sooner you make yourself scarce, the better for both  of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George!&rdquo; cried the miserable suppliant, clasping  his bony hands convulsively, and whimpering as he had whimpered when he begged  his bread in the streets of New York, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t mean to turn me out of doors  on such a night. Look at me. It was as much as I could do to crawl to this  room. I have walked every step of the way from Liverpool; my wretched limbs  have been frost-bitten, and ulcered, and bruised, and racked with rheumatism,  and bent double with cramp. I came over in an emigrant vessel, with a herd of  miserable creatures who had tried their luck on the other side of the Atlantic,  and had failed, like me, and were coming home to their native workhouses. You  don&rsquo;t know what some of your emigrant ships are, perhaps. People talk about the  Black Hole of Calcutta, and the Middle Passage; but let them try the cabin of  an emigrant vessel, and they&rsquo;ll have a pretty fair idea of what human beings  have to suffer when Poverty drives the ship. I landed in Liverpool with  half-a-dollar in my pocket, and I&rsquo;ve had neither decent food nor decent shelter  since I landed. Give me some hole to lie in, George, till you can get me an  order for the nearest hospital. It&rsquo;s a toss-up whether I ever come out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d sleep under the roof that  sheltered you?&rdquo; cried George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not! Because I&rsquo;m afraid of you. Because I&rsquo;d as  soon have a cobra for my companion, or a wolf for my bedfellow. I know you.  I&rsquo;ve seen what you can do, and how you can do it. And if you could do those  things when the only pressure upon you was one that you could have cast off by  going through the <em>Gazette</em>, what would  you <em>not</em> do now when you are as  desperate as a famished wolf, and governed by no better law than that which  governs a wolf &mdash; the law of self-preservation? Am I to trust a tiger because he  tells me he is hungry? No, Phil Sheldon; neither will I trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will give me some money &mdash; enough to keep me  alive for a week or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one sixpence. I&rsquo;ll establish no precedent;  I&rsquo;ll acknowledge no tie between us. You&rsquo;d better march. I don&rsquo;t want to send  for a policeman; but if you won&rsquo;t go quietly, you must do the other thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most emphatically yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was in you to be so hard upon  me,&rdquo; faltered the wretch in that faint hoarse voice which had grown fainter and  hoarser during this interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think that I would trust you?&rdquo; cried  George. &ldquo;Trust <em>you</em>! You call me hard  because I won&rsquo;t give you a corner to lie in. And if I did, you would creep out  of your corner to poison me, or cut my throat. You would crawl into my room in  the dead of the night and put a pillow over my face, and kneel upon it till  you&rsquo;d done the trick for me; and then you&rsquo;d walk off with as much as you could  carry, and begin the same kind of work over again with some one else. I tell  you, Mr. Phil Sheldon, I will hold no intercourse with you. You&rsquo;ve escaped  hanging, but there&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s worse than hanging, to my mind, and that  is the state of a man whom nobody will trust. You&rsquo;ve come to that; and if you  had a spark of gentlemanly feeling, you&rsquo;d have bought two-pennyworth of rope  and hung yourself rather than come cringing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I don&rsquo;t cringe,&rdquo; said the outcast,  dropping the fawning tone of the mendicant for the threatening ferocity of the  social wolf; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better give me a trifle to keep body and soul together for  the next few weeks. I&rsquo;m a desperate man, George! You and I are alone up here.  You are pretty sure to have ready money about you. And there&rsquo;s your watch;  that&rsquo;s worth something. I didn&rsquo;t come here to go away empty-handed. AND I  WON&rsquo;T!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet, and in the next moment the  lawyer heard the sharp clicking noise made by the opening of a clasp-knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what you want, is it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent over his desk, with his eyes fixed on those  other evil eyes that still retained some likeness to his own, and with his left  arm raised in a boxer&rsquo;s defensive attitude, to guard his head, while his right  hand groped for something in a drawer. It was a moment&rsquo;s work. Philip had  seized that uplifted left arm, and was hanging on to it like a cat, with his  knife between his teeth, when George clapped the muzzle of a revolver to his  brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are plenty of wild beasts in London besides  you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I am not such a fool as to be without the means of settling  a chance visitor of your sort. Drop your knife, and march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The outcast dropped his knife submissively. He was  too weak for anything more than a spasmodic violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your pistol away from my head,&rdquo; he whined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, when you are outside my door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might give me a handful of silver, George. I  haven&rsquo;t a week&rsquo;s life left in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better for society if you hadn&rsquo;t an hour&rsquo;s  life in you. Be off. I&rsquo;m tired of holding this revolver to your head, and I  don&rsquo;t mean to let it go till you&rsquo;re off my premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip saw that there was no hope. Food and shelter  were all he had hoped for; but even these blessings were not for him. He backed  out of the office, closely followed by George, holding the muzzle of the  revolver within an inch or so of the fraternal brains. Upon the threshold only  did he pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me one thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t give me sixpence  to buy a loaf of bread or a glass of gin. Give me one scrap of comfort. It need  cost you nothing. Tell me something bad of Valentine Hawkehurst: that he&rsquo;s gone  to the dogs, or drowned himself; that his wife has run away from him, or his  house been burned to the ground. Tell me that he&rsquo;s had a taste of my luck; and  that Ann Woolper has died in a workhouse. It will be as good as meat and drink  to me, and it will cost you nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I told you anything of the kind, I should tell  you a lie; Valentine Hawkehurst is doing uncommonly well, and has got one of  the prettiest little boxes between Wimbledon and Kingston. Ann Woolper lives  with them, and is in better feather than she ever was in your time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, Mr. Sheldon of Gray&rsquo;s Inn pushed his  brother out on to the staircase, and shut his door. Philip sat upon the stairs,  and drew his rags together a little, and rubbed his wretched limbs, while the  bolts and chains whereby the lawyer defended his citadel clanked close behind  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether he&rsquo;ll pay Hawkehurst a visit,&rdquo;  thought George, as he bolted his door; and he had a kind of grim satisfaction  in the idea that Valentine&rsquo;s Christmas peace might be disturbed by the advent  of that grisly visitor.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter48"></a>Chapter 48<br>
  &ldquo;According To Their Deeds&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Between Wimbledon and Kingston,&rdquo; muttered the  tramp. &ldquo;If I can drag myself as far as that, I&rsquo;ll go there this night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went down stairs and out into the pitiless cold  and snow, and made his way down Fetter Lane, and across Blackfriars Bridge to  the Surrey side of the water, stopping to beg here and there.</p>
<p>Upon this snowy Christmas night there were plenty  of people abroad; and amongst them Philip Sheldon found pitying matrons, who  explored the depths of their capacious pockets to find him a halfpenny, and  good-natured young men, who flung the &ldquo;copper&rdquo; he besought with piteous  professional whine.</p>
<p>When he had collected the price of a glass of gin,  he went into the first public-house he came to, and spent his money. He was too  ill to stay the cravings of his stomach with substantial food. Gin gave him  temporary warmth and temporary strength, and enabled him to push on vigorously  for a little while; and then came dreary periods of faintness and exhaustion,  in which every step was sheer pain and weariness.</p>
<p>Something of his old self, some remnant of that  hard strength of purpose which had once characterized him, remained with him  still, utterly fallen and brutalized as he was. As a savage creature of the  jungle might pursue a given course, pushing always onward to that camp or  village whence the scent of human flesh and blood was wafted to his quivering  nostrils, so Philip Sheldon pushed on towards the dwelling-place of that man  and that woman whom of all creatures upon this earth he most savagely hated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing left for me but to turn  housebreaker,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;and the first house I&rsquo;ll try my hand upon  shall be Valentine Hawkehurst&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea of violence in such a creature was the  idea of a madman. Weapon he had none, nor the physical strength that would have  enabled him to grapple with a boy of twelve years old. Half intoxicated with  the spirits he had consumed on his long tramp, half delirious with fever, he  had a vague notion that he could make an entrance into some ill-defended house  under cover of night, and steal something that should procure him food and  shelter. And let the house be Valentine Hawkehurst&rsquo;s, the man who had baffled  his plans and crushed him!</p>
<p>If blood must be shed, let the blood be his! Never  was man better primed for murder than the man who tramped across Wimbledon  Common at eleven o&rsquo;clock this night, with the snow drifting against his face,  and his limbs shaken every now and then by an ague-fit.</p>
<p>Happily for the interests of society, his hand  lacked the power to execute that iniquity which his heart willed.</p>
<p>He reached a little wayside inn near the Robin Hood  gate of Richmond Park, just as the shutters were being closed, and asked a man  if any one of the name of Hawkehurst lived in that neighbourhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do <em>you</em> want with Mr. Hawkehurst?&rdquo; asked the man, contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a letter for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you? A begging letter, I should think, from  the look of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s a business letter. You&rsquo;d better show me  where he lives, if he&rsquo;s a customer of yours. The business is particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it? You&rsquo;re a queer kind of messenger to trust  with particular business. Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s house is the third you come to on  the opposite side of the way. But I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;ll find anybody up as  late as this. Their lights are out by eleven, in a general way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third house on the opposite side of the road  was half a mile distant from the little run. Lights shone bright in the lower  windows as the tramp dragged his tired limbs to the stout oaken gate. The gate  was fastened only by a latch, and offered no resistance to the intruder. He  crept with stealthy footsteps along the smooth gravel walk, sheltered by dark  laurels, on which the light flashed cheerily from those bright windows. Sounds  of laughter and of music pealed out upon the wintry air. Shadows flitted across  the blinds of the broad bay windows. Philip Sheldon crept into a sheltered nook  beside the rustic porch, and sank down exhausted in the shadow of the laurels.</p>
<p>He sat there in a kind of stupor. He had lost the  power of thought, somehow, on that dreary journey. It seemed almost as if he  had left some portion of his being out yonder in the cold and darkness. He had  difficulty in remembering why he had come to this place, and what that deed was  which he meant to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hawkehurst,&rdquo; he muttered to himself&mdash;&rdquo; Hawkehurst,  the man who leagued against me with Jedd! I swore to be even with him if ever I  found the opportunity &mdash; if ever! And George refused me a few shillings; my  brother, my only brother, refused to stand my friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hawkehurst and George &mdash; his only brother &mdash; the  images of these two men floated confusedly in his brain: he could scarcely  separate them. Sometimes it seemed to him that he was still sitting outside his  brother&rsquo;s door, on the staircase in Gray&rsquo;s Inn, hugging himself in his rags,  and cursing his unnatural kinsman&rsquo;s cruelty; then in the next moment he  remembered where he was, and breathed bitter curses upon that unconscious enemy  whose laugh pealed out every now and then amid a chorus of light-hearted  laughter.</p>
<p>There was a little Christmas party at  Charlottenburgh. Two flys were waiting in the laurel-avenue to convey Mr.  Hawkehurst&rsquo;s guests to distant abodes. The door was opened presently, and all  the bustle of departure made itself heard by that wretched wayfarer who found  it so difficult to keep his hold upon the consciousness of these things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said to himself&mdash; &ldquo;a party!  Hawkehurst has been giving a party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had lived through too much degradation, he had  descended into too deep a gulf of wretchedness, to be conscious of the contrast  between his present situation and his position in those days when he had played  the host, and seen handsome carriages bear prosperous guests away from his  door. In that cycle of misery which he had endured, these things and the memory  of them had faded from him as completely as if they had been obliterated by the  passage of a century. The hapless wretch tried to give sustained attention to  all the animated discussion that attended the departure of the merry guests.  Half-a-dozen people seemed to be talking at once. Valentine was giving his  friends counsel about the way home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will keep to the lower road, you know, Fred.  Lawsley&rsquo;s cab can follow yours. You came a couple of miles out of your way. And  tell that fellow Battersea Bridge is a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then followed Charlotte&rsquo;s friendly questioning  about wraps, and hoods, and comforters, and other feminine gear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when are you coming to dine at Fulham?&rdquo; cried  one voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall certainly get those quadrilles of  Offenbach&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How delightfully Mr. Lawsley sang that song of  Santley&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And anon a chorus of &ldquo;Never enjoyed myself more!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Most delightful evening!&rdquo; &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t come out in the cold.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thanks; well,  yes, yours are always capital.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t light up till I&rsquo;m on the road.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Give my book a lift in the <em>D.H.</em>, eh,  old fellow?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you <em>quite</em> sure that  shawl is warm enough?&rdquo; &ldquo;Take a rug for your feet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thanks, no.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;  &ldquo;See you on Tuesday.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the box for D.L.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right, old fellow!&rdquo;  &ldquo;Lower Road, Roehampton Lane, Putney Bridge. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the confusion of voices Philip Sheldon had  recognized more than one voice that was familiar to him. There were Charlotte&rsquo;s  gentle tones, and Valentine&rsquo;s hearty barytone, and another that he knew.</p>
<p>Diana Paget! Yes, it was her voice. Diana Paget,  whom he had cause to hate for her interference with his affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A beggar,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, &ldquo;and the  daughter of a beggar! She was a nice young lady to set herself in opposition to  the man who gave her a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vehicles drove away, but there was still a  little group in the rustic porch. Valentine and Charlotte, with Monsieur and  Madame Lenoble, who had come to spend their Christmas with their English  friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How we have been gay this evening!&rdquo; cried Gustave.  &ldquo;There is nothing like your English interior for that which you call the  comfortable, the jolly, you others. Thy friends are the jollity itself,  Hawkehurst. And our acting charades, when that we all talked at once, and with  a such emphasis on the word we would make to know. Was it not that our  spectators were cunning to divine the words? And your friend Lawsley &mdash; it is a  mixture of Got and Sanson. It is a true genius. Think, then, Diane, while we  were amusing ourselves, our girls were at the midnight mass at the Sacr&eacute; Coeur?  Dear pious children, their innocent prayers ascended towards the heavens for we  who are absent. Come, Madame Hawkehurst, Diane, it makes cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are sheltered here. And the stars are so  bright after the snow,&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;Do you remember the Christmas-day you  spent at the Lawn, Valentine, when we walked in Kensington Gardens together,  just when we were first engaged?&rdquo; the young wife added shyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I not remember? It was the first time the  holiness of Christmas came home to my heart. And now let us go back to the  drawing-room, and sit round the fire, and tell ghost stories. Lenoble shall  give us the legends of C&ocirc;tenoir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine,&rdquo; murmured Charlotte, &ldquo;do you know that  it is nearly one o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we must put in an appearance at church  to-morrow morning. And Lenoble has to walk to Kingston to early mass. We will  postpone our ghost stories to New-Year&rsquo;s eve. And Lenoble shall read Tennyson&rsquo;s <em>New Year</em>, to demonstrate his  improvement in the English language. Lead the way, Mrs. Hawkehurst; your  obedient slave obeys. Mamma is waiting for us in the drawing-room, marvelling  at our delay, no doubt. And Nancy Woolper stalks ghost-like through the house,  oppressed by the awful responsibility of to-morrow&rsquo;s pudding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anon came a clanking of bolts and bars; and Philip  Sheldon, for the second time that night, heard a door shut against him. As the  voices died away, his consciousness of external things died with him. He  fancied himself on the Gray&rsquo;s-Inn staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so hard upon me, George,&rdquo; he muttered  faintly. &ldquo;If my own kith and kin turn against me, whom shall I look to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Woolper opened the door early next day, when  night was yet at odds with morning. All through the night the silent  snow-flakes had been falling thick and fast; and they had woven the shroud of  Philip Sheldon. The woman who had watched his infant slumbers forty years  before, was the first to look upon him in that deeper sleep, of whose waking we  know so little. It was not until she had looked long and closely at the dead  face that she knew why it was that the aspect of that countenance had affected  her with so strange a pang. She did recognize that altered wretch, and kept her  counsel.</p>
<p>Before the bells rang for morning service the tramp  was lying in the dead-house of Kingston Union, whither he had been conveyed  very quietly in the early morning, unknown to any one but the constable who  superintended the removal, and the servants of Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s household. Only  the next day did Ann Woolper tell Valentine what had happened. There was to be  an inquest. It would be well that some one should identify the dead man, and  establish the fact of Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s decease.</p>
<p>Valentine was able to do this unaided. He attended  the inquest, and made arrangements for the outcast&rsquo;s decent burial; and in due  course he gave Mrs. Sheldon notice of her freedom. Beyond that nameless grave  whose fancy shall dare follow Philip Sheldon? He died and made no sign. And in  the last dread day, when the dead, small and great, from the sea and from the  grave, press together at the foot of the great white Throne, and the books of  doom are opened; when above shines the city whose light is the glory of God,  and below yawns the lake of fire, &mdash; what voice shall plead for Philip Sheldon,  what entreating cry shall Pity send forth that sentence against him may be  stayed?</p>
<p>Surely none; unless it issue from the lips of that  one confiding friend, whose last words upon earth thanked and blessed him, and  whose long agonies he watched with unshaken purpose, conscious that in every  convulsive change in the familiar face, and every pang that shook the stalwart  form, he saw the result of his own work.</p>
<p>Perhaps at that dread Judgment Day, when every  other tongue is silent, the voice of Tom Halliday may be heard pleading for the  man who murdered him. </p>
