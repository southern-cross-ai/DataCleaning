  &ldquo;The Rain Set Early In To-Night&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It had been raining all the morning, and it was  raining still, in that feeble and desultory manner which presages a change of  some kind, when the postman came with the long-expected Indian letter.</p>
<p>He was later than usual. It was nearly two o&rsquo;clock,  and Isola had been watching for him since one, watching with an unread book in  her lap, listening for the click of the gate. She had been sitting by the open  window, looking out at the wet landscape, the glistening hedgerow and dull grey  river, with the great, green hill beyond, a steep slope of meadow land, dotted  with red cattle, and so divided by hedgerows, as to look like a Titanic  chessboard.</p>
<p>At last she heard the familiar tread of the  postman&rsquo;s heavy boots, and saw his shining oilskin hat moving above the edge of  the hollies, and heard the click of the iron latch as he came into the little  garden.</p>
<p>She called to him from the window, and he came  tramping across the sodden grass and put three letters into her outstretched  hand.</p>
<p>One from her married sister in Hans Place. That  would keep. One from an old schoolfellow. That would keep. And one &mdash; the  long-looked-for Indian letter, which she tore open eagerly, and read hurriedly,  devouring the close lines, in the neat, black penmanship, with its decided up  and down strokes, and legible characters, so firm, so strong, so  straightforward, like the nature of the man who wrote the letter.</p>
<p>The tears sprang to her eyes as she came to the  end, and her hands crushed the thin paper in a paroxysm of vexation or despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six months &mdash; perhaps a year, before he can come  back, and I am to go on living here &mdash; alone, unless I like to send for a girl  whose face I hardly know, to keep me company, and cheer me with her good  spirits. I want no strange girls. I want no one&rsquo;s good spirits. I hate people  with good spirits. I want him, and nobody but him! It is hard that we should be  parted like this. I ought to have gone with him, in spite of all the doctors in  Christendom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She relented towards the letter which her feverish  hand had used so badly. She smoothed out the flimsy paper carefully with that  pretty little hand, and then she re-read the husband&rsquo;s letter, so full of grave  tenderness and fond, consoling words.</p>
<p>He was with his regiment in Burmah, and the present  aspect of things gave him no hope of being able to return to England for the  next half-year, and there was no certainty that the half-year might not be  stretched into a whole year. The separation could not be more irksome to his  dearest Isola than it was to him, her husband of little more than a year: but  not for worlds would he have exposed her to the risks of that climate. He took  comfort in thinking of her in the snug little Cornish nest, with his good  Tabitha.</p>
<p>Isola kissed the letter before she put it in her  pocket, and then she looked round the room rather dolefully, as if the Cornish  nest were not altogether paradise. And yet it was a pretty little room enough,  half dining-room, half study, with handsomely bound books on carved oak  shelves, and photographs and bright draperies, and cosily cushioned bamboo  chairs, and a bird-cage, and a Persian cat. Nor was the garden outside  flowerless, even on the threshold of winter. The purple blossoms of the  veronica were untouched by frost; there were pale tea roses gleaming yonder  against the dark gloss of holly and laurel. There were single dahlias of  vividest red, like flaming stars; and close under the open window, last  splendour of departed summer, the waxen chalice of a golden lily trembled on  its tall stem, and filled the room with perfume.</p>
<p>The rain was over &mdash; the monotonous drip, drip,  which had irritated Isola&rsquo;s nerves all that morning, had ceased at last. She  left the modest little lunch untouched upon the table, and went out into the  hall, where her hat and jacket hung handy for any impromptu ramble. No need to  look at one&rsquo;s self in the glass before going out of doors, at twenty years of  age, and in such a place as Trelasco. Isola took her stick from the stand, a  green orange stick, bought in the sunny South, on her way to Venice with her  husband last year &mdash; a leisurely trip, which had been to them as a second  honeymoon after a few happy months of wedlock. Then had come the sadness of  parting, and a swift and lonely journey for the young wife &mdash; a lonely return to  the Angler&rsquo;s Nest, Trelasco, that cosy cottage between Lostwithiel and Fowey,  which Major Disney had bought and furnished before his marriage. He was a son  of the soil, and he had chosen to pitch his tent in that remote spot for the  sake of old associations, and from a fixed belief that there was no locality of  equal merit for health, beauty, and all other virtues which a man should seek  in his home.</p>
<p>Isola rarely touched that stick without remembering  the day it was bought &mdash; a rainy day in Milan &mdash; just such a day as this, a low,  grey sky, and an oppressive mildness of atmosphere. She remembered, with the  sick pain that goes with long partings, how she and her husband had dawdled  away an afternoon in the Victor Emmanuel Gallery, buying handkerchiefs and  neckties, a book or two, a collection of photographs, and finally the orange  stick.</p>
<p>She went out to walk down her depression before  teatime, if possible. She went along a narrow path by the river, then turned  into a road that skirted those green pastures which rose sheer till the ragged  edge of the topmost boundary seemed to touch the dim, grey sky. She passed the  village inn, deadly quiet at this season and at this hour. She passed the  half-dozen decent cottages, and the three or four genteeler houses, each in its  neatly kept garden, and she walked with quick, light step along the wet road,  her useful tailor-gown well clear of the mud, her stick striking the hedgerow  now and then, as she swung it to and fro in dreamy thought.</p>
<p>A long, lonely winter to look forward to &mdash; a winter  like the last &mdash; with her books and drawing-board, and her cottage piano, and  the cat and the fox-terrier, and Tabitha for her daily companions. There were a  few neighbours within a radius of half a dozen miles, who had been very civil  to her; who called upon her, say once in six weeks; who sometimes invited her  to a stately dinner-party, and sometimes at a suspiciously short notice, which  made her feel she was wanted to fill a gap; who made her free of their tennis  lawns; and who talked to her on Sundays after church, and were always very  particular in inquiring for news from India. There was not one among them for  whom she cared; not one to whom she would have liked to pour out her thoughts  about Keats or Shelley, or to whom she would have confided her opinion of  Byron. She was more interested in Bulwer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Audley Egerton&rdquo; than in any of  those flesh and blood neighbours. She was happier sitting by her chimney corner  with a novel than in the best society available within a drive of Trelasco.</p>
<p>She struck off the high road into a lane, a lane  that led to the base of a wilder hill than that where the red cattle were  grazing. The crest of the hill was common land, and dark fir-trees made a  ragged line against the autumn sky, and the view from the summit was wide and  varied, with a glimpse of the great brown cliffs and the dark, grey sea far off  to the west, to that dim distance where the Dodman shut off the watery way to  the new world. On the landward slope of that wild-looking ridge was the Mount,  Lord Lostwithiel&rsquo;s place, uninhabited for the greater part of the year except  by servants, his lordship being the very last kind of man to bury himself alive  in a remote Cornish fastness, a long day&rsquo;s journey from the London theatres,  and the R.Y.S. Clubhouse at Cowes.</p>
<p>Who was Lord Lostwithiel? Well, in the estimation  of Trelasco he was the only nobleman in England, or say that he was to all  other peers as the sun to the planets. He belonged to Trelasco by reason of his  large landed estate and the accident of his birth, which had taken place at the  Mount; and, although his character and way of life were not altogether  satisfactory to the village mind, Trelasco made the best of him.</p>
<p>Isola Disney climbed the hill, an easy matter to  light-footed twenty. She stood amidst the tall fir columns, and looked down at  the November landscape, very distinctly defined in the soft, grey atmosphere.  She could see the plough moving slowly across the red earth in the fields  below, the clumsy farm horses, white against the deep, rich red. She could see  the winding river, bluish grey, between its willowy banks, and far off beyond  Fowey there rose the wooded hills, where the foliage showed orange and tawny  and russet between the blue-grey water and the pale grey sky.</p>
<p>She loved this lonely hill, and felt her spirits  rise in this lighter atmosphere as she stood resting against the scaly trunk of  a Scotch fir, with the wind blowing her hair. It was a relief to escape from  the silence of those empty rooms, where she had only the sleepy Persian or the  hyper-intelligent fox-terrier for company. There was a longer and more  picturesque way home than that by which she had come. She could descend the  other side of the hill, skirt the gardens of the Mount, by a path that led  through the Park to a lodge gate on the Fowey road. It was one of her favourite  walks, and she was so accustomed to seeing the shutters closed at the great  house that she never expected to meet any one more alarming than a farm-servant  or a cottager&rsquo;s child.</p>
<p>There was a thick chestnut copse upon one side, and  the wide expanse of undulating turf, with an occasional clump of choice timber,  upon the other. The house stood on higher ground than the park, but was hemmed  in and hidden by shrubberies that had overgrown the intention of the landscape  gardener who planned them. Only the old grey-stone gables, with their heavy  slabs of slate, and the tall, clustered chimneys, showed above the copper  beeches, and deodaras, the laurels, and junipers, and Irish yews, and the  shining masses of arbutus with crimson berries gleaming amongst the green.  Isola had never seen that old Manor House nearer than she saw it to-day, from  the path, which was a public right of way through the park. She knew that the greater  part of the building dated from the reign of Charles the Second, but that there  were older bits; and that about the whole, and about those ancient rooms and  passages most especially, there were legends and traditions and historical  associations, not without the suspicion of ghosts. The Mount was not a show  place, like the home of the Treffrys at Fowey, and of late years it had been  very seldom inhabited, except by certain human fossils who had served the house  of Hulbert for two generations. She had often looked longingly at those quaint  old gables, those clustered stone chimneys, likening the house amidst its  overgrown shrubberies to the Palace of the Sleeping Beauty, and had wished that  she were on friendly terms with one of those drowsy old retainers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say if I were daring enough to open one of  the doors and go in I should find them all asleep,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;and I might  roam all over the house without awakening anybody.&rdquo; She was too depressed  to-day to give more than a careless, unseeing glance at those many gables as  she walked along the muddy path beside the dripping copse. The chestnut boughs  were nearly bare, but here and there clusters of bright yellow leaves were  still hanging, shining like pale gold in the last watery gleams of the sun; and  though the leaves were lying sodden and brown among the rank, wet grass, there  were emerald mosses and cool, green ferns, and red and orange fungi to give  colour to the foreground, and to the little vistas that opened here and there  amidst the underwood.</p>
<p>Those final yellow gleams were fading low down in  the western sky as Isola turned her face towards the river and the Angler&rsquo;s  Nest, and just above that pale radiance there stretched a dense black cloud,  like a monstrous iron bar, which she felt must mean mischief. She looked at  that black line apprehensively. She was three miles from home, without cloak or  umbrella, and with no available shelter within three-quarters of a mile.</p>
<p>She quickened her pace, watching the fading light  and lowering cloud, expecting thunder, lightning, hail, she knew not what. A  sudden deluge settled the question. Torrential rain! That was the meaning of  the inky bar above the setting sun. She looked round her helplessly. Should she  dart into the copse, and try to shelter herself amidst those leafless twigs,  those slender withies and saplings? Better to face the storm and plod valiantly  on. Her neat little cloth gown would not be much the worse for a ducking; her  neat little feet were accustomed to rapid walking. Should she run? No; useless  when there were three miles to be got over. A brisk, steady tramp would be  better. But, brave as she was, that fierce rain was far from pleasant. It cut  into her eyes and blinded her. She had to grope her way along the path with her  stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray let me take you to the house,&rdquo; said a voice  close beside her, a man&rsquo;s voice &mdash; low and deep, and with the accents of  refinement.</p>
<p>Could one of Lord Lostwithiel&rsquo;s fossilized servants  talk like that? Impossible. She looked up, as well as she could, under that blinding  downpour, and saw a tall man standing beside the pathway with his back to the  copse. He was over six feet two and of slim, active figure. He was pale, and  wore a short, dark beard, and the eyes which looked at Isola out of the pale,  thin face were very dark. That was about as much as she could see of the  stranger in the November dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray let me persuade you to come to the house,&rdquo; he  said urgently. &ldquo;You are being drenched. It is absolutely dreadful to see  anybody out in such rain &mdash; and there is no other shelter within reach. Let me  take you there. My housekeeper will dry your hat and jacket for you. I ought to  introduce myself, perhaps. I am Lord Lostwithiel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had guessed as much. Who else would speak with  authority in that place? She dimly recalled a photograph, pale and faded, of a  tall man in a yeomanry uniform, seen in somebody&rsquo;s album; and the face of the  photograph had been the same elongated oval face &mdash; with long thin nose, and  dark eyes a shade too near together &mdash; which was looking down at her now.</p>
<p>She felt it would be churlish to refuse shelter so  earnestly offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I am sorry to  be so troublesome. I ought not to have come so far in such doubtful weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went with him meekly, walking her fastest under  the pelting rain, which was at her back now as they made for the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you really come far?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Trelasco. I live at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest, a  cottage by the river. You know it, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I know every house at Trelasco. Then you are  staying with Mrs. Disney, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mrs. Disney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; &mdash; with intense surprise. &ldquo;I beg your pardon.  You are so young. I imagined Mrs. Disney an older person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at the girlish figure, the pale delicate  face, and told himself that his new acquaintance could scarcely be more than  nineteen or twenty. He had met Major Disney, a man who looked about forty &mdash; a  lucky fellow to have caught such a pretty bird as this.</p>
<p>They had reached the shrubbery by this time, and  were hurrying along a winding walk where the rain reached them with less  violence. The narrow walk brought them on to a broad terrace in front of the  house. Lostwithiel opened a half-glass door, and led Mrs. Disney into the  library, a long, low room, full of curious nooks and corners, formed by two  massive chimney-pieces, and by the projecting wings of the heavy oak bookcases.  Isola had never seen any room so filled with books, nor had she ever seen a  room with two such chimney-pieces, of statuary marble, yellowed with age,  elaborately carved with cherubic heads, and Cupids, and torches and festal  wreaths, bows and arrows, lyres and urns.</p>
<p>A wood fire was burning upon one hearth, and it was  hither Lostwithiel brought his guest, wheeling a large armchair in front of the  blaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will take off your hat and jacket, and sit  down there, I&rsquo;ll get my housekeeper to attend to you,&rdquo; he said, with his hand  upon the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are more than kind. I must hurry home directly  the rain abates a little. I have a careful old servant who is sure to be  anxious about me,&rdquo; said Isola, devouring the room with her eyes, wanting to  take in every detail of this enchanted castle.</p>
<p>She might never enter it again, perhaps. Lord  Lostwithiel was so seldom there. His absenteeism was the lament of the  neighbourhood. The things he ought to have done and did not do would have  filled a book. He had been wild in his youth. He had once owned a theatre. He  had done, or was supposed to have done, things which were spoken of with bated  breath; but of late years he had developed new ambitions, and had done with  theatrical speculations. He had become literary, scientific, political. He was  one of the lights of the intellectual world, or of that small section of the  intellectual world which is affiliated to the smart world. He knew all the  clever people in London, and a good many of the intellectualities of Paris,  Berlin, and Vienna. He had never married; but it was supposed that he would  eventually marry, before he was forty, for instance, and that he would make a  great match. He was not rich, but he was Lord Lostwithiel. He was by no means  handsome, but he was said to be one of the most fascinating men in London.</p>
<p>Isola pulled off her jacket slowly, looking about  her all the time; and Lostwithiel forbore from offering her any assistance,  lest he should intensify her evident shyness.</p>
<p>A man in plain clothes, who looked more like a  valet than a butler, answered the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send Mrs. Mayne, and bring tea,&rdquo; ordered his  lordship.</p>
<p>What a slender, girlish form it was which the  removal of the tweed jacket revealed! The slim waist and somewhat narrow  shoulders betokened a delicacy of constitution. The throat was beautiful, milk  white, the throat of Diana, and the head, now the hat was off, would also have  done for Diana; a small classic head, with soft, brown hair drawn smoothly away  from the low, white brow and rolled into a knot at the back. The features were  as delicate as the complexion, in which there was no brilliancy of colouring,  only a paleness as of ivory. The eyes were dark grey, with long, brown lashes,  and their present expression was between anxiety and wondering interest.  Lostwithiel was not such a coxcomb as to appropriate that look of interest. He  saw that it was his house and not himself which inspired the feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like old houses, I can see, Mrs. Disney,&rdquo; he  said, smiling at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intensely. They are histories in brick and stone,  are they not? I dare say there are stories about this room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innumerable stories. I should have to ransack the  Record Office for some of them, and to draw upon a very bad memory to a  perilous extent for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it haunted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not one of those privileged persons who see  ghosts; neither seventh son of a seventh son, nor of the mediumistic  temperament; but I have heard of an apparition pervading the house on  occasions, and being seen in this room, which once formed part of a certain  small monastery, put down by Henry VIII., and recorded in the Black Book. As  one of the oldest rooms it is naturally uncanny; but as I have never suffered  any inconvenience in that line, I make it my den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the most picturesque room I ever saw. And  what a multitude of books!&rdquo; exclaimed Isola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I have a good many books. I am always buying;  but I find I never have exactly the book I want. And as I have no librarian I  am too apt to forget the books I have. If I could afford to spend more of my  life at the Mount, I would engage some learned gentleman, whose life had been a  failure, to take care of my books. Are you Cornish, like your husband, Mrs.  Disney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I was born at Dinan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! in that medi&aelig;val Breton city? You are not  French, though, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother and father were both English, but my  sister and I were born and brought up in Brittany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lostwithiel questioned no further. He had a shrewd  idea that when English people live for a good many years in a Breton town they  have reasons of their own, generally financial, for their choice of a  settlement. He was a man who could not have spent six months of his life away  from London or Paris.</p>
<p>The housekeeper made her appearance and offered her  services. She wrung the rain out of Isola&rsquo;s cloth skirt, and wiped the muddy  hem. She took charge of the jacket and hat, and at Lostwithiel&rsquo;s suggestion she  remained to pour out the tea. She was a dignified person, in a black silk gown  and a lace cap, and she treated her master as if he had been a demi-god. Isola  could not be afraid of taking tea in this matronly presence, yet she kept  looking nervously towards the window in front of her, where the rain beat with  undiminished force, and where the night was closing in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you are anxious to be on your way home, Mrs.  Disney,&rdquo; said Lostwithiel, who had nothing to do but watch her face, such an  expressive face at all times, so picturesquely beautiful when touched by the  flickering light of the wood fire. &ldquo;If you were to wait for fine weather you  might be here all night, and your good people at home would be frantic. I&rsquo;ll  order a carriage, and you can be at home in three-quarters of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Lord Lostwithiel, I couldn&rsquo;t give you so  much trouble. If your housekeeper will be so kind as to lend me a cloak and  umbrella, I can get home very well. And I had better start at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the rain, alone, and in the darkness? It will  be dark before you are home, in any case. No, Mrs. Disney, if I were to permit  such a thing I should expect Major Disney to call me out directly he came home.  He is in India, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is with his regiment in Burmah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect him home soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very soon; not for six months, or perhaps  longer. It was that which made me walk so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lostwithiel looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that I was so disappointed by his letter &mdash;  a letter I received to-day &mdash; that I went out for a long ramble to walk down my  bad spirits, and hardly knew how far I was going. It has made me inflict  trouble on you, and Mrs. &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayne. Both Mrs. Mayne and I are delighted to be  of use to you. Order the station brougham, Dalton, immediately,&rdquo; to the man who  answered his bell. &ldquo;The carriage can hardly be ready in less than twenty  minutes, so pray try to do justice to Mrs. Mayne&rsquo;s tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is delicious tea,&rdquo; said Isola, enjoying the  fire-glow, and the dancing lights upon the richly bound books in all their  varieties of colouring, from black and crimson and orange-tawny to vellum  diapered with gold.</p>
<p>She was evidently relieved in her mind by the  knowledge that she was to be driven home presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are really interested in this old house you  must come some sunny morning and let Mrs. Mayne show you over it,&rdquo; said  Lostwithiel, establishing himself with his cup and saucer upon the other side  of the hearth. &ldquo;She knows all the old stories, and she has a better memory than  I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like so much to do so next summer, when  my husband can come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Major Disney won&rsquo;t care much about the  old place. He is a native of these parts, and must have been here often in my  father&rsquo;s time. I shall hope to receive you both, if I am here next October for  the shooting &mdash; but there is no need to postpone your inspection of the house to  the remote future. Come on the first fine morning that you have nothing better  to do. Mrs. Mayne is always at home; and I am almost always out of doors in the  morning. You can have the house to yourselves, and talk about ghosts to your  hearts&rsquo; content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my lord, I hope I know better than to say  anything disrespectful of the house,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Mayne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mayne, a family ghost is as respectable an  institution as a family tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola murmured some vague acknowledgment of his  civility. She was far too shy to have any idea of taking advantage of his  offer. To re-enter that house alone of her own accord would be impossible.  By-and-by, with her husband at her side, she would be bold enough to do  anything, to accept any hospitality that Lostwithiel might be moved to offer.  He would invite Martin, perhaps, for the shooting, or to a luncheon, or a  dinner. She wondered vaguely if she would ever possess a gown good enough to  wear at a dinner-party in such a house.</p>
<p>After this there came a brief silence. Mrs. Mayne  stood straight and prim behind the tea-table. Nothing would have induced her to  sit in his lordship&rsquo;s presence, albeit she had dandled him in her arms when  there was much less of him than of the cambric and fine flannel which composed  his raiment, and albeit his easy familiarity might have invited some  forgetfulness of class distinctions. Mrs. Mayne fully understood that she was  wanted there to set the stranger at her ease, and she performed her mission;  but even her presence could not lessen Isola&rsquo;s shyness. She felt like a bird  caught in a net, or fluttering in the grasp of some strong but kindly hand. She  sat listening for carriage wheels, and only hearing the dull thumping of her  own scared heart.</p>
<p>And yet he was so kind, and yet he so fully  realized her idea of high-bred gentleness, that she need hardly have been so  troubled by the situation. She stole a glance at him as he stood by the  chimney-piece, in a thoughtful attitude, looking down at the burning logs on  the massive old andirons. The firelight shining on a face above it will often  give a sinister look to the openest countenance; and to-night Lostwithiel&rsquo;s  long, narrow face, dark, deep-set eyes, and pointed beard had some touch of the  diabolical in that red and uncertain glow; an effect that was but  instantaneous, for as the light changed the look passed, and she saw him as he  really was, with his pale and somewhat sunken cheeks, and eyes darkly grave, of  exceeding gentleness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you lived long at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest, Mrs.  Disney?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly a year and a half; ever since my marriage,  with just one interval on the Continent before Martin went to India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I need not ask if you are heartily sick of  the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I should not be tired of the cottage or  the neighbourhood if my husband were at home. I am only tired of solitude. He  wants me to send for his sister &mdash; a girl who has not long left school &mdash; to keep  me company; but I detest school-girls, and I would much rather be alone than  put up with a silly companion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wise beyond your years, Mrs. Disney. Avoid  the sister, by all means. She would bore you to death &mdash; a scampering, exuberant  girl, who would develop hysteria after one month of Cornish dulness. Besides, I  am sure you have resources of your own, and that you would rather endure  solitude than uncongenial company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola sighed, and shook her head rather dolefully,  tracing the pattern of the Persian rug with the point of her stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very fond of books, and of music,&rdquo; she said;  &ldquo;but one gets tired of being alone after a time. It seems such ages since  Martin and I said good-bye in Venice. I was dreadfully unhappy at first. I  stand almost alone in the world, when I am parted from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father and mother are dead?&rdquo; in gentlest  inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; they are not dead; they are at Dinan,&rdquo; she  said, almost as if it were the same thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is very far from Trelasco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They never leave Dinan. The kind of life suits  them. Mamma knits; papa has his club and his English newspapers. People enjoy  the English papers so much more when they live abroad than when they are at  home. Mamma is a very bad sailor. It would be a risk for her to cross. If my  sister or I were dangerously ill, mamma would come. But it would be at the  hazard of her life. Papa has often told me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your father, is he a bad sailor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is rather worse than mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I conclude you were married at Dinan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I never left Brittany until my  wedding-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pretty idea! It is as if Major Disney had  found a new kind of wild flower in some cranny of the old grey wall that guards  the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Dinan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are very few places within easy reach of a  yachtsman that I don&rsquo;t know. I have anchored in almost every bay between  Cherbourg and Brest, and have rambled inland whenever there was anything worth  seeing within a day&rsquo;s journey from the coast. Yes, I know Dinan well. Strange  to think that I may have passed you in the street there. Do you sketch, by the  way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then, perhaps you are one of the young ladies  I have seen sitting at street corners, or under archways, doing fearful and  wonderful things with a box of moist colours and a drawing-board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young ladies who sit about the streets are  tourists,&rdquo; said Isola, with a look of disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. The resident ladies would no more do  such things than they would sit upon the pavement and make pictures of salmon  or men-of-war in coloured chalks, like our Metropolitan artists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I hear a carriage,&rdquo; said Isola, putting  down her cup and saucer, and looking at her jacket, which Mrs. Mayne was  holding before the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the carriage,&rdquo; answered Lostwithiel,  opening the glass door. &ldquo;What a night! The rain is just as bad as it was when I  brought you indoors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will accept the use of a shawl, ma&rsquo;am, it  would be safer than putting on this damp jacket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mayne, get your shawl. Mrs. Disney will wear  it, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper bustled out, and Lostwithiel and  his guest were alone, looking at each other somewhat helplessly, as they stood  far apart, she in the glow of the hearth, he in the darkness near the door, and  feeling that every available subject of conversation had been exhausted. Their  embarrassment was increased when Dalton and a footman came in with two great  lamps and flooded the room with light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know how to thank you for having taken so  much trouble about me,&rdquo; Isola faltered presently, under that necessity to say  something which is one of the marks of shyness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been no trouble. I only hope I got you  out of that pelting rain in time to save you from any evil consequences.  Strange that our acquaintance should begin in such an accidental manner. I  shall be glad to know more of Major Disney when he comes home, and in the  meantime I hope I shall have the pleasure of meeting you sometimes. No doubt  you know everybody in the neighbourhood, so we can hardly help running against  each other somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola smiled faintly, thinking that the chances of  any such meeting were of the slightest; but she did not gainsay him. He wanted  to say something courteous no doubt, and had gone into no nice question of  probabilities before he spoke. She had heard him described by a good many  people, who had hinted darkly at his shortcomings, but had all agreed as to his  politeness and persuasive powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man who would talk over Satan himself,&rdquo; said the  village lawyer.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mayne reappeared with a comfortable Scotch  plaid, which she wrapped carefully about Mrs. Disney, in a pleasant, motherly  fashion. The rain had all been shaken off the little felt hat, which had no  feathers or frippery to spoil. People who live in the west of England make  their account with wet weather.</p>
<p>Lord Lostwithiel handed his guest into the  carriage, and stood bareheaded in the rain to wish her good-bye before he shut  the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very anxious to know that you have  escaped cold,&rdquo; he said, at the last moment. &ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t think me a  nuisance if I call to-morrow to inquire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shut the door quickly, and the brougham drove  off before she could answer. She was alone in the darkness in the snug, warm  little carriage. There was a clock ticking beside her, a sound that startled  her in the stillness. There was a basket hanging in front of her, and an odour  of cigars and Russia leather. There was a black bear rug, lined with white  fleeciness, which almost filled the carriage. She had never sat in such a  carriage. How different from the mouldy old brougham in which she occasionally  went to dinner-parties &mdash; a capacious vehicle with a bow window, like a seaside  parlour!</p>
<p>She leant back in a corner of the little carriage,  wrapped in the soft, warm rug, wondering at her strange adventure. She had  penetrated that mysterious house on Black-fir Hill, and she had made the  acquaintance of Lord Lostwithiel. How much she would have to tell Martin in her  next letter! She wrote to him every week &mdash; a long, loving letter, closely  written on thin paper, pouring out all her fancies and feelings to the husband  she loved with all her heart.</p>
<p>She sighed as her thoughts recurred to the letter  received to-day. Six months, or perhaps even a year, before he was to come back  to her! Yet the letter had not been without hopefulness. He had the prospect of  getting his next step before that year was over, and then his coming home would  be a final return. He would be able to retire, and he would buy some land &mdash; a  hundred acres or so &mdash; and breed horses &mdash; one of his youthful dreams &mdash; and do a  little building, perhaps, to enlarge and beautify the Angler&rsquo;s Nest, and his  Isola should have a pair of ponies and a good saddle-horse. He looked forward  to a life of unalloyed happiness.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  &ldquo;But The Days Drop One By One&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Next morning was fine, a morning so bright and  balmy that the month might have been mistaken for September. Isola ran down to  the garden in her neat little morning frock and linen collar, and ran about  among the shrubs and autumn flowers in a much gayer mood than that of  yesterday. She loved her garden &mdash; small and modest as it was in comparison with  the grounds and gardens of her county neighbours &mdash; and on a morning like this  it was rapture to her to run from flower to flower, and from shrub to shrub,  with her great garden scissors in her hand, and her garden basket hanging over  her arm, clipping a withered leaf or a fading flower every here and there, or  plucking up those little groundsel plants which seem the perpetual expression  of the earth&rsquo;s fertility.</p>
<p>Alas! those pale tea-roses, those sulphur and  flame-coloured dahlias, meant the last crumbs of summer&rsquo;s plenteous feast. Soon  winter and barrenness would spread over the poor little garden; but even in the  chill dark heart of mid-winter those graceful conifers and shining laurels, the  vermilion on the holly bushes, the crimson of the hawthorn berries would give  beauty to the scene; and then would come the return of Persephone with her  hands full of gold, the abundant gold of crocus and daffodil, jonquil and pale  primrose, the rain of yellow blossoms which heralds the spring.</p>
<p>Half a year did not seem such an appalling interval  &mdash; nay, even the thought of a year of waiting did not scare her so much this  morning in the sunlight and fresh clear air as yesterday in the grey dim rain.  What an improvement Martin would find in the garden, should he return before  the end of the summer! How tall those Irish yews had grown by the gate yonder,  a pair of dark green obelisks keeping stately guard over the modest wooden  gate; and the escalonia hedge that screened the kitchen garden was two feet  higher since the spring! How the juniper at the corner of the grass plot had  shot up and thickened! Arbutus, laurel, ribes, everything had been growing as  shrubs only grow in the south and south-west of England. What a darling garden  it was, and how full of pleasure her life would be by-and-by, when Martin was  able to settle down and buy land, and give her a little herd of Jersey cows!  She had always envied the farmers&rsquo; wives in that fertile valley of the Rance,  where her childhood had been passed. And how delightful to have her own cows  and her own farmyard, and a pony-carriage to drive up and down the hilly  Cornish lanes and into the narrow little street of Fowey, and to ride her own  horse by her husband&rsquo;s side for long exploring rambles among those wild hills  towards Mevagissey!</p>
<p>She had only to wait patiently for a year or less,  and that bright life might be hers. She had no frivolous vanities, no craving  for dissipations and fine clothes, no fatal thirst for &ldquo;smartness.&rdquo; Her ideas  were essentially modest. She had never envied her sister, who had married a  rich stockbroker, and whose brand new red-brick house in Hans Place towered  above surrounding Chelsea as much as her diamonds eclipsed the jewels of other  middle-class matrons at the festal gatherings of South Kensington and  Bayswater. Gwendolen had married for wealth. Isola had married for love. She  had given her girlish affection to a man who was nearly thirty years her  senior, her heart going out to him almost at the beginning of their  acquaintance, first because he was a soldier, and in her mind a hero, and secondly  because he was kinder to her than anybody else had ever been.</p>
<p>He was her first admirer. That delicate loveliness,  as of some woodland flower, which distinguished Isola from the herd of women,  had been still in embryo when Major Disney spent a summer holiday between  Dinard and Dinan. She had scarcely ranked as a pretty girl two years ago. The  slight figure was denounced as scraggy; the pale face was voted sickly; and the  delicate features were spoken of as insignificant. Gwendolen&rsquo;s big fair face,  with its healthy roses and lilies, her bright hair, and well-developed figure,  had completely overshadowed the younger sister. Martin Disney was the first man  upon whom Isola&rsquo;s low-toned beauty had any power. He was drawn to her from the  very beginning. She listened so prettily, with such a bewitching modesty and  almost tremulous pleasure, when he talked to her, as they sat side by side on  the club ground at Dinard, watching Gwendolen playing tennis, superb in striped  flannel of delicate pink and cream colour. He could hardly believe that those  two were sisters. Isola was so slim and fragile, of such an ethereal  prettiness, owing so little to colouring, and nothing to redundancy of form.</p>
<p>He was told that Miss Manwaring was engaged to one  of the richest men in London. That, of course, was a gossip&rsquo;s fable, but it was  an established fact that Mr. Hazelrigg had made his fortune in South American  railways, water-works, and other public improvements, and could afford to make  a liberal settlement.</p>
<p>He showed no indisposition to be generous to his  handsome sweetheart. He settled seven hundred a year upon her, and told her  that she could spend as much of that income as she liked upon toilet and  pocket-money, and that he would invest her surplus advantageously for her.</p>
<p>The two sisters were married on the same day to  husbands who were their seniors by more than twenty years in one instance, by  thirty years in the other. Daniel Hazelrigg had passed his jubilee birthday  when he led Miss Manwaring to the altar; but he was a fine-looking man,  straight and tall, like his bride, with a ruddy complexion and iron-grey  moustache, and an air and bearing that savoured rather of the mess-room than  the city. He had been on the Stock Exchange ever since he came of age; but he  had made it the study of his life not to look city or to talk city. Nothing  could tempt him to expatiate upon the money market outside his office. He would  talk sport, travel, politics &mdash; even literature, of which he knew very little &mdash;  but not stocks and shares, Nicaraguas, or Reading and Philadelphias, Mexican  Street Railways, or Patagonian Building Society.</p>
<p>Isola read her sister&rsquo;s glowing descriptions of  dinners and routs, gowns by Worth or Cresser, suppers for two hundred people at  a guinea a head, from Gunter, waggon-loads of cut roses from Cheshunt or Cheam,  and felt no thrill of longing, no pang of envy. Life in the Angler&rsquo;s Nest might  be dull; but it was only dull because Martin was away. She would have felt more  solitary in Hans Place, had she accepted Gwendolen&rsquo;s invitation to spend her  Christmas there, than she would feel in the cottage by the river, even with no  better company than Tabitha, Shah, and Tim. She was essentially shy and  retiring. Her girlhood had been spent in a very narrow world, among people whom  she seemed to have known all her life; for while Gwendolen, who was six years  older, and had been &ldquo;out&rdquo; for four years before she married, joined in all the  little gaieties of the place, and was always making new acquaintance, Isola,  who was not &ldquo;out,&rdquo; spent her days for the most part in a half-neglected garden  on the slope of the hill that looks across the Rance towards the unseen sea.  The view from that garden was one of the finest in Western France; and it was  Isola&rsquo;s delight to sit in a little berceau at the end of a terrace walk, with  her books and work-basket and drawing-board, all through the long tranquil  summer day, in a silence broken by the sound of wheels and horses&rsquo; feet on the  viaduct and bridge two or three hundred feet below, or by the muffled music of  the organ in the convent chapel.</p>
<p>Tim, the fox-terrier, and Shah, the Persian cat,  were both on the lawn with their mistress this morning. They were not friendly  towards each other, but preserved an armed neutrality. Tim chased every stray  strange cat with a fury that threatened annihilation; and he always looked as  if he would like to give chase to Shah, when that dignified piece of fluff  moved slowly across the lawn before him with uplifted tail that seemed to wave  defiance; but he knew that any attack upon that valued personage would entail  punishment and disgrace. Isola loved both these animals &mdash; the cat a  wedding-present from an old Breton lady in Dinan, the terrier her husband&rsquo;s  parting legacy. &ldquo;Take care of Tim,&rdquo; he had said, the day they parted on board  the steamer at Venice.</p>
<p>The dog loved his mistress vehemently and  obtrusively, leaping into her lap at the slightest sign of indulgence in her  eye. The cat suffered himself to be adored, receiving all attentions with a  sleepy complacency.</p>
<p>It was only half-past eight, and the world was  looking its freshest. There was an opening in the shrubbery that let in a view  of the river, and just in front of this opening there was a rustic bench on  which Major Disney liked to smoke his after-breakfast pipe or after-dinner  cigar. The garden contained very little over two acres, but it was an old  garden, and there were some fine old trees, which must have shaded hoops and  powder, and pig-tails and knee-breeches. Major Disney had done a great deal in  the way of planting wherever there was room for improvement, and he had secured  to himself an elderly gardener of exceptional industry, who worked in the  garden as if he loved it. Tabitha, again, was one of those wonderful women who  know all about everything except books; and she, too, loved the garden, and  helped at weeding and watering, in seasons of pressure. Thus it had come to  pass that these two acres of velvet lawn and flower-bed, shrubbery, and trim,  old-fashioned garden had acquired a reputation in Trelasco, and people  frequently complimented Mrs. Disney about her garden.</p>
<p>She was proud of their praises, remembering the  straggling rose-bushes and lavender, and unkempt flower-beds, and overgrown  cabbages, and loose shingly paths in that old garden at Dinan, which she had  loved despite its neglected condition. Her house at Trelasco was just as  superior to the house at Dinan, as garden was to garden. She often thought of  her old home, the shabby square house, with walls and shutters of dazzling  white, shining brown floors, and worn-out furniture of the Empire period,  furniture which had been shabby and out of repair when Colonel Manwaring took  the house furnished, intending to spend a month or two in retirement at Dinan  with his wife and her firstborn, a chubby little girl of five. They had lost a  promising boy of a year old, and the colonel, having no reason for living  anywhere in particular, and very little to live upon, thought that residence in  a foreign country would improve his wife&rsquo;s health and spirits. He had been told  that Dinan was picturesque and cheap: and he had put himself and his family on  board the <em>St. Malo</em> steamer and had  gone out like an emigrant to push his fortunes in a strange land. He had even  an idea that he might get &ldquo;something to do&rdquo; in Dinan &mdash; a secretaryship of a  club, an agency, or managerial post of some kind, never having cultivated the  art of self-examination so far as to discover that he must have proved utterly  incapable, had any such occasion presented itself.</p>
<p>The occasion never did present itself. The one  English club existent at Dinan in those days was amply provided with the  secretarial element. There was nothing in Dinan for an Englishman to manage; no  English agency required. Colonel Manwaring settled down into a kind of  somnolent submission to obscure fortunes. He liked the old town, and he liked  the climate. He liked the cooking, and he liked being out of the way of all the  people he knew, and whose vicinity would have obliged him to live up to a  certain conventional level. He liked to get his English newspapers upon French  soil, and it irked him not that they were thirty-six hours old. He liked to  bask in the sunshine on the terrace above the Rance, or in the open places of  the town. He liked talking of the possibilities of an impending war, in very  dubious French, with the French officers, whose acquaintance he made at club or  caf&eacute;. He had sold his commission and sunk the proceeds of the sale upon an  annuity. He had a little income of his own, and his wife had a little money  from a maiden aunt, and these resources just enabled him to live with a certain  unpretending comfort. He had a good Breton cook, and an old Scotch valet and  butler, who would have gone through fire and water for his master. Mrs.  Manwaring was a thoroughly negative character, placid as summer seas,  sympathetic and helpless. She let Macgregor and Antoinette manage the house for  her, do all the catering, pay all the bills, and work the whole machinery of  her domestic life. She rejoiced in having a good-tempered husband and obedient  daughters. She had no boys to put her in a fever of anxiety lest they should be  making surreptitious ascents in balloons or staking their little all upon Zero  at the &ldquo;Etablissement&rdquo; at Dinard. In summer she sat all day in one particular  south window, knitting stockings for the colonel and reading the English  papers. In winter she occupied herself in the same manner by the chimney  corner. She devoted one day in the week to writing long letters to distant  relatives. Once a day, weather permitting, she took a gentle constitutional  walk upon the terrace above the Rance, with one of her daughters. Needless to  say that in this life of harmless apathy she had grown very stout, and that she  had forgotten almost every accomplishment of her girlhood.</p>
<p>From the placid monotony of life in Brittany to the  placid monotony of life in Cornwall, was not a startling transition; yet when  she married Martin Disney, and bade her commonplace father and her apathetic  mother good-bye, Isola felt as if she had escaped from stagnation into a fresh  and vigorous atmosphere. Disney&rsquo;s character made all the difference. He was  every inch a soldier, a keen politician, a man who had seen many countries and  read many books, clear-brained, strong-willed, energetic, self-reliant. She  felt what it was to belong to somebody who was capable of taking care of her.  She trusted him implicitly; and she loved him with as deep a love as a girl of  nineteen is capable of feeling for any lover. It may be that the capacity for  deep feeling is but half developed at that age, and in that one fact may be  found the key to many domestic mysteries; mysteries of unions which begin in  the gladness and warmth of responsive affection, and which, a few years later,  pass into a frozen region of indifference or are wrecked on sunken rocks of  guilty passion. Certain it was that Isola Manwaring gave her hand to this  grave, middle-aged soldier, in all the innocence of a first love; and the love  with which he rewarded her confidence, the earnest watchful love of a man of  mature years, was enough for her happiness. That honeymoon time, that summer of  installation in the Cornish cottage, and then the leisurely journey to Venice  in the waning brilliance of a southern October, seemed like one long happy  dream, as she looked back upon it now, after a year of solitude.</p>
<p>The doctor had decided that, in the delicate health  in which she found herself at the end of that summer, it would be dangerous for  her to accompany her husband to India, more especially as a campaign in Burmah  meant roughing it, and she would in all probability have been separated from  him in the East; so they bade each other a sad good-bye at Venice, and Isola  travelled quickly homeward, all possible comfort having been secured for her on  the way, by her husband&rsquo;s forethought. It had been a long, sad, sleepy journey,  through a rain-blurred landscape, and she was glad when the evening of the  fourth day brought her to the snug little dining-room in the Angler&rsquo;s Nest,  where Tabitha was waiting for her with a cheerful fire and the amber-shaded  reading lamp, and the most delightful little composite meal of chicken and  tongue, and tart, and cream, and tea. It was pleasant to be among familiar  things, after that long journey in stuffy ladies&rsquo; carriages, with elderly  invalids, whose chief talk was of their ailments. Pleasant to see the Shah&rsquo;s  solemn sea-green eyes staring at her, and to have to repulse the demonstrative  attentions of Tim, who leapt upon her lap and licked her face vehemently every  time he caught her off her guard.</p>
<p>She was ill and broken down after her journey, and  that sad parting, and she hid her tears upon Tabitha&rsquo;s comfortable arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be at least a year before he comes back,&rdquo;  she sobbed. &ldquo;How can I live without him all that dreary time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabitha thought it was very hard upon the  girl-wife, but affected to make light of it. &ldquo;Lor, bless you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said,  &ldquo;a year looks a long time, but it isn&rsquo;t much when you come to grapple with it.  There&rsquo;ll be such a lot for you to do. There&rsquo;ll be the garden. We ought to make  ever so many improvements next spring and summer, against the master comes  home. And there&rsquo;s your piano. You want to improve yourself &mdash; I&rsquo;ve heard you say  so &mdash; and you can get up all sorts of new tunes, and won&rsquo;t the major be pleased with  you; and then &mdash; there&rsquo;ll be something else to occupy your mind before next  summer comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That &ldquo;something else&rdquo; which was to have filled  Isola&rsquo;s empty life with a new interest, ended in disappointment. She was very  ill at the beginning of the new year, and Tabitha nursed her with motherly  tenderness long after the doctor and the professional nurse had renounced their  care of her. She regained strength very slowly after that serious illness, and  it was only in June that she was able to take the lonely rambles she loved, or  row in her little boat upon the river.</p>
<p>Tabitha was a servant in a thousand, faithful and  devoted, clever, active, and industrious. She had been maid to Martin Disney&rsquo;s  mother for nearly fifteen years, had nursed her mistress through a long and  weary illness, and had closed her eyes in death. Martin parted with that  faithful servant with reluctance after the breaking up of his mother&rsquo;s  household, and he told her if he should marry and have a house of his own &mdash; a  very remote contingency &mdash; she must be his housekeeper. Love and marriage came  upon him before the end of the year, as a delightful surprise. He bought the  Angler&rsquo;s Nest, and he engaged Tabitha for the rest of her life, at wages which,  beginning at a liberal figure, were to rise a pound every Christmas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I cared about wages, Mr. Martin,&rdquo; exclaimed  Tabitha. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just as soon come to you for nothing. I&rsquo;ve got more clothes than  will last my time, I&rsquo;ll be bound. You&rsquo;d only have to find me in shoe-leather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had never got out of the way of calling her  master by the name by which she had first known him, when his father and elder  brother were both at home, in the old family house at Fowey. In all moments of  forgetfulness he was still &ldquo;Mr. Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, in this bright November morning, Tabitha  came out to say that breakfast was waiting for her young mistress, and mistress  and maid went in together to the cosy dining-room, where the small round table  near the window was arranged as only Tabitha could arrange a table &mdash; with  autumn flowers, and spotless damask, and a new-laid egg, and a dish of honey,  and some dainty little rolls of Tabitha&rsquo;s own making, nestling in a napkin, a  breakfast for a Princess in a fairy tale.</p>
<p>There was only one other servant in the little  household &mdash; a bouncing, rosy-cheeked Cornish girl, who was very industrious  under Tabitha&rsquo;s eye, and very idle when she was out of that faithful  housekeeper&rsquo;s ken. Tabitha cooked and took care of everything, and for the most  part waited upon her mistress in this time of widowhood, although Susan was  supposed to be parlour-maid.</p>
<p>Tabitha poured out the tea, and buttered a roll,  while Isola leant back in the bamboo chair and played with the Shah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew him do such a thing before,&rdquo; said  Tabitha, in continuation of a theme which had been fully discussed last night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was very kind and polite; but it was not  such a tremendous thing, after all,&rdquo; answered Isola, still occupied with the  Persian. &ldquo;He could hardly stand by and see one drowned. You have no idea what  the rain was like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to send you home in his own carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing else for him to do &mdash; except send  me home in the gardener&rsquo;s cart. He could not have turned out a dog in such  weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thing that never happened before, and it  just shows what a respect he must have for the Disneys. You don&rsquo;t know how  stand-offish he is with all the people about here &mdash; how he keeps himself to  himself. Not a bit like his father and mother. They used to entertain all the  neighbourhood, and they went everywhere, as affable as you like. He has taken  care to show people that he doesn&rsquo;t want their company. They say he has led a  very queer kind of life at home and abroad; never settling down anywhere, here  to-day and gone to-morrow; roving about with his yacht. I don&rsquo;t believe any  good ever comes of a young gentleman like that having a yacht. It would be ever  so much better for him to live at the Mount and keep a pack of harriers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should a yacht be bad?&rdquo; asked Isola, lazily  beginning her breakfast, Tabitha standing by the table all the time, ready for  conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. It gives a young man too much  liberty,&rdquo; answered Tabitha, shaking her head with a meaning air, as if with a  knowledge of dark things in connection with yachts. &ldquo;He can keep just what company  he likes on board &mdash; gentlemen or ladies. He can gamble &mdash; or drink &mdash; as much as  he likes. There&rsquo;s nobody to check him. Sundays and weekdays, night and day, are  all alike to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Lostwithiel is not particularly young,&rdquo; said  Isola, musingly, not paying much attention to this homily on yachts. &ldquo;He must  be thirty, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-two last birthday. He ought to marry and  settle down. They say he&rsquo;s very clever, and that he&rsquo;s bound to make a figure in  politics some of these odd days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola looked at the clock on the chimney-piece &mdash; a  gilt horse-shoe with onyx nails; one of her wedding presents. It was early yet  &mdash; only half-past nine. Lord Lostwithiel had talked about calling to inquire  after her health. She felt overpowered with shyness at the thought of seeing  him again, alone &mdash; with no stately Mrs. Mayne to take the edge off a <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em>. Anything to escape such an  ordeal! There was her boat &mdash; that boat of which she was perfect mistress, and  in which she went for long, dawdling expeditions towards Fowey or Lostwithiel  with only Tim for her companion &mdash; Tim, who was the best of company, in almost  perpetual circulation between stem and stern, balancing himself in perilous  places every now and then, to bark furiously at imaginary foes in slowly passing  fishermen&rsquo;s boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any fancy about lunch, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked  Tabitha, lingering with feather-brush in hand over a side-table, on which  work-basket, books, writing-case, and flower-vases were arranged with tasteful  neatness by those skilful hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you dear old Tabbie; you know that anything  will do for me. Bread and jam, if you like, and some of your clotted cream.  Won&rsquo;t it be nice when we have our very own dairy, and our very own cows, who  will know us and be fond of us, like Tim and the Shah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put on her hat and jacket, and went out into  the garden again, singing &ldquo;La Lettre de Perichole&rdquo; as she went. It was a  capital idea to take refuge in her boat. If his lordship should call &mdash; which  was doubtful &mdash; since he might be one of that numerous race of people whose days  are made up of unfulfilled intentions and promises never realized &mdash; if he  should call, she would be far away when he came. He would make his inquiry,  leave his card, which would look nice in the old Indian bowl on the hall-table.  Such cards have a power of flotation unknown to other pasteboard; they are  always at the top.</p>
<p>Isola went to the little boat-house on the edge of  the lawn, Tim following her. She pushed the light skiff down the slope into the  water, and in a few minutes more her sculls were in the rowlocks and she was  moving slowly up the river, between autumnal woods, in a silence broken only by  the dip of the sculls and the little rippling sound as the water dropped away  from them. A good deal of her life was spent like this, moving slowly up the  river through that deep silence of the woodland shores. The river was as  beautiful as the Dart almost, but lonelier and more silent. It was Martin  Disney&rsquo;s river &mdash; the river whose ripples had soothed his mother&rsquo;s dying ears &mdash;  the last of all earthly sounds that had been heard in the stillness of the  death-chamber.</p>
<p>In that tranquil atmosphere Isola used to dream of  her absent husband and of that mystical world of the East which seemed made up  of dreams &mdash; the world of Brahma and Buddha, of jewel-bedecked Rajahs and  Palace-tombs &mdash; world of beauty and of terror; of tropical forests, tigers,  orchids, serpents, elephants, Thugs.</p>
<p>She dreamt her dream of that strange world in fear  and trembling, conjuring up scenes of horror &mdash; tiger hunts; snakes hidden in  the corner of a tent; battle; fever; fire; mutiny. Her morbid imagination  pictured all possible and impossible danger for the man she loved. And then she  thought of his home-coming &mdash; for good, for good &mdash; for all the span of their  joint lives; and she longed for that return with the sickness of hope deferred.</p>
<p>She would go back to the Angler&rsquo;s Nest sometimes  after one of these dreamy days upon the river, and would pace about the house  or the garden, planning things for her husband&rsquo;s return, as if he were due next  day. She would wheel his own particular chair to the drawing-room fireplace,  and look at it, and arrange the fall of the curtains before the old-fashioned  bow-window, and change the position of the lamp, and alter the books on the  shelves, and do this and that with an eye to effect, anxious to discover how  the room might be made prettiest, cosiest, most lovable and home-like &mdash; for  him, for him, for him!</p>
<p>And now she had to resign herself to a year&rsquo;s  delay, perhaps. Yes, he had said it might be a year. All that bright picture of  union and content, which had seemed so vivid and so near, had now grown dim and  pale. It had melted into a shadowy distance. To a girl who has but just passed  her twentieth birthday a year of waiting and delay seems an eternity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t think of him,&rdquo; she said to herself,  plunging her sculls fiercely into the rippling water. The tide was running  down, and it was strong enough to have carried her little boat out to sea like  an autumn leaf swept along the current. &ldquo;I must try to lull my mind to sleep,  as if I were an enchanted Princess, and so bridge over twelve slow months of  loneliness. I won&rsquo;t think of you, Martin, my good, brave, truest of the true!  I&rsquo;ll occupy my poor, foolish little mind. I&rsquo;ll write a novel, perhaps, like old  Miss Carver at Dinan. Anything in the world &mdash; just to keep my thoughts from  always brooding on one subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rowed on steadily, hugging the shore under the  wooded hillside, where the rich autumn colouring and the clear, cool lights  were so full of beauty &mdash; a beauty which she could feel, with a vague, dim sense  which just touched the realm of poetry. Perhaps she felt the same sense of loss  which Keats or Alfred de Musset would have felt in the stillness of such a  scene &mdash; the want of something to people the wood and the river &mdash; some race of  beings loftier than fishermen and peasants; some of those mystic forms which  the poet sees amidst the shadows of old woods or in the creeks and sheltered  inlets of a secluded river.</p>
<p>She thought, with a half-smile, of yesterday&rsquo;s  adventure. What importance that foolish Tabitha gave to so simple an incident;  the merest commonplace courtesy, necessitated by circumstances; and only  because the person who had been commonly courteous was Richard Hulbert,  thirteenth Baron Lostwithiel. Thirteenth Baron! There lay the distinction.  These Cornish folks worshipped antique lineage. Tabitha would have thought very  little of a mushroom peer&rsquo;s civility, although he had sent her mistress home in  a chariot and four. She was no worshipper of wealth, and she turned up her  blunt old nose at Mr. Crowther, of Glenaveril &mdash; the great new red-brick mansion  which had sprung up like a fungus amidst the woods only yesterday &mdash; because he  had made his money in trade, albeit his trade had been upon a large scale, and  altogether genteel and worthy to be esteemed &mdash; a great cloth factory at Stroud,  which was said to have clad half the army at one period of modern history.</p>
<p>Poor, foolish Tabitha! What would she have thought  of the tea-drinking in that lovely old room, mysteriously beautiful in the  light of a wood fire &mdash; the playful, uncertain light which glorifies everything?  What would she have thought of those walls of books &mdash; richly bound books, books  in sombre brown, big books and little books, from floor to ceiling? A room  which made those poor little oak bookcases in the cottage parlour something to  blush for. What would Tabitha have thought of his deferential kindness &mdash; that  tone of deepest consideration with which such men treat all women, even the old  and uncomely? She could hardly have helped admiring his good manners, whatever  dark things she might have been told about his earlier years.</p>
<p>Why should he not have a yacht? It seemed the  fittest life for a man without home ties; a man still young, and with no need  to labour at a profession. What better life could there be than that free  wandering from port to port over a romantic sea? &mdash; and to Isola all seas were  alike mysterious and romantic.</p>
<p>She dawdled away the morning; she sculled against  the stream for nearly three hours, and then let her boat drift down the river  to the garden above the towpath. It was long past her usual time for luncheon  when she moored her boat to the little wooden steps, leaving it for Thomas, the  gardener, to pull up into the boat-house. She had made up her mind that if  Lostwithiel troubled himself to make any inquiry about her health he would call  in the morning.</p>
<p>She had guessed rightly. Tabitha was full of his  visit, and his wondrous condescension. He had called at eleven o&rsquo;clock, on his  way to the railway station at Fowey. He called in the most perfect of T carts,  with a pair of bright bays. Tabitha had opened the door to him. He had asked  quite anxiously about Mrs. Disney&rsquo;s health. He had walked round the garden with  Tabitha and admired everything, and had told her that Major Disney had a better  gardener than any he had at the Mount, after which he had left her charmed by  his amiability. And so this little episode in Isola&rsquo;s life came to a pleasant  end, leaving no record but his lordship&rsquo;s card, lying like a jewel on the top  of less distinguished names in the old Indian bowl.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  &ldquo;Oh Moment One And Infinite!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Isola fancied that her adventure was all over and  done with after that ceremonious call of inquiry; but in so narrow a world as  that of Trelasco it was scarcely possible to have seen the last of a man who  lived within three miles; and she and Lord Lostwithiel met now and then in the  course of her solitary rambles. The walk into Fowey, following the old disused  railway, was almost her favourite, and one which she had occasion to take  oftener than any other, since Tabitha was a stay-at-home person, and expected  her young mistress to do all the marketing, so that Isola had usually some  errand to take her into the narrow street on the hillside above the sea. It was  at Fowey that she oftenest met Lostwithiel. His yacht, the <em>Vendetta</em>, was in the harbour under repairs, and he went down to  look at the work daily, and often dawdled upon the deck till dusk, watching the  carpenters, or talking to his captain. They had been half over the world  together, master and man, and were almost as familiar as brothers. The crew  were half English and half foreign; and it was a curious mixture of languages  in which Lostwithiel talked to them. They were most of them old hands on board  the <em>Vendetta</em>, and would have stood by  the owner of the craft if he had wanted to sail her up the Phlegethon.</p>
<p>She was a schooner of two hundred and fifty tons,  built for speed, and with a rakish rig. She had cost, with her fittings, her  extra silk sails for racing, more money than Lostwithiel cared to remember; but  he loved her as a man loves his mistress, and if she were costly and exacting,  she was no worse than other mistresses, and she was true as steel, which they  are not always; and so he felt that he had money&rsquo;s worth in her. He showed her  to Isola one evening from the promontory above the harbour, where she met him  in the autumn sundown. Her work at the butcher&rsquo;s and the grocer&rsquo;s being done,  she had gone up to that airy height by Point Neptune to refresh herself with a  long look seaward before she went back to her home in the valley. Lostwithiel  took her away from the Point, and made her look down into the harbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a beauty?&rdquo; he asked, pointing below.</p>
<p>Her inexperienced eyes roamed about among the  boats, colliers, fishing-boats, half a dozen yachts of different tonnage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is yours?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which? Why, there is only one decent boat in the  harbour. The schooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw which boat he meant by the direction in  which he flourished his walking-stick, but was not learned in distinctions of  rig. The <em>Vendetta</em>, being under  repair, did not seem to her especially lovely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you pretty cabins?&rdquo; she asked childishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, they&rsquo;re pretty enough; but that&rsquo;s not the  question. Look at her lines. She skims over the water like a gull. Ladies seem  to think only what a boat looks like inside. I believe my boat is rather  exceptional, from a lady&rsquo;s point of view. Will you come on board and have a look  at her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, no; I couldn&rsquo;t possibly. It will be dark  before I get home as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wouldn&rsquo;t take you a quarter of an hour, and  we could row you up the river in no time &mdash; ever so much faster than you could  walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola looked frightened at the very idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the world!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tabitha would think  I had gone mad. She would begin to fancy that I could never go out without  over-staying the daylight, and troubling you to send me home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but it is so long since you were last  belated,&rdquo; he said, in his low caressing voice, with a tone that was new to her  and different from all other voices; &ldquo;ages and ages ago &mdash; half a lifetime.  There could be no harm in being just a little late this mild evening, and I  would row you home &mdash; myself, under the new moon. Look at her swinging up in the  grey blue there above Polruan. She looks like a fairy boat, anchored in the sky  by that star hanging a fathom below her keel. I look at her, and wish &mdash; wish &mdash;  wish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up, pale in the twilight, with dark deep-set  eyes, of which it was never easy to read the expression. Perhaps that  inscrutable look made those sunken and by no means brilliant eyes more  interesting than some much handsomer eyes &mdash; interesting with the deep interest  that belongs to the unknowable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said Isola. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that I shall  be very late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night. You would be earlier if you would  trust to the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out his hand, and she gave him hers,  hesitatingly for the first time in their acquaintance. It was after this parting  in the wintry sundown that she first began to look troubled at meeting him.</p>
<p>The troubled feeling grew upon her somehow. In a  life so lonely and uneventful trifles assume undue importance. She tried to  avoid him, and on her journeys to Fowey she finished her business in the  village street and turned homewards without having climbed the promontory by  that rugged walk she loved so well. It needed some self-denial to forego that  keen pleasure of standing on the windy height and gazing across the western sea  towards Ushant and her native province; but she knew that Lord Lostwithiel  spent a good deal of his time lounging on the heights above the harbour, and  she did not want to meet him again.</p>
<p>Although she lived her quiet life in the shortening  days for nearly a month without meeting him, she was not allowed to forget his  existence. Wherever she went people talked about him and speculated about him.  Every detail of his existence made matter for discussion; his yacht, his  political opinions, his talents, his income, his matrimonial prospects, the  likelihood or unlikelihood of his settling down permanently at the Mount, and  taking the hounds, which were probably to be without a master within a  measurable distance of time. There was so little to talk about in Trelasco and  those scattered hamlets between Fowey and Lostwithiel.</p>
<p>Isola found herself joining in the talk at  afternoon tea-parties, those casual droppings in of charitable ladies who had  been their rounds among the cottagers and came back to the atmosphere of  gentility worn out by long stories of woes and ailments, sore legs and  rheumatic joints, and were very glad to discuss a local nobleman over a cup of  delicately flavoured Indian tea in the glow of a flower-scented drawing-room.</p>
<p>Among other houses Mrs. Disney visited Glenaveril,  Mr. Crowther&rsquo;s great red-brick mansion, with its pepper-box turrets, and  Jacobean windows, after the manner of Burleigh House by Stamford town.</p>
<p>Here lived in wealth and state quite the most  important family within a mile of Trelasco, the Vansittart Crowthers, erst of  Pilbury Mills, near Stroud, now as much county as a family can make itself  after its head has passed his fortieth birthday. Nobody quite knew how Mr.  Crowther had come to be a Vansittart &mdash; unless by the easy process of baptism  and the complaisance of an aristocratic sponsor; but the Crowthers had been  known in Stroud for nearly two hundred years, and had kept their sacks upright,  as Mr. Crowther called it, all that time.</p>
<p>Fortune had favoured this last of the Crowthers, and,  at forty years of age, he had found himself rich enough to dispose of his  business to two younger brothers and a brother-in-law, and to convert himself  into a landed proprietor. He bought up all the land that was to be had about  Trelasco. Cornish people cling to their land like limpets to a rock; and it was  not easy to acquire the ownership of the soil. In the prosperous past, when  land was paying nearly four per cent. in other parts of England, Cornishmen  were content to hold estates that yielded only two per cent.; but the days of  decay had come when Mr. Crowther entered the market, and he was able to buy out  more than one gentleman of ancient lineage.</p>
<p>When he had secured his land, he sent to Plymouth  for an architect, and he so harried that architect and so tampered with his  drawings that the result of much labour and outlay was that monstrosity in red  brick with stone dressings, known in the neighbourhood as Glenaveril. Mr.  Crowther&rsquo;s elder daughter was deep in Lord Lytton&rsquo;s newly published poem when  the house was being finished, and had imposed that euphonious name upon her  father. Glenaveril. The house really was in a glen, or at least in a wooded  valley, and Glenaveril seemed to suit it to perfection; and so the romantic  name of a romantic poem was cut in massive Gothic letters on the granite  pillars of Vansittart Crowther&rsquo;s gate, beneath a shield which exhibited the  coat of arms made and provided by the Herald&rsquo;s College.</p>
<p>Mrs. Vansittart Crowther was at home on Thursday  afternoons, when the choicest Indian tea and the thickest cream, coffee as in  Paris, and the daintiest cakes and muffins which a professed cook could  provide, furnished the zest to conversation; for it could scarcely be said that  the conversation gave a zest to those creature comforts. It would be perhaps  nearer the mark to say that Mrs. Crowther was supposed to sit in the  drawing-room on these occasions while the two Miss Crowthers were at home. The  mistress of Glenaveril was not an aspiring woman; and in her heart of hearts  she preferred Gloucestershire to Cornwall, and the stuccoed villa on the  Cheltenham road, with its acre and a half of tennis-lawn and flower-beds, open  to the blazing sun, and powdered with the summer dust, to Glenaveril, with its  solemn belt of woodlands, and its too spacious grandeur. She was not vulgar or  illiterate. She never misplaced an aspirate. She had learnt to play the piano  and to talk French at the politest of young ladies&rsquo; schools at Cheltenham. She  never dressed outrageously, or behaved rudely. She had neither red hands nor  splay feet. She was in all things blameless; and yet Belinda and Alicia, her  daughters, were ashamed of her, and did their utmost to keep her, and her  tastes, and her opinions in the background. She had no style. She was not  &ldquo;smart.&rdquo; She seemed incapable of grasping the ideas, or understanding the ways  of smart people; or at least her daughters thought so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother is one of the best women I know,&rdquo; said  the curate to Alicia, being on the most confidential terms with both sisters, &ldquo;and  yet you and Miss Crowther are always trying to edit her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father wants a great deal more editing than  mother,&rdquo; said Belinda, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s no use in talking to him. He is encased in  the armour of self-esteem. It made my blood run cold to see him taking Lord  Lostwithiel over the grounds and stables the other day &mdash; praising everything,  and pointing out this and that, &mdash; and even saying how much things had cost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it was vulgar,&rdquo; agreed the curate, &ldquo;but  it&rsquo;s human nature. I&rsquo;ve seen a duke behave in pretty much the same way.  Children are always proud of their new toys, and men are but children of a  larger growth, don&rsquo;t you know. You&rsquo;ll find there&rsquo;s a family resemblance in  humanity, and that nature is stronger than training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Lostwithiel would never behave in that kind  of way &mdash; boring people about his stables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Lostwithiel doesn&rsquo;t care about stables &mdash; he  would bore you about his yacht, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he never talks of himself or his own affairs.  That is just the charm of his manner. He makes us all believe that he is  thinking about us; and yet I dare say he forgets us directly he is outside the  gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he does,&rdquo; replied Mr. Colfox, the curate.  &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a more selfish man living than Lostwithiel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fair Belinda looked at him angrily. There are  assertions which young ladies make on purpose to have them controverted.</p>
<p>Mrs. Disney hated the great red-brick porch, with  its vaulted roof and monstrous iron lantern, and the bell which made such a  clamour, as if it meant fire, or at least dinner, when she touched the hanging  brass handle. She hated to find herself face to face with a tall footman, who  hardly condescended to say whether his mistress were at home or not, but just  preceded her languidly along the broad corridor, where the carpet was so thick  that it felt like turf, and flung open the drawing-room door with an air, and  pronounced her name into empty space, so remote were the half-dozen ladies at  the other end of the room, clustered round Belinda&rsquo;s tea-table, and fed with  cake by Alicia, while Mrs. Crowther sat in the window a little way off, with  her basket of woolwork at her side, and her fat somnolent pug lying at her  feet. To Isola it was an ordeal to have to walk the length of the drawing-room,  navigating her course amidst an archipelago of expensive things &mdash; Florentine  tables, portfolios of engravings, Louis Seize Jardini&egrave;res, easels supporting  the last expensive etching from Goupil&rsquo;s &mdash; to the window where Mrs. Crowther  waited to receive her, rising with her lap full of wools, to shake hands with  simple friendliness and without a vestige of style. Belinda shook hands on a  level with the tip of her sharp <em>retrouss&eacute;</em> nose, and twirled the silken train of her tea-gown with the serpentine grace of  Sarah Bernhardt. She prided herself on those serpentine movements and languid  graces which belong to the Gr&aelig;co-Belgravian period; while Alicia held herself  like a ramrod, and took her stand upon being nothing if not sporting. Her  olive-cloth gown and starched collar, her neat double-soled boots and cloth  gaiters, were a standing reproach to Belinda&rsquo;s silken slovenliness and  embroidered slippers, always dropping off her restless feet, and being chased  surreptitiously among her lace and pongee frillings. Poor Mrs. Crowther  disliked the Guard&rsquo;s collar, which she felt was writing premature wrinkles upon  her younger girl&rsquo;s throat, but she positively loathed the loose elegance of the  Indian silk tea-gown, with its wide Oriental sleeves, exhibiting naked arms to  the broad daylight. That sloppy raiment made a discord in the subdued harmony  of the visitors&rsquo; tailor-made gowns &mdash; well worn some of them &mdash; brown, and grey,  and indigo, and russet; and Mrs. Crowther was tortured by the conviction that  her elder daughter looked disreputable. This honest matron was fond of Isola  Disney. In her own simple phraseology, she had &ldquo;taken to her;&rdquo; and pressed the  girl-wife to come every Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be so lonely for you,&rdquo; she said gently,  &ldquo;with your husband so far away, and you such a child, too. I wonder your mamma  doesn&rsquo;t come and stay with you for a bit. You must always come on our  Thursdays. Now mind you do, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think our Thursdays are remarkably  enlivening, mother,&rdquo; said Alicia, objecting to the faintest suggestion of  fussiness, the crying sin of both her parents. And then she turned to Isola,  and measured her from head to foot. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a pity you don&rsquo;t hunt,&rdquo; she  said. &ldquo;We had a splendid morning with the hounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I may get a little hunting by-and-by, when  my husband comes home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but one can&rsquo;t begin all at once; and this is a  difficult country; breakneck hills, and nasty banks. Have you hunted much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly at all. I was out in a boar-hunt once, near  Angers, but only as a looker-on. It was a grand sight. The Duke of Beaufort  came over to Brittany on purpose to join in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How glorious a boar-hunt must be! I must get my  father to take me to Angers next year. Do you know a great many people there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only two or three professors at the college,  and the Marquis de Querangal, the gentleman who has the boar-hounds. His  daughter used to visit at Dinan, and she and I were great friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Lostwithiel talked about boar-hunting the  other night,&rdquo; said Alicia. &ldquo;It must be capital fun.&rdquo; His name recurred in this  way, whatever the conversation might be, with more certainty than Zero on the  wheel at roulette.</p>
<p>He had been there in the evening, Isola thought.  There had been a dinner-party, perhaps, at which he had been present. She had  not long to wonder. The name once pronounced, the stream of talk flowed on.  Yes, there had been a dinner, and Lord Lostwithiel had been delightful; so  brilliant in conversation as compared with everybody else; so witty, so  cynical, so <em>fin de si&egrave;cle</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear him say anything very much out of  the common,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crowther, in her matter-of-fact way.</p>
<p>She liked having a nobleman or any other local  magnate at her table; but she had too much common sense to be hypnotized by his  magnificence, and made to taste milk and water as Maronean wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Lord Lostwithiel?&rdquo; Belinda asked  languidly, as Isola sipped her tea, sitting shyly in the broad glare of a  colossal fireplace. &ldquo;Oh yes, by-the-by, you met him here the week before last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Disney blushed to the roots of those soft tendril-like  curls which clustered about her forehead; but she said never a word. She had no  occasion to tell them the history of that meeting in the rain, or of those many  subsequent meetings which had drifted her into almost the familiarity of an old  friendship. They might take credit to themselves for having made her acquainted  with their star if they liked. She had seen plenty of smart people at Dinan in  those sunny summer months when visitors came from Dinard to look at the old  quiet inland city. Lostwithiel&rsquo;s rank had no disturbing influence upon her  mind. It was himself &mdash; something in his look and in his voice, in the mere  touch of his hand &mdash; an indescribable something which of late had moved her in  his presence, and made her faintly tremulous at the sound of his name.</p>
<p>He was announced while they were talking of him,  and he seemed surprised to come suddenly upon that slim unobtrusive figure  almost hidden by Belinda&rsquo;s flowing garment and fuller form. Belinda was  decidedly handsome &mdash; handsomer than an heiress need be; but she was also just a  shade larger than an heiress need be at three and twenty. She was a Rubens&rsquo;  beauty, expansive, florid, and fair, with reddish auburn hair piled on the top  of her head. Sitting between this massive beauty and the still more massive  chimney-piece, Mrs. Disney was completely hidden from the new arrival.</p>
<p>He discovered her suddenly while he was shaking  hands with Belinda, and his quick glance of pleased surprise did not escape  that young lady&rsquo;s steely blue eyes. Not a look or a breath ever does escape  observation in a village drawing-room. Even the intellectual people, the people  who devour all Mudie&rsquo;s most solid books &mdash; travels, memoirs, metaphysics,  agnostic novels &mdash; even these are as keenly interested in their neighbours&rsquo; thoughts  and feelings as the unlettered rustic in the village street.</p>
<p>Lostwithiel took the proffered cup of tea, and  planted himself near Mrs. Disney, with his back against the marble caryatid  which bore up one-half of the chimney-piece. Alicia began to talk to him about  his yacht. How were the repairs going on? and so on, and so on, delighted to  air her technical knowledge. He answered her somewhat languidly, as if the <em>Vendetta</em> were not first in his thoughts  at this particular moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about this ball?&rdquo; he asked presently. &ldquo;You  are all going to be there, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the hunt ball at Lostwithiel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! What other ball could I mean? It is the  great festivity of these parts. The one tremendous event of the winter season.  It was a grand idea of you new people to revive the old festivity, which had  become a tradition. I wore my first dress coat at the Lostwithiel Hunt Ball  nearly twenty years ago. I think it was there I first fell in love, with a  young lady in pink tulle, who was miserable because she had been mistaken  enough to wear pink at a hunt ball. I condoled with her, assured her that in my  eyes she was lovely, although her gown clashed &mdash; that was her word, I remember  &mdash; with the pink coats. My coat was not pink, and I believe she favoured me a  little on that account. She gave me a good many waltzes in the course of the  evening, and I can answer for her never wearing that pink frock again, for I  trampled it to shreds. There were traces of her to be found all over the rooms,  as if I had been Greenacre and she my victim&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be rather a humdrum ball, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo;  said Belinda. &ldquo;All the best people seem to be away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that if the worst people can dance. I  am on the committee, so I will answer for the supper and the champagne. You  like a dry brand, of course, Miss Crowther?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never touch wine of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; then my chief virtue will be thrown away upon  you. Are all young ladies blue-ribbonites nowadays, I wonder? Mrs. Disney, pray  tell me you are interested in the champagne question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to the ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not going! Oh, but it is a duty which you owe to  the county! Do you think because you are an alien and a foreigner you can flout  our local gaieties &mdash; fleer at our solemnities? No, it is incumbent upon you to  give us your support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, you must go to the ball,&rdquo; put in  Mrs. Crowther, in her motherly tone. &ldquo;You are much too young and pretty to stay  at home, like Cinderella, while we are all enjoying ourselves. Of course you  must go. Mr. Crowther has put down his name for five and twenty tickets, and  I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be one to spare for you, although we shall have a large  house-party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you are too kind, but I couldn&rsquo;t think &mdash;  &mdash;&rdquo; faltered Isola, with a distressed look.</p>
<p>She knew that Lostwithiel was watching her from his  vantage ground ever so far above her head. A man of six feet two has  considerable advantages at a billiard-table, and in a quiet flirtation carried  on in public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is a chaperon you are thinking about, I&rsquo;ll  take care of you,&rdquo; urged good Mrs. Crowther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t on that account. Mrs. Baynham offered  to take me in her party. But I really would much rather not be there. It would  seem horrid to me to be dancing in a great, dazzling room, among happy people,  while Martin is in Burmah, perhaps in peril of his life on that very night. One  can never tell. I often shudder at the thought of what may be happening to him  while I am sitting quietly by the fire. And what should I feel at a ball?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should hardly have expected you to have such  romantic notions about Major Disney,&rdquo; said Belinda, coolly, &ldquo;considering the  difference in your ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I care the less for him because he  is twenty years older than I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty! Is it really as much as that?&rdquo; ejaculated  Mrs. Crowther, unaffectedly shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is just as dear to me,&rdquo; pursued Isola, warmly.  &ldquo;I look up to him, and love him with all my heart. There never was a better,  truer man. From the time I began to read history I always admired great  soldiers. I don&rsquo;t mean to say that Martin is a hero &mdash; only I know he is a  thorough soldier &mdash; and he seemed to realize all my childish dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had spoken impetuously, fancying that there was  some slight towards her absent husband in Miss Crowther&rsquo;s speech. Her flash of  anger made a break in the conversation, and nothing more was said about her  going or not going to the Hunt Ball. They talked of that entertainment in the  abstract &mdash; discussed the floor &mdash; the lighting &mdash; the band &mdash; and the great people  who might be induced to appear, if the proper pressure were put upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is plenty of time,&rdquo; said Lostwithiel,  &ldquo;between now and the twenty-second of December &mdash; nearly three weeks. Time for  you and your sister to get new frocks from London or Paris, Miss Crowther. You  mean having new frocks, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One generally does have a new frock for a dance,&rdquo;  replied Belinda, &ldquo;though the fashions this winter are so completely odious that  I would much rather appear in a gown of my great-grandmother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lostwithiel smiled his slow secret smile high up in  the fainter firelight. He was reflecting upon his notion of Miss Crowther&rsquo;s  great-grandmother, in linsey-wolsey, with a lavender print apron, a costume  that would be hardly impressive at a Hunt Ball. He did not give the young lady credit  for a great-grandmother from the Society point of view. There was the mother  yonder &mdash; inoffensive respectability &mdash; the grandmother would be humbler &mdash; and  the great-grandmother he imagined at the wash-tub, or cooking the noontide meal  for an artisan husband. He had never yet realized the idea of numerous  generations of middle-class life upon the same plane, the same dead level of  prosperous commerce.</p>
<p>Isola rose to take leave, after having let her tea  get cold, and dropped half her cake on the Persian rug. She felt shyer in that  house than in any other. She had a feeling that there she was weighed in the  balance and found wanting; that unfriendly eyes were scrutinizing her gloves  and hat, and appraising her features and complexion. She felt herself insignificant,  colourless, insipid beside that brilliant Miss Crowther, with her vivid beauty,  and her self-assured airs and graces.</p>
<p>Tabitha urged her to be of good heart when she  hinted at these feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Lord have mercy upon us, ma&rsquo;am, however grand  they may all look, it&rsquo;s nothing but wool &mdash; only wool; and I heard there used to  be a good deal of devil&rsquo;s dust mixed with it, after this Mr. Crowther came into  the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dusk was thickening as she went along the short  avenue which led to the gates. Mr. Crowther, having built his house in a wood,  had been able to cut himself out a carriage drive, which gave him an avenue of  more than two centuries&rsquo; growth, and thus imparted an air of spurious antiquity  to his demesne. He felt, as he looked at the massive boles of those old Spanish  chestnuts, as if he had belonged to the soil since the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Even the lodge was an important building, Tudor on  one side, and monastic on the other; with that agreeable hodge-podge of styles  which the modern architect loveth. It was a better house than the curate lived  in, as he often told Miss Crowther.</p>
<p>Isola quickened her pace outside that solemn  gateway, and seemed to breathe more freely. She hurried even faster at the  sound of a footstep behind her, though there was no need for nervous  apprehensions at that early hour in the November evening on the high road  between Fowey and Trelasco. Did she know that firm, quick footfall; or was it  an instinctive avoidance of an unknown danger which made her hurry on till her  heart began to beat stormily, and her breath came in short gasps?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Disney, do you usually walk as if for  a wager?&rdquo; asked a voice behind her. &ldquo;I can generally get over the ground pretty  fast, but it was as much as I could do to overtake you without running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not breathless, however. His tones were firm  and tranquil. It was she who could scarcely speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I am very late,&rdquo; she answered  nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what? For afternoon tea by your own fireside?  Have you anybody waiting for you at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest, that you should be in  such a hurry to get home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is no one waiting, except Tabitha. I  expect no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why walk yourself into a fever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tabitha gets fidgety if I am out after dusk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let Tabitha fidget! It will be good for her  liver. Those adipose people require small worries to keep them in health. You  mustn&rsquo;t over-pace yourself to oblige Tabitha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had slackened her steps, and he was walking by  her side, looking down at her from that superb altitude which gave him an  unfair advantage. How could she, upon her lower level, escape those searching  glances?</p>
<p>She knew that her way home was his way home, so far  as the bend of the road which led away from the river; and to avoid him for the  intervening distance would have been difficult. She must submit to his company  on the road, or make a greater effort than it was in her nature to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to go to this ball, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked  earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but pray do! Why should you shut yourself from  all the pleasures of this world, and live like a nun, always? You might surely  make just one exception for such a grand event as the Hunt Ball. You have no  idea how much we all think of it hereabouts. Remember, it will be the first  public dance we have had at Lostwithiel for ever so many years. You will see  family diamonds enough to make you fancy you are at St. James&rsquo;s. Do you think  Major Disney would dislike your having just one evening&rsquo;s dissipation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, he would not mind! He is only too kind and  indulgent. He would have liked me to spend the winter with my sister in Hans  Place, where there would have been gaieties of all kinds; but I don&rsquo;t want to  go into society while Martin is away. It would not make me happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if it made some one else happy &mdash; if it made  other people happy to see you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it would not matter to anybody! I am a  stranger in the land. People are only kind to me for my husband&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your modesty becomes you as the dew becomes a  rose. I won&rsquo;t gainsay you &mdash; only be sure you will be missed if you don&rsquo;t go to  the ball. And if you do go &mdash; well, it will be an opportunity of making nice  friends. It will be your <em>d&eacute;but</em> in  county society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without my husband? Please don&rsquo;t say any more  about it, Lord Lostwithiel. I had much rather stay at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He changed the conversation instantly, asking her  what she thought of Glenaveril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the situation most lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there we are all agreed. Mr. Crowther had the  good taste to find a charming site, and the bad taste to erect an architectural  monstrosity, a chimera in red brick. There was a grange once in the heart of  that wood, and the Crowthers have the advantage of acorns and chestnuts that  sowed themselves while the sleepy old monks were telling their beads. How do  you like Miss Crowther?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know her well enough to like or dislike  her. She is very handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was Rubens&rsquo; wife, Helena Forman; but what would  one do in a world peopled with Helena Formans? There are galleries in Antwerp  which no man should enter without smoke-coloured spectacles, if he would avoid  being blinded by a blaze of red-haired beauty. I am told that the Miss  Crowthers will have, at least, a million of money between them in days to come,  and that they are destined to make great matches. Perhaps we shall see some of  their <em>soupirants</em> at the ball. Since  the decay of the landed interest, the <em>chasse  aux dots</em> has become fiercer than of old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to come strangely from him who had  already been talked of as a possible candidate for one of the Miss Crowthers.  It would be such a particularly suitable match, Mrs. Baynham, the doctor&rsquo;s  wife, had told Isola. What could his lordship look for beyond a fine fortune  and a handsome wife?</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would make such a splendid pair,&rdquo; said Mrs.  Baynham, talking of them as if they were carriage-horses.</p>
<p>Mrs. Disney and her companion crossed a narrow  meadow, from the high road to the river-path which was the nearest way to the  Angler&rsquo;s Nest. The river went rippling by under the gathering grey of the  November evening. On their right hand there was the gloom of dark woods: and  from the meadow on their left rose a thick white mist, like a sea that  threatened to swallow them up in its phantasmal tide. The sound of distant  oars, dipping with rhythmical measure, was the only sound except their own  voices.</p>
<p>Did that three-quarters of a mile seem longer or  shorter than usual? Isola hardly knew; but when she saw the lights shining in  Tabitha&rsquo;s kitchen, and the fire-glow in the drawing-room, she was glad with the  gladness of one who escapes from some fancied danger of ghosts or goblins.</p>
<p>Lostwithiel detained her at the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;good night. You will change  your mind, won&rsquo;t you, Mrs. Disney? It is not in one so gentle as you to be  inflexible about such a trifle. Say that you will honour our ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew herself up a little, as if in protest  against his pertinacity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really cannot understand why you should care  whether I go or stay away,&rdquo; she said coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I do care! It is childish, perhaps, on my  part, but I do care; I care tremendously; more than I have cared about anything  for a long time. It is so small a thing on your part &mdash; it means so much for me!  Say you will be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked Tabitha&rsquo;s pleasant  voice, while Tabitha&rsquo;s substantial soles made themselves audible upon the  gravel path. &ldquo;I was beginning to get fidgety about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said Isola, shortly, as she passed  through the gate.</p>
<p>It shut with a sharp little click of the latch, and  she vanished among the laurels and arbutus. He heard her voice and Tabitha&rsquo;s as  they walked towards the house in friendly conversation, mistress and maid.</p>
<p>There was a great over-blown Dijon rose nodding its  heavy head over the fence. Roses linger so late in that soft western air.  Lostwithiel plucked the flower, and pulled off its petals one by one as he  walked towards the village street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she go &mdash; will she stay &mdash; go &mdash; stay &mdash; go &mdash;  stay?&rdquo; he muttered, as the petals fluttered to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go! Yes, of course she will go,&rdquo; he said to  himself as the last leaf fell. &ldquo;Does it need ghost from the grave or rose from  the garden to tell me that?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  &ldquo;Dreaming, She Knew It Was A Dream&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Isola and Lostwithiel met a good many times after  that walk through the autumn mists. She tried her utmost to avoid him. She went  for fewer walks than of old; nay, she chiefly confined her perambulations to  those domestic errands which Tabitha imposed upon her, and such afternoon  visits as she felt it incumbent upon her to pay, in strict return for visits  paid to her. Major Disney had begged her to be exact in such small ceremonies,  and to keep upon the best possible terms with his friends. &ldquo;I love every soul  in the place, for old sake&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he told her; and for old sake&rsquo;s sake Isola  had to cultivate the people her husband had known all his life.</p>
<p>She tried to avoid Lostwithiel, but Fate was  against her, and they met. He was unvaryingly courteous. He said no word which  could offend the most sensitive of women. Prudery itself could have had no  ground for alarm. He did not again allude to the ball, or his wishes upon that  point. He talked of those common topics of interest to which every day and  every season give rise, even in a Cornish village; and yet in this common talk  acquaintance ripened until it became friendship unawares. And then &mdash; as all  sense of shyness and reserve upon Isola&rsquo;s part gave way to a vague, reposeful  feeling, like drifting down a sunlit river, with never a breath of chilling  wind &mdash; they began to exchange confidences about their past lives. Unawares Martin  Disney&rsquo;s wife found herself entering into the minutest details about the people  she had met on that level road of a monotonous girlhood by which she had come  to be what she was. Unawares she betrayed all her feelings and opinions, her  likes and dislikes, and even the little weaknesses and eccentricities of her  parents &mdash; her sister &mdash; her wealthy brother-in-law. Never before had she found  so good a listener. Her husband had been all affectionate interest in the  things that concerned her; yet she had often discovered that his mind was  wandering in the midst of some girlish reminiscence; and he had a tiresome  trick of forgetting all those particulars about her friends which would have  enabled him to distinguish the personages of a story. He had to be told everything  afresh at each recurrence of those names that were so familiar to her. Nor had  he Lostwithiel&rsquo;s keen sense of humour, and quick perception of the ridiculous  side of life, whereby many a small social sketch fell flat.</p>
<p>The glimpses she caught of her new friend&rsquo;s past  existence enthralled her. It was to see new vistas opening into unknown worlds;  the world of university life; the world of society, English and continental,  with all its varieties of jargon; the world of politics, and literature, and art.  It charmed him to see her interest in all those unknown things and people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would very soon be tired of it, and would come  back to Trelasco &mdash; like the hare to her form &mdash; or like me,&rdquo; he said, smiling at  her ardent look. &ldquo;Believe me, it is all dust and ashes. My happiest hours have  been on board a yacht, with only half a dozen good books, and ten or a dozen  ignoramuses in blue serge for my companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was to go to the Hunt Ball after all; not  because he wished it, but because other people had taken her affairs in hand,  and decided that she should go. Dr. and Mrs. Baynham had decided for her. Mrs.  Vansittart Crowther had decided for her, and had sent her a ticket with her  love by that very footman whose appearance when he opened the door always crushed  her, and who had given her a frightful shock when she danced into the kitchen  to speak to Tabitha, and found him meekly sitting on a Windsor chair, with his  knees drawn up nearly to his chin. Lastly, Tabitha had decided; and Tabitha&rsquo;s  opinion went for more than that of anybody else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want a little bit of change and gaiety,&rdquo; said  the faithful stewardess. &ldquo;You have been looking pale and worried ever since you  had that bad news from Broomer,&rdquo; this was Tabitha&rsquo;s nearest approach to Burmah,  &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll be all the better for an evening&rsquo;s pleasure. It isn&rsquo;t as if you had  to buy a dress, or even a pair of gloves. You&rsquo;ve only worn your wedding-dress  at three parties since you came home from your honeymoon, and it&rsquo;s as fresh as  if you&rsquo;d been married yesterday. You&rsquo;ve got everything, and everything of the  best. Why shouldn&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola could advance no reason, except her vague  fear that her husband might not approve of her appearing at a public ball  without him; but at this objection honest Tabitha snapped her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer for Mr. Martin,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be  pleased for you to enjoy yourself. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let her mope while I&rsquo;m away, Tabby,&rsquo;  he said to me the day before he started for foreign parts. He&rsquo;d like you to be  at the ball. You&rsquo;ll have Mrs. Baynham to take care of you, and what can you  want more than that, I should like to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Baynham, the portly doctor&rsquo;s wife, was, in  Tabitha&rsquo;s mind, the representative of all the respectabilities. How could a  girl just out of her teens &mdash; a girl who loved dancing, and had been told she  danced exquisitely &mdash; turn a deaf ear to such arguments, put forward by the  person to whose care her husband had in some wise confided her. If Tabitha  approved, Isola thought she could not do wrong in yielding; so the simply-fashioned  white satin gown &mdash; made in Paris, and with all Parisian <em>chic</em> &mdash; was taken out of the pot-pourri perfumed drawer. Gloves and  fan, and little white slippers were passed in review. There was nothing wanted.  The carefullest housewife need not have hesitated on the score of economy.</p>
<p>So the question was finally settled &mdash; she was to go  to the Hunt Ball. A fly was engaged for her especial service, so that she might  not crowd Mrs. Baynham, who was to take two fresh, fat-cheeked nieces, who  looked as if they had been fed from infancy upwards upon apple pasties and  clotted cream. She was to drive to Lostwithiel in the fly from the Maypole Inn,  and she was to join Mrs. Baynham in the cloak-room, and make her entrance under  that lady&rsquo;s wing.</p>
<p>This final decision was arrived at about ten days  before the event, and for nine of those intervening days Isola&rsquo;s life went by  as if she were always sitting in that imaginary boat drifting down a sunlit  river; but on the day of the dance, after just half an hour&rsquo;s quiet walk with  Lostwithiel on the towpath, she went back to the cottage pale as ashes; and sat  down at her little davenport in the drawing-room, trembling, breathless, and on  the verge of hysteria.</p>
<p>She opened the drawers of the davenport one after  another, looking for something &mdash; helplessly, confusedly, as one whose brain is  half distraught. It was ten minutes before she found what she wanted &mdash; a sheaf  of telegram forms.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;To Major Disney, Cornwall Fusiliers, Rangoon. &mdash;  Let me go to you at once. I am miserable. My heart will break if you leave me  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the gist of a message which she wrote half  a dozen times, in different words, upon half a dozen forms. Then she tore up  all but the last, threw that into a drawer, and began to pace the room  feverishly, with her hands clasped before her face.</p>
<p>What fever-fraught vision was it that those hands  tried to shut out from her burning eyes? So little had happened &mdash; so little &mdash;  only half an hour&rsquo;s quiet walk along the towpath, where the leafless willows  had a grim, uncanny look, like those trees whose old grey branches seemed the  arms of the Erlking&rsquo;s daughters, beckoning the child as he nestled in his  father&rsquo;s arms, riding through the night. So little &mdash; so little &mdash; and yet it  meant the lifting of a veil &mdash; the passage from happy innocence to the full  consciousness of an unholy love. It meant what one kiss on trembling lips meant  for Paolo and Francesca. It meant the plunge into a gulf of dark despair &mdash;  unless she had strength to draw back, seeing the abyss at her feet, warned of  her danger.</p>
<p>What had he said? Only a few agitated words &mdash; only  a revelation. He loved her, loved her with all the passion of his passionate  soul; loved her as he had never loved before. They all tell the same story,  these destroyers of innocence; and, for that one burning moment, they all mean  what they say. Every seducer has his hour of sublime truthfulness; of generous  feeling; of ardent heroic aspirations; the hour in which he would perish for  the woman he loves; cut off his right hand; burn out his eyes; leap off a  monument; do anything except surrender her, except forego his privilege to  destroy her.</p>
<p>It was not too late. The warning had come in time &mdash;  just in time to save her. She knew now to what ocean that drifting boat was  carrying her &mdash; through the sunny atmosphere, between the flowery shores of  dreamland. It was taking her to the arctic ocean of shame and ruin &mdash; the great  sea strewn with the corpses of women who had sinned, and suffered, and  repented, and died &mdash; unforgiven of mankind &mdash; to wait the tribunal of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, lor!&rdquo; cried Tabitha, bursting into the room.  &ldquo;I thought you were never coming home. You ought to go and lay down for two or  three hours after your tea, or we shall have you fainting away before the  night&rsquo;s over. You&rsquo;ve not been eating enough for a healthy canary bird for the  last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very well, Tabbie. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll go  to the ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not go! and when the fly&rsquo;s ordered &mdash; and will have  to be paid for whether or no; for Masters told me he could have let it twelve  deep. Not go! and disappoint Mrs. Baynham, who has set her heart on taking you;  and Mrs. Crowther, who gave you the ticket! Why, it would never do! You&rsquo;ll feel  well enough when you&rsquo;re there. You won&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re standing on your  head or your heels. It&rsquo;s past five o&rsquo;clock, and your tea has been ready in the  study since a quarter to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you send telegrams to India, Tabitha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor, ma&rsquo;am, how should I know? From the  post-office, I suppose, pretty much like other telegrams. But they cost no end  of money, I&rsquo;ll be bound. You&rsquo;re not wanting to send a telegram to the major,  are you, ma&rsquo;am, to ask his leave about the ball?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I was only wondering,&rdquo; Isola answered feebly.</p>
<p>She shut and locked the davenport, leaving her  message in the drawer. She meant to send it &mdash; if not to-day, to-morrow; if not  before the ball, after the ball. She felt that her only hope of peace and  safety and a clear conscience was at her husband&rsquo;s side. She must go out to him  yonder in the unknown land. She must get to him somehow, with or without his  leave &mdash; with or without his help. She would brave anything, hazard anything to  be with that faithful friend and defender &mdash; her first love &mdash; her brave,  self-denying, God-fearing lover. She felt as if there were no other safety or  shelter for her in all the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God will not help me unless I help myself,&rdquo; she  muttered distractedly, as she sat in her low chair by the fire, with her head  flung back upon the cushions and the untouched meal at her side. Tabitha had  left off providing dinner for her, at her particular request. She had neither  heart to sit down alone to a formal dinner nor appetite to eat it; so Tabitha  had exercised all her skill as a cook, which was great, in preparing a dainty  little supper at nine o&rsquo;clock; and it had irked her that her mistress did such  scant justice to the tempting meal.</p>
<p>Isola fell asleep by the fire, comforted by the  warmth, worn out by nights that had been made sleepless by vague agitation &mdash; by  the living over again of accidental meetings, and friendly conversations &mdash; not  by fear or remorse &mdash; for it was only this day that the danger of that growing  friendship had been revealed to her. It was only to-day that she knew what such  friendships mean. She slept a feverish sleep, from sheer exhaustion, and dreamt  fever-dreams.</p>
<p>Those willows on the bank had recalled Goethe&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Erl K&ouml;nig&rdquo; &mdash; the ballad she had learnt by rote in her earliest German studies  &mdash; and the willows and the ballad were interwoven with her dreams. It was Martin  Disney who was riding his charger along a dark road, and she was sitting in  front of his saddle, clinging to him, hiding her face upon his breast, and the  willows were beckoning &mdash; she knew those gaunt arms were beckoning to her,  although her eyes were hidden &mdash; and <em>he</em> was following. He was thundering behind them, on a black horse. Yes, and then  the dream changed &mdash; the dreamer&rsquo;s wandering thoughts directed by another  reminiscence of those girlish studies in German poetry. She was Lenore, and she  was in the arms of her dead lover. She felt that bony arm &mdash; Death&rsquo;s arm &mdash;  clutching her round the waist. Her streaming hair mingled with the streaming  mane of that unearthly horse. She was with Lostwithiel &mdash; in his arms &mdash; and they  were both dead and both happy &mdash; happy in being together. What did they want  more than that?</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Vollbracht, vollbracht ist unser Lauf!<br>
  Das Hochzeitbette, thut sich auf!<br>
  Die Todten reiten schnelle!<br>
Wir sind, wir sind, zur Stelle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She woke with the chill of the charnel-house  freezing her blood. The fire had gone out. Tim had curled himself at her feet  in the folds of her gown. The Persian was staring discontentedly at the ashes  in the grate, and Tabitha&rsquo;s sturdy footsteps might be heard in the room above,  bustling to and fro, and anon poking the fire, and putting on coals, making all  snug and ready for her mistress&rsquo;s toilet.</p>
<p>Isola rang, and Susan, the parlour-maid, brought in  the lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came twice before, ma&rsquo;am; but you were fast  asleep, so I took the lamp back to the pantry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola looked at the clock. Ten minutes to nine, and  she was to meet Mrs. Baynham in the cloak-room at half-past ten. Ten o&rsquo;clock  was the hour on the card, and the fat-faced nieces were feverishly afraid that  all the eligible partners would be snapped up by those wise virgins who  appeared earliest on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t keep us waiting in the cloak-room, will  you, dear Mrs. Disney?&rdquo; they pleaded coaxingly.</p>
<p>Was she to put on her finery and go! There would be  time yet to send a note to Mrs. Baynham, excusing herself on the score of  illness. The doctor&rsquo;s party would not start before half-past nine. What was she  to do? Oh, she wanted to see him once more &mdash; just once more &mdash; in the  brightly-lighted rooms, amidst a crowd &mdash; in a place where he would have no  chance of repeating those wicked, wicked words &mdash; of forgetting all that was due  to his own honour and to hers. In the crowded ball-room there would be safety &mdash;  safety even from evil thoughts. Who could think of anything amidst the sound of  dance music, the dazzle of lamps and flashing of jewels?</p>
<p>She wanted to go to the ball, to wear her satin  gown, to steep herself in light and music; and thus to escape from the dim  horrors of that awful dream.</p>
<p>Tabitha seemed like a good angel, when she came in  at this juncture with a fresh cup of tea and a plate of dainty little chicken  sandwiches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, ma&rsquo;am, I shan&rsquo;t let you go to the ball  if you don&rsquo;t take these. What, not a bit of fire &mdash; and you asleep here in the  cold? What was that addle-pated Susan thinking about, I wonder? I&rsquo;ll take the  tray upstairs. There&rsquo;s a lovely fire in your room, and everything ready for you  to dress. I want to be able to tell Mr. Martin that his young wife was the  belle of the ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola allowed herself to be led upstairs to the  bright, cheerful bedroom, with its pretty chintz-pattern paper, and  photographs, and artistic muslin curtains, and glowing fire, and toilet-table,  with its glitter of crystal and silver in the pleasant candlelight. She  suffered herself to be fed and dressed by Tabitha&rsquo;s skilful hands, almost as if  she had been a child; and she came out of her dismal dream into the glad waking  world, a radiant figure, with violet eyes and alabaster complexion, flushed by  the loveliest hectic. The simply-made, close-fitting bodice, with folded crape  veiling the delicate bust, and the pure pearly tint of the satin, set off her  fragile beauty, while the long train and massive folds of the rich fabric gave  statuesque grace to her tall, slim figure; but the crowning glory of her  toilette was the garland of white chrysanthemums, for which Tabitha had  ransacked all the neighbouring green-houses; a garland of fluffy, feathery  petals, which reached in a diagonal line from her shoulder to the hem of her  gown. It was her only ornament, for by some strange caprice she refused to wear  the modest pearl necklace and diamond cross which had been her husband&rsquo;s  wedding gift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night, Tabbie,&rdquo; she said; and Tabitha saw  in this refusal only the coquetry of a lovely woman, who wanted to show the  great ladies and squire&rsquo;s wives how poor and common diamonds are by the side of  youth and beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t want any jewels, certainly,&rdquo; said  Tabitha. &ldquo;You look as if you were going to be married &mdash; all but the veil. Those  chrysanthemums are ever so much prettier than orange blossoms. There&rsquo;s the fly.  Let me put on your cloak. It&rsquo;s a beautiful night, and almost as mild as May.  Everybody will be at the ball. There&rsquo;s nothing to keep folks away. Well, I do  wish the major was here to go with you. Wouldn&rsquo;t he be proud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stars were shining when Isola went along the  gravel path to the gate where Masters&rsquo; fly was waiting, with blazing lamps,  which seemed to put those luminous worlds yonder to shame. There was no  carriage-drive to the hall door of the Angler&rsquo;s Nest. The house retained all  its ancient simplicity, and ignored the necessities of carriage people. Tabitha  wrapped her mistress&rsquo;s fur-lined cloak close round her, before she stepped into  the fly, which was provided with those elaborate steps that seem peculiar to  the hired brougham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Tabitha, and thank you for all the  pains you&rsquo;ve taken in dressing me &mdash; and for the lovely wreath. I shall come  home early. I shan&rsquo;t wait for Mrs. Baynham&rsquo;s party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hurry,&rdquo; said Tabitha, heartily. &ldquo;The  Hunt Ball only comes once a year, and you&rsquo;d better make the most of it. I  shan&rsquo;t mind sitting up; and perhaps I shan&rsquo;t be half so dull as you think for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flyman shut the door, which nobody but himself  could shut &mdash; another peculiarity of hired broughams. The fly vanished in the  darkness, and Tabitha ran back to the house, where she found Susan waiting at  the hall door in her jacket and hat, as near a reproduction of Mrs. Disney&rsquo;s  jacket and hat as local circumstances &mdash; or the difference between Bond Street  and Lostwithiel &mdash; would allow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you locked and bolted the back doors?&rdquo; asked  Tabitha; &ldquo;but, lor, I&rsquo;ll go and look myself; I won&rsquo;t trust to your giddy young  brains. Mr. Tinkerly will be here with the cart directly. I&rsquo;ve only got to put  on my bonnet and dolman, after I&rsquo;ve taken a look round, and put away Mrs.  Disney&rsquo;s jewel-box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabitha was no light-minded housekeeper, but she  had her hours of frivolity, and she loved pleasure with the innocent freshness  of a most transparent soul. Tinkerly, the butcher, had offered to drive the two  ladies &mdash; Tabitha and Susan &mdash; into Lostwithiel in his tax cart, and,  furthermore, to place them where they would see something of the ball, or at  least of the company arriving and departing, and beyond all this to give them a  snack of supper, &ldquo;Just something to bite at and a glass of beer,&rdquo; he told  Tabitha deprecatingly, lest he should raise hopes beyond his power of  realization.</p>
<p>He meant to do the thing as handsomely as  circumstances would permit, certainly to the extent of cold boiled beef and  pickles, with Guinness or Bass. He was a family man, of irreproachable  respectability, and his meat was supposed to be unmatchable for thirty miles  round. He grew it himself, upon those picturesque pastures which sloped  skyward, dipping towards the blue of the river, rising towards the blue of the  sky.</p>
<p>No precaution of lock, bolt, or bar did Tabitha  neglect before she put on her best bonnet, and dignified black cloth dolman,  heavy with imitation Astrachan. She and Susan were standing at the gate when  Tinkerly drove up with his skittish mare and spring cart, a cart so springy  that it threatened to heel over altogether when Tabitha clambered into the  place of honour. Mr. Tinkerly&rsquo;s foreman was sitting behind to take care of  Susan, and the foreman was unmarried, and of a greasy black-haired comeliness,  and there was none happier than Susan under those wintry stars &mdash; not even the  great ladies in their family diamonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are diamonds,&rdquo; said Susan, philosophically,  with the foreman&rsquo;s arm sustaining her at a sharp turn in the road, &ldquo;if you  don&rsquo;t care for each other?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  &ldquo;And The Child-Cheek Blushing Scarlet For The Very Shame Of Bliss&rdquo;</h2>
<p>People who were familiar with the Talbot Hotel,  Lostwithiel, in its everyday aspect would hardly have recognized the  old-fashioned hostelry to-night, under the transforming hand of the Hunt Club,  with Lord Lostwithiel and Vansittart Crowther on the committee. The entrance  hall, usually remarkable only for various cases of stuffed birds, and a monster  salmon &mdash; caught in the Lerrin river in some remote period of history &mdash; was now  a bower of crimson cloth and white azaleas. In the ball-room and ante-room,  tea-room and supper-room, were more flowers, and more crimson cloth, while on  every side brushes and vizards against the crimson and white panelling  testified to the occasion. The dancing-room was very full when Mrs. Baynham&rsquo;s  party made their entrance, the matron in her historical black velvet &mdash; which  had formed part of her trousseau thirteen years before, when she left the  family residence in the chief street of Truro, and all those privileges which  appertained to her as the only daughter of a provincial banker, to grace Dr.  Baynham&rsquo;s lowlier dwelling. The black velvet gown had been &ldquo;let out&rdquo; from time  to time, as youth expanded into maturity: and there had been a new bodice and a  real Maltese lace flounce within the last three years, which constituted a  second incarnation; and Mrs. Baynham walked into the Talbot ball-room with the  serene demeanour that goes with a contented mind. She was satisfied with  herself, and she was proud of her party, the two fresh, rosy-cheeked girls in  sky-blue tulle, Isola, looking like a Mary lily in her white satin raiment, and  the village surgeon, who always looked his best in his dress clothes,  newly-shaven, and, as it were, pulled together in honour of the occasion.</p>
<p>The room was full, and very full; but Lostwithiel  was not there. Isola had an instinctive consciousness that he was missing in  that brilliant crowd. People came buzzing round her, and she was made room for  upon a raised bench opposite the gallery where a military band was playing a  polka in which the brasses predominated to an ear-splitting extent.</p>
<p>The Glenaveril party made their entrance ten  minutes later. The Crowther girls were not afraid of wanting partners. Most  young men are glad to dance with half a million of money. There is always an  off chance of a good thing, just as there is a chance of breaking the bank at  Monte Carlo. Belinda looked superb in a cloud of tulle, like a goddess. Alicia  looked too well on horseback to look well off. Her spare straight figure and  sharp elbows were not at their best in evening dress. She wore black, and an  infinity of bugles, and flashed and glittered more than any one else in the  room, though she wore never a jewel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worth, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Baynham to a blue  niece, in a mysterious whisper; &ldquo;I know his style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a buzz of conversation on that raised  divan where the matrons were sitting with those newly arrived maidens who were  like ships waiting to slide out of their cradles and float away to sea. Isola  and the sky-blue nieces had not long to wait; especially Isola. Men were  entreating the stewards to introduce them to that lovely fragile-looking  creature in white satin &mdash; the best men in the neighbourhood, or those wandering  stars from distant counties, or the London galaxy, &ldquo;men with handles to their  names,&rdquo; as Mr. Baynham told Mrs. Crowther, resplendent in salmon brocade, and  Venetian point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My presentation gown,&rdquo; she informed the doctor&rsquo;s  wife; &ldquo;the Court mantle is ruby velvet, lined with salmon satin. The weight of  it almost pulled me backwards when I curtsied to the royalties &mdash; such a lot of  them, and I&rsquo;m afraid I curtsied rather too low to one of the Princesses, for I  caught her taking me off when she returned my curtsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola danced through the lancers as one in a dream.  When the heart of a man is oppressed with care, &ldquo;Ta-rarra, ta-rarra, ta-r&agrave;,  ta-r&agrave;!&rdquo; What foolishness it all seemed. And her husband in Burmah, hemmed round  by murderous dacoits!</p>
<p>She went back to her seat among the matrons, after  almost curtly refusing either refreshment or a promenade through the rooms.  Mrs. Crowther was saying solemnly, &ldquo;I do believe Lord Lostwithiel is not coming  after all, and yet he worked so hard on the committee, my husband said, and  took such pains about the flowers, and what not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall, slim figure cut its way through the crowd  two or three minutes later, and Lostwithiel was standing in front of Isola, and  the two matrons.</p>
<p>He wore a pink coat, as became a member of the  Lostwithiel Hunt, and the vivid colour accentuated the pallor of his long thin  face. He talked to all the ladies on the divan; to the sky-blue nieces even,  hoping that their cards were full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If not, I must bring you some men I know,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t miss a dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They blushed and trembled with delight, never  before having been thus familiarly addressed by a peer of the realm. He asked  Isola for her programme, with well-simulated indifference, yet with that air of  profound respect with which he talked to all women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you can spare me some waltzes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is only just come,&rdquo; said Mrs. Baynham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet her card is almost full. People have been  very officious. Here is a poor little waltz &mdash; number seven. May I have that,  and number eleven, and number &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t put down your name for anything later  than number eleven. I shall be gone long before those late dances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, surely, you don&rsquo;t mean to desert us early.  Remember this is the one festive occasion of our lives as a sporting community.  All our other meetings are given up to carking care, financial difficulties,  and squabbling. I shall put down my name in these tempting blanks, and if you  disappoint me &mdash; well &mdash; it will only be like my previous experiences as a  fox-hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave her back her programme, with all the blanks  filled in, and at the bottom a word written, and triply underscored,</p>
<p align="center">&rsquo;&Alpha;&Nu;&Alpha;&Gamma;&Kappa;&Eta;.</p>
<p>They had talked of Victor Hugo&rsquo;s romantic story &mdash;  that romance which the great man so despised in after years that he was almost  offended if any one presumed to praise it in his hearing, although in the  half-century that has gone since Victor Hugo was a young man this story of  Notre Dame has been unsurpassed as an example of the romantic novel.  Lostwithiel had praised the book, and had talked of the monk Frollo, and his  fatal love &mdash; and that word Fatality, graven upon the wall of his cell, and burnt  into his soul.</p>
<p>Isola knew what those Greek letters meant. She  dropped the little white and gold programme as if it had been an adder. He went  away to a duty dance with a great lady of the district &mdash; a lady whose diamonds  made a light about her wherever she moved; and then he waltzed with Belinda  Crowther, to the admiration of the young lady&rsquo;s mother, and of two or three  other matrons on the divan by the door. Were they not a splendid couple, she so  brilliantly fair, he dark and pale, bronzed slightly with exposure to the sun  in warmer climates than this &mdash; not positively handsome, but with such an  interesting countenance. So, and so, and so prosed the matrons, until various  middle-aged cavaliers came to invite them to the tea-room, where there was the  usual drawback in the shape of a frightful draught from open windows, which the  dancers, coming in flushed and heated, voted delicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be a good night&rsquo;s work for me,&rdquo; said Dr.  Baynham, cheerfully, although he considered it his duty to warn his patients of  their danger.</p>
<p>Conscience thus satisfied, he could look on  complacently as they eat ices, and selected cool corners of the  refreshment-room to flirt in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next to a juvenile party, I don&rsquo;t know anything  better &mdash; from a professional point of view &mdash; than a public ball,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Your canvas corridors, decorated with flowers and bunting, are a fortune to a  family practitioner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola danced every dance. She hardly knew who her  partners were. She had only a sense of floating in a vortex of light and colour,  to some swinging melody. Everything was dream-like &mdash; but not horrible, as in  her dream by the fireside at home. This was a happy dream, as of a creature  with wings, who knew not of care in the present or a soul to be saved in the  future. And then came her waltz with Lostwithiel, and that strong arm was round  her, bearing her up as a flower is borne upon a rushing tide, so that she had  no consciousness of movement on her own part, only of floating, floating,  floating, to that languid three-time melody.</p>
<p>It was the last popular waltz they were playing &mdash; a  waltz that had been last summer&rsquo;s delight in the arid gardens of South  Kensington&mdash; &ldquo;Il n&rsquo;y a que toi;&rdquo; a waltz with a chorus which the band trolled  out merrily, at intervals, in the French of Stratford atte Bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Il n&rsquo;y a que toi,&rdquo; whispered Lostwithiel, with his  lips close to the soft brown hair above the white forehead. &ldquo;Not a bad name for  a waltz when one is waltzing with just one person in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out in the cool night there was a little knot of  people as merry after their homelier fashion as town and county in the  ball-room. One of the windows had been opened at the top for ventilation, and  this opening had been turned to advantage. A large, substantial kitchen table  had been placed in front of the window, and upon this improvised platform stood  Tabitha, Susan, the head chamber-maid, and the ostler&rsquo;s wife &mdash; this last on  sufferance, and evidently not in society &mdash; looking on at the ball. The window  was under a verandah, that sloped above these spectators&rsquo; heads. They were thus  in dense shadow, and unseen by the occupants of the lamp-lit room.</p>
<p>Susan was exuberant in her delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was never at a ball before,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh,  ain&rsquo;t it lovely? Don&rsquo;t I wish I could dance like that? Lor, do look at that fat  old party, spinning round like a teetotum! Well, I never did! Don&rsquo;t she  perspire!&rdquo; exclaimed Susan, indulging in a running commentary which left much  to be desired in the matter of refinement.</p>
<p>This unsophisticated damsel heartily admired youth  and beauty, and the smart frocks and flashing gems; but she was cruelly hard  upon those dancers whose charms were on the wane, or whose frocks were inferior  or ugly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go to a  ball like this if I couldn&rsquo;t have everythink nice. Look at that tall girl in  yeller. Did you ever see such a scarecrow? I&rsquo;d ever so much rather stay at  home, or stand outside, like this. I should feel it better became me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabitha made no such remarks. She was singularly  silent and thoughtful, as she stood looking down at the crowded room from her  point of vantage on the kitchen table. She had only eyes for one figure &mdash; the  willowy form in the glistening white satin gown, with the feathery Japanese  chrysanthemums, a little crushed and faded by this time; or perhaps it may be  said for two figures, since one followed the other as the shadow follows the  substance. She saw them waltzing together, when supper was in full progress,  and the room comparatively clear. She saw the graceful head inclining towards  his shoulder, the slender waist held in his firm embrace; and it seemed to her  that the waltz was an invention of the Arch Enemy. She thought of it very much  as people thought seventy years ago when Byron wrote his poetical denunciation  of the new dance. She saw those two moving slowly towards an adjacent  ante-room, where banks of flowers, and a couple of sofas and low easy-chairs  made a retreat which was half boudoir, half conservatory. She saw them moving  side by side, talking to each other in tones so confidential that his head bent  low over hers each time she spoke; and then she watched them sitting just  within the doorway, at an angle where she could see their faces, and attitudes,  still in the same confidential converse, she with downcast eyes, and he leaning  forward with his elbow on his knee, and looking up at her as he talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too bad of him,&rdquo; muttered Tabitha, writhing  at that spectacle. &ldquo;Does he think what a child she is, and what harm he may be  doing? It is wicked of him, and he knows it; and other people must notice them  &mdash; other people must see what I see &mdash; and they will be talking of her, blighting  her good name. Oh, if I could only get her away at once before people begin to  notice her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could see her young mistress&rsquo;s face distinctly  in the lamplight. Isola was very pale, and her face was full of trouble; not  the face of a woman amusing herself with an idle flirtation, playing with fire  without the least intention of burning her fingers. There were plenty of  flirtations of that order going on in the Talbot ball-room; but this was not  one of them. This meant peril of some kind. This was all evil. That pale face,  those heavy eyelids, shrouding eyes which dared not look up. That tremulous,  uncertain movement of the snowy ostrich fan! All these were danger signals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I get her safe at home presently, I&rsquo;ll open her  eyes for her,&rdquo; thought Tabitha. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to her as if I was her mother. God  knows I should be almost as sorry as ever her mother could be if she came to  any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she came to any harm. What harm was there to  fear for her, as she sat there, with Lostwithiel lounging across the low chair  beside the sofa where she sat, leaning forward to look into her downcast face?  What harm could come to her except that which meant destruction &mdash; death to  peace, and gladness, and womanly fame? If there were danger it was a desperate  danger, and Tabitha shuddered at the mere thought of that peril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, lor, she&rsquo;s little more than a child,&rdquo; mused  Tabitha. &ldquo;She means no wrong, and she knows no wrong. She&rsquo;s too innocent to  come to any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet in the landlady&rsquo;s snuggery, by-and-by, seated  at the comfortable round table, with its spotless damask and bright glass and  silver, Tabitha was quite unable to do justice to that snack which Mr. Tinkerly  had ordered in her honour &mdash; a chicken and lobster-salad from the supper-room,  and three parts of a pine-apple cream. Susan and the foreman fully appreciated  these dainties; but Tabitha only munched a crust and sipped a tumbler of beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little bit out of sorts to-night,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you haven&rsquo;t taken cold, Mrs. Thomas,&rdquo; said  the polite Tinkerly. &ldquo;Perhaps we ought to have brought another rug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t that. I&rsquo;ve been quite warm and  comfortable. Eat your supper, Mr. Tinkerly, and don&rsquo;t bother about me. I&rsquo;ve  been interested in looking on, and I&rsquo;m too much took up with what I&rsquo;ve seen to  be able to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a pretty sight,&rdquo; exclaimed Tinkerly,  enthusiastically; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw such a mort of plain women in  my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor, Mr. Tinkerly,&rdquo; cried Susan, with a shocked  air. &ldquo;Why, look at our young mistress, and at Miss Crowther, and Miss Spenthrop  from Truro, and Mrs. Pencarrow, and Lady Chanderville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;re all ugly. Some of &rsquo;em  are handsome enough, and there&rsquo;s plenty of thorough-breds among &rsquo;em, but  there&rsquo;s a sight of plain-headed ones. There&rsquo;s quite as much beauty in your  spear as there is among the county folks, Miss Susan. I&rsquo;ll answer for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was waning. Isola had ordered her  carriage for half-past two: but three o&rsquo;clock had struck from the church tower  of Lostwithiel, and the dance was still at its height &mdash; at its best, the  dancers said, now that the sensual attractions of the supper-room drew off a  good many people, and left the floor so much clearer than before supper, when  bulky middle-aged gentlemen, talking to the matrons seated upon the divan, had  projected their ponderous persons into the orbit of the waltzers.</p>
<p>Isola and Lostwithiel had danced only two waltzes,  but since two o&rsquo;clock they had sat out several dances, Mrs. Disney having  cancelled all her engagements after that hour by declaring that she would dance  no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am dreadfully tired,&rdquo; she told her partners  piteously, and her pallor gave force to the assertion. &ldquo;Please get some one else  for our dance, Captain Morshead,&rdquo; and so on, and so on, to half a dozen  disappointed suitors.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of those who happened to be  experienced in such complications may have divined which way the wind blew, for  no one offered to sit out the promised dances, and Isola and Lostwithiel were  left pretty much to themselves among the palms and orange-trees in the  ante-room. They were not unobserved, however; and among the eyes which marked  them with no friendly notice were the fine, steel-blue eyes of Miss Crowther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a flirtation?&rdquo; she asked Captain Morshead,  glancing in the direction of the ante-room where those two were sitting, as she  and Isola&rsquo;s cast-off partner waltzed past the muslin-draped doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem rather fond of talking to each other,  don&rsquo;t they? Who was she? She&rsquo;s uncommonly pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, her people were army, I believe &mdash; as poor as  church mice &mdash; buried alive in Dinan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Dinan &mdash; and now she lives at Trelasco, she  tells me. It seems scarcely worth while to have exhumed her in order to bury  her again. Such a girl as that ought to be in London enjoying life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but she&rsquo;s a grass widow, don&rsquo;t you know. Her  husband is in Burmah. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s quite nice in her to be here to-night;  only as my too good-natured mother sent her a ticket, I suppose I oughtn&rsquo;t to  say anything about it. Perhaps if mother sees the way she goes on with Lord  Lostwithiel she&rsquo;ll rather regret that ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was Lostwithiel saying all this time in that  gentle baritone, which was heard only by one listener? He was asking  forgiveness for his indiscretion of the afternoon, and in that prayer for  pardon was repeating his offence. Isola was less inclined to be angry, perhaps,  now. The magic of the dance was still upon her senses, the dance which had brought  them nearer than all the days they had met; than all their long confidential  conversations on the heights above the harbour, or on the river path, or  dawdling on the bridge. She had felt the beating of his heart against her own,  breath mingling with breath, the thrilling touch of his encircling arm; and it  was as if he had woven a spell around her which made her his. She had never  danced with her husband, who had no love of that heathenish art. In all their  brisk, frank courtship there had been no intoxicating hours. She hardly knew  what dancing meant till she waltzed with Lostwithiel, who had something of the  fiery ardour of a Pagan worshipping his gods in wild gyrations upon moonlit  mountain or in secret cave. She let him talk to her to-night &mdash; let him pour out  the full confession of his unhappy love. He spoke not as one who had hope; not  with that implied belief in her frailty which would have startled her into  prompt resistance. His accents were the accents of despair, his love was a dark  fatality.</p>
<p align="center">&rsquo;&Alpha;&Nu;&Alpha;&Gamma;&Kappa;&Eta;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you write that word?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Because I could not give you back that card  without some token of my passion &mdash; with only commonplace entries which Jones,  Brown, and Robinson might write there. I want you to feel that you belong to  me, somehow, in some way, as the spirits of the dead and the souls of the  living belong to each other sometimes, by links which none can see. When I am  at the other end of the earth I want to feel that there is something, if it  were only a word, like a masonic sign, between us; if it were only a promise  that in such or such a phase of the waning moon we would each look up and  breathe the other&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can I do? Can I stay? You tell me I made  you miserable by what I said this afternoon. That means we must meet no more. I  can&rsquo;t be sorry for my offence. I cannot answer for myself. My love has passed  the point of sanity and self-control. I have no option. I must offend you, or I  must leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not leave Trelasco,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;I  am going away to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going away! Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To London first, and then to India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Burmah? Impossible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If not to the front, to the nearest convenient  station. I am going to my husband; as nearly as I can reach him; and as quickly  as I can make the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have quite made up my mind. I hated to be  left behind last year; and now that his return is deferred my only chance of  happiness is to go to him. Some one called me a grass widow the other day. What  a detestable name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me this one waltz?&rdquo; he asked, without any  comment upon her intended journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible. I told them all I shouldn&rsquo;t dance any  more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, your partners are all in the supper-room, I  dare say. The dancing men go in last. Hark! it&rsquo;s the Myosotis. Just one turn &mdash;  only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had risen from his low seat, and she rose  involuntarily at the sound of the opening bars. He put his arm round her  gently, and drew her into the ball-room, waltzing slowly as they went, and  then, with the sudden impetus of an enthusiastic dancer, he was whirling her  round the room, and she know nothing, cared for nothing, in the confusion of  light and melody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of me sometimes when you are far away!&rdquo; he  whispered, with his lips almost touching her forehead.</p>
<p>She did not resent that whisper. Already, within a  dozen hours of his first offence, she had grown accustomed to his words of  love. It seemed to her as if they had loved each other for years &mdash; had loved  and had despaired long ago, in some dim half-remembered past. A passion of this  kind is like a dream, in which an instant gives the impression of half a  lifetime, of long memories and old habit.</p>
<p>The room was much clearer now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it very late?&rdquo; asked Isola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So late &mdash; and I told the flyman half-past two. It  is dreadful. Let us stop, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed, and went with her towards the  cloak-room. The seats were nearly empty now where the matrons had sat in their  velvet and brocade, a gorgeous background to the clouds of tulle and sylph-like  figures of the dancers. Mrs. Baynham was nowhere to be seen, and the diminished  bundles of tabby-cat cloaks and Shetland shawls in the cloak-room indicated  that a good many people had left. Isola put on her soft white shawl hurriedly,  and went out into the hall, where Lostwithiel had gone to look for her  carriage.</p>
<p>People were going away very fast, and through the  open doorway there was a sound of voices and wheels; but, in spite of footmen,  constables, and hangers-on, there seemed a prodigious difficulty in getting any  particular carriage to the door.</p>
<p>It was a mild, misty night, and the moon, which had  been counted on for the return home, was hidden behind a mass of black clouds &mdash;  or in the expressive phraseology of one of the foxhunters, had gone to ground.  Mrs. Disney waited near the door while Lostwithiel searched for her fly. There  were several departures of other muffled figures, features undistinguishable  behind Shetland wraps, or furry hoods, as the men hustled their womenkind into  the carriages. It seemed an age to Isola, waiting there alone in the corridor,  and seeing no mortal whom she knew among those passersby, before Lostwithiel  came, hurried and breathless, to say that her carriage was just coming up to  the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrap your shawl round your head,&rdquo; he said quickly,  as he gave her his arm. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a nasty damp fog &mdash; so,&rdquo; muffling her, almost  to blindness. &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at the carriage, with its lamps shining  red against the grey mistiness like great fiery eyes, and then, glancing at the  horse, she cried suddenly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s the wrong fly. I think mine had a  grey horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, it&rsquo;s all right. Pray don&rsquo;t loiter in this  chilling air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carriage door was open, the constable standing  by, bull&rsquo;s-eye in hand, a pair of horses snorting close behind, another  carriage coming up so near that the pole threatened destruction. There was no  time for loitering. Everybody was in a hurry to get home. Isola stepped lightly  into the brougham, which drove slowly off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next carriage, Mrs. Brune Prideaux,&rdquo; roared the  constable. &ldquo;Mrs. Prideaux&rsquo; carriage stops all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  &ldquo;A Love Still Burning Upward&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It was early summer, summer in her first youth,  when she is frivolous and capricious, laughs and weeps she knows not why;  smiling through her tears, and never knowing her own mind for a week together;  to-day gracious-tempered and tropical; to-morrow east-windy and morose. In a  word, it was June, a season of roses and rains, blue skies and thunder-clouds.  It was June, and Martin Disney was looking out of the window with a keen eager  face, much bronzed, and somewhat haggard, after a fatiguing campaign, looking  out across the vales and woods of his native county, as the Penzance train sped  along the high-level line betwixt Plymouth and Par. Those keen, grey eyes of  his, accustomed to searching out far-off objects, looked as if they could  pierce through the green heart of the Cornish valleys to the sheltered little  harbour of Fowey and the blue sea that opened wide to the far-off West.</p>
<p>His labours were over, and he was going to take his  rest, going to hang up his sword, that sword which had done such good work, or  to transform it into a reaping-hook. He was Colonel Disney now, had given the  State his best service, and now, in the very prime and vigour of his manhood,  the State had done with him, and he was free to do what he listed with the  maturer half of his life. He would have been very sorry to retire from active  service had it not been for that tender tie which gave such sweetness to the  thought of retirement and tranquil days. He was going home. The word thrilled  him like music; home to his fair young wife, his chosen one, his domestic  divinity. He had not left off wondering how it had ever come to pass that so  young and fair a creature could care for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as if I were one of your accomplished  fellows,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;able to sing, or play the flute, or paint in  water-colours. Except a very earnest love of a few good books, I have no  culture. How can any girl in the present day care for a man without culture? I  could never appreciate Keats, for instance; and not to appreciate Keats is to  be an outsider in literature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of his seven and forty years, in  spite of his deficiencies, his homeliness, that young heart had gone out to  him. She loved him, and his lot was full. There was nothing more upon God&rsquo;s  earth that he could desire, were it not a miracle, and that the mother he had  so fondly loved might be given back to him, to share his happiness, to make the  third in a trinity of trusting love. Since that could not be, there was nothing  left for him to yearn for.</p>
<p>The beating of his heart quickened almost  unbearably, as the train drew near Par. Isola would meet him at the Junction,  perhaps. He had not announced the actual hour of his arrival, for matters had  been a little uncertain when he wrote yesterday, and he had not cared to  telegraph this morning before he left Paddington. Yet she would know that this  was the only likely train for him to choose; and she would be at the Junction,  he thought, smiling her glad welcome, a fair young face, rosy in the sunset;  for it was evening as he drew near the end of his journey.</p>
<p>No; there was nobody he knew at the Junction. He  walked up and down the platform, and stared about him in rather a forlorn way  during the few minutes before the starting of the train for Fowey. She had not  come to anticipate their meeting by an hour or so, as he had hoped, as he had  felt almost certain, she would come.</p>
<p>It was more natural that she should wait and  receive him at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest, he told himself, sitting in the corner of the  railway carriage presently, in a train of three coaches, steaming through the  pretty picturesque country between Par and Fowey. In the colder light of reason  it seemed preposterous to have expected to see her at the Junction. She would  like to welcome him amidst her own surroundings, in the home to which she had  doubtless given those little beautifying touches in honour of his coming, which  are such delight to women, and which sometimes pass altogether unobserved by  that pachydermatous animal, man! How slowly the engine moved along that little  bit of line! Martin Disney sat with his face to the wind, and snuffed the sea  breeze as if it had been the odour of home. He thought of Ulysses, and his  return from distant lands. Would Tim, the fox terrier, know him? and Shah, the  Persian cat? Perhaps not. Tim was no Argus; vastly affectionate and  demonstrative, but not a dog to expire at one&rsquo;s feet, in the rapture of his  master&rsquo;s return. Penelope would know him, and welcome him. That was enough for  this modern Ulysses, who had no reason to disguise himself in re-entering his  home &mdash; who had no fear of rival suitors, or interlopers of any kind. Penelope  would welcome him, and trusty Tabitha. He thought of the old servant&rsquo;s honest  face with delight. She was something left to him out of boyhood and youth. He  felt like a young man when he talked to her. She was the one strong link  betwixt the present and the past. She was his memory embodied. He could refer to  her as to a dictionary of days long gone. When did we do such and such a thing  &mdash; or go to such a place? What was the name of the bay horse I bought at  Plympton? Where did my mother pick up the Sheraton secretaire? Tabitha could  answer all such trivial questions: and Tabitha could talk to him for hours of  his mother&rsquo;s words and ways &mdash; of the things that were only history.</p>
<p>At last! The train crept into the little station,  nestling on the edge of a wood, and there was Fowey, homely, friendly little  Fowey, so strange and yet so familiar; strange to eyes that had so lately  looked upon the cities of the East; familiar to the man who had been reared in  the neighbourhood, whose first impressions of God&rsquo;s earth had stamped harbour  and hills upon his brain, like an indelible picture. There was Masters&rsquo;s fly,  an eminently respectable vehicle that never touted for chance passengers,  waiting for him. He was expected, evidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mrs. Disney send you?&rdquo; he asked the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How thoughtful of the young wife, who might be  forgiven if she had left such a small duty unfulfilled. Yet he would have liked  to see her sweet self at the station &mdash; only, as he had argued with himself just  now, it would have discounted the home-welcome. It would have been an  anti-climax.</p>
<p>Dearly as he loved that home river, and those  fertile hills, and beautiful as they were after their kind, they could but seem  small and tame to eyes that had looked upon the glories of the East. Disney  contemplated the scene with a touch of sad surprise, wondering at this  miniature loveliness; recalling the day when those steep hillsides, where the  red cattle were grazing in the mists of eventide, had seemed grand in his  sight. Now they had a kind of pitiful prettiness. His heart yearned towards  them with compassion for their insignificance.</p>
<p>For nearly two years he had been moving about with  his company in the land of jungle and mountain, and in that vast table-land  through which the Salween river runs down to the Gulf of Martaban; and after  those wider horizons, he found himself in a narrow road, shut in by grassy  hills, and hugging the margin of a silver thread that called itself a river.</p>
<p>There is always a tinge of melancholy in that hour  after sundown; and Martin Disney&rsquo;s heart saddened a little as he looked at the  quiet river, and the shadows on the hillside &mdash; that pale mistiness of summer  evening which gives a ghostly touch to all things, as if it were a brief  revelation of a spirit world. It is an hour at which even a strong man&rsquo;s heart  is apt to sink with a vague sense of fear.</p>
<p>The fly drew up at the little wooden gate between  high hedges of escalonia, with glossy leaves and bright red blossom. A slender  figure in a white gown was visible on the threshold, as Disney sprang out of  the fly, and while the flyman was lifting down the luggage, that airy form  flitted across the lawn, and Colonel Disney&rsquo;s wife was standing shyly within  the open gate, almost as if she had come out to receive a stranger.</p>
<p>He could not clasp her to his breast before a  flyman; but he seized both her hands, gripped them convulsively, and then led  her towards the house, leaving Masters&rsquo;s man to deal as he pleased with  portmanteaux and hat-box, gun-case and umbrella-case, despatch-box, and other  chattels; to leave them out in the lane to the dews and the night-birds, if he  so listed. Martin Disney had no consciousness of anything in this world except  the woman by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling! my darling!&rdquo; he ejaculated, in a  choked voice, &ldquo;how I have longed for this hour, with a longing that has been  almost madness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he saw for the first time that her face  was as white as her gown. Was it the twilight that made her look so pale? Could  he wonder if the emotion of this supreme moment blanched that young cheek, when  he, soldier and wayfarer upon the world&rsquo;s roughest roads, felt like a child,  striving to hold back his tears?</p>
<p>Lamps were burning in dining-room and drawing-room.  He saw the table laid for dinner through the open door as he and Isola passed  by; but the idea of eating and drinking seemed very far off just now. They went  into the drawing-room together, where a solitary lamp was shining upon a table  crowded with flowers, and where the scents of the garden came in through the  open window. Here he satisfied the longing of his hungry heart, and took that  fragile form in his arms, and kissed the pale cold lips. She lay upon his  breast unresistingly; helpless, unresponsive, like a dead thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isola, have you forgotten that you once loved me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgotten! No, no, no! There is no one in the  world so good and true as you are. I love you with all my heart and soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face was hidden on his breast, but she lifted  up her arms and clasped them round his neck. He seated himself in his  accustomed chair &mdash; it was standing where it had always stood before he went  away &mdash; and took her upon his knee, as if she had been a child. Then a great  storm of sobs suddenly burst from throat and bosom, a flood of tears streamed  upon his breast, and he felt her arms trembling as they clasped his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own dear love,&rdquo; he murmured gently, &ldquo;one would  almost think you were sorry I have came back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not answer him at first for her sobs, but  she shook her head, and at last the words, &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; came from her lips;  and he kissed and calmed her with almost fatherly gentleness. And then they  went into the dining-room, where the soup-tureen was waiting for them on the  sideboard, with a neat little parlour-maid &mdash; not Susan, but another &mdash; ready to  minister to them.</p>
<p>The table had been decorated by Isola&rsquo;s own hands.  Dark crimson roses were lying on the fair white damask; one tall glass stood in  the centre with three slim golden lilies, pale and heavy-headed, which filled  the room with perfume. These came from one of the hothouses at Glenaveril,  whence good-natured Mrs. Crowther had sent a basket of exotics in honour of the  colonel&rsquo;s return. The lamplight, the flowers, the pretty old Wedgwood service  of creamy white and dull brown, made up a feast for Martin Disney&rsquo;s eye, after  a life spent mostly under canvas. He looked from the gaily adorned table to the  face beside him, pallid and pinched, despite its sweetness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear one, you are looking very ill,&rdquo; he said,  with an anxious air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an ungallant speech!&rdquo; she answered, smiling  at him with unexpected gaiety. &ldquo;I have been fretting at your long, long  absence, and you reproach me for my deteriorated appearance. Never mind,  Martin, you will see how rosy and bright I shall get now our parting has come  to an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, love, we must coax the roses back to your  cheeks. I must have a good mount ready for you when the cubbing begins, and a  few morning gallops will soon make a change in my fragile wife&rsquo;s appearance.  And I&rsquo;ll charter a yacht and steep you in ozone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one gets enough of that on shore, there is no  need to go further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you adored yachting? It was one of  our grand schemes for the future, to hire a modest little yawl and go round the  coast to Clovelly. Have you forgotten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; only I don&rsquo;t want you to waste your money  &mdash; and, if we start a bigger stable &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t know what a Cr&oelig;sus I have become.  You needn&rsquo;t be afraid of ruining me. My poor lonely little wife. Why didn&rsquo;t you  send for Allegra?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t have been of any good to me. She is  all that is sweet and lovable, and she is your sister; but she wouldn&rsquo;t have  filled your vacant place. I should have only felt lonelier for having to talk  every day, and pretend a kind of happiness. Being alone, I could bury myself in  a book, and forget my troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This soup doesn&rsquo;t look up to Tabitha&rsquo;s old form.  Do you know that among other delights of this earthly paradise I have been  looking forward to Tabitha&rsquo;s little dinners. I don&rsquo;t believe there is a <em>chef</em> in Paris who can cook so well as  that self-taught genius, who ripened into perfection by a process of gradual  evolution, from the early days when my mother discovered that nobody could make  arrowroot or cook a mutton cutlet as well as Tabitha. By-the-by, why has not  that good soul shown herself? I thought she would have disputed with you for my  first kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he ran on in this fashion, Isola sat looking  down at the table-cloth, pallid no longer, but crimson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tabitha has gone!&rdquo; she said abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tabitha gone &mdash; for a holiday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she has left me, altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left you &mdash; altogether?&rdquo; exclaimed Disney, with the  tone of a man who could scarcely believe in his own sense of hearing, so  astounding was the statement that met his ears. &ldquo;Tabitha, my mother&rsquo;s faithful  old servant, who was like my own flesh and blood! What in God&rsquo;s name made her  leave you? Did you quarrel with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asked the question almost sternly. For the first  time in his life he was angry with this dear fragile creature, the idol of his  heart. He had loved Tabitha as servants are not often loved. He had left his  young wife in her charge, desiring no better custodian, full of faith in  Tabitha&rsquo;s ability both to protect and counsel her girlish mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; we did not quarrel. I liked Tabitha very  much. I was almost as fond of her as you yourself could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you dismissed her!&rdquo; Disney retorted  bitterly. &ldquo;She was not smart enough for you, perhaps. Those Crowther people may  have put it into your head that she was old-fashioned &mdash; that you could never  have a modish household with such a humdrum old person at the head of it. Was  that your motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Martin, how can you think me so frivolous? I  hate smartness and pretension as much as you do. No, I should never have  dismissed Tabitha. She left me of her own accord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wanted rest. She was too old for service, she  told me. I tried to keep her. I humiliated myself so far as to beg her to stay  with me&rdquo; &mdash; the tears came into her eyes at the mere memory of that humiliation&mdash;  &ldquo;but she had made up her mind. She would not give way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did she go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Falmouth &mdash; to live with her sister, a  shoemaker&rsquo;s widow. They let lodgings, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have gone mad! A lodging-house must be  harder work than anything she had to do here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did she go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of the year &mdash; in January.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She left you six months ago, and in all that time  you never told me she was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not want you to know, for fear you should be  worried or vexed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been both; but you ought to have  told me. I had a right to know. I left you in her charge, Isola. You are much  too young and too pretty to be living alone without some kind of dragon &mdash; and I  knew Tabitha would be a very gentle dragon &mdash; a good motherly soul, able to wait  upon you and look after your health, and yet grim enough to keep marauders off  the premises. Indeed, my pet, you should have let me know of her departure  without an hour&rsquo;s delay. She was very wrong to go. It was a breach of faith I  could never have expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t be angry with her, Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am angry. I have a right to be angry. I&rsquo;ll  go to Falmouth to-morrow, and have it out with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, pray don&rsquo;t! We parted good friends. She  can say nothing to you more than she said to me. Pray don&rsquo;t let there be any  bad blood between you. What could be gained by your going? To-morrow, too &mdash; our  first day together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it shall not be till the day after; but go I  must. To-morrow I will revel in the delights of home, and my dear one&rsquo;s  society. To-morrow I will be drunken with joy. The day after will do for Tabitha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is making a great deal too much of her  to go to Falmouth on purpose to see her,&rdquo; said Isola, with a grain of  pettiness; and then, after a pause, during which the colonel had been trying to  appease a sharp appetite with the muscular leg of an elderly fowl, she said  nervously &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you are not enjoying your dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I care for dinner on such a night as this;  but, as a matter of plain truth, I must say that your new cook is a very bad  substitute for Tabitha. Her soup was watery, her fish was greasy, her poultry  is hardly eatable. If she has talents in any other line she is keeping them in  reserve for another day. It may be that she excels in made-dishes &mdash; a  misfortune for me, as I never eat them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a splendid character with her,&rdquo; said Isola,  piteously, with the helpless feeling of a housewife who sees before her a dark  prospect of bad dinners and marital grumblings, or the agonizing wrench  involved in changing her cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my love, people generally give splendid characters  to servants they want to get rid of,&rdquo; answered Disney, dryly.</p>
<p>These wedded lovers went out very early next  morning to explore the gardens and meadows; Isola eager to point out various  small improvements which she had made with the help of the old gardener, who  would have plunged his hand and arm into a fiery furnace to procure plant or  flower which his young mistress desired. Sweet words and sweet looks go very  far in this world. They are a mighty revenue, and will often do their owner as  good service as gold and silver.</p>
<p>Isola had worked in the garden with her own hands  ever since the beginning of spring, the first tender opening of Earth&rsquo;s heavy  eyelids, her first pale smile of snowdrops, her broad laughter of daffodils,  her joyous peal of bluebells, and riotous mirth of May blossom. She had toiled  in the sweat of her brow so that the garden might be beautiful at mid-summer:  for early in March there had come a letter full of rejoicing from that distant  hill-kingdom, and she knew that the year of absence to which she had looked so  hopelessly last November was commuted to half a year.</p>
<p>Martin Disney was full of admiration for his wife&rsquo;s  improvements. The old-fashioned borders were brimming over with old-world  flowers; the shrubberies had grown out of knowledge; the escalonia hedge by the  kitchen garden was a thing to wonder at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember the hedge at Tregenna Castle before  that good old place was an inn,&rdquo; said Martin; and then, having admired  everything, he walked up and down the grass beside the laurel hedge with his  wife &mdash; while the Satan-sent cook was spoiling the food that bounteous Nature  had provided for man&rsquo;s enjoyment &mdash; and questioned her about the life she had  been leading in his absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You used to write me such good letters, dearest,  so full of detail, that I knew exactly how your days were spent, and could  picture every hour of your life: but of late your descriptive powers have  flagged. I dare say you got tired of writing long letters to a dull old fellow  in India, who could never write you a clever letter in reply. It must have  seemed a one-sided business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no, dear. Your letters had only one fault.  They were never half long enough; but I knew how busy you were, and I thought  it was so good of you never to miss a mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good of me! Had there been twice as many mails I  would not have willingly missed one. But there is no doubt your letters fell  off after last autumn. They were sweet, and ever welcome to me &mdash; but they told  me very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was very little to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but in the old days you used to make it seem  so much. You had such a delightful way of describing trifling events. I thought  at one time you had the makings of a Jane Austen; but afterwards I began to  fear you must be out of health. Your letters had a low-spirited tone. There  were no more of those sharp little touches which used to make me laugh, no more  of those tiny word-pictures, which brought the faces and figures of my old  neighbours before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can hardly wonder if my spirits sank a little  when you had been so long away. And then life seemed so death-like in its  monotony. There were days when I felt I might just as well have been dead.  There could be very little difference between lying under the earth and  crawling listlessly on the top of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were too much alone, Isola,&rdquo; he answered,  distressed at this revelation. &ldquo;You ought to have sent for Allegra. I begged  you to send for her, if you felt dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she could have cured my dulness?&rdquo;  exclaimed his wife, impatiently. &ldquo;Life would have seemed still more tiresome if  I had been obliged to talk when there was nothing to talk about, and to smile  when I felt inclined to cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you don&rsquo;t know what a companion Allegra is &mdash;  brimming over with fun! She knows her Dickens by heart; and I never met with  anybody who appreciated him as intensely as she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about Dickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t &mdash; care &mdash; about Dickens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He echoed her words as if almost paralyzed by  horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I used to care. One&rsquo;s taste changes as life  goes on. Lately I have read nothing but Victor Hugo, and Keats, and Shelley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well in their way, but not half cheery enough  for a lonely little woman beside the Fowey river. You ought to have had  Allegra. It would have been better for you and better for her. She is tired of the  Art school; and the other pupils are tired of her. They are very fond of her;  but she has done all the work twice over, and there is nothing more for her to  do, unless we meant her to enter the Royal Academy and go in seriously for art,  Mrs. Meynell tells me. According to that lady&rsquo;s account my sister must be an  Admirable Crichton in petticoats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt she is very clever and very nice;  but, as I could not have you, I preferred being alone,&rdquo; answered Isola.</p>
<p>She was walking slowly by his side along the  closely shaven grass, and every now and then she stretched out a hand that  looked semi-transparent, and gathered a flower at random, and then plucked off  its petals nervously as she walked on. Her eyelids were lowered, and her lips  were tightly set. Martin could but think there was a vein of obstinacy in this  bewitching wife of his &mdash; a gentle resistance which would tend to make him her  slave rather than her master in the days to come. He saw with pain that her  cheeks were hollow and pinched, and that her complexion had a sickly whiteness.  She had fretted evidently in those long months of solitude, and it would take  time to bring back the colour and gaiety to her face. As for dulness, well, no  doubt Fowey was ever so much duller than Dinan, where there were officers and  tennis-parties and afternoon tea-drinkings, and a going and coming of tourists  all the summer through, and saints&rsquo; days, and processions, and <em>f&ecirc;tes</em> and illuminations in the market  square, beneath the statue of Duguesclin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did the world use you, Isola?&rdquo; he asked  presently. &ldquo;Was everybody kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, people were very kind; especially Mrs.  Baynham and Mrs. Crowther. They sent me ever so many invitations, and wanted me  to go on their day every week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope you accepted their invitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to Mrs. Baynham&rsquo;s sometimes on her day; but  I didn&rsquo;t care about going to Glenaveril. It is all too grand and too fine &mdash; and  I don&rsquo;t like Mr. Crowther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always courteous to you, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he was particularly courteous. I have no  reason for disliking him. He is my Dr. Fell &mdash; the reason why I cannot tell, but  I would walk a mile to avoid meeting him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will not cultivate social relations with  Glenaveril. We will visit at no house where my dearest does not feel happy and  at ease. And as for the finery, I agree with you, there is something too much  of it. I like powder and plush when the people they serve are to the manner  born, and when powder and plush seem more natural than parlour-maids; but I  don&rsquo;t care for the solemn stateliness of a big establishment when it has been  newly set up &mdash; at least, not by such folks as the Crowthers. There are some men  to whom such surroundings seem natural, even though fortune has come late in  life. Is the beautiful Belinda married yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I do not think she is as much as engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Lostwithiel would have married her. She  would have been a grand catch for him, and no doubt she would have snapped at a  coronet, even without strawberry leaves. But I hear he is in South America  orchid-hunting. He was always a capricious individual. There goes the gong for  breakfast. I hope your cook can fry a rasher and boil an egg better than she  can dress a dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went in together to the pretty dining-room, so  bright with books and flowers, and a life-sized girlish head in water-colours,  by Dobson, R.A., over the chimney-piece, and Venetian glass here and there,  that all characteristics of the ordinary eating-room were effaced, and only a  sense of homeliness and artistic surroundings was left. Isola had been down at  six, and her own hands had given the finishing touches to the room, and the  flowers were of that morning&rsquo;s gathering, and had the dew and the perfume of  morning upon them. The room was so pretty, and Isola was so much prettier than  the room, that a husband would have been of very dull clay had he troubled  himself about the handiwork of the cook. Martin Disney was not made of dull  clay, and he ate an overdone rasher and a hard-boiled egg without a murmur, and  then set out for a long ramble with Isola.</p>
<p>They went up to the hill upon whose landward slope  stood Lostwithiel&rsquo;s old grey manor-house, with its gardens and park. Isola had  not been there since that never-to-be-forgotten November evening when she met  Lostwithiel in the rain. She had avoided the spot from that time forward,  though she had no especial reason for avoidance, since there was no one there  but Mrs. Mayne and her underlings. Lostwithiel and the <em>Vendetta</em> had sailed away into space directly after the Hunt Ball,  and little had been heard of him save that dim rumour of orchid-hunting on the  shores of the Amazon, which had filtered from the society papers down to Fowey, <em>vi&acirc;</em> the <em>Western Daily Mercury</em>.</p>
<p>Isola and her husband lingered for a long time upon  the hilltop, he revelling in the familiar beauty of that magnificent stretch of  cliff and sea, out to the dim slate colour of the Dodman Point, bay beyond bay,  curving away towards Falmouth and the Lizard &mdash; while between that hill and the  sea lay a world of fertile meadows and bright green cornfields, of hill and  hollow, wood and common, copse and garden, a rich and smiling country, a land  of summer flowers and plenteous growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never stand upon this hill without feeling proud  of being a Cornishman,&rdquo; said Disney, &ldquo;and yet, after all, it is a foolish thing  to be proud of an accident. My little Breton girl might as well be proud of  being a countrywoman of Duguesclin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if I had been born anywhere else I should  not have been so ready to fall in love with a soldier,&rdquo; answered Isola. &ldquo;I was  brought up to think a knight and a warrior the one ideal: and so I was  fascinated by the first soldier who took any notice of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But were you really fascinated, and were you  really in love,&rdquo; exclaimed Disney, infinitely delighted at this little speech  of his wife&rsquo;s, &ldquo;in love with a battered campaigner &mdash; or did you just think you  liked me a little bit, only because you wanted to get away from Dinan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really &mdash; really &mdash; really loved you,&rdquo; she  answered softly, looking up at him with eyes dimmed by tears, as he drew her  nearer to him in his gladness. &ldquo;I was not tired of Dinan &mdash; or my life there &mdash;  and my heart went out to you at once, because you were good and noble, and  seemed to care for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no seeming in it, Isola. I was knocked  over at once, like a pigeon out of a trap. I had been in love with you three  weeks &mdash; three centuries it seemed &mdash; before I could screw up my courage so far  as to think of proposing for you. And then if Hazelrigg hadn&rsquo;t helped me with  your father, I don&rsquo;t suppose I should ever have broken the ice. But when he &mdash;  the colonel &mdash; showed himself so frank and willing &mdash; and the way was all made  smooth for me from a domestic point of view &mdash; and when I saw that kind little  look in your eyes, and the shy little smile &mdash; yes, you are smiling so now &mdash; I  took heart of grace, and stormed the citadel. Do you remember the evening I  asked you to be my wife, Isola; that starlit night when I had been dining with  your people, and you and Gwendolen, and Hazelrigg and I went out upon the  terrace to look at the stars, and the river, and the twinkling lights of the  boats down by the quay, and the diligence driving over the bridge, deep, deep  down in the valley below us? Do you remember how I lured you away from the  other two, and how we stood under the vine-leaves in the berceau, and I found  the words somehow &mdash; feeblest, stupidest words, I&rsquo;m afraid &mdash; to make you know  that all the happiness of my life to come depended upon winning you for my  wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember as if it were last night,&rdquo; she answered  gravely. &ldquo;But oh, how long ago it seems!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you sigh as you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, one always sighs for the past! How can one  help feeling sorry that it should be gone &mdash; so much of our lives and of  ourselves gone for ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but when the future is so fair, when the  present is so happy, there should be no more sighing. It is an offence against  the Great Father of all, who has been so good to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer, and they remained silent for  some minutes, she seated on a bank covered with heather and wild flowers; he  stretched on the short, sweet turf at her feet. The heather had not begun to  show its purple bloom, but there was the gold of the gorse, and the brightness  of innumerable wild flowers around and about them as they basked in the  sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest, do you believe in dreams?&rdquo; Disney asked  suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes &mdash; not much &mdash; dreams are often dreadful,&rdquo;  she answered, with a startled air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in them a bit,&rdquo; he said, lifting  himself into a sitting position, and addressing himself to her with increasing  earnestness, &ldquo;not now that I have you here safe within reach of my hand &mdash; so,&rdquo;  taking her hand in his, and keeping it clasped in both his own; &ldquo;but I had a  dream about you in Burmah, which kept me in a fever of anxiety for nearly a  month. I should have telegraphed to ask if all was right with you, only I told  myself that if anything was wrong Tabitha would instantly telegraph to me. I  made her promise that before I left England. It was almost my last injunction.  And to think that she left you half a year ago, and that anything might have  happened to you after that, and that there was no one &mdash; no one &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, you see, I am quite safe. There was no bad  news to send you. Besides, if I had been ill, or anything had gone wrong, there  was Mrs. Baynham. She has been like a mother to me. I am so sorry you feel  vexed about Tabitha&rsquo;s leaving me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubly vexed, dear, because you left me in  ignorance of the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t be angry with me, Martin, so soon,&rdquo; she  pleaded meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angry, no. I am not angry. I don&rsquo;t know how to be  angry with you, Isola; but I can&rsquo;t help being distressed. However, let the past  be past. I shall never leave you to the care of strangers again till I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her only answer was to bend her head down to kiss  the hands that clasped her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about your dream,&rdquo; she said, after a  pause, with her forehead still resting on his hands, and her face hidden. &ldquo;Was  it something very awful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all confusion &mdash; a wild chaos &mdash; a nightmare  of strange sounds and sensations &mdash; tempest, fire, earthquake &mdash; I know not what  &mdash; but it meant deadly danger for you &mdash; death perhaps. I saw you hanging in  space &mdash; a white figure, with piteous, pain-wrought face. Never have I seen you  look like that &mdash; your eyes staring wildly as if they were looking at death;  your features drawn and rigid, and through all the confusion, and noise, and  ceaseless movement, I was trying to follow you &mdash; trying, but impotently &mdash; to  save you. The white figure was always before me &mdash; far off &mdash; yet visible every  now and then across the darkness of a world where everything was shapeless and  confused. But the worst of all was that every now and then a black wall rose up  between your distant figure and the stony difficult path that I was treading &mdash;  a wall against which I flung myself, mad with rage and despair, trying to tear  the stones asunder with my hands, till the blood ran in streams from my  fingers. It was a dream that seemed to last through a long night, holding in it  the memory of a painful past; yet I suppose it was like other dreams &mdash;  momentary, for I had heard three o&rsquo;clock strike before I fell asleep, and when  I sounded my repeater it was only a quarter past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a meaningless dream,&rdquo; she said, in a sleepy  voice, without looking up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it ought to have alarmed you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it sounds meaningless to you; but to me it was  full of meaning! The idea of danger to you was so intense &mdash; so real. The cold  sweat of deadly fear was on my face when I awoke, and it was some minutes  before I could get my senses clear of that ghastly horror, before I could  realize where I was, and that the thing I had seen was a dream. That stone wall  seemed still in front of me, and I had still the feeling that you were on the  other side of it, in ever-increasing peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a horrid dream, certainly; but, you see, it  had no meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were such strange things mixed up in it &mdash;  thunder and lightning, a roaring wind, a sound of rushing waters; and then,  amidst wind and thunder, there rose the dark barrier that shut out everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it long ago that you dreamt this horrid  dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a long while. It was just before Christmas. I  made a note of the dream in my journal &mdash; wrote it down in fear and trembling,  lest there should be some kind of fulfilment. But then came your letter &mdash;  written at the beginning of January, with your description of the ball &mdash; and I  laughed at my folly in brooding so long upon that phantasmal picture. I  remember, by the way, it was two or three nights after your ball that I dreamt  my dream, while you no doubt were sleeping just a little sounder than usual  after your gaieties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreams are very strange,&rdquo; said Isola, absently. &ldquo;I  wonder whether there is any good in them to counterbalance so much pain?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  &ldquo;Look Through Mine Eyes With Thine, True Wife&rdquo;</h2>
<p>There were steamers plying between Fowey and  Falmouth in this summer weather, and Colonel Disney suggested next morning that  Isola should go with him on his journey in search of Tabitha. They would go by  water and return in the afternoon by rail. The morning was lovely, and the trip  round the coast would be delightful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see Tabitha,&rdquo; Isola answered, with  a touch of impatience. &ldquo;If you are so bent upon seeing her I had rather you  went alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had rather not spend a whole day away from  you. As for Tabitha, a visit of ten minutes will be quite enough for me. I have  brought her a Rhampoor Chuddah &mdash; a warm red one. I have only to make her my  little gift, and to say a few words &mdash; without any anger &mdash; about her breach of  faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was really not a breach of faith. I gave her  full permission to go. I was getting just a little tired of her fussiness. She  was not <em>my</em> old servant, you know,  Martin. I had not been used to her all my life, as you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but she is so good &mdash; such a thoroughly good  woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is good, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll go to Falmouth together, and you can  stop at the Green Bank, where we can lunch, while I go and find Tabitha. You  know her address, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She lives at No. 5, Crown Terrace,  overlooking the harbour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This conversation took place in the garden, where  they breakfasted, under a square striped awning, an apology for a tent, set up  on the lawn by the river. A badly cooked breakfast seemed less offensive in the  garden, where the summer air, and the perfume of the roses eked out the meal.  After breakfast Disney called his wife to the drawing-room, where he had  brought his spoil from the East, and laid his offerings, as it were, at the  feet of his idol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, love, here is a shawl which you can use as a <em>couvre-pied</em>,&rdquo; he said, flinging a fine  cashmere over a chair, &ldquo;since Fashion decrees that women shall wear shawls no  more. And here are some ivory chessmen to assist you in puzzling your brains  over the game of Eastern antiquity; and here are vases and things for odd  corners. And I have brought you a carved Persian screen, and some Peshawur  curtains for your door-ways, and a lamp from Cairo, to make your drawing-room a  little more fantastically pretty. I know you love these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was enraptured with his gifts. Her face lighted  up like the face of a child, and she ran from one object to the other in a  confused gladness, scarcely able to look at one thing at a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will make the room too lovely,&rdquo; she cried;  &ldquo;and they will tell everybody of your far-away travels. I can never thank you  half enough for all these treasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love me a little, and that will be more than  enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little. Ah, Martin, I love you so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you sigh as you say it? There need be  no sighing over our love now. I never shall leave you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught her to his breast as he spoke, and kissed  the pale sweet face, with a kind of defiant rapture, as if he challenged Fate  to do him any harm. The pain of separation from that fair young wife had been  so keen an agony that there was a touch of savage exultancy in the joy of  re-union &mdash; some such fierce gladness as a knight-crusader might have felt in  days of old, coming back to his beloved after years of war and travel.</p>
<p>God help the crusader&rsquo;s wife of those rough days if  she had turned from the path of virtue during his exile. There would be a short  shrift and a bloody shroud for such a sinner!</p>
<p>They walked into Fowey by that pathway which Isola  had trodden so often in the year that was gone &mdash; not always alone. The pleasure  steamer was waiting in the little haven, where the two rivers part under the  cloven hills. Out seaward the air blew fresh and free, and the spray was  dashing up against the rocks, and Polruan&rsquo;s grey roofs were wrapped in morning  shadows while Fowey laughed in the sunshine.</p>
<p>That water journey to Falmouth was delicious upon  such a morning, and it needed not a brass band of three men and a boy, blaring  out the new and popular music-hall song of the year before last, to enliven the  voyage. Those arable lands yonder, undulating with every curve of the  ever-varying coast-line, the emerald green of young corn shining in the  sunlight, copse and spinney here and there in the clefts and hollows, the  Gribbin Head standing up stony and grim on the crest of the topmost hill, and,  anon, Par harbour lying low upon the level sands, and then this point and that,  till they meet the gallant fleet of fishing-boats sailing out from Mevagissey,  like a peaceful Armada, and skim past the haven, and the little town and quay  crowded at the foot of the hill, and the coastguard&rsquo;s stronghold yonder, high  up against the bright blue sky, whiter than any other mortal habitation ever  was or will be. And so to Falmouth, with porpoises playing under their bows,  like sportive dolphins, as if they carried Dionysius or Arion on their deck &mdash; a  brief summer sail, in the keen sweet air of an English summer. To Martin  Disney&rsquo;s British nostrils that atmosphere seemed soul-inspiring, the very  breath of life and gladness, after the experiences of a hot-weather campaign.</p>
<p>And here was Falmouth, with proud Pendennis on a  sunny height, and bay and harbour, town and hill, terrace above terrace, tower  and steeple &mdash; the town and streets all crowded and clustered in the foreground,  where the river winds inward to the heart of the land.</p>
<p>The Green Bank gave them cordial welcome, and  luncheon was speedily spread in a private sitting-room, at a snug round table  by a window overlooking the harbour &mdash; luncheon, and of the best, tongue and  chicken, and salad, cherry pasty, junket and cream.</p>
<p>Colonel Disney applied himself to the meal with a  hearty relish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is just this one advantage in bad cooking at  home that it makes one so thoroughly enjoy everything one gets abroad,&rdquo; he  said, laughing at his own prowess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and get a better cook, if you like,  Martin,&rdquo; Isola said, with rather a helpless air.</p>
<p>To a wife of one and twenty there seems such  futility in worrying about a cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t possibly get a worse. How long have  you put up with this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since Tabitha left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! You have been starving upon  ill-cooked food for six months. No wonder you look thin and out of health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am really very well. There is nothing the matter  with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, there is a great deal the matter. A bad  cook, solitude, no one to watch over you and care for you. But that is all over  now. You are eating no lunch &mdash; not even that superb cherry pasty. I&rsquo;ll be off  to find Tabitha. I shan&rsquo;t be more than half an hour, unless Crown Terrace is at  the extremity of Falmouth. Have you brought a book to read while I am away? No,  foolish child. Never mind. There is the county paper, and there is the harbour,  with all its life, for you to look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started on his voyage of discovery, with the warm,  comfortable shawl which he had bought for his mother&rsquo;s old servant hanging over  his arm. It was a small disappointment amidst the infinite delight of his  home-coming, but when he bought the shawl he had fancied himself putting it  round Tabitha&rsquo;s ample shoulders in the little housekeeper&rsquo;s room at the  Angler&rsquo;s Nest, a room that was just large enough to hold a linen cupboard, a  Pembroke table, a comfortable armchair, and Tabitha, who seemed bigger than all  the furniture put together.</p>
<p>He was a man of warm affections, and of that  constancy of mind and temper to which forgetfulness of old ties or indifference  to past associations is impossible. Tabitha&rsquo;s image was associated with all the  tenderest memories of his youth; with his mother&rsquo;s widowhood, and with her  second marriage &mdash; a foolish marriage. At seven and thirty years of age she had  taken to herself a second husband, some years her junior, in the person of  George Leland, a well-meaning and highly intellectual curate with weak lungs, a  union entered upon while her only son was a cadet, and which left her four  years later again a widow, with an infant daughter, a child born amidst  sickness and sorrow, and christened at the father&rsquo;s desire Allegra, as if she  had entered a world of joy. Through that Indian summer of his mother&rsquo;s second  love, in all the cares and griefs of her second marriage, Tabitha had been  trusty and devoted, nursing the frail husband through that last year of fading  life which was one long illness, comforting the widow, and rearing the sickly  baby until it blossomed into a fine healthy child, whose strength and beauty  took every one by surprise.</p>
<p>With all the joys and sorrows of his mother&rsquo;s life  Tabitha had been associated for five and thirty years of conscientious service;  and to have lost the good soul now from his fireside was a positive affliction  to Martin Disney. Her loss gave an air of instability to his domestic life. Who  would ever care for his property as Tabitha had cared &mdash; Tabitha who had seen  the china and the pictures and drawings collected piece by piece, who had seen  the old family silver drop in by way of legacy from this and that aunt or  uncle, till the safe was full of treasures, every one of which had its distinct  history? What would a new housekeeper care for General Disney&rsquo;s coffee-pot, for  the George the Second urn that had belonged to his uncle the Indian judge, for  his grandmother&rsquo;s decanter stands? A modern servant would scoff at decanter  stands; would wonder they were not melted down. No, rejoiced as he was to be at  home once more, home without Tabitha would be something less than home to  Martin Disney.</p>
<p>He found Crown Terrace, a row of neat little houses  high above the harbour on the Helston road. He had no need to look at the  numbers on the doors. He knew Tabitha&rsquo;s house at a glance, four or five doors  off. Who else would have devised such pretty window-boxes, so simple and so  artistic; or who else would have hit upon so perfect a harmony of colour in the  flowering plants? Who else, of that lowly status, would have chosen such  curtains or draped them so gracefully? The little bow-windowed band-box of a  house was as pretty as a Parisian toy.</p>
<p>Tabitha was in the window, working with scissors  and sponge at one of the flower-boxes. Never an aphid was allowed to rest on  Tabitha&rsquo;s roses or geraniums. She gave a little cry of mixed alarm and delight  as she saw that stalwart figure come between her and the sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo; sakes, Captain Martin, is it you?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tabby, it is I &mdash; and I want to know what  you&rsquo;ve got to say to me. Do you know how a deserter feels when he suddenly  finds himself face to face with his commanding officer? I never had such a  knock-down blow as when I came home the day before yesterday and found you had  deserted your post &mdash; you whom I trusted so implicitly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabitha looked at him dumbly &mdash; entreatingly &mdash; as if  she were mutely supplicating him not to be angry. She took this reproof with an  air of having thoroughly deserved it, of not having any plea to offer in her  defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come in and sit down a bit, won&rsquo;t you,  Captain Martin?&rdquo; she said deprecatingly; and then, without waiting for an  answer, she bustled out of the parlour, and anon appeared at the open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I am coming in. I have a great deal  to say to you &mdash; much more than can be said in the open street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabitha ushered him into the little parlour; so  neat, so cool and dainty a bower, albeit the whole of its contents would  scarcely have realized ten pounds at an auction. She offered him her most  luxurious easy-chair &mdash; a large Madeira chair, with pale chintz cushions and  artistic draping; and then, when he had seated himself, she stood before him  like a prisoner at the bar, and with unmistakable guilt disturbing the broad  placidity of her countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tabby, there is my offering from the Indies. May  it keep you warm when you run out upon your mysterious errands on autumn  evenings, as you used to do in my mother&rsquo;s time. Sit down, pray; I have lots to  say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabitha received the comfortable gift with  rapturous thanks. That Captain Martin should have thought of her, so far away,  with his head full of fighting, and with death looking him in the face! It was  too much, and the tears rolled down her honest cheeks as she thanked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Tabitha, I want a candid answer to a  straight question. Why did you leave my wife last January?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easily explained, sir. I&rsquo;m getting old, and  I was tired of service. Mrs. Disney was very well able to spare me. Perhaps she  didn&rsquo;t set the same value on me as you did. Young people like young faces about  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that I can understand; but it didn&rsquo;t exonerate  you from your duty to me. You promised me to take care of my young wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did my best, Captain Martin, as long as I could  give satisfaction,&rdquo; faltered Tabitha, growing very pale under this reproof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you any misunderstanding with Mrs. Disney? Did  she find fault with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, sir. Mrs. Disney is not one to find fault.  She&rsquo;s too easy, if anything. No one could be sweeter than she was to me. God  knows, if she had been my own daughter I could not have loved her better than I  did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Tabitha broke down altogether, and sobbed  aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, my good soul, don&rsquo;t distress  yourself,&rdquo; cried Disney, touched by this emotion. &ldquo;You loved her; you could not  help loving her, could you? And yet you left her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was getting tired and old, sir; and I had saved  enough money to furnish a small house; and my sister, Mrs. David, being a widow  without chick or child, wanted me to join her in a lodging-house at the  seaside. She&rsquo;s a beautiful cook, is my sister, much better than ever I was. So  perhaps I was over-persuaded: and here I am. What&rsquo;s done cannot be undone,  Captain Martin; but if ever Mrs. Disney should be ill or in grief or trouble,  and she should want me, I&rsquo;ll go to her without an hour&rsquo;s loss of time. I can  never forget that she is your wife, and that she was a kind mistress to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin Disney breathed more freely after this  speech. He had been curiously disturbed at the idea of a breach between his  wife and the old and faithful servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tabby, I&rsquo;m glad at least you and my wife are  not ill friends,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not care for the loosening of old ties. And  now I must be off. Mrs. Disney is waiting for me at the Green Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabitha seemed a little startled on hearing that  her late mistress was in Falmouth, but she made no remark upon the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Tabby. Stay, there&rsquo;s one favour you can  do me. Get me a good cook. The woman we have at present would be a blight upon  the happiest home in Christendom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find you a better one, sir. I&rsquo;ll set about  hunting for a good one this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin shook hands with her on the door-step, and  she stood watching him till he disappeared at the turn of the road. She watched  him with a countenance full of sorrow.</p>

  My Frolic Falcon, With Bright Eyes</h2>
<p>Everybody in Trelasco and in the neighbourhood  seemed glad to see Colonel Disney again. All the best people within a six-mile  drive came bearing down upon the Angler&rsquo;s Nest in the week that followed his  return; and there were cosy little afternoon tea-drinkings in the drawing-room,  or on the lawn, and Isola had her hands full in receiving visitors. Everybody  congratulated her upon having her hero back from the wars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be very proud of your husband, Mrs.  Disney,&rdquo; said Vansittart Crowther, with his air of taking all the world under  his protection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always been proud of him,&rdquo; Isola answered  gently. &ldquo;I was proud of him before the Burmese War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your poor wife has been looking very unhappy for  the last few months,&rdquo; Mrs. Crowther said to the colonel, with a motherly glance  at Isola. &ldquo;I really had a good mind to write to you and beg you to hurry home  if you didn&rsquo;t want to find the poor thing far gone in a decline when you came  back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Crowther, what nonsense,&rdquo; cried  Isola, growing crimson at this motherly officiousness. &ldquo;I have never been out  of health, or in the least likely to go into a decline. One cannot always look  like a dairy-maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, there&rsquo;s no use talking, you looked very  bad. Had one of my girls looked as ill, I should have taken her off to Buxton  to drink the waters, without an hour&rsquo;s delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That visit of the Crowthers seemed much longer than  any other afternoon call. The Crowthers, husband, and wife, and elder daughter,  had an inquisitorial air, Isola fancied, an air of scrutinizing her house and  herself and her surroundings, which was intolerable to her; although on Mrs.  Crowther&rsquo;s part she knew the scrutiny was made in the utmost benevolence, and  the officiousness was the outcome of a nature overflowing with the milk of  human kindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you had written to me, Mrs. Crowther,&rdquo; said  Disney. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have come home any sooner, but I could have telegraphed to  my sister Allegra to look after my wife, and cheer her solitude. I was a fool  not to have had her here all along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better go out of the room while you are  holding your consultation about me?&rdquo; exclaimed Isola, fretfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather  hard upon the patient to hear her case discussed in cold blood. I am tired of  declaring that I have not been ill, and that it is my misfortune and not my  fault to have a pale complexion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not always so pallid, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs.  Crowther, persistently. &ldquo;You were one of the beauties of the Hunt Ball, and you  had colour enough that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. and Mrs. Baynham came the following afternoon,  and these two told the same story, though with less obtrusive concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked after the young lady now and then,&rdquo; said  the worthy doctor, &ldquo;and as I found there was nothing radically wrong, I didn&rsquo;t  worry you with any low-spirited reports; but I expect to see her pick up  wonderfully now you have come home. She didn&rsquo;t take enough outdoor exercise,  that&rsquo;s where the harm was. She used to be so fond of her boat last year, but  this year I fancy she didn&rsquo;t feel herself up to handling the sculls. You didn&rsquo;t  now, did you, Mrs. Disney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, but I am ready to row to  the Land&rsquo;s End, now Martin is back,&rdquo; said Isola, and those few words seemed the  sweetest Martin Disney had heard since Colonel Manwaring&rsquo;s daughter promised to  be his wife.</p>
<p>Mrs. Baynham sat on the lawn, sipping her tea, and  basking in the afternoon sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have seen your wife in her wedding-gown  at the Lostwithiel dance,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You would have been proud of her. She  didn&rsquo;t want to go &mdash; refused Mrs. Crowther and me again and again. She thought  it wasn&rsquo;t right to be at any merry-making while your life was in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know &mdash; I know. My tender-hearted Isola!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But at last we got the better of her objections;  and though there were a good many pretty women there, and though Miss Crowther,  perhaps, pleased most tastes, being a more showy style of beauty, to my  thinking there wasn&rsquo;t one came up to Mrs. Disney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her partners seemed of the same opinion,&rdquo; put in  the doctor, cheerily. &ldquo;Why, how often did Lord Lostwithiel dance with you, Mrs.  Disney? Oftener than with anybody else, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Baynham nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very proud of my party that evening, I can  tell you, Colonel Disney,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t often that one has to chaperon  three attractive young women. Do you know that my youngest niece, Maria, has  had two offers since that night, Isola, and when I last heard from her she was  on the brink of an engagement? Ah, well, I hope we shall have another ball next  December, now that the neighbourhood has begun to wake up a bit. We have been  thinking of getting up a water picnic this summer &mdash; just a little excursion to  Mevagissey, and a little fishing for those who might care for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very pleasant, indeed, of you,&rdquo; answered the  colonel, cheerily. &ldquo;We will be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Crowthers are rather grand in their ideas,&rdquo;  said the doctor, &ldquo;but Alicia is very keen upon all kind of sport, so I know  she&rsquo;ll want to come, whatever Belinda may say to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Baynham made a wry face at the name of the  elder sister. It was an involuntary and unconscious contortion; but Belinda had  tried to snub Mrs. Baynham, who never could forget that her father was a banker  at Truro, and held the fortunes &mdash; the mortgages and encumbrances of the landed  gentry &mdash; in the hollow of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like the elder Miss Crowther?&rdquo;  speculated the colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I am to be candid, I must confess that I  have a positive aversion to that young lady. The airs she gives herself on the  strength of her father&rsquo;s wool are really insupportable, and since Lord  Lostwithiel disappointed her she has been more odious than she was before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by Lostwithiel disappointing her?  Did he jilt her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it could scarcely be called jilting, and I  really don&rsquo;t know that there was anything between them; but people had coupled  their names &mdash; and he dined at Glenaveril at least once a week all the time he  was at the Mount &mdash; and people had quite made up their minds it was to be a  match. Mr. Crowther went about talking of Lord Lostwithiel and his affairs as  if he was his father-in-law &mdash; the neglected condition of the land, and what  ought to be done at the Mount, and that the estate wanted judicious nursing,  and all that sort of thing. And then one December morning his lordship sailed  off in his yacht before it was light, and there was no more heard of him. It  was quite in his way to go off suddenly like that, but the Crowthers were  evidently taken by surprise, and we heard no more about Lord Lostwithiel and  the Mount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They dropped him like a hot potato,&rdquo; said the  doctor. &ldquo;Well, we shall depend upon you both for our water-party. It will not  be till the middle of July, when an old chum of mine, a sailor, will be coming  this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a sample of many such visits. In the  country, and even in London upon occasion, people are given to discussing the  same subjects. Martin Disney heard a good deal about the Crowthers and their  supposed disappointment. People liked Mrs. Crowther for her simple, unaffected  ways, and thorough-going kindliness; but Vansittart and his daughters had made  a good many enemies. He was too coarse; they were too fine; only the mother&rsquo;s  simple nature had caught the golden mean between blunt vulgarity and artificial  smartness.</p>
<p>Colonel Disney heard all this village gossip with  an unheeding ear. He was secure in his own position as a son of the soil, a man  whose pedigree could pass muster with that of the Rashleighs and the Treffrys,  a man of means that were ample for his own unpretending tastes and  requirements. He cared not a jot how many guineas a year the Crowthers might  give to their cook, or how much Mr. Crowther had paid for the furnishing and  decoration of his house, a theme upon which the gossips of the neighbourhood loved  to enlarge. That Mrs. Crowther had gowns from Worth, and that her daughters  employed Mrs. Mason, irked not this simple soldier. The only point in all the  stream of talk that had affected him was the unanimous opinion that Trelasco in  the spring had been too relaxing for Mrs. Disney, or else that her solitude had  preyed upon her mind, inasmuch as she had looked so ill as to afford an  interesting subject of conversation to a good many friendly people who suffered  from the chronic malady of not having enough to talk about, a form of  starvation almost as bad as not having enough to eat.</p>
<p>The colonel listened, and made his own conclusions.  He did not believe that Trelasco was &ldquo;relaxing.&rdquo; He loved the district too well  to believe any evil thing about it. Those fresh breezes that blew up from the  sea, those balmy airs that breathed across the heather-clad hills, must bring  health with them. What could one have better than that mingling of sea and  hill, brine and honey, gorse-bloom and seaweed? No, Trelasco was not to blame.  His young wife had suffered for lack of youthful company. He made up his mind  accordingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you won&rsquo;t object to our having Allegra  here for a summer visit, will you, love?&rdquo; he asked at breakfast the day after  Mrs. Baynham&rsquo;s call. &ldquo;London must be hot, and dusty, and dreary in July, and  she must want rest and country air, I fancy, after having worked so hard in her  art school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola gave a scarcely perceptible sigh as she bent  to caress Tim, a privileged attendant of the breakfast-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Object! Of course not, Martin. I shall be very  pleased for your sister to come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel very sure you will be pleased with her when  you and she get upon intimate terms. You could know so little of her from that  one evening in the Cavendish Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The occasion in question was an evening in which  Isola and her husband had been bidden to a friendly dinner, on their way  through London, by the clergyman&rsquo;s widow with whom Allegra lived while she  pursued her study of art at a famous school in St. John&rsquo;s Wood. The clergyman&rsquo;s  widow, Mrs. Meynell, was a distant cousin of the Disneys, and Allegra&rsquo;s home  had been with her from the time she left school. The extent of her wanderings  after she was old enough to be sent to a boarding-school had been from Falmouth  to Kensington, and from Kensington to St. John&rsquo;s Wood, with occasional holidays  in the Isle of Thanet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought she was very fresh and bright and  loving,&rdquo; answered Isola, &ldquo;and I could see even in that one evening that she was  very fond of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, God bless her, there is no doubt about that.  I have been brother and father too for her. She has had no one but me since our  mother&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I write and ask her to come to us, Martin,  or will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy she would take it more as a compliment if the  invitation went straight from you. She would know that I would be glad to have  her, but she might feel a little doubtful about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll write to her to-day, Martin, and beg her  to come at once &mdash; as soon as ever she can pack her boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my darling! I hope she won&rsquo;t bore you when  she is here. I have a shrewd idea she&rsquo;ll make your life happier. She&rsquo;ll awaken  you from that languor which has grown upon you in your loneliness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I&rsquo;ll try to make her happy, Martin, if it  is only for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, and you will soon love her for her own sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the boat looked to at once, and I&rsquo;ll see  about making the spare room pretty for her,&rdquo; said Isola.</p>
<p>A week later Allegra was with them, breakfasting on  the lawn in the balmy atmosphere of July. There were two girls, in white gowns,  under the tulip tree, instead of one; and Martin Disney felt as if his domestic  happiness were doubled, as he looked at those two graceful figures in the  flickering light below that canopy of broad bright leaves. Another element of  comfort, too, had entered the Angler&rsquo;s Nest; for the incompetent cook had taken  her incompetency and a month&rsquo;s wages to her native city of Truro; and a buxom  damsel from Falmouth, recommended by Tabitha, had already proved herself a treasure  in the culinary art.</p>
<p>Never was there a fairer picture than that domestic  group under the tulip tree. The two girlish figures in white muslin, with  palest salmon and palest azure ribbons fluttering and glancing in the light and  deepening in the shadow; the white fox-terrier, alert, muscular, mercurial; the  tortoise-shell cat, long-haired, aristocratic, and demure; the pretty Moorish  plateau on bamboo legs, the purple and crimson breakfast service and rare old  silver urn, the fruit and flowers, and amber-hued butter, and rustic luxury of  preserved fruit and clotted cream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lovely it all is after Cavendish Road!&rdquo; cried  Allegra, rapturously. &ldquo;When I see the lights and shadows upon those hills, I  despair of ever being able to paint a landscape as long as I live. Nature is  maddeningly beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your particular line, Allegra?&rdquo; asked her  brother. &ldquo;Is it landscape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I only care for landscape as a background for  humanity. I want to paint genre pictures in water-colour &mdash; women and children &mdash;  beautiful women amidst beautiful surroundings &mdash; picturesque poverty &mdash;  interesting bits of daily life. Mrs. Allingham is the ideal after which I  strive, but I am only at the bottom of the ladder. It is a long climb to the  top; but one does not mind that in a profession where labour is delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are fond of art, then?&rdquo; said Isola, watching  the earnest face of the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fond of it! Why, I live for it! The dream of my  life from the time I was seven years old has been one long dream of the bliss  that was to be mine when I could feel myself able to paint. I have toiled with  all my might. Martin disliked the idea of my being an Academy student &mdash; poor,  foolish, ignorant Martin &mdash; so I have been obliged to plod on at St. John&rsquo;s  Wood, without hope of prizes or medals; but on the whole I have been very  lucky, for I have made friends among the Academicians. They are very kind to  any student who seems in rightdown earnest; and they have been ever so good to  me. I hope, Martin, you will find some day that I am something better than an  amateur,&rdquo; she concluded, resting her two hands caressingly upon her brother&rsquo;s  shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest, I have not the least doubt you will  astonish me. I am very ignorant of everything connected with art. I set my face  against the Academy because I thought the training and the life would be too  public for my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if Burlington House were any more public than  that big school at St. John&rsquo;s Wood, my dear illogical brother: and yet we women  are the only people who are said to be wanting in the logical faculty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She leant back in her basket-chair, revelling in  the rural atmosphere, and in that new sense of being in the bosom of her  family. Tim leapt upon her lap and licked her face, in token of his acceptance  of her into the home-circle. Nobody had ever called Miss Leland a beauty, nor  had she ever received those disquieting attentions which follow the footsteps  of exceptional loveliness. She was sometimes described as a girl who grew upon  one; and people who knew her well generally ended by thinking her distractingly  pretty. She had a brilliant complexion, of the true English type, fair and  blooming &mdash; a complexion which indicated perfect health and an active, orderly  life; no late hours or novel-reading over the fire &mdash; an out-of-door complexion,  which would have looked its best under a neat little felt hat in the  hunting-field, or under a coquettish straw sailor hat on board a yacht. Her  eyes were blue-grey, with long, brown lashes and boldly marked eyebrows; her  nose was firmly modelled, inclining a little to the aquiline order. Her mouth  was the prettiest feature in her face, and yet it was a shade larger than  accepted perfection in mouths. It was a mouth chiefly remarkable for character  and expression; and, indeed, it was the individuality and variety of expression  in the fair young face which constituted Miss Leland&rsquo;s chief claim to  distinction.</p>
<p>She started up from the nest of basket-work and  flowered chintz, and stood tall and erect, a Juno-like young woman, with heavy  plaits of reddish-brown hair rolled in a great knot at the back of her head.  She might have answered one of those harsh advertisements for parlour-maids, in  which the words, &ldquo;No fringe,&rdquo; figure with curt cruelty; for her hair was  brushed smoothly back from the fair forehead, and the severity of the style  became that wide sagacious brow. It was just the kind of forehead which can  endure exposure without conveying an idea of bald ugliness.</p>
<p>She was tall and strongly made, fashioned after the  semblance of Diana or Atalanta rather than Venus or Psyche. Her every movement  had the bold, free grace of vigorous, unspoiled youth. She had always been  active &mdash; fond of walking, riding, rowing, swimming, as well as of art, and with  an ardent passion for the country, which had made existence in a London suburb  one long sacrifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to take the train for Hampstead Heath or  Willesden,&rdquo; she told her brother, &ldquo;and go off for long, lonely tramps to  Finchley or Hendon. I have watched the builder&rsquo;s progress along roads and lanes  I loved. I have seen horrid brick boxes creeping along like some new kind of  noxious insect, eating up fields and hedgerows, old hawthorns and old hollies.  I could have sat down in the muddy road and cried sometimes, at the thought  that soon there would be no country walk left within reach of a Londoner. Once  I went off to the north-east, to look for the rural lanes Charles Lamb and his  sister loved &mdash; the lanes and meadows where they carried their little picnic  basket, till they took shelter at a homely inn. Oh, Martin, all those fields  and lanes, Charles Lamb&rsquo;s country &mdash; are going, going, or gone! It is  heartbreaking! And they are building at Fowey, too, I see. Positively there  will be no country anywhere soon. There will be crescents and terraces and  little ugly streets at the very Land&rsquo;s End, and the Logan Rock will be the sign  of a public-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be down-hearted, Chatterbox! I think  Cornwall may last our time,&rdquo; said Disney, laughing at her vehemence.</p>
<p>Allegra was a great talker. It seemed as if she had  a well-spring of joy and life within her which must find an outlet. When people  ventured to hint at her loquacity she declared that her name was in fault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have grown up to match my name,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;if I  had been christened Penserosa I might have been quite a different person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her vivacity gave a new element of brightness to  the Angler&rsquo;s Rest, where Disney had been somewhat oppressed by the sensation of  intense repose which had pervaded his <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> life with Isola. He loved his wife so entirely, so unselfishly, and devotedly,  that it was happiness to him to be with her; yet in the three or four weeks  that had gone by since his return he had struggled in vain against the feeling  that there was something wanting in his home. Isola waited upon him and deferred  to him with more than wifely submissiveness. He would have liked a spurt of  rebellion once in a way, a little burst of girlish temper, just to show that  she was human; but none ever came. His every desire was anticipated. Whatever  plan he suggested &mdash; to walk, to drive, to visit, or not to visit &mdash; the river or  the sea &mdash; was always the plan that pleased her best, or at least she said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall call you Griselda instead of  Isola,&rdquo; he said one day, taking the fair pale face between his hands and gazing  into the mournful depths of the dark violet eyes &mdash; inscrutable eyes they seemed  to him, when the pupils dilated under his gaze, as if the eyes made a darkness  to hide their meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>A flood of crimson passed over her face like a  fire, and left her paler than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you are only too dutiful. Would you resist  if I were to turn tyrant, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no fear of your turning tyrant,&rdquo; she  answered, with a sad little smile; &ldquo;you are only too good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! There can be no question of goodness. If a  man picked up a diamond as precious as the Koh-i-noor, could he be good to it?  How can I be good to my gem? I have but one thing left in the world to desire,  or to pray for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that, Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see you happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the sudden flame crimsoned her face, that  sensitive spiritual face which reflected every change of feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am happy, Martin, quite happy, happier than I  ever thought to be, now that you are home again. What have I more to desire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that really so? Was my long absence your  greatest trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered slowly, looking at him with a  curiously steady look, &ldquo;that was the beginning and end of my trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he said, drawing a deep breath. &ldquo;There  have been moments &mdash; just of late &mdash; when I have puzzled my brains about you &mdash;  until I thought&mdash;&rdquo; very slowly, &ldquo;there might have been something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clasped her in his arms, and hid her face upon  his breast, as if &mdash; fearing that he might have wounded her by those last words  &mdash; he wanted to make amends before she had time to feel his unkindness. His  tenderness for her had so much of that pitying love which a strong man feels  for a child.</p>
<p>This conversation occurred the day before Allegra&rsquo;s  arrival; but with that young lady&rsquo;s appearance on the scene, new life and  gladness came into the little household. Allegra sang, Allegra played, Allegra  ran out into the garden twenty times a day, and called through the open window  to Isola, sitting quietly in the drawing-room, to come out and look at this or  that &mdash; a rose finer than all other roses &mdash; a suggested alteration &mdash; an  atmospheric effect &mdash; anything and everything. She was a keen observer of  Nature, full of vivid interest in every creature that lived, and in every  flower that grew. Tim followed her everywhere as she danced along the gravel  walks, or across the short springy turf. Tim adored her, and grinned at her,  and threw himself into all manner of wriggling attitudes upon the grass to  express his delight in her company, and fawned at her feet, and talked to her  after his guttural fashion, snorting his friendly feelings. Tim had long  languished for such a companion, having found his young mistress&rsquo;s society very  heavy of late. No more runs in the meadow, no more rambles in the neighbouring  spinney, and very little boating. But now that Allegra had come the skiff was  seldom idle. Isola had to go on the river whether she liked or not. There were  strong young arms ready to pull her &mdash; round young arms, of a lovely roseate  fairness, which looked their best, stretched to the motion of the sculls, with  the white cambric shirt rolled up above the elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can read Shelley while I scull the boat,&rdquo; said  Allegra. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any help. If you knew what rapture it is to me to feel  the breath of Seagods and Tritons after St. John&rsquo;s Wood, and the smoke from the  Metropolitan Railway, you wouldn&rsquo;t pity me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola submitted, and sat at her ease upon  bright-coloured cushions with an Indian rug spread round her, as idle as if she  had been the belle of a Zenana, and read Alastor while the boat sped seaward in  the sunshine.</p>
<p>Sometimes they moored their boat at the landing  stage at Polruan, and walked up the hill to the Point, and sat there for an  hour or two in the summer wind with their books and picnic basket, seeing great  ships go out towards the Lizard and the big distant world, or sail merrily  homeward towards Plymouth and the Start. Isola looked at those outward-bound  ships with a strange longing in her eyes &mdash; a longing to flee away upon those  broad wings that flashed whitely in the sunlit distance. Were people happy on  board those ships, she wondered, happy at escaping from the fetters of an old  life and a beaten path, happy going away to strange lands and freedom? She had  been reading many books of travel of late, and a kind of passion for remote  uncivilized countries had come upon her; as if that untrammelled life meant  release from memory and saddening cares &mdash; a new birth almost. It seemed from  some of those books as if there could be no greater happiness upon this earth than  to tramp across sandy deserts and stalk occasional lions; while in others the  supreme good seemed to be found in the attempt to scale impossible mountains.  What was it that made the rapture of these things? Isola wondered. Was it that  perils and wild solitudes offered the only possible escape out of a past  existence, on this side the grave? Allegra had never so much as crossed the  Channel. She had been brought up in the most humdrum fashion. First a school at  Falmouth, and then a smarter school at Kensington, and then St. John&rsquo;s Wood and  the Art School. Her mother had died when she was fourteen years of age, and  since that time her brother had been her only guardian and almost her only  friend. Her life had seen but little variety, and very little of the dancing  and gaiety which for most girls is the only form of pleasure. She and Isola  talked about the ships as they sat upon the grassy hill at Polruan, and  speculated about the lands of which they knew only what they had read in books  of travel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, at least, know what France is like,&rdquo; said  Allegra, &ldquo;and that is something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one little corner of France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that you were born in an old French  city! It seems strange. Do you feel at all French?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so; only sometimes a longing comes  upon me to see the old grey walls, and to hear the old voices, and see the  curious old women in their white caps and bright-coloured handkerchiefs,  clattering along to the Cathedral. There must be more old women in Brittany  than in Cornwall, I think. Fowey does not swarm with old women as Dinan did.  And sometimes I long to see mother, and the good old Brittany servants, and the  garden where the hours went by so slowly &mdash; almost as slowly as they go here&rdquo; &mdash;  with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does time go so very slowly here?&rdquo; asked Allegra,  quickly. &ldquo;That sounds as if you were unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense you talk!&rdquo; cried Isola, with a flash  of sudden anger. &ldquo;Cannot one be dull and bored sometimes &mdash; from very idleness &mdash;  without being unhappy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but, for my own part, when I am  happy I am never dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have more of what people call animal spirits  than I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you apologize in a manner for that odious  phrase &mdash; animal spirits. I would not apply such a phrase to Tim. It suggests  nothing but Audrey at a statute fair. Heaven gave me a capacity for happiness,  and I thank God every night in my prayers for another happy day. Even at school  I contrived to be happy, somehow; and think what it must be after seven years  of dull routine to feel that I have done with sitting at a stranger&rsquo;s table and  that I am here in a home, my own home, with my brother and sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two women clasped hands, and kissed each other  upon this. Only the night before Isola, of her own free will, had asked her  sister-in-law to make her home at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest always, always, till she  should be led out of it as a bride; and Martin had shown himself supremely  happy in the knowledge that his sister had won his wife&rsquo;s love and confidence.</p>
<p>When Isola and he were alone together after the  sealing of that family bond, he kissed and thanked her for this boon which she  had bestowed upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never could have felt quite at ease while  Allegra was living with strangers,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;And now my cup is full. But  are you sure, dearest, that you will never find her in the way, never fancy  yourself any the less mistress of your house, and of my life, because she is  here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, never, never! I am gladder than I can say  to have her. She is a delightful companion. She helps me in a hundred ways. But  even if she were less charming it would be my duty to have her here since you  like her to be with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it must not be done as a duty. I will not have  you sacrifice your inclination in the slightest degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an obtuse person you are! Don&rsquo;t I tell you  that I am enchanted to have her? She is as much my sister as ever Gwendolen  was; indeed, she is much more sympathetic than Gwen ever was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am perfectly content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allegra wrote to Mrs. Meynell next day, announcing  the decision that had been arrived at, not without grateful acknowledgments of  that lady&rsquo;s kindness. The rest of her belongings were to be sent to her  forthwith, easels, and colour-boxes, books and knickknacks; her brother&rsquo;s  gifts, most of them from the romantic East; things which made her few little  Kensingtonian keepsakes look very trivial and Philistine. Allegra&rsquo;s possessions  gave a new individuality to the large, airy bedroom, and the tiny boudoir at  the corner of the house, looking seaward, which Isola had arranged for her.</p>
<p>While these things were doing Martin Disney was  buying horses and buying land &mdash; a farm of over two hundred acres which would  make his property better worth holding &mdash; and he had further employed a Plymouth  architect to plan an enlargement of the old-fashioned cottage &mdash; a new and much  more spacious drawing-room, two bedrooms over, a verandah below, and a loggia  above. In that mild climate the loggia would afford a pleasant lounge even in  winter, and myrtle and roses would speedily cover the wooden columns which  sustained the tiled roof. It was to be a homely Italian loggia &mdash; unpretentious,  and not particularly architectural; but Isola and her sister-in-law were  delighted at the idea.</p>
<p>The stables were to be enlarged as well as the  house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no idea how I have hoarded and scraped to  lay by money ever since I bought the Nest,&rdquo; said Disney. &ldquo;I believe I was the  greatest screw in the service all through my last campaign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed aloud in amused remembrance of many  small sacrifices, while the three heads clustered over the architect&rsquo;s plan,  which had that factitious prettiness of delicate drawing and colour which makes  every house so much nearer perfection upon paper than it ever can be in brick  and stone.</p>

  &ldquo;Lies Nothing Buried Long Ago?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Like most small country settlements, little  fraternities of well-to-do people who think themselves the beginning and end of  the world, Trelasco was slow to rise to any festivity in the way of  party-giving. So it was about two months after Colonel Disney&rsquo;s return before  the friendly calls and interchange of small civilities culminated in a  dinner-party at Glenaveril. It seemed, indeed, only right and natural that the  great house of the district, great by reason of Lord Lostwithiel&rsquo;s  non-residence, should be the first to open its doors in a ceremonial manner to  the colonel and his womankind. The invitation to his sister might be taken as  an especial compliment, arms outstretched to receive one who was a stranger in  the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to know that nice, young sister of yours,&rdquo;  Mr. Crowther said to Colonel Disney, in his patronizing way, as they all came  out of church the Sunday before the dinner-party. &ldquo;A remarkably fine girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colonel did not thank him for this compliment,  which was pronounced in a loud voice, amidst the little knot of acquaintances  taking leave of each other on the dip of the hill, where there was a sign-post  on a patch of waste grass, and where road and lanes divided, one up the hill to  Tywardreath, another to Fowey, and a narrow-wooded lane leading down to Glenaveril  and the Angler&rsquo;s Nest. Short as the distance was, there were carriages waiting  for the Crowthers, who never walked to church, however fine the weather. Mrs.  Crowther came to the morning service resplendent in a brocade gown and a  Parisian bonnet, on pain of being condemned as dowdy by her husband, who liked  to put the stamp of his wealth upon every detail. His wife obeyed him with  wifely meekness, but the daughters were not so easily ruled. Both were  keen-witted enough to feel the vulgarity of Sunday morning splendour. So  Belinda worshipped in the exaggerated simplicity of an unstarched jaconet  muslin, a yellow Liberty sash, a flopping Gainsborough hat, and a necklace of  Indian beads, an attire which attracted every eye, and was a source of wonder to  the whole congregation, while Alicia&rsquo;s neat grey cashmere frock, and smart  little toque to match, grey gloves, grey Prayer-book and sunshade, challenged  criticism as a study in monochrome.</p>
<p>Mr. Crowther would have lingered for farther  conversation before getting into the family landau, but Colonel Disney bade a  rather abrupt good morning to the whole group, and hurried his wife and sister  down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather sorry we accepted the Glenaveril  invitation,&rdquo; he said to Isola. &ldquo;The man is such an unmitigated cad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Crowther is very kind and good,&rdquo; replied his  wife; &ldquo;but I have never cared much about going to Glenaveril. I don&rsquo;t feel that  I get on particularly well with the girls. They are both too fine for me. But I  should be sorry to offend Mrs. Crowther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she seems a kindly creature. It was  thoughtful of her sending you a ticket for the ball. A woman with daughters is  seldom over-kind to outsiders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I believe Mrs. Crowther&rsquo;s heart is big enough  to be kind to a whole parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, on her account, perhaps it was best to  accept the invitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so grand about it, Martin,&rdquo; said Allegra.  &ldquo;You forget that I am pining to see what a dinner-party in a very rich house is  like. I have seen nothing in London but literary and artistic dinners,  third-rate literary and third-rate artistic, I&rsquo;m afraid &mdash; but they were very  nice, all the same. Glenaveril is a place that takes my breath away; and I am  curious to see what a dinner-party can be like there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then for your sake, Allegra, I&rsquo;m glad we said yes.  Only I couldn&rsquo;t stand that fellow patronizing you. Calling you a fine girl,  forsooth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is an odious phrase, is it not? I&rsquo;m afraid  I shall have to live through it, because, like Rosalind, &lsquo;I am more than common  tall.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew herself up to her full height, straight as  a reed, but with fully developed bust and shoulders which showed to advantage  in her pale tussore gown &mdash; silk that her brother had sent her from India. She  looked the incarnation of girlish innocence and girlish happiness &mdash; a brow  without a cloud, a step light as a fawn&rsquo;s &mdash; a fearless, joyous nature. Her more  commonplace features and finer figure were in curious contrast with Isola&rsquo;s  pensive beauty and too fragile form. Disney glanced from one to the other as he  walked along the rustic lane between them; and, though he thought his wife the  lovelier, he regretted that she was not more like his sister.</p>
<p>A man who is very fond of home and who has no  professional cares and occupations is apt to degenerate into a molly-coddle.  Martin Disney gave an indication of this weakness on the day before the dinner  at Glenaveril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you two girls going to wear?&rdquo; he asked.  &ldquo;At least, I don&rsquo;t think I need ask Isola that question. You&rsquo;ll wear your  wedding-gown, of course, love?&rdquo; he added, turning to his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Martin, I am going to wear my grey silk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grey! A dowager&rsquo;s colour, a soured spinster&rsquo;s  colour &mdash; a Quaker&rsquo;s no colour. I detest grey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but this is a very pretty gown &mdash; the palest  shade of pearl colour &mdash; and I wear pink roses with it. It was made in Paris. I  feel sure you will like me in it, Martin,&rdquo; Isola said hurriedly, as if even  this small matter fluttered her nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as well as I like you in your wedding-gown.  That was made in Paris, and it fitted you like a glove. I never saw such a  pretty gown &mdash; so simple, yet so elegant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been married much too long to dress as a  bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not seem as a bride &mdash; except to me. For  my eyes only shall you shine in bridal loveliness. Bride or no bride, what can  be prettier for a young woman than a white satin gown with a long train? You  can wear some touch of colour to show you have not got yourself up as a bride.  What do you say, Allegra? Give us your opinion. Of course you are an authority  upon dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the white satin, by all means. Isola looks  ethereal in white. She ought hardly ever to wear anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear, Isa. Two to one against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t be governed by your opinions in  this instance. You forget that I last wore my gown at a ball. I danced a good  deal &mdash; the floor was dirty &mdash; the gown was spoilt. I shall never wear it again.  I hope that will satisfy you, Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with a touch of temper, her cheeks  flushed crimson, and her eyes filled with sudden tears as she looked  deprecatingly at her husband. Martin Disney felt himself a brute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest, I didn&rsquo;t mean to tease you,&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;wear anything you like. You are sure to be the prettiest woman in the room. I  am sorry the gown was spoilt; but it can&rsquo;t be helped. I&rsquo;ll buy you another  white satin gown the first time you and I are in Plymouth together. And, pray,  Miss Allegra, what bravery will you sport?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only a white lace frock that has seen some  service,&rdquo; replied his sister, meekly. &ldquo;I dare say I shall look like somebody&rsquo;s  poor relation at such a place as Glenaveril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not to be a grand party, by any means.  Mrs. Crowther told me she had asked the Baynhams and the Vicarage people to  meet us, just in a friendly way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party was decidedly small, for on arriving with  reasonable punctuality the Disneys found only one guest on the scene, in the  person of Mr. Colfox, the curate, who was sitting by one of the little tables,  showing a new puzzle of two pieces of interlinked iron to the two Misses  Crowther. These young ladies were so interested in the trick of disentanglement  that they scarcely noticed the entrance of their mother&rsquo;s guests, and only rose  and came over to greet the party three minutes later, as an afterthought.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Crowther, however, were both upon the  alert to receive their friends, the lady frankly cordial, the gentleman  swelling with pompous friendliness, as if his manly breast were trying to  emerge from the moderate restriction of a very open waistcoat. He protested  that he was charmed to welcome Colonel Disney to Glenaveril, and he glanced  round the splendid walls as who should say, &ldquo;It is no light thing to invite  people to such a house as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vansittart Crowther was a man of short, squat  figure, who tried to make up for the want of inches by extreme uprightness, and  had cultivated this carriage until he seemed incapable of bending. He had a  bald head, disguised by one dappled streak of grey and sandy hair, which was  plastered into a curl on each side of his brow &mdash; curls faintly suggestive of a cat&rsquo;s  ears. He had blunt features, a sensual lip, and dull, fishy eyes, large and  protuberant, with an expression in perfect harmony with the heavy, sensual  mouth.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Baynham were the next arrivals; the  lady wearing the family amethysts and the well-known black velvet, under whose  weighty splendour she arrived short of breath; the gentleman expansive of shirt  front, and genial of aspect, jovial at the prospect of a good dinner and choice  wines, and not hypercritical as to the company in which he ate the feast. He  shook hands with his host and hostess, and then went over to the Misses  Crowther, who had not thought it necessary to suspend their absorbing  occupation in order to welcome the village doctor&rsquo;s wife &mdash; a fact which Mrs.  Baynham observed and inwardly resented.</p>
<p>Mr. Colfox deserted the young ladies, still  puzzling over the two bits of iron, and went across the room to greet the  Disneys. He was an intelligent young man, steeped to the lips in the opinions  and the prejudices of university life &mdash; Oxford life, that is to say. He ranked  as a literary man in Trelasco, on the strength of having had an article almost  published in Blackwood. &ldquo;The editor had accepted my paper,&rdquo; he told people  modestly; &ldquo;but on further consideration he found it was a little too long, and  so, in point of fact, he sent it back to me in the most courteous manner. He  couldn&rsquo;t have acted more kindly &mdash; but I was disappointed. It would have been  such an opening, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All Mr. Colfox&rsquo;s friends agreed that with such an  opening the high road to literary fame and fortune would have been made smooth  for his feet. They respected him even for this disappointment. To have been  accepted by Blackwood made him almost a colleague of George Eliot.</p>
<p>He was a tall and rather lean young man, who wore  an eye-glass, and seemed to live upon books. It was irritating to Vansittart  Crowther, who prided himself on his cellar and his cook, to note how little  impression food and drink made upon Francis Colfox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He takes my Ch&acirc;teau Yquem as if it were Devonshire  cider,&rdquo; said the aggrieved parvenu, &ldquo;and he hardly seems to know that this is  the only house where he ever sees clear turtle. The man&rsquo;s people must have  lived in a very poor way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of this contemptuous opinion, Mr. Crowther  was always polite to Francis Colfox, and had even thought of him as a <em>pis-aller</em> for one of his daughters.  There is hardly anything in this life which a self-made man respects so much as  race, and Francis Colfox belonged to an old county family, had a cousin who was  an earl, and another cousin who was talked of as a probable bishop. He was,  therefore, allowed to make himself very much at home at Glenaveril, and to  speak his mind in a somewhat audacious way to the whole family.</p>
<p>Captain Pentreath, an army man of uncertain age, a  bachelor, and one of a territorial family of many brothers, came next; and then  appeared the vicar and his wife and one daughter, who made up the party. The  vicar was deaf, but amiable, and beamed benevolently upon a world about whose  spoken opinions he knew so little that he might naturally have taken it for a  much better world than it is. The vicar&rsquo;s wife spent her existence in  interpreting and explaining people&rsquo;s speech to the vicar, and had no time to  spare for opinions of her own. The daughter was characterized by a gentle  nullity, tempered by a somewhat enthusiastic and evangelical piety. The chief  desire of her life was to keep the Church as it had been in the days of her  childhood, nearly thirty years before.</p>
<p>It was the first time the Disneys had dined  together at Glenaveril, so it seemed only proper that Mr. Crowther should give  his arm to Isola, which he did with an air of conferring an honour. The colonel  had been ordered to take the vicar&rsquo;s wife, and the doctor was given to Allegra;  Captain Pentreath took Miss Trequite, the vicar&rsquo;s daughter; Mr. Colfox followed  with Mrs. Baynham, and the daughters of the house went modestly to the  dining-room after the vicar and Mrs. Crowther.</p>
<p>The dinner-table was as pretty as roses and  Venetian glass could make it. There was no pompous display of ponderous plate,  as there might have been thirty years ago on a parvenu&rsquo;s board. Everybody is  enlightened nowadays. The great &ldquo;culture&rdquo; movement has been as widespread among  the middle class as compulsory education among the proletariat, and everybody  has &ldquo;a taste.&rdquo; Scarcely were they seated, when Mr. Crowther informed Mrs.  Disney that he hated a display of silver, but at the same time took care to let  her know that the Venetian glass she admired was rather more valuable than that  precious metal. &ldquo;And if it&rsquo;s broken, there&rsquo;s nothing left you for your outlay,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a fancy of my wife and girls. Those decanters are better  than anything Salviati ever made for Royalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The table was oval, lighted by one large lamp,  under an umbrella-shaped amber shade, a lamp which diffused a faint golden glow  through the dusky room; and through this dreamy dimness the footmen moved like  ghosts, while the table and the faces of the diners shone and sparkled in the  brilliant light. It was as picturesque a dining-room and table as one need care  to see; and if the Gainsboroughs and Reynoldses, which here and there relieved  the sombre russet of the Cordovan leather hangings, were not the portraits of  Mr. and Mrs. Crowther&rsquo;s ancestors, they were not the less lovely or interesting  as works of art.</p>
<p>Isola sat by her host&rsquo;s side, with a silent and  somewhat embarrassed air, which her husband noted as he watched her from the  other side of the table.</p>
<p>All the decorations were low, so that no pyramid of  fruit or flowers intervened to prevent a man watching the face opposite to him.  Disney saw that while Allegra, in her place between Mr. Baynham and Alicia  Crowther, was full of talk and animation, Isola sat with downcast eyes, and  replied with a troubled look to her host&rsquo;s remarks. There was something in that  gentleman&rsquo;s manner which was particularly obnoxious to the colonel &mdash; a  protecting air, a fatherly familiarity, which brought the bald, shining  forehead almost in contact with Isola&rsquo;s shoulder, as the man bent to whisper  and to titter in the very ear of his neighbour.</p>
<p>The colonel got through a little duty talk with  Mrs. Trequite, whose attention was frequently distracted by the necessity of  explaining Mrs. Crowther&rsquo;s polite murmurs to the vicar on the other side of the  table; and this duty done he gave himself up to watching Isola and her host.  Why did she blush so when the man talked to her? Was it the bold admiration of  those fishy eyes which annoyed her, or the man&rsquo;s manner altogether; or was it  anything that he said? Disney strained his ears to hear their conversation, if  that could be called conversation which was for the most part monologue.</p>
<p>The man was talking of the Hunt Ball of last  winter. Disney heard such snatches of speech as &ldquo;the prettiest woman in the  room,&rdquo; &ldquo;everybody said so,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lostwithiel was evidently <em>&eacute;pris</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Crowther had a penchant for scraps of French,  which decorated his speech as truffles adorn a boned turkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it odd that he should be such a rover?&rdquo; he  asked, in a less confidential tone than before.</p>
<p>Isola looked up at him, as if hardly understanding  the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean Lostwithiel. With such a nice place as he  has here, it seems a pity to be broiling himself in Peru. I never could  understand the taste for orchids; and in his case &mdash; well, I hardly believe in  it. He is the last man to emulate a Hooker or a Lawrence. Orchid-hunting must  be an excuse for keeping away from England, I take it. Don&rsquo;t you think so, now,  Mrs. Disney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know why he should want to keep away?  No, no more does anybody else. Only we all wonder, don&rsquo;t you know. He talked to  me of settling down in the county &mdash; looking after the estate a little. He even  hinted that he might, in due course, cast about for a nice young wife &mdash; with a  little money. And then all of a sudden off he sails in that rakish yacht of  his, and roves from port to port like the Flying Dutchman in the Opera, till at  last we hear of him on the coast of Peru. Curious, ain&rsquo;t it, Mrs. Disney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why curious?&rdquo; asked Isola, coldly. &ldquo;Was not Lord  Lostwithiel always fond of yachting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt; but when a man talks of settling down in  his native place &mdash; and then doesn&rsquo;t do it &mdash; there must be a reason, mustn&rsquo;t  there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. People act as often from caprice as  from reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is a lady&rsquo;s idea. No man who is worthy  the name ever acts from caprice,&rdquo; said Mr. Crowther, with his insinuating air,  as if some hidden meaning were in the words, and then looking across the table  and seeing the colonel&rsquo;s watchful face, he altered both tone and manner as he  added, &ldquo;Of course you know Lostwithiel, Colonel Disney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a good deal of Lord Lostwithiel when he was  a small boy,&rdquo; answered the colonel, coldly. &ldquo;His father was one of my early  friends. But that is a long time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old is he, do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Debrett will answer that question better than I  can. I have never reckoned the years that have gone by since I saw him in an  Eton collar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men did not sit long over their wine. The  doctor and his host talked agriculture, Mr. Crowther discussing all farming  operations upon a large scale as became a man of territorial magnitude. The  vicar prosed about an approaching lecture at the schoolroom, and utterly failed  in hearing anything that was said in reply to his observations. Colonel Disney  smoked a cigarette in silence, and with a moody brow.</p>
<p>Later, in the drawing-room, while the Crowther  girls were playing a clamorous duet, by the last fashionable Sclavonic  composer, Vansittart Crowther directed his conversation almost wholly to Mrs.  Disney, as if she were the only person worthy of his attention. He was full of  suggestions for future gaieties in which the Disneys were to share &mdash; picnics,  boating parties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must help us to wake up the neighbourhood,  colonel,&rdquo; he said, addressing Disney, with easy friendliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not very likely to be of much assistance to  you in that line,&rdquo; Disney answered coldly. &ldquo;We are quiet stay-at-home people,  my wife and I, and take our pleasures on a very small scale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Disney&rsquo;s carriage was announced at this  moment. He gave his wife a look which plainly indicated his wish to depart, and  she rose quickly from the low, deep chair in which she had been sitting, in  some manner a captive, while Mr. Crowther lolled across the broad,  plush-cushioned arm to talk to her. Allegra was engrossed in a talk about  William Morris&rsquo;s last poem with Mr. Colfox, who was delighted to converse with  any one fresh from the far-away world of art and literature &mdash; delighted  altogether with Allegra, whose whole being presented a piquant contrast to the  Miss Crowthers. But the colonel&rsquo;s sister saw the movement towards departure,  and hastened to her brother&rsquo;s side. Briefest adieux followed, and the first of  the guests being gone, left behind them a feeling of uneasiness in those whose  carriages had been ordered half an hour later. One premature departure will  cast a blight upon your small dull party; whereas from a scene of real mirth  the nine Muses and three Graces might all slip away unmissed and unobserved.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  &ldquo;Of The Weak My Heart Is Weakest&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You had better send cards to Mrs. Crowther,  Isola,&rdquo; said Martin Disney, two days afterwards, when his wife was sitting at  her Davenport writing her family letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cards! Oh, Martin, she would think that so very  formal. I can call upon her. She is always at home on Thursday afternoons, and  she likes me to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for that, since I had rather you should  never enter her house again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say against Mrs. Crowther, my  dear Isola. But the man is more detestable than I could have believed low birth  and unlimited money could make any man. Guileless and inexperienced as you are,  I think you must have felt that his manner to you the other night was familiar  to the point of being insulting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola had felt both embarrassed and distressed by  her host&rsquo;s attentions &mdash; the insinuating inflections of his fat, pompous voice;  his air of being upon a confidential footing with her. It had seemed to her on  that evening as if for the first time in her life, before the eyes of men and  women, she drank the cup of shame. She had said no word to her husband of Mr.  Crowther&rsquo;s oppressive familiarity, and she had fondly hoped that the matter had  escaped his notice.</p>
<p>She sat before him now, flushed and agitated, with  lowered eyelids, and one hand restlessly moving about the papers on her  blotting-pad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest, there is nothing in all this to  distress you,&rdquo; said Disney, with infinite gentleness. &ldquo;It is not your fault  that the man is a cad; but it would be my fault if I were to allow you or  Allegra to go to his house again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not rude to Allegra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it would be her turn next, perhaps. He did not  mean to be rude to you. He only wanted to be especially polite in his own  odious fashion. There are men in that class who cannot behave decently to a  pretty woman, or civilly to a plain one. He meant no doubt to gratify you by  his compliments. What a stress he laid upon Lostwithiel&rsquo;s attention to you at  the ball. Were his attentions so very marked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; not more to me than to others,&rdquo; Isola  answered quickly. &ldquo;He danced a good many times &mdash; twice or three times &mdash; with  Belinda Crowther. Everybody noticed them as the handsomest couple in the room;  not that he is handsome, of course &mdash; only tall and distinguished-looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allegra came running in from the garden, and broke  the thread of the conversation. Isola put the visiting-cards into an envelope  and addressed it to Mrs. Vansittart Crowther. She felt that the kindly matron  would be puzzled and vexed at this ceremony, from a young person towards whom  she had assumed so motherly a tone, urging her to run over to Glenaveril at any  hour of the day &mdash; asking her to lunch or to tea at least once a week &mdash; wanting  to take her for drives to Lostwithiel, or railway jaunts to Plymouth.</p>
<p>Isola was not mistaken, for Mrs. Crowther called  three or four days afterwards and upbraided her for sending the cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have all come to tea on Thursday, if you  had been good-natured,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Colfox read us a poem by Swinburne, out  of one of the new magazines &mdash; there are so many nowadays that I never remember  which is which. Belinda was delighted with it &mdash; but Alicia and I can&rsquo;t rise to  her height. Mr. Colfox reads poetry beautifully. You can&rsquo;t judge of his powers  by only hearing him read the lessons,&rdquo; added Mrs. Crowther, as if the English  Bible were a poor thing.</p>
<p>She stopped an hour, praised Isola&rsquo;s tea-making and  the new cook&rsquo;s tea-cakes, asked a great many questions about Allegra&rsquo;s ideas  and occupations, and was as hearty, and simple, and friendly, and natural as if  she had been a duchess.</p>
<p>It grieved Isola to be obliged to refuse an  invitation to luncheon, most cordially pressed upon her and Allegra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would drive you both to Lostwithiel after lunch,  and we could do our little bit of shopping and then have a cup of tea at the  Talbot while the horses had their mouths washed out, and I&rsquo;d show you the room  where your brother&rsquo;s wife was so much admired last year, Miss Leland, and where  I hope you&rsquo;ll have many a good dance next winter. Now the ice is broken we mean  to go on with our balls, I can tell you. Indeed, my girls are thinking of  trying to get up a tennis-club ball about the end of September.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the last time Mrs. Vansittart Crowther  appeared in a friendly manner at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest, for after two or three  further invitations &mdash; to a picnic &mdash; to tea &mdash; to lunch &mdash; had been declined, in  most gracious little notes from Isola, that good lady perceived that there was  some kind of barrier to friendly intercourse between her and Colonel Disney&rsquo;s  wife, and she told herself with some touch of honest middle-class dignity that  if Martin Disney was proud she could be proud too, and that she would make no  further offer of friendship which was undesired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he thinks because he comes of a good old  family, while we have made our money in trade, that we are not quite good  enough to associate with his wife and sister,&rdquo; she said to her daughters. &ldquo;I  thought he was too much of a gentleman to have such a petty feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How innocent you are, mother,&rdquo; cried Alicia,  contemptuously; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you see that they are all bursting with envy? That was  what made the colonel so gloomy and disagreeable the night of our little  dinner. He was vexed to see things done with as good taste as in a nobleman&rsquo;s  house. It cuts these poor gentilities to the quick to see that. They don&rsquo;t much  mind our being rich, if we will only be vulgar and uneducated. But when we have  the impertinence to be as well up in the ways of good society as they are themselves,  they can&rsquo;t forgive us. Good taste in a parvenu is the unforgivable sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; mused Mrs. Crowther, sadly.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s neither pride nor envy in Isola, and Miss Leland looks a  frank, straightforward girl, above all foolish nonsense; so it must be the  colonel&rsquo;s fault that they&rsquo;ve cut us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut us!&rdquo; echoed Belinda; &ldquo;the Angler&rsquo;s Nest  cutting Glenaveril is rather too absurd an idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, you don&rsquo;t know the importance Cornish  people attach to old family &mdash; and the Disneys are a very old family &mdash; and no  one can deny that he is a gentleman, though we don&rsquo;t like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no doubt he considers that he belongs to the  landed gentry. He has bought Rowe&rsquo;s farm, two hundred and sixty acres. He had  forty to begin with, so he is now lord of three hundred acres, just half our  home farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His cousin, Sir Luke Disney, has a large estate  near Marazion,&rdquo; said Mrs. Crowther, meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we don&rsquo;t reckon a man&rsquo;s importance by his  cousin&rsquo;s estate. Colonel Disney is only a squatter in this part of the  country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alicia pronounced the word with gusto. It had been  whispered to her that the squire of Fowey had spoken of her father &mdash; who  counted his acres by thousands &mdash; as a squatter. That unimpeachable importance,  founded upon the established respectability of bygone centuries &mdash; centuries in  which men wore armour and women breakfasted on beef and ale &mdash; was not to be  bought with gold and silver, and the want of it often made the Miss Crowthers  angry. Diamonds they could have, and land, art, and beauty, even the ways and  manners of good society, but they could not buy themselves a history. Everybody  knew that their splendours had all come out of a cloth mill, that their ingots  had been in some part transmuted from pestiferous woollen rags gathered in the  Jewish quarters of far-off cities, ground into shoddy, and anon issued to the  world as sleek superfine cloth. The more shoddy the higher interest upon  capital; and Vansittart Crowther&rsquo;s daughters knew too many of the secrets of  the mills to be proud of the source of their prosperity.</p>
<p>Mrs. Crowther was sorry to lose Isola as a friend  and <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</em>. Her daughters were  furious at the slight implied in this gradual dropping away. They passed Mrs.  Disney and her sister-in-law with their noses in the air, as they went from the  church-porch to their carriage. They cut them ostentatiously if they met on the  quiet country roads. Mrs. Crowther would still stop to speak and shake hands,  albeit she urged no further invitations.</p>
<p>And while the gulf widened between the great house  and the small one the glorious Cornish summer waned, and slowly, slowly, melted  away, lingering very late in that fair western land, which was full of flowers  even when the home counties were being withered and blackened by the first  frosts. At last came winter, and the gradual turn of the year; short days  slowly lengthening out by leisurely sunsets; pale snowdrops glimmering in the  borders; and then the gold of crocuses and the bright blue of the Siberian  bell-flower in patches of vivid colour; and then hyacinths and tulips,  primroses on every bank, narcissus and jonquil in every garden; and by-and-by  the full glory of bluebell and hawthorn blossom. And anon in the middle of May  came an event in which all the interests of Colonel Disney&rsquo;s life seemed to  culminate. In that balmy Maytime Isola&rsquo;s firstborn son came into the world, and  Isola&rsquo;s young life hovered at the gate of death, in so terrible an uncertainty  that Martin Disney&rsquo;s hair grew grey while he awaited the issue of the contest  between youth and weakness.</p>
<p>For more than a week after the birth of her baby  Isola&rsquo;s condition had satisfied the trained nurse and the kindly doctor. She  was very white and weak, and she showed less interest in her baby than most  young mothers &mdash; a fact which Mr. Baynham ascribed to over-education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young women of the present day aren&rsquo;t half  such good mothers as those I used to attend when I began practice,&rdquo; he said  discontentedly. &ldquo;Their heads are stuffed with poetry, and such-like. They&rsquo;re  nervous and fanciful &mdash; and the upshot of it all is that babies have to be  wet-nursed or brought up by hand. If I had the government of a model state I  wouldn&rsquo;t allow any married woman the run of a library until she had reared the  last of her babies. What does a young married woman want with book-learning?  She ought to have enough to do to look after her husband and her nursery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the baby son was a fortnight old, fever  supervened, and Isola&rsquo;s state gave poor Mr. Baynham the keenest anxiety. A  hospital nurse was sent for to assist the established custodian; and a great  authority was brought over from Plymouth to approve the village doctor&rsquo;s  treatment, and to make a trifling alteration in a prescription, substituting  bromide of sodium for bromide of potassium.</p>
<p>Many days and nights of delirium followed the  physician&rsquo;s visit, a period in which the patient was watched at every hour of  the day and night; and one of the most constant watchers through all that  dreary time was Martin Disney. It was in vain that Allegra and the nurses urged  him to consider his own health. He would consent only to leave the sick-room  for briefest intervals of rest. Day after day, night after night, he sat in the  same chair &mdash; an old-fashioned armchair, with projecting sides, which almost hid  him from the patient &mdash; beside the bed. He was never in the way of the nurse. He  was always helpful when a man&rsquo;s help was needed. He was so quiet that it was  impossible to object to his presence. He sat there like a statue of patience.  No moan escaped his pallid lips; no tear stole down his haggard cheek. He sat  and watched and waited for the issue, which was to make him happy, or desolate  for ever.</p>
<p>All his future was involved in that issue. He  looked with a faint smile upon the pink little baby face, when they brought his  son to him. No one would have dared to suggest that he should take care of  himself and be comforted for that little one&rsquo;s sake. They all knew that his  firstborn was as nothing to him. All his hopes and all his fears were centred  in the wife who lay upon yonder bed, with glassy eyes and babbling lips, a  wanderer in a world full of torturing images &mdash; fountains of bubbling water  which she longed to drink &mdash; great black serpents, which came crawling in at the  window, and creeping nearer, nearer to her bed &mdash; wriggling, hideous forms that  hemmed her in on every side &mdash; giant staircases that she was always trying to  climb &mdash; mammoth caves in which she lost herself, fifty times bigger and more  awful than those serpentine caverns near the Lizard, which she and Allegra had  explored in the previous autumn &mdash; steeper, stonier than the tall cliffs and  pinnacled rocks above Bedruthan sands.</p>
<p>Day after day, night after night, Martin Disney sat  in his place and listened to those ravings of a mind distraught. He could not  keep himself from trying to follow her in that labyrinth of disconnected  fancies &mdash; visions of shapeless horror, trouble, confusion &mdash; a wild babbling of  numbers, prattling of millions, billions, trillions &mdash; as if her days of health  and sense had been spent in the calculations of a Rothschild, she who could  scarcely reckon the simplest account in a tradesman&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>What had she to do with this torturing recital of  thousands and millions, this everlasting heaping up of figures?</p>
<p>Then at another period of that long struggle  between life and death, reason and unreason, she had a ghastly vision of two  children, squatting on each side of her bed, one living, the other dead, a  grisly child with throat cut from ear to ear. Again and again she implored them  to take away those babies &mdash; the dead child whose horrid aspect froze her blood  &mdash; the living child that grinned and made faces at her.</p>
<p>Once and once only during that season of delirium  the elder of her nurses carried the baby to her bedside, the tiny form in snowy  cambric and lace, a little roseate face, on which the first glimmer of  intelligence was already dawning, sweet blue eyes that smiled at the light,  rosebud lips that invited kisses. The nurse took the infant to the side of the  bed, and asked the young mother to look at him. Those fever-bright eyes stared  at the sweet small face with a gaze of ever-growing horror, and then with a  wild shriek Isola clasped her hands before her eyes, and drew herself cowering  to the further side of the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dead child!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why do you show me  that dead child? Don&rsquo;t you see his throat streaming with blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a case in which the nurses had no easy duty  by day or night; and there were times when Disney insisted that the night-nurse  should have extra rest, while he kept guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if she should be very bad, sir, you might not  be able to manage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I should. My sister is a very light  sleeper. She would come to me in a moment, and she has a great deal of  influence with my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was true. From the beginning of evil Allegra&rsquo;s  presence had exercised a soothing power. She had been able to lull the patient  to sleep sometimes, when opiates had failed to produce even fitful slumber.  Isola was calmer and less restless when her sister-in-law was by her side.</p>
<p>In those long night watches, sometimes in solitude,  Martin Disney had ample leisure in which to ponder upon his wedded life, and to  consider how far the hopes with which he had entered upon that life had been  realized. The retrospect left him melancholy, and with a latent sense of loss  and disappointment; and yet he told himself again and again that he did ill to  be dissatisfied, that Providence had dealt kindly with him.</p>
<p>At five and forty years of age, he, Martin Disney,  of modest fortune and social status, and of no especial claim to be admired,  intellectual or physical, had won the hand of a lovely and interesting girl. He  had been so bewildered and overcome by the delight of his conquest, that he had  entered upon no laborious process of self-examination before he took to himself  this fair and winning partner. It had been enough for him that she came to him  willingly, lovingly, in all truth and girlish simplicity, loyal as she was  pure. He had never asked himself could such an attachment last &mdash; on her side?  It had been enough for him that the love existed. It would be his duty and his  delight to strengthen the bond, to draw that fair spirit into closer union with  his own. He had felt no shadow of fear for the future. Once having won her, it  must be easy to keep his treasure &mdash; easy for him who would so faithfully guard  and cherish this priceless gift of a benign Providence. He was a man of deep  religious feeling &mdash; a man who recognized in good and evil, in joy and in  sorrow, the dealings of an Almighty God with His short-sighted creatures. He  accepted his happiness in fear and trembling, knowing the instability of all  mortal joys; but he had never feared the loss of Isola&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Yet now, sitting in the deep of night beside that  bed which might be the bed of death, he told himself that his wife&rsquo;s love was  lost to him, had been lost from the hour of his return to Trelasco, when he  went back to her with all the enthusiasm of a lover, forgetful of his mature  years, of his long experience of life &mdash; hard fighting, hard knocks of all kinds  in the great life-battle.</p>
<p>He had gone back to her as Leander to Hero, a boy  in heart and hopefulness; and what had he found in her? A placid, obedient  wife, gentle almost to apathy, but with a strain of melancholy underlying all  their relations which his devoted love could not conquer.</p>
<p>To all his interrogations her answer had been the  same. She was not unhappy. She had everything in life that she desired. There  was nothing that he could give her, no possible change in their existence which  could add to her content. All this should mean domestic peace, a heart at ease;  yet all this was unsatisfying to Martin Disney; for his instinct told him that  his wife was not happy &mdash; that the element of gladness was, for some inscrutable  reason, banished from her life.</p>
<p>She had seemed happier, or at least the little home  had been brighter and gayer after Allegra&rsquo;s coming; but as the time wore on it  became clear to him that the life and gaiety were all in Allegra herself, and  that Isola was spiritless and depressed. It was as if the spring of her life  had snapped suddenly, and left her nerveless and joyless, a submissive,  unhopeful creature. That sense of disappointment and loss which he had dimly  felt, even when his home-coming had been a new thing, had grown and deepened  with the passage of time. He had bought his land; he had added to the space and  comfort of his house; he had enlarged the stables, and bought a couple of  hunters, and a cob for harness; and while these things had been doing, the  activity of his days, the fuss and labour of arrangement and supervision, had  occupied his mind so pleasantly as to stifle those growing doubts for the time  being. But when all was done; when the vine and the figtree had been planted,  and he sat down to take his ease in their shade, then he began to feel very  keenly that his wife&rsquo;s part in all that he had done was the part of submission  only. She liked this or that because he liked it. She was content, and that was  all. And the line between contentment and resignation is so faint a demarcation  that it seemed to him sometimes as if she were only resigned, as if she  suffered life rather than lived &mdash; suffered life as holy women suffer some slow,  wasting disease, in meek subjection to a mysterious decree.</p>
<p>He sat beside her bed, while she battled with all  the demons of delirium; and he wondered whether &mdash; when she had been at her  best, when her mind had been brightest and clearest &mdash; she had been any nearer  to him than she was now in her madness; whether he had known any more of her  inner self &mdash; the mystery of her heart and conscience &mdash; than he knew now, while  those wild eyes stared at him without sight or knowledge.</p>
<p>One summer morning, as he sat alone in his watch in  that dull interval between darkness and dawn, the visions of the wandering mind  took a more consecutive form than usual. She fancied herself in a storm at sea.  The waves were rolling mountains high &mdash; were bearing down upon her with  threatenings of instant death. She feared, and yet she courted the danger. In  one minute she was recoiling from the wild rush of waters, clinging  distractedly to the brass rail at the head of her bed, crouching against the  wall as if to save herself from an advancing wave; and in the next minute she  sprang out of bed, and rushed to the open window, wanting to throw herself out  of it. Disney was only just quick enough to seize her in his arms, and carry  her back to bed. He held her there, battling with him in a vehement effort to  escape from his restraining arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you stop me?&rdquo; she cried, looking at him  fiercely with her distracted eyes. &ldquo;What else is there for me? What other  refuge? what other hope? Let me go! let me go! Cruel! cruel! cruel! Let me  throw myself into the sea! Don&rsquo;t you understand? Oh, cruel! cruel! Cold and  wicked, shameless and cruel! There is nothing else &mdash; only that refuge left! Let  me hide myself in death! let me hide &mdash; hide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice rose to a shriek; and both the nurse and  Allegra came hurrying in. The faint white dawn shone upon her livid face and on  the scarlet spot upon each hollow cheek. Her eyes stared wildly, starting from  their sockets in that paroxysm of her madness.</p>
<p>Only a few days after that night of terror Isola  was lying calm as a child. The fever had gone down &mdash; the enfeebled constitution  had at last answered to the influence of medicine; and gradually, like the slow  lifting of the darkness after a long night of cloud and fog, consciousness and  reason came back. Sleep soothed the strained and weary nerves, and the  exhausted frame, which a few days before had seemed endowed with a superhuman  strength, lay like a log upon the bed of sickness.</p>
<p>Recovery was slow, but there was no relapse. Slow  as the dawning of day to the tired watcher, after the long, blank night, there  came the dawn of maternal love. The young mother began to take delight in her  child; and it was rapture to Martin Disney to see her sitting opposite him  under the tulip-tree, in the low Madeira chair, with her baby in her lap.  Allegra vied with her in her devotion to that over-praised infant; while the  Shah and Tim, of the same opinion for the first time in their lives, were  almost rabid with jealousy.</p>
<p>They all lived in the garden in that happy summer  season, as they had done the year before, when Allegra first came among them.  It was in the garden they received their visitors, and it was there that Mr.  Colfox came at least thrice a week, upon the flimsiest pretexts of parish  business, to drink tea poured out for him by Allegra&rsquo;s helpful hands, while  Isola sat quietly by, listening to their talk, and watching every change in her  child&rsquo;s face; from smiles to frowns, from slumber to waking.</p>
<p>Allegra had taken kindly to parish work, and, in  Mr. Colfox&rsquo;s own phraseology, was a tower of strength to him in his labours  among the poor of Trelasco. She had started a series of mothers&rsquo; meetings in  the winter afternoons, and had read to the women and girls while they worked,  helping them a good deal with their work into the bargain. She had done wonders  at penny readings, singing, reciting, drawing lightning caricatures of local  celebrities with bits of coloured chalk on rough white paper. Her portrait of  Vansittart Crowther had been applauded to the echo, although it was not a  flattering portrait. She had visited the sick; she had taught in the night  school. The curate had been enthusiastic in his appreciation of her, and his  praises had been listened to contemptuously by the two Miss Crowthers, each of  whom at different periods had taken up these good works, only to drop them  again after the briefest effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will get tired as soon as we did,&rdquo; said  Alicia, &ldquo;when she finds out how impossible these creatures are &mdash; unless she has  an ulterior motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ulterior motive should she have?&rdquo; asked  Colfox, bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can tell? She may want to get herself talked  about. As Miss Leland, of the Angler&rsquo;s Nest, a sort of useful companion to her  brother&rsquo;s wife, she is a nobody. If she can get a reputation for piety and  philanthropy, that will be better than nothing. Or she may be only angling for  a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you knew her as well as I do you would know  that she is above all trivial and selfish motives, and that she is good to  these people because her heart has gone out to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you see we don&rsquo;t know her. Her brother has  chosen to hold himself aloof from Glenaveril; and I must say I am very glad he  has taken that line &mdash; for more than one reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any of your reasons concern Miss Leland you are  very much mistaken in under-rating her. You could not have had a more  delightful companion,&rdquo; said Mr. Colfox, with some warmth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we all know that you have exalted her into a  heroine &mdash; a St. John&rsquo;s Wood St. Helena. But she is a little too unconventional  for my taste; though I certainly would rather be intimate with her than with  her sister-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you have no fault to find with that most  gentle creature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is just a little too gentle for my taste,&rdquo;  replied Alicia, who usually took upon herself all expression of opinion, while  Belinda fanned herself languidly, in an &aelig;sthetic attitude, feeling that her chief  mission in this life was to sit still and look like <em>la belle dame sans merci</em>. &ldquo;She is just as much too quiet as Miss  Leland is too boisterous. I have no liking for pensive young women who cast  down their eyelids at the slightest provocation, and are only animated when  they are flirting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tongue is a little member,&rdquo; quoted Mr. Colfox,  taking up his hat, and holding out his hand in adieu.</p>
<p>He was very unceremonious to these fair  parishioners of his, and talked to them as freely as if he had been an old  French Abb&eacute; in a country village. It is needless to say that they valued his  opinion so much the more because he was entirely unaffected by their wealth or  their good looks. They were naturally aggrieved at his marked admiration for  Miss Leland.</p>
<p>Those ripe months of harvest and vintage, July,  August, and September, passed like a blissful dream for Martin Disney. He had  snatched his darling from the jaws of death. He had her once more &mdash; fair to  look upon, with sweet, smiling mouth and pensive eyes; and she was so tender  and so loving to him, in fond gratitude for his devotion during her illness, so  seemingly happy in their mutual love for their child, that he forgot all those  aching fears which had gnawed his heart while he sat by her pillow through the  long anxious nights &mdash; forgot that he had ever doubted her, or remembered his  doubts only to scorn himself as a morbid, jealous fool. Could he doubt her, who  was candour and innocence personified? Could he think for an instant that all  those sweet, loving ways and looks of hers which beautified his commonplace  existence, were so much acting &mdash; and that her heart was not his? No! True love  has an unmistakable language; and true love spoke to him in every word and tone  of his wife&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The child made so close a bond between them. Both  lives were seemingly bound and entwined about this fragile life of Isola&rsquo;s  firstborn. Mr. Baynham had no reason now to complain of his patient&rsquo;s want of  the maternal instinct. He had rather to restrain her in her devotion to the child.  He had to reprove her for her sleepless nights and morbid anxieties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think your baby will grow any the faster or  stronger for your lying awake half the night worrying yourself about him?&rdquo; said  the doctor, with his cheery bluntness. &ldquo;He has a capital nurse &mdash; one of those  excellent cow-women, who are specially created to rear other people&rsquo;s babies;  and he has a doctor who is not quite a fool about infant maladies. Read your  novels, Mrs. Disney, and keep up your good looks; or else twenty years hence  you will see your son blushing when he hears his mother mistaken for his  grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After giving his patient this advice, Mr. Baynham  told his wife, in confidence, that were anything to happen to the little one,  Isola Disney would go off her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she is sadly hysterical,&rdquo; replied Mrs.  Baynham. &ldquo;I am very fond of her, you know, Tom; but I have never been able to  understand her. I can&rsquo;t make out a young woman who has a pretty house and an  indulgent husband, and who never seems quite happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every woman can&rsquo;t have your genial disposition,  Belle,&rdquo; answered the doctor, admiringly. &ldquo;Perpetual sunshine is the rarest  thing in Nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The early western harvest had been gathered in.  Upland and valley in that undulating land were clothed with the tawny hue of  the stubble. Here and there the plough horses were moving slowly along the red  ridges on the steep hillside. No touch of frost had dulled the rich hues of the  autumnal flowers, and the red carnations still glowed in every cottage garden,  while the pale pink trusses of hydrangea filled all the shrubberies with  beauty. A keener breath came up at eventide from the salt sea beyond Point  Neptune, and wilder winds crept across the inland valleys with the on-coming of  night. Summer and the swallows were gone. October, a balmy season for the most  part, was at hand; and there were no more tea-drinkings and afternoon  gossipings in the garden at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest. The lamps were lighted before  dinner. The evenings were spent in the old library and the new drawing-room,  the new room communicating with the old one by a curtained archway, so that of  a night the curtains could be drawn back and Martin Disney could sit among his  books by the fireplace in the library, and yet be within conversational reach  of Isola and Allegra in the drawing-room, where they had piano and table-easel,  work-baskets, and occupations of all kinds.</p>
<p>Mr. Colfox sometimes dropped in of an evening, on  parish business of course, took a cup of coffee, listened while Allegra played  one of Mozart&rsquo;s sonatas or sang a song by Gluck or Haydn or Handel. Mr. Colfox  was not one of the advanced people who despise Mozart or Handel. Nor did he  look down upon Haydn. Indeed, he sat and stroked his thin legs with a sheepish  appreciation, wrinkling up his loose trousers, and showing a large amount of  stocking, while Allegra sang &ldquo;My mother bids me bind my hair,&rdquo; in her clear,  strong mezzo-soprano, which was of infinite use to him in his choir.</p>
<p>He told everybody that Martin Disney&rsquo;s was an ideal  household &mdash; a home into which it was a privilege to be admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I never knew the beauty of domestic  life till I knew the Angler&rsquo;s Nest,&rdquo; he said one evening after dinner at  Glenaveril, when he and the village doctor had accepted one of Mr. Crowther&rsquo;s  pressing invitations to what he called &ldquo;pot-luck,&rdquo; the pot-luck of the man  whose spirit burns within him at the thought of his hundred-guinea cook, and  whose pride is most intolerable when it apes humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, now,&rdquo; said Mr. Crowther, &ldquo;you surprise me,  for I have always fancied there was a screw loose there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that expression imply, Mr. Crowther?&rdquo;  asked the curate, coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know! Nothing specific: only one&rsquo;s  notion of an ideal home doesn&rsquo;t generally take the shape of a beautiful girl of  twenty married to a man of forty-five. The disparity is just twice as much as  it ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul,&rdquo; cried the curate, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe  that wedded love is affected by any difference of years. Desdemona loved  Othello, who was a man of mature age &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And black,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Crowther, with a  coarse laugh. &ldquo;Well, let us be thankful that Colonel Disney is not a nigger;  and that there is so much the less danger of a burst-up at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest.  And now, Baynham, with regard to this footpath across the wood, who the deuce  will be injured if I shut it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good many people, and the people I think you  would least like to injure,&rdquo; answered the doctor, sturdily. &ldquo;Old people, and  feeble, ailing people, who find the walk to church quite far enough even with  the help of that short cut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Short cut be hanged!&rdquo; cried Mr. Crowther, helping  himself to a bumper of port, and passing on the decanter with hospitable  emphasis. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t make a difference of a hundred yards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does make a difference of over a quarter of a  mile &mdash; and the proof is that everybody uses it, and that it goes by the name of  the Church path. I wouldn&rsquo;t try to stop it, if I were you, Mr. Crowther. You  are a popular man in the parish, for you &mdash; well, you have spent a heap of money  in this place, and you subscribe liberally to all our charities and what not;  but, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, if you were to try and shut off that old  footpath across your wood, you&rsquo;d be about the most unpopular man within a  radius of ten miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about trying to shut it off, man,&rdquo; said  Mr. Crowther, arrogantly. &ldquo;If I choose to lock the gates to-morrow, I shall do  it, and ask nobody&rsquo;s leave. The wood is my wood, and there&rsquo;s no clause in my  title-deeds as to any right of way through it; and I don&rsquo;t see why I am to have  my hazel bushes pulled about, and my chestnut trees damaged by a pack of idle  boys, under the pretence of church-going. There&rsquo;s the Queen&rsquo;s highway for &rsquo;em,  d &mdash; n &rsquo;em!&rdquo; cried Mr. Crowther, growing more insolent, as he gulped his fifth glass  of Sandemann. &ldquo;If that ain&rsquo;t good enough, let &rsquo;em go to the Ranters&rsquo; Chapel at  the other end of the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were a staunch Conservative, Mr.  Crowther, and an upholder of Church and State,&rdquo; said Mr. Colfox. &ldquo;Am I to  believe my ears when I hear you advocating the Ranters&rsquo; Chapel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough for such rabble as that, sir.  What does it matter where they go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prosecute the boys for trespass, if you like,&rdquo;  said the doctor; &ldquo;though I doubt if you&rsquo;ll get a magistrate to impose more than  a nominal fine for the offence of taking a handful of nuts in a wood that has  been open ever since I began to walk, and heaven knows how many years before;  but let the old gaffers and goodies creep to church by the shortest path that  can take them there. They&rsquo;ll have to travel by the Queen&rsquo;s highway later, when  they go to the churchyard &mdash; but then they&rsquo;ll be carried. Don&rsquo;t interfere with  the privileges of the poor, Mr. Crowther. No one ever did that yet and went  scot free. There&rsquo;s always somebody to take up the cudgels for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a doit for anybody&rsquo;s cudgels,  Baynham. I shall have a look at my title-deeds to-morrow; and if there&rsquo;s no  stipulation about the right of way, you&rsquo;ll find the gates locked next Sunday  morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sunday morning came, and the gates at each end of  the old footpath were still open, and nothing had come of Mr. Crowther&rsquo;s  threat. The gates had stood open so long, and were so old and rotten, their  lower timbers so embedded in the soft, oozy soil, so entangled and overgrown with  foxglove and fern, so encrusted with moss and lichen, that it is doubtful if  anybody could have closed them. They seemed as much rooted in the ground as the  great brown fir trunks which rose in rugged majesty beside them.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  &ldquo;Where The Cold Sea Raves&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In the keen, fresh October afternoons, there was no  walk Allegra loved better than the walk to Neptune Point, and higher up by  winding footpaths to the Rashleigh Mausoleum, fitting sepulchre for a race born  and bred in the breath of the sea; a stately tomb perched on a rocky pinnacle  at the end of a promontory, like a sea-bird&rsquo;s nest overhanging the wave.</p>
<p>Allegra was in raptures with that strange  resting-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it ever so much better than your  Cockneyfied cemetery,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Think how grand it must be to lie for  ever within the sound of the sea &mdash; the terrible, inscrutable sea, whose anger  means death &mdash; the calm, summer sea, whose waves come dancing up the sands like  laughing water. I wonder whether the Rashleighs would let me have a little  grave of my own somewhere among these crags and hillocks &mdash; a modest little  grave, hidden under wild foliage, which nobody would ever notice? Only I should  hear the sea just as well as they do in their marble tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Allegra, how can you talk so lightly of  death?&rdquo; said Isola, shocked at this levity. &ldquo;To me it is always dreadful to  think of &mdash; and yet it must come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said Allegra, with infinite pity,  putting her arm round her sister-in-law&rsquo;s slighter figure, as they stood by the  railing of the Mausoleum, in the loveliness of an October sunset.</p>
<p>The sun had just gone down, veiled in autumnal  haze, and behind the long ridge of waters beyond the Dodman there glowed the  deep crimson of the western sky. Eastward above the Polruan hills the moon moved  slowly upward, amidst dark masses of cloud which melted and rolled away before  her on-coming, till all the sky became of one dark azure. The two girls went  down the hill in silence, Allegra holding Isola&rsquo;s arm, linked with her own,  steadying those weaker footsteps with the strength of her own firm movements.  The difference between the two in physical force was no less marked than the  difference in their mental characteristics, and Allegra&rsquo;s love for her  sister-in-law was tempered with a tender compassion for something so much  weaker than herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; she repeated, as they moved slowly  down the steep, narrow path, &ldquo;and do you really shudder at the thought of  death? I don&rsquo;t. I have only a vast curiosity. Do you remember that definition  of Sir Thomas Browne&rsquo;s which Martin read to us once&mdash; &lsquo;Death is the Lucina of  life.&rsquo; Death only opens the door of the hidden worlds which are waiting for all  of us to discover. It is only an appalling name for a new birth. I love to  dream about the infinite possibilities of the future &mdash; just as a boy might  dream of the time when he should become a man. Look, look, Isa, there&rsquo;s a yacht  coming in! Isn&rsquo;t it a lovely sight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a long, narrow vessel, with all her canvas  spread, gleaming with a silvery whiteness in the moonlight. Slowly and with  majestic motion she swept round towards Neptune Point and the mouth of the  harbour. There was only the lightest wind, and the waves were breaking gently  on the rocks at the base of the promontory &mdash; a night as calm and fair as June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; repeated Allegra, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t she lovely? like a  fairy boat. Whose yacht can she be, I wonder? She looks like a racer, doesn&rsquo;t  she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola did not answer. She had seen such a yacht two  years ago; had seen such a long, narrow hull lying in the harbour under  repairs; had seen the same craft sailing out to Mevagissey on a trial trip in  the wintry sunlight. Doubtless there were many yachts in this world of just the  same build and character.</p>
<p>They stood at an angle of the hill-path looking up  the river, and saw the yacht take in her canvas as she came into the haven  under the hill; that sheltered harbour, with its two rivers cleaving the hills  asunder, one winding away to the right towards Lerrin, the other to the left  towards Trelasco and Lostwithiel. It looked so perfect a place of shelter, so  utterly safe from tempest or foul weather; and yet there were seasons when a  fierce wind from the great Atlantic came sweeping up the deep valleys, and all  the angry spirits of the ocean seemed at war in that narrow gorge. To-night the  atmosphere was unusually calm, and Isola could hear the sailors singing at  their work.</p>
<p>Slowly, slowly the two young women went down the  hill, Allegra full of speculation and wonderment about the unknown vessel,  Isola curiously silent. As they neared the hotel a man landed from a dinghy,  and came briskly up the slippery causeway &mdash; a tall, slim figure in the vivid  moonlight, loose limbed, loosely clad, moving with easiest motion.</p>
<p>Isola turned sick at the sight of him. She stopped,  helplessly, hopelessly, and stood staring straight before her, watching him as  he came nearer and nearer, nearer and nearer &mdash; like some awful figure in a  nightmare dream, when the feet of the dreamer seem frozen to the ground, and  flesh and blood seem changed to ice and stone.</p>
<p>He came nearer, looked at them, and passed them by  &mdash; passed as one who knew them not, and was but faintly curious about them. He  passed and walked quickly up towards the Point, with the rapid swinging  movements of one who was glad to tread the solid earth.</p>
<p>No, it was not Lostwithiel. She had thought at  first that no one else could look so like him at so short a distance; no one  else could have that tall, slender figure, and easy, buoyant walk. But the face  she saw in the moonlight was not his. It was like, but not the same: darker,  with larger features, a face of less delicacy and distinction; but oh, God! how  like the eyes that had looked at her, with that brief glance of casual  inspection, were to those other eyes that had poured their passionate story  into her own that unforgotten night when she sat out the after-supper waltzes  in the ante-room at the Talbot. She could not have believed that any man living  could so recall the man whose name she never spoke of her own free will.</p>
<p>There were some sailors standing about at the top  of the steep little bit of road leading down to the granite causeway, and their  voices sounded fresh and clear in the still evening, mixed with the rippling  rush of the water as it came running up the stones. The moonlight shone full  upon one of the men as he stood with his face towards the sea, and Isola read  the name upon the front of his jersey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Vendetta.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Vendetta</em>,&rdquo;  cried Allegra, quick to observe the name. &ldquo;Why, is not that Lord Lostwithiel&rsquo;s  yacht?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &mdash; I think so,&rdquo; faltered Isola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that must have been Lord Lostwithiel who  passed as just now; and yet you would have known him, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was not Lord Lostwithiel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend of his, I suppose; such a nice-looking  man, too. There was something so frank and cheery in his look as he just  glanced at us both and marched briskly on. He did not pay us the compliment of  seeming curious. I wonder who he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola was wondering about something else. She was  looking with a frightened gaze across the harbour, towards that one break in  the long golden trail of the moonbeams where the <em>Vendetta</em> cast her shadow on the water. There were lamps gleaming  brightly here and there upon the vessel &mdash; a look of occupation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Lord Lostwithiel on board his yacht?&rdquo; Allegra  asked of one of the sailors, not ashamed to appear inquisitive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am; Mr. Hulbert is skipper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Mr. Hulbert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His lordship&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that he who went up towards the Point just  now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he going to stop here long, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he knows himself, ma&rsquo;am. It&rsquo;ll  depend upon the weather most likely. If we get a fair wind we may be off to the  Lizard at an hour&rsquo;s notice, and away up north to the Hebrides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that seem inconsistent?&rdquo; exclaimed  Allegra, as they walked homewards. &ldquo;What is the good of coming to Cornwall if  he wants to go to the Hebrides? It must be very much out of his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may want to see his old home, perhaps. He was  born at the Mount, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! I don&rsquo;t know anything about him, but I  want to know ever so much. I call it an interesting face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allegra was full of animation during the homeward  walk. A stranger of any kind must needs be a God-send, as affording a subject  for conversation; but such a stranger as Lostwithiel&rsquo;s brother afforded a theme  of strongest interest. She had heard so much about Lord Lostwithiel and all his  works and ways &mdash; the pity of it that he did not marry; the still greater pity  that he did not live at the Mount, and give shooting parties and spend money in  the neighbourhood. She had heard in a less exalted key of his lordship&rsquo;s  younger brother, who had fought under Beresford in Egypt, and who had only  lately left the navy. What more natural than that such a man should sail his  brother&rsquo;s yacht?</p>
<p>Captain Hulbert was still unmarried; but no one  talked about the pity of that. People took a severely sensible view of his  case, and were unanimous in the opinion that he could not afford to marry, and  that any inspiration in that line would be criminal on his part. There was an  idea at Trelasco that the younger sons of peers of moderate fortune have been  specially designed by Providence to keep up the race of confirmed bachelors.  There must be bachelors; the world cannot get on without them; society requires  them as a distinct element in social existence; and it would ill become the  offshoots of the peerage to shrink from fulfilling their destiny.</p>
<p>Allegra was not the less curious about Captain  Hulbert, although his celibate mission had been frequently expounded to her.  She was interested in him because she liked his face, because he was  Lostwithiel&rsquo;s brother, because he was sailing a very beautiful yacht, because  he had appeared in her life with a romantic suddenness, sailing out of the sea  unheralded and unexpected, like a man who had dropped from the moon.</p>
<p>She fell asleep that night wondering if she would  ever see him again &mdash; if the <em>Vendetta</em> would have vanished from the harbour to-morrow at noontide, like a boat that  had only lived in her dreams; or whether the yacht would still be anchored  there in the haven under the hill. And, if so, whether Captain Hulbert would  call at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest, and tell them about Lostwithiel&rsquo;s South American  adventures, and how he came to be skipper of his brother&rsquo;s yacht.</p>
<p>At breakfast next morning, Colonel Disney&rsquo;s talk  was chiefly about Captain Hulbert. The colonel had been for an early walk, and  had seen the <em>Vendetta</em> from the little  Quay at Fowey, by the Mechanics&rsquo; Institute, and had heard who was the skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember him when he and his brother were at  Eton together &mdash; nice boys &mdash; capital boys, both of them &mdash; but I liked Jack  Hulbert better than Lostwithiel. He was franker, more spontaneous and  impulsive. Yes, Jack was my favourite, and everybody else&rsquo;s favourite, I think,  when the two were boys. I saw very little of them after they grew up. I was  away with my regiment, and Jack was away with his ship, and Lostwithiel was  wandering up and down the earth, like Satan. I left a card for Captain Hulbert  at the club, asking him to dinner this evening. You don&rsquo;t mind, do you, Isola?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola had no objection to offer, and Allegra was  delighted at the prospect of seeing more of the man with the nice frank  countenance, and that seafaring air which most women like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a dreadful person for being influenced by  first impressions,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and that one glance at Captain Hulbert in the  moonlight assures me that I shall like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t like him too well,&rdquo; said Martin, laughingly,  &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s a detrimental, and would make even a worse match than  Colfox, who may be a bishop one day, while Hulbert has left the navy, and is  never likely to be anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Match! detrimental!&rdquo; cried Allegra, indignantly.  &ldquo;Can it be my brother who talks in such a vulgar strain? As if a woman could  not look at a man without thinking of marrying him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some women can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Martin. &ldquo;With them  every free man is a possible husband &mdash; indeed, I believe there are some who  cannot look at a married man without estimating the chances of the divorce  court &mdash; if the man is what they call a catch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is your Indian experience!&rdquo; exclaimed  Allegra, scornfully. &ldquo;I have heard that India is a sink of iniquity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went about her day&rsquo;s varied work as usual &mdash;  curious to see the new acquaintance &mdash; yet in no wise excited. Vivid and  animated, enthusiastic and energetic as she was in all her thoughts and ways,  gushing sentimentality made no part of Miss Leland&rsquo;s character. Life at  Trelasco flowed with such an even monotony, there was such a dearth of new  interests, that it was only natural that a girl of vivacious temper should be  curious about new-comers. At St. John&rsquo;s Wood every day had brought some new  element into the lives of the students, and almost every day had brought a new  pupil, drawn thither by the growing renown of the school, pupils from the  uttermost ends of the earth sometimes, pupils of swart complexion speaking  unknown tongues, pupils patrician and pupils plebeian, each and all conforming  to the same stringent rules of art, spending patient months in the shading of a  brace of plums or a bunch of grapes, from a plaster cast, and toiling slowly up  the gradual ascent which leads to the Royal Academy and the gold medal. Many  there were who sickened at the slow rate of progress and who fell away. Only  the faithful remained. And this going and coming, this strife between faith and  unfaith, patience and impatience, had made a perpetual movement in the life of  the great school &mdash; to say nothing of such bodily activities as lawn tennis, for  which the master had provided a court &mdash; a court for his girl-pupils, be it  noted, where they played among themselves, as if they had been so many  collegians in the college of Tennyson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allegra had liked her life at the great art school,  but she had never regretted its abandonment. She loved her brother, and her  brother&rsquo;s wife, better even than she loved art. It was only now and then that  she felt that existence at Trelasco was as monotonous as the flow of the river  going up and coming down day by day between Lostwithiel and the sea.</p>
<p>She spent the hours between breakfast and luncheon  hard at work in her painting-room &mdash; a little room with a large window facing  northward. She had the coachman&rsquo;s girl and boy for her models, and was engaged  upon a little water-colour picture after the school of Mrs. Allingham, a little  picture which told its story with touching simplicity.</p>
<p>It was not the first picture of the kind she had  painted. Several of her works had been exhibited at the minor galleries which  are hospitable to the new-comer in the world of art; and two small pictures had  been bought at prices which seemed to promise her an easy road to fortune.</p>
<p>The coachman&rsquo;s children profited greatly by this  new profession which had been devised for them. Allegra made their frocks in  her leisure hours, when the active fingers must have something to do, while the  active tongue ran on gaily in happy talk with Martin and Isola. Allegra made up  to her little models for their hours of enforced idleness by extra tuition  which kept them ahead of most of the other pupils in the village school; and  Allegra supplied them with pocket-money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know however the children got on before  Miss Leland came,&rdquo; said the coachman&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;They seem to look to her for  everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allegra had other models, village children, and  village girls &mdash; her beauty-girl, a baker&rsquo;s daughter with a splendid semi-Greek  face, like Mrs. Langtry&rsquo;s, whom she dressed up in certain cast-off finery of  her own, and painted in her genre pictures, now in this attitude, and now in  that, imparting an air of distinction which elevated the Cornish peasant into a  patrician. She it was, this baker&rsquo;s fair-haired daughter, who stood for  Allegra&rsquo;s successful picture&mdash; &ldquo;A daughter of the gods, divinely tall,&rdquo; a little  bit of finished painting which had brought the painter five and thirty guineas  &mdash; boundless wealth as it seemed to her &mdash; and ever so many commissions.</p>
<p>Art, even in despondency and failure, is a  consolation; art successful is an intoxicating delight. Allegra was as happy a  young woman as could be found in Cornwall that day, when she shut her  colour-box, dismissed her little maiden, and ran down to lunch, where she found  Isola more silent than usual, and made amends by her own light-hearted chatter  for the morning&rsquo;s absorption over the easel. After lunch she ran off to the  village to pay her parish visits to the sick and old, and on her way to an  outlying cottage she met Mr. Colfox, who immediately turned to accompany her, a  way he had, but a way to which she had never attached any significance. He was  a clever, well-read man, of somewhat original temper, who had to pass most of  his life among unlettered or dull people; therefore it surprised Allegra in no  wise that he should like to talk to her. A bright, attractive girl of three and  twenty is very unsuspicious about the feelings of a homely looking man at least  a dozen years her senior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother has been good enough to ask me to  dinner,&rdquo; he said, after a little talk about the Goodies and their ailments. &ldquo;I  met him at the club this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants you to meet Captain Hulbert. Perhaps you  know him already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he has not been here within my time. He only  left the navy a year ago, and he was generally stationed at the utmost ends of  the earth, keeping guard over our remote possessions. Have you seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for an instant. He passed my sister and me  yesterday evening in the moonlight. I thought he looked a nice person &mdash; but I  think women have a natural leaning towards sailors. I could never imagine a  seaman telling a falsehood or doing a mean action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a kind of open-air manner which suggests  truthfulness,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Colfox. &ldquo;Yet there have been dark deeds done by  sailors; there have been black sheep even in the Queen&rsquo;s Navee. However, I  believe Captain Hulbert is worthy of your good opinion. I have never heard  anybody speak against him, and the old people who knew him as a lad seem to  have liked him better than Lord Lostwithiel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do tell me your opinion of Lord Lostwithiel. I am  very curious about him. Mr. Crowther talked of him so much the night we were at  Glenaveril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crowther loves a lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please satisfy my curiosity. Is he really such a  fascinating personage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has very pleasant manners. I don&rsquo;t know what  constitutes fascination in a man, though I know pretty well what it means in a  woman. Lord Lostwithiel&rsquo;s manners are chiefly distinguished by repose without  languor or affectation &mdash; and by an interest in other people so cleverly  simulated that it deceives everybody. One finds him out by the way in which  people boast of his friendship. He cannot be so attached to all the world. He  has a manner which is generally described as sympathetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crowther enlarged a good deal upon his  lordship&rsquo;s admiration for my sister at the Hunt Ball. Was that so very marked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Colfox coloured violently at this direct  question &mdash; assuredly not easy to answer truthfully without hazard of offence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not at the ball &mdash; I &mdash; I heard people talk a  little &mdash; in the way people talk of everything &mdash; about Lostwithiel&rsquo;s attention  to Mrs. Disney, and about her prettiness &mdash; they all agreed that if not the  loveliest woman in the room, she was at least the most interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very natural that he should admire her; but  I don&rsquo;t think Martin liked Mr. Crowther&rsquo;s talking about it in that way, at the  dinner-table. The man is horridly underbred. Has Lord Lostwithiel what you  call&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated a little&mdash; &ldquo;a good character?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the present. I have heard that  in the past his reputation was not altogether good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Allegra, quickly. &ldquo;The  admiration of such a man is an insult; and that is why Mr. Crowther harped upon  the fact. I am sure he is a malevolent man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be hard upon him, Miss Leland. I believe he  has only the misfortune to be a cad &mdash; a cad by birth, education, and  associations. Don&rsquo;t fling your stone at such a man &mdash; consider what an unhappy  fate it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but he does not think himself unhappy. He is  bursting with self-importance and the pride of riches. He is the typical rich  man of the Psalmist. He must be the happiest man in Trelasco, a thick-skinned  man whom nothing can hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry you think so badly of poor Mr.  Crowther, because I am really attached to his wife. She is one of the best  women I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So my sister tells me, and I was very much taken  with her myself, but one cannot afford to be friendly with Mrs. Crowther at the  cost of knowing her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with some touch of the insolence of  youth, which sets so high a value upon its own opinions and its own  independence, and looks upon all the rest of humanity as upon a lower plane.  And this arrogant youth, which thinks so meanly of the multitude, will make its  own exceptions, and reverence its chosen ideals with a blind hero-worship &mdash; for  its love is always an upward-looking love, &ldquo;the desire of the moth for the  star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Colfox sighed, and smiled at the same moment, a  sad little half-cynical smile. He was thinking how impossible it was to refrain  from admiring this bright out-spoken girl, with her quick intellect, and her artistic  instincts, so spiritual, so unworldly, and fresh as an April morning &mdash; how  impossible not to admire, how difficult not to love her, and how hopeless to  love.</p>
<p>He thought of himself with scathing self-contempt &mdash;  middle-aged, homely of feature and of figure, with nothing to recommend him  except good birth, a small independence &mdash; just so much as enabled him to live  where he pleased and serve whom he would, without reference to the stipend  attached to the cure; and a little rusty, dry-as-dust learning. Nothing more  than this; and he wanted to win and wed a girl whose image never recurred to  his mind without the suggestion of a rose garden, or a summer morning. Yes, she  reminded him of morning and dewy red roses, those old-fashioned heavy red  roses, round as a cup, and breathing sweetest, purest perfume.</p>
<p>He jogged on by her side in silence, and only awoke  from his reverie to bid her good-bye at the gate of a cottage garden, in the  lane that led up the hill to Tywardreath.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  &ldquo;Far, Too Far Off For Thought Or Any Prayer&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Mr. Colfox and Allegra met again in the  drawing-room of the Angler&rsquo;s Nest at a quarter to eight. He was the first to  arrive, and Isola had not yet appeared. Martin Disney was at his post in front  of the library fireplace, library and drawing-room making one spacious room,  lighted with candles here and there, and with one large shaded lamp on a table  near the piano. Isola had been suffering from headache, and had been late in  dressing. Captain Hulbert had been in the room nearly ten minutes before his  hostess appeared, looking pale and ill in her black lace gown, and with an  anxious expression in her eyes. He had been introduced to Allegra, and was  talking to her as if he had known her for years, when his attention was called  off by Isola&rsquo;s appearance, and his introduction to her.</p>
<p>Was this Martin Disney&rsquo;s wife, he thought  wonderingly &mdash; such a girlish fragile creature &mdash; so unlike the woman he had  pictured to himself? Strange that Lostwithiel should not have told him of her  delicate prettiness, seeing that he was a connoisseur in beauty, and  hypercritical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is just the kind of beauty he would admire,&rdquo;  thought Hulbert, &ldquo;something out of the common &mdash; a pale, spiritual beauty &mdash; not  dependent upon colouring, or even upon regularity of feature &mdash; the kind of  thing one calls soul, not having found a better name for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went in to dinner presently, Captain Hulbert  and Isola, Mr. Colfox and Allegra. The table was a small oval, at which five  people made a snug little party. There was a central mass of white  chrysanthemums, a cheerful glow of coloured Venetian glass, delicatest pink and  jade-green, under the light of a hanging lamp. John Hulbert looked round him  with a pleased expression, taking in the flowers, the glass, the cream-white  china, the lamplight, everything; and then the two fair young faces, one pale  and pensive, the other aglow with the delight of life, eagerly expectant of new  ideas.</p>
<p>They talked of the <em>Vendetta</em> and the places at which she had touched lately. Captain  Hulbert had spent his summer on the Eastern Liguria, between Genoa and Civita  Vecchia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it the wrong time of year for Italy?&rdquo; asked  Mr. Colfox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is the season of seasons in the land of the  sun. If you want to enjoy a southern country, go there in the summer. The south  is made for summer, her houses are built for hot weather, her streets are  planned for shade; her wines, her food, her manners and customs have all been  made for summer-time &mdash; not for winter. If you want to know Italy at her worst  go there in cold weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you leave Lord Lostwithiel?&rdquo; Disney  asked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left him nowhere. He left me to rove about  Southern Europe &mdash; left me on his way to Carinthia. He is like the wandering  Jew. He used to be mad about yachting; but he got sick of the <em>Vendetta</em> all of a sudden, and handed her  over to me. Very generous on his part; but the boat is something of a white  elephant for a man of my small means. I wanted him to sell her. Wouldn&rsquo;t hear  of it. To let her. Not to be thought of. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lend her to you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and  you shall keep her as long as you like &mdash; sink her, if you like &mdash; provided you  don&rsquo;t go down in her. She is not a lucky boat.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you sailed her long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly a year, and I love her as if she were bone  of my bone, and flesh of my flesh. Let us all go for a sail to-morrow, Mrs.  Disney &mdash; to Mevagissey or thereabouts. We could do a little fishing. It will be  capital fun. What do you say, Miss Leland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should adore it,&rdquo; said Allegra, beaming at him.  &ldquo;The sea is my passion &mdash; and I think it is my sister&rsquo;s passion too. We are a  kind of amphibious creatures, living more on water than on land. We venture as  far as we dare in a row-boat &mdash; but oh, that is such a little way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that some day you will venture so far  that you won&rsquo;t be able to get back again, and will find yourselves drifting  away to America,&rdquo; said her brother.</p>
<p>Isola answered never a word, until Captain Hulbert  addressed her pointedly for the second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go, Mrs. Disney &mdash; may we make up the  party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather not,&rdquo; she answered, without looking  at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not? Are you such a bad sailor &mdash; in spite  of all Miss Leland says of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a pretty good sailor in a row-boat &mdash; but not  in a yacht. And I hate fishing &mdash; such a slow weary business. I would rather not  go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry; but you must not be worried about  it,&rdquo; said Hulbert, kindly, seeing the growing distress in her countenance. &ldquo;We  will not go in for fishing &mdash; or excursions &mdash; but you and Miss Leland will at  least come to afternoon tea on the <em>Vendetta</em> &mdash; to afternoon tea in the harbour. There used to be a comic song when I was a  boy&mdash; &lsquo;Come and drink tea in the arbour.&rsquo; You must come to the arbour with an  aspirate. It is not so rustic or sentimental &mdash; but there will be no earwigs or  creeping things to drop into your tea-cup. Mr. Colfox, you will come, won&rsquo;t  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; answered the curate. &ldquo;I  have a sneaking kindness for all yachts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation drifted back to Lostwithiel and  his works and ways, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he went home two years ago he gave me to  understand he was going to settle down at the Mount, and spend the rest of his  days in peace and respectability,&rdquo; said Captain Hulbert. &ldquo;Yet, very soon  afterwards, he and his yacht were off again like the <em>Flying Dutchman</em>, and the next I heard of him was at Leghorn, and  six months later he was coasting off Algiers; and the following spring he was  in South America; and the <em>Vendetta</em> was laid up at Marseilles, where he begged me to go and look after her, and  take her to myself until such time as he should want her again. I was with him  for a few days at Leghorn, where he seemed ill and out of spirits. I don&rsquo;t  think you can have used him over well in this part of the world, Mrs. Disney,&rdquo;  he added, half in jest. &ldquo;I fancy some of you must have snubbed him severely, or  his tenants must have worried him by their complaints and exactions. I could  not get him to talk about his life at the Mount. He seemed to have taken a  disgust for the old home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must put that down to his roving temper,&rdquo; said  Disney, &ldquo;for although I was away at the time, I can answer for it there was no  such thing as snubbing in the case. Your brother is the only peer in these  parts, and from the way people talk about him he might be the only peer in  Great Britain &mdash; the Alpha and Omega of Debrett. Our parvenu neighbour, Mr.  Crowther, talked of him one night with a slavish rapture which made me sick. I  am a Tory by association and instinct, but I can&rsquo;t stand the vulgarian&rsquo;s  worship of a lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola looked at her sister-in-law, and they both  rose at this moment, the Church almost tumbling over the Navy in eagerness to  open the door; Navy winning by a neck.</p>
<p>They were not long alone in the drawing-room, not  more than the space of a single cigarette, before the men followed. Then came  music, and a good deal of talk, in the long, low, spacious room, which looked  so bright and homely by candlelight, with all its tokens of domestic and  intellectual life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a capital quarter-deck this is,&rdquo; cried John  Hulbert, after pacing up and down while he listened, and talked, and laughed at  Allegra&rsquo;s little jokes about the narrowness of village life. &ldquo;It is delightful  to stretch one&rsquo;s legs in such a room as this, after six months upon a yacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have room enough to stretch your legs at  the Mount,&rdquo; said Disney.</p>
<p>Captain Hulbert had announced his intention of  spending a week or two under the family roof-tree while the <em>Vendetta</em> underwent some slight repairs  and renovations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Room enough and to spare,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t feel  half so jovial walking up and down those grim old rooms as I feel here. I shall  fancy a ghost pacing behind me, clump, clump, clump &mdash; a slow, solemn footstep &mdash;  only the echo of my own tread perhaps; but I shall never know, for I shall be  afraid to look round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought not to make sport of weak people&rsquo;s  fancies, for I am sure you don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts,&rdquo; said Allegra, leaning with  one elbow on the piano, turning over pieces of music absently, a graceful  figure in a dark green velvet gown, cut just low enough to show the fine curves  of a full, round throat, white and smooth as ivory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not believe in ghosts? Did you ever know a sailor  who wasn&rsquo;t superstitious? We are too often alone with the sea and the stars to  be quite free from spectral fancies, Miss Leland. I can see in your eyes as you  look at me this moment that you believe in ghosts &mdash; believe and tremble. Tell  me now, candidly &mdash; When do you most fear them? At what hour of the day or night  does the unreal seem nearest to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she faltered, turning over the  loose music with a faintly tremulous gesture, while Isola sat by the piano,  touching the notes dumbly now and then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it at midnight &mdash; in the gloaming &mdash; in the  chill, mysterious dawn? You won&rsquo;t answer! Shall I guess? If you are like me, it  is in broad daylight &mdash; between two and three in the afternoon &mdash; when the  servants are all idling after their dinner, and the house is silent. You are  alone in a big, bright room, perhaps, with another room opening out of it, and  a door a long way off. You sit writing at your table, and you feel all at once  that the room is haunted &mdash; there must be something or some one stealing in at  that remotest door. You daren&rsquo;t look round. You go to the window and look out  into garden or street &mdash; for a town house may be just as ghastly as a country  one &mdash; and then with a great effort you turn slowly round and face your terror,  in the broad, garish sunlight, in the business hours of the day. There is  nothing there, of course; but the feeling has not been the less vivid. I know I  shall be spectre-haunted at the Mount. You must all come and scare away the  shadows. Mr. Colfox, are you fond of billiards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I own to a liking for the game. I play with Mr.  Crowther and his youngest daughter whenever I dine at Glenaveril. Alicia is a  very fine player, for a girl, and her father plays a good game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will come up to the Mount two or three  times a week and play with me, I hope. There&rsquo;s a decent table &mdash; cushions as  hard as bricks, I dare say, but we must make the best of it &mdash; and there&rsquo;s  plenty of sound claret in the cellars to say nothing of a keg or two of  Schiedam that I sent home from the Hague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Colfox will not make much impression either on  your claret or your schnapps,&rdquo; said Disney, laughing. &ldquo;He is almost as temperate  as one of those terrible anchorites in the novel we were reading the other day&mdash;  &lsquo;Homo Sum.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you put in the qualifying &lsquo;almost,&rsquo;&rdquo;  said the curate, &ldquo;for I hope to taste Captain Hulbert&rsquo;s Schiedam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain expatiated upon what his three new  friends &mdash; and his one old friend, Martin Disney &mdash; were to do to cheer him in  his solitude at the Mount.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing of the anchorite about me,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;I love society, I love life and movement, I love bright faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would not leave until they had all promised to  take tea on board the yacht on the following afternoon, an engagement which was  kept by Allegra and the colonel; but not by Isola, whose headache was worse  after the little dinner-party; nor by the curate, who had parish business to detain  him on shore.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  &ldquo;Under The Pine-Wood, Blind With Boughs&rdquo;</h2>
<p>If Isola had any disinclination to visit Captain  Hulbert&rsquo;s yacht, her headache only served to defer the evil day, for after that  first tea-drinking came other invitations and other arrangements,  fishing-parties, luncheons off Mevagissey, entertainments in which Isola must  needs share when she saw her husband and his sister bent upon the enjoyment of  the hour, delighted with the <em>Vendetta</em> and her warm-hearted skipper.</p>
<p>They were not John Hulbert&rsquo;s only friends in the  neighbourhood. Everybody seemed glad to welcome the rover to his native  village. Almost everybody had known him in his boyhood; and there was a general  consensus of opinion that he was a much better fellow than his brother. He was  less courted; but he was better liked. There had been a touch of cynicism about  Lostwithiel which frightened matter-of-fact country people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One could never feel sure he wasn&rsquo;t laughing in  his sleeve at our rustic ignorance,&rdquo; said Mrs. Baynham. &ldquo;I am more at my ease  with Captain Hulbert, and my husband and he were great friends when he was a  boy. They used to go fishing together, when Baynham&rsquo;s practice wasn&rsquo;t as good  as it is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the brief Indian summer passed in pleasant  idlesse on a tranquil sea. The equinoctial gales had not begun to rage yet.  There was a lull before the coming of the great winds which were to blow good  ships on shore, and startle sleepers in the dead of night. All now was fair and  placid &mdash; sunlit waters, golden evenings. They spent one bright, balmy day off  Mevagissey, a day which was like a long dream to Isola, as she sat on deck in a  low folding-chair, wrapped in a great feathery rug from the South Sea Islands,  with her languid head reclining against a plush-covered cushion, one of the  many effeminate luxuries which abounded in the cabins below. Everybody else was  intent upon the nets. Everybody else was full of interest and movement and  expectation; but she sat apart from all, with her ivory knitting-needles lying  idle in her lap, amidst a soft mass of white wool, which her industry was to  convert into a garment for the baby.</p>
<p>Allegra was enraptured with the yacht. She would  fain have taken Isola down to the cabins, to explore their wonders of luxury  and contrivance, so much comfort and elegance in so restricted an area; but  Isola refused to leave the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate all cabins,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They are always  suffocatingly hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Mrs. Baynham went below with Allegra, and they  two explored the two principal cabins with wondering admiration, and even  peeped into the cook&rsquo;s galley, and the odd little places where steward and  sailors contrived to bestow themselves.</p>
<p>The chief cabin, saloon, or whatever one liked to  call it, was as daintily decorated as a lady&rsquo;s boudoir. There were nests of  richly bound books, Oriental bronzes, and all kinds of continental pottery,  Japanese and Indian embroideries, Venetian mirrors, quaint little carved  cupboards for wine or cigars. Every corner and cranny was utilized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a delicious drawing-room!&rdquo; cried Allegra. &ldquo;I  could live here all my life. Fancy, how delightful! A floating life. No such  thing as satiety. One might open one&rsquo;s eyes every morning on a fresh coast,  glorified, as one sees it across the bright, blue water. To explore the  Mediterranean, for instance, floating from city to city &mdash; the cities of the  past, the cities of the Gospel, the shores that were trodden by the feet of St.  Paul and his companions &mdash; the cities of the Christian saints and martyrs, the  island birthplaces of Greek gods and heroes. Think, Mrs. Baynham! A yacht like  this is a master-key to open all the gateways of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather have my own cosy little cottage on  terra firma,&rdquo; answered the doctor&rsquo;s wife in a matter-of-fact mood; but this  speech of Allegra&rsquo;s set the good lady pondering upon the possibility of John  Hulbert falling in love with this nice, clever girl, and making her mistress of  his brother&rsquo;s yacht.</p>
<p>Her friendly fancy depicted the village wedding,  and those two going forth over the great waters to spend their honeymoon amidst  the wonder-world of the Mediterranean, which the banker&rsquo;s daughter knew only in  her Atlas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be rich,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;but he must have  a comfortable income. I know his mother had money. And Allegra can earn a good  deal by her painting. She wouldn&rsquo;t be an expensive wife. We ought all to do our  best to bring it about. A girl has so few chances in such a place as Trelasco.  She might almost as well be in a convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Baynham was at heart a matchmaker, like most  motherly women whom fate has left childless. She was very fond of Allegra, who  was so much more companionable than Isola, so much more responsive to kindness  and affection. As she sat on deck in the westering sunlight, somewhat comatose  after a copious luncheon, Mrs. Baynham&rsquo;s idea of helping Allegra took the form  of a dinner-party which she had long been meditating, her modest return for  numerous dinners which she had eaten at Glenaveril and at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest.  She considered that three or four times a year it behoved her to make a serious  effort in the way of hospitality &mdash; a substantial and elaborate dinner, in which  no good things in season should be spared, and which should be served with all  due ceremony. The time was at hand when such a dinner would in a manner fall due;  and she determined to hasten the date with a view to Allegra&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Hulbert is sure to be off again before  long,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;so every evening they can spend together is of  importance. I&rsquo;m sure he is inclined to fall in love with her already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not much doubt about his feelings as he  stood by Allegra in the stern, directing the movements of her bare active hands  while she hauled in the net; not much doubt that he was as deep in love as a  man well can be after a fortnight&rsquo;s acquaintance. He did not make any secret of  his bondage, but let his eyes tell all the world that this girl was for him  &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s one woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The invitation from Mrs. Baynham was delivered by  post next morning, as ceremonious a card as if the place were Mayfair, and the  inviter and invitees had not met since last season. A copper-plate card, with  name and address filled in by the lady&rsquo;s pen, a detail which distinguished her  modest invitation from the Glenaveril cards, of which there were a variety, for  at homes, tennis, dinner, luncheon, to accept, and to decline. A fortnight&rsquo;s  notice marked the dignity of the occasion &mdash; the hour the orthodox quarter to  eight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t refuse, Isola,&rdquo; said Disney, when his  wife handed him the card, &ldquo;although my past experience assures me that the  evening will be a trifle heavy. Why will people in small houses insist upon  giving dinner-parties, instead of having their friends in instalments? When we  go to dine with the Baynhams we go for love of them, not the people they bring  together; and yet they insist upon seating twelve in a room that will just  comfortably hold eight. It is all vanity and vexation of spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Baynham is so happy when she is giving a  real dinner-party. I don&rsquo;t think we can refuse, can we, Allegra?&rdquo; asked Isola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Baynham is a darling, and I wouldn&rsquo;t vex her  for worlds,&rdquo; replied her sister-in law. &ldquo;And in a place like this one can&rsquo;t  pretend a prior engagement, unless it were in the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The invitation was accepted forthwith, and when Captain  Hulbert dropped in at teatime it was discovered that he, too, had been asked,  and that he meant to accept, if his friends at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest were to be  there.</p>
<p>A thunderbolt fell upon the little village on the  following Sunday. When the old men and women, creeping to church a little in  advance of younger legs, came to the church-path, they found the gate locked  against them, locked and barricaded with bars which looked as if they were  meant to last till the final cataclysm. The poor old creatures looked up  wonderingly at a newly-painted board, on which the more intelligent among them  spelt out the following legend &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;This wood is the private property of J. Vansittart  Crowther, Esq. Trespassers will be prosecuted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin Disney and his wife and sister came up when  a little crowd of men, women, and children, numbering about thirty, had  assembled round the gate, all in their Sunday best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rdquo; asked Disney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, colonel, that&rsquo;s what we all want to know,&rdquo;  replied old Manley, the village carpenter, a bent and venerable figure, long  past work. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m over eighty, but I never remember that gate being locked as  long as I have lived at Trelasco, and that&rsquo;s all my life, colonel. There&rsquo;s  always been a right of way through that wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there always shall be,&rdquo; answered Martin  Disney. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t take any violent measures to-day, my friends &mdash; first because  it is Sunday, and next because one should always try fair means before one  tries foul. I shall write to Mr. Crowther to-morrow, asking him civilly to open  that gate. If he refuses, I&rsquo;ll have it opened for him, and I&rsquo;ll take the  consequences of the act. Now, my good friends, you&rsquo;d better go to church by the  road. You&rsquo;ll get there after the service has begun. Wait till the congregation  are standing up, and then go into church all together, so that everybody may  understand why and by whose fault it is that you are late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The appearance of this large contingent after the  first lesson created considerable surprise, and much turning of heads and rustling  of bonnet-strings in the echoing old stone church. Mr. Crowther stood in his  pew of state on one side of the chancel, and felt that the war had begun.  Everybody was against him in the matter, he knew; but he wanted to demonstrate  the rich man&rsquo;s right to do what he liked with the things which he had bought.  The wood was his, and he did not mean to let the whole parish tramp across it.</p>
<p>He received a stiffly polite letter from Colonel  Disney, requesting him to re-open the church-path without loss of time, and  informing him of the great inconvenience caused to the older and weaker members  of the congregation by the illegal closing of the path during church hours.</p>
<p>Mr. Crowther sent his reply by the colonel&rsquo;s  messenger. He asserted his right to shut up the wood which formed a part of his  estate, and positively refused to re-open the gate at either end of the  footpath in question.</p>
<p>Captain Hulbert dropped in at his usual hour, eager  to know the progress of the fight. Fight there must be, he was assured, having  seen something of Mr. Crowther&rsquo;s bulldog temper. Then, in the drawing-room of  the Angler&rsquo;s Nest, there was hatched a terrible plot &mdash; a Catiline conspiracy in  a tea-cup &mdash; Allegra listening and applauding while the two men plotted.</p>
<p>That night, when the village was hushed in sleep, a  boatful of sailors landed at the little hard near the railway station at Fowey,  and half a dozen stalwart blue-jackets might have been seen tramping along the  old railway track to Trelasco, one carrying a crowbar, another a carpenter&rsquo;s  basket. And under the autumn stars that night in the woods of Glenaveril, while  Vansittart Crowther slept the sleep of the just man who payeth his twenty  shillings in the pound, there rose the sound of a sea-song and the cheery  chorus of the sailors, with a rhythmic accompaniment of hammering; and lo, when  the October morning visited those yellowing woods, and when Mr. Crowther&rsquo;s  gamekeeper went on his morning round, the gate at either end of the church path  was wrenched off its hinges, and was lying on the ground. Staple and bolt,  padlock and iron hinges, were lying among the dewy dock-leaves and the  yellowing fern; and there was free passage between the village of Trelasco and  the House of God.</p>
<p>Vansittart Crowther went to Plymouth by the first  train that could convey him, and there consulted the lawyer most in renown  among the citizens; and that gentleman, after due thought and consideration,  informed him that the closing of such an old-established right of way as that  of the church-path was more than any landowner durst attempt. Whatever omission  there might be in the title-deeds, he had bought the estate subject to that old  right of way, which had been enjoyed by the parish from time immemorial. He  could no more shut it off than he could wall out the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can punish the person who pulled the locks  off my gates, I conclude?&rdquo; said Mr. Crowther, swelling with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, of course, is a distinct outrage, for which  you may obtain redress, if you can find out who did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no difficulty about that. The act  must have been instigated by the writer of that impertinent letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to Martin Disney&rsquo;s letter, lying open on  the solicitor&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very probably. But you will have to be sure of  proving his share in the act if you mean to take proceedings against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vansittart Crowther was furious. How was he to  bring the responsibility of this outrage home to anybody, when the deed had  been done in the dead of night, and no mortal eye had seen the depredators at  their felonious work? His locks and bolts and hinges, the best of their kind  that Sheffield could supply, had been mocked at and made as naught; and all his  dumb dogs of serving men and women had been lying in their too comfortable  beds, and had heard never a sound of hammer clinking or crowbar striking on  iron. There had not been so much as a kitchen-maid afflicted with the  tooth-ache, and lying wakeful, to hear the far-off noise of that villainous  deed.</p>
<p>Mr. Crowther sent for the police authorities of  Fowey, and set his wrongs before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give fifty pounds reward to the man who  will get me credible evidence as to the person who planned that outrage,&rdquo; he  said. And next day there were bills pasted against divers doors at Fowey and  Trelasco, against the Mechanics&rsquo; Institute, and against that curious old oaken  door of a medi&aelig;val building opposite the club, which may once have been a  donjon, and in sundry other conspicuous places, beginning with &ldquo;Whereas,&rdquo; and  ending with Vansittart Crowther&rsquo;s signature.</p>
<p>Nothing came of this splendid offer, though there  were plenty of people in the district to whom fifty pounds would have seemed a  fortune. Whether no one had seen the crew of the <em>Vendetta</em> landing or re-embarking in the night-time, or whether some  wakeful eyes had seen, whose owners would not betray the doers of a deed done  in a good cause, still remains unknown. Captain Hulbert was enchanted at the  success of the conspiracy, and went to church next Sunday by the now notorious  footpath, along which an unusual procession of villagers came streaming in the  crisp, clear air, proud to assert a right that had been so boldly maintained by  their unnamed but not unknown champion. Every one felt very sure that the  flinging open of the gates had been somehow brought about by Martin Disney &mdash;  Martin, whose grandfather they could some of them remember, when he came home  after the long war with the French, and took up his abode in an old house among  the hills, and married a fair young wife. That had happened sixty-five years  ago; but there were those in the village who could remember handsome Major  Disney, with only one arm, and a face bronzed by the sun that shines on the  banks of the Douro.</p>
<p>Captain Hulbert went by the church-path that  morning, although it took him ever so far out of his way. He wanted to walk to  church with the Disney family, in order to talk over their victory; and the  Disneys seemed to-day to resolve themselves into one; and that one was Allegra  Leland; for she and the captain walked ahead and discoursed gaily, perhaps in  too exultant and worldly a vein for pious church people; but at worst their  exultation was in a good cause; for the horn of the lowly was exalted, and the  pride of the rich man was brought low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he will be at church?&rdquo; asked Allegra,  the pronoun standing for Mr. Crowther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he will. He must brazen out the  position. He will be there, no doubt, gnashing his teeth behind his  prayer-book. If angry looks could kill, you and I would be as dead as Ananias  and Sapphira before the end of the service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor, silly man, why did he want to shut up the  footpath?&rdquo; speculated Allegra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to show his importance &mdash; to make himself felt  in the neighbourhood. They wouldn&rsquo;t have him for their representative, in spite  of his money, and his grand Church and State principles, and all the Primrose  Leaguing of his womankind; and so he turns savage and wants to make himself  disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, it was true that Mr. Crowther had stood for  Lostwithiel on three separate occasions, and with equal unsuccess on each. This  may have embittered him. If the anger of slighted beauty is a furious thing, no  less bitter is the sting of wounded vanity in the rejected candidate.</p>
<p>And then the parson and the doctor had told Mr.  Crowther that he could not close his wood against the public; an all-sufficient  reason why he should make the attempt.</p>
<p>The Crowther family were in the chancel pew in full  force. Allegra thought she detected signs of distress in Mrs. Crowther&rsquo;s  countenance; but the daughters went through the service with their noses in the  air, and were more than usually vivacious and conversational among their  friends between the church-porch and the landau which bore them away to  Glenaveril, and the sumptuous boredom of Sunday luncheon.</p>
<p>Merrily went the short autumn days on board the <em>Vendetta</em>, and merrily went the  tea-drinkings and talk in the drawing-room at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest. Mrs. Disney  did not often join the yachting expeditions east or west. The sea made her head  ache, she told them; but Mrs. Baynham, who loved pleasure of any kind, was  always ready to chaperon Allegra, and Isola welcomed the wanderers to the  cheery fireside and the friendly five-o&rsquo;clock tea. She spent her own days  mostly in the society of her baby, with whom she seemed to hold a kind of  mysterious commune. She had no idea of amusing him as the nurse had, none of  those conventional tricks and movements which are offered to generation after  generation of infants; but the child would lie in her lap for hours while she  sang to him in her low sweet voice the songs she had learnt in her early  girlhood &mdash; songs that the peasants of Brittany sing, some of them &mdash; and others  of a somewhat loftier strain. She would sing him little bits of Mozart, those  immortal melodies, of inexhaustible sweetness and ineffable pathos, music mixed  with smiles and tears, melody interwoven with such melting tenderness as  thrills the coldest heart. There was a gentle happiness in these solitary hours  which the young mother spent with her child; and Martin Disney, coming into the  room unawares, sometimes stood for a minute or so in loving contemplation of  that domestic picture &mdash; the young fair face with its long oval form and  delicate features; the pensive gravity of the large violet eyes, and mournful  droop of the thin, flower-like lips. He had seen such a face on canvas, the  ideal Madonna of Raffaelle, with just that subdued blonde colouring and pale  auburn hair, and just that thoughtful expression.</p>
<p>His heart swelled with gladness and gratitude as he  contemplated mother and son. Yes, the child had made all things well in his  home.</p>
<p>Those aching doubts which he felt as he watched  beside his wife&rsquo;s sick-bed had vanished like clouds before the sun. Who could  doubt the happiness of the mother, absorbed in her firstborn? Who could doubt  the love of the wife, looking up at her husband with such tender welcome as he  bent over her shoulder to take the little curled-up fist in his, unfold the  crumpled fingers, and press them to his lips?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very fond of him, Martin?&rdquo; she asked, with  an often repeated inquiry, knowing what the answer would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fond of him! After you he is all that I have in  this world &mdash; except Allegra, who will float away into a world of her own  by-and-by, and belong to us no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After me! He ought to be first, Martin &mdash; your son,  your heir, your second self in the days to come. He ought to have the first  place in your heart, Martin, for he is your future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is first but you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dropped the baby hand, and took his wife&rsquo;s head  between his hands, and lifted the fair young forehead, looking down at it  fondly before he stooped to kiss the soft clustering hair and pencilled brows  and ivory temples, with more than a lover&rsquo;s passion.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  &ldquo;Say The False Charge Was True&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Baynhams&rsquo; dinner-party was a function to be anticipated  with horror, and undergone with resignation. For the first week after the  acceptance of the invitation the ceremony had seemed so far off that it could  be talked about lightly, and even made an occasion for mirth &mdash; Allegra giving  her own little sketch of what a dinner at Myrtle Lodge would be like &mdash; the  drawing-room with its wealth of chair-backs and photograph albums, and the  water-colour landscapes which Mrs. Baynham had painted while she was at a  finishing school at Plymouth, never having touched brush or pencil since &mdash; and  Mrs. Baynham&rsquo;s rosy-cheeked nieces from Truro, who always appeared on the scene  of any festivity. Yes, one could tell beforehand what the entertainment would  be like.</p>
<p>One thing they did not know, however, Mrs. Baynham  having been discreetly silent on the subject. They did not know that they were  to meet the Glenaveril family in full force, the doctor&rsquo;s wife being of opinion  that a friendly dinner-party was the panacea for all parish quarrels and small  antagonisms, and that by judiciously bringing the Crowthers and the Disneys  together at a well-spread board, and in the genial atmosphere of her unspacious  drawing-room, she could bring about an end of the feud, or tacit coldness,  which had divided the Angler&rsquo;s Nest and Glenaveril since Colonel Disney&rsquo;s  home-coming. It was a disappointment to this worthy woman to see Vansittart  Crowther, when Colonel and Mrs. Disney were announced, start and glare as if a  mad dog had been brought into the room; but she was relieved at seeing the easy  nod which the colonel bestowed upon his vanquished foe, and the friendly hand  which good Mrs. Crowther held out to Isola, who paled and blushed, and all but  wept at meeting with that cordial matron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you never come to see me,&rdquo; said  Mrs. Crowther, confidentially, having made room for Isola upon a very  pretentious and uncomfortable sofa of the cabriole period, a sofa with a  sloping seat and a stately back in three oval divisions, heavily framed in  carved walnut, a back against which it was agony to lean, a seat upon which it  was martyrdom to sit. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see why we shouldn&rsquo;t be friends when we do  happen to meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Crowther, we are always friends. I shall  never forget your kindness to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there; you&rsquo;re a tender-hearted soul, I  know. It grieved me so not to go and see you when you were ill; and not to pay  attention to your baby. Such a sweet little fellow, too. I&rsquo;ve given him many a  kiss on the sly when I&rsquo;ve met him and his nurse in the lanes. I suppose Mr.  Crowther and the colonel don&rsquo;t hitch their horses very well together. That&rsquo;s at  the bottom of it all, no doubt. But as for you and me, Isola, I hope we shall  always be good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This confidential talk between the two women,  observed by Mrs. Baynham out of the corner of her eye, augured well; but Mr.  Crowther had not left off glaring, and a glare in those protruding eyeballs was  awful. He usurped the hearthrug, as he laid down the law about the political  situation and the impending ruin of the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A feeble policy never maintained the prestige of  any country, sir,&rdquo; he told Captain Pentreath, the half-pay bachelor, who was  devoted to fishing, and cared very little whether his country had prestige or  shuffled on without it &mdash; so long as fish would bite. &ldquo;We lost our prestige when  we lost Beaconsfield, and with our prestige we are losing our influence. The  Continental powers leave us out of their calculations. The neutral policy of  the last ten years has stultified the triumph of British arms from Marlborough  to Wellington. The day will come, sir, when the world will cease to believe in  the history of those magnificent campaigns. People will say, &lsquo;These are idle  traditions. England could never have been a warlike nation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pentreath tried to look interested, but was  obviously indifferent to the opinion of future ages, and intent upon watching  Allegra, looking her handsomest in a yellow silk gown, and deep in talk with  Captain Hulbert, who leant his tall form against Mrs. Baynham&rsquo;s cottage piano,  which, with a view to artistic effect, had been disguised in Algerian drapery,  and wheeled into a position that made the room more difficult of navigation.</p>
<p>One only of the rosy-cheeked nieces was allowed to  appear at the dinner-table; firstly because the table was a tight fit for  twelve, and secondly because a thirteenth would have excited superstitious  fears. The younger sister, whom people asked about with tender solicitude, was  to be on view afterwards, when she would perform the bass to her sister&rsquo;s  treble in the famous overture to Zampa, which, although not exactly a novelty,  may be relied upon to open a musical evening with <em>&eacute;clat</em>.</p>
<p>Every one had arrived, and after a chilling delay,  Potts, the local fishmonger, who had been a butler, and who went out to wait at  dinner-parties, and was as familiar a figure as a saddle of mutton or a cod&rsquo;s  head and shoulders, made his solemn announcement, and with an anxious mind,  Mrs. Baynham saw her guests parade across the narrow hall somewhat  overfurnished with stags&rsquo; heads, barometers, gig-whips and umbrella-stands, to  the dining-room, while a hot blast of roast meat burst fiercely from the  adjacent kitchen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Baynham had allotted Isola to Mr. Crowther,  determined to carry out her idea of bringing about a friendly feeling. Mr. Baynham  took Mrs. Crowther, and Captain Pentreath had the privilege of escorting  Belinda, whose sentiments and airs and graces of every kind he knew by heart.  There was no more excitement in such companionship than in going in to dinner  with his grandmother. What is the use of being brought in continual association  with a handsome heiress if you know yourself a detrimental?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would no more look at me as a lover than she  would at a Pariah dog,&rdquo; said the captain, when some officious boon companion at  the club suggested that he should enter himself for the Crowther Stakes.</p>
<p>Captain Hulbert was made happy with Allegra, and  Colonel Disney was honoured by his hostess, to whom strict etiquette would have  prescribed the peer&rsquo;s son. There was surplus female population in the persons  of Alicia Crowther and Mary Baynham, who agreeably adorned each side of the  table with a little extra sweetness and light; Miss Baynham, buxom and rosy in  a white cashmere frock which she had grown out of since her last dinner-party;  Miss Crowther, square shouldered and bony, in a black confection by Worth, with  a bloated diamond heart making a mirage upon a desert waste of chest, it being  a point of honour with thin girls to be more <em>d&eacute;colet&eacute;es</em> than their plumper sisters.</p>
<p>Mrs. Baynham&rsquo;s conversation at one of her own  dinners was apt to be somewhat distracted and inconsecutive in substance,  although she maintained a smiling and delighted air all the time, whatever  anxieties might be wearing her spirit &mdash; anxieties about the cooking and the attendance  &mdash; angry wonder at the prolonged absence of the parlour-maid &mdash; distress at  seeing the lobster sauce dragging its slow length along when people had nearly  finished the turbot &mdash; agonizing fears lest the <em>vol au vent</em> should not last out after that enormous help taken by  Captain Pentreath, in sheer absence of mind, perhaps, since he only messed it  about on his plate, while he bored Miss Crowther with a prosy account of his  latest victory over an obstinate demon of the Jack family&mdash; &ldquo;such a devil of a  fellow, three feet long, and with jaws like a crocodile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Disney was almost as inconsecutive and  fragmentary in his conversation as his hostess, and did not imitate her smiling  aspect. He was silent and moody, as he had been at the Glenaveril dinner, more  than a year ago. That Silenus face bending towards his wife&rsquo;s ear &mdash; that  confidential air assumed in every look and tone &mdash; made him furious. He could  scarcely sit through the dinner. He wounded Mrs. Baynham in her pride of heart  as a housekeeper by hardly touching her choicest dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Colonel Disney,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;you  must take one of my lobster cromskys. I don&rsquo;t mind owning that I made them  myself. It is an <em>entr&eacute;e</em> I learnt from  the cook at my own home. My father was always particular about his table, and  we had a professed cook. Please don&rsquo;t refuse a cromsky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Disney took the thing on his plate, and sat  frowning at it, while a bustle at the door and a marked rise in the temperature  indicated the entrance of the <em>pi&egrave;ce de  resistance</em>, in the shape of a well-kept saddle of mutton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you had seen the <em>Vendetta</em> before, hadn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked the oily voice on the other  side of the table. &ldquo;You knew all about her. Really, now, Mrs. Disney, was that  your first visit to Lostwithiel&rsquo;s yacht?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola looked at the speaker as if he had struck  her. Great God, how pale she was! Or was it the reflection of the apple-green  shade upon the candle in front of her which gave her that ghastly look?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I saw the yacht from the harbour  years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were never on board her? How odd, now. I  had a notion that you must have seen that pretty cabin, and all Lostwithiel&rsquo;s  finical arrangements. He was so proud of the <em>Vendetta</em> when he was here. He was always asking my girls on board.  You remember, Alicia, how Lord Lostwithiel used to ask you two girls to tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered his daughter, in her hard voice.  &ldquo;He asked us often enough, but mother would not let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very severe!&rdquo; said Captain Hulbert, attracted  by the sound of his brother&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;Why do you object to a tea-party on the <em>Vendetta</em>, Mrs. Crowther? Have you a  prejudice against yachts? Do you think they are likely to go down in harbour,  like the poor old <em>Royal George</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I am not afraid of that. Only I liked Lord  Lostwithiel to come to tea with us at Glenaveril; and I did not think it would  be quite the thing for my girls to visit a bachelor&rsquo;s yacht, even if I went  with them. People at Trelasco are only too ready to make unpleasant remarks.  They would have said we were running after Lord Lostwithiel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it isn&rsquo;t the single girls who run after  the men nowadays,&rdquo; said Mr. Crowther, with his Silenus grin; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the young  married women. They are the sirens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody took any notice of this remark; and the  conversation which had become general for a minute or two resumed its duologue  form.</p>
<p>Captain Hulbert and Allegra went on with their  animated discussion as to the author of &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hamlet;&rdquo; and Captain  Pentreath took up the thread of his story about the obstinate pike; Alicia  talked to the doctor about her last day with the hounds; and Mary Baynham told  Mrs. Crowther about a church bazaar, which had electrified Truro, and at which  she had &ldquo;helped&rdquo; at somebody else&rsquo;s stall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was hard work standing about and trying to sell  things all day, and persuading stingy old gentlemen to put into raffles for  talking dolls,&rdquo; said Miss Baynham. &ldquo;I have pitied shop-girls ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Baynham gave the signal for departure, feeling  that her dinner, from a material point of view, had been a success. The lobster  sauce had been backward, and the three last people to whom the <em>vol au vent</em> was offered had got very  little except pie-crust and white sauce, but those were small blemishes. The  mutton and the pheasants had been unimpeachable; and on those substantial  elements Mrs. Baynham took her stand. She had spared neither pains nor money.  Her Italian cream was cream, and not cornflour. Her cabinet-pudding was a work  of art. She felt satisfied with herself, and knew that the doctor would  approve; and yet she felt somehow that the moral atmosphere had not been  altogether free from storm-cloud. Colonel Disney had looked on at the feast  with a gloomy countenance; Mr. Crowther had talked in an unpleasant tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid those two will never forget the church  path,&rdquo; she thought, as she set her nieces down to Zampa, and then went to  inspect the card-table in a snug corner near the fire, with its freshly lighted  wax candles, and new cards placed ready for the good old English game which our  ancestors called whist.</p>
<p>Zampa once started meant a noisy evening. Captain  Pentreath would sing &ldquo;The Maid of Llangollen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Drink, puppy, drink.&rdquo; Mary  Baynham would murder &ldquo;It was a dream,&rdquo; and scream the higher notes in &ldquo;Ruby.&rdquo;  Duet would follow solo, and fantasia succeed ballad, Mrs. Baynham&rsquo;s idea of a  social gathering being the nearest attainable approach to a penny reading. She  would have had recitations, and imitations of popular actors, had there been  any one capable of providing that form of amusement.</p>
<p>This evening, however, she failed in getting a  quartette for whist. Neither Mr. Crowther nor his wife was disposed for cards;  Colonel Disney coldly declined; and it was useless to ask the young people to  leave the attractions of that woody piano. While she was lamenting this state  of things, the whist-table being usually a feature in her drawing-room, the  Disneys and Allegra bade her good night, and were gone before she had time to  remonstrate with them for so early a departure.</p>
<p>It seemed earlier than it really was, for the  dinner had been late. Disney&rsquo;s quick ear had heard the step of his favourite  horse, punctual as the church clock. He had ordered his carriage at half-past  ten, and at half-past ten he and his party left the drawing-room, the doctor  following to hand the ladies to their carriage, while the colonel lighted a  cigar on the door-step, preparatory to walking home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine night; I&rsquo;d rather walk,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He walked further than the Angler&rsquo;s Nest. He walked  up to the hill where he and Isola had sat in the summer sunshine on the day  after his home-coming. He roamed about that wild height for two hours, and the  church clock struck one while he was in the lane leading down to Trelasco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that man has any motive for his insolence &mdash; if  there is any secret between him and my wife, I&rsquo;ll wring the truth out of him  before he is a day older,&rdquo; the colonel said to himself, as he tramped  homewards.</p>
<p>He wrote to Mr. Crowther next morning, requesting  the favour of half an hour&rsquo;s private conversation upon a very serious matter.  He proposed to call upon Mr. Crowther at twelve o&rsquo;clock, if that hour would be  convenient. The bearer of the note would wait for an answer.</p>
<p>Mr. Crowther replied that he would be happy to see  Colonel Disney at the hour named.</p>
<p>The colonel arrived at Glenaveril with military  punctuality, and was forthwith shown into that grandiose apartment, where all  those time-honoured works which the respectable family bookseller considers  needful to the culture of the country gentleman were arranged in old oak  bookcases, newly carved out of soft chestnut wood in the workshops of Venice.  It was an imposing apartment, with panelled dado, gilded Japanese paper, heavy  cornice and ceiling, in <em>carton pierre</em> &mdash; such a room as makes the joy of architect, builder, and furniture-maker. So  far as dignity and social position can be bought for money, those attributes  had been bought by Vansittart Crowther; and yet this morning, standing before  his medi&aelig;val fireplace, with his hands in the pockets of his velvet lounge  coat, he looked a craven. He advanced a step or two to meet his visitor, and  offered his hand, which the colonel overlooked, fixing him at once with a gaze  that went straight to the heart of his mystery. He felt that an accuser was  before him &mdash; that he, Vansittart Crowther, was called to account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crowther, I have come to ask what you mean by  your insolent manner to my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insolent! My dear Colonel Disney, I admire the  lady in question more than any other woman within twenty miles. Surely it is  not insolent to admire a pretty woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is insolent to adopt the tone you have adopted  to Mrs. Disney &mdash; first in your own house &mdash; on the solitary occasion when my  wife and I were your guests &mdash; and next at the dinner-table last night. I took  no notice of your manner on the first occasion &mdash; for though I considered your  conduct offensive, I thought it might be your ordinary manner to a pretty  woman, and I considered I did enough in forbidding my wife ever to re-enter  your house. But last night the offence was repeated &mdash; was grosser &mdash; and more  distinctly marked. What do you mean by talking to my wife of Lord Lostwithiel  with a peculiar emphasis? What do you mean by your affectation of a secret  understanding with my wife whenever you pronounce Lord Lostwithiel&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not aware that there has been anything  peculiar in my pronunciation of that name &mdash; or in my manner to Mrs. Disney,&rdquo;  said Mr. Crowther, looking at his boots, but with a malignant smile lurking at  the corners of his heavy lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you are aware of both facts. You meant to  be insolent, and meant other people to notice your insolence. It was your way  of being even with me for defying you to shut up the wood yonder, and cut off  the people&rsquo;s favourite walk to church. You dared not attack me; but you thought  you could wreak your petty spite upon my wife &mdash; and you thought I should be too  dull to observe, or too much of a poltroon to resent your impertinence. That&rsquo;s  what you thought, Mr. Crowther: and I am here to undeceive you, and to tell you  that you are a coward and a liar, and that if you don&rsquo;t like those words you  may send any friend you please to my friend, Captain Hulbert, to arrange a  meeting in the nearest and most convenient place on the other side of the  channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Crowther turned very red, and then very pale.  It was the first time he had been invited to venture his life in defence of his  honour; and for the moment it seemed to him that honour was a small thing, a  shadowy possession exaggerated into importance by the out-at-elbows and  penniless among mankind, who had nothing else to boast of. As if a man who  always kept fifty thousand pounds at his bankers, and who had money invested  all over the world, would go and risk his life upon the sands of Blankenburgh  against a soldier whose retiring allowance was something less than three  hundred a year, and who was perhaps a dead shot. The idea was preposterous!</p>
<p>No, Mr. Crowther was not going to fight; and though  he quailed before those steady eyes of Martin Disney&rsquo;s, calm in their deep  indignation, this explanation was not unwelcome to him. He had a dagger ready  to plunge into his enemy&rsquo;s heart, and he did not mean to hold his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fighting man, Colonel Disney,&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;and if I were I should hardly care to fight for a grass widow who made herself  common talk by her flirtation with a man of most notorious antecedents. We will  say that it never was any more than a flirtation &mdash; in spite of Mrs. Disney&rsquo;s  mysterious disappearance after the Hunt Ball, which happened to correspond with  Lord Lostwithiel&rsquo;s sudden departure. The two events might have no connection &mdash;  more especially as Mrs. Disney came back ten days after, and Lord Lostwithiel  hasn&rsquo;t come back yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can answer for my wife&rsquo;s conduct, sir, under all  circumstances, and amidst all surroundings. You are the first person who has  ever dared to cast a slur upon her, and it shall not be my fault if you are not  the last. I tell you again, to your face, that you are a coward and a liar &mdash; a  coward because you are insolent to a young and lovely woman, and a liar because  you insinuate evil against her which you are not able to substantiate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask your wife where she was at the end of  December, the year before last &mdash; the year you were in India. Ask her what she  had been doing in London when she came back to Fowey on the last day of the  year, and travelled in the same train with my lawyer, Mr. MacAllister, who was  struck by her appearance, first because she was so pretty, and next because she  looked the picture of misery &mdash; got into conversation with her, and found out  who she was. If you think that is a lie you can go to MacAllister, in the Old  Jewry, and ask him to convince you that it is a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no occasion. My wife has no secrets from  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it. Then there is really nothing  to fight about except a good deal of vulgar abuse on your part, which I am  willing to overlook. A man of your mature age, married to a beautiful girl, has  some excuse for being jealous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More excuse, perhaps, than a man of your age has  for acting like a cad,&rdquo; said the colonel, turning upon his heel, and leaving  Mr. Crowther to his reflections.</p>
<p>Those reflections were not altogether bitter. Mr.  Crowther felt assured that he had sown the seeds of future misery. He did not  believe in the colonel&rsquo;s assertion that there were no secrets between him and  his wife. He had cherished the knowledge of that mysterious journey from London  on the last day of the year. He had warned his confidential friend and  solicitor to mention the fact to no one else. He had pried and questioned, and  by various crooked ways had found out that Isola had been absent from the  Angler&rsquo;s Nest for some days after the Hunt Ball, and he had told himself that  she was a false wife, and that Martin Disney was a fool to trust her.</p>
<p>As for being called by harsh names, he was too much  a man of the world to attach any importance to an angry husband&rsquo;s abuse. It  made him not a sixpence the poorer; and as there had been no witness to the  interview it scarcely diminished his dignity. The thing rested between him and  his enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took down my gates, but I think I have given  him something to think about that will spoil his rest for many a night, before  he has thought it out,&rdquo; mused Mr. Crowther.</p>
<p>It was after the usual luncheon hour before Martin  Disney went back to the Angler&rsquo;s Nest. He had been for a long walk by the  river, trying to walk down the devil that raged within him, before he could  trust himself to go home. His wife was alone in the drawing-room, sitting by  the fire with her baby in her lap; but this time he did not pause on the  threshold to contemplate that domestic picture. There was no tenderness in the  eyes which looked at his wife &mdash; only a stern determination. Every feature in  the familiar face looked strange and rigid, as in the face of an accuser and  judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send the child away, Isola. I want some serious  talk with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stretched out a faltering hand to the bell,  looking at him, pale and scared, but saying no word. She gave the baby to his  nurse presently in the same pallid dumbness, never taking her eyes from her  husband&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin,&rdquo; she gasped at last, frozen by his angry  gaze, &ldquo;is there anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is something horribly wrong &mdash; something  that means destruction. What were you doing in London the winter before last,  while I was away? What was the motive of your secret departure &mdash; your stealthy  return? What were you doing on the last day of the year? Where had you been?  With whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him breathless with horror; whether  at the accusation implied in his words, or at his withering manner, it would  have been difficult for the looker-on to decide. His manner was terrible enough  to have scared any woman, as he stood before her, waiting for her answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where had you been &mdash; with whom?&rdquo; he repeated,  while her lips moved mutely, quivering as in abject fear. &ldquo;Great God! why can&rsquo;t  you answer? Why do you look such a miserable, degraded creature &mdash;  self-convicted &mdash; not able to speak one word in your own defence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the last day of the year?&rdquo; she faltered, with  those tremulous lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the last day of the year before last &mdash; the  winter I spent in Burmah. What were you doing &mdash; where were you &mdash; where had you  been? Is it so difficult to remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; of course not,&rdquo; she cried, with a  half-hysterical laugh. &ldquo;You frighten me out of my senses, Martin. I don&rsquo;t know  what you are aiming at. I was coming home from London on that day &mdash; of course &mdash;  the 31st of Jan &mdash; no, December. Coming home from Hans Place, where I had been  spending a few days with Gwendolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never told me of that visit to Gwendolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; I&rsquo;m sure I told you all about it in one of  my letters. Perhaps you did not get that letter &mdash; I remember you never noticed  it in yours. Martin, for God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t look at me like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking at you to see if you are the woman I  have loved and believed in, or if you are as false as hell,&rdquo; he said, with his  strong hand grasping her shoulder, her face turned to his, so that those  frightened eyes of hers could not escape his scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has put this nonsense in your head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your neighbour &mdash; your good Mrs. Crowther&rsquo;s husband  &mdash; told me that his lawyer travelled with you from Paddington &mdash; on the 31st of  December &mdash; the year before last. He got into conversation with you &mdash; you  remember, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she cried, with a sudden piteous change in  her face, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you came from London on that day. You remember  that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. I came from Gwendolen&rsquo;s house on that  day. I told you so in my letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That letter which I never received &mdash; telling me of  that visit to which you made no allusion in any of your later letters. It was  about that time, I think, that you fell off as a correspondent &mdash; left off  telling me all the little details of your life &mdash; which in your earlier letters  seemed to shorten the distance between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent, listening to his reproaches with a  sullen dumbness, as it seemed to him, while he stood there in his agony of  doubt &mdash; in his despairing love. He turned from her with a heart-broken sigh,  and slowly left the room, going away he scarce knew whither, only to put  himself beyond the possibility of saying hard things to her, of letting  burning, branding words flash out of the devouring fire in his heart.</p>
<p>She stood for a few moments after he had gone,  hesitating, breathless, and frightened, like a hunted animal at bay &mdash; then ran  to the door, opened it softly, and listened. She could hear him pacing the room  above. Again she stood still and hesitated, her lips tightly set, her hands  clenched, her brow bent in painful thought. Then she snatched hat and jacket  from a corner of the hall where such things were kept, and put them on  hurriedly, with trembling hands, as if her fate depended upon the speed with  which she got herself ready to go out, looking up at the great, dim, brazen  face of the eight-day clock all the while. And then she let herself out at a  half-glass door into the garden, and walked quickly to a side gate that opened  in to the lane &mdash; the gate at which the baker and the butcher stopped to gossip  with the maids on fine mornings.</p>
<p>There was a cold bracing wind, and the sun was  declining in a sky barred with dense black clouds &mdash; an ominous sky, prophetic  of storm or rain. Isola walked up the hill towards Tywardreath as if she were  going on an errand of deadliest moment, skirted and passed the village, with no  slackening of her pace, and so by hill and valley to Par, a long and weary walk  under ordinary circumstances for a delicate young woman, although accustomed to  long country walks. But Isola went upon her lonely journey with a feverish  determination which seemed to make her unconscious of distance. Her steps never  faltered upon the hard, dusty road. The autumn wind that swept the dead leaves  round her feet seemed to hold her up and carry her along without effort upon  her part. Past copse and meadow, common land and stubble, she walked steadily  onward, looking neither to right nor left of her path, only straight forward to  the signal lights that showed fiery red in the grey dusk at Par Junction. She  watched the lights growing larger and more distinct as she neared the end of  her journey. She saw the fainter lights of the village scattered thinly beyond  the station lamps, low down towards the sandy shore. She heard the distant rush  of a train, and the dull sob of the sea creeping up along the level shore,  between the great cliffs that screened the bay. A clock struck six as she  waited at the level crossing, in an agony of impatience, while truck after  truck of china clay crept slowly by, in a procession that seemed endless; and  then for the first time she felt that the wind was cold, and that her thin  serge jacket did not protect her from that biting blast. Finally the line was  clear, and she was able to cross and make her way to the village post-office.</p>
<p>Her business at the post-office occupied about a  quarter of an hour, and when she came out into the village street the sky had  darkened, and there were heavy rain-drops making black spots upon the grey dust  of the road; but she hurried back by the way she had come, recrossed the line,  and set out on the long journey home. The shower did not last long, but it was  not the only one she encountered on her way back, and the poor little jacket  was wet through when she re-entered by the servant&rsquo;s gate, and by the half-glass  door, creeping stealthily into her own house and running upstairs to her own  room to get rid of her wet garments before any one could surprise her with  questions and sympathy. It was past eight o&rsquo;clock, though she had walked so  fast all the way as to feel neither cold nor damp. She took off her wet clothes  and dressed herself for dinner in fear and trembling, imagining that her  absence would have been wondered at, and her errand would be questioned. It was  an infinite relief when she went down to the drawing-room to find only Allegra  sitting at her easel, working at a sepia sketch by lamplight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin is very late,&rdquo; she said, looking up as  Isola entered, &ldquo;and he is generally a model of punctuality. I hope there is  nothing wrong. Where have you been hiding yourself since lunch, Isa? Have you  been lying down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, part of the time&rdquo; &mdash; hesitatingly. &ldquo;It is very  late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty minutes to nine. Dale has been in twice in  the last quarter of an hour to say that the dinner is being spoilt. Hark!  There&rsquo;s the door, and Martin&rsquo;s step. Thank God, there is nothing wrong!&rdquo; cried  Allegra, getting up and going out to meet her brother.</p>
<p>Colonel Disney&rsquo;s countenance as he stood in the  lamplight was not so reassuring as the substantial fact of his return. It was  something to know that he was not dead, or hurt in any desperate way &mdash; victim  of any of those various accidents which the morbid mind of woman can imagine if  husband or kinsman be unusually late for dinner; but that things were all right  with him was open to question. He was ghastly pale, and had a troubled,  half-distracted expression which seared Allegra almost as much as his prolonged  absence had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure there is something wrong!&rdquo; she said,  when they were seated at dinner, and the parlour-maid had withdrawn for a  minute or two in pursuance of her duties, having started them fairly with the  fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, there is nothing particularly amiss; I have  been worried a little, that&rsquo;s all. I am very sorry to be so unconscionably late  for dinner, and to sit down in this unkempt condition. But I loitered at the  club looking at the London papers. I shall have to go to London to-morrow,  Isola &mdash; on business &mdash; and I want you to go with me. Have you any objection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started at the word London, and looked at him  curiously &mdash; surprised, yet resolute &mdash; as if she were not altogether unprepared  for some startling proposition on his part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. I would rather go with you if you  really have occasion to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really have. It is very important. You won&rsquo;t  mind our deserting you for two or three days, will you, Allegra?&rdquo; asked Disney,  turning to his sister. &ldquo;Mrs. Baynham will be at your service as chaperon if you  want to go out anywhere while we are away. It is an office in which she  delights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t trouble her. I shall stay at home, and  paint all the time. I have a good deal of work to do to my pictures before they  will be ready for the winter exhibition, and the time for sending in is drawing  dreadfully near. You need have no anxiety as to my gadding about, Martin. You  will find me shut up in my painting-room, come home when you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, when she and her brother were alone in the  drawing-room, she went up to him softly and put her arms around his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin, dearest, I know you have some great  trouble. Why don&rsquo;t you tell me? Is it anything very bad? Does it mean loss of  fortune; poverty to be faced; this pretty home to be given up, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, my dear. The home is safe enough; the  house will stand firm as long as you and I live. I am not a shilling poorer  than I was yesterday. There is nothing the matter &mdash; nothing worth speaking  about; blue devils, vapours if you like. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are ill, Martin. You have found out that there  is something wrong with you &mdash; heart, lungs, something &mdash; and you are going to  London to consult a physician. Oh, my dear, dear brother,&rdquo; she cried, with a  look of agony, her arms still clasped about his neck, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t keep me in the  dark; let me know the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no worst, Allegra. I am out of sorts,  that&rsquo;s all. I am going to town to see my lawyer.&rdquo;</p>

  &ldquo;My Life Continues Yours, And Your Life Mine&rdquo;</h2>
<p>They started by the eleven-o&rsquo;clock train from Fowey  next morning, husband and wife, in a strangely silent companionship &mdash; Isola  very pale and still as she sat in a corner of the railway carriage, with her  back to the rivers and the sea. Naturally, in a place of that kind, they could  not get away without being seen by some of their neighbours. Captain Pentreath  was going to Bodmin, and insisted upon throwing away a half-finished cigar in  order to enjoy the privilege of Colonel and Mrs. Disney&rsquo;s society, being one of  those unmeditative animals who hate solitude. He talked all the way to Par, lit  a fresh cigar during the wait at the junction, and reappeared just as the colonel  and his wife were taking their seats in the up-train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you room for me in there?&rdquo; he asked,  sacrificing more than half of his second cigar. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the <em>Mercury</em> &mdash; Jepps is in for Stokumpton &mdash; a  great triumph for our side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spread out the paper, and made believe to begin  to read with a great show of application, as if he meant to devour every  syllable of Jepps&rsquo;s long exposition of the political situation; but after two  minutes he dropped the <em>Mercury</em> on his  knees and began to talk. There were people in Fowey who doubted whether Captain  Pentreath could read. He had been able once, of course, or he could hardly have  squeezed himself into the Army; but there was an idea that he had forgotten the  accomplishment, except in its most elementary form upon sign-boards, and in the  headings of newspaper articles, printed large. It was supposed that the  intensity of effort by which he had taken in the cramming that enabled him to  pass the ordeal of the Examiners had left his brain a blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going further than Plymouth, I  suppose?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really, now? A bad time of year for London  &mdash; fogs and thaws, and all kinds of beastly weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he asked a string of questions &mdash; futile,  trivial, vexing as summer flies buzzing round the head of an afternoon sleeper;  and then came the welcome cry of Bodmin Road, and he reluctantly left them.</p>
<p>The rest of the journey was passed almost in  silence. They had the compartment to themselves for the greater part of the  time, and they sat in opposite corners, pretending to read &mdash; Isola apparently  absorbed in a book that she had taken up at random just before she started,  when the carriage was at the door, and while Allegra was calling to her to make  haste.</p>
<p>It was Carlyle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hero Worship.&rdquo; The big words, the  magnificent sentences, passed before her eyes like lines in an unknown  language. She had not the faintest idea what she was reading; but she followed  the lines and turned the leaf at the bottom of a page mechanically.</p>
<p>Martin Disney applied himself to the newspapers  which he had accumulated on the way &mdash; some at Par, some at Plymouth, some at  Exeter, till the compartment was littered all over with them. He turned and  tossed them about one after the other. Never had they seemed so empty &mdash; the  leaders such mere beating the air; the hard facts so few and insignificant. He  glanced at Isola as she sat in her corner, motionless and composed. He watched  the slender, white hands turning the leaves of her book at regular intervals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your book very interesting?&rdquo; he asked, at last,  exasperated by her calmness.</p>
<p>He had been attentive and polite to her, offering  her the papers, ordering tea for her at Exeter, doing all that a courteous  husband ought to do; but he had made no attempt at conversation &mdash; nor had she.  This question about the book was wrung from him by the intensity of his  irritation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a book you gave me years ago at Dinan,&rdquo; she  answered, looking at him piteously. &ldquo;&lsquo;Hero Worship.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t you remember? I had  never read anything of Carlyle&rsquo;s before then. You taught me to like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I? Yes, I remember &mdash; a little Tauchnitz volume  bound in morocco &mdash; contraband in England. A cheat &mdash; like many things in this  life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his face resolutely to the window, as if  to end the conversation, and he did not speak again till they were moving  slowly into the great station, in the azure brightness of the electric light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have telegraphed for rooms at Whitley&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he  said, naming a small private hotel near Cavendish Square, where they had stayed  for a few days before he started for the East.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it would be too late for us to call  at Hans Place before we go to our hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started at the question. He saw her cheeks  crimson in the lamplight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the lateness of hour will matter,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;unless Gwendolen is dining out. She dines out very often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to-night may be an exception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want very much to see her?&rdquo; asked Isola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to question her about me, I  suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Isola, that is what I am going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is treating me rather like a criminal; or, at  any rate, like a person whose word cannot be believed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help myself, Isola. The agony of doubt  that I have gone through can only be set at rest in one way. It is so strange a  thing, so impossible as it seems to me, that you should have visited your  sister while I was away, although no letter I received from you contained the  slightest allusion to that visit &mdash; an important event in such a monotonous life  as yours &mdash; and although no word you have ever spoken since my return has  touched upon it; till all at once, at a moment&rsquo;s notice, when I tell you of  your journey from London and the slander to which it gave occasion &mdash; all at  once you spring this visit upon me, as if I ought to have known all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can ask Gwendolen as many questions as you  like,&rdquo; answered Isola, with an offended air, &ldquo;and you will see if she denies  that I was with her in the December you were away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Disney handed his wife into a station  brougham. The two portmanteaux were put upon the roof, and the order was given  &mdash; 99, Hans Place &mdash; for albeit Mr. Hazelrigg&rsquo;s splendid mansion was described on  his cards and his writing-paper as The Towers, it is always as well to have a  number for common people to know us by.</p>
<p>No word was spoken during the long drive from  Paddington; no word when the neat little brougham drew up in front of a lofty  flight of steps leading up to a Heidelberg doorway, set in the midst of a  florid red-brick house, somewhat narrow in proportion to its height, and with  over much ornament in the way of terra cotta panelling, bay and oriel, balcony  and pediment.</p>
<p>A footman in dark green livery and rice powder  opened the door. Mrs. Hazelrigg was at home. He led the way to one of those  dismal rooms which are to be found in most fine houses &mdash; a room rarely used by  the family &mdash; a kind of pound for casual visitors. Sometimes the pound is as  cold and cheerless as a vestry in a new Anglican church; sometimes it affects a  learned air, lines its walls with books that no one ever reads, and calls  itself a library. Whatever form or phase it may take, it never fails to chill  the visitor.</p>
<p>There was naturally no fire in this apartment.  Isola sank shivering into a slippery leather chair, near the Early English  fender; her husband walked up and down the narrow floor space. This lasted for  nearly ten minutes, when Gwendolen came bursting in, a vision of splendour, in  a grey satin tea-gown, frothed with much foam of creamy lace and pale pink  ribbon, making a cascade of fluffiness from chin to slippered toes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a most astonishing thing!&rdquo; she cried, after  kissing Isola, and holding out both her plump, white hands to the colonel.  &ldquo;Have you dear, good people dropped from the clouds? I thought you were nearly  three hundred miles away when the man came to say you were waiting to see me.  It is a miracle we are dining at home to-night. We are so seldom at home. Of  course you will stay and dine with us. Come up to my room and take off your  hat, Isa. No, you needn&rsquo;t worry about dress,&rdquo; anticipating Disney&rsquo;s refusal;  &ldquo;we are quite alone. I am going to dine in my tea-gown, and Daniel is only just  home from the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind; no, my dear Mrs. Hazelrigg, we  won&rsquo;t dine with you to-night,&rdquo; answered Disney. &ldquo;We have only just come up to  town. We drove across the park to see you before going to our hotel. Our  portmanteaux are waiting at the door. We are in town for so short a time that I  wanted to see you at once &mdash; particularly as I have &mdash; a rather foolish question to  ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice grew husky, though he tried his uttermost  to maintain a lightness of tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask away,&rdquo; said Gwendolen, straightening herself  in her glistening grey gown, a splendid example of modern elegance in dress and  demeanour, and altogether a more brilliant and imposing beauty than the pale,  fragile figure sitting in a drooping attitude beside the fireless hearth. &ldquo;Ask  away,&rdquo; repeated Gwendolen, gaily, glancing at her sister&rsquo;s mournful face as she  spoke. &ldquo;If I can answer you I will &mdash; but please to consider that I have a  wretched memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not likely to forget the fact I want to  ascertain. My wife and I have had an argument about dates &mdash; we are at variance  about the date of her last visit to you &mdash; while I was away &mdash; and I should like  to settle our little dispute, though it did not go so far as a wager. When was  she with you? On what date did she leave you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All hesitation and huskiness were gone from manner  and voice. He stood like a pillar, with his face turned towards his  sister-in-law, his eyes resolute and inquiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t ask me about dates,&rdquo; cried Gwendolen, &ldquo;I  never know dates. I buy Letts in every form, year after year &mdash; but I never can  keep up my diary. Nothing but a self-acting diary would be of any use to me. It  was in December she came to me &mdash; and in December she left &mdash; after a short  visit. Come, Isa. You must remember the dates of your arrival and departure,  better than I. You don&rsquo;t live in the London whirl. You don&rsquo;t have your brains  addled by hearing about Buenos Ayres, Reading and Philadelphias, Berthas,  Brighton A&rsquo;s, and things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin Disney looked at her searchingly. Her manner  was perfectly easy and natural, of a childlike transparency. Her large, bright,  blue eyes looked at him &mdash; fearless and candid as the eyes of a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to remember that it was on the last day  of the year I left this house,&rdquo; said Isola, in her low, depressed voice, as of  one weary unto death. &ldquo;You said enough about it at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I? Oh, I am such a feather-head, <em>t&ecirc;te de linotte</em>, as they used to call me  at Dinan. So it was &mdash; New Year&rsquo;s Eve &mdash; and I was vexed with you for not staying  to see the New Year in. That was it. I remember everything about it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Hazelrigg,&rdquo; said Martin Disney,  and then going over to his wife, he said gravely, &ldquo;Forgive me, Isola, I was  wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out his hands to her with a pleading look,  and she rose slowly from her chair, and let her head fall upon his breast as he  put his arms round her, soothing and caressing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor girl, I was wrong &mdash; wrong &mdash; wrong &mdash; a  sinner against your truth and purity,&rdquo; he murmured low in her ear; and then he  added laughingly, to Gwendolen, &ldquo;Were we not fools to dispute about such a  trifle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All married people are fools on occasion,&rdquo;  answered Mrs. Hazelrigg. &ldquo;I have often quarrelled desperately with Daniel about  a mere nothing &mdash; not because he was wrong, but because I wanted to quarrel.  That kind of thing clears the air &mdash; like a thunderstorm. One feels so dutiful  and affectionate afterwards. Dan gave me this sapphire ring after one of our  biggest rows,&rdquo; she added, holding up a sparkling finger.</p>
<p>Daniel Hazelrigg came into the room while she was  talking of him, a large man, with a bald head and sandy beard, a genial-looking  man, pleased with a world in which he had been permitted always to foresee the  rise and fall of stocks. The Hazelriggs were the very type of a comfortable  couple, so steeped in prosperity and the good things of this world as to be  hardly aware of any keener air outside the gardenia-scented atmosphere of their  own house; hardly aware of men who dined badly or women who made their own  gowns; much less of men who never dined at all, or women who flung themselves  despairing from the parapets of the London bridges.</p>
<p>Mr. Hazelrigg came into the room beaming, looked at  his wife and smiled, as he held out his hand to Colonel Disney, looked at his  sister-in-law and smiled again, and held out his hand to her, the smile  broadening a little, as if with really affectionate interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad to see you, my dear Mrs. Disney; but  I can&rsquo;t compliment you upon looking as well as you did when we last met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is tired after her long journey,&rdquo; said  Gwendolen, quickly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all there is amiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner we get to our hotel the better for both  of us,&rdquo; said Disney. &ldquo;We are dusty and weather-beaten, and altogether bad  company. Good night, Mrs. Hazelrigg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely you&rsquo;ll stop and dine; it&rsquo;s close upon  eight,&rdquo; remonstrated Hazelrigg, who was the essence of hospitality. &ldquo;You can  send on your luggage, and go to your hotel later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good, but we are not fit for dining  out. Isola looks half dead with fatigue,&rdquo; answered Disney. &ldquo;Once more, good  night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook hands with husband and wife and hurried  Isola to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure you come to me the first thing to-morrow,&rdquo;  said Gwendolen to her sister. &ldquo;I shall stay in till you come, and I can drive  you anywhere you want to go for your shopping &mdash; Stores, Lewis and Allanby&rsquo;s &mdash;  anywhere. I want to show you my drawing-room. I have changed everything in it.  You&rsquo;ll hardly know it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She and her husband followed the departing guests  to the hall, saw them get into the little brougham and drive off into the  night; and then Gwendolen put her arm through her husband&rsquo;s with a soft  clinging affectionateness, as of a Persian cat, that knew when it was well  housed and taken good care of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Isa! how awfully ill she looks,&rdquo; sighed  Gwendolen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghastly. Are all women alike, I wonder, Gwen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you ought to know what kind of woman I am  by this time,&rdquo; retorted his wife, tossing up her head.</p>
<p>Martin Disney and his wife were alone in their  sitting-room at the hotel, somewhat bare and unhomelike, as hotel rooms must  always be, despite the march of civilization which has introduced certain  improvements. He had made a pretence of dining in the coffee-room below, and  she had taken some tea and toast beside the fire; and now at ten o&rsquo;clock they  were sitting on each side of the hearth, face to face, pale and thoughtful, and  strangely silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isola, have you forgiven me?&rdquo; he asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart. Oh, Martin, I could never be  angry with you &mdash; never. You have been so good to me. How could I be angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have the right to be angry. I ought not to  have doubted. I ought to have believed your word against all the world; but  that man raised a doubting devil in me. I was mad with fears and suspicions,  wild and unreasonable &mdash; as I suppose jealousy generally is. I had never been  jealous before. Great God! what a fearful passion it is when a man gives  himself up to it. I frightened you by my vehemence, and then your scared looks  frightened me. I mistook fear for guilt. Isola, my beloved, let me hear the  truth from your own lips &mdash; the assurance &mdash; the certainty,&rdquo; he cried with  impassioned fervour, getting up and going over to her, looking down into the  pale, upturned face with those dark, earnest eyes which always seemed to search  the mysteries of her heart. &ldquo;Let there be no shadow of uncertainty or distrust  between us. I have heard from your sister that you were with her when you said  you were. That is much. It settles for that vile cad&rsquo;s insinuated slander; but  it is not enough. Let the assurance come to me from your lips &mdash; from yours  alone. Tell me &mdash; by the God who will judge us both some day &mdash; Are you my own  true wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, Martin &mdash; I am your own true wife,&rdquo; she  answered, with an earnestness that thrilled him. &ldquo;I have not a thought that is  not of you. I love you with all my heart and mind. Is not that enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have never wronged me? You have been true  and pure always? I call upon God to hear your words, Isola. Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; it is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, darling! I will never speak of  doubt again. You are my own sweet wife, and shall be honoured and trusted to  the end of my days. Thank God, the cloud is past, and we can be happy again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose from her low seat by the fire, and put her  arms round his neck, and hid her face upon his breast, sobbing hysterically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own dear girl, I have been cruel to you &mdash;  brutal and unkind; but you would forgive me if you knew what I have suffered  since noon yesterday; and, indeed, my suffering began before then. That man&rsquo;s  harping on Lostwithiel&rsquo;s name in all his talk with you &mdash; his air of meaning  more than he said &mdash; and your embarrassment, awakened suspicions that had to be  set at rest somehow. Remember the disadvantages under which I labour &mdash; the  difference in our ages; my unattractiveness as compared with younger men. These  things predisposed me to doubt your love. I have not had a moment&rsquo;s peace since  the night of that odious dinner-party. Yes; I have felt a new sensation. I know  what jealousy means. But it is past. Praise be to God, it is past. I have come  out of the cloud again. Oh, my love, had it been otherwise! Had we been doomed  to part!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have done, Martin?&rdquo; she asked, in a  low voice, with her face still hidden against his breast, his arms still round  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would I have done, love? Nothing to bring  shame on you. Nothing to add to your dishonour or sharpen the agony of remorse.  I should have taken my son &mdash; my son could not be left under the shadow of a  mother&rsquo;s shame. He and I would have vanished out of your life. You would have  heard no more of us. The world would have known nothing. You would have been  cared for and protected from further evil &mdash; protected from your own frailty. So  far, I would have done my duty as your husband to the last day of my life; but  you and I would never have looked upon each other again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Disney and his wife stayed in London two  days; perhaps to give a colour to their sudden and in somewise unexplained  journey; but Isola refused all her sister&rsquo;s invitations, to lunch, to drive, to  dine, to go to an afternoon concert at the Albert Hall, or to see the last  Shakespearean revival at the Lyceum. She pleaded various excuses; and Gwendolen  had to be satisfied with one visit, at afternoon teatime, when husband and wife  appeared together, on the eve of their return to Cornwall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was too bad of you not to come to me yesterday  morning, as you promised,&rdquo; Gwendolen said to her sister. &ldquo;I stayed indoors till  after luncheon on your account; and the days are so short at this time of year.  I couldn&rsquo;t do any shopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hazelrigg was one of those young women for  whom life is flavourless when they have nothing to buy. She was so well  supplied with everything that women desire or care for that she had to invent  wants for herself. She had to watch the advertisements in order to tempt  herself with some new wish; were it only for a patent toast-rack, or a new  design in ivory paper-knives. The stationers helped to keep life in her by  their new departures in writing-paper. Papyrus, Mandarin, Telegraphic, Good  Form, Casual, mauve, orange, scarlet, verdigris green. So long as the thing was  new it made an excuse for sitting in front of a counter and turning over the  contents of a show-case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never came to look at my drawing-room by  daylight,&rdquo; she went on complainingly. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t possibly judge the tints by  lamplight. Every chair is of a different shade. I think you have treated me  shamefully. I have sent you more telegrams than I could count. And I had such  lots to talk about. Have you heard from Dinan lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since August, when mother wrote in answer to  our invitation for her and father to spend a month with us. I felt it was  hopeless when I wrote to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Utterly hopeless! Nothing will tempt her to cross  the sea. She writes about it as if it were the Atlantic. And Lucy Folkestone  tells me she is getting stouter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, naturally. There&rsquo;s no fear of Lucy ever being  anything but bones. Mother is stouter and more sedentary than ever, Lucy says.  It&rsquo;s really dreadful. One doesn&rsquo;t know where it will end,&rdquo; added Gwendolen,  looking down at her own somewhat portly figure, as if fearing hereditary evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to take Isa and the boy to Dinan next  summer,&rdquo; said Disney. &ldquo;It is no use asking the father and mother to cross the  channel; though I think they would both like to see their grandson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother raved about him in her last letter to me,&rdquo;  replied Gwendolen. &ldquo;She was quite overcome by the photograph you sent her, only  she has got into such a groove &mdash; her knitting, her novel, her little walk on  the terrace, her long consultations with Toinette about the smallest domestic  details &mdash; whether the mattresses shall be unpicked to-day or to-morrow, or  whether the <em>lessive</em> shall be a week  earlier or a week later. It is dreadful to think of such a life,&rdquo; added  Gwendolen, as if her own existence were one of loftiest aims.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  &ldquo;Sorrow That&rsquo;s Deeper Than We Dream, Perchance&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Life flowed on its monotonous course, like the  Fowey river gliding down from Lostwithiel to the sea; and there seemed nothing  in this world that could again disturb Martin Disney&rsquo;s domestic peace.  Vansittart Crowther made no further attempt to avenge himself for the night  attack upon his gates; nor did he demand any apology for the vulgar abuse which  he had suffered in the sanctuary of his own library. This he endured, and even  further outrage, in the shape of the following letter from Colonel Disney: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;As you have been pleased to take a certain  old-womanish interest in my domestic affairs, I think it may be as well to  satisfy your curiosity so far as to inform you that when your solicitor  travelled in the same train with my wife, she was returning from a visit to her  married sister&rsquo;s house, a visit which had my sanction and approval. I can only  regret that her husband&rsquo;s modest means constrained her to travel alone, and  subjected her to the impertinent attentions of one cad and to the slanderous  aspersions of another.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I have the honour to be,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Yours, etc.,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Martin Disney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Crowther treated this letter with the silent  contempt which he told himself it merited. What could he say to a man so  possessed by uxorious hallucinations, so steeped in the poppy and mandragora of  a blind affection, that reason had lost all power over his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoke plain enough &mdash; as plain as I dared,&rdquo; said  Mr. Crowther. &ldquo;He may ride the high horse and bluster as much as he likes. I  don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll ever feel quite happy again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet in spite of hints and insinuations from the  enemy at his gates, Martin Disney was happy &mdash; utterly happy in the love of his  young wife, and in the growing graces of his infant son. He no longer doubted  Isola&rsquo;s affection. Her tender regard for him showed itself in every act of her  life; in every look of the watchful face that was always on the alert to divine  his pleasure, to forestall his wishes. Mrs. Baynham went about everywhere  expatiating on the domestic happiness of the Disney family, to whom she was  more than ever devoted, now that she felt herself in a manner related to them,  having been elevated to the position of godmother to the firstborn &mdash; a very  different thing to being godmother to some sixth or seventh link in the family-chain,  when all thought of selection has been abandoned, and the only question mooted  by the parents has been, &ldquo;What good-natured friend <em>can</em> we ask this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Hulbert took his yacht to other waters in  November, only to come sailing back again in December, when he finally laid up  the <em>Vendetta</em> in winter quarters, and  took up his abode at the Mount, where he availed himself of his brother&rsquo;s stud,  which had been reduced to two old hunters and a pair of carriage-horses of  mediocre quality. And so the shortening days drew on towards Christmas; baby&rsquo;s  first Christmas, as that small person&rsquo;s adorers remarked &mdash; as if it were a  wonderful thing for any young Christian to make a beginning of life &mdash; and all  was happiness at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest. All was happiness without a cloud, till one  morning &mdash; Allegra and her brother being alone in the library, where she  sometimes painted at her little table-easel, while he read &mdash; she put down her  palette and went over to him, laying her hand upon his shoulder as he sat in  his accustomed place in the old-fashioned bow-window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin, I want to speak to you about Isola,&rdquo; she  said, rather tremulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about her? Why, she was here this minute,&rdquo; he  exclaimed. &ldquo;Is there anything amiss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think she is so strong as she ought to  be. You may not notice, perhaps. A woman is quicker to see these things than a  man &mdash; and she and I used to walk and row together &mdash; I am able to see the  difference in her since last year. She seems to me to have been going back in  her health for the last month or two, since her wonderful recovery from her  illness. Don&rsquo;t be anxious, Martin!&rdquo; she said, answering his agonized look. &ldquo;I  feel sure there is nothing that a little care cannot cure; but I want to put  you on your guard. I asked her to let me send for Mr. Baynham, and she  refused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he sees her two or three times a week &mdash; he is  in and out like one of ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t see her professionally. He comes in  hurriedly late in the evening &mdash; or between the lights &mdash; to fetch his wife. He  is tired, and we all talk to him, and Isa is bright and lively. He is not  likely to notice the change in her in that casual way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am sure there is. Although I see her every  day, I am conscious of the change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baynham shall talk to her this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Martin &mdash; and if I were you I&rsquo;d have  the doctor from Plymouth again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Life had been so full of bliss lately, and yet he  had not been afraid. Yes, it was the old story. &ldquo;Metuit secundis.&rdquo; That is what  the wise man does. Fools do otherwise &mdash; hug themselves in their short-lived  gladness, and say in their hearts, &ldquo;There is no death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Baynham came in the afternoon, in answer to a  little note from Martin Disney, and he and Isola were closeted together in the  library for some time, with baby&rsquo;s nurse in attendance to assist her mistress  in preparing for the ordeal by stethoscope. Happily that little instrument  which thrills us all with the aching pain of fear when we see it in the  doctor&rsquo;s hand, told no evil tidings of Isola&rsquo;s lungs or heart. There was  nothing organically wrong &mdash; but the patient was in a very weak state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really are uncommonly low,&rdquo; said Mr. Baynham,  looking at her intently as she stood before him in the wintry sunlight. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve been doing to yourself to bring yourself down so much  since last summer &mdash; after all the trouble I took to build you up, too. I&rsquo;m  afraid you&rsquo;ve been worrying yourself about the youngster &mdash; a regular young  Hercules. I don&rsquo;t know whether he&rsquo;d be up to strangling a pair of prize  pythons; but I&rsquo;m sure he could strangle you. I shall send you a tonic; and  you&rsquo;ll have to take a good deal more care of yourself than you seem to have  been taking lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he laid down severe rules as to diet,  until it seemed to Isola that he wished her to be eating and drinking all day &mdash;  new-laid eggs, cream, old port, beef-tea &mdash; all the things which she had loathed  in the dreary days of her long illness.</p>
<p>Mr. Baynham had a serious talk with the colonel  after he left Isola, and it was agreed between them that she should be taken to  Plymouth next day to see the great authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are giving yourself a great deal too much  trouble about me, Martin,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is nothing wrong. I am only a  little weak and tired sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband looked at her heart-brokenly. Weak and  tired. Yes; there were all the signs of failing life in those languid movements  of the long, slender limbs, in the transparent pallor of the ethereal  countenance. Decay was lovely in this fair young form; but he felt that it was  decay. There must be something done to stop Misfortune&rsquo;s hastening feet.</p>
<p>He questioned his wife, he questioned his own  memory, as to when the change had begun, and on looking back thus thoughtfully  it seemed to him that her spirits and her strength had flagged from the time of  Captain Hulbert&rsquo;s arrival at Fowey. She had seemed tolerably cheerful until  then, interested in life, ready to participate in any amusement or occupation  of Allegra&rsquo;s; but from the beginning of their yachting excursions there had  been a change. She had shrunk from any share in their plans or expeditions. She  had gone on board the yacht &mdash; on the two or three occasions when she had been  persuaded to go &mdash; with obvious reluctance, and she had been silent and joyless all  the time she was there. Within the last fortnight, when Captain Hulbert had  pressed her to go to luncheon or afternoon tea at the Mount, she had  persistently refused. She had begged her husband to take Allegra, and to excuse  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The walk up the hill would tire me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My love, why should we walk? I will drive you  there, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really had rather not go. I can&rsquo;t bear leaving  baby so long; and there is no necessity for me to be with you. Allegra is the  person who is wanted. You must understand that, Martin. You can see how much  Captain Hulbert admires her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am to go and play propriety while you do  baby-worship at home. Rather hard upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This kind of thing had occurred three or four times  since the sailor&rsquo;s establishment at the Mount, and Colonel Disney had attached  no significance to the matter; but now that he had begun to torture himself by  unending speculations upon the cause of her declining health, he could but  think that Captain Hulbert&rsquo;s society had been distasteful to her. It might be  that Mr. Crowther&rsquo;s insulting allusions to Lord Lostwithiel had made any  association with that name painful; and yet this would seem an overstrained  sensitiveness, since her own innocence of all evil should have made her  indifferent to a vulgarian&rsquo;s covert sneers.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  &ldquo;The Year Of The Rose Is Brief&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Mr. Baynham accompanied his patient and her husband  to Plymouth, where the family adviser of Trelasco had a long and serious talk  with the leading medical light of the great seaport. The result of which  consultation &mdash; after the tossing to and fro of such words as an&aelig;mia, atrophy,  family history, hysteria, between the two doctors, as lightly as if diseases  were shuttle-cocks &mdash; was briefly communicated to Colonel Disney in a sentence  that struck terror to his heart, carefully as it was couched. It amounted in  plain words to this: We think your wife&rsquo;s condition serious enough to cause  alarm, although there are at present no indications of organic disease. Should  her state of bodily weakness and mental depression continue, we apprehend  atrophy, or perhaps chronic hysteria. Under these circumstances, we strongly  recommend you to give her a change of scene, and a milder winter climate even  than that of the west of England. Were she living in Scotland or Yorkshire we  might send her to Penzance; but as it is we should advise either a sea voyage,  or a residence for the rest of the winter at Pau, Biarritz, or on the Riviera.</p>
<p>Modern medicine has a high-handed way of sending  patients to the uttermost ends of the earth; and although Martin Disney thought  with a regretful pang of the house and stables that he had built and beautified  for himself, the garden where every shrub was dear, yet he felt grateful to the  specialist for not ordering him to take his wife to the banks of the Amazon or  to some sheltered valley in Cashmere. Pau is not far &mdash; the Riviera is the  beaten track of civilized Europe, the highway road to Naples and the East. He  thought of the happy honeymoon, when he and his bright young wife had travelled  along that garden of oranges and lemons, between the hills and the sea, and how  there had been no shadow on their lives except the shadow of impending  separation, about which they had talked hopefully, trying to believe that a  year or two would not seem very long, trying to project their thoughts into  that happy future when there should be no more parting.</p>
<p>This &mdash; this dreary present &mdash; was that future which  they had pictured as a period of unalloyed bliss. What had the future brought  to that hopeful husband, going forth at the call of duty, to return with  fondest expectations when his work was done? What but a year and a half of  wedded life overshadowed by disappointment, darkened by vague doubts? And now  came the fear of a longer parting than had lain at the end of his last Italian  journey.</p>
<p>The patient herself was told nothing except that  change to a warmer climate would be good for her, and that her husband had  promised to take her to the South soon after Christmas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will like to go, won&rsquo;t you, Isola?&rdquo; he asked  her tenderly, as they drove back to the station alone, leaving Mr. Baynham to  follow his own devices in the town. &ldquo;You will enjoy seeing the places we saw  together when our marriage was still a new thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall like to go anywhere with you, Martin,&rdquo; she  answered. &ldquo;But is it really necessary to go away? I know you love Trelasco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have the Cornishman&rsquo;s passion for his native  soil; but I am not so rooted to it as to pine in exile. I shall be happy enough  in the South, with my dear young wife; especially if I see the roses come back  to your cheeks in that land of flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will cost you such a lot of money to take  us all away, Martin; and you could not leave Allegra or the baby. Doctors have  such expensive ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allegra, and the boy! Must we take them, do you  think, love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could not leave him,&rdquo; said Isola, horrified at  the bare suggestion; &ldquo;and it would be very hard to leave Allegra. She bore all  the burden of my illness. She has been so good and unselfish. And she will so  revel in the South. She has never travelled, she, for whom Nature means so much  more than it can for you or me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will take Allegra, and the boy, whose  railway ticket will cost nothing, and his nurse. There is a shot in the locker  still, Isa, in spite of last year&rsquo;s building operations, which cost a good deal  more than I expected. We will all migrate together. Consider that settled. The  only question that remains is the direction in which we shall go. Shall we make  for the Pyrenees or the Maritime Alps? Shall we go to Pau, and Biarritz, or to  the Riviera, Hy&egrave;res, Cannes, Nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola was in favour of Pau, but after much  consultation of books recording other people&rsquo;s experiences, it was finally  decided that of all places in the world, San Remo was the best winter home for  Martin Disney&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can take her up to the Engadine in June,&rdquo; said  Mr. Baynham, who had a superficial familiarity with the Continent from hearing  his patients talk about their travels, he himself never having left Cornwall, except  for a plunge into the metropolitan vortex during the Cattle Show week. &ldquo;Or you  may spend your summer in Auvergne &mdash; unless you want to come home as soon as the  cold weather is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do whatever may be best for her &mdash; home or  otherwise,&rdquo; answered Disney. &ldquo;You may be sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor went back to his wife, with whom he  always discussed everything, except purely professional matters &mdash; there were  even occasions when he could not refrain from enlarging upon the interesting  features of some very pretty case &mdash; and was enthusiastic in his praise of  Colonel Disney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw such devotion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Any other  man would think it hard lines to have to strike his tent at a day&rsquo;s notice, and  go off to winter at a strange place, among invalids and old women; but Disney  says never a word of his own inclinations or his own inconvenience. He  positively adores that young woman. I only hope she&rsquo;s worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very fond of him, Tom,&rdquo; replied Mrs.  Baynham, decisively. &ldquo;There was a time when I was rather doubtful about that.  She seemed listless and indifferent. But since the baby came she has been  growing fonder and fonder of her husband. I flatter myself I am a pretty good  judge of countenances, and I can read hers. I&rsquo;ve seen her face light up when the  colonel came into the room. I&rsquo;ve seen her go over to him shyly, as if it were  still their honeymoon. She&rsquo;s a very sweet creature. I took to her from the  first; and I shall be dreadfully upset if she goes into a decline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor shook his head despondently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to fight with in her case,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s very little to fall back upon. I can&rsquo;t make her out. She has  gone off just like a girl who was simply fretting herself to death; and yet, if  she&rsquo;s fond of her husband, what in Heaven&rsquo;s name is there for her to fret  about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered his wife. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a delicate  constitution, that&rsquo;s all. She&rsquo;s like one of those grape hyacinths that never  will stand upright in a vase. The stem isn&rsquo;t strong enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allegra was all sympathy and affection. She would  go with them &mdash; yes, to the end of the world. To go to San Remo would be  delightful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a deliciously paintable place, I know,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;for I have seen bits of the scenery often enough in the exhibitions. I  shall work prodigiously, and earn a small fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She told her brother in the most delicate way that  she meant to pay her own expenses in this Italian tour; for of course when  Isola should be strong enough they would go about a little, and see the  Wonderland of Italy.</p>
<p>Martin protested warmly against any such  arrangement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall not go,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Do you think  me one of the incapable young women of the old school &mdash; unable to earn a  sixpence, and wanting to be paid for and taken care of like a child? I would have  you to know, sir, that I am one of the young women of the new school, who  travel third-class, ride on the tops of omnibuses, and earn their own living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall take a house at San Remo, Allegra. Do  you expect me to turn innkeeper &mdash; charge you for your bed and board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are monstrously proud. You can do as you  like in your own house, I suppose. But all travelling and hotel expenses will  be my affair, remember that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t mind leaving Trelasco?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am like Ruth. You are my home and my country.  Where thou goest I will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Captain Hulbert &mdash; how will he like to lose  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to Captain Hulbert?&rdquo; she asked, trying  to laugh off the question, but blushing deeply as she bent over her colour-box,  suddenly interested in the littered contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal, I fancy, though he may not have  found plain speech for his feelings yet awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If &mdash; if you are not a very foolish person, and  there is any foundation for your absurd idea, Captain Hulbert will know where  to find us. He can spread his wings and follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>Vendetta</em>?  Yes, she is pretty familiar with the bays and bights of the Mediterranean. No  doubt he will follow us, dear. But I should like him to speak out before we  go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m afraid you will be disappointed. He likes  coming here &mdash; he likes you and Isola, and perhaps he likes me, pretty well,  after a fashion; but sailors are generally fickle, are they not? And if he is  at all like his brother, Lord Lostwithiel, who seems to have a dreadful  reputation, judging by the way people talk of him here &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not like his brother in character or  disposition. If he were, I should be sorry for my sister to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you such a very bad opinion of his brother?&rdquo;  asked Allegra, shocked and grieved that any one closely allied to John Hulbert  should bear an evil repute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that would be too much to say. I know so  little about him. I have scarcely seen him since he was a lad &mdash; only I have  heard things which have prejudiced me,&rdquo; continued Disney, lapsing into moody  thoughtfulness.</p>
<p>Was it not Mr. Crowther&rsquo;s insolence, and that  alone, which had prejudiced him against Lostwithiel &mdash; had made the very name  hateful to him? Yes, that was the cause of his aversion. He had disproved those  insolent insinuations; he had exploded the covert slander and rebuked the  slanderer; but he had not forgotten. The wound still rankled.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  &ldquo;No Sudden Fancy Of An Ardent Boy&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It was Christmas Eve. All things were arranged for  departure on the 28th, which would give time for their arrival at San Remo on  New Year&rsquo;s Day. They were to travel by easy stages, by Amiens, Basle, and  Lucerne. A good deal of luggage had been sent off in advance, and trunks and  portmanteaux were packed ready for the start; so that the travellers could take  their ease during the few days of Christmas church-going and festivity. Isola&rsquo;s  spirits had improved wonderfully since the journey had been decided upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems like beginning a new life, Martin,&rdquo; she  told her husband. &ldquo;I feel ever so much better already. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m an  impostor, and that you are taking a great deal of unnecessary trouble on my  account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was such a relief to think that she would see  Vansittart Crowther no more, that she could wander where she pleased without  the hazard of meeting that satyr-like countenance, those pale protruding eyes,  with malevolent stare &mdash; such a relief to know that she would be in a new  country, where no one would know anything about her, or have any inclination to  gossip about her. Something of her old gaiety and interest in life revived at  the prospect of those new surroundings.</p>
<p>They were to put up at an hotel for the first few  days, so as to take their time in looking for a villa. Two servants were to go  with them &mdash; the colonel&rsquo;s valet and handy-man, who was an old soldier, and  could turn his hand to anything in house, or stable, or garden; and the baby&rsquo;s  nurse, a somewhat masterful person of seven and twenty, from the Fatherland,  surnamed Grunhaupt, but known in the family by her less formidable domestic  diminutive L&ouml;ttchen. Other hirelings would be obtained at San Remo, but these  two were indispensable &mdash; Holford, the soldier-servant, to bear all burdens, and  L&ouml;ttchen to take charge of the baby, to whom life was supposed to be impossible  in any other care.</p>
<p>It was Christmas Eve &mdash; the mildest Christmas that  had been known for a long time, even in this sheltered corner of the coast.  Allegra had been busy all the morning, helping in the church decorations, and  co-operating with Mr. Colfox in various arrangements for the comfort of the old  and sick and feeble, among the cottages scattered over the length and breadth  of a large parish. She had walked a good many miles, and she had stood for an  hour in the church, toiling at the decoration of the font, which had been  assigned to her, and which she covered with ferns, arbutus, and berberis  foliage, in all their varieties of colour, from darkest bronze to vivid  crimson, starred with the whiteness of Christmas roses; while the Miss  Crowthers lavished the riches of the Glenaveril hothouses upon the pulpit,  keeping themselves studiously aloof from Miss Leland.</p>
<p>Not a jot cared Allegra for their aloofness. She  disliked their father, and she knew that her brother detested him, without  having any clear idea of the cause. She was so thoroughly loyal to Martin that  she would have deemed it treason to like any one whom he disliked; so had the  daughters of Glenaveril been the most companionable young women in Cornwall she  would have considered it her duty to hold them at arm&rsquo;s length. Glenaveril and  all its belongings were taboo.</p>
<p>She was very tired when she went home at four  o&rsquo;clock, just on the edge of dusk here &mdash; pitch dark, no doubt, in London and  other great cities, where the poor, pinched faces were flitting to and fro in  the fitful glare of the butcher&rsquo;s gas, intent on finding a Christmas joint to  fit the slenderest resources. Here, in this quiet valley, the reflected  sun-glow still brightened sky, sea, land, and river, and the lamps had not yet  been lighted in hall or drawing-room at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest.</p>
<p>There was a pleasant alternation of firelight and  shadow in the long double room, the flames leaping up every now and then, and  lighting wall and bookcase, picture and bust, the blue and red of the Mandarin  jars, and the golden storks on the black Japanese screen; but it was such a  capricious light that it did not show Allegra some one sitting <em>perdu</em> in Martin Disney&rsquo;s deep elbow  chair, a person who sat and watched her with an admiring smile, as she flung  off her little felt hat and fur cape, and stretched her arms above her head in  sheer weariness, a graceful, picturesque figure, in her plain brown serge gown,  belted round the supple waist, and clasped at the throat, like Enid&rsquo;s, and with  never an ornament except the oxydized silver clasps, and the serviceable  chatelaine hanging at her side.</p>
<p>The tea-table was set ready in front of the fire,  the large Moorish tray on bamboo legs. But there was no sign of Isola; so Miss  Leland poured out a cup of tea and began to drink it, still unconscious of a  pair of dark eyes watching her from the shadow of the big armchair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And am I to have no tea, Miss Leland?&rdquo; asked a  voice out of the darkness.</p>
<p>Allegra gave a little scream, and almost dropped  her cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;How can you  startle any one like that? How do you know that I have not heart disease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would as soon suspect the goddess Hygeia of  that, or any other ailment,&rdquo; said Captain Hulbert, rising to his full six feet  two, out of the low chair in the dark corner by the bookcase. &ldquo;Forgive me for  my bearishness in sitting here while you were in the room. I could not resist  the temptation to sit and watch you for a minute or two while you were  unconscious of my presence. It was like looking at a picture. While you are  talking I am so intent upon what you say, and what you think, that I almost  forget to consider what you are like. To-night I could gaze undistracted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What absolute nonsense you talk,&rdquo; said Allegra,  with the sugar-tongs poised above the basin. &ldquo;One lump &mdash; or two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three &mdash; anything you like &mdash; up to a  million.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know that you nearly made me break a  tea-cup &mdash; one of mother&rsquo;s dear old Worcester tea-cups? I should never have  forgiven you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as you didn&rsquo;t drop the tea-cup, I hope you do  forgive me for my stolen contemplation, for sitting in my corner there and  admiring you in the firelight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Firelight is very becoming. No doubt I looked  better than in the daytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. It is hardly worth while to be angry  with you. I shall be a thousand miles away next week. I could not carry my  resentment so far. It would cool on the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand miles is not far for the <em>Vendetta</em>, Miss Leland. She would make  light of crossing the Pacific &mdash; for a worthy motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about motives; but I thought  you were fairly established at the Mount, and that you had made an end of your  wanderings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mount is only delightful &mdash; I might say  endurable &mdash; when I have neighbours at the Angler&rsquo;s Nest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin will let this house, perhaps, and you may  have pleasant neighbours in the new people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not like the domestic cat. It is not houses I  care for, but individuals. My affections would not transfer themselves to the  new tenants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tell that? You think of them to-night  as strangers &mdash; and they seem intolerable. You would like them after a week, and  be warmly attached to them at the end of a month. Why, you have known us for  less than three months, and we fancy ourselves quite old friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Leland, is our friendship only fancy?  Will a thousand miles make you forget me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we could not any of us be so ungrateful as to  forget you,&rdquo; answered Allegra, struggling against growing embarrassment,  wondering if this tender tone, these vague nothings, were drifting towards a  declaration, or were as simply meaningless as much of the talk between men and  women. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t forget how kind you have been, and what delightful excursions  we have had on the <em>Vendetta</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>Vendetta</em> will be at San Remo when you want her, Allegra. She will be as much at your  command there as she has been here; and her skipper will be as much your slave  as he is here &mdash; as he has been almost ever since he saw your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not small talk. This meant something very  serious. He had called her Allegra, and she had not reproved him; he had taken  her hand and she had not withdrawn it. In the next instant, she knew not how,  his arm was round her waist, and her head, weary with the long day&rsquo;s work and  anxieties, was resting contentedly on his shoulder, while his lips set their  first kiss, tenderly, reverently almost, on her fair broad brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allegra, this means yes, does it not? Our lives  have flowed on together so peacefully, so happily, since last October. They are  to mingle and flow on together to the great sea, are they not, love &mdash; the sea  of death and eternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really care for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I really adore you? Yes, dear love. With all my  power of adoration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must have cared for other girls before  now. I can&rsquo;t believe that I am the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe, at least, that you will be the last, as  you are the only woman I ever asked to be my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that really, really true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true as the needle to the north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet they say that sailors &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are generally tolerable dancers, and popular in a ball-room,  especially when they are the givers of the ball &mdash; that they can talk to pretty  women without feeling abashed &mdash; and that they contrive to get through a good  deal of flirting without singeing their wings. I have waltzed with a good many  nice girls in my time, Allegra, and I have sat out a good many waltzes. Yet I  am here at your side, honestly and devotedly your own; and I have never loved  any other woman with the love I feel for you. No other woman has ever held my  whole heart; no, not for a single hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make nice distinctions,&rdquo; said Allegra, gently  disengaging herself from his arm, and looking at him with a faint, shy smile,  very doubtful, yet very anxious to believe. &ldquo;I am dreadfully afraid that all  this fine talk means nothing more than you would say to any of your partners,  if you happened to be sitting out a waltz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I ask any of my partners to be my wife, do  you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can withdraw that to-morrow &mdash; forget and  ignore it. We may both consider it only a kind of under-the-mistletoe  declaration, meaning no more than a mistletoe kiss. I believe when English  people were domestic and kept Christmas, the head of the family would have  kissed his cook if he had met her under the mistletoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allegra, is it not cruel of you to be jocose when  I am so tremendously serious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I don&rsquo;t believe in your seriousness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this only a polite way of refusing me?&rdquo; he  asked, beginning to be offended, not understanding that this nonsense-talk was  a hasty defence against overpowering emotion, that she was not sure of him, and  was desperately afraid of betraying herself. &ldquo;Am I to understand that you don&rsquo;t  care a straw for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; she cried eagerly, &ldquo;as a friend, I  like you better than any one else in the world; only I don&rsquo;t want to give you  more than friendship till I can trust you well enough to believe in your love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prove it, Allegra,&rdquo; he cried, clasping her waist  again before she was aware. &ldquo;Put me to any test or any trial &mdash; impose any duty  upon me. Only tell me that if I come through the ordeal you will be my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not in a great hurry to fetter yourself, I  hope?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in a hurry &mdash; I long for those sweet fetters  by which your love will hold me. I want to be anchored by my happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a year of freedom, a year for art and  earnest work in Italy, a year for Martin and Isola, who both want me; and if  this night year you are still of the same mind, I will be your wife. I will not  engage you. You may be as free as air to change your mind and love some one  else; but I will promise to be true to you and to this talk of ours till the  year&rsquo;s end &mdash; one year from to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accept your sentence, though it is severe; but I  don&rsquo;t accept my freedom. I am your slave for a year. I shall be your slave when  the year is out. I am yours, and yours alone for life. And now give me that cup  of tea, Allegra, which you have not poured out yet, and let us fancy ourselves  Darby and Joan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darby and Joan,&rdquo; echoed Allegra, as she filled his  cup. &ldquo;Must we be like that: old and prosy, sitting by the fire, while life goes  by us outside? It seems sad that there should be no alternative between slow  decay and untimely death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sad; but the world is made so. And then  Providence steeps elderly people in a happy hallucination. They generally  forget that they are old; or at least they forget that they ever were young,  and they think young people so ineffably silly that youth itself seems  despicable to their sober old minds. But you and I have a long life to the  good, dear love, before the coming of grey hairs and elderly prejudices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he began to talk of ways and means, as if  they were going to be married next week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have enough for bread and cheese,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;I am better off than a good many younger sons; for a certain old  grandfather of mine provided for the younger branches. It is quite possible  that Lostwithiel may never marry &mdash; indeed, he seems to me very decided against  matrimony, and in that case those who come after us must inherit title and  estate in days to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t talk so,&rdquo; cried Allegra, horrified. &ldquo;It  sounds as if you were speculating upon your brother&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Lostwithiel&rsquo;s death? Not for worlds. God bless  him, wherever he may be. You don&rsquo;t know how fond we two fellows are of each  other. Only when a man is going to be married it behoves him to think even of  the remote future. I shall have to talk to the colonel, remember; and he will  expect me to be business-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think Martin mercenary,&rdquo; said  Allegra. &ldquo;There never was a man who set less value on money. It wouldn&rsquo;t make  any difference to him if you had not a penny. And as for me, I have a little  income from my mother &mdash; more than enough to buy frocks and things &mdash; and beyond  that I can earn my own living. So you really needn&rsquo;t trouble yourself about  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a touching simplicity in her speech,  mingled with a slight flavour of audacity, as of an emancipated young woman,  which amused her lover, reminding him of a heroine of Murger&rsquo;s, or Musset&rsquo;s, a  brave little grisette, who was willing to work hard for the <em>m&eacute;nage &agrave; deux</em>, and who wanted nothing  from her lover but love. He looked into the candid face, radiant in the  fire-glow, and he told himself that this was just the one woman for whom his  heart had kept itself empty, like a temple waiting for its god, in all the  years of his manhood. And now the temple doors had opened wide, the gates had  been lifted up, and the goddess had marched to her place, triumphant and  all-conquering.</p>
<p>The clock on the mantelpiece struck six, and the  old eight-day clock in the hall followed like a solemn echo. Captain Hulbert  started up. &ldquo;So late! Why, we have been talking for nearly two hours!&rdquo; he  exclaimed, &ldquo;and I have a budget of letters to write for the night mail.  Good-bye, darling &mdash; or I&rsquo;ll say <em>au revoir</em>,  for I&rsquo;ll walk down again after dinner, and get half an hour&rsquo;s chat with Disney,  if you don&rsquo;t think it will be too late for me to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know he is always pleased to see you &mdash; we are  not very early people &mdash; and this is Christmas Eve. We were to sit round the  fire and tell ghost-stories, don&rsquo;t you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we were. I shall be here soon after  nine, and I shall think over all the grizzly legends I ever heard, as I come  down the hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went reluctantly, leaving her standing by the  fire, a contemplative figure with downcast eyes. At a little later stage in  their engagement no doubt she would have gone with him to the door, or even out  to the garden gate, for a lingering parting under the stars &mdash; but there was a  shyness about them both in this sweet dim beginning of their union, when it was  so strange to each to have any claim upon the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lightly she took the whole business,&rdquo; Captain  Hulbert said to himself as he went up the hill. &ldquo;Yet her voice trembled now and  then &mdash; and her hand was deadly cold when first I clasped it. I think she loves  me. A year,&rdquo; &mdash; snapping his fingers gaily at the stars&mdash; &ldquo;what is a year? A year  of bliss if it be mostly spent with her. Besides, long engagements are apt to  dwindle. I have seen such engagements &mdash; entered on solemnly like ours to-night  &mdash; shrink to six months, or less. Why should one linger on the threshold of a  new life, if one knows it is going to be completely happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blissful lover had not been gone five minutes  when Isola came creeping into the room, and put her arm round Allegra&rsquo;s neck  and kissed her flushed cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Isa, where have you been hiding all this  evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had fallen asleep in my room, just half an hour  before tea, and when I awoke it was five o&rsquo;clock, and L&ouml;ttchen told me you and  Captain Hulbert were in the drawing-room. And as I know you two have always so  much to talk about, I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t disturb you. So I let L&ouml;ttchen make  tea for me in the nursery, and I stayed there to play with baby. And here you  are all in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we had the firelight &mdash; Parker forgot to bring  the lamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you forgot to ring for it,&rdquo; said Isola, going  over to the bow-window, and drawing back a curtain. &ldquo;What a lovely sky! Who  would think it was Christmas-time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon was in her second quarter, shining  brilliantly, in the deep purple of a sky almost without a cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you put on your hat and jacket and come for a  stroll in the garden, Isa?&rdquo; asked Allegra. &ldquo;It is a mild, dry night, and I  don&rsquo;t think the air can hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt me! It will do me all the good in the world.  Yes, I shall be ready in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went out into the hall, where Allegra packed  her sister-in-law carefully in a warm, fur-lined jacket, and flung a tartan  shawl round her own shoulders. Then they went out into the garden, and to the  lawn by the river. The moon was shining on the running water, brightly, coldly,  clear, while the meadows on the opposite bank were wrapped in faint, white  mists, which made all the landscape seem unreal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not too tired for walking here after your  long day, Allegra?&rdquo; Isola asked, when they had gone up and down the path two or  three times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired, no. I could walk to Tywardreath. I could  walk to the Mausoleum. Shall we go there? The sea must be lovely under that  moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest, it is nearly seven o&rsquo;clock, and you  have been tramping about all day. If you are not very tired, you must be very  much excited, Allegra. I am longing to hear what it all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really, now? Do you care about it, Isola?  Can you, who are firmly anchored in the haven of marriage, feel any sentimental  interest in other people, tossing about on the sea of courtship? Martin is to  be told everything to-night &mdash; so you may as well know all about it now. You  like Captain Hulbert, don&rsquo;t you, Isola?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, indeed. I like him, and believe in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven! I should have been miserable if you  had doubted or disliked him. He is to be my husband some day, Isa, if Martin  approve &mdash; but not for a year, at least. Tell me, dear, are you glad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am very glad. God bless you, Allegra, and  make your life happy &mdash; and free &mdash; from &mdash; care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke down with those last faltered words, and  Allegra discovered that she was crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest Isa, don&rsquo;t cry! I shall fancy you are  sorry &mdash; that you think him unworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no. It is not that. He is worthy. He is  all that I could desire in the man who is to be your husband. No, I was only  thinking how completely happy you and he must be &mdash; how cloudless your life  promises to be. God keep you, and guard you, dear! And may you never know the  pain of parting with the husband you love &mdash; with your protector and friend &mdash; as  I have known it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, love; but that is all past and done with.  There are to be no more farewells for you and Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is past, thank God! Yet one cannot forget.  I am very glad Captain Hulbert has left the navy &mdash; that his profession cannot  call him away from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he is an idle man. I dare say the time will  come when I shall be plagued with him, and be almost obliged to suggest that he  should keep race-horses, or go on the Stock Exchange, to occupy his time. I  have heard women say that it is terrible to have a stay-at-home husband. Yet  Martin is never <em>de trop</em> &mdash; but then  Martin can bury himself in a book. He has no fidgety ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lightly you talk, Allegra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that is because my heart is heavy &mdash; heavy,  not with grief and care, but with the burden of perplexity and surprise, with  the fear that comes of a great joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do love him, then?&rdquo; said Isola, earnestly.  &ldquo;You are glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad. I am glad with all my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, dearest! I rejoice in your  happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kissed again, this time with tears on both  sides; for Allegra was now quite overcome, and sobbed out her emotion upon her  sister&rsquo;s neck; they two standing clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms beside the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I am dead, Allegra, remember always that I  loved you, and that I rejoiced in your happiness as if it were my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are dead! How dare you talk like that,  when we are taking you away to get well and strong, and to live ever so many  years beyond your golden wedding? Was there ever such ingratitude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The odour of tobacco stole on the evening air, and  they heard Martin&rsquo;s firm tread approaching along the gravel path.</p>
<p>Isola put her arm through his, while Allegra ran  into the house, and husband and wife walked up and down two or three times in  the darkness, she telling him all about the wonderful thing that had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are glad, are you not, Martin? You are as glad  as I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you so very glad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for I know that Allegra loves him, has loved  him for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning six weeks or so &mdash; allowing a fortnight for  the process of falling in love. Is that what you call a long time, Isola?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weeks are long sometimes,&rdquo; she answered, slowly,  as if her thoughts had wandered into another channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if Allegra is pleased, I suppose I ought to  be content,&rdquo; said Disney. &ldquo;Hulbert seems a fine, frank fellow, and I have never  heard anything to his discredit. He was popular in the navy, and was considered  a man of marked ability. I dare say people will call him a good match for  Allegra, so long as Lostwithiel remains a bachelor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can be too good for Allegra, and only the  best of men can be good enough. If I had my own way, I should have liked her to  remain always unmarried, and to care for nothing but her nephew and you. I  should have liked to think of her as always with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The triangular dinner-party was gayer that evening  than it had been for a long time. Isola was in high spirits, and her husband  was delighted at the change from that growing apathy which had so frightened  him. The ladies had scarcely left the table when Captain Hulbert arrived, and  was ushered into the dining-room, where Martin Disney was smoking his  after-dinner pipe in the chimney corner &mdash; the old chimney corner of that  original Angler&rsquo;s Nest, which had been a humble homestead two hundred years  ago.</p>
<p>The two men shook hands, and then John Hulbert  seated himself on the opposite side of the hearth, and they began to talk  earnestly of the future, Martin Disney speaking with fond affection of the  sister who had been to him almost as a daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her mother was the sweetest and truest of women,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;and her father had one of the most refined and delicate natures I  ever met with in a man. I do not know that he was altogether fitted for the  Church. He was wanting in energy and decision, or force of character; but he  was a firm believer, pure-minded and disinterested, and he was an artist to the  tips of his fingers. It is from him Allegra inherits her love of art; only  while he was content to trifle with art she has worked with all the power of  her strong, resolute temperament. She inherits that from her mother&rsquo;s line,  which was a race of workers, men with whom achievement was a necessity of  existence &mdash; men who fought, and men who thought &mdash; sword and gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disney smiled at the stern condition of a year&rsquo;s  probation which Allegra had imposed upon her lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such sentences are very often remitted,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I own to having some hope of mercy,&rdquo; replied  Captain Hulbert. &ldquo;People have an idea that May marriages are unlucky; and  perhaps we had better defer to a popular superstition. But it seems to me that  June is a capital month for a yachtsman&rsquo;s honeymoon; and if I can persuade my  dearest to remit half my period of probation, and fix the 1st of June for our  wedding, I should be just half a year happier than I am now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any notion yet what kind of life you are  to lead after your marriage? I hope it will not be a roving life. Isola and I  would like to have our sister near us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Allegra and I would like to study your  liking,&rdquo; laughed Hulbert. &ldquo;We may wander a little on summer seas, but we will  have our fixed abode, and it shall be near you. So long as Lostwithiel is a  bachelor, we can make our home at the Mount; but fond as I am of that dear old  place, I should be glad to see my brother married. There is something amiss in  his present mode of life; and I have but too strong reason to fear that he is  not a happy man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea of the cause of his  unhappiness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only speculative ideas &mdash; mere theories that may be  without foundation in fact. I fancy that he has burnt the lamp of life a little  too furiously, and that the light has grown dim in the socket. The after-taste  of a fiery youth is the taste of dust and ashes. There may be memories, too &mdash;  memories of some past folly &mdash; which are bitter enough to poison his life. I  know that he is unhappy. I have tried to find out the cause; and it all ends in  this &mdash; an obstinate reserve on his part, and mere theorizing on mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard that he lived in a bad set after he  left the University?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bad set &mdash; yes, that is it. A man who begins life  in a certain circle is like a workman who gets his arm or his leg caught  unawares in a machine worked by steam power. In an instant he is entangled past  rescue. He is gone. A man takes the wrong road. Ten years afterwards, perhaps,  when he is bald and wrinkled, he may pull himself up on the downward track and try  to get rid of a bad reputation and make a fresh start; but those fresh starts  rarely end in a winning race. I am very sorry for my brother. He is a  warm-hearted fellow, with a good deal of talent; and he ought not to have made  a bad thing of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope that he has pulled up in time, and  that he may get a young wife before he is many years older. I have no desire  that my sister&rsquo;s son should be a peer. I only want to see her happy with a  husband who shall be worthy of her.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  &ldquo;I Have You Still, The Sun Comes Out Again&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The New Year was just a week old, and Isola and  Allegra were standing on a terraced hillside in a country where January has  noontides as brilliant and balmy as an English June. They had travelled up that  almost perpendicular hill in a roomy landau drawn by a pair of strong horses,  and now, near the summit of the hill, on the last of those many terraces that  zig-zag up the face of the cliff, they had alighted from the carriage, and were  standing side by side upon the broad white road, at an angle where the cliff  dipped suddenly, clothed with the wild growth of stunted olive and bushy pine,  down and down to the abyss where the blue sea looked like a sapphire at the  bottom of a pit. They stood and gazed, and gazed again, almost bewildered by  the infinite beauty and variety of that dazzling prospect.</p>
<p>Below them, in the shelter of the land-locked bay,  Ospedaletti&rsquo;s pavilioned Casino shone whitely out of a garden of palm and  cactus, with terrace and balustrade vanishing down by the sea. To the right,  the steep promontory of Bordighera jutted far out into the blue; and over the  rugged crest of the hill Mentone&rsquo;s long white front lay in a gentle curve,  almost level with the sea &mdash; a strip of vivid white between the blue of the water  and the gloom of that great barren mountain wall which marks the beginning of  modern Italy. And beyond, again, showed the twin towers of Monaco; and further  still, in the dim blue distance, rose the battlemented line of the Esterelles,  dividing the fairyland of the Riviera from the workaday realities of  shipbuilding Toulon and commercial Marseilles.</p>
<p>On this side of those pine-clad mountains there  were only pleasure and fancy, wealth, fashion, the languid invalid, and the  feverish gambler; on the other side there were toilers and speculators, the  bourse and the port, the world of stern fact.</p>
<p>To the left, deep down within the hills, lay the  little harbour of San Remo, with its rugged stone pier and its shabby old  houses, and the old, old town climbing up the steep ascent to that isolated  point where the white dome of the Sanctuary shone out against the milky azure  of the noontide sky; and further and further away stretched the long line of  the olive-clothed hills, to the purple distance, where the seamen&rsquo;s church of  Madonna della Guardia stands boldly out between sky and sea, as if it were a  half-way house on the road to heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lovely it all is!&rdquo; cried Allegra. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t  you feel that one careless step upon that flowery edge yonder would send us  whirling down the cliffs to awful, inevitable death? When that man passed us  just now with his loaded cart, I felt sick with fear &mdash; the wheels seemed to  graze the brink of the abyss as the horse crept slowly along &mdash; poor stolid  brute! &mdash; unconscious of his danger. It is a dreadful drive, Isola, this zig-zag  road to Colla &mdash; slant above slant, backwards and forwards, up the face of this  prodigious cliff. I had to shut my eyes at every turn of the road, when the  world below seemed to swim in a chaos of light and colour &mdash; so beautiful, so  terrible! Do you see the height of those cliffs, terrace above terrace, hill  above hill? Why, that level road at the very bottom is the top of a taller  cliff than those I used to think so appalling at Broadstairs and Ramsgate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would make much difference to a  man who fell over the edge whether he fell here or in the Isle of Thanet,&rdquo; said  Martin Disney, as he stood, with his arm drawn through his wife&rsquo;s, sweeping the  prospect with his field glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it would! One would be only a sudden shock  and a plunge into the sea, or swift annihilation on the rocks below; but from  this awful height &mdash; think of the horror of it! To go whirling down, plucked at  here by an olive branch, or there by a jagged rock, yet always whirling  downward, rebounding from edge to edge, faster, and faster, and faster, till  one were dashed into a shapeless mass on that white road yonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think of people living up there in the  clouds, and going to sleep every night with the knowledge of this mighty wall  and that dreadful abyss in their minds!&rdquo; she concluded, pointing upward to  where the little white town of Colla straggled along the edge of the hill.</p>
<p>They were going up to see the pictures and books in  the little museum by the church. It was their first excursion, since their  arrival in Italy, for Martin Disney had been anxious that his wife should be  thoroughly rested after her long journey, before she was called upon to make  the slightest exertion. She was looking better and stronger already, they were  both agreed; and she was looking happier, a fact which gave her husband  infinite satisfaction. They had come by the St. Gothard, had rested a night at  Dover and a night at Basle, and had stopped at Lucerne for three days, and  again a couple of days at Milan, and again at Genoa, exploring the city, and  the Campo Santo in a leisurely way; Allegra exalted out of herself almost by  the delight of those wonderful collections in the palaces of the Via Balbi &mdash;  the Veroneses, the Titians, the Guidos &mdash; Isola languidly admiring, languidly  wondering at everything, but only deeply moved when they came to the strange  city of the dead, the scenic representation of sickness, calamity, grief and  dissolution, in every variety of realistic representation or of classic emblem.  Sculptured scenes of domestic sorrow, dying fathers, kneeling children, weeping  widows &mdash; whole families convulsed in the throes of that last inevitable  parting; the death of youth and beauty; the fallen rose-wreath; the funeral  urn; the lowered torch; hyacinth and butterfly; Psyche and Apollo; the fatal  river and the fatal boat; grimness and beauty &mdash; the actual and the allegorical  curiously mixed in the sculptured images that line the cold white colonnades,  where the footsteps of holiday-makers echo with a sepulchral sound under the  vaulted roof. Here Isola was intensely interested, and insisted on going up the  marble steps, flight after flight, and to the very summit of the hill of  graves, with its wide-reaching prospect of mountain, and fort, and city, and  sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think how hard it must be to lie here and know  nothing of all that loveliness,&rdquo; she said, her eyes widening with wonder as  they gazed across the varied perspective of vale and mountain, out to the faint  blue sea. &ldquo;How hard, how hard! Do they feel it and know it, Allegra? Can this I  &mdash; which feels so keenly, which only sleeps in order to enter a new world of  dreams &mdash; busier and more crowded and more eventful than the real world &mdash; can  this consciousness go out all at once like the flame of a candle &mdash; and nothing,  nothing, nothing be left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not here,&rdquo; said Allegra, with gentle  seriousness. &ldquo;It is only the husk that lies here &mdash; the flower-seed has been  carried off in God&rsquo;s great wind of death &mdash; and the flower is blossoming  somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One allegory is as good as another,&rdquo; said Isola.  &ldquo;We can but console ourselves with symbols. I don&rsquo;t like this crowded city of  the dead, Allegra. For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t let Martin have me buried here, if I  should die at San Remo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest, why will you harbour such ghastly  thoughts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was only a passing fancy. I thought it just  possible that if I were to die while we are in Italy, Martin might think to  honour me by having me laid in this splendid cemetery. He seemed so struck by  the grandeur and beauty of the monuments, just now, when we were in those  colonnades down yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Disney had lingered a little way off to  look at Mazzini&rsquo;s monument. He came up to them now, and hurried them back to  the gate, where their carriage was waiting. And so ended their last afternoon  in Genoa; and the most vivid picture of the city and its surroundings that  Isola carried away with her was the picture of those marble tombs upon the  hill, and those tall and gloomy cypresses which are the trees of death.</p>
<p>Yes, she was better, gayer, and more active &mdash; more  like the girl-wife whom Martin Disney had carried home to Cornwall, prouder  than Tristram when he sailed away with Irish Isolt.</p>
<p>The Italian sunshine had revived his fading flower,  Disney told himself, ready to love all things in a land that had brought the  smiles back to his wife&rsquo;s pale lips, and a delicate bloom to her wan cheeks.  Yes, she was happier than she had been of late in Cornwall. He saw and rejoiced  in the change.</p>
<p>They stayed at a hotel for more than a week, while  they deliberated upon the choice of a villa. They found one at last, which  seemed to realize their ideas of perfection. It was not a grand or stately  dwelling. No marble bell-tower or architectural loggia attracted the eye of the  passing pedestrian. It was roomy, and bright, and clean, and airy, built rather  in the Swiss than the Italian style, and it stood upon the slope of the hill on  the west side of the town, with nothing but olive-woods between its terraced  garden and the road that skirted the sea. It was a reminiscence of the Alps,  built by a retired merchant of Zurich, and its owner had called it Lauter  Brunnen. The house was at most two years old; but life&rsquo;s vicissitudes had left  it empty for a year and a half, and the rent asked of Colonel Disney was much  less than he had been prepared to pay.</p>
<p>The installation was full of delight for Isola and  her sister-in-law. The house afforded innumerable surprises, unexpected nooks  and corners of all kinds. There were lovely views from every window &mdash; east,  west, north, or south &mdash; and there was a garden full of roses, a garden made  upon so steep a slope that it was a succession of terraces, with but little  intervening level ground, and below the lowest terrace the valley stretched  down to the sea, a tangle of gnarled old olive trees, wan and silvery, with a  ruined gateway just seen among the foliage at the bottom of a dim grey glade.</p>
<p>To the right, straggling along the edge of the  wooded hill, appeared the white houses and churches, cupola, pinnacle, and dome  of Colla, so scattered as to seem two towns rather than one, and with  picturesque suggestions of architectural splendour that were hardly borne out  by the reality, when one climbed those rugged mule-paths, and crossed the  romantic gorge above the waterfall, and then upward and upward to the narrow  alleys and crumbling archways, and the spacious old church with its lofty  doorway standing high above the stony street.</p>
<p>Only a few paces from Colonel Disney&rsquo;s villa there  was a stately house that had gone to ruin. The roof was off in some places;  there were neither floors nor windows left; and the walls were open to the wind  and rain &mdash; frescoed walls, upon which might be traced figures of saint and  martyr, angel and madonna. There was a spacious garden, with an avenue of  cypresses &mdash; a garden where the flowers had been growing wild for years, and  where Isola and Allegra wandered and explored as they pleased. It was higher on  the hillside than their own villa, and from the eastward edge of this garden  they looked &mdash; across a yawning gulf in which lay all the lower town of San Remo  &mdash; to the Sanctuary and the Leper Hospital, conspicuous on the crest of the  opposite hill.</p>
<p>The need for Citadel and Sanctuary had passed with  the fiercer age in which they were built. Neither Saracen nor pirate menaced  San Remo nowadays; but the old white walls made a picturesque note in the  landscape, and the very name of Sanctuary had a romantic sound.</p>
<p>The first week in the new house was like a week in  fairyland. The weather was peerless &mdash; a climate that makes people forget there  is such a season as winter in the world &mdash; and the two girls wandered about in  the olive woods and climbed the mule-paths all through the fresh balmy hours or  in the hottest noontides sat in the deserted garden or in a sheltered corner  near an old stone well &mdash; one of those wells which suggest the meeting of Isaac  and Rebecca &mdash; and Allegra painted while Isola read to her, in the low sweet  voice which lent new and individual music to the sweetest verse of her favourites,  Byron, Keats, and Shelley.</p>
<p>In these sequestered spots, where only a peasant  woman laden with a basket of olives, or a padre, going from Colla to San Remo,  ever passed within sight of them, they read the Eve of St. Agnes and the Pot of  Basil &mdash; the Prisoner of Chillon, Manfred, and all those familiar lyrics and  favourite passages of Shelley which Isola held in her heart of hearts. The  wonder-dream of Alastor &mdash; the passionate lament of Adona&iuml;s, could not seem  purer or more spiritual than the life of these young women in those calm days  through which January slipped into February, unawares, like a link in a golden  chain &mdash; a chain of sunshine and flowers.</p>
<p>In February came the Carnival; and pretty little  rustic San Remo decked itself with bunting and greenery, and made believe to  hold a Battle of Flowers, which had a certain village simplicity as compared  with the serried ranks of carriages, the fashion, and beauty, and wealth of  floral displays, along the Promenade des Anglais or the Croisette. With the Carnival  came the mistral, which generally seems to be waiting round the corner ready to  leap out upon the flower-throwers, to blight their bouquets, and blow dust into  the eyes of beauty, and make the feeble health-seekers cower in the corners of  their rose-decked carriages. This Lenten season was no exception to other  seasons; and the calendar &mdash; which had been as it were in abeyance since New  Year&rsquo;s Day &mdash; came into force again &mdash; and stern and sterile Winter said, &ldquo;Here  am I. Did you think I had forgotten you?&rdquo; The invalids were roughly awakened  from their dream of Paradise, to discover that February even in San Remo meant  February, and could not always be mistaken for May or June.</p>
<p>Isola felt the change, though she was hardly  conscious of it on the day of the floral battle, when she was sitting in a  roomy landau, covered with the dark shining foliage and pale yellow fruit from  some of those lemon trees in the orchard where she and Allegra had spent their  morning hours. Allegra had planned the decorations, and had gone down to the  coach-house to assist in the work, delighted to chatter with the coachman in  doubtful Italian, groping her way in a language in which her whole  stock-in-trade consisted of a few quotations from Dante or Petrarch &mdash; and all  the wise saws of Dr. Riccabocca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have none of that horrid pepper tree which  pervades the place with its floppy foliage, and dull red fruit,&rdquo; she told  Isola, descanting on the result of her exertions. &ldquo;I was rather taken with the  pepper trees at first, but I am satiated with their languid grace. They are  like the weeping ash or the weeping willow. There is no real beauty in them. I  would rather have one of those cypresses towering up among the grey-green  olives in the valley below Colla than all the pepper trees in the public  gardens. I have used no flowers but narcissus; no colour but the pale gold of  the lemons and the dark green of the leaves; except one bit of audacity which  you will see presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was at noon, after two hours&rsquo; work in the  coach-house. An hour later the carriage was at the door.</p>
<p>Allegra&rsquo;s audacity was an Algerian curtain, a  rainbow of vivid colour, with which she had draped the back of the landau,  hiding all the ugliness of rusty leather. The carriage, or it might have been  the two girlish faces in it, one so pale and gentle, the other so brilliant and  changeful in its lights and shadows, made the point of attraction in the little  procession. Everybody spoke of the two girls in the lemon landau, with the  nice-looking, middle-aged man. Were they his daughters, people wondered, or his  nieces; and at what hotel were they staying? It was a disappointment to  discover that they were living in that villa to the west of the town, out of  the way of everything and everybody, and that they were seldom to be seen in  public, except at the new church, where they were regular worshippers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man is Colonel Disney, and the tall,  striking-looking girl is his wife,&rdquo; said one person better informed than the  rest, but making a wrong selection all the same.</p>

  &ldquo;Thou Paradise Of Exiles, Italy&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Isola was not quite so well after that drive in the  February wind and dust. She developed a slight cough &mdash; very slight and  inoffensive; but still it was a cough &mdash; and the kind and clever physician of  San Remo, who came to see her once a week or so, told her to be careful. Mr.  Baynham had written him a long letter about his patient, and the San Remo  doctor felt a friendly interest in Isola and her sister-in-law, and the baby  son in whom the whole family were so intensely interested. The infant had  accepted the change in his surroundings with supreme complaisance, and crowed  and chirruped among the lemons and the olives, and basked in the Southern  sunshine, as his nurse wheeled his perambulator to and fro upon the terraced  road behind the villa &mdash; the road which lost itself a little way further on  amidst a wilderness of olives, and dwindled into a narrow track for man or  mule.</p>
<p>The flower-battle was over, and the mistral had  gone back to the great wind-cavern to lie in wait for the next golden  opportunity; and the sun was shining once again upon the hills where the oil  mills nestled, clinging to some rough ledge beside the ever-dropping waters,  upon the labyrinthine lanes and alleys, the queer little flights of stone steps  up which a figure like Ali Baba might generally be seen leading his  heavily-laden, long-suffering donkey; upon arch and cupola, church and  market-place, and on the triple rampart of hills that shuts San Remo from the  outer world. The Disneys had been in Italy nearly seven weeks, and it seemed as  natural to Isola to open her eyes upon the broad blue waters of the  Mediterranean, the gorgeous sunrise, and the lateen sails, as on the Fowey  river and the hills towards Polruan. She had taken kindly to this Italian  exile. The sun and the blue sky had exercised a healing influence upon that  hidden wound which had once made her heart seem one dull, aching pain. She  loved this new world of wood and hill, and most of all she loved the perfect  liberty of this distant retreat, and the consolations of solitude. As for the  cough, or the pain in her side, or any of those other symptoms about which the  doctor talked to her so gravely, she made very light of them. She was happy in  her husband&rsquo;s love, happy in his society, strolling with him in the olive wood,  or the deserted garden, or down to the little toy-shop parade by the sea, where  the band played once a week; or to the other garden in the town, where the same  band performed on another day, and which was dustier and less airy than the  little plantation of palm and cactus upon the edge of the sea. She went for  excursions with him to points of especial beauty high up among the hills &mdash; to  the chocolate mill, to San Romolo, she riding a donkey, he at the animal&rsquo;s  side, while the guide trudged cheerily in the dust at the edge of the mountain  road. In the evening she played to him, or sat by his side while he smoked the  pipe of rest, or worked while he read to her. They had never been more devoted  to each other, never more like wedded lovers than they were now. People who  only knew them by sight talked of them admiringly, as if their love were an  interesting phenomenon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be twenty years older than his wife,&rdquo; said  Society, &ldquo;and yet they seem so happy together. It is quite refreshing to see  such a devoted couple nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People always seem ready and rather pleased to hold  their own age up to contempt and ridicule, as if they themselves did not belong  to it; as if they were sitting aloft in a balloon, looking down at the foolish  creatures crawling and crowding upon the earth, in a spirit of philosophical  contemplation.</p>
<p>Only one anxiety troubled Isola at this time, and  that was on Allegra&rsquo;s account rather than her own. They had left England nearly  two months, and as yet there had been no sign or token of any kind from Captain  Hulbert, not so much as a packet of new books or new music &mdash; not so much as a  magazine or an illustrated paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He asked if he might write to me, and I told him  no,&rdquo; Allegra said, rather dolefully, one morning, as they sat a little way from  the well, Allegra engaged in painting a brown-skinned peasant girl of ten years  old, whom she had met carrying olives the night before, and had forthwith  engaged as a model. &ldquo;I said it would never do for us to begin the folly of  engaged lovers, who write to each other about nothing, sometimes twice a day.  He has been wonderfully obedient: yet I think he ought to have written once or  twice in two months. He ought to have known that though I told him not to  write, I should be very anxious to hear from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be surprised at his obeying you to the  letter, Allegra. There is a kind of simplicity about him, although he is very  clever. He is so thoroughly frank and honest. It is for that I honour him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is very good,&rdquo; sighed Allegra. &ldquo;I ought  not to have told him I would have no letter-writing. I really meant what I  said. I wanted to give myself up to art, and you, for the unbroken year &mdash; to  have no other thought, no distractions &mdash; and I knew that his letters would be a  distraction &mdash; that the mere expectation of them &mdash; the looking for post time &mdash;  the wondering whether I should have his letter by this or that post &mdash; I knew  all that kind of thing would unnerve me. My hand would have lost its power. You  don&rsquo;t know what it is when all depends upon certainty of touch &mdash; the fine  obedience of the hand to the eye. No, his letters would have been a daily  agitation &mdash; and yet, and yet I should like so much to know what he is doing &mdash;  if he is still at the Mount &mdash; if he has any idea of coming to San Remo later &mdash;  with his yacht &mdash; as he talked of doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt he will come. It will be the most  natural thing for him to do. You will see the white sails some afternoon,  glorified in the sunset, like that boat yonder with its amethyst-coloured  sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola was right in her prophecy, except as to the  hour of Captain Hulbert&rsquo;s arrival. They were taking a picnic luncheon in a  little grove of lemon and orange, wedged into a cleft in the hills, on the edge  of a deep and narrow gorge down which a mountain torrent rushed to the sea.  Suddenly across the narrow strip of blue at the end of the vista came the  vision of white sails, a schooner with all her canvas spread, dazzling in the  noonday sun, sailing towards San Remo. Allegra sat gazing at the white sails,  but said never a word. Neither Martin Disney nor his wife happened to be  looking that way, till the child in his nurse&rsquo;s lap gave a sudden crow of  delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he see the pretty white ship, then?&rdquo; said the  nurse, holding him up in the sunshine. &ldquo;The beautiful white ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one took any notice. The colonel was reading his <em>Times</em>, the chief link between the  exile and civilization. Isola was intent upon knitting a soft white vestment  for her firstborn.</p>
<p>Two hours later the garden gate gave a little  click, and Captain Hulbert walked in. Allegra heard the click of the latch as  she sat in the verandah, and ran out to meet him. She had been watching and  expectant all the time, though she had held her peace about the vision of white  sails, lest she should be suspected of hoping for her lover&rsquo;s coming, and,  above all, lest she should be compassionated with later in the day, if the ship  were not the <em>Vendetta</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, it was he. She turned pale with delight at the  realization of her hope. She had hardly known till this instant how much she  loved him. She let him take her in his arms and kiss her, just as if he had  been the commonest sailor whose &ldquo;heart was true to Poll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you really glad to see me, darling?&rdquo; he  whispered, overcome by the delight of this fond welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really glad. I feel as if we had been parted for  years. No letter to tell me where you were or what you were doing! I began to  doubt if you ever cared for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heartless infidel, you told me not to write; and  so I thought the only alternative was to come. And I have been coming for the  last five weeks. We had a stiffish time across the bay &mdash; nothing to trust to  but canvas; and I had to waste a week at Toulon while my ship was under  repairs. However, here I am, and the <em>Vendetta</em> is safe and sound; and I am your most obedient slave. How is Mrs. Disney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite so well as she was two or three weeks  ago. She improved wonderfully at first, but she caught cold one bleak, blowy  day, and she has started a little nervous kind of cough, which makes us anxious  about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better spirits, I hope. Not quite so mopy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her spirits have revived wonderfully. This lovely  land has given her a new life. But there are times when she droops a little.  She is curiously sensitive &mdash; too impressionable for happiness. We have a very  fine preacher here &mdash; Father Rodwell; you must have heard him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard of him at Oxford. He was before my  time by some years; but he was a celebrity, and I heard men talk of him. Well,  what of your preacher? Has he fallen in love with my Allegra &mdash; is he in the  same boat as poor Colfox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fallen in love! No, he is not that kind of man. He  is as earnest and enthusiastic as a medi&aelig;val monk. We have all been carried  away by his eloquence. He preaches what people call awakening sermons; and I  fear they have been too agitating for Isola. She insists on hearing him; she  hangs upon his words; but his preaching has too strong an influence upon her  mind &mdash; or upon her nerves. I have seen the tears streaming down her poor pale cheeks;  I have seen her terribly overcome. She is too weak to bear that kind of strain.  She is depressed all the rest of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ought not to be allowed to hear such sermons.  Take her to another church, where some dozy old bird will send her comfortably  to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have tried to take her to the other church &mdash; you  must not talk of a clergyman as a dozy old bird, sir &mdash; but she looked so  unhappy at the mere idea of missing Father Rodwell&rsquo;s sermons that I dare not  press the matter. He comes to see us occasionally, and he is the cheeriest and  pleasantest of men, nothing of the zealot or ascetic about him; so that I am in  hopes his influence will be for good in the long run. How long shall you be  able to stop at San Remo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till the lady for whose sake I came shall take it  into her head to leave the place. I have been thinking, Allegra,&rdquo; putting his  arm through hers, and pacing up and down the terrace, with the bright expanse  of sea in front of them, and at their back the great curtain of hills  encircling and defending them from the wintry world&mdash; &ldquo;I have been thinking that  Venice would be a charming place for you and me to spend next summer in &mdash; if &mdash;  if &mdash; you meant six months instead of twelve for my probation &mdash; as I really  think you must have done. We could be married on the first of June &mdash; such a  pretty date for a wedding! So easy to remember! You would want to be married in  Trelasco Church, of course; on our native soil. The church in which my  great-grandfather was married, and in which I and all my race were christened!  We could have the yacht at Marseilles ready to carry us off on our travels,  through the delicious summer days and nights, all along this lovely coast, and  away by Naples to the Adriatic. Allegra, why should we wait for the winter, the  dreary winter, to begin our life journey? Let us begin it in the time of  roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, John!&rdquo; cried Allegra, laughing, as she  pointed to the hedge of red roses in front of them, and the clusters of creamy  bloom hanging over the verandah. &ldquo;The roses have been blooming ever since we  came to Italy. It is always rose-time here. You remember our reading in the  dedication of &lsquo;To Leeward&rsquo; how Marion Crawford strewed his wife&rsquo;s pathway with  roses on Christmas Day at Sorrento. We can find a flowery land for our honeymoon  at any season of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why wait a year? Can you not prove me trusty  and true in less than a year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so impatient,&rdquo; she said, plucking a  handful of roses, and scattering the petals at her feet. &ldquo;A year is so short a  time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Short, love! why, eight weeks have seemed an  eternity to me without you; and you honoured me just now by saying that the  time had appeared long, even to you &mdash; even to my liege lady, sitting serene in  her palace of art, painting contadinas and their olive-faced offspring &mdash; even  to you, whose love is as a thread of silk against a cable, compared to mine.  Even to you, my mistress and my tyrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was because you were so far away. But there  will be nothing to hinder our seeing each other, as often as you may find convenient.  I have set my heart upon painting steadily for a twelvemonth, without any  distractions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no such place as Venice for a painter.  Think of the Miss Montalbas, and the splendid work they have done at Venice.  Would you not like to be like them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I not like to be like Apelles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Venice will be your treasury; Venice will  fill that busy brain with ideas. You shall be fed upon pictures old and new &mdash;  the new living pictures in the narrow streets and canals; the old masters in  the churches and palaces. You shall learn of Tintoret and Veronese. You shall  paint as much as you like. You shall have no distractions. We shall be  strangers there, can live as we choose. Summer is the time for Venice, Allegra.  Benighted English people have an idea that Italy is a place to winter in, and  they go and shiver in marble palaces, and watch the torrential rain beating  against windows that were never meant to shut out bad weather. The Italians  know that their land is a land of summer, and they know how to enjoy sunny days  and balmy nights. You don&rsquo;t know how delicious life is on the Lido when the  night is only a brief interval of starshine betwixt sunset and dawn. You don&rsquo;t  know what a dream of delight it is to float along the lagoons and watch the  lamp-lit city melt into the mists of evening, breathing faint echoes of music  and song. A great many things of beauty have been turned to ugliness, Allegra,  since printing and the steam engine were invented; but, thank God! Venice is  not one of them. You will think of my plan, won&rsquo;t you, love? At the least, it  is a thing to be considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you say is worthy to be considered, John.  And now come in and see Isola and Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt that he had gone far enough &mdash; he felt that  it were unwise to press the question too much at first. He meant to be gently  persistent; and he meant to have his own way.</p>
<p>He followed Allegra into the drawing-room &mdash; a room  full of light and sunshine, which had been beautified and made home-like by the  addition of a few Japaneseries and a little old Italian furniture which Martin  Disney had picked up at a bric-&agrave;-brac shop in the Via Vittorio Emanuelo. There  were flowers everywhere, in the bright Italian pottery, so artless, so cheap,  so gay, in its varieties of form and colouring. To Hulbert&rsquo;s fancy it was the  prettiest room he had seen for an age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have made yourself uncommonly  comfortable here,&rdquo; he said, after cordial greetings, settling down into a  bamboo chair near Isola&rsquo;s little olive-wood table, littered with Tauchnitz novels  and fancy work. &ldquo;It is a pleasant sensation for a rolling stone who has hardly  ever known what home means to drop into such a nest as this. You will have too  much of my company, I&rsquo;m afraid. You&rsquo;ll be shocked to hear that I have taken  rooms at the Anglais, down there,&rdquo; pointing down the valley, &ldquo;within a stone&rsquo;s  throw of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not shocked. We are very glad you will be  near us,&rdquo; said Isola, smiling at him. &ldquo;It has been a dull life for Allegra, I&rsquo;m  afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dull! dull in this land of beauty!&rdquo; cried Allegra.  &ldquo;I have never known a dull hour since I came here; though, of course,&rdquo; with a  shy glance at her lover, &ldquo;I have naturally thought sometimes of absent friends,  and wished they were with me to revel in the loveliness of these woods and  hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one of your friends has come to you, one who  would as gladly have come had you been in regions where the sun never shines,  or where his chariot wheels scorch the torrid sands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Hulbert stayed with them all the evening,  and planned a sail to Mentone for the following day, Isola again begging to be  left out of their plans, as she had done at Fowey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need feel no compunction about leaving me,&rdquo;  she paid. &ldquo;I shall be perfectly happy in the woods with nurse, and baby, and my  books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They obeyed her, and the little excursion was  arranged. They were to start soon after the early breakfast, carrying what  their Italian cook called a pique-nique with them, in the shape of a  well-provided luncheon-basket. Isola sat in the olive wood, watching the white  sails moving slowly towards Bordighera. It was an exquisite day &mdash; a day for  dreaming on the water rather than for rapid progress. The yacht scarcely seemed  to move as Isola watched her from the cushioned corner which L&ouml;ttchen had  arranged in an angle of the low stone wall &mdash; all amongst ferns and mosses,  brown orchises and blue violets &mdash; an angle sheltered by a century-old olive,  whose gnarled trunk sprawled along the ground, rugged and riven, but with  another century&rsquo;s life in it yet. Far down in the valley, below the old  gateway, a company of cypresses rose dark against the blue of the sea, and  Isola knew that just on that slope of the shore where the cypresses grew  tallest the graves of English exiles were gathered. Many a fair hope, many a  broken dream, many a disappointed ambition lay at rest under those dark spires,  within the sound of that summer sea.</p>
<p>This was one of many days which the young mother  spent in the woods or in the garden with her baby for her companion, while  Allegra and the colonel sailed east or west in the <em>Vendetta</em>. Her doctor would have liked her to go with them, but she  seemed to have an absolute aversion to the sea, and he did not press the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that she dislikes will do her any good,&rdquo;  he told Colonel Disney. &ldquo;There is no use in being persistent about anything.  Fancies and whims stand for a great deal in such an illness as hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A week or two later the same kind doctor discovered  that his patient was fast losing ground. Her strength had flagged considerably  in a short time. He recommended change of scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This quiet life suited her wonderfully well for  the first month or so, but we are no longer making any headway. You had better  try a gayer place &mdash; a little more life and movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin Disney was ready to obey. He and Allegra  took counsel together, and then &mdash; in the lightest strain, one evening after  dinner &mdash; they discussed the notion of a change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we strike our tents, Isola? Are you tired of  San Remo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Martin. I am tired of myself, sometimes &mdash;  never of these olive woods and lemon groves. Sometimes the stillness and the  silent beauty of the place make me feel unhappy, without knowing why; but that  is a kind of unhappiness no one can escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any place in the world within tolerable  easy reach of this that you would like to see?&rdquo; asked her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is one city in the world that I have  been longing to see ever since I began to have thoughts and wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rome! I should like to see Rome before I die,  Martin; if it were not too troublesome for you &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Troublesome! My dearest, can anything be  troublesome to me if it can but give you pleasure? You shall see Rome &mdash; not  once &mdash; but again and again, in the course of a long and happy life, I hope. I  am more than twenty years older than you; but I count upon at least thirty  years more upon this planet, before I blow out my candle and say &lsquo;<em>Bon soir</em>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant that you may live to a good old age,  Martin. The world is better for such a man as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world would be no place for me without my  wife,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And so you would like to see Rome, Isa? What has put that  fancy into your head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is an old dream, as I said just now. And  lately I have been talking to Father Rodwell, who knows Rome as well as if he  were a Roman citizen, and he has made me more and more anxious to go there. If  it would not be a great plague to you, Martin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, it would be a great pleasure. We  will go to Rome, Isa, if your doctor approve. Allegra will like it, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it?&rdquo; echoed Allegra, &ldquo;I shall simply be  intoxicated with delight. I know the catalogues of all the picture-galleries by  heart. I think I know every one of the seven hills as well as if I had walked  upon them from my childhood. I have read so many descriptions of the place and  its surroundings &mdash; so many raptures penned by people whom I have envied for  nothing else than that they have known Rome; they have lived in Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole business was easily settled. Captain  Hulbert was the only person who regretted the change. He had been a month at  San Remo, a month of summer idleness in February and March, a month of summer  sails on an azure sea; of mountain walks and rides, high up from stage to  stage, until the region of lemon groves and olive woods gave place to the pines  on the loftier hills. He had been able to spend all his days in Allegra&rsquo;s  society.</p>
<p>There were no pictures, except in that one little  gallery at Colla. There was nothing to distract her from her lover. In Rome  there would be all the wonders of the most wonderful city in the world. It  would be art first and love second.</p>
<p>The doctor approved; Father Rodwell wrote to an  agent in Rome, and after some negotiation a suite of apartments was found on  the high ground near the Trinit&agrave; de&rsquo; Monti, which seemed to meet all the  requirements of the case. The priest vouched for the honesty and good faith of  the agent, and on his responsibility the rooms were taken for the month of  April, with liberty to occupy them later if it were so desired.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
  &ldquo;The Woods Are Round Us, Heaped And Dim&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It was their last day at San Remo. Everything had  been packed for the journey, and the drawing-room at Lauter Brunnen had a  dreary look now that it was stripped of all those decorations and useful  prettinesses with which Allegra had made it so gay and home-like.</p>
<p>The morning was brilliant, and Martin, Allegra, and  Captain Hulbert set off at nine o&rsquo;clock upon a long-deferred expedition to San  Romolo. They would be home in good time for the eight-o&rsquo;clock dinner; and Isola  promised to amuse herself all day, and to be in good spirits to welcome them on  their return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a duty to do for your sister,&rdquo; she said,  when her husband felt compunction at leaving her. &ldquo;Think of all she has done  for us, her devotion, her unselfishness. The least we can do is to help her to  be happy with her lover; and all the burden of that duty has fallen upon you. I  think you ought to be called Colonel Gooseberry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked a bright and happy creature as she stood  on the mule-path in the olive wood, waving her hand to them as they went away &mdash;  Allegra riding a donkey, the two men walking, one on each side of her bridle,  and the guide striding on ahead, leading a second donkey which was to serve as  an occasional help by-and-by, if either of the pedestrians wanted a lift. Her  cheeks were flushed with walking, and her eyes were bright with a new gladness.</p>
<p>She was full of a childish pleasure in the idea of  their journey, and the realization of a dream which most of us have dreamt a  long time before it assumed the shape of earthly things &mdash; the dream of Rome.</p>
<p>Isola stood listening to their footsteps, as they  passed the little painted shrine on the hill path. She heard them give the time  of day to a party of peasant women, with empty baskets on their heads, going up  to gather the last of the olives. Then she roamed about the wooded valley and  the slope of the hill towards Colla for an hour or two, and then, growing  suddenly tired, she crept home, in time to sit beside her baby while he slept  his placid noontide sleep. She bent over the little rosebud mouth and kissed  it, in a rapture of maternal love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So young to see Rome,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;And to think  that those star-like eyes will see and take no heed; to think that such a  glorious vision will pass before him, and he will remember nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day was very long, something like one of those  endless days at Trelasco, when her husband was in Burmah and she had only the  dog and the cat for her companions. She thought of those fond friends to-day  with a regretful sigh &mdash; the sleepy Shah, so calm and undemonstrative in his  attachment, but with a placid, purring delight in her society which seemed to  mean a great deal; the fox-terrier, so active and intense in his affection,  demanding so much attention, intruding himself upon her walks and reveries with  such eager, not-to-be-denied devotion. She had no four-footed friends here; and  the want of them made an empty space in her life.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the weather changed suddenly. The  sky became overcast, the sea a leaden colour; and the mistral came whistling up  the valley with a great rustling and shivering of the silver-green foliage and  creaking of the old bent branches, like the withered arms of witch or  sorceress. All the glory of the day was gone, and the white villas on the crest  of the eastward hill stood out in livid distinctness against the blackened sky.</p>
<p>Isola wandered up the hill-path, past the little  shrine where the way divided, the point at which she had seen her husband and  his party vanish in the sunny morning. She felt a sudden sense of loneliness  now the sun was gone; a childish longing for the return of her friends, for  evening and lamplight, and the things that make for cheerfulness. She was cold  and dull, and out of spirits. She had left the house while the sun was shining,  and she had come without shawl or wrap of any kind, and the mistral made her  shiver. Yet she had no idea of hurrying home. The loneliness of the house had  become oppressive before she left it; and she knew there would be some hours to  wait for the return of the excursionists. So she mounted the steep mule-path,  slowly and painfully, till she had gone two-thirds of the way to Colla; and  then she sat down to rest on the low stone wall which enclosed a little garden  in a break of the wood, from which point there was a far-stretching view  seaward.</p>
<p>She was very cold, but she was so tired as to be  glad to rest at any hazard of after-suffering. Drowsy from sheer exhaustion,  she leant her head against a great rugged olive, whose roots were mixed up with  the wall, and fell fast asleep. She awoke, shivering, from a confused dream of  sea and woods, Roman temples and ruined palaces. She had been wandering in one  of those dream-cities that have neither limit nor settled locality. It was here  in the woods below Colla, and yet was half Rome and half Trelasco. There was a  classic temple upon a hill that was like the Mount, and the day was bleak, and  dark, and rainy, and she was walking on the footpath through Lord Lostwithiel&rsquo;s  park, with the storm-driven rain beating against her face, just as on that  autumn evening, when the owner of the soil had taken compassion upon her and  had given her shelter. The dream had been curiously vivid &mdash; a dream which  brought the past back as if it were the present, and blotted out all that had  come afterwards. She woke bewildered, forgetting that her husband had come back  from India, and that she was in Italy, thinking of herself as she had been that  October evening when she and Lostwithiel met for the first time.</p>
<p>The sea was darker than when she fell asleep. There  was the dull crimson of a stormy sunset yonder, behind the jutting promontory  of Bordighera, while the sky above was barred with long, black clouds, and the  wind was howling across the great deep valley like an evil spirit tortured and  imprisoned, shrieking to his gods for release. Exactly opposite her, as she  stood in the deep cleft of the hills, a solitary vessel was labouring under  press of canvas towards the point upon whose dusky summit the chapel of the  Madonna della Guardia gleamed whitely in the dying day. The vessel was a  schooner yacht, of considerable tonnage, certainly larger than the <em>Vendetta</em>.</p>
<p>Isola stood, still as marble, watching that  labouring boat, the straining sails, the dark hull beaten by the stormy dash of  the waves. She watched with wide, open eyes, and parted lips, quivering as with  an over-mastering fear, watched in momentary expectation of seeing those  straining sails dip for the last time, that labouring hull founder and vanish  betwixt black wave and white surf. She watched in motionless attention till the  boat disappeared behind the shoulder of the hill; and then, shivering, nervous,  and altogether over-strung, she hurried homewards, feeling that she had stayed  out much too long, and that she had caught a chill which might be the cause of  new trouble.</p>
<p>If those narrow mule-paths had been less familiar,  she might have lost her way in the dusk; but she had trodden them too often to  be in any difficulty, and she reached the villa without loss of time, but not before  the return of the picnic party.</p>
<p>Allegra and Captain Hulbert were watching at the  gate. Colonel Disney had gone into the wood to look for her, and had naturally  taken the wrong direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Isola; how could you stop out so late, and on  such a stormy evening?&rdquo; remonstrated Allegra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fell asleep before the storm came on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fell asleep &mdash; out-of-doors &mdash; and at sunset! What  dreadful imprudence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went out too late, I&rsquo;m afraid; but I was so  tired of waiting for you. A kind of horror of the house and the silence came  upon me &mdash; and I felt I must go out into the woods. I walked too far &mdash; and fell  asleep from sheer fatigue; and when I woke I saw a yacht fighting with the  wind. I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll go down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you noticed her too?&rdquo; exclaimed Hulbert. &ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t think you cared enough about yachts to take notice of her. I was  watching her as we came down the hill; rather too much canvas; but she&rsquo;s right  enough. She&rsquo;s past Arma di Taggia by this time, I dare say. I&rsquo;ll go and look  for Disney, and tell him you&rsquo;re safe and sound. Perhaps I shall miss him in the  wood. It&rsquo;s like a Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream, isn&rsquo;t it, Allegra?&rdquo; he said,  laughing, as he went out of the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were only mid-summer, I shouldn&rsquo;t care,&rdquo;  answered his sweetheart, with her arm round Isola, who stood beside her, pale  and shivering. &ldquo;Come in, dear, and let me make you warm, if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they should all go down in the darkness!&rdquo; said  Isola, in a low, dreamy voice. &ldquo;The boat looked as if it might be wrecked at  any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allegra employed all her arts as a sick-nurse in  the endeavour to ward off any evil consequence from that imprudent slumber in  the chill hour of sunset; but her cares were unavailing. Isola was restless and  feverish all night, yet she insisted on getting up at her usual hour next  morning, and declared herself quite capable of the journey to Genoa. Allegra  and her brother, however, insisted on her resting for a day or two. So the  departure was postponed, and the doctor sent for. He advised at least three  days&rsquo; rest, with careful nursing; and he reproved his patient severely for her  imprudence in exposing herself to the evening air.</p>
<p>Captain Hulbert appeared at teatime, just returned  from a railway journey to Allassio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a surprise for you, Mrs. Disney,&rdquo; he said,  seating himself by the sofa where Isola was lying, surrounded by invalid  luxuries, books, lemonade, fan, and eau de Cologne flask, her feet covered with  a silken rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A surprise!&rdquo; she echoed faintly, as if life held  no surprises for her. &ldquo;What can that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember the yacht you saw last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she cried, roused in an instant, and  clasping her hands excitedly. &ldquo;Did she go down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least little bit. She is safe and sound at  Allassio. She is called the <em>Eurydice</em>,  she hails last from Syracuse, and my brother is on board her. He wired to me  this morning to go over and see him. I&rsquo;m very glad I went, for he is off to  Corfu to-morrow. The <em>Flying Dutchman</em> isn&rsquo;t in it with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a curious silence. Martin Disney was  sitting on the other side of his wife&rsquo;s sofa, where he had been reading  selected bits of the <em>Times</em>, such  portions of the news of men and nations as he fancied might interest her.  Allegra was busy with a piece of delicate needlework, and did not immediately  reply; but it was she who was first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How frightened you would have been yesterday  evening had you known who was on board the boat,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about being frightened, but he was  certainly carrying too much canvas. I told him so this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laughed at me. &lsquo;You sailors never believe that a  landsman can sail a ship,&rsquo; he said. I wanted to talk to his sailing-master, but  he told me he was his own sailing-master. If his ship was doomed to go down, he  meant to be at the helm himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds as if he were foolhardy,&rdquo; said  Allegra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him I did not like the rig of his boat, nor  the name of his boat, and I reminded him how I saw the <em>Eurydice</em> off Portland with all her canvas spread the day she went  down. I was with the Governor of the Prison, a naval man, who had been  commander on my first ship, and we stood side by side on the cliff, and watched  her as she went by. &lsquo;If this wind gets much stronger, that ship will go down,&rsquo;  said my old captain, &lsquo;unless they take in some of their canvas.&rsquo; And a few  hours later these poor fellows had all gone to the bottom. I asked Lostwithiel  why he called his boat the <em>Eurydice</em>.  &lsquo;Fancy,&rsquo; he said; he had a fancy for the name. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never forgotten the old  lines we used to hammer out when we were boys,&rsquo; he said&mdash; &lsquo;Ah, miseram,  Eurydicen! anima fugiente vocabat; Eurydicen toto referebant flumine rip&aelig;.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the name matters, if she is a good  boat,&rdquo; said Allegra, with her calm common sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she is, and she isn&rsquo;t. She is a finer boat  than the <em>Vendetta</em>; but I&rsquo;d sooner  handle the <em>Vendetta</em> in a storm. There  are points about his new boat that I don&rsquo;t quite like. However, he had her  built by one of the finest builders on the Clyde, and it will be hard if she  goes wrong. He has given me the <em>Vendetta</em> as a wedding-present &mdash; in advance of the event &mdash; on condition that I sink her  when I&rsquo;m tired of her; and he said he hoped she&rsquo;d be luckier to me than she had  been to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin Disney sat silent by his wife&rsquo;s sofa. He  could never hear Lord Lostwithiel&rsquo;s name without a touch of pain. His only  objection to Hulbert as a brother-in-law was the thought that the two men were  of the same race &mdash; that he must needs hear the hated name from time to time;  and yet he believed his wife&rsquo;s avowal that she was pure and true. His hatred of  the name came only from the recollection that she had been slandered by a man  whom he despised. He looked at the wasted profile on the satin pillow, so wan,  so transparent in its waxen pallor, the heavy eyelid drooping languidly, the  faintly coloured lips drawn as if with pain &mdash; a broken lily. Was this the kind  of woman to be suspected of evil &mdash; this fair and fragile creature, in whom the  spiritual so predominated over the sensual? He hated himself for having been  for a moment influenced by that underbred scoundrel at Glenaveril, for having  been base enough to doubt his wife&rsquo;s purity.</p>
<p>He had pained and humiliated her, and now the stamp  of death was on the face he adored, and before him lay the prospect of a life&rsquo;s  remorse.</p>
<p>They left San Remo three days afterwards, Isola  being pronounced able to bear the journey, though her cough had been  considerably increased by that imprudent slumber in the wood. She was anxious  to go; and doctor and husband gave way to her eagerness for new scenes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so tired of this place,&rdquo; she said piteously.  &ldquo;It is lovely; but it is a loveliness that makes me melancholy. I want to be in  a great city where there are lots of people moving about. I have never lived in  a city, but always in quiet places &mdash; beautiful, very beautiful, but so still &mdash;  so still &mdash; so full of one&rsquo;s self and one&rsquo;s own thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
  ECCO ROMA</h2>
<p>The agent had proved himself worthy of trust, and  had chosen the lodging for Colonel Disney&rsquo;s family with taste and discretion.  It was a first floor over a jeweller&rsquo;s shop in a short street behind the Piazza  di Spagna, and under the Pincian Gardens. There were not too many stairs for  Isola to ascend when she came in from her drive or walk. The gardens were close  at hand, and all around there were trees and flowers, and an atmosphere of  verdure and retirement in the midst of the great cosmopolitan city.</p>
<p>It was dark when the train came into the terminus;  and Isola was weary and exhausted after the long hot journey from Pisa, the  glare of the sun, and the suffocating clouds of dust, and the beautiful  monotony of blue sea and sandy plains, long level wastes, where nothing grew  but brushwood and osier, and stretches of marshy ground, with water pools  shining here and there, like burnished steel, and distant islets dimly seen  athwart a cloud of heat. Then evening closed in, and it was through a grey and  formless world that they approached the city whose very name thrilled her.</p>
<p>The railway station was very much like any other  great terminus; like Milan, like Genoa. There was the same close rank of  omnibuses. There were the same blue blouses and civil, eager porters, far too  few for the work to be done, rapacious but amiable, piling up the innumerable  packages of the Italian traveller, loading themselves like so many human beasts  of burden, and with no apparent limit to their capacity for carrying things.  Two flys were packed with the miscellaneous luggage, nurse and baby, and then  Isola was handed to her place in another, with Allegra by her side, and through  the narrow streets of tall houses, under the dim strip of soft April night, she  drove through the city of heroes and martyrs, saints and apostles, wicked  emperors and holy women, the city of historical contrasts, of darkness and  light, refinement and barbarism, of all things most unlike each other, from  Nero to Paul, from Gregory the Great to the Borgias.</p>
<p>The glory and the beauty of Rome only began to dawn  upon her next morning, in the vivid sunlight, when she climbed the steps of the  Trinit&agrave; de&rsquo; Monti, and then with Allegra&rsquo;s arm to lean upon went slowly upward  and again upward to the topmost terrace on the Pincian Hill, and stood leaning  on the marble balustrade, and gazing across the city that lay steeped in  sunshine at her feet &mdash; over palace and steeple, pinnacle and tower, to the  rugged grandeur of Hadrian&rsquo;s Tomb, and to that great dome whose vastness makes  all other temples seem puny and insignificant. This was her first view of the  world&rsquo;s greatest church.</p>
<p>The air was clear and cool upon this height,  although the city below showed dimly through a hazy veil of almost tropical  heat. Everywhere there was the odour of summer flowers, the overpowering  sweetness of lilies of the valley, and great branches of lilac, white and  purple, brimming over in the baskets of the flower-sellers.</p>
<p>On such a morning as this one could understand how  the Romans came to call April the joyous month, and to dedicate this season of  sunshine and flowers to the Goddess of Beauty and Love.</p>
<p>Isola&rsquo;s face lighted up with a new gladness, a look  of perfect absorption and self-forgetfulness, as she leant upon the balustrade,  and gazed across that vast panorama, gazed and wondered, with eyes that seemed  to grow larger in their delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is this really Rome?&rdquo; she murmured softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is Rome,&rdquo; cried Allegra. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it  lovely? Isn&rsquo;t it all you ever dreamt of or hoped for? And yet people have so  maligned it &mdash; called it feverish, stuffy, disappointing, dirty! Why, the air is  ether &mdash; inspiring, health-giving! April in Rome is as fresh as April in an  English forest; only it is April with the warmth and flowers of June. I feel  sure you will grow ever so much stronger after one little week in Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know I shall be better here. I feel better  already,&rdquo; said Isola, with a kind of feverish hopefulness. &ldquo;It was so good of  Martin to bring me. San Remo is always lovely &mdash; and I shall love it to the end  of my life, because it was my first home in Italy &mdash; but I was beginning to be  tired &mdash; not of the olive woods and the sea, but of the people we met, and the  sameness of life. One day was so like another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was monotonous, of course,&rdquo; agreed Allegra;  &ldquo;and being a little out of health, you would be bored by monotony sooner than  Martin or I. It was such a pity you did not like the yacht. That made such a  change for us. The very olive woods and the mountain villages seem new when one  sees them from the water. I was never tired of looking at the hills between San  Remo and Bordighera, or the promontory of Monaco, with its cathedral towers. It  was a pleasure lost to you, dear; but it could not be helped, I suppose. Yet  once upon a time you used to be so fond of the sea, when you and I went in our  row-boat, tempting danger round by Neptune Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have been stronger then,&rdquo; Isola faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, forgive me, darling! What an inconsiderate  wretch I am! But Rome will give you back your lost strength; and we shall round  Neptune Point again, and feel the salt spray dashing over our heads as we go  out into the great fierce Atlantic. I confess that sometimes, when that divine  Mediterranean which we are never tired of worshipping has been lying in the  sunshine like one vast floor of <em>lapis  lazuli</em>, I have longed for something rougher and wilder &mdash; for such a sea as  you and I have watched from the Rashleigh Mausoleum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Disney and his wife and sister went about  in a very leisurely way in their explorations. In the first place, he was  anxious to avoid anything approaching fatigue for his wife; and in the second  place it was only the beginning of April, and they were to be in Rome for at  least a month; there was therefore no need for rushing hither and thither at  the tourist pace, with guide-books in their hands, and anxious, heated  countenances, perspiring through the streets, and suffering deadly chills in  the churches. Allegra&rsquo;s first desire was naturally to see the  picture-galleries, and to these she went for the most part alone, leaving Isola  and her husband free to wander about as they pleased, upon a friendly equality  of ignorance, knowing very little more than Childe Harold and Murray could  teach them. Isola&rsquo;s Rome was Byron&rsquo;s Rome.</p>
<p>There was one spot she loved better than any other  in the city of mighty memories. It was not hallowed by the blood of saint or  hero, sage or martyr. It had no classical associations. He whose heart lay  buried there under the shadow of the tribune&rsquo;s mighty monument, perished in the  pride of manhood, in the freshness and glory of life; and that heart &mdash; so warm  and generous to his fellow-men &mdash; had hardened itself against the God of saint  and martyr, the God of Peter and Paul, Lawrence and Gregory, Benedict and  Augustine. Yet for Isola there was no grave in Rome so fraught with spiritual  thoughts as Shelley&rsquo;s grave, no sweeter memory associated with the eternal city  than the memory of his wanderings and meditations amidst the ruined walls of  the Baths of Caracalla, where his young genius drank in the poetry of the long  past, and fed upon the story of the antique dead.</p>
<p>She came to Shelley&rsquo;s grave as often as she could  steal away from the anxious companions of her drives and walks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to be alone now and then,&rdquo; she told her  husband. &ldquo;It rests me to sit by myself for an hour or two in this lovely  place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a coachman in the Piazza who was in the  habit of driving Colonel Disney&rsquo;s family &mdash; an elderly man, sober, steady and  attentive, with intelligence that made him almost as good as a guide. He was on  the watch for his English clients every morning. They had but to appear on the  Piazza, and he was in attendance, ready to take them to the utmost limit of a  day&rsquo;s journey, if they liked. Were they in doubt where to go, he was always  prompt with suggestions.</p>
<p>He would drive Isola to the door of the English  cemetery, leave her there, and return at her bidding to take her home again.  Disney knew she was safe when this veteran had her in charge. The man was well  known in the Piazza, and of established character for honesty. She took a book  or two in her light basket, buying a handful of flowers here and there from the  women and children as she went along, till the books were hidden under roses  and lilac. The custodian of the cemetery knew her, and admitted her without a  word. He had watched her furtively once or twice, to see that she neither  gathered the flowers nor tried to scratch her name upon the tombs. He had seen  her sitting quietly by the slab which records Shelley&rsquo;s death &mdash; and the death  of that faithful friend who was laid beside him, sixty years afterwards. Sixty  years of loving, regretful memory, and then union in the dust. Shall there not  be a later and a better meeting, when those two shall see each other&rsquo;s faces  and hear each other&rsquo;s voices again, in a world where old things shall be made  new, where youth and its wild freshness shall come back again, and Trelawney  shall be as young in thought and feeling as Shelley?</p>
<p>The English burial-place was a garden of fairest  flowers at this season &mdash; a paradise of roses and clematis, azaleas and camelias  &mdash; and much more beautiful for its wilder growth of trailing foliage and  untended shrubs, the pale cold blue of the periwinkle that carpeted slope and  bank, and for the background of old grey wall, severe in its antique  magnificence, a cyclopean rampart, relic of time immemorial, clothed and  beautified with weed and floweret that grew in every cleft and cranny.</p>
<p>Here, in a sheltered angle to the left of the  poet&rsquo;s grave, Isola could sit unobserved, even when the custodian brought a  party of tourists to see the hallowed spot, which occurred now and then while  she sat there. The tourists for the most part stared foolishly, made some  sentimental remark if they were women, or if they were men, betrayed a hopeless  ignorance of the poet&rsquo;s history, and not unfrequently confounded him with  Keats. Isola sat half-hidden in her leafy corner, where the ivy and the  acanthus hung from the great grey buttress against which she leant, languid,  half-dreaming, with two books on her lap.</p>
<p>One was her Shelley &mdash; her much-read Shelley &mdash; a  shabby, cloth-bound volume, bought in her girlhood at the book-seller&rsquo;s in the  Place Duguesclin, where English books could be got by special order, and at  special prices. The other was an Italian Testament, which her husband had  bought her at San Remo, and in which she had read with extreme diligence and  with increasing fervour as her mind became more deeply moved by Father  Rodwell&rsquo;s sermons. It was not that she had ever been one of those advanced  thinkers who will accept no creed which does not square with their own little  theories and fit in to their own narrow circle of possibilities. She had never  doubted the creed she had been taught in her childhood, but she had thought  very little about serious things, since she was a young girl, preparing for her  confirmation, touched with girlish enthusiasm, and very much in earnest. In  these fair spring days, and in this city of many memories, all young thoughts  had reawakened in her mind. She pored over the familiar Gospel-stories, and  again, as in the first freshness of her girlhood, she saw the sacred figure of  the Redeemer and Teacher in all the vivid light and colour of a reality, close  at hand. Faith stretched a hand across the abyss of time, and brought the old  world of the Gospel-story close to her; the closer, because she was in Rome,  not far from that church which enshrines the print of the Divine footstep, when  He who was God and Man, appeared to His disciple, to foreshadow approaching  martyrdom, to inspire the fortitude of the martyr. Yes, although the Saviour&rsquo;s  earthly feet never entered the city, every hill and every valley within and without  those crumbling walls has interwoven itself so closely with the story of His  life &mdash; through the work of His saints and martyrs &mdash; that it is nowise strange  if the scenes and images of the sacred story seem nearer and more vivid in Rome  than in any other place on earth, not excepting Jerusalem. It was from Rome,  not from Jerusalem, that the Cross went out to the uttermost ends of the world.  It is the earth of the Colosseum and the Borgo that is steeped in the blood of  those who have died for Christ. It was Rome that ruled the world, through the  long night of barbarism and feudal power, by the invincible force of His name.</p>
<p>It might seem strange that Isola should turn from  the story of the Evangelists to the works of a poet whose human sympathies were  so wrung by the evil that has been wrought in the name of the Cross that he was  blind to the infinitely greater good which Christianity has accomplished for  mankind. Shelley saw the blood of the martyrs, not as a sublime testimony to  the Godlike power of faith, not as a sacrifice rich in after-fruits, sad seed  of a joyous harvest &mdash; but as the brutal outcome of man&rsquo;s cruelty, using any  name, Christ, or Buddha, Mahomet, or Brahma &mdash; as the badge of tyranny, the  sanction to torture and to slay.</p>
<p>Shelley&rsquo;s melancholy fate seemed brought nearer to  her now that she sat beside his grave, in the summer stillness, and in the  shadow of the old Aurelian Wall. It was only his heart that was lying there,  the imperishable heart, snatched by Trelawney&rsquo;s hand from the flame of the  Greek pyre, from the smoke of pine-logs and frankincense, wine and oil. Sixty  years had passed before that hand lay cold in the grave beside the buried heart  of the poet, sixty years of severance, and fond faithful memory, before death  brought re-union.</p>
<p>What a beautiful spirit this, which was so early  quenched by the cruelest stroke of Fate &mdash; a light such as seldom shone out of  mortal clay, a spirit of fire and brightness, intangible, untamable, not to be  shut within common limits, nor judged by common laws!</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  &ldquo;Seek Shelter In The Shadow Of The Tomb&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Of the people who came to look upon the grave, some  to lay a tributary flower upon the stone, and some to pluck a leaf or two of  acanthus or violet, all hitherto had been strangers to Isola, had gone away  without seeing her, or had glanced indifferently, as at one more unfortunate  with a sketching-block, spoiling paper in the pursuit of the unattainable.  There were so many amateur artists sitting about in the outskirts of the city,  that such a figure in a romantic spot challenged nobody&rsquo;s attention. So far  people had come and gone, and had taken no notice; but one afternoon a figure  in a long black cassock came suddenly between her and the golden light, and  Isola looked up with a cry of surprise on recognizing Father Rodwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not expect to see me here,&rdquo; he said,  holding out his hand.</p>
<p>She had risen from her seat on the low grassy bank,  and she gave him her hand, half in pleasure, half in a nervous apprehension  which his keen eye was quick to perceive. His life had been spent in dealings  with the souls of men and women, and he had learnt to read those living pages  as easily as he read Plato or Spinosa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had no idea you were in Rome.  You told us you were going back to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to go back to London and hard work, but my  doctor insisted upon my prolonging my holiday for a few weeks, so I came here  instead. Rome always draws me, and is always new. Rome gives me fresh life and  fresh power when my heart and brain have been feeling benumbed and dead. I am  glad they brought you here, Mrs. Disney. You were looking languid and ill when  you left San Remo. I hope Rome has revivified you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her earnestly. Her face had been in  shadow until now, but as she moved into the sunlight, he saw that the lines had  sharpened in the pale, wan face, and that there was the stamp of wasting  disease in the hollow cheeks, and about the sunken eyes, and in the almost  bloodless lips. As he looked at her in friendliest commiseration those pathetic  grey eyes &mdash; whose expression had baffled his power of interpretation hitherto &mdash;  filled suddenly with tears, and in the next moment she clasped her hands before  her face in an agony of grief.</p>
<p>The Italian Testament which she had been reading  when he approached dropped at her feet, and stooping to pick it up Father  Rodwell saw that it was open at the fourth chapter of St. John, the story of  the woman of Samaria, the sinner with whom Christ talked at the well. A leaf  from Shelley&rsquo;s grave lay upon the book, as if to mark where Isola had been  reading, and Father Rodwell&rsquo;s quick glance saw that the page was blotted with  tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Disney,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;is there  anything wrong at home? Your husband, your boy are well, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank God, they are both well. God has been  very good to me. He might have taken those I love. He has been merciful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is merciful to all His creatures; though there  are times when His dealings with us seem very hard. Oh, Mrs. Disney, you can&rsquo;t  think how difficult a priest&rsquo;s office is sometimes when he has to reconcile the  afflicted with the Providence that has seen fit to lay some heavy burden on  them. They cannot understand; they cannot say it is well. They cannot kiss the  rod. But as you say, God has been good to you. Your lines have been set in  pleasant places. You are hedged round and sheltered by love. I never saw  greater affection in husband for wife than I have seen in your husband. I never  saw sister more devoted to sister than your sister-in-law is to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had sunk again into a sitting position on the  low bank at the foot of the wall. Her face was still hidden, and her sobs came  faster as he spoke to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you grieve at the thought of their  love? Is it because it may please God to take you from them in the morning of  your life? If it is that dread which agitates you I entreat you to put it  aside. There is nothing in your case that forbids hope, and hope will do much  to help your recovery. You should tell yourself how valuable your life is to those  who love you. The thought of their affection should give you courage to  struggle against apathy and languor. Believe me, invalids have their condition  a great deal more in their own power than they are inclined to believe. So much  can be overcome where the spirit is strong and brave, where faith and hope  fight against bodily weakness. You ought not to be sitting alone here in this  saddening spot. It is lovely, but with the beauty of death. You ought to be  driving out to Frascati or to Tivoli with your husband. You ought to be  watching the carriages in the Pincian Gardens, or amusing yourself in one of  the picture galleries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had rather be alone,&rdquo; she said, wiping away her  tears, and in some degree recovering her self-possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a morbid fancy, and one that hinders your  recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to recover. I only want to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Disney, it is your duty to fight  against these melancholy moods. Can you be indifferent to your husband&rsquo;s  feelings? Have you not the mother&rsquo;s natural desire to watch over your child&rsquo;s  early years, to see him reach manhood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; she cried passionately. &ldquo;I have had  enough of life. They are dear to me, very dear. No wife ever loved and honoured  her husband more than I love and honour mine &mdash; but it is all over, it is past,  and ended. I am more than resigned to death &mdash; I am thankful that God has called  me away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He watched her closely as she spoke, watched her  with his hand upon hers, which was cold as ice. He had heard such words before  from the early doomed, but they had been accompanied by religious exaltation;  they had been the outpouring of a faith that saw the gates of heaven opened and  the Son of man sitting in glory &mdash; of a love that longed to be with God. Here  there was no sign of hope or exaltation. There were only the tokens of despair.</p>
<p>He remembered how agitated he had seen her many  times in the little church at San Remo, and how, although hanging eagerly upon  his preaching, she had persistently avoided anything like serious conversation  with him upon the few occasions when he had found himself alone with her.</p>
<p>He had her Testament still in his hand, and looking  down at the tear-stained page it seemed to him that there lay the clue to her  melancholy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been reading the story of the woman of  Samaria,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have read that other story of her who  knelt in the dust at her Saviour&rsquo;s feet, and to whom He said, &lsquo;Neither do I  condemn thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything in either of those stories to  sadden you more than the thought of sin and sorrow saddens all of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him shrinkingly, pale as death, as if  he had a dagger in his hand ready to strike her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose there is anything that goes  home to my heart any more than to other hearts,&rdquo; she said, after a pause,  trying to speak carelessly. &ldquo;We are all sinners. The Gospel teaches us that in  every line! We are none of us altogether worthy &mdash; not even my husband, I  suppose, although to me he seems a perfect Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can believe that he is a Christian, Mrs. Disney,  and a man of strong convictions. If he had wronged anybody, I do not think he  would rest till he had atoned for that wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure he would not. He would do his uttermost  to atone. And so would I &mdash; although I do not pretend to be half so good a  Christian as he is. I would do all in my power to atone for any wrong I had  done to one I loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you love your husband, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as I love him. He is first in the world for  me. Dear as my child is, Martin must always be first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would not for the world do him any wrong?&rdquo;  pursued the priest, more and more earnest as he went on, pale with emotion, his  whole power of observation concentrated upon the whitening face and lowered  eyelids of the woman sitting at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the world, not for my life,&rdquo; she said,  with her hands tightly clasped, her eyes still hidden under the heavy lids,  tearless now &mdash; and with dry and quivering lips, from which the words came with  a dull and soulless sound. &ldquo;I would die to save him an hour&rsquo;s pain. I would  fling away this wretched life rather than grieve him for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor soul!&rdquo; murmured the priest, pitying that debt  of self-abasement which he understood so well, under whatsoever guise she might  hide her contrition. &ldquo;Poor soul, you talk too lightly of that great mystery  which we should all face in a spirit of deep humility. Do you feel that you can  contemplate that passage through death to a new life without fear of the issue?  Have you no reckoning to make with the God who pardons repentant sinners? Do  you stand before Him with a clear conscience &mdash; having kept nothing back &mdash;  cherished no hidden sin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can be without sin in His sight. Do you  suppose that I am sinless, or that I have ever believed myself sinless? I know  how weak and poor a thing I am &mdash; a worm in the sight of Him who rules the  universe. But if &mdash; if He cares for such as I, He knows that I am sorry for  every sinful thought and every sinful act of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in short sentences, each phrase broken by  a sob. She felt as if he were tearing out her heart, this man who had been  heretofore so kindly and indulgent in his speech and manner that he seemed to  make religion an easy thing, a garment as loose and expansive as philosophy  itself. And, now, all at once he appeared before her as a judge, searching out  her heart, cruel, inflexible, weighing her in the balance, and finding her  wanting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am sorry,&rdquo; she murmured, between her sobs,  &ldquo;what more can God or man require of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, if your sorrow is that true sorrow which  means repentance, and goes hand-in-hand with atonement. Forgive me, my dear  friend, for presuming to speak unreservedly to you. If I try to find out the  nature of your wound it is only that I may help you to heal it. Ever since I  have known you I have seen the tokens of a wounded heart, a bruised and broken  spirit. I saw you surrounded with all the blessings that make woman&rsquo;s lot  happy. It was hardly possible to conceive fairer surroundings and truer  friends. Can you wonder, then, if my compassionate interest was awakened by the  indications of a deep-rooted sorrow for which there was no apparent cause? I  saw your emotion in church, saw how quickly your heart and mind responded to  the appeal of religion &mdash; saw in you a soul attuned to heavenly things, and day  by day my interest in you and yours grew stronger. The hope of seeing you  again, of helping you to bear your burden, of ultimately lightening it, was one  of my reasons for coming to Rome. I felt somehow that you and I had not met in  vain &mdash; that my power to move you was not without a meaning in both our lives;  that if, as I thought, you needed spiritual help and comfort, it was my  vocation to help and comfort you. And so I came to Rome, and so I found out  where you spent your quiet hours, and so I have followed you here this  afternoon. Tell me, Mrs. Disney, did I presume too much? Was it the preacher&rsquo;s  vanity or the priest&rsquo;s intuition that spoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was intuition,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You saw that I had  sinned. None but a sinner could shed such tears &mdash; could so feel the terror of  God&rsquo;s wrath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of His love I want you to think. Of His  immeasurable love and pity. Of His Son&rsquo;s Divine compassion. If you have any  special need of His pardon; if there is any sinful secret locked in your heart;  do not let the golden hours go by &mdash; the time meet for repentance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have repented,&rdquo; she cried piteously. &ldquo;My life  has been one long repentance ever since my sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your husband &mdash; he who so fondly loves you &mdash; he  knows all, and has forgiven all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knows!&rdquo; The word broke from her lips almost in a  shriek of horror. &ldquo;He knows nothing &mdash; he must never know. He would despise me,  leave me to die alone, while he went far away from me, to the very end of the  world. He would take his son with him. I should be left alone &mdash; alone to face  death &mdash; the most desolate creature God ever looked upon. Oh, Father Rodwell,  why have you wrung my secret from me?&rdquo; she cried, grovelling on her knees in  the long grass beside him, clinging to his hand as he bent over her, gravely  compassionate, deeply moved by her distress. &ldquo;How cruel to question &mdash; to  torture me &mdash; how cruel to use your power of reading guilty hearts. You will  tell my husband, who so loves and trusts me. You will tell him what a guilty  wretch I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him, Mrs. Disney! Can you forget that I am a  priest &mdash; for whom the sinner&rsquo;s confession is sacred? Do you think I have never  talked with the tempted and the sorrowing before to-day? Do you think that  grief such as yours can be an unknown experience to a man who has worked in a  crowded London parish for nearly twenty years? I wanted to know the worst, so  that I might be able to advise and to console you. If I have questioned you  to-day, it has been as a priest has the right to question; and this place where  you and I have met to-day is in my sight as sacred as the confessional. You  need have no fear that I shall tell your husband the secret of your sorrow. All  I will do is to help you to find strength to tell him yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no, no!&rdquo; she cried piteously. &ldquo;Never!  never! I can die, I am prepared to die; but I can never tell him &mdash; I cannot, I  dare not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you could dare to die with a lie upon your  lips &mdash; you who are ready to meet your Judge &mdash; you whose whole life is a lie &mdash;  you who have cheated and betrayed the best of men. Oh, Mrs. Disney, reflect  what this thing is which you are doing; reflect what kind of sin it is you are  committing. If, as your own sorrowing words acknowledge, you have been a false  wife &mdash; a false wife to the best and truest of husbands, can you dare to act out  that falsehood to the last, to die with that guilty secret locked in your  heart, from him who has a right to know, &mdash; and who alone upon earth has a right  to pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how cruel you are!&rdquo; she said, lifting up her  streaming eyes to his earnest, inflexible face. &ldquo;Is it a Christian&rsquo;s part to be  so cruel, to break the bruised reed, to crush anything so weak and wretched as  I am? Is not repentance enough? I have spent long nights in penitence and  tears, long days in dull aching remorse. I would have given all my future life  to atone for one dreadful hour &mdash; one unpremeditated yielding to temptation. I <em>have</em> given my life &mdash; for my secret has  killed me. What more can man or God demand of me? What more can I do to win  forgiveness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this &mdash; tell your husband the truth &mdash; however  painful, however humiliating the confession. That will be your best atonement.  That is the sacrifice which will help to reconcile you with your God. You  cannot hope for God&rsquo;s love and pardon hereafter, if you live and die as a  hypocrite here. God&rsquo;s saints were some of them steeped in the darkness of guilt  before they became the children of light &mdash; but there was not one of them who  shrank from the confession of his sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a man,&rdquo; sobbed Isola. &ldquo;You do not know  what it is for a woman to confess that she is unworthy of her husband&rsquo;s love.  You do not know. It is not possible for a man to know the meaning of shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wrong there,&rdquo; he said, gently lifting her  from the ground, and placing her beside him on the bank. &ldquo;What chastity is to a  woman, honour is to a man. Men have had to stand up before their fellow-men and  acknowledge their violation of man&rsquo;s code of honour; knowing that such  acknowledgment made them dirt, and very dirt, in the sight of honourable men.  You, as a woman, know not how deep men&rsquo;s scorn cuts a man who has sinned  against the law which governs gentlemen. A woman thinks there is no such sting  as the sting of her shame. Men know better. Yes, I know that it will be most  bitter, more bitter than death &mdash; for you to tell Colonel Disney that you are  not what you have seemed to him; but apart from all considerations of duty, do  not his love and devotion deserve the sacrifice of self-love on your part? Can  you bear yourself to the last, as a virtuous wife &mdash; enjoying his respect &mdash;  knowing that it is undeserved &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell him &mdash; at the last,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;In  that parting hour I shall not shrink from telling him all &mdash; how I sinned  against him &mdash; almost unawares &mdash; drifting half unconsciously into a fatal  entanglement &mdash; and then &mdash; and then &mdash; against my will &mdash; in my weakness and  helplessness &mdash; alone in the power of the man I loved &mdash; betrayed into sin. Oh  God! why do you make me remember?&rdquo; she cried wildly, turning upon the priest in  passionate reproachfulness. &ldquo;For years I have been trying to forget &mdash; trying to  blank out the past &mdash; praying, praying, praying that my humble, tearful love for  my husband and my child might cancel those hours of sin. And you come to me,  and question me, and on pretence of saving my soul, you force me to look back  upon that bygone horror &mdash; to live again through that time of madness &mdash; the  destruction of my life. Cruel, cruel, cruel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; said Father Rodwell, very gently,  seeing that she was struggling with hysteria. &ldquo;I have been too hard, perhaps,  too eager to convince you of the right! There are some men, even of my sacred  calling, who would judge your case otherwise &mdash; who would say the husband is  happy in his ignorance; the wife has repented of her sin. <em>Non quieta movere.</em> But it is not in my nature to choose the easy  pathways; and it may be that I am too severe a teacher. We will not talk any  more about serious things to-day. Only believe that I am your friend &mdash; your  sincere and devoted friend. If I have spoken hard things, be assured I would  have spoken in the same spirit had you been my own sister. Let us say no more  yet awhile &mdash; and perhaps when you have thought over our interview to-day you  will come to see things almost as I see them. I won&rsquo;t press the matter. I will  leave your own heart and conscience to plead with you. And now may I walk home  with you, before the beauty of the afternoon begins to fade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vetturino will be waiting for me at the gate,&rdquo;  Isola answered, with a dull, dead voice, rising languidly, and adjusting the  loosened hair about her forehead with tremulous fingers.</p>
<p>She had thrown off her hat a little while before,  and now she took it up, and straightened the loops of ribbon with a nervous  touch here and there, and then put the hat on again, and arranged the gossamer veil,  which she hoped might hide her swollen eyelids and tear-stained cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Martin should come to meet me, what will he  think?&rdquo; she said piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go with you, and I may be able to distract  his attention &mdash; if you don&rsquo;t want him to see that you have been crying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. He must not see. He would wonder, and  question me &mdash; and guess, perhaps &mdash; as you did just now. How was it you knew &mdash;  what made you guess?&rdquo; she asked, with a sense of rebellion against this man who  had pierced the veil behind which she had been hiding herself so long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw your sorrow; and I knew that there could  scarcely be so deep a sorrow if there were no memory of sin. Will you take my  arm down this steep path?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you. I know every step. I could walk  about this place in my sleep. You have been cruel to me, Father Rodwell, very  cruel. Promise me one thing by way of atonement for your cruelty. Promise me  that if I die in Rome I shall be buried in this place, and as near Shelley&rsquo;s  grave as they can find room to lay me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise. Yes, it is a sweet spot, is it not? It  was down yonder in the old burial-ground that Shelley looked upon the grave of  Keats, and said it was a spot to make one in love with death. But I would not  have you think yourself doomed to an early death, Mrs. Disney. Have you never  read in the &lsquo;Lives of the Saints&rsquo; how some who were on the point of death have  revived at the touch of the holy oil, and have lived and have renewed their  strength, and re-entered the world to lead a holier and nobler life than they  had led before? Who knows if you were to confess your sin, and patiently suffer  whatever penance you were called upon to bear, new vistas might not open for  you? There is more than one way of being happy in this world. If you could  never again know the sweetness of a domestic life &mdash; as trusted wife and happy  mother &mdash; there are other and wider lives in which you would count your children  and your sisters by hundreds. There are sisterhoods in which your future might  be full of usefulness and full of peace. Or if you had no vocation for that  wider life, it might be that touched by your helplessness in the past, and your  remorse in the present, your husband might find it in his heart to forgive that  bygone sin, and still to cherish, and still to hold you dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried impatiently. &ldquo;I would not live  for an hour after he knew. I know what he would do. He has told me. He would  leave me &mdash; at once, and for ever. I should never see his face again. I should  be dead to him, by a worse death than the grave; for he would only think of me  to shudder at my name. Oh, Father Rodwell, Christianity must be a cruel creed  if it can demand such a sacrifice from me. What good can come of his knowing  the truth? Only agony to him and shame and despair to me. Can that be good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truth is life, and falsehood is death,&rdquo; answered  the priest, firmly. &ldquo;You must choose your own course, Mrs. Disney; but there is  one argument I may urge as a man of the world rather than as a priest. Nothing  is ever hidden for very long in this life. There is no secret so closely kept  that some one has not an inkling of it. Better your husband should hear the  truth from you, in humble self-accusation, than that he should learn it later &mdash;  perhaps after he has mourned you for years &mdash; from a stranger&rsquo;s lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would be horrible &mdash; too horrible. But I  will confess to him; I will tell him everything &mdash; on my deathbed. Yes, when  life is ebbing, when the end is close, I will tell him. He shall know what a  false and perjured creature I am. I swore to him &mdash; swore before God that I was  true and faithful &mdash; that I loved him and no other. And it was true, absolute  truth, when I took that oath. My sin was a thing of the past. I had loved  another, and I had let my love lead me into sin. And then my husband asked me  if I had been true and pure always; always. &lsquo;Is that true, Isola? I call upon  God to hear your answer,&rsquo; he said. And I answered yes, it was true. I lied  before God rather than lose my husband&rsquo;s love; and God heard me, and the blight  of His anger has been upon me ever since, withering and consuming me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went down the steep pathway, Father Rodwell  first, Isola following, between the crowded graves, the azaleas and camelias,  veronica and guelder rose, lilac and magnolia, and on either hand a wilderness  of roses, red and white.</p>
<p>The shadows of the cypresses closed over them in  that deep alley, and the twilight gloom might seem symbolic of the passage  through death to life; for beyond the gates, and through a gap in the cypress  screen, the level landscape and the city domes and bell-towers were shining in  the yellow light of afternoon.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, Old Thoughts They Cling, They Cling!&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Colonel Disney and Allegra were both pleased to  welcome Father Rodwell to their home in the great city; pleased to find that  his own rooms were close by in the Via Babuino, and that he was likely to be  their neighbour for some weeks. His familiarity with all that was worth seeing  in the city and its surroundings made him a valuable companion for people whose  only knowledge had been gathered laboriously from books. Father Rodwell knew  every picture and every statue in the churches and galleries. There was not a  building in Christian or Pagan Rome which had not its history and its  associations for the man who had chosen the city as the holiday ground of his  busy life long before he left the university, and who had returned again and  again, year after year, to tread the familiar paths and ponder over the old  records. He had seen many of those monuments of Republic and Empire emerge from  the heaped-up earth of ages; had seen hills cut down, and valleys laid bare;  some picturesque spots made less picturesque; other places redeemed from ruin.  He had seen the squalor and the romance of Medi&aelig;val Rome vanish before the march  of improvement; and he had seen the triumph of the commonplace and the  utilitarian in many a scene where the melancholy beauty of neglect and decay  had once been dear to him.</p>
<p>With such a guide it was delightful to loiter  amidst the Palace of the C&aelig;sars, or tread the quiet lanes and by-paths of the  Aventine, that historic hill from whose venerable church the bearers of  Christ&rsquo;s message of peace and love set out for savage Britain. Allegra was  delighted to wander about the city with such a companion, lingering long before  every famous picture, finding out altar-pieces and frescoes which no guide-book  would have helped her to discover; sometimes disputing Father Rodwell&rsquo;s  judgment upon the artistic value of a picture; sometimes agreeing with him &mdash;  always bright, animated, and intelligent.</p>
<p>Isola joined in these explorations as far as her  strength would allow. She was deeply interested in the churches, and in the  stories of priest and pope, saint and martyr, which Father Rodwell had to tell  of every shrine and tomb, whose splendour might otherwise have seemed  colourless and cold. There was a growing enthusiasm in the attention with which  she listened to every record of that wonder-working Church which created  Christian Rome in all its pomp and dignity of architecture, and all its glory  of art. The splendour of those mighty basilicas filled her with an awful sense  of the majesty of that religion which had been founded yonder in darkness and  in chains, in Paul&rsquo;s subterranean prison &mdash; yonder in tears where Paul and Peter  spoke the solemn words of parting &mdash; yonder in blood on the dreary road to  Ostia, where the headsman&rsquo;s axe quenched the greatest light that had shone upon  earth since the sacrifice of Calvary.</p>
<p>Isola went about looking at those things like a  creature in a dream. These stupendous tabernacles impressed her with an almost  insupportable sense of their magnitude. And with that awestricken sense of  power in the Christian Church there was interwoven the humiliating  consciousness of her own unworthiness; a consciousness sharpened and  intensified by every word that Father Rodwell had spoken in that agonizing hour  of her involuntary confession.</p>
<p>He was so kind to her, so gentle, so courteous in  every word and act, that she wondered sometimes whether he had forgotten that  miserable revelation; whether he had forgotten that she was one of the lost  ones of this earth, a woman who had forfeited woman&rsquo;s first claim to man&rsquo;s  esteem. Sometimes she found herself lifting her eyes to his face in an  unpremeditated prayer for pity, as they stood before some exquisite shrine of  the Madonna, and the ineffable purity in the sculptured face looking down at  her struck like a sharp sword into her heart. That mute appeal of Isola&rsquo;s  seemed to ask, &ldquo;Has the Mother of Christ any pity for such a sinner as I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Disney was full of thoughtfulness for his  wife in all their going to and fro; and before their day&rsquo;s rambles were half  done he would drive her to any quiet spot where she might choose to spend a  restful hour in the afternoon sunshine &mdash; in this or that convent garden, in  some shaded corner on the Aventine, or among the wild flowers that flourish and  grow rank amidst the ruins of palace and temple on the Palatine. Her favourite  resort was still the English cemetery, and she always begged to be set down  within reach of that familiar gate, where the custodian knew her as well as if  she had been some restless spirit whose body lay under one of those marble  urns, and whose ghost passed in and out of the gate every day.</p>
<p>It was in vain that her husband or her sister  offered to be her companion in these restful hours. She always made the same  reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am better alone,&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;It does me  good to be alone. I don&rsquo;t like being alone indoors &mdash; I get low-spirited and  nervous &mdash; but I like to sit among the flowers, and to watch the lizards darting  in and out among the graves. I am never dull there. I take a book with me; but  I don&rsquo;t read much. I could sit there for hours in a summer dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin Disney made a point of giving way to her will  in all small things. She might be capricious, she might have morbid fancies.  That was no business of his. It was his part to indulge her every whim, and to  make her in love with life. All that he asked of Heaven was to spin out that  attenuated thread. All that he desired was to hold her and keep her for his own  against Death himself.</p>
<p>The <em>Vendetta</em> was at Civita Vecchia, from which port her skipper frequently bore down upon  Rome, distracting Allegra from her critical studies in the picture-galleries,  and from her work in her own studio, a light, airy room on the fourth floor,  with a window looking over the Pincian Gardens. Captain Hulbert was a little  inclined to resent Father Rodwell&rsquo;s frequent presence in the family circle, and  his too accomplished guidance in the galleries. It was provoking to hear a man  talk, with an almost Ruskinesque enthusiasm and critical appreciation, of  pictures which made so faint an appeal to the seaman. Here and there John  Hulbert could see the beauty and merit of a painting, and was really touched by  the influence of supreme art; but of technical qualities he knew nothing, and  could hardly distinguish one master from another, was as likely as not to take  Titian for Veronese, or Tintoret for Titian.</p>
<p>He looked with a sceptical eye at the Anglican  priest&rsquo;s cassock and girdle. If Father Rodwell had been a Papist it would have  been altogether a more satisfactory state of things; but an Anglican &mdash; a man  who might preach the beauty of holy poverty and a celibate life one year and  marry a rich widow the year after &mdash; a man bound only by his own wishes.</p>
<p>Had Allegra been a thought less frank &mdash; had she  been a woman whom it was possible to doubt &mdash; the sailor would have given  himself over to the demon of jealousy; but there are happily some women in whom  truth and purity are so transparently obvious that even an anxious lover cannot  doubt them. Allegra was such an one. No suspicion of coquetry ever lessened her  simple womanliness. She was a woman of whom a man might make a friend; a woman  whose feelings and meanings he could by no possibility mistake.</p>
<p>He had pleaded his hardest and pleaded in vain for  a June wedding. Isola&rsquo;s state of health was too critical for the contemplation  of any change in the family circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She could not do without me, nor could Martin  either,&rdquo; Allegra told her lover. &ldquo;It is I who keep house and manage their  money, and see to everything for them. Martin has been utterly helpless since  this saddening anxiety began. He thinks of nothing but Isola, and her chances  of recovery. I cannot leave him while she is so ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any hope of her ever being better, my  dear girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It has been a long and wearing  illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not illness, Allegra. It is a gradual decay.  My fear is that she will never revive. There is no marked disease &mdash; nothing for  medicine to fight against. Such cases as hers are the despair of doctors. A  spring has been broken somehow in the human machine. Science cannot mend it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allegra was very much of her sweetheart&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p>The English doctor in Rome was as kind and  attentive as the doctor at San Remo; but although he had not yet pronounced the  case hopeless, he took a by no means cheerful view of his patient&rsquo;s condition.  He recommended Colonel Disney to leave the city before the third week in May,  and to take his wife to Switzerland, travelling by easy stages, and doing all  he could to amuse and interest her. If on the other hand it were important for  Colonel Disney to be in England, he might take his wife back to Cornwall in  June. But in this case she must return to the south in October. Lungs and heart  were both too weak for the risks of an English winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not go back to England,&rdquo; decided Disney.  &ldquo;My wife is not fond of Cornwall. Italy has been a delight to her; and  Switzerland will be new ground. God grant the summer may bring about an  improvement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor said very little, and promised nothing.</p>
<p>Closely as they watched her, with anxious loving  looks, it may be that seeing her every day even their eyes did not mark the  gradual decline of vitality &mdash; the inevitable advance of decay. She never  complained; the cough that marked the disease which had fastened on her lungs  since February was not a loud or seemingly distressing cough. It was only now  and then, when she tried to walk uphill, or over-exerted herself in any way,  that her malady became painfully obvious in the labouring chest, flushed cheek,  and panting breath; but she made light even of these symptoms, and assured her  husband that Rome was curing her.</p>
<p>Her spirits had been less equable since Father  Rodwell&rsquo;s appearance. She had alternated between a feverish intensity and a  profound dejection. Her changes of mood had been sudden and apparently  causeless; and those who watched and cherished her could do nothing to dispel  the gloom that often clouded over her. If she were questioned she could only  say that she was tired. She would never admit any reason for her melancholy.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll Bind You Fast In Silken Cords&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Captain Hulbert was not selfish enough to plead for  his personal happiness in the midst of a household shadowed by the foreboding  of a great sorrow. Martin Disney&rsquo;s face, as he looked at his wife in those  moments which too plainly marked the progress of decay, was in itself enough to  put a check upon a lover&rsquo;s impatience. How could any man plead for his own  pleasure &mdash; for the roses and sunshine of life &mdash; in the presence of that deep  despair?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows that he is doomed to lose her,&rdquo; thought  Hulbert; &ldquo;knows it, and yet tries to hope. I never saw such intense, unquestioning  love. One asks one&rsquo;s self involuntarily about any woman &mdash; Is she worth it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he thought of Allegra, truthful and  impulsive, strong as steel, transparent as crystal. Yes, such a woman as that  was worth the whole of a man&rsquo;s heart &mdash; worthy that a man should live or die for  her. But it seemed to him that to compare Isola with Allegra was to liken an  ash sapling to an oak.</p>
<p>He resigned himself to his disappointment, talked  no more of Venice and the starlit lagunes, the summer nights on the Lido, and  quoted no more of Buskin&rsquo;s rhapsodies; but he came meekly day after day to join  in the family excursion, whatever it might be. He had enough and to spare of  ecclesiastical architecture and of the old masters during those summer-like  mornings and afternoons. He heard more than enough of the mad C&aelig;sars and the  bad C&aelig;sars, of wicked Empresses and of low-born favourites, of despotism  throned in the palace and murder waiting at the gate, of tyranny drunken with  power long abused, and treason on the watch for the golden opportunity to  change one profligate master for another, ready to toss up for the new C&aelig;sar,  and to accept the basest slave for master, would be but open the Imperial  treasury wide enough to the Pr&aelig;torian&rsquo;s rapacious hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People gloat over these hoary old walls as if they  would like to have lived under Caligula,&rdquo; said the sailor, with a touch of  impatience, when Father Rodwell had been expatiating upon a little bit of  moulding which decorated an imperial staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been at least a picturesque time to  have lived in,&rdquo; said Allegra. &ldquo;Existence must have been a series of pictures by  Alma Tadema.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Hulbert was startled out of his state of  placid submission by the intervention of a most unexpected ally.</p>
<p>It was one of the hottest days there had been since  they came to Rome. To cross the Piazza in front of St. Peter&rsquo;s was like  plunging into a bath of molten gold; while to enter the great Basilica itself  was like going into an ice-house. Father Rodwell was not with them upon this particular  morning. They were a party of four, and a roomy landau had been engaged to take  them to the Church of St. Paul beyond the walls, and thence to the tomb of  Cecilia Metella. Isola and Allegra had made pilgrimages to the spot before  to-day. It was a drive they both loved, a glimpse of the pastoral life outside  the gates of the city, and a place for ever associated with the poet whose  verse was written in their hearts.</p>
<p>They dawdled over a light luncheon of macaroni and  Roman wine at a <em>caf&eacute;</em> near the great  cold white church, and then they drove through the sandy lanes in the heat of  the afternoon, languid all of them, and Isola paler and more weary-looking than  she had been for some time. Her husband watched her anxiously, and wanted to go  back to Rome, lest the drive should be too exhausting for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I am not tired,&rdquo; she answered impatiently.  &ldquo;I would much rather go on. I want to see that grim old tower again,&rdquo; and then  she quoted the familiar lines, dreamily, with a faint pleasure in their music &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Perchance she died in youth: it may be bowed<br>
  With woes far heavier than the ponderous tomb<br>
  That weighed upon her gentle dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she added confusedly, &ldquo;I want to have a  little private talk with Captain Hulbert, while Allegra is busy with her everlasting  memoranda in that dirty little sketchbook which is stuffed with the pictures of  the future. May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked from her husband to Captain Hulbert  pleadingly. The latter was first to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am at your service, Mrs. Disney; ready to be  interrogated, or lectured, or advised, whichever you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to do either of the three. I am  going to ask you a favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider that to ask is to be obeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They alighted in the road by the tomb a few minutes  afterwards. Allegra&rsquo;s note-book was out immediately, a true artist&rsquo;s book,  crammed with every conceivable form of artistic reminiscence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and talk,&rdquo; she said, waving her hand to Isola  and Hulbert; and then she clambered up a bank opposite that tower of other days  to get a vantage ground for her sketch.</p>
<p>She had made a score of sketches on the same spot,  but there were always new details to jot down, new effects and ideas, on that  vast level which frames the grandeur of Rome. Yonder the long line of the  aqueduct; here the living beauty of broad-fronted oxen moving with stately  paces along the dusty way, the incarnation of strength and majesty, patience  and labour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here and smoke your cigar, Martin,&rdquo; said  Isola, &ldquo;while Captain Hulbert and I go for a stroll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband smiled at her tenderly, cheered by her  unwonted cheerfulness. His days and hours alternated between hope and despair.  This was a moment of hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest, you are full of mystery to-day,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;and I am as full of curiosity. But I can wait. Consider me a statue of  patience standing by the way-side, and take your time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her hand through Hulbert&rsquo;s arm, and led him  away from the other two, sauntering slowly along beside the grassy bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk about your wedding,&rdquo; she said, as  soon as they were out of hearing. &ldquo;When are you and Allegra going to be  married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Disney, you know that I pledged  myself to wait a year from the time of our engagement &mdash; a year from last  Christmas &mdash; you must remember. That was to be my probation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember; but that is all foolishness &mdash;  idle romance. Allegra knows that you love her. I don&rsquo;t think she could know it  any better after another half-year&rsquo;s devotion on your part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she could know it better after  another half century. I know I could never love her more than I do now. I know  I shall never love her less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that you are good and true,&rdquo; said Isola.  &ldquo;As true and &mdash; almost &mdash; as good as he is&rdquo; &mdash; with a backward glance at her  husband. &ldquo;If I did not believe that I should not have thought of saying what I  am going to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am honoured by your confidence in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love Allegra too well to hazard her happiness. I  know she loves you &mdash; has never cared for any one else. She was heart-whole till  she saw you. She had no more thought of love, or lovers, than a child. I want  you to marry her soon, Captain Hulbert &mdash; very soon, before we leave Rome. Would  you not like to be married in Rome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to be married in Kamtchatka, or Nova  Zembla &mdash; or the worst of those places whose very names suggest  uncomfortableness. There is no dismallest corner of the earth which Allegra  could not glorify and make dear. But, as you suggest, Rome is classic &mdash; Rome is  medi&aelig;val &mdash; Rome is Roman Catholic. It would be a new sensation for a plain man  like me to be married in Rome. I suppose it could not be managed in St.  Peter&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Captain Hulbert, I want you to be serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am serious. Why, this is a matter of life or  death to me. But I pleaded so hard for a June wedding &mdash; and to no purpose. I  talked with the artfulness of the first Tempter &mdash; I tried to play upon her  vanities as an artist. All in vain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her that I have set my heart upon seeing her  married,&rdquo; said Isola, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, you will see her married, whether  she be married in Rome or at Trelasco. That is no argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is; indeed it is. Tell her that, if I am to  be at her wedding, it must be soon, very soon. Life is so uncertain at best &mdash;  and, although I feel well and strong, sometimes &mdash; to-day, for instance &mdash; there  are other times when I think the end is nearer than even my doctor suspects.  And I know by his face that he does not give me a long lease of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mrs. Disney, this is morbid. I am grieved  to hear you talk in such a strain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t notice that. Don&rsquo;t say anything depressing  to Allegra. I want her to go off to her Venetian honeymoon very happily &mdash; with  not one cloud in her sky. She has been so good and dear to me. It would be hard  if I could not rejoice in her happiness. I have rejoiced in it always; I shall  take pleasure in it to the end of my life. It is the one unclouded spot &mdash;&mdash; .&rdquo;  She stopped with a troubled air. &ldquo;Yes, it is a happy fate &mdash; to have cared for  one, and one only, and to be loved again. Will you do what I ask you, Captain  Hulbert? will you hurry on the wedding &mdash; for my sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would do anything difficult and unwelcome for  your sake &mdash; how much more will I hasten my own happiness &mdash; if I can. But  Allegra is a difficult personage &mdash; as firm as rock when she has once made up  her mind. And she has made up her mind to stay with you till you are quite well  and strong again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She need not leave me for ever, because she  marries. She can come back to me after a long honeymoon. We can all meet in  Switzerland in August &mdash; if &mdash; if I go there with Martin, as he proposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will try to bend that stubborn will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t mind having a quiet wedding, if she  consents to a much earlier date?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind? The quieter the better for me! I think a  smart wedding is a preventive of matrimony. That sounds like a bull. I will say  I think there are many wretched bachelors living in dismal chambers, and preyed  upon by landladies, who might have been happily married, but for the fear of a  smart wedding. We will have as quiet a wedding as you and Disney can desire;  but I should like Lostwithiel to be present. He is my only near relation, and I  don&rsquo;t want to cut him on the happiest day of my life. Why, Mrs. Disney, you are  trembling! You have agitated yourself about this business; you have talked too  much for your strength. Let me take you back to the carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently &mdash; yes, yes. The heat overcame me for a  moment, that&rsquo;s all. Would you mind not waiting for Lord Lostwithiel? I want the  marriage to be at once &mdash; directly &mdash; as soon as Father Rodwell can get it arranged.  And you don&rsquo;t know where a telegram would reach your brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I do not; but by speculating a few  messages of inquiry I could soon find out the whereabouts of the <em>Eurydice</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait for that. There would be delay. There  must be delay if you have to consult any distant person&rsquo;s convenience. We are  all here &mdash; you and Allegra, and Martin and I &mdash; and Father Rodwell would like to  marry you. What do you want with anybody else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, I think you are right! Allegra is a  creature of impulse &mdash; where principle is not at stake. If I asked her to marry  me six weeks hence she would parley and make terms. If I ask her to marry me in  a few days &mdash; before we leave Rome &mdash; she may consent. Have you talked to your  husband? Is he of your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have said nothing to him; but I know he would be  pleased to see you and Allegra bound together for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will talk to him this afternoon. One can get  everything one wants in Rome, I believe, from a papal dispensation down to an  English solicitor. If we can but rattle through some kind of marriage  settlement to your husband&rsquo;s satisfaction we can be married on the earliest day  to which my darling will consent. God bless you, Mrs. Disney, for your  unselfish thought of other people&rsquo;s happiness! You are not like most invalids,  who would let a sister languish in lifelong spinsterhood rather than lose her  as a nurse. God grant that your unselfishness may be recompensed by speedy  recovery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be a weight off my mind when you and  Allegra are married,&rdquo; said Isola, gravely.</p>
<p>They walked slowly back to the spot where they had  left their companions. A pair of oxen, with an empty cart, were standing in the  road below the tomb, their driver lounging across the rough vehicle &mdash; man and  beasts motionless as marble. Allegra sat on a hillock opposite, sketching the  group. She had bribed the man to draw up for a brief halt while she made her  sketch. The massive heads were drooping under the afternoon sun; the tawny and  cream-hued coats were stained with dust and purpled with the sweat of patient  labour. The creatures looked as gracious and as wise as if they had been gods  in disguise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Allegra,&rdquo; said her brother, emptying the  ashes out of his pipe, &ldquo;are you ready to go home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have just jotted down what will serve to  remind me of those splendid beasts; but I should like to have them standing  there all day, so that I could paint them seriously. They are the finest models  I have seen in Rome. Have you two quite finished your secrets and mysteries?&rdquo;  she asked, smiling at Isola, who was looking brighter than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I have said all I had to say, and have been  answered as I wished to be answered. I shall go home very happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good hearing,&rdquo; said Disney, as he helped  her into the landau.</p>
<p>Allegra had talked of wanting to revisit  Caracalla&rsquo;s Baths, a wish of which Isola reminded her as they drove back to the  city, along the Appian Way: whereupon Captain Hulbert suggested that he and his  sweetheart should stop to explore the ruins, while Disney and Isola went home.</p>
<p>Allegra blushed and consented, always a little shy  at being alone with her lover, especially since he had pleaded go earnestly for  a summer honeymoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Disney, your right place in Rome would be the  Embassy,&rdquo; murmured Hulbert as he shut the carriage door; &ldquo;you are a born  diplomatist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes my dearest look so pleased and happy  this afternoon?&rdquo; asked Disney, as he changed to the seat beside his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad because I think Captain Hulbert will  persuade Allegra to marry him before we leave Rome. I begged him to hasten  their marriage. That was my mystery, Martin. That was what he and I were  talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why wish to hasten matters, dear? They are  very happy as it is &mdash; and a year is not a long engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too long for me, Martin. I want to see her happy &mdash;  I want to see them married before &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before what, dear love?&rdquo; he asked tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we leave Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be very short work. We leave in a  fortnight. The weather will be growing too hot for you if we linger later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but everything can be settled in less time  than that. Ask Father Rodwell. He knows Rome so well that he can help you to  arrange all details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that every young woman required at least  six months for the preparation of her trousseau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not such a girl as Allegra. She is always well  dressed, and her wardrobe is the perfection of neatness &mdash; but she is not the  kind of girl to make a fuss about her clothes. I don&rsquo;t think the trousseau will  create any difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when she is gone, what will you do without  your devoted companion? Who will nurse you and take care of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&ouml;ttchen, or any other servant,&rdquo; she answered,  with a kind of weary indifference. &ldquo;It would be very hard if my bad health  should stand in the way of Allegra&rsquo;s happiness. So long as you will stay with  me and be kind to me, Martin, I need no one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears were streaming down her cheeks as she turned  from him, pretending to be interested in the convent walls on the edge of the  hill below which they were driving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as I stay with you! My darling, do you  think business or pleasure, or any claim in this world, will ever take me from  you any more? All your hours are precious to me, Isola. I hardly live when I am  away from you. Wherever your doctor may send you, or your own fancy may lead  you, I shall go with you, unhesitatingly &mdash; without one regret for anything I  leave behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say these things,&rdquo; she cried suddenly, with  a choking sob; &ldquo;you are too good to me. There are times when I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
  &ldquo;So, Full Content Shall Henceforth Be My Lot&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Allegra was not inexorable. There, in the ruins of  the Imperial baths, where Shelley dreamed the wonder-dream of his Prometheus,  Captain Hulbert pleaded his cause. Could love resist the pleading of so fond a  lover? Could art withstand the allurements of Venice &mdash; Titian and Tintoret, the  cathedral of St. Mark and the Palace of the Doges, the birthplace of Desdemona  and of Shylock, the home of Byron and of Browning?</p>
<p>She consented to a Roman marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help wishing I could be a Papist just for  that one day,&rdquo; she said lightly. &ldquo;An Anglican marriage seems so dry and cold  compared with the pomps and splendours of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest, the plainest Christian rites are enough,  if they but make us one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we are that already, John,&rdquo; she answered  shyly; and then, nestling by his side as they sat in the wide solitude of that  stupendous pile, she took his hand and held it in both her own, looking down at  it wonderingly &mdash; a well-formed hand, strong and muscular, broadened a little by  seafaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are to be my husband,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mine! I  shall speak of you to people as my own peculiar property. &lsquo;My husband will do  this or that.&rsquo; &lsquo;My husband has gone out, but he will be home soon.&rsquo; Home.  Husband. How strange it sounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange and wonderful now, love. Sweet and  familiar before our honeymoon is ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went out of the broad spaces that were once  populous with the teeming life of Imperial Rome, splendid with all that art  could create of beauty and of grandeur &mdash; wrapt in the glamour of their dream.  They walked all the way to the Piazza di Spagna in the same happy dream, as  unconscious of the ground they trod on as if they had been floating in the air.</p>
<p>They were a very cheerful party at dinner that  evening. Father Rodwell dined with them, and was delighted at the idea of  having to marry these happy lovers. He took the arrangement of the ceremony  into his own hands. The English chaplain was his old friend, and would let him  do what he liked in his church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to be a very quiet wedding,&rdquo; said the  colonel, when the three men were smoking together in a loggia, looking on the  little garden of orange trees and oleanders, in the grey dim beginning of  night, when the thin crescent moon was shining in a sky still faintly flushed  with sunset. &ldquo;Isa could not stand anything like bustle or excitement. Luckily  we have no friends in Rome. There is no one belonging to us who could be  aggrieved at not being invited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there is no one except Lostwithiel on my side  who has the slightest claim to be present,&rdquo; said Hulbert. &ldquo;I am almost as well  off as the Flying Dutchman in that respect. I am not troubled with relations.  All the kinsfolk I have are distant, and I allow them to remain so. My dear  Disney, so far as I am concerned, our wedding cannot be too quiet a business.  It is the bride I want, mark you, not the fuss and flowers, wedding-breakfast,  and bridesmaids. Let us be married at half-past ten, and drive from the church  to the railway station in time for the noonday train. I have given up my dream  of taking Allegra round Southern Italy to the Adriatic. We shall go to Florence  first, and spend a few days in the galleries, and thence to Venice, where we  will have the <em>Vendetta</em> brought to us,  and anchored near the arsenal, ready to carry us away directly we are tired of  the city of old memories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father Rodwell left them and went into the  drawing-room, where Isola and her sister-in-law were sitting in the lamplight &mdash;  Isola&rsquo;s hands occupied with that soft, fluffy knitting which seemed to exercise  a soothing influence upon her nerves; Allegra leaning over the table, idly  sketching random reminiscences of the Baths, the Tomb, the grave-eyed oxen,  with their great curving horns and ponderous foreheads.</p>
<p>The priest was interested in watching Isola this  evening. He saw a marked change in the expression of her countenance, a change  which was perceptible to him even in her voice and manner &mdash; a brightness which  might mean a lightened heart, or which might mean religious exaltation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she told him?&rdquo; he wondered, studying her from  his place in the shadow as the lamplight shone full upon her wasted features  and hectic colouring. &ldquo;Has she taken courage and confessed her sin to that  loyal, loving husband, and is the burden lifted from her heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No; he could not believe that she had lifted the  veil from the sad secret of her past. Martin Disney&rsquo;s unclouded brow to-night  was not that of a man who had lately discovered that the wife he loved had  betrayed him. There might be pardon &mdash; there might be peace between husband and  wife after such a revelation; but there could not be the serenity which marked  Martin Disney&rsquo;s manner to his wife to-night. Such a thunder-clap must leave its  brand upon the man who suffered it. No; her secret was still locked in her  impenitent heart. Sorry &mdash; yes. She had drunk the cup of remorse in all its  bitterness; but she knew not true penitence, the Christian&rsquo;s penitence, which  means self-abasement and confession. And yet she seemed happier. There was a  look of almost holy resignation upon the pale and placid brow, and in the  too-lustrous eyes. Something had happened &mdash; some moral transformation which  made her a new being.</p>
<p>Father Rodwell drew his chair nearer to her, and  looked at her earnestly with his cordial, almost boyish smile. He was a  remarkably young-looking man, a man upon whom long years of toil in the dark  places of the earth had exercised no wasting or withering influence. He had  loved his work too well ever to feel the pressure of the burdens he carried.  His gospel had been always a cheerful gospel, and he had helped to lighten  sorrows, never to make them heavier. He was deeply interested in Isola, and had  been watchful of all her changes of mood since their conversation in the shadow  of the old Roman wall. He had seen her impressed by the history and traditions  of the church, moved by the pathos of holy lives, touched almost to tears by  sacred pictures, and he saw in her character and disposition a natural bent  towards piety, exactly that receptive temperament which moves holy women to  lives of self-abnegation and heroic endeavour. He had lent her some of those  books which he loved best and read most himself, and he had talked with her of  religion, careful not to say too much or with too strong an emphasis, and never  by any word alluding to her revelation of past guilt. He wanted to win her to  perfect trustfulness in him, to teach her to lean upon him in her helplessness;  until the hour should come when she would let him lead her to her husband, in  the self-abasement of the penitent sinner.</p>
<p>He knew that in this desire he exceeded the  teaching of churchmen; that another priest in his place might have bade her  keep her sad secret to the end, he down with it in her early grave, be  remembered as a saint, yet die knowing herself a sinner. If he had thought of  the husband&rsquo;s peace first, he would have counselled silence. But he thought  most of this stricken soul, with wings that spread themselves towards heaven,  held down to earth by the burden of an unpardoned sin.</p>
<p>He looked at her in the lamplight, and her eyes met  his with a straighter outlook than he had seen in them for a long time. She  looked actually happy, and that look of happiness in a face on which death has  set its seal has always something which suggests a life beyond the grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The excitement of this marriage question has  brightened you wonderfully, Mrs. Disney,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We shall have you in high  health by the wedding-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am feeling better because I am so glad,&rdquo; Isola  answered naively, putting her hand into Allegra&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider it positively insulting to me as a  sister,&rdquo; exclaimed Allegra, bending down to kiss the too-transparent hand &mdash;  such a hand as she had seen in many a picture of dying saint in the Roman  galleries. &ldquo;You are most unaffectionately rejoiced to get rid of me. I have  evidently been a tyrannical nurse, and a dull companion, and you breathe more  freely at the prospect of release.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been all that is dear and good,&rdquo; Isola  answered softly, &ldquo;and I shall feel dreadfully lonely without you; but it won&rsquo;t  be for long. And I shall be so comforted by the knowledge that nothing can come  between you and your life&rsquo;s happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men came in from the loggia, bringing with  them the cool breath of night. Isola went to the piano and played one of those  Adagios of Mozart&rsquo;s which came just within the limit of her modest powers, and  which she played to perfection, all her soul in the long lingering phrases, the  tender modulations, with their suggestions of shadowy cathedral aisles, and the  smoke of incense in the deepening dusk of a vesper service. Those bits of  Mozart, the slow movements from the Sonatas, an Agnus Dei, or an Ave Maria from  one of the Masses, satisfied Captain Hulbert&rsquo;s highest ideas of music. He  desired nothing grander or more scientific. The new learning of the Wagnerian  school had no charm for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ask me about modern composers, I am for  Verdi and Gounod,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For gaiety and charm, give me Auber, Rossini, and  Boieldieu &mdash; for pathos, Weber &mdash; for everything, Mozart. There you have the  whole of my musical education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question of settlements was opened seriously  between Martin Disney and his future brother-in-law, early on the following  morning. Hulbert wanted to settle all the money he had in the world upon  Allegra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is ever so much wiser than I am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So  she had better be my treasurer. My property is all in stocks and shares. My  grandfather was fond of stock-jobbing, and made some very lucky investments  which he settled upon my mother, with strict injunctions that they should not  be meddled with by her trustees. My share of her fortune comes to a little over  nine hundred a year. I came into possession of it when I came of age, and it is  mine to dispose of as I like, trusts expired, trustees cleared off &mdash; in point  of fact, both gone over to the majority, poor old souls, after having had many  an anxious hour about those South American railway bonds, and Suez Canal  shares, which turned up trumps after all. I&rsquo;ve telegraphed to the family lawyer  for a schedule of the property, and when that comes, just tie it all up in as  tight a knot as the law can tie, and let it belong to Allegra and her children  after her. Consider me paid off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin Disney laughed at the lover&rsquo;s impetuosity &mdash;  and told him that he should be allowed to bring so much and no more into  settlement. Allegra&rsquo;s income was less than two hundred a year, a poor little  income upon which she had fancied herself rich, so modest is woman&rsquo;s measure of  independence as compared with man&rsquo;s. It would be for the lawyer to decide what  proportion the husband&rsquo;s settlements should bear to the wife&rsquo;s income. Father  Rodwell had given Colonel Disney an introduction to a solicitor of high  character, a man who had occupied an excellent position in London until damaged  lungs obliged him to seek a home in the south.</p>
<p>With this gentleman&rsquo;s aid, matters were soon put in  train, and while the men were in the lawyer&rsquo;s office, the two women were  choosing Allegra&rsquo;s wedding-gown.</p>
<p>The young lady had exhibited a rare indifference  upon the great trousseau question. She was not one of those girls whose finery  is all external, and who hide rags and tatters under &aelig;sthetic colouring and  Raffaelle draperies. She was too much of an artist to endure anything unseemly  in her belongings, and her everyday clothes, just as they were, might have been  exhibited, like a Royal trousseau, without causing any other comment than, &ldquo;How  nice!&rdquo; &ldquo;What good taste!&rdquo; &ldquo;What exquisite needlework!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hands which painted such clever pictures were  as skilful with the needle as with the brush, and Allegra had never considered  that a vocation for art meant uselessness in every feminine industry. She had  attended to her own wardrobe from the time she learnt plain sewing at her first  school; and now, as she and Isola looked over the ample array of under-linen,  the pretty cambric peignoirs, and neatly trimmed petticoats, they were both of  one mind, that there was very little need of fuss or expenditure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have plenty of summer frocks,&rdquo; said Allegra. &ldquo;So  really there is only my travelling gown to see about, that is to say, the gown  I am to be married in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must have a real wedding-gown, all the  same, a white satin gown, with lace and pearls,&rdquo; pleaded Isola. &ldquo;When you go to  dinner-parties, by-and-by, you will be expected to look like a bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner-parties! Oh, those are a long way off. We  are not likely to be asked to any parties while we are wandering about Italy. I  can get a gown when I go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allegra&rsquo;s wedding-day had dawned &mdash; a glorious day &mdash;  a day to make one drunken with the beauty of sky and earth; a day when the  vetturini in the Piazza di Spagna sat and dreamt on their coach-boxes &mdash;  narcotized by the sun &mdash; when the reds and blues in the garments of the  flower-women were almost too dazzling for the eye to look upon, and when every  garden in the city sent forth tropical odours of roses steeped in sunlight.</p>
<p>The church in which the lovers were to be made one  was a very homely temple as compared with the basilicas yonder on the hills of  Rome. But what did that matter to Allegra this morning as she stood before the  altar and spoke the words which gave her to the man she loved? A flood of  sunshine streamed upon the two figures of bride and bridegroom, and touched the  almost spectral face of the bride&rsquo;s sister-in-law, a face which attracted as  much attention as the bride&rsquo;s fresh bloom and happy smile. It was a face marked  for death, yet beautiful in decay. The large violet eyes were luminous with the  light of worlds beyond the world we know. There was something loftier than  happiness in that vivid look, something akin to exaltation &mdash; the smile of the  martyr at the stake &mdash; the martyr for whom Heaven&rsquo;s miraculous intervention  changes the flames of the death-pile into the soft fanning of seraphic wings;  the martyr unconscious of earthly pains and earthly cruelties; who sees the  skies opening and the glorious company of saints and angels gathered about the  great white throne.</p>
<p>Father Rodwell saw that spiritual expression in the  pale, wasted face, and he told himself that a lost soul could not look out of  eyes like those. If death were near, as he feared, the true repentance for  which he had prayed many an earnest prayer was not far off.</p>
<p>Bride and bridegroom were to leave Rome by the  mid-day train. Colonel Disney was going to see the last of them at the station,  but Isola and her sister-in-law were to say good-bye in the vestry, and to part  at the church door. And now Father Rodwell&rsquo;s brief, but fervent, address had  been spoken, the Wedding March pealed from the organ, and the small  wedding-party went into the vestry to sign the registers.</p>
<p>Isola was called upon for her signature as one of  the witnesses. She signed in a bold, clear hand, without one tremulous line,  her husband looking over her shoulder as she wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t look like an invalid&rsquo;s autograph,  does it, Hulbert?&rdquo; he asked, snatching at every token of hope, unwilling to  believe what his doctors and his own convictions told him &mdash; expecting a  miracle.</p>
<p>They had warned him that he could not keep her  long. They had advised him to humour her fancies, to let her be present at the  wedding, even at the hazard of her suffering afterwards for that exertion and  excitement. She would suffer more perhaps &mdash; physically as well as mentally &mdash; if  she were thwarted in her natural wish to be by Allegra&rsquo;s side on that day.</p>
<p>All was finished. Neither Church nor law could do  anything more towards making the lovers man and wife. The law might undo the  bond for them in the time to come, but the part of the Church was done for  ever. In the eye of the Church their union was indissoluble.</p>
<p>Isola clung with her arms round the bride&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of me sometimes, dearest, in the years to  come. Think that I loved you fondly. Be sure that I was grateful for all your  goodness to me,&rdquo; she said tearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own love, I shall think of you every day till  we meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we never meet again on earth &mdash; will you  remember me kindly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isa, how can you?&rdquo; cried Allegra, silencing the  pale lips with kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be glad to think how much you did towards  making my life happy &mdash; happier than it ought to have been.&rdquo; Isola went on in a  low voice. &ldquo;Dearest, I am more glad of your marriage than words can say; and,  Allegra, love him with all your heart, and never let your lives be parted &mdash;  remember, dearest, never, never let anything upon this earth part you from  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice was choked with sobs, and then came a  worse fit of coughing than she had suffered for some time; a fit which left her  exhausted and speechless. Her husband looked at her in an agony of  apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take you home, Isa,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be  better at home, lying down by your sunny window. This vestry is horribly cold.  Hulbert, if you and Allegra will excuse me, I won&rsquo;t see you off at the station.  Father Rodwell will go with you, perhaps. He&rsquo;ll be of more use than I could be;  and we shall see each other very soon again in Switzerland, please God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, There is no need for you to go,&rdquo; Hulbert  answered, grasping his hand, distressed for another man&rsquo;s pain in the midst of  his own happiness. There death, and the end of all joy &mdash; here the new life with  its promises of gladness just opening before him. Such contrasts must needs  seem hard.</p>
<p>They all went to the church door, where the  carriages were waiting. Only a few idlers loitered about the pavement, faintly  interested in so shabby a wedding &mdash; a poor array of one landau and one  brougham, the brougham to take the travellers to the station, where their  luggage had been sent by another conveyance.</p>
<p>The two women kissed each other once more before  Allegra stepped into the carriage, Isola too weak for speech, and able only to  clasp the hands that had waited on her in so many a weary hour; the clever  hands, the gentle hands, to which womanly instinct and womanly love had given  all the skilfulness of a trained nurse.</p>
<p>Disney lifted his wife into the landau, Father  Rodwell helping him, full of sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll dine with us to-night, I hope,&rdquo; said the  colonel. &ldquo;We shall be very low if we are left to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an engagement for this evening &mdash; but &mdash; yes,  I&rsquo;ll get myself excused, and spend the evening with you, if you really want  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed we do,&rdquo; answered Disney, heartily; but  Isola was dumb. Her eyes were fixed upon the distant point at which the  brougham had disappeared round a corner, on its way to the station.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
  &ldquo;Gone Deeper Than All Plummets Sound&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Church bells are always ringing in that city of  many churches, and there were bells ringing solemnly and slowly as Isola walked  feebly up the two flights of stairs that led to Colonel Disney&rsquo;s lodging. She  walked even more slowly than usual, and her husband could hear her labouring  breath as she went up, step by step, leaning on the banister rail. He had  offered her his arm, but she had repulsed him, almost rudely, at the bottom of  the stairs.</p>
<p>They went into the drawing-room, which was bright  with flowers in a sunlit dusk, the sun streaming in through the narrow opening  between the Venetian shutters, which had been drawn together, but not fastened.  All was very still in the quiet house; so still that they could hear the splash  of the fountain in the Piazza, and the faint rustling of the limes in the  garden.</p>
<p>Husband and wife stood facing each other, he  anxious and alarmed, she deadly pale, and with gleaming eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she is gone &mdash; she is Mrs. Hulbert now, and  she belongs to him and not to us any more,&rdquo; said Disney, talking at random,  watching his wife&rsquo;s face in nervous apprehension of &mdash; he knew not what. &ldquo;We  shall miss her sadly. Aren&rsquo;t you sorry she is married, Isola, after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry! No! I am glad &mdash; glad with all my heart. I  have waited for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, before he was aware, she had flung  herself at his feet, and was kneeling there, with her head hanging down, her  hands clasped &mdash; a very Magdalen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I waited &mdash; till they were married &mdash; so that you  should not refuse to let her marry &mdash; his brother &mdash; waited to tell you what I  ought to have told you at once, when you came home from India. My only hope of  pardon or of peace was to have told you then &mdash; to have left you for ever then &mdash;  never to have dared to clasp your hand &mdash; never to have dared to call myself  your wife &mdash; never to have become the mother of your child. All my life since  that day has been one long lie; and nothing that I have suffered &mdash; not all my  agonies of remorse &mdash; can atone for that lie, unless God and you will accept my  confession and my atonement to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isola, for God&rsquo;s sake, stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the racking cough seized her, and she sank  speechless at his feet.</p>
<p>He lifted her in his arms and carried her to the  sofa, and flung open the shutters and let the light and air stream in upon her,  as she lay prostrate and exhausted, wiping her white lips with a blood-stained  handkerchief. He looked at her in a kind of horrified compassion. He thought  that she was raving, that the excitement of the morning had culminated in fever  and delirium. He was going to ring for help, meaning to send instantly for her  doctor, when she stopped him, laying her thin cold hand upon his arm, and  holding him by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down by me, Martin &mdash; don&rsquo;t stop me &mdash; I must  tell you &mdash; all &mdash; the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her words came slowly, in gasps; then with a great  effort she gathered up the poor remnant of her strength, and went on in a low,  tremulous voice, yet with the tone of one whose resolve was strong as death  itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a time when I thought I could never tell  you &mdash; that I must go down to my grave with my sin unrevealed, and that you  would never know how worthless a woman you had loved and cherished. Then, on my  knees before my God, I vowed that I would tell you all, at the last, when I was  dying &mdash; and death is not far off now, Martin. I have delayed too long &mdash; too  long! There is scarcely any atonement in my confession now. I have cheated you  out of your love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her horror-stricken, their two faces  close to each other as he bent over her pillow.</p>
<p>No; this was no delirium &mdash; there was a terrible  reality in her words. The eyes looking up at him were not bright with fever,  but with the steady resolute soul within &mdash; the soul panting for freedom from  sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have cheated me out of my love,&rdquo; he repeated  slowly. &ldquo;Does that mean that you lied to me that night in London &mdash; that you  perjured yourself, calling God to witness that you were pure and true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was true to you then, Martin. My sin had been repented  of. I was your loving, loyal wife, without one thought but of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loving, loyal!&rdquo; he cried, with passionate scorn.  &ldquo;You had deceived and dishonoured me &mdash; you had made your name a by-word &mdash; a  jest for such a man as Vansittart Crowther &mdash; and for how many more? You had  lied, and lied, and lied to me &mdash; by every look, by every word that made you  seem a virtuous woman and a faithful wife. My God, what misery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin, have pity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity! Yes, I pity the women in the streets! Am I  to pity you, as I pity them? You, whom I worshipped &mdash; whom I thought as pure as  the angels &mdash; wearing nothing of earth but your frail loveliness, which to me  always seemed more of spirit than of clay. And you were false all the time &mdash;  false as hell &mdash; the toy of the first idle profligate whom chance flung into  your path? It was Lostwithiel! That man was right. He would hardly have dared  to talk to you as he did if he had not been certain of his facts. Lostwithiel  was your lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin, have pity!&rdquo; she repeated, with her hands clasped  before her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity! Don&rsquo;t I tell you that I pity you &mdash; pity you  whom I used to revere! Great God! can you guess what pain it is to change  respect for the creature one loves into pity? I told you that I would never  hurt you &mdash; that I would never bring shame upon you, Isola. You have no  unkindness to fear from me. But you have broken my heart, you have slain my  faith in man and woman. I could have staked my life on your purity &mdash; I could  have killed the man who slandered you &mdash; and you swore a false oath &mdash; you called  upon Heaven to witness a lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a miserable creature, Martin. I could not  bear to lose your love. If death had been my only penalty I could have borne  it, but not the loss of your love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your sister and her husband? They were as  ready with their lies as you were,&rdquo; he exclaimed bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame Gwendolen. I telegraphed to her,  imploring her to stand by me &mdash; to say that I was in London with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were not in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, except to pass through, when &mdash; when I had escaped  from him, and was on my way home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Escaped! My God! What villainy must have been used  against you &mdash; so young, so helpless! Tell me all &mdash; without reserve &mdash; as freely  as you want to be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not utterly wicked, Martin. I did not sin  deliberately &mdash; I did not know what I was doing when I wrecked my life and  destroyed my peace of mind for ever. I never meant to forget you &mdash; or to be  false to you &mdash; but I was so lonely &mdash; so lonely. The days were so dreary and so  long &mdash; even the short autumn days seemed long &mdash; and the evenings were so  melancholy without you. And he came into my life suddenly &mdash; like a prince in a  fairy tale &mdash; and at first I thought very little about him. He was nothing more  to me than any one else in Trelasco &mdash; and then somehow we were always meeting  by accident &mdash; in the lanes &mdash; or by the sea &mdash; and he seemed to care for all the  things I cared for. The books I loved were his favourites. For a long time we  talked of nothing but his travels, and of my favourite books. There was not a word  spoken between us that you or any one else could blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A common opening,&rdquo; said Martin Disney, with  scathing contempt. &ldquo;One of the seducer&rsquo;s favourite leads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, one evening in the twilight, he told me  that he loved me. I was very angry &mdash; and I let him see that I was angry, and I  did all I could to avoid him after that evening. I refused to go to the ball at  Lostwithiel, knowing that I must meet him there. But they all persuaded me &mdash;  Mrs. Crowther, Mrs. Baynham, Tabitha &mdash; they were all bent upon making me go &mdash;  and I went. Oh, God, if I had but stood firm against their foolish persuasion,  if I had but been true to myself! But my own heart fought against me. I wanted  to see him again &mdash; if only for the last time. He had talked about starting for  a long cruise to the Mediterranean. His yacht was ready to sail at an hours  notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went, and you were lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lost, irretrievably lost! It is all one long,  wild dream when I look back upon it. He implored me to go away with him &mdash; but I  told him no, no, no, not for worlds, nothing should ever make me false to my  husband &mdash; nothing. I swore it &mdash; swore an oath which I had not the strength to  keep. Oh, it was cruel, heartless, treacherous &mdash; the thing he did after that.  When I was going away from the dance, he was there at my side &mdash; and he put me  into the wrong carriage &mdash; his own carriage &mdash; and when I had been driven a  little way from the hotel, the carriage stopped and he got in. I thought that  he was driving me home. I asked him how he could be cruel as to be with me, in  his own carriage, at the risk of my reputation &mdash; but he stopped me &mdash; shut my  lips with his fatal kiss. Oh, Martin, how can I tell these things? The horse  went almost at a gallop. I thought we should be killed. I was half fainting when  the carriage stopped at last, after rattling up and down hill &mdash; and he lifted  me out, and I felt the cold night-air on my face, the salt spray from the sea.  I tried to ask him where I was, &mdash; whether this was home &mdash; but the words died on  my lips &mdash; and I knew no more &mdash; knew no more till I woke from that dead, dull  swoon in the cabin of the <em>Vendetta</em>,  and heard the sailors calling out to each other, and saw Lostwithiel sitting by  my side &mdash; and then &mdash; and then &mdash; it was all one long dream &mdash; a dream of days and  nights, and rain, and tempest. I thought the boat was going down in that  dreadful night in the Bay of Biscay. Would to God that she had gone down, and  hidden me and my sin for ever! But she lived through the storm, and in the  morning she was anchored near Arcachon, and Lostwithiel went on shore, and sent  a woman in a boat, to bring me clothes, and to attend upon me; and I contrived  to go on shore with the woman when she went back in the boat that had brought  her, and I borrowed some money on my ring at a jeweller&rsquo;s in Arcachon, and I  left by the first train for Paris, and went on from Paris to London, and never  stopped to rest anywhere till I got home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God bring me face to face with that ruffian  who imposed upon your helplessness!&rdquo; cried Martin Disney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Martin; he was not a ruffian. He betrayed  me &mdash; but I loved him. He knew that I loved him. I was as great a sinner as he. I  was his before he stole me from my home &mdash; his in mind and in spirit. It was our  unhappy fate to love each other. And I forgave him, Martin. I forgave him on  that night of tempest, when I thought we were going to die together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect me to forgive him, do you? You  don&rsquo;t expect me to forgive the seducer who has ruined your life and mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His brother is your sister&rsquo;s husband, Martin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John Hulbert is good; he is frank and true. He  is not like the other. But oh, Martin, pity Lostwithiel and his sin, as you  pity me and my sin! It is past and done. I was mad when I cared for him &mdash; a  creature under a spell. You won my heart back to you by your goodness &mdash; you  made me more than ever your own. All that he had ever been to me &mdash; all that I  had ever thought or felt about him &mdash; was blotted out as if I had never seen his  face. Nothing remained but my love for you &mdash; and my guilty conscience, the  aching misery of knowing that I was unworthy of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her hand and pressed it gently in silence.  Then, after a long pause, when she had dried the tears from her streaming eyes,  and was lying faint, and white, and still, caring very little what became of  her poor remnant of life, he said softly &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgive you, Isola, as I pray God to forgive  you. I have spent some happy years with you &mdash; not knowing. If it was a  delusion, it was very sweet &mdash; while it lasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not a delusion,&rdquo; she cried, putting her  arms round his neck, in a sudden rapture at being pardoned. &ldquo;My love was real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened softly, and the kindly face of the  Anglican priest looked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen the lovers on their way to Florence,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;and have come to ask how Mrs. Disney is after her fatiguing morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am happier than I have been for a long time,&rdquo;  answered Isola, holding out her hand to him. &ldquo;I am prepared for the end, let it  come when it may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew what she meant, and that the sinner had  confessed her sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out for a stroll with me, Disney,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;and leave your wife to rest for a little while. I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll miss her  kind nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disney started up confusedly, like a sleeper  awakened, and looked at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I have a substitute ready to replace  Allegra by this time,&rdquo; he said, ringing the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the person from England arrived?&rdquo; he asked the  servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. She came a quarter of an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask her to come here at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Martin, you have not sent for a hospital  nurse, I hope,&rdquo; cried Isola, excitedly. &ldquo;Indeed I am not so bad as that. I want  very little help. I could not bear to have a stranger about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a stranger, Isola.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a modest knock at the door as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he said; and a familiar figure in a grey  merino gown and smart white cap with pink ribbons entered quietly and came to  the sofa where Isola was lying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tabitha!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re sorry to see an old face again,  Mrs. Disney. I told Mr. Martin that if you should ever be ill and want nursing  I&rsquo;d come to nurse you &mdash; if you were at the other end of the world &mdash; and Mr.  Martin wrote and told me you wanted an old servant&rsquo;s care and experience to get  you over your illness &mdash; and here I am. I&rsquo;ve come every inch of the way without  stopping, except at the buffets, and all I can say is Rome is a long way from  everywhere, and the country I&rsquo;ve come through isn&rsquo;t to be compared with  Cornwall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran on breathlessly as she seated herself by  that reclining figure with the waxen face. It may be that she talked to hide  the shock she had experienced on seeing the altered looks of the young mistress  whose roof she had left in the hour of shame. She had left her, refusing to  hold commune with one who had sinned so deeply. The faithful servant had taken  leave of her mistress in words that had eaten into Isola&rsquo;s heart, as if they  had been written there with a corrosive acid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry for you, Mrs. Disney,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;You are young and pretty, and you are very much to be pitied &mdash; and God knows I  have loved you as if you were my own flesh and blood. But I won&rsquo;t stay under  the roof of a wife who has brought shame upon herself and has dishonoured the  best of husbands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isola had denied nothing, had acknowledged nothing,  and had let Tabitha go. And now they met again for the first time after that  miserable parting, and the servant&rsquo;s eyes were full of pitying tears, and the  servant&rsquo;s lips spoke only gentlest words. What a virtue there must be in death,  when so much is forgiven to the dying!</p>
<p>Martin Disney went out with the priest, but at the  corner of the Piazza he stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isola&rsquo;s coughing fit has upset me more than it has  her,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not fit company for any one, so I think I&rsquo;ll go for a tramp  somewhere, and meet you later at dinner, when I&rsquo;ve recovered my spirits a  little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>A riverderci</em>,&rdquo;  said the priest, grasping his hand. &ldquo;I felicitate you upon this day&rsquo;s union; a  happy one, or I am no judge of men and women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Disney answered gloomily. &ldquo;The  woman is true as steel &mdash; the man comes of a bad stock. You know what the  Scripture says about the tree and the fruit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never was a race yet that was altogether  bad,&rdquo; said the priest. &ldquo;Virtues may descend from remote ancestors as well as  vices, &mdash; I think you told me moreover that Captain Hulbert&rsquo;s mother was a good  woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was. She was one of my mother&rsquo;s earliest and  dearest friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you should have a better opinion of her son.  If ever I met a thoroughly good fellow in my life, I believe I met one the day  I made Captain Hulbert&rsquo;s acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray God you may be right,&rdquo; said Disney, with a  sigh. &ldquo;I am no judge of character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned abruptly, and skirted the hill on his way  to the gardens of the Villa Borghese, where he found shade and seclusion in the  early afternoon. The carriages of fashionable Rome had not yet begun to drive  in at the gate. The cypress avenues, the groves of immemorial ilex, the verdant  lawns where the fountains leapt sunward, were peopled only by creatures of  fable, fixed in marble, faun and dryad, hero and god. Martin Disney plunged  into the shadow of one of those funereal avenues, and &mdash; while the sun blazed in  almost tropical splendour upon the open lawn in the far distance &mdash; he walked as  it were in the deep of night, a night whose gloom harmonized with that darker  night in his despairing heart.</p>
<p>Great God, how he had loved her! How he had looked  up to her, revering even her weakness as the expression of a childlike purity.  And while he had been praying for her, and dreaming of her, and longing for  her, and thinking of her as the very type of womanly chastity, unapproachable  by temptation, unassailable, secure in her innocence and simplicity as Athene  or Artemis with all their armour of defence; while he had so loved and trusted  her, she had flung herself into the arms of a profligate &mdash; as easily won as the  lightest wanton. She had done this thing, and then she had welcomed him, with  wan, sweet smiles, to his dishonoured home. She had made him drink the cup of  shame &mdash; a by-word it might be for the whole parish, as well as for that one man  who had dared to hint at evil. And yet he had forgiven her &mdash; forgiven one to  whom pardon meant only a peaceful ending; forgiven as a man holds himself  forgiven by an all-merciful God, as he hears words of pity and promise murmured  into his ear by the priest upon the scaffold, when the rope is round his neck  and the drop is ready to fall. How could he withhold such pardon when he had  been taught that God forgives the repentant murderer?</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
  &ldquo;Though Love And Life And Death Should Come And Go&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Isola was alone in the spacious Roman drawing-room,  its wide windows open to the soft, warm air. The sun was off that side of the  house now, and the Venetian shutters had been pushed back; and between the  heavy stone pillars of the loggia she saw the orange and magnolia trees in the  garden, and the pale gold of the mimosas beyond. The sun was shining full upon  the Hill of Gardens, that hill at whose foot Nero was buried in secret at dead  of night by his faithful freedman and the devoted woman who loved him to the  shameful end of the shameful life; that hill whose antique groves the wicked  C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s ghost had once made a place of terror. The wicked ghost was laid now.  Modern civilization had sent Nero the way of all phantoms; and fashionable Rome  made holiday on the Hill of Gardens. A military band was playing there this  afternoon in the golden light, and the familiar melodies in Don Giovanni were  wafted ever and anon in little gusts of sweetness to the loggia where the vivid  crimson of waxen camelias and the softer rose of oleander blossoms gave  brightness and colour to the dark foliage and the cold white stone.</p>
<p>Isola heard those far-off melodies faint in the  distance &mdash; heard without heeding. The notes were beyond measure familiar,  interwoven with the very fabric of her life, for those were the airs Martin  Disney loved, and she had played them to him nearly every evening in their  quiet, monotonous life. She heard, unheeding, for her thoughts had wandered  back to the night of the ball at Lostwithiel and all that went after it &mdash; the  fatal night that struck the death-knell of peace and innocence.</p>
<p>How vividly she remembered every detail &mdash; her  fluttering apprehensions during the long drive on the dark road, up hill and  down hill; her eagerness for the delight of the dance, as an unaccustomed  pleasure &mdash; a scene to which young beauty flies as the moth to the flame; her  remorseful consciousness that she had done wrong in yielding to the temptation  which drew her there; the longing to see Lostwithiel once more &mdash; Lostwithiel,  whom she had vowed to herself never to meet again of her own free will. She had  gone home that afternoon resolved to forego the ball, to make any social  sacrifice rather than look upon that man whose burning words of love, breathed  in her ear before she had enough of nerve or calmness to silence him, had left  her scathed and geared as if the lightning had blasted her. She had heard his  avowal. There was no room now to doubt the meaning of all that had gone before,  no ground now for believing in a tender, platonic admiration, lapping her round  with its soft radiance &mdash; a light, but not a fire. That which had burnt into her  soul to-day was the fierce flame of a dishonouring love, the bold avowal of a  lover who wanted to steal her from her husband, and make her a sinner before  her God.</p>
<p>She knew this much &mdash; had brooded upon it all the  evening &mdash; and yet she was going to a place where she must inevitably meet the  Tempter.</p>
<p>She was going because it was expedient to go;  because her persistent refusal to be there might give rise to guesses and  suspicions that would lead to a discovery of the real reason of her absence.  She had often seen the subtle process, the society search-light by which  Trelasco and Fowey could arrive at the innermost working of a neighbour&rsquo;s  heart, the deepest mysteries of motive.</p>
<p>She was going to the ball after all, fevered,  anxious, full of dim forebodings; and yet with an eager expectancy; and yet  with a strange over-mastering joy. How should she meet him? How could she avoid  him, without ostentatious avoidance, knowing how many eyes would be quick to  mark any deviation from conventional behaviour? Somehow or other she was  resolved to avoid all association with him; to get her programme filled before  he could ask her to dance; or to refuse in any case if he asked her. He would  scarcely venture to approach her after what had been said in the lane, when her  indignation had been plainly expressed with angry tears. No, he would hardly  dare. And so &mdash; in a vague bewilderment at finding she was at her journey&rsquo;s end  &mdash; she saw the lights of the little town close upon her, and in the next few  minutes her carriage was moving slowly in the rank of carriages setting down  their freight at the door of the inn.</p>
<p>Vaguely, as in a dream, she saw the lights and the  flowers, the satin gowns and the diamonds, the scarlet and white upon the  walls, brush and vizard, vizard and brush. He was not there. She looked along  the crowd, and that tall figure and that dark head were absent. She ought to  have been glad at this respite, and yet her heart grew heavy as lead.</p>
<p>Later he was there, and she was waltzing with him.  At the last moment when he was standing before her, cool, self-possessed, as it  were unconscious of that burning past, she had no more power to refuse to be  his partner than the bird has to escape from the snake. She had given him her  hand, and they were moving slowly, softly to the music of the soft, slow waltz.  Myosotis, myosotis &mdash; mystic flower which means everlasting remembrance! Would  she ever forget this night? Their last meeting &mdash; safest possible meeting-place  here in the shine of the lamps &mdash; in the sight of the multitude. Here she could  so easily hold him at a distance. Here she might speak to him lightly, as if  she too were unconscious of the past. Here she was safe against his madness and  her own weak unstable heart, which fluttered at his smallest word.</p>
<p>And so the night wore on, and she danced with him  more times than she could count, forgetting, or pretending to forget, other  engagements; going through an occasional waltz with another partner just for  propriety&rsquo;s sake, and hardly knowing who that partner was; knowing so well that  there was some one else standing against the wall, watching her every movement,  with the love-light in his eyes.</p>
<p>Then came the period after supper when they sat in  the ante-room and let the dances go by, hearing the music of waltzes which they  were to have danced together, hearing and heeding not. And then came a sudden  scare at the thought of the hour. Was it late?</p>
<p>Late, very late!</p>
<p>The discovery fluttered and unnerved her, and she  was scarcely able to collect her thoughts as he handed her into the carriage  and shut the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely it was a grey horse that brought me!&rdquo; she  exclaimed, and in the next minute she recognized Lostwithiel&rsquo;s brougham, the  same carriage in which she had been driven home through the rain upon that  unforgotten night when his house sheltered her, when she saw his face for the first  time.</p>
<p>Yes, it was his carriage. She knew the colour of  the lining, the little brass clock, the reading-lamp, the black panther rug.  She pulled at the check-string, but without effect. The carriage drove on,  slowly, but steadily, to the end of the town. She let down the window and  called to the coachman. There was only one man on the box, and he took no  notice of her call.</p>
<p>Yes, he had heard, perhaps, for he drew up his  horse suddenly by the road-side, a little way beyond the town. A man opened the  door and sprang in, breathless after running. It was Lostwithiel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put me into your carriage!&rdquo; she cried  distractedly. &ldquo;How could you make such a mistake? Pray tell him to go back to  the inn directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were driving along the country road at a rapid  pace, and he had seated himself by her side, clasping her hand. He pulled up  the window nearest her, and prevented her calling to the coachman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you go back? You will be home sooner  with my horse than with the screw that brought you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the fly will be waiting for me &mdash; the man will  wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him wonder. He won&rsquo;t wait very long, you may  be assured. He will guess what has happened. In the confusion of carriages you  took the wrong one. Isola, I am going to leave Cornwall to-night &mdash; to leave  England &mdash; perhaps never to return. Give me the last few moments of my life  here. Be merciful to me. I am going away &mdash; perhaps for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Are you really taking  me home? Is this the right way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is the right way. Do you suppose I am  going to drive you to London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He let down the glass suddenly, and pointed into  the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isola, do you see where we are? There&rsquo;s the  sign-post at the cross roads. There&rsquo;s the tower of Tywardreath Church, though  you can hardly see it in this dim light. Are you satisfied now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had drawn up the glass again. The windows were  clouded by the mist of their mingled breath; the atmosphere was faint with the  odour of the faded chrysanthemums on her gown and the carnation in the lapel of  his coat. All that she could see of the outer world was the blurred light of  the carriage lamps. The high-spirited horse was going up and down the hills at  a perilous pace. At this rate the journey could not take long.</p>
<p>And then &mdash; and then &mdash; he came back to the prayer he  had breathed in her ear more than twelve hours ago in the wintry lane. He loved  her, he loved her, he loved her! Could she refuse to go away with him &mdash; having  woven herself into his life, having made him madly, helplessly in love with  her? Could she refuse? Had any woman the right to refuse? He appealed to her  sense of honour. She had gone too far &mdash; she had granted too much already,  granting him her love. She was in his arms in the dim light, in the faint,  dream-like atmosphere. He was taking possession of her weak heart by all that  science of love in which he was past master. Honour, conscience, fidelity to  the absent, piety, innocence were being swept away in that lava flood of  passion. Helpless, irresolute, she faltered again and again. &ldquo;Take me home, Lostwithiel!  Have mercy! Take me home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped those tremulous lips with a kiss &mdash; the  kiss that betrays. The carriage dashed down a steep hill, rattled along a  street so narrow that the wheels seemed to grind against the house-fronts on  each side, down hill again, and then the horse was pulled up suddenly in a  stony square, and the door opened, and the soft, fresh sea-breeze blew among  her loosened hair, and upon her uncovered neck, and she heard the gentle  plish-plash of a boat moored against the quay at her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not home!&rdquo; she cried piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is home, love, our home for a little while  &mdash; the home that can carry us to the other end of the world, if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quay, and the water, and the few faint lights  here and there grew dark, and she knew no more, till she heard the sailors  crying, &ldquo;Yeo, heave, yeo,&rdquo; and the heavy sails flapping, and the creak of the  boom as it swayed in the wind, and felt the dancing motion of the boat as she  cut her way through the waves, felt the strong arm that clasped her, and heard  the low, fond voice that murmured in her ear, &ldquo;Isola, Isola, forgive me! I  could not live without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That which came afterwards had seemed one long and  lurid dream &mdash; a dream of fair weather and foul; of peril and despair; of passionate,  all-conquering love.</p>
<p>To-day, as she lay supine in the afternoon silence  &mdash; lying as Tabitha had left her, in a fevered sleep &mdash; the vision of that past  came back upon her in all its vivid colouring, almost as distinctly as it had  re-acted itself in her hours of delirium, when she had lived that tragic  chapter of her life over again, and had felt the fury of the waves and breathed  the chill, salt air of the tempest-driven sea, and had seen the moon riding  high amidst the cloud-chaos &mdash; now appearing, now vanishing, as if she too were  a storm-driven bark in a raging sea.</p>
<p>Oh God! how vividly those hours came back! The  awful progress from Ushant to Arcachon; the darkness of the brief day; the  horror of the long night; the shuddering yacht, with straining spars, and  broadside beaten by a heaving mass of water, that struck her with the force of  a thousand battering-rams, blow after blow, each blow seeming as if the next  must always be the last &mdash; the final crash and end of all things. The pretty,  dainty vessel, long and narrow, rode like an eggshell on those furious waters &mdash;  here a long wall of inky blackness, rising like a mountain-ridge, and bearing  down on the doomed ship, and beyond, as far as the eye could reach, a waste of  surf, livid in the moonlight. What helpless insignificance, as of a leaf tossed  on a whirlpool, when that mountainous mass took the yacht and lifted her on  cyclopean shoulders, and shook her off again into the black trough of the sea,  as into the depths of hell! And this not once only, nor a hundred times only,  but on through that endless-seeming night, on in the sickly winter dawn and in  the faint yellow gleam of a rainy noontide &mdash; on through day that seemed mixed  and entangled with night, as if the beginning of creation had come round again,  and the light were not yet divided from the darkness.</p>
<p>Oh, those passionate, never-to-be-forgotten  moments, when she had stood with him at the top of the companion, looking out  upon those livid waters; fondly believing that each moment was to be their last;  that the gates of death were opening yonder &mdash; a watery way, a gulf to which  they must go down, in a moment, in a little moment, in a flash, in a breath, at  the next, or the next, or the next mad plunge of that hurrying bark. Yes, death  was there, in front of them &mdash; inevitable, imminent, immediate &mdash; and life and  sin, shame, remorse, were done with, along with the years that lay behind them,  a page blotted and blurred with one passionate madness, which had changed the  colour of a woman&rsquo;s life. She knew not how she bore up against the force of  that tempest; clinging to him with her bare, wet arms; held up by him;  crouching against the woodwork, which shook and rattled with every blow of the  battering-rams. She only knew that his arms were round her, that she was safe  with him, even when the leaping surf rose high above her head, wrapping her  round like a mantle, blinding, drowning her in a momentary extinction. She only  knew that his lips were close to her ear, and that in a momentary lull of those  awful voices he murmured, &ldquo;We are going to die, Isola! The boat cannot live  through such a storm! We shall go down to death together!&rdquo; And her lips turned  to him with a joyful cry, &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; Then again, in a minute&rsquo;s interval, he  pleaded, &ldquo;Forgive me, love; my stolen love, forgive me before we die!&rdquo; And  again, &ldquo;Was it a crime, Isola?&rdquo; &ldquo;If it was, I forgive you!&rdquo; she whispered,  clinging to him as the blast struck them.</p>
<p>Cruel revulsion of feeling, bitter irony of Fate,  when the great grim waves &mdash; which had seemed like living monsters hurrying down  upon them with malignant fury to tear and to devour &mdash; when the awful sea began  to roar with a lesser voice, and the thunder of the battering-rams had a duller  sound, and the bows of the yacht no longer plunged straight down into the  leaden-coloured pit; no longer climbed those inky ridges with such blind  impetus, as of a cockle-shell in a whirlpool. Bitter sense of loss and dismay  when the grey, cold dawn lighted a quieter sea, and she heard the captain  telling Lostwithiel that they had seen the worst of the storm, and that there  was no fear now. He was going to put on more canvas: and hadn&rsquo;t the lady better  go below, where it was warm. She needn&rsquo;t feel anyway nervous now. They would  soon be in the roadstead of Arcachon.</p>
<p>She had not felt the chill change from night to  morning. She had not felt the surf that drenched her loose, entangled hair. She  hardly knew when or how Lostwithiel had wrapped her in his fur-lined coat; but  she found that she was so enveloped presently when she stumbled and staggered  down to the cabin, and flung herself face downward upon the sofa, in a paroxysm  of impotent despair.</p>
<p>Death would have delivered her. The tempest was her  friend; and the tempest had passed her by, and left her lying there like a weed,  more worthless than any weed that ever the sea cast up to rot upon the barren  rocks. Yes, she was left there; left in a life that sin had blighted; loathsome  to herself, hateful to her God.</p>
<p>She locked herself in the cabin, while the hurrying  footsteps overhead told her that Lostwithiel was working with the sailors.</p>
<p>An hour later, and he was at the cabin door,  pleading for one kind word, entreating her to let him see her, were it only for  a few moments, to know that she was not utterly broken down by the peril she  had passed through. He pleaded in vain. She would give no answer &mdash; she would  speak no word. Indeed, in that dull agony of shame and despair it seemed to her  as if a dumb devil had entered into her. Her parched lips seemed to have lost  the power of speech. She lay there, staring straight before her at all the  swinging things on the cedar panel &mdash; the books and photographs &mdash; and lamps and  frivolities, vibrating with every movement of the sea. Her hands were clenched  until the nails cut into the flesh. Her heart was throbbing with a dull, slow  beat that made itself torturingly audible. Did God create His creatures for  such agony? Had she been foredoomed everlastingly &mdash; in that awful  incomprehensible ante-natal Eternity &mdash; foredoomed to this fallen state, to this  unutterable shame?</p>
<p>Hours went by, she knew not how. Again and again  Lostwithiel came to her door, and talked and entreated &mdash; Heaven knows how  tenderly &mdash; with what deep contrition, with what fond pleading for pardon. But  the dumb devil held her still. She wrapped herself in a sullen despair &mdash; not  anger, for anger is active. Hers was only a supine resistance.</p>
<p>At last she heard him come with one of the sailors,  and she could make out from their whispering talk that they were going to force  open the door. Then she started up in a fury, and went and flung herself  against the cedar panels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t leave me alone in my misery I will  kill myself!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>The long night was over; and the sun was high. It  seemed as if they were sailing over a summer sea, and through the scuttle port  she saw a little foreign town nestling under the shelter of pine-clad hills.</p>
<p>She woke from brief and troubled slumbers to see  this smiling shore, and at first she fancied they must have sailed back to  Cornwall, and that this was some unknown bay upon that rock-bound coast; but  the sapphire sea and the summer-like sunshine suggested a fairer clime than  rugged Britain.</p>
<p>While she was looking out at the crescent-shaped  bay, and the long line of white villas, the anchor was being lowered. The sea  was almost as smooth as a lake, and those tranquil waters had the colour and  the sheen of sapphire and emerald. She thought of the jasper sea &mdash; the sea of  the Apocalypse, the tideless sea beside that land of the New Jerusalem where there  are no more tears, where there can be no more sin, a city of ransomed souls,  redeemed from all earth&rsquo;s iniquity.</p>
<p>A boat was being lowered. She heard the scroop of  the ropes in the davits; she heard footsteps on the accommodation-ladder, and  then the dip of oars, and presently the boat passed between her and the sunlit  waters, and she saw Lostwithiel sitting in the stern, with the rudder-lines in  his hands, while two sailors were bending to their oars, with wind-blown hair  and cheery, smiling faces, broad and red in the gay morning sunshine.</p>
<p>He was gone, and she breathed more freely. There  was a sense of release in his absence; and for the first time she looked round  the cabin, where beautiful and luxurious things lay, thrown here and there in  huddled masses of brilliant colour. A Japanese screen, a masterpiece of  rainbow-hued embroidery on a sea-green ground, flung against the panelling at  one end &mdash; Persian curtains wrenched from their fastenings and hanging awry &mdash;  satin pillows that had drifted into a heap in one corner &mdash; signs of havoc  everywhere. She stood in the midst of all this ruin, and looked at her own  reflection in a Venetian glass riveted to the panelling, about the only object  that had held its place through the storm.</p>
<p>Her own reflection. Was that really herself, that  ghastly image which the glass gave back to her? The reflection of a woman with  livid cheeks and blanched lips, with swollen eyelids, and dark rings of purple  round the haggard eyes, and hair rough and tangled as Medusa&rsquo;s locks, and bare  shoulders from which the stained satin bodice had slipped away. Her  wedding-gown! Could that defiled garment &mdash; the long folds of the once shining  satin, draggled and dripping with sea-water &mdash; could these tawdry rags be the  wedding-gown she had put on in her proud and happy innocence in the old bedroom  at Dinan, with mother, and servants, and a useful friend or two helping and  hindering?</p>
<p>Oh, if they could see her now, those old friends of  her unclouded childhood, the mother and father who had loved and trusted her,  who had never spoken of evil things in her hearing, had never thought that sin  could come near her! And she had fallen like the lowest of womankind. She had  forfeited her place among the virtuous and happy for ever. She, Martin Disney&rsquo;s  wife! That good man, that brave soldier who had fought for Queen and country &mdash;  it was his wife who stood there in her shame, haggard and dishevelled!</p>
<p>She flung her arms above her head and wrung her  hands in a paroxysm of despair. Then, with a little cry, she plucked at the  loose wild tresses as if she would have torn them from her head; and then she  threw herself upon the cabin floor in her agony, and grovelled there, a  creature for whom death would have been a merciful release.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could die &mdash; if I could but die, and no one  know!&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
<p>She lifted herself up again upon her knees, and,  with one hand upon the floor, looked round the walls of the cabin &mdash; looked at a  trophy of Moorish and Italian arms which decorated the panelling, searching for  some sharp dagger with which she might take her hated life. And then came the  thought of what must follow death, not for her in the dim incomprehensible  eternity, but for those who loved her on earth, for those who would have to be  told how she had been found, in her draggled wedding-gown, stabbed by her own  hand on board Lord Lostwithiel&rsquo;s yacht. What a story of shame and crime for  newspapers to embellish, and for scandal-lovers to gloat over! No! She dared  not destroy herself thus. She must collect her senses, escape from her seducer,  and keep the secret of her dishonour.</p>
<p>She took off her gown, and rolled train and bodice  into a bundle as small as she could make them. Then she looked about the cabin  for some object with which to weight her bundle. Yes, that would do. A little  brass dolphin that was used to steady the open door. That was heavy enough,  perhaps. She put it into the middle of her bundle, tied a ribbon tightly round  the whole, and then she opened the scuttle port and dropped her wedding-garment  into the sea. The keen fresh wind, the wind from pine-clad hills and distant  snow mountains, blew in upon her bare neck and chilled her; but it helped to  cool the fever of her mind, and she sat down and leant her head upon her  clasped hands, and tried to think what she must do to free herself from the  toils in which guilty love had caught her.</p>
<p>She must escape from the yacht. She must go back to  England &mdash; somehow.</p>
<p>She thought that if she were to appeal to  Lostwithiel&rsquo;s honour some spark of better feeling would prevail over that  madness which had wrecked her, and he would let her go, he would take her back  to England, and facilitate her secret return to the home she had dishonoured.  But could she trust herself to make that appeal? Could she stand fast against  his pleading, if he implored her to stay with him, to live the life that he had  planned for her, the life that he had painted so eloquently, the dreamy,  beautiful life amidst earth&rsquo;s most romantic scenes, the life of love in  idleness? Could she resist him if he should plead &mdash; it might be with tears &mdash;  he, whom she adored, her destroyer and her divinity? No, she must leave the  yacht before he came back to her. But how?</p>
<p>There were only men on board. There was no woman to  whose compassion she could appeal, no woman to lend her clothes to cover her.  She saw herself once again in the Venetian glass, in her long trained petticoat  of muslin and lace, so daintily fresh when she dressed for the ball &mdash; muslin  and lace soddened by the sea, torn to shreds where her feet had caught in the  flounces as she stumbled down the companion during last night&rsquo;s storm. A  fitting costume in which to travel from Arcachon to London, verily! She opened  a door leading to an inner cabin, which contained bed and bath, and all toilet  appliances. Hanging against the wall there were three dressing-gowns, the  lightest and least masculine of the three being a robe of Indian camel&rsquo;s hair,  embroidered with gray silk &mdash; a shapeless garment with loose sleeves and a  girdle.</p>
<p>Here, within locked doors, she made her hurried  toilet, with much cold water. She brushed her long, ragged hair with one of the  humblest of the brushes. She would not take so much as a few drops from the  great crystal bottle of eau de Cologne which was held in a silver frame  suspended from the ceiling. Nothing of his would she touch, nothing belonging  to the man who wanted to pour his fortune into her lap, to make his life her  life, his estate her estate, his name her name, could she but survive the  ordeal of the divorce court, and shake off old ties.</p>
<p>She rolled her hair in a large coil at the back of  her head. She put on the camel&rsquo;s hair dressing-gown, and tied the girdle round  her long, slim waist, and having done this she looked altogether a different  creature from that vision of haggard shame which she had seen just now with  loathing. She had a curious Puritan air in her sad coloured raiment, and  braided hair.</p>
<p>Scarcely had she finished when she heard the dip of  oars, and looking out in an agony of horror at the apprehension of  Lostwithiel&rsquo;s return, she saw a boat laden with two big milliner&rsquo;s baskets, and  with a woman sitting in the stem. The men who were rowing this boat were not of  the crew of the <em>Vendetta</em>.</p>
<p>She had not long to wonder. She unlocked her door,  and went into the adjoining cabin, while the boat came alongside, and woman and  baskets were hauled upon the deck.</p>
<p>Three minutes afterwards the cabin-boy knocked at  her door, and told her that there was a person from Arcachon to see her, a  dressmaker with things that had been ordered for her.</p>
<p>She unlocked the door, for the first time since she  locked it at dawn, and found herself face to face with a smiling young person,  whose black eyes and olive complexion were warm with the glow of the south,  golden in the eyes, carnation on the plump, oval cheeks.</p>
<p>This young person had the honour to bring the  trousseau which Monsieur had sent for Madame&rsquo;s inspection. Monsieur had told  her how sadly inconvenienced Madame had been by the accident by which all her  luggage had been left upon the quay at the moment of sailing. In truth it must  have been distressing for Madame, as it had evidently been distressing for  Monsieur in his profound sympathy with Madame, his wife. In the meantime she,  the young person, had complied with Monsieur&rsquo;s orders, and had brought all that  there was of the best and most delicate and refined for Madame&rsquo;s gracious  inspection.</p>
<p>The cabin-boy brought in the two baskets, which the  milliner opened with an air, taking out the delicate lingerie, the soft silk  and softer cashmere &mdash; peignoirs, frilled petticoats, a fluff and flutter of  creamy lace and pale satin ribbons, transforming simplest garments into things  of beauty. She spread out her wares, chattering all the while, and then looked  at Madame for approval.</p>
<p>Isola scarcely glanced at all the finery. She  pointed to the only plain walking-gown among all the delicate prettinesses, the  silks and cashmeres and laces &mdash; a grey tweed tailor-gown, with no adornment  except a little narrow black braid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will keep that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and one set of  under-linen, the plainest. You can take all the rest of the things back to your  shop. Please help me to dress as quickly as you can &mdash; I want to go on shore in  the boat that takes you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Madame, Monsieur insisted that I should bring  a complete trousseau. He wished Madame to supply herself with all things  needful for a long cruise in the south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was mistaken. My luggage is safe enough. I  shall have it again in a few days. I only want clothes to wear for a day or  two. Kindly do what I ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her tone was so authoritative that the milliner  complied, reluctantly, and murmuring persuasive little speeches while she  assisted Madame to dress. All that she had brought was of the most new &mdash;  expressly arrived from Paris, from one of the most distinguished establishments  in the Rue de la Paix. Fashions change so quickly &mdash; and the present fashions  were so enchanting, so original. She must be pardoned if she suggested that  nothing in Madame&rsquo;s wardrobe could be so new or so elegant as these latest  triumphs of an artistic <em>faiseur</em>.  Madame took no heed of her eloquence, but hurried through the simple toilet,  insisted upon all the finery being replaced in the two baskets, and then went  upon deck with the milliner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going on shore to his lordship,&rdquo; she said,  with quiet authority, to the captain.</p>
<p>It was a deliberate lie &mdash; the first she had told,  but not the last she would have to tell.</p>
<p>She landed on the beach at Arcachon &mdash; penniless,  but with a diamond ring on her wedding finger &mdash; her engagement ring &mdash; which she  knew, by a careless admission of Martin Disney&rsquo;s, to have cost fifty pounds.  She left the milliner, and went into the little town, dreading to meet  Lostwithiel at every step. She found a complacent jeweller who was willing to  advance twenty-five Napoleons upon the ring, and promised to return it to her  on the receipt of that sum, with only a bagatelle of twenty francs for  interest, since Madame would redeem her pledge almost immediately.</p>
<p>Furnished with this money she drove straight to the  station, and waited there in the most obscure corner she could find till the  first train left for Bordeaux. At Bordeaux she had a long time to wait, still  in hiding, before the express left for Paris &mdash; and then came the long, lonely  journey &mdash; from Bordeaux to Paris &mdash; from Paris to London &mdash; from London to  Trelasco. It seemed an endless pilgrimage, a nightmare dream of dark night and  wintry day, made hideous by the ceaseless throb of the engine, the perpetual  odour of sulphur and smoke. She reached Trelasco somehow, and sank exhausted in  Tabitha&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What day is it?&rdquo; she asked faintly, looking round  the familiar room, as if she had never seen it before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thursday, ma&rsquo;am. You have been away ten days,&rdquo; the  old servant answered coldly.</p>
<p>It was only the next day that Tabitha told her  mistress she must leave her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need to talk about what has happened,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;I have kept your secret. I have let no one know that you were away.  I packed Susan off for a holiday the morning after the ball. I don&rsquo;t believe  any one knows anything about you &mdash; unless you were seen yesterday on your way  home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came stern words of renunciation, a  conscientious but rather narrow-minded woman&rsquo;s protest against sin.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
  &ldquo;I, You, And God Can Comprehend Each Other&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It was two months after Allegra&rsquo;s wedding-day, and  Martin Disney had been warned that the closing hour of the young life he had  watched so tenderly was not far off. It might come to-morrow; or it might not  come for a week; or the lingering flame might go flickering on, fainting and  reviving in the socket, for another month. He must hold himself prepared for  the worst. Death might come suddenly at the last, like a thief in the night; or  by stealthy, gradual steps, and slowest progress from life to clay.</p>
<p>He sat beside Isola&rsquo;s sofa in the Roman lodging as  he had sat beside her bed in that long illness at Trelasco, when her wandering  mind appalled him more than her bodily weakness. He watched as faithfully as he  had watched then, but this time without hope.</p>
<p>Father Rodwell had been with her at seven o&rsquo;clock  upon the last three mornings, and had administered the sacrament to her and to  her husband, and to the faithful Tabitha, one with them in piety and love. The  priest thought that each celebration would be the last; but she rallied a  little as the day wore on, and lived till sunset; lived through the long  painful night; and another day dawned, and he found her waiting for him in the  morning, ready to greet him with her pale smile when he appeared upon the  threshold of her room, after going up the staircase in saddest apprehension,  dreading to hear that all was over, except the funeral service and the funeral  bell.</p>
<p>She insisted upon getting up and going into the  drawing-room, feeble as she was. Tabitha was so handy and so helpful that the  fatigue of an invalid&rsquo;s toilet was lightened to the uttermost. Tabitha and the  colonel carried her from the bedroom to the drawing-room upon her couch, and  carried the couch back to the bedside in the evening. Before noon she was lying  in the sunlit salon, surrounded with flowers and photographs and books and  newspapers, and all things that lighten the monotonous hours of sickness.</p>
<p>Nor was companionship ever wanting. Martin Disney  devoted himself to her with an unfailing patience. Upon no pretence would he  leave her for more than half an hour at a time &mdash; just the space of a walk to  the Hill of Gardens, or the length of the Via de&rsquo; Condotti and the Corso; just  the space of a cigar in the loggia.</p>
<p>He read to her, he talked to her, he waited upon  her. Tabitha and he were her only nurses; for L&ouml;ttchen was a young woman of  profound concentration of motive, and had early taken unto herself the motto,  One baby, one nurse. She conscientiously performed her duty to her infant  charge; but she rarely lifted a finger to help any one else.</p>
<p>It was drawing towards the end of July; the weather  had been lovely hitherto &mdash; hot, and very hot, but not insupportable for those  who could afford to dawdle and sleep away their mid-day and afternoon existence  &mdash; who had horses to carry them about in the early mornings, and a carriage to  drive them in moonlit gardens and picturesque places. In the suburbs of the  great city, across the arid Campagna yonder, at Tivoli, and Frascati, and  Albano, and Castel Gandolfo, people had been revelling in the summer, living  under Jove&rsquo;s broad roof, with dancing and sports, and music and feasting, and  rustic, innocent kisses, snatched amidst the darkness of groves whose only  lamps are fireflies &mdash; deep woods of ilex, where the nightingale sings long and late,  and the grasshopper trills his good night through the perfumed herbage.</p>
<p>Here, in Rome, the heat was more oppressive, and  the splashing of the city&rsquo;s many fountains was the only relief from the glare  and dazzle of the piazzas, the whiteness of the great blocks of houses in the  new streets and boulevards. Blinds were lowered, and shops were shut, in the  blinding noontide heat, and through the early afternoon the eternal city was  almost as silent and reposeful as the sleeping beauty &mdash; to awaken at sundown to  movement, and life, and music, and singing, in lighted streets and crowded  cafes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the dim grey of the morning, the  slumberous calm of summer changed to howling wind and tropical rain &mdash;  torrential rain, that filled every gutter, and splashed from every housetop,  and ran in wild cascades from every alley on the steep hillsides. The Campagna  was one vast lake, illumined with flashes of lightning, and the thunder pealed  and reverberated along the lofty parapets of the ruined aqueducts. The tall  cypresses in the Pincian Gardens bent like saplings before that mighty wind,  which seemed to howl and shriek its loudest as it came tearing down from the  hill to whistle and rave among the housetops in the Piazza di Spagna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think the ghost of Nero were shrieking  in the midst of the tempest,&rdquo; said Isola, as she listened to the fitful sobbing  of the wind late in the dull grey afternoon, while her husband and Father  Rodwell sat near her couch, keeping up that sad pretence of cheerfulness which  love struggles to maintain upon the very edge of the grave &mdash; the brokenhearted  make-believe of those who know that death waits at the door. &ldquo;There comes a  shrill cry every now and then like the scream of a wicked spirit in pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rome is full of ghosts,&rdquo; answered the priest, &ldquo;but  there are the shadows of the good and the great as well as of the wicked.  Walking alone in twilight on the Aventine, I should hardly be surprised to meet  the spirit of Gregory the Great wandering amidst the scenes of his saintly life;  nor do I ever go into the Pantheon at dusk without half expecting to see the  shade of Raffaelle. And there are others &mdash; some I knew in the flesh &mdash; Wiseman  and Antonelli, Gibson, the sculptor, consummate artist and gentlest of men &mdash;  yes, Rome is full of the shadows of the good and the wise. One can afford to  put up with Nero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean me to think that you believe in  ghosts?&rdquo; asked Isola, deeply interested.</p>
<p>It was only five o&rsquo;clock, yet the sky was grey with  the greyness of late evening. Here in this land of sunshine there had been all  day long the brooding gloom of storm-clouds, and a sky that was dark as winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t analyze my own feelings on the subject; I  will quote the words of a man at whose feet it was my happiness to sit  sometimes when I was a lad at Oxford. Canon Mozley has not shrunk from facing  the great problem of spiritual life in this world &mdash; of an invisible  after-existence upon the earth when the body is dust. &lsquo;Is the mother of our  Lord now existing?&rsquo; he asks, and answers, &lsquo;Yes. I believe that all fathers,  mothers, sons, and daughters are now existing. Nature has disposed of their  bodies as far as we can trace her work; but their souls remain. So I read in  Homer, in Virgil, and in the New Testament. This existence I am permitted to believe  is a conscious and active existence.&rsquo; Canon Mozley, the man who wrote those  words, and much more in the same strain, was not an idle visionary. If he could  afford to believe in the presence of the dead among us, why, so can I. And I  believe that Gregory the Great has whispered at the ear of many a Holy Father  in the long line of his successors, and has influenced many a Cardinal&rsquo;s vote,  and has been an invisible power in many a council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to believe in ghosts,&rdquo; said Isola, gently.  &ldquo;But I thank God those that I love are still in this life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out her hand with a curiously timid  gesture to her husband, who clasped it tenderly, bending his lips to kiss the  pale thin fingers. Oh, Death, pity and pardon are so interwoven with thine  image that neither pride nor anger has any force against thy softening  influence. She had been false. She had wronged him and dishonoured herself,  cruelly, cruelly, most cruelly; but she had suffered and repented, and she was  passing away from him. Let the broken spirit pass in peace!</p>
<p>That day wore itself out in storm and tempest, and  the night came on like a fierce death-struggle; and the wind raved and shrieked  at intervals all through the night; and again next day there were gloom and  darkness, and a sky heaped up with masses of lead-coloured cloud; and again the  torrential rain streamed from the housetops and splashed in the streets below;  a dreary day to be endured even by the healthy and the happy &mdash; a day of painful  oppression for an invalid. Isola&rsquo;s spirits sank to the lowest depth, and for  the first time since Allegra&rsquo;s marriage she talked hopelessly of their  separation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could only see her once more before I die,&rdquo;  she sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear love, you shall see her as soon as the  railway can bring her here. Remember, it is you who have forbidden me to send  for her. You know how dearly she loves you &mdash; how willingly she would come to  you. I&rsquo;ll telegraph to her within half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; Isola protested hurriedly. &ldquo;No, we  can never meet again in this world. I took my farewell of her in the church. I  meant it to be farewell. I was very happy for her sake when I saw her married  to the man she loved. It was a selfish repining that made me ask for her just  now. I would not have her summoned here for worlds. She is so happy at Venice &mdash;  happy in her honeymoon dream. Tell her nothing, Martin &mdash; nothing till you can  tell her that my days have ended peacefully. She has borne her burden for me in  the past. I want her to be free from all care about me &mdash; but not to forget me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will not forget, Isola. She loves you fondly  and truly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am sure of that. She was dearer to me than  my own sister &mdash; cared for me much more than Gwendolen ever cared, though Gwen  and I were always good friends. Poor feather-headed Gwen! She writes me  affectionate letters, hoping she may get to Italy in the autumn, though it is  impossible for her to come just now. And mother and father write to me just in  the same way &mdash; mother regretting that her health won&rsquo;t allow her to leave  Dinan; father hoping to see me in the autumn. Their letters are full of  hopefulness,&rdquo; she concluded, with a faint touch of irony.</p>
<p>Her husband read to her for the greater part of the  long gloomy day. He read St. Thomas &agrave; Kempis for some part of the time. The  book had been on the little table by her side throughout her illness. He read  two or three of Frederick Robertson&rsquo;s sermons, and for occasional respite from  too serious thought he read her favourite poems &mdash; Adona&iuml;s, Alastor, and some of  Shelley&rsquo;s lovely lyrics, and those passages in Childe Harold which had acquired  a new charm for her since she had grown familiar with Rome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read to me about Venice,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and let me  think of Allegra and Captain Hulbert. I love to fancy them gliding along those  narrow, picturesque streets, in the great, graceful, ponderous gondola I  remember so well. It is so nice to know of their happiness &mdash; and to know that  they need never be parted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the long summer day &mdash; without the glow and glory  of summer &mdash; wore on, and except for her excessive languor and feebleness there  were no indications that the patient&rsquo;s state was any worse than it had been for  some weeks. The doctor came late in the afternoon, and felt her pulse, and  talked to her a little; but it was easy to see that his visit was only a  formula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have such an excellent nurse, Mrs. Disney,  that I consider my position almost a sinecure,&rdquo; he said, smiling at the  faithful Tabitha, who stood waiting for his instructions, and who never forgot  the minutest detail.</p>
<p>Tabitha came in from the adjoining bedroom every  now and then, and adjusted the pillows on the sofa, and sprinkled eau de  Cologne, or fanned the invalid with a large Japanese fan, or arranged the  silken coverlet over her feet, or brought her some small refreshment in the way  of a cup of soup or jelly, and tenderly coaxed and assisted her to take it,  talking just as much or as little as seemed prudent, always careful neither to  fatigue nor excite her charge.</p>
<p>It was between eight and nine in the evening, and  there was a gloomy twilight in the loggia, and in the garden beyond. The wind  which had dropped in the afternoon had begun to rage again, as if not only Nero  but all the wicked emperors were abroad in the air.</p>
<p>Isola had begged that one of the windows might be  opened, in spite of the tempestuous weather; and the cold damp breath of the  storm crept into the room and chilled Martin Disney as he sat by his wife&rsquo;s  sofa, reading a London paper that had come by the evening post.</p>
<p>The only artificial light in the room was a  reading-lamp at the colonel&rsquo;s elbow, shaded from the draught by the four-leaved  screen which protected the invalid. The gloomy grey daylight had not quite  faded, and through the half-open door opposite him Martin Disney saw the white  marble wall of the staircase, and some oleanders in stone vases that stood on  the spacious landing.</p>
<p>He had been reading to Isola nearly all day. He was  reading to himself now, trying to forget his own grief in the consideration of  a leading article which prophecied a European war, and the ultimate extinction  of English influence in continental politics.</p>
<p>There was perfect stillness in the room. Isola had  been lying with closed eyes a little time before, and he fancied that she was  sleeping.</p>
<p>The silence had lasted for nearly an hour, broken  only by the shriek of the wind, and by the chiming of the quarters from the  Church of La Trinit&agrave; de&rsquo; Monti, when Colonel Disney was startled by his wife&rsquo;s  hand clutching his arm, and his wife&rsquo;s agitated whisper sounding close to his  ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martin! Did you see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had lifted herself into a sitting position, she  who had not been able to sit up for many days past.</p>
<p>The hectic bloom had faded from her cheeks and left  them ashy pale. Her eyes seemed almost starting from her head, straining their  gaze as if to penetrate the deepening shadows on the landing beyond the  half-open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My love, you have been dreaming,&rdquo; said Disney,  soothing her with womanly gentleness. &ldquo;Lie down again, my poor dear. See, let  me arrange the pillows and make you quite comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! I was not dreaming. I have not been  asleep. He was there. I saw him as plainly as I see you. He pushed the door a  little further open and looked in at me. I saw his face in the lamplight, very  pale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disney glanced at the door involuntarily. Yes, the  aperture was certainly wider than when he looked at it last; just as if some  one&rsquo;s hand had pushed the door a little further back. The hand of the wind, no  doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl, believe me, you were dreaming. No  one could have approached that doorway without my hearing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been lying awake thinking all the time you  have been reading your paper, Martin. I never had less inclination to sleep. I  know that he was there looking in at me, with a smile upon his pale face. But  he has gone. Thank God, he has gone! Only I can&rsquo;t help wondering how he came  there, without our hearing his step upon the stone stair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it, Isola?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew what the answer would be. He thought her  mind was wandering, and he knew there was only one image which could so agitate  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lostwithiel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A delusion, Isa. Lord Lostwithiel is far away from  Rome. Come, dear love, let me read to you again, and let us have our good  Tabitha in to cheer you with a cup of tea, and to brighten up the room a  little. We have been growing low-spirited under the influence of the gloomy  weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went out of the room on pretence of summoning  Tabitha, and having sent her to watch beside his wife, he ran quickly  downstairs to find out if the street door were open or closed. The door was shut  and bolted. The servants on the ground floor had not opened the door to any one  after five o&rsquo;clock. There was no possibility of any stranger having entered the  house since that hour.</p>
<p>The end came that night, with an appalling  suddenness. Isola had refused to be carried back to her bedroom at the usual  time. She seemed to have a horror of going back to that room, as if the shadows  lurking there were full of fear. Even Father Rodwell&rsquo;s presence, which  generally had a soothing effect upon her nerves and spirits, failed to comfort  her to-night. She refused to lie in her usual position, and insisted upon  sitting up, supported by pillows, facing the doorway at which her fancy had  evoked Lostwithiel&rsquo;s image. She would not allow the door to be shut, and there  was the same strained look in her too brilliant eyes all the evening.</p>
<p>Father Rodwell read aloud to her, continuing a  history of St. Cecilia, in which she had been warmly interested; but to-night  he could see that her thoughts were not with the book. He read on all the same,  hoping that the sound of his voice might lull her to sleep. The wind had gone  down as the night advanced, and the stars were shining in the strip of sky  above the Pincian Gardens. Colonel Disney was pacing up and down the loggia,  smoking his pipe in the cool darkness &mdash; full of saddest apprehensions.</p>
<p>Her mind had been wandering, surely, when she had  that fancy about Lostwithiel, he told himself. It was something more than a  dream. And then he remembered those long nights of delirium after her boy was  born &mdash; and above all, that one night, when she had fancied herself at sea in a  storm, when she had tried to fling herself overboard. He knew now what scene  she had re-acted in that delirium, what the vision was which a mind distraught  had conjured out of empty darkness.</p>
<p>The priest left them before eleven o&rsquo;clock, and  Martin Disney sat with his wife till long after midnight &mdash; Tabitha waiting  quietly in the next room &mdash; before he could persuade her to go to bed. Isola was  more wakeful than usual &mdash; though her slumbers had been much broken of late &mdash;  and there was a restlessness about her which impressed her husband as a sign of  evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the storm over?&rdquo; she asked, by-and-by, with her  face turned towards the loggia and the starlight above the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearest, all is calm now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the boy?&rdquo; she said, suddenly looking up at the  ceiling above which the child slept with his nurse. &ldquo;He is asleep, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so. I went upstairs at nine o&rsquo;clock, while  Father Rodwell was reading to you, and gave him my goodnight kiss. He was fast  asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether he will ever think of me when he  is a man?&rdquo; she said musingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you doubt that? You will be his most sacred  memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;he will never know &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentence remained unfinished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you carry me to my bed, Martin? The room  begins to grow dark,&rdquo; she whispered faintly. &ldquo;I can hardly see your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted the wasted form in his arms, and carried  her with tenderest care into the next room, and to the pure white bed which had  been made ready for her, the long net curtains parted, the coverlet turned  down. He laid her there, as he had done many a night during that slow and  monotonous journey towards the grave; but her gentle acknowledgment of his  carefulness was wanting to-night. Her head sank upon the pillow, her pale lips  parted with a fluttering sigh, and all was still.</p>
<p>This was how the end came &mdash; suddenly, painlessly.  She died like an infant falling asleep.</p>
<p>Colonel Disney laid his wife in the place she had  loved, the cemetery under the shadow of the old Roman wall, in a verdant corner  near Shelley&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>Burial follows death with dreadful swiftness in  that southern land, and the earth closed over Isola before noon of the day  after her death.</p>
<p>Martin Disney waited to see the new-made grave  covered with summer&rsquo;s loveliest blossoms before he left the cemetery and went  back to the house to which he had taken his fading wife in the radiant Italian  springtime. He paced the desolate rooms, and wandered in and out between the drawing-room  and the sunny bedroom, with its snowy curtained bed, and looked at this object  and that with tear-dimmed eyes and an aching heart.</p>
<p>She was gone. That page of his life was closed for  ever. And now he had but one purpose and one desire &mdash; to settle his account  with the scoundrel who had destroyed her. He had waited till she was at rest:  and now the long agony of waiting was over. Nothing could touch <em>her</em> more; and he was free to bring her  seducer to book.</p>
<p>He had telegraphed in the morning to Captain Hulbert  at Venice, but there had been no reply so far; and he could only suppose that  Allegra and her husband had left the city upon one of those excursions which  his sister had described to him as diversifying their quiet life in their  palace on the grand canal. He had not been at home long, and his tired eyes  were still dazed and blinded by the flood of sunlight which the servants had  let in upon the rooms after the funeral, when a telegram was brought to him.</p>
<p>It was from Brindisi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <em>Eurydice</em> went down with all hands last night, off Smyrna. My brother was on board. I am  on my way to Greece. If you can be spared go to Allegra. &mdash; Hulbert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin Disney knew later that it was between eight  and nine o&rsquo;clock that the <em>Eurydice</em> struck upon a rock, and every soul on board her perished.</p>
<p>The boy and his nurse went back to Trelasco under  Tabitha&rsquo;s escort, and they were followed to Cornwall soon afterwards by the new  Lord Lostwithiel and his wife, who established themselves at the Mount, to the  great satisfaction of the neighbourhood, where it was felt that the local  nobleman had again become a permanent institution. Allegra and her husband took  Martin Disney&rsquo;s son under their protection in the absence of his father, who  carried a heavy heart back to the jungle and the tent, trying to find  distraction and forgetfulness in the pursuit of big game, and who did not  revisit the Angler&rsquo;s Nest till two years after his wife&rsquo;s death, when he  returned to live a tranquil life among the books in the library which he had  built for himself, and to watch the growth of his son, whose every look and  tone recalled the image of his dead wife. Sometimes, on drowsy summer  afternoons, smoking his pipe under the tulip tree, while the Fowey river  rippled by in the sunshine, it seemed to him as if Isola&rsquo;s pensive loveliness,  and the years that he had lived with her, and the tears that he had shed for  her, and the infinite pity which had blotted out all sense of his deep wrong,  were only the transient phases of a long sad dream &mdash; the dream of a love that  never was returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, and yet,&rdquo; he said to himself, after  lengthened meditation, with unseeing eyes fixed upon the movement of the tide,  &ldquo;I think she loved me. I think her heart was mine from the hour her tears  welcomed me back to this house, until her last sigh. God help all young wives  whom their husbands leave alone in their youth and beauty to stand or fall in  the hour of temptation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Idly exploring the contents of the secretaire in  the drawing-room one day, Martin Disney found the telegraphic message which his  wife had written &mdash; and left unsent &mdash; before the Hunt Ball.</p>
