<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. Enter Previous</h2>

<p>He was one of those naturally faded little men who can only be
described as vague. He was so vague that you couldn't tell, after
he had gone, whether he was dark or fair; and it didn't matter at
all. I once wondered how he had ever come to be identified and
sworn to. He might leave you the impression that he had been
exactly the same as a boy.</p>

<p>He blew in, or rather drifted in, on an eddy of a red-dust storm
from the plains, and came along the path to the gate as a piece of
paper might. I had seen him pause, paper-like, against the wire
fence, vaguely examining the number of my "block", painted in
staring white on a black background on an uncompromising oblong of
tin, fastened to the top wire. We settlers are all numbered here,
just as he and I and the rest were in other days; and, of course,
by what some call the Irony of Fate, and some the Long Arm of
Coincidence, and others the Thing that Has to Be, the number by the
side of my gate is the same as the number I wore <i>then.</i> But
the little man didn't notice that; he had got my number in the
township, he told me later. Besides, he had gone by a good many
numbers in his time, and while doing it; and he had met with Many
Such.</p>

<p>His clothes, boots and hat&mdash;in fact, all about
him&mdash;had such a washed-out appearance (if you could
<i>call</i> it an appearance) that they weren't worth describing.
He carried no water-bag; but then he was travelling along the
irrigation channels and the river. His swag was round and of
unusual diameter, and covered with calico, well-made and harnessed,
as amateurs' swags often are when they have once learned the
trick&mdash;better than professionals'. But even the swag had a
hint of unreality and unhealthiness about its bulk, like some city
Domain dosser's&mdash;as if the owner's atmosphere of unreality had
enveloped it. To me it seemed, for the moment, with its
sun-bleached white calico cover, as if it were a roll of burnt
white paper that might vanish with its owner in tiny flakes of
tinder if I clapped my hands. But this might have been on account
of a bit of absent-mindedness, and the fiendish red-dust storm
along the road, and the unreality of the great plains around. He
seemed to shed his swag as if it were full of feathers. It was so
dumpy that it stood on end; and the two-thirds empty tucker-bag
drooped down against it as a tired, worn-out little wife might sink
into a seat beside her big husband after a day of toil and trouble;
or as a starved, dirty-white cat might lean against a squat,
good-natured bulldog, smoodging.</p>

<p>And so the small man was before me at the foot of the verandah
steps.</p>

<p>"Good-day, mate!" I said; and as he didn't answer, but seemed to
be looking at me (if it could be called looking) in a vacant way,
with washed-out blue-white eyes that had a chinaware brightness
about them, said: "What's your trouble?"</p>

<p>He swung half round and down, pecked at the gravel behind him
with his finger and thumb, as a hen does, and as swiftly brought
the closed finger and thumb to his lips, and stood to attention.
Then he saluted&mdash;or rather his hat-brim jerked downward to
salute his crooked forefinger that jerked up halfway to meet it. It
was a gaol salute, all right. And the other was a prison sign: he
had turned, in line, to pick up an imaginary morsel of tobacco
supposed to be thrown over the wall by a more fortunate prisoner in
the next yard, while the attention of the warder&mdash;whom I stood
for&mdash;was momentarily diverted.</p>

<p>"I can't place you yet," I said.</p>

<p>There was a slight flicker of impatience&mdash;or it may have
been a shade of mildly sorrowful reproach&mdash;in this daylight
shadow, and in a sigh of faraway world-weariness he told me:</p>

<p>"Previous Convictions."</p>

<p>There was not in it the ghost of a note of exclamation. Even the
period was blurred and faded.</p>

<p>"Previous Convictions," he sighed again.</p>

<p>Then I remembered him. He came back to me on a great wave of
thought. Or I came back to him. He had told me that when I first
asked him what his trouble was; and we nicknamed him "Previous
Convictions"&mdash;or "Previous" for short. But "previous" was a
word that could not, by any stretch of applicability, be fitted on
to him. The Law couldn't do it. It couldn't even fit him with
"malice aforethought". Even "subsequent" was altogether too sudden
a word to apply to poor little Previous. It was the Law that was
subsequent with regard to him. Brutally so, I thought; but the
warders treated him kindly, even gently&mdash;or, at worst, with
toleration&mdash;as we might an unsociable poodle that keeps rats
and strange cats away from the place. And the governor gave him the
billet of pantryman in the gaol hospital when it fell vacant.</p>

<p>I rose impulsively from the deck chair on the verandah, stepped
down and held out my hand. It was the ghost of a shake on the part
of Previous. It seemed as if my hand was no good to him, and he
didn't know what to do with it. I might as well have reached for
the froth of vanished beers from the centre of a dry area.</p>

<p>"Come on to the verandah and sit down," I said.</p>

<p>But Previous declined, with the ghost of a shrug. He seated
himself on the top step, with one heel trailing on the gravel, one
foot on the bottom step, and his right forearm resting limply on
his raised knee. I sat on the edge of the verandah, somewhat
similar. Previous talked to people with his shoulder mostly. That
shoulder was his salient, so to speak, and a point of mild,
reproachful counter-attack that sometimes hurt. Also of too-ready
retreat that left you helpless, irritated, even demoralised.</p>

<p>"Had dinner, Previous?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;thank yer all the same. Boiled the billy back on what
they call the Hay Canal, before we struck the town."</p>

<p>"Who's 'we', Previous?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell yer about him presently."</p>

<p>"Where are you making for?" I asked, more to fill up a pause
than anything else.</p>

<p>"Hay," said the visitor. "I want to get away from some of my
previous convictions, if I can." Then, after an awkward gap: "I
didn't mean to come in&mdash;I only meant to go parst an' have a
look at what sort of place you was livin' in, an' leave something
an' a message. Besides, I've got Dotty with me. There he is."</p>

<p>He pointed obliquely across the road, and I saw a stout man, in
white pants and faded waistcoat, sitting on the bank of the channel
under the transplanted blue sugar-gums, with something in the grass
beside him that might have been a swag or might have been a blue
dog. He was much more solid-looking than Previous, and he had a
broad-brimmed, flat, dirty-coloured straw hat, which might have
come out of old Darlinghurst Gaol, tilted feloniously over the
bridge of his nose. It was almost tilted over his chin; so he
couldn't have had any forehead to speak of, though he seemed to
have plenty of back to his head. But that might have been hair.</p>

<p>"I couldn't bring <i>him</i> in," added Previous.</p>

<p>"Why? What's <i>his</i> trouble?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Thievin'," said Previous, resignedly. "Allers thievin'. He
can't get away from it like I could. He's thievin'-mad, I think.
He'll thieve anything. He thieves things that are no good to him
nor anyone else. I've known him to thieve wore-out women's
underclothing from the line. Yer'd think he was one of them what
they call sexyil pivits&mdash;but he ain't; nothing like that. Why,
back there on the hostrich farm he tried to thieve the bustle off a
hostrich that was outside on ther railway line; but the hostrich
jumped the railway fence and got away. Dotty got some feathers off
of ther barbed wires, though. He said he wanted to send them to his
wife."</p>

<p>"His wife!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes. Tell yer erbout <i>her</i> dreckly. It's funny," Previous
reflected, "ter see them hostriches runnin' alongside the train,
like some big women I've seen, instead of goin' off at right angles
if they're frightened. Hostriches is fools all right.</p>

<p>"Dotty wasn't always like he is now: He was a fine young fellow
once, and a bit of a boxer&mdash;a nathlete, an' somethin' on the
railway. He run and picked a kid off the crossin' an' got knocked
out with a truck they was shuntin'; an' his wife married him for
bein' a hero, an' made his life a hell, one way and another, and
drove him to drink, an' gaoled him for maint'nance, an' all that,
with somethin' else that happened, and maybe the old crack he got
on the head with the railway truck made him what he is. He told the
warders that, but they didn't believe him&mdash;they thought he was
allers dotty. But I knew a woman who was there, an' she said it was
all true&mdash;an' there was no nonsense about her. She wanted to
marry <i>me</i> an' make a man of me," Previous reflected. "But
that would have bin no use&mdash;she'd only have been chuckin' up
me previous convictions agen me every time we quarrelled. Dotty was
on tobacco when I first met him in ther gaol, an' he was good to me
an' one or two others; so, afterwards, I didn't drop him, an' I
found he was a good feller, only for his rat and his thievin'. I
thought a trip west might do him good, so I brought him along with
me."</p>

<p>"How did you get here, Previous?"</p>

<p>"Well, first I got the tickets, and we watched our chance and
slipped into the train. (No, but I thought the police might want to
stop us leaving the city. Previous convictions, y'know.) We trained
as fur as the tickets went, an' then we tramped, an' worked when we
could, an' trained an' tramped agen; an' once or twice we got a
lift in the brake-van of a luggage train. We worked at baggin' an'
stackin' wheat, an' other jobs. Dotty don't thieve when he's
workin'; but that's only another sign he's ratty. He don't loaf, or
go slow either; so the gangs thought he must be a pimp. So we
couldn't stay long on any job."</p>

<p>I knocked out my pipe and went inside and got my tobacco
tin.</p>

<p>"Talking of Dotty being on tobacco, Previous&mdash;where's
<i>your</i> pipe?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I chucked smokin'," said Previous. "The gaol cured me of
that&mdash;I've got no taste for it. But I chew a bit sometimes.
The gaol makes a tobacco-chewer of many a clean-mouthed
pipe-smoker. An' a criminal of a decent, honest man sometimes. An'
that's about all it does. But talkin' of smokin', I was readin' a
book I found back in the last-night's camp (Dotty thieved it from
me, and he's got it in his swag now) erbout a feller that escaped
from some gaol in England&mdash;some Moor&mdash;yes, Dartmoor. The
escape was all right, but then the book got all among German spies
that had nothing to do with Dartmoor, or any gaol, or this chap,
either; so I chucked readin' it. Anyway, the bloke steals a bicycle
an gets off clear. He comes to a sort of deserted mansion with a
carriage-drive, an' he goes in&mdash;he's deadbeat an' starvin';
an' he gets in through the pantry winder. But there's a bloke
livin' there, mysterious-like, with a Russian girl and a old
housekeeper&mdash;they're all mixed up some way with the German
spies; but I didn't filler 'em. 'Course the bloke ketches the
Dartmoor cove and has a talk to him, an' gives him a blow-out of
bread and milk, an' cold turkey, an' a bottle o' wine, 'n' a good
cigar. (They allers does in them books.) An' ther gaol cove smokes
the cigar right down to the butt! All rot&mdash;why, he'd been five
years in gaol; an' even if he could have got down the tucker and
the wine, the first whiff of that cigar would have made him throw
up his works! Even <i>you</i> should er known that. All
book-writers ought to be in gaol fer awhile."</p>

<p>Previous turned his vague eyes to where Dotty was looking first
up and then down the road.</p>

<p>"Well, I must be getting on," he said, rising stiffly. He
screwed his face and rubbed his conversation shoulder, which had
been up on the defensive all the time, and now went down with a
jerk of his arm.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Previous?" I asked. "Touch of rheumatism?
You don't seem so dapper as you used to be&mdash;been sleeping in
the wet?"</p>

<p>"Got knocked with a tram," said Previous laconically.</p>

<p>"The tram hit me."</p>

<p>"I know that; but how did it happen? You didn't used to get
drunk."</p>

<p>"Nor don't now. Y&mdash;yer see," he went on reluctantly and
hurriedly&mdash;slurring his words as men do when telling about a
good deed performed by themselves which they don't expect to be
believed&mdash;"I went to git a kid orf the tramline; an' fist as I
got the kid clear the front corner of another tram come and knocked
me down. I never done a decent thing yet," he reflected, "but I
suffered for it afterwards somehow. Still, salin' the kid was
another link between me an' Dotty. He'd saved one an' I'd saved
one."</p>

<p>A gust of recollection came to me.</p>

<p>"And you wouldn't give your name!" I said.</p>

<p>"How'd you know? You wasn't on one of the trams?" he added
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"No, but a friend of mine was. He described you to
me&mdash;manner and talk and all&mdash;but I couldn't fix you at
the time. He saw you in the hospital afterwards, and you wouldn't
give your name there. You said 'Smith' would do."</p>

<p>"So it did," said Previous.</p>

<p>"But why didn't you own up?" I asked. "There might have been
something coming to you. It might have done you some good. You left
the hospital next day. Why didn't you give your name and
address?"</p>

<p>Again the shadowy shrug of impatience, of mild indignation or
reproach.</p>

<p>"There was me previous convictions."</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon, Previous," I said hastily; "I
forgot."</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. The Story of Dotty</h2>

<p>The night after Previous Convictions and Dotty turned up at my
place at Leeton they camped on a vacant block along the irrigation
channel. There was nothing missing in Leeton next morning; no one
had anything to miss, except perhaps the Commission, and not even a
hopeless kleptomaniac like Dotty would attempt to thieve anything
from <i>that.</i> Nobody ever got anything out of a Royal
Commission. In the afternoon Previous Convictions turned up again;
or, rather, I found the faded little man waiting vaguely in the
shade on the lower steps of my front verandah.</p>

<p>"I promised to come round again before we went on," he said. "I
waited till I seen the Little Landlady go up town. I knowed she was
out here housekeeping for you. I uster know her when she kept the
big refreshment rooms in North Sydney. I never thieved anything off
of <i>her&mdash;</i>except perhaps a few cigarettes&mdash;an' I'll
make <i>that</i> up to her some day. No, not from
<i>her&mdash;</i>she was kind to us young larrikins."</p>

<p>"And you promised to tell me something about your life,
Previous," I said.</p>

<p>"And so I will. I told you I was born at a livery stables. At
least that's where I come to meself. My father&mdash;well, never
mind who he was. He was what they called a gentleman in them days.
They used to say that it broke out in me sometimes; but that was a
long time ago. Me mother was&mdash;well, she's dead."</p>

<p>Previous dropped the vernacular occasionally, and then you'd
know he felt things. Perhaps it was his father "breaking out" in
him&mdash;there are many like him in the city and Outback.</p>

<p>"You know what those livery stables are like," Previous went on;
"you can see it in most country towns. There's a sort of a sullen,
unhealthy, resentful&mdash;what-d'yer-call-it?&mdash;atmosphere
about them. And the men who go out with stallions are often the
same. They seem to get all the bad qualities of the horses and none
of the good ones. Anyway, I went crook&mdash;but only on thievin'.
Perhaps we get broodin' about what people think we are, and end up
by gettin' to think that we might as well <i>be</i> it. But I
learned to ride and I learned to swim. (The stables were close to a
swimming baths.) I can do a lot of things that nobody would ever
dream of <i>me</i> doing."</p>

<p>The voice went on now as though it were altogether detached from
Previous. I listened, and thought of the days when <i>I</i> could
ride.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you go in the Light Horse or something, in 1915,
Previous? It would have straightened you up," I said.</p>

<p>"The Light Horse are all about six feet and weigh half a ton
each," said Previous "at least all I've seen of 'em."</p>

<p>"But you might have gone in the artillery, or army medical, or
something, as driver?"</p>

<p>"An' what good would that do me?"</p>

<p>"It would have built you up. And you might have got a medal, or
even a Victoria Cross."</p>

<p>"No good&mdash;it would only have made my previous convictions
come out worse...Besides, there was me shoulder that went crook
gettin' that kid from under the tram."</p>

<p>I begged pardon.</p>

<p>"Where's Dotty?" I asked, to end an awkward pause.</p>

<p>"I'll show you by and by. An' about Dotty. After he got the
knock on the head savin' that kid when he was a shunter in the
Goulburn railway yards, he was never quite right; and, after his
wife gaoled him for maintenance in Sydney, they had to put him in
the Receiving House for loonies. His missus pretended to be sorry,
an' she used to come and visit him there, an' bring him fruit an'
stuff&mdash;be very lovin' an' kiss him when she came an' kiss him
when she went away. Now, there was a little window in that
rat-joint that looked out into the street opposite the old jug"
(Previous meant the Darlinghurst Gaol) "and she'd tell him to look
out of that window after she'd gone and she'd wave her hand to him.
And when he looked out she'd be walking up and down with the other
man. And she'd wave her hand to Dotty's window and kiss it,
too.</p>

<p>"You see, she wanted to drive him into a real madhouse, and get
rid of him for good. He'd rave about it, but the attendants and
doctors only thought it was delusions." (A good many delusions are
the real thing; but the real things have to be cured as well as the
delusions.) "One day, two of the attendants&mdash;the head one and
a probationer&mdash;listened to Dotty, and watched that window, and
caught her at it. After that they shut that window&mdash;and shut
her out of the place, too, for good and all. But they saved Dotty
from the madhouse.</p>

<p>"They keep patients at the Receiving House for a week or
two&mdash;keep 'em to find out whether it's the mad horrors they've
got or only the drink horrors: to separate the impostors from the
genuine loonies, so to speak. They claim to save sixty or seventy
per cent in the Receiving House&mdash;that is, save 'em from the
lunatic asylums, and I reckon they're about right. But they like to
have some friend or relation to take charge of doubtful cases
before they let them go. So I took Dotty an' looked after him as
well as I could. I'd got a job in a stables on the Shore then, and
had a room there with a spare bunk in it. Dotty was clean dotty
then; he'd quite forgotten everything, right back to the time he
was a shunter&mdash;wife, daughters and all. But he showed a great
affection for me. Just like a dog&mdash;which was another proof
that he was hopeless. Fancy anyone taking to me!&mdash;unless he
was mad or wanted something!</p>

<p>"An' now I'll tell you the truth. <i>All Dotty's mad thievin'
was done for me.</i> At least at first. Why, the first thing he
done was to slip out one night and thieve a doormat and a garden
chair, and bring 'em to me at the stables. What would I want with a
doormat and a garden chair in a milk-cart stables? I took him out
again the same night and made him show me the verandah and the lawn
he thieved 'em from, an' put 'em back again. He was just as pleased
to show me the places as he was pleased to do anything else for
me.</p>

<p>"I'd noticed a new young policeman come nosin' round the
stables, and tryin' to look as if he was only dodging his sergeant
and waiting for six o'clock and off-duty time. But I knowed better.
He was one of those newchum wasters, sent out to a rich aunt, and
had got into the force by influence while other police was away at
the war; an' he'd overheard some of the decent old police talkin',
and wanted a case. All me old previous convictions come back on me
with a rush, an' I went off me feed. And, to make matters worse, a
few nights later poor old Dotty slipped out&mdash;just before
daylight when I'd got to sleep at last&mdash;and thieved that
blessed old rustic chair and doormat again. He put the chair
alongside my bunk with the mat on it, and sat on his own bunk
looking like a poor idiot son, and waited for me to wake up and be
glad. He'd noticed I wasn't too cheerful the last few days. I
suppose he expected me to hug him and kiss him on both
cheeks&mdash;or something like that.</p>

<p>"I had a bad day of it, because I seen that new policeman
saunterleeryin' round agen. There was an old retired
senior-sergeant about, too; he had a house of his own close handy
and a pension of three or four pounds a week. He'd arrested me a
few times in the old days&mdash;twice for arrears of maintenance
and once for thievin' to pay it&mdash;but I didn't take much notice
of him. You see he was drinking himself to death and couldn't
sleep, and he used to go ghosting round at all hours haunting
himself and all the young police on night duty.</p>

<p>"He called into the office during the day to pay his milk and
ice and butter bill, which was in arrears on account of his wife's
alimony havin' got in arrears first&mdash;she'd divorced him as
soon's he'd got his pension. He passed out through the stables, an'
while he was goin' through he nodded to me. I read something at
once in that nod, and the sudden thought of that young policeman
give me the cold horrers; but I nodded back, an' he went out, an'
neither of us said nothing.</p>

<p>"I couldn't sleep that night, but walked up and down in the
stables, and so Dotty couldn't get out. I knew he was awake waiting
for a chance to go and steal the foundation-stone of a Hoddfellows'
Hall they'd laid that day&mdash;or something just as useful to me.
He did thieve the new-laid foundation-stone of a hall or institute
or something for me once&mdash;or, at least, the plate on it. Must
have got it off with a crowbar the workmen had left out of the
tool-shed. The inscription said it was laid by Lady Abeceedy, a
sort of an aunt of mine; or, rather, a relation of my father's. We
always knowed she was an old hen," reflected Previous, "but I never
thought she could lay a stone like that."</p>

<p>I looked very hard at Previous: the voice was his and the face
was his, but neither in voice nor in face was there the ghost of
the shadow of a sign of a smile. And I've seen a Chinaman show
<i>some</i> emotion at something that struck both of us as being
humorous.</p>

<p>"No. He didn't thieve the coins from under the foundation-stone.
Money's about the only thing that Dotty wouldn't thieve, not even
for me&mdash;except perhaps a politician's reputation; he's not so
mad as that&mdash;at least not yet. I don't believe he knows what
money is, or what it's good for.</p>

<p>"Anyway," Previous went on. "Dotty dropped off that morning just
before daylight. It was during the time of the daylight-saving rat
that some of the fresh, young politicians had got. Some of 'em will
save daylight themselves yet. So I fed the horses and made up my
mind. I broke up that chair and stuck it, and the mat with it, well
in under the boiler we used to hot the water for scalding the
milk-cans. I put the coal and kindling-wood in front, an' when the
proper time came I lit up. I never felt so criminal in all me life.
I don't suppose any decent young crook committing his first offence
ever did. It was just like the old time when I embezzled the five
quid to save myself from going to gaol and going mad again for
arrears of maintenance. The flue was damp, and the smell of the
burning green paint off that garden chair came out from under the
copper at first. I can smell it yet. This was worse'n thievin' or
receivin'," said Previous; "it was also aiding and abetting and
destroying evidence and property. I looked out, and there was the
old senior-sergeant going down towards the water like a
sleepwalker. 'He'll go in to it some night,' I said to myself; and
I felt that way, too, just then. And I wondered if <i>he</i>
smelled that burning paint.</p>

<p>"I thought to myself that if Dotty got loose again he'd bring
all my previous convictions out worse than the plague we had round
there just then. But he steadied down the next few days and seemed
quieter and&mdash;and more 'rational,' as <i>you'd</i> say," added
Previous apologetically. "Or less restless. I'd told them at the
stables that he was my step-brother lookin' for a job. He didn't
look enough like me to be a brother. He used to help groom the
horses, and by and by the head stableman took him on perminent.
He'd work hard and sleep at nights; but just when things were
lookin' a bit brighter for me, he went off again. That time he goes
up the hill to a church they were putting a new wing to and thieved
a new stained-glass window, crate and all. It was that young
policeman caught him with it&mdash;bringing it home to me.</p>

<p>"It was Sunday at midnight when Dotty was caught thievin' that
angel window from the church. My previous convictions wasn't known
on the North Shore much, except to the senior-sergeant and one or
two; so Monday morning at ten o'clock I chanced it and went up to
the police-court. The old senior-sergeant had ghosted down and
gimme the nod early. There was a grand old magistrate on the
Bench&mdash;he retired, too, the other day. So I told him all about
poor Dotty, even to the stepbrother lie, and I could see that he
believed it. I didn't tell him about the chair and mat, though.</p>

<p>"'But what about the stained-glass window, yer Worship?' asked
the young arresting constable.</p>

<p>"'It's only another proof that Ditty's mad, your Worship,' I
said. 'He's a harmless lunatic. What did <i>I</i> want with a
stained-glass window? I'm camping in a stable, not in the ruins of
the Reems Cathedral. I wish I was.'</p>

<p>"Somebody offered bail&mdash;and I had a queer fancy that the
old senior-sergeant was behind it. Old felons like meself get
instincts sometimes&mdash;like women. But Mr Aarons&mdash;that was
the magistrate&mdash;said he couldn't allow bail; he said he was
building a new private residence across the bay, as they all knew,
and it was nearly finished, with a stained-glass hall door;
besides, he'd sent his prize sow with her litter across there
already, so he couldn't afford to take any risks. But he'd pos'pone
the case till after dinner.</p>

<p>"I was to come back at two o'clock sharp. The court was very
quiet when I was called in&mdash;by my own name, of course, and I
hardly knew it again. It was the only case for the afternoon. I
noticed the church contractor and the old minister sort of hovering
in the background&mdash;like stained-glass windows without the
stain.</p>

<p>"Mr Aarons asked me if I knew anyone who would asoom charge of
Dotty, and take him away; and I said I knew of a daughter who was
fond of him once, but I didn't know where she was. And, anyway, her
husband wouldn't have him. But I said <i>I'd</i> take him away and
do the best I could for him. Then Mr Aarons dipped his pen twice
outside the inkpot and once into it, and looked down at his book
and said 'Case dismissed'.</p>

<p>"I was still puzzled when I got Dotty round the corner, till I
saw the old senior-sergeant beckon to me from the side-entrance of
a pub. He took us into the bottle-department, all amongst the Sarah
Gamps and Betsy Prigs, and Dotty and I had two ginger-ales and the
senior-sergeant had a brandy and soda. After that he led me aside,
behind the screen. 'Look here, Previous', he said, 'you go West,
you'll do well now; and take Dotty with you. And I'll give you a
hint about <i>him.</i> He was a good amateur boxer once, when he
was younger&mdash;get him interested in <i>that.</i> I know all
about it, and I told Mr Aarons and the constable-in-charge all
about Dotty&mdash;never mind when' (he says)&mdash;'except the part
<i>you</i> left out today. And we've had our eyes on you ever since
you've been here. I was Dotty's boss when he was a younger shunter
in the Goulburn railway yards; and the child he saved was my niece,
the daughter of my favourite sister. Keep clear of the new police,
and especially of the younger ones, till you get away. Some of them
are fond of hunting up old records. They're all budding
detectives', and he opened my coat and slipped six notes and a half
into me inner pocket and buttoned me coat up again&mdash;like a
warder gettin' a criminal lunatic ready to send to the Parramatta
Asylum. 'I got up a little collection this morning,' he
said&mdash;'thieved it or pinched it, or what you like!' And then
he said: 'I say, Previous, what god was you burning incense to the
other morning? I smelt it. It was just like burnt paint on an old
garden chair!'</p>

<p>"And so I say," concluded Previous, "once a policeman always a
policeman."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. Previous And S'Samuel</h2>

<p>In accordance with a mutual wish unexpressed but perfectly
understood by ex-felons, my faded little friend Previous
Convictions was vaguely waiting for me next afternoon on the lower
step of my front verandah at Leeton. It was on the shady side of
the house, too, and not overlooked. Previous never seemed to make
or put in an appearance; he always faded into appearance, just as
he faded into absence. He had his faded, solid-looking swag with
him, the dumpiness or drum-like shape of which had puzzled me on
his first appearance. He was "humpin' his drum" all right, in his
faded, west-o'-sunset way&mdash;maybe I am too. I looked along the
bank of the irrigation channel across the road and thought I caught
a glimpse of Dotty's hat low down behind a tree where he might have
been sitting waiting for Previous.</p>

<p>I had sent the Little Landlady up to the town on a message to a
place where I knew she'd spend two or three hours with another
Lowland Scot of similar convictions&mdash;a fact which I believed
to be also ex-feloniously understood between Previous and
myself.</p>

<p>The voice that came from Previous sounded firmer today; and, in
a haunting, irritating way, sardonic&mdash;at least, at first, and
if such a term could be applied to <i>him.</i></p>

<p>"Well, how are you today, Previous?" I asked.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"I said 'How are you getting on, Previous?'"</p>

<p>There was something like an impatient movement of Previous's
humped-up, defensive shoulder.</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> care?" he said. There was no resentment in
the tone. He might have been referring to one of my own real or
imaginary troubles.</p>

<p>"Why, what's wrong with you today, Previous?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg yer pardin," he said, rousing himself as though
wearily. "It's only a saying I got. I thought you remembered that."
Then he went on: "The first time I come&mdash;that was the day
before yesterday&mdash;I seen another bloke down near the fence
prunin' fruit-trees; so I says to him, 'Can you tell me where I'll
find Mr Henry Lawson?' I says&mdash;'I b'lieve his place is
somewheres about here,' and the bloke he looks round an' says,
'Why, there's 'Arry now, across the channel, talkin' to another old
woman,' he says."</p>

<p>"Shut up, Previous," I said, "and get on with the yarn. You
haven't told me <i>your</i> story, yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, that'll all come out in the evidence," said Previous, with
a faint tinge of bitterness. "It always does.</p>

<p>"Well, I told you how me and Dotty come to leave Sydney an' how
we got this far. As soon as we were on to the Murrumbidgee Dotty
improved a lot. It seemed he'd been on the old river some time in
his young days, and when he smelt it he started to thieve
fishing-rods and lines from over a fence in Narrandera that I'd
left him sittin' against while I looked up a likely store to buy
grub in; but I caught him at it, and made him put 'em back, and
bought some tackle in a store where I got flour and stuff. We
follered the river from near this side of Narrandera. We had some
bread, an' plenty of flour an' tea an' bacon, an' I knew a little
of the game, so we was all right&mdash;I learnt something of it in
the cookshop an' pantry in old Darlin'-hurst Gaol, you see, and
afterwards batchin' in stables, where I had a job after I'd chucked
goin' crook.</p>

<p>"But I needn't have bothered. Dotty knew that blessed old river
if he didn't know anything else. As soon as we come to the first
good fishin' hole&mdash;an' a weird, wild, three witches place it
was, too, with steep dark banks and old blasted trees lookin' over
the top&mdash;he made a shrimp net with a little cask hoop an' a
piece of scrim he'd brought along, an' started to fish. He could
sling out the lines, too, an' showed me how. The fish only seemed
to bite in just two spots, wherever we camped, an' that's what
always puzzled me. The first thing Dotty caught was a little black
mud-turtle&mdash;caught it by the tip of the tongue. Dotty took the
hook out careful, an' put the baby down gently on the top of the
bank with its head towards the river. Don't ever tell me a turtle
is slow&mdash;that one never touched anything till it touched
water; it went just like a swaller flyin' low.</p>

<p>"When that turtle got over its fright, a mile or two down the
river, it must have told all the other turtles to drive the fish up
to us, wherever we was, out of gratitude, for we never went short
of fish while the season was on, an' we even got a few after it was
over. I've seen Civil Service Johnnies an' tourists come out in
motor cars an' sulkies on Sundays an' fish both sides of us and in
between, with telescope rods and reels an' all that sort of thing,
and never catch nothing. And there was me an' Dotty, with two old
clothes-props and sardine-tin openers for sinkers, Pullin' out
bream no end. I useter sell fish to those Johnnies when their tarts
wasn't lookin'.</p>

<p>"An' now I'll give yer a hint. Fish the rivers with shrimps and
the creeks with worms. The river fish don't know anything about
worms&mdash;they're too slow; but worms come natural to creeks.
Them Johnnies had burnt out their boilers diggin' worms in the sun
all the mornin'. Dotty never used one. But, look here&mdash;he
always put <i>two</i> shrimps on his hook; the first tail first an'
the second head first, coverin' between 'em the whole of the hook.
Something the same as what the D's used ter do when they wanted to
ketch <i>us.</i></p>

<p>"Dotty would gut the fish and rub in coarse salt to keep 'em
fresh, and lay 'em on beds of wetted charcoal under the shady side
of old burnt-out shells of trees where the bush fires had bin, with
a wet bag over 'em to keep 'em cool. And I'd sell them to
rabbit-camps or hawkers, and I'd swap them to the station cook or
storekeeper for tea and sugar and bread and other tucker. One day
Dotty got a rabbit's heart and caught a Murray cod that night, and
took it along to the station cook in the morning before I was
awake; and I'm dashed if he didn't come back with a single barrel
breechloader he said he'd borrowed from the cook, an' a brace of
wild duck. Gawd, my heart was thumpin' up in me throat fit to
smother me. I thought Dotty had started thievin' again, just when I
was havin' a bit of peace of mind.</p>

<p>"It was along behind old Sam McCaughey's homestead station, and
I suppose you know how Old Sam hated guns goin' off an' poachin'
behind the Mansion, so I couldn't believe the cook lent Dotty a gun
at all. I took Dotty back with the gun to explain him as well as I
could. The men's huts was in the old homestead&mdash;all panelled
windows and doors&mdash;and the cook was a fat, jovial little man,
like an old-fashioned sea-cook. I showed him the gun and started to
explain. But he'd lent Dotty the gun all right. I couldn't
understand it at all. I'd noticed one or two of the men wink at me,
but I couldn't make it out until presently I seen that the cook was
another Dotty.</p>

<p>"He lost his billet next week. 'Bad bread.' They always drop
their billets in the same old ditch&mdash;bad bread. I believe a
bloke that can bake can travel all over the world for nothing, an'
come back with a few quid. He wanted to come along with us, but I
couldn't be expected to have <i>two</i> Dotties on me mind at the
same time. Just while we was talkin' they come wheeling Old Sam
himself round for an airing. His props had gone crook on him, you
know. Ever see him? No? He was a big fat man, like George Reid, and
he looked something like George Reid, too; but, then, agen, he
didn't. His face was just the real old squatter's that used to come
to a livery stables I worked at in Sydney when I was a
youngster&mdash;when they useter come down at Easter and stay at
the old Royal that's a returned soldiers' club now. The sort that
managed their own stations.</p>

<p>"'Travellers?' asked Old Sam.</p>

<p>"'Yes. S'Samuel.' I said.</p>

<p>"'Where are you making for?'</p>

<p>"'Hay,' I said. 'We've been campin' on the river a bit.'</p>

<p>"'I know yer have,' said Old Sam.</p>

<p>"It didn't sound very promisin'. But then he said, 'Where did
you get the cod?' and that sounded better.</p>

<p>"'What bait did you use?' he asked when I told him; and I told
him that, too. I also worked up the courage to tell him that Dotty
caught the cod; and he looked sideways at Dotty just as if he'd
seen him or something like him before. 'I thought so,' he said.
Then, to himself like. 'I wish my legs were as good as my
head.'</p>

<p>"But I didn't know whether <i>I</i> did&mdash;or, at least, not
just then.</p>

<p>"Then I said, a bit nervous. 'I believe my father was born on
one of your stations in Victoria, S'Samuel.' I'm blest if I know
why I said it.</p>

<p>"Now what was his name?' asked Old Sam after a short
think&mdash;as if he'd been tryin' to remember it himself.</p>

<p>"This stumped me; but I said 'Smith'.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said old Sam, 'I've heard of him.'</p>

<p>"An' right there poor old Dotty had one of those flashes that
I'd noticed once or twice since we come on the river, and I could
have killed him for it. 'And I close up croaked on one of your
stations in Noo South, S'Sam,' says Dotty.</p>

<p>"'Indeed,' said Old Sam&mdash;'what station was that?'</p>

<p>"'Tooraly,' said Dotty.</p>

<p>"'What year?' asked old Sam.</p>

<p>"'I don't know,' said Dotty.</p>

<p>"'What was the name of the manager, then?'</p>

<p>"'A man named James was boss-over-the-board,' said Dotty, quite
prompt.</p>

<p>"Old Sam nodded. Presently he asked: 'And what did you nearly
croak of?'</p>

<p>"'It wasn't <i>your</i> fault, S'Sam,' said Dotty. 'It was curry
an' rice an' the heat wave.'</p>

<p>"I looked at Dotty hard," said Previous, "but his strange face
was gone and there was nothing but his silly, vacant, patient,
good-natured grin that is natural to him nowadays; and I felt
relieved. I'll tell you why afterwards."</p>

<p>"'Ah, well,' said Old Sam, 'if you get another cod, bring it up
and they'll put it in the ice chest. I'm expecting the Governor
up.' And he signed to them to wheel him away.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;ah well," reflected Previous, finally disposing of
that good Australian squatter, all of the Old School. "I liked Old
S'Sam, though he was a Bilfast Orangeman, and I have other
convictions besides me previous ones. And I wisht his legs
<i>was</i> as good as his head. Or his heart, for that matter.</p>

<p>"'Yer all right now for a week or two,' said one of the station
hands to me. 'The cook'll give yer all yer want. An', say, yer can
hang on to that old gun for a few days (it's mine, so keep it
dry)&mdash;in case yer want to have a shot at something; yer mate,
for instance. But shoot a bit down the river. I'll get yer a few
more cartridges.'</p>

<p>"I thanked that chap, but I didn't take the gun. How was Ito
know if Dotty wasn't goin' to get a different sort of rat an'
mistake <i>me</i> for a blue duck?</p>

<p>"The cook gave me all we wanted, an', what's more, some jam and
butter an' bacon an' eggs. Yer don't get <i>them</i> on the outback
stations. Dotty baked the ducks on the coals, like he baked the
fish, and we had a real good tuck-out for supper. Then I had about
the first long, sound, happy sleep I'd had on the track, an' woke
up to the smell of bacon an' eggs that poor old Dotty had ready for
me. He'd fried 'em on the blade of an old shovel they'd used for
diggin' worms, with plenty of butter for the eggs.</p>

<p>"It wasn't long after daybreak, and I laid back again after
another pint of tea to have a last snooze before the sun got up
much and made everything hot. It's hotter in the mornings out
there. Oh, but <i>I was</i> tired&mdash;clean knocked up, but happy
about things; about being free from trouble, and all me previous
convictions, and havin' Dotty cured of his thievin', whether for me
or for anybody else; so happy that I dreamed about it. But the sun
or something woke me, an' I set up an' missed Dotty. I heard a
scuffling on the bank an' got up&mdash;an' just in time. Dotty had
been back to the loosin paddicks across the old Hay Road and
thieved a red cow with a new calf, and brought 'em back home to
camp to me! And the cow chased me into the river, where I got
horned on a snag; which was pretty near as bad as gettin' horned on
a cow, with the current running like that.</p>

<p>"When I got out, all over black mud, the cow had gone back up
over the bank to Dotty and the calf, and was out of sight; and
after a bit Dotty comes back to camp with a billy of fresh, frothy
milk, an' the sickenin' silly smile of a poor idiot brother. So
he'd gone in for cattle liftin' now, an' I supposed it'd be robbery
under arms next, for my sweet sake. And milk spoils tea that's made
in billies by the campfire, an', besides, this milk was too new and
yellow for anything. So it was the same old, senseless, useless
business all over again.</p>

<p>"But how in blazes&mdash;there, I nearly swore&mdash;but,
anyhow, <i>how</i> anyone but a natural-born loony could mess about
with a more'n half-wild red cow with a new calf&mdash;and on foot
with bare hands, too&mdash;without gettin' ripped up, I dunno. And
she wasn't no poley nor shorthorn neither. Perhaps the two loonies
recognised each other&mdash;like Dotty an' the cook. Or, perhaps,
the cow felt the same sort of respect for the loony&mdash;the
''flicted of God'&mdash;as what a Dago does, while the civilised
Anglo-Saxon only laughs at them&mdash;or else torments 'em."</p>

<p>A bark of anxious, yearning interrogation, changing quickly into
a joyous yelp of recognition, from dog Charley chained up and
suffering at the side of the house&mdash;also for his previous
convictions&mdash;warned us that the Little Landlady was coming
home across the back channel.</p>

<p>"See yer agen!" said the voice of Previous with no change or
suggestion of hurry. "Tell you why I brought Dotty from the river
'nother time."</p>

<p>I went through the house to the back door to look, and when I
returned the little man was already fading into absence round the
big sun-whitened front gate post.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. A Wet Camp</h2>

<p>Previous Convictions' little, dumpy, sawn off swag was standing
on end right in the middle of the garden path opposite my front
verandah steps, like the daylight ghost of a little, furred,
grey-white stump; but Previous himself was nowhere to be detected.
However, he faded in presently, round the big, grey front gate post
and on to the lower step; and, glancing along the bank of the
irrigation channel, in the direction from which he had come, I was
aware of a turned-down brim of a hat and a pair of drawn-up knees
just showing behind a tree.</p>

<p>After a while the voice of Previous was vague in the hot, heavy
air.</p>

<p>"I left Dotty along there behind the ornamental tree," he said,
"but I lost sight of his hat for a minute when I got here, so I
went back to see if he was goin' in for a swim&mdash;or tryin' to
thieve the canal. But he was only down in the reeds fishing for
yabbies with a bit of meat on a string."</p>

<p>(I might mention that yabbies are little things of the crayfish
kind that undermine the banks of the irrigation channels and help
let the water soak on and waste, while the reeds do their best to
choke the channels, and have to be cut every year. They are known
out there as McCaughey's Curse.)</p>

<p>"I promised once to tell you why I brought Dotty from the
river," Previous went on, "after old S'Sam gave us permission to
camp' an' fish an' shoot there, and after he'd thieved the cow that
chased me into the water&mdash;I mean Dotty did, not old S'Sam. The
fish leave off biting after Easter, and it was the last of the soft
nights. You know the rain that come last week? Well, it started
next night and we was out in it all. We was
miserable&mdash;drenched an' wet an' cold, in spite of a fire we
had under the lee of the log. Dotty rigged a sort of a fly between
the log and two saplings that stood near it&mdash;did it with one
of his blankets and piece of clothes line he'd thieved from
somewhere. Thieved 'em for me to hang meself with, I suppose, if I
felt that way. But the blanket sagged and leaked worse than the sky
did, so I had to take it down to keep us from bein' drowned as well
as froze.</p>

<p>"The weather held up a bit to let in the daybreak, and Dotty
built the fire and I had a sleep, crouched up against the log. When
I woke Dotty was gone, and the rain coming on again, and I didn't
know how long I'd been unconscious. I sploshed through it all to
the station, but Dotty wasn't there, and they didn't seem like as
if Old S'Sam or anything else was missin'. They wanted me to stay
and have breakfast and dry meself at the big old fireplace; but I
told 'em I had to go and look after my mate, and they understood
<i>that.</i> One of the station hands looked up the best part of an
old oil-coat that had belonged to him, and an old canvas raincoat
that had belonged to a horse, and made me take them. When I got
back to the camp Dotty wasn't there again, and just when I was
going to give it up I seen him comin' across a creek from the old
Hay Road. He had a real waterproof tent-fly that he'd borrowed from
some civilised blacks&mdash;the last of the Hay tribe, that lived
on a corrugated iron camp across the road, towards Yanco railway
station. He said they'd lent it to him, and I believed him. You
see, Dotty doesn't lie; he either tells the truth or smiles that
vacant, idiot smile of his, and says nothing. I wondered what the
blacks thought of Dotty; and to have done with that, when we
returned the fly on our way here, Dotty and the old king and queen
grinned at each other a treat. Perhaps he could talk some of their
lingo and sing the songs of their childhood&mdash;songs he'd learnt
in <i>his</i> first childhood.</p>

<p>"Well, Dotty fixed the fly and cooked breakfast between showers.
He built up a roaring fire that held its own in spite of the rain
that got at it, and what with the wind and the fire he got the
blankets dry. Next he kept throwing hot coals and ashes under the
fly, and sweeping 'em off. Then he pulled down a lot of boughs when
it held up a bit, and beat the wet out of 'em against a tree, and
dried 'em out against the fire; and we spread the old horse rug and
oil-coat on them and made a good camp-bed. We'd kept the bread and
flour and things dry in the burnt out hollow at the bottom of an
old tree, an' we drank hot tea and lay on our backs on a dry bed
and under dry blankets, and didn't care for nothing nor
nobody&mdash;at least, I didn't; I had a book to read. And, if he
didn't <i>feel</i> it, Dotty <i>looked</i> as happy as if he'd
thieved Heaven.</p>

<p>"Dotty had got some wire fence posts from a pile up the river
bank and stacked them to the side of me, away from the fire, to
make it warmer and keep the wind off. And, to make us feel more
happy and comfortable, the rain and the wind came on like they did
the night before. But <i>we</i> were all right so long as the wind
stayed in that quarter. A station hand rode up, between the
rainstorms, in a big oilskin overcoat, with the tail of it spread
out on his horses's rump, and bent down on his horse's neck and
said 'Day, mates. It's a wet day.' Dotty pointed to the billy of
tea on the coals and jerked his thumb up to where there was a pint
pot upside-down on the log. The station hand said 'Thank yer' and
got down from his horse, and Dotty reached him the sugar bag and he
had some tea. The station hand's wet sheepdog came up, too, and
shook himself on the other side of the fire; then he dodged round
closer to us, and laughed at us in a friendly way. The station hand
stood by the fire for a while; then he scratched the back of his
head with his little finger, and said 'So-long' and got on his
horse and rode off and his dog went after him.</p>

<p>"Nobody else come to see us except an old magpie. Dotty threw it
a bit of meat and so startled it that it jumped away&mdash;it'd
thought Dotty was asleep. It swore at Dotty; and then it snatched
up the meat and flew off with it. By and by it come back and cursed
Dotty some more an' woke me; so Dotty threw it another bit of meat,
and it swore its thanks and flew away with that, too. I suppose it
wanted that bit for its wife and kids. Anyway it come back again
and had a last piece comfortably by itself on the dry ground by the
fire after cursing Dotty and all his family, good and hard, for
about two minutes. It said Dotty was a foundling, or something
such&mdash;like any other real bushman does when he meets an old
mate unexpected after some years.</p>

<p>"I heard that all the wild magpies were half tame round Leeton
until young civil-servant Gawps came round bangin' off guns at 'em.
I've seen one of them fancy fishermen la-di-dahs down there by the
river shoot a bird like a curlew and break its leg. There was a
strong barb wire and netted fence between 'em, so he couldn't get
at what he'd shot. But the bird kept hopping round on one leg, with
his face towards us all the time, screamin' out, for all the world,
'Now&mdash;see&mdash;what&mdash;yer&mdash;done!'
'Now&mdash;see&mdash;what&mdash;yer&mdash;done!'
'Now&mdash;see&mdash;what&mdash;yer&mdash;done!' till his mates
come an' got him away.</p>

<p>"Well, to get on with it. The rain and wind come on with the
night, worse 'n' the first night; but the wind still held in the
right quarter for us&mdash;as if all the winds in the Southern
World lived there an' was goin' up to blow all the Japs outer the
North o' Queensland. But we was as snug as two rugs in a
bug&mdash;what yer grinnin' at?&mdash;an' I slept well. Till
something woke me. Ver know how something wakes yer&mdash;anywhere
in Australia; whether in the bosom of your family, when a child
gets sick in the night, or in the bush, or in quid. The rain had
cleared at midnight, as it does at midday in Sydney mostly, and it
was broad moonlight, and all was still. But Dotty was gone agen. I
reckoned, maybe, he mighter gone with that old magpie of his, to
look after his red cow an' calf, 'n' inquire how they was gettin'
on, an' whether they'd found a warm gully outer the wind to sleep
in. So I give it best, an' stood up an' stretched meself, an' put
some more limbs on the fire, an' turned round an' took in the
scenery.</p>

<p>"The tourists never see the Murrumbidgee as it is; they never
see it even in the mountains above Burrinjuck, nor below it
either&mdash;except perhaps at Gunidagai or Narrandera or Hay.
Where they do see it it's like pictures of the Upper Darling at
Bourke except for the river timber; and that grows tall and
straight and sound mostly. But down here it's the oldest river in
the world, in the oldest bush. Them knotted an' gnarled an' stunted
an' twisted old Birnam-wood witch-trees have been burnt out in a
hundred bush fires, an' rotted in a hundred floods; but they won't
die&mdash;except where the fire has burnt 'em down, or the floods
have undermined 'em an' the river drowned 'em an' poisoned 'em with
slime an' mud. But you've been there, an' you know."</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. The Green Lady</h2>

<p>"Right opposite to that camp we had on the Murrumbidgee, but a
bit lower down, there's a sort of island with a tree right in the
middle of the river," my friend Previous Convictions told me. "It's
greener than anything anywhere around. It doesn't seem to belong to
Australia at all. The tree and the little island seem all one; the
island must be matted roots an' moss mostly, and it's bin through
an' under God knows how many floods. The whole thing looks like a
lady, dressed just as yer mother used to dress in the 'seventies or
the 'eighties&mdash;bonnet and bustle, full-back skirt an' all,
just leanin' forward an' glidin' up the river. They call her the
Green Lady, and she's always glidin' up the stream. The faster the
current runs the faster the Green Lady seems to glide. While all
other trees are dark, with black shadders, there she is, green in
the moonlight, gliding up the river, and seeming more anxious than
ever to get there, as if she had a son in trouble up somewhere at
the head of it.</p>

<p>"I'd turned in; but just as it seemed I was droppin' off there
was sounds&mdash;or, rather, one great sound. It seemed to me at
first as if it was the Sydney Town Hall organ playin' an' all the
kids round Darling Harbour singin'. I thought, for the moment, that
my mate Dotty had thieved the Heavenly Choir, or the other one, or
both, an' brought 'em to entertain me. I sat up quick, and the
sound went. I crawled from under the tent-fly and knelt up and
looked over the log that was protectin' us from the weather, but
there was nothing there, except the everlasting old haunting of the
Bush in the moonlight. So I stood up. The wind had changed to
another quarter, an' it was blowin' quite warm. The moon went under
some of the bluey-white clouds that was flyin' home&mdash;like kids
that had frightened 'emselves tellin' ghost yarns. An' I heard a
man's voice&mdash;it seemed like a mad preacher's voice. I jumped
round like a party polotician that smells dissolution. The moon
popped out from behind the flying kiddy clouds, an' I looked along
the steep clay bank. There was Dotty, standin' halfway down near
the water, on the steep clay bank, on a sort of ledge we'd dug to
fish from, clear in ther moonlight."</p>

<p>Previous Convictions paused awhile and seemed to think of it as
if in a vague way he didn't approve of it.</p>

<p>"It was Dotty all right," he continued, "Dotty standing there on
that clay ledge above the river that was full of black snags in the
moonlight. But the voice wasn't Dotty's, an' the man, to look at
him, wasn't Dotty. Either he was&mdash;well, he was another man and
was raving; an' the worst of it was it was <i>sane</i> ravin'. He
was standin' up straight, facing across the river to the Green
Lady, and wavin' his arms and ravin' to her. He was ravin' about
his ruined life and his wrongs and woman's devilment and
lies&mdash;most of the things I knew about him and a good many I
didn't. He raved about his life before he was married, and his
family, and his wife, and the other man. He raved about relations
who spread lies, and he cursed all neighbours who listen to them,
and all smug, comfortable magistrates who listen to <i>them,</i>
and who send innocent men to gaol and starvation and disgrace, and
drive them to drink and madness. And he cursed all soft,
good-natured fools of husbands; though I don't know what he did
<i>that</i> for.</p>

<p>"And the Green Lady didn't say anything, but kept gliding,
gliding up the river as if she was in a hurry to get past; but all
the other crooked old witch-trees up on the level seemed to wave
their broken, blackened arms and ragged fingers an' sing an' curse
an' rave too.</p>

<p>"I sat down on a broken limb of the log, about knocked up, an'
took me head in me hands. If that was Dotty sane, I'd rather have
him dotty. It was a lot worse than the nights when he pinched the
garden chair and the mat and the stained-glass angel for me to
furnish a stable with.</p>

<p>"What with worry, and want of rest and sleep, and sheer funk,
there were so many sounds and voices in my head that I didn't
notice, for a minute or two, that Dotty's new mad voice had
stopped. As soon as I noticed it I jumped up, and couldn't see
Dotty anywhere. I thought he'd gone into the river and down with
it. And then there came to me a new, cold, sudden
terror&mdash;swift as they say things come to a drownin' man. You
know what it would look like to come away from a place like that in
the bush without yer mate!</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was the worry an' want of rest, and the guilty
knowledge of me old criminal tendencies; but it was worse than all
me old previous convictions put together, with a charge of
housebreakin' an' manslaughter thrown in, and detectives standin'
across the street lookin' as innercent as fourteen Chinamen outside
a fantan an' opium joint. An' here, of all times, them lines of
'Gilrooney', the outback poet, came ringin' in me ears:</p>

<p class="poem">'Twas Murderin' Mick who killed his mate between
the dawn an' day;<br>
He cut his throat from ear to ear, and left him where he lay.<br>
'Twas Murderin' Mick that came to wear a queer white cap at
morn,<br>
An' ne'er before in Goulburn Gaol was cap so lightly worn.<br></p>

<p>"I had a mad thought that I saw that cap, an' wondered how it
would fit me. I even felt it over me ears, with an elastic-band
under 'em&mdash;an' the band seemed to hurt more than the rope did.
No, <i>I</i> don't want to wear a queer white cap at morn, or any
other time, for that matter; and I don't think I'd wear it lightly,
neither, for Dotty nor no one else&mdash;no matter how much
<i>he</i> deserves it.</p>

<p>"But, just as I was sliding down the steep bank to the
river&mdash;whether with an idea of savin' Dotty from drownin' an'
me from ther gallows, or, failin' that, drownin' meself for the
same reason, I don't know&mdash;but just then I seen a bunyip or
something heave itself inter the mud, an' Dotty comes climbin' up
the bank on three legs, with a fish in the other. He'd been down
attending to the lines, and got a fish off one of 'em. Either his
mad-sane fit had passed or it was all a dream.</p>

<p>"Dotty put the fish in an old kerosene-tin half-full of water
that he kept for the purpose. He reckoned it was cruel to string
'em through the gills and mouth on a reed or string or piece of
wire, and hang 'em from a branch or let 'em die slow in the dust
and dirt. No&mdash;he kept 'em alive an' as happy as they could be
till he was ready to clean 'em. Poor Dotty never knew how he got
<i>me</i> in the gills sometimes.</p>

<p>"I turned in an' slept till the sun was up amongst the
tree-trunks, bright an' white an' hot; but Dotty had rigged boughs
to keep it off my face. He was cookin' breakfast when I woke; it
was the smell of it that woke me. (Did yer ever smell bacon or
chops cookiri' at the campfire in the mornin' when you was hungry?)
Dotty had fish and ham, and last night's bread from the station
cook. Mine was fried ham, and Dotty brought breakfast to me in bed
in an old tin plate that he'd found and straightened and polished
with ashes. He was just his same old good-natured idiotic self
again. His old red cow and calf came to the edge of the bank and
looked down at us&mdash;looked at Dotty in a mild, anxious,
motherly sort of way, as if she thought he might have been a
twin-calf that she'd forgot. Me she gave a last look of disgust and
went away."</p>

<p>Previous Convictions thought a while. Then he said: "That last
night on the river was enough for me, and I'd made up my mind to
bring Dotty away from it, whether he was a stained angel or a
stained devil or a moonstruck lunatic&mdash;whatever he was. We
went to the station to say good-bye to the ratty cook and the
good-natured station hand, and take back the old raincoats they'd
lent us; but they wouldn't have 'em, and I'm glad they wouldn't,
though they're a bit more load, for we'll want 'em on the Hay track
this winter.</p>

<p>"I forgot to tell yer the men's quarters at Yanco are in the old
homestead behind the mansion, an' the pint pots and bread and meat
and sugar are slid out fer 'travellers' in the same old hospitable
way on the big old cedar dinin'-room table, in the long old
dinin'-room with its high panelled ceilin' an' wall and deep
panelled doorways and winders, an' the cook standin' with his legs
wide apart, an' his back to the big old-fashioned fireplace,
presidin' an' beamin' like a prodigal father. He was short and
stout, with a big apron, an' looked like a sea cook, an' he was
ratty&mdash;like all station and shearers' cooks I'd ever seen. He
gave me some poetry he'd wrote about old S'Sam and got printed, and
some he'd made up about himself; and as much tucker as we'd like to
carry; and so we went back to camp to roll up our swags.</p>

<p>"A lot of magpies come round and cursed us till Dotty threw out
the rest of the meat for 'em, and they sung 'For He's a Jolly Good
Feller' as we took the track.</p>

<p>"Before we struck the road Dotty called at a little old
slab-and-iron cottage standin' by itself in a garden 'longside
McCaughey's old main irrigation canal&mdash;all full of tall reeds
now except for a narrow channel of clear water, and looking
wonderfully fresh and green. An old Irish couple lived there,
private and independent. They were old retainers, I suppose. They
seemed to have seen Dotty before this trip&mdash;perhaps in one of
his private peregrinations&mdash;and knew he was afflicted, for the
old woman crossed herself, and the old man took off his hat. It
looked as if he only took it off at other times when he went to
bed, 'n' perhaps not then. And they told us of a short cut across
the paddocks, an' pointed where to strike it. After we left them
Dotty's old magpie caught us and come with us, and nagged at us
from the top of every wire fence post for about a mile; but he took
us the short cut all right, and gave us a good, hearty affectionate
cursing at the end."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. Ducks and Other Things</h2>

<p>I had watched the Little Landlady climb the water-tower hill on
her way to the township; and when I went to the front door Previous
Convictions had already done his fade-in, as he did his fades-out,
with his everlasting swag, whose drum-like shape and constant
reappearance had puzzled me from the first. He couldn't have been
afraid of Dotty "thieving" it, for Dotty had an idea that
everything about the camp had already been thieved, and it would be
merely silly to thieve them over again, seeing there was no place
to take them to. But that was all soon to be explained.</p>

<p>Half-a-dozen Muscovy ducklings, at that stage when they really
need three pairs of legs, came round the corner of the cottage to
the front, followed by their big, old, generously-hackled
mother-hen, in a great state of agitation. They made friends with
Previous Convictions, who played seesaw with them and showed them
flies to jump at, while the old hen did something between a "Blue
Danube" waltz and a Highland fling, and fell over her feet.
Presently the ducklings went round the corner to see dog Charley,
and we heard their ridiculous and superfluous foster-mother in
dangerous hysterics there. Charley, who wanted a sleep, "womped" at
them, and they waddled away&mdash;just in time to save the old lady
going clean out of her mind.</p>

<p>"Them ducks would have been right into Dotty's hands," reflected
Previous Convictions; "he'd have got them to follow him to camp,
an' carried 'em on the track somehow, an' brought 'em up an'
educated 'em right to the stuffin' and bakin' stage. <i>He'd</i>
ha' looked after 'em all right. There's his old hat showin' out
from behind that tree along the channel there; we'd best not let
them ducklings meander that way or you'll lose some of 'em. It
would be just lovely," Previous went on, after a minute's think,
"to have to take Dotty through the township with all his ducks
waddlin' after him!</p>

<p>"But I like Muscovy ducks and Muscovy ducklings," said Previous.
"Used to rear them once, about the stables and other places. An old
Muscovy drake is the biggest two-legged brute and blackguard that
never had his neck twisted; but I like Mrs Muscovy an' the kids.
Other ducks are mischief-makers and scandalmongers. Whenever new
poultry comes in you'll see common, ordinary ducks bobbin' their
heads at each other, an gossipin', an' tellin' lies about the
newcomer, same as humans. 'Oh, I knowed all about <i>her</i> before
she came here. An' as for <i>'im'</i>&mdash;an' that sorter
thing.</p>

<p>"But Mrs Muscovy attends strictly to her own affairs. I had a
old Muscovy duck once that had a nest under some bushes between the
stable wall and the fence. When she come off her nest for
tucker&mdash;bran and pollard&mdash;she'd waddle round to the back
gate, an' if it happened to be shut she'd flap against the bars
till she made me hear somehow. Sometimes I'd climb up an' peep
through a high side window an' watch her goin' back on to her nest.
She'd come round after awhile, an' up the side way, most mysterious
like, squintin' to left an' right in case someone might be watchin'
her unbeknownst, and pretendin' she was just goin' out to the front
to see if the postman was comin'. But just when she got opposite
her nest she'd turn sharp, at right angles, and, with a flick first
of one foot an' then the other&mdash;that was to knock the dirt
off&mdash;she'd be in under the bushes and on to her eggs that
she'd left covered with down; an' no one would ever dream there was
a nest there, much less a big Muscovy duck sittin' on it.</p>

<p>"When the little ducklings first break out of their shells they
come wrigglin' home through the grass after their mother of an
evening, just like a pretty little bright-yeller snake. Later on
they're waddlers&mdash;like what yours is; an' so on up through the
flapper an' the duck to the Sairey Gamp stage. The young drakelings
mostly reach the stuffed and baked stage first, like young
roosters&mdash;Dotty'll find the stuffin' all right, somewhere and
somehow. But <i>hens&mdash;</i>well, one hen will dig up your
garden, plants an' all, quicker'n you could do it yerself; an' if
she gets into the kitchen, an you try to 'shoo' her out, she'll
scream all round and through the place like a mad young female
whirlwind, and go anywhere but out of the open window or door; and
if there's anything valuable to break she'll break it. But if
half-a-dozen ducks come into your place an' you tell 'em they've
made a mistake, they'll apologise, cheerful-like, an' go out
through the same hole they come in by, an' never do no damage at
all. And like as not one'll come back during the night an' lay an'
egg on the garden path for your breakfast to show there's no
ill-feelin'. But you gotter get up early to beat the milkman to
it.</p>

<p>"Still," said Previous philosophically, and as if he had perhaps
done somebody an injustice, "no two two-legged pullets or hens ever
act exactly alike or bring up their chickens just the same. I
knowed an old hen that'd come into the kitchen an' git up on the
dresser an' sit on the plate of breakfast eggs. You could lift her
down an' put her outside, but she'd be there again as soon as your
back was turned. She muster spent the best part of a year tryin' to
hatch out the breakfast eggs. If she got a scare when a strange man
or woman or cat or dog came to the kitchen-door, she'd tightrope
round an' fly an' flop, an' get out somehow without shiftin' as
much as a cup. So at last we left her there on a settin' of eggs,
in a proper nest in a dark corner of a big old fashioned dresser;
an' she brought up her chickens and took 'em home to the
fowl-house, an' they all grew up. She wanted to lay on the dresser
after that; but we was full up of her an' shut her up in the
fowl-house. It was no good; she screeched an' screeched all night,
just like a hysterical wife bein' held back from killin' her
husband. (''Elp, neighbours; 'elp! 'E's ill-treatin' me agen!') An'
she raked all the other hens' eggs out of the nest an' broke 'em;
and in the mornin' she was dead.</p>

<p>"But to come back to <i>your</i> ducklings. Don't you ever feel
sorry for a hen that's set on duck eggs? Look at the states of mind
she must go through! (I know&mdash;I've got me previous
convictions.) I suppose, if we'd follered 'em, we'd see your lot
tryin' to make their old lady jump into the channel after 'em now;
an' no doubt they bin doin' it all along&mdash;except when they
wanted her for a blanket in cold weather. Ah, well, it's the way of
the world!"</p>

<p>"We're goin' west to-night, Dotty an' me, along the Hay
Canal"&mdash;it was Previous Convictions who broke the silence we'd
fallen into&mdash;"so you won't see me termorrer nor yet the next
day."</p>

<p>He paused for reply, but I knew too much to express either
surprise or sorrow. Still I thought I might venture on: "Why don't
you wait and start in the morning, Previous?"</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, "the weather's warm an' fine, and travellin'
by moonlight seems to agree with Dotty&mdash;he's less restless in
camp afterwards. Besides, there's <i>some</i> interest in wakin' up
in a new camp an' seein' what the new country looks like by
daylight."</p>

<p>"How about finding the way? Besides, there's snakes about yet,
an' they might be in the new camp and not have time to get friendly
with you."</p>

<p>"Findin' the way is easy enough," said Previous. "For a start
we've got to go back six or seven miles on our old track, an' I've
got the rest mapped out. And Dotty'd find the way if I missed
it&mdash;all Dotty's sort can. As for snakes, <i>you</i> know very
well we never think of snakes when we're campin', even in snake
country, an' this isn't snake country&mdash;a snake couldn't get
down into it unless he was a drill, with an Irish navvy drivin'
him. You're on'y talkin' for the sake of talkin'."</p>

<p>Previous's reproof was called for; but I wanted to draw him out
about snakes. It wasn't hard to do.</p>

<p>"Anyway, talkin' o' snakes," Previous proceeded, "an Australian
snake is mostly a gentleman, an' we haven't any time for him, an'
he hasn't any time for such as us." (I winced.) "You keep out of
his track an' he'll keep out of yours. He takes his tucker clean
an' alive, with painless dentistry, for he fascinates it first. But
goannas now, <i>they're</i> just what they look like. There was a
wreck off Gabi, and the Allans of Mallacoota Inlet heard of some
bodies of sailors washed ashore on a beach a bit further down. It
was terrible rough country, no roads, on'y cattle tracks: si old
Dad Allan and his brother an' the eldest son took the
bullock-sledge with two young workin' bullocks they called 'the
bunyips' and scrambled through. An' when they got over the beach
where the searfarin' bodies was, the sin sings out from the top of
the point, 'Some of them's alive, Dad! Some of them's alive! I can
see them movin'!' But when they climbed down to the beach they
found that the big brutes of goannas had got at the bodies,
an'&mdash;an' that's what made them bodies seem to move. The Allans
shot every goanna they saw after that; and that's how I feel about
'em.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;to take the taste outer yer mouth&mdash;I was down on
one of them beaches once, when me previous convictions had scarcely
begun, showing a civil service Pommy round for th'
'commodation-house where I was handyman&mdash;and keepin' from
bein' round meself. It was snake country all right&mdash;real
black-with-red-brown-belly snake country. We was doin' a crawl off
the beach, round a tussock hump, to see if there was any black duck
in a fresh-water lagoon there, when we caught sight of a six-foot
black snake about a dozen yards away, just gatherin' himself up for
business. The Pommy he ups with his double-barrel
breechloader&mdash;he was a good shot. But I says, 'Hold hard,
Mister! He's in his own country an' on his own track an' we ain't.
Just wait a bit an' see what he'll do.' And the Pommy&mdash;he was
a good sort&mdash;he drops his gun; an' I'm blessed if that old
snake didn't uncoil and stretch himself&mdash;I think he
yawned&mdash;an' went, takin' it easy, over the opposite sandhill
to his missus an' kids, or whatever business he had in hand. I
could ha' sworn he waved his tail 'S'long!' while he was goin' over
the top. 'If we'd ha' shot him,' I says to the Pommy, 'his old
woman would have got us sure, either in camp ter-night or on the
track.' An' the Pommy he says, 'Pom-me-word!'&mdash;and that's how
I think the Pommies got their name.</p>

<p>"An' a carpet-snake is a gentleman, too, though he ain't
poisonous, except when he's laid up in a rotten holler log all
winter and not looked after his teeth. There was two ole maiden
sisters in a house I was once gard'ner an' milkmaid an' pony-master
to in North Sydney. They was ratty on animals&mdash;wouldn't drown
a kitten an' they'd spoil the best dog that was ever pupped. There
was a family named Ward that had a pet old Queensland carpet-snake
named Jim James, about thirty foot long, that lived in a palin' an'
wire-nettin' snake house they'd built for him. They fed him on
sparrers mostly, but were hard put to it to find him grub. Well,
th' old maidens' brother Jim come home to get ready to go to ther
war and sent 'em away on a fortnight's holiday to give him a chance
to fix up things. They had an' old cat that they <i>must</i> take;
but she had half-a-dozen weaned, nearly half grown kittens that
they couldn't take and wouldn't trust the brother to look after, so
he spoke to the Wards next door and they said <i>they'd</i> look
after the kittens. So the sisters packs up, an' hands the kittens,
very carefully, one by one, over the fence an' went away happy. You
see, they knowed nothin' about snakes an' <i>their</i> ideas of
tucker.</p>

<p>"Well, the brother took the spare bed in a back room with me
that night&mdash;we'd got chummy&mdash;and after we'd done smokin'
an' pitchin', an' 'ad dropped off dead tired, ole Jim James broke
out of his cage and come over the fence in the moonlight, an' in
through an open window over Brother Jim's bunk. He'd come to thank
him for the kittens, I suppose; but when he seen he was asleep he
went under the bunk an' coiled himself up an' wenter sleep
himself.</p>

<p>"About eight or nine o'clock in the morning there comes a
rap-rap-tap at the front door. Jim gets up and goes out to see an'
pay off the milk, but it was one of the Ward boys from next door,
with his cap in his hand.</p>

<p>"'Please, Mister,' he says, 'have yer seen anything of our
carpet? 'E's broke loose.'</p>

<p>"Jim remembered he'd felt, or dreamed he'd felt, something in in
over him in the night, so he brings the boy in to see, and they
finds Jim James under the bunk. I didn't like to interfere, so they
took Jim James out the front door an' home yard by yard. And I
heard our Jim say to the other Jim: 'Why, damn you, Jim James, if
it had been larst night week you'd have give me a of a scare!' he
says."</p>

<p>Previous got up and went to his swag and turned it on its side
and had unbuckled the straps when we heard a joyous whoop from dog
Charley at the side of the house.</p>

<p>"Go an' keep her back for a minute!" said Previous. "Send her
after the ducks."</p>

<p>I went to the back and intercepted the Little Landlady; and,
having drawn her attention to the alleged fact that the ducklings
had taken the old hen into the back channel at the far corner of
the paddock, I returned to Previous, who had his swag strapped
again and up.</p>

<p>"I've altered me mind," he said. "You've kept me too late with
your everlastin' interruptin'. I'll take Dotty back to the old
house we was campin' in at Five Bough Swamp, an' make an early
start for Hay in the mornin'."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. The Doormat</h2>

<p>I had hinted the night before to the Little Landlady that I'd
heard that the woman across the back channel wanted to buy a
setting of eggs; so she (the L.L.) fed the dogs, cats and fowls,
and got me my breakfast in record time, and then charged the plank
over the back channel and the wire-fence with the eggs in a
peggy-bag, and when I went to the front Previous Convictions was
haunting the lower verandah step like a half forgotten ghost of my
boyhood days, which keeps coming near and fading back, to come ever
nearer again as I grow older. And presently I heard a voice that
seemed to come and go from that past.</p>

<p>"We're starting now," said Previous (and I started, too, for it
sounded as if it referred to the funeral), "me and Dotty. There he
is, behind a tree, as usual." Previous pointed along the road that
ran at right angles to ours from in front of my cottage, away to
nothing and Hay, as if it were the destination of the funeral; and
I saw, showing from behind a tree, the hat and knees which, by the
way, were all that I had ever seen of Dotty.</p>

<p>"Do you, well, to be blunt, do you want any money, Previous?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"No," said Previous in his faded drawl and in nowise offended.
"And, besides, you'll be wanting all you've got, by the look of
things," (I could see no "look of things") "by the time you travel
by moonlight, like me and Dotty are going to do tonight&mdash;and
like most of your neighbours do, if all I hear is true. I save my
money, and Dotty don't know what it's good for, so I have to save
his when he earns it. I believe he's uneasy about me thinking so
much of it and bothering about carrying the stuff on the track with
me. I believe he thinks I'm going ratty over it, and, in fact, he
hinted to that effect once as well as he could. I have to take care
that Dotty don't thieve it from me and throw it in the river or
somewhere some night when I ain't lookin'. But, if Dotty doesn't
know what money is good for, I do&mdash;it's good for almost
everything except what they say it's good for.</p>

<p>"Now, I don't smoke, and that saves a lot," and Previous glanced
along the verandah-floor, where were scattered half-smoked pipefuls
of the most expensive tobacco to be got in Leeton. "And I don't
drink"&mdash;here Previous blinked meaningly at a half-filled
demijohn of beer from Narrandera under the front-room table, and
badly hidden by the tablecloth. "So I save not only the cost of the
beer, but what the drinking of it costs&mdash;and there is a big
difference between the two. Look there."</p>

<p>Previous stood up on the step, and I looked. Dotty had stood up
and moved into the centre of the road. He had always sat hunched
up, crouched low, and I now saw that he was a big man. He held his
hands, thumbs joined and palms forward, high and a little back
above his head. Then he brought them down without appearing to bend
his knees, till his finger tips touched his toes. Then he did some
sort of a double shuffle, and so on, the same over again. Next he
swung first one arm and then the other in circles and so on, all
over again. Then he did a trot round, with his fists on his chest,
but never far from the tree.</p>

<p>"What on earth is he doing?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Can't you see?" said Previous with a touch of selfishness.
"He's training for a fight. Sometimes he does it for an hour every
morning for days together. When he gets at it in or near townships
we pass through, I tell the local gawks he gathers round him that
he's training for a big fight in a new and natural way with a rough
life on a long straight track; and some of 'em want to feel Dotty
and take him in and shout for him, and the big 'uns with beer
inside, who fancy they can use their hands, try to get the money
put up and have a go with him. Yes, I could make money on Dotty. I
told you about the ex-senior-sergeant in North Sydney telling me
that Dotty was a first-class amateur boxer, and now I'm always
afraid of him getting one of those flashes of
sanity&mdash;<i>you</i> know what I mean" (here Previous cocked a
most felonious eye up at me) "and taking on one of those big gawks.
God help the man that ruined Dotty's life&mdash;and a big brute of
a blond he was&mdash;if Dotty ever meets him and remembers with the
shock of the sight of him, and goes in for the fight he's been
training for off and on these six or seven years. But then," he
reflected, the reflection of a ruined man himself, "when you meet
those sort of men afterwards they're generally so wrecked and done
for that they're a shock for you instead of you being a shock for
them, and you feel more inclined to pity the abject lice than to
kill 'em. I meself&mdash;but never mind that.</p>

<p>"Never mind Dotty; he'll have a rest presently, and, anyway, he
wouldn't surprise your neighbours if they did see him. They've been
too much stupefied by the results of Royal Commissions and them
sort of things to be surprised at anything&mdash;and
waitin'&mdash;waitin'&mdash;waitin'. God, how we waited
<i>then&mdash;you</i> and me!"</p>

<p>And presently the voice of Previous Convictions went on as of
old. You couldn't call it a drawl&mdash;I don't know what to call
it. I haven't got a note of music in me&mdash;nor the other
thing.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I was talking about just now?" asked Previous,
half-persuasively, half-dreamily; and I didn't see the trap.</p>

<p>"Yes, Previous," I said, "perfectly," still a little dazed.</p>

<p>Previous faded into an upright position.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you was a liar before, 'Arry," he said, "because
I don't know what I was talking about myself." And perhaps he
didn't. Hypnotism or&mdash;what? He had dropped back naturally into
the vernacular; but this was the first time he had been so
familiar. He was on the second step, and now he stepped down and
went to his swag. He touched it over onto its side with his lower
leg, unbuckled and cast off the harness and gave the swag a
practised touch with his foot that sent it unrolling to its full
length; and there it lay, a bush or outback camp-bed ready made but
for the gum-leaves or mulga branches under it. From under the
little pile of best clothes, spare shirt and so on; and in the
heart of the swag, the neatly-sewn little canvas "pocket"
containing letters and portraits, the relics of his ruined life
(why do men carry these things about with them?), and the whole
forming a pillow at night for the world-tired head. From under his
pillow Previous dexterously slipped a beautifully clean and
neatly-made little rope-yarn doormat, something less than two feet
long by eighteen inches wide, and fully two inches thick in all.
And <i>this</i> accounted for the dumpiness of his swag.</p>

<p>"I made that coming out," said Previous. ("You remember when we
were 'on mats' in Darlinghurst Gaol? It saved us from goin' silly.)
I used the top wire of fences and saplings for frames and finished
off on the floors and tables I rigged up in old houses we camped
in. I had a sail-needle and plenty of twine, and so I made the
sail-needle blood-hot in the charcoal and beat it out straight and
narrower for a mat-needle. Dotty borrowed all the rope I wanted and
unravelled it, and did most of the plaiting. He borrowed a pair of
shears to trim off. He'd been 'on mats' himself; you remember I
told you. The best piece of rope he borrowed was nearly new, from a
shallow well at a pub&mdash;at least, I seen the yardman fishing
for it in the bottom of the well with a piece of clothesline, and
bent fencing-wire while we was passing, comin' away."</p>

<p>In the centre of the mat were the letters I.B. (the Little
Landlady's initials) in some dark-red or brown colour. "I'll tell
you about that some other time&mdash;no, I'll tell you now," said
Previous. "We don't know anything about some other time. There was
an old Horse that belonged to a selection back on the back track
that got his leg smashed by the limb of a burnt out tree falling on
it while he was spread out dreaming of the Cups he didn't win; and
he had to be killed. I shot him, in fact, with an old carbine the
selector had, for no one else had the heart to do it&mdash;the old
moke had been in the family so long. So, while they were hiding
behind the house and shed so as not to see the last kicks of old
Geddup, I got a funny fancy. You know how Mrs Byrnes was always
ratty on animals&mdash;bringing mangy mongrels and cats in from the
street to soap and sulphur and feed them? (You used to get mad
about it.) And how she'd interfere about a jibbing rogue-horse
being touched up, and make the innocent driver jumpin' mad, too?
Well, I dipped a bundle of sail-twine in this horse's blood, and
that's how I got the colour of those letters on that mat. They
won't wear out till the mat wears out."</p>

<p>He lifted the mat and came right up the steps on to the verandah
for the first time. He laid the mat down in front of the door,
reverently, it seemed; and it seemed to me that he bowed the shade
of an old fashioned bow.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "that will pay Mrs Byrnes for some of the
cigarettes I thieved from her when she had the refreshment rooms,
an' help pay her for her kindness to us half grown hooligans
afterwards." (Previous had hypnotised himself into the fancy that
he had been a mixture of the Artful Dodger and Fagin in his young
days, whereas the Tom Pinch characters were more in poor little
Previous Convictions's line. Indeed, according to the Little
Landlady, she had experienced help and kindness, and some real
protection from real larrikins of the old "Push" Previous had
belonged to.)</p>

<p>He stepped down to the gravel walk, rolled up his swag and
harnessed it to the last bucklehole; slung it up and the tucker
bag, and made a start. I walked with him to the gate. He gave me a
hand as he might offer his defensive shoulder, but I felt, for the
first time, a grip that sent a thrill through me, and a feeling
that it was a hand that could strike out strongly to save the
drowning, lift a bar bully off his feet and lay him quiet on his
back on the floor of the bar where he deserved to be&mdash;a hand
that could guide a man-killer horse through storm and rough country
on a life or death ride&mdash;or a ride for the sake of the Family
Name&mdash;as I, the writer, did, ah, many years ago!</p>

<p>Previous picked up Dotty, who mounted a swag that seemed
ridiculously small considering his bulk and thieving propensities,
and they went on the long road to the Hay Canal, across which the
red dust storms were still prevalent, Previous's swag seeming more
<i>like</i> a swag now that it was lightened of its little load of
reparation and gratitude; and Previous's shoulders bearing, I hope,
a lighter load of previous convictions.</p>

<p>The last big dust storm closed behind them like side drawn
curtains on a stage, opened again (as for applause), closed and
opened, and closed yet a third time, a heavy, dull-red curtain that
opened to reveal them no more that year.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. The Last Rose of Winter</h2>

<p>I climbed on to my verandah and dropped into a canvas
deck-chair, dead tired and comfortably and happily mined for the
fifteenth or twentieth time; and the Little Landlady brought out a
cup of tea and some bread and butter and put them on a neat little
deal table that I'd finished and stained that morning and wanted to
admire at intervals till dark, in my hours of leisure and
insolvency&mdash;which were mainly because of demijohns of beer
from Narrandera (a pretty but sinful township outside the
prohibition area), and, in winter, bottles of good prohibition
whisky bought from our favourite sly-grogress&mdash;and also good
fishing on the Murrumbidgee, behind old Sam McCaughey's
mansion&mdash;all shared with my old mate, Jim Grahame. The
sly-grogress might bright her wholesome face and generous figure
into my disrespectful yarns later on. There was a day and a night
of trouble when sly grog wasn't needed, but the big heart and
practical, motherly commonsense (also the wide knowledge of police
methods and ways of circumventing them) of the woman who sold it
was wanted very sorely indeed. And whatever gods happened to be
around sent her along in due course.</p>

<p>And so I sat and smoked. The weather was still cool, and the
retreating first red dust storm of summer might have been likened
to a distant hill of reddened snow, touched by a rising or setting
sun. From round by the chimney at the end of the house I heard the
thudding of dog Charley's hind elbow while he was in earnest quest
of the first flea of summer. Along one end of my front verandah was
a vine of "winter roses"&mdash;a small red rose of the baby kind.
The last one was close to the end verandah post, and she seemed to
be peeping out fearfully at the signs of the coming summer that was
to kill her and fade her away like Previous Convictions. At the
quick thought of the name&mdash;and it sounded sharp and
loud&mdash;a something (you have all felt it at times) from the
hair of my head to the balls of my toes, with a wrenching jerk in
it, told me that something, and a change, was coming. And coming
<i>now.</i></p>

<p>The little man turned briskly in through the front gate, and the
big man followed him. Previous Convictions was a changed man. He
had the manner of a small building contractor (say in the repairing
line) who had come, a little late, to start his men on a new job;
but only to get them off his mind to make room for more important
business. His whole manner indicated that he had opened an account
in the Bank of Determination. He came right up the steps and on to
the verandah, and left Dotty standing at the lower step. Previous
shook hands quickly, as though it was a most unnecessary
performance and rather silly, but had to be done with.</p>

<p><i>"Mister</i> Lawrence," he said, "this is Mr
Dotterell&mdash;or 'Dotty'&mdash;I told you all about; an' now yer
introduced. You ain't seen him before, except his hat. Now I'm
going in to see Mrs Byrnes&mdash;you two can get acquainted." He
went to the door, and I heard the Little Landlady's squeal of
pleasure: "Oh! Mr&mdash;Mr Smith! Come in!" So Smith was Previous's
real name, and the hesitation was because she had last known him as
a boy, or young man, and was used to addressing him by his
Christian name. The pleasure was because no one ever visited us
except Jim, and, as the lady of the Sub-Inspector for Sanitary Pans
had not yet sent in her card, we expected no one else.</p>

<p>Dotty (or Mr Dotterell) came up on to the verandah and shook
hands comfortably. I indicated a home-made stool by my side, and he
christened it with his weight. It didn't give a sigh, and I felt
abstractedly satisfied with my handiwork. It was my turn to be
vague and feel shadowy. Dotty was, as I hinted, a big man. He had
taken off his famous (in these stories) hat; but, as he came up the
garden path I had noticed the hat was turned up in front, instead
of behind, something after the Napoleon fashion; so I had a good
view of his face at all angles. It might have been that of Napoleon
in a kindly, humorous mood&mdash;if Napoleon had one. Dotty didn't
have a low nothing-to-speak-of forehead, as I had fancied at first
from glimpses of the tilt of his hat from behind trees. It was high
and wide and naturally bald well back, and his hair was light or
fair. He had light blue eyes with the expression of a contented,
easygoing fat boy and a touch of the quizzical or whimsical about
them. <i>And Dotty had dimples in his cheeks!</i> On the whole, he
had that lovable expression of a bushman admiring his mate making a
giddy angora of himself in a friend's house or on a pub verandah.
To sum up, his whole manner and bulk, as I noted later, sitting
down or rising up or looming in or out of a door, suggested nothing
but tolerant good nature towards the works of man&mdash;or whatever
gods there be.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr Lawrence," said Dotty, "I've heard a lot about you
from Preve, and"&mdash;with his tolerant smile&mdash;"I suppose
he's told you all about me." The voices of Previous and the Little
Landlady went on in the front room.</p>

<p>The Little Landlady: "And to think...after all these
years...your father...and did I forget to thank you for the
doormat!" (She had already thanked him a couple of times); but
<i>how did she know who made it! I</i> often wonder how much she
really <i>does</i> know.</p>

<p>The voices faded back into the kitchen&mdash;I suppose the move
was engineered by Previous for some reason. And Dotty (I must stick
to the old name) went on:</p>

<p>"A year or two ago I got a knock from a truck in the shunting
yards at Goulburn, and when I came out of the hospital
I'd&mdash;well, I'd lost my memory. Then Preve got hold of me and
brought me out here on the Hay line, thinking it might do me some
good. I got another shake up at Hay, stopping a runaway horse in a
sulky (so Preve says), and when I came out of hospital there my
memory was all right again." Here a momentary shade half shifted
the smile that wouldn't come off. "The only things that bother me
are the dates in the newspapers; but the doctors say that that will
wear off&mdash;and, now, I seem to have seen you before&mdash;like
sometimes I seem to have seen other things before. But, bother it!
The doctors said I mustn't bother over those silly things or I'll
lose my memory again." And Dotty started to talk about the soil and
fruit trees on my block.</p>

<p>Dog Charley, being loosened against orders, came round, and,
sqatting down in front of Dotty, laid his chin firmly and decidedly
on his knee, and looked up at him with his brown eyes till a big
hand came round on to his head. But Charley, in spite of his "big,
faithful brown eyes", was a fraud, a humbug and a felon. He was a
fowl-killer and a horse-chaser. He'd run the milkboy and my own
personal friends off the block; if they had "fresh" or "skittish"
horses, he'd heel 'em for them. And he'd welcome the debt
collector, and tell him not to go; that I <i>wasn't</i> out, that I
was somewhere round at the back and would be pleased to see him;
and he'd lead him round. After a while Charley went for his run,
and to see what mischief he could get up to. And I went on studying
Dotty.</p>

<p>Dotty spoke very well; but that goes for nothing in the Bush or
Outback. I've known sons to speak with no trace of the vernacular,
who had had no education except in a bush school, where the young
teacher often said "Don't do that no more", and whose father and
mother said "seen" for see, and never sounded the "g" in words that
end in "ing". Call it "throw-back", or perhaps working associations
with an educated mate or mates who hadn't fallen into the
vernacular yet. Dotty's favourite expressions were: "Now that you
come to look at it", and "As the saying is"&mdash;or
"goes"&mdash;and <i>"He's</i> all right".</p>

<p>While Dotty was on soil and fruit trees I was thinking back (or
stationary). At last I had a brain wave. He had only regained his
memory <i>up to the date of the accident in the shunting yards,
six</i> or seven years since, and thought that that was only a year
or two back. That accounted for his reference to the "dates in the
newspapers" which "bothered him", and made me fear that he was "not
right" yet; and his reference to seeming to remember and "see
things". Otherwise I'd never have <i>dreamed</i> of thinking that
he was not cheerfully and permanently sane.</p>

<p>Just then the Little Landlady and Previous came round the corner
to the front; he'd been out pretending to take an interest in her
infernal hens. Dotty was introduced and loomed above her in a
protecting way; like as if she was a chicken, or a flower, he might
tread on.</p>

<p><i>"Dotterell!" said</i> Previous, with emphasis on the name.
"Go with Mrs Byrnes, and she'll show you round", and they went
round to the back.</p>

<p>Previous sat down on the stool and leaned towards me and spoke
quickly and even excitedly&mdash;for him.</p>

<p>"Yes. Dotty's all right; but he only remembers back to where he
got the bump in the shunting yards an' went dotty. He don't know
he's a married man with a grown-up married daughter&mdash;and maybe
he's a grandfather&mdash;and I don't want him to remember. I'd
rather have him the old Dotty. The doctor in Hay thought his talk
about dates was a new thing that came of his new shake up; 'n'
would pass off like any other new thing. I didn't tell 'em any
different. It might have put someone on the track of who <i>I</i>
was&mdash;or both of us, for that matter&mdash;and me old previous
convictions and Dotty's madness. It wouldn't have done us any good.
Doctors can't be expected to know everything. They seldom know
what's behind&mdash;one of them told me that that's the worst of it
in some cases they're trying to save. They don't know what's
behind. The day we got into Hay there was a horse bolted with a
sulky. There was a woman with two children in it. The woman threw
the children out as they came along. The horse come straight for
our camp on the river bank and then swerved amongst the saplings,
and then 'Dotty' got it. It was all over in no time. In the first
flash I had a mad, silly idea that Dotty was going to thieve the
horse and sulky and woman and all. She'd have been the frozen limit
all right. If he'd started thievin' women and bringin' 'em to camp,
I'd have <i>had</i> to leave him. Ther woman jumped clear and run
back to the kids; but Dotty got mixed up with the horse and sulky
and a sapling, and, I think, an end of a shaft that had got broken
swung round and gave him a clip on the head; and that's what laid
him out. The horse went away and got the other shaft on one side of
another sapling and himself on the other, and then he gave it up
and stood there looking surprised. By the time I'd got Dotty on his
back, with a swag under his head, and got some water from the river
and a towel from my swag, the woman had come back with her husband
and kids, and a lot of others. The kids hadn't been hurt a
scratch&mdash;but them sort of things are always happening in the
bush. The woman was a big, bony woman&mdash;a regular bushwoman,
and her husband a little, mild man. She went for him first because
there hadn't been room for him in the sulky, what with the kids and
groceries and things. She wanted to know who he thought was going
to pay for the broken shaft. He'd been going to have a lift home
with a neighbour, and he looked as if he was sorry he hadn't gone
sooner. Then this woman nagged the kids a bit and gave one of 'em a
clip&mdash;for getting his pants torn, I s'pose. Then she turned
her attention to Dotty&mdash;and she looked as if she'd half-a-mind
to give him a clout, too, to bring him to his senses. When she saw
that he wasn't in a hurry to come to, she made 'em put him into a
cart that was there and told her husband to get up and hold his
head&mdash;in case Dotty might bolt too, perhaps; and then she put
the children up and went ahead, and after she'd straightened up her
hair and hat a bit, she caught hold of the front of end of a big,
bony horse that was in the cart and led him off to the hospital or
doctor's or somewhere. Someone said that that horse had been asleep
for years. I s'pose she knowed where she was goin'. I heard her say
that all men were 'sich &mdash;&mdash; fools' (she said the full
word).</p>

<p>"She must have made up her mind to stay in town for the night
with her sister or someone&mdash;those sort of bushwomen all have
sisters, but they're mostly smaller and milder and more good
lookin'&mdash;for she sent her husband round to the hospital once
or twice to find out how Dotty was. And, in the coil of the
evening, after Dotty had come to whatever senses he had, she came
round herself, with some fruit of some sort and three or four big
new handkerchieves from the store and a big blue workman's shirt
with a collar on&mdash;like the likes of us used to wear in gaol,
or the reception house. <i>Those</i> are the sort of things you
need in hospital. She was a hard, practical woman, this one was.
She asked Dotty if there was anything more he wanted in a tone of
voice like she might say, 'Anything more while the shop's open?'
but, of course she didn't mean it that way at all. She stood up and
hovered over Dotty a bit, and then she sat down again as if she was
too tired to go yet. She had a long, gaunt, bony face, something
after the style of the old cart horse she'd led, and tired,
patient, red-brown eyes like his too. Dotty might have reminded her
of a brother, or someone belonging to her who had died long ago,
for I saw three or four big rusty-looking tears roll down her long
cheeks and heard 'em drop on the floor. But she might only have
been thinking of some milkers she'd lost last
drought&mdash;<i>you</i> know what that's like?&mdash;or she could
have sent Dotty fresh milk on horseback every morning."</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"I turned to the window and looked out for a while," Previous
Convictions went on, "and when I turned back again she was
blundering out of the hospital, half blind like&mdash;as if she'd
just left a dead child there. But she said to one of the nurses,
sharp like, <i>'Which is</i> the way out of this?' I wondered how
many years it was since she'd cried last."</p>

<p>I was back in a sorrowful past, and it seemed as if a Shade
stood by and over me. The shade of a tall woman. Previous had drawn
the picture of one of our mothers. His silence roused me.</p>

<p>"And what next, Previous?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought you was dead!" said Previous softly. "Well, when
Dotty came out of hospital he got a convenient job about the
irrigation works on the Hay Canal for being a hero, and I got a job
about the principal pub and stables for being a
teetotaller&mdash;and looking like an idiot. Idiots always get them
sort of jobs in country towns; but they're mostly good natured in a
way, and sometimes they say wise things&mdash;like Sam Weller. You
see, I know Dickens, an' a few other things besides. Well, Dotty
got pretty popular with the men. He was a good workman 'n' mate,
and he was a fair ventriloquist, and could tell a yarn; besides, he
showed them tricks in scrappin' an' wrestlin' that they'd forgotten
all about&mdash;or never heard of. We had a room at the end of the
stables where I could keep an eye on him in case he showed signs of
tryin' to remember things that I didn't want him to remember.</p>

<p>"Well, one mornin' I was scrubbin' out the passage when a big,
seedy-looking, fair-haired, blue-eyed pub-loafer from nowhere
stumbled over my bucket and started on to me. I looked up and seen
I could manage <i>him</i> easy enough, so I didn't take much notice
of his mag. He was one of those big, seedy loafers with a lot of
useless fat in folds that never looks healthy, no matter what the?
do with themselves, and their clothes always look greenery yellowy.
One of those sort that never <i>can</i> look tidy when they're
down, and their skins can never look clean; whereas a decent little
man can always manage to look clean and tidy, no matter how shabby
and hard up he is. They look and <i>sound</i> unhealthy, and I
suppose they're rotten inside and in their minds. He was flabby and
soft as mud, and his legs looked too small and wobbly for his big
ugly body. He seemed to have no stern to speak of. He had the
ugliest scar I'd ever seen down the middle of his left cheek as if
some woman had hit him with the blunt blade of a tomahawk and
shifted the outer half of that cheek further west and down on to
his jaw. She'd made an untidy job of it, like an amateur butcher;
so the doctors couldn't sew it up properly. He was still blundering
over me and trying the bully (I knew him for a coward from the
first) while I was mopping up the water when Dotty himself appeared
at the back door. <i>He'd</i> come across from the channel behind
to get a cup of tea in the kitchen. He was all right there. Dotty
stood awhile leaning against the doorpost and looked on and
listened. Then the old, good-humoured smile slipped from his face,
and there was another face there. He came into the passage and
touched the big, fat pub-loafer on the shoulder, and when he turned
round Dotty jerked his thumb towards the bar. The loafer nodded,
quick for him, and started to blunder in at once. He thought Dotty
wanted him to have a drink. I looked in to see what would happen.
There was a good few chaps in the bar. The loafer-bully didn't wait
for Dotty&mdash;in case he might change his mind, I suppose. He
lumbered right across the floor and breasted the bar&mdash;or,
rather, <i>bellied</i> it. Dotty walked after him and put a hand on
his shoulder and swung him round, so the? were face to face. I saw
the big loafer go limp all of a sudden, like a poleaxed bullock.
Then his face seemed to turn greeny white. Dotty put the other hand
on the other shoulder and looked at him, reflective like. Then
Dotty took that hand away and touched a pimple on the loafer's nose
and looked at his finger afterwards. He took that bar-bummer's chin
between his thumb and forefinger and looked at his teeth. It was
easy, because the bounder's jaw had fallen already as far as it
could fall. Dotty told him, friendly like, that his teeth needed
attendin' to. Then he swung him round and had a good look at the
back of his neck. Then he seemed to lose patience with
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'You oughter wash behind your ears,' says Dotty. 'They look as
if they haven't been attended to since Christmas,' Dotty sez. An'
Dotty walked him to the door and gave him a boost with his knee and
a shove with his hands at the same time that sent him stumbling
right over the verandah edge and the gutter to the water-trough,
where he fetched up, with his spindle legs at their widest apart,
like a puppet's, or wooden doll's; and his hands wide apart, too,
holding on to the edge of the trough and staring down&mdash;as if
he was seeing things in the water. They were dirty things, I reckon
now. Then he moved along to the hose-rail and threw up&mdash;he was
<i>very</i> sick. When I looked again his ridiculous little bandy
legs was takin' him off in the direction of the railway station at
a great rate. You'd never have thought they could have done it.</p>

<p>"Maggie, the fair, what they call 'blonde' barmaid, from Sydney,
called Dotty over to the bar. 'Come here, Mr Dotterell!' she said.
'I want yer.' (It was a name I'd made for him, like he christened
me 'Mylott'&mdash;an' it is my lot too.) And when she found he
wouldn't have even a lemonade, she reached her arms out and pulled
his head down and kissed him&mdash;and they all clapped hands, and
those that was sittin' down they stamped on the floor. Then Maggie
went red as fire, and Dotty run against the passage door jamb and
went out with a face redder'n Maggie's. But Dotty went to our room
and got his towel, and went to the tank stand where there was tin
dishes and soap, and washed his hands and face before he went back
to work. He dusted his knee, too. But <i>I've</i> got nothing
against Maggie.</p>

<p>"And now comes the funny part of it. I saw the fat crook on the
railway station next day, standing just inside the doorway of the
station master's office and looking left and right, as if the
police was after him. As soon as the train backed up, he lumbered
to a second class carriage, pulled the door open, and stumbled in.
The last I seen of him was his damaged pig's cheek showing round
the window frame as the train went. He'd got a ticket
somehow&mdash;perhaps the boys made a collection to get rid of
him&mdash;or the police got him a ticket. (But I found out
yesterday he went no further than <i>here.)</i> And, later on, I
got his real name from some of them, and remembered his
description, and it all dawned on me. <i>He was the man that
Dotty's wife had carried on with, and that ruined Dotty's life!</i>
And Dotty didn't recognise him&mdash;thank the Lord his new memory
skipped <i>that</i> part. But he'd recognised Dotty when Dotty
swung him round first time in the bar, and that accounted for his
fright. I think there <i>is</i> a God."</p>

<p>Charley, the dog, came round and sat down in front of Previous
and planted his chin firmly on his knee and regarded him
gravely&mdash;as if he was wondering if Previous was telling the
truth about Dotty or only lying for his sake.</p>

<p>"I missed Dotty after tea, and when I went to our stable room I
found him sitting on the bunk with his head in his hands. I asked
him what he was doing, and he said he was 'trying to remember a
face'. It turned me cold. All my previous convictions and all
Dotty's temporary insanity peered in at me from the moonlight
through every crack in the slabs of the stable. I went out and
through into the bar; all the fellows standing and sitting about
outside in the moonlight might have been plainclothes police from
Sydney, come by today's train, it seemed to me. I took Dotty a pint
of beer and made him drink it and get into his bunk. He was tired
and in splendid health, and not used to beer, so it sent him to
sleep, and he was all right in the morning.</p>

<p>"But I saw that Dotty was due for a change. He got a good letter
from his boss to the manager here and I got a first class
recommendation from <i>my</i> boss at the pub (he didn't mention
the pub&mdash;he said I'd been connected with some private
irrigation experiment of his), and a letter from Maggie to her
brother in Sydney, who was a policeman, in case I ever got into
trouble. I wondered how much <i>she</i> knew. You never know how
much a woman knows. And Maggie got all wet with tears; I heard 'em
fallin' like kangaroo shot behind the bar. I reckon they were as
genuine as the big, bony bushwoman's&mdash;and a lot cleaner and
clearer than bucketsful that our wives and widows and daughters
weep. And one of the chaps got wild&mdash;or pretended
to&mdash;because she cried into his beer. She only emptied it out
and filled it again, cluckin' and gaspin' and sobbin' and snappin'
at the chaps about nothin' we could see. No, <i>I've</i> got
nothing against Maggie.</p>

<p>"And one of the chaps got a pretty fair clout from his mate for
starting to take up a collection for Dotty's widders and
orphans&mdash;wherever they was. His mate said it served him right
for acting the goat. We got quite a send-off at the station, and
bags of fruit and tobacco and cigarettes enough to last us three
months. Poor Maggie wasn't there. I suppose she couldn't get
herself dried up in time; but she sent a message and a shirt she'd
washed and forgot to give to Dotty. They cheered us off. I suppose
you know the big breath of relief you draw at getting away from
somewhere with nothing to worry about and all your things aboard?
Somehow that shirt completed my content.</p>

<p>"We got here the day before yesterday, but I waited before I
came round. We ran into luck straight away. I got put on at the
Government stables over there, where they wanted a man. I'll be a
horse-master yet. An' Dotty got a job cutting out reeds and weeds
and Bathurst burrs on the channels. I'd made up my mind in Hay
never to be homeless again, and so I bought a good tent and fly,
and we've got a comfortable camp over there amongst the pines in
the vacant ground. I heard we've got to pay seven-and-six a week
rent, but I don't know what that's for, unless it's for the trees
and fresh air; the grounds not fit for anything, unless it's to
stand on. But the screw is good enough, and the channels bring us
all the firewood we want&mdash;plenty of bits of board and boxes. I
suppose the school-kids throw them in. Boys <i>must</i> throw
something into water if they have to walk two miles to it. Some
good timber, too, that I'll make into bunks and a camp-table and
shelves with later on. Plenty of good straw from the stables...I
wonder where Mrs Byrnes and Dotty are? Oh! here they come."</p>

<p>The Little Landlady and "Mr Dotterell" came round by the end of
the cottage and on to the verandah, and I could tell by scraps of
their conversation what had kept them so long. Dotty: "Well, Mrs
Byrnes, there's one thing about those white Leghorns,
they&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Little Landlady (the 'th repetition, I suppose): "Oh Mr
Dotterell, did I tell you I got that setting of eggs sent all the
way from my sister-in-law at Windsor&mdash;and every
egg&mdash;"</p>

<p>She asked Dotty to come into the kitchen and sit down while she
made tea, and, ignoring a polite protest from Previous, she went
through. After a while Previous remarked to me that the fowl talk
was still going on in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Next Dotty came out with tea and sandwiches on a tray and put it
on the table and went back for the other chair and a box; and we
all had tea comfortably and happily together on the verandah. When
she took the tea-things in I got out my pipe, and so did Dotty,
somewhat to my surprise. I'd fancied he'd always been a
non-smoker.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I started smoking again in hospital. I'd left
it off in the shunting yard. The doctors encouraged it."</p>

<p>Daylight was dying. Dotty had slipped down into his old place on
the verandah steps, perhaps because it was cooler there on account
of the draught under the house, and he seemed to have partly faded
back into his old vagueness. He had his head down and his defensive
shoulder up; and, when he let that down he was unsubstantially
smoking a short clay pipe. Both pipe and smoker seemed dimly of the
past. Perhaps he smoked to please Dotty, or to keep him
company&mdash;lest he'd remember. A smoker, when he leaves his
pipe, must be troubled deeply indeed.</p>

<p>Once I half-noticed Dotty get up and move along to the end of
the verandah post, and stand there, a little Shade looking at the
rose. When we had seen them off and turned back I noticed that the
little rose, which should have been peeping redly at the afterglow
from behind the verandah post, was gone; and it gave me sudden
uneasiness and sharp apprehension&mdash;on Dotty's account.</p>

<p>I mentioned the matter delicately to Previous afterwards.</p>

<p>"No, Dotty didn't thieve it," he said with conviction. "I asked
him, too, to test him like, and his face went nearly like it went
that time in the Hay pub. I half thought, for a minute, he might
clout me. He wanted to know if I thought he was a
sneak-thief&mdash;let 'lone a last flower from the best little
woman he ever came across. So I thieved the rose."</p>

<p>"You! Previous!" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes." Then he explained: "The rose would have died,
anyhow&mdash;and&mdash;and I wanted something to remind me of her
when I was at work, an' keep me memory from other things. I kept it
in a tin of water in a cool corner of the stables; in case Dotty
might see it and take it back to her with a romantic 'rat'. And,
when it went off colour, I dried it, and I've got it in a japanned
tin match-box now...I think I must be going dotty meself."</p>

<p>I slept on the verandah, covered up warm; and, that first night,
when it got chilly, I saw a softwood fire start up, over there
amongst the trees, an' shine out, with a blue tint to clear it,
like a star of Hope and Peace.</p>

<p><b>Henry Laswon wrote a letter to the editor of the <i>Bulletin</i>
which appeared in the magazine on 9 June 1921:</b></p>

<p>Dear <i>Bulletin</i></p>

<p>It takes something to drag a letter or even jolt a telegram of
explanation out of me; but, on commencing to read that last yarn of
mine, "Previous and S'Samuel", I got a jolt myself; and I must
explain it, if only for the sake of some old fruit growing mates of
mine. I made Previous Convictions see a bloke pruning my fruit
trees somewhere before Easter, according to the chronological order
of the stories. Actually that incident occurred late in winter,
when Previous and Dotty had come back from their trip to Hay; and
it was only that confirmed casualness of mine which turned that
incident into this story. The explanation may not seem necessary,
but there are "critics" like the one who spent a lot of his
valueless time finding out that there was no moon in those parts on
the night Sir John Moore was buried. And such nuisances succeed in
giving pain to a writer's friends and creating disturbances in
their families.&mdash;Henry Lawson</p>
