    <i>Castlereagh-House</i></p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>To you, beneath whose kind and  fostering tuition I lived the rosy hours of childhood, and imbibed those  qualities which were erewhile the early promptures of my muse, I respectfully  inscribe these buddings of my fancy; considering that, in acting thus, I am but  performing a small part of that grateful duty I owe you, as my former tutor, with  which title your paternal behaviour always blended the joint idea of father and  friend.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe me, dear Sir,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with  the highest respect and veneration,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your  obedient and grateful Servant,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles  Tompson, Jun</p>

<p align="center" class="note">&ldquo;O,  Festus Dies Hominis!&rdquo; . . . O, The Joyful Day Of Man!</p>
<p>Why, (when the hours of school-day  bliss are o&rsquo;er,<br>
  And puerile pleasures charm the mind no more,<br>
  When childhood shrinks before youth&rsquo;s riper day,<br>
  Like morning dews by sunbeams chas&rsquo;d away,)<br>
  Delights the mind with exstacy to dwell<br>
  On joys her earlier moments lov&rsquo;d so well?<br>
  Why do those dreams, to golden memory dear,<br>
  More bright than Life&rsquo;s progressive day appear,<br>
  And Fancy rush, with repercussive spring,<br>
  To where she first essay&rsquo;d her callow wing?<br>
  Some spell ineffable the mind employs,<br>
  To paint the birth-place of her infant joys!</p>
<p>O Fulton! tutor of my early hour,<br>
  Nurse of its shoot&mdash;its bud&mdash;its op&rsquo;ning flow&rsquo;r&mdash;<br>
  Beneath whose fost&rsquo;ring hand the scion rose,<br>
  Beneath whose grafted counsels still it grows,<br>
  Deign to accept the blossom of that tree,<br>
  The only gift the muse can offer thee! </p>
<p>Come, Inspiration, from thy  radiant bow&rsquo;rs,<br>
  Wave thy light wand, her fancy&rsquo;s slumb&rsquo;ring flow&rsquo;rs,<br>
  Bid (1)Evan&rsquo;s name resound her hills among,<br>
  And Memory prompt and Truth record the song!<br>
  Hark! with sweet sounds th&rsquo; a&euml;rial billows swell,<br>
  Some muse respires them from her sylvan cell;&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Fair (2)Castlereagh!&rdquo; she sings, or seems to sing,<br>
  And woods, and lawns, and meads, the strain responsive ring. </p>
<p class="note">1 - EVAN,&mdash;the district in which  Castlereagh seminary is situated. </p>
<p class="note">2 - The residence of the Rev.  Henry Fulton. </p>
<p>Majestic daughter of th&rsquo; expansive  plain(3)<br>
  Where rural stillness holds her placid reign!<br>
  Once, &rsquo;mid thy woods, a happy child I stray&rsquo;d,<br>
  Or rambled careless o&rsquo;er thy vista&rsquo;d glade,<br>
  Traced the blue windings of some woodland rill,<br>
  Or, lab&rsquo;ring, gain&rsquo;d the summit of yon&rsquo; hill<br>
  To view the green redundancy below, <br>
  Roll, like old Ocean, when the tempests blow. <br>
  Nor could sublimer objects then impart <br>
  One ray of pleasure to my bounding heart; </p>
<p class="note">3 - Castlereagh hill. </p>
<p>And, if it rov&rsquo;d beyond those  golden hours,<br>
  Hope, in perspective, strew&rsquo;d the path with flow&rsquo;rs.<br>
  Thus Time fled on, &rsquo;till youth&rsquo;s maturer day<br>
  Called into life my soul&rsquo;s expanding sway;&mdash;<br>
  More solid thoughts my moments then engage,<br>
  And Knowledge tempts me with her open page,<br>
  &rsquo;Till now life&rsquo;s business drives his sober team,<br>
  And sheds, o&rsquo;er all my mind, a mellowing beam;<br>
  Those visions fade that charm&rsquo;d its thoughts before,<br>
  And fairy forms and landscapes glow no more. </p>
<p>When dawning Phoebus shed his  golden hue,<br>
  To robe yon mountains and dispel the dew,<br>
  Our little band, awaking from repose,<br>
  Obedient to the oft-heard chime, arose,<br>
  Banish&rsquo;d each thought of indolence away,<br>
  And, with new zeal, commenced the studious day.<br>
  On tardy wings the measur&rsquo;d moments flew,<br>
  Till Time&rsquo;s broad lapse his silken veil withdrew;<br>
  The welcome hour arrives,&mdash;then all repair<br>
  To join their tutor in th&rsquo; unstudy&rsquo;d pray&rsquo;r.<br>
  (To him, kind pastor! was the blessing given,<br>
  To ask the boon and to be heard in heaven,&mdash;<br>
  If e&rsquo;er &rsquo;twas order&rsquo;d that the good above<br>
  Plants of our GOD should be, and children of his love.<br>
  Swiftly elaps&rsquo;d the recreative hour,<br>
  And Pallas soon resum&rsquo;d her latent pow&rsquo;r,<br>
  Again retrac&rsquo;d her long-accustomed round,<br>
  Her reign, with truth and laureate honours, crown&rsquo;d,&mdash;<br>
  Again it fled&mdash;once more the wonted chime<br>
  Strikes on our ear, and tells the lapse of Time,<br>
  Then Heav&rsquo;n incites us on her sacred way,<br>
  To offer up thanksgiving and to pray.<br>
  Thus flow the hours of pure unclouded joy,&mdash;<br>
  No cares to ruffle and no sweets to cloy,&mdash;<br>
  Meek our engagements, calm as evening air,&mdash;<br>
  The peaceful moments sanctified by pray&rsquo;r,<br>
  Down seas of bliss our little shallops glide,<br>
  And fairy islets spangle all the tide. </p>
<p>O happy days! unvalued while ye  glow,<br>
  Unheeded felt until ye cease to flow,<br>
  How oft have I, for freedom panting strong,<br>
  Thought the task tedious and the school-hours long!<br>
  How often wish&rsquo;d to cast their chain away,<br>
  And burst the barrier of youth&rsquo;s ling&rsquo;ring day!<br>
  How often wish&rsquo;d for pinions like the dove,<br>
  That I might careless fly, or freely rove,<br>
  Shake off the shackles that my will confined,<br>
  And be the helm to prompt and guide my mind?<br>
  But these were thoughts youth&rsquo;s riper hours disown,<br>
  Thoughts of a child, and of a child alone.<br>
  Nature has giv&rsquo;n all creatures to be free,<br>
  And Man in embryo pants for liberty;<br>
  It is a charm instructive, and which dwells<br>
  In all, and all to one great wish impels;&mdash;<br>
  It bids the Negro spurn his galling chain,<br>
  And curse&mdash;tho&rsquo; vainly curse&mdash;its unearn&rsquo;d pain;<br>
  It bids the captive lion, in his grate,<br>
  Burst its strong bars and re-assume his state;<br>
  By it impell&rsquo;d, the youngling eagle flies,<br>
  Spurns the low plain and soars along the skies.<br>
  But yet it most befits the human race;<br>
  Man&rsquo;s bosom is its noblest dwelling place;<br>
  Down from the cradle to the dying couch,<br>
  He feels the influence of its quick&rsquo;ning touch,<br>
  And, e&rsquo;en when weary life is almost o&rsquo;er,<br>
  When one faint throb &rsquo;twill heave, and heave no more,<br>
  Then wakes the soul beneath its kindling ray,<br>
  And mounts and flutters in the beam of day,<br>
  Thrice happy days! the nurse of ev&rsquo;ry joy,<br>
  And ev&rsquo;ry sweet that ripen&rsquo;d man employ,<br>
  Tranquil probation to the genius giv&rsquo;n,<br>
  And mild indulgence of a smiling Heav&rsquo;n!<br>
  True, on the disk of their reflective glass,<br>
  The world, in miniature, is seen to pass;<br>
  Each passion, temper, action, law, and rule,<br>
  That sways the world is found within a school:<br>
  The fire but sparkling, or the torpid seed<br>
  But feebly shooting of each manly deed;<br>
  There marbles&mdash;balls, are emblematic toys<br>
  Of those which re-engage Earth&rsquo;s elder boys<br>
  And puerile zeal, affection, hatred, strife,<br>
  The embryo bus&rsquo;ness of all human life.<br>
  Pleasing reflection! when the mental eye<br>
  Reviews the business of years gone bye,<br>
  To think how sweet our infancy was spent,<br>
  Our minds, like slender twigs, tow&rsquo;rd virtue bent,<br>
  And led by Science, thro&rsquo; her flow&rsquo;ry maze,<br>
  With ardent bosoms, emulous of praise.<br>
  On scenes like these the mind delights to look,<br>
  The fav&rsquo;rite pages in life&rsquo;s narrow book!<br>
  How pleasant was it, when the drowsy hum<br>
  Of study ended with the setting sun;<br>
  When, tir&rsquo;d with application thro&rsquo; the day,<br>
  We rush&rsquo;d at once with all our hearts to play!<br>
  In diff&rsquo;rent sports engage the cheerful train;<br>
  Some urge the bounding ball across the plain,<br>
  Some whirl the top, or bid the arrow fly<br>
  Straight to the butt, or upward to the sky;<br>
  While other hearts, whom softer pleasures move,<br>
  Prefer the converse of the friend they love,<br>
  With him, how sweet to spend the leisure hours!<br>
  To pluck unstain&rsquo;d affection&rsquo;s early flow&rsquo;rs!<br>
  To pour, unask&rsquo;d, within his faithful breast,<br>
  What griefs disturb you, or what thoughts molest?<br>
  T&rsquo; accept what consolation he could give;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas happy thus, if happy here to live!<br>
  O, early friendship! what thy sweets impart,<br>
  Let him confess who owns a kindred heart&mdash;<br>
  Him, who has felt thy sympathetic strain<br>
  Breathe in each thought, and throb in ev&rsquo;ry vein!<br>
  He can appreciate (and only he)<br>
  Thee, pure incitement of the Deity!<br>
  O! I have felt thy mild serene controul<br>
  Guide my young steps and lighten all my soul,<br>
  And mem&rsquo;ry yet, reverting to the scene,<br>
  Feels thee anew, nor heeds the years between!<br>
  But who can paint the pleasure that possess&rsquo;d<br>
  Each lively bosom and each cheek confess&rsquo;d,<br>
  When the long hoped for holiday was come,<br>
  When ev&rsquo;ry latent energy rush&rsquo;d home,<br>
  And close divan commenc&rsquo;d the joyful day,<br>
  To prove how best its hours would glide away?<br>
  At length, to blue Nepean&rsquo;s flow&rsquo;ry side,<br>
  We rush at once, and plunge us in the tide,<br>
  The kindly waves a sweet reflection give,<br>
  And the lax nerves a livelier tone receive;&mdash;<br>
  For now, when Sol pours blazing ardour down,<br>
  And fiery red sheds all the torrid zone&mdash;<br>
  When the streams languish, and the pastures fade,<br>
  And yawning fissures crack the thirsty glade&mdash;<br>
  When the clear heav&rsquo;ns the silent pray&rsquo;rs deride,<br>
  And e&rsquo;en one show&rsquo;r to cheer them is deny&rsquo;d,<br>
  A wasting flame breathes in the genial beams,<br>
  And the sad system courts the sick&rsquo;ning streams;<br>
  Ah! then, ye cool, ye murm&rsquo;ring Naiads! Tell<br>
  What luxuries within Nepean&rsquo;s  bankments dwell!<br>
  Refresh&rsquo;d, thro&rsquo; (1) Zean fields we heedless rove,<br>
  To where Pomona revels in the grove;<br>
  We feel the goddess&rsquo;s ambrosial breath,<br>
  Luxurious curling in the shade beneath;<br>
  Her luscious (2)peach diffuses fragrance round,<br>
  From cluster&rsquo;d branches bending to the ground;&mdash;<br>
  We mount&mdash;we gather; and, now well supply&rsquo;d,<br>
  We homeward bend beneath the orchard&rsquo;s pride<br>
  Till on the hours of sober evening creep,<br>
  And, faint and weary, Nature sinks to sleep. </p>
<p class="note">1 - Zea mays, is the botanical  name of the Indian corn, which is abundantly cultivated on the banks of the Nepean. </p>
<p class="note">2 - It may not be out of place to  remark, that peaches of an excellent quality also abound on the Nepean borders, and  flourish almost spontaneously. </p>
<p>O, dreams of bliss! that, o&rsquo;er the  infant brain,<br>
Wave your light wand and beck your fairy train;<br>
There, in idea, &rsquo;twill retrace the day,<br>
Again &rsquo;twill study, and again &rsquo;twill play;<br>
&rsquo;Twill rove, perhaps, amid ethereal flow&rsquo;rs,<br>
Or dwell with angels in celestial bow&rsquo;rs;<br>
&rsquo;Twill fearless climb the dark impending steep,<br>
Bend o&rsquo;er the flood and plunge along the deep;<br>
More guilty dreams the mind cannot employ,<br>
Whose charm is innocence, whose gladness joy:<br>
O, could man ever own such dreams as these,<br>
His days all happiness&mdash;his nights all peace,<br>
E&rsquo;en angels might for human semblance sigh,<br>
And gladly shake off immortality!<br>
The sun beams high&mdash;and hark! a tinkling chime<br>
Marks one more vestige in the path of Time:<br>
It is the day, by God in mercy giv&rsquo;n<br>
To man to spend in penitence to heav&rsquo;n.<br>
The church invites, and, when we enter there,<br>
Let Apathy not shew the face of Pray&rsquo;r,<br>
Nor roving thoughts (the path by idlers trod)<br>
Teach the lost heart to aberrate from God!<br>
But O let piety our bosoms charm!<br>
Meek be our pray&rsquo;rs, and our thanksgivings warm!<br>
As self-impos&rsquo;d be thought the happy task,<br>
And let us truly wish for what we ask!<br>
The pastor&rsquo;s sacred tongue diffuses round<br>
The Gospel truths with holy precepts crown&rsquo;d;<br>
For him bright hands prepare, in realms above,<br>
A wreath of glory and a crown of love!<br>
For, pious in himself, his lips impart<br>
Those conscious truths that live within his heart;<br>
Cheerful in life, and to his calling true,<br>
He knows the Word by books and practice too!<br>
At length, the tributory off&rsquo;ring o&rsquo;er,<br>
The rustics meet before the chapel door;<br>
Then softer thoughts their simple bosoms move,<br>
To glance affection on the maid they love,<br>
And, half-averted, from her piercing eye,<br>
To catch the sly responses as they fly:<br>
In recognition, oft the hearty hand,<br>
Good-nature presses round the friendly band,<br>
With grace less polish&rsquo;d, but a will more free,<br>
Than e&rsquo;en adorns the courts of royalty:<br>
The kind enquiry made for absent friends,<br>
The frank, rude greeting each to other sends,<br>
The rural compliment, the titt&rsquo;ring jest,<br>
The blush that&rsquo;s prompted by the artless breast,<br>
The vague report, and all th&rsquo; important news<br>
That Memory o&rsquo;er her simple tablet strews,<br>
Engage, or to the drear churchyard they go,<br>
(Hearts unaccustom&rsquo;d to dissemble woe,)<br>
And sadly seek, within that final home,<br>
For some dear friend&rsquo;s or parent&rsquo;s hallow&rsquo;d tomb,<br>
Then drooping mournfully o&rsquo;er those who sleep,<br>
Indulge their feelings, and in silence weep.</p>
<p>Here let Reflection cast her sober  eye<br>
  O&rsquo;er the sad trophies of mortality!<br>
  Life is a sandy base, which if we trust,<br>
  Our minds, our spirits, centre in the dust;<br>
  We feel no monitor&mdash;no heavenly thrill&mdash;<br>
  Prompt us to good, or bid us shrink from ill,<br>
  But all the soul, by worldly frenzy tost,<br>
  Trusts in itself, and is for ever lost.<br>
  &rsquo;Tis thus, self-wise, the atheist&rsquo;s bosom swells,<br>
  Nor thought of God nor hell within him dwells;<br>
  His soul is sin, to profanation grown;<br>
  Bound to himself, and to himself alone;<br>
  He spurns those truths, to man divinely giv&rsquo;n,<br>
  &nbsp;And laughs and scoffs at promises of  Heav&rsquo;n!<br>
  Not so, the man whom sacred precepts move<br>
  To own the influence of a Saviour&rsquo;s love,<br>
  Angels await to set his spirit free <br>
  And waft it up to immortality!</p>
<p>Within these sad, sad sepulchres, repose<br>
  Hearts throbbing once with human joys and woes,<br>
  Knees that, in holy penitence, have knelt,<br>
  And frames that felt whatever we have felt;<br>
  A heap of dust is all that now remains,<br>
  Oblivion seals their pleasures and their pains;<br>
  They shared, as we must share, the common lot,<br>
  By some remember&rsquo;d&mdash;but by more forgot;<br>
  Yet, when their fellow pilgrims here may cast<br>
  A melancholy view on moments past,<br>
  And think on those their bosoms then held dear,<br>
  Nature will  drop a sympathetic tear,<br>
  O&rsquo;ershade the brow and heave th&rsquo; half stifled sigh,<br>
  And look with sadness upon times gone bye.<br>
  Here keen regret a rugged tombstone rears,<br>
  Fix&rsquo;d up with sighs, and sculptured o&rsquo;er with tears,<br>
  A simple structure&mdash;now by Seasons worn,<br>
  And hid &rsquo;neath many a knot of shelt&rsquo;ring thorn,<br>
  Thick spreading vines a blooming mantle wave,<br>
  And wrap the slumb&rsquo;rer in a flowery grave.<br>
  Ah! what avail those lips that sweetly move<br>
  With all the soft artillery of Love?<br>
  Eyes whose refulgence might eclipse the day,<br>
  And forms and features where the Graces play?<br>
  Beauty must stoop when Death&rsquo;s stern mandates come,<br>
  And, with Deformity, divide the tomb;<br>
  But Virtue, then triumphant, will arise,<br>
  For ever fair and blooming, to the skies! </p>
<p>Near where the chapel rears its  modest top,<br>
And graceful crowns the gently-falling slope,<br>
There is a site, where once a hamlet stood,<br>
But now o&rsquo;ergrown with weeds and underwood;<br>
Within whose neighbour&rsquo;ing shade dear mem&rsquo;ry views<br>
The place where childhood first essay&rsquo;d the (1) muse,<br>
There, many a scheme of golden life I drew,<br>
And many a happy peaceful moment flew;<br>
Then, in its prime, the new-born hamlet stood, <br>
Like Circe&rsquo;s palace, circled by a wood, <br>
But sudden Desolation o&rsquo;er it shed <br>
His desert influence, and its tenants (2) fled&mdash;<br>
Save one, (3) who linger&rsquo;d, like a faithful mate,<br>
Within its purlieu and prolonged its fate;<br>
A sturdy cyclop, whom the forging god<br>
Rear&rsquo;d in his black Sicilian abode,&mdash;<br>
Long did his sledge and bellows echo round<br>
A merry clanking and a roaring sound,<br>
Till roving thoughts his iron mind possess&rsquo;d<br>
And he, at length, retired behind the rest.<br>
Such was its fate&mdash;forsaken now by all,<br>
One tott&rsquo;ring ruin tells its timeless fall.<br>
Here while I gaze, a golden glimm&rsquo;ring ray<br>
Shoots down aslant and brings the close of day,<br>
It sheds on ev&rsquo;ry shrub a brighter green,<br>
And gives a fresh enchantment to the scene;<br>
It bids wrapt Fancy bound with livelier spring,<br>
And wake and re-essay her weary wing.<br>
E&rsquo;en so, EUGENIUS&rsquo; friend&mdash;(his faded eye<br>
Immerging fast into mortality,<br>
Chill Death awaiting in its sombre robe,<br>
T&rsquo;enwrap his frame and catch his last faint throb,)<br>
One lambent glance illumed his ling&rsquo;ring end,<br>
It flash&rsquo;d affection on his weeping friend,&mdash;<br>
Then fled his spirit to that unknown shore<br>
Where all are wafted, to return no more. </p>
<p class="note">1 - In an acacian grove, the  &ldquo;neighbouring shade&rdquo; of Castlereagh hamlet, I penned my first poetical  eflusion, which is annexed, intituled &ldquo;An Ode to Spring&rdquo;; I was then about  twelve years of age. </p>
<p class="note">2 - The Hamlet of Castlereagh was  founded by the late lamented MACQUARIE, in the  latter part of his administration, and a school house erected therein, together  with a few cottages belonging to private individuals; but, from a deficiency of  that invaluable element water, it was deserted almost in its birth. The chapel  yet stands and is used as a church, by the inhabitants of the Nepean district. One rude wood frame alone  remains of the cottages alluded to. Since this period, however, Mr LEES, a  substantial farmer on the Nepean  borders, has erected a commodious house, &amp;c. nearer the parsonage. </p>
<p class="note">3 - This disciple of Vulcan  (yclepped Langlay) continued some time after the other tenants of the hamlet,  and often used to amuse me, in a fine evening when walking out, with the merry  clank of his anvil and his jovial song. </p>
<p>Fair CASTLEREAGH! I trace thy  landscape round,<br>
  Each well known spot to me is sacred ground;<br>
  In ev&rsquo;ry mead&mdash;in every bow&rsquo;r or tree,<br>
  Some dear companion&mdash;some old friend I see;<br>
  The myrtle grove that skirts thy sloping sides,<br>
  And the tall summit from the plain divides<br>
  The rich (1) acacias waving o&rsquo;er the rill<br>
  That pours its scanty stream beneath the hill;<br>
  Thy spreading vale&mdash;but here let mem&rsquo;ry tax<br>
  The rude invasions of the spoiling axe,<br>
  That chased the dryads from th&rsquo; affrighted glade,<br>
  And lopped each shrub that once composed their shade.<br>
  Thus Art extends her civilizing reign,<br>
  Bows the tall wood and casts it on the plain,<br>
  Drives Nature&rsquo;s beauties from their seat away,<br>
  And plants a train less lovely far than they;<br>
  The landscape shines beneath a borrowed hue,<br>
But graceless more, and diff&rsquo;rent from the true. </p>
<p class="note">1 - Acacia decurrens&mdash;The green wattle.</p>
<p class="note">2 - When I was a pupil at  Castlereagh Seminary, the extensive valley, spreading from the foot of the hill  to Nepean  river, was robed in its native beauty, and covered with forest; but, since the  formation of clearing gangs, that forest has been cut down. </p>
<p>Nurse of my joys! while yet I muse  on thee,<br>
  The prospects vanish and the shadows flee,<br>
  Darkness extends her sad and drowsy reign,<br>
  And in a mist envelopes all the plain;<br>
  But yet for ever will thy scenes appear<br>
  Sweet to reflection, and to memory dear;<br>
  And, when their charms bright recollection gives,<br>
  And my tranced soul the rosy hours relives,<br>

<p align="center"><b>Strophe I.</b></p>
<p>Strike, strike the bold convivial  lyre! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let lofty paeans wake the soul! <br>
  Let ivy&rsquo;d bands each heart entwine, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one harmonious whole! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill, fill the goblet high! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full libation pour! <br>
  Why should decrepid Care intrude, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bacchus rules the hour? <br>
  E&rsquo;en Age resigns his cynic rod, <br>
  And, smiling, owns the potent god <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dropping clusters crowned; <br>
  The jovial hours their pinions hide, <br>
  And, unregarded, swiftly glide <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When bumpers flow around! </p>
<p align="center"><b>Antistrophe I.</b></p>
<p>Once more old Time rolls round the  day, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Philips, with his roving band, <br>
  Chased the wild genius of our shore, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hailed the wond&rsquo;ring strand: <br>
  Then infant Science, in the wild, <br>
  Raised her approving form and smiled, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maid before unknown, <br>
  And fixed, amid encircling hills, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis of her throne.</p>
<p align="center"><b>Strophe II.</b></p>
<p>Oppression&rsquo;s adamantine hand, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wreath of lashes long has twined, <br>
  And Flattery&rsquo;s fawning language driven <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each gen&rsquo;rous feeling from the mind: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But hark! the joyful shout, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By happy thousands given: <br>
  &ldquo;Grim Slav&rsquo;ry flies affrighted from his throne, <br>
  &ldquo;And LIBERTY (bless&rsquo;d maid) descends from heaven!&rdquo; </p>
<p align="center"><b>Antistrophe II.</b></p>
<p>No longer droops the mournful  brow, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad&mdash;the weeping eye, <br>
  But Joy, an inmate long estranged, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiles from yon western sky! <br>
  Hope, &rsquo;neath the veil of future years, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees proud AUSTRALIA to an empire rise; <br>
  While, led by honor o&rsquo;er the waves, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unrivalled Commerce flies, <br>
  And congregated nations pour <br>
  The wealth of worlds from every shore!</p>
<p align="center"><b>Strophe III.</b></p>
<p>United, in this social pray&rsquo;r, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let every patriot bosom glow! <br>
  &ldquo;O, may the joys, now budding fair, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like fruitful blossoms, to perfection grow! <br>
  May every boon that heav&rsquo;n can show&rsquo;r <br>

  &ldquo;Till the loud trump of Truth proclaim <br>
  &ldquo;Content, peace, freedom&mdash;all our own.&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, hand in hand, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye jovial friends, <br>
  To patriot lips the goblet join; <br>

<p align="center"><i><font size="+1">On  Her Birth-day</font></i></p>
<p>Sweet breathe the gales. Apollo  round him strews<br>
  Bright beams of gold, and melts the vernal dews,<br>
  While not a cloud, through all th&rsquo; etherial way,<br>
  Shrouds the blue heavens or dims the florid day. <br>
  Now wakes Vertumnus from his dull repose, <br>
  And breathes new life on every budding rose,<br>
  The blooms, obedient to his circling wand,<br>
  Burst their light bondage and at once expand.<br>
  O thou, whose eyes eclipse Apollo&rsquo;s fire,<br>
  Fair Sylvia! whisper rapture to my lyre, <br>
  Give these weak strains with pleasing charms to teem,<br>
  And thou, their sweet inspirer, be their theme!</p>
<p>Hail, happy morn! whose ruddy  blushes bring<br>
  The natal rites of Sylvia and of Spring:<br>
  They, hand in hand, in every fragrant bow&rsquo;r,<br>
  Tint the young leaf or paint the op&rsquo;ning flow&rsquo;r,<br>
  Graceful, o&rsquo;er lawns and smiling valleys move,<br>
  Charm the bright year and wake all hearts to love,<br>
  O, could the Muse her glowing wishes pour,<br>
  For joys, fair nymph, to grace this envied hour;<br>
  Around thy brows, perennial wreathes should twine,<br>
  And beams of happiness unfading shine;<br>
  Here language fails:&mdash;for still my speaking heart<br>
  Mocks my faint lips and leaves untold a part.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twere vain t&rsquo; invoke new charms  the joy to crown;<br>
  Beauty and worth already are thine own:<br>
  Union divine! whose happy bonds include<br>
  All that is amiable, fair, and good.<br>
  Yet O, to heav&rsquo;n, presiding spirit, bear<br>
  The wish of friendship and the Muse&rsquo;s pray&rsquo;r!</p>
<p>Still may, meek Innocence! thy  blushful grace,<br>
  With virgin crimson, paint that angel face;<br>
  Celestial truth those guileless lips controul,<br>
  And warm benevolence inspire her soul;<br>
  Still kindling virtues every charm impart<br>
  And form a brighter OEgis round her heart!<br>
  And Sylvia, while below, the flowing hours<br>
  All happy smile upon thy path of flow&rsquo;rs,<br>
  For thee, may seraphs heav&rsquo;nly garlands twine,<br>
  And bliss await thee in a brighter clime. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Ode III. To Laura</b></p>

<p>Lives there a heart that never  felt the pow&rsquo;r<br>
  Of Beauty&rsquo;s eye, in love&rsquo;s exstatic hour, <br>
  Or, free alike from every passion&rsquo;s sway, <br>
  Wastes its dull span in apathy away? <br>
  Let such be silent. But th&rsquo; obedient line, <br>
  When Beauty prompts, Parnassean pow&rsquo;rs be mine! <br>
  Be mine to weep when sadness shrouds her tongue,<br>
  And when she&rsquo;s joyful&mdash;tune the ready song! </p>
<p>Then hail, fair Laura!&mdash;hail this  happy hour,<br>
  When thou wert born, Australia&rsquo;s  loveliest flow&rsquo;r! <br>
  O, may such joys as graced thy natal morn, <br>
  With brighter glow this day&rsquo;s career adorn! <br>
  And haste, pervading Flora, haste and bring<br>
  The blended sweetness of thy kindred Spring,<br>
  And weave a wreath to grace th&rsquo; angelic fair,<br>
  A garland fit for beauty&rsquo;s queen to wear! </p>
<p>Say, shall the Muse invoke the powers  divine<br>
  To give thee virtue?&mdash;&rsquo;Tis already thine.<br>
  Beauty and all her charms?&mdash;Alike &rsquo;twere vain,<br>
  Perfection clasps thee in her fairy chain!<br>
  Th&rsquo; Idalian goddess, rich in every grace,<br>
  Beamed an imperfect emblem of thy face;<br>
  Like some fair shepherdess, whom fabled tales<br>
  Give to inhabit Aon&rsquo;s flow&rsquo;ry vales, <br>
  Thine Innocence; or like the virgin snow<br>
  Whose flakes, on Parnass&rsquo; top, for ever glow. </p>
<p>But, beauteous Laura! while the  partial<br>
  Heav&rsquo;n Gives thee what else to mortal can be giv&rsquo;n,<br>
  This is denied;&mdash;O may it gracious prove,<br>
  And teach thee pity as THOU taught&rsquo;st me love!</p>

<p>Dear Sylvia, while the rosy spring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renews thy natal day,<br>
  For friendship&rsquo;s sake, what less can I<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than tune a vernal lay?<br>
  When nature laughs, and joy pervades <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The renovated scene,<br>
  When every mead and every bow&rsquo;r <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumes its robe of green,<br>
  Shall thy dear memory beam on me,<br>
  And I not touch the lyre for thee? </p>
<p>Forbid it all ye sweets that deck<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The joyful hours of spring;<br>
  Forbid it, too, thou smiling boy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With silken flutt&rsquo;ring wing!<br>
  O! were the power, as is the will,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this fond bosom giv&rsquo;n,<br>
  What bliss&mdash;what transport were not thine, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath yon ample heav&rsquo;n?<br>
  But since it cannot be, receive <br>
  The best of wishes I can give! </p>
<p>May thy fair form, but more thy  mind,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still charm th&rsquo; enamour&rsquo;d view!<br>
  Thy tender heart, when mis&rsquo;ry calls,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its dictates still pursue!<br>
  Virtue is thine, (unfading flower,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure growth of realms above!)<br>
  O may it flourish long with thee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wand to guide thy love,<br>
  And Innocence, thy cherub face, <br>
  Confess her fav&rsquo;rite dwelling place! </p>
<p>Remains there yet another grace<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not already thine?<br>
  Yes, there is one, I blush to sing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An attribute divine:<br>
  May pitying  angels hover o&rsquo;er,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shed their power on thee!<br>
  And O, my Sylvia, wilt thou beam<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That influence on me? <br>
  From thee and Love in vain I fly, <br>
  I weeping live, and living&mdash;die. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Ode V. To Sylvia</b></p>
<p>Hast thou not seen some captive  bird<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impatient flit within the wire,<br>
  And seek the bliss of liberty,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With anxious fond desire?</p>
<p>Or hast thou not beheld, in  chains,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some poor unhappy pris&rsquo;ner pine?<br>
  E&rsquo;en such a wretched slave am I,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&rsquo;en such hard fetters mine. </p>
<p>But yet from these I differ too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they would cast their chains away,<br>
  While I exult to wear the badge<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of thy unpitying sway. </p>
<p>Then deign, fair nymph, one smile  of love,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One ray of ruddy hope impart!<br>
  O, give this life the pow&rsquo;r to live,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heal the wounded heart! </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waft you o&rsquo;er their parent deep,<br>
  Let the shade of recent friendship<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes sympathise and weep! </p>

  Think, my pray&rsquo;r is speeding for you&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read my wishes in the gales! </p>
<p>But, should storms the waters  blacken,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dark clouds deform the sky,<br>
  And the troubled ocean, roaring,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll its billowy mountains high, </p>
<p>Then, when cheerless eyes and  bosoms,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Heav&rsquo;n avert such lot from you!)<br>
  Swell tow&rsquo;rd heav&rsquo;n in supplication,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think that I am weeping too! </p>

<p>Thither, while the waves you&rsquo;re  plowing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will seek some lonely cell,<br>
  Doubtful, hoping,&mdash;hopeless, asking,<br>
  &ldquo;Must this be a last farewell?&rdquo; </p>
<p align="center"><b>Ode VII. To Spring *</b></p>
<p>O Thou who, unexpected, steal&rsquo;st  serene<br>

  Tell me of climates which I ne&rsquo;er have seen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me feel the fragrance thou dost bear! </p>
<p>For with thy presence, nature is  adorned,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clad in gay green, luxuriant and mild,<br>
  Erewhile the embryo blossom lay unformed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sweet profusion scattered o&rsquo;er the wild; </p>
<p>&rsquo;Till, by degrees, it op&rsquo;ning to  the sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now spreads, enamour&rsquo;d, to his warmer ray;<br>
  At length, by aged infirmity o&rsquo;ercome,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twill, once more closing, droop and die away. </p>
<p>Thus, in the midst of pleasures,  man&rsquo;s cut off,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck by the never-erring arm of death;<br>
  Tho&rsquo; some, above their fellows, rise aloft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet fate, at length, will stop their vital breath. </p>

<p class="note">WRITTEN in the Verandah of the  Chapel at the deserted hamlet of &ldquo;BLACK   TOWN,&rdquo; an Establishment  formed by Government some years since, for the purpose of civilizing the  aboriginal Natives of Australia, and teaching them the art of agriculture,  &amp;c. on the new Richmond-road, about 28 miles distant from the metropolis.  It is much to be lamented that the poor heathen possessors were allowed to  desert the Establishment, as much good emanated from the Rules first adopted  there. Mr. WALKER, of the Wesleyan Mission, formerly officiated in the Chapel,  and was entrusted with the care of the Pupils and Establishment. That gentleman  has since left it, and at the time I wrote the following Elegy, the Chapel and  Cottages were deserted, the latter in ruins, and the whole scene exhibited the  strongest marks of desolation. </p>

  (Poor restless wand&rsquo;rers of the woody plain!<br>
  The skies their covert&mdash;nature their domain)<br>
  Seek, with the birds, the casual dole of heav&rsquo;n,<br>
  Pleas&rsquo;d with their lot&mdash;content with what is giv&rsquo;n.<br>
  Time was, and recent mem&rsquo;ry speaks it true,<br>
  When round each little cot a garden grew,<br>
  A field whose culture serv&rsquo;d a two-fold part,<br>
  Food and instruction in the rural art.<br>
  The lordling tenant and his sable wife<br>
  Were taught to prize the sweets of social life,<br>
  And send their offspring, in the dawn of youth,<br>
  To schools of learning and the paths of truth.* </p>

  &ldquo;And bright&rsquo;ning beams of Truth&rsquo;s triumphant light <br>
  &ldquo;From his lost empire chase the fiend of night!&rdquo; </p>

  And views of civil arts before them spread;<br>
  Nor beam&rsquo;d this soft benevolence in vain;<br>
  Warm Emulation broke the Gothic chain,<br>
  Docile, they struggled for contested bays<br>
  And snatch&rsquo;d, from cultur&rsquo;d youth, the meed of praise!<br>
  Go on, Britannia! consummate thy plan,<br>
  And train the hopeful pupil up to man;<br>

  T&rsquo; wake from sullen night the grov&rsquo;ling soul,<br>

  Th&rsquo; imperial palace and the lowly cot<br>

<p align="center"><b>III. An Elegy on Winter in  Argyleshire</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;WITH cheerless gloom and  storm-portending clouds<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rude Winter brushes from Antarctic wilds,<br>
  The front of Heav&rsquo;n, in murky vapors shrouds,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then bursts his sounding freightage o&rsquo;er our isles. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No more are heard the thrush&rsquo;s  mellow notes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more the plover mounts the ev&rsquo;ning breeze,<br>
  No more the soaring lark on aether floats,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spoil&rsquo;d of their honours, mourn the leafless trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The front of Heav&rsquo;n, erewhile so  right and gay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now scowls on Nature&rsquo;s universal scene,<br>
  And shatt&rsquo;ring hail, and howling tempests play,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where wav&rsquo;d one nodding canopy of green. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No more the brook, in rippling  murmers, glides,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, with its silver tinkling, soothes the ear,<br>
  Nor * Wollondilly, smile thy gentle tides,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But swoll&rsquo;n to torrents, toward ocean bear.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="note">* In a former publication of this  Elegy, the River alluded to was called &ldquo;Nepean,&rdquo;  of which Wollondilly is properly the source. It rises in Argyleshire. </p>
<p>Thus &rsquo;plain&rsquo;d I, while, by  Wollondilly&rsquo;s stream,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ling&rsquo;ring step. I sought my devious way,<br>
  A little naiad marked my plaintive theme,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus, in chiding numbers, seemed to say:&mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mortal, mourn&rsquo;st thou nature&rsquo;s  beauties gone?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why hang desponding strains upon thy tongue?<br>
  Repine not! for a little season flown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renewed in loveliness they&rsquo;ll rise ere long. </p>
<p>&ldquo;When howling Winter&rsquo;s stormy  course is run,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When his chill blasts to northern climes are driven,<br>
  Then shall Spring&rsquo;s blooming bosom greet the Sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And joy shine forth from bounty-beaming Heaven.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Thus sung the nymph, when, from  the pebbly bed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er which the bubbling stream delights to play,<br>
  Adown its maze her airy image fled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bleak gale her accents died away. </p>
<p>As round the earth the changeful  seasons roll,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the vernal Sun dark vapours fly;<br>
  So, from the dust, mounts the aspiring soul<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To join her kindred spirits in the sky. </p>

<p>Now sinks the sun behind the  western hills,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And balmy Eve assumes her placid sway,<br>
  Soft whispers murmur from the tinkling rills,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gentle zephyrs on their surface play. </p>
<p>The low of herds&mdash;the wood-dove&rsquo;s  am&rsquo;rous coo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone are wafted on the passing gale;<br>
  Calm silence bids my sighs revert to you,<br>

<p>Must I alone eternally deplore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sigh, unheeded, to th&rsquo; unconscious wind?<br>
  Must this lost heart enjoy sweet rest no more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And e&rsquo;er despair a soft return to find? </p>
<p>Cupid, invidious scourge of human  ties!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft strikes alone the poor despairing swain,<br>
  Bids him exhaust his days in hopeless sighs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waste his nights in tears&mdash;but all in vain. </p>
<p>But say, is such my lot?&mdash;sweet  Sylvia, say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must I for ever with this anguish burn?<br>
  Still waste the dreary night and live-long day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sigh, despairing of a fond return? </p>

<p align="center"><b>The Storm; A Fragment;</b></p>
<p align="center"><i><font size="+1">In Imitation of Cowper</font></i></p>
<p>Dark lowered the sky, the rumbling  thunder roll&rsquo;d,<br>
  And light&rsquo;ning&rsquo;s vivid flash, athwart the gloom,<br>
  Appalling, seemed to burst the valt of heaven;<br>
  From the rent clouds down swept a deluge loud,<br>
  Of rain, harsh, patt&rsquo;ring o&rsquo;er the turbid brine;<br>
  The angry billows dashed their rocky bourne,<br>
  Delib&rsquo;rate yet; &rsquo;till, from the brooding south,<br>
  A sweeping gale convulsed their wide domain,<br>
  That, now transformed to one continuous sheet<br>
  Of foam, in liquid mountains sought the shore. </p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas then, exposed to all the  ruthless war<br>
  Of the contending elements, a bark,<br>
  Tight-fraught with merchandize, and homeward-bound,<br>
  Drew my attention to her piteous plight.<br>
  (Poor hapless mariners! how can ye brook<br>
  The fierce unbridled fury of the storm?) </p>
<p>Still ruthless raged the ordnance  of heaven<br>
  The frail devoted bark its only sport,<br>
  Sole buffet of its rage, she long withstood,<br>
  And her tough bulwarks had well nigh outborne,<br>
  When (destiny unmarked!) th&rsquo; ill-fated keel<br>
  Struck on a rock, whose top the billows washed;<br>
  O&rsquo;er her broad stern the waves tremendous broke;<br>
  Th&rsquo; electric fluid thro&rsquo; her rigging played&mdash;<br>
  Her masts&mdash;her cordage&mdash;devastating all,<br>
  &rsquo;Till the ribb&rsquo;d hulk no longer marr&rsquo;d its force,<br>
  But tott&rsquo;ring sunk into the yawning gulph,<br>
  A sad example of the wrath of heaven! </p>
<p>The dismal cry of seamen in  despair,<br>
  Clinging, for succour, to a floating yard,<br>
  The dying groan&mdash;the sinner&rsquo;s last brief prayer,<br>
  But faintly wafted on the passing gale,<br>
  Would draw some pity from the hardest heart,<br>
  But e&rsquo;en the few who fondly sought to live,<br>
  &rsquo;Neath &rsquo;whelming billows found a timeless grave. </p>
<p>O, what a scene to wound the  feeling breast,<br>
  To chill the crimson current in its course! </p>
<p>The blasts, less rude, still  howled among the cliffs,<br>
  Some random bolts played harmless o&rsquo;er the deep,<br>
  The thunder&rsquo;s hollow voice, but murm&rsquo;ring faint<br>
  At awful intervals, and almost quelled,<br>
  Seemed like the threat&rsquo;ning plaint of discontent,<br>
  Causeless and muttered from an ingrate&rsquo;s tongue.<br>
  I paused;&mdash;by slow degrees the scene was changed;<br>
  The sea grew calm&mdash;the boist&rsquo;rous gale expired,<br>
  And all the roaring tempests sunk to sleep;<br>
  Nor one faint human accent met the ear,<br>
  Nor floating fragment of the wreck remained:<br>
  A tear&mdash;the tribute due to kindred dust,<br>
  (Sweet child of Sympathy, and Pity&rsquo;s pledge!)<br>
  I dropp&rsquo;d&mdash;then, melancholy musing, fled. </p>

<p align="center"><i><font size="+1">Paraphrased</font></i></p>
<p>O, for a beam, from Sion&rsquo;s sacred  hill,<br>
  Of inspiration! then my soaring muse<br>
  Would wake, with hope, her bold aspiring lyre<br>
  To notes of rapture! Such the seer inspired,<br>
  Whose holy strains essayed to paint his God! </p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfection, indefinitude supreme!<br>
  Let not thy direful wrath for ever blaze,<br>
  But Mercy&rsquo;s gentle voice arrest its power;<br>
  Here let me sing, in bold seraphic notes,<br>
  How keen, on favoured Israel&rsquo;s heathen foes,<br>
  The fatal arrows of thy vengeance fell! </p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw and trembled;&mdash;while  transcendant rays,<br>
  Shot from the Majesty divine, illumed<br>
  Heaven&rsquo;s canopy and earth&rsquo;s remotest verge;<br>
  Refulgent Teman beamed ethereal fire,<br>
  And lofty Paran owned the present God.<br>
  Before his glorious form the baleful plague<br>
  (Dire harbinger of wrath!) and igneous flame<br>
  Swept o&rsquo;er the guilty land. Supreme he stood;<br>
  All comprehensive, o&rsquo;er the subject world,<br>
  His eye terrific rolled, at one full gaze<br>
  Including Earth e&rsquo;en to her utmost bourne,<br>
  Awful he frowned, and, with a potent arm,<br>
  Dispersed the warring nations; mount on mount<br>
  He hurled; Earth shook, and Ocean trembling heaved,<br>
  Cushan&rsquo;s bright valleys felt the shock divine,<br>
  And Midian&rsquo;s limits in affliction wept.<br>
  Thy bow was bent;&mdash;the Earth submissive yawned,<br>
  And foaming rivers rushed impetuous in.<br>
  Mountains beheld, and tottered to their base;<br>
  Fix&rsquo;d in yon shining arch, the radiant sun,<br>
  The pallid moon, and all the starry host<br>
  Forgot their circling orbits, and stood still.<br>
  In indignation just, thro&rsquo; Earth&rsquo;s dull realms,<br>
  Thy blazing chariot rolled, and flames of wrath<br>
  Flashed from thy world-compelling eye on heaven! </p>
<p>&ldquo;These marked the tender  parent&mdash;these the God!<br>
  These rained destruction o&rsquo;er his people&rsquo;s foes,<br>
  But these saved Israel,  and released his flock! </p>
<p>&ldquo;What, tho&rsquo; no more the fig her  fruits diffuse,<br>
  No more the luscious vine her nectar yields,<br>
  No more the press with streaming oil o&rsquo;erflow;<br>
  Tho&rsquo; fade the pastures and the flocks decay?<br>
  Still shall my bursting heart with rapture swell,<br>
  Still to my God, its grateful homage pour,&rdquo;<br>
  And dwell, with hope, on joys that bloom in heaven,<br>
  The pilgrim&rsquo;s goal&mdash;the sinner&rsquo;s home of peace,<br>
  Where all is bright, and Love Eternal reigns! </p>

<p>In a slave-cultured isle, on the  verge of the main,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sable Zimeo&rsquo;s form was reclined;<br>
  He wept his dark destiny, gazed on his chain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mingled his sighs with the wind. </p>
<p>&ldquo;O ye Gods!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;whose  beneficent care<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shields the innocent suff&rsquo;rer from woe;<br>
  Permit me no longer these shackles to bear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some gleam of soft pity bestow! </p>
<p>&ldquo;In the dawn of my youth, dear  companions! with you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I rambled in Afric&rsquo;s green shade.<br>
  When my hours, &rsquo;mid your smiles, so delightfully flew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dreamed not they ever would fade. </p>
<p>&ldquo;On the lip of my Ninda, when  panting with love,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With what exstacy heaved my fond heart!<br>
  When we vowed by those pow&rsquo;rs in the mansions above,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we never&mdash;no, never, would part. </p>
<p>&lsquo;The bright sun of prosperity  glistened awhile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diffusing ephemeral rays;<br>
  I basked &rsquo;neath the phantom&rsquo;s encouraging smile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bliss was the badge of my days! </p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Till a little black cloud, wing&rsquo;d  by demons of air,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And urged by the fates from below,<br>
  Interposed &rsquo;tween my sight and that sun&rsquo;s cheering glare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurled me from bliss into woe. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Inured to the arts of seduction  and wile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White merchants arrived in our bay,<br>
  Allured us on board, unsuspicious of guile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bore us in triumph away. </p>
<p>&ldquo;On that accurst day all my  happiness fled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ninda&mdash;my country&mdash;my home;<br>
  Here slavery&rsquo;s ignoble fetters are spread,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here liberty never will come! </p>
<p>&ldquo;O, never!&mdash;what horrors compose  that dread word,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this weary pilgrimage o&rsquo;er,<br>
  I go where the sound of sweet mercy is heard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where mis&rsquo;ry&rsquo;s remember&rsquo;d no more. </p>
<p>&ldquo;See, bright from elysium, a  seraph appears,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiling she calls me away;<br>
  &ldquo; &lsquo;My Zimeo, quit this dull region of tears!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo, thy Ninda!&rsquo; &rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Loved shade, I obey.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Oblivion shed her dark veil o&rsquo;er  his woes;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Hope soothed the horrors of death;<br>
  From the cliff where he pondered, undaunted he rose,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plunged in the billows beneath. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey mists slowly wreathe o&rsquo;er the upland and dale,<br>
  The moon, rising cloudless, just silvers the fountain<br>

<p>Than the blooming young rose-bud  her cheeks are more bonnie;<br>

<p>When sickness or age every grace  shall deflower,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lovelier mind o&rsquo;er their touch will prevail;<br>
  Such sweetness, such goodness, such ravishing power,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blend alone in my Mira, &ldquo;the flow&rsquo;r of the vale.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In some lone little cot, from the  gay world secluded,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wind and waves, without  controul,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellowed their rage from pole  to pole. </p>
<p>Ages have rolled their circling  orbs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since dumb Creation heard the tale,<br>
