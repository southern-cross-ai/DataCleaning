  Murray Married A Blonde</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hell and all such things!&rdquo; outspoke Leif Murray, pitching  across the room the book he had been reading.</p>
<p>It landed on a very small occasional table, and, quite  naturally, upset it.</p>
<p>The table had held a vase of flowers, which broke as it  touched the floor, and the water sank into the thick Oriental rug.</p>
<p>A reader of detective stories was Murray, and of the traditional sort. Like the  oft described statesmen, members of Parliament, presidents, kings and even the  clergy, he reveled in mystery yarns, if they were good ones.</p>
<p>His notion of a good one was a tale whose interest  depended on originality of plot and cleverness of workmanship. One that  presented a real puzzle to an intellectual reader.</p>
<p>He wanted no underworld characters, no gangster&rsquo;s work, no  torture chambers or oubliettes, but rather a nice, clean, white-collared  murder, with plenty of problems for a ratiocinative mind.</p>
<p>This did not mean dry-as-dust situations or simple village  brawls.</p>
<p>For choice, Leif put Eden Phillpotts at the top of his  list of favorites and considered <i>A Close  Call</i> about the best detective story ever, always excepting Trent&rsquo;s <i>Last Case</i>.</p>
<p>But Francis Iles, he thought, stepped ahead of all others  in his daring.</p>
<p>Indeed, he so greatly admired <i>Malice Aforethought</i> and <i>Before  The Fact</i> that he sometimes reread them.</p>
<p>Of late&mdash;he thought, as he sat with bookless hands,  regarding the overset table&mdash;of late, authors had harked back to these two  books. It seemed to him, that in the last few months, he had come across at  least three stories, wherein, on the very first page, a man had decided to kill  his wife. The book he had just flung away had that for its motif.</p>
<p>Though of course, that was not the reason for its discard.  He would willingly stand for that fascinating if somewhat hackneyed plot,  Uxoricide as a Fine Art, if it were well done. If you were so carried along by  the author&rsquo;s charm of diction and persuasiveness of thought that you fell into  step unconsciously and thought and believed only what you were meant to.</p>
<p>Hateful subject&mdash;his wayward thoughts ran on&mdash;why would a  man want to kill his wife? Fancy my killing little <i>Exquise!</i></p>
<p>He smiled at the idea and stretched himself farther back  in his big stuffed chair, his hands behind his head, his pipe alight, his deep  blue eyes dancing at the silly thought.</p>
<p>And yet, he mused, I can understand a nature that would do  such a thing. And he needn&rsquo;t be a brute, either. Just a chap so fed up with his  wife&rsquo;s nagging or teasing ways that he couldn&rsquo;t stand her another minute.  Isabel isn&rsquo;t like that, bless her, and if she is sometimes over-solicitous  about me and my doings, it&rsquo;s only out of the kindness of her heart. And she&rsquo;s  so beautiful, as lovely as the day I married her, three years ago. Oh, she is  flowers to see! She&rsquo;s a carrot fresh scraped and all those archaic posies the  old bards sang. I believe she&rsquo;s the one perfect blonde in the whole world. And  damn lucky for me she <i>is</i> a blonde! Suppose I had married Elaine! Elaine, with  her soft, satiny black hair and her dark, mysterious eyes. Orbs, I should say.  Surely if any eyes ought to be called orbs, hers are the pair! And I escaped  marrying her by the merest squeak! At the critical moment she offered me  Isabel, and in a miraculous whiff of intelligence, I took her. A fair deal,  too, for I had no idea then that it was imperative my wife should be a blonde.  Dear little <i>Exquise</i>. There is no  other word for her. English falls down before her Gallic charm. Precious child!  I&rsquo;d hate to kill her&mdash;but by heck! if she doesn&rsquo;t stop&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there, Helga?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housemaid, who was kneeling on the floor, looked up at  him.</p>
<p>Then she answered, truthfully enough; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m picking up some  broken glass that somebody smashed off of a vase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Leif Murray&rsquo;s mother chose a name for her infant son,  she had hesitated between Leif and Eric. She would. She had found both names in  the back of the dictionary, and her vague memories of history told her that  both names were Norman  or Norseman or Nordic or something smacking of high class nomenclature, and, nobly  resisting the temptation to use both, she decided on Leif.</p>
<p>And now he was a man, strong, but not specially silent,  learned, but no pedant and his cup running over with the joy of living.</p>
<p>He took no interest in domestics. Whether belonging to a  retinue or merely hired help they meant nothing to him.</p>
<p>He preferred Lady Clara Vere de Vere to King Cophetua&rsquo;s  Beggar Maid, but a hint of trouble on a pretty face would give him pause.</p>
<p>And when Helga explained her presence in the room, Murray couldn&rsquo;t help noticing  a quivering lip and a welling tear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, youngster?&rdquo; he said, for the Swedish  Helga counted not many years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir,&rdquo; she returned, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I say there is. Why are you in distress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner commanded a reply, and Helga looked up at him,  as the incipient tear ripened and added its volume to the dampness on the rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My kitten is hurt,&rdquo; she said, piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s too bad. You take it to Simmons, and tell him  I said he must put it to rights. He&rsquo;s a mighty handy man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Helga said, deferentially, and went on with  her work.</p>
<p>She was rubbing the rug with a neat housecloth, when Leif  spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to the little cat?&rdquo; he asked, idly rather  than interestedly.</p>
<p>The answer came with a choke in Helga&rsquo;s throat. &ldquo;She got  kicked, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you love her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir!&rdquo; A wonderful power of loving sounded in the  three words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; go and see about your kitty at once. Tell Mrs.  Mendel I want someone else to come here and finish your cleaning up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; thank you very much, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; Leif said, as she was leaving the room,  &ldquo;who kicked your kitten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. But it was none of the staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, but I can&rsquo;t say who did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you? Look here, was it Mrs. Murray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir! Mrs. Murray wouldn&rsquo;t do such a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who did? Tell me instantly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Mrs. Vernon, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vernon! What was she doing with your kitten. Tell me  the whole story. At once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frightened but obedient, Helga told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was yesterday,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;Mrs. Murray had brought Mrs.  Vernon round back to show her the fruit in the kitchen garden, sir. It&rsquo;s  wonderful this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my kitten, she&rsquo;s a playful piece, ran across Mrs. Vernon&rsquo;s  foot, and the lady gave her a kick that landed her plumb against a stone wall  and broke her leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, run along, Helga, and get Simmons to fix the  leg. He can do it. You needn&rsquo;t tell him who broke it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; but they all know. The laundress was in the  drying patch and she saw it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the staff to say no more about it, I don&rsquo;t want it  discussed at all. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I will tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helga went away and Leif sat back in his chair with a  frown between his heavy eyebrows.</p>
<p>So Elaine would kick a little helpless kitten. Women were  like that. Not Isabel, though. She wouldn&rsquo;t do such a thing. Or would she? No,  not with her tiny, graceful foot, but how about a well-aimed kick formed of  words &mdash;forceful, carefully chosen words?</p>
<p>Yes, she could do that&mdash;Lord, she <i>could</i> do that!</p>
<p>He looked out of the window. Murray was not a lazy man, but he was an  enthusiast, and whatever he did, he did with his might. This afternoon he was  resting, relaxing, and he was doing it thoroughly.</p>
<p>He looked out of the window and he saw treetops waving in  the breeze.</p>
<p>He loved treetops, and had bought this house because,  being built on a side hill, treetops could be seen from certain windows.</p>
<p>Up Westchester way, a sort of exclusive bit of landed  property was called Ingleside Heights, and except for the name, it seemed the very  place the Murrays  wanted to live. So there they were, and had been for nearly three years, liking  it better all the time, and adding details of improvement every season.</p>
<p>Hilly, of course, treesy, of course, yet between the high  places there were wide level tracts and among the copses were clearings that  showed the blue sky or let in the thunder storms.</p>
<p>Their home was of anomalous architecture, yet designed for  great comfort, with big rooms, many windows and enormous closets. Lots of  porches, screened and open, and well-arranged gardens, just now going cerulean  with delphinium and campanula and assisted hydrangeas.</p>
<p>Longacre the place was called, because of its size and  shape, and with a certain reserved dignity, it sat upon the hillside among its  more or less pretentious neighbors.</p>
<p>Like Cromwell, o&rsquo;er the distant hills came Isabel, and  Leif watched with pride as her light springy steps brought her nearer.</p>
<p>He rose, laid aside his pipe and went out on the porch to  meet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What favor do you want?&rdquo; she smiled at him, &ldquo;something,  of course, must explain this unusual welcome home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Pretty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk like that! I&rsquo;ve  been waiting for your coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. You&rsquo;ve finished your detective story, then?  Why didn&rsquo;t you begin another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been?&rdquo; he asked, ignoring the little  discord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over to see Elaine,&rdquo; she replied, as they sat down on a  porch settee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a good time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, except that Hum Paley was there and pestered the  life out of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time I&rsquo;ll go along to take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would! You see, half of them had cameras, and  one couldn&rsquo;t be sure for a minute&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, half of them had cameras?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that. Nearly all the men and lots of the girls had  cameras, and they snapped everything and everybody in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t snap you, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they did. How could I help it? Or how could I  know I was being snapped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean they took your picture when you didn&rsquo;t  even know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean just that. They were all doing it. It&rsquo;s a fad, a  hobby. If you&rsquo;d go places instead of just sitting around here, you&rsquo;d know about  things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know about the silly things Humbert Paley  does. That man isn&rsquo;t tops, and I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t have so much to do with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t encourage him. He&rsquo;s whuffy over me, but I  can&rsquo;t help that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can. You can show him you don&rsquo;t like him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do like him. I like him quite a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The provocative smile on Isabel&rsquo;s perfect face vanquished  her husband and he drew her into his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a blonde, thank Heaven,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;re not  a blatant one. Not like those the beauty parlors turn out. You&rsquo;re like a Greuze  picture, vague nuances and softened lights, dreamy, shadowy, a person of  moonshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why this deep gratitude toward me for being a blonde? You  often speak like that. Wouldn&rsquo;t you have loved me if I had been a brunette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might have loved you, a whole lot, but I wouldn&rsquo;t have  married you. Or if I had, I wouldn&rsquo;t have stayed married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense you do talk! I find that brunettes take  much better pictures than blondes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snapshots, maybe. But not with a real photographer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Those last pictures I had from Mariano are gorgeous,  aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gorgeous isn&rsquo;t the right word. No word is the right word.  They are &lsquo;Eclipse first and the rest nowhere&rsquo;! They are Ossa on Pelion piled,  they are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A big voice boomed up the porch steps, accompanied, by a  very large specimen of humanity, who rejoiced in the name of Giles Trumbull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About my wife,&rdquo; said Leif, as the two rose to greet one  of their best and dearest friends. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of her, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; said Trumbull, beaming at Isabel. &ldquo;And so am I.  I&rsquo;ve been tramping, and I dropped in to see if you&rsquo;ve a cocktail handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Isabel answered, and leaned over to touch a  bell-push in the wall.</p>
<p>She gave the butler instructions and added;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Simmons, find Miss Tonka, and ask her to join us  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came a girl of perhaps twenty, as Dutch as a windmill  and as serene as a plaque. Her yellow hair was banged and bobbed like that of a  page, and her eyes were the blue of the darker delphiniums. A definite lack of  animation kept her face from being pretty, and an entire absence of cosmetics  made her look unfinished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sent for me, Isa?&rdquo; she said, nodding to Trumbull and plumping  herself down on a hassocky, hummocky arrangement of leather pillows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you here with us, and I thought you might like a  cocktail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, Tonka sat silent. She didn&rsquo;t close her eyes, but  she might as well have done so for all the intelligence that could be seen in  them. Not at all sullen or even preoccupied, she sat like a statue, insensate  of glance, but a living, pulsing body that seemed alive to all material  influences.</p>
<p>Trumbull looked at her a moment and then  turned back to Isabel. He had seen Tonka many times, but had never been able to  rouse one spark of mental activity in this graven image with the queer name.  Nor did he care, he told himself, if he never did rouse one.</p>
<p>Simmons wheeled in a wagon-bar, complete with the makin&rsquo;s,  and Leif consulted the tastes of his waiting friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind do you want, Tonka?&rdquo; he asked after the other  two had chosen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kind that has licorice in, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She means absinthe,&rdquo; Isabel explained. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a natural,  you know, not quite like other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she wants absinthe she can have it,&rdquo; Leif said, &ldquo;and  she can call it what she likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke in a disinterested tone and he did not look at  the girl.</p>
<p>Tonka was an odd sort and hard to understand, but she was  by no means lacking in intellect. A distant cousin of Isabel&rsquo;s, she lived with  them because there was no other known spot on the globe where she could live.  Leif didn&rsquo;t like her because she was afraid of him, and she was afraid of him  because he didn&rsquo;t like her. But her life was happy. She adored doing things for  people and she did them in such a habitual, every-day sort of way, and with no  thought or expectation of praise or even recognition, that she had become a  cherished member of the household, who would be sadly missed if she were not  there.</p>
<p>Her name was Constance,  but as a child she had found it hard to pronounce, and had called herself  Tonka. The name stuck and somehow it suited her.</p>
<p>She accepted her specially prepared cocktail without  comment, and said, a little abruptly, &ldquo;Are you going to fix up the sail  tonight, Leif?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sail?&rdquo; Murray  looked blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She means the yacht trip,&rdquo; explained Isabel, who always  helped Tonka out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; and Leif showed enthusiasm. &ldquo;Stay to dinner,  Giles, and we&rsquo;ll settle all the details this evening. You want to go next week,  don&rsquo;t you, Isabel? &rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if I&rsquo;m well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, what ails you now?&rdquo; Leif&rsquo;s words were  softened by the solicitous smile he gave her.</p>
<p>Tonka set down her glass, and clasped her hands, a  startled look in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, probably,&rdquo; and Isabel tried to look the  neglected sufferer. &ldquo;Elaine had some beastly canapes, some new kind, and I  expect they didn&rsquo;t agree with me. I don&rsquo;t know what was in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whale blubber, maybe,&rdquo; and Leif looked knowing. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re  using that at the clubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pemmican, like as not,&rdquo; Giles opined; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a favorite  novelty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canned stuff,&rdquo; declared Tonka, scorning the other  suggestions. &ldquo;You take some bi-carb, dear, and forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elaine doesn&rsquo;t use canned stuff,&rdquo; urged Isabel. &ldquo;Not when  she has company, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would if it came from Southern   Senegambia,&rdquo; Giles told them, &ldquo;some cannery that is not averse to  using moribund fish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do hush!&rdquo; Tonka scolded him, and took Isabel away to  change for dinner.</p>
<p>Later in the evening, they sat out on the terrace,  planning the pleasure trip they had in view.</p>
<p>Leif&rsquo;s eighty-foot power yacht, with its Diesel engines,  was a queen, even among the other beautiful craft belonging to the members of  the Yacht Club.</p>
<p>A dozen guests could be carried in comfort but Isabel  decreed no more than eight or nine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate a big party,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;they get lost all the  time. Say, eight, Leif, for two tables of Contract, and one odd one for  emergencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All picked out, are they? Reel off the names, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four of us right here. Then, Elaine, of course, and Leo  Jewett and Antony Ballard, and then, what do you think of Jim and Fleda  Garrison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Paley?&rdquo; asked Giles, astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Paley,&rdquo; said Isabel, decidedly, and Leif nodded  enthusiastic agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Trumbull  said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your party. But I don&rsquo;t believe Paley will like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; Tonka said, slowly; &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not  making the party for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not,&rdquo; and Leif went on with his plans. &ldquo;Isabel has  decided on our course, which will be simply to get out in the open, and then go  ahead in a generally southern direction until she says turn around, and then we  turn around. Something tells me the turning around act will occur &rsquo;long about Chesapeake Bay, or what have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a perfect route,&rdquo; Trumbull agreed; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make a  single change in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall we start, Firefly?&rdquo; and Murray awaited his wife&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>Isabel did a little mental arithematic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today is the first of August,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s Monday. Well let&rsquo;s go on a Monday, but not next  week. We&rsquo;ve too many unbreakable engagements. We&rsquo;ll go on Monday the fifteenth,  just two weeks from today. Anybody not pleased?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody was, and the date was considered settled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like a long time ahead,&rdquo; Tonka said, musingly, &ldquo;but  there&rsquo;s a lot to do. We want some sailing togs, Isabel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before such matters could be discussed, a man came  along and up the steps of the terrace.</p>
<p>It was Humbert Paley, and the expression of his face and  his general air denied his usual happy gayety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in the house,&rdquo; he said, almost solemnly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went into the big living-room, and all looked at him  inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t heard any&mdash;er&mdash;any bad news, on the telephone or  anyhow, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t. Go ahead and tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leif was always impatient when a story was held back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shortly told. Pete Tolman is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bad egg but a good fellow,&rdquo; was Leif&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>Trumbull asked, &ldquo;What happened to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queerest thing! He poisoned himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suicide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. That&rsquo;s the question. It seems he had a failing for  peach pits, the kernels, I mean. Why, I&rsquo;ve seen him take an ordinary  table-knife and open a peach stone just as a fisherman opens clams or oysters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; Tonka said, with the calm air of an  expert not to be contradicted. &ldquo;Nobody could do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they can, Tonka,&rdquo; Leif frowned at her. &ldquo;I can do it  myself, with some stones. Others are too hard. But go on, Hum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tolman was always eating the kernels. He&rsquo;d collect  a lot and carry them round in his pockets. A good many people like them. And  I&rsquo;ve often heard it said, that if the kernel fanciers kept it up too long or  ate too many, they&rsquo;d finally collect enough prussic acid to kill them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve often heard that contradicted,&rdquo; Leif said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  often heard it said that there isn&rsquo;t enough prussic acid in a whole tree-full  of peach stones to kill a small monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe it or not. Tolman is dead, and there&rsquo;s evidence  a-plenty to prove the peach pit motif.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Isabel asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Inn,&rdquo; Paley told  her; &ldquo;the Van Winkle Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Tonka inquired, looking blankly uninterested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the ex-husband of Mrs. Vernon,&rdquo; Giles said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why isn&rsquo;t he Mr. Vernon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they were divorced, she came back here to live with  her father, and she resumed her maiden name.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  As to Prussic Acid</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that man Tolman doing here, anyway?&rdquo; Leif said, a  shade of anger in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Paley answered; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s been pestering  Elaine Vernon to see him, and she didn&rsquo;t want to see him. There&rsquo;s no reason why  she should. They&rsquo;re legally divorced, and he&rsquo;s no business bothering her at  all. Your wife is an intimate friend of Elaine&rsquo;s, and I thought you&rsquo;d be  interested in the news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Isabel said, quickly. &ldquo;How is Elaine taking it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child, she&rsquo;s bewildered. She can&rsquo;t grieve for him,  and yet the shock of his sudden death has bowled her over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to see her tomorrow,&rdquo; Isabel said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been  friends for years, she&rsquo;ll be glad to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; Leif offered. &ldquo;I owe that woman a debt  of gratitude. She gave me my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come?&rdquo; Paley asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Elaine lived here in Ingle Heights,  with her father, Doctor Vernon. She and I liked each other a lot, and I was  thinking seriously of telling her I could support her in the way to which she  had been accustomed, when, a friend came to visit her, and that friend was none  other than Miss Isabel Brooks. The moment I saw the lady I forgot the existence  of Elaine, and I devoted my every moment to ballyragging Isabel into marrying  me. Somehow, I succeeded and we&rsquo;ve lived happy ever after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Elaine mind?&rdquo; Tonka asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never said so, in person; and I&rsquo;ve no reason to think  she would have smiled on my suit, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very good-natured,&rdquo; Isabel observed, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are, sometimes,&rdquo; and Leif smiled at her. &ldquo;You know,  Paley, this blotting out of the Tolman person is a real blessing to Elaine.  That is, if he was bothering her. I didn&rsquo;t know he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t know his home town, but he showed up about a  week or ten days ago, took a room at the Inn,  and began to make himself a nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Trumbull.  &ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I know is, he kept coming to see Elaine, and he often  telephoned and asked her to go somewhere with him&mdash;she never would go, of  course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She could refuse to see him,&rdquo; Isabel declared. &ldquo;How  absurd to be bothered by a man like that. But it&rsquo;s funny she never said  anything to me about it. I was there one afternoon lately, and we sat and gossiped  for an hour or more, and we settled the affairs of the nation, but she never  mentioned Peter Tolman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just when was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see; today&rsquo;s Monday&mdash;it was Sunday, a week ago  yesterday. I went over there early, and we talked for an hour or so before  anyone else came. Then scads of people came, and I didn&rsquo;t see Elaine alone  again. Mr. Tolman was there for a short time, but I didn&rsquo;t talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long were they married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isabel thought. &ldquo;They were married soon after we were and  that&rsquo;s over two years. We went abroad on our wedding trip and were gone four  months. Elaine was married while we were away, and went to California to live. Her father and mother  still lived here. Well, the next thing I heard of her, she was divorced. Then  her mother died, and she came back here and lived with her father and kept  house for him. About six months ago, he died, and Elaine has lived alone there  ever since. She always seems contented and happy, and I thought Tolman had gone  out of her life forever. I was with her this afternoon, just ran over on an  errand. A lot of people came while I was there. She didn&rsquo;t mention Tolman, and  so I didn&rsquo;t. When did he die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon after dinner, tonight. Lots of people saw him in the  Inn dining room, and he was apparently all  right. About eight o&rsquo;clock I went over there and I heard the news. I talked  with the proprietor and with the doctor and I offered to be the one to go and  tell Elaine about it, and they were glad to have me do so. So I did, and she  was horrified and shocked and all that, but she said any show of sorrow would  be hypocrisy. She refused to see anybody tonight, but said she would see  reporters, if necessary, tomorrow morning. She told me of some people she  wanted me to notify, and you were among them. So now I&rsquo;ll get along with the  rest of the list. You know what Elaine is, gentle and timid by nature, but  brave as a lion in an emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t timid by nature, and I don&rsquo;t see any emergency.  Why must she be brave because her ex-husband is dead?&rdquo; This from Tonka, who was  moving about the room, now and then pausing to sit on the arm of a chair.  &ldquo;Elaine Vernon is not one to lose her head, nor will she pretend to any emotion  that she does not feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that, Tonka, dear,&rdquo; Isabel said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, the shock. But <i>why</i> is she shocked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly!&rdquo; Isabel frowned at her. &ldquo;If one has been  married to a man, even for a short time, she cannot be entirely unmoved at  learning of his sudden death. Has he any people, Humbert? Who will come to see  about things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I left the Innkeeper, Kenton his name is,  and Doctor Barnett in charge. I&rsquo;m ready to do anything I can for Elaine, of  course, but I&rsquo;ve no reason to look after the affairs of her divorced and  deceased husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; agreed Trumbull; &ldquo;I say, Leif, will this make&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paley had risen and was saying good nights, so Trumbull let himself be  interrupted.</p>
<p>The visitor gone, Giles laughed and said, &ldquo;I nearly made a  blunder. I was about to say would it make any difference in our sailing trip!  Quite forgetting Paley&rsquo;s not in on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Isabel agreed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him and I  don&rsquo;t want him on my party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our party,&rdquo; Leif corrected her. &ldquo;I refuse to be ignored.  But we&rsquo;re not having Paley. I&rsquo;m wondering if Elaine will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Isabel stared at him. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s  going to wear black and stay at home because a man she detests is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may go conventional,&rdquo; Giles suggested; &ldquo;and think she  ought to do thus and so as a social gesture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall you give up the party if she won&rsquo;t go?&rdquo; Isabel  asked of her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. But we must know more about details  before we decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, opportunely enough, just then Antony Ballard came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very man we want!&rdquo; Isabel cried; &ldquo;sit right down  there, and tell us everything about Peter Tolman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much to tell. He died of eating too much prussic  acid. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not enough,&rdquo; Leif informed him. &ldquo;I rather like peach  kernels myself, I often eat them, but I&rsquo;m still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Lots of people like them. But they eat only a few  now and then. Tolman was a fool about them. He ate all he could get, and I  understand they are a cumulative poison; if you can get enough of it in your  system, you die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he get such a lot of pits?&rdquo; Tonka wanted to  know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked about that. I&rsquo;ve been round to the Inn, but I didn&rsquo;t see the doctor who&rsquo;s on the case. I  talked with a dining-room captain, and he said that the kitchen department had  orders to save any nice clean peach pits for Mr. Tolman. Not pits left on  plates, but the quantities of pits left when pies or puddings or ice cream was  made from peaches. It&rsquo;s a big Inn, you know,  and some days they had baskets of pits. Always freestones, these pits were  cleaned and deposited in Tolman&rsquo;s room. He was a dabster at opening them, and  the room cleaners report amazing quantities of halved peach stones carried  away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; Leif mused. &ldquo;I never supposed enough prussic  acid could be absorbed that way to be a fatal dose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most unusual,&rdquo; Ballard agreed; &ldquo;but of course, you never  knew anyone who ate them steadily, and kept at it through the winter also. They  told me he ate stones from hot house peaches in winter when he could get them,  and if not, then from canned peaches. They say the ever-present poison  permeated his whole system until it reached the point of saturation, or  whatever they call it, and then it acted like a sudden fatal quantity all taken  at once would do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be,&rdquo; Leif acquiesced; &ldquo;how strange people are. I  like peach kernels, but I&rsquo;d never eat more than one or two at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an appetite with him. If anyone had told him of his  danger, he would doubtless have given up the habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely. What was he here for, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody told me,&rdquo; Ballard answered, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m a shrewd  feller, and I sort of gathered that he wanted to make things up again with his  erstwhile wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does erstwhile mean?&rdquo; demanded Tonka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once on a time,&rdquo; Isabel told her. &ldquo;Keep quiet, now. Go  on, Antony.  Were they making up? Were they going to live together again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballard looked at her amusedly. He was a bit older than  the rest of them and sometimes played the counselor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, child, I don&rsquo;t know. To hear Elaine talk, you&rsquo;d  think she held him as scum of the earth, but women are kittle cattle, and you  can&rsquo;t tell. They may have been planning, like the robins, to nest again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; and Leif looked stormy. &ldquo;That man is  a scoundrel. Elaine had no business to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He caught her on the rebound, after she lost you,&rdquo;  Ballard chaffed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Isabel said; &ldquo;I took you away from her,  Leif, when she thought she had you nailed &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was all ready to be took. Elaine told me how charming  you were and when I met you I found the half had not been told. So I pitched in  and won out. She brought it around, herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an old Spanish proverb,&rdquo; Antony said, &ldquo;Never introduce your donah to  your pal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a donah?&rdquo; Tonka wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Spanish for sweetheart. And if you introduce her to  your pal, your pal appropriates her at once. So when Elaine showed off Isabel  to Leif, the tables turned and Elaine found herself out of the running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Isabel, complacently, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s about the way it  was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to go on a yachting party, Ballard?&rdquo; Leif asked,  greatly desirous of a change of subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the Terpsichore? Your boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; just a few of us. Start pretty soon, now, and be  gone a week or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;ll go. Glad to. You&rsquo;re a brick to ask me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Don&rsquo;t say anything about it to Paley. We&rsquo;re  not asking him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me. What about Elaine? Will she go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not? She can&rsquo;t want to stay home and  mourn for Tolman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly. But&mdash;well, I see it hasn&rsquo;t occurred to you, but  suppose Tolman didn&rsquo;t die from his peach stone kernels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he die of, then? Mumps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely, but possible. You see, there&rsquo;s ructions at the  Inn. I went there myself, to find out how  things were going, and there are two doctors on the job, and theyy don&rsquo;t see  eye to eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&rdquo; Trumbull asked. &ldquo;Did Tolman have a doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot;No; he was found dead in his room. But Barnett was right  there, and he said at once it was the peach pits that killed him. Then another  doctor butted in and said that diagnosis was all wrong, and though Tolman died of  prussic acid poisoning, he must have had a larger dose than could be taken in a  few kernels. There was a plateful of split peach pits in his room, but Doctor  Matson, that&rsquo;s the second medico, declared they could not have had a fatal  effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot;It&rsquo;s the accumulation that counts,&rdquo; Trumbull said. &quot;Did the doctors know  about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot;Dunno. When I was there, I saw Kenton, and he told  me the two doctors were squabbling over the point of whether peach kernels  could kill or not. I can&rsquo;t see that it matters. Suppose Tolman took an extra  dose of prussic acid, because he wanted to depart this life or suppose he ate  too many of his favorite kernels, who cares? He&rsquo;s gone and the world&rsquo;s the  better for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why have you such a down on him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did like him. I urged Elaine not to marry him,  but she had a sort of infatuation, and would listen to no word against him. I  was not surprised to hear of the divorce, and I was glad to know she was rid of  him. I hope she&rsquo;ll marry some good man. But I wish Matson hadn&rsquo;t intruded. Then  they&rsquo;d have buried Tolman with no to-do. Now, I suppose they&rsquo;ll stir up an  investigation and try to make a case of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean a murder case?&rdquo; asked Tonka in her  straightforward fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, child!&rdquo; and Antony Ballard glared at her. &ldquo;You  mustn&rsquo;t say such things. Why don&rsquo;t you teach her better, Isabel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t they sent for his people?&rdquo; Leif asked, &ldquo;I suppose  he has some somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll have to apply to Elaine for all such  information,&rdquo; Ballard said; &ldquo;and that will pester her to death. I wish she&rsquo;d  let me take care of the business for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t ask her anything except the address of Peter  Tolman&rsquo;s people, and she can tell them that, without having a nervous  breakdown,&rdquo; Isabel flung out, with a scornful air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chap staying at the Inn,&rdquo;  Ballard went on, ignoring her pettish remark, &ldquo;that Fleming Stone, you know. He  has a big reputation as a private investigator, and if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you jump at conclusions!&rdquo; Trumbull put in. &ldquo;Getting a private  investigator, before there&rsquo;s anything to investigate! A man dying from prussic  acid hardly seems to me to call for the services of a famous and very expensive  private detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s right there in the house,&rdquo; Ballard persisted. &ldquo;I  daresay he&rsquo;ll take up the matter of his own accord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay he won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Trumbull returned; &ldquo;those big fellows don&rsquo;t  horn in on a case unless they&rsquo;re asked to. But if Elaine is going to be bothered  in any way, she must have someone to advise her. Some lawyer, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; suggested Tonka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; Isabel began, &ldquo;why you&rsquo;re all so fearful  for Elaine. If they do ask her for her ex-husband&rsquo;s home address, it won&rsquo;t put  her on the front page. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think, Leif, it seems to me that we  might start on the yacht trip sooner. I&rsquo;m fond of Elaine, though I don&rsquo;t see  why you all treat her as a child, to be looked after and looked out for. Now  I&rsquo;m practical. And I think that if we go on the yacht a week from today, it  would be bctter than two weeks from today. It will take Elaine away from any  unpleasantness here, and when we get back it will all be past history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, Isabel!&rdquo; and Leif smiled at her. &ldquo;You always have  the grandest ideas. I doubt Elaine will be pestered at all, but she&rsquo;ll like to  go away for a little time. Sure you can get ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; it was Tonka who answered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much  shopping to do. I&rsquo;ll look after that mostly. And it&rsquo;s quite possible Mr. Tolman&rsquo;s  relatives may kick up a bobbery. Suppose they say somebody in the hotel killed  him by giving him too many peach kernels, or an extra strong kind or something.  A thing like that might have to be investigated and might take a long time.  Elaine couldn&rsquo;t stand it, and she would be of no use here, much better to get  her away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonka,&rdquo; and Leif spoke sternly, &ldquo;I want you to shut up  about murder. Have you been reading detective stories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and so have you. You read them every afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Tonka,&rdquo; Isabel chided, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t intrude on a  conversation that doesn&rsquo;t concern you. Now, I want you men to go. It has been  an upsetting evening and I want to go to bed. Good night, Giles. Good night, Antony. Come, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took Tonka by the hand and the two went from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding Isabel&rsquo;s way of looking at it,&rdquo; Antony began, &ldquo;I think we  must look after Elaine in any way we can. Kenton didn&rsquo;t say it in so many  words, but he intimated that if the doctors should agree that there must have  been more poison taken by Tolman than could have been in the kernels, then it  would be a case for the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; and Leif looked startled. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s absurd.  Who could have done such a thing? Where was any motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had to answer that question,&rdquo; Giles said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d  investigate Tolman&rsquo;s life since his divorce from Elaine. He must have been  somewhere, and whatever he was doing, I&rsquo;ll bet he was up to no good. There must  be people he had dealings with, and they are the ones to question. Find them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking at it that way for the moment,&rdquo; Leif objected,  &ldquo;why would the deed be done here? Tolman had no friends here, but neither did  he have any enemies. I mean he was a stranger. Or almost one. Isabel and I were  on our wedding trip when Elaine met him and married him. We were away a long  time, and when we returned, the Tolman pair were living in California. They came back here once or  twice while Elaine&rsquo;s parents were living, and then the divorce happened, and  Elaine came home to live. How could anyone living here have any such grouch  against Tolman as to murder him? No, that&rsquo;s nonsense. Either his death was  caused by the peach pits or by an accident of some sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anyone living here killed him,&rdquo; Giles  explained; &ldquo;but some enemy he made during his life, some time, somewhere,  followed him here for the purpose of killing him and did so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All surmise, and rather absurd surmise at that,&rdquo; was  Ballard&rsquo;s comment on Giles&rsquo; speech, and the two men went away.</p>
<p>But matters at the Inn  were in decided turmoil. It was nearly midnight and the two doctors were still  discussing their contradictory knowledge and opinions.</p>
<p>Kenton, the Innkeeper, was beside himself with anxiety.</p>
<p>If the doctors would only agree on the peach pit theory,  and let the dead man be sent back to his people, the episode would soon be  forgotten and no memory of it would cling to his Inn.  But if it could not be settled and neither doctor would give a burial  certificate, then there was danger of a visit from the police, and who knew  what long-drawn out consequences might follow!</p>
<p>Kenton thought of conferring with some of his most  important and influential patrons, but he feared they might be alarmed at the  outlook and leave at once.</p>
<p>Then he bethought him of Fleming Stone, and wondered if he  mightn&rsquo;t ask some advice of him in a friendly way. Anyway, he decided that was  the best bet so far, and he went up to Stone&rsquo;s rooms, on the floor above.</p>
<p>The Inn was not a modern  structure, with many stories and elevators, it was a rambling old place, broad  and wide but not high.</p>
<p>It was entirely up to date in all its appointments and was  furnished well and in good taste.</p>
<p>Stone was not a regular yearly visitor, but he had been  there several times before and was friendly with the proprietor.</p>
<p>There was a light under the door of Stone&rsquo;s study, and  Kenton tapped for admission.</p>
<p>The door opened at once and Stone gave him a smiling  reception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he said, cordially. &ldquo;Sit down, Kenton. How are  things going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard about Mr. Tolman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask your advice, unofficially?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. How can I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kenton breathed a sigh of relief at this promising  beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly know myself. But I know if those two medical  chaps continue to fight over the situation it will be hard on my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kenton lowered his voice. &ldquo;I scarcely dare breathe it, but  they have hinted that they may call in the police. That, Mr. Stone, would empty  my Inn in twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why? I fancy the police would make short work of the  matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know our police. The town constable is a  pompous windbag, who loves to hear himself talk on law and order, and the county Sheriff  is so slow and doddering, he never gets anywhere until it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hesitate to suggest it, but the reputation of this  place means so much to me. I&rsquo;m wondering if you couldn&rsquo;t join those two doctors  who are wrangling as to the poisonous effect of peach kernels, and make them  see the wisdom of dropping the discussion and just say &lsquo;accidental death from  prussic acid.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know that it was accidental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the point. It must have been. He may have  committed suicide, of course, but we never could prove or disprove that, so why  not let bygones be bygones, and let his relatives come and take him away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s out of the question. He knows almost no one around  here. No one is his enemy. His fondness for the kernels of peach stones is  known by everyone in the hotel. Doctor Barnett declares they are responsible  for his death. Barnett is a well-known physician and why shouldn&rsquo;t we accept  his decision without considering another doctor who intruded unasked, on the  discussion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose, Mr. Kenton, that afterward it is proved that  this death was brought about by a larger amount of the poison than could  possibly be obtained from kernels, where would your reputation be then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be merely banking on Doctor Barnett&rsquo;s  diagnosis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he will have to declare it himself before I can be  interested in the matter. Have they held the postmortem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is being attended to. I have not heard the result  yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, in reply to your request, I can only say that I am  willing to look into this matter, unofficially, for your sake, but if I cannot  agree with your opinions as to further procedure, I must drop out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; and Kenton looked disappointed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great  kindness on your part, and I hope you will see clearly your duty in the matter.  But please remember the catastrophe it would be for me to have the stigma of a  murder attached to this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will remember,&rdquo; said Stone, and the two men went  downstairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  Isabel Is Sunburned</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you make eyes at her,&rdquo; said Isabel, the next  morning, as she and Leif turned into the crazy-paved path that led to Elaine&rsquo;s  front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, make eyes?&rdquo; asked her husband, smiling  at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little trick, in which you are past master. But more  especially, don&rsquo;t you say obscure things to her, with a meaning look&mdash;and I  don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, Beautiful, you&rsquo;re seeing things. But Elaine is  all alone, and if I can be of the least help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All alone! She&rsquo;s no more alone than any other widow. And  she&rsquo;s quite able to fend for herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tonka, who had come with them, stepped ahead and clanged  the big brass knocker.</p>
<p>The house, built by Elaine&rsquo;s father, was still in good  shape, but a much more heavy, solid affair than the more modern light weight  cottages.</p>
<p>A broad veranda ran across the front and there were  porches on both sides.</p>
<p>A parlor maid showed them into the room at the right. It  had been Doctor Vernon&rsquo;s waiting room, for his patients, but after her father&rsquo;s  death, Elaine had rearranged it to a very attractive reception room for well  people. Isabel crossed the room and appropriated a big stuffed easy chair, far  from modernistic in pattern, but of a deep, soft coziness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love this chair,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I always use it when I&rsquo;m  here. You don&rsquo;t find such in most of the Ingle houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had some in our house,&rdquo; Leif began, when Elaine  appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awfully glad to see you,&rdquo; she said, with a cordial smile.  &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ve heard about Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Leif said, &ldquo;Paley told us last night. Came round to  see if we could do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; Elaine smiled a little, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t like a  death in the family. I&rsquo;m not in Peter&rsquo;s family any more, and though sudden  death is always a shock, I can&rsquo;t feel deep emotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we thought,&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going  to put on black, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at Elaine&rsquo;s smart white pique, tailored and  trim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. I shall make no change in my ways and  my manners. But it all seems so strange. He was here yesterday, for a short  time, and now&mdash;dead. I can&rsquo;t seem to realize it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody coming,&rdquo; Tonka announced, from her coign of  vantage on the window seat Elaine glanced that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Stone,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he telephoned to ask if he might  come to see me. Don&rsquo;t go, Leif, I want someone to look after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after you,&rdquo; volunteered Isabel. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose  you&rsquo;ll be in any real physical danger &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lordy, but he&rsquo;s a handsome guy!&rdquo; Tonka informed them, as  she watched the arriving caller.</p>
<p>By some unwritten law the guests of the Inn were not  always intimate with the residents of the Ingleside Heights,  and had never met the famous detective.</p>
<p>Elaine made the necessary introductions, and then Stone at  once look up the matter in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am emissary from Mr. Kenton, Mrs. Vernon, and at his  request I want to ask you a few questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Social or official?&rdquo; Tonka demanded, in an exacting but  with an appealing gaze in her dark blue eyes.</p>
<p>Both Leif and Isabel were about to reprove her, but Slone  spoke first.</p>
<p>He smiled at her, as he replied, &ldquo;Entirely social, Miss Mead.  I have no official standing in this affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you calling Peter Tolman&rsquo;s death an affair?&rdquo; Elaine  inquired, gently. &ldquo;Why is that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  has even developed  into a case, Mrs. Vernon. Last night two doctors at the Inn  tried to persuade one another of their theories and beliefs, but they couldn&rsquo;t get  together, and it was necessary to call in the police to help us out. The  Inspector came, and ordained the presence of the coroner. So Doctor Coles added  his medical knowledge to the two previous physicians, and an autopsy was  performed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The report affirmed that death was brought about by taking  a far larger amount of prussic acid into the system than could have been  absorbed from peach stones even granting their cumulative use. Therefore the  matter is in the hands of the police, and they want first of all the address of  Mr. Tolman&rsquo;s family or his business interests. Mr. Kenton volunteered to ask  you for this data, but as he is beside himself this morning, looking after his  excited guests and even more excited staff of helpers, I offered to do this  errand for him. I hope, Mrs. Vernon, you have no objection to this arrangement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; Elaine told him. &ldquo;I will willingly  give you all the information that I can. We have been divorced for a long time,  but of course, I can tell you the addresses of his people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Granting that death did not occur as a result of eating  peach kernels, Leif said, slowly, &ldquo;is any other theory advanced? Do the police  apprehend suicide, or that sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police have not yet taken up the matter to that  extent. They want, first of all, to get in touch with Mr. Tolman&rsquo;s relatives.  It is thought they live in California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; said Elaine. &ldquo;Mr. Tolman&rsquo;s mother is still  alive. She lives in Pasadena.  So do her other two sons, Peter Tolman&rsquo;s brothers. I can give you all these  addresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Tolman&rsquo;s own address? He did not live in California, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not in California,  but I am not sure just where he did live last. He was a roving sort. He has  been here, at the Inn, a short time, and I  have seen him occasionally. But I have not seen him alone, and I have had no  intimate conversation with him. I believe married people should be fully in one  another&rsquo;s confidence, and have no secrets; but a divorced couple, to my mind,  are of no relationship whatever, and have no responsibilities or united  interests of any sort. I do not consider Mr. Tolman connected in any way with  my present life, and I feel that my life with him is a thing of the past, and  not even to be remembered. I have no lingering affection for the man or for his  memory, and while I deplore this tragic death, it is to me only as a story I  might read in the paper, of a stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elaine looked very beautiful, as she explained her  attitude. Her dark hair was in clustered curls, and her long, dark eyes were  pathetic with a saddened humanity, but not a personal grief. Her curved lips  did not quiver, but showed an uncontrollable sympathy for the fate that had fallen  on the man she had once loved.</p>
<p>But it was not her undeniable beauty that impressed Fleming  Stone. It was the sound of sincerity in her voice, Her dear, honest look in her  eyes, the controlled emotion of which he felt sure he discerned a trace and the  calm acceptance of a situation that she must and was prepared to meet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Vernon,&rdquo; he said, simply. &ldquo;Your pleasant  and straight forward manner emboldens me to ask a few more questions, perhaps a  bit more personal. While Mr. Tolman was your husband, did he have this habit of  eating the kernels of peach stones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I wondered some times if they were harmful, but  he laughed at my fears. I even went to ask a doctor about it, of course,  without Mr. Tolman&rsquo;s knowledge. The physician told me there wasn&rsquo;t enough  prussic acid in peach stones to kill a man, unless he ate them twenty-fours a  day for a long spell of years. So I found no more fault with my husband for his  fad, and I tried to learn to open peach pits the way he did. He was very deft  at it, but I couldn&rsquo;t do it at all. I mean his way. I could hammer them open,  and sometimes I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose then, Stone,&rdquo; Leif offered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a case of  either suicide or murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; agreed the detective. &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t you passing  up the suicide theory rather quickly? We&rsquo;ve no reason to think murder, but  there&rsquo;s always a chance for suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to discuss it here, do we?&rdquo; and Elaine  looked unwilling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Stone answered, &ldquo;but I do want you to tell me if, in  your knowledge of Mr. Tolman, you can imagine his taking his own life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine anything,&rdquo; Elaine gave a little smile. &ldquo;And  I can easily imagine the deed you refer to, because, during my life with him he  threatened it nearly every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In earnest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed in earnest. But he never carried out his threat  during our life together. I cannot speak for his intentions or deeds since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not trouble you further, Mrs. Vernon. In the  police mind I fancy the fact that Mr. Tolman sometimes hinted at suicide, will  be taken as a clue and they will go ahead first on that theory. Which, I  confess, seems to me may be the right one. You don&rsquo;t know of anyone  sufficiently inimical to Mr. Tolman to want to kill him do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, no! Don&rsquo;t let it come to that! I mean, such a  suggestion would almost kill his mother, and she is really a delightful lady.  His brothers I know only slightly &mdash;but, well, this is what is in my mind, Mr. Stone.  If Peter Tolman was murdered, then the case must be brought to light. But to  drag through a murder trial, and then discover it was suicide or accident,  would be too hard on his relatives. Or at least, it seems that way to me. As I  said, it does not affect me deeply, but I do feel sorry for his mother, and his  brothers and their families. They are highly esteemed and an unnecessary murder  trial would disgrace and crush them. Of course, if it has to be, that&rsquo;s  different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with Mrs. Vernon,&rdquo; Isabel said, as Elaine stoppcd  speaking. &ldquo;If you have in view a person who might have killed Mr. Tolman&mdash;by the  way, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Stone informed her. &ldquo;But I know little about the  man. I spend a week or two at the Inn some  summers, and other years I don&rsquo;t come here at all. I&rsquo;ve met Tolman on the  veranda or in the lounge, but I&rsquo;ve never chummed with him. I am not officially  interested in the matter. I came over here to oblige Mr. Kenton, for the poor  man is in real trouble. His guests won&rsquo;t stand by him if this thing turns out  to be a murder. And he can&rsquo;t tell about that without official investigation of  some sort. The arrival of the police force would empty his Inn  in a few days. Now, Mrs. Vernon, I don&rsquo;t believe I need trouble you again. I  came mainly for these addresses. What are the street numbers, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone jotted down the addresses, and went away. &ldquo;Stunning  man,&rdquo; exclaimed Isabel. &ldquo;Such graceful manners yet such a poise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is a poise?&rdquo; inquired Tonka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something you&rsquo;ll never have, dear,&rdquo; said Isabel, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, I have it now.&rdquo; Tonka suddenly drew herself up, and  assumed a dignified position, with a calm, courteous expression on her face.  She had an air of superiority that was not hauteur, but a gentle look of high  birth and breeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, Tonka,&rdquo; Leif exclaimed, &ldquo;what hit you? You looked a  real First Lady of the Universe for a few minutes. Don&rsquo;t do it again, it gets  on my nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way things are going,&rdquo; Isabel  complained. &ldquo;We want you to go on a yacht trip with us next week, Elaine, and  if you get mixed in with this case, you may be subpoenaed, or whatever they  call it, and you can&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; Elaine said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be called on to testify  or anything like that. I have no interest in Peter Tolman, dead or alive. And  of course I shan&rsquo;t be mixed up in the case in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why Elaine has anything to do with the  inquest, or whatever they call it. She was Mr. Tolman&rsquo;s wife, but when she came  all unmarried, she was no relation to him at all,&rdquo; Tonka informed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, inquest?&rdquo; Leif said, sharply. &ldquo;Nobody  said anything about an inquest. As I told you, you read too many detective  stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t read as many as you do,&rdquo; Tonka stated, tranquilly.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all wrapped up in one now. That new one, about the man who killed his  wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If his wife was like you, I don&rsquo;t blame him much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Leif,&rdquo; Isabel admonished him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go with  us, Elaine, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I don&rsquo;t see why not. I love yachting parties, and  I&rsquo;ll be glad to get away from this atmosphere. I daresay Peter&rsquo;s brothers will  come&mdash;one of them, anyway. I&rsquo;m still friendly with the family, you know, but I  don&rsquo;t care about seeing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be gone a week and maybe longer,&rdquo; Leif told her.  &ldquo;If Isabel keeps well she&rsquo;ll enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you well, dear? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I feel sort of gone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone where?&rdquo; Tonka inquired, solicitously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just gone. You are a dumb bunny, Tonka, but you must know  what that gone feeling is. I&rsquo;m limp and weak, I stumble when I walk, my head  feels thick and woozy, and I haven&rsquo;t any zip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leif stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, dear, you were all right yesterday,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what  has come over you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind, you wouldn&rsquo;t think it was anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his secret heart Leif was conscious of a growing  conviction that it was entirely conceivable that a man could feel he was  justified in doing away with his wife, and it did seem that Isabel went out of  her way to fling mean speeches at him.</p>
<p>But as he looked at the hurt expression on her lovely  face, he knew himself for a brute, and he said, gently;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do, dear. And your face looks red, doesn&rsquo;t it,  Elaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little, but it looks to me like sunburn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, too. I&rsquo;m always telling Isabel she goes in too  strong for sunbaths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; Tonka declared. &ldquo;When she isn&rsquo;t  stretched out on the lawn, letting the sun pour down on her, she&rsquo;s in the sun  parlor, where the glare is hotter than out of doors. But it&rsquo;s only on the left  side of her face. See? She always sleeps that side up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Tonka,&rdquo; Leif interposed. &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of late,&rdquo; Isabel said. &ldquo;For the last two or three  days, the left side of my face has seemed to be burned through. But the  sunshine is good for me. The doctor said so, and I like it. Anyway, sunburn  doesn&rsquo;t make me feel wobbly when I walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The yacht trip will knock all those doldrums out of you,&rdquo; Leif  said, cheerily. &ldquo;Once you get on the water, all the queer feelings will fly  away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they will,&rdquo; echoed Tonka. &ldquo;You often have a  spell like this, darling. It&rsquo;s an over dose of sunburn, and it makes you feel  upset. Let&rsquo;s go home now, and I&rsquo;ll play nurse and fix you up all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left Elaine&rsquo;s house but didn&rsquo;t go home at once, for  Isabel said she must stop at the Garrisons&rsquo; and invite them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go there, if you&rsquo;re feeling rocky,&rdquo; Leif urged her.  &ldquo;I can stop and invite them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that wouldn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo; Isabel was very decided. &ldquo;Fleda is  the only other woman to be asked, and I must do it myself. I&rsquo;m all right. You  make too much fuss over a bit of sunburn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they stopped at the Garrisons&rsquo; and found them at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a horrible thing has happened over at the Inn,&rdquo; Fleda burst out after a hurried greeting. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Mrs.  Vernon in hysterics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know Elaine better than that?&rdquo; and Isabel  frowned at her. &ldquo;Indeed she isn&rsquo;t in hysterics, she&rsquo;s as calm and composed as  they come. And why not? She&rsquo;s no relation to Peter Tolman since her divorce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know that; but still it must upset her. Sit here,  Isabel, why, how you&rsquo;re burned. You overdo that sunning racket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it&rsquo;s nothing. I went to sleep in the sun parlor  and I had a longer sunbath than I intended. It&rsquo;ll be all right in a day or two.  We came to ask you two dears to go on a yachting party with us. Start next  Monday and stay till we come back. How about it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, about it,&rdquo; exclaimed hearty Jim Garrison. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re  just awful happy to go. Eh, Fleda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, rather! You know, Leif, there&rsquo;s nothing I enjoy like  your sailing parties. Tell us all about it. Will Elaine go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, why not?&rdquo; Isabel spoke a little curtly,  and Tonka added, &ldquo;Elaine is crazy to go; she adores our sailing parties, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she have to appear at the inquest?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there to be an inquest?&rdquo; Leif asked, a little sharply.  &ldquo;We have just been talking with Fleming Stone, and he said nothing about an  inquest. Did you hear of it at the Inn, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Garrison looked a trifle embarrassed. &ldquo;I guess we  just sort of assumed there would be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assumed it,&rdquo; Fleda owned up. &ldquo;Jim didn&rsquo;t. But won&rsquo;t  there have to be one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t tell yet, I think,&rdquo; Leif said, gently; &ldquo;you  see Fleda, it&rsquo;s rather a mysterious death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever they do about it,&rdquo; Isabel observed, &ldquo;it will be  all over by the time we get back, if not, indeed, before we start. I don&rsquo;t  believe for a minute anybody murdered Peter Tolman. Who would have any motive?  Either he did it himself, feeling he wanted to end it all, or it was an  accident of some sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; put in Tonka, &ldquo;maybe the peach pits did it after  all. You know one of the doctors thinks that&rsquo;s the explanation, and it may well  be so. One doctor knows as much as another&mdash;or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Garrison agreed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always heard that a steady  diet of those things would get you, in the long run. That&rsquo;s what did for  Tolman. I don&rsquo;t believe anyone murdered him, either, Isabel. Don&rsquo;t let it damp  the spirits of our party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; and Isabel rose to go. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll depend on you  two, then. It isn&rsquo;t a big party, but a carefully chosen one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one of her most cordial smiles, Isabel said her  good-bys and went away with her family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all invited now,&rdquo; she said, as they reached the  street, &ldquo;except Leo Jewett. You go around and see him, Leif, and Tonka and I  will go home. I feel tired and want to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; Tonka said, as she and Isabel walked the  tree-shaded street, &ldquo;they make a lot of fuss about that dead man. He&rsquo;s of no  national importance, he seems to have no friends, and yet they&rsquo;re as concerned  as if a president had been shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; what they&rsquo;re doing is the regular routine in case  of any unexplained death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just having that big detective on the job makes it a  big case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Fleming Stone is in charge officially. He&rsquo;s  interested because he happens to be staying at the Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, all right. If it doesn&rsquo;t interfere with the  yacht trip, I don&rsquo;t care what they do. Look, Isabel! Isn&rsquo;t that Mr. Stone, down  the street, coming this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was, and they saw Stone turn in at their own gateway,  before they reached it themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for us,&rdquo; Tonka called out, as she ran ahead. They  waited for Isabel to join them and the three went into the house together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came for a bit of talk with Mr. Murray,&rdquo; Stone told  them. &ldquo;Is he at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be, very soon,&rdquo; Isabel said; &ldquo;sit down and talk  to us till he comes. Is there any further development in the Tolman case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but nothing startling. Mr. Kenton telegraphed to  Paul Tolman, Peter&rsquo;s brother, in California,  told him of Peter&rsquo;s death and asked for instructions. Paul telephoned back,  asking for more details, and then said, to do nothing definite until he came.  Said he was leaving by aeroplane at once, and will be here tomorrow morning.  So, of course, everything waits on his arrival. I&rsquo;ve made some inquiries at the  Inn about the late Mr. Tolman, but the replies  I got were so contradictory and so vague, that I determined to ask Mr. Murray  for a little more information. Perhaps you will do as well, if you don&rsquo;t mind  being questioned a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll tell you anything I can. Who is in  charge of it all? Mr. Kenton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. It&rsquo;s in the coroner&rsquo;s hands now. Dr Coles, and a  mighty good chap he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll have an inquest, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Tonka broke in on  the conversation. &ldquo;Can I go to it? Oh, Mr. Stone, you get me a pass, or an  invitation or whatever does the trick! Won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about it,&rdquo; Stone said, glancing at the girl and  then turning back to Isabel. &ldquo;One thing I&rsquo;d like to know concerns Mr. Tolman&rsquo;s  financial status. Had he money of his own, or was his wife the wealthy one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not entirely sure,&rdquo; Isabel told him, &ldquo;but I think Mr.  Tolman was not a rich man. He did not depend entirely on his wife&rsquo;s income, but  Elaine&rsquo;s people were very well off and her father gave her a large allowance  and kept it up after she was married. There was no question of alimony, for  Elaine did not want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why Mr. Tolman was staying at the Inn, this summer? He seems to have had few friends there.  Was he here because he was still fond of his one-time wife?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I have a vague idea Mr. Tolman was in  some large business deal, and one of the other men concerned was spending the  summer at our Inn. This place is quite a  summer resort, you know. So Mr. Tolman came, a week or two ago, to see that  man. I don&rsquo;t know who he is, but Mr. Murray knows and will tell you all he can.  Do you want him to go to see you, or can you wait here a while longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much longer, I&rsquo;m afraid. Then, I take it, Mrs. Murray,  you didn&rsquo;t know Mr. Tolman very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not well at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And even as she spoke the words, Isabel went very white,  and fell back in her chair in a dead faint. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  Paul Breezes In</b></h2>
<p>WHEN Leif returned to his home, Doctor Craddock was just  leaving the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; Leif inquired; &ldquo;any of the servants got the  colic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Craddock said, gravely. &ldquo;I came over to see your  wife. She had a fainting spell, and Tonka telephoned for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isabel! fainted? Let me go to her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with  her. But we must take care of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re simple, but I want them followed. Sit down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat on a lawn bench, and Craddock went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost positive there&rsquo;s nothing really the matter  with her, but she fainted suddenly and was unconscious they tell me for ten or  fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonka and Mr. Stone; the detective, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leif looked perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Stone say anything to make her keel over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. When I arrived he went right away. I  saw he thought his presence was an intrusion. Tonka was in charge and Jenny,  the maid, was hovering about. I called Simmons and helped him get Mrs. Murray  upstairs and on her bed. She came back to consciousness then, and was a little  rambling, but quite sensible. Jenny and Tonka made her comfortable, I gave her  a sedative, and when she wakes, she&rsquo;ll be all right, I&rsquo;m sure. But I want her  kept quiet, and not subjected to any strain or excitement, mentally or  physically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what happened to her? What ails her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say for certain. But it seems like sunstroke. She  walked quite a bit this morning, Tonka says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But only on shady streets, and it isn&rsquo;t a hot  day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, she&rsquo;s been overdoing that sun bathing she&rsquo;s so  crazy about. Women are hipped on that subject nowadays. You must see that she  gives up those long and frequent sunbaths. All right for some women but not for  her. And don&rsquo;t let her get excited. Is she worried over this Peter Tolman  business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not worried, but greatly interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because he was the husband of Elaine Vernon, Isabel&rsquo;s  very close friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mean to shut her up in the house, but stop  that ridiculous sun bathing, and don&rsquo;t let her get excited over the Tolman  case. I left some medicine for her, and if she comes along all right, Tonka can  do for her, with Jenny&rsquo;s help. But if she doesn&rsquo;t improve, I&rsquo;ll send over a  nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re planning a yachting trip for next week, will it be  all right for her to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best thing in the world for her. Let her stay out on deck  a lot, but not in the glaring sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her face is very sunburned on one side; did you notice  that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I think that will pass off if she stays in the  shade. Make it clear to her she must stop that going to sleep in the broiling  sun. Will she see reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t like to see it. I&rsquo;ll do what I can, but you  must keep an eye on her. Of course, she&rsquo;ll obey your directions, when she won&rsquo;t  listen to mine. She&rsquo;s a headstrong piece, that little girl of mine. How did  Tonka behave? Is she a good nurse? If not we&rsquo;ll have the trained sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonka is all right, if all goes well. I&rsquo;m not alarmed  about Mrs. Murray, but there are some symptoms I don&rsquo;t like. I&rsquo;ll drop in this  evening and take a look at her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor went away and Leif took the veranda steps two  at a time.</p>
<p>In the living-room he met Tonka who was waiting for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you talking to the doctor,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let  him alarm you too much. Isabel is all right, just a little overcome by the  heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t a real hot day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was for her. Then she&rsquo;s sort of worked up over Elaine  and the Tolman excitement, and she just collapsed. It&rsquo;s nothing, and if she&rsquo;s  let alone, she&rsquo;ll be all right by tomorrow. I don&rsquo;t want a nurse. Jenny is good  and I know a lot about nursing. But you keep out of it, and when you do see her  don&rsquo;t talk of serious matters, just chaff her, and pet her up. Did the doctor  tell you she could go on the yacht?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he said it would do her good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he told me. Now, we&rsquo;ll keep her quiet until  we start, and she&rsquo;ll be queen of the party. Don&rsquo;t worry, Leif, if there&rsquo;s the  least necessity, I&rsquo;ll tell the doctor to get us a trained nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good girl, Tonka. Sometimes I mistrust you, but  I believe you&rsquo;re sound at heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all of that,&rdquo; and Tonka went away, about her  business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer child,&rdquo; Leif mused, looking after her. &ldquo;Sometimes I  think she&rsquo;s a born fool, and then she blossoms out into a sweet sensible  person. And yet no comeliness that I should desire her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dawdled about the house, feeling at loose ends.</p>
<p>He and Tonka had luncheon together and it seemed a desert  without Isabel&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t storm at me Leif, but can&rsquo;t I go to the inquest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you can give me a good sound reason why you want  to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I have what you would call a good sound  reason. I just want to go, to see how it&rsquo;s carried on. How managed, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and what do you want to know that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just so I&rsquo;ll know things. You like to know things,  don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know most things already. And I know why you want to go  to the inquest to see how it&rsquo;s managed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, smarty, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you want to write a detective story, and you want  to know the mechanism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tonka looked chagrined for a moment, and then she burst  into laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good guess!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;and exactly right! Oh, Leif, do  you think I can do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. You may as well make a try at it. Gosh, Tonka, but  I&rsquo;m restless. I don&rsquo;t know what to do. Want a game of tennis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to leave Isabel. I don&rsquo;t have to be with  her every minute, but I must be within call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After luncheon she went back upstairs, and Leif wandered  round the rooms in search of entertainment. In the library he found a pile of  books, new ones just arrived. He glimpsed them carelessly, looking for a  detective story. He found one entitled EVER WIDENING.</p>
<p>H&rsquo;m, he said to himself. I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s a tale of why he  killed his wife. How does it run, now? Oh, yes; &ldquo;It is the little rift within  the lute, That by and by will make the music mute, And ever widening, slowly  silence all.&rdquo; Slowly silence all. Yes&mdash;he looked through the pages &mdash;he saw that  it was that same tale over again, and was about to discard it, when a paragraph  caught his eye. It ran:&mdash;&ldquo;Karl loved his wife with a deep passionate affection,  but there were moments when he knew, solemnly, he never wanted to see her  again, never could bear to look at her again. It was in one of these moments  that he killed her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned back to the title-page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Translated From The Danish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He might have known. He did know those Danish stories&mdash;blunt,  strong, often gruesome, but always true to human nature. He was tired of  Crippen yarns, as he called them, but this author wrote well, more than well,  he was a master worker in words.</p>
<p>Taking the book, he flung himself into a long easy chair  by the window and gave himself up to the print.</p>
<p>Tonka came in and drawing near she looked over his  shoulder at the chapter title at top of the page.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall you never learn how to kill your wife?&rdquo; she cried  gaily. &ldquo;Well you&rsquo;ve a chance now. Isabel wants to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leif jumped up quickly and hastened up the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The glad cry with which he greeted the invalid gave no hint  of homicidal intent, and he pushed the slender form farther back, as he sat  down on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>Leif was not of the bromidic type that says, &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;how much better you are looking! Your sleep did you good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;I feel a lot better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Leif Murray knew his contradictory wife too well to be  fooled by this gently spoken agreement.</p>
<p>If she had felt better she would have complained lustily  of pains and aches and miseries, till she made herself out a feminine Job.</p>
<p>He observed, too, a faint trace of eruption on her left  cheek, noting a careful application of skin lotion and powder evidently meant  to hide it.</p>
<p>He smiled at her with deep affection, and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  worry about your schoolgirl complexion, nothing can harm that, it&rsquo;s perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it, Leif? Well, what <i>is</i> the matter with me? I don&rsquo;t like  this fainting in coils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Temporary reversion to Victorianism, that&rsquo;s all. Your  grandmother used to be cutting up that trick all the time. But while you&rsquo;re in  such a submissive frame of mind, I&rsquo;m going to tell you that Craddock says you  must follow his orders implicitly or you&rsquo;ll have a nervous breakdown or some of  those tiresome things. He says, if you obey his laws, you&rsquo;ll be not only able  to go on the yacht trip, but it will do you a heap of good. So be Angel Child  and do as you&rsquo;re told, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just give over those excessive sunbaths and sun naps,  and act normally about such things. The fainting spell you had was a sort of  sunstroke, though you weren&rsquo;t in the sun at the moment. Oh, Lord, Isabel, why  do I have to tell you these things as if you were a baby? You must see the  common sense of not boiling yourself to death in the hot sun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isabel looked at him, her beautiful blue eyes full of  reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were suffering as I am, Leif, I wouldn&rsquo;t be so  cruel to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not cruel, Silly! Just because I want you to get well  of whatever ails you, and get that red burn and that eruption off of your  beautiful face. Do you feel like getting up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like anything. You&rsquo;re so cross and horrid,  and I&rsquo;m so ill and ailing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craddock wants you to have a trained nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t want one. I&rsquo;d rather have Tonka. She has a  kind heart, much more thoughtful and gentle than yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know you&rsquo;re getting well! When you begin to  ballyrag me, it means you feel better. I&rsquo;ll bet tomorrow, you&rsquo;ll be your own  sweet wilful, wayward self again. Hooray for our Isabel! She always comes out  on top!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so noisy. Have you heard anything further from  the Inn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more to hear. The police have locked everything  up and shut everything down until the arriving Tolman gets here. I say, dear,  do you know anything about Pete Tolman&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will? Mercy, no. Did he make one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea. I fancy he hadn&rsquo;t much to make a will of.  But I&rsquo;ll bet that will be the first thing brother Paul asks about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How suspicious you are. Because you are callous hearted  and have no sympathy for another&rsquo;s sorrow, you think other men are all like  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Seraph, don&rsquo;t scarify me. I daresay Paul is  inconsolable over Peter&rsquo;s death. But his financial affairs will have to be  settled up. That&rsquo;s none of our business, though, and I hope Elaine doesn&rsquo;t get  mixed up in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go again! Why suggest such unpleasant things?  Elaine has no more to do with Peter Tolman and his will than I have. When  you&rsquo;re divorced from a man, you&rsquo;re through with him for good and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that humoring air. I hate to be talked to as if I were  imbecile! Can&rsquo;t you go away, and then perhaps I can get a little sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ll go away, darling. I didn&rsquo;t know you  wanted to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leif kissed his wife gently, smiled at her and left the  room.</p>
<p>In the afternoon he drifted over to the Inn.</p>
<p>To his surprise, things there were pretty much as usual.  The body of Peter Tolman had been removed to the mortuary, and Innkeeper Kenton  had resumed his customary smile and bland manner.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone was seated in one of the continuous line of  porch rockers, and he rose to greet Murray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is your wife?&rdquo; Stone asked, as the two men went  around to a less thickly populated veranda; &ldquo;all right again, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&rdquo;; Leif said. &ldquo;Or nearly. She had taken a rather  long walk and it keeled her over. She&rsquo;ll be all right tomorrow. Anything doing  over here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but what I&rsquo;m doing myself. I&rsquo;d much better keep  out of it, but as a case it intrigues me. I can&rsquo;t help seeing it as a murder, and  yet, there&rsquo;s no killer in sight, and no motive that anybody knows of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why think it criminal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of my hunches. Interesting conditions. Man crazy  about peach pits, dies of prussic acid poisoning. Strong medical authority  against the possibility of peach pits doing the trick. So what? So some human  hand assisted the pits and somehow added some real prussic acid to the deadly  dose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very plausible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; what ingenious murder is? If I could find out  anything, I&rsquo;d take a real interest in the case or I&rsquo;d throw it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who found the body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A chambermaid, going in on her evening tour of the rooms.  Sensible girl; didn&rsquo;t scream or raise any fuss, just went down and told Mr. Kenton  quietly. He told her to keep still about it, but of course it was all over the  hotel in ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Tolman have any strange visitors yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None known of. I&rsquo;m looking for romance. Was there any  lingering affection between him and his former wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. For heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t drag Mrs. Vernon into this  thing! Poor woman, must that brute pester her even after he is dead? The police  aren&rsquo;t suspecting her, are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Why should they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea. I&rsquo;ve no interest in the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were in love with her before you met Mrs. Murray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leif smiled, good-naturedly. &ldquo;Now, who told you that? Yes,  it&rsquo;s true, I suppose, but when I met Isabel all thoughts of Elaine went right  out of my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think she cared. She married Tolman soon  after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t any backward looks in her direction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone wondered the other man didn&rsquo;t knock him down for his  impertinence, but Leif only said; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, no! Isabel is all I can look after. She&rsquo;s a  handful, but such a wonder-girl. You&rsquo;ve seen her at a disadvantage; just now  she&rsquo;s suffering from a bad case of sunburn. But we&rsquo;re going for a spot of  yachting and that will bring her round all right. Maybe you&rsquo;d like to go with  us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next Monday. A week or ten days, just drifting about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I leave the question open? Until I see how Paul  Tolman shapes up? I&rsquo;d love to accept your invitation, but I can&rsquo;t say yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Let me know when you decide. Mrs. Murray  will be greatly pleased to have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>Early the next morning Paul Tolman came.</p>
<p>Wind and weather had favored his flight from California, and he  reached Van Winkle Inn about nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>A big man, of aggressive bearing and strong determined  face.</p>
<p>He strode to the desk and demanded the proprietor.</p>
<p>Kenton fairly jumped into view and led his new guest  quickly into his own private office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to my brother?&rdquo; Tolman asked, almost  belligerently. &ldquo;What did he die of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kenton told him all he knew. Ignoring his listener&rsquo;s  interruptions, the Innkeeper gave him the straight story; concluding with a  somewhat definite request that Mr. Paul Tolman would take over and take care of  all future arrangements or provisions for Mr. Peter Tolman and his affairs and  estate, and that Mr. Kenton, Innkeeper, should have no further responsibility  for any Mr. Tolman, past, present or to come.</p>
<p>Mr. Kenton further explained that the untimely death had  already done incalculable harm to his hostelry, and any further developments of  the tragedy would doubtless prove the wreck and ruin of his popular and well-kept  inn, and he fervently hoped Mr. Paul Tolman&rsquo;s stay would be short.</p>
<p>Mr. Paul Tolman looked at the speaker with cold disdain,  and gave him to understand that he had no slightest interest in the welfare of  his negligible inn, but that he proposed to investigate his brother&rsquo;s death,  letting the chips fall wherever their fancy led them.</p>
<p>One word might have led to another, save that Fleming  Stone, without so much as a tap at the door, intruded upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kenton,&rdquo; he said, pleasantly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re wanted at the desk,  and if you agree, I&rsquo;d like to carry off Mr. Tolman to breakfast with me in my  rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly pleased to shift the burden of responsibility to  Fleming Stone&rsquo;s competent shoulders, the Innkeeper agreed and the two men went  off together.</p>
<p>Stone ordered a well-chosen breakfast, and soon Paul  Tolman was doing full justice to it, and asking questions at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kenton gave me the main facts,&rdquo; he said to the detective,  &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t get it. Who the hell would want to kill Peter? Me, now, I have  hordes of enemies, but Peter couldn&rsquo;t help making friends. They just fell for  him every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we are down to brass tacks,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;I may as  well say that your brother had few friends around these parts. Not many give  him the good word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s dead now. But never mind that. What  did he die of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about his fondness for peach pits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all about it. He had that habit as a boy. Mother  went to see several doctors about it. They all laughed at her fears. Said all  the peaches that ever grew couldn&rsquo;t give up enough prussic acid to kill a man,  just by eating the kernels. If he distilled them, that was a different matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But some doctors say that the accumulation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know all that. And it&rsquo;s all poppycock. Anyway, the  coroner must settle that question. Where&rsquo;s Elaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vernon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. His wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not his wife of late, was she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a lawyer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; though I know some points of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind that now. Tell me this. Have they found  Pete&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of. But I think his belongings are locked  up, waiting for you. Had he a large estate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know my brother very well, do you?&rdquo; and Tolman  smiled wryly. &ldquo;No, Peter never had a large estate, but he was this way. He&rsquo;d  make a lot and then he&rsquo;d lose a lot. So if he died after a good transaction of  some sort, he&rsquo;d have something to leave. While if he died right after one of  his failures, he probably left only debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why was he here, just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know. You see, if he left no will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then his family connections inherit, I suppose. You have  a brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a mother. But then, there&rsquo;s Elaine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But unless Peter left a will, Mrs. Vernon can&rsquo;t inherit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether she can or not. Never mind that now.  Did you say Peter&rsquo;s private papers were awaiting my investigation? Lead me to  &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tolman rose from his hearty breakfast, with the air of a  general preparing to rush to the battlefield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside my jurisdiction,&rdquo; Stone told him. &ldquo;All in the  hands of the police. They&rsquo;ll soon show up. The inquest will be held this  afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to get busy. Can&rsquo;t I telephone headquarters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d answer me one or two questions first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away. You&rsquo;ve been first-rate to me, what can I do  for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me a few personal bits of information. I assure you  they will be kept confidential, unless, of course, justice demands them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead. I know your reputation and I trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever known your brother Peter to be engaged in  or mixed up in any business or adventure not strictly and absolutely aboveboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul looked serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to answer you truly,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;but I  don&rsquo;t know. I have never known of any such thing, but &mdash;I have suspected it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Tolman, for your frankness. Do you have  any reason to think Mr. Peter was here this year to further or engage in any such  deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again I can only say, that while I have a slight  suspicion such was the case, I have no real reason to think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one more query. Do you think your brother came here  with any intent or any hope of making up with Mrs. Vernon and marrying her over  again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he had such a hope, but I think he had little to  found it on. I am very sure Elaine would never have&mdash; er&mdash;remarried him, but I am  also sure he greatly wanted her to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were not happy together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody could be happy with Peter. He was my brother, he  had great charm and was an all-round attractive fellow, but he was cruel to  women&mdash;even brutal. Elaine did well to get free of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think she would not have again put her head in the  noose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed she would not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  Tonka Takes A Bow</b></h2>
<p>CORONER COLES was a fine looking man with a head of very  curly auburn hair which gave more than a hint of being professionally  marcelled. At least it was much curlier some days than others, but that might  have been the effect of the weather.</p>
<p>He had amber-colored eyes, with a glint that boded ill for  any witness trying to give a false impression by his evidence.</p>
<p>Greatly to Innkeeper Kenton&rsquo;s relief, the inquest was held  at the Town Hall and not at the Inn.</p>
<p>Though the crowd of visitors filled the place, there were  few witnesses to be called. The first was Norah, the chambermaid who had  discovered the body. The girl was calm and of respectful manners and answered  questions promptly and clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take care of Mr. Tolman&rsquo;s rooms?&rdquo; asked Coles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you perhaps know of Mr. Tolman&rsquo;s peculiar habit of  eating peach pits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir. I bring him some whenever I have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can open the pits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; Norah looked at her small and  pretty hands without a trace of self-consciousness, &ldquo;It takes a knack to do  that. It&rsquo;s just like opening oysters, you put the point of the knife in just  the right place, and the pit just zips apart! Mr. Tolman could do it with his  eyes shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then he ate the kernals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did he! He was just dotty about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had no fear that they would poison him? He didn&rsquo;t want  to die, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; I don&rsquo;t think so. But one day he said: &lsquo;Norah,  some day I&rsquo;ll kill myself eating these things.&rsquo; But he laughed&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t mean  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a pleasant spoken gentleman, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Sometimes he gave me a luck penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was nice of him. Now, Norah, when you went in his  room, Monday night, what was he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had two rooms, sir; a bedroom and a small sitting  room. He was in the sitting room, by the open window. He wasn&rsquo;t reading or  anything, just leaning back in his big chair. But he looked queer, oh, he  looked terrible! His arms were stretched out and his legs were sort of bent,  and his head was thrown way back, and his eyes glaring and shiny like. That&rsquo;s  enough about it, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Norah,&rdquo; Coles nodded at her kindly. &ldquo;You may go. If  I have to, I&rsquo;ll call you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl gladly went away, and Paul Tolman was called  next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will hear the medical evidence later,&rdquo; the coroner  said; &ldquo;will you tell us, Mr. Tolman, about this strange taste of your brother&rsquo;s  for peach kernels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never looked upon it as anything strange,&rdquo; Paul Tolman  declared. &ldquo;I had a school chum who used to chew slate pencils. That was far  more peculiar. Peter liked the bitter taste of the kernels and ate all he could  get. Some people said they&rsquo;d kill him and some said they wouldn&rsquo;t. Who shall  decide when doctors disagree? But I don&rsquo;t see where the mystery or even  uncertainty comes in. A chap eats peach kernels all his life, then he dies of  prussic acid poisoning. Why assume murder? You have cause and effect, what more  do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not considering that question now, Mr. Tolman.  Have you any reason to think your brother would take his own life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I most certainly have not. Peter was a happy-go-lucky  sort, he took things as they came, but he liked to live, of that I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve understood he threatened suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he did he didn&rsquo;t mean it? Why all the fuss? He ate  peach pits all his life. He died of them. Why call it murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to be sure of our facts, Mr. Tolman. Was your  brother on good terms with all your family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. A good-natured guy was Pete. I&rsquo;m sorry he&rsquo;s  gone, but we must all die some time. Yes, he was always fond of his happy home.  A rover, but sure to turn up sooner or later with presents for all and sundry.  As his legal representative, I suppose his belongings will be turned over to  me. I&rsquo;d be glad to have that little matter attended to and get away. I&rsquo;m a busy  business man, and I can tell you I wasn&rsquo;t at all pleased to make this trip east  just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Mr. Tolman, but I can&rsquo;t let you start homeward just  yet. Yes, your brother&rsquo;s property will be turned over to you, and I wish you  would make search for any bit of evidence that might point to some useful  truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Tolman was quite evidently annoyed at his detention  and turned sulky, as might clearly be seen on his expressive face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, until I can find that mythical evidence, why am I  kept here in the witness chair. I&rsquo;ve told you all I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know for what purpose your brother came to Ingleside Heights this summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay there were several reasons. He likes this  place, he has been at the Inn before. He  probably had friends both at the Inn and in  residence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he perhaps come, for the purpose of renewing  acquaintance with his former wife, Mrs. Elaine Vernon?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I cannot tell you. I know he had great admiration  and respect for the lady, although they were divorced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tolman was allowed to stand down and the coroner called  the two doctors who had examined the dead man.</p>
<p>Doctor Barnett testified first.</p>
<p>He said that he was staying the summer at the Inn, that he had known Peter Tolman and that he knew of  his extraordinary fondness for peach kernels. Asked further as to their deadly  possibilities, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; it&rsquo;s all poppycock. No man could be killed by  the infinitesimal amount of prussic acid found in a peach stone kernel. While  cyanide is among the most deadly of poisons, it must be in a more concentrated  form to be a fatal dose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when Doctor Matson took the witness chair, he declared  that the long continued use of peach kernels as a diet caused a cumulative  poisoning of the system which must result sooner or later in death as a result  of prussic acid.</p>
<p>These opposing theories were discussed by the two doctors  until Coroner Coles put a stop to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot take the time now,&rdquo; he decreed, &ldquo;to settle that  complicated question. If you two physicians cannot decide to agree upon it, we  must get the opinion of some other authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon he dismissed the pair, and called Elaine to the  chair.</p>
<p>It was with a gentle dignity she moved across the room and  took her place as directed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were at one time the wife of Peter Tolman?&rdquo; Coles asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, not curtly, but with quiet acquiescence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you lived with him did he eat peach stone kernels  habitually?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did. It surprised me at first, but I grew used to his  peculiarity and thought nothing of it. The doctors I spoke to about it,  believed, as does Doctor Barnett, that they were in no way harmful to his  health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were then, greatly surprised to learn of his death  from that cause?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was surprised, of course. It was a revelation to me  that the kernels could have a fatal effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen Mr. Tolman since he has been in Ingleside Heights, this summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many times. He has been at my house, and I have met him  at the homes of my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were then, on friendly terms with Mr. Tolman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were friendly, yes. I see no reason why divorced  people should treat one another other than courteously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. Was Mr. Tolman still in love with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider that an impertinent question; but I will  answer it. I have no way of knowing the state of his feelings toward me, as I  never saw him alone during his stay here, and one does not discuss such matters  with others present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not see Mr. Peter Tolman alone, during his visit  at the Inn this summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was astonishing how much dignity Elaine could put into  her voice without seeming in any way resentful or annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call back the maid, Norah,&rdquo; Coles directed.</p>
<p>The girl came in, and stood before the coroner, quite  evidently ill at ease, and not looking at Elaine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norah,&rdquo; Doctor Coles said, &ldquo;you know this lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Norah&rsquo;s voice was faint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen her walking with Mr. Tolman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Even more faint came the accents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak up, girl. Where did you see them walking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the woods, one evening last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing in the woods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was walking, too, with my boy friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are sure you saw Mrs. Vernon with Mr. Tolman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do. You may go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah disappeared and the coroner turned to Elaine. &ldquo;Do  you care to explain this seeming discrepancy?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no explanation needed. The girl is in error. She  did not see me walking in the woods with Peter Tolman, because I did not do so.  You must choose between the veracity of the maid-servant and myself. I repeat  my denial of her statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no further interest in the man after you were  divorced from him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No interest of affection or intimacy. I met him as I  would meet any acquaintance, and though his sudden death is a shocking thing I  cannot feel deep personal emotion. You understand, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Doctor Coles&rsquo; bump of understanding had been a deep  cavity, the calm sympathy shown in Elaine&rsquo;s manner, and the sorrow in her deep,  dark eyes would have assured him of a tender compassion which even her  impersonal attitude failed to hide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me, Mrs. Vernon, anything about the  financial status of the late Mr. Tolman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The graceful eyebrows went up a trifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I cannot. I think Mr. Tolman was never a  rich man, but I think his fortunes varied, and his income was therefore  uncertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coroner Coles was famous in the county for his ability to  put very personal and impertinent questions with a suave air of uttering the  merest commonplaces. He tried it now, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had it occurred to you, Mrs. Vernon, that Mr. Tolman came  here to attempt to win you back again? To persuade you to re-marry him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Elaine looked at him.</p>
<p>Then she gave a brief, fleeting smile that held  unmistakable scorn and derision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What extraordinary questions you do ask,&rdquo; she said, in a  light tone that yet made Coles quiver with embarrassment in all his nerves. &ldquo;If  he had any such intention he didn&rsquo;t mention it to me. How shrewd of you to read  it into his purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, thank you, Mrs. Vernon. You are excused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elaine returned to her seat next Leif Murray, and retained her look of calm  indifference, which, however, was startled at the coroner&rsquo;s next words.</p>
<p>It was Coles&rsquo; habit to call his witnesses as he chose.  Often he had learned much that he wanted to know before an inquest was opened.</p>
<p>And often, too, he had surprise witnesses that gave  important and unexpected evidence. These he delighted to spring on his jury and  on the listening audience.</p>
<p>In a quiet, pleasant voice, he asked Miss Constance Mead  to take the witness chair.</p>
<p>Both Murray and Elaine Vernon stared as Tonka rose and  with absolute poise walked to the chair and sat down. She wore a white sports  frock, with a jade green scarf round her throat.</p>
<p>She had on no hat, and her flaxen bobbed hair hung thick  and straight across her forehead and over her ears.</p>
<p>With the appearance of a child anxious to do her duty, she  attentively awaited questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Mead, were you acquainted with the late Peter  Tolman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not definitely. I met him now and then at a cocktail  party or tennis match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you describe a recent occasion on which you heard  his conversation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. It was at the Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was up in a tree around on the north side of the Inn. That old sycamore, you know. It&rsquo;s a lovely place to  read of a summer afternoon, and I often take a book and go over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And from your perch you can hear conversation of people  on the veranda below?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put it that way.&rdquo; Tonka looked reproachful.  &ldquo;If people sit on that veranda and talk loudly, I can&rsquo;t help hearing them. But  they seldom do, and anyway, I never listen. Their chatter doesn&rsquo;t interest me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But on this occasion we speak of, it did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Mr. Tolman was talking with another man. I paid no  attention, until they raised their voices in anger, and then I couldn&rsquo;t help  hearing what they said. They were discussing some business deal, I gathered,  and they disagreed as to the amount of money each should receive. I didn&rsquo;t care  how the money was divided, and I had no interest in their talk, until I heard Mr.  Tolman say, &lsquo;I could put you in jail for that!&rsquo; And the other man said, &lsquo;No,  you couldn&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;d take precious good care that you didn&rsquo;t do that.&rsquo; And then Mr.  Tolman sounded a little scared-like, and he said, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s only one way you  could prevent me!&rsquo; and the other man said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the way I mean.&rsquo; And he  sounded murderous, and then one of them went away, I don&rsquo;t know which one, and  in a few minutes the other one went away. I didn&rsquo;t look down, for I didn&rsquo;t want  to be seen, and after they had gone I climbed down and went home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live with Mrs. Murray, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that is, I am making her a visit which I hope will  last all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Mead, answer carefully. Do you know who the man  was who talked with Mr. Tolman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell me his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Mr. Paley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Humbert Paley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Miss Mead. You are excused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tonka returned to her seat, with no apparent notice of the  amazed stares of many in the audience. She showed no trace of self-consciousness,  indeed she seemed to be thinking of something far away.</p>
<p>Immediately Humbert Paley was called to the stand. A large  man, with a jovial face, he showed a slight scowl of annoyance which changed to  a smile as he sat down and faced the jury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard the evidence of the last witness?&rdquo; he was  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you to say about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Unless there is something definite you want to  ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. Was the story true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the main details, yes. But, as often happens, the  witness stated her own interpretation of what she heard, and her statements  were incorrect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you, then, tell the gist of that session between you  and Peter Tolman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. Or, as much as I care to. Mr. Tolman and I  were deeply interested in a business project, the details of which I have no  intention of making public. It concerned a rather clever gadget connected with  radio manufacture, the nature of which I refuse to define any further. We were  about to put it on the market, and we were, not surprisingly, discussing the  financial arrangements of our contract. It may seem to you a public place to  talk over private business, but we had no thought of eavesdroppers in trees,  and anyway, the points we discussed were not desperately secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paley leaned back in the chair and let his glance wander  over the crowd, finally letting it come to rest on Tonka.</p>
<p>The girl looked at him without visible interest and then  looked away. It was quite clear that she didn&rsquo;t care what he said about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you, Mr. Paley,&rdquo; the coroner went on, &ldquo;make the  remarks to Mr. Tolman that the witness repeated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all as they were repeated.&rdquo; Paley smiled. &ldquo;Ladies  are admittedly inaccurate in their account of an incident or a speech, and I  fear Miss Mead misunderstood or misheard the conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what did you say to Mr. Tolman that could be  construed as a threat against his life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing as bad as that! We were discussing money  matters, and I think it is human nature to try to get all one can in a business  contract. We were both doing that, and I said something, I don&rsquo;t recollect  what, that Tolman construed as libel or slander or something of the sort, and  he remarked, in jest, of course, that he could jail me for that. I contradicted  him and he said there was only one way I could stop him. And I said I&rsquo;d take  that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what way did you mean, Mr. Paley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that I would retract my words, of course. I spoke  impulsively, and I was quite willing to take it back. To be sure, he couldn&rsquo;t  have put me in jail, and also he had no idea of my taking it seriously. But I  owed him an apology, and later, I made it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then it all blew over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. We resumed our discussion of our contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And came to an agreement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, the deal is too important to be held up  at this stage of its development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are you going to do, now that Mr. Tolman can no  longer assist in the enterprise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not yet decided, and I&rsquo;ve no intent of telling the  public when I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Paley gave his friendly smile, and the public were  with him to a man.</p>
<p>Though not a favorite in the community, Humbert Paley had  been known to show sympathy and support to some unfortunates and had rallied  and assisted some otherwise lost causes.</p>
<p>Leif Murray had never liked the man, but he knew of his  kindness and generosity. However, he was greatly annoyed at the fact that Paley  sometimes tagged after Isabel, though she, too was intolerant of him.</p>
<p>And now, Leif blamed Paley for the unnecessary and  unpleasant publicity given to Tonka. How Coles had found out about the sycamore  tree Leif didn&rsquo;t know, but he was quite ready to take Tonka to task for it,  when the time came.</p>
<p>As the girl sat, looking so calm and untroubled, he was  more than ever annoyed at her, and almost made up his mind to ask Isabel to send  her away.</p>
<p>Then Antony Ballard was called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t much to offer as evidence,&rdquo; he told the  coroner, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been looking up that peach pit business, and I find from  very competent authority, that all peach kernels are not alike. I mean as to  the amount of prussic acid they contain. Once in a while there is one that is  especially charged with it, and it may have been that Tolman struck one of  those, which would account for his sudden death. I got this from a man high up  in the toxicological department of a great laboratory, and I know he is a sound  scholar. If that occurred, then death was an accident, or as the lawyers call  it, an act of God. I only give out this information in hope it will be useful  to the coroner and the jury. I don&rsquo;t want anyone accused of murder unless we  are pretty sure murder has been done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Mr. Ballard,&rdquo; Coles agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like now,  to have Mr. Stone testify to his decisions so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone took the chair, looking grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I might agree entirely with Mr. Ballard,&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;but though it is quite true that an occasional peach stone holds more poison  than its neighbors, it is held by the experts that even that kernel would not  produce death. I am giving no advice, making no suggestions as to the jury&rsquo;s  procedure, but I trust further investigations will be made. I want to offer one  small piece of evidence that may or may not prove of importance. It is this  envelope, which I picked from the waste basket under the desk in the sitting  room of Mr. Tolman. There is inside it a faint odor of bitter almond, which  suggests that it was brought to Mr. Tolman with pits or kernels in it. It may  amount to nothing, but in my opinion it should be looked after and examined for  finger prints or any traces of its previous ownership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coles took the envelope, a plain white one, and sniffed at  it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I note the odor you mention, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I  quite agree that the matter must be looked into. There are also, other  questions that I feel ought to be answered before the case goes to the jury. I  therefore adjourn this inquest for such time as may be needed for these further  investigations. I will reconvene it at such a time as seems to me proper. This  audience is dismissed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A disappointed crowd surged out of the Town Hall.</p>
<p>Most of the audience had hoped for something more  sensational, had hoped, indeed, to be told that Peter Tolman had been foully  murdered.</p>
<p>It seemed an anti-climax to go to an inquest only to have  the thing adjourned for goodness knew how long.</p>
<p>Paul Tolman, who had watched and listened to the  proceedings came quickly to Fleming Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, excitedly; &ldquo;I want to engage your  services. I want you to work for me and me only. If you&rsquo;re tied up with anyone  else get out of it, and take on my case. I know Peter was killed, I know who  did it, but I&rsquo;ll have to tell you all about it before you can set to work.  You&rsquo;re at the Inn, I shall stay there, too, so  we can work together.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  The Impertinence Of Fleda Garrison</b></h2>
<p>ELAINE walked with Leif Murray back to Longacre, whither  Tonka had preceded them.</p>
<p>They found the girl pouring out the story of the inquest  to Isabel who listened languidly and seemed little interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonka,&rdquo; said Leif, as he followed Elaine into the  living-room, &ldquo;whatever possessed you to make such a holy show of yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I look all right?&rdquo; the girl cried, anxiously;  &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I, Elaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you looked all right,&rdquo; Leif answered her; &ldquo;but why  the interview? You must have volunteered the information that you had been  playing spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Isabel, putting her arm round  the girl, who was sitting beside her on a sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell, Elaine,&rdquo; Tonka said; &ldquo;Leif will make me out a  hellion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all right, Isabel,&rdquo; Elaine said, smiling, &ldquo;Tonka  just staged a scene of her own. Very effective, and she took a bow with <i>aplomb</i> and <i>&eacute;clat</i> and all such proper capers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what was it all about?&rdquo; Isabel persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you myself,&rdquo; Tonka decided. &ldquo;You know, Is, I  often go over to the Inn, and climb up in the  big sycamore, and loaf there I read and I muse and sometimes I drop to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you drop out of the tree does it wake you up?&rdquo; Leif  wanted to know, &ldquo;or do you sleep right through it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tonka went on, her yellow hair tousling in the  breeze that came in at the window, &ldquo;no, Leify dear, I don&rsquo;t ever fall out of  the tree. And I don&rsquo;t bother about the people on the veranda under me. But this  time I did hear an important conversation, and I thought I ought to pass on my  information to that nice, mushy looking coroner. And I did, and bless you, he  said I must tell it to a waiting world at the inquest. Also, which I done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe down, Tonka,&rdquo; Leif commanded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go on.&rdquo; He did,  and told Isabel the conversation which Tonka had overheard from her perch in  the tree.</p>
<p>He implied no blame to the girl, he gave a straight story,  mimicking Tonka&rsquo;s voice a little, which made Elaine laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Tonka, triumphantly, as Leif finished; &ldquo;where  was the harm in that? It gave the jury information, and I performed my duty to  my country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do keep still, Tonka,&rdquo; Leif said, curtly; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had  your little show-off, now give your betters a chance to talk. What do you think  about it all, Elaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I wish it had happened anywhere else  than here. I can&rsquo;t believe Pete was murdered, that&rsquo;s too spectacular. Of  course, it wasn&rsquo;t suicide, he didn&rsquo;t want to die when he had this project on  hand. I know all about that; it&rsquo;s his own invention, mostly, and he wants to  get it patented and put on the market. I don&rsquo;t want to tell anything about it,  for I don&rsquo;t think I have a right to. It&rsquo;s Mr. Paul Tolman&rsquo;s property now, of  course, and particulars must be asked of him. But surely, Peter wouldn&rsquo;t step  off when the matter was pending. I don&rsquo;t see why they have to be so fussy. He  ate prussic acid all the time, he died of prussic acid, why not say &lsquo;cause and  effect&rsquo; and let it go at that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Paley in this business with Peter?&rdquo; Leif asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Elaine replied, &ldquo;but from Tonka&rsquo;s story it  seems he must have been. Let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t bother about it any more. I&rsquo;m glad you  didn&rsquo;t go to the inquest, Isabel; it was deadly dull. Tonka&rsquo;s piece was the  only bright spot in it. Let&rsquo;s talk about the yacht. You&rsquo;re getting better,  aren&rsquo;t you, dear? I&rsquo;m so glad. Your face is much less red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Elaine, it isn&rsquo;t better. It&rsquo;s worse in some  ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will get better, once you&rsquo;re on the yacht. You always  love it, and it will set you up right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only hope so,&rdquo; Isabel tried to smile, with but partial  success. &ldquo;But I feel so weak and when I try to think, a sort of stupor comes  over me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the menace of today,&rdquo; Leif said, gaily. &ldquo;Dear  Heart, you mustn&rsquo;t try to think. You may bring on cerebro-vacuum or something  like that. I&rsquo;ll do your thinking for you, and you just devote your energies to  getting back your kindergarten complexion. You&rsquo;re awful red at the back of your  neck&mdash;haven&rsquo;t been lying prone in the sun again, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, I&rsquo;ve given up all sun treatments. <i>Unberufen!</i> here comes Fleda Garrison  across the lawn. I don&rsquo;t want to see her, I&rsquo;m going up to my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it!&rdquo; cried Leif. &ldquo;You look all right. If  you&rsquo;re going to be with her all next week, she may as well get used to your  super-rosy cheeks. Don&rsquo;t faint, that&rsquo;s all I ask of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleda breezed in, flung her wide-leafed hat on the floor,  and plumped herself down on a big, soft leather hassock.</p>
<p>She was an alert little person, with shining brown eyes  and auburn dyed hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think it&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; she fretted, &ldquo;to call poor old  Pete&rsquo;s death a murder! Why, we never have such things here in Ingleside!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s calling it a murder?&rdquo; Leif asked her. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t  decided so at the inquest. Weren&rsquo;t you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t I there! Isabel, your husband is the rudest person  on record. Wasn&rsquo;t I there! Why, Leif, I shook hands with you three times, and  every time you said, &lsquo;Hello, Fleda, I didn&rsquo;t know you were here!&rsquo; I told Jim,  and he said he&rsquo;d never speak to you again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Jim, he&rsquo;ll lose a lot,&rdquo; Leif said. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t go on  the yacht with us, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we&rsquo;ll be there. But you must remember we <i>are</i> there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; and Leif smiled into the saucy face that  looked up at him.</p>
<p>Then Leopold Jewett came, and in his careless easygoing  way, he greeted Isabel, nodded at the others, pulled Tonka&rsquo;s hair and settled  himself in a deep stuffy armchair, behind a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kicketty-go about poor old Tolman won&rsquo;t delay your  cruise, will it?&rdquo; he asked of Isabel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not. I think it will be all over before we  start, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure to. Coles is a dabster at settling up. He&rsquo;ll reopen  the inquiry, in a day or two, and then he&rsquo;ll push through to a finish of  accidental death, or murder by person or persons unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you look for a murder element?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, Leif, the detective feller, that Stone&mdash; he  can make two mysteries grow where one grew before. And something tells me that  chap is scenting foul play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That all you&rsquo;ve got to go by&mdash;your vivid imagination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; I&rsquo;ve lots of secret knowledge that I daren&rsquo;t  tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried Tonka; &ldquo;you must tell us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, girl,&rdquo; Leif scolded her. &ldquo;Mr. Jewett is guying  you. He doesn&rsquo;t know any more than we do, if as much. It&rsquo;s all too bad, Leo,  but drop it now, will you? My women folks love to mull over its more gruesome  points, but I&rsquo;m getting fed up with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, at that. Answer me a few asks about your  party, and I&rsquo;ll be for moving on. May I take my camera, my big one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Isabel, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m camera shy  just now.&rdquo; She turned her left cheek toward Jewett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what is it? poison ivy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, maybe it is!&rdquo; Tonka cried; &ldquo;I never thought of  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; and Leif looked a little relieved. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re  right, Leo. We feared something more exotic. Poison ivy is bad enough, Lord  knows, but it&rsquo;s better than Kyauktaw Tetter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to him, Leo,&rdquo; Isabel said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just making  up. I&rsquo;m all right, or I shall be by Monday, and I&rsquo;ll be glad to get away from  this murder infested town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, don&rsquo;t exaggerate. It&rsquo;s only a nine days&rsquo;  wonder. It will be all forgotten when we get back. Why, the brother Tolman is  going back to California  tomorrow, taking the late Peter with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rdquo; said Tonka. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of  inquests. I go to one, and make a brave showing, setting the detectives on the  right track, and what do I get? A blowing up from my home circle and cold looks  from all bystanders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Tonka,&rdquo; Elaine praised her, &ldquo;you were a good  witness. I dare say Humbert Paley will try to get even with you, but you can  evade him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I can. But how can Paul Tolman walk off when the  inquest isn&rsquo;t finished and he hasn&rsquo;t fixed up the great business deal that I  listened in on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk too much, Tonka,&rdquo; Leif said; &ldquo;those things, I  feel sure, will be attended to, without your assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pooh, I&rsquo;ve lost interest in the whole thing. But  stay! Ha! my interest is reviving! Look who&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tonka left the window seat, where she had been perched,  and ran to a mirror, where she smoothed her rebellious hair, made up her  pretty, saucy little face, and finished in time to greet Fleming Stone as he  came in at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I do my part all right?&rdquo; she asked, so earnestly,  that Stone paused to smile at her, and say, &ldquo;Yes, indeed, you were perfect!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he went on to Isabel and the others, bringing up  beside Leif.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was passing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I stopped to tell you that  I shall be very glad to go on your sailing party. I find I can leave all right  by Monday, unless something very unexpected turns up. The inquest will wait  over for ten days or a fortnight, as there are some matters to be looked after  in California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right down glad, Mr. Stone, that you can be in our  crowd,&rdquo; Leif said, genially. &ldquo;And, of course, if it is absolutely necessary for  you to come back here on some sudden emergency, why, we won&rsquo;t be so very far  away, and you can scurry back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we shall all be glad to have you,&rdquo; Isabel added, with  one of her brightest smiles.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t help seeing the quick glance of surprise as  Stone noted her blemished face. On the left side, the malady had increased.  There were splotches of red on the fair white skin, and tiny ulcers showed here  and there.</p>
<p>He pretended to ignore them, but his startled glance had registered  and Isabel turned redder yet from embarrassment and chagrin.</p>
<p>Tonka picked up the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness all that poison ivy trouble will be gone  in another day or two,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a bad case, but it&rsquo;s nearly well  now. Gorgeous to have you go with us, Mr. Stone. I hope you like a life on the  ocean wave, for sometimes it waves a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good sailor,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;And I want a rest. You&rsquo;re  not strenuous game-players, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only those that want to be. We have quite a large party,  so there will be plenty of live wires and plenty of lotus-eaters. You&rsquo;ll leave  your murder-work behind, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; replied the detective enthusiastically,  though he was far from sure that he was speaking the truth.</p>
<p>As, indeed, he most certainly was not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that coroner is a funny man,&rdquo; Fleda Garrison  said; &ldquo;he looks as if he didn&rsquo;t know anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he does,&rdquo; Stone informed her. &ldquo;There are coroners,  I&rsquo;ve had experience with them, who await orders, and then do just as their  superiors tell them. And there are coroners who run their business to suit  themselves. Coles is that sort. He&rsquo;s a shrewd chap, and he sees farther into  the truth than he seems to, but after all, it&rsquo;s a baffling case. If it&rsquo;s merely  the physical effect of the accumulated poison from the peach kernels, there&rsquo;s  no case at all. If it&rsquo;s accidental, by which I mean, if one pit had an  extraordinary amount of poison in it, there&rsquo;s also no case. If it&rsquo;s a suicide,  there&rsquo;s no case. But so long as there&rsquo;s a chance of its being murder, we must  proceed with our investigations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband says,&rdquo; Fleda went on, &ldquo;that Doctor Coles is  very easily influenced by other people&rsquo;s advice. He thinks the inquest should  not have been adjourned, and that it was owing to Paul Tolman that it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Garrison,&rdquo; Stone said, in his straightforward way,  &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d advise your husband against making such sweeping statements. Mr. Paul  Tolman certainly did want the inquest adjourned, for he wants to go back to California for the  funeral. But the adjournment would have been made anyway, as the coroner has  some further data to find and some definite investigation to be made. As I say,  Coles is a capable man, and he is conducting his inquiry with what I consider  admirable judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; Fleda fluttered, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to seem  critical. Nor Jim either. He&rsquo;s a wise man, and knows a lot about law and all  that, but he isn&rsquo;t a criminal lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone smiled at her pleasantly, and went on;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to being influenced by outside advice, I find Doctor  Coles has a strong will of his own, and does as he sees fit, irrespective of  criticism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that life!&rdquo; and Fleda giggled. &ldquo;You go and get a  notion in your head, and along comes somebody and tells you you&rsquo;re all wrong! I  think you&rsquo;re wonderful, Mr. Stone, to see through people the way you do. But do  tell me this, won&rsquo;t you? Did Peter Tolman leave a will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None has been found as yet, Mrs. Garrison. But of course  it may turn up. Our ignorance of such matters is a principal reason for  adjourning the inquest. Mr. Tolman&rsquo;s papers and documents have been given over  to his brother, who will report on them at his convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. Are you engaged on this case, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone gave her a comical glance, as he replied;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My services have been asked for, but I have not yet  entirely decided on my answer. When I do, I shall be happy to advise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not often Fleming Stone let himself use a touch of  sarcasm, but impertinent curiosity irritated him.</p>
<p>Fleda, however, was impervious to the snub, and went on  gaily;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you&rsquo;re going with us on the yacht trip, we  can follow your marvelous mental processes, and as I have a knack that way, I  may be able to help you in solving the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Garrison,&rdquo; Stone said, politely, if curtly,  and then he turned to Isabel.</p>
<p>Whereupon Fleda diverted her attentions to Elaine. &ldquo;Funny,  wasn&rsquo;t it, Elaine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;about that servant seeing you walking in the  wood with Pete Tolman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t see me,&rdquo; Elaine said, calmly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a  gossippy mood today, Fleda, and I think you&rsquo;d better be careful. If any of us  choose to tell of these things you&rsquo;re saying, you might be checked up for  slander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean? That maid, Norah, said she saw  you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Elaine spoke more decidedly. &ldquo;She was  mistaken. She may have seen somebody, walking in the wood with Peter Tolman,  but it was not I. Please don&rsquo;t run that line in your daily gossip. Of course,  it&rsquo;s only my word against hers, you can take your choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a ninny, Fleda,&rdquo; Leif took up the cudgels. &ldquo;If  you&rsquo;re going to take the word of an Inn  chambermaid against our Elaine, you can&rsquo;t go on our yacht party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing like that,&rdquo; and Fleda leaned over and took  Elaine&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who walked in the wood with Pete Tolman. Do you  know I rather liked that man. He had his good points, hadn&rsquo;t he, Elaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;&rdquo; Elaine assented; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going home now. Want to  walk along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I must go, too,&rdquo; and Fleda rose.</p>
<p>She crossed the room, and laid her hand on the arm of  Fleming Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a second,&rdquo; she said, smiling at him, and urging him  over to a window, where they were a little apart from the others. &ldquo;Mr. Stone,  you must listen to me, for your own good. I am&mdash;well, not exactly clairvoyant,  you know&mdash;but I have a sort of second sight, that enables me to tell a wrongdoer  when I see one. A murderer or a lesser criminal, they can&rsquo;t deceive me. It&rsquo;s a  gift I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her bright brown eyes looked into Stone&rsquo;s, and he marveled  what sort of foolishness she was going to get off now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a convenient gift,&rdquo; he said, disinterestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is. And it&rsquo;s always true. I&rsquo;m telling you, so if  you think you&rsquo;ve found Pete Tolman&rsquo;s murderer, you tell me and I&rsquo;ll prove your  suspicions right or not. When we&rsquo;re on the yacht, I mean. You&rsquo;ll be thinking it  over of course, and you can confide in me and I&rsquo;ll be good help. See?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleda looked very pretty and very helpful as she gazed  into Stone&rsquo;s deep and somewhat bored-looking eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Garrison,&rdquo; he said, with a vague  intonation. &ldquo;I may be glad to remind you of your offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Fleda and Elaine went away, and Jewett went with  them, leaving Stone with the Murray  family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman with a tongue like Fleda Garrison&rsquo;s can do a lot  of harm,&rdquo; Leif said, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Stone, &ldquo;but, too, she often may give out a  bit of help. I don&rsquo;t yearn to hear specimens of her clairvoyance, but if she  has any facts, I might be interested. Have you known of her second sight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Fleda means real clairvoyance,&rdquo; Isabel  said, &ldquo;but she has great intuition, and sometimes sees into a person&rsquo;s  character amazingly well. And she is especially sensitive to falsehood or  treachery. She can spot a lack of sincerity with astonishing correctness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a gift,&rdquo; Stone said; &ldquo;not many people have it, but  when it&rsquo;s the real thing it&rsquo;s pretty fine. I foresee a caucus of would-be  detective spirits on our voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t bother you,&rdquo; Isabel said, anxiously.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard to make guests behave on shipboard. Maybe they&rsquo;ll make your life  miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; and Stone smiled. &ldquo;If they get too  intrusive, I can pitch them overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d pitch Fleda Garrison first,&rdquo; Leif told him.  &ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of the few women I can&rsquo;t abide. We have to invite her because her  husband is an old friend of mine, who would break his heart at being left out  of our yacht trips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fleda&rsquo;s all right most of the time,&rdquo; Isabel declared.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only when she gets curious about something that is none of her business,  that she makes herself a nuisance. But when we get away by ourselves on the  rolling deep, I hope we&rsquo;ll all forget things like inquests and coroners and  peach pits&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Tolmans,&rdquo; added Tonka. &ldquo;Oh, bless my soul, Isabel,  who do you think is coming now? She&rsquo;s getting out of a taxicab, and it&rsquo;s&mdash;Aunt  Phoebe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tonka was in the window seat, as usual, and so could see  the approach of visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A family guest?&rdquo; asked Stone. &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;d better be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute and see her,&rdquo; invited Isabel. &ldquo;You never  saw a more amusing person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Stone waited to meet the newcomer.</p>
<p>An elderly lady, with mid-Victorian appointments stepped  mincingly into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How-do, Leif,&rdquo; she called out, as he went forward to  greet her. &ldquo;And Izzy, dear, how are you? Why, my child, my child, whatever ails  you? You ought to be in a leper&rsquo;s colony!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Aunt Phoebe,&rdquo; and Leif scowled at her. &ldquo;How dare  you speak to Isabel like that? She has a bad case of sunburn, but we don&rsquo;t  speak like that about it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunburn my eye!&rdquo; cried the old lady. &ldquo;Looks to me more  like pellagra or anthrax or those fearful&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop your noise, Aunt Phoebe!&rdquo; Tonka cried out. &ldquo;I am  surprised at your rudeness. Have you come to stay?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the visitor, turning from Isabel to the others.  &ldquo;I am motoring through this section, and stopped in for a minute to see my nephew.  Who is this strange gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Stone, Aunt,&rdquo; and Leif made introduction. &ldquo;Mrs. Bingham,  Mr. Stone. My aunt from Quebec.  Not staying over night, Aunt Phoebe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Leif. In fact, I just dropped in for a few moments.  My friends with whom I am motoring, stopped at the Inn,  for dinner, and I came on here. I shall rejoin them and continue our trip. I am  glad to meet you, Mr. Stone. I suppose you are the Mr. Stone who finds out  things. I&rsquo;ve interested myself a great deal in detective work, and I&rsquo;d like a  chance to talk it over with you. But not now, no, don&rsquo;t insist; I can&rsquo;t take  time for it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone had no intention of insisting, but he said politely,  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; and then excusing himself he rose to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; the old lady said, giving him what seemed  a wicked wink, &ldquo;if you knew of the secret between myself and my nephew, you  would be interested, I do assure you. But we cannot tell it to you, we are  bound to inviolate secrecy. Yes, sir, inviolate is the word! And don&rsquo;t you try  to get it out of Leif, he won&rsquo;t tell you! Indeed, why should he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Aunt Phoebe, you mustn&rsquo;t detain Mr. Stone. He&rsquo;s  a very busy man. Good-by, Stone, come round again. I have some business to  transact with Mrs. Bingham, and her time is short. Come with me. Aunt Phoebe,  into my study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two went away, and Fleming Stone turned to Isabel.</p>
<p>He saw she was quivering with excitement of some sort,  which had the appearance of fright, but she could not feel fear of a harmless  old lady of good address and evident refinement.</p>
<p>For though erratic and blunt mannered, Mrs. Bingham was a  gentlewoman.</p>
<p>Tonka, however, was choking with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a character, Mr. Stone. Leif&rsquo;s old aunt, and  what they know, in secret, is some dire and devilish enterprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Tonka,&rdquo; Isabel contradicted; &ldquo;not that. It is a  secret, yes, but of course, it is nothing wrong. Forget it, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course, Mrs. Murray. She is a delightful piece of  property, and I am not at all curious. If her secret ever becomes public property,  let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could tell you now&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, of course not. Keep faith, always. Good-by, look  after your sunburn. Good-by, Tonka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Fleming Stone went away. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Our Saucy Ship&rsquo;s A Beauty</b></h2>
<p>IT WAS Monday morning, and a finer day to start on a  yachting trip never dawned on this old earth of ours.</p>
<p>The Terpsichore, a houseboat of very modern type and with  luxurious appointments, waited in readiness at the docks of the Viking Yacht  Club, a small and select club of yacht owners.</p>
<p>The start was set for noon, and the guests were already  assembled at the Clubhouse, though their hosts had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>They were delayed because of Isabel&rsquo;s illness.</p>
<p>She had wakened with a severe headache and after a slight  convulsion had lapsed into a semi-stuporous condition that made her limp and  uncertain of motion.</p>
<p>But she insisted that she would go on the trip.</p>
<p>Leif was determined to cancel the invitations and call the  trip off, but she would not hear of it.</p>
<p>Tonka, always sensible, had called Doctor Craddock and he  was now with the invalid, deciding what she should do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look at it this way,&rdquo; he said, as Jenny stood by,  holding Isabel&rsquo;s hat and coat in readiness, &ldquo;if Mrs. Murray stays at home from  this trip she will worry herself into a fever and become really ill. If she  goes along it may well be that the sea air and the pleasant company will so  chirk her up, that she will begin at once to improve. Don&rsquo;t let her sit in the  sun, but keep her in the open air, and guard her from all care or anxiety.  You&rsquo;ll do your part, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the doctor looked at Isabel, hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything if you&rsquo;ll let me go. If  you keep me at home, and the rest go, I&rsquo;ll have a tantrum right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look that came over her marred face proved the truth  of her threat. The left cheek and left temple were in a state of mild eruption,  which showed plainly through the film of powder Jenny had artfully applied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Craddock went on, &ldquo;if Mrs. Murray improves, all  will be well, but if she doesn&rsquo;t and you think better to have further advice,  you can stop off somewhere, can&rsquo;t you, and see a doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truth was Doctor Craddock was at his wits&rsquo; end. Unless  this was a most exaggerated case of sunburn, he did not know what it was. He  had no desire to admit this, and he was secretly glad to have this troublesome  patient go away, and if necessary, pass the responsibility to someone else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her maid, Jenny, will go with her, I suppose,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Tonka answered him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a large party, and we&rsquo;re  not taking Jenny. I can look after Isabel, and I&rsquo;ll take better care of her  than anyone else could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, my dear. I will give you a list of directions  which you must follow carefully, and I think there will be no cause for  anxiety. Indeed, Mrs. Murray is bracing up already just at the idea of going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Isabel did look more like herself as she braced up to  the occasion, and asked Jenny to bring her things.</p>
<p>In a swagger yachting costume, Isabel donned her smart hat  and coat, and smiled as she announced herself ready.</p>
<p>Leif, greatly bucked up by her sudden improvement, led her  out to the car which was to take them to the Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly grand that you&rsquo;re so much better, darling,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;now, remember you&rsquo;re not to make any exertion, just relax and take it  easy on board. Don&rsquo;t even try to entertain people, I will look after that, with  Tonka&rsquo;s help and Elaine&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you let Elaine do any hostess act,&rdquo; and Isabel  looked annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, Starlight! You are Queen of the Terpsichore  and no one else has a look-in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Clubhouse, they found the waiting crowd, and it was  but a short time before they were really afloat, in high spirits and happy  mood.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone was with them, having telephoned at the last  minute that he found he could surely come.</p>
<p>Isabel was quite like her own merry self, and as a tray of  cocktails soon made its appearance, one of those added to her well-being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you could make it, Stone,&rdquo; Leif greeted his distinguished  guest. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s looking after the Tolman case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; returned the detective. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t always have to  appear in person, you see, and I plan to keep in touch with all interested  parties. You won&rsquo;t mind if I spend more or less time in the seclusion which my  cabin grants. I <i>am</i> working on the  case, you know, but I&rsquo;m always at your disposal in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I understand, and your time is entirely your  own. But I don&rsquo;t believe you mean to be mysterious and you mustn&rsquo;t mind if I  ask you how you can work on a case far away from the scene and the personnel  and the possible developments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a detective&rsquo;s life has a lot more work in it than  absolute material investigation. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it sometime, and then  you&rsquo;ll understand the mechanism. But I don&rsquo;t want to talk shop in this good  company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company scattered, as a steward appeared to show them  to their staterooms, and Fleming Stone was much pleased to find himself in a  large, light cabin, with ample room for the books and papers he had found it  necessary to bring with him.</p>
<p>For the detective was not on board merely to enjoy a  pleasure trip. Experience had taught him how to combine his pleasure with his  work, and it was seldom that he went anywhere entirely for a vacation.</p>
<p>A valet came and offered his services and Stone told him  at once and concisely just what he wanted from him, and when to make his  appearances.</p>
<p>Always friendly of manner, Stone gave the man a  substantial <i>douceur</i> and felt sure  that happen what might he had an ally on board.</p>
<p>Not that he expected anything untoward to happen, but he  lived in a state of preparedness for anything that might turn up.</p>
<p>A bugle call announced luncheon and it proved to be a  hilarious meal.</p>
<p>Isabel, who was feeling fine, was a charming hostess, and  though the eruptive inflammation on the left side of her face was painfully  evident, it was so skillfully ignored by all that she almost forgot it herself.</p>
<p>Leif sat next to his wife, having bid Giles Trumbull to  sit at the foot of the table.</p>
<p>Trumbull, a host in himself, obeyed understandingly, and  so left Murray  free to look after his wife.</p>
<p>And it was as well, for when Isabel rose to leave the  table, saying they would have coffee on deck, she stumbled and would have  fallen but for Leif&rsquo;s quick grasp of her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look after the coffee, Tonka,&rdquo; Leif said, as he led  Isabel away to her stateroom.</p>
<p>So Tonka did the honors, and William, the chief steward  passed the cups round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor darling,&rdquo; Tonka said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s always like that the  first day out. She&rsquo;ll be all right by tomorrow, and maybe by tonight. We&rsquo;ll let  her alone and play by ourselves this afternoon. Anybody who wants deck games  and things like that, just tell William and he&rsquo;ll set &rsquo;em up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to loaf,&rdquo; Elaine declared. &ldquo;I like that  place aft, all full of hammocks and big pillows and things. I&rsquo;ve a book to  read, but if anybody interrupts my reading, I shan&rsquo;t mind a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s an invitation I like,&rdquo; said Leo Jewett.  &ldquo;Expect an early interruption, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coffee over, the two Garrisons drifted around to where  Fleming Stone was sitting beside Tonka.</p>
<p>The all-seeing William pushed up deck chairs and Fleda  began her interminable babble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so delightful to have you along, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; she  said; &ldquo;my husband is eager to talk with you. He has heard so much about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Mrs. Garrison,&rdquo; Stone parried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a  film queen. I disclaim all this popularity you credit me with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naughty man!&rdquo; and Fleda shook a girlish forefinger at  him. &ldquo;You must accept your celebrity, you can&rsquo;t disguise it. Now, we want to  know, Jim and I do, just what you think of the Tolman affair and just what  you&rsquo;re going to do about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone told them. He did not speak impromptu, he had  arranged his speech for this very occasion, and he was prepared to use it. He had  hesitated a moment, lest Jim Garrison might not be the impertinent sort his  wife was; but he concluded the man was quite as intrusive and inquisitive as  was his better half. So he let them have it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an abstruse question,&rdquo; he began with a look of profound  seriousness, &ldquo;but I know you will understand me when I tell you the ethical  side of the case. Ethical? Nay, I may say psychological. For if ever a case  showed need for a psycho-physicist&rsquo;s reasoning, surely we have it here. An  apperception almost clairvoyant is distinctly called for, and I remember with  great pleasure, Mrs. Garrison, your modest admission of your own ability in  that direction. Your familiarity then, with ideology, indeed, with no&ouml;scopics,  will readily suggest to you that this case can be treated only by  psycho-analysis. Do you not agree with me? But of course you do. And you will  not be surprised that I ask you, even before we begin our discussion, to set  forth your own excogitations, so that I can intelligently supplement and complement  them with my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once in her voluble, garrulous life Fleda Garrison was  at a loss for words. She could have followed Stone&rsquo;s words had he spoken more  slowly, or had they been written words which she could read and digest.</p>
<p>But he rattled it off so quickly, and Fleda&rsquo;s erudition  was really so superficial that she didn&rsquo;t half sense his speech. This made her  embarrassed and she floundered sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite&mdash;quite agree with you, Mr. Stone. But&mdash;but I think,  as you are the discoverer of these grave issues connected with the Tolman case,  I think it would be fairer to me for you to tell me first, your own outlook on  the subject and your own plan of procedure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly, Mrs. Garrison, willingly. Now, at what point  do you want me to begin? We must view it in unison, you know, and if you will  tell me the&mdash;let us say, the mental chiaroscuro you wish to utilize, we can get  a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleda was helpless. So also was Jim Garrison.</p>
<p>The man had a dim idea that Stone was spoofing them, but  Fleda had no such suspicion and she was merely terrified.</p>
<p>Always she could impress people by her pseudo erudition,  and now, to fall down at the very time she most wanted to shine was  heart-rending.</p>
<p>Anxious to help his wife, Jim said, boldly; &ldquo;I think Mrs. Garrison  doesn&rsquo;t quite understand you. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I do, Jim! Of course I understand Mr. Stone. I&rsquo;m  thinking though, that I must give this thing a little more thought before I can  formulate my decisions. Suppose we let the matter wait over until tomorrow, Mr.  Stone, and then take it up afresh in the morning. After such a luxuriant  luncheon as I fear I ate, I cannot feel my brain is at its best. But I assure  you when it is at its best it&rsquo;s a swift-working little engine, isn&rsquo;t it, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, honey, it is that! All right, Mr. Stone,  let&rsquo;s adjourn this meeting not <i>sine die</i>,  but until tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine idea and I fully agree. And as I too want to give  the subject a bit more thought, I&rsquo;ll go to my desk for a while. See you at tea  time, Mrs. Garrison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went away, half chuckling at the rise he had taken and  half ashamed of himself for doing so.</p>
<p>Tea time, of course, was merely a euphemism for the  cocktail hour, and the party collected themselves on the after deck for the  occasion.</p>
<p>The women had donned frilly frocks and Isabel, in a  trailing gown of shadowy blue, made a brave effort to play the happy hostess.  And succeeded too. Always willing to sacrifice herself for others, she overcame  her weariness and ignored the shooting pains that now and then attacked her in  the back of the neck, and grew more and more painful.</p>
<p>Only Leif realized to the full what she was suffering, and  he sat beside her, answering questions for her and parrying jests about her  alleged <i>mal de mer</i>, an ailment she  had never experienced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Fleda asked, as she lounged prettily  in a deck chair, her filmy gown of reddish brown crepe just matching her wavy  auburn hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just playin&rsquo; around,&rdquo; Leif told her. &ldquo;We have no sailing  orders as yet, but any may be offered from you all. As an objective point I had  in mind Atlantic City,  but if it doesn&rsquo;t appeal, our good natured Captain Pike will turn into any  other lane. Have you any choice, Fleda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, I&rsquo;m perfectly happy just drifting. What does  it matter where we go? I love Atlantic    City. It&rsquo;s so delightfully rakish, in a cheap way. Oh,  I don&rsquo;t mean inexpensive, you can spend lots of money at A. C. But its  atmosphere is cheap. That&rsquo;s what makes it so amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you mean, Fleda,&rdquo; Elaine told her, &ldquo;is that Atlantic City is not  distinctly highbrow. I like that about it. Ingleside Heights  is so stuffed with culture, you can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rsquo; if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should never want to commit such a solecism,&rdquo; Fleda  returned, in a tone of utter disdain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you commit solecisms, dear. I think you are  guilty of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleda turned red, and Antony Ballard helped out. &ldquo;Now,  now, girls, no grammar lessons while we&rsquo;re on holiday. On this yacht we can all  be guilty of whatever we choose and commit anything we are craving to commit.  Hey, Leif?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. The ship is yours from stem to stern. I&rsquo;m  having the time of my life. Nothing gives me such ideal happiness as to be off  in this craft with a few congenial spirits and fair weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it life!&rdquo; breathed Fleda, in a tense voice and with  her fat little hands clasped to her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ideal,&rdquo; agreed Tonka. &ldquo;And now I&rsquo;m going to walk a  thousand times around the deck for the sake of my svelte lines. Who&rsquo;ll walk  with me? You, Antony  Ballard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honored,&rdquo; said the always amenable man. &ldquo;Come right  along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two started off to walk at a brisk pace, which soon  settled down to a more leisurely stroll, and Tonka looked up at the big man  towering above her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down here,&rdquo; she directed, as they reached a  bench far from the merry group. &ldquo;Now, tell me, Antony B., what do you think  ails Isabel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, Tonka, I don&rsquo;t know! Hasn&rsquo;t she had the doctor?  Doesn&rsquo;t he say sunburn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunburn, your grandmother! It&rsquo;s something more than that.  But if you don&rsquo;t know, you don&rsquo;t. I had an idea you were the medicinal sort.  Who is? On board, I mean. Leif won&rsquo;t worry about it at all&mdash;I can&rsquo;t make him.  Elaine won&rsquo;t, either. But I am worried, and I know Isabel is. I&rsquo;ve talked to  Giles, and he appreciates the seriousness of it, but he says if it were anything  dangerous, Doctor Craddock wouldn&rsquo;t have let Isabel come. I am appealing to  you, because I think you are wise and you know things. Can&rsquo;t you see, without  being a doctor, that Isabel is really ill? She tries to hide it, but she is  getting worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do understand, Tonka, and I do see the possibility of  her becoming worse, but there is also the chance that a day or two at sea will  brace her up and make her really well again. Shan&rsquo;t we try it? You don&rsquo;t mean  you want to turn round and go home, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I want.&rdquo; The girl looked pitifully  helpless, and the big-hearted man felt very sorry for her. But Ballard was a  bachelor, and knew little of feminine nature, which, he had been led to believe  was, in a general way, querulous, pettish and complaining. Women were not like  that, when they were with him;, but he had a notion they were so, at home.</p>
<p>He was not a woman-hater, by any means, but he could  easily find happiness in life with his books and his dogs and his occasional  journeys to distant countries.</p>
<p>But he was a born comforter, and he had always liked  Tonka, she was so different from the average girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, you know,&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;you are worrying  unnecessarily about Isabel. I&rsquo;ve been in tropic countries and I&rsquo;ve seen deep  sunburn that nearly ate the life out of a man. Isabel overdid her foolish  sunbaths, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a case of &lsquo;remove the cause and the effect will  cease.&rsquo; At any rate, Tonka, girl, let&rsquo;s try it. Give Isa a couple more days and  nights to get over it, and see if she isn&rsquo;t well on the mend by that time. If  not&mdash;well, if not, I&rsquo;d advise stopping off somewhere and seeing a doctor. There  are lots of stopping places down along the Jersey  coast, we can hug the shore, and if it seems wise, we can land and see about  the matter. Hey, girl, that all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;yes, I suppose so. Nobody agrees with me as to Isabel&rsquo;s  condition. Giles Trumbull just laughs and says she&rsquo;ll be all right in a day or  two. Leif says the same and now you. I suppose I&rsquo;m silly, but&mdash;well, here&rsquo;s  another thing. Now, don&rsquo;t laugh, but her hair is coming out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Tonka, I won&rsquo;t laugh, but you mustn&rsquo;t be utterly  foolish. I&rsquo;ve been told that when hair is falling out, the sun rays on it are  most beneficial. I don&rsquo;t know much about these matters, but I don&rsquo;t believe  sunburn makes your hair fall out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t likely. But here&rsquo;s the point, Antony. If Isabel&rsquo;s pretty  hair came out just a little, I wouldn&rsquo;t think much about it. But it&rsquo;s shocking,  the way it is gone from the left side of her head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t noticed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor anyone else. Of course any woman could cover up a  defect like that from ordinary observers. Isabel&rsquo;s golden curls are so lovely,  and she has so much hair, that she can draw it over to cover up the bald places  and she ties a ribbon in to keep it so. As I say, a little thinning wouldn&rsquo;t  show, but when it comes out in patches, I can&rsquo;t help wondering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Part of the burning, I should say. But you do as I said,  Tonka; wait a couple of days longer, then if matters get worse, I&rsquo;ll talk to  Leif about it. What does Isabel think, herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make her out. Sometimes she flouts it all, and  says she&rsquo;s perfectly well and there&rsquo;s nothing the matter with her. Then again,  she&rsquo;ll burst out crying and say she&rsquo;s going to die, and nothing can help her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious, no! Of course not. She&rsquo;s a great woman,  Isabel is, much more fine and splendid than most people give her credit for.  Sometimes I think Leif doesn&rsquo;t fully appreciate her wonderful nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think that too,&rdquo; and Ballard smiled a little.  &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re talking straight goods, Tonka, I&rsquo;ll say, she sometimes shows Leif a  side of her nature not quite so wonderful as you&rsquo;re making her out. She&rsquo;s quick  with her tongue, you know, and her tongue at times is sharp. Leif has never  said a word to me, but I&rsquo;ve heard her go out of her way to give him a mean slap  sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to that from anyone else,&rdquo; and Tonka  looked at the man with grave reproof. &ldquo;But I have to admit, that you&rsquo;re right  in part, and I&rsquo;ve heard Isabel say pretty hard things to Leif without any real  reason for it. I adore Isabel, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I think she is perfect.  Anyway I&rsquo;ll do as you advise about her illness. You&rsquo;re a real comfort, Antony. What do you think  of our famous guest, the detective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like him, don&rsquo;t you? No swank about him, no  mystery-monging, no scorn of others&rsquo; opinions. I wish he&rsquo;d talk shop more, but  he doesn&rsquo;t like to do that. Seems queer, though, why he came off on this  pleasure trip, when he&rsquo;s engaged on that Tolman case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he engaged on it? By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I supposed by the brother of Tolman. I&rsquo;ve  lost interest since we&rsquo;ve come away. Up home, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to hear the  latest news, but away here by ourselves, I don&rsquo;t care to hear the news at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either. I never listen in on the radio. But if  anything turns up in the Tolman case, we&rsquo;d know of it, wouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we get all the radio news. Come on, girl, let&rsquo;s  play a game of skittles before dinner time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go you,&rdquo; Tonka said, but just then Fleda came along  with Leo Jewett, and they stopped to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to see Isabel,&rdquo; Fleda said; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dancing!&rdquo; exclaimed Tonka, &ldquo;she mustn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why ever not?&rdquo; asked Fleda in surprise. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in fine  shape, and feels so well. Why can&rsquo;t she dance, I&rsquo;d like to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, its probably all right,&rdquo; Tonka answered, &ldquo;but Doctor  Craddock gave me a list of things she must not do, and dancing is one of them.  I&rsquo;m not going to disobey the doctor&rsquo;s orders. Stay here, you people, and I&rsquo;ll  go and see about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, isn&rsquo;t that life!&rdquo; Fleda exclaimed as Tonka ran off.  &ldquo;Try your best to get Isabel braced up, and more like herself, and then get  called down for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you set her dancing?&rdquo; Ballard asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. We wanted her to brace up and be herself, so I  proposed she dance with my husband and she seemed glad to do so. Tonka is  foolishly fussy about her. Isabel would be all right if Tonka would let her  alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree, Fleda,&rdquo; and Ballard looked at her  reprovingly; &ldquo;Tonka has the doctors orders and she is carrying them out. She&rsquo;s  all right, you let her alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want to harm Isabel. I  thought a little dance would do her good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And probably it has,&rdquo; Jewett put in. &ldquo;I think the best  way for any of us to help Isabel is to refrain from advising her about this or  that. I try to chirk her up, but I don&rsquo;t advise. Come along, Fleda, let&rsquo;s go  back and dance some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go, Leo. I&rsquo;ll stay and talk with Antony for a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dismissal was so definite, Jewett gave a grimace and  walked off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice boy, Leo,&rdquo; Fleda said, &ldquo;but a little of him goes a  long way. See here, Antony,  you don&rsquo;t think Isabel is so awful sick, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Fleda, how do I know? Everybody is asking me  about Isabel&rsquo;s health or lack of health, as if I were a blooming specialist in  skin troubles. I don&rsquo;t know anything about eczema or athlete&rsquo;s cheek or  whatever she&rsquo;s got, but I admit it looks pretty bad to me. I talked easy to  Tonka, poor child. She&rsquo;s all bothered about it. But I told her to wait a few  days and see how Isa gets along. And I think that&rsquo;s the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, Antony.  I think she&rsquo;ll get well herself if we all let her alone. Come along and have a  dance with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They danced, thoughtlessly enough, the while an insidious  foe was slowly gaining in a war against Isabel Murray&rsquo;s well-being. Slowly  undermining her health, her strength, her very life.</p>
<p>Small need to wonder if she were ill, she was indeed ill,  and getting worse every moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  Fleming Stone Goes Skylarking</b></h2>
<p>UNTIL the occasion of Peter Tolman&rsquo;s death, the police  headquarters of Ingleside   Heights had been such in  name only. The headquarters were there, two rooms in the Town Hall building,  air-conditioned and well conditioned otherwise, correctly and almost  attractively appointed, and kept spotlessly clean by two alternating Swedish  scrubwomen.</p>
<p>Furnished with all necessary fittings, the place was  unused because of the utter absence of criminals or crimes to be investigated.</p>
<p>And now the time had come. The place justified itself, its  name was no longer a misnomer, for it housed the papers and documents of the  Tolman case, and several officials bustled in in the morning and bustled out  again in the afternoon, putting in, except for a couple of luncheon hours, a  busy day.</p>
<p>That Monday afternoon, just at the moment Fleming Stone,  on the yacht Terpsichore, was ragging Fleda Garrison about psycho-analysis, the  county coroner and the police detective were in confab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; Coles said, &ldquo;a very queer thing for Mr. Stone  to take on the Tolman case, to engage himself to Paul Tolman, and then to go  off skylarking on a yacht trip with a gay crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; Lieutenant Browning returned; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had  dealings with Fleming Stone before and I never knew him to do anything but what  he had good reason for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the reason he&rsquo;s got is that he wants to have a good  time and he couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation. That&rsquo;s a mighty fine craft of Leif  Murray&rsquo;s and they have high old times on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Houseboat, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s what they call it, but it isn&rsquo;t much like  what we use to mean by houseboat. I went in one once and it was like a bungalow  set on a scow. But this is a regular high-flyer yacht, with a beautiful house  on it, well it&rsquo;s more like a great big cabin and it looks all shipshape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve seen them, they&rsquo;re grand. Well&rsquo;s I say, I&rsquo;ll  bet F. Stone knows what he&rsquo;s about and he&rsquo;ll stay about it till he gets it  done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by then it&rsquo;ll be too late to do any further  investigating up here. How long is that trip going to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell me. Just said to carry on till he came  back. If you want to pick up that inquest where you dropped it, you don&rsquo;t have  to wait for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I don&rsquo;t. But truth to tell, I kinda depend on him  for advice and things. He&rsquo;s a wise one, he is; and good-natured, too. And,  anyway, I haven&rsquo;t any new evidence and I don&rsquo;t see any way to get any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there, Coles. Ain&rsquo;t I the police detective, and  ain&rsquo;t it my business to hike up evidence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t got any, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say as I have and I don&rsquo;t say <i>but</i> I have. I expect to talk with Mr. Stone  tonight, and if there&rsquo;s anything you want me to ask him, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, talk to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to call me on the telephone at ten o&rsquo;clock  this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will he be then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to step off the ship at Long Branch, and give me a call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you s&rsquo;pose? To see if I have any news about  Tolman matters. Wish I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Browning, can&rsquo;t I talk to him? You&rsquo;ve nothing to  tell him, turn him over to me for ten minutes, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;ll he like that? He didn&rsquo;t tell me to do anything of  that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have something to tell him, and he&rsquo;ll be glad to  know of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, you give me your message, and I&rsquo;ll pass it  along. I don&rsquo;t want to do what I ain&rsquo;t told to do, see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see, and I want to talk to him myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, I&rsquo;ll do this. After I have my confab  with him, I&rsquo;ll ask him if he&rsquo;ll talk with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t put it that way; tell him I want to talk to him  and ask him if I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll do that. And you try to persuade him to  come back here. He can leave the yacht any time, they&rsquo;re just drifting along,  stopping wherever and whenever anybody wants to. I think Atlantic City is their objective point and  then, if Mrs. Murray gets better, to go along further south. Like as not wind  up at Gibson Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the swanky places to go to. In Chesapeake   Bay, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a long way off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. It&rsquo;s all of that. Lordy, I want F. S. to come back,  too. If he wasn&rsquo;t mixed in with us, I&rsquo;d go ahead on my own. But he is a genius,  you know, and I&rsquo;d ruther tag along with him, than make a mad dash myself, and  maybe find it all wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Browning; I&rsquo;ll be here tonight at ten, and I  hope to goodness, we can get some satisfaction out of our disappearing  detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? Has the rolling Stone rolled away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humbert Paley walked into the room, and seated himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Browning answered him, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone on a cruise with  the Murrays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he was retained by Pete Tolman&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is. He proposes to work at long distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to combine work and play, then,&rdquo; complained  Coroner Coles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so keen on him,&rdquo; Paley declared; &ldquo;does Paul  Tolman know he&rsquo;s deserted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; Browning said; &ldquo;Mr. Stone hasn&rsquo;t deserted. He  went on the trip for reasons of his own, and they were in some way connected  with the work he&rsquo;s doing for Paul Tolman. Don&rsquo;t you get any notion that Fleming  Stone is anything less than the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sez you and who else?&rdquo; Paley got up to go. &ldquo;No use my  staying here, nobody knows anymore about things than I do.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Coles gave the speaker a peculiar glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thought has passed through my mind, Paley,&rdquo; he said,  and his voice held no tone of banter. &ldquo;Suppose you tell us some of the things  you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out there, Doctor Coles; are you making what the  poet calls a veiled hint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it seems veiled, I&rsquo;ll make it more distinct. Can  you tell me anything from your store of knowledge that would remove these vague  fears that haunt me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what nature are your vague&mdash;er, suspicions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspicions being your word, not mine. Perhaps they&rsquo;re  hallucinations, but I seem to imagine you as somewhat deeply mixed up in this  Tolman passing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning Pete&rsquo;s death? I hate that term, passing&mdash; always  sounds like a spiritualistic seance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never attended one of those, though I&rsquo;ve heard of them.  All right, can you convince me that you had nothing to do with the causes that  brought about Peter Tolman&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve made up your mind, and you seem to have done  so, that I killed Tolman or assisted at his killing, I doubt if anything I can  say will convince you to the contrary. I do say, though, that I did not have  anything to do with the poisoned gumdrop&mdash;I mean the poisoned peach kernel,  which undoubtedly killed the poor chap. And I believe that&rsquo;s what happened. I  do not believe the poison stuff in the peach pits killed him. Nor do I want to  discuss that question here and now. But I do ask you, Coroner Coles, if you  suspect me of murder, as your speech and attitude lead me to suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspect is too strong a word, at the present stage of  investigation, Mr. Paley. Also, this conversation is not at all official, you  needn&rsquo;t carry on, unless you choose. But sometimes a little talk clears the  atmosphere and proves helpful. I wish you would tell me if the story told by  Miss Mead was true in the main.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the main, yes. Pete Tolman and I were inventing a  helpful adjunct to a radio instrument. It is practically complete, and about to  be patented, and we were settling up the final details of our personal contract  before taking out our patent. As is not an isolated case, we disagreed as to  the division of the proceeds. We had talked over this matter several times, and  we hoped that day to come to a final conclusion. The conversation was private  but not secret. If anyone had overheard us, we might have been annoyed, but not  angry. Some jesting remarks we passed seemed to that Tonka girl to be threats  of rather a serious nature. There was nothing of that sort. Tolman and I were  very old friends. We had worked before on mechanical inventions, but we had  never previously brought any of our work so near to perfection. If you look at  the matter fairly, you will see at once that the last thing I desired was Pete  Tolman&rsquo;s death. Why, it throws the whole responsibility of our invention right  back on me, and I can&rsquo;t swing it all. As is the case, in most collaborations,  one does a certain part of the work, and the other does the rest. It was so  with us. We had each contributed our separate parts of the work, and as you can  readily understand, it will be difficult for me to finish up my own details and  look after Pete&rsquo;s, too. I may have to engage the services of some skilled mechanician  to see me through, but that I do not want to do. At least not until I try to do  it all myself. This may sound grasping, but I&rsquo;m sure you can see how unfair it  would be to bring in a third party to share the profits that should have gone  to Tolman. The whole matter must of course be delayed, but I&rsquo;m telling you  this, to show you how unfortunate it is for me that Peter died just now, quite  aside from the natural grief I feel at losing my good friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coles looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had experience with witnesses, Mr. Paley,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that your words carry weight with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; exclaimed Browning, heartily. &ldquo;I was a mite  suspicious, Paley, but you&rsquo;ve changed my ideas a bit. I can see how you meant  those speeches that Tonka Mead repeated with a different twang to &rsquo;em. She&rsquo;s a  queer stick, anyway, and they do say she&rsquo;s half-witted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say a base libel, then,&rdquo; and Coles looked irate.  &ldquo;Tonka Mead is an odd sort, but she has a good head and a fine intellect. She  has a queer streak in her, but she is deeply devoted to Mrs. Murray, and cares  for her with real love and affection. I think we&rsquo;d better forget her account of  the sycamore tree, and turn our efforts to tracking down the murderer of Peter  Tolman. I am not putting you out of my mind entirely, Paley, and I am frankly  telling you so. Now, knowing Tolman as you did, can you suggest anybody who  might come under suspicion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no; unless it might be some of the maids. Pete was  not above carrying on flirtations with servants and even while he was married  to Mrs. Vernon, he was none too particular in choosing his sweethearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that,&rdquo; and Coles shook his head. &ldquo;It might  well be that something of that sort led to the divorce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; agreed Browning, and then the caucus broke up and  the men went their different ways.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock, though, the two policemen were at the  tryst to wait for Fleming Stone.</p>
<p>The detective called promptly on the hour, and Lieutenant  Browning answered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any new developments?&rdquo; the detective asked. &ldquo;Nothing  definite, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; Browning told him. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the trip starting off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. Is Doctor Coles going to reopen the inquest while  I&rsquo;m away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, he isn&rsquo;t sure himself. He&rsquo;s right here, and  he wants to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Lieutenant; but wait a minute, I wish you&rsquo;d  get busy on the subject of Peter Tolman&rsquo;s will. I don&rsquo;t know that he left one,  but try every way to find out. Telegraph or telephone Paul Tolman, find out any  way you can, but be sure your information is authentic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get about it first thing in the morning. When do you  expect to return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell yet. I&rsquo;m having a delightful time, I love  sailing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum Paley has been here. He&rsquo;s sore because you went off  skylarking when you ought to be here looking after this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says I went off on a spree and neglected my  responsibilities to Paul Tolman and to the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the way he puts it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell him he has sized me up fine. He&rsquo;s just right  in his opinions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw, now, Mr. Stone, I&rsquo;m not saying we think that.  We know you better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind explaining, Browning. But I don&rsquo;t mind telling  you that to find the murderer of Peter Tolman is like hunting for a needle in a  haystack, and you know that is not an easy trick. All right, if you&rsquo;ve no more  to tell me, give me Doctor Coles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coroner took over and asked first regarding Mrs. Murray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right so far,&rdquo; Stone replied. &ldquo;I rather think  the sea air will do her good, though she is in a pretty bad way. Any news,  Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. As a matter of fact I thought I wanted to talk to you  about Mr. Paley; but he was in here today for a chat, and I think I may say  I&rsquo;ve gone over to his side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I sort of gathered from the story of the girl who  was up in the tree, that Paley was a man to be looked after. But today he was  so straightforward and convincing in what he said, that I have no slightest  suspicion of him in connection with the death of Tolman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say, that was so convincing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that they were working together on an invention, and  were about to get it patented, and that Tolman&rsquo;s presence was as necessary as  his own to put the thing over. That it upset things terribly to have Tolman go  off just now, and he feared he might not be able to swing the matter alone. He  was so frank and honest about it all, that I revised my opinion of the man.  Lots of people don&rsquo;t like him, and I had a sort of prejudice against him  myself, but I feel different since we talked it over. What&rsquo;s your opinion of  him, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a murder suspect, do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite ticket him yet, but don&rsquo;t let him get away.  I shall be back by Thursday night, I feel sure, and we may be glad to have  Paley as a material witness. Any how, Doctor, see to it that he stays in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he goes off and I don&rsquo;t know it, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that happen. Get the Inspector to arrange to  keep him covered and at the first sign of his leaving town, tell him he can&rsquo;t  go. Don&rsquo;t let him give you the slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suspect him, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that. Just put it in the proper hands and say  I said Mr. Paley must not leave Ingle   Heights before my return.  If he tells you, in his frank, convincing way that he has a most important  errand in Kamschatka, and you let him go, see that he is closely and carefully  followed by your best shadower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make it sound important, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important. Never forget that. Watch him, Doctor  Coles. Note anything he does, that seems the least bit out of the ordinary. You  won&rsquo;t regret a close attention to this advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I shall remember and carry out your  directions, Mr. Stone. I may expect you, then, by Thursday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you may expect me and I shall probably be  there, but I can&rsquo;t say positively. Yachting cruises are uncertain affairs, and  as Paley says, I am an irresponsible sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in Long    Branch, I take it. Are you staying there all night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. We&rsquo;ll go back to the yacht for the night. After  we have seen a few more of the bright lights. I&rsquo;m a gay bird, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few further amenities, Coles offered the telephone  to the Lieutenant, but he shook his head, so the coroner exchanged good nights  with the detective and then cradled the instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get that man,&rdquo; Coles said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s friendly enough,  but he certainly was a bit sarcastic about Paley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, but I think it jarred him to know Paley  looked on him as a deserter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t use that word. Who is he deserting?  He is under no obligations to the police; he is working for Paul Tolman, and he  has a right to conduct his course as he sees fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re daffy over him. I believe if he suspected you,  you&rsquo;d say he had a right to. Or me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, yes. But not me. I&rsquo;m certain of my own integrity,  but I&rsquo;m always a bit skeptical about yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t know what integrity  means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the habit of these two old friends to wrangle  jocularly, and without further discussion of the absent detective, they went to  their respective homes.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone, at his end of the line, looked satisfied with  the interview in which he had just taken part, and after sitting a few moments  in deep thought, he rose and left the building.</p>
<p>Like the traditional sailors, Stone had friends in every  port, and he went in search of a medical man he knew. Parrott was not a  practicing physician, but a consulting authority of high standing.</p>
<p>He greeted his old friend with pleasure, and though Stone  could stay but a short time, he learned what he wanted to know.</p>
<p>As to the peach pits, Parrott was of the very positive  conviction that death could not be brought about by the kernels unassisted, and  he advised Stone to look for the murderer among men of strength and brutality  rather than of subtle character. Stone had long ago come to this conclusion,  but he nodded in agreement and went on;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why men? Seems to me like a woman&rsquo;s work. Say, one of the  maids at the Inn. She would have constant  opportunities and he was forever making up to those girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; that&rsquo;s your work. But take it from me, there  was more prussic acid in the kernel that killed Tolman, than nature ever put in  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now here&rsquo;s another question. Can the rays of  the sun, as indulged in by people who are batty about sunbaths, sun soaking and  sun extravagance generally, so affect these devotees as to make them seriously  ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In two conditions, yes. One is, that some few&mdash;very few,  people have a peculiar and particular sensitivity to sunlight and to them such  an over-indulgence is certainly dangerous, and might, in very rare instances,  prove fatal. The other condition is based on the fact that our good old sun has  in it an obscure and little known poisonous ray, that plays the devil with some  people and in some circumstances. This is an acknowledged and recorded truth,  but if your doctor never heard of it, don&rsquo;t blame him too much. Lots of doctors  are entirely ignorant of it, and they are just as well off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind other doctors, Parrott, you stand for the  statement that given certain conditions the sun can poison a human being?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but the conditions are hard to come by. In fact, I  should say that I think the case would have to occur in the tropics or  equatorial regions, though that stipulation I am not prepared to swear to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not on your oath, old man, but it&rsquo;s a case I&rsquo;m  deeply interested in, and I want to learn all I can about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone then detailed the developments of Isabel&rsquo;s illness,  so far as he knew them, and Parrott listened attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too complicated,&rdquo; he said, at last. &ldquo;Impossible to  dissert on such a case without full knowledge and close observation. It might  be some tropical disease, contracted in some unknown way. It might be pellagra  or some kindred disorder. And it might be, merely and only the work of that bad  old ray in our great and glorious sun. No can say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my opinion only the Almighty. I fear any doctor who  might undertake to diagnose it would be overcome by the exuberance of his own  verbosity and would give you sound without sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say so, it&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; and Stone rose to go. He had  known Parrott many years and had often come to him for wisdom and knowledge,  and he knew if his friend had any more definite or satisfactory data to give,  it would have already been spoken.</p>
<p>Leaving the house, Stone went to the hotel, where he would  meet the crowd from the yacht.</p>
<p>Isabel had not come. She said she felt well enough for the  party, but her face was so badly ulcered on one side, and her pretty hair was  so deficient on that same side, that she laughingly declared her vanity simply  refused to let her show herself at a Night Club.</p>
<p>Tonka stayed with her, but they both insisted that Elaine  and Fleda must go. There were plenty of men, and the two women must go with  them to make a proper party.</p>
<p>Leif was for staying on board, but Isabel wouldn&rsquo;t hear of  that and shooed her husband off to play host to his guests.</p>
<p>Antony Ballard stayed behind and Trumbull wanted to, but he finally went off  with the others.</p>
<p>Ballard was an expert entertainer and he did his best to make  the time pass pleasantly.</p>
<p>He convulsed both Isabel and Tonka with some funny stories  he told; he turned on the radio, and keeping his finger on the stop, unseen, he  interpolated words of his own now and then, with ludicrous effect.</p>
<p>But he soon saw weariness overtake Isabel.</p>
<p>She nestled uneasily in her big chair, then she moaned a  little and suddenly she was in the throes of a violent and frightening  convulsion.</p>
<p>Tonka sprang toward the writhing figure, but Antony drew her back.</p>
<p>The girl understood, and just stood helplessly by until  the crisis passed and like sun shining through the clouds, Isabel smiled again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; she said, naturally. &ldquo;Did I drop asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; Antony  said, &ldquo;but you must go to sleep now. Tonka will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He carried her to her cabin and laid her on the bed. Under  the gentle ministrations of Tonka, Isabel fell into a quiet, peaceful sleep. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Devil&rsquo;s Work Going On</b></h2>
<p>NEXT morning a steward came to Fleming Stone&rsquo;s cabin and  asked if he would see Mr. Ballard for a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; Stone said, and Ballard shortly appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to say,&rdquo; the visitor began, after the cabin door was  closed on the two men, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s the devil&rsquo;s work going on in this ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think so too?&rdquo; Stone said, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve noticed things. Well, I&rsquo;m not a practiced  observer nor a shrewd reasoner, but I think there&rsquo;s something uncanny about  Isabel Murray&rsquo;s illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo; Stone&rsquo;s voice was deep and genuine,  without a trace of curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it; I don&rsquo;t know anything. And that makes me  all the more alarmed. Did you hear what happened last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, from Leif. He didn&rsquo;t take it very seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he ought to! I declare I don&rsquo;t understand that man.  I know he loves Isabel, he adores her and always has, but he is not terribly  cast down by her mysterious illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it mysterious? Anything more than sunburn to the nth power?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. But what do I know of such things? Who told  Leif about last night? Did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t, Tonka must have. There was no one else  here. Leif wouldn&rsquo;t accept a servant&rsquo;s story. I think Mrs. Murray told him  herself. I hear she&rsquo;s all right this morning. You tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it was simply that Isabel had a bad turn&mdash;a very bad  one. She had a distressing spasm, then a dreadful convulsion. I&rsquo;ve seen  epileptics, but this was more &mdash;more maniacal. Her eyes rolled almost out of  sight, and she looked, well, not only demented but demoniac, she didn&rsquo;t look  like a human being at all! Her face was so distorted with some strange emotion  or possession that I could scarce believe it was Isabel. I motioned to Tonka to  keep still and not touch her, for she was like a wild creature. Not ferocious,  I don&rsquo;t mean that, but as if possessed by an evil spirit that was tearing at  her vitals. Don&rsquo;t think me hysterical, Stone, but I want you to see her as I  did, or somewhere near it. Now, nothing will ever make me believe that the  results of a bad sunburn could have such an effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you believe, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we were in the medieval ages, I&rsquo;d believe that she was  possessed of a demon, literally. But I suppose that is out of the question, so  I&rsquo;m forced to think that by some hocus-pocus somebody is poisoning her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody on the boat, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t subscribe to that.&rdquo; Ballard looked as if at his  wits&rsquo; end. &ldquo;Everybody on board is her friend and loves her. Could it be that  somebody at home, someone back in Ingle   Heights, gave her some  poison to bring along with her, and she is taking it with no thought of harm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems incredible, but so few things are really  impossible of belief. I won&rsquo;t say, Ballard, that this idea is entirely new to  me, but it is so astounding, so monstrous I can&rsquo;t seem to adjust myself to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at that. I feel just the same way. And  yet, they say she is all right this morning. Is there any vile potion, any  tropical slimy poison stuff that could be given her secretly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how? No one has access to her alone, except Leif and  Tonka. You can&rsquo;t suspect them, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Stone, I thought you&rsquo;d understand! Of course I don&rsquo;t  suspect anyone and I shan&rsquo;t until I have to; but could it be possible? If so we  can take up manner, motive and identity afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Ballard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Stone told him of the things that Doctor Parrott  had revealed the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; the detective wound up, &ldquo;it may possibly be  plain, everyday sunburn to an exaggerated degree, it may be some rare and  insidious disease and it may be something which Doctor Parrott didn&rsquo;t recognize  because I didn&rsquo;t state the case <i>in  extenso</i>. But, as I look at it, Ballard, it&rsquo;s not a question for you or me,  we know nothing of these obscure ailments. If asked, I should advise getting  the sick woman to a hospital as quickly as possible. But I&rsquo;ve no right to  advise her husband unless I am asked. And even then, I should merely make the  suggestion. It is for Leif Murray, or for Isabel herself to decide what shall  be done. She is sane enough between attacks, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t look on them as periodic attacks, I think  some day soon she will have one of these strange convulsions and die in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it probable you are right. It is a terrible situation.  I am quite ready to do anything to help, but I don&rsquo;t see my way clear. Can you  advise me? I feared I was going beyond the proprieties when I consulted my  medical friend. And, look here, Ballard, I won&rsquo;t take any step without  consulting Murray.  He may know more than we do about her illness, and not want to tell. You know  how people are about certain diseases. Mayn&rsquo;t this be some strange form of  cancer? You know that has many vagaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Craddock would have known if it were cancer. Yes,  that is unpredictable in its various forms, but&mdash; well, I don&rsquo;t know what to do,  I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything for the moment. Wait through today,  unless indeed Mrs. Murray grows rapidly worse. Then let&rsquo;s have a session with  Murray himself and find out just where he stands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Ballard went away, and joined the group on the after  deck, while Fleming Stone leaned back in his chair, with a feeling he had not  experienced for a long time, the feeling of utter despair.</p>
<p>Suddenly, acting on an impulse, he rang the bell that  called William.</p>
<p>That impeccable automaton appeared at once and awaited  orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where Miss Mead is?&rdquo; Stone asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; she is on the after deck, with the  others.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to her, William, and ask her if she will come here to  see me for a few moments. If possible, ask her without the rest hearing, but  don&rsquo;t seem to make a secret of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William was good at understanding, and the result was  Tonka&rsquo;s appearance at Stone&rsquo;s cabin door, shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Tonka,&rdquo; Stone greeted her. &ldquo;I wonder if you care  to be perfectly frank with me and tell me exactly how Mrs. Murray was affected  last evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though not beautiful, Tonka looked very attractive. Sport  clothes were becoming to her, especially those with the nautical touch. Her  yellow hair was tossed by the deck breezes and her tan was very becoming.</p>
<p>At Stone&rsquo;s words, she flung herself into a chair and  looked at him helplessly, while big tears formed in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so strange,&rdquo; she said, almost in a whisper; &ldquo;but  bad as the attack was&mdash;and it was horrible&mdash;it is the mystery of it all that  frightens me. How could Isa, how could anybody have that fiendish convulsion,  and then wake up this morning perfectly well and in good spirits, seemingly. Of  course, she isn&rsquo;t perfectly well, but except for her poor scarred face, no one  would know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No other symptoms of illness this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t say that. Yes, there are other things. She  can&rsquo;t seem to walk without assistance. She stumbles in her speech, too. And she  is just a little flighty, but not much. Yet she is as gay as a lark in her  manner, and her smile is bright and even happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no immediate reason, that you know of, for her  attack last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. We had a pleasant evening, almost a gay one. Antony was in his  nonsensical vein, and when he&rsquo;s that way, he&rsquo;s awfully funny. And we had  champagne and caviare sandwiches and Isabel enjoyed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing she ate or drank upset her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It was an hour or more after we had the champagne  that she was so ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told Leif about it? You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and I didn&rsquo;t make it out quite as bad as it really  was. You know Leif hated to go ashore and leave her here, but it was lucky he  did. If she had had that spasm in a restaurant, it would have been too awful.  Leif is so devoted he never wants to be away from her, but she made him see  that he owed it to his guests to go with them. And of course, he could have  done nothing for Isabel if he had been here. It was a dreadful scene. Don&rsquo;t  tell Leif, but I honestly thought she was going to die. And I know Antony thought so. He  didn&rsquo;t say so, afterward, but I could see the fear in his eyes when Isabel  seemed to be fighting for the very breath of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonka,&rdquo; Stone spoke suddenly, &ldquo;is there any foul play  going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scarcely knew himself what response he looked for, but  it certainly was not the reply he got.</p>
<p>The piquant little face changed utterly. A red flush dyed  it for an instant and then passed leaving it deathly white. The eyes showed  fear, shame and a sort of horror, and Tonka grasped the chair arms with  trembling fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&mdash;so you&rsquo;ve found me out,&rdquo; she said, in a low whisper. </p>
<p>Fleming Stone stared at her.</p>
<p>Almost unable to speak, he grasped the situation and  mastered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, with a little smile, &ldquo;suppose  you tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was struggling to regain her poise and was  succeeding. She was quiet now, and her breathing was even and normal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what you think I have found out&mdash;and perhaps I  have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Tonka was herself again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she said, lightly, &ldquo;if you find anything out,  you&rsquo;d better tell me. Aren&rsquo;t you coming out on deck? Better come along. They&rsquo;re  fixing up a gala of some sort for tonight. Are you keen on that sort of thing?  I trow not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tonka laughed in his face, and indeed it was laughable to  think of that stern-faced man being interested in anything of a gala nature.</p>
<p>But the infectious laugh of the girl stirred some  responsive chord, and he said, almost gaily;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I am! I adore that sort of thing! Try me and  see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; and Tonka grasped his hand, as he rose  from his chair.</p>
<p>Just outside they met Elaine and Giles Trumbull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run along, Tonka,&rdquo; Giles said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll all follow in a few  minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tonka ran along and the other three went into Stone&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a few well chosen words,&rdquo; Elaine asked for, and they  sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have no right to ask you,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;in fact I  was afraid to come here, but Giles said he&rsquo;d protect me if you became very  ferocious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it,&rdquo; Stone said, wondering what was coming now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Isabel, and I don&rsquo;t know just how to put it&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it as plainly as possible,&rdquo; Stone told her, in his  gentlest way.</p>
<p>Elaine ran her fingers through her dark curls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;Well, then, I have a feeling,  perhaps absurd, that there is something wrong with Isabel. Something more, I  mean, than any known disease, however obscure and rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Stone, encouragingly; &ldquo;you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak out, Elaine,&rdquo; Giles prompted, but her appealing  glance at him made him go on, himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To put it plainly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Elaine means something  supernatural. A curse&mdash;or the evil eye, or something weird and mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of his desire not to, Stone had to smile a little  at these two seemingly sensible people proposing to him this ridiculous theory.</p>
<p>But he spoke seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean this literally?&rdquo; he asked Elaine. &ldquo;Do you  really have some such idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to that!&rdquo; She grasped at the expression. &ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s the way I want it put. Some such idea is what I have. But it doesn&rsquo;t get  me anywhere. I know all superstition is not only wrong but it is silly. All the  same, your wide experiences must have taught you that there are people in this  world, of wide knowledge and wise understanding, who are superstitious and are  not ashamed of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Vernon, I do know that. I have known such. I am  not superstitious myself, but I have no scorn for those who are. I myself  believe in certain signs and portents that others might laugh at. Do you care  to tell me more in detail what you are getting at? Does your superstition have  any bearing on the matter of Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; and Elaine looked troubled. &ldquo;You see, Isabel  and I are such old friends and such dear friends that I can&rsquo;t speak to her  about this without hurting her feelings. I mean, when I humor her superstitious  moods she is glad and she gets expansive and tells me things. But if I seem to  disapprove, she gets hurt and shuts up like a clam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Trumbull  corroborated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often ragged Isabel about her foolish notions, and she sure  does get huffy. So I&rsquo;ve learned to let her alone on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does her husband hold with these chimeras?&rdquo; Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Elaine said, hesitatingly. &ldquo;Really, that is the one  flaw in their happiness. I never knew a more devoted couple; their tastes are  alike, almost always. Then they always like the same people and the same  places, and they never squabble over anything unless the subject of  superstition comes up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems unfortunate,&rdquo; Stone said, musingly. &ldquo;But are you  linking up superstition with Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what perplexes me,&rdquo; Elaine looked thoughtful. &ldquo;She  links them. She has a crazy notion that this skin disease that she has, is sent  her by a wicked fate of some sort as a punishment for the pride she took in her  lovely complexion. She was vain of it, any woman would be. But what I want to  ask you, Mr. Stone, is this.&rdquo; Elaine shook her shoulders and seemed to  straighten herself as if getting down to cases. &ldquo;Do you advise me, when she  talks of her superstitious fears, to humor her, by which I mean seem to agree  with her, or to tell her, as kindly as I can, not to look on it as a punishment  for her sinful vanity, but to accept it as an illness which we must use every  possible means to cure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to seem ungracious, Mrs. Vernon, and I know  you will think I am merely tossing the ball back to you; but as I know Mrs. Murray  so slightly, that is, so superficially, I scarcely dare advise. In so far as my  advice is of any use, I feel I ought to tell you that it always seems to me  dangerous to humor such important errors as Mrs. Murray seems to have fallen  into. Yet there are exceptions, and as I say, I cannot judge whether this case  is one of those exceptions or not. But may I, without offense, tell you that I  feel sure you will choose the wisest course. I have observed the sincere and  trusting friendship between yourself and Isabel Murray. And I feel that such a  deep affection as exists between you two will show you what is undoubtedly the  best thing to do. Perhaps you could cleverly steer a course between agreeing  with her too readily and differing from her too abruptly. If you can, avoid or  dismiss the subject when it comes up. Though I well know that would need adroit  effort, I am sure you could compass it, often if not always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Stone,&rdquo; and Giles Trumbull&rsquo;s big fine face  showed his appreciation of the detective&rsquo;s speech. &ldquo;Now, Elaine, aren&rsquo;t you  glad I made you come here and get just the very advice and encouragement you  needed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Giles, I am. You&rsquo;re a great help, Mr. Stone, and I  shall not forget a word you said. I&rsquo;ll think it over and mentally digest it,  and it will be of definite use to me in my dealings with Isabel. She is such a  darling, I hate to cross her in any way, but as you have shown me, I do see my  way clear to do the right thing. How can I ever thank you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your kind and sincere appreciation is all the thanks I  want, Mrs. Vernon. That, and a promise that you will tell me if things work out  well, and you find you can avert, even to a slight extent, that fear and dread  of the supernatural that now torments Mrs. Murray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, now,&rdquo; Giles urged; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s join the crowd, or  they&rsquo;ll think we&rsquo;re plotting treasons, stratagems and spoils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when they joined the others, it was Isabel herself who  made the accusation. &ldquo;I know what you people have been up to,&rdquo; she said,  shaking a playful finger at them.</p>
<p>And it was pitiful to see how the slender finger shook  with an intractable force, quite apart from the roguish motion Isabel meant to  give it.</p>
<p>Every muscular action of her left side was uncertain and  trembling.</p>
<p>When she walked her left foot dragged. When she moved her  arms the left one followed laggingly behind the other.</p>
<p>That Isabel was conscious of this was shown by the efforts  she made to hide it. So no one appeared to notice it, and the party carried on  as if there were no terrifying fear hanging over their heads, no hint of  tragedy to come.</p>
<p>And, too, Isabel was in the highest of spirits. She was  nervous and tremulous physically, but mentally she was unusually quick-witted  and seemed to be thoroughly enjoying herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you people have been up to,&rdquo; she said;  &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been concocting some fun for tonight. You can&rsquo;t deny it. All right, but  you must tell Leo about it He&rsquo;s master of ceremonies and he&rsquo;s a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a good one, all right,&rdquo; Jewett told them, &ldquo;if  you&rsquo;ll give me good numbers. Some of them are arranged, and I&rsquo;ll vouch for  them, myself. Mr. Stone, we want something from you. What&rsquo;s your specialty in  parlor tricks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A spiritualistic s&eacute;ance,&rdquo; Fleming Stone replied,  seemingly unconscious of one or two startled gasps from somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, glorious!&rdquo; exclaimed Fleda Garrison. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love that  of all things! Do put it over, Leo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he will,&rdquo; came Isabel&rsquo;s clear voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love  that, too. You don&rsquo;t mind, Leif?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Murray  was scowling as if really angered at the suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it you mean a burlesque one, Stone,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not  the real thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a real thing?&rdquo; Stone said, chaffingly. &ldquo;Yes, I  mean a burlesque. I thought our whole program was to be fun-making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is.&rdquo; Leif seemed relieved. &ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;ll do my  farmyard buffoonery, shall I, Heartsease?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; Isabel said, with an affectionate smile. &ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t heard that in the longest while, and I love it. You&rsquo;ll enjoy that, Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shall; what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that out when you hear it. Leif does it so  cleverly. Now fix up your s&eacute;ance, Mr. Stone. I&rsquo;m strong for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antony Ballard was a fine ventriloquist and he agreed to  do his bit.</p>
<p>As it turned out there would be too many turns for one  evening, they decided to make it up for two, half taking part one night and  half the next.</p>
<p>All day, Isabel remained happy and well, save for her  disfigured face, and she seemed oblivious of that as she turned her attention  to the preparations for the entertainment.</p>
<p>Leo Jewett was a prestidigitator of real merit, and  needing a lady assistant he chose Isabel for the part, and trained her in the  tricks he meant to play. This, however, was to come on the second night&rsquo;s  program.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, Elaine persuaded Isabel to go to  her cabin for a rest before the evening&rsquo;s gayeties. She went willingly enough,  and soon Tonka reported her as being peacefully asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in the world,&rdquo; Elaine found occasion to say to  Fleming Stone, &ldquo;did you plan a s&eacute;ance, of all things? I thought you wanted me  to keep Isabel off such things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In earnest, yes,&rdquo; Stone returned. &ldquo;But my idea is just a  burlesque, you know. We sit round in a circle and odd speeches and such things  happen, and I&rsquo;m hoping it will lead Mrs. Muray to see the ridiculous side of  it, and so feel less confidence in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. You&rsquo;ve conversation planned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in part. But impromptu stuff is better than cut and  dried lines. I&rsquo;m sure it will be amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it will. Can I be in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, I&rsquo;m depending on you to watch Mrs. Murray.  See how she takes it. I want to know exactly what she does or says. I&rsquo;d ask  Tonka to do this, but the girl has so much on her mind. She&rsquo;s practically  hostess, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they assembled in the big living-room, gay with  lights and flowers, Isabel was the life of the party.</p>
<p>She chaffed Jim Garrison on being too quiet, and told him  she had a stunt for him to do the next night and it would make a big hit. She  flirted with Leo Jewett, and told him a funny wisecrack that he could put in  his monologue.</p>
<p>Then she went and cuddled down beside Leif on a love seat,  and waited for the s&eacute;ance to take place.</p>
<p>At last its turn came, and Isabel took her place at the  round table, whereon everybody laid two outstretched hands, little fingers  touching their neighbors. And the place went dark.</p>
<p>A queer sort of little figure scampered across a white  sheet hung on the wall and Micky Mouse squeaked out a message to Ballard,  avowedly from his faraway sweetheart.</p>
<p>They all knew it was Antony&rsquo;s  skilled ventriloquism and the laughter was more and louder.</p>
<p>The number was nearly over, and they sat in the darkness,  listening for the final absurdity, when a deep, almost guttural voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beware, Isabel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were not spoken clearly, they were slurred, but  that only made them more startling. The effect they gave was so different from  Ballard&rsquo;s foolery, that it was hard to believe it was his work. Yet what else?</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment and then a loud scream from  Isabel, followed by a rattle in her throat and an unearthly groan that was like  nothing human.</p>
<p>Stone flashed on the lights, he had made sure that it  would be in his power to do this, and they saw Isabel in the throes of an awful  convulsion, her head turned awry, her eyes staring, her breath coming in  audible gasps, and a wild shriek of mad laughter coming at intervals from her  frothing lips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  The Inexplicable Voice</b></h2>
<p>Elaine went on deck the next morning, she found Leif  already there, smoking and musing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Leif,&rdquo; she said, gently, &ldquo;I am so sorry for you. How  is Isabel this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s asleep now,&rdquo; and there was a quiver in the man&rsquo;s  voice. &ldquo;She had a bad night. Not convulsions, no, but restless and jerky  motions and pitiful moans. Then she&rsquo;d talk, gosh, how she talked! Rattled away  like mad, and all of it senseless, light-headed talk. Not like delirium but  just babbling, with little bursts of silly laughter. That was the worst, I  think. It made us fear she was losing her mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us? Who was with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonka. She heard Isabel laugh and she came in about dawn,  so I could get a rest. Tonka&rsquo;s a good girl. I have never liked her, but she is  a marvel with Isabel. She can quiet her when I can&rsquo;t do anything with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can manage Isabel, too. It&rsquo;s a knack. Call me next time  she is so restless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will. I say, Elaine, I&rsquo;m thinking of stopping today at Atlantic City. I&rsquo;ll go  ashore and go to the hospital. Then if I can get a doctor, a sort of  specialist, you know, to come over here, I&rsquo;ll bring him back with me and let  him take a look at Isabel. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a fine idea. But he&rsquo;ll tell you she ought to  be taken to the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then we&rsquo;ll take her. I think she ought to go  there myself. I&rsquo;ve just begun to realize that she is in a bad way. In a  dangerous way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, everybody else has already seen that. But that&rsquo;s not  surprising. It&rsquo;s the nearest and dearest who are blinded to such things. Can we  get her over there in case we decide to take her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Tonka will go along, and if necessary, William  can carry her across the dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go along, too. I&rsquo;ll keep her tuned up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She feeling pretty fair this morning. Not quite herself,  as she was yesterday morning, but calm and peaceful&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was far from peaceful last night. I was so  frightened, Leif.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s when she&rsquo;s quiet that I&rsquo;m frightened. This morning,  she is not only gentle and mild, but she is amiable and docile. With Isabel  that always means something is the matter with her. Always, if she has a cold  or a headache she at once becomes gracious and kindly, and if she turns  considerate or grateful, I know it&rsquo;s something serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elaine couldn&rsquo;t help smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Leif, how absurd! Don&rsquo;t say such things about the  poor darling. She is ill, of course; and I think it is a very mysterious case.  Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it should be to experienced physicians.  That&rsquo;s why I want to get the best possible advice. And I&rsquo;m sure at Atlantic City the doctors  will be specially</p>
<p>experienced in sunburn diseases. For of course, this  trouble of Isabel&rsquo;s has to be some sort of sun poison. You&rsquo;ve heard of sun  poison, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, yes; siriasis is the professional name for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot you had a doctor for a father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did; and I learned a smattering of knowledge from him.  Especially about nursing. I took care of him in his last illness, and I became  quite a good nurse. That&rsquo;s why I want you to let me help with Isabel. Tonka is  well-meaning but ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Tonka is a right good nurse. But, Lord knows,  if you can do anything more, for my blessed wife, I hope you will. You go and  see her, and if she wants you to stand by, you stand. Don&rsquo;t offend little Tonka,  she&rsquo;s a good scout, if she doesn&rsquo;t know all of her onions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Garrisons came along then and Elaine slipped away to  Isabel&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>Ballard appeared from somewhere and Fleda at once began  her petty babble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Ballard, you were just too wonderful last night.  And the way you said, &lsquo;Beware, Isabel!&rsquo; sounded just as if a ghost said it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Antony gave the speaker a quick look and  then turned to Murray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leif,&rdquo; he said, speaking slowly, &ldquo;I want it thoroughly  understood that I did not say those two words, &lsquo;Beware, Isabel.&rsquo; I did not. And  I want that thoroughly understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Ballard, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and Fleda looked at him  with wide open eyes. &ldquo;Then it must have been a real spook! For nobody here can  ventriloquize the way you do. Oh, how exciting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than exciting, Fleda,&rdquo; Leif said, gently, &ldquo;and  I want you to take it more seriously. Isabel is very ill, and today I&rsquo;m going  to see a doctor about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, Leif? Atlantic    City?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ll stop there this afternoon, and go ashore to see  a doctor at the hospital. Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, can I go with you? Can I get off at Atlantic City?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Fleda,&rdquo; Leif said, shortly. &ldquo;Yes, you can go  ashore, if you like, providing you are back at the dock, when you are told to  be there. If not, we&rsquo;ll go on without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be there. Jim will be with me, and he&rsquo;ll keep  track of the time, won&rsquo;t you, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; but keep still now, dear, Leif is worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed he is,&rdquo; Ballard put in. &ldquo;We all are, or ought to  be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am,&rdquo; and Fleda looked deeply distressed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going  to see Isabel now. Is she in her cabin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and Tonka is in charge. If she says you can&rsquo;t see  Isabel this morning, don&rsquo;t insist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go along and look after my girl,&rdquo; Jim Garrison said,  smiling, and the two went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Ballard,&rdquo; Leif began, &ldquo;do you really mean you  didn&rsquo;t speak that warning, or whatever it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I didn&rsquo;t, Leif. But, equally of course, it was  no spook. Someone on board is a ventriloquist besides myself. What price  Jewett?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would he cut up such a trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would anybody? Yet somebody did. Here comes Stone.  Let&rsquo;s ask him about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think Ballard did it,&rdquo; Stone said, when he was  asked. &ldquo;The whole voice was quite different from his. You noticed that, Leif?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not definitely, no. I was sorry we had the fool thing. I  never would have consented, but Isabel begged so hard, I couldn&rsquo;t refuse her.  She said of course it was only burlesque, but even now, I&rsquo;m sure she thinks it  was a supernatural voice that spoke to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s some knavery,&rdquo; Stone suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Leif answered gently, &ldquo;not that. But someone with a  twisted idea of humor must have spoken the words. And we were all pretty well  keyed up for fun and for general burlesque. But I can&rsquo;t think who did it. It  may have been Jewett. He&rsquo;s not quite our sort. I invited him because he and  Elaine are rather beaux, and I thought she&rsquo;d like to have him along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice the way the words were spoken?&rdquo; Stone  asked. &ldquo;The b&rsquo;s were not sounded. Instead of &lsquo;Beware Isabel,&rsquo; that voice really  said, &lsquo;Eware Isawel.&rsquo; That was because a clearer pronunciation would have made  the voice more recognizable. It might well have been Jewett. He&rsquo;s a jolly sort,  and he may have had no thought in the matter except to add a bit of verity to  the performance. We must find out if he is a ventriloquist. If not, he must be  counted out. For whoever spoke knew enough to throw his voice. And also knew  enough not to pronounce the letters that would be indicative. I don&rsquo;t believe  anybody did it with the intent of scaring Mrs. Murray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; and Leif looked relieved. &ldquo;Well, now, we mustn&rsquo;t  let it spoil our trip. You fellows forget it and have a good day&rsquo;s sail. We&rsquo;ll  hang up for a time this afternoon at Atlantic City, and you&rsquo;d better go ashore,  you can find some fun, of most any kind you like best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group dispersed, and just then Elaine returned, and  Giles Trumbull was with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, you two,&rdquo; Leif said, &ldquo;just the ones I wanted. Be  serious now. Did you see Isabel, Elaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; Tonka said she was asleep, and better not disturb  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonka is one handsome liar. But never mind that. Listen  here. I&rsquo;m going ashore right after luncheon, and I&rsquo;m going to a hospital. There  must be some in Atlantic City.  I want Giles to go with me but not anyone else. No, not you, Elaine. But here&rsquo;s  what I want of you. Both of you. If I find that Isabel must go to the hospital  and stay there for treatment or something like that, then I do not want the  party broken up. I shall stay with her, of course, and Tonka. But I want all  the rest of you to continue the cruise. And I want you two to act as host and  hostess. The captain has my sailing orders, and you can change or amend them as  you like. My idea was to go on down to Old Point Comfort and up Chesapeake Bay,  Gibson Island and all that. But if you prefer,  go some other way. William will take your orders and the Captain will carry  them out. And you two must make it a pleasant and satisfactory trip to those  who stay on board. That is, the Garrisons, Jewett, Ballard, and Stone, if he  stays on. I don&rsquo;t know what he will do. Get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Elaine said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll do my best, Leif. I hope it  won&rsquo;t be necessary; I hope the doctor will fix up Isa without her having to go  to the hospital. But if it all goes as you suggest, then Giles and I will hold  the fort till you two come back. Won&rsquo;t we, Giles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. If it&rsquo;s really the best that way. How about calling  the trip off if Isabel has to go to the hospital? Take it later in the season,  after she gets all well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leif looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isabel will never get all well,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  tell the others, but I feel certain that her brain is affected. It is more than  delirium that makes her talk so wildly. However, forget it now, after I see the  doctor we can make our plans. I&rsquo;m sorry the trip is such a disappointment to  you all, but things may clear up yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leif rose and walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a dear boy,&rdquo; Elaine said, looking after him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so  sorry for him, but I daren&rsquo;t say so, he doesn&rsquo;t like to be pitied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. Well, all we can do is to fall in with his  plans, whatever they may be, and do anything he wants us to. We can be of no  help to him in Atlantic City,  so we may as well stay on the yacht and cruise about until further orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some people might not consider that a hard task,&rdquo; Elaine  tried to smile; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m anxious about Isabel myself. And too, I own up, I&rsquo;m a  bit superstitious. I thought that deep voice last night was a real spook. And  &mdash;I think so yet. There&rsquo;s a lot in that spiritism that I don&rsquo;t scoff at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s discuss that now, Elaine. As Leif advised,  let&rsquo;s forget it for the time being. Of course, I don&rsquo;t mean forget our Isabel,  but forget what happened last night. Here&rsquo;s Fleda Garrison coming this way!  Excuse me while I disappear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giles whisked himself out of sight just in time to escape  the newcomer, and Elaine assumed at once her role of hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were going to call at Atlantic City, this afternoon,&rdquo; she said;  &ldquo;want to go ashore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; Fleda said, &ldquo;Leif invited us.  Won&rsquo;t it be gay! I love Atlantic City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elaine felt amazement at Fleda&rsquo;s attitude of gayety in  spite of the tragedy that seemed imminent, but she could say nothing of this.</p>
<p>And so, in the afternoon, everybody went to Atlantic City except  Isabel and Tonka.</p>
<p>Leif, with Giles, went to a hospital, and gained audience  with Doctor Appleton, a famed specialist.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone had recommended this man, and was of help in  arranging the interview. Stone proposed to wait for the doctor&rsquo;s opinion and  then go back to Ingle   Heights at once, not  returning to the Terpsichore at all.</p>
<p>Doctor Appleton listened to Leif&rsquo;s recital, at first,  calmly, and then, as the tale went on, becoming more excited and at last  horrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, man, stop! I can&rsquo;t stand any more horrors. I must  see her at once! You must get me to your yacht straightaway. Come along. It may  be meningitis, and yet&mdash;no, more like some tropical disease&mdash;sleeping sickness,  oh, I hope not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the doctor still murmuring to himself they went back  to the yacht, and straight to Isabel&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>She was awake, but her eyes had a wide, vacant stare and  she paid no attention to the entrance of Leif and the strange doctor.</p>
<p>She was talking, in a low, uninflected tone, about cameras  and snapshots, but the words carried no meaning, only senseless repetitions.</p>
<p>When the doctor questioned her, she answered mostly at  random, but now and then with real understanding.</p>
<p>Appleton examined closely the eruption on  the left side of her face.</p>
<p>He rose abruptly and left the room.</p>
<p>Leif followed and Giles too. They went into an unused cabin  and Giles shut the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am baffled,&rdquo; Doctor Appleton began, looking very  bewildered. &ldquo;I had notions of pellagra or something on that order. But, no;  there are contradictory symptoms. Then, I thought, some skin poison, like a  very exaggerated case of poison ivy. But that would certainly spread to the  other side of her face. I still think it may be some unusual phase of cancer of  the skin, entirely unknown to us&mdash;but in any case, she must be taken to the  hospital just as soon as possible, and kept there until all danger is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she isn&rsquo;t going to die?&rdquo; Leif&rsquo;s face lighted up as  with an inner radiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hold out no hopes,&rdquo; Appleton said, gravely, &ldquo;but if she remains  here she will certainly die, and speedily. To treat her properly I need the apparatus  and appointments of a hospital, also the consultation and advice of other  physicians. I would rather leave the transference till tomorrow, but I fear  that might be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Leif and Giles sat as if stunned, looking at the  scholarly face and feeling sure that the words they heard were true ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be as you say, Doctor,&rdquo; Leif told him, choking a  little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I say we must start action at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decree was obeyed by everyone concerned.</p>
<p>Leif told Giles that he must now be the host of the party,  and Elaine the hostess, as he had already explained to them.</p>
<p>He said he hoped they could have a pleasant trip, wherever  they chose to go. That they could keep in touch with him by telephoning from  various ports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I had a wireless telephone on  board. I didn&rsquo;t have it, because I wanted a chance to escape from all  communications. But perhaps the hospital doings will result in a certainty as  to what is the trouble and a swift and sure cure for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William the ever present and always capable steward packed  up his master&rsquo;s things for a stay at a hotel, listened attentively to the  orders Leif gave him, and agreed to give Trumbull  the same loyal service he had always given Leif.</p>
<p>Isabel, for the most part delirious, was rational now and  then, but for brief periods only.</p>
<p>Leif began to feel a queer numbness creeping over him. He  couldn&rsquo;t believe that it was really Isabel and himself who were thus being  looked after. That he was taking orders from this strange doctor, and carrying  them out to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>He went in to look at Isabel, and she chanced to be sane  for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Leif,&rdquo; she said, smiling at him just as she used  to. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. We&rsquo;re going to take you for a little  visit in another house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Visit? House? What do you mean, dear? You know I&rsquo;m a  bear&mdash;a big, big bear, with a grizzly head&mdash;oh, Leif dear, all my pretty curls  are coming out! Will you get me some more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isabel looked so sweet and dear and yet her mind was  surely gone. Leif couldn&rsquo;t stand it and he went off to his own cabin and shut  himself in alone.</p>
<p>Soon Ballard came to fetch him, saying it was time to  start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going with you, Leif,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you and I will  stay at the hotel nearest to the hospital, and Tonka, too, unless they will let  her stay in the hospital, to be with Isabel. Come along, old chap, everything  is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Always in command himself, Leif had to adjust his thoughts  to being told what to do.</p>
<p>But Ballard managed well, and before they entirely  realized it, the little journey was over and Isabel was safely in bed in a  large airy room, and white garbed nurses were looking after her.</p>
<p>Then they went to the Hotel Eiffel, where Antony had secured a suite, and Leif and  Tonka, Fleming Stone and Ballard sat down in the pleasant sitting room for a  conference.</p>
<p>But there was little to be said. As soon as the first  report came in from the doctor, Stone planned to leave them and go back to Ingle Heights  to look after his work there.</p>
<p>Tonka went to her room, and the three men sat for a moment  in silence.</p>
<p>Then Stone said, &ldquo;Who said that &lsquo;Beware Isabel,&rsquo; last  night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know,&rdquo; Antony said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s attributed to me, but I  didn&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I knew it was not your voice. That&rsquo;s a thing I have  to find out and I don&rsquo;t see just how I&rsquo;m to do it. But I&rsquo;ll get it somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write to Giles Trumbull,&rdquo; Leif suggested. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll pick up  mail and telegrams at Cape May. Or, better,  I&rsquo;ll do it for you, and telephone results to you. I&rsquo;ve nothing to do here, and  I&rsquo;ll explain it to Giles, who&rsquo;s clever at such things. But I think it was  Jewett. He has a hick sense of humor, and I think he meant it as a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably that is the way it happened. All right, you  write to him then, and telephone me the results, if any. I&rsquo;ll be at the Inn for a while, and of course, I want to hear how our  patient is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone did not say that he had already made  arrangements to have definite and frequent reports from the hospital, as to  Isabel&rsquo;s progress.</p>
<p>Tonka joined the group again, and when the telephone rang Antony proposed that the  girl answer it. He knew she was eager to get the news, and he knew too, if it  was not encouraging she was better fitted to hear it than Leif.</p>
<p>Doctor Appleton made the report, and he said that though  they had done all they could at present, they were not prepared to say just  what the ailment was. Siriasis was indicated, but it seemed probable there was  some other and different trouble.</p>
<p>Certain tests had to be made and experiments tried, and  there would be no further report until the next morning, when they might call  him at eleven o&rsquo;clock. No, they could not visit her, but he hoped he could soon  raise the ban. Everything possible was being done for Mrs. Murray, and she was  suffering no pain. Indeed they found it best to keep her under the influence of  mild opiates most of the time.</p>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s report ended and Tonka was about to cradle  the instrument, when Stone stopped her by a gesture and took the telephone  himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, doctor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May I ask a favor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Mr. Stone, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This; will you have a nurse who can take down most or  much of what the patient says in her delirium? I mean any definite or  surprising speeches; and especially the name of anyone she calls for or seems  to want to see. I think the nurse will understand. I want to learn how Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s  brain is working. What she thinks about, and principally, what, if anything,  she has on her mind that troubles her. Get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; we would have recorded most things you mention  anyway. But I&rsquo;ll have it made more specific and send you the results. Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone told him and said good-by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said to the others, &ldquo;I want you to go to dinner  with me. I know a most amusing place, Tonka will love it. There is no cause for  worry about Isabel just now, and you people must not give way to dumps and  doldrums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; said Ballard, heartily. &ldquo;Get ready,  Tonka, and you, Leif, come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leif seemed pleased with the idea and each put up a brave  front, for the sake of the others.</p>
<p>Dinner over they dropped in at a show, and then Stone left  them, to take a night train to New    York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good sort,&rdquo; Antony  said, after his departure. &ldquo;I never thought big detectives could be so  likable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Tonka. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re bound to be wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wisdom is better than rubies, but it doesn&rsquo;t always help  along human camaraderie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is fine,&rdquo; Leif declared. &ldquo;And he surely knows things.  How I wish we could have stayed on the yacht, and kept him with us. And Isabel.  I say, Antony,  she isn&rsquo;t going to die, is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, no, man! But I&rsquo;m lots better satisfied to have her  under skilled care. They say Appleton  is the best ever on mental troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever made Isabel have mental trouble?&rdquo; Leif wailed  the question like a frightened child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the sun did that. But tomorrow we&rsquo;ll know a  whole lot more than we do now. You run along to bed, Tonka. I&rsquo;ll carry Leif off  for a nightcap, and we&rsquo;ll all meet at breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  Is It Paley We Want?</b></h2>
<p>REACHING the Inn late  Wednesday night, Fleming Stone was awake and alert early next morning and was  downstairs by nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Kenton came to greet him and corroborated his expectation  that the police would come to see him about eleven and that Paul Tolman was  expected in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work,&rdquo; and Stone nodded appreciation. &ldquo;Mr. Paley  showed up yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Kenton, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;re in a fine pother about  it. Me, I say, why worry? Paley hasn&rsquo;t been kidnapped, and if he has, what of  it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t look at it just that way,&rdquo; Stone told him; &ldquo;I  hope Paley will turn up and soon. What&rsquo;s the feeling of the G.P.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, folks in general think Paley most likely did for  Tolman. But of course, they haven&rsquo;t any real evidence. That Mead girl started  them off with her yarn, and they&rsquo;re always glad to grab at a suspect. When Paul  Tolman gets here, we may get some more facts, but I&rsquo;m not sure we will. Are  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I think we will. Hope so, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone was glad to get back to the quiet atmosphere of the Inn. He had gone on the yacht for reasons of his own, and  he was glad he went, but he was fed up with Fleda&rsquo;s foolishness, and Leo  Jewett&rsquo;s unattractive personality. And his friends, the Murrays were in such  trouble, it made his heart ache to remember. Here in the big, roomy,  tree-shaded Inn, he could relax and think over  things. For the most part the guests were not intrusive, and Kenton&rsquo;s tact and  intuition kept them from forcing themselves on Stone&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>When Coroner Coles and Lieutenant Browning arrived, they  found the detective waiting for them on a small side porch, which he had more  or less pre-empted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; Coles began, after they  were seated, &ldquo;but Mr. Paley escaped our vigilance. We were watchful and we  remembered our promise to you to keep him in our pocket, but he got away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnapped, maybe,&rdquo; Stone said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; assented Browning, &ldquo;but more likely he just  desired a change of scene. And it was an easy trick. We shadowed him a lot, but  we didn&rsquo;t follow his every footstep. When he went to New York, he always came back in the early  afternoon, and when he went there yesterday, we assumed he&rsquo;d come back as  usual, but he hasn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Lieutenant, but I know how hard it is to keep  your eye on a man in the circumstances. Perhaps he&rsquo;ll turn up yet, but I&rsquo;ll be  more surprised if he does than if he doesn&rsquo;t. Did you find out any facts about  Peter Tolman&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try as we would we couldn&rsquo;t get a lead in that direction.  I feel sure that he left no will, but if he did, it is doubtless in the  possession of Paul Tolman. Don&rsquo;t think we are slacks, Mr. Stone, but what can  we do? All the papers and personal belongings of Peter Tolman were carried off  by Paul Tolman, when he went back home. He&rsquo;s coming tonight, and he can speak  for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was Doctor Coles&rsquo; speech and though of mild language,  there was a touch of resentment in the tone, which clearly indicated that he  had been asked to make bricks without straw. This he found himself unable to  do, and Fleming Stone was the last man to misunderstand that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Coles,&rdquo; he said, genially, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you  couldn&rsquo;t pull it off. Paul Tolman will certainly know about the will, if he has  it, and if not he may know whether it is in a lawyer&rsquo;s keeping or what not. Now  I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve found out. And that is that Peter Tolman did not die  from the unassisted effects of the prussic acid in peach pits. I consulted with  an expert toxicologist in Long Branch  and also with a medical man of highest standing in the hospital where Mrs. Murray  now is. Both these physicians assured me, of their own individual knowledge,  that death could not ensue from the eating of peach kernels. Therefore it is my  intention to look upon this death of Peter Tolman as wilful murder, and I  propose to make an effort to hunt down the criminal. This, of course, with the  sanction of Mr. Paul Tolman who has retained me on the case. But if Paul Tolman  prefers to dispense with my services, then I shall go on with my investigations  on my own. I have become deeply interested in the case, and I want to proceed  with some plans I have made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks pretty hopeless to me,&rdquo; Browning observed. &ldquo;I think  unless we can get Paley and get him pretty quick, we can take no further step.  I can&rsquo;t see any other prospect for a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet there might be several,&rdquo; Stone suggested. &ldquo;We know  really very little of Peter Tolman&rsquo;s friends or enemies. We know little of the  events or incidents of his recent life, and we have looked into such matters  almost not at all. However, I propose to wait for Paul Tolman and his views on  the subject. Have you that envelope, Doctor Coles, in which peach kernels came  to Peter Tolman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the envelope I think you refer to, but I cannot  swear that peach kernels came to Tolman in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. But I&rsquo;d like to see it, if I may. I  have a notion it might throw a ray of light on our uncertainties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how, I&rsquo;m sure, Mr. Stone, but of course you  may see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I walk over to Headquarters with you now. Is it  over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Come along, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three went along to the coroner&rsquo;s office, but a sort  of damper had somehow fallen on their conversation.</p>
<p>The policemen were feeling a bit chagrined that they had  not done the two errands Stone had asked of them. Stone wasn&rsquo;t minding this so  much, but he was hoping they had the envelope he wanted, intact and unsoiled.  They chatted casually, remarked on the beauty of the golf course, commented on  the new playground being arranged for the children of the town and finally  arrived at headquarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; and Coles took an envelope from  his desk. &ldquo;Do you want to take it away with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, thanks. I just want to see how it compares with  this one. Pretty close, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone took an envelope from his pocket, and from it took  another envelope, which, on being compared proved to be exactly like the one  Coles had handed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; exclaimed Lieutenant Browning. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get  that. They&rsquo;re just alike!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost,&rdquo; Stone said; &ldquo;A trifle different weight, I  think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He restored his envelope to its encasing envelope and put  both in his pocket, handing the other envelope back to Coles.</p>
<p>Both policemen looked disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secrets, Mr. Stone?&rdquo; asked Browning, smiling good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly. But experiments. Not yet ripe for  publication. I shall be at the Inn for a time,  and glad to see you whenever you choose to come over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to rejoin the yacht, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Mr. Murray will not, I feel sure. If Mrs. Murray  recovers, they will come back home, I think, and if&mdash; if she does not get well,  the cruise will be abandoned and they will all come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think Mrs. Murray will live, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Browning  asked, solicitously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, and I do think so; but she is a very ill woman,  and it is a dreadful case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what is the disease?&rdquo; Coles inquired, interestedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not yet sure. You know of siriasis, of course,  Doctor Coles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a very exaggerated form of sunburn or sunstroke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly; and Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s illness is undoubtedly  something of that sort. With possibly, other complications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; the sympathetic Browning went on, &ldquo;she is  a lovely lady, and Leif Murray is an all-round fine chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may stop the progress of the ailment at the  hospital,&rdquo; Stone said, hopefully, &ldquo;but it is a very serious illness. Though I  am of an optimistic nature, I can scarcely say I look for Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s  recovery. But please don&rsquo;t quote me as saying that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone felt anxious and restless and wanted to be doing  something. He had many ideas to examine into, many possibilities to consider,  and he was eager to be alone and get started on these things.</p>
<p>So he took leave and went back to the Inn,  wondering a little why the two policemen seemed less cordial and kindly to him  than before.</p>
<p>Once up on the little balcony on which the French windows  of his study opened, he drew a long breath, and leaned back in his wicker porch  chair, enjoying the cool breeze and the hilly treesy landscape.</p>
<p>He let his thoughts run riot. He allowed his imagination  to suggest possibilities that he discarded next moment as being beyond all  reason only to take them back again for further consideration.</p>
<p>He had thoughts that were so absurd he almost laughed at  them, and the next instant gravely assured himself that they might be true.</p>
<p>He was not dallying with foolish ideas, he was seriously  considering the astounding possibilities and realizing that he had them or  would have them to cope with.</p>
<p>His telephone bell rang and when he heard Antony Ballard&rsquo;s  voice he was eager for his message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our patient is about the same,&rdquo; Ballard told him. &ldquo;I know  that is an unsatisfactory bulletin, but it&rsquo;s all I can say. The hospital  doctors are deeply interested, of course, and they are studying the strange case.  For they admit it is strange to them and very mystifying. Today, Isabel is  quiet and calm. Stuporous much of the time, and when awake, flighty and  rambling. Her poor face grows worse, and it is not, to me, a hopeful outlook. I  try to cheer up Leif, poor fellow, he is so amenable to a grain of  encouragement. I am not in our hotel now, I came outside to telephone, so he  shouldn&rsquo;t hear me. Tonka is a brick, keeping up her own spirits for Leif&rsquo;s  sake. I have telephoned to Giles Trumbull and Elaine. They are trying to enjoy  their yacht trip and there is no reason why they should not. They can do  nothing for Isabel or for Leif. So they may as well have a good time. Elaine is  deeply saddened, but that flibbertigibbet, Fleda, is gay and festive, from all  I can gather. I will keep you posted, and if I call when you aren&rsquo;t available  I&rsquo;ll leave a message as to Isabel&rsquo;s progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine reporter, Ballard, thank you. Now I wish  you&rsquo;d do something for me. Send me all the word you can, by telephone or by  mail as to the doctors&rsquo; decisions or opinions as to the nature of Isabel&rsquo;s  illness. If too troublesome or if you can&rsquo;t relate the medical terms, get one  of the hospital men to do it. Some young interne, not very busy, might like to  do me that kindness. And if it&rsquo;s professional in any way, pay the shot and I&rsquo;ll  square you. I don&rsquo;t want opinions and presumptions, but if they come out  flat-footed with a definite statement of the name or nature of the disease,  you&rsquo;ve no idea how I&rsquo;d be grateful to hear of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Stone; and if I can&rsquo;t hit on the right one,  I&rsquo;ll have Tonka write it out for you. Dear girl, she has nothing to do. She&rsquo;s  not keen on the jamborees down here, and she&rsquo;s not allowed to see Isabel often  or long. She will be glad to do that business for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but tell her to omit all argument or  unauthorized statements and just give me the best conclusions of the best  brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballard agreed, and after a few more words of sympathy and  cheer, they said good-by.</p>
<p>It was lunch time then, and Stone had a tray sent up to  his balcony, where he could continue his cogitations.</p>
<p>He had learned no exact information from Ballard, but he  had asked for the conclusions of the wise men and he hoped for some real and  true instruction in the near future. But hoping and wondering palled, and he  wanted action.</p>
<p>He concluded to go into Paley&rsquo;s room and scout about. He  told Kenton of this desire and he was given the key, which Paley had left at  the desk the last time he left the Inn. </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t be anything to look for, if he left his key behind,  Stone mused, as he went back upstairs with his trophy.</p>
<p>He unlocked Paley&rsquo;s door and went in.</p>
<p>The room was messy and untidy. Elimination was sadly  needed.</p>
<p>The caretakers had done their work all right. Everything  belonging to the Inn was clean and neat. But  Paley&rsquo;s personal belongings were here and there, and Stone felt sure it was so  because he had forbidden the maids to put them away.</p>
<p>Stone took little interest in golf clubs and tennis  rackets. Or in fishhooks and lines. But the open desk and the litter of papers  drew his attention like a magnet.</p>
<p>He sat down and looked them over.</p>
<p>But he found absolutely nothing that meant anything to him  in any way.</p>
<p>Unpaid bills, uncashed checks, unopened letters, all went  to prove Paley&rsquo;s careless and heedless ways.</p>
<p>In a small box were two or three stamps torn from  envelopes, probably because of their real or supposed philatelic value.</p>
<p>No notes from anyone he knew; no memoranda of anything he  wanted to know about; no hint of where he had gone or when he would be back.</p>
<p>And yet Stone had a notion of where Paley had gone. Not  from anything he found, rather from something he did not find. And he felt  fairly sure that Humbert Paley had no intention of ever stepping his foot  inside the door of Van Winkle Inn again.</p>
<p>The papers on the desk bored him. Even the checkbooks,  though they showed sums now and then drawn to the order of some lady&rsquo;s name,  meant little to the detective.</p>
<p>He had a strong suspicion of Paley, but he could do  nothing about it until he saw Paul Tolman.</p>
<p>Sternly reproaching himself for being fidgetty, Stone  acknowledged to himself that he was, and he concluded to go over to the Golf  Club and have a round.</p>
<p>It proved a wise move, for he met up with a man he liked  to play with and they had a most exciting game. Moreover, the man didn&rsquo;t ask  him a single question about his work, his plans or his hope of success.</p>
<p>Even at the nineteenth hole as they discussed their own or  each other&rsquo;s skill, no reference was made to any phase of the Tolman case.</p>
<p>When Stone got back to the Inn,  he learned that Paul Tolman had arrived.</p>
<p>He sent an invitation for the newcomer to dine with him on  his balcony, and went to his shower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cozy place you&rsquo;ve got here,&rdquo; Tolman said later, after  greetings were said and the cocktails were arriving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, pleasant enough,&rdquo; Stone returned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how  much longer I shall stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depending on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; and Stone smiled at his guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remain in, then. I want you more than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Let&rsquo;s leave details till after dinner. Tell  me, how is your mother? Not ill, I trust, after her sad experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother is a trump. She&rsquo;s broken-hearted, of course, but  she makes a plucky effort to hide it, for the sake of her family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a married man, Mr. Tolman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am the sort of bacheolor generally called  confirmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind that oftenest gives way under pressure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be. Let the pressure come on and try. You&rsquo;ve  been on a cruise, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cruise, yes, but not a pleasure trip. You&rsquo;ve doubtless  heard of Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. Very dreadful. I&rsquo;m sorry for Murray, fine man,  very fine man. Elaine Vernon was with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; a beautiful woman and an entertaining companion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of that&mdash;yes, all of that. Where is she now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still on the yacht. The Murrays  stopped off at Atlantic City,  to have Mrs. Murray cared for, and the rest went on cruising. It seemed the  best plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I see. And the odd young lady, Miss&mdash;er, Mead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tonka, yes. A dear girl, though, as you say, odd. She  is with Mrs. Murray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally the waiters came to clear the table, and lighting  cigars the two men began their talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I say I want to retain your services, Mr. Stone,&rdquo;  Tolman started off, &ldquo;it is not entirely in the same way I meant at first. I  find I have been mistaken in some things and I want to get straightened out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree to that, and I want to stipulate that if I remain  in your service, we must be frank with one another. This does not mean that we  must tell each other everything we know or think we know. But we must not let  the other remain under a delusion if we can correct it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tolman looked a trifle uncertain. He was an outspoken man,  but Stone felt sure that if he preferred to hold back some item of information,  he would do so, even if he had promised not to.</p>
<p>Moreover, when roused, he became choleric and sometimes  profane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Stone, damme, no! I don&rsquo;t subscribe to that <i>in  toto</i>. I sure do not. You ask me to agree to tell you anything I may know about  my brother&rsquo;s affairs! Well, I&rsquo;m damned if I do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to, Mr. Tolman. Don&rsquo;t take it so hard. If  you prefer to have it that way, all right. To be plain with you, I don&rsquo;t care  whether you retain me or not. I&rsquo;m going on with this Tolman murder on my own.  For it is murder. I have consulted the highest authorities in this country, and  I am convinced that your brother did not die from the prussic acid contained in  the peach kernels he ate. Somebody&mdash;someone who desired the death of your  brother gave him a dose of prussic acid to kill him; banking on the belief that  thus his death would be attributed to the peach pits, as it was. Now, the  question is, who wanted Peter Tolman&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one person on this green earth, Humbert Paley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this is one of the matters I didn&rsquo;t propose to tell  you. But there&rsquo;s devil&rsquo;s business going on, and I think it wiser to let you  know. I have all Peter&rsquo;s papers, except what Paley stole, damn him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make such statements in public, Mr. Tolman. They  might easily get you into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear. I make no statements that I do not know to be  true. I know Paley took special papers from Peter&rsquo;s desk before I got here last  week. I know that he took them because they are important to the business he  and my brother were engaged in. But he had no right to those papers. They are  necessary to the obtaining of a patent on Peter&rsquo;s invention. Now, Paley has no  interest in that invention except that he is putting some money into it. That  was necessary for Pete, as he hadn&rsquo;t enough money of his own to commercialize  the thing. Paley isn&rsquo;t a rich man, but he has rich friends and a persuasive way  with him. So he thought he could collect some sponsors for the thing, and then  they&rsquo;d rush the patent through and slam the finished product on the market. All  that was good, devilish good. But, poor Peter dies, and what does Paley do?  Grabs up all Pete&rsquo;s papers, and disappears. Gone down south or out west or up  into Canada  or Lord knows where, to patent the thing himself and have all the profits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much of your tirade is founded on fact and how much  is fairy tale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tolman looked at Stone sharply, then broke into a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I leave it to you, Mr. Stone. Isn&rsquo;t there a pretty  plain signboard pointing to the undeniable facts that Paley has the necessary  papers to get out the patent rights, and&mdash;Paley has disappeared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds convincing, the way you put it. Would it help you,  if you had Paley here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it help! Don&rsquo;t tease me, Mr. Stone. Why, if we had  Paley here, we&rsquo;d tuck him safely into the electric chair, and my brother&rsquo;s  heirs could patent the invention themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me and my brother and my mother, we are his natural  heirs. Pete left no will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know he didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None has been found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Paley has it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, man! You don&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? If Paley had access to your brother&rsquo;s papers,  isn&rsquo;t a will the first thing he would take? Granting that is, it was not made  out in his favor. He would want to destroy it, as soon as possible, lest the  invention processes should pass out of his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I don&rsquo;t believe, if Pete did make a will, that  he left the invention to anybody. It was all in the air, you know. He and Paley  thought they could pull it off, but Pete was no angel to deal with, and they  probably came to blows over it. You know what the Mead girl said about their  quarrelsome words. Now, in business affairs, Paley was a far better man than  Pete, and after Paley found out all about the invention, and found out all the  details of Pete&rsquo;s plans, why not accept the chance offered and put Pete out of  his way by that very clever peach pit racket, and then go ahead with the  invention himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just why did he disappear? If he was clever enough to  kill your brother, why wouldn&rsquo;t he stay here and stand the gaff? Paley is not a  timid man. What was he afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid his plans wouldn&rsquo;t work so well as he hoped. It  took no bravery to kill a man the way he killed Pete. Just send him, or take to  him a few peach kernels, one of which had been provided with an extra dose of  the prussic poison. It was a fine idea. All in keeping with Pete&rsquo;s daily food,  as you may say. But I can readily see how Paley got scared afterward. Gosh! I  never murdered anybody, but if I did, I bet I&rsquo;d suffer the tortures of the  damned after it was over. Imagine the horrors of realizing you had ended a  human life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you had Paley here, it would help you to settle  the whole question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can produce him, if you want him so badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you joking? For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t play me for a  fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. I think I can hand him over to you in twenty-four  hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Tolman looked at him with dazed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it,&rdquo; he said, in a frightened whisper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  Fleming Stone Goes To It</b></h2>
<p>FLEMING STONE was not a magician.</p>
<p>He did not propose to pull Humbert Paley out of a silk  hat, nor yet materialize him from a bunch of ectoplasm.</p>
<p>He never forgot the delightful old story about the lost  horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I thort ef I wuz a horse, where wud I go? An&rsquo; I went  there and he had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, likewise, when Stone pondered on the disappearance of  Humbert Paley, he thought: Were I Paley, where would I go? and he went there.</p>
<p>He left Paul Tolman without further word. Tolman was his  employer, and he had said, &ldquo;Go to it.&rdquo; So Stone went to it.</p>
<p>He packed a small suitcase, left the Inn by a side door,  went to the beflowered and beclamshelled railroad station that was the pride of  Ingleside Heights,  and entrained for New York.</p>
<p>At the Grand Central Station he took a taxicab to the  Pennsylvania Station and ensconced himself in a Pullman  compartment.</p>
<p>And when he stepped off that train, he found himself among  the magnificent distances of Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>He took a room at the Mayflower Hotel, had a shower and a  breakfast and then set out to pick his particular needle out of the city&rsquo;s  haystack.</p>
<p>Now Fleming Stone was not a lunatic, he was entirely  rational in his procedure.</p>
<p>He knew that if he had in his possession the papers,  drawings and plans of a possibly salable invention, he would lose no time in  getting his patent applied for.</p>
<p>He assumed, confidently enough, that that was what Paley  had done. And he had.</p>
<p>It was more tricky than Stone had anticipated to find his  man.</p>
<p>He was sure Paley was clever enough to choose one of the  best patent office lawyers and follow his instructions to the letter.</p>
<p>This Paley had done and after three or four unsuccessful  attempts, Stone found the lawyer that Paley had employed.</p>
<p>The lawyer, Kinsey by name, listened to the story Stone  chose to tell him. The story was true in the main, but Stone refrained from the  use of the Tolman name, for he did not want to bring in that element if it  could be avoided.</p>
<p>But he did not go deeply into details, for he soon learned  from the lawyer that Mr. Paley had gone to the Patent Office that morning, and  in all likelihood was there right now.</p>
<p>Whereupon Stone left his new acquaintance and struck the  trail again.</p>
<p>After some maneuvers, he found the right room and tracked  Paley to his lair.</p>
<p>He walked right in upon his prey, saying; &ldquo;Hello, Paley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His prey looked up at him, smiled what seemed like a real  welcome and said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Stone. Can you wait just a minute? I&rsquo;ve only a bit  to finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost before he stopped speaking, Paley was rapidly  writing again, and Stone could see he was filling out blanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m in no hurry. Finish your job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paley nodded and went on writing.</p>
<p>Stone was a bit surprised. His quarry showed no trace of  embarrassment, no sign of nervousness, and the hand that held his fountain pen  was as steady as any hand can be.</p>
<p>Shortly, he reached the end of the page, read it over  carefully, signed his name and capping his pen replaced it in his breast  pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute more, and I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; he said, and with  a smiling nod at Stone he went through a door which closed after him.</p>
<p>Stone&rsquo;s heart gave a jump.</p>
<p>Had he found his man only to lose him? Would Paley return,  or wouldn&rsquo;t he?</p>
<p>Stone almost wished he had told Tolman he would try to get  his man; or, he hoped to bring him back. But, no; he had stated positively&mdash;</p>
<p>And then he was glad he had, for Paley reappeared, and  announced himself at Stone&rsquo;s service and what could they do to have some fun?</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, we&rsquo;ll get out of here,&rdquo; was the reply, and when  they reached the street, Stone said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come around to my place. It&rsquo;s only a step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once in Stone&rsquo;s room, with some pleasant-looking drinks  before them, Paley said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chasing me, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly that, Paley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seldom feel curiosity, but how did you know I would be  here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human nature is easy to read. You have a wish to patent a  device of some sort. You have all the necessary papers, drawings, documents and  such, where would you make tracks for but the Patent Office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By gum! You&rsquo;re a smart one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve been told. Now are you going to be a smart one  and go back with me to Ingle   Heights? Or otherwise?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otherwise, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, think again. In that case you&rsquo;ll be dragged out of  your lair by individuals far more formidable than I am. You know, those strong,  silent men who wear blue coats with shiny buttons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d set them on my trail? Oh, fie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re on it now. I&rsquo;m not certain, but I&rsquo;m almost sure I  was followed when I left the Ingle Dingle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sent you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to know, really? Then&mdash;don&rsquo;t faint&mdash;Paul Tolman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul Tolman! Then you bet I won&rsquo;t go back! He doesn&rsquo;t  love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no. But he&rsquo;s more likely to, if you go back and  have it out than if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something in that. Has he Pete&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how are you assuming all the plans and papers about  the invention are yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pete told me if anything happened to him for me to take  over all that business and the invention and anything I could get from it was  to be mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you that in writing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no. Peter had no thought of dropping off, and I  guess neither of us showed much business sense. As a matter of fact I hadn&rsquo;t  great faith in the invention anyway; but the Patent people seem impressed by  it. So I&rsquo;m going ahead with the application.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your own name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems so. I&rsquo;d hardly take out a patent in the name of  Peter Tolman&rsquo;s heirs and assigns, whoever they may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if Tolman left a will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. It would be the first looking ahead piece of  business he ever pulled off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he a lawyer whom he employed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he still in love with his ex-wife, Mrs. Vernon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was in love with her bank account. He was trying to  get her to finance his invention. But she wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. I don&rsquo;t know  whether he was in love with her aside from financially or not. He never spoke  of her to me, except to say that he still hoped to persuade her to put money  into the project.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the project?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, merely to patent, manufacture and market Pete&rsquo;s  invention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the invention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we electrical wizards don&rsquo;t give out our secrets on  demand. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you it was a gadget to attach or affix to a radio,  to help along its use and beauty. Should it appear in the market and should it  catch on, there&rsquo;s a fortune in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Pete gave me the goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Stone, I was just about to say I&rsquo;d go back  with you, but if you&rsquo;re going police, I&rsquo;m not sure I shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Paley, did you kill Peter Tolman, or have any  hand in his killing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone&rsquo;s experiences had taught him that when a man  looks you straight in the eye and makes a calm statement, with an air of  absolute veracity, he is not necessarily telling the truth. He had known fine,  upstanding men to state with dignity and quite evident integrity, the most  whopping falsehoods.</p>
<p>He believed this statement of Paley&rsquo;s, but not because it  was made in a voice that rang true, and with an air of simple sincerity, but  because circumstances, as he saw them, convinced him that though Paley might  have stolen the drawings and documents, he did not murder Tolman in order to do  so.</p>
<p>He had not forgotten Tonka&rsquo;s story of how Paley made a  veiled threat in his conversation with Tolman, but a host of little arguments  were against the idea of Paley&rsquo;s murderous intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come along. I&rsquo;m not concerned with you and your  patent applied for, but I promised Paul Tolman I&rsquo;d bring you to him within  twenty-four hours, and I&rsquo;d like to make good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you shall, if I can help. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how it came about that Fleming Stone and  Humbert Paley walked up the pathway of crazy pavement that led to Van Winkle  Inn.</p>
<p>And that Stone was well within the limits of his promised  time of arrival.</p>
<p>Paul Tolman greeted them on the front porch and the three went  up to Stone&rsquo;s pleasant study.</p>
<p>In a few words Stone explained the situation as it looked  to him, and then put it up to Tolman.</p>
<p>Paul looked at Paley with a searching gaze that gave no  hint of what he was thinking about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You intended to return?&rdquo; he asked, casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe and maybe not,&rdquo; Paley said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my way to do the  duty nearest by, as the poet puts it. Peter is gone. Peter&rsquo;s plans, which  included my own plans, are all in my hands. Peter was about to apply for patent  rights. Was it not up to me to make that application? If so, why delay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You intended to return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul Tolman was one of those annoying men who repeat a  question if it isn&rsquo;t answered.</p>
<p>But that didn&rsquo;t bother Paley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe and maybe not,&rdquo; he reiterated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If not, where were you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paley spoke pettishly. &ldquo;How do I know? I go about my  business, and one thing leads to another and I follow the leads. I don&rsquo;t plan  ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Mr. Paley, did you kill my brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paley looked at him. He didn&rsquo;t have exactly a twinkle in  his eye, but there was something very like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ll say no, but you want to see how I&rsquo;ll say  it? Well, Mr. Tolman, no, I did not kill your brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the same speech Paley had made to Stone, and said  in the same way.</p>
<p>Tolman shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may mean anything or nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;What are  you going to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humbert Paley stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, still staring.</p>
<p>Paul turned red, and fidgeted nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I was a bit crude,&rdquo; he said, an apologetic note  in his voice. &ldquo;I think the Headquarters people would like to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To ask me if I killed your brother? You tell them that I  didn&rsquo;t and that you know I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Paul sighed as if wearied with this  unaccustomed contest of words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know if Peter left a will?&rdquo; Paul resumed, as no  one else put up any conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; do you?&rdquo; Paley returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did, I shouldn&rsquo;t ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paley passed this bid, and Fleming Stone, a little bored,  rose, saying; &ldquo;I want to do some telephoning. Call me if you want me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went into his bedroom and closed the door.</p>
<p>He called up the hotel in Atlantic City, where Leif Murray was staying,  and was answered by Tonka.</p>
<p>She said Leif was over at the hospital, but she would  answer questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, how is Mrs. Murray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No better,&rdquo; Tonka said, sadly. &ldquo;Not much worse, but  growing steadily weaker. The eruptions on her face are spreading and are  endangering her eyes. She is sane only occasionally, and then her wonder and  astonishment at her surroundings are so pathetic, we are almost glad when she  again loses consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonka, do you think she will get well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Stone, I don&rsquo;t. Leif has not given up hope. He is  trying hard to believe she will recover, but it is a false hope. We don&rsquo;t  discuss that point. I try to talk of other things, and sometimes I go over  little incidents in their past life, it somehow rouses him a bit, but mostly he  sits alone, looking so depressed and downcast it is pitiful to see him. Antony is still with us,  and he is a tower of strength. I don&rsquo;t know where Leif would be without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you hear from the people on the yacht?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re still cruising about. Not far from land, so they  can telephone often. Elaine is dear and sends loving messages. But Fleda talks  to us seldom. I don&rsquo;t believe she ever thinks of Isabel unless somebody reminds  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go now,&rdquo; Stone said; &ldquo;Hark, Tonka. Have notes made  of everything Isabel says when she is rational. Don&rsquo;t skip a word. This is far  more important than you have any idea of. But you must take my word for that,  and keep the record carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Mr. Stone. I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t tell Leif&mdash;don&rsquo;t tell anyone that you are doing  this. If anybody knows of it at all, don&rsquo;t say how important it is, or how  interested I am in it. Remember, Tonka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will remember, Mr. Stone. You can trust me to the last  ditch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can. Tonka, I suppose all of Isabel&rsquo;s  belongings were left on the yacht?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, except the few things I packed up and brought over  here. I brought a street gown and hat, in case they cured her all up. Such  things I have with me here at the hotel. Only a few personal things went with  her to the hospital. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much. See that everything of hers is taken care  of after&mdash;Tonka, do the doctors say how long she can hold out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. They don&rsquo;t like to say anything. And  different ones say different things. The nurses won&rsquo;t say a word. Of course  they are forbidden to. But Isabel can&rsquo;t last much longer. She gets worse so  rapidly. I hear Leif&rsquo;s step in the hall. Better say good-by, unless you want to  speak to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not now. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>Stone went back to his study.</p>
<p>He found Tolman and Paley eagerly arguing about something  that did not seem at all connected with the question of Peter&rsquo;s murderer, if  any.</p>
<p>They stopped talking abruptly at his appearance, but he  cared little to know the reason why. His thoughts were now with the dying woman  in the hospital.</p>
<p>He told them somewhat of the news Tonka had given him, and  said, &ldquo;I suppose Tolman, as I am in your employ now, I should ask your sanction,  but I want very much to go down to Atlantic City for a few hours, and I don&rsquo;t  see how that can inconvenience you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Mr. Stone. Go right along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean tonight. Say, tomorrow or day after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suit yourself. I want you to find the murderer of my  brother. I know you will bend all your energies to that and if you are  attending to other matters at the same time, it is not my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Tolman; that&rsquo;s man&rsquo;s talk,&rdquo; and Paley  grinned his appreciation. &ldquo;But, Stone, don&rsquo;t desert the ship. Won&rsquo;t Coles  reopen the inquest? Don&rsquo;t you want to be here for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If and when the inquest is taken up again, I&rsquo;ll be on  hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three separated then, and though they met again at  dinner time, they spoke no word of wills or inventions or inquests.</p>
<p>After dinner Stone strolled over the ups and downs of the  village streets until he came to Elaine Vernon&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Uncertain whether there was anyone staying there or not,  he rang the doorbell and was answered by a tidy, white aproned cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vernon is not at home, sir,&rdquo; she said, courteously,  and waited for Stone to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you remember me? I&rsquo;ve been  here before. Mr. Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir. What is it you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am on an errand for Mrs. Vernon. She asked me to get a letter  for her from her desk. The desk in the living-room, not the desk in her  boudoir. Will you help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Jamison had pretty strict orders regarding men who  called in her mistress&rsquo; absence, but she knew Fleming Stone for the great  detective and she no more thought of objecting than if it had been the Chief of  Police himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir&rdquo;; and she led him to the pretty desk in the  large living-room.</p>
<p>Stone looked over the pigeon holes, opened the drawers and  showed disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No letters here at all,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Only blank paper and  envelopes. I don&rsquo;t want to intrude on her private papers, but she was most  anxious I should find the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come along upstairs to her boodore, sir. It might be  there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went up and the desk in question was not only  unlocked but open.</p>
<p>No better success, however. No letters were in sight, and  the neatly arranged stationery was the same as that downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Stone said, as Mrs. Jamison offered to unlock some  of the drawers, &ldquo;Mrs. Vernon said it would be right out in sight. A plain  envelope addressed to her and bearing a New    York postmark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave up the quest, thanked Mrs. Jamison for her  assistance and said he would report to Mrs. Vernon and get her further advice.</p>
<p>Then he went over to Longacre.</p>
<p>There he found Mrs. Mendel in charge and glad to see him,  as she longed for definite news of her loved Mrs. Murray.</p>
<p>Stone told her many things that he knew would interest  her, though not disclosing how very ill Isabel really was.</p>
<p>Then he dismissed her, saying he wanted to look for a book  in the library.</p>
<p>She went off to her own quarters and Stone looked over the  books on the shelves somewhat, and then turned his attention to the desk.</p>
<p>As always it was the acme of tidiness; there was paper of  various sizes, paper with Longacre at its top, another kind that showed a tiny  telephone and railway, another kind that had the address of the Yacht Club and  a picture of the Terpsichore, and another kind entirely plain.</p>
<p>Stone glanced them over, put two or three sheets of the  paper in his pocket, with matching envelopes, turned back to the bookshelves  again, and finally, seeming satisfied, pushed the bell that would bring Mrs. Mendel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything going all right?&rdquo; he inquired, kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Mrs. Mendel sniffed, &ldquo;except I&rsquo;m that worried  about my dear lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Mendel, we&rsquo;re all anxious about her. Mr. Murray  is trying to bear up, and Miss Tonka is, of course, a great help and comfort to  him. But, though Mrs. Murray is of course very ill, while there is life there  is always hope, and we must just keep on hoping. I&rsquo;m going now. I suppose they will let you know if&mdash;if anything happens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Miss Tonka keeps me posted. Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone went away feeling a little bewildered. Some bits of  what had seemed to him important evidence were crumbling to nothing before his  eyes.</p>
<p>Some facts on which he was confidently building a most  likely theory turned out to be no facts at all.</p>
<p>He went back to the Inn,  in the soft summer dusk, wondering why he ever had supposed he had detective  instinct. If he had any instinct at all it was merely an imperative urge to  make mistakes!</p>
<p>Up on his own little balcony he tried to straighten out  things. Only with the result of a much greater degree of physical comfort, but  also a much greater degree of mental discomfort, discord and distress.</p>
<p>How reconcile the amazing contradictions he had run into  today? How make his firm belief in Paley&rsquo;s innocence in the matter of Tolman&rsquo;s  death gee with the obvious method and opportunity Paley had had. Why paint  Paley white so suddenly and so emphatically?</p>
<p>He sat listening to the various sounds that haunt the  trees in the late hours of an August night.</p>
<p>Then his telephone bell intruded upon the softer voices,  and he went inside to answer it.</p>
<p>It was Ballard, calling from Atlantic City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isabel is worse,&rdquo; Ballard said; &ldquo;much worse. She is  failing rapidly, and the doctors think the end is very near. I wonder if you  would come down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right away? Now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Can&rsquo;t you fly down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it urgent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure do. Come along, Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Be there soon&rsquo;s I can make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  Doctor Mason Spurns Rays</b></h2>
<p>STONE reached Atlantic    City early next morning. He telephoned the hospital  first, and learned that Mrs. Murray was still alive, though unconscious.</p>
<p>Then he went straight to the hotel and had breakfast with  his friends there.</p>
<p>He felt a formal question would be easier for Leif to  answer than a sympathetic remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there hope of Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s recovery?&rdquo; he asked. Leif  maintained a composed air, but his twitching fingers showed nervousness and  dark shadows under his eyes told of a night of wakeful anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, quietly, &ldquo;they tell me she will probably  not recover full consciousness again, but will sink into a final coma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The measured, even staccato sounds betokened the struggle  the man was making to speak at all, and Fleming Stone forbore to continue the  subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I do anything for you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in New York or at your home?  I am returning this afternoon or tonight, but I have time for any errands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Leif, blankly; &ldquo;no, I think of nothing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do something for me,&rdquo; Tonka said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you  a note for Mrs. Mendel, and I&rsquo;d like you to take it to her yourself. Just a  list of things I want her to look after. And she&rsquo;ll be glad to have you see her  personally and tell her about Isabel. Am I asking too much of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. I&rsquo;ll gladly do any errands I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Leif, suddenly. &ldquo;Look after this then,  will you? Of course, we&rsquo;ll stay right here until the end. Then we&rsquo;ll go right  home, taking Isabel with us. Motor up, most likely. Can you see to it that no  account or story of Isabel&rsquo;s illness and death is put in the local papers,  without my seeing it first, or seeing a proof. I don&rsquo;t mean merely a notice,  Ballard will see to those in the New    York papers and the locals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. Yes, I&rsquo;ll see the local editors myself, and  make sure they understand. Are you going over to the hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until later,&rdquo; Leif said; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll telephone me of the  slightest change, and the waiting room over there is too ghastly. A private  room to wait in is no better. The whole atmosphere of the place gets on my  nerves and the odors and sounds are so suggestive that I want to scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. It&rsquo;s awful. Is Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s mind clear, when she  is conscious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. She says the wildest things. That breaks me all  up, too. I&rsquo;m not an emotional man and I&rsquo;m not ordinarily a nervous sort, but  this illness of my wife&rsquo;s takes the very life out of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at that. You&rsquo;re going through a dreadful  ordeal. I can only hope that she will not suffer&mdash;at the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. The doctor says she will pass away in a  coma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope it will be soon,&rdquo; Tonka declared. &ldquo;It will  wear Leif out if this horror goes on much longer. I love Isabel, she has been a  perfect angel to me for years, but the suspense is wearing on us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone looked at the girl with a new interest. He had never  before heard her speak so complainingly or with such apparent callousness.</p>
<p>Leif paid no attention to Tonka, or to anyone. He  continued to look out the window with what was evidently an unseeing gaze.</p>
<p>Stone was not surprised, for men do not show their deepest  feelings before other men.</p>
<p>Antony Ballard rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going over to the hospital,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Want to come  along, Stone? It may be your last chance to see Isabel alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone was shocked at the casual way they all referred to  Isabel&rsquo;s approaching death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telephone back as soon as you have seen Isabel,&rdquo; Leif  said to Ballard. &ldquo;No matter if there&rsquo;s no change, telephone anyway. I&rsquo;ll be  waiting here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Antony  told him, and he and Stone went off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be surprised at Leif&rsquo;s queerness,&rdquo; Ballard said to  Stone, as they walked along. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never had any serious trouble in his life  and he doesn&rsquo;t quite know how to take it. He tries so hard to be brave and  courageous that he overdoes it a little. If he&rsquo;d let himself go, it&rsquo;d be better  for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too. Or if he could do anything for her. It&rsquo;s  this sense of helplessness that gets on the nerves. Of course Murray wants no diversion or entertainment,  and so he just has to endure. I incline to Tonka&rsquo;s wish that the end may come  soon. Is Leif fond of Tonka?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No romance. He has always rather disliked her, and she  ignored him. But his trouble has stirred her sympathy and she is sorry for  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s more than sorry for him. She&rsquo;s in love with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe. But Leif scarcely sees her. Of course she  can&rsquo;t live with him now, and he&rsquo;ll be glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We speak as if Isabel were already dead, but I suppose  there is really no slightest hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, none.&rdquo; They turned in at the hospital gate. &ldquo;Do you  want to see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. And I want to see her doctor and her nurses. I  may stay here some time. In fact, Ballard, I want to find out what she died of,  if possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, we&rsquo;ll go up to her room, and then I&rsquo;ll go  and telephone Leif, and you carry on in your own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse in charge was a middle-aged, capable looking  Miss Galton, who was willing they should come in if they would make no noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if a fire-cracker would waken her,&rdquo; the nurse  said, &ldquo;but I have my orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he not been warned, Fleming Stone might have voiced an  exclamation when he looked at the dying woman. It was scarcely possible to  realize it was Isabel, so changed was she.</p>
<p>She lay with the left side of her face up. It was covered  with blotches of crimson and purple, and unsightly ulcers. The hair was gone  from that side of her head and she was so wasted that it seemed they were  looking at a bare skull.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone showed no repugnance, but deep interest. He  looked at the poor distorted countenance intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t let her husband see her looking like this?&rdquo; he  said to the nurse, in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;He insists upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballard had gone off to telephone and Stone took Miss  Galton&rsquo;s arm and led her behind a screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;what is she dying of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse was not of kindly or even courteous nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; she snapped, though not speaking  loudly. &ldquo;Every doctor gives it a different name. When they can&rsquo;t think of a new  name, they make one up. Who knows the truth? I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suspect it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him with a frightened face. Her eyes were  staring and her lip trembled as she said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean! Suspect what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone ignored her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do the doctors call it?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;tell me  quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a doctor entered the room, and quite calmly Miss  Galton moved the screen, stepped forward and introduced Stone to Doctor Mason.</p>
<p>Pomposity was Mason&rsquo;s most obvious characteristic, and as  he showed with it an occasional touch of would-be humor, he was, naturally a  most unpleasing person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr. Stone, the deteck-a-tuf? We are honored to have you beneath our roof. And glad you could  come without any assistance, wheeled chair, stretcher, not even a crutch, I  see.&rdquo; The man gave a smirk, which made Stone his enemy for life, and then went  on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a friend of our Mrs. Murray? Poor, dear lady,  what a pity! What a pity is her hard lot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mason was a physician of the highest reputation and was  famous all over the country for his skill and knowledge. But he had an  unfortunate manner and when a trifle embarrassed talked at random.</p>
<p>Stone paid no attention to this, his chance had come and  he took it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Mason,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a detective may discover lots of  things not noticed by the average onlooker, but he cannot deduce a fact by a  science of which he knows nothing. I am here to learn the nature of Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s  illness, and I am glad that I may make application for that knowledge to the  highest source of information in this institute, if not, indeed, in the whole  medical profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do me too much honor, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; and now Mason spoke  more practically. &ldquo;I will be frank. You say you wish to know the nature of this  peculiar illness. That I can tell you, the nature of it, yes. It is of the  nature of meningitis, of pellagra, of siriasis, of cancer&mdash;yet it is no one of  these things. We are, as yet, not entirely certain what to call this dread  disease, this fearful scourge. We wish we knew. Could you, perhaps, help us, Mr.  Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m sorry, but such things are outside my field. You  hope to save your patient&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret to say we cannot hope that. Unless some miracle  occurs, I see no way to look for the patient&rsquo;s recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have, of course, considered and rejected all  thoughts of&mdash;er&mdash;what do you call &rsquo;em? Rays, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rays,&rdquo; Doctor Mason returned to his supercilious attitude  and his ironic tone. &ldquo;I suppose you are hinting at ultra-violet rays or  something of the sort, and you are not more explicit because, as you yourself  remarked, such a subject lies in a field of science of which you know nothing.  May I suggest, Mr. Stone, that you confine your efforts to the clever  deductions you are so adroit at making and refrain from dabbling in matters of  which you have only a crass ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech and its accompanying scornful glance, roused  Stone&rsquo;s ire and he returned it in kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may suggest it, certainly, Doctor Mason, but I am not  at all in the habit of following suggestions. They seldom appeal to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sound from the invalid caused the doctor to step over to  the bed, and Fleming Stone did the same.</p>
<p>Isabel opened her lovely blue eyes, as yet unharmed by the  rapidly encroaching eruptions, and looked straight at the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Mason,&rdquo; she said, in a voice seemingly both  conscious and sane, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think Leif cares for her, do you? No, I know you  don&rsquo;t. Dear Leif, he cares for nobody but me. His blessing&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he calls  me, his blessing. Dear Leif.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Her lifted head fell back on the pillow, the blue eyes  closed and Isabel breathed softly again.</p>
<p>Miss Galton spoke. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been saying that all day. A  dozen times she&rsquo;s asked me if her husband cared for anyone else. I told her no,  and she&rsquo;d drop right off to sleep again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Isabel had turned a little and her face showed  the right side now, which was almost without a blemish.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone had a question he greatly desired to put to  the doctor, but he deemed it would be an unwise gesture and he didn&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>Ballard came back to the room, and started in surprise as  he saw Isabel looking so lovely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to call Leif and Tonka over,&rdquo; he said, starting  for the door, &ldquo;she may never look so like herself again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She probably will not,&rdquo; Mason assured him, and then went  out to the hall with him.</p>
<p>Once outside the doctor whispered to Ballard;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me now as if she would not sink into a coma,  but she may die any minute. Get her husband and Miss Mead over, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballard called at once and Tonka answered.</p>
<p>He said for them to come over, because of Isabel&rsquo;s  appearance, and they came at once.</p>
<p>When Tonka saw Isabel her bravery gave way at last and she  had a violent crying spell. Miss Galton took her in the next room, which  belonged to the suite, and soothed her back to quietude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looks s-so lovely,&rdquo; Tonka sobbed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want her  to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t break down now,&rdquo; Nurse Galton said; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been so  fine, and too, you must keep for Mr. Murray&rsquo;s sake. He depends on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he does,&rdquo; and Tonka roused herself to duty.</p>
<p>She bathed her eyes, fixed up her pale face and went back  to the bedside.</p>
<p>Leif was standing by, gazing at Isabel, who lay asleep.</p>
<p>Suddenly she woke, sat straight up in the bed and looked  at Leif.</p>
<p>She leaned forward and peered at him, as if her eyesight  were failing, and then said, in a clear ringing voice;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of it! After years of devotion, to murder me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sank back on the pillow, gave one short gasp and died.</p>
<p>Doctor Mason, who had seen it coming, stepped forward,  felt for her heart and her pulse, and then, unable to restrain his pompous manner,  he said, as one announcing the death of a queen;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great lady is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Nurse Galton who hastened to the bedside and turned  Isabel&rsquo;s head until the scarred cheek was hidden, and then looked toward Leif  Murray.</p>
<p>He was still standing where he had taken his position on  entering the room. He was looking at Isabel, with a strange expression in his  eyes.</p>
<p>Galton feared a collapse of some sort and she moved a  chair to him and urged him to sit down.</p>
<p>Leif did so with the air of a man who does not know what  he is doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother Leif,&rdquo; Tonka said, quietly; &ldquo;Mr. Ballard and  I will look after things. Mr. Stone, shall we see you again before you go  back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will, please,&rdquo; Stone said, gently. &ldquo;Unless I can  do anything for you, I will go now, and I&rsquo;ll come round to your hotel about  five o&rsquo;clock, shall I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you want me to do some wiring? Let me tell the  people on the yacht, and notify any you want me to at Ingle Heights.  Ballard will have enough to do. How shall I tell Trumbull and Elaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him a Cape May  call that would reach them, and some other addresses for him to notify.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay here longer than you can spare the time,&rdquo; she  said; &ldquo;you are good help, but I know you&rsquo;re awfully busy, and Leif will be all  right soon. I know him so well, you see, and I know how he takes a knock-down  blow. He is all in, at first, then he rises to the occasion and is just fine.  Afterward, when he&rsquo;s alone he probably goes to pieces again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to these messages,&rdquo; Stone told her, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll  see you sooner than I said. About two, or three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to the hotel about three,&rdquo; Tonka said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not be  having a regular luncheon, but come around anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone agreed and went his way.</p>
<p>And his way took him through a hall, in one of whose  doorways a young looking doctor lay in wait for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; the young man said, laying his hand on  Stone&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t I speak to you a minute? It&rsquo;s very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, you can,&rdquo; Stone smiled into the earnest,  pleading face. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m on a most important errand. Maybe an hour, or  three-quarters. Where can I find you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here. But I&rsquo;ll meet you wherever you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it noon. Where&rsquo;s a quiet lunch place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Arab Tent, on Seaweed Avenue. It isn&rsquo;t a tent, really,  you know, and it&rsquo;s all right. And my name Is Doctor Horner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Horner, I&rsquo;ll be there at noon. You know Mrs. Murray  died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s why I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much mystified, Stone hurried away to attend to Tonka&rsquo;s  errands.</p>
<p>It took more time than he had expected, to get the various  long distance calls, but he managed them all and was at the tryst on the  minute.</p>
<p>Doctor Horner was waiting for him and took him to a cozy  alcove where they could be alone.</p>
<p>They made short work of giving their orders, and Horner  eagerly began to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think Mrs. Murray died of?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I wish  you&rsquo;d tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew. But how come a hospital doctor asks a  layman such a question as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of the hospital doctors knows what she died of; or  if they do they won&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that an odd state of things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very odd. And if you don&rsquo;t know, there&rsquo;s no use pursuing  the subject.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Doctor Horner looked so disappointed that Stone tried to  help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have something in your mind,&rdquo; he said, gravely,  looking at Horner. &ldquo;I imagine you think you know what killed Mrs. Murray. I  fancy you suggested it to the heads, and they turned you down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horner stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything to make you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word. But I had a similar experience myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now? In the hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Want me to tell you about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened this morning,&rdquo; Stone began; &ldquo;just before I  left the hospital. I was mistakenly trying to learn Doctor Mason&rsquo;s ideas on the  subject and he snubbed me with a right good will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say to him that stirred him up so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him if it could have been rays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he said?&rdquo; Horner looked eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he assumed I meant ultra-violet rays, and he  asked what I meant by speaking of a subject of which I was crassly ignorant. I  didn&rsquo;t exactly mean ultra-violet rays, I&rsquo;m not at all particular about the  color, but I meant X-rays, a subject on which I <i>am</i> really crassly ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that word crass, it makes you feel like the scum of  the earth, when it&rsquo;s handed out to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always felt that way, too,&rdquo; Stone agreed. &ldquo;Now, tell  me. Could X-rays, used <i>ad lib</i>., bring  about such conditions as Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s case showed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I had the temerity to hint, and I received proper  whackings same like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is such a diagnosis so unwelcome to the powers that  be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but probably because all that Roentgen  business, and the psychology which follows in its train are outside the  consideration of the old-time savants who recognize nothing more subtle than  chills and fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you see a possibility?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, and that&rsquo;s what I wanted to talk to you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d like nothing better than a good long confab. But  I&rsquo;m too tied up with engagements for that, so let&rsquo;s get to it, and do all we  can in this hour. You have a definite knowledge of the possibility of an X-ray  treatment causing this death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a definite knowledge that it could do so, but I  know too little of the circumstances to speak authoritatively about it. Could Mrs.  Murray have received such treatment, about&mdash;well, say, about three or four weeks  ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know. But of course I can find out when I go  back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can only say that you&rsquo;d better look into the  matter. All the tentative decisions of our best physicians have omitted any  hint of X-rays. I may be all wrong, but at any rate, I hope you&rsquo;ll put it up to  some New York  medical experts and&mdash;may I ask you to let me know your results?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall, of course, do as you suggest and I shall be glad  to let you know anything I find out. You mean, I take it, that Mrs. Murray, for  some ailment was given an X-ray treatment, and it proved too much for her, and brought  about her fearful illness and death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean, even though put into language it sounds  a highly improbable suggestion. But that&rsquo;s what you had in mind, before I spoke  to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. I don&rsquo;t know where I got the notion. But her  terrible symptoms seemed to me somehow like what I&rsquo;ve heard or read about  X-rays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can find out, can&rsquo;t you, if she had a series of X-ray  treatments for any disorder? I&rsquo;m sure it would need a series of them to bring  about such a desperate case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it would be an easy matter to find that  out. Her local doctor would know, and of course Mr. Murray and Miss Mead would  know. There could be no reason for concealing such a thing. I&rsquo;m glad you spoke  of this to me. I planned to make inquiries on my return to New York. I go about it now with a better  assurance. But I must be very discreet. And I trust you will not feel it  necessary to tell of this conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. I am only too glad to have met you to disregard  your wishes in any way. Here is my card, and if I can be of the slightest help,  let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone&rsquo;s time was up and he had to go.</p>
<p>He went straight to the hotel and to the Murray suite. He reported his sendings of  telegrams and telephones, and said he would start for New York at once, and asked their plans.</p>
<p>Tonka replied that they were waiting for further word from  the hospital, but would probably go home by motor the next day.</p>
<p>Leif was calmer and less nervous, and made plans, which  Tonka and Antony Ballard carried out.</p>
<p>Casually, among other things, Stone asked if Isabel had  been recently subjected to X-ray treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy no!&rdquo; Tonka cried. &ldquo;She hated such things. She had  to have her teeth X-rayed once, and she nearly went wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Leif corroborated. &ldquo;Isabel never had an illness that  called for such treatments, and she wouldn&rsquo;t have consented to them anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the doctors give a certificate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tonka said. &ldquo;They said death was caused by cerebral  edema and necrosis.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  Are The Two Murders Connected?</b></h2>
<p>STONE went back to New    York by train. He sat in a club car and gave himself  over to thinking about Isabel Murray and her dreadful death.</p>
<p>He came on the yacht trip because he had a vague suspicion  of some secret reasons for her strange illness, and he couldn&rsquo;t rid himself of  a dim, grim notion of foul play.</p>
<p>But though he had been alert and unwearying in his keen  scrutiny while on board, he was able to find no slightest hint of any sort of  wrong doing on the part of anyone present.</p>
<p>Moreover, they were all friends of Isabel and all showed  love and affection for her.</p>
<p>True, she was a little trying at times, but as Tonka said,  who wouldn&rsquo;t be, with such a stiff ordeal as Isabel was going through? Her  ailment, whatever it was, was annoying and irritating, if not actually painful.  The last day or two on board, she had been very ill in body and flighty of  mind.</p>
<p>They took her to the hospital none too soon, though the  doctors said they could not have saved her life had she arrived sooner.</p>
<p>Stone had a conviction that somebody was to blame for the  tragedy, but as he could get no similar opinion from any doctor there, he began  to feel that he might well be mistaken. If so, the matter was out of his hands  and he had no further concern with it. And, in fact, if Horner hadn&rsquo;t stopped  him and asked him about it, he would never have queried the hospital doctors&rsquo;  decision.</p>
<p>Stone sometimes played his hunches, but not when it was a  matter of life and death, and concerned a matter entirely within the knowledge  and experience of the most learned members of the medical profession.</p>
<p>Doctor Horner&rsquo;s taking up the question decidedly changed  Stone&rsquo;s viewpoint, and he began to rearrange his thoughts.</p>
<p>Horner was a young man, but by no means to be ignored for  that reason.</p>
<p>He was up to the minute cognizant of all new discoveries,  experiments or theories.</p>
<p>So, granting Horner&rsquo;s right to say what he had said, Stone  began to cast about for a possible murderer.</p>
<p>He did not do this happily; he was not the sort of  detective who revels in the new problem just for the experience. He had become  fond of the Murray  family, and he liked their guests. He could not conceive of any of them guilty  of murder, and he at once concluded that the murderer was not on board the yacht.</p>
<p>That was what he had gone to find out, and he felt sure  the answer was negative. He felt fairly well acquainted with all the party,  unless perhaps the Garrisons and Leo Jewett.</p>
<p>He just couldn&rsquo;t pin it on either or both of the  Garrisons, so left was only Jewett.</p>
<p>He would look into that possibility, of course, but what  motive could the man have? To be sure Stone often told himself to make other  deductions and the motive would soon show itself. How could he know what  relations Leopold Jewett held with Isabel Murray, or ever had held?</p>
<p>Suddenly he remembered the words Isabel spoke just the  moment before she died. She had looked straight at her husband and had said,  clearly, &ldquo;Think of it! After years of devotion, to murder me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could an accusation be more direct?</p>
<p>Yet he must remember she was out of her head. Her mind and  memory were both greatly impaired.</p>
<p>True, she had sane moments, but was it not obvious that  those were spoken without real intent?</p>
<p>Leif Murray could not murder his wife nor could she think  he would. No, the words came from a disordered brain, and meant just nothing at  all.</p>
<p>He tried to forget the subject and turn his thoughts to  the imminent question of the Tolman murder. He was retained on that, and he was  doing wrong to spend any time on outside affairs, until it was settled.</p>
<p>He knew that Paul Tolman had resented his going on the  yacht party, but he couldn&rsquo;t make himself regret that move.</p>
<p>If it should turn out that Isabel was murdered, he would  have much knowledge that he could bring to bear upon it.</p>
<p>Better wait until he was asked to do so!</p>
<p>Leif Murray, he knew, was an easy-going, good-natured  chap, but put up to him some unpleasant question and see how he could turn on  you.</p>
<p>But Isabel had said&mdash;</p>
<p>That, he told himself was the raving of a diseased brain  and he must not think of it seriously. He must never mention to Leif the  possibility of foul play, and it was a thousand to one there had never been  any.</p>
<p>He ate his dinner in the restaurant car, gazing out at the  none too inspiriting scenery of southern New    Jersey.</p>
<p>But if he had been traveling through the Garden of the  Hesperides, it would have made but slight impression on him.</p>
<p>He reached Ingle Heights in the late evening and went directly to the Inn.</p>
<p>After greeting Kenton he went up to his rooms, and with  his never-failing promptness, he called up the newspaper office and delivered  Leif&rsquo;s messages and then called Mrs. Mendel at Longacre. He told her he would  go to see her the next morning and tell her the particulars of Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s  death, and give her messages from Miss Mead.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mendel burst into audible sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; she said, chokingly, &ldquo;who did it? <i>Who</i> did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Mrs. Mendel,&rdquo; was the stern response. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say  such things on the telephone! Don&rsquo;t say them at all. Don&rsquo;t say anything about  the sorrowful news until I see you. Will you promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes, Mr. Stone. When w-will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow morning, as early as possible. Tell Simmons to  say nothing about it to anyone, and don&rsquo;t tell anybody else.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone heard the receiver put down clumsily, and he judged  the poor woman couldn&rsquo;t see for the blinding tears.</p>
<p>But why did Mrs. Mendel say &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as if she was expecting a murder!</p>
<p>Nonsense, he was getting dotty on the subject himself.</p>
<p>Then he went to Paul Tolman&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Always suave and gracious, Tolman received him with a  welcome and inquired the news.</p>
<p>Stone told him the main facts of Isabel&rsquo;s death, and  though not surprised, Tolman was most sympathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard on Murray,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that man well, but he strikes me as a thoroughbred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; Stone assented. &ldquo;They seemed to me an ideal  couple. They&rsquo;re all coming back here tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elaine, too? Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She stayed on the yacht, when the Murrays stopped at the hospital. They are on the  way home. Will arrive tomorrow some time. How are things with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stalled. Glad you&rsquo;re back. Now, let&rsquo;s give up search for  Peter&rsquo;s will. I don&rsquo;t believe he ever made any. I have a lawyer here, a friend  of mine up from New York,  and he&rsquo;ll look after all legal queries. But I don&rsquo;t want you to give up hunting  my brother&rsquo;s murderer. I believe in the old Mosaic law, an eye for an eye and a  tooth for a tooth. And &lsquo;whosoever slayeth a man by man shall be slain.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t  think I&rsquo;ve quoted that quite right, but good enough. Anyway, I want to get the  damned villain that did for Pete. I&rsquo;d like to kill him with a poison that would  set him writhing in agony. I&rsquo;m not ordinarily a vindictive chap, but&mdash;well, you  never had a brother murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; will Coles reconvene the inquest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. He isn&rsquo;t sure himself. He would like to strut his  stuff again I&rsquo;m sure of that. But he can&rsquo;t seem to get hold of any new  evidence. I doubt he ever will. But I&rsquo;m not ready to give up quite yet. You got  any new ideas?</p>
<p>&ldquo;About your brother&rsquo;s death? Sorry to say, no. But I  believe it was wilful murder. I snatched an opportunity to talk to a couple of  doctors down at the hospital, and they were positive it could not have been the  kernels alone. They said it would be so easy to take a hypodermic and introduce  a bit of real prussic acid into the kernel, and put it among others, and let  Peter take it when its turn came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think that&rsquo;s what happened.&rdquo; Tolman almost shouted  in his excitement. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the scurvy villain did! That&rsquo;s how Peter was  killed. Now you dig deeper into the mystery and find the devil and I&rsquo;ll double  your fee. I tell you, Mr. Stone, I want retribution, and I&rsquo;m going to have it  if it can be had. You&rsquo;ve won out in other cases, put your best licks on this!  I&rsquo;m a plain man but I&rsquo;m not a poor man, and what I want I can pay for. So put  up your goods and send in your bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, Tolman, but you know sometimes we can&rsquo;t  get what we want, even if we have the price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not often. But I know you&rsquo;re doing your damnedest, and I&rsquo;m  satisfied with your progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I haven&rsquo;t made any yet,&rdquo; and Stone looked at him in  real astonishment.</p>
<p>Tolman favored him with a wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t fool me. You&rsquo;ve got something up your sleeve.  You know some points that you&rsquo;re not yet ready to proclaim on the housetops,  and that&rsquo;s all right. Keep your own counsel till you get good and ready to  spill it. Now, I&rsquo;ll leave you, for I know you&rsquo;re a busy one. And, too, here is  our beloved and respected Sir Kenton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; the Innkeeper greeted him. &ldquo;Glad to  see you back. Sad news you&rsquo;re bringing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Who told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ballard called me up from Atlantic City, and bade me tell some few  people. Poor lady, she&rsquo;ll be a great loss to the whole town. Such a pretty  little piece of property. I&rsquo;m told the funeral will be on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Not a large funeral, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as to that. How&rsquo;s my friend, Doctor Coles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorter riled at your going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get over that. Good man, Coles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last Stone was left to himself, and he went out on his  little balcony to give his problems a little more thoughts.</p>
<p>And as his thoughts grew less and less clear and became  mere visions or hazy, dreamy notions, he realized he was very tired and sleepy  and his best bet was to go to bed.</p>
<p>He came to himself with a positive jerk, as a sudden thought  snapped into his brain.</p>
<p>He almost spoke aloud, but not quite, as he said to  himself&mdash; Those two murders are connected!</p>
<p>Then he laughed outright at his own foolishness. The moon  has affected my brain, he decided.</p>
<p>But he sat a moment trying to think it out. No, he  concluded, there&rsquo;s no tiny spark of connection. No reason to think that the  murderers had anything in common. And, of course, I&rsquo;m not yet entirely sure  that Isabel Murray was murdered. But, if asked, I&rsquo;d bet my last cent on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning Fleming Stone awoke refreshed and  clear-headed.</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered his last waking thoughts of the  night before. But looking them squarely in the face, he felt less sure about  them.</p>
<p>Was it common sense to think Isabel Murray was murdered?  And by an X-ray, of all things!</p>
<p>To Fleming Stone&rsquo;s experienced mind, common sense came  before deductive genius in detective work. He had a hair-trigger intellect and  a self-starting brain, his imagination was limitless and his sense of relative  values well-nigh perfect. But in spite of all these, he had come to the  conclusion that a large part of his success in his work was due to his sound  common sense.</p>
<p>And now, he asked himself, wasn&rsquo;t his suspicion of murder  outside the pale of rational thought?</p>
<p>And, if as his wild flight of fancy the night before had  suggested, he suspected Isabel had been murdered by Tolman&rsquo;s murderer, that  meant she might have been murdered by Paley, and could common sense go farther  astray than that?</p>
<p>Not that he felt sure Paley had killed Tolman. But there  was no other way to look, and surely Paley had motive. His talk about the  invention and the patent rights was all very well, but if he had killed Tolman  in order to grab the impending fortune from the sale of Tolman&rsquo;s brain-child,  it was barely possible that Mrs. Murray had some bit of private knowledge that  might make trouble for him.</p>
<p>Stone realized this idea was problematical, unlikely and  probably absurd, but he most certainly proposed to look into it before  discarding it entirely.</p>
<p>While he depended on common sense, he had an eye out for  hunches or inspirations or whatever they could be called.</p>
<p>And after he had dressed and eaten his breakfast, somehow  the theory of one murderer for the two deaths did not seem so tenable, and he  put it out of his mind.</p>
<p>He went over to Longacre first, as he had promised Mrs. Mendel.</p>
<p>She was composed enough but very sorrowful and on the  verge of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very dreadful, Mrs. Mendel,&rdquo; Stone began, &ldquo;but  we haven&rsquo;t much time. I know you must be busy, and there are some things Miss  Mead wanted me to tell you about the housekeeping, also give you these lists. Mr.  Murray and Miss Mead will be home this afternoon, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s body?&rdquo; she asked, as Stone paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will come at the same time. It will be left at the  mortuary. The funeral will probably be on Tuesday, but I am not sure about  that. Miss Mead will be here tonight, and she will tell you the plans. You&rsquo;ll  stay on, Mrs. Mendel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, sir.&rdquo; She pursed her lips and shook her head  a little. &ldquo;Helga, she&rsquo;s leaving today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Helga?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parlormaid. She&rsquo;s a young thing and foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope Miss Mead will have no trouble with the  staff. And I hope you can persuade them to stay quietly for a few days, even if  they leave after the funeral. Bring in that parlormaid, will you? I&rsquo;d like to  speak to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the neatly uniformed Swedish girl came in, Stone  looked at her in surprise. She had a very pretty blonde face but on it appeared  such a frown that its beauty was almost lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you scowling at, Helga?&rdquo; Stone said, kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You the dee-tective?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. Have you anything to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you? Nossir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you have,&rdquo; Stone said, firmly. He felt sure, from  the girl&rsquo;s manner, she knew something. &ldquo;You know, if you have any information,  and hold it back from the police, you may be put in jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You the po-lis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely. Now, what is it you&rsquo;re keeping secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, sir? Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone saw at once that he could not intimidate her nor  reason with her. He didn&rsquo;t let it bother him, as Helga was not in his scheme of  hunting the Tolman murderer, and he had no intention of questioning anybody  about the death of Isabel Murray.</p>
<p>He dismissed Helga and asked to see Jenny, Isabel&rsquo;s own  maid.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mendel went to fetch her, and Stone looked about the  attractive living-room, thinking of the family it had housed, now so broken up.  For Tonka Mead could scarcely live there alone with Murray, and he doubted if Leif would continue  to live there himself.</p>
<p>He scanned the bookshelves, marveling at the large number  of scientific works, especially physics and electrical matters. He smiled at  the array of detective stories, many of them being among his own favorites. He  noted a shelf of light recent fiction, and concluded that was Isabel&rsquo;s property  or maybe Tonka&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Jenny came, but proved unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>To most of his questions she answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,  sir,&rdquo; and she showed not the slightest interest in the death of her mistress or  the manner of her taking off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were fond of your mistress, were you not?&rdquo; Stone  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sometimes she was decent to me, and sometimes she  raked me over the coals for no reason at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she more ill-tempered during this last illness of  hers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; she was most always kind and pleasant before she  took sick. Though she was always a nagger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by nagger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why, she&rsquo;d tell me to do something, and every few minutes  she&rsquo;d nag at me to know if I&rsquo;d done it. Or if she was going out, she&rsquo;d pester  me to get her hat and wraps long before it was time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Shall you stay on, to maid Miss Mead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if I&rsquo;m asked to. Miss Tonka is queer, but I like  her. She&rsquo;s fair and square &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Jenny, I&rsquo;ve no more hard questions to ask you.  Do you think Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s illness had any cause other than her sunbaths and  long naps in the sun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir,&rdquo; and the girl looked positively scared.  &ldquo;Somebody put the evil eye on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, don&rsquo;t talk like that. What do you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that. Nothing else would explain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way she went off. Getting so thin and peaked and then  her poor face all breaking out, her, who never had a mar on her beautiful skin,  and her hair coming out and her having spasms and losing her mind and her  memory, oh, what does all that mean but the curse somebody put on her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s tone was so intense and her face so white and frightened,  Fleming Stone was a little stirred.</p>
<p>But he only said, in his matter-of-fact way;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better cut that out, Jenny, it means nothing and may get  you into trouble. When Miss Mead comes, do all you can for her; poor girl, she  has sad responsibilities.</p>
<p>Stone went away and went directly back to the Inn. There he found Tolman in confab with a stranger. They  were in one of the small reception rooms, which could be used privately by the  guests of the Inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; called Tolman when Stone tapped at the door, to  which Kenton had directed him.</p>
<p>Stone went in and was glad to find that the stranger was a  police detective who had just returned from his vacation.</p>
<p>Scott was a strapping big fellow, of genial manner and he  greeted Stone with hearty expressions of admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done toward finding the will?&rdquo; Stone asked  him, in hope of cutting off his stream of compliments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found out that there isn&rsquo;t any will to find,&rdquo; Scott  replied, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t that all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;How did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if a man dies, having never had a lawyer or a  doctor or a minister, isn&rsquo;t it a safe bet he never made a will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely convincing,&rdquo; Stone smiled, &ldquo;but if it&rsquo;s good  enough for Mr. Paul Tolman, it&rsquo;s good enough for me. How about it?&rdquo; he looked  at Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it seems to me this way, Mr. Stone. We have done all  we can to find my brother&rsquo;s will, and it hasn&rsquo;t turned up. I think we are  justified in assuming that he didn&rsquo;t leave any, and going ahead without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or we&rsquo;ll never get anywhere,&rdquo; supplemented Scott. Stone  had not felt drawn to the new detective at first, but he began to like him  better. He surely seemed to have common sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;We must pull together, Mr. Scott.  What seems to you the first move?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To apply in the proper quarters to have Paul Tolman  appointed executor of his brother&rsquo;s estate. And then to discover just what said  brother&rsquo;s estate comprises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you that,&rdquo; Paul said; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the invention.  That may be worth much or nothing, but whatever it is worth, it belongs to  Pete&rsquo;s legal heirs, and they are his mother and two brothers. See? Well, then  Pete had some old stock in some old company. I&rsquo;m not sure just what it is, but  mother has the securities or whatever you call them, and that&rsquo;s an asset or  not, according as it pans out. So you see there isn&rsquo;t much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about insurance?&rdquo; asked the astute Scott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Paul returned. &ldquo;If he had any, I bet he  let it lapse or sold it out for present cash. You must remember, Mr. Scott,  that my brother was the world&rsquo;s worst business man. I have all his papers&mdash;that  is&mdash;except any that Paley took&mdash;I mean, may have taken. By the way, Stone, can&rsquo;t  we get the papers back from Washington  that Paley left there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he took them illegally, we most certainly can. But Mr.  Scott knows more about such things than I do. I say, Tolman, are you a  ventriloquist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you do jump around,&rdquo; Paul smiled. &ldquo;Why, yes, &mdash;isn&rsquo;t  everybody, to a degree? We all used to do it at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were the poorest at it of all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words seemed to come from the distant side of the  room, and the two men listening, jumped and stared hard at the wall.</p>
<p>Paul couldn&rsquo;t help laughing and Scott burst into guffaws  as he realized the truth.</p>
<p>Tolman had done it himself, thus proving he had real skill  in that direction.</p>
<p>And then they set to work in earnest. Paul had all the  papers he possessed of Peter&rsquo;s estate, and he and the two detectives went over  them rapidly, finding they could destroy or dispense with many and easily take  care of others, until all was pretty well attended to save for the papers Paley  still held. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  Helga Goes To Jail</b></h2>
<p>IT was the following Wednesday, and the day before, the  remains of the one-time beautiful Isabel Murray had been laid to rest in the  village cemetery.</p>
<p>The funeral had been a small one, only family friends  being invited, and to the accompaniment of garden flowers, soft music and the  sonorous intoning of the service by the well-loved rector, Isabel was taken  away from her home.</p>
<p>One friend who had attended the funeral had remained at  Longacre and was there still. This was Mrs. Bingham, the important personage  whom Leif called Aunt Phoebe, and who descended on the Murrays for occasional visits.</p>
<p>She was an Englishwoman who lived in Quebec and her husband was Leif&rsquo;s uncle. She  was quaint and interesting and all that, but everyone who knew her conceded  that a little of Phoebe Bingham went a long way.</p>
<p>Garrulous, opinionated, dictatorial, determined&mdash; many more  such adjectives would fit Aunt Phoebe.</p>
<p>About sixty years old, she had the energy and vivacity of  a young woman and still preserved much of her youthful charm. Her hair was  white, abundant and naturally curly. It was short, and lay in loose, soft  ringlets, a very halo of beauty. </p>
<p>Her eyes were dark and piercing, and she gave the  impression of seeing everything, which she very nearly did.</p>
<p>Today, as she sat in the living-room with Leif and Tonka,  she was planning their future with avid enjoyment.</p>
<p>Tonka, at first interested, grew bored, as she heard the  disposition about to be made of herself, and remarked, pointedly, that she did  not approve of it, and would not consent to it.</p>
<p>Leif looked deeply concerned. Tonka couldn&rsquo;t understand  why he was so interested in the old lady&rsquo;s babble.</p>
<p>He said no word of agreement, but neither did he raise any  objections.</p>
<p>Aunt Phoebe&rsquo;s plans were vague, and seemed based on the  general idea that both Leif and Tonka would remove their place of residence to Quebec or at any rate to Canada.</p>
<p>Tonka was about to declare emphatically and with no minced  words, that she, for one, would positively not move to Canada or any other place not  selected by herself.</p>
<p>But just then Fleming Stone and the police detective Scott  arrived and Aunt Phoebe gleefully gave over baiting the girl and turned to the  new arrivals.</p>
<p>Leif looked up wearily as Stone introduced his companion,  and paid an unwilling attention to an explanation of their presence.</p>
<p>Scott was spokesman and saying he had some news of  importance to divulge, perhaps Mr. Murray would rather see him alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Aunt Phoebe, briskly; &ldquo;anything of  importance must be said before me. I am a part of Leif&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A relative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same as. My husband is Mr. Murray&rsquo;s uncle. He is the  brother of Mr. Murray&rsquo;s mother, who was a Canadian girl, Cicely Bingham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You corroborate this, Mr. Murray?&rdquo; Scott asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Mrs. Bingham is an authority on our family tree.  So, come right out with whatever you have to say. Miss Mead is a member of the  family also. You two men in cahoots?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Stone told him. &ldquo;We have had news from the hospital  where Mrs. Murray was a patient and we feel you ought to know it. Go ahead,  Scott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this, Mr. Murray.&rdquo; Though often loud of voice and  manner, Scott spoke quietly, addressing himself to Murray, with a glance now and then at Tonka.  He seemed to have forgotten the elder lady&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>Ordinarily this would have roused Aunt Phoebe to wrath,  but so interested was she in learning the promised news, she sat breathlessly  waiting for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is this,&rdquo; Scott said; &ldquo;a letter has come from Doctor  Horner, stating that further tests and certain unlooked-for developments have  proved beyond all question that Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s death was the result of X-ray  treatments given to her recently. Nothing further is known, I mean as to how or  where the treatments were administered. We are here to ask you if you know of  any such treatments given to your wife, or is there a possibility that she took  them secretly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leif interrupted the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let up on that line of talk,&rdquo; he said, not rudely, but  with an air of helpfulness; &ldquo;there is no possibility that my wife ever took  X-ray treatments of her own will. I cannot imagine her taking them unwillingly,  unknown to me. I make no comment on the decision of the doctors as to the cause  of Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s death, nor do I feel any deep interest in the matter. By which  I mean that since my dear wife is dead from some painful and little-known  disease, I prefer that my memories of her shall be of her healthy, happy days  and I do not care to mull over the sad tragedy of her illness and death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Murray,&rdquo;  Stone said, &ldquo;the point is there is a possibility that someone gave her these  treatments with an evil intent; or what may have turned out by accident to be  an evil result. There may have been criminal action or negligence that brought  about her death. You want the matter followed up, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I do.&rdquo; Leif&rsquo;s face showed a stubborn  expression. &ldquo;Why do you want to worry into it? It cannot bring my Isabel back  to me, it cannot lessen my burden of grief. It would rather add to my sorrow,  to dig and delve into the mystery, to question and investigate, to argue and  deduce. No, Stone, my wife is dead, and no effort can help or alleviate that. I  do not want to forget any least moment of her bright and happy life, but I  should be glad to forget the sad memories of the last few weeks. I think you  understand, Mr. Scott?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murray turned to the police detective,  as if already sure that his friend, Fleming Stone was in full sympathy with  what he had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Scott said, straightforwardly; &ldquo;and I am quite of  your way of thinking, personally. But as a government executive, I have a duty  to perform and I cannot keep this new information to myself. It is my duty to  report to my superiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hell!&rdquo; said Leif, bothered to death with this new  quandary in addition to the trouble he was already experiencing with Aunt  Phoebe and her claims. &ldquo;What do you want to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nephew,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bingham, in her most austere voice,  &ldquo;do not treat a grave matter so lightly. Mr. Scott, who is an arm of the law,  has a right to exact your obedience to whatever course he deems right and  necessary. I have unusual percipience and I gather Mr. Scott means there has  been foul play. In other words he is implying that he suspects our Isabel was  murdered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Tonka cried out, as if in physical pain, &ldquo;Aunt  Phoebe, you stop that sort of talk! He doesn&rsquo;t mean that, does he, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it quite likely he does, Tonka,&rdquo; and Stone spoke  with infinite gentleness. &ldquo;Tell her, Scott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Mead, I do mean that. There has been great  uncertainty, even mystification as to the cause of Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s death, and  this explanation just received is so explicit and so undeniable that we have no  choice but to accept it and follow up its claims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to tell me more before I give my consent,&rdquo;  Leif said, his tone almost belligerent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without meaning offence, Mr. Murray,&rdquo; Scott told him, &ldquo;I  have to tell you that our procedure is not dependent on your consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; and Aunt Phoebe&rsquo;s attitude had changed to  angry defiance, &ldquo;you mean that because a lot of ignorant doctors are unfamiliar  with a certain disease, they call it murder to hide their own deficiency!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that, Mrs. Bingham,&rdquo; Scott returned, in  polite fashion. He then turned to Leif and said, &ldquo;I am here, Mr. Murray, in the  pursuance of my duty. I am sure you will put no obstacles in my way, and I  venture to think you will give me any assistance that you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leif, too, had changed his attitude. He realized that if  the police had made up their minds to look upon Isabel&rsquo;s death as a murder, it  was his best course to string along with them and do anything he could to aid  them in their search for the murderer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Mr. Scott,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and here and now, I  want to engage Mr. Stone&rsquo;s services as my private detective, to see me through  this ordeal, as I fear it must prove. I know, Stone, you are engaged on the  Paley case, but can&rsquo;t you run the two, side by side? As it&rsquo;s all right here in  the Heights, I&rsquo;m hoping you can do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not,&rdquo; Stone assented. &ldquo;I am so interested  in the case of Mrs. Murray, I should follow it up anyway. And Mr. Scott is an  experienced detective and will be working with me on both cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Mr. Scott,&rdquo; Leif said, in a matter of fact way, &ldquo;I  am at your disposal. What do you want me to do? And don&rsquo;t misunderstand me; if  my wife was murdered, I most certainly do want to discover and punish the  killer. I have thought of this, of course, but I could figure out no way in  which such a deed could be accomplished. Nor do I see that yet, but I assume  that part is up to you. But do put the thing through with all the speed  possible. I am worn out and I feel the need of going away somewhere for rest  and relaxation. Need it necessarily drag along through weeks of investigation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, indeed, Mr. Murray, but of course you know we  cannot time our procedure to our own wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that, Leif,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure you will  be good help in our search. There will probably be an inquest, and that may  give us some clues at once, and we will get more from other sources. Let us  hope to make our investigation short and successful. A dreadful crime like this  cannot be ignored or evaded. Coles will hold the inquest, and Mr. Scott and I  will try our best to discover evidence that shall help us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bingham sat in stony silence. She was furious because  no one paid any attention to her or cared for her opinions. In high dudgeon she  remarked coldly;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go home tomorrow, then, Leif,&rdquo; she said, with the  air of one pronouncing a dread ultimatum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt,&rdquo; Leif said, in a preoccupied voice. &ldquo;That will  be best, I think. I shall doubtless be busy with these men, and could give you  little of my time. We will have a talk this evening, and I will keep you posted  as to how the case progresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that evening Elaine came over to see them all, and  when Leif told her of the new investigation to be made, she was sympathy  itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how hard for you,&rdquo; she said, her dark eyes filled  with grief. &ldquo;As if you hadn&rsquo;t enough to bear already! What can I do? I came to  ask Tonka to stay with me for a time, and let you go away for a rest, Leif. I  didn&rsquo;t know Mrs. Bingham was here. But I&rsquo;ll be glad to have her come, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go away now, Elaine,&rdquo; Leif explained. &ldquo;I have to  be at the beck and call of the police, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To give evidence of sorts. To answer questions of more  sorts. And, too, a runaway is not highly looked upon, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand. But where did they ever pick up such a  notion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. Except that they had word from  some of the hospital doctors that the cause of Isabel&rsquo;s death was positively  some X-ray treatments she must have had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Leif, X-rays aren&rsquo;t poisonous of themselves. I&rsquo;ve had  them, a long time ago, and they&rsquo;re beneficial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If given properly, I suppose. I don&rsquo;t know much about  such things, but I know Isabel hated the sound of the word. Ever since she had  her teeth X-rayed, she was afraid of such treatment. You know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. And how could she have had any such  treatments without anyone knowing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she could if she had wanted to. She had a very  strong will, had my little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious!&rdquo; Tonka put in. &ldquo;Suppose she went to some  specialist to be cured of something by rays. Suppose Friend Specialist was a beginner  or didn&rsquo;t quite know how to work the machine and gave her too much or  something. Do you want to electrocute him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said Elaine. &ldquo;An amateur has no reason or right  to practice if he isn&rsquo;t expert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it was anything like that,&rdquo; Leif said,  but Aunt Phoebe interrupted;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what it was, though, Leif. I knew of a case  something like it. If you leave the thing turned on too long, it burns the  patient&rsquo;s insides, and makes her ill just exactly like Isabel was ill, and then  she slowly dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re perfectly sure of your facts, Mrs. Bingham,&rdquo;  Elaine said, reprovingly, &ldquo;you oughtn&rsquo;t to make such statements. Do you know it  to be true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it,&rdquo; declared Aunt Phoebe; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all anyone can  say. Of course, I am not a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;Horner told me that if  Isabel did die from too strong treatments by X-rays, then the murderer must  have been a doctor. He said, no layman could bring it about. So, if the  diagnosis is right where&rsquo;s a doctor who would kill our Isabel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not intentionally,&rdquo; Elaine suggested. &ldquo;But maybe a  specialist, giving her treatments of some sort&mdash;why, you know the Beauty Parlors  nowadays have all kinds of queer engines that do things to you, to make you  thinner or fatter, or more lithe and elegant or improve your complexion or your  hair&mdash;oh, there&rsquo;s no end to the things they do to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isabel wasn&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; Leif said; &ldquo;she didn&rsquo;t go to  Beauty Parlors; she didn&rsquo;t have to, she was beautiful enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Leif, don&rsquo;t be a dumbo!&rdquo; and Tonka laughed at him.  &ldquo;Isabel did go to such places, I&rsquo;ve been with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for a manicure or shampoo, then,&rdquo; Leif insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will all these things be asked about at the inquest?&rdquo;  Tonka inquired, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Leif told her. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t climb trees and  listen for clues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I know anything, I have to tell it, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know it really and truly, yes. But listen, Tonka,  if you are asked anything you know partially, or may know inaccurately, say you  don&rsquo;t know. More harm is done by uncertain evidence than any other one thing at  an inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been taught that if you know anything and  don&rsquo;t tell it you&rsquo;re a criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they put you in jail!&rdquo; declared Aunt Phoebe,  unable longer to keep out of the discussion.</p>
<p>Simmons came in then, carrying a large tray and followed  by Helga with a smaller tray.</p>
<p>The butler arranged plates and glasses and Helga passed  them round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it like in jail?&rdquo; Tonka kept up her inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May you never know,&rdquo; said Aunt Phoebe. &ldquo;I know, for I go  on certain days to entertain the poor prisoners shut in their cells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they like it?&rdquo; Leif asked, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they do, as much as they can like anything.  After they&rsquo;ve been there a long time, they&rsquo;re not like people, they&rsquo;re more  like animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see, Tonka,&rdquo; Leif said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better keep out of  jail. If you know something you want to tell, tell it to me first, and I&rsquo;ll  advise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I will,&rdquo; said Tonka, who was taking the matter  seriously.</p>
<p>Elaine went home, and then Aunt Phoebe told Leif she  wanted a talk with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Aunt,&rdquo; he said, pleasantly enough, &lsquo;I suppose  that matter must be settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drifted off to Leif&rsquo;s study, and Tonka, left alone,  read for a while and then went up to her room.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t go to bed for a long while, but sat at the  window, thinking.</p>
<p>She did know something she didn&rsquo;t want to tell, and more,  she intended not to tell, but she hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t have to. Tonka would not  balk at a lie, if told in the right place and at the right time. But she didn&rsquo;t  like the idea of going to jail. And her one-track mind told her that to refrain  from telling something was definitely a lie. She never minced matters or begged  questions or whipped the devil around the stump, but she cowered back at the  thought of incarceration. It had never come home to her before that she had any  responsibilities concerning anyone but herself.</p>
<p>There was a tap at her door, and she rose and opened it.  Aunt Phoebe stood there, seemingly placid, but Tonka detected a repressed excitement  in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not gone to bed yet?&rdquo; she said, seeing the girl still in  the gown she had been wearing; &ldquo;then, I wish you&rsquo;d come downstairs and have a  little confab with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Aunt Phoebe; what&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bingham did not answer this, but started back down  the stairs and Tonka followed.</p>
<p>They went to Leif&rsquo;s study and found him there, looking  weary and sad, but more than that, perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he said, rising and pushing chairs for them.  &ldquo;Tonka, you are invited to a conference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to be included,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;my wisdom and good  judgment are world renowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need them both,&rdquo; and Leif looked at her kindly,  but with a strange, even curious expression, as if he had never seen her  before.</p>
<p>The conference lasted over an hour, and Tonka went back to  her room, with a stunned feeling as if something had hit her, and she didn&rsquo;t  know what.</p>
<p>She went to bed, still in a daze, and lay there thinking,  thinking until she fell asleep from sheer exhaustion.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>In another part of the house another young girl lay in her  bed, sleepless also.</p>
<p>The pretty parlormaid, the Swedish Helga, lay motionless,  her hands clasped on her breast and her wide-open eyes staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p>She did not toss about in her nervous excitement, but her  lips moved slightly as she argued with herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must do it,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;It is for me to do, and I  must. I am a good girl and I must do what is right. How can I? But it is not  how can I? it is I must. Well, then, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And without further discussion with herself Helga calmly  went to sleep.</p>
<p>And she awoke next morning with an unshaken determination  to do what she felt certain was her immediate duty.</p>
<p>She neglected no part of her early morning work, and in  tidy and trim uniform and clean apron she waited at breakfast.</p>
<p>Tonka sat in Isabel&rsquo;s place. Though preferring to  breakfast in bed, she now came to the table, hoping her company would make Leif  a little less lonely. She was deeply sorry for him, and though there was little  she could do to help him bear his burden, she watched out for more.</p>
<p>Though a little forced, the breakfast table conversation  was pleasant and cheerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose matters will take shape at headquarters,&rdquo; Leif  said, &ldquo;but until they do, I shall not take any steps. I&rsquo;ve engaged the best  detective I know of, and I hope he&rsquo;ll prove expeditious. You&rsquo;ll stay a few  days, Aunt Phoebe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, unless I hear bad news from home. Your Uncle Joseph  may have a stroke or a crisis of some sort at any time. I shall have to go at  once in such case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I understand. If necessary I&rsquo;ll send you up  there in an aeroplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather stay on the ground, but we&rsquo;ll see about it.  More hot waffles, Helga; they are very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast over, Helga went to her room. With no expression  of doubt or uncertainty on her round little Swedish face, she dressed herself  in her Sunday best. It was a bit gay&mdash;a green suit, piped with red, a green hat  with a red feather and a flaunting red and green scarf.</p>
<p>She went down to the pantry and reported to Mrs. Mendel,  who looked at her in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please let me to go out this morning, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Helga said,  so earnestly that the housekeeper checked the refusal she had meant to  pronounce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Helga said, her cornflower blue eyes turning  darker as she plead. &ldquo;Please, no matter where&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be back very soon&mdash;oh, Mrs. Mendel,  ma&rsquo;am, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as you&rsquo;re making such a fuss of it, go. You&rsquo;re a  good girl, Helga, and I trust you not to do anything wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, ma&rsquo;am, it&rsquo;s right&mdash;very right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run along, then; tell Simmons I said you might go, and be  back by lunch time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; and Helga did not run along, but walked slowly,  almost, it seemed, unwillingly toward the door.</p>
<p>She walked slowly, too, when she reached the street. But,  suddenly, her face assumed a more determined air, she quickened her pace, and  in a distinctly Swedish way, she stomped along, turned corners and walked  blocks until she stood before the jail.</p>
<p>This building was attractive outside, like a famous cup  and platter, but what might be inside was already giving Helga the shudders,  and she stood on the pavement, staring, before she made her way in.</p>
<p>Then, gritting her teeth audibly, she strode up the path  and rang the bell.</p>
<p>A formidable looking man, presumably, she thought, the  jailer, opened the door.</p>
<p>He looked at her curiously, and then said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see the jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  The Rector Approves A Strange Plan</b></h2>
<p>AT Longacre the rector had come to make a morning call.</p>
<p>Though Doctor Chalmers&rsquo; white hair was like some of  Sargent&rsquo;s pictures of the prophets, his mien was far from patriarchal.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was due to the fact that so many of his  parishioners were of the younger or near younger generation.</p>
<p>This was not the first time the rector had called since he  had read the service over Isabel&rsquo;s casket, and he allowed himself a little more  lightness of speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going away for a time, Mr. Murray?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t help thinking a short trip somewhere would do you worlds of good,  physically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that at present, my dear sir. You see&mdash;ah, here  comes Mr. Ballard. Excuse me just one moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leif jumped up and went quickly to the hall, where he had  a few words with Ballard, and then both returned to the living-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in to my study, all of you, please,&rdquo; Leif said, and  held the study door open while they filed through.</p>
<p>He looked so serious, that no one made any laughing  rejoinder or asked why the session.</p>
<p>Aunt Phoebe stalked ahead, then Tonka. Doctor Chalmers  followed, and Leif said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along Antony,  we may want you for a witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballard entered the room and then Leif came in and shut  the door and locked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery?&rdquo; Ballard asked, trying to speak lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Leif said, &ldquo;but this is a secret conclave. You must  all promise to keep absolutely confidential whatever may happen in here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all gave the required promise, and then Leif laid  before them the strangest proposition that had ever been heard by any of them,  including Murray himself.</p>
<p>They listened carefully, they pondered wisely, and then,  after some necessary questions and answers, they one and all gave approval to  this unheard of thing.</p>
<p>The rector kept nodding his white crown of glory even  after he had voiced his consent to the plan.</p>
<p>Aunt Phoebe fairly plumed herself in her satisfaction;  Tonka put on her blank gaze that made her look an absolute imbecile, and Antony  Ballard though he couldn&rsquo;t shake off his amazed, astounded, even flabbergasted  air, had a twinkle in his eye that guaranteed his spoken approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;perfectly splendid! How did you ever  think of it, Leif? You brave man, you wise, sensible person. The most efficient  gesture I&rsquo;ve ever heard of. Go to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Murray  went to it.</p>
<p>It is possible he might have hesitated longer had he known  of the accusing angel standing at the door of the jail.</p>
<p>When Swedish Helga said &ldquo;I want to see the jail,&rdquo; she  spoke to a man who was susceptible to big blue eyes, yellow hair and pink  cheeks, in addition to a troubled expression of countenance.</p>
<p>Moreover he was the Junior Warden, and quite sufficiently  in authority to show off his beloved jail to anybody who really wanted to see  it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t have to have a ticket,&rdquo; he told the  applicant, &ldquo;but you have to tell me why you want to see inside of this  caravansary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me that,&rdquo; and two big tears glistened in the  blue eyes. &ldquo;Just show me the&mdash;you know&mdash;the cells. Please do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was about to class her as a fine candidate for village  idiot, but the look in her eyes after those two tears had rolled down her  cheeks, made him hastily revise his intention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, then,&rdquo; he said, and led the way.</p>
<p>Helga followed and was shown cells of varying degrees of  discomfort, and shuddered to find that the very best one was far from her idea  of what the well-dressed criminal ought to occupy.</p>
<p>She looked so disappointed that Warden Dennis, not wishful  to see any more of those crystal-clear teardrops, thought it was time to jolly  her a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was you thinkin&rsquo; of occupyin&rsquo; one yourself, lady?&rdquo; he  inquired, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Helga drew back into herself, and said,  impersonally; &ldquo;Please tell me where I can find the Head of Police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief, you mean? He isn&rsquo;t here; he&rsquo;s at  Headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Head quarts? What is that? Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Headquarters, Miss. Over 0n Ransome Street, and a block down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to tell somethings. Could it that I go there?&rdquo;  When Helga became excited or nervous her English gave way a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Run right along. Ask for an Inspector,  &mdash;any Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Mr. Scott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you do? Well ask for Mr. Scott, then. Ask for  whatever you want and take whatever you get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good by, sir. I think I go there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red and green vision faded from the Warden&rsquo;s view and  Helga dragged herself over to Headquarters.</p>
<p>After some inquiries she found herself in the presence of  Detective Scott who looked at her in well-concealed surprise.</p>
<p>Scott was partial to yellow-haired dolls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you and what do you want?&rdquo; he asked tersely but  not curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Helga and I have to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down then, and tell it rapidly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know who killed Mrs. Murray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you do? Who told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody told me. I live there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Live where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Longacre. At the Murray  place. I am parlormaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are? Parlormaid at the Murrays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, that&rsquo;s what I said, and it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt you. And you have something to tell me?  Well, tell it. You say it is about Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Her husband killed her. Mr. Murray killed her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, young woman! You can&rsquo;t sling that sort of talk  around. Now tell me all you know or think you know. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, only tell  the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Well, I knew three four weeks ago that Mr. Murray  was making to kill his wife. Also that he was going to do it soon. Also which  he done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one too many for me, miss. I&rsquo;ll call for help.&rdquo; He  put two fingers in his mouth and whistled.</p>
<p>The shrill sound brought a response from the next room and  Fleming Stone appeared at the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Helga,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Stone,&rdquo; Scott invited. &ldquo;Shut the door, that&rsquo;s  right. Now sit down and help me listen to a witness of sorts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Scott. Give me a chance first. Why are you  here, Helga?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell what I know, Mr. Stone. You said you don&rsquo;t tell  what you know, you go to jail. I went and looked at jail. I do not like it. So  I think I tell my story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about that, Helga. What is your story  about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that Mr. Murray killed his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? And how did he kill her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know. With x y z things, whatever they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scott,&rdquo; Stone said, seriously, &ldquo;we must listen to this  girl. I know her and she is a strange mixture of wisdom and ignorance. I don&rsquo;t  think she can help us, though she may. But we must plumb her depths lest she  overset the cart of the apple. Now, Helga, out with it. Don&rsquo;t say Mr. Murray  killed his wife, don&rsquo;t dare to hint it, but tell what makes you think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though in awe of the stern look on the faces of both men,  Helga was ready to tell her story truly and promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About four weeks ago,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;Mr. Murray was reading  a book in the library. He threw it across the room. He often does that. It hit  a wee table and upset it, glass vase of flowers and all. The vase broke, the  water spilled and the book was soaked sloppy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went for a cloth and began to wipe up the wet, when Mr.  Murray looked up and asked what I was doing. I told him and then he talked to  me a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; asked Scott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About my kitten. It got hurted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just where does the wife murder come in?&rdquo; Scott said,  coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; and Helga&rsquo;s voice dropped lower. &ldquo;I cleaned up all  the wet and the broken glass and all, and as the book was all soppy wet, I hung  it out in the sun to dry. And when I took it back to Mr. Murray, he shouted at  me to throw it away, he never wanted to see it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I kept it myself and read it, and&mdash;ooh!&mdash;it was awful.  All about the man who kilt his wife, and all through it Mr. Murray had turned  down pages and marked places on the edge of the leaves, and yet the outside was  all nice and pretty so I kept it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t the cover soaked too?&rdquo; Scott wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see the book fell on the floor, open, and then  the vase smashed right on top of it, on the open place, and it soaked the  pages, but the cover most not at all. Was there any harm in my keeping it? If  you want it, I&rsquo;ll bring it back. I have it still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Helga,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;You bring it to me, and don&rsquo;t rub  it or try to clean it up any more than you have. Any more to your story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no sir. Except I liked that book terrible, and&mdash;  must I tell, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I looked on the shelves to see if there were  any more stories about a man murderin&rsquo; his wife, and there was a lot of &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All standing together?&rdquo; Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know! Yes, they was. All in a row. I read &rsquo;em  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you allowed access to the library shelves?&rdquo; Scott  said, in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, aren&rsquo;t you, Helga?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Stone. We can all take books offen the library  shelves if we like. Not many do, though. Simmons, he reads Westerns, and I like  the detective stories. I like the bungstarter kind best&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the gangbuster kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, that&rsquo;s what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Helga, carry on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helga sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I heard a lot of things. You see, I can&rsquo;t help it.  I have to go in and out of the rooms and they never notice me. They&rsquo;re so used  to me they never stop their talk when I come in, and so I can&rsquo;t help hearing. I  never tell anything, not even to Mrs. Mendel, but I can&rsquo;t help hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t, Helga,&rdquo; Stone spoke kindly; &ldquo;and you  are right to tell us whatever you heard. Any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, sir, Miss Tonka she sorta caught on that Mr.  Murray he read so many detective stories about killing his wife, and she  pretended he meant to kill his own wife. Why, one day, Mr. Murray, he said to Mrs.  Murray, &lsquo;Thank the Lord, Isabel, that you have fair hair and blue eyes,  otherwise I&rsquo;d have to kill you.&rsquo; And she said, &lsquo;I could bleach it,&rsquo; and he only  laughed and kissed her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me, Helga,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;that contradicts your  theory. If Mr. Murray admired fair hair and blue eyes, then he had no reason to  kill his blonde wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helga looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but there was times when Mr. Murray  would get real mad at her. You see, she nagged him. Some men, they don&rsquo;t like  to be nagged at. Once, she had said awful mean things to him, and he just broke  loose, and he said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Helga,&rdquo; Scott said, abruptly, &ldquo;tell what  you started to, but be very sure you are telling the cxact truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I am. Well, she was like a little hell-cat, if  you know what I mean, and he grabbed her by the shouldcrs and shook her and  said, &lsquo;when I do kill you, Isabel, would you rather be strangled or poisoned?&rsquo;  &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did Mrs. Murray reply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She just laughed and snuggled into his arms and he kissed  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see it meant nothing, he was just jollying her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you say, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have opportunity to overhear a great deal,&rdquo; Stone put  in; &ldquo;I hope, Helga, you never repeat any of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, sir. But how can I help overhearing? I must be  in and out of the living-room all the time, and they will keep right on  talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see; you can&rsquo;t help it. And yet, knowing that Mr. Murray  was only fooling when he teased Mrs. Murray, you still think he killed her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he, sir?&rdquo; Helga&rsquo;s blue eyes were simply inquiring.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Helga, of course not. You mustn&rsquo;t expect to  understand the ways of ladies and gentlemen. They often say just the opposite  of what they mean. You cannot judge. You come of peasant people and you must  not think at all about your betters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone knew Helga&rsquo;s position and he knew her  limited outlook on life, so he spoke plainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, that is so. They do talk queer. Miss Tonka,  now, she&rsquo;s all the time jollying Mr. Murray. She says, every time he brings  home a new book, &lsquo;Another treatise on how to kill your wife?&rsquo; and then they  both laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Murray in love with Miss Mead?&rdquo; Scott inquired,  casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir! Sometimes he doesn&rsquo;t even speak to her. I  think he likes her a little better than he used to, because she has been so  good to Mrs. Murray. But he scorns her mostly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Miss Mead continue to live at Longacre?&rdquo; Scott was  trying to make hay while the Swedish sun shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s going to do. She doesn&rsquo;t know  herself. Maybe she will go home with Mrs. Bingham and live with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s enough about the family and their  prospects,&rdquo; Stone said, smiling at Scott. &ldquo;You run along, now, Helga, and don&rsquo;t  tell anyone you have been here, if you can help it. Just why did you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night I was in the hall, waiting for Simmons, and  then we were both taking trays into the living-room. And while I waited there,  just outside the door, I heard them talking and Miss Tonka, she asked if  anybody knew anything and didn&rsquo;t tell it, would they go to jail. And Mrs. Bingham  and everybody said they would. And Simmons came and we both went in with our  trays, and they kept on talking about jail and all, so that&rsquo;s why I went to  look at the jail. It isn&rsquo;t nice at all, I thought it would be more like a  hotel. But I don&rsquo;t want to go there, so I came to tell. And I&rsquo;ve told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told much, Helga,&rdquo; Stone observed. &ldquo;Only that  Mr. Murray joked his wife about making believe to kill her. You know yourself  he didn&rsquo;t mean it, but as you say, it was right for you to tell us. Now you  forget it, and don&rsquo;t say or think another word about it. I&rsquo;ll see to it that  you don&rsquo;t go to jail, but if you overhear anything again, you&rsquo;d better tell me.  Mind now, keep this all under your hat. If you don&rsquo;t&mdash;if you babble to anybody,  you may land in jail yet. Promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mr. Stone. I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it to  anybody, I&rsquo;m sure. Mrs. Mendel and Simmons and me, we don&rsquo;t gossip in the  servants&rsquo; hall. That Jenny, she tries to, but we don&rsquo;t answer her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Jenny be leaving now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe Miss Tonka will keep her on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Helga; run along now. Keep your own counsel,  and you&rsquo;ll keep out of jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red and green object went away, and the two men looked  at each other inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the girl,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;and I know the Murrays like her very  much. But I mean as to her work and behavior. I don&rsquo;t believe Mrs. Murray or  Tonka ever thought of her as a human being, listening to their talk and having  any opinions of her own about themselves. To people like the Murrays servants are inanimate objects, to be  used when needed, like a sewing machine or lawn mower, and the rest of the time  ignored and forgotten. Of course, no one talks really secret affairs before the  servants, but that very fact goes to prove that Leif&rsquo;s idea of the general  subject of wife-killing was far from serious and merely a byword of some sort.  And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet I myself heard Isabel Murray&rsquo;s last words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looked straight at her husband who was standing at  the bedside, and she said, &lsquo;after years of devotion, then to murder me!&rsquo; But we  must remember she was not entirely sane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she died right after that speech?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a few moments. But she said no other word. It  can&rsquo;t mean anything for they were really a devoted pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as you know.&rdquo; Scott spoke slowly as if weighing  his words. &ldquo;And you know that in cases of insanity, the patient often becomes  sane at the last and speaks rationally once and then dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make it sound melodramatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is melodramatic, but true. Ask any doctor who has to  do with insane patients and he will tell you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve often heard it. And I may as well tell you, I  have a list, made out in the sick room of Mrs. Murray, of all the things she  said that had any bearing on her illness. Not rambling talk or flighty speeches  but just her exclamations or confidences to the nurses or to Miss Mead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;remember you&rsquo;ll be put in jail if you don&rsquo;t tell &mdash;and  were any speeches recorded that might tend to make it seem that Mrs. Murray was  being murdered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are records of things said by Mrs. Murray that  might be taken to mean that. But I put no credence in them as the poor lady was  entirely irresponsible and much of the report shows that she talked at random,  saying anything that came into her head. Her poor distorted brain could easily  have mistaken her husband for someone else and she may have meant to accuse her  real murderer, who most certainly was not Leif Murray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Scott. And I am willing, anxious to make  inquiries and find out. But let us walk delicately. That man has had and is  having trouble enough, without any unjust accusations flung his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean, we must make our investigations secretly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as possible, yes. And remember our limitations.  That Horner medico told me that Mrs. Murray died of the effects of excessive  use of X-rays. And he said that only a doctor experienced in that branch of  science could have administered the treatments. Now where are we? Doctor  Craddock, her family physician, certainly had no reason to murder one of his  most desirable patients, for Isabel was everlastingly calling him in for some  minor ailment. And, too, if he had given her a long series of treatments, her  husband must have known of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you propose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First that we talk it over with the Chief and get his  views, and then do some real sleuthing over at Longacre. That would mean  clearing out the people, but if necessary that can be done. I am working on the  Tolman case, you know, but that&rsquo;s no reason I can&rsquo;t take up this new  investigation too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re some dynamo, and I&rsquo;m proud to work with you. What  comes first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A straightaway talk with Murray himself. I think if we  put it to him squarely, he will help us&mdash;that is, in the event of his being  innocent, which I am betting that he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who then, is the guilty party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for us to discover. I have heard hints of  incompetent practitioners in the Beauty Parlors, but I don&rsquo;t think much of that  notion. No worthwhile Beauty Parlor would dare have an inefficient or inexpert  worker, and Mrs. Murray would never go to any such place but the best. Nor do I  think the wretch who gave her the X-ray treatment was necessarily a doctor. The  villain who killed her, was so smart and so ingenious, that he could have  learned how to work a portable X-ray and perhaps have carried out his deadly  purpose even without Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s own knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t draw too long a bow. She must have known he was  doing something to her. I say! how about a camera? She thought he was taking  pictures when he was giving her treatments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are thinking of her husband as the criminal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe and maybe not. Everybody is camera conscious these  days. Everybody is taking pictures or being taken. Any way, it&rsquo;s an idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And far be it from me to scorn it. It is a possibility,  I&rsquo;ll go that far. I heard Mrs. Murray say once that Humbert Paley was  everlastingly taking her picture when she didn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are! I don&rsquo;t mean Paley is the murderer, but if  one man can take pictures and not let the subject know it, another can do the  same thing, apparently, yet have an X-ray machine disguised as a camera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it would have to be her husband or someone living in  the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the Tonka person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too easy. To dispose of the lady and marry the surviving  husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonka is too dumb for such a clever dodge.&rdquo; Stone smiled  at the idea. &ldquo;Come along, Scott, let&rsquo;s have a hobnob with the Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  Leif Goes To Jail</b></h2>
<p>THAT afternoon, there was a conference at Longacre.</p>
<p>It had to do with the futures of the three people who were  doing the conferring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do look at it rationally,&rdquo; Aunt Phoebe was saying, with  her usual air of authority. &ldquo;I must go home soon to look after Joseph. Now, if  Tonka goes with me and spends the winter, that settles her. If you take a good  long trip abroad, you will be doing what you have long wanted to do. If it were  not for Joseph, Tonka and I could go with you. But that is out of the question.  Poor Joseph cannot live very long, not more than a few months, the doctors say.  You can&rsquo;t stay here alone in this big house. You could come up to Quebec and live with us,  but I doubt you&rsquo;d like that. Yet we must come to some agreement, for I must go  home, and you can&rsquo;t stay here alone with Tonka. Can you, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Leif said, gloomily. &ldquo;But I can stay here alone  without Tonka. You take her home with you, and I&rsquo;ll stay here with the same  servants we&rsquo;ve had so long. I&rsquo;ll be lonely, of course, but I&rsquo;d be that wherever  I am. And I can go off on the yacht, or take a small apartment in New York, to run down to  for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elaine came then, and demanded to know what the so serious  confab was all about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ways and means,&rdquo; Leif told her, and then they began it  all over again.</p>
<p>With her tendency to cut Gordian knots, Elaine said at  once. &ldquo;Too easy. You go abroad, Leif, that&rsquo;s the only way for you to pick up  your life and go on with it. Then Tonka can make a choice. Go up to Quebec and live with  Aunt Phoebe, or come and live with me. Or if she likes better, stay part of the  time with me and part of it in Quebec.  Anyway, try that plan and see how it works out. What say, Tonka?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say, Elaine. Can&rsquo;t we let the matter  wait over a day or two? I can&rsquo;t seem to pull myself together. I&rsquo;ve been looking  over Isabel&rsquo;s things. She had such lovely clothes, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I propose you take some of them, Elaine,&rdquo; Leif said.  &ldquo;Tonka must have her furs and laces, but there are some frocks that neither  Tonka nor Aunt Phoebe can wear, and they&rsquo;ll just fit you, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Leif, I&rsquo;d love to have some of her things. We used to  talk over what we&rsquo;d leave each other in our wills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. You and Tonka fix it up, whenever you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come over tonight, then, and I&rsquo;ll bring a suitcase  and take home a few. There are two or three I like especially, and I&rsquo;ll love to  wear them because they were Isabel&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Elaine. Gosh! here comes Stone. I want to see  him, but he has friends with him. No, don&rsquo;t go, Elaine. I&rsquo;ll see them in my  study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Leif was mistaken on that point, for the two men with  Stone were Detective Scott and Chief Inspector Watkins, and they seemed bent on  quick action.</p>
<p>The Inspector stepped up to Leif, and putting a hand on  his shoulder, said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, Mr. Murray, but I have to arrest you on  charge of murder. Anything you say may be used as evidence. I hope you will go  with me quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I go any other way, Inspector? May I ask what  evidence you have in proof of my guilt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here and now. Come along, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may pack a bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Don&rsquo;t be too long about it. Go with him, Scott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men went upstairs.</p>
<p>Tonka flew across the room, and flung herself down on the  sofa beside Aunt Phoebe, who put an arm round her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me, Mr. Stone, what this means?&rdquo; Mrs. Bingham  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that Inspector Watkins has learned of some  evidence which makes him believe Mr. Murray is a criminal. The arrest is the  first step in the process of finding out whether Mr. Murray is guilty or  innocent. As I am already working on the case in his interests, I shall  continue to do all I can to have the suspect soon set free?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, can you do that?&rdquo; Elaine exclaimed. &ldquo;I shall be so  glad to have him freed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you taking him away now?&rdquo; Tonka asked in a shaking  voice. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say we are,&rdquo; the Inspector said, as kindly  as he could, for he was convinced of Murray&rsquo;s  guilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it!&rdquo; Tonka cried out, and she ran away to  her own room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Aunt Phoebe said, as Elaine rose to follow.  &ldquo;Tonka hates to be petted. Leave her alone with her sorrow, it&rsquo;s the kindest  way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone said no word, but went into Leifs study and closed  the door.</p>
<p>He looked over some papers, but his principal work was to  put things away in drawers and pigeon holes, and lock the desk and the files  and whatever he deemed needed locking. He was sure Giles Trumbull would take  the case, as he was Leif&rsquo;s friend and a famous lawyer.</p>
<p>Something he saw on the floor made him first smile and then  look very surprised and almost frightened.</p>
<p>He went back to the living-room just as Leif came downstairs  with Scott.</p>
<p>There was no occasion for the assistance of the Sergeant,  who appeared unexpectedly, for Murray  went without objection.</p>
<p>He bowed to his aunt and to Elaine, waved his hand to  them, and with a nod to Stone, he went away.</p>
<p>Stone looked after them as they left, said a few words to  Scott, and remained with Aunt Phoebe and Elaine. He looked very grave and  speaking slowly, he said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If either of you know anything about this whole matter  that has not been brought to my attention, I hope you will tell me. I am fully  convinced of Murray&rsquo;s  innocence, but it is going to be difficult to convince a judge or jury. I have  a feeling that somebody is working against us, that an enemy is trying to  thwart my efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leif is his own worst enemy,&rdquo; Aunt Phoebe said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve  no idea, Elaine, how carelessly he seems to take it all. He doesn&rsquo;t, really, I  know that, but he acts as if he was in no danger. I&rsquo;ll bet, even now, he&rsquo;s  calmly sitting in his cell asking the warden if he can have a bigger ashtray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we go to see him, Mr. Stone?&rdquo; Elaine asked, ignoring  the old lady&rsquo;s chatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see about that. Of course, there are visitors&rsquo; days  and a lot of red tape, but I think Scott and I can get around the rules and  regulations. I didn&rsquo;t want them to arrest him, but after all, it will expedite  matters, and we may get along more rapidly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me, Fleming Stone,&rdquo; said Aunt Phoebe, with a  little quiver in her voice; &ldquo;do you honestly believe you can get my boy off?  I&rsquo;ve thought things over a lot, and while we all know he loved Isabel dearly,  and wouldn&rsquo;t harm a hair of her head, yet there are things that I know will  look suspicious to some people. Leif had enemies, I mean just people who  disliked him. He was curt, sometimes rude, to those he didn&rsquo;t like and it may  react against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about that, Mrs. Bingham,&rdquo; Stone agreed. &ldquo;It  is an unfortunate fact that Mr. Murray was independent in lots of ways, and he  was ready to pick a quarrel if occasion turned up. But this was only with men  whom he definitely disliked. Or men who had offended him purposely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I often told Leif to be more friendly with the people he  didn&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; Elaine said; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no use making enemies unnecessarily. I  think I&rsquo;ll be going now, Aunt Phoebe. Mr. Stone may want to talk with you  alone. You think I&rsquo;d better not speak to Tonka before I go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Mrs. Bingham said; &ldquo;go up to her room, anyway.  And look over Isabel&rsquo;s things with her. Get her interested in something. Poor  child, I don&rsquo;t know what to do with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elaine went off and Aunt Phoebe looked helplessly at  Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she said, piteously. &ldquo;Leif was my  stand-by, I felt no responsibility so long as he was at the helm. But now, I am  like a ship without a rudder. Look at it squarely, Mr. Stone. I am needed at  home to care for my husband, who is very ill with an incurable disease. He may  die soon or he may linger for some months yet. But I ought to be with him and I  want to be with him. Yet I want to stand by Leif, and I must care for Tonka. Do  you advise me to let Tonka go to live with Elaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t decide that today, Mrs. Bingham. There may be  developments soon that will let us see more clearly how to act. Can you stay  away from home a few days longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; you see Mr. Bingham&rsquo;s mind is not entirely  clear, and he does not miss me as he would if he were himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, dear lady; now you just stay quietly here with  Tonka for a few days and then I will know better how to advise you. And keep up  a good heart for we may be able to bring Leif Murray through with bells on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Bingham, and maybe not. Don&rsquo;t say that to Tonka,  though. To her speak only hopefully, even certainly of his speedy release. By  the way was the rector over here today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; Aunt Phoebe looked a little startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;yes. He ran over this morning for a short call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leif is good friends with him, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. They like each other immensely. Tell me more  about&mdash;about where Leif is. Can we take or send him things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think so. I doubt if he&rsquo;ll like the food. Their  cooks are not like you have here. But it can be arranged to have his meals sent  to him, I&rsquo;m sure. If you are called home suddenly, let me know before you plan  anything. I will come at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Make no plans for Tonka without my  knowledge. And don&rsquo;t let her go to other houses. Nor see callers. That blessed  child can&rsquo;t help telling all she knows, even if she promises not to. She&rsquo;s an  odd piece but I think I understand her, and I like her lots. I&rsquo;m going now, and  I&rsquo;ll see you again tomorrow, and I may have news for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elaine came down then, and said that Tonka had brightened  up a bit as they overlooked Isabel&rsquo;s wardrobe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think if she can be kept interested in something, she  will be a lot better,&rdquo; Aunt Phoebe said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Elaine agreed; &ldquo;we picked out the things I am to  have. I&rsquo;m coming over this evening to get them. I shall bring a suit case for  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send Simmons with them,&rdquo; Aunt Phoebe said, and  Elaine thanked her, and then she went along home. Stone, leaving at the same  time walked along with her. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, looking up at him, with eyes  full of tears, &ldquo;is there anything I can do, Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of anything, Mrs. Vernon,&rdquo; he returned, in a  kind voice. &ldquo;I know how hard it is to stand idly by, and do nothing to help.  But you can see for yourself there is little that can be done by anybody. My  work for him is important, but I can&rsquo;t rush at it, as I would like to do. I  have to wait for this or that condition or for some bit of information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leif will have a lawyer, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Giles Trumbull will take over and he will get  any assistance he needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be the talk of the town,&rdquo; and Elaine sighed  deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear it will. So we who are his friends must guide the  talk into the right channels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes. I always feel like giving thanks that I am  not of the impulsive sort who give everything away every time they open their  mouths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor of the sort who tell things that are not meticulously  true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a good keeper of secrets,&rdquo; and Elaine gave him a  little smile. &ldquo;By the way, Mr. Stone, are you making any progress with the  Tolman case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little. Slow but sure has to be the slogan for  that puzzle. Would you be surprised to learn that I have a sort of notion that  those two crimes are connected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It surprises me very much. Do you mean the same person  committed the two murders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said that. There is a missing link. Until I can  find that link, I can&rsquo;t come to a positive conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I help? Really, Mr. Stone, my father used to say I  have some real detective instincts, and if you would trust me with some of your  minor problems I might be of good help to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you for that offer, Mrs. Vernon. I may be glad to  ask your assistance. Do you know anything about X-rays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elaine looked disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I meant I could question people  or track down clues. I know little of medicine and nothing at all of scientific  gadgets or contraptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father left quite a lot of paraphernalia and  instruments, I heard somebody say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody who knows more than I do about Dad&rsquo;s things. But  I know who it must have been. That new doctor who has just come to town. I  forget his name, but he lives way down in the valley. He won&rsquo;t cut out Dr  Craddock, but he will build up a practice among the younger generation.  Craddock is getting along in years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know this new man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he wants to buy father&rsquo;s surgery instruments or  some of them. He sent a message by Doctor Craddock to know if I would consider  the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just now. I can&rsquo;t bother about it at present. I want  Tonka to visit me, and I mean to try to cheer her up. I plan to take her on  little motor trips, and beach weekends, and I want to be free to entertain  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of you to do that. The girl needs looking after, and  Aunt Bingham doesn&rsquo;t seem to me the one to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you. This is my corner, Mr. Stone.  Good morning, and remember I am to help you in your work. I don&rsquo;t want to be  intrusive, but I want to do anything I can for Leif and Tonka.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will remember. Good morning, Mrs. Vernon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her as she turned and walked away. What an  energetic person she was, to be sure. And very good-looking.</p>
<p>But her picture quickly faded as he neared the jail. Leif  Murray was in there. Murray  with his riches, his beautiful home, and until lately his beautiful wife.</p>
<p>To himself he repeated the words he had heard Isabel say:  years of devotion&mdash;and then to murder me!</p>
<p>Clearly she knew she had been put to death. Had been the  victim of wilful murder.</p>
<p>Yet conditions didn&rsquo;t seem right.</p>
<p>If Isabel had been killed by the intentional over  application of X-rays, how could Leif compass that?</p>
<p>Horner had said, or somebody had, that such a death could  be brought about only by a doctor. Nobody knew of Doctor Craddock having  attempted to cure Isabel by such a new-fangled method. Stay, how about the new  chap? The one who wanted to buy the apparatus that had belonged to Elaine&rsquo;s  father? He had not heard of this man before, and if he had treated Isabel for  anything, in any way, surely it would have been spoken of during those hospital  days at Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Still, he must look into it. If the moment seemed  propitious, he would ask Leif today.</p>
<p>He went on to the jail, went in, and soon found himself in  Leif&rsquo;s cell.</p>
<p>Up to date, the Ingleside jail had never had an inmate  guilty or even suspected of a heinous crime. Speeding and inebriety were the  usual, and even those were rare.</p>
<p>Leif had the best cell, to be sure, and it was neat, tidy  and sufficient. But sadly lacking in beauty, which was to Leif Murray the most  important thing in the universe.</p>
<p>There were two chairs, and in one of them Murray sat, for the first  time in his life looking absolutely down and out.</p>
<p>Stone sized up his attitude in one glance, but made no  reference to it.</p>
<p>Instead, he seated himself in the other chair, hard ones  both, and looking at his client, said, in a low voice;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you marry Tonka this morning, without telling me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone had surprised men before, in his life, but never had  he seen a client of his so utterly stunned with amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Marry Tonka?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that. All right, and I know you must have a good  reason, but I can&rsquo;t conduct your case properly unless I can keep abreast of  your moves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know I did? Tonka tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor Aunt Phoebe, nor anybody else. I deduced it.  What&rsquo;s the use of my being a detective if I can&rsquo;t detect? And what&rsquo;s the use of  detecting, if you run around doing things I don&rsquo;t know about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murray looked very grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was done on an impulse, Stone. But it is merely a <i>mariage de convenance</i>. I shall not hold  her to it. Don&rsquo;t look at me as if I were a brute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds brutish to me. Have you forgotten Isabel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Murray&rsquo;s  voice was low and very sad. &ldquo;It is a matter quite apart from Isabel. How did  you learn of it? I don&rsquo;t believe you discovered it yourself. How could you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way. After you left the house today, I remained for  a time. I went into your study, and on the floor I saw a grain of rice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one. But it seemed to me it could mean only one  thing. A wedding. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, but I wondered. I went back and joined  the others, and a casual question told me that the rector had been there this  morning. It seemed to me that two and two made a perfect four. But I found no  corroboration. I&rsquo;m asking you for the explanation, if any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any,&rdquo; and Leif looked despairing. &ldquo;That is,  nothing that I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell, then. Is it anything that will retard your  acquittal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose if the fact is known, it will militate against  me in any way. But, Stone, since the rector approved of it, and performed the  ceremony, I think you may believe it is all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to live with Tonka?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want the marriage kept secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. Inviolably so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up the case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that, but how can I go on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go on, Stone. I have done nothing wrong. Nothing  that insults the memory of Isabel. But you&rsquo;ll have to take my word for it. I am  willing to tell you all about it, and I will soon. I would do so right now, but  it&rsquo;s not alone my secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought before, Murray, that you were shielding somebody, and  this seems to corroborate my belief. Be careful how you take up such a deal as  that. I have seen more trouble come from a mistaken shielding of another person  than from many deeper reasons. I thought, too, perhaps you did it because a wife  need not testify against her husband. Is that the big idea? You are not  marrying Tonka because you love her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, for I don&rsquo;t altogether love her. I do like the child  better than I used to. She was very good to Isabel, and she seems more human of  late. I used to think her a natural. No, I hadn&rsquo;t thought that she might ever  be asked to testify against me. I don&rsquo;t think she would want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, certainly, you&rsquo;re not shielding her. Who is it  you&rsquo;re anxious about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a detective and a smart enough detective to  deduce that very private wedding ceremony, why can&rsquo;t you deduce whom I am  shielding, if any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I do know, but as a rule my clients are ready to  help me when I ask them to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Stone, real sorry, but if I am shielding anyone,  and mind I don&rsquo;t say that I am, I can&rsquo;t mention any name yet. Perhaps I can,  soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Murray.  I&rsquo;m trusting you that it is all right. When I don&rsquo;t trust you, I throw over the  case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you thrown over the Tolman case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m still working on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this matter of mine at the same time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I shall not be too surprised if there is a link  between the two cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that Paley killed Isabel! Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t yet said for publication that Paley killed  Tolman. But we&rsquo;ve enough to do with our own affairs. Let&rsquo;s have a serious  talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The serious talk lasted so long that Tonka and Aunt  Phoebe, who had been promised an evening call on Leif, arrived before Stone  left.</p>
<p>And that was why, when Elaine, with her suit case went over  to Longacre to get the dresses that had been Isabel&rsquo;s, there was no one there  to welcome her.</p>
<p>But she told Simmons that it was no matter, and she would  just go up to Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s room, where the dresses had been left, and take  them herself.</p>
<p>She was almost certain the servants were having their  dinner, and Simmons didn&rsquo;t deny it, so she ran lightly up the stairs, carrying  her suit case, and saying she would pack it herself and needed no help.</p>
<p>But before she finished, she rang for Helga, and asked her  help with some of the things.</p>
<p>Helga was a deft little person, and she stowed away the  pieces so cleverly, that she got them all in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t stay, ma&rsquo;am, till my ladies come home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Helga. You tell them that Mrs. Vernon took the  things, and that I will run over tomorrow to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, Mrs. Vernon, and I&rsquo;ll send this heavy suit  case over to your house this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Helga; it was light when I came, but it&rsquo;s  heavy now.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  The Missing Link</b></h2>
<p>FLEMING STONE spent most of that night thinking. He  sometimes thought of his work as a jigsaw puzzle, one of those large ones which  you keep laid out on the table, and work at different parts of it at different  times.</p>
<p>He had been diligently working at different parts of his  detective puzzle, and it was nearing the time when he could add a few  connecting pieces and make it come a coherent whole.</p>
<p>Through the night he had made plans for seeing a few  people, telephoning a few people, asking about a few people, and by utilizing  all the information he could acquire in those ways, he hoped to get his puzzle  so nearly complete, that he could jump to its conclusion.</p>
<p>Such jumping might be a dangerous feat for some  detectives, but Stone had his evidence so well in hand, his clues so carefully  tested, his beliefs so certain, that he was well prepared. Moreover, the  theories of which he was not certain he had not banked on, and so if they had  to be discarded it would not dislodge any of his staunch uprights.</p>
<p>About dawn he fell into a restful sleep, and woke, quite  ready for a busy day.</p>
<p>His first errand was to see Paul Tolman, and for this purpose  he invited Tolman to breakfast with him, on his little balcony.</p>
<p>Very pleasant it was, with the tree branches waving just  above their heads, and the scent of garden flowers coming up from the flower  beds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it for granted,&rdquo; Tolman was saying, &ldquo;that your new  problem of Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s death will not cause you to leave my case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may do just that,&rdquo; Stone returned. &ldquo;In fact, I hope  it will not be long now, before I can complete both of those solutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good hearing. You&rsquo;ve learned something new:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. Look here, man, you said most all your friends  could make a stab at ventriloquism. Can Elaine do it? Do you think Peter taught  her how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he tried to teach her but she couldn&rsquo;t learn. You  know not everybody can do it, even if they practice. Oh, they can do it in a  poor, inefficient way, but not so it would fool anybody. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do you think either of the Garrisons could?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim is a good ventriloquist, I know that. I don&rsquo;t know  about Fleda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had more or less trials of it while on the yacht, but  I daresay it was of no importance. Here&rsquo;s another thing. Is Paley a  photographer, or is Leopold Jewett?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Photographer? As a business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean do they run around with a camera, as so many  people do nowadays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess not. Weren&rsquo;t they on the yacht?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paley wasn&rsquo;t. Jewett was, but I didn&rsquo;t see him using a  camera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to know? Maybe I can find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do if you can. I want some pictures of Mrs. Murray, any  pictures of her, that were taken about four weeks ago. I know she had some  taken one Sunday afternoon at Mrs. Vernon&rsquo;s house, and I think Paley took them.  Can you find out without asking Mrs. Vernon directly? I don&rsquo;t want her to think  I&rsquo;m snooping. She&rsquo;s been so good answering my questions, and they generally  turn out to be futile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can work it. I go over there a lot. You see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, Tolman, I think I have seen it. You are a  victim to those soft brown eyes, and I am sure they look kindly on you. Does  she know that there is any suspicion of a flaw in the divorce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she doesn&rsquo;t and I hope she never will. It may  come out when Peter&rsquo;s murderer is found, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure it will come out then, but don&rsquo;t say anything  about it sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise, if you&rsquo;ll promise to push matters as fast as  you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that, for my own sake as much as for anyone else.  But don&rsquo;t you see, Tolman, if there is a serious flaw in the divorce decree,  then Mrs. Vernon is the widow of your brother and is entitled to a part, at  least, of his estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of that, and&mdash;well, if you&rsquo;ll keep it secret,  I&rsquo;ll confide in you that I do love Elaine, and I want her to marry me. I&rsquo;ve not  asked her yet, it&rsquo;s too soon after Peter&rsquo;s death, but I have reason to think  she likes me, and perhaps later on, she may say yes. And, look here, Stone,  don&rsquo;t you think I want her because she may be the heir to Peter&rsquo;s invention,  for I don&rsquo;t take much stock in that myself. But I loved Elaine even before  Peter did, and I feel I can win her in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, old man, and I think you are wise to go  slow; but if Elaine doesn&rsquo;t know there is a flaw in her divorce papers, she  won&rsquo;t apply for any share in Peter&rsquo;s estate, will she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but if she marries me, it won&rsquo;t matter. Perhaps I&rsquo;d  better speak to her soon, but I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;ll take offence if I seem too  impatient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a few days, anyhow. I&rsquo;m not neglecting your  business, but I am a bit busy with the Murray  case, and&mdash; listen to this, but keep it strictly under your hat&mdash;I feel that  there is a link of some sort between the two cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t! Why, such a thing isn&rsquo;t possible! Tell me how  you mean. I can see Paley killing Pete, though I don&rsquo;t now think he did; but I  can&rsquo;t see Paley doing in Mrs. Murray. He couldn&rsquo;t have been in love with her,  because he is heart and soul devoted to Elaine, and she knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she ask to have him included in Murray&rsquo;s yachting party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she isn&rsquo;t ready to show her feelings yet. Beside, she  had Leo Jewett on board, and she didn&rsquo;t want all her boy friends at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to possess a host of admirers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not? Beautiful, charming, and rich in her own  right. Her father left her a fortune, I have heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I understand. Perhaps she doesn&rsquo;t want any of your  brother&rsquo;s estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First human being I ever heard of then, who didn&rsquo;t want  any money that seemed to be headed her way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, things are moving, Mr. Tolman, and I&rsquo;ll ask as a  favor that you do nothing that you don&rsquo;t tell me about, for I have some traps  set, and I want to see how well they will work. Give me a couple of days  longer, and I think I&rsquo;ll have some news for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tolman agreed to this and went off to the Golf Club for a  spot of exercise.</p>
<p>Stone started to the jail for a session with Murray. He had arranged to  meet Trumbull  there and discuss the legal aspect of things.</p>
<p>But he stopped on his way, at Headquarters, where Scott  told him of a matter of decided importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Scott said, &ldquo;as soon as we were sure the death  weapon was an X-ray machine, I felt I must search for the equipment that had  been used. I was at a loss where to look, for there was no sense in asking  Doctor Craddock if he had put the lady away. I thought of other places, and  then I had a hunch to look in the most likely place and I found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You what?&rdquo; Fleming Stone stared at the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s sure. I went around to the Murray house very early this morning. Soon  after sunrise I went, and I waited until there seemed to be someone in the  kitchen or pantry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rapped softly at the back door, and the butler opened  it. I put the fear of God into him and I forced him by will power and by  threats to take me up to Leif Murray&rsquo;s room and also show me the lumber room or  attic or junk room of any sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, Scott,&rdquo; and Stone&rsquo;s eyes shone with interest.  &ldquo;Did you find anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scott spoke slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I did, my friend. I found a Portable X-ray,  short wave machine. It was on a shelf in the smaller attic, there are two, and  it was covered with an old leather cover that didn&rsquo;t fit it, and boxes were  piled on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; and Fleming Stone looked fairly stunned. &ldquo;Well, old  man, you&rsquo;ve thrown a monkey wrench in my gear. I looked for something of the  kind, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought we&rsquo;d find something of the sort!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, since that was the instrument used, we had to do our  damnedest to find it, of course. But I looked for different details of the  situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, Stone, don&rsquo;t minimize my find. I&rsquo;m so proud of  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have a right to be. I congratulate you from my  heart. But I have to readjust my decisions. Tell me again where it was? A  lumber room or a sort of laboratory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, nothing like a workshop. It was just a fairly big  room, clean and in good order, but apparently a store room. The X-ray sat on a  shelf, covered up as I said. I hardly knew what it was at first. I&rsquo;ve seen one  only once. I&rsquo;m pretty sure of my facts, but I want you to go up there and take  a look for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall. Well, I suppose you think that settles the  question of Leif Murray&rsquo;s guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I do. Shall we go over and question him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this morning. Give me the rest of today, Scott. I&rsquo;m  on a promising trail. Let&rsquo;s tell the chief, first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went in to the chiefs room only to find he was not in  the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going over to the jail,&rdquo; Stone said; but I have  another errand first, and I wish you&rsquo;d help me out. You go to the jail, and see  Murray. You  stay with him until I get there, it won&rsquo;t be long. And don&rsquo;t say anything about  this X-ray you found until I am there with you. Don&rsquo;t think I am stealing your  thunder, the matter is too serious for that. You discovered a most important  fact, and if you tell it too soon it will lose its importance. Can you believe  that? And will you do as I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will. I&rsquo;m proud to work with you, and I know  you are far above petty considerations. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone liked the whole-hearted faith Scott showed in him,  and he felt a return confidence.</p>
<p>The two men started together and soon separated. Scott  went to see Leif and Stone went to a public telephone and called Antony  Ballard. A few words with him, and then the detective went on his other and  more important errand and then back to the jail.</p>
<p>When Scott entered Leif&rsquo;s cell, he hadn&rsquo;t quite got rid of  the excitement he had felt at telling Stone of his prowess, and he nearly told Murray, so greatly did he  anticipate surprising him.</p>
<p>But he had promised Stone, so he said nothing of X-rays,  and instead, he spoke of the new doctor and asked if he had ever been to the Murray home,  professionally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Leif said, &ldquo;not professionally or socially either. I  never met him and I am sure my wife never did. We have had very little medical  attendance in our married life, and Doctor Craddock has always taken good care  of us.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The place is really large enough, I think, to support two  doctors,&rdquo; Scott said, and then Fleming Stone came in, and took charge of the  interview himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Murray,&rdquo;  he began, &ldquo;have you a portable X-ray among your belongings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. Nor a bricked-in one nor a self-starter.  Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mrs. Murray ever have one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. She was afraid of the things. I wish you&rsquo;d tell me  what you mean by these absurd questions. Just because somebody has jammed me  into this place with no reason for it, you needn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m an imbecile and  unable to understand what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Murray,&rdquo;  and Stone&rsquo;s voice was gentle, &ldquo;you are not taking this situation in quite the  right way. Try to realize that irrespective of your guilt or innocence you are  under arrest for the murder of your wife. There are many points that tell  against you, and the police authorities are strongly convinced that you are  guilty. You have asked me to take up the case and I am doing so, but I must have  your co-operation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must keep me more closely informed of your  progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; I agree to that, because many things are  happening and we must work together. Scott, you tell Mr. Murray about the X-ray  you found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Scott told his story, and Murray listened with such excited amazement  that his hearers felt it could not be feigned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absurd!&rdquo; Leif cried; &ldquo;tell me again just where you found  it. On which shelf, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the next to lowest shelf, to the right of the window.  It was next to an old clock. Not a grandfather&rsquo;s clock, but a big mantel clock,  the kind with a moon coming out of the clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Leif said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have that clock  overhauled some day, so it will go. And you say this dingbat stood next the  clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stands there still. I didn&rsquo;t touch it. It has a cover  on it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. That&rsquo;s the cover that belongs to my typewriter.  That&rsquo;s the place my typewriter stands, or ought to. But I took it with me on  the cruise, and it hasn&rsquo;t been put away. It&rsquo;s downstairs yet. I didn&rsquo;t take the  oilcloth cover, I kept it in its box. The sea air is bad for it. And you tell  me somebody planted an X-ray machine in its place? I don&rsquo;t get it. Why, I left  orders that Simmons should give that lumber room a thorough overhauling while  we were away, and have it scrubbed and cleaned. You ask Simmons if it was there  when they cleaned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could have put it there?&rdquo; Scott wondered. &ldquo;It must  have been someone in the house. No one from outside could store that thing in  the house and then go there and train it on Mrs. Murray. How does it work? Does  the patient have to hold it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Stone said: &ldquo;it works something like a camera. But  it could not have been used by anyone in the house, or somebody must have seen  the performance. It&rsquo;s no snapshot business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could the lady use it herself?&rdquo; Scott went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so; and as Mrs. Murray disliked the  performance and as we have no reason to think she wanted to kill herself, we  can&rsquo;t look that way. Now, see here, Leif, since you are looked upon as guilty  by the powers that be, many of them, and with reason, you ought to do a little  necessary explaining. Why, in your own home have you sometimes threatened to  kill your own wife?&rdquo; Murray  stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going pretty far to find evidence if you quote  jolly nonsense that I often used to tease Isabel with. I know, I think, what  you mean. I am a reader of detective stories, and of late many of them have  been founded on the plot of wife murder. Tonka teased me about it&mdash; we all tease  each other at our house&mdash;and I used to pretend to choke Isabel, just for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you collected story books about wife murderers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not collected. I have a liking for detective stories, and  I like those that are by the best writers. It happens that some of the best  writers of late have used the plot of Uxoricide, and when it is done well it  makes a thrilling story. But if I read a story of a man killing his best  friend, I don&rsquo;t run out and murder Giles Trumbull or Antony Ballard. It seems  to me pretty silly to think I&rsquo;d kill my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why the X-ray in your lumber room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea. Someone must have put it there. I state I  did not murder my wife&mdash;I swear it. I have no argument, I make no confessions, I  did not take Isabel&rsquo;s life and I don&rsquo;t know who did. I don&rsquo;t know what Isabel  meant by that seeming accusation of me on her death bed, but God is my witness  I did not kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too bad,&rdquo; Scott said, &ldquo;that there are such telling  facts against you. You threatened many times to kill her; you continually read  books that described ways to do it; you have in your possession the sort of  thing that killed her. She denounced you with her last words, and yet you  declare you are innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must remember Isabel&rsquo;s mind was affected when she  spoke that last sentence she ever uttered. She was murdered, she must have  been; but it was not I who did it, and she did not think I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is probably true,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;I have lists, made  by the hospital nurse, and by Tonka, and there are dozens of things Mrs. Murray  said, that show clearly they were the speech of an unhinged mind. To be sure,  she had sane moments now and then, but her mind was gone and she talked at  random. Now I&rsquo;ve a few more errands to attend to and a few experiments to make  and then this evening I want to hold a powwow at Longacre, I think we may learn  a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giles Trumbull came to talk legal matters with Leif, and  Stone went away.</p>
<p>As to the finding of the X-ray in Leifs room, Trumbull said at once it  was planted there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But by whom?&rdquo; he added, casting a glance around. Only  Leif and the detective Scott were there, and they had no reply to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Trumbull  went on, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s bound to come out. I think a canvass of the servants would soon  show that. Nobody could walk into the house with a big parcel like that and not  be seen. Probably put there while the family were on the yacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; Scott said, rising to go. &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;ll leave  you two to your confab. Make your will, Murray.  Much trouble comes when a man dies without making a will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Graceful allusion,&rdquo; Trumbull  thought, as the detective went away. But he said nothing about it and turned  the subject to business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could be at that powwow tonight,&rdquo; Leif said,  pathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could, old chap. But I&rsquo;ll report every word  that is said. And I think Stone has something up his sleeve. That&rsquo;s a way he  has, you know. Get those interested together, and then spring a surprise on  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell me all that goes on. I say, Giles, this is  rotten business, keeping me here on suspicion, when there&rsquo;s nothing to  suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They think they have enough. Leif, haven&rsquo;t you any tiny  hint to give as to who the killer might have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None definite or certain enough to mention. You say a  word and first you know you&rsquo;re quoted as telling the most astounding things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then they turned to the questions to be considered in  case Leif Murray has proved to have been guilty of his wife&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>Stone did his small accumulation of errands and then  turned back to the Inn. He was deeply  engrossed in his thoughts and was watching his step with meticulous care.</p>
<p>At the Inn he found  Paley, and collecting Tolman, the men went for a game of golf.</p>
<p>It was Stone&rsquo;s habit to take some open air exercise before  a conference that would call for great mental concentration.</p>
<p>But even though the golf was exhilarating its effects  seemed to have worn off when he started for Longacre that evening.</p>
<p>For one reason he felt a little apprehensive because he  was going to attempt a new sort of detection. It might succeed and it might prove  a dead failure.</p>
<p>In the big living-room there gathered a lot of people who  knew Leif Murray, and who were all interested in his present situation.</p>
<p>Some were there to help, some to hinder, and Fleming Stone  could easily read enmity on some of the faces.</p>
<p>The rector was there, and Doctor Craddock. Tolman and  Paley, sitting either side of Elaine. Aunt Phoebe and Tonka on a sofa side by  side, and the two Garrisons near by.</p>
<p>Trumbull was there and Antony Ballard,  Jewett, and of course, Scott and Fleming Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While this can scarcely be called a social gathering,&rdquo;  Stone began, &ldquo;I propose to start off with a social entertainment. One which was  popular many years ago, and whose popularity seems to be revived just now. I  mean, a Spelling Bee. The sort they have on the radio. Do not be afraid, the  words will not be very hard, yet they are not all easy. Mrs. Garrison, I  appoint you and Mr. Paley Captains of the two sides and you will please choose  your spellers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little bewildered, Fleda chose Ballard first, and Paley  chose Elaine. They went on alternately, until all were standing in two lines.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone gave out the words. As he had said, they  were not terrors, but some were tricky. More spellers failed on household words  like fricasse, desiccated, and harassed, than on more unusual words. Fleda  missed nearly every word given her, and Elaine was well nigh perfect. Then,  spelling down, many dropped by the wayside, till Elaine and Antony Ballard  stood alone.</p>
<p>Several words Stone gave them and Ballard coped successfully  with exegesis, Scheherazade and houyhn-hnms.</p>
<p>Elaine, sure of her letters, spelled correctly, fluoroscope,  inductotherm, diathermy and comprex.</p>
<p>Then Antony  missed on plaguy and Elaine spelled it right, and was declared winner.</p>
<p>Then Stone said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all of the social part of our program, and now  the questions I ask will be serious ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been diligently seeking the person who murdered Mrs.  Murray and also the person who killed Peter Tolman. Has anyone here any  information to offer about these two deaths? No one speaks, then I will tell  you that I have discovered who is responsible for them. You may be surprised to  learn it was the same person who committed both murders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am surprised at that,&rdquo; said Jim Garrison. &ldquo;I understood  Tolman died from prussic acid poisoning and Mrs. Murray from over treatment of  X-rays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right in both respects, Mr. Garrison, but both  deaths were brought about by the same murderer. I will tell you about it, and  if anyone chooses to interrupt, or ask a question, I shall be perfectly willing  to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As some of you may know, the X-ray apparatus that killed Mrs.  Murray, is at present in a room in her own home. This has been taken to prove  that Mr. Murray is the criminal, but that is not so. The X-ray is in this house  now, but it was not here when it performed its deadly work on Mrs. Murray. The  treatment was given some four weeks or so before the resultant death occurred.  Only one treatment was given, but that was such a long one that no other was  necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The human being who cleverly killed Mrs. Murray, did so  with malice aforethought. It was a clever piece of work. Few would have thought  of the long treatment that would prove fatal, but, after a space of four weeks  or more. Few could face the thought of that beautiful woman slowly fading away,  slowly becoming a wreck of her former self, a stricken, demented creature,  denuded of her beauty and her brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, the same inhuman, diabolically clever mind  conceived the plan of killing Peter Tolman with an instrument never to be  suspected. Who but a devil incarnate would utilize the man&rsquo;s taste for peach  kernels to turn it into a means of death? Yet that is the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The murderer is in this room. The murderer sits here  among us. Will the murderer confess or shall I pronounce the name?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No response? Then I will tell you how it came about, and  how I found it out. Consider a case of this sort. Imagine two men and two  women. Let us call them A and B, also C and D. A and B are married to each  other, and C and D are also man and wife. Now, suppose one of the women is in  love with the man who is not her husband. That is, suppose C the wife of D is  in love with A the husband of B. To win him, to marry him, C must be rid of  both B the wife of the man she cares for, and also D, her own husband. Is not  that a large order, to put out of existence two living persons so that she can  marry the man she wants? Yet that is what the murderer of Mrs. Murray did  accomplish. Have you grasped it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely,&rdquo; Paul Tolman said, in a shaking voice. &ldquo;Are  you telling me my brother was killed by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By his one-time wife?&rdquo; Fleming Stone said. &ldquo;Yes, I am. Mrs.  Vernon killed Peter Tolman by giving him peach kernels in an envelope. I have  the envelope. One of these kernels had an extra dose of prussic acid put into  it by means of a hypodermic needle. Mr. Tolman ate the kernels, and when he  came to the fatal one, he died almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, Mrs. Vernon is the murderer of Mrs. Murray. I had  almost proved this, entirely so to my own satisfaction, but to make assurance  doubly sure, I used a final test this evening. As you know, the doctors agreed  that the death by X-rays must have been brought about by a physician or a  layman highly skilled in that line of modern science. Mrs. Vernon is the  daughter of the late Doctor Vernon, who, as some of you remember was one of the  most famous doctors of his generation. He was ahead of his time in the use of  modem discoveries, and his daughter was both interested and experienced in his  practices. She planned the awful death of her long time friend by a method as  horrible as it was clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush your lies!&rdquo; The words were fairly screamed at him by  Elaine Vernon, who was seemingly turned into a veritable fiend. &ldquo;You cannot say  such things and get away with them! You lie!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I have proof, Mrs. Vernon,&rdquo; Stone said, so quietly that  it calmed the frantic woman a little. &ldquo;Do you remember the Sunday afternoon  that Isabel Murray sat for more than an hour in the large chair that is in your  living-room? It is right beside a bookcase. In that bookcase you had concealed  the X-ray machine, knowing that if you kept her sitting beside it long enough,  she would be poisoned from the effects and would eventually die as she did die.  In that bookcase, not a foot away from her lovely face, the X-ray did its  deadly work, and she felt no discomfort. Mr. Paley came in, as you may  remember. He chatted with you two ladies for a while then he took your  pictures, and he went away. This is, I am sure, clear to your memory, for you  cannot forget how you sat there murdering your friend. I have gained this  knowledge bit by bit from various sources, but all authentic, and&mdash;you cannot  deny any part of what I have said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elaine said no word of confession, she looked at Stone  scornfully and said, &ldquo;You have it all wrong. You great Detectives always get  things wrong, though you think yourselves so smart. I admit nothing. I decline  to speak until I have had the advice of a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go on with the tale of your crime, Mrs. Vernon.&rdquo;  Stone spoke as if he had not heard her. &ldquo;You are one of the four married people  I spoke of. You wanted to marry Leif Murray. To do so you had to get rid of  both Isabel Murray, and your own husband, Peter Tolman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not my husband! I was divorced from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you were not. It was discovered that the divorce was  not legal, because of the fact that there had been collusion between you and  your husband to have it decreed. You were still his wife and he came here to  stay for a time in order to see you about it. Or to put it in another way, he  came here to tell you that you were still his wife, but that if you would pay  him a large amount of money to commercialize his new invention, he would not  tell of the defect in your divorce. It was really blackmail and you fell for  it, because you had already started Mrs. Murray on her dread journey. So, it  was up to you to get rid of Peter Tolman or see all your plans fall through.  You did rid yourself of him, in a clever way which would never have been found  out, but for your own carelessness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; cried Elaine, too excited to realize that the one  word was a confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an exceedingly clever women, Mrs. Vernon, and you  planned a way to get the poison in a peach pit to Peter Tolman, while he was  staying at the Inn. When he was at your house,  one afternoon, you gave him a few peach pit kernels in a small white envelope.  You were careful not to use one of your own envelopes. Indeed, you took an  envelope from this house to use for your purpose. I know this, for I still have  that envelope and it bears your finger prints. You are well versed in medical  matters, you lived with your father many years, and you learned much. You were  clever enough not to use an envelope of your own, but you were not clever  enough to think of finger prints. I doubt if your knowledge of police work is  as great as your medical learning, but your finger prints were easily found on  that envelope. The Murrays  have those envelopes here with the home address and also on the yacht, engraved  with the yacht&rsquo;s name. And, too, they have in their stationery racks, plain  envelopes of the same kind, but with no engraving. It was one of these plain  ones you used, thinking it so inconspicuous it would not be traced. It was no  trouble for the finger print experts to discover that the envelope showed  prints of only your fingers and Peter Tolman&rsquo;s. The envelope was found in his  waste basket where he had thrown it after eating the fatal kernel, one into  which you had introduced some prussic acid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company sat in a shocked silence. No one seemed to  have any questions or any comments to make.</p>
<p>Then Fleda Garrison spoke out in her high, piping voice;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Elaine did do what you say with the kernels, but  she couldn&rsquo;t have killed Isabel with one X-ray treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she could, Mrs. Garrison,&rdquo; Stone said; &ldquo;take a look  at this photograph. It is a snapshot Mr. Paley made while Mrs. Murray was  sitting in her death chair. See, it is Mrs. Vernon&rsquo;s living-room. Mrs. Murray  sits beside the bookcase. In that bookcase was a portable X-ray machine, which  acted on Mrs. Murray all the time she sat there. She couldn&rsquo;t know it, but that  long exposure brought about the horrible afflictions from which she at last  died. Both Mr. Scott and myself have questioned the servants at Mrs. Vernon&rsquo;s  and we learned that Mrs. Murray did sit in that same place for more than an  hour. Various people were in and out, and talked to her, and two or three  people snapped her picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a yarn,&rdquo; Elaine said; &ldquo;as if anything like that  could have happened! The X-ray that killed Isabel Murray is now up in Leif  Murray&rsquo;s room. It never was in my house. The police have fixed up this story to  shield Leif.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The X-ray is now in this house, Mrs. Vernon,&rdquo; Stone said,  looking at her sternly, &ldquo;and you put it there last evening. You brought it over  here in a suit case, in which you were to take home some dresses. You put the  X-ray machine in Mr. Murray&rsquo;s store room, and covered it with an old typewriter  cover of enameled cloth. Again you showed your ignorance of finger print clues,  for your finger prints were found all over the machine and some on the cover. I  am told you do not read detective stories and so you are not familiar with the  tales finger prints tell upon occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it! You <i>can&rsquo;t</i> have my finger prints! They  never were taken, or whatever you call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not necessary to take them, they are all over the  furniture and appointments of your home. Your crimes have been discovered, Mrs.  Vernon, and for them you must stand trial. And I feel sure that Mrs. Murray  knew or suspected that it was you who brought about her death. I feel sure that  her dying words referred to you and not to her husband. You were not present,  but the nurse&rsquo;s records prove that Mrs. Murray often seemed to speak to people  who were not there. When she said, &lsquo;years of devotion, and then to murder me!&rsquo;  it is evident she was referring to the years of devoted friendship you two had  known, and yet you killed her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right then, I did kill her! She stole away my man!  Leif and I were on the verge of engagement, when Isabel came along and took him  from me. I never forgave her. I married Peter Tolman, but I always loved Leif,  and he cared for me before he met Isabel. Then Pete came back and tried to make  me see that I was still his wife. I didn&rsquo;t want the thing dragged through the  courts again, so I&mdash; yes, I did give him a kernel with an extra bit of prussic  acid in it. I found plenty in Father&rsquo;s pharmacy, and I used it. And now,&rdquo;  Elaine rose, and stood, like a beautiful statue, &ldquo;now, that I learn that Leif  has married Tonka, my last hope has fled and I have no reason or wish to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised her hand to her lips, then let it drop again,  and with a smile as of a vanquished martyr, she sank to the floor.</p>
<p>Ballard sprang toward her and so did Trumbull and together they took her up and  laid her on a couch.</p>
<p>But she died instantly, nothing could be done for her, and  the white haired rector looked on in deep grief as they carried her out of the  room.</p>
<p>Yet, even in this moment of tragedy, Fleda could not  control her curiosity, and she spoke out, loudly;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she mean, Leif has married Tonka? Is that true,  Tonka?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Fleda,&rdquo; Tonka said, and gave an inquiring glance at  Aunt Phoebe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell about that,&rdquo; Mrs. Bingham said. &ldquo;Leif and  Tonka were married yesterday. Dr Chalmers performed the ceremony, and if you  care to hear why the marriage took place, I will give you details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silence that followed gave ample proof of a desire to  hear the story, and Aunt Phoebe told it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the aunt of Leif Murray by marriage,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;My  husband, Joseph Bingham is a brother of Leif&rsquo;s mother. My husband is a very  rich man and because his wealth came to him from his Bingham ancestors, he  wanted it to descend to the Bingham family, of which Leif is now the only  living member. My husband has made a will leaving me a goodly annuity, and the  rest of his estate he leaves to Leif Murray, son of his sister, and the only  heir, direct or collateral. Here, I have to tell you, regretfully, that my husband  is not in his right mind. He made his will when he was perfectly sane, though  eccentric in some ways. He cannot make another will, for in his mental  condition it would not be valid. And now my husband is at death&rsquo;s door. He is  suffering from cancer and his death can be only a blessed release. He is all  the time under opiates and though I want to hasten back to him, he does not  miss me. Now, his eccentricity made him draw his will in this fashion. It will  sound ridiculous when I tell you, but my brother was in earnest about it. His  will provides for me and for many of his friends and dependents, and the  residuary, about four million dollars, is bequeathed to Leif on one condition.  This is, that at the time of my husband&rsquo;s death, Leif shall be living happily  with a wife, who has blue eyes and yellow hair. Isabel, of course, fulfilled  that condition, but now she is gone, and as my husband may die any day now, if  Leif were unmarried the alternative legatee would inherit the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is this other legatee?&rdquo; Fleda almost screamed out  to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband was always greatly distressed at the Bread  Line formed in the cities at a late hour on winter nights. Coming home from a  party, if we ever saw the line of shivering, hungry men, Mr. Bingham was all  upset. He sometimes got out of the car and gave them money, but the managers  didn&rsquo;t like this, it made for disorder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, the alternative legatee was a Board of  Trustees, to whom the four million should be entrusted, and all should be spent  to provide whisky for the poor unfortunates in the bread lines of certain  cities. You can readily see that this would be an ill-advised charity. A little  wrong doing on the part of members of the Board would mean untold trouble. And,  too, Leif would be deprived of a property rightfully his. Well, we put it up to  Doctor Chalmers, and he considered it very carefully. He would make no  decision, give us no advice, but if we wished him to do so, he would perform  the marriage ceremony for Leif and Tonka. That&rsquo;s how it came about; and soon  after, Leif was carted off to jail. There will, of course, be harsh criticisms,  but it seemed to me better so, and since Doctor Chalmers was willing to  sanction it, I persuaded Leif to take that course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Tonka,&rdquo; and Fleda rushed across the room and sat  down by the girl, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about this, right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told no one,&rdquo; Tonka said, in a dignified way, &ldquo;except  Elaine. She was here, and I didn&rsquo;t mean to tell her, but&mdash;somehow I did. I  wanted her to hear it from me rather than through gossip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you had no wedding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes I did. I scattered a few grains of rice around,  so we&rsquo;d have good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you love Leif?&rdquo; Fleda persisted.</p>
<p>Tonka looked at her, and a lovely smile came to her quaint  little face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I worship the ground he walks on,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m  going now to tell him so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bowed courteously to the astonished group and left the  room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be blowed!&rdquo; Humbert Paley remarked,  emphatically, and many of the others silently agreed with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you ever come to suspect Elaine?&rdquo; Fleda asked  Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk over the case now,&rdquo; Stone answered,  &ldquo;but my first hint of it was on the yacht, the night we had the s&eacute;ance. Do you  remember a strange voice said, &lsquo;Beware, Isabel!&rsquo; It sounded to me a bit like Mrs.  Vernon&rsquo;s voice and she seemed to have difficulty in pronouncing the words.  Lately I learned that the Tolmans were all ventriloquists and had tried to  teach the art to Elaine, but she was not an expert. Then I began to hunt every  bit of evidence in both cases, and I soon found overwhelming proof of clever  criminal work. But it was the discovery that there was a flaw in the Tolman&rsquo;s  divorce decree that convinced me. Then, I realized that Mrs. Vernon wanted to  get rid of her impediment of a husband and very cleverly did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody had wanted both Peter Tolman and Isabel Murray  dead. It might have been Leif, but it wasn&rsquo;t, it was Elaine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I found the X-ray machine had been secretly  carried from her house to his, I knew I had found the truth. I planned the  spelling match to discover if Mrs. Vernon was familiar enough with certain  technical words to spell them correctly. She did not miss one. I hold that the  average person, with no knowledge of those medical terms would not know their  correct spelling. Her confession, forced from her though it was, proves many  suspicions that I had held, but could scarcely bring myself to believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Elaine hadn&rsquo;t confessed, herself, I couldn&rsquo;t believe  it, even now,&rdquo; Fleda said, her voice trembling with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Fleming Stone said, gently, &ldquo;it is almost  unbelievable. I was baffled for a time because I could not connect the two  murders. Even when I learned that the X-ray apparatus had been found here at  Longacre, I couldn&rsquo;t think Murray  was the criminal. So I went myself over to Mrs. Vernon&rsquo;s house, having first  asked Mr. Ballard to ensure Mrs. Vernon&rsquo;s absence from her home, and I found,  on a shelf in the unused surgery of the late Doctor Vernon, a space in the dust  just the shape and size of the Ray apparatus; and I knew beyond further doubt  that Mrs. Vernon had taken the thing and carried it over here in a suit case,  which she used to take back home some things that Murray had arranged to give  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went upstairs alone first, no one was in the house but  the servants, she put the machine in the place where it was later found, and  then she called Helga to help her pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, she had wormed out of Tonka the fact of the  marriage, and then realizing that she had lost Leif Murray forever, she moved  the machine because she thought it would be proof positive of his guilt. When I  realized all this, I knew I had at last found the Missing Link.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor soul, since she is beyond our judgment or  punishment, let us forget her and hope that Leif and Tonka will forget also,  and live happily the life that Fate has so strangely decreed for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said Aunt Phoebe, devoutly, and the white haired  rector echoed the word.</p>
