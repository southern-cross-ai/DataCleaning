  Doris Ballard</b></h2>
<p>When Spring comes  laughing o&rsquo;er vale and hill, she never wears a brighter or more contagious smile than when  she dances along the valley of the Hudson. And always she casts an especially  tender glance at a certain loved spot in the town of Dobbs Ferry.</p>
<p>From the time long ago, when in ancient annals this tract  of American soil was designated as &ldquo;one full lott of woodland lying on and  scituate within&rdquo; the estate of Phillipse Manor, until the present, when eager  motorists pause to read its descriptive tablet, the old house, serene in its  dignity and happy in its hallowed memories, has graciously accepted the  greeting of the Spring more than two hundred and thirty times.</p>
<p>Now, when Spring comes laughing o&rsquo;er vale and hill, she is  no respecter of persons, nor yet, of times or circumstances; and so, on the day  of old Abel Hilton&rsquo;s burial, she laughed her brightest and tossed her pink and  white apple-blossoms about in gayest mood.</p>
<p>Owing to early rains, the grass and trees were of that  ecstatic green that flashes in the sunlight, and the cloud-puffed sky stretched  itself across the Hudson in a very revelry of blue and gold.</p>
<p>To Spring,&mdash;the careless beauty,&mdash;everything seemed as  usual, and she nodded blithely to her old friend, the house, and passed on her  riotous, blossomy way.</p>
<p>But within the doors of that historic dwelling, in the  rooms made memorable by brave associations and events of vital importance, a  strange conclave was being held.</p>
<p>The will of the late Abel Hilton was being read by his lawyer,  and the listeners sat breathless at its astounding revelations.</p>
<p>In the southernmost of the two great front rooms the  little assembly was gathered; most of them strangers to one another, and all of  them gazing curiously about at the old, worn furnishings and casting furtive  glances at their companions.</p>
<p>For Abel Hilton, since the death of his wife many years  before, had been a recluse; he had not encouraged visits from his relatives,  and had had no voluntary dealings with them. Indeed, some of them said that he  was more than eccentric; if not actually unbalanced mentally, he was, at least,  a little queer. But the foundation for this opinion lay largely in their own  disappointment and chagrin at not being made welcome to the home of their  kinsman, and now, as many as could possibly arrange to do so, had flocked to  his funeral.</p>
<p>The burial rites were over, and the worldly possessions  which Abel Hilton had set his heart upon were to be apportioned in accordance  with his last will and testament, duly attested and legalised, and in the hands  of Lawyer Stanchley.</p>
<p>As the tall, grave-faced man rose to read the document, a  stir of excited anticipation rustled through the room. His audience numbered  about twenty, eighteen of whom were the visiting relatives or connections of  the testator. The other two, an elderly couple, though seated modestly in the  background, showed an unmistakable air of importance, and took little or no  notice of the others.</p>
<p>These two were the old servants of Mr. Hilton. Jethro Judd  and his wife Molly had been the caretakers and houseworkers of Abel Hilton for  a quarter of a century, and by virtue of long residence in the old house, they  felt themselves superior to those who were merely his kin.</p>
<p>By reason of her extremely serious visage and utter lack  of a sense of humour, Mrs. Judd had earned for herself the sobriquet of Solemn  Molly, and deeming the present occasion no time for any extra effort at lightness,  her worn, wrinkled face took on an added shade of sombreness. Her husband,  however, being naturally alert and receptive, sat with his bright, age-sunken  eyes darting from one strange face to another and shrewdly appreciating the  character and disposition of the anxious would-be heirs.</p>
<p>He peered thoughtfully over his spectacles at one tearful  woman, in widow&rsquo;s weeds; he sniffed scornfully at a burly, red-faced man who  tapped a nervous tattoo with his foot in an effort to control his impatience;  and he shook his head disapprovingly at a modishly attired woman who  continually adjusted her long jet earrings and fussed with her wrist-watch.</p>
<p>But when at last the astonishing conditions of the will  were set before them, when despite the legal verbiage and unfamiliar terms,  they understood Abel Hilton&rsquo;s intent, when the incredible truth was definitely  stated in unmistakable terms by the grave-faced lawyer, then the listening  audience poured forth vials of spoken wrath.</p>
<p>Like a Babel of various tongues, the exclamations and  execrations rose in an ever increasing chorus, and refused to be silenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous!&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;preposterous! It wouldn&rsquo;t stand  in a court of law!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like the old man!&rdquo; &ldquo;He was out of his mind&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Undue  influence&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course we won&rsquo;t have that!&rdquo; and similar more or less  denunciatory opinions were volubly expressed and reiterated.</p>
<p>Patiently Hugh Stanchley explained and insisted that the  strange will was in every respect legal and binding; that it was his part to  see that its decree was carried out and that he fully intended to do so.</p>
<p>Beside the lawyer only two people present were indifferent  to the peculiarity of the will. These were Jethro Judd and Solemn Molly. And  their serenity was due to the fact that the main issue in no way affected their  fortunes. To them their late master had left a generous income from a trust  fund held by the lawyer. So long as they remained in service in the house, so  long would this steady income be theirs. More than content to stay in the  house, irrespective of who its new owner might be, the Judds listened in a  respectful silence to the eccentric disposition of the valuable and historic  estate.</p>
<p>And this is what Abel Hilton in his mischievous,  misanthropic old brain had conceived for the confusion and consternation of  his legal heirs; merely that the inheritor of the whole estate should be  selected by lot.</p>
<p>There were twenty-eight human beings, his will stated, who  had claims as his heirs. These twenty-eight names, he ordered, should be  written on separate cards, and, in the presence of such of them as attended his  funeral services, should be dropped into a hat. Then, it was further decreed,  while Hugh Stanchley held this hat, Mrs. Molly Judd, the faithful housekeeper,  should draw forth one card. And the individual whose name was on that card, was  declared to be the only heir to all that was included in the entire worldly  estate of Abel Hilton, deceased.</p>
<p>Mr. Stanchley, in his quiet, decided way, said further,  that the cards with the names had been prepared; that all present were asked to  examine them and compare them with the list of names in the will. Each one was  urged to assure himself that his or her name was duly recorded, and the lawyer  himself agreed to make sure of the absentees.</p>
<p>The first flash of angry surprise having passed, the  inevitability of the arrangement being impressed upon them and the utter  futility of objection being dearly shown, the heirs, some hopefully, some  despairingly, and all resentfully, prepared for the ceremony of drawing lots.  They scrutinised the small cards, with names written in neat legal script, they  examined the hat that was to be used, a new one of Mr. Stanchley&rsquo;s, and one and  all deplored the slim hope represented by one chance in twenty-eight!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A low-down trick!&rdquo; declared Leonard Hawkins, the  red-faced man whose nervousness had so disturbed old Judd; &ldquo;Uncle Abel had no  right to make fools of us all like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t call it bein&rsquo; made a fool of, if you get the  lucky lot,&rdquo; observed the lady with the jet earrings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much I won&rsquo;t, Mrs. Marshall! But you see, I won&rsquo;t get  it. I jest <i>know</i> I won&rsquo;t. My pesky  luck is always to come out at the little end of the horn. Shucks! Only one can  get it, an&rsquo; twenty-seven of us has got to be disapp&rsquo;inted. No-sir-ee! The lucky  one won&rsquo;t be yours truly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re so sure of it, give me your chance. I&rsquo;ll pay  you something for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a cute one!&rdquo; and Hawkins looked at her in grudging  admiration. &ldquo;You wasn&rsquo;t born yistiddy, was you? Well, I ain&rsquo;t sellin&rsquo; my  chance! It&rsquo;s mighty little hope, but I ain&rsquo;t givin&rsquo; it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Marshall, whose apparel and appearance proclaimed her  in well-to-do circumstances, asked several of the prospective heirs to sell her  their chances. None, however, was willing to do so, for, though a forlorn hope,  each secretly clung to the feeling that he might be the lucky one, and each was  already planning what to do with the inheritance.</p>
<p>A gaunt-framed spinster approached Mrs. Marshall. &ldquo;I heard  you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll take you up,&mdash;part way, anyhow. How&rsquo;s this; you&rsquo;n me  to join our chances. If I get it, I&rsquo;ll go halves with you, &mdash;an&rsquo; if you get it,  you go halves with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was funny to see how Mrs. Marshall smiled and nodded at  the first part of this proposition and how her smile suddenly faded as she  realised the logical but unwelcome proviso that followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; she said, coldly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I care  to do that. What is your name? Aren&rsquo;t you one of the Maine branch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the Rackhams. I&rsquo;m Abby Rackham. I teach school, and  if I got this house I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with it. Sell it for a hotel, I  guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would make a good hotel,&rdquo; began Mrs. Marshall, when a  bystander, overhearing, turned on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hotel! Desecration! This dear old place! If <i>I</i> get it, I  shall rebuild it into a lovely modern country-house. I shall have a  porte-cochere at the south corner, and a pergola on the lawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be right,&rdquo; said Abby Rackham, her pale blue  eyes looking with a mild scorn at the speaker. &ldquo;Those things aren&rsquo;t Colonial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, everybody has &rsquo;em. And I&rsquo;d throw out more  bay windows&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good land!&rdquo; cried the exasperated Abby, &ldquo;that bay window  that&rsquo;s there now is a regular eyesore to me! It doesn&rsquo;t belong. Say, where you  from? West?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m from Ohio, and I&rsquo;ll thank you to know that I know as  much about architecture as some other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, architecture!&rdquo; giggled Mrs. Marshall; &ldquo;everything  goes, nowadays. Just because a house is old, it doesn&rsquo;t have to stay old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; rejoined the Ohio lady; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got two girls  that wouldn&rsquo;t like anything better&rsquo;n to fix up this old place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me do it for you, if you win out,&rdquo; volunteered a scholarly  looking youth, stepping forward. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fledgling architect and I&rsquo;d love to  restore this place,&mdash;if I don&rsquo;t draw it myself, which of course I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How pessimistic everybody is!&rdquo; laughed a breezy-mannered  girl; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that from every one! &lsquo;I know I won&rsquo;t get it!&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I won&rsquo;t  be the lucky one!&rsquo; Now, <i>I&rsquo;m</i> the other  way. I&rsquo;m positively certain that I&rsquo;m going to be the first name drawn from that  shiny, silk hat of that shiny, silk lawyer&rsquo;s! Ermyntrude Whiting,&mdash;that&rsquo;s me.  And when you hear that name read out in meeting, you&rsquo;ll know that I was a true  prophetess. I&rsquo;m <i>willing</i> it, you know.  Oh, none of the rest of you stand the glimmer of the ghost of the shadow of the  shade of a chance! Not for a minute, you don&rsquo;t! I just concentrate my mind on it,&mdash;or,  I shall, when that lantern-jawed sourface puts her skinny claw into said hat.  Then, you see, she&rsquo;s influenced by my aura&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your what?&rdquo; inquired Abby, who was always curious about  matters she didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aura,&mdash;that&rsquo;s&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s sort of your soul, you know;  your invisible soul&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a visible soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, of course not. Nobody has! Well, then, if I must  own up, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what an aura is, but I mean, I influence her  choice by my will power,&mdash;hypnotism, you see, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; said Abby, with a wide glance  of her light blue eyes. &ldquo;It gives you an advantage over the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it does!&rdquo; laughed Ermyntrude; &ldquo;so it does. That&rsquo;s why  I&rsquo;m so sure of getting it,&mdash;see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abby turned to Mrs. Marshall. &ldquo;Since Miss Whiting is so  positive,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you share your chance with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to share a chance with anybody,&rdquo; Mrs.  Marshall returned, petulantly, &ldquo;but if Miss Whiting wants to sell out her  chance, I&rsquo;ll buy it. There&rsquo;s no harm in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm at all,&rdquo; cried Ermyntrude, gaily, &ldquo;only I won&rsquo;t  do it. You see, I&rsquo;m sure of success.&rdquo; She walked away, and then there was a  stir of excitement, as Mr. Stanchley declared himself ready to have the lot  drawn.</p>
<p>It was rather an impressive ceremony. Hugh Stanchley,  himself an honest lawyer and a good citizen, strongly disapproved of the  arrangement his client had insisted on, but his present duty was merely to see  to it that the eccentric wish was carefully fulfilled.</p>
<p>The cards, having been minutely examined and many times  counted, were counted again, and recorded as they were dropped into the waiting  hat. Then, with the air of one who holds in his hands an impending destiny,  Stanchley gravely extended the hat toward the stern-faced woman who stood  waiting to do her part.</p>
<p>They stood in the middle of the great square room, the  eager audience crowding about in an ever-narrowing circle, and those nearest,  watching with hawklike gaze the decisive act.</p>
<p>Quietly, the lawyer held the hat; slowly, Solemn Molly  stretched forth her hand. For a moment she held her spread fingers motionless  above the fateful brim, her lips moved silently, as if invoking a blessing on  her deed, and then, unhurriedly, with her eyes closed and her grim face set in  an expression of stern duty, she picked one card from among the twenty-eight  bits of pasteboard.</p>
<p>She handed it to Mr. Stanchley and stepped back, her part  in the drama over.</p>
<p>Without a moment of unnecessary suspense, he read aloud  the name on the drawn card:</p>
<p>Doris Ballard, Pine Level, Missouri.</p>
<p>Exclamations of anger and sighs of regret mingled with  more philosophical expressions of resignation, and then one and all began to  discuss the fortunate heir to the estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; many asked, for the name was unknown to most  of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; Leonard Hawkins informed them, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s old Uncle  Abel&rsquo;s niece. She&rsquo;s the darter of his brother Joel; Joel died &rsquo;long about  eighteen-eighty, I sh&rsquo;d guess. Well, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then, Doris, she come here to live  with Abel, an&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I remember,&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Marshall, &ldquo;I heard the  tale years ago,&mdash;Doris eloped and Abel cast her off! Well, well, to think she  should get it! She oughtn&rsquo;t to have it! &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t justice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; said Stanchley&rsquo;s quiet voice; &ldquo;remember  Abel Hilton made out this list of names himself. As the name of Doris Ballard  was included, we must rest assured that Mr. Hilton was willing to include her in  his list of possible heirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Hawkins. &ldquo;Well, well, it seems  like it was yistiddy when I fust heard that Doris had eloped. An&rsquo; with that  no-count Bob Ballard! And here she is, comin&rsquo; back mistress of this hull place!  Land o&rsquo; goodness, how things does work out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t such a no-good,&mdash;Ballard wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; defended  another cousin; &ldquo;he was a visionary feller, an&rsquo; hadn&rsquo;t no knack at makin&rsquo;  money,&mdash;but he was a good sort in his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty poor way,&rdquo; Hawkins asserted; &ldquo;but, laws-ee, he&rsquo;s  been dead ten years or more. No use a-rakin&rsquo; up old scores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Doris was dead too,&rdquo; said Abby Rackham. &ldquo; &rsquo;Pears  to me I heard so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, Abby,&rdquo; Hawkins corrected her. &ldquo;I never heard o&rsquo; her  death, an&rsquo; if she&rsquo;d died, I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; knowed. Well, friends, we can make the best  of it,&mdash;Doris Ballard&rsquo;s got the old place, and the rest of us is cut off without  the customary shillin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; customary about the hull proceedin&rsquo; &rsquo;s I kin  see,&rdquo; grumbled another old relative. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way things has gone, an&rsquo;  I&rsquo;m free to say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are certainly free to say so,&rdquo; agreed Stanchley, &ldquo;if  it mitigates your disappointment. I trust you are all satisfied that your late  relative&rsquo;s wishes have been duly carried out, whatever your personal opinions  of the circumstances may be. I shall, in further accordance with my own  instructions, notify this Doris Ballard, and arrange for the deeds of the property  to be given to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky woman!&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Marshall; &ldquo;does she know about  the will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent notifications to all the heirs, but I received no  return messages from many of them. There was none from Doris Ballard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she is dead,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Marshall. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No; unless she has died since Abel Hilton conceived this  plan of bequest,&mdash;and that was only a few months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, she&rsquo;s alive then. Now, I propose to stay here  over night,&mdash;I suppose there&rsquo;ll be no objection to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have none,&rdquo; said Hugh Stanchley, courteously, and Mrs.  Marshall went off upstairs to select her bedroom.</p>
<p>Molly Judd followed her, still solemn of face and mien.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take any room you wish, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;unless it&rsquo;s  the master&rsquo;s. His room ain&rsquo;t really to rights yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want that, anyway. I&rsquo;ve none too much liking  for Abel Hilton, and I&rsquo;d expect his ghost to haunt me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that would be no wonder,&rdquo; returned Molly,  imperturbably. &ldquo;This house is said to be haunted, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ooh! don&rsquo;t tell me any ghost stories! Give me the  brightest, sunniest, cheerfulest room there is, please. And, stay, Molly, tell  me; what do you know of this Doris Ballard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, ma&rsquo;am. She lived here with her uncle, when me  and Judd first came, but soon after, she ran away with Mr. Ballard, and then  Mr. Hilton, he cast her off, and she never came here again.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hilton didn&rsquo;t want her to inherit this place, do you  think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, ma&rsquo;am. I think he had a soft spot in his  heart for his niece, though he wouldn&rsquo;t never own up to it. I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;&mdash;if so  be&rsquo;s he knows what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on down here,&mdash;I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; maybe he&rsquo;s well pleased  that his niece Doris got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so. It&rsquo;s a wonderful old place. I think I shall  come to see Mrs. Ballard after she gets here and gets settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, pretty nearly every one here today has said  that same to me. I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; Mrs. Ballard will be fair crowded with company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Then, as I seem unwelcome, I shall not come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for me to say, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Solemn Molly stalked off and Mrs. Marshall sat down by the  window to meditate.</p>
<p>And outside in the green trees the birds sang as blithely  as if there had been no change in the ownership of those trees; as if there had  been no change in the ownership of the house, the old house, whose roof had  sheltered the bowed head of George Washington, when he struggled with his great  problems, when he called upon his fine mind, his staunch heart and his noble  soul to combine in planning the stroke of state that severed the last fetter  and freed our land from tyranny.</p>
<p>And the historic house, content with its old dreams and  inviolable memories, calmly awaited whatever changes or vicissitudes might come  with a new owner. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter &nbsp;2<br>
  Doris Is Expected</b></h2>
<p>Solemn Molly was stalking about the house in a  conscientious performance of her duty, but with no apparent effect of enjoying  it. &ldquo;Jethro Judd,&rdquo; she exclaimed to her long-suffering consort, &ldquo;it does seem  to me that for a two-legged he-person, you&rsquo;ve got the least sprawl of anybody I  ever set eyes on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, Molly, what is it you want as I should do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to set to work and help me redd up this house.  If a woman is comin&rsquo; here, an&rsquo; goin&rsquo; to poke her nose into every hole an&rsquo;  corner, there&rsquo;s a sight of cleanin&rsquo; to be done afore she comes in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Pears to me you&rsquo;d oughter a kep&rsquo; the place tidy all  along, then there wouldn&rsquo;t be sech a heap to do all to once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bein&rsquo; a man, I s&rsquo;pose you can&rsquo;t understand. Well, I&rsquo;ll  jest inform you that keepin&rsquo; house, as we have, for twenty years, for an old  man who didn&rsquo;t care for anythin&rsquo; &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; his three square meals a day, an&rsquo;  turnin&rsquo; that same house over to a woman, is two very different matters. Ve-ry  dif-fer-ent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shucks, you&rsquo;re all flustered up over Doris&rsquo; comin&rsquo;  home. Why, when she was here, &rsquo;bout eighteen years ago, she wasn&rsquo;t such a  fusscat &rsquo;bout bein&rsquo; so everlastin&rsquo; tidy, as I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good land, Judd, she wasn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; but a girl, then; a  harum-scarum ninny that didn&rsquo;t know enough to go in when it rained! But now,  she&rsquo;s a middle-aged woman, with her life pretty much behind her, and you bet  she knows what&rsquo;s what in the house-keepin&rsquo; line. Well, anyway, you get yourself  up into them closed-up rooms on the second floor, and begin to haul out the  rubbish, so&rsquo;s we can burn up a lot o&rsquo; stuff and give away the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land sake, Molly, how you do pester a man! I will,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  do it,&mdash;but gimme time to look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;d look round from the risin&rsquo; of the sun till the  goin&rsquo; down of the same, if you had your way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a pretty girl,&mdash;Doris was,&rdquo; mused Judd,  reminiscently; &ldquo;an&rsquo; she was mighty fond o&rsquo; me. I rec&rsquo;lect she used to say, &lsquo;Dear  old Juddy, can&rsquo;t I&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juddy, indeed! An&rsquo; a pretty girl! Her with her red hair  an&rsquo; freckles! Well, I&rsquo;d ruther be plain an&rsquo; do my duty, than to be pretty and  run off with a good-for-nothin&rsquo; scalawag!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got your wish, Molly,&rdquo; said her husband, calmly; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re  sure plain, and Lord knows you do your duty; and <i>I</i> ain&rsquo;t seen no scalawags urgin&rsquo; you to elope with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Solemn Molly was quite indifferent to these not very  flattering remarks, and suddenly changed the subject by saying, &ldquo;That Mrs.  Marshall is a hifalutin, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I don&rsquo;t like her,&rdquo; returned Judd thoughtfully. &ldquo;She  ain&rsquo;t one to tie to. But I&rsquo;ll bet she comes to visit Doris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re jest goin&rsquo; to be overrun with visitors from now on.  The relatives couldn&rsquo;t come when Mr. Hilton was here, seein&rsquo; &rsquo;s he wouldn&rsquo;t  have &rsquo;em, but unless Doris Ballard sets her foot down in the same way, they&rsquo;re  all for flockin&rsquo; in and rampoosin&rsquo; all over the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sorter liked that Whiting girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t. Land, Judd, you&rsquo;d like any young thing  who flung a decent word to you! You&rsquo;re too soft-hearted. I didn&rsquo;t like the  Whiting piece of property, nor I didn&rsquo;t like the scrawny old maid  schoolteacher, nor yet the bossy and bumptious Len Hawkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s lucky for you that none of them drew the lucky  ticket. Though goodness only knows what we&rsquo;ll have to put up with in Doris.  Maybe she&rsquo;s got all sorts of stuck-up ways, herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she has, I shan&rsquo;t stay here. We can go off by ourselves,  Judd, and live on our savings&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And give up all that trust fund money the old man left  us? No sir-ee! We&rsquo;ll stay here, Molly, unless Mrs. Redhead makes it too hot for  us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the telephone, Judd! It always gives me such a  turn, now that we have to answer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho! Who&rsquo;s afraid! I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Molly ran ahead of him. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know what  to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It proved to be Lawyer Stanchley who called up, and he  informed Molly that he had received a telegram from Doris Ballard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it says,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that she is&mdash;wait, I&rsquo;ll read it  to you: &lsquo;Surprised and delighted at the news. Will start at once. It seems  almost like going back home. Expect me in a few days. Letter follows.&rsquo; So you  see, she isn&rsquo;t dead, and she is coming at once to take possession. You put the  house in order, and I&rsquo;ll look after all business matters. Nothing further you  want to ask me, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer was a busy man, and though interested in the  developments of the strange will of his late client, he had other and more  pressing affairs on his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Molly, &ldquo;nothing special,&mdash;but I do feel  all at sea. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d like some help, for cleanin&rsquo; an&rsquo; that. There&rsquo;s a heap to be  done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t bother too much. You see, when Mrs. Ballard  comes, she&rsquo;ll be mistress of the place, and she&rsquo;ll superintend the housekeeping  matters herself. If you want advice, call in Mrs. Busby, she&rsquo;ll help you out.  And engage some workers to help you, if you need them. Mrs. Busby will  recommend somebody reliable. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer hung up the receiver, and Molly Judd looked a  shade more solemn than she had before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Busby!&rdquo; she muttered, contemptuously; &ldquo;Busybee Busby!  I jest guess I won&rsquo;t run to her for help! I can&rsquo;t abide that woman! Always  pokin&rsquo; into other people&rsquo;s business. Though, land knows, this Ballard affair  seems to be everybody&rsquo;s business. Anyway, I can manage without old Busybee&rsquo;s  help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But less than an hour later, Mrs. Busby appeared at the  kitchen door, and smilingly told Molly that Mr. Stanchley had asked her to run  over and be neighbourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Molly, with solemn ungraciousness, and she  set a chair for the unwelcome guest.</p>
<p>Mrs. Busby was impervious to the lack of cordiality, and  indeed, few people had ever seen Molly Judd really cordial. The visitor sat  down and gave a look round the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t got many up-to-date things,  have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want them,&rdquo; snapped Molly, who did want them very much,  but had never been able to persuade Abel Hilton of their necessity.</p>
<p>Mrs. Busby laughed. She was a dumpy, good-natured sort of  a woman, and she kept a boardinghouse not very far away from the Hilton place.  Her sandy hair was in water waves about her broad, low brow, and her sharp,  pointed nose, veritably looked as if formed for the purpose of &ldquo;poking into  other people&rsquo;s business.&rdquo; Whether she merely lived up to this effect or whether  her nose had shaped itself to conform with her habits is not known, but  curiosity was her besetting sin and she willingly let it beset her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe Mrs. Ballard &rsquo;ll let you have whatever you  want,&rdquo; the guest observed, not at all deceived by Molly&rsquo;s assertion; &ldquo;say, tell  me about her. What&rsquo;s she like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I haven&rsquo;t laid eyes on her for more&rsquo;n eighteen years,  I can&rsquo;t tell you much,&rdquo; Molly replied, shortly. &ldquo;They do say she&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; Mrs.  Busby went on, folding her handkerchief neatly, and then shaking it out again,  a habit of hers when deeply interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can she be dead,&rdquo; asked Molly with asperity, &ldquo;when  Mr. Stanchley&rsquo;s just got a telegram from her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, I know he got that telegram. But that&rsquo;s just the  point. S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; she&rsquo;s dead, and somebody else is pretendin&rsquo; to be her. Somebody  that knows all about the place and all, and is an impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous! That couldn&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t it? That sort of thing happens often.&rdquo; Mrs.  Busby spoke as with a wide knowledge of the world. &ldquo;And I heard that some folks  of Bob Ballard&rsquo;s said long ago that Bob&rsquo;s wife died soon after he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t true. Mr. Stanchley would  know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d he know? He only knows the name and address of Mrs.  Ballard, and if his letter fell into wrong hands, and somebody else seen it to  pretend to be Doris Ballard, who&rsquo;s to know the difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, you wouldn&rsquo;t. After eighteen years! Why she&rsquo;d  be so changed her own mother wouldn&rsquo;t know her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d know her,&rdquo; declared Jethro Judd, who had drifted into  the room and was lazily listening to the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she pretty?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Busby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty as a picture,&mdash;a real tasty picture. With red curly  hair&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably grey by now, that sort greys young,&rdquo; and Mrs.  Busby nodded her sagacious head. &ldquo;Did Mrs. Abe Hilton bring her up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Judd ruminated; &ldquo;she was here  when we came, and &rsquo;twas shortly after that she run away with Ballard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hilton died before I moved here,&rdquo; Mrs. Busby went  on. &ldquo;She was queer, wasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No queerer&rsquo;n most folks,&rdquo; spoke up Molly, tartly. &ldquo;She  was a sort of spiritualist, in her leanin&rsquo;s, but a mighty good woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard about the bay window. Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bay window&rsquo;s true. You can see it for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but did Mr. Hilton build it for&mdash;for&mdash; you know  what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, see here, Molly,&rdquo; and Jethro spoke firmly, &ldquo; &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t  for you an&rsquo; me to be talkin&rsquo; over Mr. Hilton in any way. &rsquo;Scuse me, Mis&rsquo; Busby,  but I know my place, and jest now my place is to look after things till the new  owner gets here. Then, if so be&rsquo;s you want information, you come over an&rsquo; ask  her. That&rsquo;s what you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now, Judd, I ain&rsquo;t meanin&rsquo; to be curious. I jest  asked a simple question or two, and you don&rsquo;t need to answer &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t intend to, neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the whole neighbourhood is pesterin&rsquo; me to know about  that bay window story, an&rsquo; I thought there was no harm in askin&rsquo; you folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they ain&rsquo;t no harm in askin&rsquo;, the harm would be in  our tellin&rsquo;. Me an&rsquo; Molly, we knows our place, an&rsquo; it ain&rsquo;t our place to gossip  about our dead master or his doin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing no hope of learning anything from Judd, Mrs. Busby  turned her attention to household matters, and offered to help Molly herself,  or to recommend some capable workers of the right sort.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>It was a few days later that Hugh Stanchley came over with  a letter he had received from the lady in Missouri.</p>
<p>After expressing her satisfaction at her inheritance,  Doris Ballard went on to say that she was getting ready to depart but it was  taking rather longer than she had anticipated to wind up her affairs in Pine Level,  and as she never expected to go back there, matters must be finally adjusted.  She said she would probably reach Dobbs Ferry the following Thursday, and wound  up by asking directions for her journey. A postscript inquired what railroad  she should take out of New York City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Judd, &ldquo;Mis&rsquo; Busby&rsquo;s right, after all!  That woman&rsquo;s an impostor, Mr. Stanchley, that&rsquo;s what she is! Doris Ballard  would know what road Dobbs Ferry&rsquo;s on! I tell you, somebody&rsquo;s got your letter  and is tryin&rsquo; to make believe she&rsquo;s Mis&rsquo; Ballard. Don&rsquo;t you let yourself be  hoodwinked by no upstart Westerner. They&rsquo;re mighty cute, some of &rsquo;em, but they  hadn&rsquo;t ought to fool a big lawyer like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t fooled me yet,&rdquo; and Hugh Stanchley smiled at  the old man&rsquo;s fears. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Judd. I&rsquo;ll have to have pretty good proofs  of identity before I turn the deed of this house over to any claimant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo; course, Judd, Mr. Stanchley &lsquo;ll know,&rdquo; Molly reproved;  &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got the least doubt but what it&rsquo;s really Doris herself. In all these  years, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t surprisin&rsquo; she forgot the name o&rsquo; the railroad, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s likely  she thought it was changed by now, anyway. An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell you another thing, Mr.  Stanchley, if that letter was from a fake person, an impostor, that&rsquo;s jest what  she <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> do&mdash;show ignorance! Why, she&rsquo;d know that&rsquo;d look suspicious, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;d  be the last thing she&rsquo;d do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s sound logic, Molly. And, personally, I believe  this is the real Doris Ballard. But, as I said, I shall have plenty of proof  before she takes legal possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll get the best room ready for her, I s&rsquo;pose. The  big front chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Have that ready,&mdash;but she will choose her  own. It will be difficult, I daresay, for you two to accustom yourselves to  another <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, and perhaps a more modern way of life. But, you remember, the  trust fund is for your benefit only so long as you stay in this house, and  serve faithfully its mistress, whoever she may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that, sir,&rdquo; and old Judd spoke respectfully, if  firmly. &ldquo;But if we can&rsquo;t stand the new ways, an&rsquo; likely them Western ways is  mighty different from ours, why, we&rsquo;ve got enough saved up to go off and fend  for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you like, Judd. But I hope you will be contented to  stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * </p>
<p>It was after the lawyer&rsquo;s departure that a telegram  arrived for Jethro Judd.</p>
<p>This occurrence was so very unusual as to cause a great  flutter of excitement on the part of the two old servants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the land&rsquo;s sake, Molly,&rdquo; exclaimed Judd, &ldquo;who can it  be from? It&rsquo;s signed to me, you see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll open it, if it is,&rdquo; and Molly held on to the  yellow envelope while her husband laboriously put his name in the book the boy  offered.</p>
<p>Reluctantly the boy went away, for he knew the contents of  the message, and wanted to see the actions of the old pair.</p>
<p>But cautious Molly waited until he was out of sight, and  then, slitting the envelope with a hairpin, she proceeded to read the telegram  as composedly as if it were not the first one she had ever opened.</p>
<p>The message was a short one. It was dated Pine Level,  Missouri, and said only:</p>
<p class="note">Are there Canterbury Bells? If not, I won&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>And it was signed Doris Ballard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it!&rdquo; and Judd smiled broadly. &ldquo;I well  remember, don&rsquo;t you, Molly, how Doris loved the Canterbury Bells? And we had  grand ones in them days. They&rsquo;re all run out now. Wonder if it&rsquo;s too late to  set out new ones this season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set-out plants are no good. You can put in some seeds  this year, though, and have good ones for next summer. But if we don&rsquo;t want her  to come, we can tell her there ain&rsquo;t none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! we do want her to come. Why not? Would you rather  have Len Hawkins or that hatchetfaced Rackham woman? Land! I&rsquo;ll be downright  glad to see that girl again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t no girl now, Judd. How you do talk! Well, what  you goin&rsquo; to reply to this here telegram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll have to tell her there ain&rsquo;t no Canterbury  Bells, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she won&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she will. That don&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo;. She&rsquo;ll come. But  I guess I&rsquo;ll get a few plants from Farmer Baker; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll start a few seeds right  away, beside, and then I can tell her there are some on the old place, after  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Judd carried out his plans and an affirmatory telegram  was sent concerning the flowers.</p>
<p>And then another telegram arrived for the old man.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Is there an asparagus bed? If not, set one out at once.  Don&rsquo;t reply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I swan!&rdquo; and Judd breathed deeply, in his  amazement. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s sure a hummer, all right! I take it she&rsquo;s fond of out-doors.  Well, she&rsquo;ll find it hard to beat our asparagus. Hope she gets here &rsquo;fore it&rsquo;s  all gone. Not answer, hey? Then she&rsquo;s on the way here. Maybe she&rsquo;ll show up in  a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in a day or two came another telegram. A night letter,  in fact, and it was full of directions that seemed to the Judds both absurd and  alarming.</p>
<p>They were instructed not to destroy or discard any old  furniture or papers that they might deem rubbish, but to hold all for the  newcomer&rsquo;s inspection. They were told to have gooseberries and Election cake in  readiness; and especially they were desired to put the old goosechase bedquilt  on the bed prepared for the new lady of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a goose herself,&rdquo; grumbled Molly, &ldquo;with her  gooseberries an&rsquo; her goosechase quilt! Why that quilt was worn out and thrown  away years ago, and gooseberries ain&rsquo;t ripe now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it proves she&rsquo;s really Doris, all right,&rdquo; said Judd,  his eyes shining with satisfaction. &ldquo;I remember how she used to like  gooseberries, an&rsquo; it isn&rsquo;t everybody knows what Election cake is, nowadays.&rdquo;  But that evening the telephone bell rang, and when Molly answered it, and was  informed that Doris Ballard was speaking, she nearly dropped the receiver in  her surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m Doris,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;and I only called up to  say that I can&rsquo;t come to-morrow. I&rsquo;m in New York, staying at &lsquo;The Admiral.&rsquo; And  I&rsquo;m having such a good time here, that I&rsquo;m going to stay another day. I&rsquo;ll come  up on Saturday, and please meet me at the 3.15 train. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molly hung up, with her solemn face aghast. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t  Doris a-talkin&rsquo; &rdquo; she said, in low, scared tones. &ldquo;Why, Judd, it sounded to me  like some society lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe Doris has got stylish. But if she&rsquo;s too grand  for us we won&rsquo;t stay, that&rsquo;s all. I ain&rsquo;t for no hifalutin folderols, when it  comes to runnin&rsquo; this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind Doris, however high  and mighty she&rsquo;d grown. But it wasn&rsquo;t Doris. I tell you it&rsquo;s somebody pretendin&rsquo;  she&rsquo;s Doris Ballard, so&rsquo;s she can get possession of this old place. An&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll  pull the wool over Mr. Stanchley&rsquo;s eyes, an&rsquo; make him think she&rsquo;s really Doris.  Oh, I know her! The sly thing! I could gather from her voice that she&rsquo;s a wrong  one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Molly, she knew all about the place. And she&rsquo;s fond  of asparagus and gooseberries, and Canterbury Bells, just as Doris always was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Judd,&rdquo; and Molly spoke solemnly; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s got  all that from the real Doris. She&rsquo;s bankin&rsquo; on those bits of personal knowledge  she collected from the real one, and now she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to carry off the  make-believe! Oh, you can&rsquo;t fool me! If it ain&rsquo;t the real Doris Hilton,&mdash;or  Doris Ballard as she is now,&mdash;of course I&rsquo;ll know it. You and Mr. Stanchley,  bein&rsquo; men, may be fooled,&mdash;probably will be,&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t. No, sir! Molly Judd  knows a thing or two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you do, Molly, so you do. But don&rsquo;t you mix yourself  up in affairs outside your spear! If so be&rsquo;s this is an impostor person, it ain&rsquo;t  for us to make remarks on it. Mr. Hilton, he made his will, queer though it  was; and Mr. Stanchley, he did his part, carryin&rsquo; it out to the letter. Now, if  Mr. Stanchley is satisfied with this lady&rsquo;s credentials or proofs or whatever  they call &rsquo;em, we ain&rsquo;t got no right to put in our oar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Judd,&rdquo; and Molly received the rebuke  stoically. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say you ain&rsquo;t right. It&rsquo;s none of our business, to be sure.  But all the same that never was Doris Ballard who talked to me over that  telephone just now, and that I&rsquo;d swear to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Molly, we&rsquo;ll see her to-morrow afternoon, and  I don&rsquo;t care about her voice, <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> know Doris Ballard the minute I lay eyes on  her, no matter how much she has changed.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter &nbsp;3<br>
  Doris Arrives</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Fer the lan&rsquo;s sake, Judd, do hump yourself! It&rsquo;s after  two now, an&rsquo; I wish you&rsquo;d hitch up an&rsquo; get started. Doris said she&rsquo;d get here  on that 3.15 an&rsquo; you ain&rsquo;t got any too much time. An&rsquo; remember, we must call  her Mrs. Ballard. We ain&rsquo;t got no sort of call to say Doris to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Molly; Mis&rsquo; Ballard it is. Hello, Mis&rsquo; Busby,  that you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good land!&rdquo; cried Molly, ungraciously, &ldquo;you here again, &lsquo;Liza  Busby? Well, now, what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; and Mrs. Busby passed by Molly, and went on  to the library where she sat down as if with full intention of staying for some  time. &ldquo;I just thought to myself, I&rsquo;d come over and be here when Mrs. Ballard  arrives. I said to Mr. Stanchley I&rsquo;d do that, and he said, &lsquo;Yes, do.&rsquo; So here I  am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; and Molly sniffed. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose Mr. Stanchley&rsquo;s  got a right to send all the busybodies he likes,&rdquo; she muttered in a half aside,  but her guest paid no attention to these murmurs. She took up a newspaper, and  settled herself comfortably in a armchair to await the expected arrival.</p>
<p>Judd drifted in with a remark to the effect that he s&rsquo;posed  he might as well be startin&rsquo; and then a sudden noisy excitement took place in  the old side yard, and, racing through the wistaria tangle, bounding across the  porch and fairly catapulting in at the door, came two eager, agitated and  loudly barking dogs, followed by a laughing girl who just barely managed to  hold the animals in leash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still!&rdquo; she cried, stamping her little foot at her  charges. Then, with a sunburst of smile that swept the whole of her astonished  audience, she announced,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Doris!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Judds were bereft of all perceptive faculties.  Petrified, they stood and stared, shrinking back a little from the persistently  advancing dogs, but, with their eyes on the girl&rsquo;s face, trying to collect  their scattered senses.</p>
<p>Mrs. Busby, however, with instant appreciation, took in  the very evident facts that so definitely and emphatically presented  themselves.</p>
<p>She saw a girl of perhaps seventeen, with dancing brown  eyes, a flashing smile that seemed made up of scarlet lips and pearly teeth,  and a personality that was all movement and charm. The slender, lithe body was  never still, bending this way and that, as pulled by the struggling dogs; the  lightly poised head now flinging a glance about the room, now about to consider  the occupants of it, and then bending over the dogs with desperate attempts to  calm them, yet always alert and alive to every condition.</p>
<p>She dominated the situation. She had said but two words,  yet her hearers knew them for truth, and spellbound, waited further  revelations.</p>
<p>Doris wore what Mrs. Busby silently characterised as the  very latest wrinkle in sport clothes. The short skirt was striped green and  white, the sweater coat was green with striped attachments, and the fine straw  hat, with its knotted band, sat jauntily on her red-brown hair that seemed to  curl of itself into flat scallops over Doris&rsquo; ears. A blouse of fine white  material fell away from the slender throat and spread its embroidered film over  the straight, flat back of this incredibly wonderful person, and the silk  stockings and sport shoes finished off a specimen of up-to-date girlhood such  as never before had come within the focus of Molly Judd&rsquo;s outlook on life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Judd, I know,&rdquo; the vision exclaimed, with a  special and individual smile for the old man, that bowled him over once for  all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re Molly,&rdquo; she guessed rightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d shake hands,  but these infants are using all the hands I&rsquo;ve got, and I need more. Be still,  Peter! lie down, Dutch! I just bought them, you see, and they don&rsquo;t quite know  me yet. I named them Peter the Headstrong and the Flying Dutchman,  because&mdash;because of the place, you know,&mdash;and they sure do live up to their  names! Peter is the collie, and this pure, pedigreed Boston Bull pup is my own  little Flying Dutchman,&mdash;so he was&mdash;he was! Now, what shall I do with them? Oh,  lordy, there&rsquo;s a cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The large yellow mass of fur that had appeared in the  doorway from the hall was, by some mysterious process, expanding itself to a  much larger mass, and the interest of the two dogs increased accordingly.</p>
<p>For a space, pandemonium reigned, but Jethro Judd came out  of his trance and took a hand, with the result that the two more desperate  belligerents were anchored to immovable posts and the cat had vanished.</p>
<p>Doris, who had thrown herself into a big rocking-chair,  was shaking with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a cat!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;oh, what a cat! Dobbs, the  Swede! That&rsquo;s the only possible name for that yellow bunch of complacency!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cat&rsquo;s name is Moses,&rdquo; vouchsafed Molly, looking at  Doris a little dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Was</i> Moses,&rdquo; corrected the girl, smiling; &ldquo;from now on, he  is Dobbs,&mdash;Dobbs, the Swede. <i>Where</i> are the Canterbury Bells?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris jumped up, as if about to make a dash for the garden,  but Judd held up a dissuading hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canterbury Bells don&rsquo;t bloom till summer time, ma&rsquo;am. May  I make bold to ask if you are Doris Ballard? We&mdash;we expected an&mdash;an older lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did! How could you?&rdquo; The bright face looked puzzled.  &ldquo;And where is the lawyer, Mr. Stanchley? Oh, me! we ought to begin this  business more&mdash;more business-like, hadn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to Mrs. Busby, as seeming more in authority  than the two servants, and nothing loath, that lady took the helm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mrs. Busby,&rdquo; she introduced herself; &ldquo;Mr. Stanchley  boards with me, not far away from here. We expected,&mdash;he expected a Mrs. Ballard  to arrive on the three-fifteen train from New York&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; and Doris chuckled gleefully; &ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m  it. That is, I&rsquo;m not Mrs. of course, but I&rsquo;m Doris Ballard, and I&rsquo;m the one you&rsquo;re  looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Doris Ballard we&rsquo;re looking for is old enough to be  your mother,&rdquo; said Judd, speaking gently because of the girl&rsquo;s evident  sincerity of statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and a look of enlightment sprang to the brown eyes,  &ldquo;perhaps you thought I would be my mother! I mean,&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s this way; my  mother was Doris Hilton, and she married Robert Ballard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good land!&rdquo; cried Molly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re Doris&rsquo; daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I am. Did you expect my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cert&rsquo;nly did,&rdquo; declared Judd. &ldquo;Not one of us for a  minute ever thought but what Doris Ballard was the Doris Ballard who used to  live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my mother died many years ago. But I&rsquo;ll fix all that  up with the lawyer man. I&rsquo;m Doris, and I&rsquo;m here, that&rsquo;s all that interests me  at present. Oh, <i>what</i> a house! I haven&rsquo;t half begun to take it in, but the  rafters! and the sagged doors; oh, what a <i>house!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo; bristled Molly, jealous for the old  place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it! Why, you old salt of the earth, I never saw anything  that I liked half as much! Yesterday I saw the Pennsylvania Station, and that  took my breath away, but it isn&rsquo;t to be mentioned the same day of the week with  this <i>house</i>. No,&rdquo; and the brown eyes darted from one point to another, &ldquo;<i>no</i>, if I  mentioned this house on Monday,&mdash;say,&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t refer to the Station before  Thursday, at least! And that wistaria&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred and fifty years old,&rdquo; observed Molly, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it is. And this part of the house was built in  1685. Oh, mother told me all about it. That&rsquo;s how I know about the gooseberries  and the goosechase quilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that it?&rdquo; Judd&rsquo;s bewildered face began to resume  its normal expression, as he realised the situation. &ldquo;And it was you who sent  them telegrams and letters, and telephoned yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; smiled Doris. &ldquo;You see, I came on from Missouri  with some friends and we staid in New York a few days, and then I was to come  here,&mdash;but you see I just happened to corral the dogs, so I couldn&rsquo;t manage very  well in the train, so, as a friend of my friends&rsquo; was coming up this way in his  big car, he gave me a lift, and here I am. I made him go on &rsquo;cause I wanted to  arrive alone. It&rsquo;s a new experience, you see, to come into your inheritance,  and&mdash;and I didn&rsquo;t know just what it would be like. I only brought a little  luggage, and I think it&rsquo;s dumped in the front yard. Would you mind looking?&rdquo;  This last to Jethro Judd, who started off at once, to find a small mountain of  suitcases, hatbox, wraps, furs and a strap full of books, as well as several  more odd volumes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it happened,&rdquo; Doris cried, as Judd brought the  books. &ldquo;I bought a lot of Washington Irving&rsquo;s stories and other books about  this section of God&rsquo;s green earth, and as I read, I couldn&rsquo;t wait another  minute, so I grabbed at the chance of Mr. Gannett&rsquo;s car and flew off. Now, good  afternoon, Mrs. Busby; you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;m sure, as I have so much to  do,&mdash;getting installed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pleasant nod and smile of dismissal so hypnotised the  Busybody that she rose, and went away, quite as a matter of fact, thereby  causing Jethro Judd a fresh wave of admiration for one who could so easily  manipulate the doings of Eliza Busby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; Doris asked of Judd, as the stout figure  waddled comfortably down the garden path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Busybody Busby, Miss. She&rsquo;s the human colyum of society  gossip &rsquo;round these parts. An&rsquo; whatever she seen an&rsquo; heard this day, she&rsquo;ll  spread from Dan to Beersheby afore night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s welcome to do so, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo;  declared Doris, &ldquo;but I want to see Mr. Stanchley, or somebody in authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would &rsquo;a&rsquo; been here, Miss, only that you came earlier  than we looked for.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300401h-images/page044.jpg" alt="page044" width="667" height="750"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Doris, please, Judd. And will you send for Mr.  Stanchley at once? You can telephone, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss,&mdash;Miss Doris. I&rsquo;ll call him right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call him, Judd,&mdash;and then I&rsquo;ll do the talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon the following conversation ensued: &ldquo;Is this Mr.  Hugh Stanchley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes: who is speaking, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris Ballard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you there already, Mrs. Ballard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am; I came up from New York by motor, earlier than  I had planned. Can you come to see me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, I&rsquo;ll be right over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Molly,&rdquo; Doris said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll scoot up to my room and  tidy up before the lawyer man comes. I suppose he thinks I&rsquo;m my mother, and I  didn&rsquo;t bother to tell him till I see him. Have my suitcases sent up, and you  come along and show me about things. Oh, <i>what</i> a house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris&rsquo;s shining eyes dwelt lovingly on hastily caught  details of the old rooms, as she passed through the hall and up the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fixed this big front chamber for you, Miss Doris,&rdquo;  Molly informed, &ldquo;but if so be&rsquo;s you don&rsquo;t like it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see about that later, Molly. It will do for the  present. I have to grow at home here, you know. What a lot of rooms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Doris, there are a good many. This, now, is the  room Washington slept in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close the door, Molly, I don&rsquo;t want to go in there yet.  Now, open that suitcase, please,&mdash;no, the black one. Why, I hear somebody down  stairs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mr. Stanchley,&mdash;he&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t change now. I&rsquo;ll run down as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the stairs flew the graceful figure, and in the great  front room, where Abel Hilton&rsquo;s strange will had been announced to his  dissatisfied relatives, the chance-chosen heir met the man who was empowered to  ratify the terms of her inheritance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; exclaimed the startled lawyer when the  green and white clad vision appeared before his unbelieving eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Doris,&rdquo; and the laughing face bobbed a greeting, in  an evident enjoyment of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris?&rdquo; was the blank response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Doris Ballard. You wrote me, you know, that my  uncle,&mdash;that is, my great uncle, had left me his property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your great uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Wake up, Mr. Stanchley! I&rsquo;m Doris Ballard, really I  am! But, you see, you expected my mother. I didn&rsquo;t know this, or I should have  explained before I started. But you just summoned Doris Ballard, and so I  came!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; and Hugh Stanchley, aroused from his stunned  surprise, began to pull his wits together. &ldquo;You are the daughter of Doris  Hilton, Abel Hilton&rsquo;s niece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! and my grandfather was Joel Hilton, Abel&rsquo;s brother,  and my father was Robert Ballard. Now you know all those things as well as I  do. I am the ignorant party in this deal. So, tell me, won&rsquo;t you, how it all  happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris had settled herself on the arm of a big chair, and  with eager face awaited the vital statistics of which she knew so little. Her  great eyes followed the lawyer, as he walked up and down the room, his hands  clasped behind him, with fingers working nervously, as he strove to readjust  his preconceived notion of the heir to the Hilton house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could bring yourself to sit down,&rdquo; Doris hinted, a  gleam of amusement in her glance; &ldquo;I do want to know all about it, and your  jumpy ways quite upset me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> jumpy!&rdquo; and Stanchley looked at her severely, as  at a naughty child. Then, with a quick change of manner, he sat down opposite  to her, and asked suddenly, &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;seventeen last winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You act more and look less,&rdquo; Stanchley commented; &ldquo;and  you&rsquo;ve upset <i>everything</i> by not being your mother! How was <i>I</i> to know? How was any one to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should any one care?&rdquo; and Doris sat up straighter.  &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the property left to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the details of the will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; only what you wrote me, which was merely that I am  sole heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stanchley told her then of the eccentric wish of Abel  Hilton, and how it had been complied with, and how Molly Judd had drawn from  the hat of names the card inscribed Doris Ballard.</p>
<p>The brown eyes opened wide, and the red lips parted in  breathless wonder at the whole astonishing story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you thought it meant my mother! Didn&rsquo;t anybody here  know of my mother&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the heirs suggested it, or had heard rumours of  it, but no one seemed certain. And Mr. Hilton had left the list of names, so it  was taken for granted that your mother was meant. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter, as far  as that goes. Your name was on the list, your name was in the hat, your name  was the one drawn, therefore you are unquestionably the legal heir. Only, you  see, you are a minor. You can&rsquo;t hold the property until you become of age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing. I&rsquo;ve been a minor all my life,  &mdash;nearly. But I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, my father died when I was quite a baby.  Then, of course, I had mother till I was about ten. Then she died, and as I was  a minor, too, her property was left to me, in care of a guardian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have a guardian, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. The dearest old doodlebug! Mark Lovell, his  name is. You can write to him for my references and things like that. You see,  he has all my money and he gives it to me when I want it, and that&rsquo;s all he  figures in my existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to have another guardian in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. The more the merrier. What&rsquo;s a guardian more  or less to me? But you&rsquo;ll fix it all up, won&rsquo;t you, Mr. Stanchley? I see  already that I won&rsquo;t have any time here to do anything more than just live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vegetate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness, no! I don&rsquo;t mean anything like that! On the  contrary, I mean that I see that life here is going to be so full to  overflowing, that I won&rsquo;t have time for any business bothers. So, can&rsquo;t you  attend to all that guardianship business and transfer of properties and all  such things, and take a salary for yourself out of the proceeds? I mean the  bank account,&mdash;or whatever Uncle Abel left to me. I suppose there&rsquo;s some money  as well as the house, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, you mystify me! Are you utterly alone in the  world? Who has been caring for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am utterly alone in the world.&rdquo; For once the brown  eyes had no laughing gleam in them. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; and the gleam reappeared, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a  whole lot better to be alone than to have people who don&rsquo;t belong to you. Oh, I  know all about it! I&rsquo;ve tried &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has had the care of you since your mother&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in a school. Pine Level is a school, you know,  not a city. I&rsquo;ve been there six years, and vacations, I either staid there or  went to stay with Mrs. Lovell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which did you like better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six of one and half a dozen of the other!&rdquo; The brown eyes  were dancing now. &ldquo;Mrs. Lovell was all right, only, you see, she had her own  daughter to look after, and Daughtie and I didn&rsquo;t hit it off very well! So,  late years I staid at the school in preference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did you intend to do when you left the school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my life problem!&rdquo; Doris sighed.&rsquo; &ldquo;There didn&rsquo;t  seem to be anything to do, except to go and live with the Lovells or make a  career of some kind for myself. And I just <i>hate</i> a career!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you welcomed the idea of coming East?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jumped at it! And, you see, all my life with mother, she  told me over and over again of this place, and of Uncle Abel and his wife and  about Solemn Molly and Judd and, oh, about everything here! And I learned to  love it all, but I never expected to see it! You know, Uncle Abel disowned my  mother because she ran away with my father. So, of course, I couldn&rsquo;t love  Uncle Abel,&mdash;could I? And when the word came that I had inherited, I thought at  first I&rsquo;d spurn the gift. But then, I thought of the Canterbury Bells and the  goosechase quilt and the asparagus, and I realised that they meant more to me  than my rancour against Uncle Abel for his treatment of mother. And, it seemed,  too, as if Uncle Abel owed us something,&mdash;mother and me,&mdash;by way of reparation,  and if this was it, why, I&rsquo;d better take it. Anyway, I came, but of course, I  supposed the place was willed to me, I didn&rsquo;t know it was a matter of a  raffle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarcely a raffle, though of course it was decided by  lot. Would you have refused to come, if you had known all the circumstances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris considered. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, at last, &ldquo;I should have  come just the same. For you see, I&rsquo;m sick and tired of the school during  vacation, and I simply couldn&rsquo;t stand the Lovells, and, oh, well, I was crazy  to see the old place. I told Mr. Lovell if I didn&rsquo;t like it, I wouldn&rsquo;t live  here, and he said, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lenient guardian, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than <i>that!</i> He <i>never</i> attempted to advise or direct  me. He simply has charge of my money matters, and he makes investments or  whatever is best in that way, but he has no more to say about my doings  otherwise, than&mdash;than you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you knew I am to be your new guardian?&rdquo; and Hugh  Stanchley looked quizzically into the independent little face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please do! Oh, Mr. Stanchley, I like you, and I want  you to be my guardian. Won&rsquo;t you,&mdash; won&rsquo;t you, <i>please?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impulsively Doris slid from her place, and grasped the  lawyer&rsquo;s hand in the earnestness of her appeal, and as the warm, eager little  fingers closed about his own, and the brown eyes pleaded, Hugh Stanchley gave  his consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter &nbsp;4<br>
  Doris Takes Command</b></h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s no sense to the whole business!&rdquo; declared Mrs.  Busby, firmly, as, having folded her handkerchief, she shook it out again, with  a flourish. &ldquo;You know yourself, Mr. Stanchley, it&rsquo;s utterly absurd to put that  child at the head of a big house like that! With no one to look after her but  two old servants! It&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what do you suggest, Mrs. Busby?&rdquo; and Stanchley  looked helpless. &ldquo;She has no people,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has! Where are all those other heirs that came  rattling along to the funeral? They appeared fast enough when there was a  chance of their getting the place! Let one of them come now, and take care of  that girl. She&rsquo;s an unusual child, Mr. Stanchley, and left to herself she&rsquo;ll  run wild. That place will go to distress and destruction and a girl with nobody  to advise or direct her will go to destruction, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to me rather a capable little person,&mdash; a live  wire, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may all be, but the more live she is, the more she  needs a guiding hand. I suppose you&rsquo;re her guardian, or will be, when the state  fixes up things; now, you listen to me; you are a fine lawyer, but you don&rsquo;t  know the first thing about a young girl. Doris Ballard is just at the age when  she needs a strong curb and a wise woman to hold it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you take the position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me! nonsense! I&rsquo;m not the right one, and beside, I&rsquo;ve  built up a first class business of my own, and I intend to keep it. No, sir,  Eliza Busby is a boarding-house keeper, not a child&rsquo;s nurse! But you might ask  that Marshall woman or even the Rackham old maid. She&rsquo;s not a bad sort, with  her New England training, and she&rsquo;d keep Doris inside of conventional bounds,  at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh Stanchley sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big responsibility,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;I had no idea such a thing as this would happen when I drew up that  ridiculous will for Abel Hilton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know if Abel Hilton had his head set, nobody  could move him. You had to do as he said, or he&rsquo;d find somebody else as would.  I don&rsquo;t blame you for making that fool will, Mr. Stanchley, but now you&rsquo;re into  this thing, I do blame you if you don&rsquo;t carry it on right. And it ain&rsquo;t right,  and you know it, to let that child have full sway of that house and fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much fortune. Old Hilton left very little  money or property aside from the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said Doris has money of her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she has. And a strange kind of a guardian out in  Missouri, who gives her funds whenever she demands them.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t get along with his wife,&mdash;ain&rsquo;t that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the daughter is the stumbling block. The two  girls don&rsquo;t like each other and the only aim of the Lovell family seems to be  to keep Doris as far away from them as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! jealous! I see through &rsquo;em. Doris is pretty as a  picture, and taking in her ways, beside. That Lovell girl is probably a  lump,&mdash;and she can&rsquo;t get any attention when that little brown-eyed witch is  around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve certainly planned a situation, whether it&rsquo;s the  true one or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely it&rsquo;s something like that. But, anyhow, that&rsquo;s  neither here nor there. What&rsquo;s important now, is that you should get the right  person to chaperon and take care of that pretty girl, and not leave her to run  that place alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For many years Mrs. Busby had lodged and fed the lawyer,  and had, moreover, taken it upon herself to give him unlimited advice whenever  she felt it was needed. Stanchley took her admonitions good-naturedly, and  heeded them or not, as suited his own wishes, but the two were good friends and  the worthy widow would have borne almost any sacrifice, had such been  necessary, for the good of her star boarder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tenny rate, I&rsquo;ve done my duty,&rdquo; she said, smoothing her  folded handkerchief, preparatory to its final shake-out; &ldquo;and if you let that  girl run wild to her own destruction, you&rsquo;ve only yourself to blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over, Mrs. Busby. You&rsquo;re right, in a  general way, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that&rsquo;s all you <i>do</i> know! &lsquo;In a general way,&rsquo; I mean. You can&rsquo;t be expected to know  anything about how a girl ought to be brought up, so remember what I&rsquo;ve told  you, and make some arrangement accordin&rsquo;. And look at her clothes! Rigged out  like a sportin&rsquo; goods window! She needs a woman with common sense to look after  her,&mdash; that&rsquo;s what she needs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought her frock most attractive,&rdquo; and Stanchley  looked suddenly blank, as he wondered if the responsibility of Doris&rsquo; wardrobe  was one of his duties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attractive! Maybe. But sporty,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it was,  sporty. The child must be tamed. She&rsquo;s too independent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; and Hugh Stanchley sighed anew as he  realised his predicament.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Stanchion!&rdquo; called out a gay voice, as the lawyer  approached the garden of the Hilton place. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a new name I&rsquo;ve made up for  you, because I depend on you as a support, don&rsquo;t you know, a kind of a strong  arm to hold me up. Isn&rsquo;t that what a stanchion is? I&rsquo;m not quite sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris stood in the middle of a bed of flaming scarlet  Oriental poppies. She wore a linen smock of a deep orange tint, embroidered in  a gay Persian design. A broad-brimmed Panama hat was twined with a soft orange  silk scarf, and the laughing face beneath it was flushed with the combined  results of physical exertion, air and sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a garden!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I can hardly wait for  Canterbury Bell time, but meanwhile I&rsquo;m getting acquainted with my poppies.  Aren&rsquo;t they <i>darling!</i>&rdquo; She swept out  her arms as if to gather the whole mass into an ecstatic embrace. &ldquo;What are you  here for? Business, or a social call? Because if it&rsquo;s business, I&rsquo;ve no time to  see you this morning. If it&rsquo;s just a neighbourly call, I&rsquo;ve oceans of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to take time, my child,&rdquo; Stanchley forced  himself to speak sternly, though it seemed like disciplining a brilliant  butterfly for hovering over a flower bed. &ldquo;There are some matters that must be  attended to. Please come into the house and let me have a little talk with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixie!&rdquo; and Doris made a face at him. &ldquo;My business hours  are,&mdash;any rainy day. Come round when you have to come under an umbrella, and I&rsquo;ll  receive you in state. Under a roof that leaks some, but is hospitable. And,  say, Mr. Stanchley, I&rsquo;ve got to fix this house over a whole lot. It&rsquo;s in  shocking disrepair. My revered great uncle apparently didn&rsquo;t encourage  improvement, or even tidiness! He was a shiftless sort,&mdash;if you know what I  mean! But I shall change all that. Wait till you see what I&rsquo;m going to do to my  little old house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the diplomacy of his calling, Stanchley determined to  lure this elusive client into a business talk without her knowing it, so he  followed her lead. &ldquo;The place does need some repairs, I know. But you can&rsquo;t  undertake to do much until it&rsquo;s really your own, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it really mine?&rdquo; and the soft brown eyes gave him a  startled glance. &ldquo;You told me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you it was left to you, but there are some measures  to be taken&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you told me you would take those measures without  bothering <i>me</i> about them. I haven&rsquo;t  time to take measures, Mr. Stanchley, really I haven&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve got to <i>live</i>&mdash;and that takes every minute of my  life. You&rsquo;re interfering terribly now. How can I <i>live</i>, with you fussing around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris was the sort of person who used her hands and arms  to punctuate her conversation. With a lithe sweeping gesture that included the  whole garden and farm, she showed clearly what living meant to her; and with a  sudden despairing drop of her arms to her sides, her limp little hands falling  palms outward, she scarcely needed the disconsolate expression on her drooping  red lips to indicate the utter waste of time it meant to her to bandy useless  words with her lawyer.</p>
<p>Stanchley was of a grave, self-centred nature, and though  accustomed to illogical and intractable feminine clients, he had never before  encountered one so young and so irresponsible.</p>
<p>Exasperated, he said, shortly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;ll <i>have</i> to fuss around, more or less, until  we get some fundamental questions settled. In the first place, you can&rsquo;t live  here alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>can&rsquo;t</i> I?&rdquo;  and Doris turned saucy again. &ldquo;And who&rsquo;s to prevent me? Did Uncle Abel decree  that his heir should have a keeper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t; but such a condition of things is decreed by  convention, by common sense, by good taste&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by Mrs. Busybody Busby! Oh, you don&rsquo;t fool <i>me!</i> I know that woman has been talking  to you, and I know almost the very words she said, and I know how she folded  and unfolded her handkerchief as she talked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roguish face drew itself down into a hint of Mrs.  Busby&rsquo;s disapproving countenance and the mischievous fingers imitated the  absurd handkerchief habit that was so annoying to an observer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says,&rdquo; Doris continued, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m too young to be at  the head of this big house, and that, given my head, I&rsquo;ll take the bit in my  teeth and run away. Those aren&rsquo;t her words, but that is the tenor of her views,  now isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; returned Stanchley, making the most of his  chance, &ldquo;and she is quite right. It&rsquo;s impossible for a girl like you to manage  a place of this sort &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A certain not entirely inconspicuous gentleman named  Napoleon, once said, &lsquo;If it is possible, it will be done; if it is  impossible,&mdash;it shall be done.&rsquo; I have always remembered that little speech of  his, and I apply it frequently to my own undertakings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stanchley stared at her. &ldquo;How old did you say you are?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said seventeen, and that is my age in years. But, Mr.  Stanchley,&rdquo; and the brown eyes became serious, &ldquo;a girl who is an orphan grows  faster than one with parents, and I am as capable and wise as if I were fifty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are? But, unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t convince the  general public of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do I want to! What&rsquo;s the G. P. to me, or I to them?  Please understand that I am Doris Ballard, and for me, nobody else exists!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a generous creed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris laughed. &ldquo;You know I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way. I am  ready and glad to make friends, and I can be a good one, too; but you meant by  your allusion to the general public, the critical public, the neighbours and  people about here who are carping and prying and just waiting to pounce on poor  little me as an interloper and a freak and a silly little ignoramus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right in a degree, and that is why I want to ask  you to consent to have an older woman live with you and teach and guide you in  matters of which you are really ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as&mdash;&rdquo; and a fire smouldered in Doris&rsquo; eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as,&rdquo; Stanchley began bravely and then faltered,  &ldquo;well,&mdash;manners,&rdquo; he concluded lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Doris tossed off, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you believe it! I know all  there is to know about manners. I don&rsquo;t display all I know for your benefit  because you couldn&rsquo;t appreciate them, but don&rsquo;t worry about my manners,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve  trunks full stored away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, clothes,&rdquo; suggested the uncertain man, trying to  remember what special points Mrs. Busby had enumerated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clothes!&rdquo; and Doris&rsquo; scorn was immeasurable. &ldquo;Why, Mr.  Hugh Stanchley, I know more about clothes in ten minutes than anybody around  here knows in a thousand years! Look at this smock! It came from Paris. <i>You</i> wouldn&rsquo;t know it from the Department  Store variety, but that&rsquo;s your misfortune, not your fault. Oh, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> be a <i>goose!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>One little foot stamped down into the soft earth of the  poppy bed, as Doris stood, her slender arms akimbo, and her head flung back in  derisive defiance of a man who would ignorantly criticise her ultra-correct  garden costume.</p>
<p>Then she burst into laughter and shook her head till her  hat-brim flapped against her rosy cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too funny!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t learn your  lesson well at all! Why don&rsquo;t you send Mrs. Busby over to tell me those things  herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those things are trifles,&rdquo; and now Stanchley lost  patience; &ldquo;the point is that it isn&rsquo;t right for you to live here alone, a young  girl,&mdash;in this big place&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris turned on him like a little fury. &ldquo;Not right! What  do you mean? Unconventional? Not at all. Molly Judd is entirely all right as a  chaperon, and old Jethro as a protector. There couldn&rsquo;t be two more capable,  trustworthy caretakers of a girl than they are. And you know it! It may be  unusual,&mdash; I&rsquo;m an unusual girl,&mdash;but it is all right,&mdash;and you know it is! Or, if  you haven&rsquo;t got sense enough to know it, ask any one who has. Ask Mr. Lovell or  Mrs. Lovell or any one whom you consider authority on such matters. Yes, even  Mrs. Busby. If you pin her down to tell the truth, she&rsquo;ll have to tell you it&rsquo;s <i>quite</i> all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose it&rsquo;s right enough, but, well, I shouldn&rsquo;t  think you&rsquo;d <i>want</i> to live alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may criticise my likes and dislikes as much as you  choose, but don&rsquo;t you jump on the propriety of my actions until you have some  reason to do so! But, supposing I did want a companion, who is there  available?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are several of your family connections who might be  induced to come here to live. There is a Miss Rackham,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know; Molly told me about her. A spinster  school-teacher up in Maine! No doubt a worthy and estimable lady, but I can&rsquo;t  see how she would be of any advantage to me as an instructor in manners or as  an overseer of my wardrobe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remembering the gaunt, even gawky woman in question,  Stanchley hastily suggested another. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a Mrs. Marshall, who is a rather  up-to-date lady,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know her, too. Molly has told me of these people. Now,  Mr. Stanchley, you know as well as I do, she is not the sort to live with me.  If you know of any really nice, tractable, kind, indulgent, mind-her-own-business  kind of an old lady, who is deaf, dumb and nearly blind, I might get along with  her,&mdash; but I doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tired of the subject, Doris plucked two long stemmed  poppies, and waving them as wands, executed an impromptu dance, whose widening  circles of area took her farther and farther from her annoying mentor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; called out Stanchley, and turned to go away,  when Doris darted back toward him, and tucking her arm through his, sidled  along with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go off like that,&rdquo; she wheedled, smiling up at him;  &ldquo;for if you do, you may get some gorgon person and install her here before I know  it! Now, promise me, that you won&rsquo;t do anything of the sort, and that you won&rsquo;t  ever interfere with my reign and rule in my own <i>own</i> home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t yours, yet. There&rsquo;s a lot of red tape to be  tied and a lot of dry-as-dust law business to be put through before you are  legal owner, under charge of a guardian&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know; but you promised to look after all that,  with no bother to me, except signing my name now and then. That&rsquo;s why I call  you my Stanchion, because I trust to your strong and firm upholdingness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The earnest face, the pleading brown eyes and the  sensitive scarlet mouth mutely begged his assurance and Stanchley gave it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may trust me, Doris,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I will look after all  the bothersome business part of the inheritance, but I want you to think over  this other matter. You ought to have somebody to live with you. While perhaps  not absolutely necessary, it would be better for you in every way; and I think,  if you realise all I&rsquo;ve said, you&rsquo;ll agree with me. Don&rsquo;t say anything more about  it now, but I&rsquo;ll be over again soon, and I shall then expect you to consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ta-ta tya tya ta-ta,&rdquo; yodeled Doris, her fingers  imitating the playing of a mouth instrument of some sort, and her laughing eyes  giving small promise of assenting to the wise man&rsquo;s suggestions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Solemn Molly,&rdquo; Doris announced, as, after  Stanchley&rsquo;s departure and a wild romp with the two dogs, she entered the  kitchen, &ldquo;will you be so good as to drop that tiresome scrubbing you delight  in, and go with me to some of the upper fastnesses of this castle of mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Doris, how can I? An&rsquo; me with the silver all  out, a-bein&rsquo; cleaned, an&rsquo; the silver powder all over and all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silver will keep, Molly, and, may I ask you who is  mistress here, you or I? I know, Molly, it is hard for you to get used to  obeying a girl, but, honest, now, don&rsquo;t you like me better than old Uncle Abel?  Don&rsquo;t you, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two little hands were on Solemn Molly&rsquo;s shoulders, and it  was their warm, vital touch, even more than the intent gaze of the brown eyes  that forced an unwilling assent from the sour-visaged old servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she qualified. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a darlin&rsquo;, Miss  Doris, but you&rsquo;re a handful! I wish, now, you had some good lady to manage  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there, Molly! Don&rsquo;t you go over to the enemy! You&rsquo;d  have a nice time,&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you&mdash; with &lsquo;a good lady&rsquo; here, ordering you to do  things, while <i>I</i> ordered you to do  just the opposite! Which would you obey, Molly? Which?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her, Miss Doris,&rdquo; and Solemn Molly let no smile mar the  sternness of her declaration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you would, would you? You old funeral urn, if I didn&rsquo;t  know you were teasing me, I&rsquo;d cut you out of my will! just think, Molly, as  soon as I really own this house, I shall have to make a will! Won&rsquo;t that be  funny? Well, it won&rsquo;t be any such a lottery as Uncle Abel&rsquo;s was,&mdash;I can tell you  that much. Come along, now, I want you to show me the attic rooms. I haven&rsquo;t  been up there yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Doris, nor you haven&rsquo;t seen the room Washington  slept in yet. When are you going there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I guess. I&rsquo;m a little afraid of that room, Molly. It  seems so&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You &rsquo;fraid he haunts it, Miss Doris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not that! But it&rsquo;s so wonderful, so solemn, you  know. When was he here, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1781, Miss Doris. In July, just before the great battle  of Yorktown. He was in despair&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washington was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss, he hadn&rsquo;t no troops nor money nor ships nor  nothing,&mdash;and he didn&rsquo;t know which way to turn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he was here, in this very house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this was his very room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were now on the second floor of the old house, and  Molly opened the door of the bedroom that Washington had occupied during the  time he made the place his headquarters.</p>
<p>Doris went in reverently. She looked at the old walls, the  sagging doors which slanted in their frames, and the uneven wide-boarded floor.</p>
<p>She turned to the window, her eyes soft with unshed tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he looked out here, didn&rsquo;t he, Molly? Out of these  very windows,&mdash;and down upon this same, this very same wistaria vine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Doris; though of course there wasn&rsquo;t no purple  blossoms on it in July.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the vine was here, that same old thick trunk, and it  was covered with green leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; this is the old part of the house, you know. The  front rooms was added in 1810.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad they were,&rdquo; said Doris, softly. &ldquo;That front  part, the new part, shields and hides this old,&mdash; this sacred building from the  road and the motor cars and the gay, thoughtless crowd going by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crowds always stop to read the stone tablet, Miss  Doris. That tells about Washington being here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, they&rsquo;re welcome to that. But I&rsquo;m glad  that this room is hidden and guarded from the street. It nestles in here, with  only the green outlook on the garden and the branches of the waving trees&mdash;the  same trees that Washington saw,&mdash; oh, Molly, I can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris&rsquo; voice was awed and reverent, and Molly,  understanding, slipped away and left her there alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter &nbsp;5<br>
  Doris Removes The Bay</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, Peter, dear, sweet, cunning little Peter, if you&rsquo;ll  only stop being headstrong for just a minute, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;oh, I&rsquo;ll promise you  anything you want! There! you&rsquo;ve left your muddy paw marks all over my clean  frock! Now, are you satisfied? Look here, Peter the Headstrong, if I change  your name and give you a nice new one, will you learn to be a nice, quiet  little doggie, polite and proper-mannered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great collie wagged his feathered tail and gave every  indication of promise, so Doris went on, &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to call you  Wicquaes-Keck! How&rsquo;s that for a name? No, I won&rsquo;t change you, after all. I&rsquo;ll  get another dog and name him that. A Fox Terrier, I guess. Oh, lie down, Peter,  darling, and let me read!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In pursuance of one of her queer customs, Doris was  wandering around her domain, carrying a book and reading now and then, between  moments when she sat on the grass and mused or gazed absorbedly at the sky and  trees.</p>
<p>She threw herself on a bank of lawn on the north side of  the house, and reopened her book. It was a volume of Irving&rsquo;s stories that  contained &ldquo;Wolfert&rsquo;s Roost,&rdquo; and Doris was reading it for the dozenth time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now <i>there&rsquo;s</i> a  lady I admire!&rdquo; she exclaimed, to the attentive dogs, &ldquo;she was Mrs. Hendrick  Hudson. Listen, Dutchman,&mdash;it says, &lsquo;his wife, which sate so modestly as any of  our country women would do in a strange place.&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t that splendid? Now, I, as  the lady of this house, shall so conduct myself, that they will say of me, &lsquo;she  sate so modestly as any of our country women would do in a strange place.&rsquo; For  it is a strange place. I&rsquo;m not really at home here yet. But I shall sit  modestly. You get the idea, don&rsquo;t you, Dutch? It means, you know, to be quiet  and gracious and courteous, but all the same to go right straight bang ahead,  and do exactly as you like without regard for other people&rsquo;s opinions. That is,  if they have no particular right or reason to have opinions about you. You see,  there&rsquo;s a very nice gentleman in this story who was &lsquo;stout of frame, bold of heart  and delighted in daring enterprises.&rsquo; I think I&rsquo;m rather more like him in some  ways, than I am like Hudson&rsquo;s wife. Probably they were both more stout of frame  than I, but not more bold of heart, and I most certainly do delight in daring  enterprises. Oh, but I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m here! Just to sit in this green grass and  look at that white house,&mdash;but it isn&rsquo;t as white as it ought to be. It must be  painted. And they must be sure to match that <i>very</i> green of the shutters. It&rsquo;s just the exact half-way shade  between green and blue. I think those old shutters have reflected the grass and  the sky for so many years, they just soaked up colour from both, and that  wonderful old soft, pastel tint of blue-green is the result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, you see, my good Peter, we can&rsquo;t paint until we&rsquo;ve  made some trifling restorations and corrections in the disturbed architecture  of my ownty-donty pet house. I&rsquo;m jolly well glad I took that course of  architecture at school, and more glad that I have a born sense of architecture  in my own sweet self. That middle section of the house,&mdash;the old part,&mdash; is so  perfect that I &rsquo;most wish the front part wasn&rsquo;t there. But that must stay, I  think, though I shall rip off that terrific bay window with immediate neatness  and despatch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris jumped up from her seat on the grass, shook off the  clambering dogs, and running into the house, called a carpenter on the  telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I want you to come at once,&rdquo; she wound up her  conversation, &ldquo;right away, <i>now!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this <i>minute!</i> If you&rsquo;re busy, tell me of some other carpenter that I might be likely to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll come, Miss Ballard; I&rsquo;ll be right over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The summons of Abel Hilton&rsquo;s heir was not to be lightly  tossed aside, and, too, not a citizen of the town but desired to know more  concerning the queer girl who had come to live on the historic old place.</p>
<p>In ten minutes the carpenter had arrived, and found Doris  standing before the condemned bay window, which disfigured the north side of  the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know anything so hideous and so absurd?&rdquo; she  cried to the listening Mr. Crane. &ldquo;A silly bay window, of the period of Mansard  roofs and cupolas, tacked on to this splendid colonial house! It&rsquo;s to be  removed at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Now</i>, Miss  Ballard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Now</i>, Mr. Crane.  Can you do it, or must I try somebody else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can do it. I&rsquo;ll go for a helper,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; telephone for your helper, and tell him to bring  tools and things. I can give you a hammer or an axe to begin with. I don&rsquo;t like  delays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, have you authority&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crane, we are not arguing this thing. I engage you to  do what I tell you, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; and like a lamb Bill Crane carried out the  orders of the determined girl who gave them.</p>
<p>The helper had arrived and demolition was well under way,  before the two scared-looking Judds appeared on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good land! good land!&rdquo; wailed Molly, wringing her  hands, while Jethro stood, gasping at the sight.</p>
<p>Doris laughed at their shocked dismay, and turned to the  carpenters. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re working splendidly. You can close up  that hole somehow, temporarily, can&rsquo;t you? Lucky it&rsquo;s warm weather, though of  course we&rsquo;ll have to shut off the room till it&rsquo;s all fixed right on the  outside. For mercy&rsquo;s sake, Molly, don&rsquo;t look as if I were tearing the house  down! It&rsquo;s only that bay window I&rsquo;m removing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s it, Miss Doris, the bay window!&rdquo; and Molly  gave a shudder and glanced over her shoulder, as if in mortal fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that, Molly! You look as if you saw a spook!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a shriek, Molly turned and fled into the house.  Jethro Judd looked round wildly, and, as fast as he could, he hobbled after his  wife. A door slammed behind them, and Doris turned to the carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she said, calmly. &ldquo;I am surprised at their  actions,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised,&rdquo; returned Bill Crane grimly; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t  you know the hist&rsquo;ry of this here bay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; except that it was built on by somebody who didn&rsquo;t  know any better and now, that I&rsquo;m here, it must come off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you know <i>why</i> it was put on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to,&rdquo; the man said, with a queer look; &ldquo;I put it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re the very one to take it off,&rdquo; and Doris gave  him a dazzling smile, that put an end to the conversation and sent the  carpenter whistling back to work.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we come in?&rdquo; called out a gay voice, and Doris turned  to see two young people walking up the drive toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; she returned cordially. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s noisy here,  come around to the other side and we&rsquo;ll go in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went in to the big living-room, as the girl  introduced herself and her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the Prentisses,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Ruth, and this  noble youth is Guy. We&rsquo;re sort of neighbours, &mdash;though not very near ones, and  we&rsquo;ve come to call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d like to have us,&rdquo; supplemented the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad to have you. Sit down. I&rsquo;ve been here  two or three weeks, and you&rsquo;re the first real callers I&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are so shy,&rdquo; said Ruth, laughing. &ldquo;And then, you  know, our set is too young for regular calls, and our mothers are too old to  call on a girl like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that it? Then I&rsquo;m glad you two suddenly grew old  enough to come. I&rsquo;m sorry those men make such a racket, but they&rsquo;ll soon be  through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine to have that eyesore of a bay removed,&rdquo; said  Guy, &ldquo;but how do you dare do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me such a courageous piece of business,&rdquo;  and Doris looked a little puzzled. &ldquo;The place is mine, you know. There&rsquo;s nobody  to say what I may or may not do with my own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean that. Of course, you can tear down the  whole place, if you choose. But that bay window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to think there&rsquo;s something queer about that  window. What is it? It wasn&rsquo;t here in Washington&rsquo;s time, of course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Mr. Hilton had that window built himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why shouldn&rsquo;t Mr. Hilton&rsquo;s niece and successor take  it down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the story,&rdquo; broke in Ruth, &ldquo;the reason he built  it,&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word of it,&rdquo; and Doris shook her head; &ldquo;tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Guy, decidedly, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t tell you. It&rsquo;s  nothing of importance, I daresay. Anyway, if you want to know about it, ask old  Judd or Mr. Stanchley,&mdash;they know more about it than we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve roused my curiosity, and I wish you&rsquo;d tell me,&rdquo;  Doris coaxed, but the two visitors firmly refused, and the talk drifted to  other matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; Doris replied to their inquiries, &ldquo;I do  play tennis and golf, and I can swim and row and ride, and do anything that is  outdoorsy. I can&rsquo;t run a motor car, but I&rsquo;m going to get one, and learn to  drive it myself. But, you see, I&rsquo;ve so much to do first, learning the place and  the house, that it takes all my time just to get fitted in. I&rsquo;ve always lived  in Missouri, and it&rsquo;s awfully different here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Different how?&rdquo; asked Ruth, fascinated with this strange  girl, who talked with her eyes and her hands as well as with her spoken words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that the world is different here, probably  it&rsquo;s about the same; but my own surroundings and conditions are so different,  that it means complete readjustment. Why, just think, I&rsquo;ve lived in a house  with sixty girls and a dozen or more teachers, for the last five years; now,  here I am, alone, with no one to say go and I goest or come and I cometh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy Prentiss laughed. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re in luck! Ninety-nine  per cent of the young people I know, are kicking against control. Seems to me  the zenith of happiness would be to be one&rsquo;s own master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; Doris tossed up her head with a little  independent gesture, peculiar to herself; &ldquo;I <i>am</i> in luck. Why, think of this house, all my own, to do what I like  with! Indeed, I am in big luck, and I fully appreciate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you do,&rdquo; and Guy gave a nod of understanding;  &ldquo;but can&rsquo;t you take a day off now and then, or an afternoon, and learn your  friends and neighbours, as well as your new home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later, yes. But now, I&rsquo;ve set sail on the restoration of  the house, and I&rsquo;m going to make it as nearly as I can, what it was before the  front rooms were added. I shall leave them, they&rsquo;re all right,&mdash;but somebody  took off the gabled roof from the old part, and slapped on a flat roof! That  must be pulled off and the gabled, dormer-windowed roof restored.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! you&rsquo;ve got your work cut out for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s work I love. I&rsquo;m an architect by nature,  and I&rsquo;ve studied it some; but really not much experience is needed to know that  the thing to do is just to put everything back as nearly as possible as it was  when it was built.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be beautiful,&rdquo; declared Ruth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often thought  what a shame it was to spoil the historic part of this old house as they did.  But you&rsquo;ll have modern things inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, electricity and plumbing and heating and all the  things our forefathers would have had if they could have found them. But not  bay windows and flat roofs where they don&rsquo;t belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the Prentiss brother and sister exchanged a glance  at the mention of the bay window, but Doris ignored it, preferring to learn the  secret, whatever it was, from Judd or from Mr. Stanchley.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t regret it,&rdquo; said Ruth, as, when they  were leaving, they paused to look at the work of demolition, now nearly  completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret the rubbish and bother,&rdquo; Doris returned, with a  shrug of her shoulders at the heaps of dusty litter, &ldquo;but after it&rsquo;s all  cleared away it will be peaceful and quiet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; and Ruth tried to conceal an apprehensive  shiver, while Guy said cheerfully, &ldquo;Of course it will. Don&rsquo;t you let anybody  bother you with old tales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went off, and Doris stood looking after them and  wondering what they meant about the bay window. The carpenter too, she  remembered, had acted queerly, and now she thought again of how Judd and Molly  had flown into the house, as if frightened at the sight.</p>
<p>She sat down on the grass again, and put an arm around  either dog, who nestled to her as if in silent sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she whispered, in Peter&rsquo;s feathery  ear. &ldquo;Are you scared, Peter the Headstrong? And are you, my Flying Dutchman?&rdquo;  Both dogs whined in response, and Dutch gave a low growl, that was not so much  angry as nervous. Doris drew their heads closer to her own, and three grave  faces watched the carpenters, now nearly at the end of their work of tearing  down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love of goodness! what <i>are</i> you doing?&rdquo; exclaimed Hugh Stanchley, standing before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; Doris returned, a little on edge at this  latest expression of disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you consult with me before you did anything so  radical?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Stanchley, I&rsquo;d be much obliged to you if you&rsquo;d get  over that idea that I propose to consult with you or anybody else, before I do  any little thing I choose to this house! I&rsquo;m going to do a lot more, and I&rsquo;m  going to paint it and put in electricity and fix up the place generally, but I&rsquo;m <i>telling</i> you this, not <i>asking</i> your consent or permission&mdash;or  even approval!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last words came out with a flash of the brown eyes  that showed clearly the state of mind their owner was in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough comment for one day!&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Judd  and Molly simply threw a fit! Two neighbours who called were scared to death!  Even the carpenters expressed a shocked disapproval, and now, <i>you!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Doris, you don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that the place is mine. You told me yourself that  you had looked after all the business details, and that now, though you&rsquo;re my  guardian, because I&rsquo;m a minor, yet I&rsquo;m sole owner and mistress of this place.  And, as you know, I have money every month from my other guardian, Mr. Lovell,  and plenty of it to do all the rebuilding and restoring that I want to do. Now,  why, <i>why</i>, Mr. Stanchley, do you look  at me as if I were committing a crime? The crime was to add a bay window to a  beautiful colonial house&mdash;not to take it away!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait, Doris, my dear, you&rsquo;ve the wrong idea. You do  own this place, you are mistress here; except as a legal guardian, I have no  right to direct or comment on your personal expenditures, and all that. But,  well, there is a story connected with that bay window, which you ought to have  heard before, and then, perhaps, you might not have wanted to tear it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of any story or reason that would have made  me want to leave the thing there, but whatever the yarn is, I want to hear it.  Was that why Judd and Molly were so overcome, and why the carpenter looked so  queer, and why Ruth and Guy Prentiss were making big eyes at me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s common property, the story, and I wonder that  Molly hasn&rsquo;t already told it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on in the house, and tell me now,&rdquo; and Doris jumped  up, her indignation turned to curiosity, and even tinged with a vague feeling  of fear.</p>
<p>It was late in May, and the sun was yet an hour or more  above the Hudson river. Stanchley paused on the front verandah, thinking they  would sit there in the sunset glow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Doris directed, &ldquo;come around on the side porch. That  south side is my favourite; the old farmhouse likes me better than the new  part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they sat on the old porch, with its slender columns  upholding the roof that once sheltered the head of George Washington; a fact  which Doris never forgot, and which was always definitely in her consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said, very seriously, &ldquo;how the  memory of Washington, the influence of his presence here, impresses me. I feel  it all the time, not as if he were a person, but a vague spiritual force, that  calls out all that is best in me, and fills my very soul with noble ideals and  brave resolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; and Stanchley looked at the sweet, serious face  with a new interest. &ldquo;I thought you too much of a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp to have  thoughts of that sort! You have serious moments, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris resented the quizzical smile that accompanied this  speech more than the words themselves, and with her quick perversity, replied:  &ldquo;Oh, no, not <i>really!</i> I just said that  to impress you! I have <i>no</i> thoughts  deeper than the colour of a new frock, or the removal of an obnoxious bay  window! Oh, no! Now, tell me the story, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never averse to the sound of his own voice, Stanchley  began, congratulating himself that it had fallen to his lot to detail the old  narrative to this attentive listener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abel Hilton had two wives,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;the first, who  probably died before you were born, I never knew myself. But the second wife  was a strange sort of woman, and was, moreover, a spiritualist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely!&rdquo; cried Doris; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just crazy about table-rapping  and those things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen any?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but I&rsquo;ve read about them in stories,&mdash;and ghost  stories! Oh, I <i>adore</i> ghost stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to the right place, then. This house has more  than one proper and authenticated ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, joy! That was the one thing needed to make it  perfect! Go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you may have, by your precipitate action to-day, you <i>may</i> have started up a new ghost who will  haunt you to your heart&rsquo;s content. How would you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love it! Go on; hurry up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t rush me. Let me tell the tale in its due dignity.  Well, Mrs. Hilton, during the most of her married life, begged and coaxed her  husband to build for her a bay window on the north side of that front room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt. He didn&rsquo;t. He wouldn&rsquo;t. She plead,  implored, besought,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teased, cried, pouted,&rdquo; supplemented Doris, as Stanchley  paused for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and scolded, stormed and ballyragged him  generally,&mdash;but all to no avail. He refused, because, as he said, a bay window  was all out of keeping with the architecture of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love my Uncle Abel as never before!&rdquo; murmured Doris.  &ldquo;But how did the bunch of wood get itself into place? Did the lady have it done  herself? I suppose she gave up in despair, and called in Mr. Crane,&mdash;he told me  he built it,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you telling this story, or am I?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You, please, sir,&rdquo; and with exaggerated demureness, Doris  sat back and waited further developments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, about seven years or so ago,&mdash;no, it must have  been eight or nine years,&mdash;well, anyway, when Rachel Hilton lay on her  death-bed, Abel gave in, and sorely regretted his past refusals to grant her  wish. He lamented deeply and probably loudly, that he hadn&rsquo;t given her the bay  window that was the wish of her heart, and he promised her if she would get  well, he would have it added to the house at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she get well?&rdquo; asked Doris, breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you she was on her death-bed. She did not get  well,&mdash;she died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the bay window? Who put it there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter &nbsp;6<br>
  Doris Hears Stories</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Stanchley went on, spurred to dramatic recital  by the intense interest of his hearer, &ldquo;Rachel Hilton was a true woman. She was  really dying, she couldn&rsquo;t live to enjoy her long-delayed and hard-won victory,  but she was not willing to relinquish that victory entirely. So, she told Abel  that if he would build the bay window, after her death she would return in  spirit form and communicate with him at stated times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he a spiritualist, too?&rdquo; asked Doris, her eyes glowing  with her tense excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, but he was more or less influenced by his  wife&rsquo;s views. Anyway, she made him promise to do as she said, and she agreed to  appear to him alone every Sunday afternoon between four and six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! and did she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That nobody knows. But this we do know. Abel Hilton built  the bay, and every Sunday afternoon he went into that room and locked the door,  for the two hours between four and six o&rsquo;clock. Then he reappeared, and he  never entered the room again until the next Sunday.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Never went into that room through the week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; Molly will tell you the same. Nor did he ever speak  concerning what took place in there at those sessions; or tell any one, so far  as I know, whether Rachel appeared to him or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Uncle Abel,&rdquo; and Doris&rsquo; face looked wistfully  sad, &ldquo;I hope he wasn&rsquo;t disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, I&rsquo;m sure. But now, my lady, do you see what  you&rsquo;ve done? You&rsquo;ve torn down Rachel&rsquo;s sacred bay-window, and you may face the  possibility of adding her haunting and vengeful spirit to the crowd of wraiths  that already have reputed lodgings here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris looked at him with unseeing gaze. She leaned  forward, grasping the arms of her chair, and merely breathed the word, &ldquo;ghosts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the place is infested with them,&mdash;that is, by  tradition and legend; I&rsquo;ve never seen any, nor do I know of any one who has.  But there are stories galore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them to me,&mdash;all of them. If there are ghosts in this  house, they are <i>my</i> ghosts, and it is  my right to know all about them. Does my great aunt Rachel haunt the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she hasn&rsquo;t, she will, now that you&rsquo;ve torn down her  sacred bay window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t sacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abel Hilton held it so. That room was rarely entered  after his wife&rsquo;s death, except when he locked himself in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps Uncle Abel&rsquo;s ghost will walk, with the  rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Stanchley,&rdquo; Doris was very much in  earnest, &ldquo;as I understand it, Abel Hilton&rsquo;s will left everything to the  fortunate person whose name should be drawn from the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that person was to have absolute authority and  control of all the property and estate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he had no notion that heir would be a child of  sixteen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t affect the bequest. But, this is what does  affect it. If any will or any intent of a will is interfered with, the spirit  of the dead testator will haunt the house until such interference ceases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, Doris! don&rsquo;t look at me like that!&rdquo; and Hugh  Stanchley moved uncomfortably before Doris&rsquo; piercing gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking at you in any particular way, Mr.  Stanchley, but I&rsquo;m telling you that I propose to make my own plans and carry  them out. You do not know me very well, if you think I am a docile or pliable  sort. My mother often told me that I inherited my father&rsquo;s adventurous and wild  disposition. I&rsquo;m glad of it! I want adventure and experience. This house is  mine, and I shall do as I will with my own. And if there are ghosts, so much  the better! I am not afraid of them. They will have no reason to harm me, for  already I love the house, and I shall do with it only what is best for it. I  don&rsquo;t mean to be obstinate or pig-headed,&mdash; in fact I want to conduct myself  like Mrs. Hendrick Hudson, who sate so modestly, but I must and will have my  own way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris had risen, and stood with one raised arm around a  slender pillar of the old porch, and waved the other toward the house itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is mine,&rdquo; she said solemnly; &ldquo;all mine. I love it for  its age and dignity; I revere it because it is glorified by the memories of  Washington, because in these very rooms,&mdash;on this very porch, he sat and brooded  over the fate of the country he loved! I shall restore and renew it, until it  is as nearly as possible the house it was then, and if foolish bay windows and  flat roofs stand in my way, they&rsquo;ll have to go, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile broke over the lovely face, a reverent light  glowed in the brown eyes, and Doris stood, in the sunset glow, looking a  veritable and worthy inheritor of the old house and its glorious traditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not interfere with your wishes, Doris,&rdquo; Stanchley  said; &ldquo;you are right, it is your house, and you have power to do as you will  with it. Also, you have sufficient income to make these restorations possible,  but I hope you will consult with me as to carpenters&rsquo; and painters&rsquo; estimates. Such  things it would be wise to submit to a more experienced judgment, before you  give your orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;re my Stanchion again! My stronghold and helper.  Thank you for understanding at last. I am impetuous, I know, but you see, I  have to be, to gain my point. There&rsquo;s another gentleman I greatly admire told  about in that Irving story. He &lsquo;warred for quiet,&rsquo; and &lsquo;took part in every  brawl in his eagerness to keep the peace and promote public tranquillity&rsquo;! How&rsquo;s  that for a diplomat? And that&rsquo;s me, all over! Now, I&rsquo;ve warred you for quiet,  and you&rsquo;ve surrendered, so that&rsquo;s all right! You&rsquo;ll learn me after a while. If  any one picks me up for a white-muslined, blue-ribboned, spinet-playing damsel,  he&rsquo;ll set me down again, pretty quick! Come along now, and let&rsquo;s go and look at  the waterfall. And I&rsquo;ll tell you how I&rsquo;m going to transform that brook  arrangement into a swimming pool! If any ghost of the Neperhan or rainbow fairy  of the cascade wants to haunt me, it may. Why, Mr. Stanchley, I just eat up  ghost stories,&mdash;always have. When will you tell me my own spectral legends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; laughed Stanchley. &ldquo;They should be told on a  dark winter night, with only the light of one flickering candle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which the soughing wind would blow out,&rdquo; interrupted  Doris. &ldquo;All right, let the ghosts wait, and come to the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>But it was not the lawyer, after all, who told Doris the  time-honoured legends of the old house.</p>
<p>That night, before going to her own bed-room, the girl  went into the room Washington had used during his stay there, and sat by the  window in the moonlight gloom, looking out on the soft night. The air was  filled with the fragrance of the wistaria, and the spring garden blooms, and  she saw the dogwood trees, numerous and of a ghostly white, like scattered  phantoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; she called out, softly; &ldquo;oh, Molly! come up here,  won&rsquo;t you, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Solemn Molly obeyed the bidding, and as she appeared at  the door, Doris said, &ldquo;Sit down, Molly. I want you to tell me about the  ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one, Miss Doris,&rdquo; and Molly spoke in a  strained, scared voice, &ldquo;that is, unless you count the lady,&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t  believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t tell it in that jerky, mixed-up way! Sit down,  Molly; take your time, and tell me the whole story. I want it all and I want it  now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord save us, child! Can&rsquo;t we have a light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; no ghost story likes a light! Are you afraid, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I am, Miss Doris! It&rsquo;s seldom I think of the ghost,  I&rsquo;ve schooled myself not to,&mdash;and, now, if I bring up the whole tale&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is just what you are to do. Don&rsquo;t be foolish,  Molly. There&rsquo;s no such thing as a ghost, really, you know. But I want to hear  the tradition, and I want it now, on this heavenly moonlight night, here in  Washington&rsquo;s room,&mdash;did he know of the ghost, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land, Miss Doris, it wasn&rsquo;t a <i>ghost</i> in his day here! It was a gay young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is a young man ghost? Great! Go on, now, Molly, I  won&rsquo;t interrupt with a word, till you&rsquo;ve finished. Begin at the very  beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the beginning was in Washington&rsquo;s time, Miss Doris.  He was here in 1781, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, bless his heart! Sad, gloomy, despondent, &mdash;His army,  only a tattered remnant of troops, encamped right out in this very landscape!  Oh, I know all about that, Molly, I&rsquo;ve read every bit of history I can find about  that summer. And that blessed man sat here, in this room, &lsquo;his soul in arms,&rsquo;  but distracted for lack of help or encouragement to fight the enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the French troops, Miss Doris, they was here, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, Rochambeau&rsquo;s men filled up this scenery,  also. But go on, Molly, get to the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was one of Rochambeau&rsquo;s soldiers, some say a gay young  blade&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he was a gay young blade, if he was a French  soldier! Oh, what a lovely ghost! Go on, Molly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t be flippantish, Miss Doris, dear, an&rsquo; oh,  please, can&rsquo;t we have a little light?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the French soldiers was all about these hills, and  they was all for flirtin&rsquo; an&rsquo; sweetheartin&rsquo; with the young ladies in the  country houses round about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, were they? I never thought of them that way, I  thought they were drilling and fighting all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Doris, you know there wasn&rsquo;t any battle here.  They camped here, jest waitin&rsquo; to see what next. Why, they lived in tents, you  know, and they raised little gardens, I&rsquo;ve heard, and amused themselves as best  they might, while waitin&rsquo; for marchin&rsquo; orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they was one French chap, a gallant youth, named Le  Fevre, and he was sweethearts with a lovely young lady named Cutler&mdash;Miss Luella  Cutler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pretty name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a pretty girl, so the story goes. Well, this young  man, he had the run of this house, bein&rsquo; one of Rochambeau&rsquo;s pets, and a good  friend of George Washington&rsquo;s, and they kept him busy runnin&rsquo; important errants  an&rsquo; conveyin&rsquo; secret messages hither an&rsquo; yon. Many a time, &rsquo;tis said, Le Fevre  slept under this roof&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did he? Molly, you can&rsquo;t begin to know how I love  this house! I shall always live here. I shall marry, and my children and  grandchildren shall be brought up to love and revere it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laws, Miss  Doris, maybe you won&rsquo;t marry any one round these parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to come here to woo me, Molly. Only in this  house will the troth of Doris Ballard be plighted. This house is <i>my</i> house, these traditions are <i>my</i> traditions,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like your ancestors had lived here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they had,&mdash;&rsquo;way back, I mean. But I find they didn&rsquo;t.  Old Uncle Abel bought the place after he was a grown man. But it doesn&rsquo;t  matter. It is my home now, and always will be. I shall start the family  traditions and my descendants will carry them on, and now and forever this  house shall be reverenced and loved by its own people. Good gracious, Molly,  can&rsquo;t you see the wonder of it! Can&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Doris, I do,&rdquo; and the solemn face looked at the  radiant countenance before her. All in white, round her shoulders a pale blue  scarf that turned misty in the moonlight, Doris looked herself like a wraith of  the Revolutionary Spirit. She was living far back in the past, her thoughts,  her mind were all full of the memory of Washington and his times, and she  almost forgot the promised story as she lost herself in her glorious fancies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now as to the ghost, Miss,&rdquo; Molly proceeded, and Doris  roused herself with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Molly, go on. Was the gay young Frenchman the  ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later on comes that. Now, Mr. Le Fevre, he was the beau  of the beautiful Miss Cutler. And at that time the whole countryside was in  fear and trembling of the troops of Hessians who had just reached New York.  Fearful tales of the Hessians&rsquo; doings was everywhere told, an&rsquo; nobody felt safe  from a raid,&mdash;as it might be any minute. So, all hands hid their valuables and  their moneys and took every precaution against the terrible Hessians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they come up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. I haven&rsquo;t much history, except as I&rsquo;ve  heard it in these tales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you this story, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known it all my life, Miss Doris. I&rsquo;ve heard it an&rsquo;  told it hundreds of times. Everybody round here knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it gains with every recital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t need to. The facts speak for themselves. Well,  then, this Miss Cutler, she had a string of valuable pearls,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now it gets interesting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A string of valuable pearls, as was a heirloom, and the  clasp of &rsquo;em was a big ruby, which they called a luck, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, old families often had one special gem that was  their &lsquo;luck.&rsquo; I must get one, to start my traditions on. They ought to cling  about a Luck, of some sort. Say, Molly, I must name this place. I believe,  though, I&rsquo;ll continue to call it Collander. They tell me it used to be called  that, and I like it a lot. Yes, I&rsquo;ll call it Collander, for all time! Go on,  Molly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss. And so, this poor young lady was in a great  to-do about where to hide her necklace. And not wishing to trust it in her own  home, she begged Le Fevre to hide it in this house, sort of feeling that as  George Washington was living here, it was the safest place. So the young  Frenchman, he hid it one night, and they do say that the very next day he was  marched off to Yorktown, without so much as a minute to tell the lady where was  the hiding-place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; gracious sake! Is it here yet, Molly?  Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land, Miss Doris, how you do run on! How do I know where  it is? Now do you want to hear the tale, or don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please, Molly, and I will be good, and not  interrupt, but, oh, you don&rsquo;t know how exciting it is to be hearing your own  traditions of your own house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then listen a bit. He went off to the war, and he was  killed in the Siege of Yorktown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly, not really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, really. And now here&rsquo;s the story itself. As he was  a-dyin&rsquo; on the battlefield,&mdash;with his very dyin&rsquo; gasp,&mdash;he told a fellow comrade  where the pearls was hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Miss, nobody knows. Leastways, what he said  was so incoherent and un&mdash;un&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unintelligible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that. An&rsquo; though the comrade soldier brought the  message back to Miss Cutler, this was all he could make of it. The Frenchman  said he hid the pearls in among the family plate of this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silver? Where? On the sideboard? Was there much of  it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the answers to those questions. The old  story goes that he said, gaspin&rsquo; like, &lsquo;the family plate,&rsquo; an&rsquo; then, when his  comrade tried to get more information, he said, &lsquo;the willow pitcher.&rsquo; An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he meant that old willow pattern china,&mdash; don&rsquo;t you  know? The old blue design, of the lovers crossing the bridge,&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I know, Miss Doris. Don&rsquo;t you s&rsquo;pose whoever  first heard this story, knew all about the willow pattern china, even more&rsquo;n we  do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they did! I suppose this house was full of it  then. And he put the pearls in the willow pitcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could any one know? He said first, the family plate,  an&rsquo; of course, they s&rsquo;posed they&rsquo;d find the pearls in a tankard or tureen or  some of those big pieces as wasn&rsquo;t used every day. But it didn&rsquo;t seem much of a  hiding place, did it now? An&rsquo; then he followed it up with the remark about the  willow pitcher, an&rsquo; who knows which he meant? He couldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; put the pearls in  the piece o&rsquo; plate and in the pitcher, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless he divided them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, of course. But it don&rsquo;t seem likely as he&rsquo;d break a  pearl necklace in two, now, does it? Maybe, though, the string was weak, an&rsquo;  give way, an&rsquo; he thought it a good plan to put some in one place an&rsquo; some in  another. But, to my way o&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo;, either a pitcher or a silver jug was a  poor place to conceal &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t judge, Molly. Perhaps the piece of family plate  he chose for the hiding place was already hidden itself. Suppose it had been  concealed by the people living here, and Le Fevre spotted it, and just dropped  the pearls in. That would be all right, I think. Oh, again, maybe the willow  pitcher was an old cracked thing on a high kitchen shelf and he felt sure it  wouldn&rsquo;t be looked into by the thieves, because it was so old and discarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure are ingenious, Miss Doris! Maybe those things  are so. But anyway, they never found the pearls, and to this day Miss Cutler&mdash;a  direct descendant of the lady who lost &rsquo;em&mdash;is offerin&rsquo; a reward for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could find them, Molly; I&rsquo;d give them to her  without any reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you would, I&rsquo;ll be bound. Well, Miss Doris, now for  the ghost. They do say that the poor young man can&rsquo;t rest quiet in his grave on  account of them lost pearls. An&rsquo; so,&rdquo; Molly looked apprehensively over her  shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, does <i>he</i> haunt this house? Does he, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he does. I <i>wish</i> you&rsquo;d have a light. I&rsquo;m that shaky in my knees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish! When does he haunt? Have you ever seen  him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land, no! I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; dropped dead from fright, if I had!  Nobody&rsquo;s seen him o&rsquo; late years, but they do say as he haunts of August  nights,&mdash;that&rsquo;s when it happened,&mdash;&rsquo;long about August.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did it? And what does the ghost do, Molly? Trail  around in a misty vapour, and clank his chains, &mdash;no, he didn&rsquo;t have  chains,&mdash;well, clank his sword, and wail as he seeks for the lost treasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Solemn Molly resented the light tone and the laughter in  the young voice, and she said, shortly, &ldquo;If so be&rsquo;s you see fit to make fun of  it, Miss Doris, I hope to goodness the haunt appears to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he does, Molly. <i>I&rsquo;m</i> not afraid of ghosts. I&rsquo;m not a bit superstitious. Look! <i>Molly!</i> Don&rsquo;t you see a form in that corner?  See,&mdash;a vague, shadowy,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris dropped her voice to a hoarse whisper, and clutched  Molly&rsquo;s arm in a pretended agony of fear. With a shriek, Molly jumped up and  rushed from the room and flew downstairs as fast as her fright would let her.</p>
<p>Doris heard her hurry to the kitchen, and slamming the  door behind her, give vent to her terror and indignation in a storm of angry  words to her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll threaten to leave to-morrow,&rdquo; thought Doris,  smiling, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll coax her up and she won&rsquo;t go. I oughtn&rsquo;t to have scared her,  but it was such a temptation. Well, anyway, now I&rsquo;ve got my own real live ghost.  And a dandy one he is, too. I &rsquo;most wish I could believe in hauntings, for it  somehow seems as if I ought to. But I don&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s all there is about  that. I do believe in the sacred memories and the noble, splendid influence of  the great man who used to live in this room; I do believe that the thought and  knowledge of his spirit and character will help me to mould my own on his  ideals and standards. I believe in such influences and forces, but not in the  return to earth in ghostly wise of the gay French soldier! Though it&rsquo;s nice of  him to be so disturbed about the disappearance of the pearls that were put in  his care. I think I&rsquo;ll put up a pretty good search for them, and in my tearing  downs and building ups, I may find them! Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter &nbsp;7<br>
  Doris Has A Guest</b></h2>
<p>Midsummer found the old house well on its way to a  complete restoration. Doris had found it necessary to call in a skilled  architect, and in accordance with his directions, the workmen had removed the  flat roof and replaced it with a gabled, dormered one that left the third story  as it had been originally planned, with many small rooms and two large attics,  beneath whose slanting sides one could scarcely stand upright.</p>
<p>Around and behind a chimney, a secret hiding place had  been discovered and from it were dragged old papers and old bills, but as these  all bore dates subsequent to eighteen hundred, they were of no immediate  interest to Doris.</p>
<p>She had a vague hope of finding some papers or documents  that would throw a light on the hiding place of the pearls, which she hoped  were still in the old house.</p>
<p>Stanchley laughed at her, saying the old family plate of  the people who had lived at that time had long ago disappeared, whether stolen  or legitimately carried away. And as to a willow pitcher, if that had been made  the receptacle of the treasure, the first person to discover the fact would  soon have removed the gems to a safer place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear Doris,&rdquo; the lawyer assured her, &ldquo;those pearls  are gone beyond recall, as far as you are concerned. Of course somebody found  them years ago, and it must have been some dishonest person, for the Cutler  people have tried to recover them many, many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying now, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; asked Doris. &ldquo;Molly  told me there&rsquo;s a reward still offered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there is a standing offer, but it will probably  continue to stand, till the crack of doom. Why, think a minute, child. How  could those pearls stay in any silver piece of silver plate or in any old  pitcher for more than a century? I think, with you, that the tankard or pitcher  was a hidden one,&mdash;that would give the story credibility, at least. And as to  the mention of the two pieces, it may have been that the silver piece of plate,  whatever it was, was hidden with or near the willow pitcher, and the finding of  one implied the other. You see, the whole tale is merely a series of verbal  repetitions, and has doubtless been garbled and exaggerated in the telling.  Perhaps the willow pitcher is an addition of a fanciful and enthusiastic  Cutler, who told the tale many years ago; and, on the other hand, perhaps the  family plate was the addition and the pitcher the real thing. Anyway, you know  as much about it as any one else of the present day, so search away to your  heart&rsquo;s content, as many people have done before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have the house,&rdquo; said Doris, smiling up at him,  &ldquo;and so I have the best opportunity to hunt for the secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generations of Cutlers have scoured the house from attic  to cellar, but the more sensible ones of that family agree that the pearls and  the pitcher were removed long, long ago, and further search is about as useless  as seeking perpetual motion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I am the perpetual motion who does the  seeking,&rdquo;&mdash;and Doris danced about, waving her arms energetically&mdash;&ldquo;there may yet  be something doing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Doris,&rdquo; called a summoning voice, and Guy Prentiss  stepped through the long open window, into the living room. &ldquo;Ready to go to the  tennis court with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go to-day, Guy,&rdquo; and Doris perched herself on the  corner of a table, prepared for what she knew would be a stormy argument. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  got to be here when the masons come to fix the old Franklin thing-a-majig in  the fireplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw, Doris, they can get along without you. Let  Molly see to it, or that capable and important personage who chauffs your car  and owns this ranch generally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardy? <i>He</i> doesn&rsquo;t  own this place,&mdash;<i>I</i> do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong, this place owns you. You&rsquo;re a  slave to it, and it rules you with a rod of iron! Doesn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Stanchley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About fifty-fifty, I think. The place <i>has</i> cast a spell over Doris, but she has  her own sweet way with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, her ways are sweet enough,&rdquo; and Guy scowled at the  saucy face and scornful tiptilted chin.</p>
<p>Doris paid little heed to him, for she was contemplating  the great lock and key on one of the old doors of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see anything like it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;We found  it down cellar, and it seemed to belong there, so I had it put on. But I think  now it was a lock for an outer door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was,&rdquo; Guy assented. &ldquo;Probably the lock that  the burglar picked to get the loot the Frenchman hid in the family plate of the  house that Jack built!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d have a high old time picking that lock!&rdquo; and Doris  exhibited with pride the old and complicated processes. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t believe  people locked up much then; I&rsquo;ve always heard of the old farmhouses with their  doors standing wide open all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In piping times of peace, little one, not when the  black-avised Hessians were abroad in the land. But, come along, you&rsquo;ve just got  to go to that tennis game. You promised me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris&rsquo; red lips formed a mutinous little curve. &ldquo;I have an  ineradicable detestation of doing anything I promised to do,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;If  I said I&rsquo;d go, I won&rsquo;t go,&mdash;and that settles that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re all dressed for it. You expected to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris glanced down at her smart tennis suit of  tan-coloured Rajah with scraps of bright plaid silk attached in just the right  places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some togs!&rdquo; said Guy, approvingly, but the little foot in  its canvas shoe swung indolently against the pedestal of the old mahogany  table, and Doris serenely repeated her intention of staying at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, stay, then,&rdquo; and Guy prepared to leave; &ldquo;stay here  alone, you little hermit! Just keep right on staying alone, and pretty soon all  your friends will desert you, and you&rsquo;ll have no company but the old ghosts,  and most likely <i>they&rsquo;ll</i> desert you,  and you&rsquo;ll live alone for a thousand years, and you&rsquo;ll get older and older and  older, until you dry up and blow away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t blown away yet!&rdquo; and Doris sprang down from the  table, and stood poised on one foot, arms outspread, and hovering like a big  butterfly, &ldquo;but I may fly away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; and Guy grabbed her fringed sash. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be  surprised to see you fly up the chimney! You&rsquo;re a witch! Did your ancestors  hail from Salem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Spect they did. But I&rsquo;d like to fly up the chimney, and  see what ails that flue,&mdash;oh, here come the masons, now. I won&rsquo;t detain you,  Guy, if you feel you <i>must</i> go!&rdquo; Doris  stood by the open window, with very evident intention of closing it behind her  departing guest, and as the boy went away, grumbling, Stanchley laughed at his  determined young ward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to fire him,&rdquo; she said, apologetically, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s  bothering around here all the time, anyhow. I did mean to play tennis this  afternoon, and I want to, but I want even more to look after things here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to the masons, Doris, I assure you I&rsquo;m quite  capable of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you are, but I want to be here. So, you needn&rsquo;t  stay unless you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More dirt and rubbish and work!&rdquo; growled Molly, coming in  a little later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s all done now, Molly,&rdquo; cheered Doris; &ldquo;the  masons have finished, and now all that remains&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is for me to break my back clearing away! I do think,  Miss Doris, that you just naturally love to tear down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Molly; you&rsquo;ve struck it. I&rsquo;ve a streak of total  depravity that makes me love distress and destruction, which is what you  usually call my performances. Now, old Plymouth Rock, stop your freting. Didn&rsquo;t  I get you that Hester person to clean and scrub for you? Didn&rsquo;t I get that very  clever Cooper or Hooper or whatever her name is to cook and wash, so you could  have all your time to devote to your dear, cunnin&rsquo; li&rsquo;l Doris child? Didn&rsquo;t I,  Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Doris, you engaged enough servants to run a  hotel, but&rsquo;s fur&rsquo;s I can see, they make as much work as they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fiddle-dee-dee, Molly, and tum-te-tiddy, I-ay, I-ay!  Let out another inch of that widening smile of yours, and remember &rsquo;tis a gay  old world we&rsquo;re living in,&mdash;not a graveyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Miss Doris, I heard the spooks again last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yes</i>, you did!  You <i>must</i> cut out the cucumbers with  cream dressing, Molly. I always knew they wouldn&rsquo;t agree with most folks. Now,  my little faded primrose, please get busy at clearing up this room, for my  devoted swain, one Mr. Guy Prentiss, will, without doubt, call on me at the  sunset hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;ll be because he&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; and Molly began  to wield her broom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, is he as attentive as all that? I hadn&rsquo;t  realised it. I must not encourage the youth, I must repulse him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you an&rsquo; your repulsin&rsquo;! Well you know, Miss Doris,  your repulses is more allurin&rsquo; than other girls&rsquo; invitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me, Mrs. Judd! Well, well, I <i>am</i> surprised! Am I then such a siren?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is, Miss Doris, but you&rsquo;re a  handful. An&rsquo; me an&rsquo; Judd we&rsquo;ve about come to the conclusion that what with your  new-fangled ways, an&rsquo; your extry servants, and your motor car an&rsquo; its chuffer,  an&rsquo; your everlastin&rsquo; tearin&rsquo;s down an&rsquo; cuttin&rsquo;s up, that we ain&rsquo;t needed here  any more, an&rsquo; so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Molly! would you desert me?&rdquo; and Doris fell into a  chair, and dropped her head in her hands, in an attitude of abject despair. Her  shoulders shook, sounds of choked sobs were heard, and whether real or pretended,  a plaintive cry, childish and appealing, smote Molly&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Doris, dear,&mdash;you know you don&rsquo;t need us old  folks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>do</i>,  Molly,&rdquo; and the soft brown mass of curly hair refused to lift itself. &ldquo;I do,&rdquo;  came the smothered voice. &ldquo;You and Judd are all I&rsquo;ve got to stand between me  and the cold world! How&rsquo;d I look, living here alone with a parcel of hired  servants? I couldn&rsquo;t do it! I&rsquo;d have to rent a chaperon. But you and Judd are  the very bulwarks of respectability and protection that I need. Oh, Molly,  dear, solemncholy Molly, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> forsake me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a tantaliser,&rdquo; and the grim old face set itself  against these blandishments. &ldquo;You do need us, an&rsquo; I know it. But you make such  a lot of work, you kick up such a lot of bobbery, that Judd,&mdash;he says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I <i>thought</i> it was Judd who was at the bottom of this disturbance. Now, see here, Molly,  you love me enough to coax old Judd around, don&rsquo;t you? What ails him, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s that Mr. Hardy,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought so! And it&rsquo;s only jealousy, Molly. You  know that as well as I do. Just because Hardy is a little stuffy and important  in his manner, Judd must needs get envious of him! You know, Molly, I have to  have my little car, how could I get along without it? Then naturally, I have to  have somebody to care for it, and to drive me when I don&rsquo;t want to drive  myself. Now, Judd couldn&rsquo;t do those things. So, you coax him up, Molly, and  make him see how much I need you two, and how much more necessary you are than  Hardy. Why I could get a thousand chauffeurs, but where, ladies and gentlemen,  where, I ask you, could I find another couple o&rsquo; Judds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Miss Doris, I&rsquo;ll try to ca&rsquo;m Judd down, an&rsquo; if  you&rsquo;ll speak to Hardy not to be quite so high an&rsquo; mighty,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll speak to Hardy! I&rsquo;ll speak to him with such a  glint in my fiery eye that he&rsquo;ll bite the dust at my feet! You leave Hardy to  me,&mdash;and you look after that sensitive plant that has the honour of being your  better half. And, for the love of St. Michael, Molly, here comes a visitor, and  for a wonder it <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> Mr. Guy! Who is  it? And look at this room! Never mind, show her into the other room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me,&rdquo; the newcomer said, a moment later, as  she smiled into Doris&rsquo; inquiring eyes, &ldquo;but you soon will! I&rsquo;m Madame  Marshall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Marshall?&rdquo; and the brown gaze continued to  inquire, though with pleasant cordiality Doris offered a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m one of Abel Hilton&rsquo;s heirs,&mdash;one of the  unsuccessful ones, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; and though the words were few the courteous  manner gave them warmth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You drew the lucky chance, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was told,&rdquo; and Doris smiled, amusedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; though  nobody dreamed that you were a young girl. I wanted the place, I don&rsquo;t mind  owning up to that, and I even went so far as to offer to buy out the chances of  some of the others,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve rather a bent for speculation,&mdash;but I&rsquo;m mighty glad  they wouldn&rsquo;t sell. I&rsquo;d have been just that much out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you would,&rdquo; agreed Doris. &ldquo;I suppose you thought, like  the others, that the Doris Ballard who drew the chance was my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. Lemmesee, you look a little like her, I  think. Your hair is more brown, but there&rsquo;s a smack of red in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes there is,&rdquo; and Doris laughed. &ldquo;As a kiddy, I had  almost a carrot top, but it darkened a lot of later years, and now it only  shows really red in a bright sunlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I staid here all night, after the funeral of Uncle  Abel,&mdash;and I told the old woman who was here that I was comin&rsquo; to see you.  So,&mdash;here I am, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I do mind?&rdquo; Doris smiled, but looked her guest  squarely in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then of course, I&rsquo;ll be going,&rdquo; and Madame Marshall  started to rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Doris, quickly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go. I invite you to  remain over night. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, thank you. I brought a trunk, in case you  invited me. It&rsquo;s down to the station. Will you send for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Doris, but her heart sank. She had thought  her independent spirit would prevent her from being hospitable to this  unwelcome and uninvited guest, but her natural delicacy and her real inability  to be rude, made her weakly succumb to the invasion. For a premonition told her  that if the lady had brought a trunk, and was of the pushing nature that her  advent indicated, she would by no means depart after one night&rsquo;s stay.</p>
<p>Nor did she. Mrs. Marshall, or Madame Marshall, as she  said she preferred to be called, gently but firmly insinuated herself into the  household and staid on and on, until she quite wore out her originally  unwilling welcome.</p>
<p>At last, old Judd approached Doris on the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a right to fire her, Miss Doris,&rdquo; he declared;  &ldquo;she&rsquo;s no call settlin&rsquo; down here for a week or more! Tell her she must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t do that, Judd. I&rsquo;m sick and tired of seeing  her around, but I can&rsquo;t tell her to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too generous, Miss Doris. You&rsquo;ve got too much  kindness an&rsquo; unselfishness in your big heart for your little bit of a body.  Some day it&rsquo;ll spill over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has, in this case, Judd. But I can&rsquo;t help it.  Sometimes I feel like setting Peter the Headstrong on her,&mdash;but of course, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Doris, you just smile and say what a pleasant  day it is! But, you mark my words, if you let her, she&rsquo;ll stay all summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind so much, if she didn&rsquo;t quiz me and bother  me to bits all the time,&rdquo; Doris sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no fun having a house, if some  old outsider is going to hover over you every minute. I believe I will try to  boost her off, Judd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better get about it, Miss Doris; the longer she stays  the solider she sets.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>So Doris tried to &ldquo;get about it.&rdquo; She threw out delicate  and unoffending hints that she loved solitude and liked to be alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t good for you, child,&rdquo; said Madame Marshall,  with a benevolent smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too young to be at the head of this big  house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem to be able to manage it. That is, when I can have  my own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that you always have, my self-willed little beauty.  Do you know how pretty you are, Doris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t bother me now,&rdquo; and Doris shook her  red-brown mop with a careless gesture. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of such things. I&rsquo;m  devoting all my time and energies to getting this house into shape, and having  every spick speck of it just the way it should be. After that is entirely  completed, I&rsquo;ll begin to think about my personal appearance and manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Marshall laughed pleasantly. &ldquo;What a dear child it  is, to be sure! But, all the same, dearie, you need a guiding hand. If only  your poor, dear mother could have lived to care for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother was a darling, and I wish indeed she could have  lived. But in many ways I am a wiser girl for having had to look out for  myself. I am self-reliant and capable, because of my independent life. You know  George Washington&rsquo;s mother was said to be &lsquo;fond and unthinking&rsquo; in her bringing  up of her son, and my dear mother was like that. So, though I miss her and  mourn her, I know I am braver and better for facing the world alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, my! what a child! I never saw any one like you, Doris  Ballard! Didn&rsquo;t your guardian out West have any authority over you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. He is a very busy man, and I couldn&rsquo;t get on  with his family. George Washington said, &lsquo;there is much greater circumspection  to be observed by a guardian than a natural parent,&rsquo; but my guardian in  Missouri didn&rsquo;t feel that way about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have Washington&rsquo;s sayings and thoughts at your tongue&rsquo;s  end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; and Doris smiled. &ldquo;I read about him all the  time. I don&rsquo;t know how many United States Histories and Lives of Washington I&rsquo;ve  bought since I came here. But I&rsquo;ve heaps of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have plenty of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris looked up resentfully at this bit of rudeness, but  she only said, &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Did your father leave it to you? Or is it Abel  Hilton&rsquo;s fortune. I understood he didn&rsquo;t leave much beside the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go out and look at the spring, Madame Marshall. I&rsquo;m  having a swimming pool built out there. Do you know, this is one of the springs  that the wives of the first Dutch settlers here brought over from Holland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, those darling old, fat Dutch ladies felt sure there  would be no decent drinking water over here, so each one, before she sailed,  slipped out in the night, took up a fine little Dutch spring, hid it in a  churn, and brought it over, quite unknown to her husband. Then she set it  out,&mdash;and that&rsquo;s why there are so many lovely springs and brooks all around  here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you read all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my Washington Irving. Oh, his books are great! And the  ghosts! Why, this section of country is alive with them. You&rsquo;re named for one,  aren&rsquo;t you, my booful Flying Dutchman?&rdquo; She gave a tweak to the smug face of  the Boston Bull, who returned an appreciative growl. &ldquo;And Wolfert Acker&rsquo;s ghost  prowls not very far away; and, oh, there are ghosts prancing about in every  direction, if we could only see them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I! I love every hollow groan and every rattle of  their dear old dry bones! I&rsquo;ve never heard any, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know there are said to be ghosts in your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it; the French soldier who hid the Cutler pearls;  you know about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of him, of course. But I meant of a later  date. Rachel Hilton haunts the place, since you tore down her bay window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does! Have you seen her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know much that I daren&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; and Madame Marshall&rsquo;s  thin lips met in a straight, hard line. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter &nbsp;8<br>
  Doris&rsquo; Strange Experience</b></h2>
<p>Casual inquiry on Doris&rsquo; part failed to get any definite  information as to Madame Marshall&rsquo;s meaning, and not caring much what she  meant, Doris did not pursue the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am clairvoyant,&rdquo; the visitor stated, &ldquo;and I have much  revealed to me that I may not divulge, lest there be serious consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Doris, &ldquo;keep your secrets to yourself.  I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t want to have those serious consequences fall on your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not serious to me, my dear, but to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, are they going to fall on <i>my</i> head? Then, let&rsquo;s drop the subject, before you let slip any  revelation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel a premonition of impending disaster. To you,&mdash;my  dear, brave child, something is about to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it happen! I just love happenings! And I&rsquo;m not afraid  of those serious consequences you referred to. But, as I don&rsquo;t want anything  dire to fall on your head, I am going to suggest that you bring your visit here  to an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you putting me out of your house, you rude child?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to use those words, Madame, but I may as well tell  you frankly, what I am sure you suspect, that you and I are not very congenial  companions and I can&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s good for either of us to bide under the same  roof much longer. I daresay I am rude, but you must remember that I&rsquo;ve had  little of the kind of training you deem so necessary&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a saucy, impertinent chit! You have the  devil-may-care spirit of your father and the red hair of your mother, but you&rsquo;ll  find your pride will have a fall sooner or later! You&rsquo;ve no right to this  house! I don&rsquo;t believe that will was genuine! You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Marshall paused in sheer bewilderment, for Doris  had dropped down on the grass and was rocking back and forth in convulsions of  laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go on!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;do go on! You&rsquo;re so funny when  you get mad! And, as the stories say, &lsquo;you interest me strangely!&rsquo; Uncle Abel&rsquo;s  will not genuine! Perhaps he made another, leaving this house to you. Perhaps  it&rsquo;s hidden in a willow pitcher, or somewhere. That would be one more mystery  for the old place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mysteries of this old place may be more than you  think. And they may have a more baleful influence upon your own destiny than  you think. Have a care how you defy the evil influences that cling round all  these old rooms; there are strong ones at work, even now, as my occult vision  tells me.&rdquo; Madame Marshall had apparently forgotten her anger, and was staring  into space with the blank, intense gaze of a seer.</p>
<p>Doris was interested rather than frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did go for me, you know, and you have no right to  talk to me like that; but I&rsquo;ll forgive you if you&rsquo;ll tell me what you mean. Do  you really have second sight? Isn&rsquo;t that what they call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, little Doris, I have,&rdquo; and now the anger was gone  and the voice of the speaker was low and gentle. &ldquo;It is a gift vouchsafed to  few, but it is my privilege to hear sounds you may not hear,&mdash;to see sights you  may not see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me of them,&rdquo; breathed Doris, fascinated by the woman&rsquo;s  manner and appearance.</p>
<p>Madame Marshall half-closed her long, narrow eyes, and  stood motionless for a moment. Then she gave a few quick gasps, and fairly  flinging her hands up to her drawn and contorted face, she gave a low moan that  ended in a shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;not that! Oh, not that! I <i>beg</i> of you,&mdash;<i>No!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris remained quiet, closely watching the agonised woman,  when attracted by the commotion, for the dogs had begun to howl in sympathy,  Judd and Molly came running to the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ails her?&rdquo; queried Molly, and Doris laid her finger  on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s talking to ghosts.  Don&rsquo;t interrupt her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molly gave a shriek more terrifying than Mrs. Marshall&rsquo;s  disturbance had been, and went flying back to the house. Judd, however, stood  his ground, and said, rather sternly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d stop that nonsense, ma&rsquo;am. You&rsquo;re scarin&rsquo; my  young lady to death,&mdash;to say nothin&rsquo; of my poor wife. What seems to ail ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her alone, Judd,&rdquo; directed Doris. &ldquo;I want to see what  she&rsquo;ll do next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You &rsquo;tend to her then, Miss, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll go look after  Molly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judd went off, with a snort of disdain for the whole  performance, and Mrs. Marshall opened her eyes wide to find Doris looking hard  at her, as if to fathom her sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you be on such terms with those underlings?&rdquo; said  the older lady. &ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself, to act as if they were  your equals. Have you no notion of good breeding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Madame,&rdquo; Doris returned, easily;  &ldquo;you see Judd and Molly understand me and I them. They&rsquo;re trusted and tried old  retainers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old retainers! I suppose you think that sounds grand and  elegant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, rather. Anyway, they are the trustedest and triedest  and oldest retainers I possess, and so, as they&rsquo;re awfully good to me, I love  and respect them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re common, lowbred&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, good people are always well-bred, whatever  their walk in life may be; and common&mdash; means just nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re determined to cling to them, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De-ter-mined. Yes, <i>ma&rsquo;am!</i> Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris had struck an independent attitude, standing very  straight, her hands resting lightly on her hips and her head thrown a little  back, as she scrutinised her strange guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, only,&rdquo; and the tone was most ingratiating, &ldquo;I thought  perhaps you might be enough alive to your own advantage to discharge them, and  take me on for a chaperon, housekeeper and companion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; and Doris made a low, slow bow. &ldquo;I am  deeply appreciative of your kindness, but my one and only answer to your  proposition must be <i>Nevaire!</i> Forgive  me, if you are disappointed, but I can make no other decision. This is my  house, this is my home. Like Caesar&rsquo;s wife, or whoever it was, I came, I saw,  and I am conqueror. There is, I think, nothing more to be said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whistling the dogs to her heel, Doris turned, and with an  ironical wave of her hand, walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness gracious sakes alive!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;if it  hadn&rsquo;t been for your support, Peter and Dutch, I should have fallen down,  kersmack! and that&rsquo;s the truth! Did you ever see such a woman? Now, if she  doesn&rsquo;t go off instanter, I&rsquo;m going to get Mr. Stanchley to put her out! It&rsquo;s  no fair for a poor little girl to be burdened with such an incubus,&mdash;if that&rsquo;s  the word I think it is. Anyway, doggumses, we&rsquo;ll go on a tear, for a mile or  so, and come back all pleasanted up. Us can&rsquo;t allow a bad-tempered clairvoyant  lady to ruffle our sweet, placid disposition, can us? But she most certainly  did come near it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A run with the dogs quite restored Doris&rsquo; equanimity, and  when she returned to the house, she found Molly awaiting her, in depths of  despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She got after me, Miss Doris,&rdquo; Molly said, an unusual  solemnity on her always sad face, &ldquo;and she said as how me an&rsquo; Judd was puttin&rsquo;  you in desp&rsquo;rit danger every minute we staid here with you. She says she&rsquo;s  spook-proof,&mdash;&rsquo;course she didn&rsquo;t say <i>that</i>,  but she got off a lot o&rsquo; stuff that <i>meant</i> that. Anyway, she give me to understand, that we wasn&rsquo;t no sort of protection  for you, an&rsquo; if we didn&rsquo;t get out an&rsquo; let her come here to live, you&rsquo;d be et up  by the spooks&mdash;or&mdash;or somethin&rsquo; awful would happen to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly!&rdquo; and Doris struggled between laughter and  indignation, &ldquo;oh, you blessed old goose! Don&rsquo;t pay any attention to her. She&rsquo;s  going away from this place, if I have to get a constable to put her out! Now,  calm yourself, my old Bunker Hill Monument; don&rsquo;t you dream that you&rsquo;re going  to be ousted,&mdash;I think that&rsquo;s the word I&rsquo;m after,&mdash;by that bunch of foolishness.  I only wish she was the clairvoyant she pretends to be. I&rsquo;d take an interest in  her then. But she&rsquo;s an old fraud, and she&rsquo;s got to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Doris, you wait a minute. Listen to reason.  There is spooks in this house, and I know it. Now, me an&rsquo; Judd, we can&rsquo;t lay &rsquo;em&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay &rsquo;em?&rdquo; repeated Doris, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what they do to ghosts to get rid of &rsquo;em. Lay  &rsquo;em&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like eggs! Well, go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this Madame, she knows all about such things, she  says,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, &lsquo;she says&rsquo;! Now, my dear old person, &mdash;my standby  Molly,&mdash;if you leave me, I&rsquo;ll be desolate indeed! For that Marshall Madame is  going to-day, and that&rsquo;s all there is about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris went to the room of her guest and found her packing  her trunk.</p>
<p>With a sudden compunction at this sight, Doris softened a  little and asked the Madame to stay another day, and go off more leisurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the guest, humbly. &ldquo;You have been most  kind to me, Doris, and though I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re determined to stand in your own  light by retaining those two old people near you, yet of course, you are your  own mistress,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I am!&rdquo; and Doris&rsquo; gentler feelings became ruffled  again at this slight to the Judds. &ldquo;I am sorry I seem to you wilful and  obstinate, but it is my nature, and I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I suppose you can&rsquo;t. Come in, Doris, close the door.  I want at least to give you a word of warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris obeyed the request, and sat down on a couch  wondering whether she would have to get angry again or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; Madame Marshall said, &ldquo;but  there <i>are</i> such things as malevolent  spirits, and as you have seen fit to lay profane hands on Rachel Hilton&rsquo;s  window, you need not be surprised if that restless spirit should appear to you  some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll lay profane hands on her,&rdquo; returned Doris,  gaily. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;d like nothing better than to catch a ghost. Now, if you&rsquo;ve  nothing to tell me except that sort of nonsense, I&rsquo;ll ask you to excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You exasperating child! I hope Rachel does come and scare  you half to death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she comes, too, but she couldn&rsquo;t scare me,&rdquo;  persisted Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Miss,&rdquo; and Madame Marshall looked suddenly  incredulous; &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re so brave, prove it! Will you, out of sheer bravado, go  down to that room where the bay window used to be, tonight at midnight, alone  and with only a candle for light, and lock yourself in there for an hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I? Why, of course I will. But what good would that  do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This good. If you have no uncanny experience, if no hint  is given you of Rachel Hilton&rsquo;s ill will, then, I shall know that she bears you  none, and I can depart from this house in peace, knowing that you rest under no  curse and are in no danger.&rdquo; Madame Marshall looked wistful and kindly, and  Doris suddenly felt that she had misjudged her, and was anxious to make amends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, Madame,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to do it. I&rsquo;m  sure nothing will happen, but I&rsquo;ll do it. Only, don&rsquo;t tell Molly, for she is  superstitious, and she wouldn&rsquo;t sleep a wink if she thought I was up to any  such flapdoodle as that! And don&rsquo;t you lie awake over it, either. I&rsquo;ll run the  whole show, from overture to curtain, and I&rsquo;ll tell you to-morrow morning the  result of my vigil, which will be just plain, everyday nothing! But I&rsquo;ll do  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was only joking, child. Don&rsquo;t really do it. As you  say, nothing would happen. But I am sensitive to these things, and when I have  a premonition, it is a rare occurrence that it is not a true one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;ll do it; I said I would and I will. Shall we  say I&rsquo;m to go into that room, and sit there by my flickering candle&rsquo;s light  from twelve to one, this very night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you waken at that unearthly hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a little alarm clock, a tiny affair that will wake  no one else. I&rsquo;ll set that for twelve; and then, I&rsquo;ll go downstairs, afoot and  alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it unless you really wish to,&rdquo; and Madame  Marshall shivered a little. &ldquo;I confess I&rsquo;m pretty nervous, to-day, and, if you  please, we&rsquo;ll say no more about it, and you go or not as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The handsome face did look haggard, and the long black  eyes seemed weary, so Doris made a laughing reply and ran away to look after  her own affairs.</p>
<p>But that night, when the tinkle of the little clock woke  her, Doris jumped out of bed, and solemnly donned a fluffy frilled negligee, a  belaced and beribboned cap, and thrust her little bare feet into brocaded satin  mules.</p>
<p>Then, taking her candle, in its old, brass candlestick,  she went softly down stairs and into the room from which she had so ruthlessly  torn the offending bay window.</p>
<p>The old house was very still, and the creak of certain  steps made slight sounds which, however, were too faint to waken Mrs. Marshall  or the servants in the third story.</p>
<p>From the foot of the stairs, Doris went straight into the  room,&mdash;the north one of the two front rooms,&mdash;and as the blinds were already  drawn she had only to set her candle on a convenient stand, and take up her  vigil.</p>
<p>She chose a comfortable armchair, and, though fearing she  might fall asleep, she felt no drowsy inclination.</p>
<p>At first, she thought over her house; thought about the  work done and that still to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost through,&rdquo; her thoughts ran; &ldquo;next week we can  get the walls painted and the ceilings fixed up in these rooms and the halls,  and then there&rsquo;s only the library shelves and ceiling to paint,&mdash;and there you  are! Oh, what a comfort that I could do it all! Suppose my daddy hadn&rsquo;t left me  enough money to live as I want to live. And, goodness knows I don&rsquo;t want  much,&mdash;I mean in the way of grandeur or luxury, but, I do want this place to be <i>right</i>, and it is,&mdash;or will be soon.  Gracious! what was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris heard a sound, a vague, faint sound, but  unmistakably a sigh,&mdash;a soft, long-drawn sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagination,&rdquo; she said to herself, scornfully. &ldquo;I wish it <i>had</i> been a ghost, but it wasn&rsquo;t  anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a moment later, she heard it again. A mere breath of  sound, and fading to a silence more awesome than the sound itself.</p>
<p>And then Doris heard the throbbing of her own heart, and  it was going at a trip-hammer gait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; she said, in an audible whisper, &ldquo; &rsquo;deed I&rsquo;m not  afraid. If it&rsquo;s a ghost, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be glad&mdash; I guess I&rsquo;ll be glad, but somehow,  I think it was the wind. I didn&rsquo;t realise what a wind has sprung up. It&rsquo;s been  such a pleasant day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She babbled aloud to herself, in a low voice, because it  was pleasanter than that queer silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it has stopped,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t believe I  heard anything, anyway. It was my imagination. Oh! my heavens! there it is  again! It <i>must</i> be the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But whatever it was, it was clearly not the wind, for as  Doris peeped from the window, she saw there was not a leaf stirring.</p>
<p>She gave a little jump away, for she suddenly remembered  that was the place where the bay window had been, and a strange, eerie feeling  took possession of her.</p>
<p>She resumed her seat, quivering in every nerve, but  bravely assuring herself of her own courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too silly,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;to think there&rsquo;s  anything here that doesn&rsquo;t belong here. There are no ghosts, I know there aren&rsquo;t!  I&rsquo;m going to get a book and read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were few books in the old room, for it was not yet  really arranged for living, there being yet painting to be done in it.</p>
<p>But a few very old books were there in a pile, and these  Doris looked over, humming a gay little tune the while.</p>
<p>They were books that she had found in the old attic,  tucked away in the gabled end room up there, and perhaps unearthed by the  workmen who were doing her rebuilding.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t sure, for she had not yet found time to look  them over,&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t even know what era they belonged to.</p>
<p>She opened one, and it was a very old copy of &ldquo;Fox&rsquo;s Book  of Martyrs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ought to be a valuable old volume,&rdquo; she thought;  &ldquo;and interesting. But what awful pictures!&rdquo; One glance at the depicted horrors  of the martyrs was enough for Doris in her present state of mind, and she  hastily shut the book and laid it down.</p>
<p>As she did so, she heard again the soft sound, and now it  was a vocalised effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dor&mdash;is,&rdquo; the voice seemed to say, as though the word were  difficult of enunciation. &ldquo;Dor&mdash;is,&mdash;be-ware&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not hollow or threatening; it was not even  frightful, save as the weird situation made it seem so, but in another moment  Doris felt her flesh grow cold and her hands tremble as she heard distinctly, &lsquo;&lsquo;I&mdash;am&mdash;Rachel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Distinct, but so low as to have been inaudible, had there  been any other sound to drown it. But in that unearthly, that uncanny silence,  the voice sounded like a clear, ghostly note from a spirit world.</p>
<p>But, though frightened so that her teeth chattered, Doris  was plucky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you are Rachel,&rdquo; she said, herself  speaking softly, but clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My window,&mdash;&rdquo; came the voice again, and this time so faint  was it, that Doris scarce caught the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-now,&rdquo; Doris began, in what she hoped was a casual tone,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> afraid, you know. If you&rsquo;re really  the ghost of Rachel Hilton, I want to know it. I don&rsquo;t for one minute  be-believe you are&mdash; but if you are, I&rsquo;d like to be sure of it. Give me some  sign&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as Doris said the words, the candle, which was nearly  a whole one when she brought it down, flickered and almost went out.</p>
<p>Really scared now, Doris bent her gaze on the candle. Tall  and straight it stood, but by no means burnt to its socket or near it, yet as  she looked, the wick burst into a brighter flame, then the light  dimmed,&mdash;flickered twice and went out.</p>
<p>The room was in black darkness, and the silence was  profound.</p>
<p>Doris never knew how she got out of that room.</p>
<p>She tried to scream, but her voice died in her throat from  sheer vocal inability.</p>
<p>Trembling, gasping, she managed to reach the door,  unlocked it, and somehow crawled upstairs to her own room.</p>
<p>She flung herself into her own bed, and lay there  trembling and almost hysterical.</p>
<p>She was wide awake, she was keenly aware of everything  that had happened, and she knew that though the voice, the words, might be the  result of her own over-stimulated imagination, no imagination could have made  that candle go out. There was no draught in the room, but even if there had  been, it would have blown out the flame, not caused it to dwindle, flicker and  die before her very eyes.</p>
<p>And she had asked for a sign.</p>
<p>Well, she had received one, and if that was the way houses  were haunted, she had had enough of it!</p>
<p>After a long time, from very exhaustion and nerve strain,  Doris fell into a troubled sleep, but it was full of awful dreams, and she  welcomed at last the dawning of the day. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  Doris And Miss Luella</b></h2>
<p>Doris kept her own counsel regarding the events of that  night. When Madame Marshall quizzed her next morning with frank curiosity, she  refused to give any account of her experiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something strange did happen, Madame Marshall,&rdquo; she said,  &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what it was. It may have been a simple, natural  occurrence, and my imagination made it seem weird, or &mdash;it may have been&mdash;I don&rsquo;t  know what! But I&rsquo;m not going to talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Marshall was clearly disappointed, even angry, and  exclaimed, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s mean of you, when you know how interested I am. At  least tell me if you saw a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Doris, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that plainly. I did  not see any ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Rachel Hilton didn&rsquo;t haunt you. I&rsquo;m thankful for  that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself to be thankful on my account. As I  told you I&rsquo;m not afraid of ghosts, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t fool me, Doris Ballard! You&rsquo;re scared to death  this minute! I can see it in your eyes! Do tell me what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixie!&rdquo; and Doris forced a gay laugh. &ldquo;If there are  ghosts about this house, they&rsquo;re <i>my</i> ghosts, and I share their secrets with nobody. You&rsquo;re going away to-day, Madame  Marshall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the older woman, but with a show of  hesitation. &ldquo;I suppose you want me to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to be frank, I do. I begin to think I&rsquo;m like my  Uncle Abel, I like solitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Solitude nothing! You&rsquo;re glad enough to have your young  friends around you. You love to go to see them, and have them come here. You  enjoy the country club&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know those things don&rsquo;t seem strange to me. When  you were my age, didn&rsquo;t you like young company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I did. I s&rsquo;pose I <i>am</i> an old woman, and no young girl could be expected to have kindly  feelings toward me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This pathetic speech didn&rsquo;t move Doris deeply, for she  knew it was simply a bid for sympathy and for an invitation to remain longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re far from being an old woman, as you well know,&rdquo;  she replied smiling; &ldquo;but all the same I can&rsquo;t conveniently have guests staying  in the house while these repairs are going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then, I&rsquo;ll go now, and return for a visit later in  the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know what to say to you,&rdquo; and Doris looked  truly perplexed; &ldquo;I must live up to the traditions of this house; I want to be  worthy of it, and I suppose hospitality is one of the first virtues I must  cultivate. But it does seem as if a girl of my age has a right to expect to  make friends with people near her own age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m a relative, rather than a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A relative?&rdquo; and Doris&rsquo; eyebrows arched themselves. &ldquo;How  do you make that out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Rachel Hilton&rsquo;s cousin&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my dear lady, I&rsquo;m in no way related to Rachel Hilton.  She was Uncle Abel&rsquo;s second wife; and anyway, my mother was a Hilton, you know.  She was no relation to Rachel. I don&rsquo;t count the connections by marriage in my  family as the family itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I accept your invitation to return later in  the summer, and I&rsquo;ll get off to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran away, leaving Doris aghast at her assumption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well of all the nerve!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed, speaking, as  often, to the dogs. &ldquo;Peter the Headstrong, I doubt if your old namesake had  such effrontery! Seems to me I&rsquo;ll have to fight fire with fire, and manage some  way to keep her away from my own little vine and fig-tree. I&rsquo;ll speak to  Stanchion about it, he&rsquo;ll know what to do. Though between you and me and the  Flying Dutchman, Peter, I don&rsquo;t think old Stanchy has such a lot of nerve  himself. Guy Prentiss is a good friend, I&rsquo;ll ask his advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris had quickly become a favourite among the young  people, but her interest in her new home was to her paramount as yet. She went  occasionally to the Club, she had many callers and sometimes returned calls,  but for the most part she was absorbed in her building, or rather restoring  plans, and she frankly said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the house is all in ship-shape condition,&rdquo; she told  Ruth Prentiss, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a big party, and then, after that, I&rsquo;ll be a good  citizen. But now I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young men flocked round like bees in a blossom  orchard, for Doris was fascinating as well as pretty, and her charm was not  diminished by her gay indifference or her lack of insistent cordiality. She  smiled on them all, but she was capricious and never hesitated to send the  &ldquo;bothering boys&rdquo; away, if she wanted to consult with the workmen about the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re spending a lot of money on the place, Doris,&rdquo; Hugh  Stanchley observed to her one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Stanchion, but it&rsquo;s time somebody did. I don&rsquo;t  believe Uncle Abel put a dollar&rsquo;s worth of repair on it all the time he lived  here&mdash;except, of course, to build that bay window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a tight-fisted old chap, but then, he was not a  rich man. You are fortunate, Doris, in having the means to restore the old  house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, indeed. You see, my daddy made that lucky  speculation shortly before he died, and left mother and me plenty. But the  trick is, to know how to spend it. Not one in a thousand could do up that  darling old house as I&rsquo;ve done it. And it&rsquo;s nearly finished now. Only the  interior decorators&rsquo; work, and that&rsquo;s delayed most aggravatingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interior decorations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, only white paint. Not a scrap of wall paper in the  house, except in the dormered rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after it&rsquo;s all finished, then are you going to settle  down and become a good little member of the young set here, and have beaux and  all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, some time in the future, yes. But the house is my  sweetheart, now. And, say, Stanchy, as soon as I get time, I&rsquo;m going to put up  a thorough hunt for those lost pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well hunt for the Fountain of Immortal Youth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I found that long ago! But I feel convinced that the  pearls are still on my property, somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell Miss Cutler that. By the way, she&rsquo;s  over at the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over at Mrs. Busby&rsquo;s? Where you board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she comes every summer for a few weeks. Want to meet  her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do! Let&rsquo;s go right over there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impulsive Doris caught up a hat and gloves, and together  they started off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll like her, I know,&rdquo; Stanchley said, as they walked  along. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the old-school type, and I know you&rsquo;ll admire her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is her name Cutler, if she&rsquo;s a descendant of the  original Luella?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not direct. The brother of the original Luella was the  ancestor of this Miss Luella. She&rsquo;s terribly proud of the family line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there many Cutlers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, very few. She has a nephew Looly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looly! What a name for a man! Or, was he named for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think not,&mdash;there&rsquo;s Mrs. Busby on the porch, now,  and Miss Cutler with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Doris had anticipated, she was charmed with the little  lady. Luella Cutler seemed like a real link with the past days, for, though not  really very old, she was old-fashioned, and her prim, courteous ways delighted  modern Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wonderful!&rdquo; the girl said, looking in frank  admiration at the picturesque spinster. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to buy you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever I&rsquo;m put up at auction, I hope you&rsquo;ll bid me in,&rdquo;  laughed Miss Cutler. &ldquo;You have such a capable air, I&rsquo;m sure you could take care  of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Deed I could!&rdquo; and Doris flung wide her expressive  arms, in a gesture of protection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Doris!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Busby, &ldquo;you can do anything  you set out to, I believe. It&rsquo;s amazing the way you&rsquo;ve fixed up that house. You  must &rsquo;a&rsquo; spent a mint o&rsquo; money on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not a whole mint full! I&rsquo;ve only made necessary  repairs and alterations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, an&rsquo; knocked off that bay! I declare to goodness it  gave me the creeps when I heard you done that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it? Well, get over creeping, for it&rsquo;s off for good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet the ghost of Rachel Hilton&rsquo;ll haunt you! You  keep a watch out for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more interested in another ghost. What I want is to  meet the gay young French soldier, who hid the Cutler pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris glanced at Miss Cutler, who said little then, but  who, later on, asked Doris to go with her to her room, to see a miniature of  the first old-time Luella Cutler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a peach!&rdquo; exclaimed Doris, when shown the lovely  portrait of the Revolutionary belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was an acknowledged beauty,&rdquo; returned Miss Cutler,  pleased at Doris&rsquo; praise. &ldquo;The pearls round her throat in that picture are the  ones that were hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, honestly, Miss Cutler, don&rsquo;t you think they&rsquo;re still  hidden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, my dear. That has always been my opinion, though it&rsquo;s  only an opinion. I&rsquo;ve no real reason for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there is reason,&rdquo; Doris said, earnestly. &ldquo;For I  feel sure that young man never would have placed them in a pitcher or tankard,  that was sitting around in plain sight! It was hidden or buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buried, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve often thought. But after all  these years, with no directions as to the spot, it would be impossible to dig  for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. But I think we can find directions, somehow,  somewhere, if we&rsquo;re only clever enough. And I&rsquo;m going to try. Shall you be here  long, Miss Cutler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month or more. But, my dear child, don&rsquo;t let your  enthusiasm run away with you. Remember, the Cutlers for generations have been  far more anxious to solve the mystery than you can possibly be, and they&rsquo;ve  tried every possible way to fathom it. It isn&rsquo;t likely you can succeed any  better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know it isn&rsquo;t. But I&rsquo;m going to have a try at it.  Do you know anything about the family plate that was in the house at that  time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not definitely. All the families of that day had big,  old-fashioned silverware on their sideboards. Not sterling silver, but  Sheffield, or some such plate. It was called the family plate, even if there  were but a few unpretentious bits. Of course, that would have been scattered  and sold long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Cutler, let&rsquo;s discard the idea of the plate on  the sideboard. Nobody would be such a goose as to drop a string of pearls into  a dish or tankard on an exposed sideboard. No. That plate was hidden, as lots  of things were, from the Hessians, and so when we find the hidden container, we&rsquo;ll  find the thing contained!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the willow pitcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There again, let&rsquo;s give that poor young man credit for  some common sense. He never would hide pearls in an ordinary, as they were  then, willow pitcher. You know, his speech was disjointed and incoherent, and I  think he meant to say more,&mdash;perhaps that the room where the willow pitcher was,  looked out over the place where the thing was hidden,&mdash;or that the bits of a  broken willow pitcher marked the spot, or,&mdash;oh, he could have meant so many  things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he could,&rdquo; and Miss Luella sighed. &ldquo;I wish I could  find the pearls. I&rsquo;d treasure them as an heirloom, quite apart from their real  value. In fact, I doubt if they were so very valuable, although they may have  been. Our family still has a standing offer of ten thousand dollars reward, so  if you succeed in your search&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be enough reward to give you the pleasure of  their restoration; but of course if I do find them, I shall consider myself  entitled to the prize money. Tell me of the ghost, won&rsquo;t you? Have you any  personal knowledge of his appearance?&rdquo; Miss Cutler looked disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one reason I&rsquo;m always here in August,&rdquo; she said,  in a low tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never really seen anything supernatural, but I&rsquo;ve noticed  inexplicable circumstances. I&mdash;I hate to talk of these things to a young girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go ahead, you can&rsquo;t scare me. Why, my house is full  of ghosts,&mdash;they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris stopped, for she had determined to tell no one of  her experience in the bay-window room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they do?&rdquo; asked Miss Luella, her eyes growing  large with interest, and an expression of alarm on her gentle face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much, as yet. But I daresay they&rsquo;re not really  started. My knowledge of them so far is mostly legendary. Tell me more of the  Frenchman. What is he reputed to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are but traditions with me, too. I&rsquo;ve heard my aunts  tell of the phantom&rsquo;s appearance, always in August, and always in the house,  never out on the lawn,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As might be expected, if he had buried anything! Oh, <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> it exciting! And what does he <i>do?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Searches. Hunts the rooms and halls, and wanders with  never ceasing step around and around the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he been seen? The ghost, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the stories, yes. But you know how such  tales grow. Every one who tells them adds a little, and, perhaps &rsquo;twas merely  imagination in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know! Something tells me I shall yet see or  hear that phantom. You see, it&rsquo;s my house, now, and I took over all ghosts with  the title deeds! I own those ghosts, and if they don&rsquo;t manifest themselves to  me, I shall feel defrauded!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child! How you talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you talk! I should think so!&rdquo; and Mrs. Busby came in  at the open door. &ldquo; &rsquo;Scuse me, but I couldn&rsquo;t help hearin&rsquo; as I was passin&rsquo;  by.&rdquo; And with an air of curiosity that justified her reputation for it,  Busybody Busby sat down without being asked. &ldquo;I just chanced to hear you was  talkin&rsquo; about the Le Fevre ghost, an&rsquo; I was that interested, I couldn&rsquo;t keep  out. Don&rsquo;t mind, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Miss Cutler, politely, but she changed  the subject and spoke of some casual matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Busby, folding and patting her  handkerchief, &ldquo;but let&rsquo;s go back to ghosts. They do say, Doris, that you want  to see some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they?&rdquo; laughed the girl. &ldquo;But, Mrs. Busby, they say so  many things about me! It&rsquo;s fortunate I don&rsquo;t mind being talked about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. My, how the gossips do run on about you! And  your clo&rsquo;es! They think you&rsquo;re a reg&rsquo;lar stylisher for dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I am. I love pretty clothes, and I like to have  them just right for any occasion. Don&rsquo;t you like these togs?&rdquo; and Doris looked  down at her smart sport skirt and silk sweater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Busby, &ldquo;but they do look terribly  expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Doris, looking at her calmly, &ldquo;is the gossips&rsquo;  business, not ours. Now I must fly home. Won&rsquo;t you come to see me, Miss Luella,  some day soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, with pleasure, my dear child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Doris, you may take that as a compliment!&rdquo;  exclaimed Mrs. Busby. &ldquo;Miss Cutler, she &rsquo;most never goes anywhere around here.  Though o&rsquo; course, she&rsquo;s just goin&rsquo; over to see the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely,&rdquo; and Luella Cutler smiled at Doris, to whom  she had felt attracted at once. &ldquo;But we can hunt together for the lost pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then let me come, too,&rdquo; pleaded Mrs. Busby. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  awful good at searchin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you found them long ago, then?&rdquo; laughed  Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they ain&rsquo;t there. I&rsquo;ve got a little sense, I  hope, an&rsquo; I mighty well know those pearls was found an&rsquo; carried off pretty soon  after they was hid. But I&rsquo;ll come to your search party all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Cutler,&rdquo; cried Doris, struck with a new idea,  &ldquo;suppose that family plate was the door-plate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luella Cutler laughed outright. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at all sure they  had door-plates in those days, and if they did, one couldn&rsquo;t hide pearls in  it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Course not!&rdquo; put in Mrs. Busby, but Doris interrupted,  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that, but I&rsquo;ve a sort of an idea that there might have been a  paper describing the hiding-place, and the paper could have been stuck in the  door-plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was flat against the door, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not. Maybe it was a bit loose, and he stuck a paper  in back of it,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he did, but I can&rsquo;t see that that gets us any  farther. Where&rsquo;s the door-plate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where indeed!&rdquo; sighed Doris. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing sure,  I&rsquo;m going to set up a hunt while you&rsquo;re here, Miss Cutler, and if I find  nothing, at least there&rsquo;s no harm done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; chimed in Mrs. Busby, who could never keep  quiet long. &ldquo;Say, Doris, how&rsquo;d you get along with that Madame Marshall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Doris, a little shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you did! I&rsquo;ll bet she bothered you &rsquo;most to pieces.  Didn&rsquo;t she quiz you a lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t let myself be quizzed, unless I want to be,&rdquo; and  Doris smiled at her present questioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mis&rsquo; Marshall, she told me she b&rsquo;lieved the ghost  of Rachel Hilton was a hauntin&rsquo; over there. She was a spiritualist, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, Mrs. Marshall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Rachel. Why they do say,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mrs. Busby,&rdquo; and Doris clapped her hands over her  ears, already covered by her curly, tawny waves of hair, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear  what other people say. Your opinions are, of course, worth listening to, but  spare me your hearsay evidence. And, too, you&rsquo;ll make Miss Cutler think I&rsquo;m a  ghost stalker! Truly, Miss Luella, I&rsquo;ve little, interest in the creatures,  except as they belong to the atmosphere of my house. And, according to my  friend, Mr. Washington Irving, all this section is the legitimate property of  witches and warlocks, of haunts and wraiths; but I like them vague and  traditional, not definite and subjects of town tattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The traditions of your home, then, are more dear to you,  than proof of their veracity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as to ghosts. But more than all that sort of thing,  I love my traditions of Washington and his occupancy of my house. Why, often I  sit alone in the room he used to have, and I can fancy his spirit is there, not  a phantom, at all, but his dear, splendid influence and just the thoughts of  his noble, great soul, and the memories of his great deeds seem like a vision  of glory! You&rsquo;ve no idea how I revere and love the place for his sake. It has,  in some ways, transformed my whole being,&mdash;changed my whole nature. I never  before was a hero-worshipper, but I never before found a hero worth such  worship. I never knew ideals so fine and true as those he reverenced. You see,  I&rsquo;ve read up a lot about him, since I live in his house. I call it his house,  because, if he didn&rsquo;t own it when he lived in it, he does now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hifalutin talk, Doris,&rdquo; commented Mrs. Busby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; and Doris smiled with a lovely faraway look  in her big, brown eyes. &ldquo;But hifalutin isn&rsquo;t what I really feel,&mdash;if my way of  expression does make it seem so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that,&rdquo; said Miss Cutler, understandingly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter &nbsp;10<br>
  Doris And Abby Rackham</b></h2>
<p>It was in the early part of August that Doris received a  letter from Abby Rackman, saying she was on her way to New York and would like  to stop over and stay a day or two at the old house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I kinda sorta like that letter, Dutchman,&rdquo; Doris  observed to the smug-faced Bull pup, &ldquo;and as she&rsquo;s bound to come anyway, I  believe I&rsquo;ll be a little bit cordial about it. I&rsquo;m not overly-hospitable, as  you know, Dutch, and if I can throw a gleam of light across the humdrum life of  a Maine school-marm, I solemnly believe I ought to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris jumped up, upsetting both the dog and his dignity,,  and ran to tell Molly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Miss Doris; that Rackham old maid ain&rsquo;t such a  bad sort, but I hope to goodness she don&rsquo;t land up here for a month or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-sir-ee! I shall set the time for her to arrive and  leave. That&rsquo;s the proper way, Molly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be the proper way for proper people, but you don&rsquo;t  know the stayin&rsquo; propensities of some folks! Remember the Marshall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do! But somehow, Abby&rsquo;s letter sounds rather pleasant.  Molly, you know that morning that Madame Marshall went away, did you notice a  candle in the north parlour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. &rsquo;Twas your own bedroom candlestick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was. What did you do with the candle? Anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now I don&rsquo;t remember. Yes, seems to me I put in a  fresh one, and put the whole business back in your bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do with the old candle? Why did you change  it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laws, Miss Doris, I dunno. You gettin&rsquo; scrimpy all of a  sudden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was a fairly new candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it? Well, it was kinda short and sorta dusty-lookin&rsquo;  and,&mdash;oh, Je-rusalem! I didn&rsquo;t know you was goin&rsquo; to hold me to account for  every scrap-end of candle! I like to keep things tidy around your bedroom, and  if I put in a new candle, I s&rsquo;pose it was &rsquo;cause I thought the old one wasn&rsquo;t  all it should be! If you&rsquo;re so fussy particular, I don&rsquo;t believe you an&rsquo; me can  get along together. I guess I&rsquo;ll be packin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Doris was getting used to these  threats. &ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t stinginess. I just wanted to <i>see</i> that candle, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see it! Land, Miss Doris, are you spyin&rsquo; on me to see  if I waste? I just guess you can&rsquo;t find a thriftier housekeeper&rsquo;n what I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there now, Molly, my own old Soldiers&rsquo; and Sailors&rsquo;  Monument, don&rsquo;t fly off the reel like that! We&rsquo;ll drop the bone of contention,  for I see you don&rsquo;t know what you did with the candle. Now, let&rsquo;s bury the  hatchet and return to our Rackham muttons. I&rsquo;m going to write for her to come  along, and stay from Tuesday till Friday, that&rsquo;s as long as I can devote to  her, unless she turns out to be a charmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Doris, nobody&rsquo;d ever pick Abby Rackham up for a  charmer! But she&rsquo;s got good common sense, which is more&rsquo;n I can say for some  folks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning you and Judd?&rdquo; asked Doris, with an innocent  gaze, and she ran away to write her letter.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Solemn Molly was right. Nobody, of any discrimination,  could call Abby Rackham a charmer. But she was innately good-hearted, and her  shrewd keen insight made her a satisfactory guest and an interesting person to  talk to. She was the typical country school-ma&rsquo;am, and seemed dryly aware of  it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a bit like your mother,&rdquo; she said, as she  scrutinised Doris on her arrival. &ldquo;She was a lolling sort, you&rsquo;re up and  coming! I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;s I ever saw such a live piece of property as you seem to  be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You read character quickly,&rdquo; and Doris smiled  appreciatively. &ldquo;How do you know I&rsquo;m capable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I said you were that, but of course you  are. You use your hands as if you had all your power at your fingers&rsquo; ends.  Your glance is as quick as a flash, you take in everything at once. If I were  to vanish this minute, you could enumerate and describe everything I have on,  both visible and unseen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious!&rdquo; and Doris stared at her, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re  sizing me up quite as thoroughly as you think I do you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m quick-witted enough. I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;d be  if I weren&rsquo;t. But you&rsquo;ve got lots besides quick wits. You&rsquo;ve got experience and  knowledge and you&rsquo;ve seen the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not such a lot of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what you did see wasn&rsquo;t in Maine! I&rsquo;m glad you let  me come here. Just to look at you is educating. And Lord knows I want  educating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you a school teacher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said educating, not education. Though I&rsquo;d like a lot  more of that, too. Now, where&rsquo;m I going to sleep? I&rsquo;d like to get located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris showed her guest to a pleasant room, made sure that  she had everything she required, and then went off about her own affairs.</p>
<p>They met again at dinner time, and Abby, looking a little  bewildered, asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, is that stylish? To go off and leave your company  alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I didn&rsquo;t mean to be inhospitable. Were you lonely? I  thought you&rsquo;d look about the house a bit and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it was all right, and I&rsquo;m not offended. I told  you I wanted to learn things, and I meant just such things as that. Now, where  I live, we&rsquo;d never think of leaving a visitor, that is, unless we had work to  do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I did have some things to look after, but I&rsquo;ve been  brought up differently from you, perhaps. Yes, I&rsquo;ve always thought it right to  leave a guest to herself part of the time, but if you&rsquo;d prefer it, I&rsquo;ll stand  by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I want to do as you usually do, all the time I&rsquo;m  here. Do you have beaux in the evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; and Doris smiled amusedly. &ldquo;But if any call  to-night, you shall see them too. I won&rsquo;t exclude you. If you don&rsquo;t care to see  callers, I&rsquo;ll not either. Truly, Abby, I want you to have a pleasant visit, and  if I don&rsquo;t make it so, tell me. I&rsquo;m only a young hostess, and to tell truth, I&rsquo;m  not terribly hospitable, by nature. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m selfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; rejoined Abby, as they seated themselves at  the dinner table. The old low-raftered dining-room, with its enormous  fireplace, seemed to pour forth the hospitality that Doris disclaimed, and Abby  took her place with a deep sigh of enjoyment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at last,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;I can say truly I am glad  you got this house. You know I was one of the names in the hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I s&rsquo;pose that Marshall woman told you what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I said that if I did get the place I&rsquo;d sell it for  a hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ab-by Rack-ham! I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed that of you  if any one else had told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can believe it, for it&rsquo;s true. But, think,  child. I wouldn&rsquo;t have had the means to fix it up as you&rsquo;ve done. I knew it  needed to have that bay taken off, and the roof fixed over and all, but as I  couldn&rsquo;t do it, all I thought of was to sell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to strangers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! Who could be more of a stranger than you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least, I&rsquo;m related to the Hilton people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know; we all were. But the Hiltons didn&rsquo;t live here  always. It isn&rsquo;t like an ancestral home, you know. Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t have any  sentiment about it, and I&rsquo;d been glad to sell it. Now, I s&rsquo;pose you don&rsquo;t like  me any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I do. And I like your honesty in speaking right  out. But I&rsquo;m glad you didn&rsquo;t get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;d be glad of that, anyway, for if I&rsquo;d had it, you  couldn&rsquo;t have. But I&rsquo;m going to give you some advice, my little girl. I&rsquo;ve  thought it over, and I think it&rsquo;s right that I should. First off, I said to  myself, I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you, but seeing that you&rsquo;re so understanding, I think I  will. And it&rsquo;s this. You want to be careful about some of the other heirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any other heirs.&rdquo; Doris&rsquo; serene face beamed  at Abby across the candle-lit table, and the red-brown head tossed a little  proudly, as the girl glanced around the beloved room. &ldquo;It was by chance, I  know, but I won the chance, and this is mine, just as surely as if bequeathed  to me direct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know it. I don&rsquo;t mean that. I mean the other people  who hoped to be heirs. Can&rsquo;t you imagine that there was more or less jealousy  and envy at your success and their failure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, but all I think is that I&rsquo;m sorry for their  disappointment, but glad of my own good fortune. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure, Abby  Rackham, that any one of them, in my place, would feel the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would, most of them. The others wouldn&rsquo;t even be  sorry for the disappointments! Now, Doris some of those people are by no means  friendly toward you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry! But what can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing definite. But I want to put you on your guard.  They mean to bother you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can they? I&rsquo;m secure in my inheritance. They can&rsquo;t take  it from me. All the law business has been carefully looked after by Mr.  Stanchley, who was Uncle Abel&rsquo;s lawyer. Are you trying to scare me, Abby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to let you know the truth. There are some who mean,  even yet, to get the property away from you. They think you&rsquo;re a young girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without an old head on your shoulders&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s seventeen years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they think they can fix up some way to defraud you.  Now, I don&rsquo;t know anything definite, or I&rsquo;d tell you, but do, Doris, I beg of  you, be on your guard against any of them who make any advances regarding the  place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regarding the place! Abby, you&rsquo;re crazy! What could they  do to me or to this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; and Miss Rackham shook her head doggedly, &ldquo;they  think they can. Didn&rsquo;t Madame Marshall say anything about it? Haven&rsquo;t you heard  from Ermyntrude Whiting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to both questions. Abby, you&rsquo;ve got a foolish notion  that doesn&rsquo;t mean a thing. Forget it, and let&rsquo;s enjoy ourselves in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Miss Rackham kept her own counsel for the most part,  but once or twice she again took occasion to warn Doris of possible fraud or  trickery directed against her.</p>
<p>The second night of Abby&rsquo;s visit, Guy Prentiss called.  Doris insisted on Abby&rsquo;s presence, and nothing loath, the guest acquiesced.</p>
<p>Young Prentiss was a well-mannered chap, and his pleasant  attentions to the visiting spinster won her heart. Under the influence of his  gay chatter, she expanded like a flower to the balm of summer days. As the talk  fell naturally upon old furniture and antiques, Prentiss told of some heirlooms  his mother had. And Abby, suddenly reminded, told of an old picture her mother  had once owned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she left it to me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m ashamed to  say, I sold it to an antique dealer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you got its value,&rdquo; laughed Guy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you did!&rdquo; exclaimed Doris. &ldquo;What sort of  a picture, Abby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a doleful thing! A spider-waisted lady, under a tree,  weeping over the grave of her husband! There was a funeral urn, no not an urn,  a headstone, and an inscription on it to her dear departed. Why, Doris, it was  too gloomy to have on your wall, or I&rsquo;d wish I&rsquo;d kept it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it very old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very! Mother&rsquo;s great aunt gave it to her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Abby Rackham. You ought to be ashamed of yourself to  sell that! Who bought it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old dealer up where I live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he got it yet? Of course not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he has. I tell you, Doris, it&rsquo;s no good. It isn&rsquo;t a  fine painting, you know. I think some amateur did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably the widow herself,&rdquo; suggested Guy. &ldquo;Well, if you  want it, Doris, why don&rsquo;t you go up there and track it down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will, when I get time. But as soon as you go  home, Abby, you go and see if you can rescue it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will, but I know when you see it, you won&rsquo;t  want it. A thing like that isn&rsquo;t desirable merely because it&rsquo;s old. It must  have some merit of its own too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no collector!&rdquo; and Doris frowned at her. &ldquo;I want  to see it, anyhow, whether I use it or not. But I think it would be just the  thing to hang in this old house. It&rsquo;s awfully hard to get just right  pictures,&mdash;furniture is easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; and Abby smiled; &ldquo;because the furniture has  merit in itself, and is hoarded or sold. But the pictures of that day, except  for some worthwhile portraits, were mostly rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Doris,&rdquo; agreed Guy. &ldquo;Still, I hope you get  the sorrowful dame, if you want her. Ugh! I know those old graveyard pictures!  I&rsquo;ve seen engravings of them. They make me shudder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guy went away and the two friends sat chatting. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a  nice chap,&rdquo; Abby said, as if after due thought. &ldquo;Shall you accept him, Doris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, why, Abby, are you a matchmaker? I never thought of  such a thing, nor Guy either. We&rsquo;re just kids and good friends. In fact there  are several boys around here that I like better than I do Guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s desperately in love with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! that&rsquo;s your vivid imagination. Our crowd is the  younger set. We don&rsquo;t think about love or lovers. Some day, in the dim future,  I&rsquo;m going to put my mind to it, and choose my life-mate, but not for years  yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will he be like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just like George Washington. He&rsquo;s my ideal for  everything. Do you suppose, Abby, there&rsquo;s a man like him in the world to-day? A  man with a real nobility of soul, with fine ideals and true standards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so, Doris, dear, and if there is, I hope he  will be your fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abby spoke gently and seriously. She was of a romantic  nature and dearly loved a love-affair, often imagining some that did not exist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; Doris went on, &ldquo;he must be a terribly  outdoorsy man. I couldn&rsquo;t live with a man who didn&rsquo;t love every kind of sport  and who wasn&rsquo;t a fine athlete. Could you, Abby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Why, I don&rsquo;t know. I think I&rsquo;d care more for a fine  mind than a fine physique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I mean both. Of course the &lsquo;Lord of my life, my King,  my Star!&rsquo; must be the smartest, wisest, best, handsomest and strongest man in  the whole world! Ta, ta, tya-tya, ta! Will you dance at my wedding, Abby  Rackham? It won&rsquo;t be for many a long year yet, but when it does be, it&rsquo;ll be  right here in this room!&rdquo; and Doris grabbed Miss Rackham round the waist and  waltzed her into the old library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the big front room?&rdquo; said the guest, in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life, my friend. No; little Doris will stand  under the mistletoe,&mdash;I mean under the bower of orange blossoms in this, my  favourite room of all the house, this old library. Though I suppose it was the  parlour then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Washington was here. In this room, they say, he made  his plans, met his aides and the French officers, and thought up that wonderful  scheme of scooting down to Yorktown, when the British thought he was kiting  toward New York City. Oh, the dear, clever, grand old chap! How I do adore  him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Genius! He was a super-hyper-geniusissimo! He was&mdash;he was  Washington! And he sat right here,&mdash;no, here,&rdquo; Doris darted from one side of the  room to the other,&mdash;&ldquo;and Rochambeau stood there, and the soldiers were festooned  all about, and oh, it was glorious! Ta-ta, tya-tya&mdash;ta-ta!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sound like a regular fife and drum corps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for your appreciation! That&rsquo;s just what I meant to  sound like! For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Abby, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris pointed to a sheet of paper that lay on the floor  near the hall door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something that you knocked off the mantel or bookshelf as  you flew round the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much it isn&rsquo;t! Look at it, it&rsquo;s old and yellow with  age. Look at the writing on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abby stooped to pick up the page, but Doris reached over  ahead of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abby drew back, and almost reverently, Doris picked up  what was evidently an old bit of paper,&mdash; a page, it seemed, from a written  book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is old,&rdquo; said Doris, &ldquo;where did it come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it,&rdquo; advised the practical Abby. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a  diary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is; It&rsquo;s a leaf from somebody&rsquo;s old diary. Look,  Abby, it&rsquo;s just legible and that&rsquo;s all. Wherever did it come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, there&rsquo;s the word Abel! It must be his diary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he wouldn&rsquo;t write about himself by name. But it&rsquo;s  somebody who lived here when he did. So it isn&rsquo;t so terribly old. Oh, it says, &lsquo;I  am happy in my new home. Abel is very kind to me,&rsquo; then there&rsquo;s a lot so  blurred I can&rsquo;t read it. Then it says, &lsquo;Today we went to New York and bought a  Rogers Group.&rsquo; What&rsquo;s that, Abby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! are you too young to know? Why, a sort of grey  statuary they used to have years ago. Doris, this is a leaf out of Rachel  Hilton&rsquo;s diary! How did it get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure. I&rsquo;ve never seen such a thing  anywhere round the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it couldn&rsquo;t get here of itself, you know. Is Molly  about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, gone to bed long ago. It&rsquo;s quite late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you care where this paper came from? Haven&rsquo;t  you any fear of what it means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Abby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abby Rackham said nothing, but her gaunt frame trembled  and her pale blue eyes stared in a vacant fashion.</p>
<p>Her manner startled Doris, who exclaimed, &ldquo;What do you  mean, Abby? tell me! Oh, do you mean that it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s supernatural?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else can it be? You know, Doris, that paper wasn&rsquo;t  in this room when we came in here a moment ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I waltzed you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it wasn&rsquo;t on the floor there, then, or we&rsquo;d have  seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said I whirled it off the table or bookshelf as I  flew around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it on any table or bookshelf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it couldn&rsquo;t have been. Unless,&mdash;Abby,&mdash; unless Molly or  somebody found it, in the attic, you know, and thought I&rsquo;d be interested&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris Ballard, you&rsquo;re making up. You know perfectly well  if one of your servants found such a thing it would be brought straight to you,  and not laid on a table or shelf! Wouldn&rsquo;t it, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly would, Abby. But, all the same, I don&rsquo;t  believe a ghost laid it there on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do. It&rsquo;s all because you tore down that bay  window! Oh, Doris!&rdquo; and to Doris&rsquo; great amazement, Miss Rackham burst into  hysterical tears. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter &nbsp;11<br>
  Doris&rsquo; New Mystery</b></h2>
<p>No, Miss Doris,&rdquo; said Solemn Molly, when questioned next  morning, &ldquo;I never saw that paper before. What is it? It looks old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so very old. It&rsquo;s a leaf from Rachel Hilton&rsquo;s  diary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land save us! Where&rsquo;d you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris told her, and Molly dropped limply into a chair, her  face white and her lips quivering. Abby Rackham, who was present, watched her  keenly. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you find it somewhere?&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;and lay it here on the  table or shelf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Rackham, of course I didn&rsquo;t. Where could I find  it? Or where could any one else find it? This house has been not only cleaned  but scraped and polished, and every hole an&rsquo; corner&rsquo;s been dug out an&rsquo;  overhauled, an&rsquo; no piece o&rsquo; paper&rsquo;s big&rsquo;s a pin could &rsquo;ve escaped notice! No,  ma&rsquo;am, that there paper was brought here an&rsquo; dropped here by Rachel Hilton  herself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Molly,&rdquo; cried Doris, &ldquo;how could she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well she could, Miss Doris,&rdquo; and Solemn Molly fixed her  big grey eyes on the girl, &ldquo;she was a&mdash;a spiritualist, you know. An&rsquo; when you  tore down her bay, I was sure she&rsquo;d haunt you! Oh, why did you ever do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly, Molly! Let up on that line of talk, or I&rsquo;ll send  you packing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need to, Miss Doris! Not another night will I  stay in a house with such goin&rsquo;s on! Me an&rsquo; Judd&rsquo;ll get out to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think you will, Molly my larky. Don&rsquo;t mind  her, Abby, she sometimes has these hallucinations of leaving her angel  child,&mdash;that&rsquo;s me,&mdash; but she doesn&rsquo;t get farther than the next room, do you,  Solemncholy Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do this time, Miss Doris. I can stand a lot, but I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> stand it if Rachel Hilton is comin&rsquo;  back here in the sperrit, that I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Molly, she wouldn&rsquo;t be half as dangerous in the  spirit as in the flesh! But you run away now, while I talk this over with Miss  Rackham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All your talkin&rsquo; can&rsquo;t lay that ghost. If Rachel&rsquo;s  hauntin&rsquo; on account o&rsquo; that there bay, she&rsquo;ll haunt till it&rsquo;s put back in  place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll haunt till the crack of doom! Go away, Molly,  and don&rsquo;t let me hear any more of that foolish talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to-day, Doris,&rdquo; declared Miss Rackham, as Molly  left the room. &ldquo;If you felt afraid, I&rsquo;d stay with you, but you don&rsquo;t, you  say,&mdash;and&mdash;I do. I&rsquo;m naturally nervous, and anything supernatural gets me in such  a state, I &rsquo;most go crazy! So I&rsquo;ll be going to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris looked at her. &ldquo;You see, Abby,&rdquo; she said slowly,  &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been brought up to these notions. I suppose New England people are full  of superstition. But out West, we never did a thing but laugh at it. So I can&rsquo;t  take it seriously, as you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; then, where did that paper come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say where it <i>might</i> have come from. As Molly said, the house has been cleaned out spick and span.  It couldn&rsquo;t have been around all the time. It appeared suddenly, after you and  I came into this room last night. When we came in it wasn&rsquo;t there, and in two  minutes it <i>was</i> there,&mdash;on the floor in  plain sight. Now, where <i>could</i> it have  come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; repeated Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t, because there is but one answer. It  was put there by some superhuman agency. You know it, Doris, but you won&rsquo;t  admit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I certainly shan&rsquo;t admit it, for I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you don&rsquo;t, for it makes me easier in my mind to  leave you here alone. You&rsquo;re a brave little piece, and you&rsquo;re well protected  and cared for by those old Judds,&mdash;if they stay by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they will. Don&rsquo;t believe a word of Molly&rsquo;s talk about  leaving me. She adores me, and so does Judd. They&rsquo;re all right. But, Abby, I&rsquo;d  like to have you stay longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to. Sometime, if you get clear of Rachel  Hilton&rsquo;s haunt, I&rsquo;ll come and see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Rackman kept her word and departed that very day.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Miss Luella Cutler came over to call, and  Doris told her the whole story.</p>
<p>The little old maid smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Miss Abby Rackham tricked you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; and Doris looked amazed; &ldquo;I never thought of  that. Of course, Abby could have had that old paper, and put it there on the  floor to fool me&mdash;but, I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know her well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, only very slightly. But I like her, and she  seemed most sincere and trustworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear child, I can&rsquo;t help thinking she knows more  about that old paper than she told you. I fancy Rachel Hilton won&rsquo;t leave any  more pages around on the floor, now Miss Rackham has gone. If she does, you  tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Miss Luella, and while I&rsquo;m hunting your pearls, I  may find some other hidden treasures,&mdash; perhaps some of Rachel&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard of anything hidden in this house except  the pearls. But I do believe they&rsquo;re still within these old walls. Did you find  any secret cubbies or hidy-holes when you renovated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One or two, but they were most carefully cleaned out, and  we found no papers of importance. But now, except for some delinquent workmen,  the house is about done, and I&rsquo;m going to set to to find the pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your plan of campaign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t quite decided yet, but I&rsquo;ve a dim notion of  sounding the walls, and poking around in the cellar. I can&rsquo;t get rid of a  feeling that the jug or pitcher that holds the secret is buried. And another  thing. The pearls couldn&rsquo;t have been put in a pitcher and a piece of silver  plate both. One of those things holds some relation to the other, and if I find  either it will be a big help. And I must find one or the other. If the soldier  had only had breath enough to say what sort of a piece of plate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he did. The comrade who brought the message may  not have repeated it <i>verbatim</i>. And by  the way, my dear, you may have an assistant in your search, if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, Miss Luella?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nephew, Looly. He is coming to Mrs. Busby&rsquo;s for a  vacation and rest, and he&rsquo;ll be glad to help and advise you. He&rsquo;s always been  keen to search this house, but Mr. Hilton never encouraged intruders, though he  was willing Looly should hunt around. But he wasn&rsquo;t cordial or encouraging, and  so Looly didn&rsquo;t do much. And of course, from a common sense point of view the  matter is hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. What&rsquo;s your nephew like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just an every-day young man. Good-looking chap,  college education, splendid mind and lovely disposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds attractive. I shall be glad to meet him. Does he  know all our young people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s never been here before. But as I&rsquo;m here at Mrs.  Busby&rsquo;s, and he wants a quiet place to stay a few weeks, he&rsquo;s coming to be with  me. He&rsquo;s great chums with his old aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris pondered over Miss Cutler&rsquo;s theory that Abby Rackham  had deliberately played a trick on her. It didn&rsquo;t seem at all like the  matter-of-fact and unimaginative Abby, but it was the only solution Doris could  think of. Several times she was on the point of telling Mr. Stanchley all about  it, but refrained, lest he laugh at her. Nor had she told him about her  experience the night the candle went out. But she thought over it all, long and  deeply.</p>
<p>She told Molly what Miss Luella had said, but that grim  personage only sniffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not she! Why, Miss Doris, Abby Rackham ain&rsquo;t that sort.  If you&rsquo;d put up a joke on her now, I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; believed it, but her on you! Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molly staid on, as Doris knew she would. In fact, Molly  and Judd had come to love Doris dearly, and nothing would have made them desert  the girl. Her winning personality, her breezy good nature, and her sound sense  and judgment made her a most satisfactory chatelaine, and the servants all  adored her. Her word was law, and though Molly was housekeeper, Doris had a  general supervision over everything. The chauffeur had proved adaptable, and  Judd had patched up their feud. And the women servants accepted Molly&rsquo;s  superiority, and obeyed her, and all because the wise little head of Doris  Ballard happened to be set squarely upon her shoulders.</p>
<p>But that same little head was mystified. In a way, Doris  courted mystification, for she loved the old legends and traditions, and  enjoyed reading of the &ldquo;haunts&rdquo; and &ldquo;ghosts&rdquo; storied by Washington Irving and  other writers about Colonial or Revolutionary times. But these mysterious  happenings in her own house were another matter.</p>
<p>She sat alone one evening in the George Washington room,  thinking it over. Two rooms she devoted to the memory of Washington, the  bedroom he had used, and the library on the first floor, where she pictured him  as busily and anxiously consulting his maps and charts, planning his campaigns  and making specifications.</p>
<p>In the library she sat, beneath the light of a green  shaded electrolier, and pored over &ldquo;The True George Washington,&rdquo; one of her  favourites among the &ldquo;Lives&rdquo; of her hero. She left off reading to gaze at the  spot on the floor where the mysterious paper had lain when she and Abby first  saw it. The place was in a corner formed by the hall door and the door into the  living-room. Both doors were shut, and Doris stared a moment at the floor and  then returned to her reading.</p>
<p>A moment later she looked up again, as she turned a page,  and there on the floor in the corner she saw a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Her heart seemed to stop beating as she looked. A moment  before there had been nothing there: Now, there was a paper! With the door  closed, no one could have come in from the hall, nor could the paper have been  tossed in from there. The living-room door, too, was tight shut, hence there  was positively no way that the paper could have been put where she saw it by  any human agency.</p>
<p>Doris tried to rise, but her muscles refused to obey her  will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared stiff,&rdquo; she said, to herself, &ldquo;I most  certainly am! I don&rsquo;t want to scream, but I will, if I can&rsquo;t get up and go and  get that paper! Where <i>did</i> it come  from? It&rsquo;s just in the same place the other was! Now, there&rsquo;s one thing  certain, Abby Rackham has nothing to do with this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to think it was some paper of her own, that she  had lost, but she couldn&rsquo;t fool herself to that extent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see it!&rdquo; she whispered, half aloud, and with a  desperate effort she rose, and then stood, clinging to her chair back for  support.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300401h-images/page158.jpg" alt="page158" width="594" height="750"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;I know how silly I am,&rdquo; she mused, scowling at her own  hesitation, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t seem to get over there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She forced herself to cross the room, and with trembling  fingers picked up the paper. It was old and age-yellowed, and her first glance  showed the name of Rachel Hilton!</p>
<p>She dropped the paper without reading it, and then in a  spasm of fear rushed from the room by another door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Miss Doris?&rdquo; asked Molly, looking up from her  sewing.</p>
<p>The casual voice and the comfort of human companionship  restored Doris&rsquo; poise, and she managed to say, &ldquo;Oh, nothing, Molly-Polly. Only  I&rsquo;m looking for my Japanese bag. Oh, here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catching up the bag, which she had just happened to see,  Doris returned to the library, feeling more ready for her task of  investigation. She knew if she told Molly, there would be a scene indeed! So  she wisely kept her own counsel.</p>
<p>The paper was just where she had dropped it, and as she  gingerly took it up again, she saw it was a bill. A bill for household  supplies, made out to Rachel Hilton. A simple enough list, enumerating tea,  coffee, and such things, but to Doris it seemed a message from the unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sense in it!&rdquo; she told herself over and over.  &ldquo;No sense at all. There&rsquo;s no such thing as haunting, but if Rachel did mean to  revenge that bay window performance, she wouldn&rsquo;t throw her old bills and  diaries at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This logic helped little, though, for the mystery  remained. Doris had heard strange sounds that night she sat alone in the bay  window room. The appearance of these two papers was absolutely unexplainable by  natural causes. And the weird extinction of the candle flame beside! Surely,  unless some explanation could be reached, these were as near an approach to the  supernatural as could be well imagined.</p>
<p>Doris scrutinised the paper. It was so old and yellowed as  to preclude all possibility of its being a forgery. The creases where it had  been folded were brown and broken, but it was not folded at all when it was laid  on the floor. It had been flat, and blank side up. Doris went over and over the  items. The prices of commodities had not been very different then from those of  the present day. But it was clear that the items of the bill or the facts  recorded on the page of the diary had no direct message for Doris. She told  herself this, but the vague notion persisted, that Rachel Hilton was merely  disclosing her presence in the old house and her ability to produce  mysteriously these proofs of her presence.</p>
<p>Slowly Doris went up to her bedroom. For the first time,  she felt her loneliness, not so much need of companionship, as of advice and  sympathy. She wanted some one whose judgment she could rely on; not the  emotional and easily frightened Molly, but a wise and experienced counsellor.</p>
<p>She thought of Abby Rackham, who had offered to come if  wanted. But she would be a broken reed in such a case as this, for though  practical in most matters she was quite ready to believe in the supernatural,  and Doris was not. There was Miss Luella Cutler, but Doris felt disinclined to  trouble the elderly lady. Mrs. Busby was kind-hearted, but she was a busy woman  and ought not to have her time intruded on by a lonesome child-neighbour.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marshall would gladly come to live with her, but that,  Doris decided, would be worse than the trouble she was now in.</p>
<p>She sat down for a few moments in Washington&rsquo;s bedroom and  looked out of the open window. As she looked down among the trees, the branches  waving softly and eerily, she fancied she could see vague strange forms moving  slowly about.</p>
<p>But these didn&rsquo;t frighten her in the least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine those,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;and I know it. I  like to imagine them. But this Rachel business is a different matter. I can&rsquo;t  imagine those two papers getting in that room without some motive power! I didn&rsquo;t  imagine those sounds and words I heard that other night, and it certainly wasn&rsquo;t  imagination when my candle went out, being less than half used up! I wish Molly  hadn&rsquo;t thrown that away. I&rsquo;d like to examine it. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter. It was  one of our regular candles, and it was long enough to burn for hours. And it  went out of itself, which a candle can&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though unable to get any clue to the mysteries, the quiet  hour by the well-loved window soothed and calmed her and Doris went to bed and  slept peacefully.</p>
<p>The next day she sent for Mr. Stanchley and told him the  whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Doris, my dear child, you&rsquo;ve  gone daffy over these things. Now, give them a rest, and run around more with the  young people. These old-time matters get on your nerves, and make you see  things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Stanchy,&rdquo; and Doris fixed him with her earnest gaze,  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t admit it&rsquo;s rubbish, until you tell me what it is. Do you deny the  existence of these two old papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, as I hold them in my hand. But they are  merely old papers, such as we found in quantities in the attics. These are a  few old ones that were scattered about and were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, were where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, perhaps in a book, and somebody took the book from  the shelf and the paper fluttered to the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All very well, if we had come in and found it there! But  that paper was laid on the floor while Abby and I were in the room and not  handling the books. And the other one was laid there while I sat there alone. I  looked at the very spot on the floor where we found the first one and there was  nothing there. Then, in less than two minutes I looked again, and there it was!  I hadn&rsquo;t touched a book, except the one I was reading, and that was a brand-new  one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s the exact explanation, Doris, but it  must have been something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Stanchy, it couldn&rsquo;t! It just sim-pul-ly could not!  Also, my bright young friend, do you mean to say that I blew out my own  candle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw, that was the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there wasn&rsquo;t any wind. And it wasn&rsquo;t blown out. It  just flickered, flared up, and died out just as a candle does, that is all  burnt down to its last gasp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, Doris. Put it out of your mind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t very pleasant to live in a house all full  of ghosts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you liked them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, to read about, and hear stories about. But not to  have them come and take up bed and board in my house without an invitation!  They&rsquo;re worse than my intrusive visitors in the flesh! By the way, I&rsquo;ve had a  letter from Madame Marshall and she wants to know if the house is settled  enough for her to make another little visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Doris child! You are bothered to death with these  people! Tell her you can&rsquo;t have her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do want to do that, but she&rsquo;s so persistent, she&rsquo;ll  come anyway. Oh, I know the Marshall invader! I&rsquo;ve a notion to ask Miss Luella  Cutler to visit me, and then tell Mrs. Marshall I already have a guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine idea! Do that. Miss Cutler likes you a lot. But her  beloved nephew is expected and she won&rsquo;t want to leave him. You can&rsquo;t very well  entertain a young man too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I s&rsquo;pose not. And beside, I dislike intensely that  nephew of hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but any young man called Looly must be the limit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The limit of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all that&rsquo;s sappy, silly and soft! he&rsquo;s a vanilla  Willy,&mdash;I know he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not familiar with the species, but I can guess what  you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you Sherlock! As if a Looly could be anything but a  buttered muffin sort of a man. Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, never saw him. None of Mrs. Busby&rsquo;s flock knows him.  But they&rsquo;ve heard his praises sung by Miss Cutler till they&rsquo;re ready to welcome  him with open arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Luella is a darling, and I adore her. But she&rsquo;s just  the sort to think her nephew a piece of perfection whatever he is. But don&rsquo;t  expect <i>me</i> to sidle up to any piece of perfection who allows himself to be  titled by that marshmallow of a name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if Guy Prentiss allows you to sidle very far away  from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! I sidle where the fancy takes me. Guy Prentiss is a  ducky-daddles, and I like him quite a heap,&mdash;but I sidle where I list, for all  that, Mr. Guardian Stanchley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, little wilful girl, but don&rsquo;t sidle off into  realms other than those occupied by rational, material people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter &nbsp;12<br>
  Doris And Len Hawkins</b></h2>
<p>Keep off the flowers, Peter, you Headstrong! Dutchman, if  you fly into that phlox again I&rsquo;ll have you tied up! You know better! The idea  of great big nice well brought up dogs like you two, rampoosing all over my  poseybeds. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,&mdash;your great big naughty bad  selves! Yes,&mdash;ash-a-a-a-med!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scathing reproof in Doris&rsquo; tone brought the heedless  dogs to their senses, and they intelligently backed off from the trampled and  broken stalks of blossoms for which they were entirely responsible.</p>
<p>Penitent they were indeed, but the mischief was done, and  Doris sadly lifted the bruised phlox and stocks, and sent reproachful glances  at the remorseful culprits.</p>
<p>In a morning frock of pink linen and a sunbonnet of  flowered organdy, the mistress of Collander nursed her wounded flower-darlings,  and sang patriotically as she worked.</p>
<p>She hummed past the watched ramparts, but on the high  notes of the rockets&rsquo; red glare, her voice sounded out full and gave Molly, who  was hunting for her, an idea where to find her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Doris,&rdquo; cried the solemn one, coming up to her with  a stern, set face, &ldquo;Miss Doris, Len Hawkins is here an&rsquo; wants to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Len Hawkins? Dunno him. Is he captivating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss Doris, listen, do. He&rsquo;s one of the heirs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Molly, Molly, am I forever to be pestered with these  everlasting heirs, who are not heirs! Tell him I&rsquo;ve gone to the war, tell him I&rsquo;ve  got smallpox, tell him I&rsquo;ve lost my mind and am apt to be violent, tell him  anything but keep him away from me. Do, please, dear little buttercup Molly,  won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Miss Doris. He wants to see you special. He&rsquo;s  not for visitin&rsquo; here, of course. He&rsquo;s on business, he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve no business with Mr. What&rsquo;s-his-name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hawkins, Leonard Hawkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrid name, if you ask me. No poetry in Hawkins at all,  and very little in Leonard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Miss Doris, do see him. I can&rsquo;t get rid of him,  lessen you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if we must, we&rsquo;ll have to, I suppose. Come  along, dogsy-wogsies, help me through a trying scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Restored to her smiling favour, the dogs bounded to her  side, and the three came, racing, to the side porch, where the visitor sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hawkins?&rdquo; said Doris, with cool politeness, and as he  smiled and admitted his identity, she added, &ldquo;Come round to the front verandah,  please.&rdquo; For it was Doris&rsquo; rule never to receive strangers, or indeed any but  her favourite friends on the old side porch, hallowed as it was by her revered  memories.</p>
<p>So to the front they went, and it was clearly to be seen  that Mr. Hawkins was a bit surprised at the appearance and demeanour of his  hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit there, please,&rdquo; Doris directed, as she seated herself  opposite. &ldquo;Be still, Dutch. Lie quietly or go away at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Boston Bull lay down obediently, but kept an alert eye  on the guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your dogs mind well,&rdquo; Mr. Hawkins observed,  conversationally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; returned Doris. &ldquo;And what did you want to see  me about, Mr. Hawkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had not meant to be quite so curt, but the looks and  manner of the man did not please her. She felt his visit uncalled for, and  unless he had a definite and plausible errand, she proposed to make his stay a  short one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve fixed up quite considerable, I see,&rdquo; he said,  looking about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve tried to restore the house as it was  originally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Succeeded mighty well, too. Got money enough to keep it  up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; replied Doris, after combating a strong  desire to tell him what she thought of that question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;re lucky! I may say you&rsquo;re very lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may, if you wish,&rdquo; and the brown eyes looked straight  at him, without a glimmer of gaiety.</p>
<p>Hawkins shifted about a little uncomfortably. He had heard  of this girl of seventeen but he had not expected to find her possessed of  quite so much poise and self-reliance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;re wondering what I came for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t going to ask me to dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. Is there any reason why I should?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Common politeness, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My politeness is of the uncommon sort. Now, Mr. Hawkins,  please state your errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you&rsquo;re so short about it,&mdash;why, I came here  to buy this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris&rsquo; calm was jarred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she cried, sharply, &ldquo;to <i>buy</i> this house? <i>this</i> house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m prepared to offer a good price. Even more than I  thought to, now I see how you&rsquo;ve fixed it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hawkins, you&mdash;you must be crazy. Why this house isn&rsquo;t  for sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If people only bought houses what was for sale, there&rsquo;d  be a heap less deals made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that. Well, you&rsquo;re going to make one  less deal than you expect, right now, for I&rsquo;m not going to sell this house to  you or to anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, look-a-here, Doris,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Ballard, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hawkins chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it Miss Ballard, Dutchman?&rdquo; and Doris put the  question to the ever-ready Bull pup.</p>
<p>A certain bristling of the dog&rsquo;s anatomy seemed to settle  the matter, and Hawkins proceeded, with a shade more of deference in his  manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Miss Ballard,&rdquo; he permitted himself a sarcastic  tone,&mdash;&ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t no person to be at the head of a big place like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; The glance that Doris swept over him must have  given him a sudden hint of his own incongruity, for he grew more red-faced even  than he had been, and blustered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, the way I mean to run it. Now, be reasonable.  We don&rsquo;t want to cheat you, we&rsquo;re ready to pay a fair price,&mdash;a big price,&mdash;but  we want the proppity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, me and two or three other people. Sort of a  syndicate arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hawkins,&rdquo; she said, in cool, even tones, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,  but I really haven&rsquo;t the least interest in the plans of your syndicate  arrangement. May I ask you to seek a more attentive audience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her air of amused intolerance and her little smile of  disapproval infuriated the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look-a-here,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t try to buck up  against me! Why, you chit, I&rsquo;m accustomed to havin&rsquo; my own way,&mdash;I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris giggled. &ldquo;How do you get it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;By  intimidating people who chance to be smaller than you are? I&rsquo;m not afraid of  you, you know, for my Flying Dutchman is all ready to argue on my side, but I  trust it won&rsquo;t come to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you bet it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Leonard Hawkins looked  appraisingly at the sublime self-confidence in the dog&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a peaceable  man, I am, and I just want to make a dicker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dicker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for this proppity. Nobody ever bought or sold Real  Estate without a dicker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no buying or selling of real estate going on  on these premises&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you listen to reason. You&rsquo;d be a heap better off in  some nice modern little house, say, a bungalow, or a stucco cottage. It ain&rsquo;t  just right for a young girl to run a place like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind my part of it; what do <i>you</i> want of the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you. I&rsquo;m spokesman for a few of us relatives of  Abel Hilton; and we&rsquo;ve made a little combine to acquire this house and make it  into a first-class roadhouse. You see, with the monument and all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s glance, sweeping the front lawn, the road and  the whizzing motors, swung back to Doris, and his jaw dropped in sheer shock at  her appearance.</p>
<p>Her little hands were helplessly clenched at her sides;  her body was tense in a very paralysis of rage; but her quickly tossed-up head  flung back the frills of the flowered sunbonnet and the fire that flashed from  her brown eyes was the same light that shone in the eyes of Molly Pitcher at  Monmouth, when she sprang to her dead husband&rsquo;s gun and struck the linstock  home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; she forced from her contracted throat, and then  two big tears formed in the brown eyes and rolled down the soft, round cheeks.</p>
<p>Hawkins stood staring, the Flying Dutchman alertly awaited  developments, but Doris gave herself a little shake, bit her lip and recovered  her poise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can <i>understand</i> making me indignant,&mdash; angry,&mdash;furious,&mdash;&rdquo; she said, looking at him  contemptuously, &ldquo;but of course you can&rsquo;t understand how you <i>hurt</i> me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt you, miss? Now I don&rsquo;t want to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! You don&rsquo;t even know what I mean! You&rsquo;ve no idea of  the sacrilege you hinted at. Now, I really must ask you to go away, Mr.  Hawkins. If you wish to repeat your proposition of buying this place, go to Mr.  Stanchley, the lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, has he the privilege of selling it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Doris even smiled at the man&rsquo;s eagerness, &ldquo;but he  has the privilege of telling you it is not for sale, so that you will believe  it,&mdash;which seems to be more than I can accomplish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, say, just listen a minute. I&rsquo;m sorry if I offended  you; I s&rsquo;pose you do feel attached to it, now you&rsquo;ve fixed it up so, but I&rsquo;m  prepared to offer you a big,&mdash;really big price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you said before. But an offer of a million dollars  wouldn&rsquo;t tempt me in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little simpleton! You don&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. But please do not call me names. I&rsquo;m not  accustomed to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t callin&rsquo; names, that&rsquo;s the plain truth. You are  a simpleton, if you refuse to sell a thing for twice what it&rsquo;s worth. We ain&rsquo;t  talkin&rsquo; in millions, exactly, but we are talkin&rsquo; big money, and I rather reckon  you&rsquo;ll come round. I&rsquo;ll go see your lawyer fellow, and I think he&rsquo;ll have some  sense, if you haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Mr. Hawkins. But Mr. Stanchley will tell you,  just as I have, that the place is not in the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to get it. By hook or by crook,  I&rsquo;ll manage it somehow. You think you&rsquo;re pretty smart, and you are, for a young  &rsquo;un; but I&rsquo;m nobody&rsquo;s fool, myself, and, as I told you, I always get my own  way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In-deed! And you say you&rsquo;re going to do it by hook or  crook? I&rsquo;m not sure I quite understand, but doesn&rsquo;t that mean by dishonest or  underhanded means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe and mebbe not. Anyway, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to <i>get</i> it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gobble-uns&rsquo;ll get <i>you</i> if you don&rsquo;t watch out!&rdquo; Doris said this with no thought other than a flippant  whim, but Hawkins turned pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;those&mdash;you know&mdash;spooks. Have <i>you</i> seen &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I haven&rsquo;t. But,&rdquo; a thought striking her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  quite sure there are some about. Are you afraid of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, no,&rdquo; but the man glanced uneasily over his  shoulder, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you lived in this house, you&rsquo;d have to,&rdquo; and Doris turned large solemn eyes full upon him. &ldquo;They appear  to sceptics and haunt them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to live here! I wouldn&rsquo;t live in a  haunted house for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a haunted house!&rdquo; Doris flared up indignantly.  &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say it was that. A ghost, now and then, doesn&rsquo;t make a haunted  house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they come now and then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re said to,&rdquo; and Doris felt a secret delight in  seeing the man shudder. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an annual one due soon now. He comes every  August.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord save us! What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know about him? He&rsquo;s a French soldier. I&rsquo;m  expecting him &rsquo;most any time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you <i>do</i> talk! You give me the creeps! And you so ca&rsquo;m. Well, I don&rsquo;t like ghosts, I  admit, but a ha&rsquo;nt&rsquo;ll give interest to the old place as a roadhouse. People&rsquo;ll  just flock here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the tears sprang to Doris&rsquo; eyes. But she only said,  &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Hawkins. You can find Mr. Stanchley at his office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her glance was of such definite finality that he went at  once,&mdash;moving awkwardly off the piazza steps. He was routed by this strange  girl, he scarce believed in his own defeat, but he couldn&rsquo;t stay another minute  under the lashing contempt of her look and manner.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your fat friend?&rdquo; and Guy Prentiss came alongside  the verandah rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Guy! I&rsquo;m all in! I don&rsquo;t know whether to break down  and cry or brace up and forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, those two unshed tears you&rsquo;re balancing on your  lower lashes <i>are</i> mighty fetching, but  I don&rsquo;t want you to produce any more for my benefit. What&rsquo;s the tabloid drama  all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come around on the side porch, and I&rsquo;ll tell you about  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went around, and Doris sat down slowly among the  green striped cushions of the porch swing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That highly-coloured and lowly-bred individual,&rdquo; she  began, as Guy flung out a cushion and made room for himself beside her, &ldquo;has  concluded to buy this place and turn it into a roadhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Prentiss gave her a glance. Her voice quivered, and  he saw that a word of sympathy might precipitate a flood of tears.</p>
<p>So, tactfully he made light of it, and said, in a casual  tone, &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s needlessly set foot upon the worm. Consider him kicked  out of our path. How about a round of golf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m too upset. That awful, horrid, dreadful man got  on my nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know you had any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I, ever before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, take off that dinky sunbonnet thing until you get  over your nerves, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, when you&rsquo;re nervy,&mdash;nervous, I mean, you  pout,&mdash;and that sunbonnet with a pout in it, is more than I can stand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pout turned to a dimpled smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better. Alluring enough, but not so desperately  compelling. I say, Doris, I&rsquo;m going to camp next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? Oh, Guy, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, I&rsquo;m awfully sorry to have you go, but, all  the same I <i>want</i> you to go. I want  everybody to go,&mdash;I &rsquo;most wish I were a man and could go myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. If you&rsquo;re not careful, some day that  patriotism of yours&rsquo;ll go off, and you&rsquo;ll fly into a million pieces, all at  once, like the one-hoss-shay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your comparisons are so apt! The one-hoss-shay didn&rsquo;t  explode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be fussy! If you go to pieces all at once, it doesn&rsquo;t  matter whether you explode or not. Anyway, it went &lsquo;just as bubbles do when  they burst,&rsquo; and if that isn&rsquo;t exploding, I don&rsquo;t know what is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stormed at with shot and shell, boldly they rode and  well,&rsquo;&mdash;oh, Guy, won&rsquo;t you be in the cavalry? You&rsquo;re stunning on a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! that&rsquo;s <i>your</i> patriotism! If a chap registers some riding togs and a bucking broncho, you  think he&rsquo;s a howling hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diddums gettum maddums? Why, bless his heart, it&rsquo;s only &rsquo;cause  him looks so booful in hims riding silhouette, that&mdash;honest to goodness, Guy, I&rsquo;m  glad you&rsquo;re going. You&rsquo;ll make a splendid soldier, you&rsquo;re so&mdash;so soldiery! I s&rsquo;pect  your ancestors were Zenobia and&mdash;Sir Galahad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Doris! What nice things you do say! If I make good,  it&rsquo;ll be to live up to your ideals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you want to go, don&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re glad you&rsquo;re going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am that! Except for one reason. One little reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Bout as big as me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Heaps littler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t a girl, it&rsquo;s a little, <i>little</i> reason. It&rsquo;s that tiniest red curl at the back of your  neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one?&rdquo; and Doris fingered a tendril.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mercy, no! Not <i>that</i> one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. Here, I&rsquo;ll show you. <i>This</i> one. To be sure, they&rsquo;re <i>all</i> &lsquo;round locks of gold to trick the heart,&rsquo; but this one is the roundest,  reddest,&mdash;I say, Doris, won&rsquo;t you give&mdash;er&mdash;lend it to me, for the duration of the  war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, let that be the curl you left behind you! I say,  Guy, you&rsquo;re getting sentimental as you get soldiery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re getting clever. A girl with red curli-locks  oughtn&rsquo;t to be clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be. It slipped out unbeknownst. But I  won&rsquo;t have my hair called red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red-gold. Quite different from carrot-top, I do assure  you. And it&rsquo;s only gold in the strong sunlight.&rdquo; He looked at it critically.  &ldquo;Red-brown, is its every-day colour, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is red-brown an every-day colour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only when I see you every day. Which I won&rsquo;t, after I&rsquo;m  camping on the old tent ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll come and visit you, sometimes, Ruth and I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you? And I&rsquo;ll be home on leave, more or less, so  life still holds out hope of sweetness. But, whatever happens, always remember,  &rsquo;is &rsquo;eart was true to Poll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me bein&rsquo; Poll?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bein&rsquo; Poll. But, see here, my lady, I hear that a gay  young blade is imminent at the Busby Palace Hotel. Dost like the picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a&rsquo; the lads they smile at me, but I don&rsquo;t think I can  smile back at a person named Looly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that his home address? Well, well. I fear no foe with &lsquo;Looly&rsquo;  stamped on his cigarettes. Remember I&rsquo;m the main Guy,&mdash;won&rsquo;t you, little Doris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but your only claim to my fleeting interest is that  you&rsquo;re going to war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And coming back to get the little red curl that I mayn&rsquo;t  have to take with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have so many medals and things, you&rsquo;ll forget  curls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case you&rsquo;d better let me take it as a reminder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Doris shook her wise little head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  Doris And Looly</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Angel Doggie Peter,&rdquo; observed Doris, &ldquo;stop shaking your  fedders all over my nice clean frock! For if I bethink me aright, here comes  that Looly person to call on Miss Doris Ballard. And lordyation! the Busby is  bringing him, instead of Miss Luella!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Mrs. Busby profusely explained, a moment later,  as she presented the young man, &ldquo;Miss Cutler has a touch of her rheumatism and  she asked me to bring Looly over for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be sent by Parcel Post, because I&rsquo;m just over  the six foot limit,&rdquo; and Doris looked up to find the laughing blue eyes on a  far higher level than her own.</p>
<p>But the Looly person was well proportioned though  slenderly built, and gave an effect of nerve force rather than physical  strength. His movements were deliberate, his manner a trifle languid, and  though he looked at Doris with interest, his regard was a bit appraising, and  Doris hated to be appraised.</p>
<p>In fact, such an attitude on the part of a stranger always  made her draw a light mantle of formality over her naturally spontaneous  cordiality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>How</i> d&rsquo;y&rsquo;do?&rdquo;  she said with the rising inflection approved by the up-to-date code of the  moment, and young Cutler gave her a quick, amused glance.</p>
<p>He met her on her own ground, however, and responded with  a politeness as indifferent as her own. This, added to the fact that his white  flannel raiment was aggressively immaculate and obtrusively perfect in cut and  mode made Doris promptly positive that she <i>never</i> could <i>abide</i> a man named Looly!</p>
<p>Though not blatantly apparent, this undercurrent of  antagonism was perceptible, and Busybody Busby got busy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you two?&rdquo; she asked, tactfully.  &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t appear to be friendly inclined. Come, now, Doris, speak up pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Cutler&rsquo;s first move,&rdquo; and a sideward glance of  the soft brown eyes showed the smile that was not allowed to curve the scarlet  lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first move is a promise; when I feel that I know you  well enough, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;m thinking about you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know I&rsquo;ll be interested enough to listen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because by that time you&rsquo;ll be interested in anything I  may say&mdash;concerning you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last clause changed Doris&rsquo; look of incredulous hauteur  to appreciative fun, and she returned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But by that time I&rsquo;ll be telling you my first impressions  of your own self, and then&mdash;maybe you&rsquo;ll never speak to me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, I&rsquo;m not such an undesirable citizen as all  that! You can&rsquo;t dislike me at first sight, unless you&rsquo;ve a prejudice, and if  that&rsquo;s the case, tell it me and I&rsquo;ll immediately remove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what it is,&rdquo; put in the Busybody duenna, &ldquo;Doris  thinks it&rsquo;s awful for a man to be named Looly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s awful to have my secrets told!&rdquo; exclaimed  the girl, rosy pink from annoyance. &ldquo;Dear Mrs. Busby, let&rsquo;s change the  subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; agreed Cutler. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait another minute to  see the house. You know, we Cutlers have a spiritual lien on this place, and I  want to see what you&rsquo;ve done to it. So far I see only improvement, but there  may yet be surprises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Doris, rising, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like your opinion on  some matters I&rsquo;ve been waiting to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they went all over the old house. Seeing Molly,  Mrs. Busby staid to talk with her, and Doris and Looly proceeded.</p>
<p>If he had seemed indifferent before, Cutler was interested  enough now. Eagerly he noted every change, carefully he inspected restorations  and improvements, nodding approval here and questioning there, with the sure  touch of knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it jar on you at all,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;the introduction  of electrics, steam heat, telephones, plumbing and all that? Do you think the  push-button shatters the atmosphere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; and Doris spoke seriously. &ldquo;But it  had to be, and there was no use in half-way measures. And, too, remember, we&rsquo;re  living <i>now</i> and the house is living <i>now</i>; so, to my mind, there&rsquo;s no reason  why these old walls and windows and mantels should mind the intrusion of modern  inventions. They in no way detract from the charm and dignity of the original  building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! You see it perfectly clearly. The charm,  the impressiveness of these rooms and halls is immortal. Nothing added in a  true spirit of convenience or utility could mar it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dearness of it all,&rdquo; said Doris, simply. &ldquo;These  rooms in the old part breathe memories of only simple, gentle people. At least,  that is their effect on me. There is no hint of grandeur or ostentation. This  part, you know, was the old farmhouse, the house where Washington staid during  that critical, that important period just before the Siege of Yorktown, the  decisive battle of the Revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; and Cutler&rsquo;s face glowed, &ldquo;the great old  chap! I&rsquo;ve no doubt it was here in this very room, this library, that he  planned that campaign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was. And so, I hold this room sacred to his  memory, and also the room above this, which was his bedroom. And, incidentally,  I revere the dining-room, because he ate there, and the South porch, because he  sat there of an evening to brood over his country&rsquo;s weal and woe. And there was  a lot of woe just then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know he sat out there to brood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I just <i>know</i> it. You don&rsquo;t need Lossing&rsquo;s Field Book of the Revolution to tell you that! Of  course, he sat out on the porch of a summer evening, &mdash;that porch was the front  of the house then,&mdash;and his soldiers were encamped all around here, and they  came to consult and to take orders, and they all <i>adored</i> him! And he sat there, in his beautiful clothes,&mdash;Washington  was like you, rather vain as to clothes,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose he was often as much admired as I am at  present,&rdquo; and Cutler absorbedly flicked a speck of dust from his sleeve.</p>
<p>The brown eyes flashed him a scornful glance and Doris  went on: &ldquo;Well, whether he had on his uniform or his satin togs he looked  perfectly lovely! Maybe his pictures flatter him, but he is always the most  distinguished looking gentleman I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all of that. And his face is that of a thoroughbred.  Oh, I share your infatuation for George! And for this house too. Remember, my  lady, it was an ancestor of mine whose pearls were hidden here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is my house in which those pearls are still  hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that, too? It has always seemed to me they  are still here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they are. The piece of plate was a hidden piece&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or the pitcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was not hidden as a valuable thing, but it may have  been in some obscure place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or hidden because it already contained something of  value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, perhaps. Can&rsquo;t we&mdash;you and I&mdash;make a desperate search  and find the pearls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gladly do my part. I&rsquo;m just loafing round, and  except for entertaining Aunt Lulie a bit, I&rsquo;ve nothing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you named for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, and yet our names are alike. Don&rsquo;t you like  Looly as a strong, manly sort of a name?&rdquo; The blue eyes looked lazily amused,  and Doris retorted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a stunning name! Fancy, if you were to be  knighted. Sir Looly Cutler! Perfectly darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those last two words are the most scathing I have ever  had hurled at me. Some day I shall make you say them with a different  intonation. By the way, aren&rsquo;t we well enough acquainted now to own up to our  first impressions of each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose if we&rsquo;re going to make common cause of this  pearl search, we must be not only acquaintances but friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem so,&rdquo; and Doris nearly gasped in her  amazement that this provoking young man didn&rsquo;t follow up her lead more  definitely. &ldquo;Well, go ahead, what did you size me up as?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then they call women the curious sex! I&rsquo;ve a notion  not to tell you. Anyway, you must tell me first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha! True daughter of Pandora and Paul Pry! Well, when I  first laid eyes upon the fair chatelaine of&mdash;what do you call the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collander, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always been called that, and I like the old name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, too. Well, when I first saw you, there flew into my  mind a line of poetry that seemed to fit you. I shall always think of it when I  think of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I shall mostly be &lsquo;out of sight, out of mind.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another line that goes, &lsquo;I cannot think of thee,  I am too near thee.&rsquo; But I suppose that is not entirely appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly. What is your original line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t original with me. I&rsquo;m &rsquo;most afraid to confess  it, but it is the beginning of a Limerick.</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;There was a young lady whose eyes<br>
  Were unique as to colour and size&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big brown eyes glinted with laughter as Doris looked  at him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as long as you don&rsquo;t finish the verse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I forget the rest. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;When she opened them wide<br>
  Folks all turned aside,<br>
  And scooted away in surprise.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. I&rsquo;m not for scooting just yet. I haven&rsquo;t  heard your indelible first impression of my humble self. Do I understand you&rsquo;ve  sized me up as a tailor&rsquo;s dummy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not so far off,&rdquo; said Doris coolly. &ldquo;All I could  think of when I first saw you was a very bright new pin that ought to be put  with his brother pins in his proper row on the green paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s real nice of you. I&rsquo;m glad I look tidy. Now  let&rsquo;s leave us live people for a time, and talk about immaterial ones. Aunt  Luella told me about the mysterious papers you found,&mdash;may I see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. And, see, here&rsquo;s where they lay. Right in  that corner of the library, between the two doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; and Cutler stepped over to the corner indicated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I can&rsquo;t imagine how they got there with both  doors shut. There was no draught, of course, but even if there had been, where  did the papers blow <i>from?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutler scrutinised the floor, the walls, and then began to  tap on the side of the chimney jamb which was next the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; said Doris. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve pounded that chimney till I &rsquo;most  made it cave in, but no papers appeared from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are both papers that belonged to Rachel Hilton,&rdquo;  mused Cutler, studying the yellowed sheets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly are. I thought the first one might have  been put on the floor there by Miss Rackham, a guest I had at the time I found  it. But the second one appeared after she left. I was in this room entirely  alone, and one minute it was not there and the next minute it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you frightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was, and I wasn&rsquo;t. I felt skittish, of course, but I&rsquo;m  so crazy to find out the truth of the matter that I forget all fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl! That&rsquo;s the right spirit. Now, let&rsquo;s leave the  letters a moment, and consider the pearls. I&rsquo;ll be here a month or so, and I  want to make a systematic search, not the futile desultory hunt that my  ancestors put up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know they did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard about it all my life. Every generation thinks  itself a little bit smarter than the last one, and in every case the result is  the same. Now, I want to start differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Doris, her eyes shining with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by hunting the house, for that&rsquo;s been done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand times, I suppose. And with my tearings out and  pullings down, there&rsquo;s no nook or cranny uninvestigated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my idea. And yet I think the pearls are in the  house. My theory is, that if they had been found, by a rightful owner or by a  dishonest person, that would have been divulged sooner or later. A thing like  that <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> have been kept secret.  Anyway, that&rsquo;s the principle I want to start out with, and see where it gets  us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What to do first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine. Throw yourself back into Le Fevre&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fevered imagination!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be funny. Now, supposing you were here, and had the  pearls to hide, just as he had, where would you put them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the wall somewhere,&rdquo; returned Doris, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, you could find an insignificant place, I mean,  an unobservable place, say, in the cellar, and make a hole and put them in, and  sort of plaster it over, and nobody could ever find it. As the years went on it  would become less and less noticeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; and Cutler thought over it. &ldquo;But what  about the family plate and the willow pitcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, in the first place, those two things rather  contradict each other. If in a silver receptacle, why the china jug? I&rsquo;ve  sometimes wondered whether the willow pattern, so often seen on china, was ever  reproduced in silverware.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because if it had been, collectors would know of it,  and we&rsquo;d see specimens of it, or at least read about it in the collector&rsquo;s  books. No, I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s a wrong tack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutler was attractive when he smiled. His thick, light  brown hair had a little ripple in it, and he tossed it back as an impatient  lion does his mane. His eyes were very blue, and when he thought deeply he  stared with an intent preoccupied gaze that seemed to deepen their colour. His  face was long and lean, with a firm jaw and throat, and thin lips that smiled  back from white and even teeth. He was entirely free from self-consciousness,  and talked to Doris with the careless ease of an old acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; keep the silver and the china separate, please. Now,  take first, the family plate. That&rsquo;s always mentioned first when the tale is  told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But maybe the dying soldier didn&rsquo;t speak it first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you! You have ideas, haven&rsquo;t you? I foresee we  shall get along famously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;if you have ideas too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have, I assure you. Now, as to this family plate. I  can&rsquo;t quite see it in the picture. This house was a farmhouse then, not a  mansion. I doubt if the farmer&rsquo;s people had a great sideboard, crowded with  silver trenchers and tankards, which is the scene family plate suggests to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too. The willow pitcher is far more in keeping with  their probable house-furnishings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I think some other sort of a plate is meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoke of a doorplate to Miss Luella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been; and yet, that doesn&rsquo;t ring quite  true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say a door-bell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, be good kiddy, or we won&rsquo;t get anywhere. How about  the plate being part of the same set as the pitcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A willow plate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where does that get us? He couldn&rsquo;t have hidden  pearls in a willow-pattern <i>plate!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get away from the timeworn idea that his message  told the hiding pace. Assume that it was to lead to a direction in which to  look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if a paper had been dropped in the pitcher, containing  written directions,&mdash;maybe a cryptogram or cipher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. I&rsquo;d love to find a cipher. Bet I could figure it  out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather find the pearls themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would follow, as the night the day. Now, stick to  the text. <i>Could</i> the family plate be a  china plate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, it could not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because a china plate is never spoken of in that way.  Family plate means the collection of family silver&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinarily, yes. But say, these people had no silver to  speak of, and suppose they had a great ancestral platter of willow pattern  china, which they called the family plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtful but possible. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose it had been hidden in a cubbyhole, &mdash;a secret  cupboard or alcove,&mdash;and our French friend had put the pearls in the same hiding  place, or, had put in there with the plate, a paper telling where the pearls  were hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the willow pitcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same theory applies. If they were of the same set, the  best Sunday-go-to-meeting dishes, you know, they may have hidden the whole  layout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, but it doesn&rsquo;t sound&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Convincing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That enough,&mdash;but not interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you want a cipher message or a donjon keep or something  romantic, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something a little more plausible, anyway. Now, here&rsquo;s my  scheme. Don&rsquo;t try to connect the plate and the pitcher. Take one or the other  and work it up alone. Then, if it fails, try the other. The combination seems  to lead nowhere. One alone might lead to something worth while. And, too,  working on one might later include the other, and we could tell better what it  meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start with the pitcher then, because we know what that  means. That is, a willow pitcher is a solid, sensible object. But a family  plate is uncertain as to its very meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree. But, alas, imagine trying to find now a china  pitcher that was in existence in 1781! Why, it&rsquo;s not only in pieces but in  dust. Don&rsquo;t you suppose the early Cutlers investigated every willow pitcher for  miles around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I mean if the pitcher is hidden. Maybe hidden in  this house. As you say, it must have escaped discovery or it would have been  known. Therefore, I argue, it was hidden and is hidden still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll find it. But we can only look in the walls.  For every other bit of the house has been gone over by the masons and painters  and plumbers. If it&rsquo;s &rsquo;way inside of one of the thick walls it may be securely  hidden, but nowhere else. The roof has all been restored, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t there any hidyholes that you know of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a brilliant question! Do you mean some that I know  of,&mdash;but haven&rsquo;t searched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutler laughed. &ldquo;Right, Miss Ballard. It was a fool  speech! But, anyway, here&rsquo;s a point I meant to make. Suppose the willow  plate,&mdash;I mean, willow pitcher, is a sort of cryptogram itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see! And the design holds the key of the hiding  place! Why, then any piece of the willow pattern would do to study! Even a  modern reproduction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on! Don&rsquo;t go too fast. I had in mind that the  soldier boy took a piece of the house-wife&rsquo;s willow china, and added, maybe  with a pencil or brush, a few marks that would tell the secret,&mdash;to one who  understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see, but I like better the theory that any willow  patterned piece would tell the story. Couldn&rsquo;t we gather from the Chinese  picture, the lovers crossing the bridge, you know, and the willow tree, and the  two doves, and the irate father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say the hiding place was under a bridge or in a dovecote&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t impossible. I suppose they may well have had an  old dovecote. And there were bridges all about, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two went into the dining room, and sitting opposite  each other at the long refectory table, they pored over the old willow pattern  on a very new and cheap plate, until they knew every detail by heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me for climbing every willow tree for miles around,&rdquo;  announced Cutler at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunt especially in those that were planted of late  years,&rdquo; said Doris, ironically. &ldquo;I shall look for an old dovecote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are dozens of those about, which have been in use  for centuries, of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I mean the ruins of one. It might be buried almost  out of sight, but still survive the passing years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish! We haven&rsquo;t accomplished a thing. But we have  made a start, and we have something to start from. May I take this plate home  with me, to study over? I doubt if Lady Busby has one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and welcome. When you have a brilliant idea, come  over again and tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you always at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost never. But take a chance, or telephone first and I&rsquo;ll  stay in for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I? You&rsquo;re awfully kind. Aunt Luella will be  delighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And her nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is already delighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Looly had departed with his precious plate, Doris  sat in the porch swing, thinking him over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice boy,&rdquo; she confided in Peter the Head-strong&rsquo;s  feathery ear, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s something about him I hate. It isn&rsquo;t that he wears  the very latest cry in men&rsquo;s clothes,&mdash;though that&rsquo;s part of it. But, I&rsquo;d  forgive that, if he were a little more&mdash;well, active. He looks almost athletic,  but he acted indolent, and never even moved unless he had to. He has no  physical energy, somehow. I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s a live wire,&mdash;I think he&rsquo;s a  mollycoddle. But he&rsquo;s nice to talk to, and quick to catch on, so I think I&rsquo;ll let  him help me with my search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the condescending young woman went for a romp with the  dogs that soon proved her physical energy very much in evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  Doris And The French Soldier</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your mail, Miss Doris,&rdquo; said old Jethro Judd,  coming to the swing on the east end of the side porch, which was Doris&rsquo;  favourite abiding place. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want to be a calamity howler, but I do  say as there&rsquo;s a letter from that earring woman. Always distrust a person what  wears earrings, say I, be he man or woman, but specially be he a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, Judd, what a tirade! I suppose you mean Madame  Marshall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Miss Doris, an&rsquo; I hope the spooks fly away with  her, so I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the spooks of Collander are like the snakes in  Ireland, there aren&rsquo;t any. Here it is the latter part of August and Friend Le  Fevre hasn&rsquo;t clanked around yet! Even Wolfert Acker&rsquo;s ghost hasn&rsquo;t shown up,&mdash;he&rsquo;s  scheduled for midsummer; and Irving tells of another, a young lady who died of  love and green apples,&mdash;she must be a lovely ghost! Judd, do you suppose the  motor-car and such modern contraptions have scared the ghosts away entirely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t make so light of it, Miss Doris.&rdquo; The  old man looked apprehensively up the tree-clouded slope beyond the flower beds.  &ldquo;Mebbe they ain&rsquo;t no ghostses,&mdash;an&rsquo; then again,&mdash;mebbe they is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That speech, Judd, sums up just about all the greatest  investigators of psychic phenomena have discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judd didn&rsquo;t get the drift of this, but he did see that  Doris was laughing at him, and with a grieved glance at her, he walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly, Molly, Solemncholy Molly!&rdquo; called Doris, and the  gloomy-faced one appeared in the dining-room door.</p>
<p>Her sunken grey eyes were rolled up with an air of pious  resignation to any new blow Fate might have in store, and she placed one hand  against a pillar to brace herself, if need be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Marshall arrives this afternoon,&rdquo; announced Doris,  her own vexed expression giving way to amusement at Molly&rsquo;s limp relaxation of  despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said, with enough vehemence to ward off the  impending disaster, could it have been met by such means.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; contradicted Doris. &ldquo;She knows where she&rsquo;s going  and she&rsquo;s on her way! She will gladden this house with her presence for two  days and two nights. I shall repair to Ruth Prentiss&rsquo; and remain there until  the invader departs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort. Listen, Miss  Doris, dear, if you go off and leave that Tartar in petticoats here alone, she&rsquo;ll  play hob with all your things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>do</i> you  mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll go snoopin&rsquo; into everything, and bossin&rsquo; me  and Judd, and raisin&rsquo; Cain, generally. No, you stay right here on deck. You ain&rsquo;t  bigger&rsquo;n a pint of cider, but you&rsquo;ve got a way with you that sorta puts the  kibosh on Madame Earrings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do her earrings trouble you so? Lots of people wear  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like <i>she</i> wears &rsquo;em. She fair dangles &rsquo;em in your face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, of course I&rsquo;ll stay here. I&rsquo;d no intention of  deserting. Now, scoot off and fix up the room over the dining-room for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Since the unwelcome guest planned to stay such a short  time, Doris concluded to be gracious toward her. After all, she was one of the  disappointed twenty-seven, and, as the successful one, Doris felt a certain  sense of <i>noblesse oblige</i>.</p>
<p>So her greeting, when Madame Marshall came, was cordial  and pleasant. She didn&rsquo;t say she was glad to see her, but she asked about her  health and showed graceful little attentions that caused the visitor to look  curiously at her young hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve improved a lot in your manner since I saw you  last,&rdquo; she observed.</p>
<p>Doris was tempted to retort, &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t!&rdquo; but instead,  she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the place, and the influences of the house. Nobody  could be ill-mannered, I think, if they realised all it means to live in a  historic home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sentimental, eh?&rdquo; and Madame shook her long jet earrings  scoffingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Doris said, simply, &ldquo;I have learned here the  meaning of sentiment. There are many sorts, but one of the best is the love and  reverence for the memory of a hero. And when the hero is the greatest ever, and  when his memories are part of your every-day existence, you can&rsquo;t help moulding  your own ideals and ambitions in harmony with his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very pretty, my dear, <i>very</i> pretty. And so Washington&rsquo;s ghost haunts the whole house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Madame Marshall! Please don&rsquo;t say such  things! I know the ghost stories and haunt stories, and I love them too, but  the spirit of Washington that pervades my home is not a ghost, it is an  influence, a protection,&mdash;like a guardian angel or a guiding star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Doris was very much in earnest, her restless hands  grew quiet and her voice dropped to a low, exquisite tone that carried  conviction of her true feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a strange girl,&rdquo; Madame said, after a pause. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ve changed so much after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris&rsquo; laugh rang out. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m the same forward,  obstinate, pig-headed piece, that I was dubbed when I first came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who dubbed you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. A bird of the air carried the matter. But  you were interested, when you were here, in the Rachel Hilton spook. Let me  tell you about the papers she has given me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris told the details of the mysterious appearance of the  two old papers in the library, and Madame Marshall was indeed interested.</p>
<p>She wanted the story told and retold. She wanted to know  Doris&rsquo; opinion and the opinions of all to whom the story had been related.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told several people,&rdquo; Doris said, &ldquo;because I wanted  to get all possible suggestions. Molly and Judd are scared out of their wits,  but they&rsquo;ve promised not to tell the other servants, for I know they&rsquo;d all  leave. But Mr. Stanchley and Miss Cutler laugh at it, and insist there&rsquo;s some  natural explanation. Though I don&rsquo;t see how there can be. Mr. Cutler, Miss  Luella&rsquo;s nephew, is over at the Busby house, and he&rsquo;s terribly interested. But  he&rsquo;s more crazy about hunting those old pearls than in discovering where the  papers came from. He thinks Molly or Judd put &rsquo;em there to fool me. Of course,  I know better than that,&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve no idea what the truth may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this young Cutler? What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice enough. Big and good-looking, but not as, &mdash;well, not  as much given to outdoor sports as I think a man should be. He sits in the  hammock and writes poetry most of the time! Think of that! A big strong man  writing poetry between meals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want him to write it at the dinner table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to write it at all. I want him to get up  and get out and <i>hustle</i> at something  between meals. Why doesn&rsquo;t he enlist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you asked him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indirectly, and he answered indirectly. I think he&rsquo;s a  softy. I call him Vanilla Willy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is your favourite beau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have such things. I have boy friends, and I like  Guy Prentiss as well as any of &rsquo;em. But he&rsquo;s gone to training camp. Dicky  Forbes is nice, but he goes to camp next week, too. Looly Cutler ought to go,  but I think likely they refused to take a man named Looly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t any other name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. &rsquo;Spect he was christened Louis or Lewis, but he  was really named for his spinster aunt, and he&rsquo;s trying to be a nice,  old-lady-like person. She&rsquo;s a dear. Do you know Miss Luella?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; you know Uncle Abel didn&rsquo;t entertain much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know it. I don&rsquo;t either, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to live here this way,&mdash;alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So forty-leven people have told me. And I know it, and  when I get around to it, perhaps next winter, I&rsquo;m going to buy a chaperon and &lsquo;come  out.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, are you? Doris, let me be your chaperon! I&rsquo;d love to.  And I&rsquo;ve had wide experience in society,&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t go too fast. I said, next winter, and maybe I&rsquo;ll  wait another year. Molly is chaperon enough, while I&rsquo;m a flapper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not. You&rsquo;re old enough&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only seventeen, but I&rsquo;m old enough to plan my own  life. I&rsquo;ve two live guardians, and Washington for a guardian spirit. Nothing  can harm me in this house. The very walls love me and protect me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Doris&rsquo; voice fell to that low, mystic note, and the  soft radiance in her brown eyes seemed to glorify the lovely face.</p>
<p>Madame Marshall watched the girl closely, and felt an awe,  as of something beyond her ken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you give me this room?&rdquo; she asked, as Doris  hovered about like a housewifely butterfly. &ldquo;I wanted to sleep in the room  Washington slept in. Isn&rsquo;t that right next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next but one. But you can&rsquo;t have it. I never put guests  there. In fact, I may as well own up I look on it as a sort of shrine. I go  there when I&rsquo;m troubled or anxious, and I sit there and look out of the window  he looked out of, and see the trees and the wistaria vine that he saw, and  always peace fills my soul, and my troubles straighten themselves out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> a funny  little thing! Very well, run away now, about your own affairs. I&rsquo;ll see you at  dinner time.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>For her own bedroom Doris had the great front room over  the living room. This was in the later part of the house, added in 1810, and  the floor level, a few feet higher than the old part, was reached by half a  dozen extra stairs.</p>
<p>Long after she had fallen asleep that night, Doris was  awakened by a hasty footstep on the stairs, and a moment later she heard a  quick tap at her door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she cried, springing out of bed, and opening  the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; breathlessly exclaimed Madame Marshall, who, wrapped  in a voluminous kimono, scurried into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter? Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. But Doris,&rdquo; she leaned close and whispered,  &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a ghost out in the garden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; and Doris burst into laughter. &ldquo;Is <i>that</i> all? Well, I&rsquo;m glad you aren&rsquo;t ill,  or the house on fire or something really serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! <i>Don&rsquo;t</i> laugh,&rdquo; and the elder lady shivered with fear. &ldquo;Come, look out your window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I turn on the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t make a light. Here, throw this round you. Now,  peep through the curtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Marshall led the girl to the window, which  overlooked the flower garden, and with finger on lip, bade her look off toward  the dark mass of trees. The night was very dark, and there was no moon, and but  few stars, and Doris could see nothing but a gloom of trees against a black  sky.</p>
<p>The terror of Madame Marshall seemed to communicate itself  to the girl, and she too shivered with a nameless dread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing,&rdquo; she whispered, but even as she spoke, she  felt her arm clutched warningly, and then a strange luminous mist rose slowly  from the ground at a spot just above the corner of the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See&mdash;see!&rdquo; said the other, and Doris stood spellbound,  while her flesh turned cold, and her teeth chattered.</p>
<p>Scarcely visible at first, the quivering luminous mass  rose taller and seemed the semblance of a man. The outline was so vague as to  be almost indiscernible, but the thing took shape, and moved with slow stalking  steps toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I <i>am</i> afraid,&rdquo; moaned Doris, turning to catch the horrified stare of Madame Marshall&rsquo;s  eyes. &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; whispered the other, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing to do.  Would you rather get back into bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, no! That would be worse. Is it,&mdash;is it the French  soldier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be. See, he is searching for the lost pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phantom moved with a slow, swaying step, and then,  even as they watched, it disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; and Doris gave a hysterical sigh of  relief.</p>
<p>And then, as suddenly, the dimly glowing shape reappeared,  a little nearer to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; breathed Doris, &ldquo;there he is again! and nearer! Oh,  what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything my dear. But d-don&rsquo;t be afraid. He  c-can&rsquo;t harm us&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Marshall&rsquo;s own voice was unsteady, though she tried  to reassure the trembling Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no, of course he can&rsquo;t. There, he&rsquo;s fading again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huddled together, shivering with fright, yet too  fascinated to leave the window, they watched while the strange, eerie thing  drew nearer and nearer the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming in,&rdquo; whispered Madame Marshall, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s coming  in the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Doris, &ldquo;every door&rsquo;s locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter to a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris gave her a wild look. &ldquo;Oh, no! of course not. Help  me, Madame Marshall. What <i>can</i> I do? I  can&rsquo;t <i>stand</i> it if he appears to us  here&mdash;close by&mdash; <i>ooh!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris gave a smothered shriek as the phantom disappeared  beneath the shadow of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must&mdash;I <i>must</i> go and look in the hall!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just wait here in suspense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breaking away from Madame&rsquo;s detaining hand, Doris flew out  into the hall and peered over the banister.</p>
<p>In the hall below, there was only blackness, but as she  stared into the dark, a form took shape and she saw the same vague luminous  thing that had traversed the garden. It stood in front of the tall clock at the  stair foot, and it seemed to Doris that it turned as if to ascend the stairs.</p>
<p>She ran into the Washington bedroom, and only waiting for  Madame Marshall to squeeze in beside her, she locked and bolted the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cannot harm us here,&rdquo; she whispered, but in an agony  of fear she listened breathlessly, her ear against the old wooden panels.</p>
<p>Faintly, but unmistakably, they heard slow ascending  footsteps. Sometimes a clanking noise could be distinguished and again only  that soft, muffled, measured tread. Along the long hall, toward the back of the  house, the steps sounded, and paused at every door, and on each door resounded  three faint hollow-sounding taps.</p>
<p>They could distinguish each room that was visited, and  then the steps returned, drawing nearer and nearer the room they were in.</p>
<p>But the steps passed that door and proceeded to Doris&rsquo; own  room, so recently vacated. Here the three taps were struck,&mdash;slow, faint,  hollow,&mdash;and then down the short stair came the steps again, and paused in front  of the very door against which Doris leaned.</p>
<p>Distinctly, so that she not only heard, but felt them  through the panel, the ghostly taps fell.</p>
<p>One&mdash;two&mdash;three!</p>
<p>Doris shrank back from the door, and Mrs. Marshall caught  her in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, child, hush,&rdquo; she soothed the quivering, sobbing  girl. &ldquo;Hark! Listen! He&rsquo;s going downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris roused herself to listen and they heard the slow  descent. Then the sounds, ever growing fainter, ceased, and Doris fell limply  into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; said Madame suddenly, &ldquo;see, dear, it&rsquo;s back in the  garden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris sprang to look, and saw the faintly luminous shape  returning by the path it had come. It faded slowly and then entirely  disappeared, and though they watched for some time it did not reappear.</p>
<p>And now Doris was eagerly alert. &ldquo;I must go down stairs,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;and make sure the doors are all locked. You see, if this should be a  trick some one has played on me, a door or window must be unfastened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a flash she sprang from the room and flew down  stairs. Madame Marshall followed, and turning on the lights, they examined  every door and window on the lower floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Madame, softly, as she tried the lock of  the last door, &ldquo;every one is securely locked and bolted. No human being could  get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Doris, and then as she met the other&rsquo;s  frightened stare, a sort of reaction overcame her and she fainted. The nervous  strain had been too great.</p>
<p>Madame Marshall soon revived her and gently cared for her,  and at last Doris was once again in her own bed and had quieted down to a  normal calm. She refused the sleeping draught her friend offered, saying she  preferred to lie awake, if natural sleep refused to come to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try too hard to sleep, dear,&rdquo; said Madame, &ldquo;just  think of something pleasant, and forget what has happened to-night. I&rsquo;ll sit  here in this big chair by the window and keep guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris smiled faintly at the idea of forgetting the  dreadful experience that still thrilled her every nerve. But finally, her  physical nature triumphed and demanded rest through sheer exhaustion. She fell  into a deep, sound sleep which lasted till late the next morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  Doris Plays Cook</b></h2>
<p>When Doris came down stairs next morning, she found a fine  state of affairs, indeed!</p>
<p>Madame Marshall had told the household of the appearance  of the ghost, and the servants, except the two Judds had frantically packed up  their belongings and scurried away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t keep them, my dear,&rdquo; Madame Marshall explained  to Doris, &ldquo;and it was useless to waken you, for they said no persuasion would  induce them to remain another day in a haunted house. So, I paid them what was  due them, knowing you would repay me. Don&rsquo;t worry over their going, for the  cook wasn&rsquo;t very good, anyway, and that chauffeur was positively impertinent. I  will get better help for you in a day or two, and meanwhile faithful Judd and  Molly can do for us. Or, perhaps you won&rsquo;t care to stay in the house yourself.  I should think not, after last night! How glad I am that I was here with you!  If you had been alone&mdash;oh, I shudder to think of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molly brought in breakfast for Doris from the kitchen. As  the girl sat down at the table, she felt dazed, she could hardly pull herself  together. But the sight of Molly&rsquo;s solemn face and the glimpse of Judd, working  around outside, gave her a sudden realisation of two faithful and dependable  friends and helpers.</p>
<p>So, it was a shock when Molly said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be goin&rsquo;  to-day, Miss Doris,&mdash;Judd an&rsquo; me. You&rsquo;ve got Mis&rsquo; Marshall here, an&rsquo; she says  she&rsquo;ll get you some proper servants. We ain&rsquo;t much good, &mdash;the way you want  things,&mdash;an&rsquo; too, the story Mis&rsquo; Marshall tells of last night&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;s on, fair  takes the heart out o&rsquo; me. I&rsquo;d drop dead in my tracks if I saw a sperrit, an&rsquo;  Judd, he would too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris got up and went to the perturbed old woman. The  long, gaunt frame quivered as the two fluttering hands of the girl rested on  the old shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly,&rdquo; and Doris looked into her eyes, &ldquo;you break my  heart! You smash it into a thousand bits when you talk like that. Other workers  in this vineyard of mine may come and go,&mdash;but you and Judd go on forever. See?  Now, quit your fooling and clear away the breakfast table. That&rsquo;ll occupy your  mind and keep it off of ridiculous fairy tales. There wasn&rsquo;t any ghost, Molly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Doris, what do you mean?&rdquo; and Madame Marshall looked  amazed. &ldquo;You saw it as plainly as I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I did,&mdash;but now I believe it was all  imagination. In this bright sunlight of day, I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> believe that we saw a phantom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t! Well, I wish I couldn&rsquo;t! When I remember  those three hollow taps,&mdash;just like this,&rdquo;&mdash;and she slowly thudded on the  wall,&mdash;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking it was a warning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molly gave a shriek. &ldquo;Yes, Miss Doris, that always means  death is near for somebody. Oh, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> stay in this house, Miss Doris, dear, <i>pray</i> don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t, Molly,&mdash;she can&rsquo;t. No young girl ought to stay  in such a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In-deed!&rdquo; and Doris&rsquo; whole soul flamed up in wrath, &ldquo;now,  here&rsquo;s where I make a stand! This house is my house, this home is my home, and  these ghosts are my ghosts,&mdash;to do with as I will. Incidentally, the servants  were <i>my</i> servants and you had no  right, Madame, to come down here and tell them a story that would make them  clear out, without giving me a chance to hold them! But never mind that,&mdash;here&rsquo;s  the point of this declaration of independence. I <i>love</i> this house,&mdash;with an affection that you can&rsquo;t even understand,  Madame Marshall. In the short time I have been here it has grown into and  around my heart with a clinging strength like that old wistaria vine,&mdash;and you  know how strong that is. Here I am, and here I stay; and no ghosts or haunts or  phantoms can drive me out! I <i>was</i> scared last night, I frankly admit it, but I&rsquo;d rather be scared than go away  from this place. So there now! And if that was the ghost of the French soldier  who hid those pearls, I hope to goodness he&rsquo;ll come again, and keep on coming  till he finds &rsquo;em! By the way, he ought to know where they are! I wonder if  that indicates that they&rsquo;ve been taken away from here, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It indicates that you&rsquo;re a silly child! You don&rsquo;t even  know enough to be frightened at a supernatural visitation. As Molly says, such  an occurrence presages disaster, if not death, and I can tell you, miss, it is  no laughing matter. If you&rsquo;d read history, other than the American history you&rsquo;re  so eternally poring over, you&rsquo;d learn that many old families have authenticated  spectres which only appear when a calamity is at hand. But with your blind  ignorance and your foolhardy arrogance, you defy these conditions and you&rsquo;ll  yet rue the day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Madame Marshall,&rdquo; and Doris laughed gaily, &ldquo;&lsquo;rue  the day&rsquo; sounds melodramatic to me. But this whole situation is melodramatic,  and I don&rsquo;t mind being the leading lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leading lady! You chit of a girl! But, Doris,&rdquo; and the  angrily shaken earrings suddenly grew quiet, &ldquo;you must realise, dearie, that if  you insist on staying here you ought to have an older woman to live with you  and watch over you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, so I&rsquo;m going to prevail on Molly Judd to stand  by me,&mdash;if I have to tie her to the bedpost! Eh, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Solemn Molly looked at Doris sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said you was a handful the first time I laid eyes on  you, Miss Doris, an&rsquo; I still say so. But you grow more ontractable every day,  an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m sure I dunno what to do. I&rsquo;m fearfully afraid of sperrits, an&rsquo; always  have been, an&rsquo; the blood-cruddling way Mis&rsquo; Marshall told her story of that  spook last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the spook, Molly, you run along and do the  dishes. I&rsquo;m going to send for a general advisory board and thrash this matter  out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Marshall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite sure myself yet. But I&rsquo;m going to telephone for  some kind big man to advise me. A little girl can&rsquo;t decide everything for  herself even if she is ignorant and arrogant and bound to rue the day! I&rsquo;m  going to summon my friend and pardner, Mr. Stanchley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What earthly good can he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he can&rsquo;t lay ghosts, but maybe he can lay down a  few laws, that <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t seem able to  enforce in this house. And one is, that if ghosts appear, they are <i>not</i> to be at once reported to my  servants, with such harrowing details that said servants decamp! Do I make  myself plain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Doris dear, don&rsquo;t take that tone with me. I only  want to help and comfort you,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you do it by sending off all my help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t send them. Naturally, I told of our  experience,&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t seem to help it,&mdash;and then they all took fright. They&rsquo;re  an ignorant lot,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you say I&rsquo;m ignorant, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wilfully misunderstand me,&rdquo; and the earrings shook  with the deep sigh. &ldquo;But if you would try to like me a little better, I&rsquo;m sure  I could fill the place of housekeeper here,&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m Doris,&rdquo; the clear voice said into the telephone,  &ldquo;is Mr. Stanchley there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but I&rsquo;m Looly, won&rsquo;t I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you any good in spectre&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I a good inspector! What <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t say inspector,&mdash;I said,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind, let me come over and see what&rsquo;s it all  about. Mayn&rsquo;t I? I&rsquo;ve been dying for an excuse to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, come ahead, and come soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immejit. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>From the front piazza Doris impatiently watched the tall  figure as it drew nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a slowcoach he is!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like him heaps  better if he&rsquo;d only skittle once in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calm and unruffled, in raiment perfectly fitted and  properly creased, Looly greeted her gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice little Doris child, to let me come over in the  morning. Thought you were busy with your intensive gardening and housekeeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Housekeeping! well rather. You see before you the  chauffeur and cook and scullery-maid of the Nancy Brig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That my staff of menials has walked out <i>en masse</i>, except for my faithful Judds,  and they&rsquo;re on the brink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; Doris dropped her voice to appropriately  sepulchral tones, &ldquo;because the ghost walked last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, ghosts don&rsquo;t walk <i>really</i>, of course, but he gave a pretty fine imitation of a French  soldier seeking your lost pearls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Doris, tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I will. Come around on the other porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris told the story. Madame Marshall appeared, without  invitation, and added details here and there. Judd and Molly, unable to keep  away, hovered in the dining-room door, and uttered occasional insuppressible  groans or exclamations.</p>
<p>Looly looked very thoughtful. He said little, save to ask  a question now and then, but he asked only regarding facts, not opinions or  impressions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; he said, once in a while, and again, &ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; but  mostly he listened.</p>
<p>Suddenly he turned to the Judds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Miss Doris&rsquo; account of the affair sound the same as  Madame Marshall&rsquo;s did?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; declared old Jethro, but Molly demurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;I was a heap more scared by Madame  Marshall&rsquo;s story than by Miss Doris&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said Madame, &ldquo;Doris&rsquo; telling is the  repetition of mine, and of course it is not so thrilling as a first hearing.  And, too, Mr. Cutler, Doris doesn&rsquo;t appreciate the gravity of the matter. You  see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, Madame Marshall; are you quite <i>sure</i> you saw the spectre? Could it have  been imagination or hallucination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could not. Why, Doris and I both saw it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw it first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; from my window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hadn&rsquo;t retired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had, but I was wakeful, and the night was so warm, I  got up and sat by the window for a time. And as I looked out at the trees, I  saw the dim form take shape before my very eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Across the garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at the farthest corner. I went straight to Doris&rsquo;  room, because I thought she ought to know of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think it wiser to save the child from possible  unnecessary fright?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I thought too quickly, perhaps, but I knew Doris&rsquo;  interest in the legendary phantom, and my first impulse was to let her know it  had really arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a natural thought. Were you very frightened, Doris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;and no. I was physically frightened,&mdash;I mean, my  teeth chattered and my flesh turned cold and clammy, but still, I felt that I <i>must</i> watch it,&mdash; I must know what happened.  Then, when it came upstairs,&mdash;oh, yes, I <i>was</i> frightened then! I feared it would touch me&mdash;Oh, Looly, it was awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, I know. And you heard sounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, steps,&mdash;and the raps at the doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard the raps distinctly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faintly, but yes, distinctly, too. And when it rapped on  the door I was leaning against,&mdash;&rdquo; Doris shuddered, &ldquo;I felt the light impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I know,&mdash;I <i>know</i> he would have entered that room, but that it was Washington&rsquo;s room, and that  kept me safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris&rsquo; eyes shone with the glow that always irradiated  them at the mention of that revered name, and Looly nodded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;m glad you were in that room. But, Doris, this  isn&rsquo;t an inimical spirit. If it&rsquo;s the French soldier&rsquo;s wraith, he has no grudge  against you. He&rsquo;s just hunting the stuff that was confided to his care&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you <i>do</i> talk!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Marshall, &ldquo;why, a ghost is a ghost. Its appearance always  presages doom. Remember the great phantoms of history. Nearly all historic  houses are haunted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poppycock!&rdquo; and Looly drawled out the word with fine  scorn. &ldquo;Look here, Doris, put me on this job, will you? I&rsquo;d like to catch this  ghost for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch him? How? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one way would be to set a ghost-trap. Just as you&rsquo;d  set a mouse trap, don&rsquo;t you know? You bait it, and set it, and Mr. Ghost walks  into it, unbeknownst, and, there you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Looly, don&rsquo;t be silly! I thought you&rsquo;d help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will. Oh, I&rsquo;ll buy your flowers, little girl. But  about your servants. Did they really light out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but I can get more. For, you see, I&rsquo;m going to stick  to the ship. My theory is that now that Mr. Le Fevre has made his visit, he won&rsquo;t  come again till next August. How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little bit of all right. Of course he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;How absurd!&rdquo; and Mrs. Marshall jingled her earrings. &ldquo;I  should think Doris had had enough of ghosts! There&rsquo;s Rachel Hilton haunting  too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris&rsquo; bravado began to give way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mind her, and her mysterious letters, more than I do  the Frenchman,&rdquo; she said, her eyes dark with troubled fear. &ldquo;Remember, Looly,  how the candle went out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Madame, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i> the candle went out that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you here?&rdquo; asked Cutler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but next morning Doris wouldn&rsquo;t tell me what  happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor will I tell you now,&rdquo; said Doris, jumping up. &ldquo;For it&rsquo;s  time to get luncheon, and as Molly is just about worn out doing everybody&rsquo;s  work, I&rsquo;m going to send her off to rest and I&rsquo;m going to get luncheon myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll ask me to stay, I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; offered Looly.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a tip-top cook, and then we can talk over our problems, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. What&rsquo;s for lunch, Molly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chops, Miss Doris, and salad and&mdash;well, that&rsquo;s about  all;&mdash;you see, cook hadn&rsquo;t made the desserts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there ever a lunch that didn&rsquo;t have chops at it?&rdquo;  exclaimed Looly. &ldquo;But you let me at &rsquo;em, and I&rsquo;ll fix &rsquo;em up so, their own  maternal sheep wouldn&rsquo;t recognise them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; laughed Doris, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll make a dessert that  you&rsquo;ll be crazy about. Do you like blueberry puddings? Little cunnin&rsquo; ones,  with gorgeous hard sauce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I! Me for &rsquo;em! You can have my chops!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me make the salad,&rdquo; offered Madame Marshall. &ldquo;I can  do it, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; agreed Doris. &ldquo;Fix it up gay, Madame; there&rsquo;s  peppers in the garden and capers and dinky bottled things in the pantry. What  fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fun!&rdquo; and Solemn Molly looked doleful as she prepared to  leave them to their own devices. &ldquo;I will lie down for a bit, Miss Doris, for my  head is <i>that</i> upset! But I&rsquo;ll come  down to clear up after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Molly! I hate to clear up. Run along, I&rsquo;ll bring  you a cup of tea, soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Marshall concocted the salad, and further helped by  setting the table, and the two other cooks sent her off to rest till the feast  was all in readiness.</p>
<p>Doris, in one of Molly&rsquo;s enveloping aprons, beat away at  her batter until her cheeks were rosy pink and her hair in ringlets and  tendrils from the heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are cooks always as&mdash;as&mdash;er,&mdash;I mean is cooking so becoming  to everybody?&rdquo; and Looly smiled at the flushed little face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t to you,&rdquo; and Doris regarded him critically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  white as a sheet, and you look&mdash; well,&mdash;all in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! nothing of the sort. I&rsquo;m always pale and  interesting, and I&rsquo;m nervous for fear my breaded chops won&rsquo;t turn out all my  fancy has already painted them. Doris, will you fire that interloper, before  another dawn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I can&rsquo;t very well, Looly. And, too, I&rsquo;ve been  thinking. She insists I ought to have a woman to live here, I mean more  companionable and more my own sort than Molly, and she wants to be It. Whatcha  think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&mdash;oh, splash! how these chops sputter! Here, you  poke at them with this fork a minute, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing at Looly&rsquo;s scowl, Doris took the fork and deftly  turned the sizzling chops, and transferred them to the waiting platter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;everything&rsquo;s ready,&mdash; oh, will  you chip off a little ice for the drinking water? There,&mdash;in that refrigerator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do it, Queen of the Chippers! It&rsquo;ll cool you off a  bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lazybones!&rdquo; Doris said to herself, but aloud she said:  &ldquo;All right. You put things on the table, and summon Madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luncheon was a merry meal. Ghosts and kindred subjects  were taboo, and Madame Marshall exerted herself to be affable and entertaining.  Looly was gay, but thoughtful at intervals, and Doris was bothered because of  her indecision whether to ask Madame Marshall to remain longer, or to speed the  parting guest.</p>
<p>A chance speech decided her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;m here, dearie,&rdquo; the visitor said, &ldquo;you must  let me relieve you of much responsibility. If you&rsquo;ll order a car or a chauffeur  from somewhere, I&rsquo;ll fly down to New York this very afternoon, and bring you  back a staff of just-right servants. Don&rsquo;t you think, with me here, you&rsquo;d  rather set up a butler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris decided all at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With you here, Madame Marshall, a butler would be  delightful,&rdquo; she said, and the earrings bobbed with pleasure. &ldquo;But you see you&rsquo;re  not going to be here,&mdash;only until to-morrow. You said, you know, you were for  two nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearie, but that was before your dreadful  experience. You see yourself, now, you mustn&rsquo;t live alone. You need&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me over again what I need, please,&rdquo; and Doris&rsquo;  dimpled smile robbed the words of rudeness; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it so often! I think I <i>do</i> need a nice, chaperon sort of person,  but it won&rsquo;t be one who calls me dearie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll not do that, if you don&rsquo;t want me to! Why didn&rsquo;t  you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you; and I&rsquo;m sorry, but I must also tell you  that I can&rsquo;t offer you the position of chaperon. So let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t discuss the  subject, but consider it past history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Doris&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t &lsquo;But Doris&rsquo; me! I&rsquo;m here in my own home, and I&rsquo;ve  got to <i>live!</i> You don&rsquo;t know what I  mean by live, but I do. It isn&rsquo;t only playing golf and tennis, it isn&rsquo;t only  dressing up and going about with the young people, it&rsquo;s a life of my <i>own</i>, my <i>real</i> life, and I have to live it <i>alone</i>. I could stand a quiet, docile, unobtrusive little old lady,  but not,&rdquo;&mdash; she glanced at the earrings,&mdash;&ldquo;a fashionable, up-to-date society  lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The compliment pleased, but the definite statement so  angered Madame Marshall that she gave one annoyed exclamation and then fell  into a sullen hopeless silence for the rest of the meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Judd?&rdquo; exclaimed Doris in surprise, as, after  luncheon she summoned him in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent him over to Mrs. Busby&rsquo;s with a note,&rdquo; said Looly.  &ldquo;I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. Here he comes now. And there&rsquo;s the telephone.  Everything at once, of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The call was for Madame Marshall, and after informing her  of it, Doris went out to the swing to talk things over with Looly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  Doris And The Poet</b></h2>
<p>Hugh Stanchley laughed at Doris&rsquo; account of the ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how <i>do</i> you  explain it?&rdquo; she urged, when he said it couldn&rsquo;t have happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to begin with, you were all wrought up, and ready  to imagine anything that was supernatural, whether it was or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what <i>was</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy. Madame Marshall woke you from a sound sleep and  told you there was a ghost in the garden. Prepared to see one, you thought you  did see one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Stanchy, I <i>did</i> see it. It was glowing,&mdash;not bright, you know, but dully  luminous. It was <i>there</i>, it surely <i>was</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Doris, it&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came in the house, and came upstairs, and rapped  at all the doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear child, you thought you heard sounds, but you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Stanchley, you&rsquo;re trying to make me think what  you don&rsquo;t think yourself. You <i>know</i> I  couldn&rsquo;t imagine all that. And, you know there is a tradition of that ghost and  he comes in August and it <i>is</i> August.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, have it your own way. And, now, do you want  to sell this house and live somewhere else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I? I do <i>not!</i> Why, Stanchy, every day, every hour I live in this house, it twines its blessed  old self more and more closely around my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your figure of speech is a little unusual, but I gather  you are fond of the old place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fond!&rdquo; Doris held out her arms as if to caress the whole  atmosphere. &ldquo;Why, if I had to live anywhere else now, I&rsquo;d just plain, every-day <i>die</i>, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious! We mustn&rsquo;t have such a desirable citizen as you  cut off in the flower of her youth and beauty, so, I suppose it&rsquo;s just as well  I said No to a prospective purchaser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? that Hawkins idiot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same. He really was unpleasantly persistent in his  efforts to obtain possession of your adored domain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. He was here first, you know. I hope you were  positive and decided with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sent him packing! He wanted to turn the place into a  roadhouse! Why, it was sacrilege!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about it! Is he gone? Where does he live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s gone, I think. Forget him. Now, let&rsquo;s forget  everything unpleasant. You&rsquo;re here, and you&rsquo;ve the house pretty much in shape,  and you can begin to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if the ceiling painters ever get their work done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been delayed by lack of materials. But they&rsquo;ll  get around soon. And your August ghost has been and gone, and now, can&rsquo;t you  feel that you&rsquo;ve nothing to worry over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Stanchion, I don&rsquo;t worry! Why, I&rsquo;m as  happy as a bird, if Hawkinses and Marshallses and Rackhamses will let me alone,  to live my own life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they will. I see you can dismiss them, when  necessary. Have you good servants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good cook and chauffeur. The rest will be found sooner  or later. And look here, Mr. Guardian, how about my bills? Have I overrun my  allowance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, child. I&rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on you, and there are  lots of bills due about now, but your remittance from Mr. Lovell is due also,  and it will be ample.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; Doris gave a sigh of content. &ldquo;Now, in deference  to the conventions and to promote the general welfare, I&rsquo;m going to find a mild  little old lady to live here with me. She must be the sweetfaced, white-haired  sort, with old, yellowed lace ruffles at her wrists and a mull fichu with a  cameo brooch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the type, don&rsquo;t you? Can you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. Miss Luella knows a lady who may be willing  to come. Well, then I&rsquo;m going to give a party, a lawn f&ecirc;te, I think, and start  in correctly as a member of the younger set. Oh, Stanchy, life is very  bright,&mdash;I am so happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even though Guy Prentiss has gone to Plattsburg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Guy! He&rsquo;s the right sort. But what <i>do</i> you think of that Willy Vanilla over  at your Busby Palace? Isn&rsquo;t he the limit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looly Cutler? Why, I like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I like him, too. But he&rsquo;s so indolent and&mdash;  well,&mdash;languid is a word that fits him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Languid? Oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes. He sits around and never moves if he can help it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he was helping you solve the great mystery of  the Cutler pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is. That is, we talk about it when I can get time.  But it&rsquo;s only talk, of course. And he&rsquo;s trying to find out where those old  papers came from. He won&rsquo;t believe Rachel Hilton carefully laid them on the  library floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not! But, Doris, I don&rsquo;t just see myself how  they got there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t! Why, of course you don&rsquo;t. If you did, you&rsquo;d be  a warlock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A warlock. That&rsquo;s a man witch, a wizard. But I think  Looly is one. He does see into things, and I believe he will solve the mystery  of the papers, and of the candle that went out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was a draft of wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not! There wasn&rsquo;t a window open, or a door. And it  didn&rsquo;t <i>blow</i> out, it went out&mdash;it <i>died</i> out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t bother much about the candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. But it was queer. And the ghost was queer!  You may say all you like about imagination! I guess if you had seen that  wavering light, small and dim at first, and then growing bigger and taller and  then moving slowly along the garden path &mdash;<i>ooh!</i> I rather guess you wouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;imagination&rsquo;! Well, Looly says it wasn&rsquo;t a  ghost at all; and he&rsquo;s going to ferret out what it was. He&rsquo;s clever, Looly is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he writes poetry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Oh, that finishes him, then! A real live big man  writing poetry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men have done so, with conspicuous success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not <i>young</i> men&mdash;of <i>to-day!</i> Why doesn&rsquo;t he get out  and hustle for his country? George Washington didn&rsquo;t moon around writing poetry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, Looly Cutler is no milksop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. But he&rsquo;s more for ornament than use, as far  as fighting is concerned. I don&rsquo;t think his country needs him, unless he  cultivates a little more muscular energy. His blood is bluer than it is red!  Why, Miss Luella herself has more patriotism than her gentle namesake. He is  good-looking, but when you&rsquo;ve said that, you&rsquo;ve said all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Doris, how unjust you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then, what is he good for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a deep thinker&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thinks out rhymes and jingles! Well, then, why doesn&rsquo;t  he write a national anthem or a soldier&rsquo;s marching song?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a musician&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean the words! Why doesn&rsquo;t he write a second  Tipperary, or Star Spangled Banner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both those achieved popularity from the tune, not the  words. But I see you&rsquo;re prejudiced against Cutler, so nothing I can say will  help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s all right, and I do like to talk to him. Maybe I  can persuade him to learn to like a few outdoor sports, and then he&rsquo;d be good  fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. Men with brains in their heads don&rsquo;t always  run to muscle too. Your friend Washington was no athlete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they had golf or tennis when he was  young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor motors. I suppose he always rode a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He rode the two hind legs of a horse,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what <i>he</i> rode!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably Cutler would do that if you asked him to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I&rsquo;d like to see him! A Sedan chair would suit him  better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon the disdained Looly sauntered over  to see Doris.</p>
<p>That smiling young person, after the manner of her sort,  gave no hint of disapproval, and greeted the marvellously attired youth with a  pair of outstretched fluttering little hands that spoke welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Solomon in all his glory had nothing on you,&rdquo; she commented,  looking at the old gold tie and silk socks that nearly matched the thick shock  of hair. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; pity the old chap lived before the days of Palm  Beach robes. He&rsquo;d have loved &rsquo;em. Has old rue-the-day Marshall gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, long ago. I haven&rsquo;t seen you for days and days!  Where you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Writing poetry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutler looked surprised. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One has only to look at you to know. You have that  poetic, aesthetic, good-for-nothing air&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looly flushed scarlet. &ldquo;You little scamp! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I say. Why don&rsquo;t you play tennis or golf? Why don&rsquo;t  you go off on tramps with the rest of us? Why don&rsquo;t you walk with a brisk swing  instead of like a loping anaconda!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutler had been looking at her with indignation, but her  last words brought a roar of laughter from him, and he settled back in a  lounging chair, looking more indolent than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t all be Sandows,&rdquo; he said, and I&rsquo;m so busy with  my head-piece, that I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve little time for exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; commented Doris. &ldquo;And what is this wonderful poetry  stuff you&rsquo;ve been grinding out? Mayn&rsquo;t I hear some of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutler looked at her amusedly. &ldquo;Be careful, my angel  child, not to let that habit of sarcasm grow on you. It will spoil your gentle,  meek-eyed charm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meek-eyed!&rdquo; and the gleam that shot from Doris&rsquo; brown  orbs was anything but docile. &ldquo;You remind me of a meek-eyed cow yourself!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleased and proud,&rdquo; murmured Cutler. &ldquo;But, since you  flatter me by asking of my productions, may I read one I wrote for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrote for me? Oh, goody! I never had a poem written to me  before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The personal note helps, does it? But I didn&rsquo;t say to  you, I said for you. I wouldn&rsquo;t presume to write one to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wish you would,&mdash;really I do. All right, read me the  one for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris sat listening, and with a half shy air, Cutler read,  in his slow, pleasant voice, his own lines:</p>
<p align="center" class="note">Washington at Collander</p>
<p align="center" class="note">&mdash;1781&mdash;<br>
  He came, whelmed by a nation&rsquo;s ills,<br>
  By might of foes and war&rsquo;s alarms;<br>
  He gazed out o&rsquo;er these star-topped hills,&mdash; <br>
  His soul in arms.</p>
<p align="center" class="note">&mdash;1783&mdash;<br>
  Again he came. Secure the state!<br>
  Won for our forebears and for us;<br>
  His conqueror soul proudly elate,&mdash;<br>
  Victorious</p>
<p align="center" class="note">-1917-<br>
  Still here, in never-dying fame,<br>
  His spirit lives, while ages roll;<br>
  We reverently breathe his name,&mdash;<br>
  The hero soul!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Looly!&rdquo; Doris stared hard at him. &ldquo;Did you really do  that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; diffidently. &ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love it. It&rsquo;s my Washington you wrote it about! Oh,  give it to me! You said it was for me, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m glad you like it. It&rsquo;s so hard not to write  platitudes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did know exactly what platitudes were, but this  isn&rsquo;t &rsquo;em, I know. Oh, I do like it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lovely face was aglow with pleasure, and the  fluttering hands clasped themselves round the precious paper in a joy of  possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only be here about a fortnight longer,&rdquo; Cutler said,  &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t you think we can get some forrarder with our pearl fishery in that  time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we might, but to tell you the truth I don&rsquo;t know  which way to look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I. I&rsquo;ve concluded there&rsquo;s nothing to that willow  pattern plate guess. Maybe the hiding-place is a willow tree, but if so, I  think the dying gladiator would have said so, and not lugged in the pitcher at  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too. And the family plate is hopeless as a  clue. So where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not anywhere. But think up some other allusion for plate.  Suppose there&rsquo;s a plate set into the wall somewhere, I mean a&mdash;a name plate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you have in mind is a coffin plate, but they don&rsquo;t  set those in walls, except in old castles where there are crypts and family  burial vaults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mightn&rsquo;t there be here? All walled over, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I asked the architect about that, and he said there  were no concealed places tucked away anywhere. Try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a collection plate,&mdash;at church. Maybe the family  gave one,&mdash;sort of memorial, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be. Let&rsquo;s go to see the sexton of all the old  churches around here. But, no, they didn&rsquo;t use plates for collections then.  They had silk bags on the end of long poles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they, really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve read of them; and later they had long-handled  boxes, rather like corn-poppers. Plates are a very modern innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles that, then. Well, I still incline to a metal  plate set in somewhere, like a fireplace or brick wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a free country. You may incline which way you like.  Good gracious, here comes my grave and reverend guardian again! Two visits in  one day! I am complimented, Mr. Stanchley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hugh Stanchley didn&rsquo;t smile as he sat down near his  young ward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you run along home, Looly,&rdquo; he said to Cutler. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  some matters to discuss with Doris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutler caught the serious note in the speaker&rsquo;s voice, and  rising slowly, he said good-bye, and sauntered off toward the Busby house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it all about?&rdquo; asked Doris, gaily, and then  ceased to smile as she saw a positively pained look on Stanchley&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to tell you, Doris, my dear. I have very  bad news for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bad news soon told, Br&rsquo;er Fox,&rsquo; &rdquo; she quoted from her  favourite Uncle Remus story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon told, but&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how to begin. Mr. Lovell came  to see me to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Mr. Lovell? Why didn&rsquo;t he come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He brought the bad news. Doris, he re-invested your money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lost it!&rdquo; cried the girl, with instant premonition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;is it very bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;all gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The busy fingers interlaced, then untwined. One  tightly closed hand pressed its knuckles against her lips as the other pounded  on the side of her chair. Then, flinging both arms wide, she said: &ldquo;Never mind,  Stanchy, I have my home, this dear place, and I can get along. I will retrench,  discharge all servants except the Judds&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Doris, dear child, you don&rsquo;t understand. The bills,  the big bills for all this work you&rsquo;ve had done, are not paid. They were to be  paid out of this quarter&rsquo;s income. And&mdash;there is no income.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stanchley made no response, but suddenly Doris knew. A  cold chill struck her heart. She couldn&rsquo;t speak,&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t put the dreadful  thing into words, &mdash;but she knew!</p>
<p>At last Stanchley said, miserably, &ldquo;Mr. Lovell wants you  to go to live with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the Lovells!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He knows you can&rsquo;t keep this&mdash; That is, he feels that  as he lost your money, he ought to offer you a home. But I don&rsquo;t think it was  his fault. A sudden depreciation of values that he could not foresee,&mdash;oh,  Doris, dear, don&rsquo;t take it so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Doris was choking. Determined not to give way to the  feeling of faintness that well-nigh overcame her, she gasped for breath, and  the very vividness of her understanding of what had happened made her acutely  alive to its shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is there no hope&mdash;no chance&mdash;&rdquo; she managed to  articulate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the recovery of your money? None at all. It is swept  away as surely as if the ocean had engulfed it. Forgive me, but I think it  kinder to tell you the absolute truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes. But isn&rsquo;t there enough for me&mdash;to&mdash; to&mdash;somehow  stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see how. The bills you have incurred are quite  equal to the previous value of the whole place, if not more. Unless these can  be met,&mdash;of course, &mdash;I wish I could help you out, but I am not a rich man. You  could mortgage the place perhaps, but then you would have nothing to pay  interest with&mdash; or to live on. You see, child, you are by no means destitute,  for you have the house, and even with the amounts due, there&rsquo;s a good equity in  it for you. But you cannot continue to live in it. Do you think you&rsquo;ll go to  the Lovells&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not live here? Go to the Lovells&rsquo;?&rdquo; Doris looked dazed.  Her agitation had passed but she was now abnormally calm. Her glance was  wandering and her hands played nervously. &ldquo;Why, Mr. Stanchley, I <i>must</i> live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear little girl&mdash;&rdquo; The tears at last began to  come into the brown eyes. &ldquo;There, there! Oh, I am so sorry for you! Doris,  suppose I go away now, and come back to talk things over. You go and rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she assented vaguely. &ldquo;Yes, go, Mr.  Stanchley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With bowed head the lawyer walked away. It was a terrible  situation he had to face. Through no fault of his, through little if any fault  of Doris&rsquo; other guardian, the money left the girl by her father, which had been  a large sum originally and which had increased greatly of late years, was  entirely swept away, by a colossal business failure. The child had the house,  with its debts, and nothing else. The house could be sold, debts and all, with  a fairly substantial sum left for Doris, but as Stanchley had said, she couldn&rsquo;t  live there.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Walking uncertainly, Doris went into the house, and  upstairs to the room hallowed by the memories of her hero.</p>
<p>She sat down by a window, and looked out into the thick  greenery of the old trees, the great monarchs, that had been goodly-sized trees  when Washington looked out on them.</p>
<p>At first, Doris laid her head down on the window sill and  cried. Cried in a very abandonment of grief and despair. It was hopeless, there  was no chance&mdash; no way of escape. She cried until her tears were exhausted, and  then sat, shaken with deep, painful sobs.</p>
<p>The future was a blank&mdash;a black, awful blank. Life at  Lovells&rsquo; had been bad enough when she had been an heiress. Now, penniless and  dependent, life there would be unbearable. To be sure, their money was gone,  too. Mr. Lovell had invested his fortune with hers. But Doris had no room in  her full heart just then to be sorry for the Lovells. She was absorbed in her  own misery.</p>
<p>A long time she sat there. Her mind raced through various  vicissitudes that might come to her, various life plans that she might  pursue,&mdash;but always she came back to the one stunning blow,&mdash;she must leave  Collander!</p>
<p>Her mind dwelt on Washington. There he had sat, just where  she was now,&mdash;despairing, as she was now.</p>
<p>She faintly smiled to herself at the comparison of her own  woe with that long ago crisis on which the fate of a nation hung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a little girl, and  this trouble to me is as great as his was to him. Anyway, it&rsquo;s all my heart  will bear, and he couldn&rsquo;t have had more than <i>that!</i>&rdquo; Then came more thoughts of her hero,&mdash;of his strength and  endurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only could see a way out,&rdquo; moaned the poor child.  &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so&mdash;so final! I&rsquo;ve got to give up this place, and&mdash;oh, and that  dreadful man will buy it for a roadhouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tears flowed afresh; this last thought was a crushing  blow.</p>
<p>But the very horror of it gave Doris a sort of new will  power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall not be!&rdquo; she whispered, beating her little  clenched hands on the window-sill. &ldquo;I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> submit! Washington overcame his obstacles, he conquered when <i>everything</i> was against him, when he had  no men, no funds, no help, no encouragement,&mdash;he sat up here,&mdash;it says so in the  history,&mdash;with his soul in arms! I shall fight for my home, for the home that I  love. And I shall win! <i>My</i> soul is in  arms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  Doris And The Family Plate</b></h2>
<p>But with all the bravery, all the will power and all the  fighting spirit that Doris could conjure up for the weapons of her &ldquo;soul in  arms,&rdquo; she was practically helpless. One cannot pay architects&rsquo; and carpenters&rsquo;  bills with bravery, or keep up the running expenses of a big estate on will  power alone.</p>
<p>The next morning she called the two old Judds in  consultation.</p>
<p>Solemn Molly sat and stared blankly, in a very  bewilderment of woe, but old Jethro broke out in fierce and voluble anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m plumb mad!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Just as you got ready  to live neat and pretty, to have a whack in the face like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a whack in my heart, Judd,&rdquo; and Doris smiled sadly.  &ldquo;You know how I love this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, Miss Doris, you love it closer&rsquo;n a brother! I&rsquo;ve  seen you adorin&rsquo; of it, when you thought no one was lookin&rsquo;. And somehow, you&rsquo;ve  et your way into my old heart, till what hurts you, hurts me twict as much. I&rsquo;m  free to confess, Miss Doris, when you first come, I was a bit skittish about  you. You was so,&mdash;well, so dressy an&rsquo; tasty-like, I feared you&rsquo;d be one too many  for us old-fashioned, plain folks. But dressy though you be, you&rsquo;ve a sweet,  sound nater, and I&rsquo;m for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Judd,&rdquo; said Doris, very sincerely. &ldquo;And let me  tell you this: though I&rsquo;m just fearfully fond of you and Molly, and I hate to  go and leave you, it&rsquo;s a comfort to know that you two will still be here living  in the old place and loving it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Land sakes, Miss Doris,&rdquo; Molly broke in, rousing from her  apathy. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t to think we&rsquo;ll stay here if you go away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Molly; you know Abel Hilton&rsquo;s trust fund for you  two, is only for as long as you remain in this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust fund! Huh!&rdquo; grunted Judd. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re our trust fund,  Miss Doris, and you can just bet that whithersoever thou goest me and Molly&rsquo;ll  trot along too. Lessen you go to board some place, and even then we&rsquo;ll pitch a  tent nearby. Say, we got a little saved up, Miss Doris, if &rsquo;twould be any use to  you, now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Judd; you make me feel like a heroine in a  novel,&mdash;with my good old retainers offering me their little hoard! But it would  be only a drop in the bucket, and I wouldn&rsquo;t take it, anyway. I&rsquo;m more grateful  for your kind-heartedness toward me, than I&rsquo;d be for a whole heap of money,&mdash;  that is, unless the heap was big enough for all I want! Then, I&rsquo;d take it  pretty quick! You see, Judd, it&rsquo;s a clean sweep. I haven&rsquo;t a cent in the world,  but this place, and though that&rsquo;s valuable and&mdash;and s-salable, I d-d-don&rsquo;t want  to s-sell it!&rdquo; Doris tried not to, but the thought of sale was too much for  her, and in Molly&rsquo;s quickly outstretched arms she sobbed her poor little  stricken heart out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, lammie,&rdquo; said old Molly, crying, too,  &ldquo;there, there, dear Miss Doris,&mdash;don&rsquo;t-ee, don&rsquo;t-ee, now. Maybe&mdash;&rdquo; but Molly  couldn&rsquo;t think of a single comforting maybe in the desolate outlook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo; sounded a brisk voice, and without  waiting permission, Busybody Busby entered the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land sake, Mis&rsquo; Busby!&rdquo; cried Jethro, &ldquo;must you be always  a intrudin&rsquo; of yourself everywheres!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, don&rsquo;t get techy. Mr. Stanchley, he sent me over  to see what I could do. I say, Doris, I&rsquo;m all broke up over this trouble of yourn,  and I want you should come over to live with me. I&rsquo;ll give you my best front  chamber, and I&rsquo;ll make you as comfortable as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The honest plainness of Mrs. Busby&rsquo;s offer was backed up  by such sincere sympathy and wholehearted desire to help, that Doris realised  the kindness of the intrusive and self-important landlady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully good to me, Mrs. Busby, and I may be glad  to go to your house for a time,&mdash;till I decide what to do. You see, I only knew  about this last night, and I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t got used to it yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, poor child. And don&rsquo;t you think Mr. Stanchley&rsquo;s been  telling it all over. He just told me and the Cutlers, that&rsquo;s all, and he did  that out of his kindness o&rsquo; heart. For, says he, what&rsquo;s that child goin&rsquo; to do?  So, of course, my first thought was to offer you a home under my roof. Miss  Cutler, she sent her love and says she&rsquo;d like to come to see you, soon&rsquo;s you  can bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris laughed involuntarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no death in the family!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t  look on me as afflicted. I&rsquo;m not going to be &lsquo;sorrowfully resigned&rsquo; and all  that. I&rsquo;m <i>mad!</i> mad as a hornet! mad  as a wet hen! but I&rsquo;m not crushed flat. I have to cry a little,&mdash;&rsquo;most anybody  would,&mdash; but I&rsquo;d be a pretty specimen of an American patriot if I couldn&rsquo;t bear  trouble. Only, it&rsquo;s such&mdash;such <i>biting</i> trouble. Why, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind working&mdash; any kind of work, if I could keep my  home. But,&mdash; I thought about it all night,&mdash;and there&rsquo;s no work a girl like me  can do, that would bring in enough to run this big house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Mrs. Busby shook her head  thoughtfully. &ldquo;Unless,&mdash;say, Doris, you might keep a boardin&rsquo; house here. It&rsquo;d  take away from my patronage,&mdash;but I wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris looked at her gratefully. &ldquo;Mrs. Busby, that&rsquo;s a big,  generous offer, and I appreciate it, for I know what it means to you. But, I  wouldn&rsquo;t do that, even if I could. You see,&mdash;to have this dear old house filled  with transient, thoughtless people, giddygadding all over it, would be almost  as bad as &mdash;as what Mr. Hawkins suggested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what he&rsquo;ll probably do, if he gets hold of the  place,&rdquo; Mrs. Busby nodded sagaciously. &ldquo;Land, Doris, I wish I could take the  house off your hands and run the two&mdash;but you wouldn&rsquo;t like that, either, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear Mrs. Busby, I wouldn&rsquo;t like anything, but just  to stay here myself, just as&mdash;as I expected to. I don&rsquo;t know yet what I <i>can</i> do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you don&rsquo;t, you poor child! Well, I must run  back, I&rsquo;ve oceans to do. But, remember, any way I can help you, I&rsquo;m more&rsquo;n  willin&rsquo;. Just call on Mary Ann Busby for anythin&rsquo; <i>you</i> want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boardin&rsquo; house, indeed!&rdquo; stormed Judd, as Mrs. Busby went  away. &ldquo;That woman ain&rsquo;t got but one idea in her empty head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now, Judd, she meant well,&rdquo; defended Doris, &ldquo;and if  that&rsquo;s her only idea, we couldn&rsquo;t expect anything else of her. But I couldn&rsquo;t  make a lot of money from a boarding house. Why, my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you couldn&rsquo;t! The boarders would eat up all the  garden&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then the ghosts would eat up the boarders!&rdquo; and Doris  laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; said Solemn Molly, &ldquo;nobody would  come here to board with them ghost stories flyin&rsquo; about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nobody will be asked to come here to board. I shan&rsquo;t  let my pet ghosts be put out of their haunts for any horrid old boarders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land! Miss Doris, how you <i>do</i> talk! Well, me an&rsquo; Judd&rsquo;ll stand by you, an&rsquo; if you want to set  up a small home,&mdash;which, as I see it, is all you <i>can</i> do,&mdash;me an&rsquo; Judd is ready to go with you an&rsquo; work for you, if  you want us. We don&rsquo;t care two cents about Mr. Hilton&rsquo;s old trust fund&mdash;compared  with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris, deeply touched at this proof of affection and  loyalty, began to cry afresh, and her face was buried on Molly&rsquo;s shoulder when  Looly Cutler appeared at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sobfest, Doris?&rdquo; he said, trying to speak cheerily. &ldquo;Go  ahead, it&rsquo;ll do you good. Would you rather I didn&rsquo;t come in now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, come on in. I can pour out my woes to you, and give  Molly and Judd a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pour away. It&rsquo;s hard lines, little girl. How I wish I  could help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could, Looly. But nobody can. The case is  beyond all human assistance. If the French soldier&rsquo;s ghost, now, would only  find the pearls, and tell me where they are, I could get the reward, and live  happy ever after!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land, Miss Doris, don&rsquo;t call on the spooks for help!&rdquo;  exclaimed Molly as she and Judd were leaving the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d call quick enough,&rdquo; Doris averred to Looly, &ldquo;if it  would do a particle of good. But Collander spooks are not of a helpful sort.  Seriously, there&rsquo;s no way out; and all I have to do now, is to get used to the  idea of dragging out a miserable existence somewhere else, instead of <i>living</i> here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plucky girl. But don&rsquo;t take it <i>too</i> calmly. Give way to your feelings now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all ready to &lsquo;ky and kick and keam and hold my  bwef,&rsquo; but what&rsquo;s the use? No,&rdquo; and Doris brushed away some persistent tears,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to meet this blow, and I may as well do it decently and in order.  But,&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to inscribe my name in the index of Fox&rsquo;s &lsquo;Book of Martyrs&rsquo;  which I found up in the oldest corner of the oldest attic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it an old copy? Let me see it, it may be valuable&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I might sell it for enough to pay my bills and stay  here! Nothing doing, Looly. I looked at the date long ago, and it isn&rsquo;t a first  edition, but a later reprint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! Another good scheme gone wrong! You&rsquo;re a brick,  Doris, the way you buck up, but, oh, <i>girl</i>,  I&rsquo;m sorry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Looly, you&rsquo;re sympathetic in the nicest way. And  I&rsquo;m not a pauper, you know. I&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m what old Judd calls &lsquo;proppity poor.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll  have to sell the place, but, Looly, do help me to devise some way <i>not</i> to sell it to Leonard Hawkins! I  could stand it, if some nice people lived here, but&mdash; if that man gets it&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I  just <i>can&rsquo;t</i> stand it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll organise a Home Guard of two to keep off  Hawkinses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you belong&mdash;are you on a Home Defence League&mdash;really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you <i>anything?</i> Aren&rsquo;t you even interested in the war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&mdash;er&mdash;yes, of course, I&rsquo;m interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Doris&mdash;look there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris followed the direction of Looly&rsquo;s staring eyes, and  saw an old paper lying in the identical spot the previous two had lain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s another!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You pick it up &mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutler stepped across the room and picked up the paper, a  bit gingerly, and returning, sat by Doris&rsquo; side, and they read it together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is older than the others,&rdquo; said Doris, looking  wonderingly at the yellowed paper and the faded ink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is it? It&rsquo;s a bill, I think. But it&rsquo;s long  before Rachel Hilton&rsquo;s day. See, it&rsquo;s seventeen hundred and something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Rachel didn&rsquo;t put it there, and it must have been  brought by the French soldier!&rdquo; Doris laughed a little hysterically, and Looly  said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, see here, Doris, these papers aren&rsquo;t left by spooks,  let&rsquo;s give up that nonsense. There&rsquo;s a reasonable, rational explanation of  their appearance, and I&rsquo;m going to find it, and I&rsquo;m going to find it <i>now</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see first what this bill&rsquo;s about. Look, Looly, it&rsquo;s  for engraving something. Stationery,&mdash;I think that word is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and here&rsquo;s a clearer line. Why, it&rsquo;s for one hundred  books, no, book&mdash;plates. Oh, yes, bookplates. And it&rsquo;s made out to,&mdash;no, the name  is illegible. But it&rsquo;s a daisy of an old paper! Now to trace its source.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutler went to the corner where he had found the paper,  and getting down on his knees searched the floor and baseboard; then, rising,  looked at the chimney jamb and door frames, all of which he had done a dozen  times before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up!&rdquo; cried Doris, suddenly; &ldquo;oh, Looly, <i>look!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked, and protruding through an almost invisible  crack in the ceiling was the corner of another yellowed paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoopi Eureka! There&rsquo;s the secret! Doris, there&rsquo;s a cubby  right above here&mdash;that would be&mdash; yes, it would be under those few steps, the  ones that go up to the new front rooms on the second floor, don&rsquo;t you know?  Come out in the hall, I&rsquo;ll show you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stepped out into the old hall, and looked up, and  sure enough, beneath the few steps that were necessary on account of the two  different floor levels of the bedrooms, was necessarily a space. It was walled  and panelled and had been recently painted, but indubitably that was where the  papers came from.</p>
<p>Stepping back to the library, Looly on a chair, gently  pulled out the protruding paper. It was another old bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear as day!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That cubbyhole is full of old  papers and they sift out once in a while through that tiny crack. The jarring  of footsteps above them, on the stairs, shakes them around, and when one edge  happens to strike the crack squarely, it sifts through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s such a mite of a crack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why the papers hit it so seldom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the painters to paint this  ceiling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they had, it would have sealed up that place forever!  But I don&rsquo;t see why the carpenters didn&rsquo;t open it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were so hurried, you know. I never dreamed of there  being anything in that space. I think there was a sort of door, but it wouldn&rsquo;t  open, so they painted right over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, is that so! Let&rsquo;s pry into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All  right. It&rsquo;ll mar the paint,&mdash;but,&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter now.&rdquo; Doris&rsquo; voice quivered, and Looly hurriedly went on  talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. Us for the mystery! Why, Doris, this may mean  any thing! It may mean&mdash;pearls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Doris braced up. Eagerly she flew to old Judd for  tools, and returned with a chisel and hammer and screwdriver.</p>
<p>Judd followed with more tools and a step-ladder, and they  found Looly sitting on the lowest step of the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do it, Judd,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll direct. Pry in  there, see,&mdash;just next that moulding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris looked at him, the old feeling of contempt for his  indolence rising in her breast. But she was so interested in developments, she  forgot Looly in her excitement.</p>
<p>After some vigorous picking and prying, Judd opened up the  old place.</p>
<p>A veritable hidy-hole it was, and stuffed with old papers,  books and rubbish.</p>
<p>Doris pounced on the things as Judd threw them out, and  was disappointed to find them really rubbish. A lot of copybooks there were, that  some long ago children had laboriously filled with pothooks; sheafs of old  bills, that promised little interest; some more leaves of Rachel Hilton&rsquo;s  diary; and a few old letters. But mostly, the find was old newspapers and books  not sufficiently old to be of real value, and dull of themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see through it,&rdquo; Looly said at last. &ldquo;This place was  always a receptacle for old papers, and though there might have been very old  things in it, they were routed out by later comers and fresh rubbish put in. That  old bill that fell through is among the very old ones, and there may be more.  But! see nothing that has the glimmer of pearls, do you, Doris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I&rsquo;m disappointed. I felt sure one of my pet  ghosts was opening up a way for me to get out of my trouble, and here I am back  in the slough of despond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are a few account books that are very old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And very tattered. They&rsquo;ll drop to pieces if you touch  them. Where were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tied up in a bundle by themselves. Look out, they&rsquo;re  positively crumbly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looly still sat on the stair, and Doris on the floor  beside him. Judd pulled out every scrap of paper there was in the cubby and  declared it empty at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; Doris said, &ldquo;bring a big box, Judd, or baskets,  and we&rsquo;ll sort this stuff out. You see, Looly, we must look carefully at every  piece, and we may glean a hint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the gleaning&rsquo;s poor, my lady fair, but I&rsquo;ll see it through. Let&rsquo;s be systematic, and then we won&rsquo;t  have to go over these old horrors twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the morning they worked on their task, until they had  scrutinised every scrap of age-worn, tattered paper, and had learned nothing of  definite purport. To an antiquarian the old papers would be a find, but to  these two youngsters, each secretly hoping something about the pearls would be  discovered, it was merely a bunch of junk.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300401h-images/page245.jpg" alt="page245" width="676" height="750"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing, my girl,&rdquo; and Looly rose and stretched his  cramped frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; those old books are all of the dryest type of  reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old law books, those are. No good now: I doubt if dealers  would look at them, they&rsquo;re so desiccated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they queer?&rdquo; and Doris gingerly fingered the  tattered tomes. &ldquo;And see, they have bookplates in. You know that bill mentioned  bookplates. I&rsquo;m &mdash;I mean, I <i>was</i> going  to have one made for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can have a bookplate all the same, if you don&rsquo;t  live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looly!&rdquo; Doris gave a wild, half-gasped exclamation, and  dropped into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s up now? Have you seen a ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! But I&rsquo;ve got an idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now, I can&rsquo;t stand many more shocks to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;but really! Oh, Looly, come into the library. Shut  the door! No more letters can appear, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! Oh,&mdash;<i>haven&rsquo;t</i> you thought of it yourself? Hasn&rsquo;t it occurred to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you it hasn&rsquo;t. But break it gently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will. Looly Cutler, the family plate is&mdash;the bookplate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, Doris! It <i>is!</i> Whoopee! Wow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Don&rsquo;t let anybody hear. But where does that bring  us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think! Why, the old bookplate was in the books of  the library of the man who lived here then. They hadn&rsquo;t very big libraries in  those days, but they were choice of them and their bookplates were fine and  elaborate. You saw some in those old books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there&rsquo;s one in that old Fox&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run and get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris brought it, and sure enough, there was an old bookplate,  but it bore date of 1858.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is a modern book, and a modern bookplate. We&rsquo;re  after the old one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t find any. Whatever old books of that period  were left in the house are not here now, they&rsquo;re scattered to the winds of  heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And anyway,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to shatter your hope, &mdash;but how  could the soldier conceal pearls in a bookplate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris sat as if in a dream. Her deep brown eyes grew vague  and faraway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, slowly. &ldquo;But he wrote a note or  memorandum of where he <i>did</i> hide them,  and,&mdash;he concealed the paper in one of the bookplates in some book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little far-fetched, honey, but&mdash;well, it might be. Does  your inner consciousness tell you <i>what</i> book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not, but it tells me to search for said volume.  And, oh, Looly, I&rsquo;ve another idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thick as leaves in Vallombrosa! Divulge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, all those old account books have bookplates in. We  can at least look in those!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can, indeed! Doris, you are one witch! You certainly,  surely are!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  Doris On The Trail</b></h2>
<p>Very carefully they picked over the old account-books.  Some had bookplates in, brown and stained, to be sure, but fairly legible. The  half-obliterated design showed a crest or coat of arms, with a scroll-like  ornament below.</p>
<p>Suddenly Doris gave a shout. &ldquo;Here it is!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;oh,  Looly, see! This bookplate has a paper under it, and it&rsquo;s half peeled off,  anyway. Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful, there. Don&rsquo;t jerk it. Let me try.&rdquo; Taking the  book from Doris&rsquo; quick, nervous fingers, Cutler gently manipulated the old  cover, and slowly drew from the sheltering bookplate a paper slip. It was very  thin, a sort of parchment paper, and had a few lines written on it, in a  cramped, old-fashioned hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like the writing of the Declaration of Independence,&rdquo;  exclaimed Doris, who possessed a fine copy. &ldquo;Can you read it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; have you a reading glass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here&rsquo;s one. Oh, Looly, is it&mdash;is it <i>it!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is!</i> Doris,  it sure <i>is!</i> Here, you read it,&mdash;it&rsquo;s your  find!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excitedly, Doris grasped the glass, and studied the paper.  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out a thing!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You try, Looly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a patient study, Cutler managed to make out these  words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pearls of&mdash;Luella Cutler&mdash;in care&mdash;lady&mdash;neath weeping willow  tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; he cried, disappointedly, &ldquo;under a tree!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Doris&rsquo; eyes were shining. &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;oh, I  know! It&rsquo;s the picture Abby Rackham&rsquo;s mother had! Don&rsquo;t you know, the old  funeral urn, and the lady by the weeping willow? And, Looly! That soldier said &lsquo;willow  picture,&rsquo; not willow pitcher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris! You&rsquo;re a wonder! Of course he did! We&rsquo;re forging  ahead &rsquo;most too rapidly, but it&rsquo;s all true! This is,&mdash;it <i>must</i> be&mdash;a direction where to find the pearls. He told of the family  plate, and then mentioned the willow picture, knowing either of them would be  indicative. But how could he hide pearls in a picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, easily. Between the back board and the canvas,&mdash;or in  the frame, maybe. Or, perhaps the picture is only a clue to look further still.  And, too, Looly, maybe they&rsquo;re not big pearls, but little seed pearls, that  would easily slip in behind the picture itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big order, Doris. You&rsquo;ve unearthed the secret,&mdash;so  far, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and before we go farther, we ought to tell Miss  Luella, she has a right to know. And Mr. Stanchley, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but no one else. Don&rsquo;t let the Busy Bee in on this,  or she&rsquo;ll report it all over the neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Doris picked up the telephone  and called the others over.</p>
<p>Hugh Stanchley was a little dubious at first, but when he  examined the paper by means of the reading glass, he agreed that Looly had read  it aright, and that it must mean what they had assumed. Both he and Miss Cutler  were greatly interested in the old cubby under the stairs, and in the lot of  old papers that were now sorted into piles, or thrown into baskets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re valuable, Doris,&rdquo; Hugh Stanchley said,  &ldquo;or would be, if they&rsquo;d hold together long enough for an antiquarian to look  them over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, Mr. Stanchley,&rdquo; Doris said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m all for  the willow picture now. To think of that old tradition of a pitcher suddenly  turned into a picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most natural mistake,&rdquo; observed Miss Luella. &ldquo;A willow  pitcher is more often heard of than a willow picture, though those old funeral  mementoes were much thought of. Who has it, Doris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abby Rackham told me her mother had it. Then it fell to  Abby, and, oh, I do believe she said she sold it! I thought little of it at the  time, but I remember now, she said she sold it to a dealer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s lost forever!&rdquo; and Miss Cutler looked very  disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;sir-ee!&rdquo; cried Doris, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hunt that thing down, if  it takes all summer! I&rsquo;ll go to Maine and get it, if I have to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telegraph her,&rdquo; suggested Looly, &ldquo;send a night letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send it now, I can&rsquo;t wait till night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The result of the despatch to Abby Rackham was a reply the  next day stating that she had sold the picture to a dealer in her home town,  who, in turn, had sold it to an antique dealer in Poughkeepsie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me for there!&rdquo; cried Doris, as she read the message. She  called up Looly to ask if he and his aunt would go to Poughkeepsie with her at  once, and if he would drive her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cutler, though a bit uncertainly, &ldquo;no; I think  I won&rsquo;t go, Doris. You have Hardy yet, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s to stay his month out,&mdash;several days longer. But  I wish you&rsquo;d go, Looly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, but I won&rsquo;t drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Tell Miss Luella I&rsquo;ll be there in half an  hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lazybones!&rdquo; said Doris to herself, as she went to dress  for the trip. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be such a nice boy if he had a reasonable amount of energy.  I never saw such a Doddy Doolittle! If he weren&rsquo;t so attractive and  entertaining mentally, I&rsquo;d throw him over for good. But I like to talk to him,  and he is good help in this investigating business. I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s going to-day,  even if he won&rsquo;t drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trip was a lovely one. Fine roads, pleasant weather  and congenial company made the time fly, and soon they were at the shop  designated by Abby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said the antique dealer, &ldquo;I had that picture  you tell of. I sold it about a year ago. Lemme see now, I sold that&mdash;now, who <i>did</i> I sell it to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris waited breathlessly, and Miss Cutler fairly hung on  his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you look it up in your ledger?&rdquo; suggested Looly,  and the man finally did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I sold that picture of the  weeping willow and the weeping lady to Mrs. Fenn of Fenn Farm. That&rsquo;s only a  few miles along the East road, why don&rsquo;t you go there and see her, if you&rsquo;re so  keen about it. Like&rsquo;s not she&rsquo;d let you have it for just what she paid for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see it&rsquo;s a sort of a family relic,&rdquo; and Doris shed  one of her prettiest smiles broadcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you folks go ask Mrs. Fenn, like&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;ll get  it,&mdash;see it, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Off they started, and by good chance found the lady at  home. She was kindly, and quite willing to listen to their plea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did have it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I bought it because I thought  it was an interesting old thing. But my husband said it was a fright, and he  wouldn&rsquo;t have it around. So we put it up in the attic, and, let me see,&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t  more than a month ago, I gave it to some people for a rummage sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and Doris looked so woefully disappointed that Mrs.  Fenn tried to help further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might go to see the rummage sale ladies,&mdash; or, no,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll  telephone. Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A telephone conversation brought the joyful news that the  rummage sale people had sold it to a Mrs. Blake, whose home was some distance  off in another direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telephone her,&rdquo; said Looly, &ldquo;and see if she still has  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Blake lady had no telephone, and so the indomitable  Doris decreed that they must go there forthwith.</p>
<p>Thanking Mrs. Fenn for her assistance, they started off on  their new trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor, dear Miss Luella,&rdquo; cried Doris,  conscience-stricken, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s long after lunch time, and you&rsquo;ve had nothing since  breakfast! We&rsquo;ll go home, and look up the Blake farm to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; remonstrated Miss Cutler, &ldquo;let us get some  crackers at a grocer&rsquo;s and then probably Mrs. Blake will give us some milk, and  that will do nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old sport!&rdquo; cried Looly, giving his aunt an  approving glance, and the programme was carried out.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blake turned out to be a plain and unadorned farmer&rsquo;s  wife, and her welcome was not enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatcha want?&rdquo; she asked curtly, as the smart little car  stopped at her porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see you,&rdquo; said Doris, trying the disarming qualities  of one of her ingratiating smiles.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t prove successful, for the sour-faced woman  looked even more forbidding as she said, &ldquo;Whatcha wanta see me fur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get right down to brass tacks,&rdquo; said Looly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  just this, Mrs. Blake. We heard you bought a picture at the rummage sale,&mdash;a  picture of a lady standing by a willow tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what uv I did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this: We particularly want that picture, and we  thought you might be willing to sell it for what you paid, or a trifle more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! I dunno as I care to sell that ere picksher. It&rsquo;s  not so cheerful as it might be, but it&rsquo;s a vallyble old thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know? Not all those so-called antiques are  genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one is. You kin tell by the frame, an&rsquo; all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you let us see it?&rdquo; asked Miss Luella, so gently  that Mrs. Blake turned to look at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re reel nice-spoken,&rdquo; she said, appraisingly. &ldquo;These  young folks, now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accept the reproof, Mrs. Blake,&rdquo; and Doris smiled  apologetically. &ldquo;Our generation has much to learn from the older one. If you&rsquo;ll  let us see your picture, I&rsquo;ll promise to do better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile won, and with a grunt of discomfort, the old  woman turned and went into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out,&rdquo; said Looly. &ldquo;I perceive a long argument  ahead. But some way or another we must get the &lsquo;willow picture,&rsquo; now that we  have it almost within our grasp. Don&rsquo;t appear <i>too</i> anxious for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all stood on the porch when Mrs. Blake returned with  the old picture. It was a sorry-looking affair, but faded and stained though it  was, it was undoubtedly the thing they were in search of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo; exclaimed Looly, contemptuously, giving it  one glance and then turning away indifferently.</p>
<p>Doris took the cue with her usual quickness of perception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t attractive, is it?&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;I thank you for  troubling to bring it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you wanted to buy it!&rdquo; and Mrs. Blake looked  disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That</i> old  thing!&rdquo; Looly gave it another scornful glance. &ldquo;Now, you don&rsquo;t admire it  yourself, do you, Mrs. Blake? Honestly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; I admire it, but it&rsquo;s vallyble because it&rsquo;s  so old. It&rsquo;s &rsquo;most a hundred years old, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be,&rdquo; said Looly, turning on his heel.</p>
<p>Miss Cutler spoke up then. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s more  than a hundred, Mrs. Blake. But even so, as a picture I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s of any  great value. You can see it&rsquo;s amateur work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was clear enough. The scene was painted on canvas,  and was beyond all doubt the work of a young and inexperienced hand. The willow  tree was merely a green daub, faded and discoloured by time. The weeping lady  was mostly hidden by the tombstone over which she leant, and her face was  entirely concealed by her voluminous and belaced handkerchief. The tombstone  itself was the high light of the composition, and it loomed whitely in the  foreground, bearing an indication of an inscription doubtless meant to set  forth the virtues of the deceased relict.</p>
<p>On the whole it was a fright, but Doris yearned for its  possession as she had never longed for anything before.</p>
<p>Miss Luella, too, was anxious to acquire it, but her  honesty would not let her misrepresent its worth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a picture, I believe it is worthless,&rdquo; Miss Luella  said, in that high bred way of hers, which precluded all idea of insincerity. &ldquo;But  it is of interest to me because of family associations; so I wish you would  sell it, unless you are specially attached to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t that so much, but it jest fills a space over my  mantelpiece,&mdash;between the crayons of me&rsquo;n my husband. And somehow, it seemed to  sorta fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have a sorta fit, if she keeps on!&rdquo; Looly  confided to Doris in an aside.</p>
<p>But Miss Luella listened courteously. Then she said, &ldquo;Let  me see the place over the mantel, mayn&rsquo;t I? I think I have a picture at home  just about this size, and it would go nicely with your crayon portraits. It&rsquo;s a  picture of five angel heads,&mdash;beautiful ones, by a great artist. It&rsquo;s a good  photograph of the original, and I think angel faces are a great deal pleasanter  to look at than a cemetery scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they be! I should admire to see that picture you speak  of. I&rsquo;d consider a trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make that bargain, and pay you something besides,  said Miss Cutler. &ldquo;But perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t care for my picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should, I seen that onct, at a store in town. All  five heads with little wings, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all looking up, and they seem to be singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember. Is your picture framed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a plain, flat frame of polished wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruther have gilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not on a photograph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This here&rsquo;s a gilt frame; s&rsquo;pose I keep the frame and let  you have the picture. I&rsquo;m free to confess I don&rsquo;t hanker after that weepin&rsquo;  woman. But the frame&rsquo;s a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; spoke up Doris, who wanted the old  heirloom complete as it was. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a very good frame; see, it&rsquo;s nicked  and marred,&mdash;but if you&rsquo;ll agree, I&rsquo;ll get you a gilt frame for the angel  picture, that&rsquo;s nice and new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Doris, a gold frame on a sepia photograph!&rdquo; and Miss  Cutler shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and Doris nodded hers, &ldquo;if Mrs. Blake prefers it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do. Every one to their likin&rsquo; you know, and I&rsquo;ve a  strong leanin&rsquo; towards a gold frame. Will you promise it, Miss? and I&rsquo;ll let  you take this picture along with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll promise,&rdquo; said Doris, eagerly. &ldquo;Let us take  this, and I&rsquo;ll bring you the other to-morrow,&mdash;or just as soon as I can get the  frame to fit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trust you, for I see you&rsquo;re a lady. I dunno why you  set such store by this old thing, but if it&rsquo;s a family piece, that&rsquo;s different.  Any of your kin, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Miss Culter, who had been addressed, &ldquo;but  it was in an old house where some of my ancestors used to visit, I believe. Any  way, it is for family reasons that I am interested. And I shall pay you  something extra, because you may feel that a painting is more valuable than a  photograph,&mdash;or somebody may tell you that I had the best of the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slipped a bill into the hand of the farmer&rsquo;s wife, and  then Mrs. Blake was more than willing that the willow picture should be placed  in the motor.</p>
<p>Good-byes were said, and in a moment they were off with  their prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; cried Looly, &ldquo;success has crowned our efforts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to Miss Luella,&rdquo; added Doris. &ldquo;We hadn&rsquo;t enough  tact, or at least, not the right kind to get it, Looly. We never could have  wheedled it from the old woman if Miss Luella hadn&rsquo;t chipped in with her angel  heads. I never should have thought of such a scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasant idea, that, to have a cemetery or a few angels  hung between the family portraits!&rdquo; observed Looly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasant idea to have the family portraits in crayon!&rdquo;  said Doris. &ldquo;Ever see those things? Crayon enlargements of photographs, you  know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; and Miss Cutler laughed. &ldquo;They are next to the  worst pictures in the world. But the very worst is the one you&rsquo;re holding so  affectionately, Doris, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll admit it&rsquo;s the worst art, if you like,  but it&rsquo;s our <i>ne plus ultra, sine qua non,  e pluribus unum, Erin go bragh!</i> all the same!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is,&rdquo; put in Looly, &ldquo;being interpreted, <i>Veni, vidi, vici!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did, indeed!&rdquo; agreed Doris; &ldquo;and now for home, and a  feast of fat things to keep us from actual starvation and also to celebrate our  success. I invite you all to dinner, and we&rsquo;ll call in Mr. Stanchley, and then  we&rsquo;ll proceed to investigate our precious find. But first, we must stop and  order that gold frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conclave in the library after dinner was a serious  one. An unspoken hope was in each mind that somehow the picture might disclose  the hiding place of the Cutler pearls, that Doris might thereby win the reward  and perhaps be thus enabled to keep her home. No word of this had been said,  but as they examined the old painting, each scanned it eagerly for some hint or  suggestion of a hidden message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any pearls, Doris,&rdquo; said Mr. Stanchley, at  last, when they had all exclaimed at the picture&rsquo;s hideousness, and wondered  how any one could have painted such a lugubrious subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Stanchion, but there <i>must</i> be some directions somewhere about the thing. It&rsquo;s the willow  picture, &mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe there were two in the house,&mdash;and so it <i>must</i> be the one the poor dear soldier  boy referred to. Now, don&rsquo;t give up too easily. Think how long it took to  discover what was meant by the &lsquo;family plate,&rsquo; but little Smarty-cat Doris  ferreted it out! Didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did, and very cleverly, too. Go ahead with this  riddle,&mdash;and tell me when you find the answer.&rdquo; Mr. Stanchley turned away and  began looking over the old papers they had found, while Doris and Looly continued to study the picture of the tombstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be a sort of an enigma or puzzle picture,&rdquo;  suggested Miss Luella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that, I think,&rdquo; said Doris, &ldquo;for you know it wasn&rsquo;t <i>painted</i> as a description of the hiding  place. When the man said in his written message, &lsquo;the pearls are in the keeping  of the lady under the willow tree,&rsquo; or something like that, I think he wrote or  scratched or made some mark on this picture to say where they are hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me he took a roundabout way of disclosing his  secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he hoped to come back and find the pearls himself,&rdquo;  returned Doris; &ldquo;he only left this note in case he <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> come back. And, then, when he found he was dying, he tried  to tell about it. Oh, he is my ideal of a hero! He got out and got busy! <i>He</i> didn&rsquo;t sit around everlastingly doing  nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning any reference to allusions, or hints of  implication of anybody?&rdquo; and Looly smiled at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oh</i>, no!&rdquo; said  Doris, with exaggerated emphasis. &ldquo;Oh, <i>no</i>,  of course not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Doris,&rdquo; and Cutler&rsquo;s busy fingers felt along  the back of the frame. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a little groove hollowed out. Could he have put  a note in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, Looly! The poor man must have spent the whole  night writing notes! Anyway, there&rsquo;s no note there now. Did he put the pearls  there? It&rsquo;s quite a long groove!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as you so wisely observe, if he did, they&rsquo;re not  there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any hope, Doris,&rdquo; and Stanchley came to them,  and looked sceptically at the picture and its frame, so empty of possibilities.  There was no back board, merely the old canvas on its wooden stretcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s no hope anywhere,&rdquo; and Doris bravely forced  a smile that she trusted would steady her quivering lips, but it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And long after her guests had gone, the girl sat by her  favourite window, tears in her eyes, her heart sad and hopeless, but her soul  in arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must find a way out!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I <i>must!</i> I cannot give up Collander! I will  not!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Doris&rsquo; Discovery</b></h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, Doris,&rdquo; said Stanchley, a few days later,  &ldquo;whether it wouldn&rsquo;t be to your best interests to let Hawkins take over this  place, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Stanchion,&mdash;you know what he&rsquo;d do with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my girl; but whoever buys it will probably sell it  to Hawkins later, for that man is determined to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as determined as I am that he shan&rsquo;t get it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he can carry out his determination, and&mdash; forgive  me,&mdash;you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Doris was pathetically quiet. &ldquo;My last hope of  the pearls is gone, for now we&rsquo;ve found the family plate and the willow  picture,&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing left to look for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you see, Hawkins will get the house sooner or later,  unless we can find a buyer who will promise to keep it,&mdash;and that&rsquo;s not easy to  do in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I suppose not,&mdash;but, oh, Stanchion, don&rsquo;t you see how  I feel about it? Don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s going to just about kill me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Doris, not that. I do know how you shrink from the  idea of this house you love so being turned into a public place, a rendezvous  for motor parties and all that. But, you&rsquo;re no worse off than before you had  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I am! Why, then, I didn&rsquo;t <i>know</i> anything about it, I didn&rsquo;t know what it all <i>meant</i>,&mdash; never mind, Mr. Stanchley, you  can&rsquo;t understand. Now, what am I going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the best plan is to go to Mrs. Busby&rsquo;s for a  time. Though of course, you can stay here a week or so, if you like. Take time  to get your things together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;let Mr. Hawkins take the house at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. He makes a most generous offer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t bear it!&rdquo; and Doris broke down  utterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there,&mdash;bless my soul, Doris! Don&rsquo;t cry like that!  Let&rsquo;s talk of something else! By the way, have I told you. I think we&rsquo;ve found  an explanation for your ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? The French soldier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I knew it wasn&rsquo;t any phantom, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I didn&rsquo;t think it could be, but it was&mdash;it certainly  was very weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether to tell you or not,&mdash; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, of course! Why wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I daresay you ought to know. Well, it was Len  Hawkins himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I thought of that. But it didn&rsquo;t seem like a  real, live person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he did it very well. You see, Madame Marshall helped  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were accomplices!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They and one or two others have combined in an  effort to get this house,&mdash;and Hawkins thought that he could scare you out by a  phantom visitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! Scare me out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he planned that performance. Madame Marshall left the  side door open for him to come in, and she relocked it, before you got around  to it afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever bunch! But it was such a ghostly looking thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was draped in a sort of thin veil, a big, full  arrangement, and it was daubed with a stuff they call luminous paint, that  shines in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see! And he stooped down, and then seemed to rise  out of the ground, and stalk along the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Mrs. Marshall knew just when he was coming, and she  went and alarmed you. The rest was easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she was so seemingly scared herself she rather scared  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, she did. She meant to. Well, they hoped you&rsquo;d  be so frightened you wouldn&rsquo;t live in this house another day, and then they  could get it. They&rsquo;ve had their eye on it ever since Mr. Hilton&rsquo;s death. And  after you improved it so, they wanted it more than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find out about the ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cutler did it. He&rsquo;s a clever chap, and he knew there was  somebody behind it all, so he investigated. And when you said that you not only  heard the raps on your door, but that, as you were leaning against it, you felt  the wood jarred, he knew it was a human agency. Immaterial spirits can&rsquo;t jar  inanimate objects, though voices or sounds may be imagined. So, here&rsquo;s how  clever that chap was. He surmised at once that Mrs. Marshall was involved, and  the day you and she were telling him about it,&mdash;the day after it happened, you  know,&mdash;he sent Judd over to me with a note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well this was the note. He said, &lsquo;Telephone Madame M. at  once, and simply say, in a low voice, &lsquo;How did it work?&rsquo; Get her reply, but say  nothing more.&rdquo; I did exactly as he said. Mrs. Marshall thought it was Hawkins,  and she replied, &lsquo;Fine. But don&rsquo;t talk now.&rsquo; Then she hung up quickly. That was  proof enough. So I taxed Hawkins with it, and though he wouldn&rsquo;t own up, his  confused manner gave him away. He&rsquo;ll never admit it, but I know he did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, he did! Oh, Mr. Stanchley, I won&rsquo;t let him  have this place! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;no, I won&rsquo;t set fire to it first, but I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set fire to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost! But this is foolish talk. I can meet misfortune,  I can be brave, but the thought of his owning this house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Marshall is as bad as he is. He tried to put the  blame entirely on her, saying she contrived the plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I. Hawkins told me that she was responsible for that  candle going out so strangely that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was! How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems she sneaked into your room and fixed the candle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She softened it so that she could draw the wick nearly  through, and then cut it off leaving only about an inch in the upper part of  the candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s an old trick. It&rsquo;s in the books of legerdemain  and conjuring I had when I was a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you suspect something of that sort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t. But I wasn&rsquo;t looking for  hocus-pocus,&mdash;until Looly put me up to it. He&rsquo;s a fine fellow, Doris, I wish you  wouldn&rsquo;t be so snippy toward him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind Looly. Tell me more about this Rachel Hilton  performance. Did Madame make those sepulchral sounds I heard, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she had a piece of rubber tubing, which she hung  down the chimney flue, from her room above, and she talked and groaned through  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I weren&rsquo;t so mad at her, I&rsquo;d have to admire her  ingenuity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it did no harm, as you&rsquo;re such a cool-headed  sensible girl, but if you had been of a really nervous temperament it might  have thrown you into spasms of fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it might! It pretty nearly did, as it was! And  that sly woman begged me to tell her all about it the next morning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wanted to know how it affected you. When she found  you were not much scared, she was disappointed. You see, then, there was no  thought of your sudden reverse of fortune, and they had to plan some desperate  way to get the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you know Hawkins came to me and insisted on buying  it. Mr. Stanchley, is there <i>no way</i> I  can keep it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see any. A mortgage isn&rsquo;t practicable, as you&rsquo;ve  no income. You can&rsquo;t go to work and earn enough to keep up such a place,  however in earnest you may be. You might appeal to the New York State Sons of  the Revolution&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I don&rsquo;t want charity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might marry a millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any handy by, and I wouldn&rsquo;t marry a man I  didn&rsquo;t love, even to save Collander!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. But I can&rsquo;t see any other way out. And  while I feel very sorry for you, my dear, you must remember you&rsquo;re a lucky girl  to have plenty of means after the house is sold. You will be able to live  nicely,&mdash;and your affection for this place is, after all, only sentiment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only sentiment!&rdquo; Doris rose, with flashing eyes. &ldquo;Well, I  suppose a practical old lawyer-person like you can&rsquo;t be expected to appreciate  or understand what sentiment means!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help! Don&rsquo;t annihilate me!&rdquo; and Stanchley laughed  at the scorn on Doris&rsquo; lovely face. &ldquo;Here comes somebody that may understand  better. I&rsquo;ll leave it to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hugh Stanchley hurried away, just as Looly Cutler came up  on the side porch and in at the library door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the dramatics?&rdquo; he asked, smiling at the tiptilted  head and the indignant flash in the dark eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Stanchion doesn&rsquo;t know sentiment from cabbages!&rdquo; said  Doris purposely loud enough for the departing lawyer to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do,&rdquo; and a sudden tender note came into Cutler&rsquo;s  voice. &ldquo;I know a lot about sentiment, and&mdash; Doris, dear,&mdash;sometime I&rsquo;d like to  tell you what I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His gentleness, after Stanchley&rsquo;s business-like attitude,  went straight to the girl&rsquo;s heart, and the tears came as she fell into a chair,  unstrung and exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Looly, I <i>am</i> so miserable! I can&rsquo;t see any way to turn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn to me, dear.&rdquo; Cutler came nearer and laid his hand  on her quivering shoulder. &ldquo;Little Doris, I love you, and I wish you could care  for me. Can&rsquo;t you,&mdash;just a little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cutler!&rdquo; Doris rose and faced him like a small fury,  &ldquo;you ought to be ashamed of yourself! You say that, only because you are sorry  for me! I don&rsquo;t care for pity, thank you! I wish you&rsquo;d go! I can fight my own  battles, rather than have a man offer to help me because he thinks I need  help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, kiddy, don&rsquo;t get wrathy! And you mistake my  meaning. I love you,&mdash;when you&rsquo;ll let me, I&rsquo;ll tell you how much&mdash;but I never  dared tell you when you were a great heiress and all that. Now, I offer you all  I have and all I am, and&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll only care a little bit&mdash;Doris, darling&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Looly! Please go away! No, I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s all there is about that. Now, let me help you  as a mere casual friend. What can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was so strong and cheery, so truly friendly,  that Doris looked up gratefully. Here was a friend she could rely on.</p>
<p>A faint noise in the living room attracted her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nobody in there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Springing to the door she threw it open just in time to  see a man climbing out of the window. In his arms he had the willow picture!</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300401h-images/page268.jpg" alt="page 268" width="656" height="750"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Looly, come! help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; said Cutler coming in from the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that Hawkins! and he has stolen the picture! We must  chase him&mdash;and catch him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, Doris. And the picture is of no great value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looly Cuder! I thought you wanted to <i>help</i> me! If you do,&mdash;fly after that man and get that picture back  for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let it go, Doris. And it would be useless to try to  catch him. See, he&rsquo;s in a motor. Somebody was waiting for him. There they go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough a motor car started, and at a rapidly  quickening pace whizzed out of sight up the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the worst I ever saw! If you can&rsquo;t do anything,  get out of my way and let <i>me!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris pushed past Cutler, ran out to the garage, and in an  incredible short space of time was flying, in her own little car, after the  thief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all good-for-nothing mollycoddles!&rdquo; she exclaimed to  herself, in wrath at Cutler&rsquo;s unwillingness to help her. &ldquo;Well, thank goodness,  I can run this thing myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She followed the route the other car had taken, and after  a time she caught sight of it,&mdash;a long, red sporting runabout, going at a pretty  good speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never can catch it,&rdquo; she despaired, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll have a  try at it. Maybe they&rsquo;ll have an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t, but she did. Going over an unnoticed stone,  the bump broke the glass of her windshield, and a large corner piece of it fell  shattered into her lap.</p>
<p>She made no pause, but avoiding the bits, she let her  laprobe slide down round her feet, carrying with it the broken glass. On she  flew, at the best speed she could command, and as often as she caught sight of  her quarry, they also forged ahead. Her radiator cap flew off, but she didn&rsquo;t  stop to recover it, she dashed on, till passing through a town she saw that the  other car had stopped to buy gasoline.</p>
<p>They had not seen her, then! Slowing down, she looked  about for a policeman, and seeing one, asked his aid.</p>
<p>The officer got in beside her, and they went to the other  car. Doris spoke to Hawkins, who still sat in it, his companion having gone  into the garage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me my picture, Mr. Hawkins,&rdquo; demanded Doris, &ldquo;or be  arrested for robbery. You ought to be jailed, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if it isn&rsquo;t Miss Ballard,&rdquo; and Hawkins laughed,  though a bit uncomfortably. &ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young lady wants that picture you have,&rdquo; interrupted  the arm of the law. &ldquo;She claims it is hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hawkins seemed about to deny this, then, looking at Doris&rsquo;  determined face, he said, &ldquo;Why, yes, it is hers. She asked me to take it to get  a new frame for it. It needs one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not telling the truth, officer,&rdquo; said Doris, calmly.  &ldquo;He stole that picture from my house, and got out of the window with it, less  than half an hour ago. I can produce a witness who saw him at the same time I  did. Arrest him, and I&rsquo;ll appear against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion of a witness startled Hawkins, and he said,  &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t steal the thing, but if the young lady has changed her mind and doesn&rsquo;t  want me to do her errand for her, she can take her picture back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris hesitated. To push the arrest might mean a lot of  trouble for her, and she felt she had trouble enough already. Would it not be  better to take the picture, and go back with it, and then put the matter in Mr.  Stanchley&rsquo;s hands for further adjustment? She thought so, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, we&rsquo;ll let it go that way. Make a note of the  matter, officer, and I&rsquo;ll take the picture now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hawkins looked disturbed at her words, but he handed over  the old canvas, and Doris put it carefully in her car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broke your glass,&rdquo; observed the policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I chased the intruder in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some heroine!&rdquo; and the big man looked at her admiringly.  &ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re satisfied, run along, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris &ldquo;ran along,&rdquo; and on her way home she thought more  deeply over Looly Cutler&rsquo;s defection than over the willow picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he dared to tell me he loved me!&rdquo; she mused, her face  growing pink at the recollection. &ldquo;And&mdash; and I would be glad&mdash;yes, <i>glad</i>,&mdash;if only he were a <i>man</i>, a man of energy,&mdash;&lsquo;stout of frame,  bold of heart and delighting in daring enterprises,&rsquo;&mdash;like old Jacob Van Tassel!  Huh! Looly would have been a nice warrior sachem! Fancy him attacking or even  defending anything or anybody! And yet&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t care if I <i>do</i> nearly, almost,&mdash;imagine I care for  him a tiny little speck,&mdash;it flies away entirely when I think how he acted  to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reached home, jumped out of the car, cutting her arm  on the broken glass of the windshield, and called Hardy to look after the  machine.</p>
<p>Then she ran in the house to find Looly still there. He  sat moodily by the library table, and looked up as she ran in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;small thanks to you! But I got it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris! you&rsquo;re hurt! What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. You can&rsquo;t help. Could you guard this picture,  while Molly fixes me up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With fine scorn she gave the old picture to him, and ran  out of the room.</p>
<p>The cut was not deep and she soon returned, fresh in a  spick and span white frock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it,&rdquo; she exclaimed, almost  forgetting her detestation of the man before her in her eagerness for an  audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see why he wanted the picture,&rdquo; Cutler mused,  staring at it, after hearing her tale. &ldquo;He must have thought of something we  haven&rsquo;t thought of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you think so! You&rsquo;re clever, Looly, do, <i>do</i> think of some new possibility. Do,  Looly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lovely face, alight with eagerness, the pleading brown  eyes, the pathetic white-bandaged forearm made Cutler&rsquo;s heart throb with a wild  desire to fulfil her wish. He frowned as he gazed at the old picture. Then,  without a word, he picked up a stout paper-knife, and drew the few loosened old  tacks that held the canvas in its frame.</p>
<p>Minutely he scanned it, around the edges, where the turned  over canvas was tacked to the stretcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris,&rdquo; he said, slowly, &ldquo;these tacks round the edge  here, have been pulled out and replaced. See what I mean. Across this end and  along this side, the tacks are not in their original holes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; and she too looked closely at the marks. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  sure, Looly. Does it mean anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not. But I want to take the canvas off the  stretcher and see. Will you give me a claw,&mdash; a tack-puller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris ran and got one, and returning, closed the door  carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Busy Bee is out there with Molly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let  her know what we&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cutler dug at the nails with the claw, but they were so  deeply rusted in that they resisted his efforts. The heads broke off or sank in  and then he could do nothing with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call Hardy,&mdash;will you, Doris? Or old Judd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; the brown eyes blazed angrily at him. &ldquo;You  ought to be ashamed of yourself,&mdash; you hate to raise a finger or make the least  exertion! I despise you! Now, either you draw those tacks yourself, or you give  me the picture and go home. I&rsquo;ll have it looked into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, why, what a little Xantippe! All right, since you  put it like that, I&rsquo;ll have a go at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing up, and leaning over the picture, Cutler exerted  all his strength, and finally, after a tedious and hard bit of work, he  loosened the canvas along three sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn it back yourself, Doris,&rdquo; he said, in a low tone. &ldquo;I  think there&rsquo;s something there. If there is, you must find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impressed by his grave tone, Doris took the picture, and  laid it face down on the table. The old canvas still clung in place, though the  tacks were out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick off the edges,&rdquo; directed Cutler, and Doris carefully  drew the canvas from the wooden stretcher. It stuck and tore, but Looly told  her to go ahead, and at last it was free all round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, turn the whole thing over, but carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris did so, and then at a nod from Cutler, she slowly  peeled the whole canvas free from the wood.</p>
<p>This disclosed a long narrow groove along one side of the  rectangular stretcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is! I know it is!&rdquo; whispered Doris, in a very agony of  excitement. &ldquo;Oh, <i>Looly!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady,&rdquo; he said, and his arm slipped round her, as she  lifted the crumbling bit of soft old paper that was stuffed into the groove in  the wood.</p>
<p>And with it came the string of Cutler pearls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris!&rdquo; Looly cried, with shining eyes. &ldquo;Oh, dear heart,  I <i>am</i> so glad!&rdquo; He stepped away a few  paces, and dropped into a chair, as if exhausted. But Doris was too excited to  notice him at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is!</i> They <i>are!</i>&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, perhaps the reward  and all will let me keep Collander! Oh, Looly, do you <i>think</i> so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Busby,  opening the door and coming in. &ldquo;Why, Doris Ballard! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cutler pearls!&rdquo; cried Doris. &ldquo;Come in, if you like.  Come in, Molly, Judd, all of you! I&rsquo;ve found them! I&rsquo;ve <i>found</i> them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Doris, heaven be praised!&rdquo; cried Molly, and the  girl flung her arms round the old woman&rsquo;s neck in ecstasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Looly?&rdquo; suddenly said Mrs. Busby,  &ldquo;he&rsquo;s fainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Cutler, but he spoke and looked  a bit queer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Doris. I&rsquo;m so glad and happy for you. But I&rsquo;ll go  home now,&mdash; will you come with me, Mrs. Busby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, lad, come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two went away, and Doris, still dazed at her  discovery, sat gloating over the jewels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must tell Miss Luella right away,&rdquo; she said, going to  the telephone. &ldquo;Looly will tell her, but I want to get her ear first.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  Doris Repeats Her Words</b></h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great secret, Doris, and I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you, only  I think you ought to <i>know</i>,&mdash;but you  mustn&rsquo;t breathe a <i>word</i> of it to <i>anybody!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Busybee Busby folded her handkerchief with unusual energy  and unfolded it with an extra jerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; queried Doris. &ldquo;I promise not to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she paid only indifferent heed to her caller, for she  was still quivering with delight over her great find of the morning. She had  the pearls safely under lock and key, until Miss Luella should come over to get  them, and the thought of the money reward gave her rapt visions of probably  being able to pay her bills and in some way manage to retain her home. She had  sent for Hugh Stanchley, but before he came, Mrs. Busby had come flying over  evidently agitated with news of importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen, Doris, this is <i>very</i> serious. In the first place,&mdash;Looly Cutler isn&rsquo;t Looly Cutler  at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? Who is he? An Italian dancing-master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself! He&rsquo;s Llewellyn  Prescott,&mdash;<i>that&rsquo;s</i> who he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marvellous, Holmes, marvellous! And who is Llewellyn  Prescott?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ignorant you are! I suppose that&rsquo;s because you lived  out West! But, even then, I should think you&rsquo;d have heard of Prescott! Why, he&rsquo;s  a well known athlete. He was the most famous stroke oar of his University. He&rsquo;s,&mdash;why,  his reputation is country-wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Mrs. Busby, don&rsquo;t tell me my friend, Looly  Marshmallow, is an athlete! That&rsquo;s a little too much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is! and he&rsquo;s been very ill, and he&rsquo;s very ill  now,&mdash;and it&rsquo;s all your fault!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>are</i> you  talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the secret. You see, Looly is an inspector of  ordnance in a big munitions plant over in New Jersey, and also, a  representative of the Secret Service. Well, a couple of months ago, he keeled over  with TNT, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world is TNT?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember the exact words, it&rsquo;s something like  trini-tro-toluol,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind the exact name, it&rsquo;s a fearful kind of  poisoning that people get in the munition factories. And it&rsquo;s liable to be  fatal, and it gets into the skin when they don&rsquo;t know it, and the effect is  terrific! Looly was in the hospital a month, and then he came here to get over  it, and he only used two of his names, because of the Secret Service, and too,  because, he says, he didn&rsquo;t want all my people fussing over him. His aunt knew,  but nobody else. His name is Llewellyn Cutler Prescott, so he just used the  first two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you say I had anything to do with his getting  poisoned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. But while he&rsquo;s recuperating, the doctors  forbade him to take any vigorous exercise, and made him promise to do just  absolutely <i>nothing</i> for a few weeks.  So, he didn&rsquo;t want everybody to know he was the celebrated athlete. He didn&rsquo;t  care <i>what</i> people thought of him,&mdash;he&rsquo;s  been so busy studying, and attending to a lot of secret service correspondence,  and, oh, Lord knows what all! Then he fell in with you, and&mdash;oh, well,&mdash;I guess  you know what he thinks of <i>you!</i> And  when you scorned his laziness,&mdash;and teased him about doing nothing, he just  chuckled and let you misjudge him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silly thing! Why didn&rsquo;t he tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s queer that way, Looly is. And, too, if he told  you, the secret would have come out, most likely. Well, he was getting along  fine, and then, you see, this morning he over-exerted himself pulling those old  rusty nails, and now, he&rsquo;s awful sick! He&rsquo;s had a doctor up from New York, and  there&rsquo;s two trained nurses lookin&rsquo; after him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really! Oh, Mrs. Busby, I&rsquo;m so sorry! But how was I to  know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Doris, I don&rsquo;t blame you. I know it did seem &rsquo;s  if he was a milksop. I felt that way about it myself. And I guess he&rsquo;ll pull  through, all right. But it&rsquo;s a relapse, and you never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why he wouldn&rsquo;t drive a car, or&mdash;or climb a  step-ladder&mdash;or anything! And I was so mad when he let me chip ice one day  instead of doing it himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t. You see, the poison breaks out all over his  chest and shoulders and arms, and if he uses those muscles it makes it worse  right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Looly! I&rsquo;m so sorry. Can I see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, no! The nurses won&rsquo;t even let his aunt go in  the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he so very ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno, but they won&rsquo;t let him move; and he needs  absolute quiet and freedom from all excitement. Lemme see them pearls, won&rsquo;t  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris locked the door, and then showed Mrs. Busby the old  necklace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, my!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;to think o&rsquo; them bein&rsquo;  buried,&mdash;as you may say,&mdash;in that picture, all these years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful! I can hardly believe it yet. See, the  man must have taken the canvas off of one side, hollowed out a groove to hold  them, and then tacked the canvas back in place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had to take it off two sides to get at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and part of a third side. It was the replaced nails  and the empty nail holes that made Looly think of looking under the canvas. You  know <i>he</i> found the pearls, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you rescued the picture! I guess you did more  toward the findin&rsquo; than what he did. The feller that hid &rsquo;em musta had plenty  of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking it over, and I imagine he was here all  night,&mdash;as a guard or an aid, you know. And as he had the pearls to hide, he  made a good and careful job of it. As you say, it took time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you clever at figgerin&rsquo; it out! But it must be jest  as you say, for there&rsquo;s the pearls. I don&rsquo;t think so much of &rsquo;em after all,&mdash;except  for their antiqueness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not very large, nor very perfectly matched, and  the ruby clasp is but a tiny stone. But that doesn&rsquo;t matter, they&rsquo;re the Cutler  pearls, all right, and if I am entitled to the reward, I think,&mdash; I hope I can  stay here! Oh, Mrs. Busby, if I only can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear child. I hope so, I&rsquo;m sure. Here comes Mr.  Stanchley to see you,&mdash;I&rsquo;d better make myself scarce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Doris,&rdquo; and the lawyer came in as his landlady went  out, &ldquo;your lucky star is in the ascendant! I&rsquo;ve had word from Mr. Lovell, and  he&rsquo;s going to save something out of the wreck, after all. If you&rsquo;ve really  found the Cutler pearls, too, you&rsquo;ll be just about all right financially, and I  see no reason why you can&rsquo;t keep your beloved Collander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too good to be true!&rdquo; and Doris grasped Stanchley&rsquo;s  hand and shook it vigorously up and down, in sheer joy. &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t seen  the pearls, look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held up the old necklace, and he examined it  curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well! It isn&rsquo;t much to look at, but it&rsquo;s valuable  all the same. The Cutler people will be glad to pay you the reward, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Miss Luella have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; the present head of the family, a man in Boston, will  probably claim it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I don&rsquo;t care, so long as I get the prize  money. It&rsquo;s honestly mine, isn&rsquo;t it, Stanchion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Looly thought of looking in the wood part of the  picture. I never should have thought of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have thought of it later; and anyway, you got  the picture by your own efforts,&mdash;and desperate efforts, too! Why, <i>you</i> ferreted out the idea of the family  plate being a bookplate. You thought of this willow picture, after reading the  note you found. You hunted it down when it was lost in obscurity, and then,  after all that, you rushed off and rescued it when it was stolen from you! I  should say you had a right to the find!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how I have misjudged Looly! I thought he was a  mollycoddle and a slacker, and all the time he was serving his country in ways  I never dreamed of,&mdash;and had suffered more than a wounded soldier, and never  peeped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Llewellyn Prescott is a big man. A splendid chap, but  no martyr. He let you think him a mollycoddle because you piqued him to it. He  was amused at your scorn of him because he knew his own powers. And, too, he  did want to keep his identity secret for several reasons. And you mustn&rsquo;t tell,  Doris. For a time yet, he wants to preserve his incognito.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to get well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord, yes. Unless a bad relapse sets in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it&mdash;did it hurt him very much&mdash;pulling those nails?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, they were very old and rusted, and the  strain on the pectoral muscles was just what he had been ordered to avoid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I made him do it! He wanted me to call Judd or Hardy,  but I wouldn&rsquo;t. I was ashamed of his indolence and I made him do the work  himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was his own fault. He should have told you that he  was under doctors&rsquo; orders. Don&rsquo;t blame yourself, at all, Doris; he was  foolishly obstinate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He misled me all along. I thought he was a lazybones who  just sat around and wrote poetry. He does write awfully good verse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, but he never does it when he&rsquo;s got any real  work to do. Cutler has a poet mind, but he has a very strong and muscular body,  and after he gets it back to normal conditions, you won&rsquo;t call him milksop, I  can assure you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take care of these pearls, Guardy? I don&rsquo;t want  the responsibility. And, too, I expect that old Hawkins will make another try  for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve settled <i>him</i> for good and all. I had an interview with him that made him feel  the farther away from Dobbs Ferry he spends the rest of his life, the better  for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Madame Marshall, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about her. She may pester you further. She  declares Hawkins put her up to all the mischief she did, and he vows all he did  was at her instigation. I daresay it was six of one and half a dozen of the  other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too. They worked together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there were two more. Ermyntrude Whiting and her  brother were in the game, and the four of them were determined to get this  place in their possession and make money out of it. After they found how you  had improved it, they were more anxious than ever to get it, and they planned  to play ghosts until you were actually driven out by fright! Then you lost your  money, they jumped for joy, and began to gather together their resources to buy  the place at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were ready to sell it to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Doris, because it seemed the only thing to do. I had  looked the market over, and there was little hope of selling immediately to any  one who would promise to keep it. And if they bought from another purchaser, it  seemed as well that they should buy directly from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Stanchion, that&rsquo;s all true. But I don&rsquo;t want to  think about that. I just want to rejoice that all&rsquo;s well with my world, now. It  is,&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it? There&rsquo;s no reason now, that I can&rsquo;t keep Collander?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of any. I telephoned the Cutler  representatives in Boston, and they&rsquo;re quite ready to pay the reward for the  pearls as soon as they are convinced of the genuineness of the find. And as  that is beyond all question, you&rsquo;re sure of the money. Then, from what Mr.  Lovell writes me, I feel certain you&rsquo;ll have enough income, with reasonable  economy, to run this house about as you&rsquo;ve been doing. I think a housekeeper or  companion&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Guardy, I&rsquo;m going to get one. I&rsquo;m going to have a  lovely lady that Miss Cutler knows, and I&rsquo;ll economise all that&rsquo;s necessary,  and, oh, I&rsquo;ll be <i>so</i> happy that I can  stay here, I don&rsquo;t care for any conditions or deprivations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be deprived of anything greatly conducive to  your comfort, and I <i>am</i> glad, Doris,  dear, that you can stay. It&rsquo;s all very wonderful, I think, and it&rsquo;s no more  than you deserve after your good work on the house and your persevering search  for the treasure. You&rsquo;re a girl in a thousand, my child, and I congratulate you  on your well-earned reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few well-chosen words!&rdquo; said Doris, laughing. &ldquo;I  feel as if I were a flag-raising or whatever they make speeches at. And another  thing, Stanchy, I never want to see Looly Cutler,&mdash;or Prescott,&mdash;again! I needn&rsquo;t,  need I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to. I misjudged him so, and I was horrid to  him. He&rsquo;ll never forgive me, or if he does, it&rsquo;ll be just to save my feelings.  He won&rsquo;t stay here much longer, will he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; only till he&rsquo;s able to go away. But, that may be some  time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care how long it is. I needn&rsquo;t see him. I can&rsquo;t  explain it exactly,&mdash;but I just want to forget him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After he helped you so much in your search?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t  exactly helping me, he was hunting on his own account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Doris, it wouldn&rsquo;t be kind,&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t be  decent-mannered,&mdash;to refuse to see him again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, I don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to, and I <i>won&rsquo;t!</i> So there, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris, you&rsquo;re a little goose! But it&rsquo;s none of my affair.  You can do as you like, I suppose. Now, shall I take these pearls away with  me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please; I don&rsquo;t want the responsibility of their  safety. You can show them to Miss Luella, and then keep them till the Boston  people come for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stanchley went away, and Doris drew a long breath and went  upstairs to her favourite window in Washington&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I can <i>live</i>,&rdquo;  she said to herself, with a deep sigh of thankfulness. Oh, Collander, my dear, <i>dear</i> Collander, I can live here with  you! I feel now, as Washington did when he came back here, in 1783, and met  Carleton to arrange for the evacuation of New York by the enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had conquered, he was victorious, just as I am now!  But I feel a sort of still, quiet gladness, too deep for any rejoicing. Come  here, Peter,&rdquo; for her faithful shadow had followed her, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you glad that  we&rsquo;re to stay here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The collie waved his tail with due solemnity, and his  great soft eyes looked intelligently into the brown ones that questioned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re going to do our best, Peter, to be worthy of the  house and its traditions, and we&rsquo;re going to live up to the brave memories and  influences just as far as we can,&mdash;aren&rsquo;t we, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With her arm round Peter&rsquo;s neck, Doris staid kneeling by  the window a long time. Her thoughts were disconnected and wandering, but  filled with the peace of possession and the knowledge that her home was safe.</p>
<p>The shadows lengthened toward sunset, and with a tranquil  joy, Doris looked down on her lawn, her garden, her trees,&mdash;all her loved  domain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to have a harsh or unkind thought in my  heart,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;not even toward Mr. Hawkins&mdash;or,&mdash;or Looly Cutler,&mdash;Prescott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I <i>am</i> mad at  him for deceiving me and making fun of me! I&rsquo;ll never forgive him&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want  to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I do want to,&mdash;and he did say he&mdash;but I know  he said that only because he was sorry for me. He needn&rsquo;t be sorry for me now!  But&mdash;I suppose I ought to thank him&mdash;I oughtn&rsquo;t to let the sun go down upon my  wrath,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting on a sudden impulse, Doris ran downstairs, and  outdoors and along the road to Mrs. Busby&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Several times she turned back, then after an instant&rsquo;s  hesitation, went on again.</p>
<p>Reaching the boarding house, she slipped in at the side  door, and found the nurse who was not then on duty.</p>
<p>A few whispered words ensued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, he isn&rsquo;t so very ill,&rdquo; the nurse assured her, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s  worrying about some business matters, that&rsquo;s what makes him feverish. He wants  somebody to do something for him, in connection with some government work, and  he can&rsquo;t think who is the best one to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I do?&rdquo; and Doris&rsquo; big brown eyes grew very earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I think he wants a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But mayn&rsquo;t I see him,&mdash;just for a minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&mdash;so far as I&rsquo;m concerned. But the doctor&rsquo;s  orders are against it; and the other nurse,&mdash; well,&mdash;she&rsquo;s the strictest I ever  saw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But listen; what time do <i>you</i> go on duty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right away now. I&rsquo;m just going to get into my uniform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was more whispered consultation, and the two  girls nodded and talked eagerly.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, a white clad figure softly went into  the darkened sick-room, where Looly Cutler lay, silent and immobile as any  marble figure.</p>
<p>The nurse who was leaving, spoke absently. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s  all right; the chart&rsquo;s filled up to now. I&rsquo;ll send up his supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Davis,&rdquo; said the newcomer,&mdash;which was what Miss  Merwin always said.</p>
<p>Miss Davis went out softly, and the other nurse approached  the bed.</p>
<p>The closed eyes did not open, the still figure did not  move; but the patient&rsquo;s mouth twitched at the corners and he said in a whisper,  &ldquo;Hello, Doris.&rdquo; The white-clad figure jumped, and in a panic, started to leave  the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there,&rdquo; said the patient, distinctly, &ldquo;you come  back! If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll thrash around and get all fussed up again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Looly,&rdquo; and Doris was genuinely distressed, &ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t  to have done this! I just wanted to see for myself how sick you were, and see  if I could tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sick at all, and you can tell me <i>anything</i>. You&rsquo;re a little brick to do  this, and Miss Merwin is another, to let you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know it was me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew your voice. Miss Davis was so absorbed in that  precious chart, she didn&rsquo;t notice. You spoke just as Miss Merwin always does,&mdash;I  suppose she told you to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Doris was still frightened, but mischievously  enjoying the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looly, listen, you mustn&rsquo;t talk or move, I know, but if  you want a message sent, mayn&rsquo;t I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to &lsquo;carry a message to Garcia&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you want to send one. Not another word now,&mdash;but  when you get ready to send it, let me look after it, mayn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear child! You&rsquo;re the very one. I&rsquo;ll be up to it  to-morrow,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, now I must scoot. I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re as well  as you are, and&mdash;Looly,&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry I teased you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ter-bul sorry,&rdquo; the laughing voice had a tender note  in it, and the gloom of the room was not so deep but that the sweet, wistful  face was visible beneath the nurse&rsquo;s cap that sat so lightly on the red-gold  hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that <i>all</i> you&rsquo;ve  got to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I want to thank you for helping me find the pearls.  But that will keep till you&rsquo;re better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>that</i> will.  But now, before you go, I want you to do one thing for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to say something. Come here; I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t  move, but you can put your head down, so I can tell you. Listen. The day I  first met you, you said something, and I told you then that some day you should  say that to me, with a different intonation. Do you remember what it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell a story, now! Do you remember,&mdash; little Doris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember the words <i>exactly?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll ask a question, and you say those words  in reply, with the intonation I want. Doris, little sweetheart, you are all the  world to me. What am I to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lower drooped the lovely, blushing face, and the scarlet  lips almost brushed his ear as Doris breathed the words,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly <i>darling!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she ran out of the room.</p>
