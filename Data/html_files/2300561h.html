<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Dedication"></a>Dedication<br>
  To A Mountain</b></h2>
<p>To thee, O father of the stately peaks, <br>
  Above me in the loftier light &mdash; to thee, <br>
  Imperial brother of those awful hills <br>
  Whose feet are set in splendid spheres of flame, <br>
  Whose heads are where the gods are, and whose sides <br>
  Of strength are belted round with all the zones <br>
  Of all the world, I dedicate these songs. <br>
  And if, within the compass of this book, <br>
  There lives and glows <i>one</i> verse in which there beats <br>
  The pulse of wind and torrent &mdash; if <i>one</i> line <br>
  Is here that like a running water sounds, <br>
  And seems an echo from the lands of leaf, <br>
  Be sure that line is thine. Here, in this home, <br>
  Away from men and books and all the schools, <br>
  I take thee for my Teacher. In thy voice <br>
  Of deathless majesty, I, kneeling, hear <br>
  God&rsquo;s grand authentic Gospel! Year by year, <br>
  The great sublime cantata of thy storm <br>
  Strikes through my spirit &mdash; fills it with a life <br>
  Of startling beauty! Thou my Bible art, <br>
  With holy leaves of rock, and flower, and tree, <br>
  And moss, and shining runnel. From each page <br>
  That helps to make thy awful volume, I <br>
  Have learned a noble lesson. In the psalm <br>
  Of thy grave winds, and in the liturgy <br>
  Of singing waters, lo! my soul has heard <br>
  The higher worship; and from thee, indeed, <br>
  The broad foundations of a finer hope <br>
  Were gathered in; and thou hast lifted up <br>
  The blind horizon for a larger faith! <br>
  Moreover, walking in exalted woods <br>
  Of naked glory, in the green and gold <br>
  Of forest sunshine, I have paused like one <br>
  With all the life transfigured; and a flood <br>
  Of light ineffable has made me feel <br>
  As felt the grand old prophets caught away <br>
  By flames of inspiration; but the words <br>
  Sufficient for the story of my Dream <br>
  Are far too splendid for poor human lips. <br>
  But thou, to whom I turn with reverent eyes &mdash; <br>
  O stately Father, whose majestic face <br>
  Shines far above the zone of wind and cloud, <br>
  Where high dominion of the morning is &mdash; <br>
  Thou hast the Song complete of which my songs <br>
  Are pallid adumbrations! Certain sounds <br>
  Of strong authentic sorrow in this book <br>
  May have the sob of upland torrents &mdash; these, <br>
  And only these, may touch the great World&rsquo;s heart; <br>
  For, lo! they are the issues of that grief <br>
  Which makes a man more human, and his life <br>
  More like that frank, exalted life of thine. <br>
  But in these pages there are other tones <br>
  In which thy large, superior voice is not &mdash; <br>
  Through which no beauty that resembles thine <br>
  Has ever shone. <i>These</i> are the broken words <br>
  Of blind occasions, when the World has come <br>
  Between me and my Dream. No song is here <br>
  Of mighty compass; for my singing robes <br>
  I&rsquo;ve worn in stolen moments. All my days <br>
  Have been the days of a laborious life, <br>
  And ever on my struggling soul has burned <br>
  The fierce heat of this hurried sphere. But thou, <br>
  To whose fair majesty I dedicate <br>
  My book of rhymes &mdash; thou hast the perfect rest <br>
  Which makes the heaven of the highest gods! <br>
  To thee the noises of this violent time <br>
  Are far, faint whispers; and, from age to age, <br>
  Within the world and yet apart from it, <br>
  Thou standest! Round thy lordly capes the sea <br>
  Rolls on with a superb indifference <br>
  For ever; in thy deep, green, gracious glens <br>
  The silver fountains sing for ever. Far <br>
  Above dim ghosts of waters in the caves, <br>
  The royal robe of morning on thy head <br>
  Abides for ever. Evermore the wind <br>
  Is thy august companion; and thy peers <br>
  Are cloud, and thunder, and the face sublime <br>
  Of blue mid-heaven! On thy awful brow <br>
  Is Deity; and in that voice of thine <br>
  There is the great imperial utterance <br>
  Of God for ever; and thy feet are set <br>
  Where evermore, through all the days and years, <br>
  There rolls the grand hymn of the deathless wave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MaryRivers"></a>Mary Rivers</b></h2>
<p>Path beside the silver waters, flashing in October&rsquo;s sun &mdash; <br>
  Walk, by green and golden margins where the sister streamlets run &mdash; <br>
  Twenty shining springs have vanished, full of flower, and leaf, and bird, <br>
  Since the step of Mary Rivers in your lawny dell was heard! <br>
  Twenty white-haired Junes have left us &mdash; grey with frost and bleak with gale &mdash; <br>
  Since the hand of her we loved so plucked the blossoms in your dale. <br>
  Twenty summers, twenty autumns, from the grand old hills have passed, <br>
  With their robes of royal colour, since we saw the darling last. </p>
<p>Morning comes &mdash; the blessed morning! and the slow song of  the sea, <br>
  Like a psalm from radiant altars, floats across a rose-red lea; <br>
  Then the fair, strong noonday blossoms, and the reaper seeks the cool <br>
  Valley of the moss and myrtle, and the glimmering water-pool. <br>
  Noonday flames and evening follows; and the lordly mountains rest <br>
  Heads arrayed with tenfold splendour on the rich heart of the West. <br>
  Evening walks with moon and music where the higher life has been; <br>
  But the face of Mary Rivers there will nevermore be seen. </p>
<p>Ah! when autumn dells are dewy, and the wave is very  still, <br>
  And that grey ghost called the Twilight passes from the distant hill &mdash; <br>
  Even in the hallowed nightfall, when the fathers sit and dream, <br>
  And the splendid rose of heaven sees a sister in the stream &mdash; <br>
  Often do I watch the waters gleaming in a starry bay, <br>
  Thinking of a bygone beauty, and a season far away; <br>
  Musing on the grace that left us in a time of singing rain, <br>
  On the lady who will never walk amongst these heaths again. </p>
<p>Four there were, but two were taken; and this darling we  deplore, <br>
  She was sweetest of the circle &mdash; she was dearest of the four! <br>
  In the daytime and the dewtime comes the phantom of her face: <br>
  None will ever sit where she did &mdash; none will ever fill her place. <br>
  With the passing of our Mary, like a sunset out of sight, <br>
  Passed away our pure first passion &mdash; all its life and all its light! <br>
  All that made the world a dreamland &mdash; all the glory and the glow <br>
  Of the fine, fresh, morning feeling vanished twenty years ago. </p>
<p>Girl, whose strange, unearthly beauty haunts us ever in  our sleep, <br>
  Many griefs have worn our hearts out &mdash; we are now too tired to weep! <br>
  Time has tried us, years have changed us; but the sweetness shed by you <br>
  Falls upon our spirits daily, like divine, immortal dew. <br>
  Shining are our thoughts about you &mdash; of the blossoms past recall, <br>
  You are still the rose of lustre &mdash; still the fairest of them all; <br>
  In the sleep that brings the garland gathered from the bygone hours, <br>
  You are still our Mary Rivers &mdash; still the queen of all the flowers. </p>
<p>Let me ask, where none can hear me &mdash; When you passed into  the shine, <br>
  And you heard a great love calling, did you know that it was mine? <br>
  In your life of light and music, tell me did you ever see, <br>
  Shining in a holy silence, what was as a flame in me? <br>
  Ah, my darling! no one saw it. Purer than untrodden dew <br>
  Was that first unhappy passion buried in the grave with you. <br>
  Bird and leaf will keep the secret &mdash; wind and wood will never tell <br>
  Men the thing that I have whispered. Mary Rivers, fare you well! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Kingsborough"></a>Kingsborough</b></h2>
<p>A waving of hats and of hands, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices of thousands in one, <br>
  A shout from the ring and the stands, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a glitter of heads in the sun! <br>
  &ldquo;<i>They are off &mdash; they are off!</i>&rdquo; is the  roar, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the cracks settle down to the race, <br>
  With the &ldquo;yellow and black&rdquo; to the fore, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Panic blood forcing the pace. </p>
<p>At the back of the course, and away <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the running-ground home again wheels, <br>
  Grubb travels in front on the bay, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a feather-weight hard at his heels. <br>
  But Yeomans, you see, is about, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wily New Zealander waits, <br>
  Though the high-blooded flyer is out, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose rider and colours are Tait&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>Look! Ashworth comes on with a run <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the head of the Levity colt; <br>
  And the fleet &mdash; the magnificent son <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Panic is shooting his bolt. <br>
  Hurrah for the Weatherbit strain! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Fireworks is first in the straight; <br>
  And &ldquo;<i>A Kelpie will win it again!</i>&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the roar from the ring to the gate. </p>
<p>The leader must have it &mdash; but no! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For see, full of running, behind <br>
  A beautiful, wonderful foe <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the speed of the thunder and wind! <br>
  A flashing of whips, and a cry, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ashworth sits down on his horse, <br>
  With Kingsborough&rsquo;s head at his thigh <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the &ldquo;field&rdquo; scattered over the course! </p>
<p>In a clamour of calls and acclaim <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair race away from the &ldquo;ruck:&rdquo; <br>
  The horse to the last of it game &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A marvel of muscle and pluck! <br>
  But the foot of the Sappho is there, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Kingston&rsquo;s invincible strength; <br>
  And the numbers go up in the air &mdash; <br>
  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colt is the  first by a length! </i></p>
<p>The first, and the favourite too! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terror that came from his stall, <br>
  With the spirit of fire and of dew, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show the road home to them all; <br>
  From the back of the field to the straight <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has come, as is ever his wont, <br>
  And carried his welter-like weight, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a tradesman, right through to the front. </p>
<p>Nor wonder at cheering a wit, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this is the popular horse, <br>
  That never was beaten when &ldquo;fit&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By any four hoofs on the course; <br>
  To starter for Leger or Cup, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has he ever shown feather of fear <br>
  When saddle and rider were up <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the case to be argued was clear? </p>
<p>No! rather the questionless pluck <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the blood unaccustomed to yield, <br>
  Preferred to spread-eagle the ruck, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make a long tail of the &ldquo;field&rdquo;. <br>
  Bear witness, ye lovers of sport, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To races of which he can boast, <br>
  When flyer by flyer was caught, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beaten by lengths on the post! </p>
<p>Lo! this is the beautiful bay &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of many, the marvellous one <br>
  Who showed us last season the way <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a Leger should always be won. <br>
  There was something to look at and learn, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shrewd irreproachable &ldquo;touts&rdquo;, <br>
  When the Panic colt tired at the turn, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the thing was all over &mdash; but shouts! </p>
<p>Aye, that was the &ldquo;spin&rdquo;, when the twain <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came locked by the bend of the course, <br>
  The Zealander pulling his rein, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the veteran hard on his horse! <br>
  When Ashworth was &ldquo;riding&rdquo; &rsquo;twas late <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his friends to applaud on the stands, <br>
  And the Sappho colt entered the straight <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the race of the year in his hands. </p>
<p>Just look at his withers, his thighs! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the way that he carries his head! <br>
  Has Richmond more wonderful eyes, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Melbourne that spring in his tread? <br>
  The grand, the intelligent glance <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a spirit that fathoms and feels, <br>
  Makes the heart of a horse-lover dance <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the warm-blooded life in him reels. </p>
<p>What care have I ever to know <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His owner by sight or by name? <br>
  The horse that I glory in so <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is still the magnificent same. <br>
  I own I am proud of the pluck <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the sportsman that never was bought; <br>
  But the nag that spread-eagled the ruck <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is bound to be first in my thought. </p>
<p>For who that has masculine flame, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or who that is thorough at all, <br>
  Can help feeling joy in the fame <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this king of the kings of the stall? <br>
  What odds if assumption has sealed <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His soulless hereafter abode, <br>
  So long as he shows to his &ldquo;field&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gleam of his hoofs, and the road? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="BeyondKerguelen"></a>Beyond Kerguelen</b></h2>
<p>Down in the South, by the waste without sail on it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from the zone of the blossom and tree, <br>
  Lieth, with winter and whirlwind and wail on it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost of a land by the ghost of a sea. <br>
  Weird is the mist from the summit to base of it; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun of its heaven is wizened and grey; <br>
  Phantom of life is the light on the face of it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never is night on it, never is day! <br>
  Here is the shore without flower or bird on it; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is no litany sweet of the springs &mdash; <br>
  Only the haughty, harsh thunder is heard on it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the storm, with the roar in its wings! </p>
<p>Shadow of moon is the moon in the sky of it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wan as the face of a wizard, and far! <br>
  Never there shines from the firmament high of it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace of the planet or glory of star. <br>
  All the year round, in the place of white days on it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the year round where there never is night &mdash;<br>
  Lies a great sinister, bitter, blind haze on it: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth that is neither of darkness nor light! <br>
  Wild is the cry of the sea in the caves by it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea that is smitten by spears of the snow; <br>
  Desolate songs are the songs of the waves by it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down in the south, where the ships never go. </p>
<p>Storm from the Pole is the singer that sings to it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hymns of the land at the planet&rsquo;s grey verge. <br>
  Thunder discloses dark, wonderful things to it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder and rain, and the dolorous surge. <br>
  Hills with no hope of a wing or a leaf on them, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarred with the chronicles written by flame, <br>
  Stare, through the gloom of inscrutable grief on them, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down on the horns of the gulfs without name. <br>
  Cliffs, with the records of fierce flying fires on them &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loom over perilous pits of eclipse; <br>
  Alps, with anathema stamped in the spires on them &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out by the wave with a curse on its lips. </p>
<p>Never is sign of soft, beautiful green on it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never the colour, the glory of rose! <br>
  Neither the fountain nor river is seen on it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naked its crags are, and barren its snows! <br>
  Blue as the face of the drowned is the shore of it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shore, with the capes of indefinite cave. <br>
  Strange is the voice of its wind, and the roar of it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Startles the mountain and hushes the wave. <br>
  Out to the south and away to the north of it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spectral and sad are the spaces untold! <br>
  All the year round a great cry goeth forth of it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sob of this leper of lands in the cold. </p>
<p>No man hath stood, all its bleak, bitter years on it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall of a foot on its wastes is unknown: <br>
  Only the sound of the hurricane&rsquo;s spears on it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaks with the shout from the uttermost zone. <br>
  Blind are its bays with the shadow of bale on them; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Storms of the nadir their rocks have uphurled; <br>
  Earthquake hath registered deeply its tale on them &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tale of distress from the dawn of the world! <br>
  <i>There</i> are the gaps, with the surges  that seethe in them &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaps in whose jaws is a menace that glares! <br>
  <i>There</i> the wan reefs, with the  merciless teeth in them, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleam on a chaos that startles and scares! </p>
<p>Back in the dawn of this beautiful sphere, on it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land of the dolorous, desolate face &mdash; <br>
  Beamed the blue day; and the bountiful year on it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fostered the leaf and the blossom of grace. <br>
  Grand were the lights of its midsummer noon on it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mornings of majesty shone on its seas; <br>
  Glitter of star and the glory of moon on it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell, in the march of the musical breeze. <br>
  Valleys and hills, with the whisper of wing in them, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dells of the daffodil &mdash; spaces impearled, <br>
  Flowered and flashed with the splendour of Spring in them &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the morn of this wonderful world. </p>
<p>Soft were the words that the thunder then said to it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said to this lustre of emerald plain; <br>
  Sun brought the yellow, the green, and the red to it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet were the songs of its silvery rain. <br>
  Voices of water and wind in the bays of it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingered, and lulled like the psalm of a dream. <br>
  Fair were the nights and effulgent the days of it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moon was in shadow and shade in the beam. <br>
  Summer&rsquo;s chief throne was the marvellous coast of it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home of the Spring was its luminous lea: <br>
  Garden of glitter! But only the ghost of it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moans in the south by the ghost of a sea. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="BlackLizzie"></a>Black Lizzie</b></h2>
<p>The gloved and jewelled bards who sing <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Pippa, Maud, and Dorothea, <br>
  Have hardly done the handsome thing <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you, my inky Cytherea. </p>
<p>Flower of a land whose sunny skies <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are like the dome of Dante&rsquo;s clime, <br>
  They <i>might</i> have praised your lips,  your eyes, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, eke, your ankles in their rhyme! </p>
<p>But let them pass! To right your wrong, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aspasia of the ardent South, <br>
  Your poet means to sing a song <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some prolixity of mouth. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll even sketch you as you are <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Herrick&rsquo;s style of carelessness, <br>
  Not overstocked with things that bar <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ample view &mdash; to wit, with dress. </p>
<p>You have your blanket, it is true; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, if I am right at all, <br>
  What best would suit a dame like you <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was worn by Eve before the Fall. </p>
<p>Indeed, the &ldquo;fashion&rdquo; is a thing <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never cramped your cornless toes: <br>
  Your single jewel is a ring <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slung in your penetrated nose. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t detect the flowing lines <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Grecian features in your face, <br>
  Nor are there patent any signs <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That link you with the Roman race. </p>
<p>In short, I do not think your mould <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resembles, with its knobs of bone, <br>
  The fair Hellenic shapes of old <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose perfect forms survive in stone. </p>
<p>Still, if the charm called Beauty lies <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ampleness of ear and lip, <br>
  And nostrils of exceeding size, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are a gem, my ladyship! </p>
<p>Here, squatting by the doubtful flame <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of three poor sticks, without a roof <br>
  Above your head, impassive dame <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You live on &mdash; somewhat hunger-proof. </p>
<p>The current scandals of the day <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t trouble you &mdash; you seem to take <br>
  Things in the coolest sort of way &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And <i>wisest</i> &mdash;  for you have no ache. </p>
<p>You smoke a pipe &mdash; of course, you do! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About an inch in length or less, <br>
  Which, from a sexual point of view, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars somehow your attractiveness. </p>
<p>But, rather than resign the weed, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;d shock us, whites, by chewing it; <br>
  For etiquette is not indeed <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing that bothers you a bit. </p>
<p>Your people &mdash; take them as a whole &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are careless on the score of grace; <br>
  And hence you needn&rsquo;t comb your poll <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or decorate your unctuous face. </p>
<p>Still, seeing that a little soap <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would soften an excess of tint, <br>
  You&rsquo;ll pardon my advance, I hope, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving you a gentle hint. </p>
<p>You have your lovers &mdash; dusky beaux <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not made of the poetic stuff <br>
  That sports an Apollonian nose, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wears a sleek Byronic cuff. </p>
<p>But rather of a rougher clay <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unmixed with overmuch romance, <br>
  Far better at the wildwood fray <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than spinning in a ballroom dance. </p>
<p><i>These</i> scarcely are the sonneteers <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sing their loves in faultless clothes: <br>
  Your friends have more decided ears <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And more capaciousness of nose. </p>
<p>No doubt they suit you best &mdash; although <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They woo you roughly it is said: <br>
  Their way of courtship is a blow <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck with a nullah on the head. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t hurt you much &mdash; the thing <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is hardly novel to your life; <br>
  And, <i>sans</i> the feast and marriage  ring, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You make a good impromptu wife. </p>
<p>This hasty sort of wedding might, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other cases, bring distress; <br>
  But then, your draper&rsquo;s bills are light &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re frugal in regard to dress. </p>
<p>You have no passion for the play, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or park, or other showy scenes; <br>
  And, hence, you have no scores to pay, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And live within your husband&rsquo;s means. </p>
<p>Of course, his income isn&rsquo;t large, &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not too certain &mdash; still you thrive <br>
  By steering well inside the marge, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep your little ones alive. </p>
<p>In short, in some respects you set <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fine example; and a few <br>
  Of those white matrons I have met <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would show some sense by copying you. </p>
<p>Here let us part! I will not say, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O lady free from scents and starch, <br>
  That you are like, in any way, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authoress of &ldquo;<i>Middlemarch</i>&rdquo;. </p>
<p>One cannot match her perfect phrase <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With commonplaces from your lip; <br>
  And yet there are some sexual traits <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That show your dim relationship. </p>
<p>Indeed, in spite of all the mists <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That grow from social codes, I see <br>
  The liberal likeness which exists <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout our whole humanity. </p>
<p>And though I&rsquo;ve laughed at your expense, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Dryad of the dusky race, <br>
  No man who has a heart and sense <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would bring displeasure to your face.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="HyBrasil"></a>Hy-Brasil</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; said the ancient father, pausing by the  evening sea, <br>
  &ldquo;Turn thy face towards the sunset &mdash; turn thy face and kneel with me! <br>
  Prayer and praise and holy fasting, lips of love and life of light, <br>
  These and these have made thee perfect &mdash; shining saint with seraph&rsquo;s sight! <br>
  Look towards that flaming crescent &mdash; look beyond that glowing space &mdash; <br>
  Tell me, sister of the angels, what is beaming in thy face?&rdquo; <br>
  And the daughter, who had fasted, who had spent her days in prayer, <br>
  Till the glory of the Saviour touched her head and rested there, <br>
  Turned her eyes towards the sea-line &mdash; saw beyond the fiery crest, <br>
  Floating over waves of jasper, far Hy-Brasil in the west. </p>
<p>All the calmness and the colour &mdash; all the splendour and  repose, <br>
  Flowing where the sunset flowered, like a silver-hearted rose! <br>
  There indeed was singing Eden, where the great gold river runs <br>
  Past the porch and gates of crystal, ringed by strong and shining ones! <br>
  There indeed was God&rsquo;s own garden, sailing down the sapphire sea &mdash; <br>
  Lawny dells and slopes of summer, dazzling stream and radiant tree! <br>
  Out against the hushed horizon &mdash; out beneath the reverent day, <br>
  Flamed the Wonder on the waters &mdash; flamed and flashed and passed away. <br>
  And the maiden who had seen it felt a hand within her own, <br>
  And an angel that we know not led her to the lands unknown. </p>
<p>Never since hath eye beheld it &mdash; never since hath mortal,  dazed <br>
  By its strange, unearthly splendour, on the floating Eden gazed! <br>
  Only once since Eve went weeping through a throng of glittering wings, <br>
  Hath the holy seen Hy-Brasil where the great gold river sings! <br>
  Only once by quiet waters, under still, resplendent skies, <br>
  Did the sister of the seraphs kneel in sight of Paradise! <br>
  She, the pure, the perfect woman, sanctified by patient prayer, <br>
  Had the eyes of saints of Heaven, all their glory in her hair: <br>
  Therefore God the Father whispered to a radiant spirit near &mdash; <br>
  &ldquo;Show Our daughter fair Hy-Brasil &mdash; show her this, and lead her here.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But beyond the halls of sunset, but within the wondrous  west, <br>
  On the rose-red seas of evening, sails the Garden of the Blest. <br>
  Still the gates of glassy beauty, still the walls of glowing light, <br>
  Shine on waves that no man knows of, out of sound and out of sight. <br>
  Yet the slopes and lawns of lustre, yet the dells of sparkling streams, <br>
  Dip to tranquil shores of jasper, where the watching angel beams. <br>
  But, behold, our eyes are human, and our way is paved with pain, <br>
  We can never find Hy-Brasil, never see its hills again; <br>
  Never look on bays of crystal, never bend the reverent knee <br>
  In the sight of Eden floating &mdash; floating on the sapphire sea! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="JimTheSplitter"></a>Jim The Splitter</b></h2>
<p>The bard who is singing of Wollombi Jim <br>
  Is hardly just now in the requisite trim<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sit on his Pegasus fairly; <br>
  Besides, he is bluntly informed by the Muse <br>
  That Jim is a subject no singer should choose; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Jim is poetical rarely. </p>
<p>But being full up of the myths that are Greek &mdash; <br>
  Of the classic, and &ldquo;noble, and nude, and antique,&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which means not a rag but the pelt on; <br>
  This poet intends to give Daphne the slip, <br>
  For the sake of a hero in moleskin and kip, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a jumper and snake-buckle belt on. </p>
<p>No party is Jim of the Pericles type &mdash; <br>
  He is modern right up from the toe to the pipe; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And being no reader or roamer, <br>
  He hasn&rsquo;t Euripides much in the head; <br>
  And let it be carefully, tenderly said, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never has analysed Homer. </p>
<p>He can roar out a song of the twopenny kind; <br>
  But, knowing the beggar so well, I&rsquo;m inclined <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To believe that a &ldquo;par&rdquo; about Kelly, <br>
  The rascal who skulked under shadow of curse, <br>
  Is more in his line than the happiest verse <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the glittering pages of Shelley. </p>
<p>You mustn&rsquo;t, however, adjudge him in haste, <br>
  Because a red robber is more to his taste <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than Ruskin, Rossetti, or Dante! <br>
  You see, he was bred in a bangalow wood, <br>
  And bangalow pith was the principal food <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother served out in her shanty. </p>
<p>His knowledge is this &mdash; he can tell in the dark <br>
  What timber will split by the feel of the bark; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rough as his manner of speech is, <br>
  His wits to the fore he can readily bring <br>
  In passing off ash as the genuine thing <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When scarce in the forest the beech is. </p>
<p>In girthing a tree that he sells &ldquo;in the round,&rdquo; <br>
  He assumes, as a rule, that the body is sound, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And measures, <i>forgetting to bark it!</i> <br>
  He may be a ninny, but still the old dog <br>
  Can plug to perfection the pipe of a log <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &ldquo;palm it&rdquo; away on the market. </p>
<p>He splits a fair shingle, but holds to the rule <br>
  Of his father&rsquo;s, and, haply, his grandfather&rsquo;s school;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which means that he never has blundered, <br>
  When tying his shingles, by slinging in more <br>
  Than the recognized number of ninety and four <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the bundle he sells for a hundred! </p>
<p>When asked by the market for ironbark red, <br>
  It always occurs to the Wollombi head <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do a &ldquo;mahogany&rdquo; swindle. <br>
  In forests where never the ironbark grew, <br>
  When Jim is at work, it would flabbergast you <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see how the &ldquo;ironbarks&rdquo; dwindle. </p>
<p>He can stick to the saddle, can Wollombi Jim, <br>
  And when a buckjumper dispenses with him, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leather goes off with the rider. <br>
  And, as to a team, over gully and hill <br>
  He can travel with twelve on the breadth of a quill <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And boss the unlucky &ldquo;offsider.&rdquo; </p>
<p>He shines at his best at the tiller of saw, <br>
  On the top of the pit, where his whisper is law <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the gentleman working below him. <br>
  When the pair of them pause in a circle of dust, <br>
  Like a monarch he <i>poses</i> &mdash; exalted, august &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing this planet can show him! </p>
<p>For a man is a <i>man</i> who can &ldquo;sharpen&rdquo; and &ldquo;set;&rdquo; <br>
  And <i>he</i> is the only thing masculine yet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to  sawyer and splitter &mdash; <br>
  Or rather according to Wollombi Jim; <br>
  And nothing will tempt me to differ from him, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Jim is a bit of a hitter. </p>
<p>But, being full up, we&rsquo;ll allow him to rip, <br>
  Along with his lingo, his saw, and his whip &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He isn&rsquo;t the classical &ldquo;notion;&rdquo; <br>
  And, after a night in his &ldquo;humpy,&rdquo; you see, <br>
  A person of orthodox habits would be <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refreshed by a dip in the ocean. </p>
<p>To tot him right up from the heel to the head, <br>
  He isn&rsquo;t the Grecian of whom we have read &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His face is a trifle too shady. <br>
  The nymph in green valleys of Thessaly dim <br>
  Would never &ldquo;jack up&rdquo; her old lover for him, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For <i>she</i> has the  tastes of a lady. </p>
<p>So much for our hero! A statuesque foot <br>
  Would suffer by wearing that heavy-nailed boot &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its owner is hardly Achilles. <br>
  However, he&rsquo;s happy! He cuts a great &ldquo;fig&rdquo; <br>
  In the land where a coat is no part of the &ldquo;rig&rdquo; &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the country of damper and &ldquo;billies.&rdquo; </p>

  Beauty caught from beauty fairer <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the human face of things! <br>

  Where the River Spirit, dreaming, <br>
  Sleeps by fall and fountain streaming <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under lute of leaf and bough &mdash; <br>
  Hears, where stamp of storm with stress is, <br>
  Psalms from unseen wildernesses <br>
  Deep amongst far hill-recesses &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He that is by Mooni now. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, for him by Mooni&rsquo;s marge <br>
  Sings the yellow-haired September, <br>
  With the face the gods remember <br>
  When the ridge is burnt to ember, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dumb sea chains the barge! <br>
  Where the mount like molten brass is, <br>
  Down beneath fern-feathered passes, <br>
  Noonday dew in cool green grasses <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleams on him by Mooni&rsquo;s marge. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who that dwells by Mooni yet, <br>
  Feels, in flowerful forest arches, <br>
  Smiting wings and breath that parches <br>
  Where strong Summer&rsquo;s path of march is, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the suns in thunder set? <br>
  Housed beneath the gracious kirtle <br>
  Of the shadowy water myrtle, <br>
  Winds may hiss with heat, and hurtle &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is safe by Mooni yet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days there were when he who sings <br>
  (Dumb so long through passion&rsquo;s losses) <br>
  Stood where Mooni&rsquo;s water crosses <br>
  Shining tracts of green-haired mosses, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a soul with radiant wings; <br>

  Lent a beauty to his verses, <br>

  Certain days are not above me, <br>
  Certain hearts have ceased to love me, <br>
  Certain fancies fail to move me <br>

  He who mocks the mighty, gracious <br>
  Love of Christ, with eyes audacious, <br>
  Hunting after fires fallacious, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wears the issue in his face. <br>
  Soul that flouted gift and Giver, <br>
  Like the broken Persian river, <br>
  Thou hast lost thy strength for ever! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin and shame have left their trace. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years that used to be, <br>
  When the large, supreme occasion <br>
  Brought the life of inspiration, <br>
  Like a god&rsquo;s transfiguration <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the shining change in me. <br>
  Then, where Mooni&rsquo;s glory glances, <br>
  Clear, diviner countenances <br>
  Beamed on me like blessed chances, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years that used to be. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, the beauty of old ways! <br>
  Then the man who so resembled <br>
  Lords of light unstained, unhumbled, <br>
  Touched the skirts of Christ, nor trembled <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the grand benignant gaze! <br>
  Now he shrinks before the splendid <br>
  Face of Deity offended, <br>
  All the loveliness is ended! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the beauty of old ways!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still to be by Mooni cool &mdash; <br>

  Faint it is &mdash; the sound of thunder <br>
  From the torrents far thereunder, <br>
  Where the meeting mountains ponder &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, by Mooni&rsquo;s fair hill heads. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to be where Mooni is, <br>
  Even where the fierce fall races <br>
  Down august, unfathomed places, <br>
  Where of sun or moon no trace is, <br>

<p>Gaul whose keel in far, dim ages ploughed wan widths of  polar sea &mdash; <br>
  Gray old sailor of Massilia, who hath woven wreath for thee? <br>
  Who amongst the world&rsquo;s high singers ever breathed the tale sublime <br>
  Of the man who coasted England in the misty dawn of time? <br>
  Leaves of laurel, lights of music &mdash; these and these have never shed <br>
  Glory on the name unheard of, lustre on the vanished head. <br>
  Lords of song, and these are many, never yet have raised the lay <br>
  For the white, wind-beaten seaman of a wild, forgotten day. <br>
  Harp of shining son of Godhead still is as a voice august; <br>
  But the man who first saw Britain sleeps beneath unnoticed dust. </p>
<p>From the fair, calm bays Hellenic, from the crescents and  the bends, <br>
  Round the wall of crystal Athens, glowing in gold evening-ends, <br>
  Sailed abroad the grand, strong father, with his face towards the snow <br>
  Of the awful northern mountains, twenty centuries ago. <br>
  On the seas that none had heard of, by the shores where none had furled <br>
  Wing of canvas, passed this elder to the limits of the world. <br>
  Lurid limits, loud with thunder and the roar of flaming cone, <br>
  Ghastly tracts of ice and whirlwind lying in a dim, blind zone, <br>
  Bitter belts of naked region, girt about by cliffs of fear, <br>
  Where the Spirit of the Darkness dwells in heaven half the year. </p>
<p>Yea, against the wild, weird Thule, steered the stranger  through the gates <br>
  Opened by a fire eternal, into tempest-trampled straits &mdash; <br>
  Thule, lying like a nightmare on the borders of the Pole: <br>
  Neither land, nor air, nor water, but a mixture of the whole! <br>
  Dumb, dead chaos, grey as spectre, now a mist and now a cloud, <br>
  Where the winds cry out for ever, and the wave is always loud. <br>
  Here the lord of many waters, in the great exalted years, <br>
  Saw the sight that no man knows of &mdash; heard the sound that no man hears &mdash; <br>
  Felt that God was in the Shadow ere he turned his prow and sped <br>
  To the sweet green fields of England with the sunshine overhead. </p>
<p>In the day when pallid Persia fled before the Thracian  steel, <br>
  By the land that now is London passed the strange Hellenic keel. <br>
  Up the bends of quiet river, hard by banks of grove and flower, <br>
  Sailed the father through a silence in the old majestic hour. <br>
  Not a sound of fin or feather, not a note of wave or breeze, <br>
  Vext the face of sleeping streamlets, broke the rest of stirless trees. <br>
  Not a foot was in the forest, not a voice was in the wood, <br>
  When the elder from Massilia over English waters stood. <br>
  All was new, and hushed, and holy &mdash; all was pure untrodden space, <br>
  When the lord of many oceans turned to it a reverent face. <br>
  Man who knew resplendent Athens, set and framed in silver sea, </p>
<p>Did not dream a dream of England &mdash; England of the years to  be! <br>
  Friend of fathers like to Plato &mdash; bards august and hallowed seers &mdash; <br>
  Did not see that tenfold glory, Britain of the future years! <br>
  Spirit filled with Grecian music, songs that charm the dark away, <br>
  On that large, supreme occasion, did not note diviner lay &mdash; <br>
  Did not hear the voice of Shakespeare &mdash; all the mighty life was still, <br>
  Down the slopes that dipped to seaward, on the shoulders of the hill; <br>
  But the gold and green were brighter than the bloom of Thracian springs, <br>
  And a strange, surpassing beauty shone upon the face of things. </p>
<p>In a grave that no man thinks of &mdash; back from far-forgotten  bays &mdash; <br>
  Sleeps the grey, wind-beaten sailor of the old exalted days. <br>
  He that coasted Wales and Dover, he that first saw Sussex plains, <br>
  Passed away with head unlaurelled in the wild Thessalian rains. <br>
  In a space by hand untended, by a fen of vapours blind, <br>
  Lies the king of many waters &mdash; out of sight and out of mind! <br>
  No one brings the yearly blossom &mdash; no one culls the flower of grace, <br>
  For the shell of mighty father buried in that lonely place; <br>
  But the winds are low and holy, and the songs of sweetness flow, <br>
  Where he fell asleep for ever, twenty centuries ago. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="BillTheBullockDriver"></a>Bill The Bullock Driver</b></h2>
<p>The leaders of millions, the lords of the lands, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sway the wide world with their will <br>
  And shake the great globe with the strength of their hands, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flash past us &mdash; unnoticed by Bill. </p>
<p>The elders of science who measure the spheres <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weigh the vast bulk of the sun &mdash; <br>
  Who see the grand lights beyond aeons of years, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are less than a bullock to <i>one</i>. </p>
<p>The singers that sweeten all time with their song &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure voices that make us forget <br>
  Humanity&rsquo;s drama of marvellous wrong &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Bill are as mysteries yet. </p>
<p>By thunders of battle and nations uphurled, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill&rsquo;s sympathies never were stirred: <br>
  The helmsmen who stand at the wheel of the world <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By him are unknown and unheard. </p>
<p>What trouble has Bill for the ruin of lands, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the quarrels of temple and throne, <br>
  So long as the whip that he holds in his hands <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the team that he drives are his own? </p>
<p>As straight and as sound as a slab without crack, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Bill is a king in his way; <br>
  Though he camps by the side of a shingle track, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sleeps on the bed of his dray. </p>
<p>A whip-lash to him is as dear as a rose <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would be to a delicate maid; <br>
  He carries his darlings wherever he goes, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a pocket-book tattered and frayed. </p>
<p>The joy of a bard when he happens to write <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A song like the song of his dream <br>
  Is nothing at all to our hero&rsquo;s delight <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pluck and the strength of his team. </p>
<p>For the kings of the earth, for the faces august <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of princes, the millions may shout; <br>
  To Bill, as he lumbers along in the dust, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bullock&rsquo;s the grandest thing out. </p>
<p>His four-footed friends are the friends of his choice &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No lover is Bill of your dames; <br>
  But the cattle that turn at the sound of his voice <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have the sweetest of features and names. </p>
<p>A father&rsquo;s chief joy is a favourite son, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he reaches some eminent goal, <br>
  But the pride of Bill&rsquo;s heart is the hairy-legged one <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pulls with a will at the pole. </p>
<p>His dray is no living, responsible thing, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he gives it the gender of life; <br>
  And, seeing his fancy is free in the wing, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It suits him as well as a wife. </p>
<p>He thrives like an Arab. Between the two wheels <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is his bedroom, where, lying up-curled, <br>
  He thinks for himself, like a sultan, and feels <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That his home is the best in the world. </p>
<p>For, even though cattle, like subjects, will break <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times from the yoke and the band, <br>
  Bill knows how to act when his rule is at stake, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is therefore a lord of the land. </p>
<p>Of course he must dream; but be sure that his dreams, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If happy, must compass, alas! <br>
  Fat bullocks at feed by improbable streams, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knee-deep in improbable grass. </p>
<p>No poet is Bill, for the visions of night <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him are as visions of day; <br>
  And the pipe that in sleep he endeavours to light <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the pipe that he smokes on the dray. </p>
<p>To the mighty, magnificent temples of God, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hearts of the dominant hills, <br>
  Bill&rsquo;s eyes are as blind as the fire-blackened clod <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That burns far away from the rills. </p>
<p>Through beautiful, bountiful forests that screen <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A marvel of blossoms from heat &mdash; <br>
  Whose lights are the mellow and golden and green &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill walks with irreverent feet. </p>
<p>The manifold splendours of mountain and wood <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Bill like nonentities slip; <br>
  He loves the black myrtle because it is good <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a handle to lash to his whip. </p>
<p>And thus through the world, with a swing in his tread, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hero self-satisfied goes; <br>
  With his cabbage-tree hat on the back of his head, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the string  of it under his nose. </p>
<p>Poor bullocky Bill! In the circles select <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the scholars he hasn&rsquo;t a place; <br>
  But he walks like a <i>man</i>, with his  forehead erect, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he looks at God&rsquo;s day in the face. </p>
<p>For, rough as he seems, he would shudder to wrong <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dog with the loss of a hair; <br>
  And the angels of shine and superlative song <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See his heart and the deity there. </p>
<p>Few know him, indeed; but the beauty that glows <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the forest is loveliness still; <br>
  And Providence helping the life of the rose <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a Friend and a Father to Bill. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Cooranbean"></a>Cooranbean</b></h2>
<p>Years fifty, and seven to boot, have smitten the children  of men <br>
  Since sound of a voice or a foot came out of the head of that glen. <br>
  The brand of black devil is there &mdash; an evil wind moaneth around &mdash; <br>
  There is doom, there is death in the air: a curse groweth up from the ground! <br>
  No noise of the axe or the saw in that hollow unholy is heard, <br>
  No fall of the hoof or the paw, no whirr of the wing of the bird; <br>
  But a grey mother down by the sea, as wan as the foam on the strait, <br>
  Has counted the beads on her knee these forty-nine winters and eight. </p>
<p>Whenever an elder is asked &mdash; a white-headed man of the  woods &mdash; <br>
  Of the terrible mystery masked where the dark everlastingly broods, <br>
  Be sure he will turn to the bay, with his back to the glen in the range, <br>
  And glide like a phantom away, with a countenance pallid with change. <br>
  From the line of dead timber that lies supine at the foot of the glade, <br>
  The fierce-featured eaglehawk flies &mdash; afraid as a dove is afraid; <br>
  But back in that wilderness dread are a fall and the forks of a ford &mdash; <br>
  <i>Ah! pray and uncover your head, and lean  like a child on the Lord. </i></p>
<p>A sinister fog at the wane &mdash; at the change of the moon  cometh forth <br>
  Like an ominous ghost in the train of a bitter, black storm of the north! <br>
  At the head of the gully unknown it hangs like a spirit of bale. <br>
  And the noise of a shriek and a groan strikes up in the gusts of the gale. <br>
  In the throat of a feculent pit is the beard of a bloody-red sedge; <br>
  And a foam like the foam of a fit sweats out of the lips of the ledge. <br>
  But down in the water of death, in the livid, dead pool at the base &mdash; <br>
  <i>Bow low, with inaudible breath, beseech  with the hands to the face! </i></p>
<p>A furlong of fetid, black fen, with gelid, green patches  of pond, <br>
  Lies dumb by the horns of the glen &mdash; at the gates of the horror beyond; <br>
  And those who have looked on it tell of the terrible growths that are there &mdash; <br>
  The flowerage fostered by hell, the blossoms that startle and scare. <br>
  If ever a wandering bird should light on Gehennas like this <br>
  Be sure that a cry will be heard, and the sound of the flat adder&rsquo;s hiss. <br>
  But hard by the jaws of the bend is a ghastly Thing matted with moss &mdash; <br>
  <i>Ah, Lord! be a father, a friend, for the  sake of the Christ of the Cross. </i></p>
<p>Black Tom, with the sinews of five &mdash; that never a hangman  could hang &mdash; <br>
  In the days of the shackle and gyve, broke loose from the guards of the gang. <br>
  Thereafter, for seasons a score, this devil prowled under the ban; <br>
  A mate of red talon and paw, a wolf in the shape of a man. <br>
  But, ringed by ineffable fire, in a thunder and wind of the north, <br>
  The sword of Omnipotent ire &mdash; the bolt of high Heaven went forth! <br>
  But, wan as the sorrowful foam, a grey mother waits by the sea <br>
  For the boys that have never come home these fifty-four winters and three. </p>
<p>From the folds of the forested hills there are ravelled  and roundabout tracks, <br>
  Because of the terror that fills the strong-handed men of the axe! <br>
  Of the workers away in the range there is none that will wait for the night, <br>
  When the storm-stricken moon is in change and the sinister fog is in sight. <br>
  And later and deep in the dark, when the bitter wind whistles about, <br>
  There is never a howl or a bark from the dog in the kennel without, <br>
  But the white fathers fasten the door, and often and often they start, <br>
  At a sound like a foot on the floor and a touch like a hand on the heart. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hoof I would not see; <br>
  But if these items did appear <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wouldn&rsquo;t trouble me. <br>
  For ah! the pelt of mortal man <br>

<p align="center" class="note"><i>(Written in the Shadow of 1872)</i></p>
<p>Twelve years ago, when I could face <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High heaven&rsquo;s dome with different eyes &mdash; <br>
  In days full-flowered with hours of grace, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nights not sad with sighs &mdash; <br>
  I wrote a song in which I strove <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To shadow forth thy strain of woe, <br>
  Dark widowed sister of the grove! &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve wasted years ago. </p>
<p>But youth was then too young to find <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those high authentic syllables, <br>
  Whose voice is like the wintering wind <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By sunless mountain fells; <br>
  Nor had I sinned and suffered then <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that superlative degree <br>
  That I would rather seek, than men, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wild fellowship with thee! </p>
<p>But he who hears this autumn day <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy more than deep autumnal rhyme, <br>
  Is one whose hair was shot with grey <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Grief instead of Time. <br>
  He has no need, like many a bard, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sing imaginary pain, <br>
  Because he bears, and finds it hard, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishment of Cain. </p>
<p>No more he sees the affluence <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which makes the heart of Nature glad; <br>
  For he has lost the fine, first sense <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Beauty that he had. <br>
  The old delight God&rsquo;s happy breeze <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was wont to give, to Grief has grown; <br>
  And therefore, Niobe of trees, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His song is like thine own! </p>
<p>But I, who am that perished soul, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have wasted so these powers of mine, <br>
  That I can never write that whole, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure, perfect speech of thine. <br>
  Some lord of words august, supreme, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grave, grand melody demands; <br>
  The dark translation of thy theme <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave to other  hands. </p>
<p>Yet here, where plovers nightly call <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across dim, melancholy leas &mdash; <br>
  Where comes by whistling fen and fall <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moan of far-off seas &mdash; <br>
  A grey, old Fancy often sits <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath thy shade with tired wings, <br>
  And fills thy strong, strange rhyme by fits <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With awful utterings. </p>
<p>Then times there are when all the words <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are like the sentences of one <br>
  Shut in by Fate from wind and birds <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And light of stars and sun, <br>
  No dazzling dryad, but a dark <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream-haunted spirit doomed to be <br>
  Imprisoned, crampt in bands of bark, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all eternity. </p>
<p>Yea, like the speech of one aghast <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Immortality in chains, <br>
  What time the lordly storm rides past <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flames and arrowy rains: <br>
  Some wan Tithonus of the wood, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White with immeasurable years &mdash; <br>
  An awful ghost in solitude <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With moaning moors and meres. </p>
<p>And when high thunder smites the hill <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hunts the wild dog to his den,<br>
  Thy cries, like maledictions, shrill <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shriek from glen to glen, <br>
  As if a frightful memory whipped <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy soul for some infernal crime <br>
  That left it blasted, blind, and stript &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dread to Death and Time! </p>
<p>But when the fair-haired August dies, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flowers wax strong and beautiful, <br>
  Thy songs are stately harmonies <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By wood-lights green and cool &mdash; <br>
  Most like the voice of one who shows <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through sufferings fierce, in fine relief, <br>
  A noble patience and repose &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dignity in grief. </p>
<p>But, ah! conceptions fade away, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still the life that lives in thee &mdash; <br>
  The soul of thy majestic lay &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remains a mystery! <br>
  And he must speak the speech divine &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language of the high-throned lords &mdash; <br>
  Who&rsquo;d give that grand old theme of thine <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its sense in faultless words. </p>
<p>By hollow lands and sea-tracts harsh, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With ruin of the fourfold gale, <br>
  Where sighs the sedge and sobs the marsh, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still wail thy lonely wail; <br>
  And, year by year, one step will break <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleep of far hill-folded streams, <br>
  And seek, if only for thy sake <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy home of many dreams. </p>

<p>No song is this of leaf and bird, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gracious waters flowing; <br>
  I&rsquo;m sick at heart, for I have heard <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Billy Vickers &ldquo;blowing&rdquo;. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;d never take a leading place <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In chambers legislative: <br>
  This booby with the vacant face &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hoddy-doddy native! </p>
<p>Indeed, I&rsquo;m forced to say aside, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To you, O reader, solely, <br>
  He only wants the horns and hide <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a bullock wholly. </p>
<p>But, like all noodles, he is vain; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when his tongue is wagging, <br>
  I feel inclined to copy Cain, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &ldquo;drop&rdquo; him for his bragging. </p>
<p>He, being Bush-bred, stands, of course, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six feet his dirty socks in; <br>
  His lingo is confined to horse <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And plough, and pig and oxen. </p>
<p>Two years ago he&rsquo;d less to say <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within his little circuit; <br>
  But now he has, besides a dray, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of twelve to work it. </p>
<p>No wonder is it that he feels <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclined to clack and rattle <br>
  About his bullocks and his wheels &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He owns a dozen cattle. </p>
<p>In short, to be exact and blunt, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his own estimation <br>
  He&rsquo;s &ldquo;out and out&rdquo; the head and front <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Top-sawyer of creation! </p>
<p>For, mark me, he can &ldquo;sit a buck&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hours and hours together; <br>
  And never horse has had the luck <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pitch him from the leather. </p>
<p>If ever he should have a &ldquo;spill&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the grass or gravel, <br>
  Be sure of this, the saddle will <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Billy Vickers travel. </p>
<p>At punching oxen you may guess <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s nothing out can &ldquo;camp&rdquo; him: <br>
  He has, in fact, the slouch and dress <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which bullock-driver stamp him. </p>
<p>I do not mean to give offence, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have vainly striven <br>
  To ferret out the difference <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twixt driver and the driven. </p>
<p>Of course, the statements herein made <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every other stanza <br>
  Are Billy&rsquo;s own; and I&rsquo;m afraid <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re stark extravaganza. </p>
<p>I feel constrained to treat as trash <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His noisy fiddle-faddle <br>
  About his doings with the lash, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His feats upon the saddle. </p>
<p>But grant he &ldquo;knows his way about&rdquo;, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or grant that he is silly, <br>
  There cannot be the slightest doubt <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Billy&rsquo;s faith in Billy. </p>
<p>Of all the doings of the day <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ignorance is utter; <br>
  But he can quote the price of hay, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current rate of butter. </p>
<p>His notions of our leading men <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are mixed and misty very: <br>
  He knows a Cochin-China hen &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never speaks of Berry. </p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ll assume, he hasn&rsquo;t heard <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Madame Patti&rsquo;s singing; <br>
  But I will stake my solemn word <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows what maize is bringing. </p>
<p>Surrounded by majestic peaks, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By lordly mountain ranges, <br>
  Where highest voice of thunder speaks <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His aspect never changes. </p>
<p>The grand Pacific there beyond <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dirty hut is glowing: <br>
  He only sees a big salt pond, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er which his grain is going. </p>
<p>The sea that covers half the sphere, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its stately speeches, <br>
  Is held by Bill to be a mere <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broad highway for his peaches. </p>
<p>Through Nature&rsquo;s splendid temples he <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plods, under mountains hoary; <br>
  But he has not the eyes to see <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their grandeur and their glory. </p>
<p>A bullock in a biped&rsquo;s boot, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I iterate, is Billy! <br>
  He crushes with a careless foot <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The touching water-lily. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said enough &mdash; I&rsquo;ll let him go! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he could read these verses, <br>
  He&rsquo;d pepper me for hours, I know, <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His manners loud and flashy, <br>
  Nor learn with neatness to arrange<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His clothing, cheap and trashy. </p>
<p>Like other louts, he&rsquo;ll jog along, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swig at shanty liquors, <br>
  And chew and spit. Here ends the song <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Mr. Billy Vickers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Persia"></a>Persia</b></h2>
<p>I am writing this song at the close <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a beautiful day of the spring <br>
  In a dell where the daffodil grows <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a grove of the glimmering wing; <br>
  From glades where a musical word <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes ever from luminous fall, <br>
  I send you the song of a bird <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I wish to be dear to you all. </p>
<p>I have given my darling the name <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a land at the gates of the day, <br>
  Where morning is always the same, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spring never passes away. <br>
  With a prayer for a lifetime of light, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I christened her Persia, you see; <br>
  And I hope that some fathers to-night <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will kneel in the spirit with me. </p>
<p>She is only commencing to look <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beauty in which she is set; <br>
  And forest and flower and brook, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her are all mysteries yet. <br>
  I know that to many my words <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will seem insignificant things; <br>
  But <i>you</i> who are mothers of birds <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will feel for the father who sings. </p>
<p>For all of you doubtless have been <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where sorrows are many and wild; <br>
  And you <i>know</i> what a beautiful scene <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this world can be made by a child: <br>
  I am sure, if they listen to this, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet women will quiver, and long <br>
  To tenderly stoop to and kiss <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Persia I&rsquo;ve put in a song. </p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m certain the critic will pause, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And excuse, for the sake of my bird, <br>
  My sins against critical laws &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slips in the thought and the word. <br>
  And haply some dear little face <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his own to his mind will occur &mdash; <br>
  Some Persia who brightens his place &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;ll be forgiven for her. </p>
<p>A life that is turning to grey <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has hardly been happy, you see; <br>
  But the rose that has dropped on my way <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is morning and music to me. <br>
  Yea, she that I hold by the hand <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is changing white winter to green, <br>
  And making a light of the land &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All fathers will know what I mean: </p>
<p>All women and men who have known <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sickness of sorrow and sin, <br>
  Will feel &mdash; having babes of their own &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My verse and the pathos therein. <br>
  For that must be touching which shows <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How a life has been led from the wild <br>
  To a garden of glitter and rose, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the flower-like hand of a child. </p>
<p>She is strange to this wonderful sphere; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One summer and winter have set <br>
  Since God left her radiance here &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sweet second year is not yet. <br>
  The world is so lovely and new <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To eyes full of eloquent light, <br>
  And, sisters, I&rsquo;m hoping that you <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will pray for my Persia to-night. </p>
<p>For I, who have suffered so much, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And know what the bitterness is, <br>
  Am sad to think sorrow must touch <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some day even darlings like this! <br>
  But sorrow is part of this life, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, therefore, a father doth long <br>
  For the blessing of mother and wife <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bird he has put in a song. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Lilith"></a>Lilith</b></h2>
<p>Strange is the song, and the soul that is singing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falters because of the vision it sees; <br>
  Voice that is not of the living is ringing <br>
  Down in the depths where the darkness is clinging, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when Noon is the lord of the leas, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast, like a curse, to the ghosts of the trees! </p>
<p>Here in a mist that is parted in sunder, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half with the darkness and half with the day; <br>
  Face of a woman, but face of a wonder, <br>
  Vivid and wild as a flame of the thunder, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashes and fades, and the wail of the grey <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water is loud on the straits of the bay! </p>
<p>Father, whose years have been many and weary &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elder, whose life is as lovely as light <br>
  Shining in ways that are sterile and dreary &mdash; <br>
  Tell me the name of this beautiful peri, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashing on me like the wonderful white <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Star, at the meeting of morning and night. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Look to thy Saviour, and down on thy knee, man, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lean on the Lord, as the Zebedee leaned; <br>
  Daughter of hell is the neighbour of thee, man &mdash; <br>
  Lilith, of Adam the luminous leman! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn to the Christ to be succoured and screened, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saved from the eyes of a marvellous fiend! </p>
<p>&ldquo;Serpent she is in the shape of a woman, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brighter than woman, ineffably fair! <br>
  Shelter thyself from the splendour, and sue, man; <br>
  Light that was never a loveliness human <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives in the face of this sinister snare, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Longing to strangle thy soul with her hair! </p>
<p>&ldquo;Lilith, who came to the father and bound him <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast with her eyes in the first of the springs; <br>
  Lilith she is, but remember she drowned him, <br>
  Shedding her flood of gold tresses around him &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lulled him to sleep with the lyric she sings: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melody strange with unspeakable things! </p>
<p>&ldquo;Low is her voice, but beware of it ever, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift bitter death is the fruit of delay; <br>
  Never was song of its beauty &mdash; ah! never &mdash; <br>
  Heard on the mountain, or meadow, or river, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not of the night is it, not of the day &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly from it, stranger, away and away.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Back on the hills are the blossom and feather, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory of noon is on valley and spire; <br>
  Here is the grace of magnificent weather, <br>
  Where is the woman from gulfs of the nether? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the fiend with the face of desire? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone, with a cry, in miraculous fire! </p>
<p>Sound that was not of this world, or the spacious <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splendid blue heaven, has passed from the lea; <br>
  Dead is the voice of the devil audacious: <br>
  Only a dream is her music fallacious, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in the song and the shadow of tree, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down by the green and the gold of the sea. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Bob"></a>Bob</b></h2>
<p>Singer of songs of the hills &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamer, by waters unstirred, <br>
  Back in a valley of rills, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home of the leaf and the bird! &mdash; <br>
  Read in this fall of the year <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the compassionate phrase, <br>
  Faded with traces of tear, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written in far-away days: </p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gone is the light  of my lap <br>
  </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(Lord, at Thy  bidding I bow), <br>
    Here is my little one&rsquo;s cap, <br>
  </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>He has no  need of it now, <br>
    Give it to somebody&rsquo;s boy &mdash; <br>
  </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Somebody&rsquo;s  darling</i>&rdquo; &mdash; she wrote. <br>
  Touching was Bob in his joy &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob without boots or a coat. </p>
<p>Only a cap; but it gave <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capless and comfortless one <br>
  Happiness, bright as the brave, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful light of the sun. <br>
  Soft may the sanctified sod <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest on the father who led <br>
  Bob from the gutter, unshod &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered his cold little head! </p>
<p>Bob from the foot to the crown <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measured a yard, and no more &mdash; <br>
  Baby alone in the town, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeless, and hungry, and sore &mdash; <br>
  Child that was never a child, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiding away from the rain, <br>
  Draggled and dirty and wild, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down in a pipe of the drain. </p>
<p>Poor little beggar was Bob &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Couldn&rsquo;t afford to be sick, <br>
  Getting a penny a job, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes a curse and a kick. <br>
  Father was killed by the drink; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother was driven to shame; <br>
  Bob couldn&rsquo;t manage to think &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had forgotten their name. </p>
<p>God was in heaven above, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers illumined the ground, <br>
  Women of infinite love <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lived in the palaces round &mdash; <br>
  Saints with the character sweet <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found in the fathers of old, <br>
  Laboured in alley and street &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baby slept out in the cold. </p>
<p>Nobody noticed the child &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knew of the mite <br>
  Creeping about like a wild <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thing in the shadow of night. <br>
  Beaten by drunkards and cowed &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frightened to speak or to sob &mdash; <br>
  How could he ask you aloud, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Have you a penny  for Bob?</i>&rdquo; </p>
<p>Few were the pennies he got &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seldom could hide them away, <br>
  Watched by the ravenous sot <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever at wait for his prey. <br>
  Poor little man! He would weep <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft for a morsel of bread; <br>
  Coppers he wanted to keep <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went to the tavern instead. </p>
<p>This was his history, friend &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ragged, unhoused, and alone; <br>
  How could the child comprehend <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love that he never had known? <br>
  Hunted about in the world, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crouching in crevices dim, <br>
  Crust with a curse at him hurled <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood for a kindness with him. </p>
<p>Little excited his joy &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bun after doing a job; <br>
  Mother of bright-headed boy, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the motherless Bob! <br>
  High in the heavens august <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providence saw him, and said &mdash; <br>
  &ldquo;<i>Out of the pits of the dust <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift him, and cover his head</i>.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Ah, the ineffable grace, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father of children, in Thee! <br>
  Boy in a radiant place, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fanned by the breeze of the sea &mdash; <br>
  Child on a lullaby lap <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, in the pause of his pain, <br>
  &ldquo;<i>Mother, don&rsquo;t bury my cap &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give it to Bob in the lane</i>.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Beautiful bidding of Death! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What could she do but obey, <br>
  Even when suffering Faith <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hadn&rsquo;t the power to pray? <br>
  So, in the fall of the year, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint with the fatherly head <br>
  Hunted for somebody&rsquo;s dear &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Somebody&rsquo;s  darling</i>,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>Bob, who was nobody&rsquo;s child, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting on nobody&rsquo;s lap, <br>
  Draggled and dirty and wild &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob got the little one&rsquo;s cap. <br>
  Strange were compassionate words! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waif of the alley and lane <br>
  Dreamed of the music of birds <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating about in the rain. </p>
<p>White-headed father in God, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over thy beautiful grave <br>
  Green is the grass of the sod, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft is the sound of the wave. <br>
  Down by the slopes of the sea <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often and often will sob <br>
  Boy who was fostered by thee &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the story of Bob. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="PeterThePicaninny"></a>Peter The Picaninny</b></h2>
<p>He has a name which can&rsquo;t be brought <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the sphere of metre; <br>
  But, as he&rsquo;s Peter by report, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll trot him out as Peter. </p>
<p>I call him mine; but don&rsquo;t suppose <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I&rsquo;m his dad, O reader! <br>
  My wife has got a Norman nose &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reads the tales of Ouida. </p>
<p>I never loved a nigger belle &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My tastes are too aesthetic! <br>
  The perfume from a gin is &mdash; well, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rather strong emetic. </p>
<p>But, seeing that my theme is Pete, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This verse will be the neater <br>
  If I keep on the proper beat, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stick throughout to Peter. </p>
<p>We picked him up the Lord knows where! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At noon we came across him <br>
  Asleep beside a hunk of bear &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His paunch was bulged with &rsquo;possum. </p>
<p>(Last stanza will not bear, I own, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pressure analytic; <br>
  But bard whose weight is fourteen stone, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is apt to thump the critic.) </p>
<p>We asked the kid to give his name: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t seem too willing &mdash; <br>
  The darkey played the darkey&rsquo;s game &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tipped him with a shilling! </p>
<p>We tipped him with a shining bob &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Tommy Dodd, believe us. <br>
  We didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;tumble&rdquo; to his job &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, why did Pete deceive us! </p>
<p>I, being, as I&rsquo;ve said, a bard, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved at once to foster <br>
  This mite whose length was just a yard &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This portable impostor! </p>
<p>&ldquo;This babe&rdquo; &mdash; I spoke in Wordsworth&rsquo;s tone &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(See Wordsworth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lucy&rdquo;, neighbour) <br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a darling of my own; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he&rsquo;ll repay my labour. </p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll grow as gentle as a fawn &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As quiet as the blossoms <br>
  That beautify a land of lawn &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll eat no more opossums. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The child I to myself will take <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a paternal manner; <br>
  And ah! he will not swallow snake <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, or &lsquo;goanna&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you reside with me, my dear?&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked in accents mellow &mdash; <br>
  The nigger grinned from ear to ear, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, &ldquo;All right, old fellow!&rdquo; </p>
<p>And so my Pete was taken home &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pretty piccaninny! <br>
  And, not to speak of soap or comb, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cleansing cost a guinea. </p>
<p>&ldquo;But hang expenses!&rdquo; I exclaimed, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him education: <br>
  A &lsquo;nig&rsquo; is better when he&rsquo;s tamed, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, than a Caucasian. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethnologists are in the wrong <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About our sable brothers; <br>
  And I intend to stop the song <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Pickering and others.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Alas, I didn&rsquo;t do it though! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Pickering&rsquo;s conclusions <br>
  Were to the point, as issues show, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mine were mere delusions. </p>
<p>My inky pet was clothed and fed <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For months exceeding forty; <br>
  But to the end, it must be said, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ways were very naughty. </p>
<p>When told about the Land of Morn <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above this world of Mammon, <br>
  He&rsquo;d shout, with an emphatic scorn, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah, gammon, gammon, gammon!&rdquo; </p>
<p>He never lingered, like the bard, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sniff at rose expanding. <br>
  &ldquo;Me like,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;em cattle-yard &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fine smell &mdash; de smell of branding!&rdquo; </p>
<p>The soul of man, I tried to show, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went up beyond our vision. <br>
  &ldquo;You ebber see dat fellow go?&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked in sheer derision. </p>
<p>In short, it soon occurred to me <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kid of six or seven, <br>
  Who wouldn&rsquo;t learn his A B C, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hardly ripe for heaven. </p>
<p>He never lost his appetite &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bigger grew, and bigger; <br>
  And proved, with every inch of height, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nigger is a nigger. </p>
<p>And, looking from this moment back, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a strong persuasion <br>
  That, after all, a finished black <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not the &ldquo;clean&rdquo; &mdash; Caucasian. </p>
<p>Dear Peter from my threshold went, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One morning in the body: <br>
  He &ldquo;dropped&rdquo; me, to oblige a gent &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gent with spear and waddy! </p>
<p>He shelved me for a boomerang &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We never had a quarrel; <br>
  And, if a moral here doth hang, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why let it hang &mdash; the moral! </p>
<p>My mournful tale its course has run &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Pete, when last I spied him, <br>
  Was eating &rsquo;possum underdone: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had his gin beside him. </p>

<p align="center" class="note"><i>(Written in the Shadow of 1872)</i></p>
<p>From the rainy hill-heads, where, in starts and in spasms, <br>
  Leaps wild the white torrent from chasms to chasms &mdash; <br>
  From the home of bold echoes, whose voices of wonder <br>
  Fly out of blind caverns struck black by high thunder &mdash; <br>
  Through gorges august, in whose nether recesses <br>
  Is heard the far psalm of unseen wildernesses &mdash; <br>
  Like a dominant spirit, a strong-handed sharer <br>
  Of spoil with the tempest, comes down the Narrara. </p>
<p>Yea, where the great sword of the hurricane cleaveth <br>
  The forested fells that the dark never leaveth &mdash; <br>
  By fierce-featured crags, in whose evil abysses <br>
  The clammy snake coils, and the flat adder hisses &mdash; <br>
  Past lordly rock temples, where Silence is riven <br>
  By the anthems supreme of the four winds of heaven &mdash; <br>
  It speeds, with the cry of the streams of the fountains <br>
  It chained to its sides, and dragged down from the mountains! </p>
<p>But when it goes forth from the slopes with a sally &mdash; <br>
  Being strengthened with tribute from many a valley &mdash; <br>
  It broadens and brightens, and thereupon marches <br>
  Above the stream sapphires and under green arches, <br>
  With the rhythm of majesty &mdash; careless of cumber &mdash; <br>
  Its might in repose and its fierceness in slumber &mdash; <br>
  Till it beams on the plains, where the wind is a bearer <br>
  Of words from the sea to the stately Narrara! </p>
<p>Narrara! grand son of the haughty hill torrent, <br>
  Too late in my day have I looked at thy current &mdash; <br>
  Too late in my life to discern and inherit <br>
  The soul of thy beauty, the joy of thy spirit! <br>
  With the years of the youth and the hairs of the hoary, <br>
  I sit like a shadow outside of thy glory; <br>
  Nor look with the morning-like feelings, O river, <br>
  That illumined the boy in the days gone for ever! </p>
<p>Ah! sad are the sounds of old ballads which borrow <br>
  One-half of their grief from the listener&rsquo;s sorrow; <br>
  And sad are the eyes of the pilgrim who traces <br>
  The ruins of Time in revisited places; <br>
  But sadder than all is the sense of his losses <br>
  That cometh to one when a sudden age crosses <br>
  And cripples his manhood. So, stricken by fate, I <br>
  Felt older at thirty than some do at eighty. </p>
<p>Because I believe in the beautiful story, <br>
  The poem of Greece in the days of her glory &mdash; <br>
  That the high-seated Lord of the woods and the waters <br>
  Has peopled His world with His deified daughters &mdash; <br>
  That flowerful forests and waterways streaming <br>
  Are gracious with goddesses glowing and gleaming &mdash; <br>
  I pray that thy singing divinity, fairer <br>
  Than wonderful women, may listen, Narrara! </p>
<p>O spirit of sea-going currents! &mdash; thou, being <br>
  The child of immortals, all-knowing, all-seeing &mdash; <br>
  Thou hast at thy heart the dark truth that I borrow <br>
  For the song that I sing thee, no fanciful sorrow; <br>
  In the sight of thine eyes is the history written <br>
  Of Love smitten down as the strong leaf is smitten; <br>
  And before thee there goeth a phantom beseeching <br>

<p>Thou knowest, O sister of deities blazing <br>
  With splendour ineffable, beauty amazing, <br>
  What life the gods gave me &mdash; what largess I tasted &mdash; <br>
  The youth thrown away, and the faculties wasted. <br>
  I might, as thou seest, have stood in high places, <br>
  Instead of in pits where the brand of disgrace is, <br>
  A byword for scoffers &mdash; a butt and a caution, <br>
  With the grave of poor Burns and Maginn for my portion. </p>
<p>But the heart of the Father Supreme is offended, <br>
  And my life in the light of His favour is ended; <br>
  And, whipped by inflexible devils, I shiver, <br>
  With a hollow &ldquo;<i>too late</i>&rdquo; in my  hearing for ever; <br>
  But thou &mdash; being sinless, exalted, supernal, <br>
  The daughter of diademed gods, the eternal &mdash; <br>
  Shalt shine in thy waters when time and existence <br>
  Have dwindled, like stars, in unspeakable distance. </p>
<p>But the face of thy river &mdash; the torrented power <br>
  That smites at the rock while it fosters the flower &mdash; <br>
  Shall gleam in my dreams with the summer-look splendid, <br>
  And the beauty of woodlands and waterfalls blended; <br>
  And often I&rsquo;ll think of far-forested noises, <br>
  And the emphasis deep of grand sea-going voices, <br>
  And turn to Narrara the eyes of a lover, <br>
  When the sorrowful days of my singing are over. </p>

<p>Because this man fulfilled his days, <br>
  Like one who walks with steadfast gaze <br>
  Averted from forbidden ways <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lures of fair, false flowerage deep, <br>
  Behold the Lord whose throne is dim <br>
  With fires of flaming seraphim &mdash; <br>

<p>Not human sleep &mdash; the fitful rest <br>
  With evil shapes of dreams distressed, &mdash; <br>
  But perfect quiet, unexpressed <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By any worldly word we keep. <br>
  The dim Hereafter framed in creeds <br>
  May not be this; but He who reads <br>
  Our lives, sets flowers on wayside weeds &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He giveth His beloved sleep.&rdquo; </p>

<p>That fair, rare spirit, Honour, throws <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The son whose ashes it doth keep; <br>
  And, like far music, <i>this</i> is heard &mdash; <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;He giveth His beloved sleep.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p>He earned his place. Within his hands, <br>
  The power which counsels and commands, <br>
  And shapes the social life of lands, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Became a blessing pure and deep. *<br>
  Through thirty years of turbulence <br>

<p align="center" class="note"><i>The poet&rsquo;s daughter, who died in infancy.</i></p>
<p>Take this rose, and very gently place it on the tender,  deep <br>
  Mosses where our little darling, Araluen, lies asleep. <br>
  Put the blossom close to baby &mdash; kneel with me, my love, and pray; <br>
  We must leave the bird we&rsquo;ve buried &mdash; say good-bye to her to-day. <br>
  In the shadow of our trouble we must go to other lands, <br>
  And the flowers we have fostered will be left to other hands: <br>
  Other eyes will watch them growing &mdash; other feet will softly tread <br>
  Where two hearts are nearly breaking, where so many tears are shed. <br>
  Bitter is the world we live in: life and love are mixed with pain; <br>
  We will never see these daisies &mdash; never water them again. </p>
<p>Ah! the saddest thought in leaving baby in this bush alone <br>
  Is that we have not been able on her grave to place a stone: <br>
  We have been too poor to do it; but, my darling, never mind &mdash; <br>
  God is in the gracious heavens, and His sun and rain are kind: <br>
  They will dress the spot with beauty, they will make the grasses grow: <br>
  Many winds will lull our birdie, many songs will come and go. <br>
  Here the blue-eyed Spring will linger, here the shining month will stay, <br>
  Like a friend, by Araluen, when we two are far away; <br>
  But beyond the wild, wide waters, we will tread another shore &mdash; <br>
  We will never watch this blossom, never see it any more. </p>
<p>Girl, whose hand at God&rsquo;s high altar in the dear, dead  year I pressed, <br>
  Lean your stricken head upon me &mdash; this is still your lover&rsquo;s breast! <br>
  She who sleeps was first and sweetest &mdash; none we have to take her place; <br>
  Empty is the little cradle &mdash; absent is the little face. <br>
  Other children may be given; but this rose beyond recall, <br>
  But this garland of your girlhood, will be dearest of them all. <br>
  None will ever, Araluen, nestle where you used to be, <br>
  In my heart of hearts, you darling, when the world was new to me; <br>
  We were young when you were with us, life and love were happy things <br>
  To your father and your mother ere the angels gave you wings. </p>
<p>You that sit and sob beside me &mdash; you, upon whose golden  head <br>
  Many rains of many sorrows have from day to day been shed; <br>
  Who because your love was noble, faced with me the lot austere <br>
  Ever pressing with its hardship on the man of letters here &mdash; <br>
  Let me feel that you are near me, lay your hand within mine own; <br>
  You are all I have to live for, now that we are left alone. <br>
  Three there were, but one has vanished. Sins of mine have made you weep; <br>
  But forgive your baby&rsquo;s father now that baby is asleep. <br>
  Let us go, for night is falling; leave the darling with her flowers; <br>
  Other hands will come and tend them &mdash; other friends in other hours. </p>

  A shining foot on hills of wind and wet &mdash; <br>
  Far haughty hills beyond the fountains cold <br>
  And dells of glimmering greenness manifold &mdash; <br>

  And in the calm is heard September&rsquo;s wing, <br>

  High, deathless radiance &mdash; crowned Calliope! <br>
  What though we never hear the great god&rsquo;s lays <br>
  Which made all music the Hellenic days &mdash; <br>
  What though the face of thy fair heaven beams <br>
  Still only on the crystal Grecian streams &mdash; <br>
  What though a sky of new, strange beauty shines <br>
  Where no white Dryad sings within the pines: <br>
  Here is a land whose large, imperial grace <br>
  Must tempt thee, goddess, in thine holy place! <br>
  Here are the dells of peace and plenilune, <br>
  The hills of morning and the slopes of noon; <br>
  Here are the waters dear to days of blue, <br>
  And dark-green hollows of the noontide dew; <br>

  And shall Australia, framed and set in sea, <br>
  August with glory, wait in vain for thee? <br>
  Shall more than Tempe&rsquo;s beauty be unsung <br>
  Because its shine is strange &mdash; its colours young? <br>
  No! by the full, live light which puts to shame <br>
  The far, fair splendours of Thessalian flame &mdash; <br>
  By yonder forest psalm which sinks and swells <br>
  Like that of Phocis, grave with oracles &mdash; <br>
  By deep prophetic winds that come and go <br>
  Where whispering springs of pondering mountains flow &mdash; <br>
  By lute-like leaves and many-languaged caves, <br>
  Where sounds the strong hosanna of the waves, <br>
  This great new majesty shall not remain <br>
  Unhonoured by the high immortal strain! <br>
  Soon, soon, the music of the southern lyre <br>
  Shall start and blossom with a speech like fire! <br>
  Soon, soon, shall flower and flow in flame divine <br>
  Thy songs, Apollo, and Euterpe, thine! <br>
  Strong, shining sons of Delphicus shall rise <br>
  With all their father&rsquo;s glory in their eyes; <br>
  And then shall beam on yonder slopes and springs <br>
  The light that swims upon the light of things. <br>
  And therefore, lingering in a land of lawn, <br>
  I, standing here, a singer of the dawn, <br>
  With gaze upturned to where wan summits lie <br>
  Against the morning flowing up the sky &mdash; <br>
  Whose eyes in dreams of many colours see <br>
  A glittering vision of the years to be &mdash; <br>
  Do ask of thee, Calliope, one hour <br>
  Of life pre-eminent with perfect power, <br>
  That I may leave a song whose lonely rays <br>
  May shine hereafter from these songless days. </p>
<p>For now there breaks across the faint grey range <br>
  The rose-red dawning of a radiant change. <br>
  A soft, sweet voice is in the valleys deep, <br>
  Where darkness droops and sings itself to sleep. <br>
  The grave, mute woods, that yet the silence hold <br>
  Of dim, dead ages, gleam with hints of gold. <br>

  A twofold tower above the whistling cave &mdash; <br>
  Whose strength in thunder shields the gentle lea, <br>
  And makes a white wrath of a league of sea, <br>
  Now wears the face of peace; and in the bay <br>
  The weak, spent voice of Winter dies away. <br>
  In every dell there is a whispering wing, <br>
  On every lawn a glimmer of the Spring; <br>
  By every hill are growths of tender green &mdash; <br>
  On every slope a fair, new life is seen; <br>
  And lo! beneath the morning&rsquo;s blossoming fires, <br>
  The shining city of a hundred spires, <br>
  In mists of gold, by countless havens furled, <br>
  And glad with all the flags of all the world! </p>
<p>These are the shores, where, in a dream of fear, <br>
  Cathay saw darkness dwelling half the year! *<br>
  These are the coasts that old fallacious tales <br>
  Chained down with ice and ringed with sleepless gales! <br>

<p>Far in the west, beyond those hills sublime, <br>
  Dirk Hartog anchored in the olden time; <br>

  Sailed Tasman down a great and glowing space <br>
  Whose softer lights were like his lady&rsquo;s face. <br>
  In dreams of her he roved from zone to zone, <br>

  Where in low heavens hangs a fourfold moon.<br>
  Here, on the tides of a resplendent year, <br>
  By capes of jasper, came the buccaneer. <br>
  Then, then, the wild men, flying from the beach, <br>

  Near yonder wall of stately cliff, that braves <br>

  Who in the last hour showed the Christian face <br>
  Whose crumbling beauty shamed the alien race. <br>
  In peace he sleeps where deep eternal calms <br>
  Lie round the land of heavy-fruited palms. <br>
  Lo! in that dell, behind a singing bar, <br>

  Beyond a mossy, yellow, gleaming glade, <br>
  The last of Forby Sutherland was laid &mdash; <br>
  The blue-eyed Saxon from the hills of snow <br>
  Who fell asleep a hundred years ago. <br>

  Far, far away, beneath some northern sky <br>
  The fathers of his humble household lie; <br>

  And gracious woodlands, where the fire-fly gleams; <br>
  And ever comes across a silver lea <br>
  The hymn sublime of the eternal sea. </p>
<p>On that bold hill, against a broad blue stream, <br>
  Stood Arthur Phillip in a day of dream: <br>
  What time the mists of morning westward rolled, <br>
  And heaven flowered on a bay of gold! <br>
  Here, in the hour that shines and sounds afar, <br>
  Flamed first old England&rsquo;s banner like a star; <br>
  Here, in a time august with prayer and praise, <br>
  Was born the nation of these splendid days; <br>
  And here this land&rsquo;s majestic yesterday <br>
  Of immemorial silence died away. </p>
<p>Where are the woods that, ninety summers back, <br>
  Stood hoar with ages by the water-track? <br>
  Where are the valleys of the flashing wing, <br>
  The dim green margins and the glimmering spring? <br>
  Where now the warrior of the forest race, <br>
  His glaring war-paint and his fearless face? <br>
  The banks of April and the groves of bird, <br>
  The glades of silence and the pools unstirred, <br>
  The gleaming savage and the whistling spear, <br>
  Passed with the passing of a wild old year! <br>
  A single torrent singing by the wave, <br>
  A shadowy relic in a mountain cave, <br>
  A ghost of fire in immemorial hills, <br>
  The whittled tree by folded wayside rills, <br>
  The call of bird that hides in hollows far, <br>
  Where feet of thunder, wings of winter are &mdash; <br>
  Of all that Past, these wrecks of wind and rain, <br>
  These touching memories &mdash; these alone remain! </p>
<p>What sun is this that beams and broadens west? <br>
  What wonder this, in deathless glory dressed? <br>
  What strange, sweet harp of highest god took flame <br>
  And gave this Troy its life, its light, its name? <br>
  What awful lyre of marvellous power and range <br>
  Upraised this Ilion &mdash; wrought this dazzling change? <br>
  No shining singer of Hellenic dreams <br>
  Set yonder splendour by the morning streams! <br>
  No god who glimmers in a doubtful sphere <br>
  Shed glory there &mdash; created beauty here! <br>
  This is the city that our fathers framed &mdash; <br>
  These are the crescents by the elders named! <br>
  The human hands of strong, heroic men <br>
  Broke down the mountain, filled the gaping glen, <br>
  Ran streets through swamp, built banks against the foam, <br>
  And bent the arch and raised the lordly dome! <br>
  Here are the towers that the founders made! <br>
  Here are the temples where these Romans prayed! <br>
  Here stand the courts in which their leaders met! <br>
  Here are their homes, and here their altars yet! <br>
  Here sleep the grand old men whose lives sublime <br>
  Of thought and action shine and sound through time! <br>
  Who worked in darkness &mdash; onward fought their ways <br>
  To bring about these large majestic days &mdash; <br>
  Who left their sons the hearts and high desires <br>
  Which built this city of the hundred spires! </p>
<p>A stately Morning rises on the wing, <br>
  The hills take colour, and the valleys sing. <br>
  A strong September flames beyond the lea &mdash; <br>
  A silver vision on a silver sea. <br>
  A new Age, &ldquo;cast in a diviner mould&rdquo;, <br>
  Comes crowned with lustre, zoned and shod with gold! <br>
  What dream is this on lawny spaces set? <br>
  What miracle of dome and minaret? <br>
  What great mute majesty is this that takes <br>
  The first of morning ere the song-bird wakes? <br>
  Lo, this was built to honour gathering lands <br>
  By Celtic, Saxon, Australasian hands! <br>

  And proud Iberia leaves the grape-flushed vale. <br>
  Here are the lords whose starry banner shines <br>
  From fierce Magellan to the Arctic pines. <br>
  Here come the strangers from the gates of day &mdash; <br>
  From hills of sunrise and from white Cathay. <br>
  The spicy islands send their swarthy sons, <br>
  The lofty North its mailed and mighty ones. <br>
  Venetian keels are floating on our sea; <br>
  Our eyes are glad with radiant Italy! <br>
  Yea, North and South, and glowing West and East, <br>
  Are gathering here to grace our splendid feast! <br>

  The elders born where regal roses grow, <br>

  That blooms beyond the fiery tracts of sand <br>
  Where Syrian suns their angry lustres fling <br>
  Across blind channels of the bygone spring. <br>
  And on this great, auspicious day, the flowers <br>
  Of labour glorify majestic hours. <br>
  The singing angel from the starry sphere <br>
  Of dazzling Science shows his wonders here; <br>
  And Art, the dream-clad spirit, starts, and brings <br>
  From Fairyland her strange, sweet, glittering things. <br>
  Here are the works man did, what time his face <br>
  Was touched by God in some exalted place; <br>
  Here glows the splendour &mdash; here the marvel wrought <br>
  When Heaven flashed upon the maker&rsquo;s thought! <br>
  Yea, here are all the miracles sublime &mdash; <br>
  The lights of Genius and the stars of Time! <br>
  And, being lifted by this noble noon, <br>
  Australia broadens like a tropic moon. <br>
  Her white, pure lustre beams across the zones; <br>
  The nations greet her from their awful thrones. <br>
  From hence the morning beauty of her name <br>
  Will shine afar, like an exceeding flame. <br>
  Her place will be with mighty lords, whose sway <br>
  Controls the thunder and the marching day. <br>
  Her crown will shine beside the crowns of kings <br>
  Who shape the seasons, rule the course of things, <br>
  The fame of her across the years to be <br>
  Will spread like light on a surpassing sea; <br>
  And graced with glory, girt with power august, <br>
  Her life will last till all things turn to dust. </p>
<p>To Thee the face of song is lifted now, <br>
  O Lord! to whom the awful mountains bow; <br>
  Whose hands, unseen, the tenfold storms control; <br>
  Whose thunders shake the spheres from pole to pole; <br>
  Who from Thy highest heaven lookest down, <br>
  The sea Thy footstool, and the sun Thy crown; <br>
  Around whose throne the deathless planets sing <br>
  Hosannas to their high, eternal King. <br>
  To Thee the soul of prayer this morning turns, <br>
  With faith that glitters, and with hope that burns! <br>
  And, in the moments of majestic calm <br>
  That fill the heart in pauses of the psalm, <br>
  She asks Thy blessing for this fair young land <br>
  That flowers within the hollow of Thine hand! <br>
  She seeks of Thee that boon, that gift sublime, <br>
  The Christian radiance, for this hope of Time! <br>
  And Thou wilt listen! and Thy face will bend <br>
  To smile upon us &mdash; Master, Father, Friend! <br>
  The Christ to whom pure pleading heart hath crept <br>
  Was human once, and in the darkness wept; <br>
  The gracious love that helped us long ago <br>
  Will on us like a summer sunrise flow, <br>
  And be a light to guide the nation&rsquo;s feet <br>
  On holy paths &mdash; on sacred ways and sweet. </p>

  And a thunder full of menace sends its mighty voices far! <br>
  <i>This</i> was where black execrations,  from some dark tribunal hurled, <br>
  Set the brand of curse on all things in the morning of the world! </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>One man yielded &mdash; then another &mdash; then a lad of nineteen  years <br>
  Reeled and fell, with English rivers singing softly in his ears, <br>
  English grasses started round him &mdash; then the grace of Sussex lea <br>
  Came and touched him with the beauty of a green land by the sea! <br>
  Old-world faces thronged about him &mdash; old-world voices spoke to him; <br>
  But his speech was like a whisper, and his eyes were very dim. <br>
  In a dream of golden evening, beaming on a quiet strand, <br>
  Lay the stranger till a bright One came and took him by the hand. <br>
  England vanished; died the voices; but he heard a holier tone, <br>
  And an angel that we know not led him to the lands unknown! </p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Six there were, but three were taken! Three were left to  struggle still; <br>
  But against the red horizon flamed a horn of brindled hill! <br>
  But beyond the northern skyline, past a wall of steep austere, <br>
  Lay the land of light and coolness in an April-coloured year! <br>
  &ldquo;Courage, brothers!&rdquo; cried the leader. &ldquo;On the slope of yonder peak <br>
  There are tracts of herb and shadow, and the channels of the creek!&rdquo; </p>
<p>So they made one last great effort &mdash; haled their beasts through  brake and briar, <br>
  Set their feet on spurs of furnace, grappled spikes and crags of fire, <br>
  Fought the stubborn mountain forces, smote down naked, natural powers, <br>
  Till they gazed from thrones of Morning on a sphere of streams and flowers. <br>
  Out behind them was the desert, glaring like a sea of brass! <br>
  Here before them were the valleys, fair with moonlight-coloured grass! <br>
  At their backs were haggard waste-lands, bickering in a wicked blaze! <br>
  In their faces beamed the waters, marching down melodious ways! <br>
  Touching was the cool, soft lustre over laps of lawn and lea; <br>
  And majestic was the great road Morning made across the sea. <br>
  On the sacred day of Christmas, after seven months of grief, <br>
  Rested three of six who started, on a bank of moss and leaf &mdash; <br>
  Rested by a running river, in a hushed, a holy week; <br>
  And they named the stream that saved them &mdash; named it fitly &mdash; &ldquo;Christmas Creek&rdquo;. </p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Orara"></a>Orara</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note"><i>A tributary of the river Clarence.</i></p>
<p>The strong sob of the chafing stream <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seaward fights its way <br>
  Down crags of glitter, dells of gleam, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is in the hills to-day. </p>
<p>But far and faint, a grey-winged form <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hangs where the wild lights wane &mdash; <br>
  The phantom of a bygone storm, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ghost of wind and rain. </p>
<p>The soft white feet of afternoon <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are on the shining meads, <br>
  The breeze is as a pleasant tune <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the happy reeds. </p>
<p>The fierce, disastrous, flying fire, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That made the great caves ring, <br>
  And scarred the slope, and broke the spire, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a forgotten thing. </p>
<p>The air is full of mellow sounds, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wet hill-heads are bright, <br>
  And down the fall of fragrant grounds, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep ways flame with light. </p>
<p>A rose-red space of stream I see, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past banks of tender fern; <br>
  A radiant brook, unknown to me <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond its upper turn. </p>
<p>The singing, silver life I hear, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose home is in the green, <br>
  Far-folded woods of fountains clear, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I have never been. </p>
<p>Ah, brook above the upper bend, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often long to stand <br>
  Where you in soft, cool shades descend <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the untrodden land! </p>
<p>Ah, folded woods, that hide the grace <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of moss and torrents strong, <br>
  I often wish to know the face <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that which sings your song! </p>
<p>But I may linger, long, and look <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till night is over all: <br>
  My eyes will never see the brook, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sweet, strange waterfall. </p>
<p>The world is round me with its heat, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And toil, and cares that tire; <br>
  I cannot with my feeble feet <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climb after my desire. </p>
<p>But, on the lap of lands unseen, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a secret zone, <br>
  There shine diviner gold and green <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than man has ever known. </p>
<p>And where the silver waters sing <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down hushed and holy dells, <br>
  The flower of a celestial Spring &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tenfold splendour, dwells. </p>
<p>Yea, in my dream of fall and brook <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By far sweet forests furled, <br>
  I see that light for which I look <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain through all the world &mdash; </p>
<p>The glory of a larger sky <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On slopes of hills sublime, <br>
  That speak with God and morning, high <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the ways of Time! </p>
<p>Ah! haply in this sphere of change <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where shadows spoil the beam, <br>
  It would not do to climb that range <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And test my radiant Dream. </p>
<p>The slightest glimpse of yonder place, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Untrodden and alone, <br>
  Might wholly kill that nameless grace, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charm of the unknown. </p>
<p>And therefore, though I look and long, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the lot is bright <br>
  Which keeps the river of the song <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beauty out of sight. </p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheCurseOfMotherFlood"></a>The Curse Of Mother Flood</h2>
<p>Wizened the wood is, and wan is the way through it; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White as a corpse is the face of the fen; <br>
  Only blue adders abide in and stray through it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adders and venom and horrors to men. <br>
  Here is the &ldquo;ghost of a garden&rdquo; whose minister <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fosters strange blossoms that startle and scare.<br>
  Red as man&rsquo;s blood is the sun that, with sinister <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flame, is a menace of hell in the air. <br>
  Wrinkled and haggard the hills are &mdash; the jags of them <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gape like to living and ominous things: <br>
  Storm and dry thunder cry out in the crags of them &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire, and the wind with a woe in its wings. </p>
<p>Never a moon without clammy-cold shroud on it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherward comes, or a flower-like star! <br>
  Only the hiss of the tempest is loud on it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiss, and the moan of a bitter sea bar. <br>
  Here on this waste, and to left and to right of it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never is lisp or the ripple of rain: <br>
  Fierce is the daytime and wild is the night of it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flame without limit and frost without wane! <br>
  Trees half alive, with the sense of a curse on them, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shudder and shrink from the black heavy gale; <br>
  Ghastly, with boughs like the plumes of a hearse on them: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barren of blossom and blasted with bale. </p>
<p>Under the cliff that stares down to the south of it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back by the horns of a hazardous hill, <br>
  Dumb is the gorge with a grave in the mouth of it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, as a corpse in a coffin is still. <br>
  Never there hovers a hope of the Spring by it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never a glimmer of yellow and green: <br>
  Only the bat with a whisper of wing by it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flits like a life out of flesh and unseen. <br>
  Here are the growths that are livid and glutinous, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speckled, and bloated with poisonous blood: <br>
  This is the haunt of the viper-breed mutinous: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursed with the curse of weird Catherine Flood. </p>
<p>He that hath looked on it &mdash; hurried aghast from it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hair of him frozen with horror straightway, <br>
  Chased by a sudden strange pestilent blast from it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the speech of him &mdash; what can he say? <br>
  Hath he not seen the fierce ghost of a hag in it? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard maledictions that startle the stars? <br>
  Dumb is his mouth as a mouth with a gag in it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mute is his life as a life within bars. <br>
  Just the one glimpse of that grey, shrieking woman there <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ringed by a circle of furnace and fiend! <br>
  He that went happy and healthy and human there &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where shall the white leper fly to be cleaned? </p>
<p>Here, in a pit with indefinite doom on it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in the fumes of a feculent moat, <br>
  Under an alp with inscrutable gloom on it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squats the wild witch with a ghoul at her throat! <br>
  Black execration that cannot be spoken of &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speech of red hell that would suffocate Song, <br>
  Starts from this terror with never a token of <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day and its loveliness all the year long. <br>
  Sin without name to it &mdash; man never heard of it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crime that would startle a fiend from his lair, <br>
  Blasted this Glen, and the leaf and the bird of it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Where is there  hope for it, Father, O where? </i></p>
<p>Far in the days of our fathers, the life in it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blossomed and beamed in the sight of the sun: <br>
  Yellow and green and the purple were rife in it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singers of morning and waters that run. <br>
  Storm of the equinox shed no distress on it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thunder spoke softly, and summer-time left <br>
  Sunset&rsquo;s forsaken bright beautiful dress on it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessing that shone half the night in the cleft. <br>
  Hymns of the highlands &mdash; hosannas from hills by it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psalms of great forests made holy the spot: <br>
  Cool were the mosses and clear were the rills by it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far in the days when the Horror was not. </p>
<p>Twenty miles south is the strong, shining Hawkesbury &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spacious and splendid, and lordly with blooms. <br>
  There, between mountains magnificent, walks bury <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miles of their beauty in green myrtle glooms. <br>
  There, in the dell, is the fountain with falls by it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falls, and a torrent of summering stream: <br>
  There is the cave with the hyaline halls by it &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haunt of the echo and home of the dream. <br>
  Over the hill, by the marvellous base of it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanders the wind with a song in its breath <br>
  Out to the sea with the gold on the face of it &mdash; <br>
  Twenty miles south of the Valley of Death. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="OnASpanishCathedral"></a>On A Spanish Cathedral</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note"><i>Every Expression in these stanza&rsquo;s may fairly be claimed by the Hon.  W. B. Dalley (Author&rsquo;s note). </i></p>
<p>Deep under the spires of a hill, by the feet of the  thunder-cloud trod, <br>
  I pause in a luminous, still, magnificent temple of God! <br>
  At the steps of the altar august &mdash; a vision of angels in stone &mdash; <br>
  I kneel, with my head to the dust, on the floors by the seraphim known. <br>
  No father in Jesus is near, with the high, the compassionate face; <br>
  But the glory of Godhead is here &mdash; its presence transfigures the place! <br>
  Behold in this beautiful fane, with the lights of blue heaven impearled, <br>
  I think of the Elders of Spain, in the deserts &mdash; the wilds of the world! </p>
<p>I think of the wanderers poor who knelt on the flints and  the sands, <br>
  When the mighty and merciless Moor was lord of the Lady of Lands. <br>
  Where the African scimitar flamed, with a swift, bitter death in its kiss, <br>
  The fathers, unknown and unnamed, found God in cathedrals like this! <br>
  The glow of His Spirit &mdash; the beam of His blessing &mdash; made lords of the men <br>
  Whose food was the herb of the stream, whose roof was the dome of the den. <br>
  And, far in the hills by the sea, these awful hierophants prayed <br>
  For Rome and its temples to be &mdash; in a temple by Deity made. </p>
<p>Who knows of their faith &mdash; of its power? Perhaps, with the  light in their eyes, <br>
  They saw, in some wonderful hour, the marvel of centuries rise! <br>
  Perhaps in some moment supreme, when the mountains were holy and still, <br>
  They dreamed the magnificent dream that came to the monks of Seville! <br>
  Surrounded by pillars and spires whose summits shone out in the glare <br>
  Of the high, the omnipotent fires, who knows what was seen by them there? <br>
  Be sure, if they saw, in the noon of their faith, some ineffable fane, <br>
  They looked on the church like a moon dropped down by the Lord into Spain. </p>
<p>And the Elders who shone in the time when Christ over  Christendom beamed <br>
  May have dreamed at their altars sublime the dream that their fathers had  dreamed, <br>
  By the glory of Italy moved &mdash; the majesty shining in Rome &mdash; <br>
  They turned to the land that they loved, and prayed for a church in their home; <br>
  And a soul of unspeakable fire descended on them, and they fought <br>
  And laboured a life for the spire and tower and dome of their thought! <br>
  These grew under blessing and praise, as morning in summertime grows &mdash; <br>
  As Troy in the dawn of the days to the music of Delphicus rose. </p>
<p>In a land of bewildering light, where the feet of the  season are Spring&rsquo;s, <br>
  They worked in the day and the night, surrounded by beautiful things. <br>
  The wonderful blossoms in stone &mdash; the flower and leaf of the Moor, <br>
  On column and cupola shone, and gleamed on the glimmering floor. <br>
  In a splendour of colour and form, from the marvellous African&rsquo;s hands <br>
  Yet vivid and shining and warm, they planted the Flower of the Lands. <br>
  Inspired by the patience supreme of the mute, the magnificent past, <br>
  They toiled till the dome of their dream in the firmament blossomed at last! </p>
<p>Just think of these men &mdash; of their time &mdash; of the days of  their deed, and the scene! <br>
  How touching their zeal &mdash; how sublime their suppression of self must have been! <br>
  In a city yet hacked by the sword and scarred by the flame of the Moor, <br>
  They started the work of their Lord, sad, silent, and solemnly poor. <br>
  These fathers, how little they thought of themselves, and how much of the days <br>
  When the children of men would be brought to pray in their temple, and praise! <br>
  Ah! full of the radiant, still, heroic old life that has flown, <br>
  The merciful monks of Seville toiled on, and died bare and unknown. </p>
<p>The music, the colour, the gleam of their mighty cathedral  will be <br>
  Hereafter a luminous dream of the heaven I never may see; <br>
  To a spirit that suffers and seeks for the calm of a competent creed, <br>
  This temple, whose majesty speaks, becomes a religion indeed; <br>
  The passionate lights &mdash; the intense, the ineffable beauty of sound &mdash; <br>
  Go straight to the heart through the sense, as a song would of seraphim  crowned. <br>
  And lo! by these altars august, the life that is highest we live, <br>
  And are filled with the infinite trust and the peace that the world cannot  give. </p>
<p>They have passed, have the elders of time &mdash; they have  gone; but the work of their hands, <br>
  Pre-eminent, peerless, sublime, like a type of eternity stands! <br>
  They are mute, are the fathers who made this church in the century dim; <br>
  But the dome with their beauty arrayed remains, a perpetual hymn. <br>
  Their names are unknown; but so long as the humble in spirit and pure <br>
  Are worshipped in speech and in song, our love for these monks will endure; <br>
  And the lesson by sacrifice taught will live in the light of the years <br>
  With a reverence not to be bought, and a tenderness deeper than tears. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Rover"></a>Rover</b></h2>
<p>No classic warrior tempts my pen <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fill with verse these pages &mdash; <br>
  No lordly-hearted man of men <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Muse&rsquo;s thought engages. </p>
<p>Let others choose the mighty dead, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing their battles over! <br>
  My champion, too, has fought and bled &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My theme is one-eyed Rover. </p>
<p>A grave old dog, with tattered ears <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too sore to cock up, reader! &mdash; <br>
  A four-legged hero, full of years, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sturdy as a cedar. </p>
<p>Still, age is age; and if my rhyme <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is dashed with words pathetic, <br>
  Don&rsquo;t wonder, friend; I&rsquo;ve seen the time <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rove was more athletic. </p>
<p>He lies coiled up before me now, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comfortable crescent. <br>
  His night-black nose and grizzled brow <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed in a fashion pleasant. </p>
<p>But ever and anon he lifts <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one good eye I mention, <br>
  And tries a thousand doggish shifts <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rivet my attention. </p>
<p>Just let me name his name, and up <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll see him start and patter <br>
  Towards me, like a six-months&rsquo; pup <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In point of speed, but fatter. </p>
<p>He pokes his head upon my lap, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor heeds the whip above him; <br>
  Because he knows, the dear old chap, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His human friends all love him. </p>
<p>Our younger dogs cut off from hence <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sight of lash uplifted; <br>
  But Rove, with grand indifference, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remains, and can&rsquo;t be shifted. </p>
<p>And, ah! the set upon his phiz <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At meals defies expression; <br>
  For I confess that Rover is <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cadger by profession. </p>
<p>The lesser favourites of the place <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dinner keep their distance; <br>
  But by my chair one grizzled face <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begs on with brave persistence. </p>
<p>His jaws present a toothless sight, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still my hearty hero <br>
  Can satisfy an appetite <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which brings a bone to zero. </p>
<p>And while Spot barks and pussy mews, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move the cook&rsquo;s compassion, <br>
  He takes his after-dinner snooze <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In genuine biped fashion. </p>
<p>In fact, in this, our ancient pet <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So hits off human nature, <br>
  That I at times almost forget <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s but a dog in feature. </p>
<p>Between his tail and bright old eye <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swift communications <br>
  Outstrip the messages which fly <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From telegraphic stations. </p>
<p>And, ah! that tail&rsquo;s rich eloquence <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conveys too clear a moral, <br>
  For men who have a grain of sense <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About its drift to quarrel. </p>
<p>At night, his voice is only heard <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is wanted badly; <br>
  For Rover is too cute a bird <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To follow shadows madly. </p>
<p>The pup and Carlo in the dark <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will start at crickets chirring; <br>
  But when we hear the old dog bark <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know there&rsquo;s something stirring. </p>
<p>He knows a gun, does Rover here; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I cock a trigger, <br>
  He makes himself from tail to ear <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An admirable figure. </p>
<p>For, once the fowling piece is out, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And game is on the tapis, <br>
  The set upon my hero&rsquo;s snout <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would make a cockle happy. </p>
<p>And as for horses, why, betwixt <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our chestnut mare and Rover <br>
  The mutual friendship is as fixed <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As any love of lover. </p>
<p>And when his master&rsquo;s hand resigns <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bridle for the paddle, <br>
  His dogship on the grass reclines, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stays and minds the saddle. </p>
<p>Of other friends he has no lack; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey pussy is his crony, <br>
  And kittens mount upon his back, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As youngsters mount a pony. </p>
<p>They talk of man&rsquo;s superior sense, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And charge the few with treason <br>
  Who think a dog&rsquo;s intelligence <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is very like our reason. </p>
<p>But though Philosophy has tried <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A score of definitions, <br>
  &rsquo;Twixt man and dog it can&rsquo;t decide <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative positions. </p>
<p>And I believe upon the whole <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Though you my creed deny, sir), <br>
  That Rove&rsquo;s entitled to a soul <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as you or I, sir! </p>
<p>Indeed, I fail to see the force <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your derisive laughter <br>
  Because I will not say my horse <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has not some horse-hereafter. </p>
<p>A fig for dogmas &mdash; let them pass! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s much in life to grieve us; <br>
  And what most grieves is this, alas! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That all our best friends leave us. </p>
<p>And when I sip my nightly grog, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch old Rover blinking, <br>
  This royal ruin of a dog <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls forth some serious thinking. </p>
<p>For, though he&rsquo;s lightly touched by Fate, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot help remarking <br>
  The step of age is in his gait, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its hoarseness in his barking. </p>
<p>He still goes on his rounds at night <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep off forest prowlers; <br>
  But, ah! he has no teeth to bite <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cunning-hearted howlers. </p>
<p>Not like the Rover that, erewhile, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave droves of dingoes battle, <br>
  And dashed through flood and fierce defile &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friend, but dread, of cattle. </p>
<p>Not like to him that, in past years, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Won fight by fight, and scattered <br>
  Whole tribes of dogs with rags of ears <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tail-ends torn and tattered. </p>
<p>But while time tells upon our pet, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes him greyer daily, <br>
  He is a noble fellow yet, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wears his old age gaily. </p>
<p>Still, dogs must die; and in the end, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he is past caressing, <br>
  We&rsquo;ll mourn him like some human friend <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose presence was a blessing. </p>
<p>Till then, be bread and peace his lot &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A life of calm and clover! <br>
  The pup may sleep outside with Spot &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll keep the nook for Rover. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sons of the fathers of fame, <br>
  Here are our hearts and our hands &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our song of acclaim. <br>
  Lords from magnificent zones, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shores of superlative sway, <br>
  Awful with lustre of thrones, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our greeting to-day. <br>
  Europe and Asia are here &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shining they enter our ports! <br>
  She that is half of the sphere <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beams like a sun in our courts. <br>
  Children of elders whose day <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone to the planet&rsquo;s white ends, <br>
  Meet, in the noble old way, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sons of your forefather&rsquo;s friends. </p>

<p>Dressed is the beautiful city &mdash; the spires of it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burn in the firmament stately and still; <br>
  Forest has vanished &mdash; the wood and the lyres of it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lutes of the sea-wind and harps of the hill. <br>
  This is the region, and here is the bay by it, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collins, the deathless, beheld in a dream: <br>
  Flinders and Fawkner, our forefathers grey, by it <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paused in the hush of a season supreme. <br>
  Here, on the waters of majesty near to us, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingered the leaders by towers of flame: <br>
  Elders who turn from the lordly old year to us <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowned with the lights of ineffable fame. </p>
<p align="center"><b>III.</b></p>
<p>Nine and seventy years ago, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the blaze of yonder bay, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a great exalted day, <br>
  Came from seas august with snow &mdash; <br>
  Waters where the whirlwinds blow &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of England&rsquo;s sons who stood <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the deep green, bygone wood <br>
  Where the wild song used to flow <br>
  Nine and seventy years ago. </p>
<p>Five and forty years ago, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a grand auspicious morn <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the South Wind blew his horn, <br>
  Where the splendid mountains glow &mdash; <br>
  Peaks that God and Sunrise know &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the fearless, famous band, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Founders of our radiant land, <br>
  From the lawns where roses grow, <br>
  Five and forty years ago. </p>
<p align="center"><b>IV.</b></p>
<p>By gracious slopes of fair green hills, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In shadows cool and deep, <br>
  Where floats the psalm of many rills, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble elders sleep. <br>
  But while their children&rsquo;s children last, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While seed from seedling springs, <br>
  The print and perfume of their past <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be as deathless things. </p>
<p>Their voices are with vanished years, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With other days and hours; <br>
  Their homes are sanctified by tears &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sleep amongst the flowers. <br>
  They do not walk by street or stream, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or tread by grove or shore, <br>
  But, in the nation&rsquo;s highest dream, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They shine for evermore. </p>
<p align="center"><b>V.</b></p>
<p>By lawny slope and lucent strand <br>
  Are singing flags of every land; <br>
  On streams of splendour &mdash; bays impearled &mdash; <br>
  The keels are here of all the world. <br>
  With lutes of light and cymbals clear <br>
  We waft goodwill to every sphere. <br>
  The links of love to-day are thrown <br>
  From sea to sea &mdash; from zone to zone; <br>
  And, lo! we greet, in glory drest, <br>
  The lords that come from east and west, <br>
  And march like noble children forth <br>
  To meet our fathers from the North! </p>
<p align="center"><b>VI.</b></p>
<p>To Thee be the glory, All-Bountiful Giver! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song that we sing is an anthem to Thee, <br>
  Whose blessing is shed on Thy people for ever, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose love is like beautiful light on the sea. <br>
  Behold, with high sense of Thy mercy unsleeping, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come to Thee, kneel to Thee, praise Thee, and pray, <br>
  O Lord, in whose hand is the strength that is keeping <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The storm from the wave and the night from the day! </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ByTheCliffsOfTheSea"></a>By The Cliffs Of The Sea <br>
  In Memory Of Samuel Bennett</b></h2>
<p>In a far-away glen of the hills, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the bird of the night is at rest, <br>
  Shut in from the thunder that fills <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog-hidden caves of the west &mdash; <br>
  In a sound of the leaf, and the lute <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the wind on the quiet lagoon, <br>
  I stand, like a worshipper, mute <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flow of a marvellous tune! <br>
  And the song that is sweet to my sense <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is, &ldquo;<i>Nearer, my  God, unto Thee;</i>&rdquo; <br>
  But it carries me sorrowing hence, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a grave by the cliffs of the sea. </p>
<p>So many have gone that I loved &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So few of the fathers remain, <br>
  That where in old seasons I moved <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could never be happy again. <br>
  In the breaks of this beautiful psalm, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its deep, its devotional tone, <br>
  And hints of ineffable calm, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like a stranger, alone. <br>
  No wonder my eyes are so dim &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Your</i> trouble  is heavy on me, <br>
  O widow and daughter of him <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sleeps in the grave by the sea! </p>
<p>The years have been hard that have pressed <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a head full of premature grey, <br>
  Since Stenhouse went down to his rest, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Harpur was taken away. <br>
  In the soft yellow evening-ends, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind of the water is faint <br>
  By the home of the last of my friends &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shrine of the father and saint. <br>
  The tenderness touching &mdash; the grace <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Ridley no more is for me; <br>
  And flowers have hidden the face <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the brother who sleeps by the sea. </p>
<p>The vehement voice of the South <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is loud where the journalist lies; <br>
  But calm hath encompassed his mouth, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweet is the peace in his eyes. <br>
  Called hence by the Power who knows <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the work of a hero is done, <br>
  He turned at the message, and rose <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the harness of diligence on. <br>
  In the midst of magnificent toil, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bowed at the holy decree; <br>
  And green is the grass on the soil <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the grave by the cliffs of the sea. </p>
<p><i>I knew him, indeed;</i> and I knew, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having suffered so much in his day, <br>
  What a beautiful nature and true <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bennett was hidden away. <br>
  In the folds of a shame without end, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the lips of the scorner were curled, <br>
  I found in this brother a friend &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last that was left in the world. <br>
  Ah! under the surface austere <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compassion was native to thee; <br>
  I send from my solitude here <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This rose for the grave by the sea. </p>
<p>To the high, the heroic intent <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a life that was never at rest, <br>
  He held, with a courage unspent, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the worst of his days and the best. <br>
  Far back in the years that are dead <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew of the bitterness cold <br>
  That saddens with silver the head <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And makes a man suddenly old. <br>
  The dignity gracing his grief <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was ever a lesson to me; <br>
  He lies under blossom and leaf <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a grave by the cliffs of the sea. </p>
<p>Above him the wandering face <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the moon is a loveliness now, <br>
  And anthems encompass the place <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From lutes of the luminous bough. <br>
  The forelands are fiery with foam <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where often and often he roved; <br>
  He sleeps in the sight of the home <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he built by the waters he loved. <br>
  The wave is his fellow at night, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sun, shining over the lea, <br>
  Sheds out an unspeakable light <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this grave by the cliffs of the sea. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Galatea"></a>Galatea</b></h2>
<p>A silver slope, a fall of firs, a league of gleaming  grasses, <br>
  And fiery cones, and sultry spurs, and swarthy pits and passes! </p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The long-haired Cyclops bated breath, and bit his lip and  hearkened, <br>
  And dug and dragged the stone of death, by ways that dipped and darkened. </p>
<p>Across a tract of furnaced flints there came a wind of  water, <br>
  From yellow banks with tender hints of Tethys&rsquo; white-armed daughter. </p>
<p>She sat amongst wild singing weeds, by beds of myrrh and  m&ocirc;ly; <br>
  And Acis made a flute of reeds, and drew its accents slowly; </p>
<p>And taught its spirit subtle sounds that leapt beyond  suppression, <br>
  And paused and panted on the bounds of fierce and fitful passion. </p>
<p>Then he who shaped the cunning tune, by keen desire made  bolder, <br>
  Fell fainting, like a fervent noon, upon the sea-nymph&rsquo;s shoulder. </p>
<p>Sicilian suns had laid a dower of light and life about  her: <br>
  Her beauty was a gracious flower &mdash; the heart fell dead without her. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Galat&ecirc;,&rdquo; said Polypheme, &ldquo;I would that I could find  thee <br>
  Some finest tone of hill or stream, wherewith to lull and bind thee! </p>
<p>&ldquo;What lyre is left of marvellous range, whose subtle  strings, containing <br>
  Some note supreme, might catch and change, or set thy passion waning? &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy passion for the fair-haired youth whose fleet, light  feet perplex me <br>
  By ledges rude, on paths uncouth, and broken ways that vex me? </p>
<p>Ah, turn to me! else violent sleep shall track the cunning  lover; <br>
  And thou wilt wait and thou wilt weep when I his haunts discover.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But golden Galatea laughed, and Th&ocirc;sa&rsquo;s son, like thunder, <br>
  Broke through a rifty runnel shaft, and dashed its rocks asunder, </p>
<p>And poised the bulk, and hurled the stone, and crushed the  hidden Acis, <br>
  And struck with sorrow drear and lone the sweetest of all faces. </p>
<p>To Zeus, the mighty Father, she, with plaint and prayer,  departed: <br>
  Then from fierce &AElig;tna to the sea a fountained water started &mdash; </p>
<p>A lucent stream of lutes and lights &mdash; cool haunt of flower  and feather, <br>
  Whose silver days and yellow nights made years of hallowed weather. </p>
<p>Here Galatea used to come, and rest beside the river; <br>
  Because, in faint, soft, blowing foam, her shepherd lived for ever. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ditto, calves and feet, you know. <br>
  Features of Hellenic type <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are not patent here, you see. <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn&rsquo;t hate her beer, you see. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nose is rather flat, perhaps. <br>

  English girls examine well <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the food they take, you twig: <br>
  Kate is hardly keen of smell &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kate will eat a snake, you twig. </p>
<p>Yonder lady&rsquo;s sitting room &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean and cool and dark it is: <br>
  Kitty&rsquo;s chamber needs no broom &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a sheet of bark it is. <br>
  You may find a pipe or two <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you poke and grope about: <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she has her blanket on. </p>
<p>Let her rip! the Phrygian boy <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bolted with a brighter one; <br>
  And the girl who ruined Troy <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a rather whiter one. <br>
  Katie&rsquo;s mouth is hardly Greek &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly like a rose it is: <br>
  Katie&rsquo;s nose is not antique &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the classic nose it is. </p>
<p>Dryad in the grand old day, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though she walked the woods about, <br>
  Didn&rsquo;t smoke a penny clay &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;hump&rdquo; her goods about. <br>
  Daphne by the fairy lake, <br>

  And you may know a bit of her <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who helped the Lycian leader. </p>
<p>I have my doubts &mdash; the head you &ldquo;sport&rdquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Now mark me, don&rsquo;t get crusty) <br>
  Is hardly of the classic sort &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your lore, I think, is fusty. </p>

  I judge you, neighbour, by your acts &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So don&rsquo;t you d&mdash;&mdash;n my verses. </p>
<p>But to my theme. The Asian sage, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose name above I mention, <br>
  Lived in the pitchy Pagan age, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A life without pretension. </p>
<p>He may have worshipped gods like Zeus, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And termed old Dis a master; <br>
  But then he had a strong excuse &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never heard a pastor. </p>
<p>However, it occurs to me <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, had he cut Demeter <br>
  And followed you, or followed me, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wouldn&rsquo;t have been sweeter. </p>
<p>No doubt with &ldquo;shepherds&rdquo; of this time <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s not the &ldquo;clean potato&rdquo;, <br>
  Because &mdash; excuse me for my rhyme &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pinned his faith to Plato. </p>
<p>But these are facts you can&rsquo;t deny, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pastor, smudged and sooty, <br>
  His mind was like a summer sky &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lived a life of beauty &mdash; </p>
<p>To lift his brothers&rsquo; thoughts above <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This earth he used to labour: <br>
  His heart was luminous with love &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t wound his neighbour. </p>
<p>To him all men were just the same &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never foamed at altars, <br>
  Although he lived ere Moody came &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere Sankey dealt in psalters. </p>
<p>The Lycian sage, my &ldquo;reverend&rdquo; sir, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had not your chances ample; <br>
  But, after all, I must prefer <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His perfect, pure example. </p>
<p>You, having read the Holy Writ &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Book the angels foster &mdash; <br>
  Say have you helped us on a bit, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You overfed impostor? </p>
<p>What have you done to edify, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You clammy chapel tinker? <br>
  What act like his of days gone by &mdash; <br>

<p>Is there no deed of yours at all <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With beauty shining through it? <br>
  Ah, no! your heart reveals its gall <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On every side I view it. </p>
<p>A blatant bigot with a big <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat heavy fetid carcass, <br>
  You well become your greasy &ldquo;rig&rdquo; &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not a second Arcas. </p>
<p>What sort of &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; do you preach? <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What &ldquo;Bible&rdquo; is your Bible? <br>
  There&rsquo;s worse than wormwood in your speech, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You livid, living libel! </p>
<p>How many lives are growing gray <br>

  You cannot point your finger to <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One fact to the contrary. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your malicious labour, <br>
  Endeavouring daily to destroy <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbour&rsquo;s love for neighbour. </p>
<p>The brutal curses you eject <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make strong men dread to hear you. <br>
  The world outside your petty sect <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feels sick when it is near you. </p>
<p>No man who shuns that little hole <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You call your tabernacle <br>
  Can have, you shriek, a ransomed soul &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wears the devil&rsquo;s shackle. </p>
<p>And, hence the &ldquo;Papist&rdquo; by your clan <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is dogged with words inhuman, <br>
  Because he loves that friend of man <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The highest type of woman &mdash; </p>
<p>Because he has that faith which sees <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the high Creator <br>
  A Virgin pleading on her knees &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shining Mediator! </p>
<p>God help the souls who grope in night &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who in your ways have trusted! <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more I feel disgusted. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your peculiar heaven! </p>
<p>Now mount your musty pulpit &mdash; thump, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And muddle flat clodhoppers; <br>
  And let some long-eared booby &ldquo;hump&rdquo; <br>

<p>At priest and parson spit and bark, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shake your &ldquo;church&rdquo; with curses, <br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four wasted years ago. </p>
<p>Narrara of the waterfalls, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darling of the hills, <br>
  Whose home is under mountain walls <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By many-luted rills! <br>
  Her bright green nooks and channels cool <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never more may see; <br>
  But, ah! the Past was beautiful &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sights that used to be. </p>
<p>There was a rock-pool in a glen <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond Narrara&rsquo;s sands; <br>
  The mountains shut it in from men <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In flowerful fairy lands; <br>
  But once we found its dwelling-place &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lovely and the lone &mdash; <br>
  And, in a dream, I stooped to trace <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our names upon a stone. </p>
<p>Above us, where the star-like moss <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone on the wet, green wall <br>
  That spanned the straitened stream across, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw the waterfall &mdash; <br>
  A silver singer far away, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By folded hills and hoar; <br>
  Its voice is in the woods to-day &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice I hear no more. </p>
<p>I wonder if the leaves that screen <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock-pool of the past <br>
  Are yet as soft and cool and green <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when we saw them last! <br>
  I wonder if that tender thing, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moss, has overgrown <br>
  The letters by the limpid spring &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our names upon  the stone! </p>
<p>Across the face of scenes we know <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may have come a change &mdash; <br>
  The places seen four years ago <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps would now look strange. <br>
  To you, indeed, they cannot be <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What haply once they were: <br>
  A friend beloved by you and me <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more will greet us there. </p>
<p>Because I know the filial grief <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shrinks beneath the touch &mdash; <br>
  The noble love whose words are brief &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not say too much; <br>
  But often when the night-winds strike <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the sighing rills, <br>
  I think of him whose life was like <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock-pool&rsquo;s in the hills. </p>
<p>A beauty like the light of song <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is in my dreams, that show <br>
  The grand old man who lived so long <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As spotless as the snow. <br>
  A fitting garland for the dead <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot compass yet; <br>
  But many things he did and said <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never will forget. </p>
<p>In dells where once we used to rove <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slow, sad water grieves; <br>
  And ever comes from glimmering grove <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liturgy of leaves. <br>
  But time and toil have marked my face, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart has older grown <br>
  Since, in the woods, I stooped to trace <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our names upon the stone. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Leichhardt"></a>Leichhardt</b></h2>
<p>Lordly harp, by lordly master wakened from majestic sleep, <br>
  Yet shall speak and yet shall sing the words which make the fathers weep! <br>
  Voice surpassing human voices &mdash; high, unearthly harmony &mdash; <br>
  Yet shall tell the tale of hero, in exalted years to be! <br>
  In the ranges, by the rivers, on the uplands, down the dells, <br>
  Where the sound of wind and wave is, where the mountain anthem swells, <br>
  Yet shall float the song of lustre, sweet with tears and fair with flame, <br>
  Shining with a theme of beauty, holy with our Leichhardt&rsquo;s name! <br>
  Name of him who faced for science thirsty tracts of bitter glow, <br>
  Lurid lands that no one knows of &mdash; two-and-thirty years ago. </p>
<p>Born by hills of hard grey weather, far beyond the  northern seas, <br>
  German mountains were his sponsors, and his mates were German trees; <br>
  Grandeur of the old-world forests passed into his radiant soul, <br>
  With the song of stormy crescents where the mighty waters roll. <br>
  Thus he came to be a brother of the river and the wood &mdash; <br>
  Thus the leaf, the bird, the blossom, grew a gracious sisterhood; <br>
  Nature led him to her children, in a space of light divine: <br>
  Kneeling down, he said &mdash; &ldquo;My mother, let me be as one of thine!&rdquo; <br>
  So she took him &mdash; thence she loved him &mdash; lodged him in her home of dreams, <br>
  Taught him what the trees were saying, schooled him in the speech of streams. </p>
<p>For her sake he crossed the waters &mdash; loving her, he left  the place <br>
  Hallowed by his father&rsquo;s ashes, and his human mother&rsquo;s face &mdash; <br>
  Passed the seas and entered temples domed by skies of deathless beam, <br>
  Walled about by hills majestic, stately spires and peaks supreme! <br>
  Here he found a larger beauty &mdash; here the lovely lights were new <br>
  On the slopes of many flowers, down the gold-green dells of dew. <br>
  In the great august cathedral of his holy lady, he <br>
  Daily worshipped at her altars, nightly bent the reverent knee &mdash; <br>
  Heard the hymns of night and morning, learned the psalm of solitudes; <br>
  Knew that God was very near him &mdash; felt His presence in the woods! </p>
<p>But the starry angel, Science, from the home of glittering  wings, <br>
  Came one day and talked to Nature by melodious mountain springs: <br>
  &ldquo;Let thy son be mine,&rdquo; she pleaded; &ldquo;lend him for a space,&rdquo; she said, <br>
  &ldquo;So that he may earn the laurels I have woven for his head!&rdquo; <br>
  And the lady, Nature, listened; and she took her loyal son <br>
  From the banks of moss and myrtle &mdash; led him to the Shining One! <br>
  Filled his lordly soul with gladness &mdash; told him of a spacious zone <br>
  Eye of man had never looked at, human foot had never known. <br>
  Then the angel, Science, beckoned, and he knelt and whispered low &mdash; <br>
  &ldquo;I will follow where you lead me&rdquo; &mdash; two-and-thirty years ago. </p>
<p>On the tracts of thirst and furnace &mdash; on the dumb, blind,  burning plain,<br>
  Where the red earth gapes for moisture, and the wan leaves hiss  for rain, <br>
  In a land of dry, fierce thunder, did he ever pause and dream <br>
  Of the cool green German valley and the singing German stream? <br>
  When the sun was as a menace, glaring from a sky of brass, <br>
  Did he ever rest, in visions, on a lap of German grass? <br>
  Past the waste of thorny terrors, did he reach a sphere of rills, <br>
  In a region yet untravelled, ringed by fair untrodden hills? <br>
  Was the spot where last he rested pleasant as an old-world lea? <br>
  Did the sweet winds come and lull him with the music of the sea? </p>
<p>Let us dream so &mdash; let us hope so! Haply in a cool green  glade, <br>
  Far beyond the zone of furnace, Leichhardt&rsquo;s sacred shell was laid! <br>
  Haply in some leafy valley, underneath blue, gracious skies, <br>
  In the sound of mountain water, the heroic traveller lies! <br>
  Down a dell of dewy myrtle, where the light is soft and green, <br>
  And a month like English April sits, an immemorial queen, <br>
  Let us think that he is resting &mdash; think that by a radiant grave <br>
  Ever come the songs of forest, and the voices of the wave! <br>
  <i>Thus</i> we want our sons to find him &mdash; find  him under floral bowers, <br>
  Sleeping by the trees he loved so, covered with his darling flowers! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AfterManyYears"></a>After Many Years</b></h2>
<p>The song that once I dreamed about, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tender, touching thing, <br>
  As radiant as the rose without &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love of wind and wing &mdash; <br>
  The perfect verses, to the tune <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of woodland music set, <br>
  As beautiful as afternoon, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remain unwritten yet. </p>
<p>It is too late to write them now &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient fire is cold; <br>
  No ardent lights illume the brow, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the days of old. <br>
  I cannot dream the dream again; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the happy birds <br>
  Are singing in the sunny rain, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I hear its words. </p>
<p>I think I hear the echo still <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of long-forgotten tones, <br>
  When evening winds are on the hill <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sunset fires the cones; <br>
  But only in the hours supreme, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With songs of land and sea, <br>
  The lyrics of the leaf and stream, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This echo comes to me. </p>
<p>No longer doth the earth reveal <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her gracious green and gold; <br>
  I sit where youth was once, and feel <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I am growing old. <br>
  The lustre from the face of things <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is wearing all away; <br>
  Like one who halts with tired wings, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rest and muse to-day. </p>
<p>There is a river in the range <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love to think about; <br>
  Perhaps the searching feet of change <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have never found it out. <br>
  Ah! oftentimes I used to look <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon its banks, and long <br>
  To steal the beauty of that brook <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And put it in a song. </p>
<p>I wonder if the slopes of moss, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dreams so dear to me &mdash; <br>
  The falls of flower, and flower-like floss &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are as they used to be! <br>
  I wonder if the waterfalls, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singers far and fair, <br>
  That gleamed between the wet, green walls, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are still the marvels there! </p>
<p>Ah! let me hope that in that place <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old familiar things <br>
  To which I turn a wistful face <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have never taken wings. <br>
  Let me retain the fancy still <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, past the lordly range, <br>
  There always shines, in folds of hill, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One spot secure from change! </p>
<p>I trust that yet the tender screen <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shades a certain nook, <br>
  Remains, with all its gold and green, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of the brook. <br>
  It hides a secret to the birds <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And waters only known: <br>
  The letters of two lovely words &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poem on a stone. </p>
<p>Perhaps the lady of the past <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon these lines may light, <br>
  The purest verses, and the last <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I may ever write. <br>
  She need not fear a word of blame &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her tale the flowers keep &mdash; <br>
  The wind that heard me breathe her name <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been for years asleep. </p>
<p>But in the night, and when the rain <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The troubled torrent fills, <br>
  I often think I see again <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The river in the hills; <br>
  And when the day is very near, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And birds are on the wing, <br>
  My spirit fancies it can hear <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song I cannot sing. </p>
