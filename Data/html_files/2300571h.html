<h2 align="center"><a name="TheGlenoftheWhiteMansGrave"></a>The Glen of the White Man&rsquo;s Grave </h2>
<p>A sky of wind! And while these July gusts<br>
  Are beating round the windows in the cold,<br>
  With sullen sobs of rain, behold I shape<br>
  A Settler&rsquo;s story of the fierce old times;<br>
  One told by camp-fires, when the station-drays<br>
  Were housed and hidden, forty years ago,<br>
  While swarthy drivers smoked the pipe of cheer,<br>
  And crowded round the friendly-gleaming flame<br>
  That lured the dingo howling from his caves<br>
  And brought sharp sudden feet about the brakes.</p>
<p>A tale of Love and Death. And shall I say &mdash;<br>
  Of Love&nbsp;<i>in</i>&nbsp;Death, for all the patient eyes<br>
  That gathered darkness, watching for a son<br>
  And brother, never dreaming of the fate &mdash;<br>
  The fearful fate he met alone &mdash; unknown<br>
  Within the ruthless Australasian wastes?</p>
<p>For in a far-off sultry Summer, rimmed<br>
  With thundercloud and red with forest-fires,<br>
  All day by ways uncouth, and ledges rude<br>
  The wild men held upon a stranger&rsquo;s trail<br>
  Which ran against the rivers and athwart<br>
  The gorges of the deep blue western hills.</p>
<p>And when a cloudy sunset (like the flame<br>
  In windy evenings on the plains of thirst<br>
  Beyond the dead banks of the far Barcoo)<br>
  Lay heavy down the topmost steeps, they came<br>
  With pent-in breath and stealthy steps, and crouched<br>
  Like snakes, amongst the grasses, till the Night<br>
  Had covered face from face, and thrown the gloom<br>
  Of many shadows on the front of things.</p>
<p>There, in the shelter of a nameless glen,<br>
  Fenced round by cedars and the tangled growths<br>
  Of blackwood stained with brown and shot with gray,<br>
  The jaded white man built his fire, and turned<br>
  His horse adrift amongst the water-pools<br>
  That trickled underneath the yellow leaves,<br>
  And made a pleasant murmur, like the brooks<br>
  Of England through the sweet autumnal noons.</p>
<p>Then after he had slaked his thirst, and used<br>
  The forest-fare, for which a healthful day<br>
  Of mountain-life had brought a zest, he took<br>
  His axe, and shaped, with boughs and wattle-forks,<br>
  A wurley, fashioned like a bushman&rsquo;s roof:<br>
  The door brought out athwart the strenuous flame:<br>
  The back thatched in against a rising wind.</p>
<p>And, while the sturdy hatchet filled the clifts<br>
  With sounds unknown, the immemorial haunts<br>
  Of Echoes sent their lonely dwellers forth<br>
  Who lived a life of wonder; flying round<br>
  And round the glen, what time the kangaroo<br>
  Leapt from his lair and huddled with the bats<br>
  Far-scattering down the wildly-startled fells.<br>
  Then came the doleful owl; and, evermore,<br>
  The bleak morass gave out the bittern&rsquo;s call;<br>
  The plover&rsquo;s cry; and many a fitful wail<br>
  Of chilly omen, falling on the ear<br>
  Like those cold flaws of wind that come and go<br>
  An hour before the break of day. &mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anon<br>
  The stranger held from toil, and, settling down,<br>
  He drew rough solace from his well-filled pipe<br>
  And smoked into the night: revolving there<br>
  The primal questions of a squatter&rsquo;s life,<br>
  For in the flats, a short day&rsquo;s journey past<br>
  His present camp, his station-yards were kept<br>
  With many a lodge and paddock jutting forth<br>
  Across the heart of unnamed prairie-lands<br>
  Now loud with bleating and the cattle-bells,<br>
  And misty with the hut-fire&rsquo;s daily smoke.</p>
<p>Wide-spreading flats, and western spurs of hills<br>
  That dipped to plains of dim perpetual blue.<br>
  Bold summits set against the thunder-heaps;<br>
  And slopes be-hacked and crushed by battling kine;<br>
  Where now the furious tumult of their feet<br>
  Gives back the dust and up from glen and brake<br>
  Evokes fierce clamour, and becomes indeed<br>
  A token of the squatter&rsquo;s daring life,<br>
  Which, growing inland &mdash; growing year by year,<br>
  Doth set us thinking in these latter days,<br>
  And makes one ponder of the lonely lands<br>
  Beyond the lonely tracks of Burke and Wills;<br>
  Where, when the wandering Stuart fixed his camps<br>
  In central wastes, afar from any home<br>
  Or haunt of man, and in the changeless midst<br>
  Of daily deserts and the footless miles<br>
  Of sultry silence, all the ways about<br>
  Grew strangely vocal, and a marvellous noise<br>
  Became the wonder of the waxing glooms.</p>
<p>Now after Darkness, like a mighty spell<br>
  Amongst the hills and dim dispeopled dells,<br>
  Had brought a stillness to the soul of things,<br>
  It came to pass that from the secret depths<br>
  Of dripping gorges many a runnel-voice<br>
  Came, mellowed with the silence, and remained<br>
  About the caves, a sweet though alien sound:<br>
  Now rising ever, like a fluent flute,<br>
  In moony evenings, when the theme is love &mdash;<br>
  Now falling, as ye hear the Sunday bells<br>
  While hastening fieldward from the gleaming town.</p>
<p>Then fell a softer mood, and Memory paused<br>
  With faithful Love amidst the sainted shrines<br>
  Of Youth and Passion in the valleys past<br>
  Of dear delights which never grow again.<br>
  And&nbsp;<i>if</i>&nbsp;the Stranger (who had left behind<br>
  Far anxious homesteads in a wave-swept isle,<br>
  To face a fierce sea-circle day by day<br>
  And hear at night the dark Atlantic&rsquo;s moan)<br>
  <i>Now</i>&nbsp;took a hope and planned a swift return<br>
  With wealth, and health, and with a youth unspent,<br>
  To those sweet ones that stayed with Want at home<br>
  Say&nbsp;<i>who</i>&nbsp;shall blame him &mdash; though the years are long,<br>
  And Life is hard and waiting makes the heart grow old?</p>
<p>Thus passed the time until the Moon serene<br>
  Stood over high dominion, like a Dream<br>
  Of Peace; within the white-transfigured woods;<br>
  And o&rsquo;er the vast dew-dripping wilderness<br>
  Of slopes illumined with her silent fires.</p>
<p>Then far beyond the home of pale red leaves<br>
  And silver sluices and the shining stems<br>
  Of runnel-blooms, the dreamy wanderer saw,<br>
  The wilder for the vision of the Moon,<br>
  Stark desolations and a waste of plain<br>
  All smit by flame and broken with the storms:<br>
  Black ghosts of trees and sapless trunks that stood<br>
  Harsh hollow channels of the fiery noise<br>
  Which ran from bole to bole a year before<br>
  And grew with ruin, and was like indeed<br>
  The roar of mighty winds with wintering streams<br>
  That beat about the limits of the land<br>
  And mix their own foam with the yellower seas.</p>
<p>Now, when the man had turned his face about<br>
  To take his rest, behold the gem-like eyes<br>
  Of ambushed wild things stared from bole and brake<br>
  With dumb amaze, and faint-recurring glance,<br>
  And fear anon that drove them down the brush;<br>
  While from his den the dingo, like a scout<br>
  In sheltered ways, crept out and cowered near,<br>
  To sniff the tokens of the stranger&rsquo;s feast<br>
  And marvel at the shadows of the flame.</p>
<p>Thereafter grew the wind; and chafing depths<br>
  In distant waters sent a troubled cry<br>
  Across the slumbrous Forest; and the chill<br>
  Of coming rain was on the sleeper&rsquo;s brow,<br>
  When, flat as reptiles hutted in the scrub,<br>
  A deadly crescent crawled to where he lay &mdash;<br>
  A band of fierce fantastic savages,<br>
  That, starting, moon-mailed, round the dying fire,<br>
  With sudden spears and swift terrific yells,<br>
  Came bounding wildly at the white man&rsquo;s head,<br>
  And faced him, staring, like a dream of hell!</p>
<p>Here let me pass! I would not stay to tell<br>
  Of hopeless struggles under crushing blows;<br>
  Of how the surging fiends, with thickening strokes,<br>
  Howled round the stranger till they drained his strength;<br>
  How Love and Life stood face to face with Hate<br>
  And Death; and then how Death was left alone<br>
  With Night and Silence in the sobbing rains.</p>
<p>So, after many moons, the searchers found<br>
  The body mouldering in the mouldering dell,<br>
  Amidst the fungi, and the bleaching leaves,<br>
  And buried it: and raised a stony mound<br>
  Which took the mosses: then the place became<br>
  The haunt of fearful legends, and the lair<br>
  Of bats and adders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There  he lies and sleeps<br>
  From year to year; in soft Australian nights;<br>
  And through the furnaced noons; and in the times<br>
  Of wind and wet; yet never mourner comes<br>
  To drop upon that grave the Christian&rsquo;s tear,<br>
  Or pluck the foul dank weeds of death away.</p>
<p>But while the English Autumn filled her lap<br>
  With faded gold, and while the reapers cooled<br>
  Their flame-red faces in the clover-grass,<br>
  They looked for him at home; and when the frost<br>
  Had made a silence in the morning-lanes<br>
  And cooped the farmers by December fires,<br>
  They looked for him at home; and through the days<br>
  Which brought about the million-coloured Spring,<br>
  With moon-like splendours in the garden-plots,<br>
  They looked for him at home: while Summer danced,<br>
  A shining singer, through the tasselled corn,<br>
  They looked for him at home. From sun to sun<br>
  They waited! Season after season went,<br>
  And Memory wept upon the lonely moors,<br>
  And Hope grew voiceless, and the watchers passed,<br>
  Like shadows, one by one, away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  he,<br>
  Whose fate was hidden under forest leaves,<br>
  And in the darkness of untrodden dells,<br>
  Became a marvel. Often by the hearths<br>
  In winter nights, and when the wind was wild<br>
  Outside the casements, children heard the tale<br>
  Of how he left their native vales behind<br>
  (Where he had been a child himself) to shape<br>
  New fortunes for his father&rsquo;s fallen house;<br>
  Of how he struggled &mdash; how his name became,<br>
  By fine devotion and unselfish zeal,<br>
  A name of beauty in a selfish land;<br>
  And then, of how the aching hours went by<br>
  With patient listeners praying for the step<br>
  Which never crossed the floor again. So passed<br>
  The tale to children; but the bitter end<br>
  Remained a wonder, like the unknown grave<br>
  Alone with God and Silence in the hills.<br>
</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="CuiBono"></a>Cui Bono? </h2>
<p>A clamour by day and a whisper by night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Summer comes, with the shining noons;<br>
  With the ripple of leaves, and the passionate light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the falling suns and the rising moons!</p>
<p>And the ripple of leaves and the purple and red<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Die for the grapes and the gleam of the wheat;<br>
  And then you may pause with the splendours, or tread<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the yellow of Autumn with lingering feet.</p>
<p>You may halt with the face to a flying sea<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or stand like a gloom in the gloom of things,<br>
  When the moon drops down and the desolate lea<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is troubled with thunder and desolate wings!</p>
<p>But alas for the grey of the wintering eves,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pondering storms and the ruin of rains;<br>
  And alas for the Spring, like a flame in the leaves,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the green of the woods and the gold of the  lanes!</p>
<p>For, seeing all pathos is mixed with our past,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And knowing all sadness of storm and of surge<br>
  Is salt with our tears for the faith that was cast<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away like a weed o&rsquo;er a bottomless verge,</p>
<p>I am lost for these tokens, and wearied of ways,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wedded with ways that are waning amain,<br>
  Like those who are filled with the trouble that slays;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having drank of their life to the lees that are  pain.</p>
<p>And yet would I write to&nbsp;you!&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;who have turned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away with a bitter disguise in the eyes,<br>
  And bitten the lips that have trembled and burned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, for you, darling, and breaking with sighs!</p>
<p>Because I have touched with my fingers a dress<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was Beauty&rsquo;s; because that the breath of thy  mouth<br>
  Is sweetness that lingers; because of each tress<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Showered down on thy shoulders; because of the  drouth,</p>
<p>That came of thy absence; because of the lights<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Passion that grew to a level with thee;<br>
  Is it well that our lives have been filled with the nights,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the days which have made it a sorrow to be?</p>
<p>Yea, thus having tasted all love with thy lips,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And having the warmth of thy hand in mine own,<br>
  Is it well that we wander, like parallel ships,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the silence between us: aloof and alone?</p>
<p>With my face to the wall shall I sleep and forget<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow, the sweet sense of slumber denies,<br>
  If even I marvel at kindness, and fret,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And start while the tears are all wet in mine  eyes?</p>
<p>Oh, darling of mine, standing here with the Past,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trampled under our feet in the bitterest ways,<br>
  Is this speech like a ghost that it keeps us aghast<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the track of the thorns and in alien days?</p>
<p>When I know of you, love, how you break with our pain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sob for the sorrow of sorrowful dreams,<br>
  Like a stranger who stands in the wind and the rain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watches and wails by impassable streams?</p>
<p>Like a stranger who droops on a brink and deplores,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With famishing hands and frost in the feet,<br>
  For the laughter, alive on the opposite shores<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the fervour of fire and the wind of the  wheat!</p>
