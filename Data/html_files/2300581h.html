<h2 align="center">The Bronze Trumpet</h2>
<p>While yet November filled the woods with flame,<br>
  To Southern shores the Muse of Albion came!<br>
  She, like an Echo in the footless caves,<br>
  Strayed, singing, by the madly-meeting waves;<br>
  And sleepless hills, and streams without a home,<br>
  And torrents driving down in stormy foam,<br>
  Forgot their sorrow, hearing then the beat &mdash; <br>
  The silky fall of sunshine-sandalled feet!<br>
  Forgot their terror, listening to a swell<br>
  Of music working like a wondrous spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In mighty days, and while the breath of Fame<br>
  &ldquo;Is loud for many a noble English name &mdash; <br>
  &ldquo;While they are left who wear the fair renown<br>
  &ldquo;From men like Pitt and Melbourne handed down;<br>
  &ldquo;While Browning holds us with his kingly songs,<br>
  &ldquo;And Enid&rsquo;s poet, like a lover, longs<br>
  &ldquo;For deathless Beauty by unshaken seas,<br>
  &ldquo;I seek,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the bright Antipodes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seek,&rdquo; she said,&ldquo;the land of gold and glare,<br>
  &ldquo;Enamoured of the goodly &lsquo;Giants&rsquo; there.<br>
  &ldquo;Long time I&rsquo;ve loved them, silver Sister, long,<br>
  &ldquo;And Love unsated shapes the Sapphic song:<br>
  &ldquo;Long time I&rsquo;ve loved them, and delayed desire,<br>
  &ldquo;Consumes me like a fierce and frequent fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behind the Muse, in deep dejected mood,<br>
  The silent Sister of the Nations stood:<br>
  <i>She too</i>&nbsp;had loved the &ldquo;Giants:&rdquo; self-withdrawn<br>
  Her life had been, yet in the woods forlorn,<br>
  And by the sweep and stress of seas intense,<br>
  And in the mountain&rsquo;s wild magnificence,<br>
  <i>She too</i>&nbsp;had loitered, conning many a lay<br>
  For names not destined soon to pass away;<br>
  But lo, her harp was stringless, and her mouth<br>
  Was dumb &mdash; this sweet Urania of the South!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll strike no harp,&rdquo; the Muse of Albion cried,<br>
  &ldquo;Be mine a twisted trumpet, long and wide &mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Be mine a broad-mouthed trumpet made to fit<br>
  &ldquo;The ample utterance that shall pass through it!<br>
  &ldquo;No feeble theme is mine! to &lsquo;human desks&rsquo;<br>
  &ldquo;I leave your pointless puns and bleak burlesques!<br>
  &ldquo;Let hirelings flourish &mdash; let the treacherous blow<br>
  &ldquo;Be dealt at trusting friend and noble foe:<br>
  &ldquo;Let those who see the snake&rsquo;s ungrateful mood,<br>
  &ldquo;Not wonder, though they gave him warmth and food!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I know</i>&nbsp;the serpent; and&nbsp;<i>I know</i>&nbsp;the  horde<br>
  &ldquo;That strike and sting the while they lick and laud!<br>
  &ldquo;But not for these, and &lsquo;toadies&rsquo; of their kind,<br>
  &ldquo;I left the dear old English cliffs behind:<br>
  &ldquo;My song is praise! for me shall Cowper smile,<br>
  &ldquo;And pause a moment in his mighty toil;<br>
  &ldquo;For me shall Arnold in his chair serene<br>
  &ldquo;Unbend his forehead and majestic mien;<br>
  &ldquo;While all our Solons, in their thanks profuse<br>
  &ldquo;Shall shout &mdash; &lsquo;A billet for the British Muse!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ceased; and straightway, with her wondrous skill,<br>
  She shaped a trumpet fashioned to her will:<br>
  &rsquo;Twas made of doubtful bronze &mdash; the&nbsp;<i>Herald&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;lead<br>
  With&nbsp;<i>Punch&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;pewter mingled in the head;<br>
  About the tube the&nbsp;<i>Empire&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;brass did glare,<br>
  And fused old candlesticks from&nbsp;<i>Bell</i>&nbsp;were there;<br>
  And last &mdash; not least &mdash; the&nbsp;<i>Freeman</i>&nbsp;helped the mould<br>
  Where mica glittered in the place of gold.<br>
  Now when she found her faultless work complete,<br>
  The Maiden blew a blast: the sound was sweet;<br>
  More sweet than singing winds in hidden hills,<br>
  Or waters playing past the daffodils;<br>
  Though there be envious ones, indeed, who say<br>
  The blast was rather like a donkey&rsquo;s bray.</p>
<p>Then said the Muse:&mdash; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll take this thing of mine<br>
  &ldquo;And shape for other days a Song divine?<br>
  &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll blow this tube for me? Ah, sister fair,<br>
  &ldquo;With silver feet and wildly-glittering hair,<br>
  &ldquo;Who is the favoured one whose steps of fire<br>
  &ldquo;Can scale the summits of my high desire?<br>
  &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll take the task?&rdquo; Her Austral sister turned<br>
  With lips that faltered, but with heart that burned,<br>
  And answered humbly: &ldquo;May my Harpur try &mdash;<br>
  My first-born, wedded to weird Ecstacy?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;No &mdash; no!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;let Harpur keep his ease<br>
  &ldquo;Amongst his native streams and rocks and trees;<br>
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;d dabble in aesthetics, and I know<br>
  &ldquo;My work is not for Harpur &mdash; let him go!&rdquo;<br>
  Then asked the other: &ldquo;Shall young Kendall rise?<br>
  &ldquo;His wings are used to travelling through the skies?<br>
  &ldquo;Behold of late he took a flight afar<br>
  &ldquo;And sped like comet, out from star to star,<br>
  &ldquo;With furious tumult! Radiant Queen of mine,<br>
  &ldquo;Shall Kendall rise and take the flight divine?&rdquo;<br>
  To whom the Maiden, in a lower tone:<br>
  &ldquo;My task is not for pinions barely grown:<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of him; and then of one who weeps,<br>
  &ldquo;A tuneful Poet, where Ione sleeps,<br>
  &ldquo;<i>He hath</i>&nbsp;the strength; but we must even leave<br>
  &ldquo;The spot where Love and pallid Memory grieve.&rdquo;<br>
  Then cried at once the sister hopefully &mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hit the chosen &mdash; shall brisk Barton try?<br>
  &ldquo;That&nbsp;<i>bearded bard</i>&nbsp;&mdash; the prince of scented swells?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;<i>He</i>, sister! why he wears a jester&rsquo;s bells!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Shall brilliant Dalley to the honour pass?<br>
  &ldquo;He rides a Pegasus!&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;He rides an ass!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, timid trembler beaming at my side,<br>
  &ldquo;For once be bolder,&rdquo; she of Albion cried,<br>
  &ldquo;Take up the tube, and, poised in steady flight,<br>
  &ldquo;Sweep on, and fill with swift and strong delight<br>
  &ldquo;The goodly &lsquo;Giants&rsquo; that we love so well;<br>
  &ldquo;While I, fast-harboured in some neighbouring dell,<br>
  &ldquo;Insphere thy wing&euml;d words with ardent fire,<br>
  &ldquo;And help thee to the summits of Desire!<br>
  &ldquo;Be thine the task to follow up my theme<br>
  &ldquo;In echoing by-ways of the mountain stream;<br>
  &ldquo;Yea, from the hill and holt, and glade and glen,<br>
  &ldquo;Blow blasts of praise to tickle famous men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she whose heart had been so very low,<br>
  Felt sudden strength and a diviner glow;<br>
  Swift from her eyes the silver lightnings flew<br>
  And round her feet the speedy flowers grew;<br>
  From every side the hues of sunset came<br>
  And ringed her with a sweet ambrosial flame;<br>
  The while, with twisted trumpet wide and long,<br>
  She startled Sydney and commenced her Song.</p>
<p>A Song of rapture, like a splendid light<br>
  Thrown out, you know, across a murky night!<br>
  Steeped well in Love, each radiant passage shone<br>
  Like daybeams too intense to look upon!<br>
  Though envious Dibbler hath the heart to call<br>
  This glorious Thing, a Song of sneers and gall!</p>
<p align="center"><b>The Song</b></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Had Zimri peace who slew his master?&rsquo; Nay,<br>
  My &lsquo;gentle&rsquo; hearers, I but&nbsp;<i>slash</i>, not slay &mdash;<br>
  <i>You</i>&nbsp;slip behind, nor deem my mild attacks<br>
  For mighty buttocks and majestic backs!<br>
  You&rsquo;ll find no blood about &mdash; no &lsquo;bigwigs&rsquo; slain &mdash;<br>
  For them I sheathe the sword nor wield the cane;<br>
  Yet if I thrash them till their hearts be sore,<br>
  What then? they&rsquo;ve had&nbsp;<i>their</i>&nbsp;turn to thrash before!<br>
  And since my children,&rdquo; sang the fluent Muse,<br>
  &ldquo;Are well-belaboured, let the blows be dues &mdash;<br>
  Right dues and lasting, lest the gossips say<br>
  That certain churls have thrown their strength away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then sound the trumpet! Let our Francis grace<br>
  His petty audience with his nightly face;<br>
  Yea, let him twist his mouth, and snarl and sneer,<br>
  On bench and platform, yelping year by year!<br>
  What though the&nbsp;<i>Herald</i>&nbsp;dubs his lectures &lsquo;treats,&rsquo;<br>
  Those changeless dishes of familiar meats.<br>
  Are they the newer? Will they tickle more<br>
  Because we&rsquo;ve had them fifty times before?</p>
<p>Ay, sound the trumpet! if the dwindled crowd<br>
  Have dolts to listen, let him &lsquo;read&rsquo; aloud<br>
  Who reads so glibly, let him stand and stammer,<br>
  And &lsquo;lispth&rsquo; and loiter over English &lsquo;gwammar,&rdquo;<br>
  And nice inflections, till his foolish tongue<br>
  Cleave to his mouth where better things have clung!<br>
  But sing, my Poets! While brisk Barton bites<br>
  His wretched pen and writes, as now he writes<br>
  For very malice, wherefore curb your verse?<br>
  Than&nbsp;<i>his</i>, remember, it can be no worse!<br>
  Yea, sing away, although the criticlings,<br>
  Like full-grown critics, are for clipping wings;<br>
  And though young Pegasus doth feel the flies<br>
  That round his haunches rise and fall and rise,<br>
  And cannot whisk aside the tedious bunch<br>
  From surly S&mdash;dd&mdash;n down to snivelling&nbsp;<i>Punch</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who pules for peace? Doth mealy Mawworm cry,<br>
  Who damns the pulpit with his weekly lie?<br>
  That &lsquo;h&rsquo;-less darling loved of dainty belles &mdash;<br>
  That holy butt for boys and beery &lsquo;swells?&rsquo;<br>
  Doth Mawworm cry? the mild epitome<br>
  Of all a well-bred flunkey ought to be?<br>
  A sleek-cut rascal of the ranting race<br>
  Who cannot look his Bishop in the face?<br>
  No peace for him!&nbsp;<i>he</i>&nbsp;hath a turn for rhyme, &mdash;<br>
  And &lsquo;lectured&rsquo; thereon once upon a time!<br>
  &rsquo;Twas then, great Shakespeare, turning in his grave,<br>
  Did moan for hours to hear the twaddler rave;<br>
  While Satan&rsquo;s imps prepared, [sad truth to tell,]<br>
  For Mawworm&rsquo;s sprite, the hottest hole in hell!<br>
  Ah, Mawworm, Mawworm! hard it is I know,<br>
  Thou should&rsquo;st have lived three hundred years ago!<br>
  <i>Then</i>&nbsp;saints were scarce, and&nbsp;<i>then</i>&nbsp;the ready stake<br>
  Was blazing ever for the saintly sake<br>
  Of would-be martyrs &mdash; godly men like thee, &mdash;<br>
  And meek descendants of the Pharisee!<br>
  But now the days are cold: the &lsquo;sweet Elect&rsquo;<br>
  Get all the scoffs &mdash; not all the old respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall gushing G&mdash;h&mdash;m fail to reap his dues &mdash;<br>
  That dull abortion of the Ethic Muse?<br>
  The bard of leaky ships, whose leaky rhymes<br>
  And doubtful tenses &lsquo;grace&rsquo; our local &lsquo;Times,&rsquo;<br>
  Or in the shops, like baby-lyrics shine<br>
  In print, on strips of satin superfine?<br>
  Whose themes of &lsquo;blood&rsquo; and &lsquo;death&rsquo; and Morgan&rsquo;s bones<br>
  Turn up as pleasant as the &lsquo;grewsome&rsquo; groans<br>
  From pigs, in sorrow, marking out of reach<br>
  The mellow melon or the pulpy peach?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What though thy stale &lsquo;orations&rsquo; pass and pay &mdash;<br>
  And none hath dubbed thee &lsquo;twaddler,&rsquo; by the way &mdash;<br>
  What though the&nbsp;<i>Herald</i>&nbsp;claims thy minstrelsy,<br>
  And peerless West doth paw and fondle thee,<br>
  Is Midas less the Midas? shall the ears<br>
  Be winked at where a godly hat appears?<br>
  Say &mdash; shall thy brothers of the braying kind,<br>
  To cabbage-carts and market-boys assigned,<br>
  Fail, as some fail &mdash; poor devils &mdash; to descry<br>
  Their kith and kin beneath thy spotless tie?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, gentle Dibbler! candid critic dear,<br>
  With sidelong eye and thin perpetual sneer!<br>
  <i>Thou</i>&nbsp;hast thy fond disciples;&nbsp;<i>they</i>&nbsp;remain<br>
  Bound like to faithful watchdogs on thy chain;<br>
  <i>They&rsquo;ll</i>&nbsp;bark at those who threat! With&nbsp;<i>thee</i>&nbsp;to  lead,<br>
  They&rsquo;ll follow, and be like to dogs indeed!<br>
  For hast thou not on them a mighty claim,<br>
  For mending stanzas and insuring fame?<br>
  Yea, though in &lsquo;scrap-books&rsquo; only dost thou shine,<br>
  And maids &mdash; [not critics] &mdash; call thy verse &lsquo;divine,&rsquo;<br>
  And though thy neighbours have no eyes to see<br>
  The full-blown Hazlitt &mdash; aged &mdash; twenty-three!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry out &lsquo;no mercy!&rsquo; slip you line and leash,<br>
  Buchanan, Lucas, Cummings, Rodd, Dalgleish!<br>
  <i>Et ceteri</i>, if you like, come great &mdash; come small &mdash;<br>
  I have no terror &mdash; here is &lsquo;<i>at you all!</i>&rsquo;<br>
  <i>I</i>&nbsp;shall not step aside, or sag with fear<br>
  For you, ye foxes, whining in my rear! &mdash;<br>
  Ah, Queen of mine! say is there end to pain<br>
  For adverbs strangled, and for &lsquo;<i>h&rsquo;s</i>&rsquo; slain?<br>
  Are these, our Cobdens &mdash; these, our Peels and Brights,<br>
  Who chase the sleep from out the long long nights!<br>
  With windy nothings? and who slip away<br>
  Betimes, like shadows, into place and pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All hail, my Cowper! not for thee the pen<br>
  Is dipped in wormwood, man of many men!<br>
  For, while I do not love thee and thy rule,<br>
  I know the thorough statesman from the fool.<br>
  To hearty Jack let every praise accrue<br>
  For &lsquo;free selection:&rsquo; give old Nick his due!<br>
  At least the man is honest, and, I know,<br>
  A wee bit holier than the Nick below.<br>
  Let ardent Tommy and his motley throng,<br>
  With Rae and W&mdash;tt&mdash;n, have their meed in song:<br>
  Let Poet Johnny never hide his head<br>
  For limping verses and for lectures dead &mdash;<br>
  That bloody man who murdered, in their turns,<br>
  The son of Amoz and the hapless Burns!<br>
  And let our brilliant Boffins never pass<br>
  A day without his three-and-twentieth glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, my Samuel! Here my breath declines<br>
  To tax thee, Taxer, with tartaric lines.<br>
  On other game behold I turn mine eye &mdash;<br>
  Fly, Billy Dailey! blustering Isaacs fly!<br>
  Hide, windy Windeyer! &mdash; cut and clear the way,<br>
  Ye budding Talfourds, for the coming fray!<br>
  Who&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;the champion? Native Dullness, who<br>
  Will take the field and wage the fight for you?<br>
  <i>I know</i>&nbsp;you, dunces! Scores and scores of times<br>
  You&rsquo;ve hissed my children and reviled their rhymes:<br>
  These are no better: take the tardy quill<br>
  And damn these &lsquo;viler&rsquo; verses as you will!<br>
  I fain would know how much the mongrels dare,<br>
  Who bark in kennels, in the open air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One &lsquo;cannot strike at kernes&rsquo; &mdash; on W&mdash;t call,<br>
  Come forth thou noblest Roman of them all!<br>
  Thou chief apostle of accomplished slang &mdash;<br>
  Bear witness, roaring Jack, and Dunmore Lang &mdash;<br>
  Thou Prince of Polishers! have&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;no claim<br>
  Upon thy leaders graced with Wiley&rsquo;s name?<br>
  Still must I wait &mdash; shall Phil M&rsquo;Carroll&rsquo;s lays,<br>
  And F&mdash;&mdash;s&rsquo; penny whistles wear thy praise,<br>
  And&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;not get thy cudgel? Ah! behold<br>
  Thy servant at thy feet in sackcloth rolled:<br>
  Strike &mdash; strike, my master! They are sure of Fame<br>
  Who feel thy &lsquo;waddy&rsquo; and enjoy thy blame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some churls have whispered, [let me say it low]<br>
  That thou art, after all, a sorry foe &mdash;<br>
  That &lsquo;heavy vanity and heavy lead<br>
  Fill up the crannies&rsquo; of thy &lsquo;ponderous head!&rsquo;<br>
  But&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;&mdash; I don&rsquo;t believe it! I have tried<br>
  And found &mdash; nor lead nor anything beside!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fluent&nbsp;<i>Bell!</i>&nbsp;and is it left to you<br>
  To stalk on stilts and ape the high review?<br>
  On one bright page of yours behold we see<br>
  &AElig;sthetics, Veno, Cricket, Poetry!<br>
  The next we turn to hath a &lsquo;Champion Race!&rsquo;<br>
  The next records the latest &lsquo;mill&rsquo; by Mace!<br>
  Howbeit in&nbsp;<i>Bell</i>&nbsp;one finds at club or lunch,<br>
  A vast improvement on the local&nbsp;<i>Punch!</i><br>
  The former hath some genial wit &mdash; some fun<br>
  He substitutes for&nbsp;<i>Punch&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;pointless pun<br>
  And slanderous joke; and here and there you mark<br>
  Of hearty humour an undoubted spark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At all events, I&rsquo;d sooner sing the praise<br>
  Of semi-sinners, than attune my lays<br>
  For those who flaunt their godliness, and drag<br>
  The holy banner with them, like a rag<br>
  Of party-warfare &mdash; I would rather be<br>
  Old Nick himself and flout all fealty,<br>
  Than hang to &lsquo;Pleaders,&rsquo; and that precious set<br>
  With &lsquo;pious Pidgeon&rsquo; in their vanguard yet!<br>
  These are the &lsquo;Christians&rsquo; who have made the row<br>
  O&rsquo;er warrior Wiseman, and his prowess now:<br>
  For him they sing thanksgivings in the street,<br>
  And generous wreaths are scattered at his feet;<br>
  Because he sailed across defenceless seas<br>
  To fight the &lsquo;babies&rsquo; of the Hebrides;<br>
  Because he left his countrymen the while<br>
  To waste with Famine on an ice-bound isle!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a flux of able men, ye Powers,<br>
  To help this ghastly thin-faced time of ours!<br>
  A flux of able men: there is no call<br>
  To flout the customs of the classic Hall,<br>
  Where Windeyer earned his &lsquo;bays,&rsquo; by breaking in<br>
  With &lsquo;village Hampdens&rsquo; destitute of &lsquo;tin!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;What next, forsooth?&rdquo; &mdash; a sorry bardling roars &mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;<i>Not</i>&nbsp;breed Buchanans for our council floors?<br>
  &ldquo;<i>Not</i>&nbsp;shape a Cummings for the stern debate<br>
  &ldquo;Whose Attic face would grace the seat of State?&rdquo;<br>
  Ah, well! When Genius is a fact again<br>
  Where cold Adversity doth blow and rain<br>
  With bitter stress, it will not spoil its growth<br>
  That some to help and foster are so loth.<br>
  Then shut and&nbsp;<i>bar</i>&nbsp;your academic door<br>
  And raise your mushrooms, masters, by the score;<br>
  Stick to your fine exclusiveness, and take<br>
  All credit for the mighty ones ye make:<br>
  So shall the fathers in the future days<br>
  For Slys and Dockers wag the tongue of praise;<br>
  And so, in love, shall pass from sire to son,<br>
  The fame of poet &mdash; Billy Yarrington!</p>
<p>&ldquo;All meaner themes I leave to raw recruits,<br>
  I sing of Barton, gloves, and marvellous boots!<br>
  My&nbsp;<i>bearded</i>&nbsp;love! wherever I may be,<br>
  My thoughts, untravelled, stick, like scents, to thee!<br>
  &rsquo;Tis often now I sweep from star to star<br>
  With Kendall&rsquo;s&rdquo; &ldquo;Safi:&rdquo; oft I rest afar<br>
  With sweet &ldquo;Ione&rdquo; by the yellow gleams<br>
  And shifting shadows on suggestive streams:<br>
  With Harpur too, I note the bright distress<br>
  And wilful beauty of our wilderness:<br>
  Yet, while I cross the immemorial plains<br>
  And Southern forests &mdash; while the singing lanes<br>
  Of green old England even lure the eye,<br>
  For thee, my darling, none the less I sigh!<br>
  Oh, in my dreams, thy gentle rhymes appear<br>
  And &ldquo;jokes&rdquo; as thick as &ldquo;geebungs&rdquo; hover near:<br>
  Kind, harmless jokes, enriched with many a pun,<br>
  Through which there glides the pallid ghost of Fun.<br>
  Alas, poor Yorick! Pawn the borrowed bell,<br>
  And take, from one who loves thee &mdash; loves thee well,<br>
  <i>This</i>&nbsp;friendly hint: go in for peace and pelf,<br>
  But keep thy sins &mdash; thy verses to thyself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there next? No name whereon to dwell<br>
  From dull McSkimming up to polished Pell!<br>
  Alas, my tube! the ready theme invites,<br>
  But breath is lost when blown for parasites.<br>
  We must be &lsquo;ganging,&rsquo; though McGibbon bawls<br>
  And thumps his cushions in his chapel-walls;<br>
  Though still unchecked the Yankee spouter raves,<br>
  And blows the dust from newly-covered graves;<br>
  Though Graham gives us bottle-glass for pearl,<br>
  And gloats o&rsquo;er ethics like a gushing girl;<br>
  I&nbsp;<i>know</i>&nbsp;we must be &lsquo;ganging&rsquo; &mdash; trumpet, stay,<br>
  And let the saintlings sleep as well as pray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silent phantom of a sinking star<br>
  Gleams swiftly past the moaning harbour-bar.<br>
  It sets me wandering over other days<br>
  And Memory turns my theme to kinder ways:<br>
  I&rsquo;m dreaming, Sister, of the happy time<br>
  When men like Lowe and Wentworth claimed my rhyme;<br>
  And much it grieves my stricken soul to see<br>
  The ghosts of hopes that died with Deniehy.<br>
  &rsquo;Tis now my thoughts to yonder churchyard pass,<br>
  Where Love, like April in the wilted grass,<br>
  With fallen face and melancholy eyes,<br>
  Sits weeping by the grave of Edward Wise!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re hard on Kendall, caustic critics. He<br>
  Makes ample food for &lsquo;generous&rsquo; ribaldry:<br>
  This youth of letters hath no claim, I ween,<br>
  To honours wisely kept for Richard Green?<br>
  While barber Caffyn drives and dines with &lsquo;swells,&rsquo;<br>
  And &lsquo;lords&rsquo; are partial to the jester&rsquo;s bells,<br>
  &rsquo;Tis fine to see how well the censor spurns<br>
  A kindred spirit of the Scottish Burns!</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He too</i>&nbsp;has been a dreamer, though you damn<br>
  His many efforts and baptize him &lsquo;sham:&rsquo;<br>
  Once, in his &lsquo;spring-time,&rsquo; when his heart was soft,<br>
  <i>He too</i>&nbsp;could rhyme by stream and field and croft;<br>
  And, as a traveller sees in windy nights<br>
  Swift water-moons blown into golden lights,<br>
  You might have seen across his face of yore<br>
  The swift delights of thoughts that are no more!<br>
  But these are dead, and, like a wearied guest,<br>
  He has&nbsp;<i>few</i>&nbsp;thoughts now past the thought of rest &mdash;<br>
  <i>Few</i>&nbsp;thoughts, my masters: not through you and yours,<br>
  But through a sorrow no man well endures.<br>
  Yea, steeped in trouble to the very lip,<br>
  He stands and fronts you like a lonely ship<br>
  That strives with all the sea &mdash; well beaten down<br>
  By winds that buffet and by rains that drown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet none the less, my polished Pell, admire<br>
  The steadfast sweetness of the Austral lyre<br>
  While he of arborous Ashfield still remains,<br>
  And Harpur sleeps not on the Southern plains;<br>
  While favoured Brereton dreams luxurious dreams,<br>
  And Michael haunts the glowing Grafton streams!<br>
  Some others too one day may strike the strings,<br>
  And fill the woods with wilder echoings,<br>
  And shew [for all the learned Dibbler saith,]<br>
  Much good may even come from Nazareth!<br>
  Yet none the less, my generous Moore, defend<br>
  The helpless bards who seek in thee a friend:<br>
  Who turn to thee in all their hours of need,<br>
  And find a brother and a help indeed!<br>
  Yet none the less, my faithful Bland, foredoom<br>
  The lies which mix our younger years with gloom;<br>
  The while, my best-beloved wage with thee<br>
  The fight sublime for Light and Liberty!</p>
<p>And none the less, my classic Stenhouse, give<br>
  The genial hope that bids the minstrel live!<br>
  Yea, if some timid youth should seek thine eyes<br>
  In whose young verse the germ of Genius lies,<br>
  Spare not thy blame, nor yet restrain thy praise<br>
  Thou fine old relic of forgotten days!<br>
  So shall the wise ones in the years to be<br>
  Belaud the bard who&rsquo;ll owe so much to thee,<br>
  And so their children shall revere the name<br>
  Embalmed in kindness and the poet&rsquo;s fame.</p>
