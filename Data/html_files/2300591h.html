<h2 align="center"><b><a name="RoseLorraine"></a>Rose Lorraine</b></h2>
<p>Sweet water-moons, blown into lights<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of flying gold on pool and creek,<br>
  And many sounds and many sights,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of younger days are back this week.<br>
  I cannot say I sought to face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or greatly cared to cross again,<br>
  The subtle spirit of the place<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose life is mixed with Rose Lorraine.</p>
<p>What though her voice rings clearly through<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nightly dream I gladly keep,<br>
  No wish have I to start anew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart-fountains that have ceased to leap.<br>
  Here, face to face with different days,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And later things that plead for love,<br>
  It would be worse than wrong to raise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phantom far too fain to move.</p>
<p>But, Rose Lorraine &mdash; ah, Rose Lorraine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll whisper now where no one hears.<br>
  If you should chance to meet again<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man you kissed in soft dead years,<br>
  Just say for once &ldquo;he suffered much,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And add to this &ldquo;his fate was worst<br>
  Because of me, my voice, my touch,&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no passion like the first!</p>
<p>If I that breathe your slow sweet name<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one breathes low notes on a flute,<br>
  Have vext your peace with word of blame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The phrase is dead &mdash; the lips are mute.<br>
  Yet when I turn towards the wall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In stormy nights, in times of rain,<br>
  I often wish you could recall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your tender speeches, Rose Lorraine.</p>
<p>Because, you see, I thought them true,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did not count you self-deceived,<br>
  And gave myself in all to you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked on Love as Life achieved.<br>
  Then came the bitter, sudden change,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fastened lips, the dumb despair:<br>
  The first few weeks were very strange,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And long, and sad, and hard to bear.</p>
<p>No woman lives with power to burst<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My passion&rsquo;s bonds, and set me free;<br>
  For Rose is last where Rose was first,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And only Rose is fair to me.<br>
  The faintest memory of her face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wilful face that hurt me so,<br>
  Is followed by a fiery trace<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Rose Lorraine must never know.</p>
<p>I keep a faded ribbon string<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You used to wear about your throat;<br>
  And of this pale, this perished thing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I know the threads by rote.<br>
  God help such love! To touch your hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To loiter where your feet might fall,<br>
  You marvellous girl, my soul would stand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst of hell &mdash; its fires and all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Araluen"></a>Araluen</b></h2>
<p>Take this rose, and very gently place it on the tender, deep<br>
  Mosses where our little darling, Araluen, lies asleep.<br>
  Put the blossom close to baby &mdash; kneel with me, my love, and pray;<br>
  We must leave the bird we&rsquo;ve buried &mdash; say good-bye to her to-day.<br>
  In the shadow of our trouble we must go to other lands,<br>
  And the flowers we have fostered will be left to other hands:<br>
  Other eyes will watch them growing &mdash; other feet will softly tread<br>
  Where two hearts are nearly breaking, where so many tears are shed.<br>
  Bitter is the world we live in: life and love are mixed with pain;<br>
  We will never see these daisies &mdash; never water them again.</p>
<p>Ah! the saddest thought in leaving baby in this bush alone<br>
  Is that we have not been able on her grave to place a stone:<br>
  We have been too poor to do it; but, my darling, never mind &mdash;<br>
  God is in the gracious heavens, and His sun and rain are kind:<br>
  They will dress the spot with beauty, they will make the grasses grow:<br>
  Many winds will lull our birdie, many songs will come and go.<br>
  Here the blue-eyed Spring will linger, here the shining month will stay,<br>
  Like a friend, by Araluen, when we two are far away;<br>
  But beyond the wild, wide waters, we will tread another shore &mdash;<br>
  We will never watch this blossom, never see it any more.</p>
<p>Girl, whose hand at God&rsquo;s high altar in the dear, dead year I pressed,<br>
  Lean your stricken head upon me &mdash; this is still your lover&rsquo;s breast!<br>
  She who sleeps was first and sweetest &mdash; none we have to take her place;<br>
  Empty is the little cradle &mdash; absent is the little face.<br>
  Other children may be given; but this rose beyond recall,<br>
  But this garland of your girlhood, will be dearest of them all.<br>
  None will ever, Araluen, nestle where you used to be,<br>
  In my heart of hearts, you darling, when the world was new to me;<br>
  We were young when you were with us, life and love were happy things<br>
  To your father and your mother ere the angels gave you wings.</p>
<p>You that sit and sob beside me &mdash; you, upon whose golden head<br>
  Many rains of many sorrows have from day to day been shed;<br>
  Who because your love was noble, faced with me the lot austere<br>
  Ever pressing with its hardship on the man of letters here &mdash;<br>
  Let me feel that you are near me, lay your hand within mine own;<br>
  You are all I have to live for, now that we are left alone.<br>
  Three there were, but one has vanished. Sins of mine have made you weep;<br>
  But forgive your baby&rsquo;s father now that baby is asleep.<br>
  Let us go, for night is falling; leave the darling with her flowers;<br>
Other hands will come and tend them &mdash; other friends in other hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="HyBrasil"></a>Hy-Brasil</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; said the ancient father, pausing by the evening sea,<br>
  &ldquo;Turn thy face towards the sunset &mdash; turn thy face and kneel with me!<br>
  Prayer and praise and holy fasting, lips of love and life of light,<br>
  These and these have made thee perfect &mdash; shining saint with seraph&rsquo;s sight!<br>
  Look towards that flaming crescent &mdash; look beyond that glowing space &mdash;<br>
  Tell me, sister of the angels, what is beaming in thy face?&rdquo;<br>
  And the daughter, who had fasted, who had spent her days in prayer,<br>
  Till the glory of the Saviour touched her head and rested there,<br>
  Turned her eyes towards the sea-line &mdash; saw beyond the fiery crest,<br>
  Floating over waves of jasper, far Hy-Brasil in the west.</p>
<p>All the calmness and the colour &mdash; all the splendour and repose,<br>
  Flowing where the sunset flowered, like a silver-hearted rose!<br>
  There indeed was singing Eden, where the great gold river runs<br>
  Past the porch and gates of crystal, ringed by strong and shining ones!<br>
  There indeed was God&rsquo;s own garden, sailing down the sapphire sea &mdash;<br>
  Lawny dells and slopes of summer, dazzling stream and radiant tree!<br>
  Out against the hushed horizon &mdash; out beneath the reverent day,<br>
  Flamed the Wonder on the waters &mdash; flamed and flashed and passed away.<br>
  And the maiden who had seen it felt a hand within her own,<br>
  And an angel that we know not led her to the lands unknown.</p>
<p>Never since hath eye beheld it &mdash; never since hath mortal, dazed<br>
  By its strange, unearthly splendour, on the floating Eden gazed!<br>
  Only once since Eve went weeping through a throng of glittering wings,<br>
  Hath the holy seen Hy-Brasil where the great gold river sings!<br>
  Only once by quiet waters, under still, resplendent skies,<br>
  Did the sister of the seraphs kneel in sight of Paradise!<br>
  She, the pure, the perfect woman, sanctified by patient prayer,<br>
  Had the eyes of saints of Heaven, all their glory in her hair:<br>
  Therefore God the Father whispered to a radiant spirit near &mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Show Our daughter fair Hy-Brasil &mdash; show her this, and lead her here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But beyond the halls of sunset, but within the wondrous west,<br>
  On the rose-red seas of evening, sails the Garden of the Blest.<br>
  Still the gates of glassy beauty, still the walls of glowing light,<br>
  Shine on waves that no man knows of, out of sound and out of sight.<br>
  Yet the slopes and lawns of lustre, yet the dells of sparkling streams,<br>
  Dip to tranquil shores of jasper, where the watching angel beams.<br>
  But, behold, our eyes are human, and our way is paved with pain,<br>
  We can never find Hy-Brasil, never see its hills again;<br>
  Never look on bays of crystal, never bend the reverent knee<br>
  In the sight of Eden floating &mdash; floating on the sapphire sea!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="SeptemberInAustralia"></a>September In Australia</b></h2>
<p>Grey Winter hath gone, like a wearisome guest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, behold, for repayment,<br>
  September comes in with the wind of the West<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Spring in her raiment!<br>
  The ways of the frost have been filled of the flowers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the forest discovers<br>
  Wild wings with the halo of hyaline hours,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the music of lovers.</p>
<p>September, the maid with the swift, silver feet!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She glides, and she graces<br>
  The valleys of coolness, the slopes of the heat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her blossomy traces.<br>
  Sweet month with a mouth that is made of a rose,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lightens and lingers<br>
  In spots where the harp of the evening glows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attuned by her fingers.</p>
<p>The stream from its home in the hollow hill slips<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a darling old fashion;<br>
  And the day goeth down with a song on its lips,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose key-note is passion.<br>
  Far out in the fierce, bitter front of the sea<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand and remember<br>
  Dead things that were brothers and sisters of thee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resplendent September!</p>
<p>The West, when it blows at the fall of the noon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beats on the beaches,<br>
  Is filled with a tender and tremulous tune<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That touches and teaches:<br>
  The stories of Youth, of the burden of Time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the death of Devotion,<br>
  Come back with the wind, and are themes of the rhyme<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the waves of the ocean.</p>
<p>We, having a secret to others unknown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cool mountain-mosses,<br>
  May whisper together, September, alone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our loves and our losses!<br>
  One word for her beauty, and one for the grace<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave to the hours;<br>
  And then we may kiss her, and suffer her face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sleep with the flowers.</p>
<p>High places that knew of the gold and the white<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the forehead of Morning,<br>
  Now darken and quake, and the steps of the Night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are heavy with warning!<br>
  Her voice in the distance is lofty and loud,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the echoing gorges;<br>
  She hath hidden her eyes in a mantle of cloud,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her feet in the surges!</p>
<p>On the tops of the hills; on the turreted cones &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief temples of thunder &mdash;<br>
  The gale, like a ghost, in the middle watch moans,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gliding over and under.<br>
  The sea, flying white through the rack and the rain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leapeth wild at the forelands;<br>
  And the plover, whose cry is like passion with pain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complains in the moorlands.</p>
<p>Oh, season of changes &mdash; of shadow and shine &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September the splendid!<br>
  My song hath no music to mingle with thine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And its burden is ended:<br>
  But thou, being born of the winds and the sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By mountain, by river,<br>
  Mayst lighten and listen, and loiter and run,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With thy voices for ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="PrefatorySonnets"></a>Prefatory Sonnets</b></h2>
<h3 align="center"><b>I.</b></h3>
<p>I purposed once to take my pen and write,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not songs, like some, tormented and awry<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With passion, but a cunning harmony<br>
  Of words and music caught from glen and height,<br>
  And lucid colours born of woodland light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shining places where the sea-streams lie.<br>
  But this was when the heat of youth glowed white,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And since I&rsquo;ve put the faded purpose by.<br>
  I have no faultless fruits to offer you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who read this book; but certain syllables<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herein are borrowed from unfooted dells<br>
  And secret hollows dear to noontide dew;<br>
  And these at least, though far between and few,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May catch the sense like subtle forest spells.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>II.</b></h3>
<p>So take these kindly, even though there be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some notes that unto other lyres belong,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stray echoes from the elder sons of song;<br>
  And think how from its neighbouring native sea<br>
  The pensive shell doth borrow melody.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not do the lordly masters wrong<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By filching fair words from the shining throng<br>
  Whose music haunts me as the wind a tree.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo, when a stranger in soft Syrian glooms<br>
  Shot through with sunset, treads the cedar dells,<br>
  And hears the breezy ring of elfin bells<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far down be where the white-haired cataract booms,<br>
  He, faint with sweetness caught from forest smells,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bears thence, unwitting, plunder of perfumes.</p>
