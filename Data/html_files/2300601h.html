<br>

<p class="first">HE highwayman raised himself from behind the
clump of gorse bush, which showed the smooth yellow flowers
bursting from the velvet pods in among the dangerous spikes.</p>

<p>With a look of discontent on his face, which had been
coarsened, hardened, and ever disfigured by a grim life and
sundry hard fights, he handled his heavy wooden-handled pistol,
and looked up and down the long twist of road, that one way
dipped to Portsmouth, and the other way rose over the hill to
London.</p>

<p>On the summit of this hill, and clear against a disturbed grey
autumn sky, stood the gallows. A skeleton hung there, tarred and
in chains. When the highwayman's eyes, lifted from the road,
roved round the landscape and glanced at the gibbet, they did not
rest there a second, nor did any change take place in his
expression. He was too well used to the sight, too well aware of
what his own end would be, if caught, to trouble in the least
about the ghastly object hanging on Gallows Hill, though only a
year ago those bones had been clothed in flesh&mdash;flesh and
blood&mdash;a living man, who had crouched, as he now crouched,
at the edge of the Devil's Punch Bowl, and looked, as he now
looked, greedily up and down the road for some traveller to
London.</p>

<p>The whole of the Frindhead, and particularly this lonely sweep
of road round the great hollow known as the Devil's Punch Bowl,
had a very ill repute, and was not the fine hunting-ground for
robbers and footpads that it once had been. Travellers from
Portsmouth to London came in parties and armed; very few came at
night, and fewer still alone.</p>

<p>The highwayman was reflecting on this with some bitterness as
he cautiously hoisted his long body over the edge of the hollow
and stood erect on the dusty road.</p>

<p>This caution on the part of the travelling public had rendered
a precarious and dangerous living even more precarious and
dangerous. Yet few of the ruffians plying their black trade in
these stretches of Surrey heath-land had forsaken their chosen
cover, and somehow they made their profit from poor sailors
travelling on foot with their little store of foreign gains, from
the timid, the helpless, and the lonely&mdash;and more than one
traveller had got no further on his journey than the edge of the
Devil's Punch Bowl, and more than one rough-made grave was hidden
in among the gorse bushes that lined that ugly hollow.</p>

<p>It was the big prizes that were far to seek now&mdash;the
hauls that made a gentleman of the road go like a gentleman, in
velvet and a French peruke, that enabled him to swagger it in
London taverns, and excite the envy of lesser rogues, until the
last spoils were spent, and the black mask was donned, and the
fleet steed mounted and turned in the direction of the Portsmouth
Road.</p>

<p>The ragged man now standing lonely in the autumn afternoon
could remember when he had flung down his guinea for a pint of
wine and his five-pound piece for the cards. He cursed himself at
the recollection, and gripped his heavy-handled pistol the
tighter. He had not murdered yet, but his mood was near to
murder.</p>

<p>Now, as he stared towards Portsmouth and at the little group
of cottages round the lonely inn "The Sign of the Huts," and a
change house for the London coach, the highwayman's face assumed
a lowering expression of rage and impatience, until he looked
like an ugly mastiff dog. He was known as Black Harry, from the
great swarthiness of his skin, which, always dark, was now burnt
bronze by wind and sun.</p>

<p>No one was in sight.</p>

<p>The man pulled out of his torn waistcoat a stolen watch and
glanced at the time.</p>

<p>It was nearly the hour for the London coach; but that went
armed and escorted, and was no prey for such as Black Harry. He
awaited another victim.</p>

<p>His very good friend, the landlord of "The Huts," had advised
him of the arrival of a rich and seeming foolish stranger, newly
landed at Portsmouth and returning home after long years
abroad.</p>

<p>This gentleman appeared to have valuables in his possession,
made a show of gold, had no servant, and travelled alone on
horseback, having a dislike for the slowness and jolting of the
coach. And this afternoon he was due to start on his journey
Londonwards.</p>

<p>Black Harry smacked his lips at the prospect of such a prize,
but he had, of late, but little faith in his own luck. He felt
morosely suspicious that the victim's heart would fail him at the
last minute&mdash;that he would take the coach or come
accompanied, or even go by some other road.</p>

<p>As he was speculating thus dismally, the coach, turning a bend
in the road, came into view. Black Harry dropped instantly back
into his hiding-place among the gorse and waited, hidden then at
the lip of the Punch Bowl, until the heavy coach, laden with
passengers and luggage, with the guard grasping a cocked
blunderbuss and an armed man beside the driver, had toiled up the
rising road that ran under Gallows Hill.</p>

<p>As soon as it was out of sight, Black Harry resumed his post
of observation, and his dark eyes glinted wrathfully and keenly
down the road.</p>

<p>Presently he gave an exclamation of relief and satisfaction,
and, drawing from his pocket a greasy, shabby square of black
crêpe, in which two holes had been cut, fastened it over his
face, tying the dirty strings at the back over his rough hair.
Then, pulling his torn hat down over his brows, he carefully
withdrew into ambush, concealing himself now behind the milestone
that told the distance to London.</p>

<p>His sharp, practised eye had seen a horseman in the distance
coming slowly round the turning where the road twisted to "The
Huts."</p>

<p>Black Harry waited patiently; his body was immobile, his mind
active with murderous thoughts. He meant murder this time; if the
traveller resisted or shrieked for help. Black Harry meant to
knock him on the head or put a bullet through him. Indeed, he was
debating whether this course would not, in any case, be simpler
and safer, when the traveller, seeing the loneliness of the road
and wishing to overtake the coach, put spurs to his horse, and
was soon alongside the milestone.</p>

<p>Black Harry, nimble as a youth, was out of his hiding-place,
with his pistol presented at the other's head, in a
twinkling.</p>

<p>"Dismount!" he said curtly, and his eyes gleamed greedily on
to the stout valise strapped to the back of the stranger's
saddle. "Dismount!" he repeated, and added a curse.</p>

<p>"Confound you for a fool!" said the traveller angrily. "What
do you want?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he flung himself sulkily from the saddle. The
highwayman was restored almost to good nature by the easiness of
his victory.</p>

<p>"You are the fool," he answered, "to be travelling alone round
the Devil's Punch Bowl."</p>

<p>The other shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I meant to keep in the lee of the coach," he answered, "but
was delayed in starting, and I was informed that the road here
was perfectly safe."</p>

<p>"You would be," said Black Harry.</p>

<p>He still held his pistol at cock and closely surveyed his
victim. He beheld a young man of pleasing good looks, wearing a
reddish peruke and a plain but fine suit of steel-blue cloth; his
appointments were rich, a pearl was in his cravat, a good paste
buckle in his hat, which was cocked, with some jauntiness, <i>à
la Pasnilies</i>. His complexion was swarthy, his eyes black, his
expression pleasant.</p>

<p>Black Harry knew at once that he had seen him before, but
could not remember where&mdash;probably in London, he thought, in
his better days.</p>

<p>The young man returned his scrutiny with impatience.</p>

<p>"Well, fellow, what do you want?" he demanded, with some
hauteur.</p>

<p>"You carry it off well, my young cock, I must say," returned
the other. "What do you suppose I want? All that you have, and
you should be thankful that I don't slit your silly windpipe and
send you down among those gorse bushes, where better men have
gone before you."</p>

<p>At these words the traveller turned pale, but preserved his
composure.</p>

<p>"You have a fine impudence," he remarked, and his eye
travelled up and down the road uneasily.</p>

<p>Black Harry saw his intention to call for help, and clapped
the muzzle of his pistol to his forehead.</p>

<p>"If you raise your voice, I shoot!" he said.</p>

<p>An ugly gleam flashed into the other's eye, and his face took
on an expression that made him more than ever familiar to the
highwayman; his hand went round to his belt, where his own pistol
hung uselessly, then he let it fall and shrugged and gave a short
laugh.</p>

<p>"The game is yours," he said. "Take what there is&mdash;I pay
for being a fool. I have been abroad so long that I have
forgotten English ways."</p>

<p>Sourly, yet with a certain air of philosophy, he took out his
watch, pocket-book, purse and chain, a fob with seals, then
uncovered and pulled the buckle from his hat.</p>

<p>Black Harry watched him with an expression of genial
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Been abroad long, have you?" he remarked. "Now, that's
strange, for it seems to me that I have seen your face
before."</p>

<p>"Scarcely likely, my friend," returned the other, taking the
pin from his cravat. "I have not been in this country since I was
a lad. Landed at Portsmouth the other day."</p>

<p>"Going home?" asked Black Harry. The sense that he not only
had known, but been familiar with, the other was puzzling him and
filling him with a vague uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Home!" repeated the other, with a peculiar intonation. Then
he added: "What are my affairs to you, you rascal?"</p>

<p>"They might be something," said the highwayman, pouching the
stolen goods. "Answer me civilly, and I will give you your stage
fare to London."</p>

<p>"A fine bargain!" was the sneering answer.</p>

<p>"There might be a worse. I know your face, and I want to know
your quality."</p>

<p>The stranger looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"My name is Edward Somerville," he answered. "I have come from
Jamaica, where I made a little&mdash;only a little&mdash;money. I
am here to settle in the Old Land. A little place in Kent has
been left me by a relative."</p>

<p>"Kent?" said Black Harry. "I am from Kent myself. Any
relatives there?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Where is your new place?"</p>

<p>"Near Rye, on the Sussex border."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he was bitterly eyeing the other, who was
unstrapping the valise from the saddle.</p>

<p>"I do not remember any Somervilles in that part," said he, not
pausing in his task, "and I know all round there well enough, or
used to. Many a time I've played at highwayman on the marsh
there. If your story is true, perhaps we played together there,
and that is how I came to know your face. That would be a strange
thing, would it not?"</p>

<p>"An unlikely one."</p>

<p>"Oh, I mingled with the quality then!" said Black Harry. "And
because of your story, lie or truth, I'll give you back your
horse, which is better than your coach fare to London."</p>

<p>"And suits you better," returned the other quickly. "The beast
would betray you&mdash;be traced&mdash;and you know it."</p>

<p>The highwayman laughed and, still fondling the pistol, kicked
the valise behind the milestone. On top of it he laid the pistols
he had taken from the traveller.</p>

<p>"To think of Kent, and Rye, and Romney Marsh," he said, in a
kindly tone, "and you and I playing there as children, and never
guessing that it would come to this between us!"</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Mr. Somerville shortly.</p>

<p>"That would be telling! Yet, if I said it, 'twould leave you
no wiser, the same as you leave me foolish, talking of Edward
Somerville. <i>There aren't any Somervilles in that part of
Kent.</i>"</p>

<p>The conviction with which he spoke seemed to take the other
man aback.</p>

<p>"You know that, do you?" he muttered.</p>

<p>Black Harry was still struggling over his identity.</p>

<p>"Who are you, now&mdash;a Neve, a Curtis, a Martin, a
Carter?"</p>

<p>"And who are you, in Heaven's name?" cried Mr. Somerville, in
agitation.</p>

<p>"You are not a Burr," continued the highwayman. "There are
only two of them, and one's dead, and I know where the other
be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The traveller interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said, "the meaning of this word&mdash;cuckoo
pint."</p>

<p>Each now regarded the other with great intensity.</p>

<p>"Cuckoo pint?" repeated the highwayman slowly. "Why, that is a
little flower that comes in the spring&mdash;a lilac flower on a
slender stem&mdash;grow in among the primroses they do. Plenty of
them in Kent and along those Sussex lanes by Romney Marsh."</p>

<p>"So many of them," returned Mr. Somerville, "that those boys
playing at highwaymen there, and robbing coots' nests, and
hunting for plovers' eggs, used them as a
badge&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Black Harry interrupted.</p>

<p>"By Heavens, so they did! Wore them in their caps and in their
lapels, and the password was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cuckoo pint," finished Mr. Somerville.</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;so it was."</p>

<p>"And when the little flower was over&mdash;for 'tis a bloom of
earliest spring&mdash;they wore a lilac fairing&mdash;a ribbon or
a thread."</p>

<p>The highwayman peered eagerly into his face.</p>

<p>"Which were you?" he demanded. "Which of those boys? It is
over twenty years ago, but I knew at once I had seen you
before."</p>

<p>Mr. Somerville appeared moved and agitated.</p>

<p>"Answer me a question, and I will answer yours. You remember
John Burr, the leader of the boys?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You said just now one of the Burrs was dead, and that you
knew where the other was. Now, which is dead?"</p>

<p>The other grinned.</p>

<p>"It isn't John&mdash;he is alive."</p>

<p>"Frank, then. Frank is dead?"</p>

<p>"This ten year and more."</p>

<p>The traveller smiled, then said coolly</p>

<p>"You have been sadly misinformed. It must be John who is
dead."</p>

<p>"That he isn't."</p>

<p>"No more is Frank, my friend."</p>

<p>"How do you know, to be so sure and positive&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I am Frank Burr, that is why. I'm Frank, my good fellow!"</p>

<p>"And I am John, and so we meet. I thought you were dead."</p>

<p>He pulled off the dirty black mask, and the two brothers
stared at each other.</p>

<p>"A strange meeting," said the younger dryly, "an unpleasant
meeting! When I returned to England, I did not think to find my
own brother clapping a pistol to my head!"</p>

<p>John looked sullen. He lowered his weapon, but did not cast it
away.</p>

<p>"How did you come to this?" added Frank.</p>

<p>"That is a long story."</p>

<p>"It must be a strange one."</p>

<p>"No stranger, maybe, than the story of how you came to be a
fine gentleman with a horse and broadcloth, and gold in your
pocket and a buckle to your hat."</p>

<p>"I have prospered," returned the other composedly. "I have
worked and saved&mdash;sugar-planting in Jamaica."</p>

<p>"That is vague enough. How did you get to Jamaica?"</p>

<p>"I worked my passage."</p>

<p>"But there was a man wrote from London you were dead fifteen
years ago."</p>

<p>"By my request that was; I wished to be dead to all of
you."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>The younger brother replied with some fierceness&mdash;</p>

<p>"Because of the bad blood in us, that was coming out in you
all&mdash;you with your ill name for a rogue, Kitty going as a
strolling player, another sister running off to London with
squire's son, the little farm falling to pieces. <i>You</i> know,
John, why I left home!"</p>

<p>The elder man looked abashed, his glance travelled uneasily
from his own ragged attire to the neat elegance of the other.</p>

<p>"Well, you have done better than any of us," he remarked
sadly. "Poor Kitty went off in consumption, and Nan died in
Bridewell, and for me&mdash;" he jerked his head towards Gallows
Hill and the gibbet, "I suppose there is <i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>Frank made a gesture of horror.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to persist in your miserable life after this? Has
it given you no shock to think you might have had a brother's
blood to answer for?"</p>

<p>John shuddered; he remembered that he had contemplated murder
when he had gazed up and down the lonely road, waiting for his
victim.</p>

<p>"You were always cleverer than I," he answered. "I'll not deny
that I've made a failure, but I've had my fine days, my pleasant
times."</p>

<p>"Will you not repent?"</p>

<p>"Repent? Best forget me, Frank. I'll not disgrace your name,
for none knows who I am. For the matter of that, you have changed
it, too."</p>

<p>"Because of you," returned the other sternly&mdash;"because of
you, and Nan, and Kitty!"</p>

<p>"No need to be afraid of us," said John sombrely. "Take back
the honest name of Burr and make it respected; I shall not
trouble you."</p>

<p>The younger man raised his hand and let it fall with a gesture
of despair; his head sank on his breast, and he stood like one
humiliated.</p>

<p>"A fine home-coming for me," he said&mdash;"a fine
home-coming!"</p>

<p>John kicked back the valise into the middle of the road. "Take
it," he said.</p>

<p>Frank smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"It contains but a few papers, some mementos, my little
savings. I am in your power, if you like." He shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>For answer, the highwayman lifted the valise and restrapped it
on the saddle.</p>

<p>"You had the password," he answered. "'Cuckoo pint,' eh? Those
who had that sign did not rob each other."</p>

<p>He unpouched the personal belongings of the other and thrust
them into Frank's hands.</p>

<p>"This shows good in you, John; you are not wholly hardened or
lost. Take some of this money?" And he held out his purse.</p>

<p>The highwayman spurned the proffered gift with the back of his
rough hand.</p>

<p>"'Tis honest money; keep it to spend honestly. As for me,
forget me; that is the only service I ask of you."</p>

<p>"Can I not help you, for the sake of old days, in any
way?"</p>

<p>"In no way," responded John fiercely. "Get on your road to
London before the dark comes."</p>

<p>For a second the two men looked at each other, then the
highwayman picked up the other's pistols and handed them to
him.</p>

<p>"Good luck!" he said shortly.</p>

<p>The younger brother held out his hand in silence. John did not
take it; he turned away abashed, then stopped and looked back
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"You might&mdash;sometimes&mdash;pray for me," he said
jerkily, and then plunged hastily down the sides of the Devil's
Punch Bowl.</p>

<p>Frank Burr mounted and, putting his horse to a trot,
disappeared in the autumn dusk that was gathering over the London
road.</p>

<p>John went down and down among the gorse bushes until he
reached the very bottom of the great pit, where he could no
longer see the gibbet on Gallows Hill.</p>

<p>Sunk in gloom, he seated himself on a boulder and turned over
in his mind the difference between his brother and himself. In
that moment he wished that he had led a virtuous life, that he
was honoured and respected, like Frank. Very passionately he
wished it; he began even to think of God, and to reflect very
uneasily on some of the ugly deeds of his ugly career.</p>

<p>He was roused by the appearance of a gaunt companion, who came
hurrying cautiously through the brushwood and heath.</p>

<p>John eyed him with distaste. Russet Tom he was known as, and
his dirty and villainous countenance seemed typical of all the
combination of the outcast's life.</p>

<p>"Well?" said John sourly.</p>

<p>The other was panting with haste and excitement.</p>

<p>"Slim Dick is due to pass here!" he gasped. "Got a little
portmanteau full of gold and jewels&mdash;alone&mdash;our
chance!"</p>

<p>John was interested now. Slim Dick was a thief and swindler, a
gentleman rogue far beyond in craft and cunning such as himself
and his companions&mdash;a master-villain of many disguises, who
had always eluded capture, and successfully carried through many
daring frauds and robberies.</p>

<p>"Slim Dick near here?"</p>

<p>Russet Tom explained rapidly.</p>

<p>"Heard this morning. Been all day getting to know the rights
of it. He is here, at 'The Huts,' travelling as a private
gentleman. All the booty of his last deal in gold and diamonds in
a little valise. Bow Street runners after him. Going alone to
disarm suspicion. You and I could lighten his load&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>An awful look came into John's eyes.</p>

<p>"What does he call himself?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Mr. Edward Somervillle. Just landed from Jamaica, he
says."</p>

<p>John remembered the valise he had actually had in his
possession, the watch and chain and purse that he had returned,
his abasement before his brother&mdash;his brother who was Slim
Dick!</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you?" cried Russet Tom angrily. "Come
along and waylay the prize!"</p>

<p>"He has gone," groaned the highwayman&mdash;"gone! Frank
always had the luck!" He stared before him mazed, then he added
in the tone of one confounded: "And I asked him to pray for
me!"</p>
