<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Preface"></a>Preface</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>The first edition of  this book was called &ldquo;Budgeree Ballads&rdquo; for what seemed good and sufficient  reasons. The title, it has since been found, was not the happiest that could  have been chosen, </p>
<p>Owing to limited  knowledge of the blackfellow&rsquo;s vernacular, and, perhaps, unconsciously  influenced by the weird expression and the face of the representative of the  race whose visage adorned the cover of the first edition, some very excellent  people have looked askance at the book. They associated the word &ldquo;Budgeree&rdquo;  with a swear word. Of course, this idea would not have occurred to any but those  persons whose moral ideas had been sharpened to an extremely fine point. </p>
<p>Other persons have  associated the word &lsquo;&lsquo;Ballads&rdquo; with those little things which are used by  pale-faced youths to inflict suffering on their patient fellow mortals at  so-called musical evenings. </p>
<p>Neither of these  ideas Conveys a correct impression of the book. We have no wish to offend the  most scrupulous nor to deceive the most dense, and have therefore thought it  well to re-christen the book and to re-illustrate the cover, and we would like  to assure the super-sensitive that, although they will find some fun in the  book, they will find nothing that they need hide from their daughters. </p>
<p>The present edition  takes its name from one of the pieces in the book, which has, since its first  publication, made a name for itself. The author, while thanking his readers for  their generous appreciation in the past, trusts that appreciation will not be  lessened by the change in name. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, what&rsquo;s  in a name?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T.  E. S.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glebe Point, 24th January, 1910.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="SuburbanFelicity"></a>Suburban  Felicity</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>My name is Maepherson, an unlucky person,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose life was once filled with felicity,<br>
  Free from calamity, living in amity,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm in my happy simplicity. </p>
<p>I never got frisky  on brandy or whisky,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was never a proud man or haughty one,<br>
  If I had to address you, I tried to impress you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With good words and never a naughty one. </p>
<p>Industrious and  thrifty, the right side of fifty.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A model of strict punctuality,<br>
  I paid my shoemaker, my butcher, my baker,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And grocer with prompt regularity. </p>
<p>I was surely  demented the day I consented&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A victim to female duplicity&mdash;<br>
  To give up my pretty, snug house in the city<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In search of suburban felicity. </p>
<p>But a cottage was  found with an acre of ground&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were charmed with the calmness and peace of it&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a sweet situation, not far from the station;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They got me to take a long lease of it. </p>
<p>The wife was  delighted, the daughters excited,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant assented quite graciously,<br>
  And, as the removal got Susan&rsquo;s approval,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started to pack ostentatiously. </p>
<p>But short was our  levity, sad in its brevity,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For time soon revealed our delusion;<br>
  Revulsion came fast&mdash;ere the first night had passed&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were filled with dismay and confusion. </p>
<p>As daylight was  peeping in, Susan came creeping in,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying: &ldquo;I will not deceive you, mum,<br>
  I don&rsquo;t like complaining, but as to remaining<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t, so I&rsquo;m going to leave you, mum.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Her tears falling  faster, she said: &ldquo;I like master,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls are both sweet, pretty creaters,<br>
  I&rsquo;ve no fault to find, mum, with you&mdash;you are kind, mum&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can&rsquo;t stand the plaguey muskeeters. </p>
<p>When I popped into  bed, mum, I wrapped up my head, mum,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tried all I could to bamboozle &rsquo;em.<br>
  But wished the muskeeters, the horrid maneaters,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Woolloomooloo or Jerusalem. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve riddled me,  please, from my neck to my knees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though I&rsquo;ve no wish, mum, abrupt to be,<br>
  I&rsquo;m lumps from my nose to the tips of my toes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the subbubs ain&rsquo;t what they&rsquo;re cracked up to be.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The poor girl I  pitied, and straightway admitted<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the facts as she stated them;<br>
  For I&rsquo;d spent the night fighting the wretches whose biting<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had tortured me so that I hated them. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d been scratching  and tearing and very swearing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one little wretch in particular near<br>
  Had been stabbing and stinging, persistently singing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And buzzing around my auricular. </p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s nought  but complaining, for when it is raining,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water comes through like a flood on us;<br>
  It&rsquo;s quite a sensation to get to the station.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we get there there&rsquo;s much mud on us. </p>
<p>The fiend who  erected this cottage neglected <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws of applied hydrostatics;<br>
  So the missus is wheezing, the daughters are sneezing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have got chronic rheumatics. </p>
<p>If we shut up the  doors, when Boreas roars,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The carbonic acid is filling us;<br>
  As this sweet habitation has no ventilation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shiver in draughts that are killing us. </p>
<p>The window&rsquo;s are  creaking, the water pipes leaking,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceilings all threaten to fall on us,<br>
  The floor boards are gaping, the gas is escaping,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chimneys belch smoke like a pall on us. </p>
<p>I, who once was  contented, am now quite demented,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m losing my centre of gravity;<br>
  Reason is failing me, trouble is nailing me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to the depths of depravity. </p>
<p>My stock of  morality&rsquo;s reached its finality,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtue has lost its tenacity;<br>
  Where is my piety? Where my propriety?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone! with my business capacity. </p>
<p>Night has no rest  in it; life has no zest in it;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family ties have no charm in them;<br>
  In my moral obliquity, I use, with iniquity,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swear words, and can&rsquo;t see the harm in them. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting  delirious, calling down various<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plagues on the building fraternity.<br>
  Wishing for one of &rsquo;em&mdash;son of a gun of &rsquo;em-<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tic doloureux through eternity. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to  bewilder that brute of a builder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By getting him home(?) where I&rsquo;d pop on him;<br>
  And I&rsquo;d bump on the floor, or I&rsquo;d bang the back door,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which would make the whole edifice drop on him. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m dreaming of  suicide&mdash;regicide&mdash;homicide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gloating on crime and profanity;<br>
  My mind is chaotic: I&rsquo;m quite idiotic&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A caricature on humanity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMeeting"></a>The Meeting</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>See yon fair lady!  Mark her queenly tread,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As gracefully she moves along the street;<br>
  Note with what dignity she lifts her head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And passes on. Not thus we used to meet.<br>
  I wonder do her thoughts sometimes depict<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time, when, like a dream, she crossed my life&mdash;<br>
  Ere I became a social derelict,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she became a money-lender&rsquo;s wife? </p>
<p>Take care, fair  lady, lest your silken train<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should touch the skirts of that more humble she<br>
  Who walks beside you! They may still retain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some faint aroma from the factory<br>
  Or shop, wherein she toils for daily bread.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;s a mere woman, clothed in hard-earned rags.<br>
  You are a <i>lady</i>, who preferred,  instead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deck yourself with tainted money bags. </p>
<p>I knew you both,  when each was young and fair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was not so ugly, nor so old.<br>
  She gave her life for love&mdash;his life to share;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You flouted love, and sold yourself for gold.<br>
  Now, widowed, she must work for daily bread;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dresses shabbily; her cheeks are pale;<br>
  While you can wear a fortune on your head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filched from some wretch who gave a bill of sale. </p>
<p>Yet, when her weary  eyelids close in rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She lives again the spring-time of her youth,<br>
  Her soul seeks his, among the ever-blessed.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wakes, refreshed, to innocence and truth.<br>
  What are your dreams, when tossing restlessly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the Bloated One to whom you&rsquo;re sold?<br>
  Are they of those whose grinding poverty<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has splashed with blood your foul, ill-gotten gold? </p>
<p>Do shades of  greasy, hook-nosed bailiffs seek<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To steal your gew-gaws as you lie asleep?<br>
  Do famished wives, and babes with pallid cheek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sighing crowds around your curtains creep?<br>
  And do you wonder, when at break of day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hear the storm, and wake in sudden fright,<br>
  Whether the wretches, sold off yesterday,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have perished in the wintry streets at night?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MyTypiste"></a>My  Typiste</b></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m an awfully  sensitive man,<br>
  And I move in exclusive society,<br>
  Moulding all my affairs on a plan<br>
  Based on goodness and perfect propriety.<br>
  I have not got a blot on my fame<br>
  (Or I had not until very recently);<br>
  Yet my once stainless name&mdash;<br>
  I confess it with shame&mdash;<br>
  Has been dragged through the mire quite indecently.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve a typiste. A  beautiful girl!<br>
  With such cheeks! Ah! How peachy and pink they are!<br>
  Her teeth are like mother-o&rsquo;-pearl,<br>
  And like nectar her lips (or I think they are).<br>
  She&rsquo;s the kind of girl all men admire,<br>
  For she&rsquo;s perfect in figure and feature;<br>
  At my special desire<br>
  She sings in the choir,<br>
  And in my Sabbath-school she&rsquo;s a teacher. </p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s aught  should be free from the liar.<br>
  And from slander be quite independent,<br>
  &rsquo;Tis a maiden who sings in the choir,<br>
  And a Sabbath-school superintendent.<br>
  Alas! mud to the whitest robe clings,<br>
  Leaving stains on its natural purity.<br>
  And foul slander grief brings<br>
  To the sweetest of things,<br>
  Where&mdash;Oh! where&mdash;is our moral security? </p>
<p>I admit if I work  back at night<br>
  That I can&rsquo;t let her go without missing her;<br>
  But I strongly deny he was right<br>
  When the caretaker charged me with kissing her.<br>
  He&rsquo;s a fraud! When I gave him a crown,<br>
  He admitted his eyes had deceived him,<br>
  Yet he went round the town,<br>
  As he knocked the crown down,<br>
  Telling stories&mdash;and people believed him. </p>
<p>So remorseless is  Rumour&rsquo;s long tongue,<br>
  And so prone is mankind to malignity;<br>
  That my friends, both the old and the young,<br>
  Seem to treat me with studied indignity.<br>
  Why, the office boy grins when I speak,<br>
  Quite ignoring our social disparity:<br>
  While my clerk, once so meek,<br>
  Sticks his tongue in his cheek,<br>
  Scarcely trying to hide his hilarity. </p>
<p>Though again and  again I&rsquo;ve declared<br>
  That the stories are wicked inventions,<br>
  And the sweetest of things is prepared<br>
  To corroborate all my contentions,<br>
  Yet the people all credit the bar<br>
  And, his lie being in the ascendent,<br>
  The effect is most dire<br>
  To a girl in the choir<br>
  And a Sabbath-school superintendent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="WhyDohertyDied"></a>Why Doherty Died</b></h2>
<p>It was out on the  Bogan, near Billabong Creek,<br>
  Where the sky shines like brass seven days in the week,<br>
  Where the buzzin&rsquo; mosquitoes annoy you all night,<br>
  And the blowflies come wakin&rsquo; you up at daylight;<br>
  Where the people get weary and sad and forlorn,<br>
  Till they wish they had died long before they were born;<br>
  There&rsquo;s a flat near the river, I knew the place well,<br>
  For &rsquo;twas there Dinny Doherty kept the hotel.</p>
<p>Dinny Doherty died.  &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t aisy to say<br>
  Just the cause of the trouble that tuk him away;<br>
  If &rsquo;twas measles or whoopin&rsquo; cough, croup or catarrh,<br>
  Or the things docthers pickle and put in a jar.<br>
  Not a docther was nigh when he come by his death,<br>
  So we reckoned he died just through shortage of breath,<br>
  We didn&rsquo;t know how these fine points to decide;<br>
  What we did know for certain was: Doherty died. </p>
<p>The coroner came up  from Bottle-nose Flat,<br>
  And twelve of us wid him on Doherty sat.<br>
  The hate was intense; there was whisky galore&mdash;<br>
  When we&rsquo;d finished we wern&rsquo;t as wise as before.<br>
  We were roastin&rsquo;. Yet there, wid a shmile on his face,<br>
  Lay poor Dinny, the only cool man in the place.<br>
  Yet, divil a one in the crowd could decide,<br>
  Or even imagine, why Doherty died. </p>
<p>The old pub it  seemed lonesome whin Dinny was gone,<br>
  Lavin&rsquo; poor Kitty Doherty grievin&rsquo; alone.<br>
  Every time that I called she cried: &ldquo;Phwat will I do?<br>
  Darlin&rsquo; Dinny, come back to me, Cushla! Wirroo!<br>
  Faith it&rsquo;s lonely I am to-day, Dinny, asthore!<br>
  Don&rsquo;t be sayin&rsquo; you&rsquo;re dead, that I&rsquo;ll see you no more.&rdquo;<br>
  Whin I thried to console her, she bitterly cried:<br>
  &ldquo;I have no one to love me since Doherty died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kape pinin&rsquo;,&rdquo;  says she, &ldquo;till I&rsquo;m mere shkin and bone.&rdquo;<br>
  (Poor Kitty! She only weighed siventeen shtone.)<br>
  &ldquo;Sure, life widhout love is like bread widhout yaste.&rdquo;<br>
  Poor Kitty! Her heart was as big as her waist.<br>
  And what is the pain?&mdash;&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t ivery one knows<br>
  Whin a big heart like Kitty&rsquo;s wid love overflow so.<br>
  Kitty&rsquo;s love was as broad as the ocean is wide,<br>
  But she&rsquo;d no one to share it since Doherty died. </p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas a hot summer&rsquo;s  day when a visit I paid,<br>
  For the hate was a hundhred and tin in the shade;<br>
  Poor Kitty looked sad as I inthered the gate,<br>
  And her cheeks were quite moist wid her tears (and the hate);<br>
  But &rsquo;twas cosy she looked as she sat in the bar,<br>
  And I whispered: &ldquo;Poor girl, is it lonely ye are?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Bedad! Lonely&rsquo;s no name for it,&rdquo; Kitty replied,<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just frettin&rsquo; me heart out since Doherty died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, says I, &ldquo;Faith,  this isn&rsquo;t the weather to fret!&rdquo;<br>
  And I wiped her plump cheeks, that were clammy and wet;<br>
  &ldquo;Sure, Kitty,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you must hould up your head,<br>
  For the world isn&rsquo;t impty if one man is dead.<br>
  To be livin&rsquo; and pinin&rsquo; alone&rsquo;s a disgrace;<br>
  Can you find no good man to take Doherty&rsquo;s place?&rdquo;<br>
  Then she shmiled through her tears, and she said as she sighed:<br>
  &ldquo;Ah! the good men are scarce since poor Doherty died.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Och,&rdquo;  says I, &ldquo;to talk that way is fiddle-de-dee;<br>
  There are good men left yet, Kitty&mdash;what about me?&rdquo;<br>
  Then, before you&rsquo;d say &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; o&rsquo;er the bar she had leapt,<br>
  And she flung herself on to me bosom and wept,<br>
  &rsquo;Twas in vain that I thried to get out to get cool,<br>
  She was harder to shift than a big bale of wool.<br>
  And I thought, as she lay on me bosom and cried:<br>
  &ldquo;Faith! &rsquo;Tis <i>now</i> that I <i>know</i> why poor Doherty died.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Sympathy</b><b> </b></p>
<p>We worry and fret, and the world appears<br>
  To be swathed in sorrow and bathed in tears,<br>
  While this strange inscrutable thing called Life<br>
  Seems fashioned for jealousy, pain, and strife. </p>
<p>We watch men cheat,  and we hear them lie;<br>
  They gather in riches, and then&mdash;they die.<br>
  Life&rsquo;s frauds and its fallacies fill our view.<br>
  And nought seems tangible, good, or true. </p>
<p>For men grow  callous, and hard, and cold,<br>
  And they pawn their souls for the bright, red; gold;<br>
  They cringe to Mammon, and sneer at pain,<br>
  Then, dying, they mourn that they&rsquo;ve lived in vain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Sympathy"></a>Sympathy</b></h2>
<p>Yet, as in a  wilderness, parched and drear,<br>
  We may find a fountain, with waters clear;<br>
  So, even the loneliest life may get<br>
  Some comforting draught from existence yet. </p>
<p>For we hear a  voice, and a phrase or word<br>
  Wakes the music of some long forgotten chord;<br>
  Or we see a face, through the fog and mist,<br>
  And we know that kindness and truth exist. </p>
<p>The voice may grow  silent, the smile be brief,<br>
  But they softened sorrow, and lightened grief,<br>
  And the kindly word and the cheery smile<br>
  Have illumined the world for a little while. </p>
<p>For just as the  whole seemed dark and dim,<br>
  The clouds were rent, and we saw the sun;<br>
  And, for ever, through life, that bright ray will be<br>
  Engrossed in gold on our memory.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheTransformationOfMary"></a>The Transformation Of Mary</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>Mary was a vision  bright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enthralling and entrancing;<br>
  Mary was a beam of light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That through my life came dancing.<br>
  Form and feature all complete,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With manners like a fairy;<br>
  Ne&rsquo;er was mortal half so sweet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my bewitching Mary. </p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s skin was  smooth and fair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cheeks like roses glowing;<br>
  Massive waves of golden hair<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In shining curls were flowing.<br>
  Teeth as white as falling snow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twixt ruby lips abiding;<br>
  Mary&rsquo;s well-cut gown could show<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where classic curves were hiding. </p>
<p>Sailing in the  sunset&rsquo;s glow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The boat was gently rocking),<br>
  Her high curved instep showed below<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dainty, silken stocking.<br>
  Here, thought I, is Beauty&rsquo;s Queen&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A living, breathing fairy;<br>
  If perfect beauty e&rsquo;er was seen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis surely here &rsquo;Tis Mary. </p>
<p>Wavelets rippled &rsquo;neath  our prow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air with music filling,<br>
  Scented breezes fanned my brow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set my pulses thrilling.<br>
  While I dreamed at Beauty&rsquo;s feet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden squall surprised us&mdash;<br>
  Caught me napping at the sheet&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in a trice, capsized us. </p>
<p>Mary gave a little  scream,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then plunged into the water:<br>
  Quickly waking from my dream<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swam about and sought her.<br>
  Soon a frenzied cry I gave;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine my quandary,<br>
  When I saw a wicked wave<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embrace&mdash;then swallow&mdash;Mary. </p>
<p>Down into the deep  I dived,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved to save my fairy;<br>
  Vowing, that if I survived,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twould only be with Mary.<br>
  When at length I reached the shore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exhausted, faint and tripping<br>
  &nbsp;Mary&rsquo;s senseless form I bore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All limp and damp and dripping. </p>
<p>Was it she? Or was  I mad?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! the transformation!<br>
  This was not the girl I had<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my imagination.<br>
  Gone the roses from her cheeks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And disappeared the dimples,<br>
  Her complexion lay in streaks,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the streaks peeped pimples. </p>
<p>Where were now the  pearly teeth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That once inflamed my wishes?<br>
  Gone the cruel waves beneath.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To scare the little fishes.<br>
  Where the mass of golden hair<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which my eyes had gloated?<br>
  Out upon the wavelets there<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It mocked me as it floated.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s bust was all  displaced,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as my eyes grew bolder,<br>
  I saw the left half near her waist,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other on her shoulder.<br>
  Mary&rsquo;s hips were fallen in!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It made my bosom rankle<br>
  To see one instep on her shin,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other&mdash;near her ankle. </p>
<p>Disenthroned was  Beauty&rsquo;s Queen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had my poor heart captured;<br>
  Gone the crown whose golden sheen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had my fond soul enraptured.<br>
  Gone the goddess I revered,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dreams&mdash;so visionary&mdash;<br>
  Vanished, faded, disappeared.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, what remained&mdash;was Mary. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may journey from Cooma to Cairo,<br>
  But, you cannot explain till my story you know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the Devil appeared at Monaro. </p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis by Micky, the  stumper, the story is told,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who confesses the fright made him silly:<br>
  Yet there isn&rsquo;t a man that&rsquo;s more truthful or bold<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Bombala to Yarrangobilly.<br>
  It was Micky himself saw the Devil pass by&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was on the big culvert, or near it,<br>
  And for fear you should doubt me, and think that I lie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis in Micky&rsquo;s own words you shall hear it. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I was shtrollin&rsquo;,&rdquo;  says he, &ldquo;on a dark, moonless night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me camp, near the edge of the clearin&rsquo;,<br>
  I was not to say sober, and not to say tight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no mortal or baste was I fearin&rsquo;.<br>
  Not a sound could I hear but the voice of a frog;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he soothed me that way wid his croakin&rsquo;<br>
  That I lit up me pipe and sat down on a log,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And enj&rsquo;yed mesilf pacefully shmokin&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Faith, I didn&rsquo;t  have long to me rist to attind,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I hadn&rsquo;t had time to shtart shnorin&rsquo;<br>
  When me heart shtarted jumpin&rsquo;, for just round the bind<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ould Divil came puffin&rsquo; an&rsquo; roarin&rsquo;.<br>
  He&rsquo;d the skpeed of a comet, the voice of a bull,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his one eye so brightly was stharin&rsquo;<br>
  That it lit up the road like the moon at the full,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bedazzled me sight wid its glarin&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a cry could I  cry. Not a word could I shpeak,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a prayer could me frozen tongue utther;<br>
  But I ran for the culvert that crosses the creek<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a hare, wid me heart in a flutther.<br>
  I was not very hopeful, run which way I would,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made sure the nixt minute he&rsquo;d find me;<br>
  But I made for the culvert as fast as I could,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Divil came tootin&rsquo; behind me. </p>
<p>&ldquo;All the sins of me  youth crowded thick on me mind,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the crimes I&rsquo;d been afther committin&rsquo;;<br>
  So I thried, as I ran, a few prayer-words to find.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I couldn&rsquo;t find one that was fittin&rsquo;.<br>
  All me wind was clane gone, I was ready to faint,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid the shweat in me eyes, fit to blind me;<br>
  And I didn&rsquo;t know whether to call on a saint<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or compound with the Divil behind me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arrived at the  culvert, and that purty quick,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Divil, I found, could outrun me;<br>
  For he came up behind and he gave me a kick,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clane into the wather it sphun me.<br>
  I&rsquo;d been kicked by a horse, I&rsquo;d been tossed by a cow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a scrum or a fight I could revel,<br>
  I&rsquo;d been flattened at football, but never till now<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I been a football for the Divil. </p>
<p>&ldquo;When I crept up  the bank, sore and wet, but alone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may bet I did not thry to find him;<br>
  The Divil, his eye, and his &lsquo;Toot Toot&rsquo; were gone,<br>
  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the shmell of  his breath shtayed behind him.<br>
  </i>Phwat was that? Who said mother-car! You, Billy Dunn?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you did, faith, your eyes I&rsquo;d be shwellin&rsquo;.<br>
  Bring the best man you have and I&rsquo;ll fight him for fun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to prove it&rsquo;s the truth I&rsquo;ve been tellin&rsquo;.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But nobody wishes  Mick&rsquo;s anger to fan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they say truth is stranger than fiction;<br>
  For Micky the stumper&rsquo;s the wrong sort of man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To brook anything like contradiction.<br>
  If he tells you the tale, <i>think</i> whatever you choose,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For to doubt him is likely to grieve him;<br>
  Just remember he stands six feet two in his shoes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you&rsquo;ll make up your mind to believe him.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I turned my face up to the rain. </p>

<p>Nora O&rsquo;Grady, of Warragaroo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a pleasant and plump little lady,<br>
  Buxom and fair, she was just thirty-two,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the widow of Michael O&rsquo;Grady.<br>
  Down by the creek, where the sad willows wave.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last trumpet call Michael waited,<br>
  And oft were the flowers that grew on his grave<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his widow&rsquo;s salt tears irrigated. </p>
<p>Nora was doleful,  but Nora was fair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the men folk all thought it a pity<br>
  That the vampire of Grief, and the ghoul of Despair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should wax fat on a mortal so pretty.<br>
  Suitors came wooing, but Nora was cold&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never an icicle colder;<br>
  But, thirty-two summers is not very old,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the suitors grew bolder and bolder. </p>
<p>Jimmy the stockman  and Frank from the mill<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used to bring her fresh fruit every Sunday;<br>
  Young Mr. Watson, who owned the Red Hill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to pay Ida respects every Monday.<br>
  Half-a-score others came three times a week,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they had no effect on the lady;<br>
  Mostly they found she was down at the creek<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dropping tears on the grave of O&rsquo;Grady. </p>
<p>Scones baked by  Nora were fit for a queen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her fritters fair feed for a fairy;<br>
  Fat were her kine in her paddocks of green,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the pride of her heart was her dairy.<br>
  Never was dairy so clean and so sweet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there never was dairymaid neater;<br>
  Two queries the people were wont to repeat&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether she or her cream were the sweeter? </p>
<p>Once, about midday,  a sturdy young scamp<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put his face in the door of the dairy.<br>
  &ldquo;God bless your milk ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on thramp,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I feel that I&rsquo;ve seen me good fairy.<br>
  Och! the fine hair, you have&mdash;it&rsquo;s softer than silk!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it you or a queen I&rsquo;m addressin&rsquo;?<br>
  God bless your cows. For a drink of your milk<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll call down on your dairy a blessin&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Och! the fine  dhrink!&rdquo; said the rogue, with a sigh.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis a dhrink for the gods, so I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;;<br>
  But how can I tell, when I look at your eye.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;If it&rsquo;s necthar or milk I&rsquo;ve been dhrinkin&rsquo;?<br>
  God keep O&rsquo;Grady, and on the last day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May he meet his reward whin they find him!<br>
  Poor man! it was hard to be taken away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lavin&rsquo; such a sweet crayther behind him.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Nora felt sad, when  he bade her good day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his manner, half earnest, half joking;<br>
  He had a most wheedling and comforting way.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his careless &ldquo;Good-day!&rdquo; was provoking.<br>
  Mournful she sighed for some spot, cool and damp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she sought for a nook, cool and shady,<br>
  Down by the creek. And, lo! there was the scamp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>He was clearing  the weeds from O&rsquo;Grady</i>. </p>
<p>Pity, they say, is  related to Love.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fair Nora, though nigh broken-hearted,<br>
  Accepted the delicate tribute above<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remains of her darling departed.<br>
  Down by the willows she wandered each day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a state that was sweet and enthralling,<br>
  Vain were her tears. The scamp kissed them away.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said: &ldquo;To prevint them from falling.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Nora was constant,  but Nora was weak;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had no one to counsel or guide her;<br>
  And up in the dairy, or down by the creek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Brady, the scamp, was beside her.<br>
  Jonquils and daffodils grew as of yore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over Michael&rsquo;s secluded location;<br>
  But none of them looked <i>quite</i> so  fresh as before,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they hadn&rsquo;t so much irrigation. </p>
<p>Brady removed the  white cap from her head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the widow proved very forgiving;<br>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;all the weeds from the dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, why should they bide on the living?&rdquo;<br>
  Friends praised the flowers in her bridal bouquet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day she became Mrs. Brady;<br>
  She said, and she smiled, as she threw them away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the last from the grave of O&rsquo;Grady.&rdquo; </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  it is!<br>
  Since Molony bought Biddy her new Sunday hat<br>
  All the peace has departed from Billygoat Flat. </p>
<p>When I heard that  Molony was made a J.P.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was pleased at the honour he&rsquo;d got;<br>
  For Molony was always quite friendly wid me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of envy I hadn&rsquo;t a jot.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was  Biddy, his wife,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caused  the trouble and strife ;<br>
  Pat Molony&rsquo;s a man. But she&rsquo;s not,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  she ain&rsquo;t.<br>
  And she said: &ldquo;You must buy me a new Sunday hat<br>
  Now you&rsquo;ve got the P.J.-ship of Billygoat Flat.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Well, she bothered  him so that he went into town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And brought back the best hat he could buy;<br>
  It had roses all round, and a bird on the crown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a big feather stickin&rsquo; up high.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It  had rows upon rows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of  bright ribbons and bows,<br>
  &rsquo;Twas enough to make blind horses shy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  it was!<br>
  And she called on the neighbours, and flaunted her hat,<br>
  Till the women went crazy on Billygoat Flat, </p>
<p>When we met the  Molonys, a fortnight to-day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then that the trouble began.<br>
  It was down at the Crossing, where Kitty McCrae<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave a party to Mick&rsquo;s brother Dan.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biddy  came in her bows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid a  twist in her nose<br>
  Like a dint in an ould billy-can,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  she did.<br>
  And she said, as she showed them her new Sunday hat,<br>
  &ldquo;Faith! There isn&rsquo;t one like it on Billygoat Flat!&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300841h-images/page049.jpg" alt="page049" width="537" height="750"></h3>
<p>She remarked to me wife, as she wished her good-day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid the air of an aristocrat,<br>
  &ldquo;Sure, I must, now Molony&rsquo;s been made a P.J.,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the fashion on Billygoat Flat,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But me  Missus replied.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the  feathers she eyed,<br>
  &ldquo;Faith! I never liked feathers wid fat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  I didn&rsquo;t.<br>
  Sure, I thought you&rsquo;d imported that fright of a hat,<br>
  Just to scare all the crows out of Billygoat Flat.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then says Mrs.  Molony, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have you to know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis your betters you&rsquo;re speakin&rsquo; to now;<br>
  Though me hat mightn&rsquo;t have much effect on a crow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, it seems to have frightened a cow!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if  that cap should fit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are  welcome to it.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Och!&rdquo; says Pat, &ldquo;she is wantin&rsquo; a row,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  she is!<br>
  &rsquo;Tis blue-mouldy she is, when she looks at your Hat,<br>
  Which is knockin&rsquo; the shine out of Billygoat Flat.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it aisy! &ldquo;  says I to Molony. &ldquo;Go slow!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you&rsquo;ve got to say, say it to me;<br>
  If you shneer at me Missus. I&rsquo;d have you to know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get floored, if you <i>are</i> a J.P.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis a  pumpkin,&rdquo; I said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Has  got into your head,<br>
  And it&rsquo;s swelled till it&rsquo;s bigger than three,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  it is!<br>
  You may be a J.P., but by this and by that,<br>
  You don&rsquo;t own the fee-simple of Billygoat Flat.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Tare and ages!&rdquo;  says I, &ldquo;may the divil set sail<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wid your wife and her fool of a hat!&rdquo;<br>
  And I ran to the fence, and I pulled out a rail,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And advanced like a windmill on Pat.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You be  careful,&rdquo; says he,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What  you&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; to me;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the crime of high treason you&rsquo;re at,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  it is.<br>
  I could fine you six months and a fiver for that,<br>
  If you strike the chief justice of Billygoat Flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis  a poor, chicken-hearted chief justice,&rdquo; says I,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s afraid to stand up to a man.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;If you say I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; says Molony, &ldquo;you lie!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I&rsquo;ll smash you as flat as a pan.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faith!  I&rsquo;ll make you eat dirt!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he  pulled off his shirt,<br>
  And he tossed it to Mick&rsquo;s brother Dan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  he did.<br>
  &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll shake you,&rdquo; says be, &ldquo;like a dog would a rat.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I scatter your giblets on Billygoat Flat!&rdquo;<br>
  Then, Molony and I, we got hopelessly mixed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we had a most illigant fight;<br>
  Till somehow me left thumb in his mouth it got fixed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I gouged at his eye wid me right.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I  chewed at his ear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till I  got me thumb clear,<br>
  And he roared that I murdered him quite<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  he did.<br>
  Then a kick in the chest spread him out like a mat,<br>
  And that ended the battle of Billygoat Flat. </p>
<p>I was taken away on  some bags in a dray.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Molony went home on a gate;<br>
  And Molony to-day, when he speaks of that fray,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uses language I wouldn&rsquo;t repate.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is  still a J.P.,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you  take it from me,<br>
  He&rsquo;s a poor, broken-up potentate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  he is.<br>
  He has sat upon Biddy, and jumped on her hat,<br>
  But he&rsquo;s not the Mikado of Billygoat Flat!</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheCurateAndTheMaid"></a>The Curate And The Maid</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>Whene&rsquo;er a tale of  love is told,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever else there be in it,<br>
  It must, to please the young or old,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have both a he and she in it.<br>
  And so the tale I tell to you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tale of calm felicity,<br>
  Tells of a man and maiden who<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once met in sweet simplicity. </p>
<p>He was a curate,  young but grave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pink of prime propriety;<br>
  She was a sweet young thing who gave<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her days to deeds of piety.<br>
  So when we built that church of ours<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curate consecrated it;<br>
  At Christmas time, with ferns and flowers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maiden decorated it. </p>
<p>The curate&rsquo;s coat  of sable black<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had neither flaw nor fleck on it,<br>
  Her dress was white, and front or back,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a spot or speck on it.<br>
  The curate&rsquo;s face was pale and white,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As white as arum lilies are.<br>
  Her cheeks were pink, her eyes were bright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lips as red as chillies are. </p>
<p>It  was the eve of Christmas Day;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maid was bunching roses up.<br>
  The curate came and said: &ldquo;Pray, may<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I help you hang these posies up?<br>
  That ladder should be held, you know&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make bold to proffer to?&rdquo;<br>
  The maiden smiled and murmured: &ldquo;Oh!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How kind of you to offer to! </p>
<p>She wove long  garlands on the ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So deftly and so readily;<br>
  Then, while she hung the garlands round,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held the ladder steadily.<br>
  And when, at length, their work complete,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sat in pensive attitude,<br>
  The curate said &rsquo;twas very sweet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While she expressed her gratitude.</p>
<p>They closed the  church, and down the road<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked with looks of piety;<br>
  Then parted at the maid&rsquo;s abode&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two models of propriety.<br>
  But, on the curate&rsquo;s coat, just where<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A maiden&rsquo;s cheek could rest on it,<br>
  There was a patch, as though just there<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flour bag had been pressed on it. </p>
<p>His cheek was  white, picked out with red,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two bright, rosy tips on it;<br>
  And some folks recognised, they said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The print of two red lips on it.<br>
  Curates, a warning take from this :<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot all be sainted ones;<br>
  But, if you choose red lips to kiss,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid, at least, the painted ones. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TimDooley"></a>Tim Dooley</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>Tim Dooley lives  down near the end of the town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his wife, and a horse, and a dray;<br>
  He&rsquo;ll fetch you a cartload of wood for a crown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or he&rsquo;ll go out to work by the day.<br>
  As a rule, Tim is one of the mildest of men,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he drinks nothing stronger than tea,<br>
  But now and again something happens, and then,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tim Dooley breaks out on the spree.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then  you hear the folks say:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Quick!  get out of the way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Tim Dooley is out on the spree.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then we hear a loud  yell, that we all know full well,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis a sound like a wild dingo&rsquo;s bray;<br>
  And the deafest old man in the township can tell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Dooley in search of his prey;<br>
  All business stops, for the folks close their shops,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women snatch up their children and flee,<br>
  And the Methodist parson with fear almost drops,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Tim Dooley gets out on the spree.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our  policeman turns pale,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  stops inside the gaol,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he knows Dooley&rsquo;s out on the spree. </p>
<p>Now, the dread of a  fray would not cause this dismay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or give rise to such panic and fear,<br>
  But who can his courage or valour display,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he feels his last moment is near;<br>
  When Dooley gets tight he is mighty polite,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wants to kiss everyone he may see,<br>
  And a whiff from his breath causes sure, sudden death,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Tim Dooley is out on the spree;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  we hide, or we fly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  the rumour goes by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Dooley is out on the spree. </p>

  I saw thy face, so wondrous sweet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched a smile those red lips sever,<br>
  Then, Love, thy conquest was complete,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I became thy slave for ever.<br>
  Thou wert a star, Love, dazzling and bright,<br>
  I, a mere mortal, dazed by thy light. </p>
<p>To speak my  thoughts I did not dare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou seemed to reign so far above me,<br>
  How could I dream that one so fair<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could favour me, or stoop to love me?<br>
  Forgive me, Love, I did not know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depth of thy sweet, tender feeling,<br>
  Until I saw the red rose glow<br>

  Thou wert mine own, Love, mine to adore.</p>

<p>Apollo Byron Dimity<br>
  Deplored the cruel destiny<br>
  Which decreed that he should be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condemned to measure laces.<br>
  To sell soft goods of every hue&mdash;<br>
  Of pink and yellow, green and blue&mdash;<br>
  When in his soul he longed to woo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muses and the Graces. </p>
<p>But, every hour  when trade was slack,<br>
  To Olympian heights his soul flew back,<br>
  Stretching its wings along the track<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads from Earth to  Heaven.<br>
  Yet, as his soul flew heavenwards<br>
  To seek the muses and the bards,<br>
  Some wretch would want &ldquo;<i>A dozen yards</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Of silk, at one-and-seven</i>&rdquo; </p>
<p>Yet, still Apollo&rsquo;s  soul would be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declaiming with Calliope,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or frowning with Melpomene<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In ancient Macedonia;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating on foam-tipped waves with Venus,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleeing in dread from Polyphemus,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roaming with Romulus and Remus<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  primitive Latonia. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for  Tully&rsquo;s voice<br>
  Or Virgil&rsquo;s lay (the first for choice)<br>
  To make my panting soul rejoice<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With classic story thrilling.<br>
  To roam with Gray near shady pool,<br>
  Where willows cast their shadows cool&mdash;<br>
  <i>&ldquo;Yes, Miss. It&rsquo;s guaranteed all wool.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  remnant is a shilling.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis pure as was the Golden Fleece<br>
  That Jason bore to ancient Greece.<br>
  I&rsquo;ve trimmings, too, to match the piece,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all  the late devices.<br>
  I&rsquo;ve fabrics from Athena&rsquo;s loom,<br>
  Like those which wrought Arachne&rsquo;s doom,<br>
  They must be sold, to make more room,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At  lowest bedrock prices.</i></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;See here are ribbons, flowers and lace<br>
  That Juno&rsquo;s stately form would grace;<br>
  The flowers that crowned Ophelia&rsquo;s face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were, not more chaste and fine,  Miss,<br>
  The latest style, of velveteen,<br>
  In heliotrope and mauve and green,<br>
  A raiment fit for Egypt&rsquo;s Queen;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marked down to one-and-nine, Miss.&rsquo;&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>The lady&rsquo;s face was  fair to view,<br>
  Her cheeks were pink, her eyes were blue,<br>
  Her hair was of a golden hue;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her smile was sweet and tender.<br>
  Apollo Byron Dimity<br>
  Had nothing seen so fair as she;<br>
  He tried, to find a simile<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one so young and slender. </p>
<p>He thought of, &ldquo;Brides  of Ancient Song,&rdquo;<br>
  Of how, &ldquo;the throstle whistled strong,&rdquo;<br>
  And how, &lsquo;&lsquo;the sparhawk wheeled along,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Guinevere was riding.<br>
  He marked her rosy blushes rise.<br>
  When with a glance of sweet surprise.<br>
  She praised his hooks, and then&mdash;his eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In manner quite confiding. </p>
<p>He tried to please  that maiden fair<br>
  With ribbons, silks and laces rare,<br>
  With dainty frills and underwear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many things not stated.<br>
  &ldquo;<i>Behold! Sweet maid,</i>&rdquo; said Dimity,<br>
  &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll sell thee silks of Araby,<br>
    And cut them down to one-and-three!</i>&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet still she hesitated. </p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas sweetly good  of you,&rdquo; said she,<br>
  To take all these things down for me.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d gladly do much more,&rdquo; said he,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;To win that smile of pleasure.<br>
  I knew, I knew, it could not last.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas bright, &rsquo;twas heavenly, but &rsquo;tis past!<br>
  <i>&ldquo;The colour in these prints is fast,<br>
</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>And all are extra measure&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can change  this note,&rdquo; said she,<br>
  &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take some&mdash;Dimity.<br>
  Three yards at five, is one-and-three.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A five pound note she  tendered),<br>
  He counts the change. Four&mdash;eighteen&mdash;nine,<br>
  Their fingers meet. Her bright eyes shine.<br>
  &ldquo;Ah! me,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;what hopes were mine!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, the vision&rsquo;s ended.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Into her hand the  change he pressed,<br>
  Her taper fingers he caressed,<br>
  He rolled his eyes. Then smote his chest.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye Gods! What pangs I suffer!&rdquo;<br>
  She went. With grief his bosom swelled,<br>
  He kissed the note her hand had held;<br>
  Then, rushing from the shop&mdash;he yelled:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Stop thief!!! The note&rsquo;s a duffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDerelict"></a>The Derelict</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>He had a manner  polished and persuading,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His perfect speech proclaimed him gently bred;<br>
  He begged to be forgiven for invading<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My privacy. He would be brief, he said.<br>
  His business could be quickly told, though pressing;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew my time was valuable; so<br>
  He would proceed at once, without digressing.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pour into my ear his tale of woe. </p>
<p>He had a father  once (the soft voice faltered),<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise a mother (here his eye grew dim);<br>
  He was their only son. How times had altered!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loved his parents once, and they  loved him.<br>
  He had been wild, and he would not deny it;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, repentant, he one boon would crave.<br>
  He wanted just enough&mdash;would I supply it?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take him back to see his mother&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>If  not the whole, a part? A Crown? A Shilling?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  save a sinner from perditions&rsquo;s brink?<br>
  If not a bob, why then would I be willing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  lend him just enough to get a drink?<br>
  He got it. In return, I got his blessing&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  pay me back within a week he swore&mdash;<br>
  I begged him to be off, as time was pressing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  off he went&mdash;to tell his tale next door.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBallotAtBumberoo"></a>The Ballot At Bumberoo</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>If you Listen, I  will truthfully a tale unfold to you,<br>
  How we engineered the ballot in the town of Bumberoo;<br>
  We are simple folk and honest when we deal in wool or wheat,<br>
  But in workin&rsquo; an election you will find us hard to beat. </p>
<p>There were Spicer,  Jackson, Briggs and Brown, all men of good repute,<br>
  Were retiring as directors from our local Institute;<br>
  There was lawyer Grey, and Judkins, Green and me, unanimous<br>
  That the time had come when these good men must stand aside for us. </p>
<p>Some folks argued  that, because they steered so ably in the past&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Cause they&rsquo;d brought us through the breakers till we floated safe at last&mdash;<br>
  They ought all to keep on steering&mdash;that &rsquo;twas only common-sense<br>
  That the men who&rsquo;d earned our gratitude should keep our confidence. </p>
<p>Now we didn&rsquo;t take  the trouble these same statements to refute,<br>
  For the only thing we wanted was to boss the Institute;<br>
  We didn&rsquo;t want their confidence, so didn&rsquo;t make a fuss;<br>
  But we meant to have their billets, which was good enough for us. </p>
<p>Every member had  one paper, to enable him to vote,<br>
  Which bore the Institution&rsquo;s seal, intended to denote<br>
  That the paper was quite genuine; and then, from two till four,<br>
  They dropped their papers in a box that stood inside the door. </p>
<p>There were  ninety-seven members, each entitled to a vote,<br>
  So at two we met, just opposite, where Judkins runs the tote;<br>
  And, to count the members goin&rsquo; in, we each took turns to peep.<br>
  And we checked them with a tally like they use to count the sheep. </p>
<p>The poll would  close at four o&rsquo;clock; at ten to four we knew<br>
  There were forty votes recorded, and allowin&rsquo; for &nbsp;a few<br>
  That might come in in the interim, we felt we needn&rsquo;t wait;<br>
  So we sailed across, and voted for our little syndicate. </p>
<p>When  the ballot-box was opened, the surprise was most intense,<br>
  But <i>we</i> had the votes, and didn&rsquo;t care  who had the confidence.<br>
  And, among the men of Bumberoo, the story still is told<br>
  How, from ninety-seven members, there were ninety-six that polled. </p>
<p>You ask me where we  got the papers? That I&rsquo;ll never tell:<br>
  You must ask the printer&rsquo;s devil, Judkins&rsquo; nephew, Jimmy Bell;<br>
  And the seal? Well, it was Judkins once remarked to me, I think,<br>
  That he used it while the secretary went to have a drink. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t really  matter. It&rsquo;s a fact beyond dispute,<br>
  That we bumped the old directors, and we run the Institute;<br>
  And we still are fairly honest, when we deal in wool or wheat,<br>
  But in stuffin&rsquo; ballot boxes we are pretty hard to beat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How I miss you, Paddy  Flynn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your broad contagious grin,<br>
  With your cheery voice and honest, vyce-like hand!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can picture you to-day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you were, when far away,<br>
  We made merry round the camp-fire on the Bland,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paddy  Flynn!<br>
  When we drove big mobs of cattle overland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see you, Paddy  Flynn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you rushed the stragglers in,<br>
  Riding recklessly, untamable and wild.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can feel your soft touch now,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it soothed my aching brow,<br>
  When you charmed away my fever as you smiled,<br>

  As the crooning of a mother soothes her child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  were happy, Paddy Flynn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through  the toil and dust and din,<br>
  We were merry &rsquo;neath the sun&rsquo;s relentless glare;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  were free and young and gay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  we chased dull dreams away,<br>
  We had not a hope or thought we didn&rsquo;t share,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paddy  Flynn!<br>
  And we had no time for sorrow, grief or care. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  were comrades, Paddy Flynn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till  we met that nymph of sin,<br>
  With the full, red, painted lips and jet-black eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who  so charmed us with her wiles,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With  her witchery and smiles,<br>
  That she made the evil passions in us rise,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paddy  Flynn!<br>
  And she roused the jealous hate that seldom dies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How  she mocked us, Paddy Flynn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying,  &ldquo;Those who love should win,&rdquo;<br>
  Till she fanned our smouldering passion to a flame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till  we grappled&mdash;you and I&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each  resolved to win or die&mdash;<br>
  And we fought like savage beasts that nought could tame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paddy  Flynn!<br>
  Till the rough crowd intervened for very shame. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All!  she fooled us, Paddy Flynn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While  we fought, she stayed within&mdash;<br>
  She was packing up her trousseau for her flight&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  were just a pair of fools,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For  she made us both her tools,<br>
  And, while all the crowd turned out to see the fight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paddy  Flynn!<br>
  She was packing. And she fled, with Jim, that night. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  I miss you, Paddy Flynn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With  your kind, good-temper&rsquo;d grin,<br>
  For I want you, when I feel depressed and sad;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  I feel inclined to swear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  I think what fools we were<br>
  When we let that black-eyed vixen drive us mad,<br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="FootballAtGulligalore"></a>Football  At Gulligalore</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little green flat near the river Paroo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the wallabies feed, and the bandicoots play,<br>
  Where the cries of the magpie and white cockatoo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greet the echoing hills at the advent of day.<br>
  The kangaroo seeks it to browse and to rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleek &rsquo;possum explores its deep shadows at night,<br>
  And &rsquo;twas there, in that valley so peaceful and blest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we played the great game, and we fought the great  fight.</p>
<p>We were shearing for Lindsay, who owns Killiemore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Macpherson, our boss, when returning from town,<br>
  Met Dutch Peter, the super from Gulligalore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  they both lit their pipes and then sat themselves down.<br>
  They conversed about horses, and cattle and sheep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About  women and whisky, the drought and Queen Ann,<br>
  But, as both had been drinking&mdash;not wisely, but deep&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  they talked about football the trouble began. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I could find.&rdquo;  said Macpherson. &ldquo;braw men that could play<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ony  team in Australy, frae roun&rsquo; Killimore&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;I vas pick,&rdquo; said Dutch Peter, &ldquo;vourdeen deams a day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vhat  could roon dem round rings, out at Gulligalore.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Hech! ye gowk! Ye are daft,&rdquo; cried Macpherson with scorn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wow!  the proof o&rsquo; the puddin&rsquo;s the preein&rsquo;, ye ken,<br>
  Pick ye&rsquo;re bleth&rsquo;rin team oot, and, as sure&rsquo;s they are born,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;ll  gang chitter&rsquo;in hame mair like bogles then men!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then the blood of  the warlike Macpherson ran hot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While  Dutch Peter in vain tried to frame words to speak;<br>
  But a bargain was made that on that very spot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They  would meet with their forces on Saturday week.<br>
  When the summons went forth to assemble the clan.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All  Macpherson&rsquo;s bold Scotchmen proved true to the core;<br>
  For, while Killiemore&rsquo;s shearers were Scotch to a man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They  were Irish and Dutch down at Gulligalore. </p>
<p>Every man that was  present remembers that day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  he rode down the hill singing &ldquo;Young Lochinvar,&rdquo;<br>
  While our foes, as they eagerly stripped for the fray,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sang  &ldquo;The Watch on the Rhine,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sweet Erin-go-bragh.&rdquo;<br>
  How our cheers shook the hills, as we met on the ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  we faced the O&rsquo;Gradys, Von Stuntze, and O&rsquo;Shea!<br>
  How the braw Scotchmen smiled, as the whisper went round.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  the name of the umpire was Donald McRae! </p>
<p>In the place of a whistle,  bold Donald McRae<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had  an old bullock bell, which he used in its stead;<br>
  There&rsquo;s a kick off! a run! and then Michael O&rsquo;Shea<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has  to go off the field, while they stitch up his head.<br>
  There&rsquo;s a rush and a tackle, a squabble, a scrum,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then  the ball is kicked out, and the players divide;<br>
  Old Macpherson throws in: like a whirlwind they come,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Regan  has it! He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; But the bell rings &ldquo;Off side!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come ye back.&rdquo;  said McRae, &rsquo;twas the last word he spoke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For  the crowd gathered round him; I saw Donald fall,<br>
  Then a knock made me dizzy, and when I awoke<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They  were kicking poor Donald in place of the ball!<br>
  &ldquo;Let me yoomp on his shest,&rdquo; said Dutch Peter, &ldquo;Py shinks!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  vos make him soon tink his pehind vas pefore!&rdquo;<br>
  And then Peter saw stars, and said: &ldquo;Tonner! I tinks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  vas blayed out mit footballs fer neffer-some more!&rdquo; </p>
<p>We laid Donald to  rest by the bank of the creek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While  Dutch Peter crawled down to a big water-hole;<br>
  But, while we weren&rsquo;t looking, O&rsquo;Grady, the sneak,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ran  away with the ball, and they scored the first goal.<br>
  &ldquo;Be the Powers,&rdquo; cried O&rsquo;Toole, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re the bhoys that can play;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis  the sons of ould Ireland can handle the ball;<br>
  Faith! we&rsquo;ll make all the Scotchmen remimber the day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  they tackled a player from bould Donegal.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Hog-shouther  him, Jock,&rdquo; cried McLeish to McGee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Von  Stuntze is ram-feezled, O&rsquo;Toole is the same,<br>
  Dinna fash wi&rsquo; O&rsquo;Grady, just lea him to me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll  turn him tapsalteerie and jimp on his wame.&rdquo;<br>
  So we knocked out O&rsquo;Grady, Von Stuntze and O&rsquo;Toole,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  they settled the hash of McCabe and McGee;<br>
  When we sat down at half-time to rest and get cool<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  had four sound men left, but they only had three. </p>
<p>Murder gleamed from  the eye of Macpherson, the grim,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis  a foight to a finish!&rdquo; cried Dinny Molloy,<br>
  &ldquo;Sure the eyes of ould Ireland are watchin&rsquo; us, Tim,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time  is up! Put your heads down and at him, me bhoy!&rdquo;<br>
  Grim Macpherson was stout, Tim O&rsquo;Leary was big,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  Tim butted at Mac, with a rush and a yell;<br>
  So Macpherson went down with a grunt like a pig,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  fell heels over head&mdash;and he stayed where he fell. </p>
<p>Then  McLeish knocked the wind out of Dinny Molloy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  big Tim broke the ankle of Duncan McNair,<br>
  But then Tim, in his turn, got laid out by McCoy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  McCoy got his nose broke by Paddy O&rsquo;Hare.<br>
  So McLeish was the only sound man of us all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  he threw Pat O&rsquo;Hare, and danced reels on his head;<br>
  And proud Gordon McLeish stood alone with the ball,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While  around on the field lay the wounded and dead.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300841h-images/page102.jpg" alt="page102" width="512" height="750"> </h3>
<p>&ldquo;Hech! &rsquo;tis grand!&rdquo;  said McRae, from his bed near the creek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ye  have ten meenits left. Mak&rsquo; the maist of them, mon,<br>
  I can umpire ye yet, though I&rsquo;m drouthy and weak,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kick  awa, mon! And kick a&rsquo; the goals that ye can!<br>
  While McLeish kept on kicking, McRae kept the score,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  he cried: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a record, mon, sure&rsquo;s ye&rsquo;re alive;<br>
  I&rsquo;m a sma&rsquo; wee bit slow, ye have time for yin mair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooth!  Ye&rsquo;ve won, and the score stan&rsquo;s at saxty to five!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Dutch Peter, the super, when telling the tale,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And describing the game to Von Kopsen, his friend,<br>
  Said: &ldquo;Mine sheeks vas got giddy, mine prain he turn pale,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All mine hair vas run cold, and mine plood shtand on  end!&rdquo;<br>
  Thus McLeish became famous along the Paroo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we had a Scotch nicht when we reached Killiemore;<br>
  But from that day to this there&rsquo;s a hullabaloo<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a man mentions football at Gulligalore.</p>

<p>He was journeying  from Gundagai, a simple artless man;<br>
  He was coming down to Sydney on the train;<br>
  His beard was full of grass seeds, and his face was like the tan,<br>
  And he told us that the country wanted rain.<br>
  He propounded simple questions with a child-like innocence,<br>
  And accepted all our answers with a smile;<br>
  So we envied him his honesty and perfect confidence,<br>
  Pure and simple, and without a trace of guile. </p>
<p>We were near our  destination when the ticket porter came,<br>
  Shouting, &ldquo;Tickets!&rdquo; but our venerable friend<br>
  Was so busy looking round him that you really couldn&rsquo;t blame<br>
  Him, because he didn&rsquo;t readily attend.<br>
  But at length the situation seemed to dawn upon his mind.<br>
  He began to search his pockets with a grin;<br>
  &lsquo;I know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I had one, but it&rsquo;s jolly hard to find<br>
  Just the very spot I put the beggar in. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I had it in the  pocket of my weskit or my coat,<br>
  Or it might ha&rsquo; bin my trousers! Let me see;<br>
  I ought t&rsquo; a&rsquo; had it ready. But a ride in train or boat<br>
  Is a very new experience to me.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it in  your mouth,&rdquo; said I. He murmured, &ldquo;So I have,<br>
  I&rsquo;m so sorry that I made the porter wait;&rdquo;<br>
  But he whispered when we parted as a little wink he gave,<br>
  &rsquo;Twas an old &rsquo;un, I was suckin&rsquo; off the date!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said: &ldquo;Sandy Macready,  you&rsquo;re looking quite seedy,<br>

<p>Full many a woman  has found to her cost,<br>
  That to hesitate means that she&rsquo;s sure to get lost,<br>
  But the proverb cuts both ways, and maidens will find,<br>
  If they travel too fast they&rsquo;ll be still left behind.<br>
  There are plenty of maids who are pining to-day,<br>
  And deploring the fact that the men ran away,<br>
  For they&rsquo;ve found that a maiden who chases a man,<br>
  Will get left, like Maria Matilda M&rsquo;Gann. </p>
<p>She was lively and  witty and sweet seventeen,<br>
  When she started by ogling Theophilus Green;<br>
  She waylaid him and watched for him day after day,<br>
  Till he packed his portmanteau and faded away.<br>
  Then she smiled at a squatter, a shearer, a cook,<br>
  And made eyes at a man who was writing a book,<br>
  At an auctioneer&rsquo;s clerk&mdash;at a tram guard&mdash;but none<br>
  Had she managed to catch when she reached twenty-one. </p>
<p>To assemblies, and  parties, and races she ran,<br>
  In a frantic endeavour to catch a young man;<br>
  And she fretted and fumed, and was ready to cry,<br>
  When she found the young men so remarkably shy.<br>
  So she reached twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty- four,<br>
  And a suitor seemed farther away than before;<br>
  When she saw her cheeks fade she was ready to faint,<br>
  But she plucked up her courage, and started to paint. </p>
<p>So she rushed  through the world with a swish and a whirl,<br>
  And she loved to be called, &ldquo;Such a giddy young  girl,&rdquo;<br>
  Till she found a grey hair, then alas and alack!<br>
  She went out of her mind, and she never came back.<br>
  Pretty maidens, take warning, whatever you do<br>
  Don&rsquo;t run after the men&mdash;let them run after you;<br>
  For be sure that the maid who runs after a man<br>
  Will get left&mdash;like Maria Matilda M&rsquo;Gann. </p>

<p>He reached our camp  at dinner time and passed the time of day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he dumped his well-worn swag upon the ground;<br>
  He ate our beef and damper in a patronising way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drank our tea and smiled benignantly around.<br>
  He ran hs slender fingers through his patriarchal beard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which impressed our unsophisticated youth;<br>
  His voice was low and soothing, and his sole desire appeared<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say all he said with strict regard to truth.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  was not a bit uncouth;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So  we looked on him forsooth<br>
  As a pattern of benovolence and truth. </p>
<p>He told us tales of  Bendigo, of Forbes and Ballarat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his fights with Morgan, Gilbert, Hall, and Dunn;<br>
  Of how he drove the Chinkies from their claims at Lambing Flat;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the trophies and the prizes he had won.<br>
  His style was so convincing, his appearance so sublime,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his sentiments so honest and devout,<br>
  We swallowed all he told us and believed it at the time<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it seemed a sort of sacrilege to doubt.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When  he told us all about<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His  adventures coming out,<br>
  Even then we couldn&rsquo;t find the heart to doubt. </p>
<p>He said he knew a  lawyer who would not accept a fee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a parson with a disregard to pelf;<br>
  He vowed he knew a lady void of curiosity,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a man who loved his neighbour as himself;<br>
  That he knew a politician who was honest and devout,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a funny man who thought himself absurd,<br>
  But I put my thumb unto my nose and spread my fingers out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I told him I was forced to doubt his word.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  was sorry, I averred,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If  his anger I incurred;<br>
  But I really must decline to take his word. </p>
<p>But when he said he  saw a wombat walking on the sea,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a kookaburra flying round the moon:<br>
  Described the geebungs growing on a paddymelon tree,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a bunyip playing jigs on a bassoon;<br>
  Spoke gravely of a wallaby that made a barbed-wire fence,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a platypus who danced upon the wire,<br>
  I thought he was an idiot devoid of common sense,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or an absolute, unmitigated liar.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  had not the least desire<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  offend, or rouse his ire,<br>
  But I hinted that I thought he was a liar. </p>
<p>He said he had a  maiden aunt who owned to forty-nine.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew a boy who wasn&rsquo;t wiser than his dad,<br>
  Knew a man who made a fortune in the literary line,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a comic bard who wasn&rsquo;t always sad;<br>
  Then I felt it time to stop him, and with frenzy in my eye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hit him just about the belt, or slightly higher;<br>
  And I said, as down he tumbled. &ldquo;Do you now admit you lie?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I called him every sample of a liar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then  I built his funeral pyre,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  I hurled him on the fire;<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m a farmer. Where  my farm is, well, I don&rsquo;t intend to say;<br>
  It&rsquo;s enough for you to know that it&rsquo;s up Tumberumba way.<br>
  I don&rsquo;t often take a holiday, and, even when I do,<br>
  It&rsquo;s not one time in twenty I get on the jamberoo. </p>
<p>But the crops were  doing splendidly, the wool was all sent down;<br>
  So at Christmas time the missus thought we&rsquo;d have a run to town.<br>
  She remarked: &ldquo;Without we see some life, we might as well be dead.&rdquo;<br>
  And, as is my usual custom, I agreed with what she said. </p>
<p>We arrived in the  big city, after travelling all night,<br>
  And the crowds that came to meet us was  a gratifying sight.<br>
  But the shovin&rsquo; and the rushin&rsquo;, and the shoutin&rsquo; and the roar.<br>
  Raised a sort of feelin&rsquo; in me that I&rsquo;d never felt before. </p>
<p>When the porter  stowed us in a cab, the cabby said: &lsquo;&lsquo;Where to?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;just drive us where it&rsquo;s most convenient to you.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says Jessie, &ldquo;Drive us somewhere where they&rsquo;ll let us go to bed.&rdquo;<br>
  And I felt so awful sleepy, I agreed with what she said. </p>
<p>So he drove us to a  big hotel&mdash;one of those grand affairs,<br>
  Where they&rsquo;ve chambermaids to wait on you, and carpet on the stairs,<br>
  Where the bedrooms were so similar. I used to sleep in dread,<br>
  That I&rsquo;d wake up in the morning in some other person&rsquo;s bed.</p>
<p>Well, the sights we  saw that Christmas time, are more than I can tell,<br>
  They made even Jessie say that she was doin&rsquo; fairly well; <br>
  For she liked the shops, she liked the trams, the gardens, and the parks,<br>
  And, when Jessie praised the tucker, I agreed with her remarks. </p>
<p>But she soon got  tired and footsore. After that I had to roam,<br>
  And to put my time in anyhow, while Jessie stayed at home;<br>
  It was then I met Dick Donovan, who comes from Burradoo,<br>
  And he said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go and see the town, and have a jamberoo,&rdquo; </p>
<p>Every thing that  followed after that seems strange and dim to me,<br>
  There&rsquo;s a lot of things all jumbled up within my memory;<br>
  There are ballet girls and barmaids, and remarks that don&rsquo;t seem plain,<br>
  Such as &ldquo;Cumanavadrinkmebo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fillemupagain.&rdquo; </p>
<p>When I try to call  to mind the folks I met, and their remarks,<br>
  It is just a jumbled memory of policemen, pubs, and parks;<br>
  But next day, before a magistrate it was explained to me,<br>
  That they found me yelling out &ldquo;Police!&rdquo; and clinging to a tree. </p>
<p>And my purse was  gone, my watch was gone, my hat was gone as well,<br>
  Where they went to you must ask the wind&mdash;it&rsquo;s more than I can tell;<br>
  I had lost my railway ticket, and my reputation too;<br>
  They had all vamoosed, and vanished in one little jamberoo. </p>
<p>Jessie said next  day&mdash;and with her I could not well disagree&mdash;<br>
  That the city was a place that was a bit too warm for me;<br>
  And she said: &ldquo;The only way to keep you safe, and free from harm,<br>
  Is to pack you up, and take you back, and dump you on the farm.&rdquo; </p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a  pretty article, to get in such disgrace,<br>
  Why, you look as if a swarm of bees had settled on your face;<br>
  You must feel as if volcanoes were eruptin&rsquo; in your head.&rdquo;<br>
  And, as is my usual custom, I agreed with what she said. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a rosebud is fairer or sweeter;<br>
  From her golden-crowned head to the tips of her toes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never a maid that was neater.<br>
  And our friendship is candid, and open and free,<br>
  For there is not a secret &rsquo;twixt Polly and me.</p>
<p>We are chums. That is all. Just a man and a maid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who resolve to be happy and jolly;<br>
  And I care not a jot what is whispered or said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  shall still keep on loving sweet Polly.<br>
  When I stroke her bright hair, as she sits on my knee,<br>
  I rejoice at the love betwixt Polly and me. </p>
<p>So the gossips may  wonder and talk as they please,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They  may chuckle with laughter sardonic;<br>
  Though she asks me to kiss her, and shows me her knees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet  I swear that our love is Platonic.<br>
  There is not the least harm betwixt Polly and me,<br>
  For, alas! I am sixty, while Polly is three.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="WinifredBrown"></a>Winifred Brown</b></h2>
<p>I once was  light-hearted, good-tempered, and gay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a trouble or care to oppress me,<br>
  And I cantered through life in a rollicking way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking nought could disturb or distress me.<br>
  The world was a circus, and I was a clown,<br>
  Till fate introduced me to Winifred Brown. </p>
<p>In our journey  through life there are byways unseen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will lead us to good or to evil;<br>
  One will lead to the right, into pathways serene,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While another will lead to the Devil.<br>
  I had choice of two tracks when I rode into town;<br>
  I turned to the left&mdash;and met Winifred Brown. </p>
<p>She was close to  the sliprail that led to the farm<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first saw her merry eyes glancing.<br>
  And my soul became captive at once to the charm<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her beauty, so sweet and entrancing.<br>
  The flag of my freedom at once fluttered down;<br>
  My heart was surrendered to Winifred Brown. </p>
<p>Oh! Those halcyon  days! Like a poet&rsquo;s sweet dream&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeter far than was ever invented.<br>
  Then I told her my love; and my joy was supreme<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she bashfully blushed, and consented.<br>
  I was prouder of her than a king of his crown,<br>
  For the world was my own, with sweet Winifred Brown. </p>
<p>All the guests were  assembled. The parson was there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To unite us for worse or for better;<br>
  When I got a surprise, for a girl with red hair<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came and curtseyed, and gave me a letter.<br>
  It was short, it said briefly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not coming down,<br>
  Will you kindly apologise? Winifred  Brown.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Then a postscript  said, &ldquo;Charley, I hope you won&rsquo;t mind,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, I&rsquo;ve met my old sweetheart, Pat Hogan.<br>
  We have made up our quarrel; he&rsquo;s awfully kind,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I&rsquo;m going with him to the Bogan.<br>
  We were married this morning, I hope you won&rsquo;t frown,<br>
  Yours, W. Hogan (<i>nee</i> Winifred Brown).&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Fire"></a>Fire!</b></h2>
<p>Oh! The sun shone bright, and our hearts  were light,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the scent from the wild, bush trees<br>
  Stole fresh and sweet, through the ripening wheat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it waved in the summer breeze.<br>
  O&rsquo;er the golden grain, came the sweet refrain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the bell-bird&rsquo;s evening call;<br>
  There was glad surprise in my Nell&rsquo;s blue eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And God&rsquo;s blessing was over all. </p>
<p>I was young and  strong, and my task was long,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I&rsquo;d planted the golden grain;<br>
  With a flush of pride I had brought my bride<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her home on the western plain.<br>
  It was sweet to me, when she laughed with glee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dilated with glowing face<br>
  On the ground I&rsquo;d cleared, and the house I&rsquo;d reared<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our home and our dwelling place. </p>
<p>It was rude and rough,  but its slabs were tough.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was cosy and snug and warm;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas of rude design, but the plan was mine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &rsquo;twas built by my own strong arm.<br>
  So our hearts were light, as the sun was bright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the galloping years rolled by.<br>
  For our love was true as the skies were blue,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And contented were Nell and I. </p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas at dawn of  day that I rode away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my wife and our chubby child,<br>
  Saying &ldquo;God bless Nell,&rdquo; as I waved farewell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While she threw me a kiss and smiled.<br>
  As I gazed around at our well-tilled ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our sheep and our fattening kine,<br>
  At the cultured grace of the dear old place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the pride of success was mine. </p>
<p>So I cross the  bridge and the iron-stone ridge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I ride down the big red hill&mdash;<br>
  Till I note with dread, that some fire glow&rsquo;s red<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scrub near the ruined mill.<br>
  Then the red sparks fly, and the flames sweep by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they tear through the sun-dried grass,<br>
  As they leap the trees in the gathering breeze,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the scrub is a roaring mass. </p>
<p>Then I turn me  back&mdash;for the fiery track,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a demon let loose from Hell,<br>
  Flies from tree to tree, as with fiendish glee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is spreading for home and Nell.<br>
  So I urge my steed at breakneck speed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I spur, till his flanks run red,<br>
  But the mad flames rush through the hungry bush,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they gallop and roar ahead. </p>
<p>I gasp and I choke,  through the blinding smoke.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I smart with the scorching heat,<br>
  In my great dismay I both curse and pray,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the merciless flames entreat.<br>
  But I pass the bridge and the iron-stone ridge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I raced down the bridle track;<br>
  Then&mdash;I wish me dead&mdash;for my home glows red<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a desert of smouldering black.</p>
<p align="center">*  * * * * * * </p>
<p>Now I sit alone, while  the night winds moan.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I ponder on joys long fled,<br>
  For the curlew&rsquo;s cry is my lullaby,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I creep to my lonely bed.<br>
  If I chance to dream, once again I seem<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be riding that frightful ride;<br>
  And the smoke grows dense, as I leap the fence<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my hurry to save my bride.</p>
<p>Then I wake and  sigh&mdash;so the years drift by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lingering seasons roll;<br>
  Neither day nor night bringing brief respite<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the gloom that immures my soul.<br>
  I can only pray for that brighter day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my soul, from its cage set free,<br>
  Like a bird shall soar to join Nell&rsquo;s, once more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a joyous eternity.</p>

<p>I dreamt, one hot and scorching day,<br>
  That &rsquo;neath the Sphinx&rsquo;s shade I lay&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate was  depressing.<br>
  The hot sands made me stare and blink,<br>
  And I was dying for a drink&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thirst was quite  distressing.</p>
<p>A camel stood quite close to me;<br>
  He chewed his cud contentedly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on me he kept  gazing;<br>
  He seemed to know I craved a drink,<br>
  (I saw the ugly beggar wink)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His coolness was  amazing.</p>
<p>He shook his long ungainly head,<br>
  And then, in camel language said:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You poor unlucky  mortal.<br>
  I&rsquo;m better off than you,&rdquo; said he,<br>
  &ldquo;A drink a week&rsquo;s enough for me &rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he began to  chortle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avaunt!&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;ungainly beast!<br>
  You might respect my thirst at least.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why don&rsquo;t you drink  in season?<br>
  To thirst so long proves you a chump,<br>

<p>Away to the west,  on the black-soil plains,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the teamsters swear and the bullocks toil,<br>
  A driver of bullocks, named Michael Baines,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is leaving his tracks on the tough, black soil.<br>
  He cheerfully sings, though the pace be slow,<br>
  &ldquo;Each mile that we gain is one less to go.&rdquo; </p>
<p>When the waggon  gets bogged and the leader strains,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the trace-chains snap, and the wool-bales sway,<br>
  It may ruffle the temper of Michael Baines,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he takes a shovel and digs his way.<br>
  The bullocks breathe hard as the big load swings,<br>
  But they move again, and so Michael sings. </p>
<p>Thus doggedly,  cheerfully, day by day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over sun-parched plains or by swollen creeks,<br>
  Merrily Michael is forcing his way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still steadily on to the goal he seeks.<br>
  Each restful night sees some distance won;<br>
  A mile in a day is better than none. </p>
<p>The bullocks are  lazy, the tracks are rough,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Michael&rsquo;s long whip has a potent thong;<br>
  The damper is stale, and the corned beef tough,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Michael&rsquo;s white teeth are both sharp and strong.<br>
  He sticks to his task and enjoys his dole,<br>
  Each day he gets nearer his distant goal. </p>
<p>Through all his  misfortunes does Michael sing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though his trials are many, and life is hard;<br>
  But, at last, one day, with a lurch and a swing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His team will crawl into the station yard.<br>
  His task will be over, his goal be won;<br>
  A mile in a day is better than none. </p>
<p>How many a man in  the world to-day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is yielding to trouble, in fear and doubt;<br>
  Who frets and mopes by the side of his dray,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he ought to be trying to dig it out?<br>
  He who sits still and at Fortune complains<br>
  Might well take a lesson from Michael Baines. </p>

<p>John Tompkins was  such an unfortunate man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appeared as though Fate had selected him<br>
  To use as her toy, for his troubles began<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his birth&mdash;when his nurses neglected him. </p>
<p>The consequence was  he&rsquo;d a cast in his eye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his nose was a petty apology:<br>
  His knees knocked together, his feet were awry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his head was a freak in phrenology. </p>
<p>His bump of  morality lay almost flat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the vicious ones rose in immensity;<br>
  His forehead was small, but the back of his hat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was bulged out with his vicious propensity. </p>
<p>At school he was backward  in all that was right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in vice showed abnormal precocity;<br>
  His moral obliquity made him delight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exceptional deeds of atrocity. </p>
<p>It followed, of  course, when he reached man&rsquo;s estate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That his criminal turpitude clung to him;<br>
  His conscience was dumb&mdash;inexorable Fate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a siren of sinfulness, sung to him. </p>
<p>To rob and to  burgle he could not resist,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He neglected no fair opportunity;<br>
  And when he&rsquo;d committed each crime on the list,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He invented new crimes with impunity. </p>
<p>He would steal  anything that came near to his hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a purse to a paltry geranium;<br>
  Yet, it wasn&rsquo;t his fault, you will please understand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas the fault of the bumps on his cranium. </p>
<p>Poor fellow! He  happened, one dark winter&rsquo;s night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While exploring some business premises,<br>
  To be rather careless in showing a light,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And poor Tompkins got caught by his Nemesis. </p>
<p>They took him away  to a mansion of stone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And arranged for his long isolation,<br>
  Where he had the advantage, in peace and alone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of enjoying some cool contemplation. </p>
<p>A clean-shaven  curate then came on the scene.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who taught Science, combined with Theology;<br>
  The creed he believed in was somewhere between<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The High Church and electro-biology. </p>
<p>He practised on  Tompkins each day in his cell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And discovered the cause that perverted him;<br>
  He argued so long, and he laboured so well,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he turned Tompkins&rsquo; head and converted him. </p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300841h-images/page149.jpg" alt="page149" width="515" height="750"></h3>
<p>His bump of  iniquity now is quite flat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While his moral ones swell with intensity;<br>
  He&rsquo;s growing so good that the front of his hat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is too small for his moral propensity. </p>
<p>The curate now  points, with commendable pride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his pupil&rsquo;s religious refulgence;<br>
  While Tompkins, converted, is often supplied<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With full many a little indulgence. </p>
<p>Let this be the  moral, conclusive, though brief&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may savour of heterodoxy&mdash;but,<br>
  If you wish to convert an habitual thief,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must alter the shape of his occiput. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AStudentOfDivinity"></a>A Student Of Divinity</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>A student of  divinity, I lived in the vicinity<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one of our small towns which shall be nameless;<br>
  Spent my time in meditation, and in quiet contemplation<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the things that were most innocent and blameless.<br>
  From my boyhood I was noted for my learning; was devoted<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my books; was not a scapegrace, like my brother;<br>
  And, until I left for college, to enlarge my sphere of knowledge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had never kissed a woman but my mother,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if  I may, I&rsquo;d like to say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though  it may seem digressing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That,  if a woman looked my way.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  feeling was distressing. </p>
<p>I left my Mother, I  remember, in the middle of December,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she wished me to spend Christmas in the city;<br>
  She said, &ldquo;Go and hear the preaching, and take lessons from its teaching.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For to miss the chance just now would be a pity&rdquo;<br>
  So I packed my bag and started, leaving Mother broken hearted,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was filled with joyful aspirations,<br>
  Feeling that my great ambition was approaching its fruition,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I longed so much to feel some new sensations.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, by  the way, I&rsquo;d like to say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though  it may seem disjointed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sought  some new ones every day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. </p>
<p>Mother said it was  essential to select some residential<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suburb where the folk would honour and respect me;<br>
  And a porter at the station, when I asked for information,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he knew the home my Mother would select me.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas a suburb cool and shady, with a pleasant widow lady<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her daughter, who was natty, neat and witty,<br>
  And I felt my hot cheeks flushing, when the latter, sweetly blushing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindly volunteered to show me round the city.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let  me say&mdash;just by the way&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She  seemed so like a sister,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That,  when I&rsquo;d known her scarce a day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&mdash;very  nearly&mdash;kissed her. </p>
<p>I  spent my time quite gaily, getting new sensations daily,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking lessons from the widow&rsquo;s lovely daughter;<br>
  I indulged in dissipation, feeling quite a sweet sensation<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking cigarettes and drinking wine and water.<br>
  My lessons were so various that I grew quite hilarious,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned to play a charming game called &ldquo;Poker,&rdquo;<br>
  Then I learned to play at &ldquo;Snooker,&rdquo; and another game called &ldquo;Eucure,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where she always had a card they called the &ldquo;Joker.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let  me say, that day by day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My  knowledge grew extensive.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although  the games we used to play<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were  awfully expensive. </p>
<p>Christmas passed in  fun and jollity, in frolic and frivolity,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My lessons so successfully proceeded,<br>
  That we grew quite confidential, and she said, in things essential<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had grown so wise, I knew as much as she did<br>
  But, alas! in my security, I heeded not futurity,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was ignorant of life and its conventions;<br>
  So my confidence forsook me, when, one day her mother took me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By surprise, by asking, what, were my intentions?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  here I&rsquo;ll say, just by the way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though  it may not be needed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her  question took me quite astray;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  knew as much as she did. </p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300841h-images/page159.jpg" alt="page159" width="508" height="750"></h3>
<p>I was quite  confused and hazy, for my mind was dull and dazy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could scarcely see the table just before me;<br>
  So I stammered and I stuttered, but before a word I uttered<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Tomkinson supplied the answer for me.<br>
  She remarked, in accents freezing. &ldquo;I am sure it&rsquo;s very pleasing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you&rsquo;re quite prepared to do what&rsquo;s right and  proper,&rdquo;<br>
  Then, as if to quite confound me, she flung both her arms around me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kissed me twice before I&rsquo;d time to stop her.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, if  I may, I&rsquo;d like to say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though  I may be derided,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She  ultimately had her way&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  fact, she had decided. </p>
<p>So I sit, with  brain all reeling, nearly void of sense and feeling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying vainly my remorse and grief to smother;<br>
  I am weeping as I&rsquo;m writing, for a letter I&rsquo;m inditing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To impart the sad intelligence to Mother.<br>
  I can see her in my fancy, when she learns I&rsquo;ve married Nancy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I fortify myself with wine and water;<br>
  For, although it may seem curious, I feel that she&rsquo;ll be furious<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To know that I&rsquo;ve a wife and she a daughter.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, by  the way, I&rsquo;d chance to-day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her  being mad or furious,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A worse  thing fills me with dismay<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m  broke&mdash;and she&rsquo;s penurious. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheJealousKookaburra"></a>The Jealous Kookaburra</b><b> </b></h2>
<p>There was once a little maiden living on a  little farm,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near  the township of Maringarangaroo,<br>
  She possessed each grace and virtue, with the innocence and charm<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That  such little maidens generally do.<br>
  She had cheeks as red as poppies, she was gentle as a dove,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While  her glance was like the twinkle of a star;<br>
  She was just a little melancholy, being deep in love,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such little maidens generally  are.<br>
  So she used to sit and sigh, beneath a little wattle tree<br>
  Where a kookaburra sat and giggled, &ldquo;Ha-ha! He-he-he!&rdquo; </p>
<p>Every evening to  the wattle tree the little maiden sped,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where  she sat and looked as lonely as could be.<br>
  While the kookaburra chuckled, as he wagged his old, grey head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I  believe, by Jove! that maiden&rsquo;s after me.&rdquo;<br>
  So, one evening, as he watched her from his vantage point above,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  considered that the time had come to speak,<br>
  And he threw some goo-goo eyes at her, to show he was in love,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then  be voiced his pent-up feelings through his beak.<br>
  And he told her how he loved her&mdash;but the maiden never knew&mdash;<br>
  All she heard was, &lsquo;&lsquo;He-he-he-he! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Hoo-hoo-hoo!&rdquo; </p>
<p>The young maid  could not imagine what the kookaburra meant<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To  be laughing, when the whole wide world was sad;<br>
  But the kookaburra winked his eye, and shook with merriment,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For,  from his lookout, the world seemed very glad.<br>
  &ldquo;Go away, you laughing jackass,&rdquo; said the maiden with a sigh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It  is stupid to pretend that you are gay;<br>
  I could listen to a mopoke, or a curlew&rsquo;s plaintive cry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But  you shouldn&rsquo;t laugh&mdash;when Charlie is away.&rdquo;<br>
  And the maiden looked so doleful, and so very, very blue,<br>
  That the kookaburra cackled, &ldquo;He-he! Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo-hoo!!&rdquo; </p>
<p>The kookaburra  flapped his wings&mdash;he was a merry bird&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One  that evidently knew a thing or two;<br>
  In fact, what he had never seen, or felt, or known, or heard&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&mdash;it  wouldn&rsquo;t be much good to me or you.<br>
  You couldn&rsquo;t call him very old, as kookaburras go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He  was just a kookaburra in his prime,<br>
  Yet, he&rsquo;d knocked about Australia for a hundred years or so,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  he&rsquo;d seen some funny people in his time.<br>
  So he thought a lot, although he told his thoughts to very few.<br>
  And when he spoke his words were, &ldquo;He-he! Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo-hoo!!&rsquo;&rsquo; </p>
<p>And on countless  summer evenings, under many a wattle tree,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had seen such maidens sitting in the sun;<br>
  He knew all about the  old, old tale, so chuckled joyfully,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rubbed his claws, and watched the maid, and thought it  fun.<br>
  But, he saw the maid&rsquo;s eyes sparkle, as she heard a welcome sound,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas as sweet as fairy music to her ear.<br>
  For, &rsquo;twas the sound of horse&rsquo;s hoofs, and, as they beat the ground.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew each thud was bringing Charlie near.<br>
  Then the kookaburra tried to cackle. &ldquo;Cock-a-doodle-doo!&rdquo;<br>
  But he couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;he could only say: &ldquo;He-he! Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he saw the pretty maiden greet her lover with a kiss,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he smacked his own beak wildly in refrain;<br>
  But the maiden never heard him, for her heart was choked with bliss,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the universe was filled with joy again.<br>
  Charlie pressed her to his bosom, showering kisses on her brow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah! &rsquo;tis sweet!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to be alone with thee,&rdquo;<br>
  But the kookaburra nearly lost his balance on the bough,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he shook his claw and shouted, &ldquo;What of me?&rdquo;<br>
  Then as Charlie stroked her nut-brown hair, and praised her eyes of blue,<br>
  The kookaburra shouted, &ldquo;He-he! Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo-hoo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said Charlie, &ldquo;Oh!  my darling, you are all the world to me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there never was a girl so sweet, I know!&rdquo;<br>
  But the kookaburra muttered, an a scornful laugh laughed he,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah! I heard his father tell his mother so.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the dearest boy that ever lived,&rdquo; remarked the blushing maid,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the kookaburra&rsquo;s eyes grew moist and dim,<br>
  &ldquo;Why, I saw her grandma, underneath this very tree,&rdquo; he said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Meet her sweetheart, and she said the same to him.&rdquo;<br>
  (This, of course, is a translation, &rsquo;Twould have sounded unto you,<br>
  As if the kookaburra said, &ldquo;He-he! Ho-ha! Hoo-hoo!!&rdquo;) </p>
<p>Time after time,  when Charlie came, the kooka&shy;burra sat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he felt so sad he couldn&rsquo;t even squeak;<br>
  For the only satisfaction the poor kookaburra had<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was to tear his feathers out and gnash his beak.<br>
  But, when Charlie asked the little maid to name the happy day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she did, the kookaburra thought her bold,<br>
  So he sneered, and said, &ldquo;You hussy! but it&rsquo;s just the same old way.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For it&rsquo;s what your grandma did, in days of old.&rdquo;<br>
  As their solemn troth they plighted, vowing always to be true.<br>
  The kookaburra softly said. &ldquo;He-he! Ha-ha! Hoo-hoo!!&rdquo; </p>
<p>The sun was shining  brightly, and the world was fresh and gay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Charlie came in confidence and pride;<br>
  All the world was filled with laughter, for it was their wedding day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bridegroom had come out to claim his bride.<br>
  The poor mournful kookaburra sat alone upon his tree,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt gloomy us he watched his loved one go:<br>
  But the maiden saw him sitting there, and clapped her hands with glee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she threw some kisses at him, and she laughed so  merrily.<br>
  That the kookaburra had to laugh, especially when she<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said. &ldquo;You darling kookaburra! Won&rsquo;t you come along  with me?<br>
  For I love you, and am sure to miss you so.&rdquo;<br>
  So the kookaburra followed to Maringarangaroo,<br>
  Laughing, &ldquo;He-he-he-he! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!!!&rdquo; </p>
