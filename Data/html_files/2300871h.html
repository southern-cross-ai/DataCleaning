  The Dreamer of Southern Florida</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="2300871h-images/Chapter01.jpg" alt="Chapter01" width="650" height="300"></p>
<p>This is a story about a dreamer and his accomplishment, about a man  whose eyes made pictures when they were shut; a man who beheld a stately vision  and caused it to become a reality. At heart he was a writer, a poet, an artist,  but fate with curious perversity decreed that he should write in wood and steel  and stone and paint his pictures upon a canvas of spacious fields, cool groves  and smiling waterways. His dream was to build a City Beautiful, without blot or  blemish, without ugliness or dirt; a city of majestic size but of perfect  harmony. A city planned with reverence and with care and built after the old  Grecian ideal that nothing is so sacred as the beautiful: that was his vision.</p>
<p>It was a &ldquo;dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was,&rdquo; and he  must have dreamed it at the break of day, when imaginings of that sort come  true, for he was not a rich man and he had little except faith and a splendid  energy to draw against; nevertheless, his plan has taken shape, his city stands  revealed. It is.</p>
<p>In telling of this achievement I shall have to speak more often of the  man himself than he would like, for he is modest and too deeply absorbed in his  work to feel very much pride in anything except its success.</p>
<p>Florida, as you know, rests like a lance with its tip outthrust some  four hundred miles towards the Spanish Main. Its head, like that of any lance,  is tempered; it has a cutting edge of coral rock laid down by myriads of tiny  living things that have been at work for ages.</p>
<p>Down near the lower end of the state lived this boy who wanted to be a  poet; he took his living from the soil and as he worked he had his visions of  great accomplishments. It was a fertile, well-watered soil and the climate was  truly tropical; even the pines were not the sort that grow elsewhere in  Florida, they were the Caribbean variety. And Royal Palms grew wild. It was a  friendly land, with a promise richer than any other which his fancy could  picture, so naturally he longed to tell about it. He heard the whisper of  voices and he tried to set them down.</p>
<p>Perhaps they were real voices, voices of those tiny people who built  Florida up out of the sea, or murmurs from the coral caves. Why not ?</p>
<p>There <i>are</i> whispering voices  in Florida. I have heard them: so can you on any moonlit night when the wind is  at play among the palm leaves. It is a land of enchantment and things fanciful  happen there.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it pleases me to imagine that the voices of those patient  builders spoke to the boy and urged him to build, to create. Also, that when he  tried to create in words, they said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Build something more solid; make your poems live in stone. We have  raised a land for you: upon the walls of our houses rear houses for men. We  wrought in beauty, do you the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy listened and, as he grew older, his dream took shape. He built  his city.</p>
<p>George Edgar Merrick is the man; his city is set among pines and palms  and flaming poincianas and he calls it Coral Gables. It is, indeed, a city of  coral gables, and of soft-tinted coral walls and splendid coral gateways, too.  Even the streets are of ground coral&mdash;not the coral of which reefs and atolls  are made, but a porous lime formation which resembles it and goes by that name.  Upon the fields he used to till the stones have blossomed; those ragged,  stubborn rocks he used to curse, he has caused to bloom into an eternal flower.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>The story of this man, who longed to create fine poems and who created,  instead, a lovely city, is one of the most extraordinary tales that I have ever  listened to and as romantic as anything which I, a writer of stories, have ever  written. There is a flavor of Arabian magic to it, for Aladdin, with the aid of  his lamp, could not have built more swiftly.</p>
<p>Miami, the Wonder City, had begun her amazing growth. Among those who  believed implicitly in her greatness was, of course, George Merrick. He lived  only a few miles out and he had made a success of raising and shipping fruits  and other produce, but in this new project of city building he saw something  much more to his liking than agriculture. Instead of watching things grow, here  was the opportunity to build with his own hands, to raise something which would  not flower and fruit and then decay. Those voices were becoming plainer and he  could hear what they were saying.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>As builder and developer he made a quick success&mdash; everybody, these last  few years, with courage and faith in the future of Florida, succeeded. Miami  grew with the astonishing rapidity of some rank tropical plant, and with it  grew George Merrick&rsquo;s determination to build something even fairer and more  satisfying, to erect a city of his own designing which would reflect the  highest ideals in beauty, in comfort, and in convenience, and which would be  more harmonious in plan, more exquisite in detail than any other city in the  world.</p>
<p>He added to the land his father had owned until there were some sixteen  hundred acres and then he announced Coral Gables. A good many people called him  foolish; it was hard enough, they declared, to sell lots without prescribing  what sort of houses the purchasers should build upon them. Merrick insisted  upon one certain type of architecture throughout: what he called a modified &ldquo;Mediterranean&rdquo;  style. It was neither pure Spanish nor Italian, but a combination of what  seemed best in each, with an added touch of gaiety to suit the Florida mood.</p>
<p>Florida has a mood, you know. She is young, she is animated, she has  sparkle and &ldquo;go&rdquo;; there is a certain joyful abandon about her to which visitors  owe obeisance.</p>
<p>What was this that Merrick talked about? A City Beautiful? America&rsquo;s  Finest Suburb? A place where Castles in Spain are made real? Good advertising,  but nobody took that stuff seriously; he&rsquo;d better forget his Utopian ideas, get  his money out and let nature take her course. Towns aren&rsquo;t made, they grow.  Thus ran local comment.</p>
<p>Now, the course that nature takes in the ordinary suburban subdivision,  as you must realize, is often a very dreadful course and results in the most  distressing crimes against good taste. The unfettered American humor in  home-building is likely to manifest itself in jigsaw decorations or in rococo  atrocities of the mid-petroleum era; alongside a thatch-roofed English cottage  is apt to flower some Greek bus-boy&rsquo;s dream of heaven, built of plaster-board.  Our one distinctive contribution to architecture seems to be the sky-scraper,  but as against that we are guilty of the California bungalow and it will take  years to live that down.</p>
<p>No. People told Merrick that he couldn&rsquo;t put over a proposition like  his. Besides, Miami wasn&rsquo;t headed in his direction; it was bound for the beach. </p>
<p>He had a harder task, at first, to sell his idea than to dispose of his  plots, for it was too large to be readily grasped. And his city was too big to  be seen; there were so many trees in the way! He met these initial difficulties  by taking his customers out in air-planes. Now, anybody who is not too agitated  to see at all can perhaps see a good deal from an air-plane. I have my own  theory about how he induced purchasers to buy and bankers to back him. I  suspect he threatened to &ldquo;loop&rdquo; them if they refused. But I may be wrong. His  enthusiasm may have turned the trick. On the other hand, experience convinces  me that of all ways to sell land the air-plane method must be the easiest, for  the first time I went up I would have gladly bought any part of the landscape  beneath me, at any price, provided the pilot had contracted to put me in  immediate possession of my purchase.</p>
<p>Anyhow, George Merrick began his city. The story of how he managed to  secure the millions of dollars necessary to push it through; of how he carried  his obligations alone and risked every cent he had made and could borrow; of  how he met and overcame the inevitable discouragements that follow all untried  enterprises, and finally &ldquo;sold&rdquo; his idea to the public; all this contains  material for a good many stories but it is no part of this one. It is my  purpose to deal with the accomplishment itself, and to show, if I can, that the  story of Coral Gables is more than the history of a great land-selling  enterprise, more, far more, than the mere recital of a daring and successful  real estate project. To me, it is the most important, and in many ways the most  significant, experiment in intelligent city planning, city building and home  development that has been attempted in our time; likewise, it is the most  convincing demonstration we have yet seen of the might and the majesty of  loveliness. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ChapterTwo"></a>Chapter  Two<br>
  The Concept of the Perfect City</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="2300871h-images/Chapter02.jpg" alt="Chapter02" width="650" height="293"></p>
<p>Through it Mr. Merrick is planting in thousands of people a new love of  harmonious homes and an appreciation of the advantages and refinements of  better living. Mind you, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that Coral Gables is intended as a  dwelling place for the well-to-do alone; it is what the builder calls a  &ldquo;balanced city,&rdquo; planned to provide for people of all classes and of every  income, and even the most modest houses are as carefully thought out and as  charmingly executed as the finest. These latter, by the way, are very fine  indeed. With this concept goes a comprehensive city design adhering to the  basic idea of harmony, convenience, beauty and utility.</p>
<p>When I first saw Coral Gables, I beheld little except a few &ldquo;different&rdquo;  houses, distinctive in style and attractive in coloring, a country club and  golf course, and a great Venetian swimming pool hollowed out of the country  rock. At that time&mdash;it was only a short while ago&mdash;I could learn nothing of the  conception back of it. Today it is a robust young city with more than two  thousand residences built and building, each apparently more delightful than  its neighbor, with a bustling business center, with schools, seminaries, banks,  hotels, apartment and club houses. Houses, houses, going up everywhere. Some  magic touch has transformed the very landscape; towering coconut and royal  palms are firmly rooted where yesterday there was nothing; rich tropical  foliage borders the sweeping drives; vines cling to the walls; pergolas have grown  into bowers. One sees trees and plants and flowers the very names of which are  unfamiliar outside the tropics, for the plan is to make Coral Gables a suburb  as superior in the beauty and the luxuriance of its flora as it is distinctive  in other respects. Miles upon miles of smooth, hard, shady streets that open  into spacious plazas with fragrant resting places and tinkling Spanish  fountains; canals that broaden into lakes and anchorages! It is a place to make  you pinch yourself and rub your eyes.</p>
<p>It has grown in size and in scope as miraculously as it has grown in  beauty; from sixteen hundred acres it has spread out to ten thousand; along the  shores of Biscayne Bay. Mr. Merrick has envisioned a waterfront development as  impressive as any ever undertaken and one which involves ten years of work and  the spending of a hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>Ten years of work for an army of men, the spending of twenty times the  purchase price of the entire state of Florida, the building of academies, a  university, sanitariums, clubs, casinos, playgrounds and what not, besides  homes for a hundred thousand people! That is what George Merrick sees ahead of  him and that is what the Coral Gables idea has grown to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When all that has been done,&rdquo; I inquired of him, &ldquo;what are you going  to turn to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered me with a boyish smile, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never given up my  desire to write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now a project of such magnitude as Coral Gables cannot be described in  a few words&mdash;I have as yet given you only a broad survey of it; one of Mr.  Merrick&rsquo;s airplane views&mdash;any more than it can be appreciated at a glance; it is  too staggering in size. But Florida has been setting a new pace for the rest of  America, these last few years, and she has established a new speed record in  everything she has undertaken. Miami, for instance, grew four hundred and forty  per cent during the first ten years of her expansion and other cities with a  later start are pedalling madly to overtake her in the race. The desire to get  somewhere quickly is reflected even in Florida&rsquo;s speed laws which permit  forty-five miles an hour on her public roads. To be able to step on the gas  without the spine-twisting necessity of looking backward is worth a lot to any  motorist. It is worth a house and lot. Florida isn&rsquo;t looking backward, these days:  her eyes are set straight ahead.</p>
<p>Enterprises too big to be readily comprehended are apt to be considered  unsound; it is the softwoods that grow swiftly, whereas oaks are the product of  ages. This amazing growth of Florida towns and cities, this astonishing  increase in land values, swifter and more feverish than anything this country  has even seen, prompts skeptical outsiders to ask if it is warranted and to  wonder if it is not merely part of a boom which will collapse. If so, then of  course Mr. Merrick&rsquo;s plan for a completed suburb of a hundred thousand souls,  like Miami&rsquo;s expectation of a million residents, will fail. Before going  further, therefore, it will pay us to stop and to inquire as to the prospects  for a realization of these ambitious undertakings.</p>
<p>In order to discover whether the Florida excitement is justified or is  merely a bubble which will burst, we will have to widen our vision sufficiently  to take in the whole state and likewise examine into the causes of this  epoch-making trek to the tropics.</p>
<p>It so happens that I know the state reasonably well, for when I was a  small boy my parents took me by the hand and snatched me thither to escape the  snows of Michigan and to disappoint the pneumonia and other germs which lend  such an exciting element of uncertainty to a continued residence in any  northern clime. My father had grown sick of chilblains and was completely fed  up on a climate consisting of three parts winter and one part late-in-the-fall,  so he went as far south as the map permitted. I grew up in Florida, I absorbed  an education from her schools, the most of which I promptly forgot, and having  returned frequently, I feel that I can talk with the authority of an intimate  acquaintance and the freedom of a friend.</p>
<p>Based not alone upon my own knowledge and observation, but also upon  the opinions of others, I claim that Florida has two assets, either of which is  sufficient to more than warrant the growth she is undergoing. Her climate is  one, her soil is the other. She was discovered by the rich, for the profit of  the poor and those of moderate means. She began as a fad and has become a  winter-time necessity. She has an inexhaustible pay-streak, not in her sand but  in her sky: it is as wide as her boundaries and so long as snow flies further  north, so long as the sun shines and the Gulf stream flows that pay-streak will  return steady dividends. So long as flowers bloom, birds sing and children  laugh; so long as men revel in the beautiful and aspire to old age, so long  will Florida remain a playground and a sanctuary. The gold in her flaming  sunsets is real gold.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>There is but one Florida and one California and the American people are  learning how to play. It took several generations to learn that life is not all  work and that the grave is not its goal, but the discovery leaked out and it is  spreading like a rash.</p>
<p>If Florida&rsquo;s rocks were gold-bearing or if she sat with her feet in a  vast pool of petroleum like some of her sister states, the hardest-boiled  skeptics would admit that she was rich, but even so she would not be richer  than she is in the possession of her climate. Mines can be worked out and oil  wells run dry: her sun will never cool. </p>

  Trail Blazers on a New Frontier</b></h2>

<p>There are periods of migration in the lives of people, times when they  move m masse. It may be the urge of some restless tribal inheritance or merely  an effort at readjustment to geographical limitations; in any event, America  has had many such migrations, as, for instance, the rush of Forty-nine, the  several movements into the farming regions of the middle and the northwest, the  Klondike stampede and the recent surge to Southern California. These hegiras  are due to the desire of men to improve their living conditions and their  eagerness to seek surroundings of greater opportunity. Such a movement is now  going on towards Florida, but there is nothing novel about it, nor is it any  more artificial or any harder to understand than the rush which populated the  West and brought it under the plow.</p>
<p>The emigrants are not using covered wagons, to be sure; they are going  south in Pullmans and in Packards, in steel ships and in tin Lizzies, but so  great is their number that new highways are being laid, double tracks are being  put down and steamships are being built and chartered to handle the traffic. It  is merely the pushing out of a pioneer people towards a new frontier. We are a  nation of trail blazers and we never come home, except to visit.</p>
<p>The progress of this modern gas-wagon train is not punctuated by the  crack of bull whips, as in former days, but by the sound of blowouts and  punctures. Nothing except the profanity is what it was.</p>
<p>The leisure class adopted Florida long since as a winter playground,  but people of moderate means are beginning to realize that they can afford it.  In many parts of the North it is cheaper to go south for the winter than to buy  coal, and good roads make it unnecessary to purchase a railroad ticket.</p>
<p>The golf bug and the influenza germ are selling Florida farms and town  lots faster than the highest pressure salesman; the purchase of property down  there is not a speculation in lands but an investment in health.</p>
<p>If Florida abandoned her citrus groves and her farms to weeds, closed  her mills and factories and loosed her herds, she would, nevertheless, continue  to fill up every winter with visitors and she would still remain a great and  prosperous resort.</p>
<p>But in addition to this perennial horde of health and pleasure-seekers  there is another army on the march and it is made up of small investors, of  workers in search of permanent homes and steady employment. They are pouring  into the state like water into a funnel and it is they who will bring the greatest  stability; it is they to whom far-sighted Floridians look with particular pride  and satisfaction.</p>
<p>In March, 1925, there was held at West Palm Beach a meeting of  representative business men from all parts of the state and they organized  themselves into the Florida Development Board. Florida had just ended her  richest tourist season, the men at that convention had profited enormously  therefrom, so they committed themselves and the state to raise and spend for  publicity a million and a half dollars during the next five years. But  publicity for what? For the purpose of increasing the already abundant yield of  the tourist crop? No. To further scientific research into the natural resources  of the state and to acquaint the people of America with what Florida has to  offer the permanent settler. They knew that the rush of pleasure-seekers could  not be stemmed; what they discussed was farming, education, freight rates,  markets, industries and the like.</p>
<p>It is their belief, and it is mine, that Florida is richer in  undeveloped natural wealth than perhaps any state in the Union, and that if  tomorrow her winter visitors should cease coming she would continue to forge  steadily ahead and to reap a greater profit from her soil than from her  climate.</p>
<p>This may be news to those who have looked upon the state as a sand-lot  with nothing for sale except sunshine and a place incapable of raising anything  except hotel prices. If it is true, then Florida is indeed sitting pretty. Let&rsquo;s  see whether it is true or whether it is merely the seductive song of the  realtor.</p>
<p>We shall have to use some figures, the which I hate as much as you do,  but statistics can sometimes be made interesting, as any father of a large and  growing family will testify.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Let us begin with Miami, and when we have done with her let us take a  hasty glance at the state as a whole, for after all, the story of Coral Gables,  which I set out to tell, is the story of Miami, and the story of Miami is the  story of Florida.</p>
<p>Miamians declare that their city never has had a &ldquo;boom,&rdquo; that it is not  having one now and that its growth from a village of about one thousand  inhabitants to a city of one hundred and eleven thousand in twenty-five years  is largely the result of the permanent productive resources at its door. Its  further expansion into a metropolis of a million people, they assure you, will  not greatly depend upon its tourists. It is almost a waste of time, by the way,  to set down Miami&rsquo;s &ldquo;present population&rdquo;; it means so much rubbing out and  writing of new figures.</p>
<p>Dade County, in which Miami is situated, has a practical monopoly of the  actual &ldquo;American tropics&rdquo; so-called, at least an East Coast monopoly. Killing  frosts are unknown, its soil is rich and liberally watered, which means that  the fruits and vegetables native to tropical countries can be raised in  commercial quantities, plus also many of the crops that grow in cooler  climates. Something is fruiting on the farms every month of the year.</p>
<p>Oranges and grapefruit, of course, do well in Dade County; their  quality is famous and they are usually the first on the market, but the mango  and the avocado find here a location better adapted to their culture than any  other in the United States. They are magnificent fruits, they command a ready  market and their raising is profitable. The mango is the most ancient of fruits  and in Dade County fancy varieties have been developed. The avocado&mdash;Floridians  dislike the name &ldquo;alligator pear&rdquo;&mdash;is the most nutritious and valuable food  fruit now under cultivation and it bears the year round. Groves have shown a  yield of $1,000 per acre and near Miami you can see one avocado tree which has  produced an average of $200 a year for six years. The county shipped 30,000  crates last year and many of the groves are not yet in bearing.</p>
<p>South of Miami lies the Redlands section, an astonishingly fertile  truck-gardening region which is given over largely to tomato raising. Sixteen  thousand acres of early tomatoes is a nice asset for any county. But there  seems to be no limit to what the soil and the climate of Dade County can raise  and, mind you, out of nearly a million and a half acres, less than 60,000 are  in cultivation and these lie in a narrow strip along the coast. Back of this  are the Everglades, perhaps the richest agricultural lands in the world,  certainly the most fertile area of its size in the country. Here, almost  untouched, is the fairest promise of Florida&rsquo;s dreams, an enormous level bed of  black humus under a sky like the glass roof of a hot-house; here, once the land  is drained, can be grown enough vegetables to feed a nation.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>The average person has a wholly wrong idea of these &rsquo;Glades. Not much  is generally known about them&mdash;or is an Everglades an &ldquo;it&rdquo;! Listen, for example,  to the Encyclopaedia Brittanica&rsquo;s definition: &ldquo;An American lake, about 8,000  square miles, in which are numerous half-submerged islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, Mr. Brittan! You should be more careful what you put in your books!  You&rsquo;re as wrong as arson.</p>
<p>I had some such erroneous idea about the Everglades when I was a  schoolboy. I pictured them as an enormous black-water swamp grown up to matted  vegetation, infested with serpents, alligators and miasmas. I had never seen a  miasma, but I could guess what it looked like. This swamp was a trackless  wilderness through the gloom of which slipped Seminole canoes paddled by  treacherous redskins. It was my ambition to head a band of hardy adventurers of  my own age and exterminate the whole dastardly tribe&mdash;until I heard an actual  account of the first expedition to cross the Everglades. The men in that party  (it was in 1891) had waded practically across the state from Fort Shackleford  to Miami, with packs on their backs. They had subsisted for the last week on  two tablespoonsful of raw hominy per man and the only bloodshed had been caused  by mosquitoes. I knew my band of explorers would never consent to eat raw  hominy so I abandoned the enterprise.</p>
<p>I crossed the Everglades recently in a limousine, at forty miles an  hour. Another dream punctured. If a man can&rsquo;t believe his Encyclopaedia, what  can he believe?</p>
<p>What I beheld was an almost limitless plain, as level as a ballroom  floor and practically devoid of trees, its mellow soil laid over a foundation  of porous lime rock. Canals run through it and the rock taken out is utilized  for road-building: wherever the land is drained it will raise crops to astonish  the northern gardener.</p>
<p>This drainage problem is not so simple as it sounds, for danger comes  with its overdoing. Drop a cigarette on a tract that is well dried out and the  soil will burn. Successful reclamation, therefore, involves scientific water  regulation as well as disposal. This the state of Florida is working out in  co-operation with the Federal government and once it is effected it will render  available an enormous acreage capable of supporting a population denser than  that of the Dutch lowlands. Already millions of dollars have been invested in  sugar plantations and mills and a beginning has been made to manufacture and  make use of the many tropical fibre plants and grasses which can be raised  thereon. So, too, with rubber which is indigenous to the country; with cotton  and tobacco, bananas, pineapples and Heaven knows what. A northern paper  company is planting a hundred thousand acres to peanuts just for the oil. The  oil is needed to use up the hydrogen gas which is a by-product of their Maine  pulp mills. The finished product is a hard, white fat, a vegetable lard. </p>

<p>This muck land doesn&rsquo;t wait for the farmer, it goes to work as soon as  it is drained. There is a common weed in Florida, known by the amply  descriptive name of &ldquo;careless weed.&rdquo; In the reclaimed Everglades it grows so  big that a man can climb it! Exaggeration, you say. But I saw a photograph of a  man standing in the branches of one, and his feet were shoulder high above the  ground. Dirt which will grow stuff like that will grow anything. It can be  shipped as fertilizer, and the &rsquo;Glades farmer is faced with the necessity of &ldquo;thinning&rdquo;  it out, reducing its fertility, instead of enriching it.</p>
<p>As a beef-raising and dairy country nothing finer ever laid  out-of-doors. What with year-round natural forage of luxuriant tropical  grasses, cattle, I was solemnly assured, grow so fat on this fodder that they  run eleven to the dozen. And hogs! Put a pine-woods razor-back in the  Everglades and in a week he&rsquo;ll have a double chin.</p>

<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Barely the fringe of this area is being worked, as yet, but in the  vicinity of Miami the land is selling as high as a thousand dollars an acre.  And why not when it can be made to yield that much in a year? I learned of a  man who last season took $900 worth of Irish potatoes off of three-quarters of  an acre and of another whose crop of string beans from a single acre sold for  $2,400.</p>
<p>When one stops to consider that in certain Asiatic countries entire  families support themselves upon the yield from a fraction of an acre of land  no richer than this and that ownership of one whole acre means independence,  how can he visualize the potentialities of the five million acres in the  southern counties of Florida or estimate the numbers of workers to whom it will  some day afford a livelihood ?</p>
<p>Mid-western communities, where the farms yield from $20 to $50 an acre,  have built up and support large cities; with a million and a half acres in Dade  County alone, besides millions of other acres nearby, much of which will return  a profit of from $100 to $1,000 a year, is it unreasonable of Miamians to  expect a city of a million souls ? Not at all.</p>
<p>In any event, that is Miami&rsquo;s aim and she is putting herself in order  to accommodate that number of people. Already her skyline begins to look like  New York&rsquo;s and the price of her downtown real estate is as high as her skyline.</p>
<p>Last year she had no steamship lines from the north, this year she has  more than her docking space will accommodate and new vessels are being added  weekly. She is a logical point of contact with Latin-American countries and is  making harbor improvements designed to render her the principal Pan-American  port of the Atlantic. With the development of her back country and with the new  railroad accommodations which are now being effected she expects to load most  of the phosphate and much of the lumber of the state. It is not without reason  that she looks forward to more shipping than New Orleans, Galveston or  Savannah.</p>
<p>So much then for this immediate section, which by no means has a corner  on Florida&rsquo;s native wealth. The coast counties to the north, all the way up to  Jacksonville, are rich; each, it seems, has a soil and a climate unique unto  itself, each boasts a city which hopes to rival the queen city to the south.  Residents of one locality in Florida will not attempt to deny or to belittle  the advantages of any other locality, such being contrary to the general code  of ethics; they will agree that all Florida is fine. After this admission they  will then set out to show you that of all the desirable places in the state for  a man to live and die in, this one particular spot has it over the others like  a tent.</p>
<p>From present indications the entire lower East Coast will soon be a  continuous chain of winter resorts, its water front lined with splendid homes,  its back country checkerboarded with fruit groves, dairies, vegetable farms and  truck gardens.</p>
<p>But the East Coast is only a part of Florida. Follow me on a motor trip  that I took recently and perhaps it will open your eyes, as it did mine, to the  vastness of the state&rsquo;s possibilities and to the extent of this history-making  rush to our last frontier.</p>
<p>From Miami to Palm Beach, and further, one &ldquo;development&rdquo; follows  another, every town is growing, the land is being cleared and built upon;  teams, tractors, dredges are at work. It is a scene of astonishing activity.</p>
<p>The Connors Highway is a toll road from the Palm Beach section to Lake  Okeechobee: it is a shiny ribbon of oiled rock laid down upon the crest of one  of the drainage canal banks and it opens up a tremendous area of Everglades  land resembling those tule lands of California where the Japanese have made  such a success of wholesale gardening. Many canals are being dug, other roads  are building. As far as you can see one acre looks as good as another.</p>
<p>Lake Okeechobee is a fresh water sea fed by rivers and by enormous  springs and I was surprised to learn that it supports important commercial  fisheries which are yearly growing in value. It is a bait-casters&rsquo; heaven, by  the way: big mouth bass weighing twenty pounds have been taken on rod and reel.</p>
<p>West, beyond the horizon, lies the prosperous Moore Haven district,  famous for its productivity, and still on beyond is Fort Myers, the Miami of  the West Coast tropics. North of the lake is Okeechobee City, a spick and span  town with the magnificent ambition of becoming the agricultural metropolis of  the state. Everything hereabouts is pretty raw as yet; hard-surfaced roads are  something novel and the railroad spikes haven&rsquo;t had time to get rusty. Here, as  in every other town I visited, the chief concern of the residents is how and  where to house the home-seekers which this winter will surely bring.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>North for seventy-five miles extends the Kissimmee valley, if a country  almost too flat to drain itself can be called a valley, and here, too, lie  thousands of acres of swamp lands for reclamation.</p>
<p>Perhaps you don&rsquo;t know that Florida is a &ldquo;cow country,&rdquo; but it is. The  largest cattle ranch east of the Mississippi lies on the Kissimmee River:  220,000 acres under fence. Several years ago a group of northern lumbermen  undertook to buy a hundred thousand acres of pine land in this section and made  the owner an offer of three dollars an acre. The price was satisfactory but the  deal fell through because the purchasers wanted nothing but the timber and  firmly refused to be saddled with the land. Today, memory of that transaction  gives them an acute headache.</p>
<p>Extending north and south through the center of the state, like a backbone,  is the &ldquo;ridge country,&rdquo; in some respects the fairest section of all Florida. It  is a range of low hills made up of that sandy soil so favorable to citrus  growing, and nestling between the hills are myriads of friendly blue lakes of  clear, soft water. Orange and grapefruit groves are everywhere, their  undulating rows marching away to the horizon. From the crest of every ridge  other groves appear and other lakes smile through the pines. They are young  groves, most of them, for this country, too, has just been discovered. New  homes, new business blocks, new hotels in every town, and everywhere the same  boast and the same complaint: &ldquo;This is the finest spot in all Florida.&rdquo; &ldquo;What  are we going to do with this winter&rsquo;s visitors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chambers of Commerce are appealing for funds with which to build  temporary barracks to shelter the coming hordes.</p>
<p>Central Florida is the Land of Ten Thousand Lakes, and it has a shore  line sufficient to afford water-front homes for a million families. Sebring,  Lakeland, Kissimmee, Orlando, Sanford, each is &ldquo;the loveliest spot in Florida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great blessings often come in the guise of calamities. It took the  scourge of the boll weevil to teach southern cotton planters the value of  diversified farming. Florida used to depend almost entirely upon orange  culture, but thirty years ago a freeze wiped out most of the groves in the  central and northern parts of the state. Things looked pretty blue for a while  after that and land could be bought for almost nothing. Then, in a certain  locality, somebody tried tomato raising and was astonished to find that it paid  better than citrus growing. Soon that entire region was engaged in gardening.</p>
<p>At Sanford, which the freeze had left flat on its back and feebly  kicking, another man experimented with celery and others followed his example.  They grew rich, and today you don&rsquo;t have to be told that Sanford is the celery  center of the south, you can smell it before you come in sight of the town. It  shipped $4,000,000 worth last season.</p>
<p>So, too, at Hastings, where the Irish potato attains its greatest size  and ferocity. I am not much of an agriculturist but I am told that potato  hunting has put Hastings on Easy Street and that all a sportsman needs to bag  his limit is a rake.</p>
<p>Plant City, as a result of its misfortune, learned to specialize in  strawberries: 10,000 quarts have been raised on a single acre and sold for  forty-five cents a quart.</p>
<p>Elsewhere it is the same story. Near Quincy, a great poultry and dairy  district, a tobacco-grower reported last year a new profit of $2,000 an acre  from forty acres of Sumatra wrappers and Sumatra wrappers are being worn extensively  this season. Land like that could raise bell-bottom pants.</p>

  The Rediscovery of Florida</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="2300871h-images/Chapter05.jpg" alt="chapter05" width="650" height="316"></p>
<p>There are more than one hundred different qualities of soil in the  state, each suitable for something and there are twenty million acres, a large  part of which can be made to yield. Pineapples and pecans, citrus and celery,  cattle and cantaloupes, egg plants of the hen and the vegetable variety&mdash;almost  anything can be made to pay.</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t more being raised, you inquire? Who has kept Florida such a  dark secret? Why is it that less than one acre out of ten is broken? For one  thing, the state has just been discovered. Columbus found it but the New York  Four Hundred put it on the map; Palm Beach and the one-piece bathing suit  advertised it more than Ponce de Leon and the Overseas Railroad.</p>
<p>Blame it on climate, easy living, hook-worm or what you will, the  Florida farmer of the old type elevated shiftlessness to the dignity of a real  accomplishment, if not of an actual art. </p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300871h-images/page042.jpg" alt="page042" width="506" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>I remember one of the sort who complained that his corn patch had  played out until it would barely yield ten bushels to the acre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you fertilize it?&rdquo; somebody inquired. The fellow languidly  shook his head and replied: &ldquo;Lord! If I manured that patch of mine, the weeds  would git so thick my woman couldn&rsquo;t see to hoe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This type of husbandman is rapidly going out of style down there: the  day of intelligent, energetic, intensive culture is dawning.</p>
<p>In one place I was told of a man, well along in years, who had been  brought into the country on a stretcher to die but who decided to play a trick  on the doctors and get well. The Florida climate puts elderly people up to  pranks of that sort. He had carried out his little joke, and moreover he was  getting rich on five acres of hammock land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year he raised six thousand dollars worth of celery on one acre,&rdquo;  said my informant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; I declared. &ldquo;I know this state backwards; cut off a  couple of ciphers, or even one, and we&rsquo;ll let the matter drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to bet a hundred dollars I&rsquo;m wrong?&rdquo; the man inquired. &ldquo;If you  do, I&rsquo;ll bet you another hundred that you&rsquo;ve made a bad bet. &rdquo;</p>
<p>Caution prompted me to evade a direct answer. Why profit from a  stranger&rsquo;s enthusiasm when money can be so easily come by in Florida town lots,  I asked myself? I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t bet. In refusing that wager I consider that I  made a clean hundred dollars, for I saw the farmer, went over his land and  talked to him. He raised $6,250 worth of celery from that acre in question,  besides which he harvested two other crops off the same piece, one of mustard,  I believe, and the other of okra, and they yielded him about two thousand  dollars more. During the several years he has been working that land he has  averaged, from a variety of crops, more than four thousand dollars an acre. No  wonder! It is practically solid leaf mould into which he can thrust a rake  handle up to the head.</p>
<p>When I asked him why he didn&rsquo;t clear the rest of his land and cultivate  it, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes all my time and all the help I can get to work these five  acres. I&rsquo;m doing well enough and if my farm was any bigger it would get away  from me. You can&rsquo;t let this land lie idle or it will have to be cleared all  over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many acres of land like this in Florida and little of it is  being worked.</p>
<p>Funny things are happening in farm properties down there, as well as in  city real estate. A man got a price on an orange grove; terms one-third down,  the balance on time. While the ink on the contract was drying, he sold the  green crop, as it hung on the trees, for enough to cover the first payment. The  fruit buyer took all risks.</p>
<p>The boom was slow in reaching the West Coast and that part of it from  Tampa to Fort Myers is about where the Miami section was five years ago, but  everywhere the same story is being repeated. St. Petersburg was one of the  first to capitalize her sunshine, but in the beginning she was known  principally to people in the middle west and her winter sports ran to roque,  checkers, and horseshoe hurling. Some painstaking statistician, interested in  vital facts, claimed figures to show that the flowing beards in St. Petersburg,  if laid tip to chin, would reach farther than all the binder twine in both  Dakotas. The quoit-pitchers are still there, roque and checkers remain popular  forms of dissipation, but the elderly mid-westerners are lost among the busy  throngs from every part of the union. St. Petersburg is metropolitan, her  country clubs are as &ldquo;smart,&rdquo; her hotels are as huge and as high-priced as any  in the state. I believe one of her newspapers still adheres to its old practice  of giving away its copies on any day that the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine.</p>
<p>Clearwater, famous as the golfer&rsquo;s mecca, is a town of about six  thousand, but it has plotted its curves and can prove to you that it will be a city  of a hundred thousand within five years, at the present rate of growth. It is  without doubt, &ldquo;the finest spot in Florida.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tampa,&ldquo;finer than any other place in the state,&rdquo; and second only to  Jacksonville in size, is fairly bursting her seams. She is growing like one of  those careless weeds I described and her shallow bay is being dredged and  filled with islands which will give her a Venetian charm. Less than two years  ago the first &ldquo;under-seas&rdquo; lots, then populated principally by mullet and  catfish, were offered for sale. People stood in line forty hours to buy, and  the first man up, so the story goes, chained himself to the door in order to be  sure of maintaining his place. Today people are living on those lots and public  buildings are going up around them.</p>
<p>Sarasota, Punta Gorda, Fort Myers, everywhere the same history is being  written; towns are building, lands are doubling and trebling in value. Wherever  roads are laid down, purchasers come and homeseekers follow.</p>
<p>Brooksville, less than fifty miles north of Tampa, until a year ago,  lacked a hard-surfaced road and to go there was an adventure. Now it is booming  and points with pride to the lumber and farming possibilities of its great  hard-wood hammocks, and its fertile hills. Inside the town limits is a ten-acre  tangerine grove which paid a net profit of $16,000 last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, stranger,&rdquo; a local resident told me, &ldquo;we can ship this Hernando  County soil in bags and get rich. We&rsquo;ve sure got the garden spot of this state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps I have told you enough to prove my contention that Florida  could carry on, if she had to, without the help of those who invest in health  or come for recreation.</p>

  The Greatest Development Drama in History</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="2300871h-images/Chapter06.jpg" alt="chapter06" width="650" height="333"></p>
<p>Most of my novels deal with significant phases in the development of  this country; such as the rush to the far north, the digging of the Panama  Canal, the exploitation of Alaskan wealth, the quest of oil in the southwest,  for in their meaning and their consequences I see a wider drama than in the  affairs of men. Such a drama is unfolding in Florida but it is bigger, it is  more exciting and it is more significant than any mass movement I have written  about. It reminds me of a certain motion picture, now showing, which depicts  the heroic struggle of a primitive Asiatic tribe to move its herds in search of  grass. Their journey leads through deserts, across raging rivers, up and over a  great, frowning timberless mountain range capped with ice and snow. Barefooted,  ill-clad men, women and children push on and upward, driving their hungry herds  and carrying their own sick and feeble, together with the young animals in  their arms or on their backs. They leave blood in their tracks.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300871h-images/page048.jpg" alt="page048" width="479" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>This rush to the far southland is another quest for &ldquo;grass,&rdquo; with the  hardships missing. But these people will not return.</p>
<p>Much the same thing happened when Indian Territory was thrown open. The  settlers settled; they made Oklahoma. California was discovered and then  rediscovered; her lands will never again be cheap. Why should the Florida  &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; burst?</p>
<p>California is a regal state but much of her land is pure, inspiring  scenery; only her plains and valleys are tillable. She doubled her population  twice in twenty years. Florida has neither mountains nor deserts, she is  blessed with water from above and below and her climate is such that her crops  are mainly high-priced specialties rather than staples; she is today where  California was twenty years ago. She is doing what California and every other  new state did, viz., bidding for people to mint her riches into coin.</p>
<p>The real values of any state are its land values, based upon yield:  fixed population, in the last analysis, springs from the soil. Florida has the  land and the plows are coming. She can easily ship half a billion dollars of  farm produce every season, aside from her livestock, her fish, her phosphate  rock, her lumber and naval stores. She markets a billion feet of lumber  annually and out of her standing pines, in summer, drips $50,000 a day. </p>
<p>When all these products have been marketed, she still has the proceeds  from her tourist crop as &ldquo;velvet.&rdquo; Situated almost within commuting distance of  three-quarters of the population and seven-eighths of the wealth of the United  States that crop is bound to increase.</p>
<p>It may strike you that I have strayed far from my story of Coral  Gables, but the digression was intentional. No project so ambitious as that of  Mr. Merrick&rsquo;s, it seems to me, could well be carried out unless it were based  upon a foundation of solid growth, not only for Miami but also for the entire  state. Perhaps, too, we shall have gained a better idea of the significance of  that undertaking for having seen what is going on elsewhere down there;  certainly it is interesting to compare the results of the one-man idea in city  building with the results of the composite idea as reflected in the other  Florida cities, old and new.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Had I not been deeply impressed by that comparison I would not have  undertaken this article. Men of vision, of courage, and of abundant energy have  worked wonders in and around Miami: more and greater wonders than elsewhere in  the state. The metamorphosis of a sandy key backed by a mangrove swamp into a  magnificent playground with miles of boulevards, with hotels and mansions and  polo fields and golf courses is an example. The creation of enchanted islands  linked together by sweeping causeways, like sparkling gems strung upon a silken  thread, is another. Wherever nature has given those Miami builders something,  anything, upon which to base a majestic plan of betterment, there they have  loosed their millions and miracles have resulted. And yet they have gone only  so far. Out of the ooze, out of the very waters, they have made land, but there  they have rested. Merrick had his land to begin with; his task has been to  develop, to coordinate and to beautify.</p>
<p>After a trip through Florida one comes back to Coral Gables with the  feeling that it is something altogether different from anything else in the  state, and that here is an abstract idea made real and understandable.</p>
<p>Somebody asked Heine why men no longer build such piles as the  Cathedral of Amiens and he replied: &ldquo;In those days men had convictions, we  moderns have opinions, and it requires something more than an opinion to build  a Gothic cathedral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rudest work that tells a story or records an ambition is better  than the finest without meaning and it required a very deep conviction to build  Coral Gables. The following words might very well have come from George Merrick&rsquo;s  lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have, then, our ordinary dwelling houses built to last, and  built to be lovely: as rich and full of pleasantries as may be within and  without&hellip; Therefore, when we build let us think that we build forever, let it  not be for present delight, nor for present use alone, let it be such work as  our descendants will thank us for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruskin wrote those sentences, but they appear to quite completely voice  the feelings of the builder of this modem Mediterranean city.</p>
<p>Mr. Merrick is making his houses &ldquo;rich and full of pleasantries,&rsquo;&rsquo; and  they are being built not alone for present delight. Nor are they flung down  haphazard, where colors may clash and one architecture may scream at another.</p>
<p>We Americans are great organizers and great developers, but as city  builders we do not rank far above the Aztecs. We have two methods of laying out  our towns; the cowpath and the criss-cross. Observe Boston or downtown New  York. Or Chicago, that apotheosis of geometrical regularity. These methods result  in ugly, swollen, inconvenient cities, economical in land but wasteful of  things more precious; money-making cities of bitter men, faded women and  feeble, gas-bleached children.</p>
<p>Coral Gables was not worked out with a pencil and ruler on any such  careless principle; artists, city planners, landscape architects, construction  and utility engineers, each an authority in his own line, worked over it and  under their supervision it is going forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had more difficulty at first in selling the idea of architectural,  harmony than in selling the land,&rdquo; Mr. Merrick confessed. &ldquo;People resented it  as a sort of censorship of their good taste. But we have no difficulty now. It  is surprising how enthusiastically they took hold once they fully understood  and appreciated our purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ChapterSeven"></a>Chapter  Seven<br>
  The Master Impulse Behind Coral Gables</b></h2>
<p align="center"><img src="2300871h-images/Chapter07.jpg" alt="chaper07" width="650" height="335"></p>
<p>The thought back of Coral Gables isn&rsquo;t new, it is so old that it is  novel, that&rsquo;s all. Ever since the days of the great builders of the Renaissance  architects have cherished the dream of a city designed under one master impulse  and here is the first actual experiment on a large scale. Washington has been  &ldquo;planned,&rdquo; to be sure, but only along broad lines and not in detail.</p>
<p>The first real example of architectural unity which we, in this  country, had a chance to observe was the Chicago World&rsquo;s Fair. From that gleaming  city on the Jackson Park lagoons Americans carried away a new appreciation of  structural beauty, and the expositions that followed it fixed and heightened  that appreciation. But all were dream cities and the first winter wind blew  them away like chaff.</p>
<p>Here in Florida is growing a World&rsquo;s Fair city of concrete, made to  live in; a mirage turned to stone and framed in a setting of tropical  loveliness made lovelier by the cunning of skilled landscape engineers.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2300871h-images/page054.jpg" alt="page054" width="503" height="750"></h3>
<h3 align="center">&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Never was a location more favored for building, for most of the  material lies underfoot. At first sight the land looks sterile, for the rock  crops out loosely and the soil is so shallow that trees have to be planted with  dynamite. Holes have to be blasted. But the more one sees of that rock, the  greater blessing it becomes.</p>
<p>A foot or two under the surface it is soft and therefore cheap to dig;  exposure hardens it. Crush it, size it, add water and cement and you have  concrete that will defy the ravages of time. Run the mixture into moulds and  you have building blocks. If you prefer rough field-stone walls, select the  boulders which have hardened in the air and lay them up in mortar, or if your  taste runs to square, quarried blocks skilled artisans with hatchets will shape  the soft rock and time will turn it to flint. It will age into pink and mellow  ivory. To build streets lay the stone soft, roll it and oil it and the surface  is like asphalt.</p>
<p>Things will grow in that coral rock. Shoot a hole in one of those  smooth roads, plant a tree in it, scratch enough soil in to cover the roots and  it will live. Live and do well. Capillarity will draw moisture up to the roots  and they will reach down through the interstices.</p>
<p>Walls capable of such variety in treatment can be made beautiful, but  that which first strikes any eye are roofs, and the roofs of Coral Gables are  like fine old oriental rugs. Most of them are of Spanish tile moulded by hand  over the naked thighs of workmen now long dead. Cuban roofs, torn from  crumbling convents and ruined haciendas, their patterns blended, their colors  softened by tropic sun and weather, have been relaid here and they are a  delight to behold.</p>
<p>When a northern visitor, still itching from his winter woolens, comes  upon one of these charming Mediterranean homes, half hidden and half revealed  by vines and fragrant flowering shrubbery, when he hears overhead the whisper  of restful voices among the palm fronds and through the green of orange and  mango and lacy pine he glimpses other houses of tinted coral, other roofs that  glow like bits from the magic carpet of Bagdad, he is very apt to decide that  his wanderings are over. Florida is likely to take on a new meaning to him,  right there and then, and likewise the problem of living. If he has read John  Boyle O&rsquo;Reilly he may quote this verse:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I am weary of planning and toiling<br>
  In the crowded hives of men;<br>
  Heart weary of building and spoiling<br>
  And spoiling and building again;</p>
<p class="note">And I long for the dear old river<br>
  Where I dreamed my youth away;<br>
  For a dreamer lives forever,<br>
  And a toiler dies in a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or if he is not poetical and is perhaps a bit winded from wrestling  with his last income tax return, he may recall the fact that Florida income and  inheritance tax provisions make it possible for a wealthy man to save money by  building a Florida home and that a man of moderate means may, by taking up a  residence there, effect a sufficient saving to carry the cost of a house and  lot.</p>
<p>In any event it is no wonder that the sales in Coral Gables run a  million dollars a week and that there is thirty million dollars of building  under way at this writing.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Coral Gables was begun as an inland city; today it announces &ldquo;forty  miles of water front&rdquo; and the how of that is interesting. Not only has it grown  to take in Cocoplum Beach, on Biscayne Bay immediately south of aristocratic  Coconut Grove, but also the sea is actually being brought back into the heart  of the pine woods. Dredges are cutting canals both wide and deep from the bay,  and digging lakes and yacht basins which will be linked up with the waters  flowing out from the Everglades to form a vast circulating system of waterways.  It is an enormous undertaking and one that looks fantastically extravagant on  its face. But it is not. Every yard of rock dug by those dippers is worth two  dollars for road and house building. The enterprise will pay for itself.</p>
<p>Gondolas from old Venice have been ordered for this new Venice;  architects are draughting plans for &ldquo;modified&rdquo; Venetian houses, some as  splendid as the palaces of the Doges, to border these canals. Residents will be  able to moor their yachts to their own doorsteps, or alongside the clipped  velvet fairways of their country clubs. Gondolas, hydroplanes and sea sleds  will take them to places of amusement, for it is a gay city, this Coral Gables,  with every sort of entertainment provided for. Fancy moonlight on a Florida  lagoon; palms black against the sky; night fragrant with the salt breath of the  sea and your electric gondola out of juice! You and your girl friend should  worry.</p>
<p>Coral Gables is already a city of hotels; there are six, aside from the  imposing new Miami-Biltmore with its Spanish tower leaping twenty-six stories  into the sky. Near the latter, and under the same management, is the most  magnificently planned and elaborately appointed country club structure that I  have ever seen. It has two eighteen-hole golf courses and between the club and  the hotel is a swimming pool built on the scale which characterizes both. In  connection with the Miami-Biltmore there will be a Casino and amusement center  set upon an island in the bay and it is proposed to make of this an American  Monte Carlo, a rendezvous for the fashionable who are in search of  entertainment of whatever sort. The fourth unit in this particular enterprise  will be a yacht club and all told they will call for an expenditure of some $25,000,000.  Europe has nothing to compare with this effort to answer the question &ldquo;Where  shall we go and what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

  A Wide, Green and Gracious City</b></h2>

<p>What about those people who cannot afford or do not wish to play?  Somebody has quite aptly described this distinctive suburb as &ldquo;a wide, green  and gracious city, preserving the right relation between a man&rsquo;s work and his  welfare, his play and his environment.&rdquo; It is served by the five most important  highways of South Florida and is being linked with downtown Miami by a modern  rapid transit system. It is zoned, of course; one section is set aside for the  building of apartments, another for a crafts center&mdash;a Spanish village with  studios and workshops for making ironwork, pottery, tiles, furniture and the  like. Everywhere there is light on four sides. Five sides, to be exact, for  gloomy, leaden skies are unknown. There is room and a place for everything in  Coral Gables except sweat shops and cramped living quarters.</p>

<p>Schools? Certainly. A seminary and a boys&rsquo; military academy, besides  common schools so constructed that the children are practically out of doors.  Yes, and a million dollar high school, and what is planned to be the finest  university in the South. This latter will have one hundred and sixty acres in  its grounds, but will be set in the heart of two thousand acres designed as one  of the most beautiful residential parks in the world. Fifteen million dollars  have been pledged as an endowment for this university and dredges are digging a  lake upon which its campus will front.</p>
<p>A great sanitarium and hospital, directed by nationally famous  physicians and health experts is another feature; so, too, is a million dollar  Shrine Temple and Sports Center.</p>
<p>Such undertakings as these, you will agree, afford a significance, a  dignity and a permanence to this amazing adventure into scientific city  building quite above and apart from any other of the sort. And it may interest  you to learn that the builder has expended more in his development than he has  taken out in sales.</p>
<p>As an example of the Coral Gables adherence to the principle of  harmony, take the Florida East Coast Railroad right-of-way which bisects its  broad acres. Railroads are not things of beauty, except perhaps to the high  salaried executives thereof. For the rest of us they just about ruin any  scenery they run through. But here it is proposed to effect a miracle of beauty  by building a three hundred foot concourse, a splendid park lavishly planted  with tropical verdure. It will extend entirely across the city and, with a huge  station of pleasing lines and suitable architecture, will constitute one of the  impressive features of the place. Instead of an eyesore this railroad  right-of-way will be a delight and an inspiration. Perhaps the only one of its  kind in America.</p>
<p>I hope I have painted some sort of picture of the new Florida which has  come into being so lately and that I have made you acquainted in some sort with  that poet and his ambition to create a City Beautiful. More than all, I hope I  have conveyed to you the idea back of it. Coral Gables is no longer an engaging  prospect, a mirage. It exists. And already it has had an effect greater than  its creator could have visualized. Elsewhere other enterprises are being  patterned after it. Coral Gables architecture is being copied throughout the  state; there is a general expression of desire for not alone the beautiful but  the harmonious as well, and for a blending of beauty and service.</p>

<p>Mr. Merrick and his talented associates have done much; there is much  more to be done. That is the splendid, vital thing about Coral Gables; there  are so many wonders now in the making and you know &ldquo;dreams in their development  have breath, tears, and tortures and the touch of joy.&rdquo; It is a fine thing to  reclaim the wilderness and make it bloom: to build schools and playgrounds,  universities and churches: to put sunshine and air within the reach of families  born and reared in smoky tenement towns. A fine thing, indeed, to build houses  &ldquo;rich and full of pleasantries&rdquo; and to people them with men and women eager to  live brighter, healthier and more useful lives. There is a savor of Omnipotence  about it.</p>
<p>The men who are flinging their millions into Florida real estate  development are doing those very things. Some of them, no doubt, are interested  primarily in profits but others there are to whom the work means more and to  whom the greatest satisfaction will come from their knowledge that they have  created something which will long outlive them.</p>
<p>Ten years of hard work, a hundred millions of hard money is what George  Merrick plans to spend before he rests. Who can envisage what ten years will  bring to that wonderland of Ponce de Leon&rsquo;s? Not you nor I. Nor Mr. Merrick,  with all his soaring vision.</p>
<p>One thing he has already done and it is the biggest part of that  accomplishment which I undertook to write about; he has proven that the  practical can be romanticized and that &ldquo;beauty draws more than oxen.&rdquo; He has  sowed in the hearts of his fellowmen a deeper respect and a truer reverence for  loveliness than they ever had before.</p>
<p>If he should cease his building today, turn his City Beautiful over to  other hands and take up that writing for which his fingers itch, he would still  have a splendid thing to his account. One could look upon Coral Gables and say  with truth: &ldquo;&rsquo;Fore God, you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich!&rdquo; </p>
