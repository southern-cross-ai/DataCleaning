  Renny&rsquo;s Eyes</b></h2>
<p class="note">There was a young lady whose eyes<br>
  Were unique as to color and size;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she opened them wide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People all turned aside,<br>
And started away in surprise.</p>
<p>Which immortal stanza, by the late  Edward Lear, aptly describes our heroine, Renny Loring.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s queer that a  heroine should be called Renny. It was inevitable. The child&rsquo;s mother admired  the name of Renee, and gave it to her daughter, and, the American language  being what it is, the girl was called Renny by nine-tenths of the people who  spoke to her at all. And it suited her. She had none of the dignity that should  belong to a Renee or an Irene, but her gay charm and happy nature well became a  Renny.</p>
<p>Now twenty, and orphaned, the girl  lived with her brother and his wife.</p>
<p>Big, good-natured Byron Loring  thought this arrangement ideal, but his wife, Christine, accepted the situation  only under protest. </p>
<p>Less than a dozen miles, as the  crow flies, from New York City, the crow would, if he flew in the right  direction, find himself in that lovely bit of Westchester County which is  called, and rightly enough, Banbury Gardens.</p>
<p>Why Banbury, is not generally  known, but why Gardens is self-evident.</p>
<p>The small community was what the  Tour-Books call a restricted residential district, and the restricted residents  were very proud of it.</p>
<p>The Loring place was among the  most attractive estates and though not immense was large enough for landscaped  grounds and picture vistas.</p>
<p>Christine could have been very  happy here, had it not been for her bothering sister-in-law.</p>
<p>For Renny was a bother. Careless,  lawless, happy, she had an uncanny way of doing whatever she pleased and making  it seem as if that were the only thing to do.</p>
<p>Her brother, whom the sentimental  mother had named Byron, kept peace in the family. He adored both his wife and  his sister, and would listen to no criticism of either by the other. He always  got Renny out of her scrapes, he always persuaded Christine to overlook the  child&rsquo;s mischief, and, generally speaking, a good time was had by all.</p>
<p>To go back to Renny&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The color was unique because  though brown, it was such a warm, living brown, shining with the light that  never was on sea or land. And the size was simply just as large as eyes could  be without being too large.</p>
<p>So, there you have Renny&rsquo;s eyes.  They could beam, twinkle, shine or glitter as occasion required, and they could  come wide open with a suddenness that would startle the most phlegmatic  observer and send him away in surprise, if that was her intention.</p>
<p>Unlike the late Miss Anna Held,  she could make her eyes behave in any way she chose and she knew many ways to  choose from.</p>
<p>For the rest, the little face was  piquant, lovely and appealing, and Renny was the sweetest flower in Banbury  Gardens.</p>
<p>Her manners were natural and  charming, now and then showing the undeniable fact that she was self-willed and  determined. But her smile was irresistible, and seldom indeed did she fail to  have her own way.</p>
<p>An English poet wrote some verses  about &lsquo;A frank and free young British maiden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That line will go for Renny. She  was American to the tips of her polished finger-nails, but she was frank and  free to a delightful, if surprising degree.</p>
<p>Just now she was holding converse  with one Andrew Remsen, who was big, stalwart and forceful looking, but who was  in that deplorable condition known as &lsquo;wax in her hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He had often confided this fact to  her, he had tried hard to induce an enthusiastic response, but though at times  she had seemed gentle and yielding, oftener she would deride or spurn his  avowals. </p>
<p>Yet Drew Remsen was a fine figure  of a lover. He was a handsome chap, with good features, clear blue eyes and a  smile that Renny said was just like that of the Mona Lisa. This did not offend  the giant whose powerful masculinity could laugh at any allusion to effeminacy.  And too, it was true. A hovering smile on his beautiful mouth and a meaningful  look in his eyes had crashed the heart of many a supercilious glamour girl.</p>
<p>But when Renny would smile on him  the glamour girls were all forgotten.</p>
<p>Yet Renny had no real claim to  supremacy in the Banbury Gardens crowd.</p>
<p>She was pretty, but not a beauty;  she was a charmer but not an enchantress; she had a way with her, but she was  no siren.</p>
<p>And still, she was the only girl  in the world for Drew, and he wanted her to believe it and act upon that  conviction.</p>
<p>Innumerable times he had told her  this, and she had interrupted him, she had begged the question, she had changed  the subject, she had laughed at him, she had even run away from him, but the  next time he found opportunity, he began all over again.</p>
<p>And this afternoon, with his  unfailing hopefulness, he was trying to persuade her to stop her foolishness,  to know her own mind and to admit that she loved him and wanted to marry him,  more than anything else in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; she said,  her eyes vigorously emphasizing her words. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to marry you the  leastest mite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, then? Here for  years you&rsquo;ve been leading me on.&rdquo; This didn&rsquo;t offend her at all; she smiled at  him sympathetically. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve no right to do that unless you care for me.  What do you think you are, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her accusingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I am,&rdquo; she  said, suddenly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not such a paragon as you sometimes tell me I am. In fact,  I&rsquo;m a Cinderella. I have no fortune, I have no home, even, except by my  brother&rsquo;s kindness and his wife&rsquo;s sufferance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renny! stop, you can&rsquo;t mean that!  Aren&rsquo;t you happy with Byron and Christine? You never hinted that before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not hinting it now. Anyone  would know that a girl can&rsquo;t enjoy dependence on her brother and his  antagonistic wife. Christine hates me and I hate her. She makes me feel that I  am a Cinderella, and if she doesn&rsquo;t make me sit in the ashes, it is not because  she wouldn&rsquo;t like to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling! and I never knew! Chuck  it all, Renny. Come to me, and you shall have a home of your own as good as  Christine reigns over. Marry me at once, dear, and get away from that woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten your Fairy  Tale Book?&rdquo; Renny said, quite unmoved by his wholehearted offer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you  remember that to Cinderella there came a prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be your prince! I&rsquo;ll give  you a carriage and glass slippers, that&rsquo;s all I can remember of the old story.  I&rsquo;ll be a prince to you and a fairy godmother and the whole outfit. Oh, Renny,  let&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him appraisingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good sort, Drew,&rdquo; she  said, slowly, &ldquo;and I hate to hurt your feelings. But princes are born, not  made, and you are not of royal birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly! I suppose you&rsquo;re  not speaking of real titles, borne by foreigners&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. I mean the  prince every girl dreams of, who will, sooner or later, come into her life and  claim her for his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not good enough.&rdquo; Renny smiled at  him. &ldquo;You are a fine man, a good looker and a dear friend. But you are not a  prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I am not <i>your</i> prince. I  suppose you will admit there are others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remsen said this, not at all  seriously, but because he had to bridge over until he could get his wits about  him.</p>
<p>What <i>did</i> Renny mean? And in his  heart he knew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, and put into the two words the pent up  bitterness of his whole nature. &ldquo;I see, you have fallen for that rakehell,  Talbot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s eyes came into play, and  so enraged was Andrew Remsen that he met them squarely.</p>
<p>The two were sitting on some big  rocks, which, in a mad chase for the picturesque, had been thrown into a woodsy  spot down in the back stretches of Byron Loring&rsquo;s garden.</p>
<p>Remsen had risen and was glaring  at the girl.</p>
<p>She allowed her eyes to grow cold,  like a burnt out fire, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have, of course, a right to  use any language you please, but that does not accord with your usual good  taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to hell,&rdquo; said Remsen with  still further disregard of his alleged choice of language and, carefully  selecting his proper gait, he strode away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had to come,&rdquo; she said to  herself. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s over, and I&rsquo;m glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She still sat on the rock, musing  over the anticipated glories of her life with Nicholas Talbot, millionaire and  man about town&mdash;many towns.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Remsen stood before her  again.</p>
<p>His anger seemed gone; he was  looking at her beseechingly, pleadingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renny,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Renny,  darling&mdash;my love, my idol, don&rsquo;t, <i>don&rsquo;t</i> make a fool of yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, often,&rdquo; she returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t, so cut it all  out. You don&rsquo;t know Nicholas Talbot, he is the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, drop it, Andrew! It is a poor  way to plead your cause&mdash;vilifying another man! Speak for yourself, John, if you  must, but give over throwing dirt at a man you are jealous of!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tell you, Renny, you don&rsquo;t  know the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, I don&rsquo;t want to learn  about him from you &mdash;you unjust, prejudiced, underhanded defamer of character!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renny, I&rsquo;m ashamed of you! Drop  that absurd attitude, drop it, I say! What does Byron say about this thing?  Does he know of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s eyes shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does by now,&rdquo; she said,  looking rapturous. &ldquo;Nick&rsquo;s going to see Byron this afternoon, and I suppose  he&rsquo;s in the house now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stop it! This must  not go on. You don&rsquo;t know, girl, what that man is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know it is not your affair!  How dare you suggest that you have any right to interfere in my plans? My  brother is my guardian, not you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Byron doesn&rsquo;t know what I do,  about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew, stop it. You have lost your  senses. Don&rsquo;t be a fool! If there is anything about Nick to be known, trust  Byron to discover it. Why get yourself disliked and perhaps insulted by  sticking your finger in the pie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to marry him, Renny? You  want to throw me over? Are you just a heartless coquette? A jilt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare talk to me like  that! We never were engaged. I never said I would marry you, and you know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have if that scum  hadn&rsquo;t come along! You did care for me, you do care for me, but he has dazzled  your vision with his riches and his pretended grandeur&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go away now, please, Andrew. I am  going back to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s eyes opened wide, and,  unable to disregard their command, Remsen did go away and Renny did go back to  the house.</p>
<p>She walked slowly anticipating the  joy awaiting her. She knew that her brother and sister-in-law favored the rich  and important Nicholas Talbot, only lately come to live in the Gardens.</p>
<p>Renny had not liked the man at  first, but his immediate interest in her and his whirlwind wooing which quite  took her off her feet, had caused her to realize his masterful nature and soon  convinced her of his desirableness as a husband.</p>
<p>He had an appointment with Byron  that afternoon, and Renny had divined that she would be the subject of their  conversation.</p>
<p>She walked on, under the trees,  and as her thoughts wandered to Drew Remsen, she wondered if she had been  unfair to him. True, there had never been a spoken vow between them, but she  well knew that if Talbot had not made his devastating entrance into her life,  she would soon have been Remsen&rsquo;s affianced bride</p>
<p>She was sorry for Drew, he was  such a big, splendid thing, but Nick Talbot&rsquo;s audacious qualities and a certain  power of ascendancy which he invincibly possessed, quite overshadowed the tacit  claims of the younger suitor.</p>
<p>Renny was a dear, but she was  ambitious. Many of her intimates were working desperately though secretly to  secure Nick Talbot as a permanent possession, but Renny had made no effort,  felt no longings, yet the prize had fallen into her lap.</p>
<p>Talbot was twice her age. Renny  well knew that <i>Who&rsquo;s Who</i> declared him forty, which, some ill-natured people  said, was not entirely accurate.</p>
<p>A sudden mental picture of Drew&rsquo;s  happy youthful face, and careless graceful manner gave her a moment&rsquo;s pause,  then, with wide open eyes, she went on to meet her fate.</p>
<p>The house was prodigally supplied  with porches and verandas, and Renny walked half way round it before she saw  her brother and Talbot sitting in a vineclad portico, evidently in amity and  regaling themselves with the offerings of a small portable bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the girl,&rdquo; cried Byron, as  both men rose to greet her, and Renny, quite aware of her own importance,  accepted their attentions and let her eyes carry to Talbot a message which was,  to say the least, beguiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man,&rdquo; Byron began, jocosely,  &ldquo;this man, Renny, wants to steal from me my little sister! What do you think  about that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny was no Victorian miss, and  she said, looking frankly at Talbot, &ldquo;I think it would be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brick!&rdquo; exclaimed the suitor,  &ldquo;I like your straightforward ways! We&rsquo;ll leave the matter of affectionate  endearments until we can be alone. You give me your hand and heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out his hand and Renny  laid hers in it, without affectation but with a pretty old-time grace.</p>
<p>Talbot was enchanted. He was old  enough to object to ultra-modern ways and though up-to-date, he had little  sympathy with slang and bad manners.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s forty years had been  busy ones. He had been through the grind of business, the vicissitudes of  fortune, the gratification of success, the freedom of action and the enjoyment  of pleasure. He was highly educated, widely read and had traveled extensively.</p>
<p>And now, he had no notion of  settling down to a quiet life. But a new interest had come to him, a sudden  infatuation for that wisp of femininity, that wayward, winsome slip of a girl  called Renny! Of all ridiculous names surely the worst!</p>
<p>Christine made her appearance,  amenities were spoken and all was merry as the prospective marriage bell.</p>
<p>Talbot once called the girl Renee,  but she made a face at him, and he did not do it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  Love&rsquo;s Young Dream</b></h2>
<p>After Talbot had gone away the  Lorings held a jubilee.</p>
<p>That is, the two older members of  the family were jubilant, but Renny was not, noticeably, in gay mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear child!&rdquo; Christine  exclaimed, embracing the girl with fervor.</p>
<p>But Renny opened her eyes wide,  and Christine knew that she must step warily, for it was not easy to pull the  wool over those acutely perspicacious orbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; the mocking voice  agreed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a dear child, now that I have contracted a brilliant alliance&mdash; I  think that is the phrase. And you ought to be grateful, for I did it for you. I  know you want me off your hands, you and Byron both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Byron made no contradiction and  said only, &ldquo;Yes, you are a handful, and I willingly turn my charge over to  Talbot. He is a first class chap, and I don&rsquo;t see how you ever caught him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t! He caught me, and I&rsquo;m  not at all sure that I&rsquo;ll stay caught.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will. You can&rsquo;t fool us,  Renny, you&rsquo;re as much elated as we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Byron, he&rsquo;s so old&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, girl, don&rsquo;t be silly!  He&rsquo;s just forty, and that&rsquo;s far from old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfect age,&rdquo; Christine  said, not remarking that neither she nor her husband had yet reached thirty. &ldquo;I  do hope you&rsquo;re not maudling after that Remsen boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Byron laughed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t call that stunning  looking and perfectly poised young giant a boy! But, Renny, dear, he is far  from&mdash;er&mdash;plethoric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know&mdash;&rdquo; Renny said,  quickly, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t worry, Christine, I&rsquo;ve already forgotten the boy you speak  of. I am going to marry the nabob, and with all his worldly goods he will me  endow. Where do you suppose we shall live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever you like, of course,&rdquo;  Christine assured her. &ldquo;But make your plans ahead. Tell him at once where you  want to live and what you want to do. It may not be quite so easy to dictate  later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all those things,  Christine, and I&rsquo;ve decided most of them already. You see, he owns some of the  stately homes of England, and when the war is over, we&rsquo;ll go there. He wants to  take the Van Pelt house, here in the Gardens, till we decide where to build.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odzookums! Renny, you have struck  it rich! I&rsquo;m proud to be your brother! You&rsquo;re a real Cinderella!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Nick doesn&rsquo;t  look a bit like a prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Princes aren&rsquo;t always young  fellows. He seems very princely to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Christine, but you are  not marrying him. You wouldn&rsquo;t have taken Byron if he had been twice your age!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you feel so strongly about  it,&rdquo; Byron said, &ldquo;give it up, Renny. You are not married yet. An engagement can  be broken. Say the word, and I&rsquo;ll tell Talbot the crushing news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ll do nothing of the  sort. I went into this thing with my eyes open, and I&rsquo;ll carry it through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall you be married soon?&rdquo; asked  Christine, who was beginning to feel a little in awe of this new Renny, who was  so decided in her decisions and opinions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t care  much. I want to have a pretty wedding. I&rsquo;d like it out of doors, but that would  mean waiting till next summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; Byron  cried, &ldquo;you might lose him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance,&rdquo; and Renny smiled,  well knowing her powers of enchantment.</p>
<p>After dinner, Talbot presented  himself again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just came round to make sure the  lady hasn&rsquo;t changed her mind,&rdquo; he said gayly, as he entered the living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no,&rdquo; Christine helped  along. &ldquo;The lady thinks you are her fairy prince, the hero of her dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, she doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Renny  contradicted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good sort, Nick, but you&rsquo;re too old for a fairy  prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, at all. Years have fallen  from me, since I&rsquo;ve known you. Better be careful lest I return to childhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny almost said something about  second childhood, but she knew her cues, and she looked at him and smiled, as  she murmured, &ldquo;Yes, you speak truly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This charmed Talbot, and he bade  her come out with him to see the moon rise, and to hasten lest they be too  late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no moon tonight,&rdquo; said  Byron, after the two had left the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Christine agreed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in  apogee or perihelion or something. I like that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right, I think,&rdquo; Byron  spoke soberly, &ldquo;but there are hints of his lurid past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Renny insists, he is not  young, and what can you expect of a millionaire&rsquo;s past?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found nothing very dreadful,  so far. I shall have a straightforward talk with him, and I daresay he will  satisfy my stipulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, no! We don&rsquo;t have  settlements in this country. At least, I shan&rsquo;t ask for anything like that. But  I want to feel that Renny&rsquo;s interests are secure, whatever comes with time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a divorce some day,&rdquo;  Christine said, sapiently. &ldquo;Nick will be a good husband, but Renny won&rsquo;t stand  curbing. So, look ahead, when you talk business with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll probably be all right,&rdquo;  Byron told her, as he picked up his interrupted newspaper, &ldquo;and that young  Remsen is only a bank cashier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t heard the last of him  yet; I hope he&rsquo;ll let Renny alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll more likely be the other  way. If there&rsquo;s trouble there, Renny will be the one to make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only too true,&rdquo; came the sage  response.</p>
<p>Across the terraces and on to the  copse of conifers, went the betrothed pair.</p>
<p>Renny, for the first time in her  life, was a little at a loss how to begin conversation.</p>
<p>But it was all attended to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Talbot began, &ldquo;you have  accepted me but I have no right to accept you. I am too many years older than  you and that we can&rsquo;t change. But if you feel the least desire to be free of  your bondage, you have only to say the word and I will give you up. Renee, you  precious child, I love you with my whole heart, with my whole soul, and for that  very reason I will not hold you against your will. Do you want back your  troth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and no, again,&rdquo; she said,  purposely putting a delicious little tremor in her soft voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You perfect thing! My lovely&mdash;come  to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held open his arms, and Renny  took a step forward, and as he drew her to him, she heard a soft, happy little  sound in his throat, that was not a laugh, but a rapturous expression of his  bliss and hers.</p>
<p>It was an hour later that he took  her back to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your sister,&rdquo; he called out  to Byron. &ldquo;And what do you think? She says she&rsquo;ll stand by her promise, though  I felt it my duty to offer her freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, because of the discrepancy  in our ages, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter a bit,&rdquo; Renny  said, smiling. &ldquo;Mr Petersen is fifty and he was married last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talbot gave a low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I am glad  there is somebody I&rsquo;m not older than!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later on, the two men had a talk  regarding ways and means.</p>
<p>Byron discovered that his sister&rsquo;s  fiance was generous and kind in every way, and a firm friendship was begun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no family?&rdquo; Byron asked.  &ldquo;There is a man who lives with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Rudd. He is my confidential  secretary. But he is more than that, he is my adviser and assistant in many  ways, and he is my friend; if ever a man answered to the name of Fidus Achates,  it is Caleb Rudd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak highly of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He well deserves it. He has been  with me for nearly twenty years. We have lived in many countries, for I have  been a globe trotter, and of late we have lived in New York and Florida. I met  Renny in New York, that is why I came here for a stay at the Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have relatives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically none. A few distant  cousins, whom I almost never see. But I must tell you this. I have been  married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that. Have you told  Renny that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I want your advice about  it. It was long ago, when I was nineteen. I was appropriated by a wise and  wicked woman, three years older than I, who married me out of hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little. I wouldn&rsquo;t live with  her, of course, and my father took hold of the matter, bought her off, and  there was a definite and complete divorce. I never saw her again, and she died  within the year. I felt no desire to marry again, and never should have thought  of doing so if the little witch, your sister, hadn&rsquo;t taken me captive. She  didn&rsquo;t know she was doing that, bless her heart, but I am her willing slave,  and I can&rsquo;t quite believe yet the joy that has come to me. But don&rsquo;t you think  we can spare her the distress of hearing the sordid story I have just told you?  Since you know about it, and know that it is all a bit of the dead past, may we  not let it remain buried and not bring it back to grieve Renny&rsquo;s pure soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not entirely unversed in  the ways of the world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know the wide  knowledge young people possess today. But general knowledge of that sort  affects them but slightly, whereas if it had to do with those they love, it  might prove a thorn in the flesh. I will take your advice, but I think we should  protect her from any possible blot or blur on her happiness at this time. And  she is happy; she does love me. I learned that tonight, in the short time we  were alone. Why introduce a jarring note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Talbot. It shall be  a sealed book so far as she is concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let it be so. My act was the  foolishness of extreme youth, coerced by the evil spirit of a blase world-worn  woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will consider it all past  history. You will tell me all, names and full details, and&mdash;it shall never be  learned from my lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, old chap. Now as to  the wedding. If Renny agrees, I&rsquo;d like to be married this fall and take a run  down to Mexico. There are so few places now available for honeymoons, and Renny  has never seen Mexico. Then we would come back and plan to build a house here,  keeping my apartment in New York also. All this subject to Renny&rsquo;s wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good to me. You fix it up  with her, and I&rsquo;ll stand by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus was Renny&rsquo;s future agreed  upon by those who held her destiny in their hands, or thought they did.</p>
<p>The next day Talbot came over to  take Renny to see the Van Pelt house.</p>
<p>It seemed to the Lorings, all  three of them, that the man had changed a trifle in his demeanor. Whereas, the  night before, his manner had shown a hint of the suppliant, he now seemed to  dominate the situation.</p>
<p>Without any dictatorial air or any  effect of managing, he had everything his own way and made arrangements  himself.</p>
<p>A tall, well set up man was Nick  Talbot, always perfectly dressed, and with perfect manner. Never making himself  prominent, he was yet never negligible, and wherever he went, it was known that  he was there.</p>
<p>It was his definitive way that  made him a power. He announced his plans, large or small, and then proceeded at  once to carry them out, and others, unquestioningly fell into line.</p>
<p>His deep-set dark eyes, under  heavy brows, had a compelling force of their own, and though the man had seemed  pliant the night before, he was now suavely indicating his wishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I, Renny darling,&rdquo; he  said, gently, &ldquo;will go a little ahead, and have a glimpse of the place by  ourselves. Then Byron and Christine will follow shortly, and we will settle it  all this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tone seemed to forbid  objections, but no one had any to make, so the plan was tacitly accepted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little&mdash;instructive?&rdquo; Christine  said, after the two had left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he means to be  bossy, but he is in the habit of giving orders, I daresay. Nothing to cavil at,  and I am more than glad that Renny has done so well for herself. She seems very  happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superficially, yes,&rdquo; Christine  returned.</p>
<p>Talbot and Renny walked proudly  along the flowery paths of Banbury Gardens. The Van Pelt house was the largest  and most important of all the dwellings and Renny almost felt daunted at the  idea of commanding a home like that. Almost, but not quite. Wasn&rsquo;t she  achieving all her ambitions at once, and should she stagger at any greatness?  Assuredly not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the house,&rdquo; Talbot said to  her, you will meet a man named Rudd. He is my right hand man. Not a servant,  oh, no, but my confidential secretary and confidential friend. He lives with me  wherever I am, and should I ever lose him, I would be lost myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do I do with him?&rdquo; Renny  smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, except to be kind to  him. Let him see that you understand his position and do not look down upon  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I shall not look down  upon a friend of yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. And he is in all respects  worthy to be called a friend. You will not be thrown with him much, of course,  but I want you to understand him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went in the big house, and  Renny darted from one room to another, with little squeals of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nick,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;it is too  perfect! Do take this house, and never think of building another! It couldn&rsquo;t  be improved upon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house was fully furnished, but  they would be allowed to retain only what they wanted. </p>
<p>The owner, who had had to move to  California because of his wife&rsquo;s ill health was willing to sacrifice the house  on any terms.</p>
<p>Mrs Van Pelt had died, and her  husband wanted never to return to the home where he had lived so happily for a  long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s providential!&rdquo; Renny said,  as she heard the story. &ldquo;You must take it, Nick! It&rsquo;s just right and I shall be  very happy here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I want, my darling,  the house shall be yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to him, a little timidly,  and gave him the first unasked-for kiss he had yet had from her. And he thought  the great house but a small return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  The Marriage Tables</b></h2>
<p>Mr Caleb Rudd was introduced to  Renny.</p>
<p>Remembering Nick&rsquo;s request she  smiled prettily at the man, who gave her a kindly smile in return.</p>
<p>Rudd had a handsome face, which  always seemed about to break into a smile, if indeed, it were not already  smiling.</p>
<p>Thick, soft black hair, with a bit  of curl to it. Not large, but very black eyes, under strongly marked brows,  held a permanent twinkle, and looked at the world with a sideways gaze, that  combined irony and good nature. Had he chosen to wear the turned up moustache  and small imperial in which Franz Hals delighted, Rudd would have been a  perfect model for The Laughing Cavalier.</p>
<p>His face was round and though of  average height, he weighed more than he should have done. His excuse was that  he was fond of the pleasures of the table, and that, as he lived in dread of  his patron&rsquo;s dismissing him at any moment, he naturally made hay while the sun  was still shining.</p>
<p>The fear of Talbot&rsquo;s dismissal of  his invaluable aid, was the merest persiflage, and Nick only smiled when Rudd  thus explained his over-weight. And, too, the vigorous exercise of the gourmand  kept his weight within reasonable limits.</p>
<p>Not an athlete, but an expert at  swimming, fencing or dancing, a good tennis player and fine archer, Rudd held  his own in the Banbury Gardens Country Club.</p>
<p>He had lived with Talbot many  years, and there was yet to be one unpleasant word between them. Nick declared  he could not live with anyone, except in complete amity, and Rudd detested  petty bickerings.</p>
<p>Wherefore, Rudd gave his best  efforts to the management of the millionaire&rsquo;s estate, and Talbot paid him  gladly an enormous salary, happy in the knowledge that everything was attended  to concerning his financial affairs. Nor was Talbot ignorant of any point about  the accounts.</p>
<p>Rudd showed him the statements and  balance sheets and Nick scanned them rapidly and very knowingly. Never an  error, but now and then a matter to be discussed and decided by the clear  brains of the two men interested.</p>
<p>And they were chums as well as  friends. Not so much Damon and Pythias as two cronies of similar tastes, who  went their ways together or separately, as occasion called for. They had never  declared they would die for one another, indeed, each would have jibbed, had  such a thing been demanded.</p>
<p>Of course, Rudd knew all about  Nick&rsquo;s engagement, and he greeted Renny with his best show of bonhomie and  compliment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half my life gone with never a  glimpse of you,&rdquo; he bewailed; and then with a merry laugh, &ldquo;but God be praised,  I come of a long-lived family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Renny, &ldquo;I foresee  we shall be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, of course,&rdquo; Rudd looked  serious. &ldquo;But more than that, Miss Loring, I want you to feel that if ever you  need assistance, in any way, you must call on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are omnipotent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite that,&rdquo; Nick made the  answer, &ldquo;but, Renny, he is a tower of strength in any sort of trouble, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Nick Talbot!&rdquo; Renny&rsquo;s eyes  opened wide, &ldquo;do you mean to say that after I am married to you, there will be  any possibility that trouble of any sort can come near me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely!&rdquo; and unheeding Rudd&rsquo;s  presence, Talbot took the girl in his arms and soothed her pretended fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be embarrassed, Mr Rudd,&rdquo;  Renny said, managing to extricate her face from Nick&rsquo;s smothering embrace. &ldquo;You  know this demonstrative era won&rsquo;t last forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till death do us part,&rdquo; Talbot  declared, kissing her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, my children,&rdquo; and Rudd  raised his hands as in benison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means it, too,&rdquo; and Nick  nodded at his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perk up now,&rdquo; Rudd went on, &ldquo;I  see Miss Loring&rsquo;s relatives coming in the gate and we mustn&rsquo;t shock them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one who knows me is ever  shocked at anything I do,&rdquo; Renny said, composedly, and then Christine and Byron  came in.</p>
<p>Soon Rudd was showing them over  the house, Talbot detaining Renny by an advisory glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have an uncanny influence  over me,&rdquo; the girl said, as the others left them alone. &ldquo;I have never obeyed  anyone before in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never really belonged to  anyone before. I am your lord and master, and you are my submissive slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny looked up defiantly, but met  a glance and smile that conquered her independence and she flung herself into  his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick, you are a darling, and I  trust you with my life&rsquo;s happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to make your life&rsquo;s  happiness for you. You don&rsquo;t yet realize how happy you are going to be. Come  along now, and let us see what our prowlers are up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the others in the great  drawing room, and Christine was directing Rudd, who, with a yardstick was  making measurements and jotting down notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A marvelous house, Renny,&rdquo;  Christine said. &ldquo;But there must be a balcony in this ballroom. I can&rsquo;t  understand why there isn&rsquo;t one. But it can easily be arranged. Mr Rudd is  taking measurements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you ever so much,  Christine,&rdquo; Talbot said, taking Rudd&rsquo;s papers and putting them in a table  drawer. &ldquo;It shall be attended to. Now we&rsquo;re in conference, Byron, let&rsquo;s settle  on the date for the wedding. As Renny often reminds me, I am not a young man,  and naturally, I&rsquo;m afraid to wait too long, lest she throw me over entirely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sound argument,&rdquo; Renny approved.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll choose the day myself, and I say Christmas Day. That&rsquo;s three months away,  and Nick can&rsquo;t grow much older in three months, can he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall grow younger,&rdquo; Talbot  declared, &ldquo;that is if I don&rsquo;t die, waiting for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christine sighed. &ldquo;I wish our  house were larger, for the wedding,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t ask more than a  hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nelly Frome was married at the  Club House,&rdquo; Byron reminded them, suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; and Renny&rsquo;s  eyes flashed. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t at all suit my idea of the proper thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Talbot concurred.  &ldquo;She must be married from her home. If you want to wait until next summer,  dear, you can have the reception out on the lawn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Renny cried, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s do  that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick looked amazed. He had not  expected this serious acceptance of his would-be jest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Renny,&rdquo; he said very  calmly, &ldquo;you would rather postpone the wedding altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny looked at him, her head on  one side, and she seemed to ponder. Then, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to do  that&mdash;I love you too much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to him and gave him her  hand. His face cleared and he smiled again.</p>
<p>Then there was much planning and  discussion of this and that and at last the three Lorings went home, quite  content with the outlook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a fine future before you,  Renny,&rdquo; her brother told her, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t muff the ball. But don&rsquo;t seem to  jump at a chance of postponing the wedding! Those bluffs sometimes prove  boomerangs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are older than I am, Byron,  but I am wiser than you. Don&rsquo;t tell me how to conduct my own love affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, saucebox. Now, as I am  giving you your wedding, I think I may tell you that I don&rsquo;t want you to invite  all of the Banbury Gardens residents. Have the house comfortably filled, but  not crammed. Get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but Christine will advise me  about those things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Christine fully intended to  direct the wedding from start to finish, in person, she smiled at Renny and  changed the subject.</p>
<p>There was much to be done. Renny&rsquo;s  trousseau had to be adequate to the high position she was to hold as Talbot&rsquo;s  wife.</p>
<p>She and Christine attended to all  these things without friction and Byron paid the bills without murmur.</p>
<p>Indeed, he paid them willingly,  and would have done so had they been even larger. For though he loved his  sister, and had done his best for her, she was a responsibility, and at times a  torment.</p>
<p>Renny had always been a problem  child, and her parents had been no more able to cope with her wilful ways than  had her brother. So he welcomed his coming freedom from her care and feeding,  and prayed that nothing might prevent the wedding.</p>
<p>Yet the prayer of another human  soul, not far away, was that the wedding might be prevented, and that soon.</p>
<p>Andrew Remsen rebelled at Fate.  Though not promised, he had looked upon Renny as his own present sweetheart and  future wife.</p>
<p>To be thrown over for the sake of  Talbot&rsquo;s wealth and prestige had enraged him against both the man and the girl.</p>
<p>So furious he was with Renny that  he made no effort to see her for many days. Then his longing overcame him, and  wandering by the Loring place, and seeing her in the hammock under the trees,  he could stay away no longer so he leaped the hedge and stood before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Drew,&rdquo; she said, in an indifferent  tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Ren. Get up out of that  thing, I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little more persuasion is  needed,&rdquo; and Renny turned her eyes back to the book she held. </p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have it,&rdquo; and Andrew  Remsen lifted her bodily from the hammock and stood her on her feet, as if she  had been a doll.</p>
<p>She said nothing, but began to  smooth down her crumpled ruffles.</p>
<p>He watched her, and at last she  turned her eyes slowly toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;get it off  your chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be glad to,&rdquo; he said,  angrily, and then, softly, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t say what I am thinking, when you look  at me like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll say it for you,&rdquo; her  face hardened again. &ldquo;You want to tell me that I have treated you abominably.  But I have not. I was never engaged to you, I never told you I would marry you!  When Mr Talbot asked me to be his wife, I broke no faith with anyone by saying  yes. You have no right to blame me&mdash;it is nothing to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to me? When I have loved  you as long as I have known you? When I have lived in the hope that you would  one day be my wife&mdash;and now, now, in spite of all that has been between us, you  say I cannot blame you for turning to another man! I do blame you! You have  played wantonly with my love, and you toss it away as a thing of no value. I  cannot feel surprised, for I know how you worship money and publicity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; Renny&rsquo;s eyes blazed.  &ldquo;You go too far! I may have hurt your feelings but you shall not say I am a  fortune-hunter&mdash;a gold-digger! You did not use those words, but that is what you  meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is! It is exactly what I  meant; and it is true. If you are not marrying Talbot for his wealth and  prominence, what are you marrying him for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it does not occur to  you that I love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not! A man twice your  age, an old Lothario&mdash;&rdquo; Renny broke into laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly!&rdquo; she said,  quelling her merriment. &ldquo;But to call a man of Nick&rsquo;s talents and prestige such  names is only to make a fool of yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remsen knew that most of their  crowd would agree with her; he knew Talbot&rsquo;s standing and reputation; and he  knew that some stories he had heard about the man were entirely false. He  changed his tactics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind him, Renny. Think of  us&mdash;think of me. Don&rsquo;t you know how I love you? Don&rsquo;t you know I can&rsquo;t bear the  thought of losing you? Oh, Renny, stop! you must! I call you, my heart calls to  yours&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Drew, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do know! You know you don&rsquo;t  love him and you do love me, and you won&rsquo;t be any more than married to him  before you&rsquo;ll realize it, and then, then&mdash;it will be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s eyes were soft and  luminous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I do love you&mdash;maybe I love  you too much to marry you! You don&rsquo;t really want me&mdash; I am not a good sort. I am  fickle&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not fickle, not by a  damn&rsquo; sight! You love me with all your heart, but you want his money and you  want to share his popularity! You think that will make you happy&mdash;well, it  won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, you talk just like a  Sunday-school book. I can&rsquo;t help thinking that I am the one to judge what will  make me happy. Nor is it strange that I shall expect happiness with Nick  Talbot. I know something of his love-making, and with him it is an art. I can&rsquo;t  say that of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remsen was white with fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you explain what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. You know how to kiss a  girl, and that&rsquo;s about all. There are finer points. Perhaps you couldn&rsquo;t even  understand them. Here is one. Endurance makes a lover. Don&rsquo;t look supercilious.  You probably think you have endured enough. But this is what I mean. Yesterday,  in the car, he held my hand for nearly an hour, without fidgeting or letting  go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have been cramped when  it was over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. We weren&rsquo;t at  all. His clasp was so leisurely, so natural, so happy, that it was easier not  to move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t. You never could  understand. You would have had to point out something, or feel for your  handkerchief or scratch your neck or point to something by the roadside&mdash;what&rsquo;s  the use, Drew, you don&rsquo;t get it, and you can&rsquo;t. In a thousand ways like that,  love-making becomes an art, and you know nothing of art. You do not even  interest me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. You love me  and you will yet be mine&mdash;not his! Remember that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not love you, Drew. If I  ever have, or if I ever thought I did, you have killed it by the way you are  talking now. Can I love a man who tries to bully me into it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can and you do. Here&rsquo;s the  proof. If Talbot were to lose all his wealth over night, if tomorrow found him  penniless and in debt, would you marry him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only a moment Renny hesitated, and  then said, while her face turned scarlet, &ldquo;Of course I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie and you know you lie. But  I shall yet make you mine. When is this sale of a good girl to a bad man going  to come off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply to this, and  Drew said, more gently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is the wedding to be,  Renny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Christmas Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s lots of time between  now and then for something to happen to prevent it! I shall pray for the  happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Remsen laughed and leaped the  gate and was gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  A Mexican Honeymoon</b></h2>
<p>Notwithstanding Andrew Remsen&rsquo;s  prayers, nothing happened to prevent or delay the wedding of Renny and Nick on  Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Under Christine&rsquo;s generalship the  occasion was both smart and delightful.</p>
<p>The house and its enclosed  verandas were crowded, the decorations of Christmas holly and bridal lilies  were entirely harmonious, the orchestra was a famous one and the feast  Lucullan.</p>
<p>Andrew Remsen stayed away from the  festivities, but Renny was too busy with guests and reporters and photographers  to lament his absence.</p>
<p>And then the married pair were  whisked off to New York, and next day took a plane to Mexico, the land of  sunshine and flowers. Reaching Mexico City about noon on Thursday, they went at  once to the Hotel Maximo, where a suite was engaged for them.</p>
<p>Caleb Rudd was with them, for  Talbot never stirred a step from his own door without his shadow. Yet the  shadow possessed almost magic powers of knowing when to absent himself and  could appear and disappear with the surprising skill of a magician&rsquo;s rabbit.</p>
<p>Renny had no objection whatever to  Rudd&rsquo;s presence on their wedding trip, for the fact that she was a bride was  lost sight of by her in the more wonderful realization that she was free. Free  from censure by her brother and his wife; free to have her own sweet way in  everything.</p>
<p>Too, she remembered, she had the  adoration of a prince among men, unlimited spending money and the world at her  feet. For, already she had read admiration in the glances cast upon her by both  visitors and natives of this fascinating joy-offering land.</p>
<p>And Talbot was an adorable lover.  A bit too insistent, now and then, but laughing Renny learned to evade his  over-frequent caresses without offending him.</p>
<p>Caleb Rudd kept unnoticed watch,  and shook a dubious head.</p>
<p>But most of their time was spent  in visiting places or scenes of Renny&rsquo;s choosing. Each morning a few moments  spent with a descriptive folder resulted in a trip, long or short, easy or  tiresome, as she decreed.</p>
<p>Sometimes Rudd would go along,  sometimes not; sometimes there would be a party, for they made a few  acquaintances.</p>
<p>After a fortnight, Nick rebelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renny,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are on a  honeymoon, not a tour. You rush around to all these places just like a tourist,  bound to see everything in the guide-book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; and Renny opened her  eyes at him. &ldquo;Look here! This is a quotation from Will Rogers on a folder.  &lsquo;Quaint Mexicana! There is more quaintness and different things to see in  Mexico than in the whole of Europe!&rsquo; And I propose to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say quaint! I detest the  word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a young lady&rsquo;s tea  room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re silly! I just guess  Will Rogers knew what words to use! But of course when he said that, he was a  much younger man than you are now. I don&rsquo;t want to wear you out, if you&rsquo;d  rather stay quietly here, I can go by myself. But I have to see the Pyramids  and the Cathedral and the Floating Gardens, and a fiesta and a bull-fight&mdash;oh,  and Nick, darling, I must go to Oaxaca!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you must go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you said you were glad to  know there is something living that is older than you, and, at Oaxaca there is  a tree that is the oldest living thing in the world! It was three thousand  years old when Christ was born, and so it&rsquo;s very old by now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renny,&rdquo; and Talbot&rsquo;s voice was  stern, &ldquo;one more whack from you about my advancing years, and you shall be put  in durance vile, if you know what that is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and she went on  munching her Mexican sweetmeats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that you shall not step  outside this hotel until we start for home. You shall go to see no sights, hear  no music, watch no dances, but stay in these rooms a prisoner&mdash;with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny was a little frightened, for  Nick had sounded very much in earnest, and she had ragged him unmercifully  about his age. But she saw a way out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed, as if saved by  grace, &ldquo;with you! Then I shouldn&rsquo;t mind any prison! You frightened me! I  thought you meant to shut me up alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It worked very well. Her  infatuated husband gathered her into his arms and asked her where she wanted  him to take her first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoping I intrude,&rdquo; said a quiet  voice, and Rudd came into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t intrude,&rdquo; Nick told  him, smiling at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you love Mr Rudd so much?&rdquo;  Renny asked, curiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s so great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes you do, but you feel you  must dissemble. And anyway, &ldquo;Rudd went on, &ldquo;I have reason enough to love Nick,  but he has small reason to love me. It&rsquo;s a case of Mary and the lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Talbot spoke seriously.  &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s fifty-fifty. You see, I once had a chance to do a favor for Cale,  and ever since he has devoted his life to mine. Preposterous over-payment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve gone so far, we&rsquo;d  better finish.&rdquo; Rudd gave his friend a devoted smile. &ldquo;You see, Renny, the  favor that Nick did for me was to keep me out of prison.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you deserve prison?&rdquo; Renny  asked, coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said both men at once, and  then Talbot said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll finish the story. You see, Rudd was unjustly accused,  and it was so cleverly managed, that it was difficult to find out the truth.  But we found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found it,&rdquo; Rudd put in. &ldquo;If  you hadn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;d be languishing in prison now, and you&rsquo;d be feeding me through  the bars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the crime?&rdquo; Renny asked.  &ldquo;Was it murder? It always is in the stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. It was embezzlement,  on a large scale. The thief managed to make it look like Cale&rsquo;s work, and as  he was a clever thief, and had a clever accomplice, they did make it look  pretty black for my friend. But, you see, I knew Cale was not capable of such  wrong-doing, and I went to work to find the criminal, and I found him&mdash;that&rsquo;s  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all; you&rsquo;ve neglected to tell  of the trouble you had, of the dangers that threatened you. You ran the risk of  being arrested yourself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s past history now. I am  glad I could help you, and glad I did help you. And since then, you&rsquo;ve done  nothing but help me. Now, the amenities are settled, where shall we go today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the bull-fight!&rdquo; Renny said,  promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my child, you are not going  to any bull-fight at all. Such things are not for nice little girls&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a nice little girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re not! You&rsquo;re a  spoiled child. But whatever you are you&rsquo;re going to no bull-fight while you  belong to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much does it cost to get a  divorce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than you ever saw. But you  may go to a bull-baiting. They&rsquo;re much the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then that will do! And you&rsquo;re  a darling, you were just teasing me, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl-baiting, yes. Come on, then;  get into your togs and we&rsquo;ll go to market and buy things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s maid came, a handsome,  swarthy Mexican girl, with long dark eyes and long dark hair and a face that  showed how greedily the Mexicans grasped at the customs of the tourists.  Vermilion was daubed on her cheeks and lips, and on her finger-nails. Her  eyebrows were unnecessarily penciled, and her whole effect was exaggerated and  absurd.</p>
<p>Renny, herself exquisitely made  up, delighted in this flamboyant creature, and bought for her the gimcrack  earrings and bracelets in which she delighted. Her name was Anita and she adored  her vivacious young mistress.</p>
<p>Her amorous glances were wasted on  Nick but he couldn&rsquo;t help seeing her and sometimes smiled at her. Rudd  destested her and often hinted that Renny might better employ an American maid.</p>
<p>But Anita was deft and skillful,  and Renny had taken a fancy to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a picture!&rdquo; Nick said, as  Renny appeared, ready to start. &ldquo;The loveliest one in the world!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite that,&rdquo; Rudd put in, a  bit rudely. &ldquo;But picturesque in a charming way. You know how to dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo; Renny said,  complacently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take advice from anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wore a tailored white silk  suit, and a broad white Panama hat. For her no native headgear, and no string  bag. Though scouring the market from end to end she was never of it, she was  aloof, apart.</p>
<p>Like a butterfly she went from one  vender to another, always hoping yet seldom finding anything she cared to buy.  Everything was offered her, from masks to sandals, from pigs to postcards, from  beads to blankets, but the most persistent vender could be hushed when Renny  opened her eyes at him.</p>
<p>Both Nick and Rudd laughed in glee  to see her dart from one pile of goods to another, buy something, and hurry on,  leaving them to pay for it and send it to the hotel.</p>
<p>She bought filigree trinkets for  Anita, some bright scarves for herself, paused for a few chances at a gaming  table, and then made for the merry-go-round. She sprang on one of the moving  animals, a bull, and whirled round to the wails of a calliope.</p>
<p>Then, dismounting she told Nick  she was ready to go to see the bull-baiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For that, there must be a  Fiesta,&rdquo; Nick said, idly gazing at her.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the  third week of their honeymoon. The first week had been a time of bewilderment  for Renny. She could not understand. She had to get accustomed to so much. The  second week she was a little cowed. Nick, while her devoted slave, was also her  lord and master, and she had to realize it.</p>
<p>Now, in the third week, she was no  longer bewildered or cowed but she was far from being entirely happy. She was  indulged, spoiled and petted, but there was something missing. Something that  she had expected but which hadn&rsquo;t as yet materialized.</p>
<p>One day, in Nick&rsquo;s absence, Rudd  taxed her with this. She said, suddenly, &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo; and then,  recovering herself, she opened her eyes wide at him, and left the room.</p>
<p>He never asked again, but she  thought he was a little more gentle with her, a little less outspoken.</p>
<p>Now, in answer to Nick, he said,  &ldquo;There is always a Fiesta somewhere. Not a big one, but always a little local  affair. Shall I make discovery of same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I think I saw a notice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; Renny broke in. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s  one in Tuxedo &mdash;a good one. Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny called all Mexican towns  Tuxedo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;they  mostly begin with T, and they all have an x in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudd, being all-powerful,  discovered a Fiesta not far away, and they started off at once. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a play!&rdquo; exclaimed  Renny as they reached the place. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see a play&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t  understand a word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to have the play first,&rdquo;  Rudd told her. &ldquo;And you must see it. It&rsquo;s the old historical show, you know,  Moors and Christians. You&rsquo;ll like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Renny didn&rsquo;t like it. The  Moors were rigged out in sort of bloomer garments, of lovely pale colors, with  lace ruffles at the knees. They had high paper helmets and gay colored scarves,  of which Renny coveted each and every one. She adored scarves and had collected  dozens already.</p>
<p>The Christians wore short white  dresses with blue ribbon bows. Their paper crowns were decorated with blue  feathers and every actor carried a machete.</p>
<p>The musicians played some  execrable music as the dancers marched around and sang. Then a pink and blue  saint, with big wings and a wig made prophecies and Pilate and Santiago  flourished their brave weapons in a sort of dancing sword play.</p>
<p>It did seem rather silly and Renny  was bored.</p>
<p>Then came the bull-baiting and she  waked up a little. It was not at all like a bull-fight, but merely some rough  riding at a young bull.</p>
<p>The toros, in pink and blue and  lavender shirts teased the bull a little and at last one of them coiled a rope  and threw him. The others came up and had some sport with the not  over-interested animal, who would then run off and be replaced by another bull.</p>
<p>The audience applauded and howled,  but there was little real enthusiasm, and suddenly Nick realized that Renny was  not by his side.</p>
<p>They had not been able to get  seats all together, and he thought she had gone over to sit by Rudd. He didn&rsquo;t  like it and went after her.</p>
<p>But Rudd sat alone, and said he  thought Renny was with Nick.</p>
<p>The two men were alarmed. There  was no telling what Renny had done or might do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place isn&rsquo;t dangerous,&rdquo; Rudd  said, thoughtfully. &ldquo;The people are all in holiday humor and Renny is quite  capable of taking care of herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in Mexico,&rdquo; Nick declared,  and his voice shook.</p>
<p>Rudd gave him a glance and then  said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find her,&rdquo; in his most matter-of-fact way.</p>
<p>Their search was determined and  forceful, but not encouraging. Everybody was interested and polite and would-be  helpful, but there was no definite way to look. The authorities were  unattainable and the guardians of the peace were lost in the crowds of  merrymakers. The Fiesta was at its height, and the heights of Fiestas are not  safety zones.</p>
<p>Talbot was beside himself.  Accustomed to have things go the way he directed, it always angered him to have  anything mar his plans.</p>
<p>And he feared for Renny. He  scorned Rudd&rsquo;s assurance that her dignity and self-possession would bring her  safely through. </p>
<p>At last his fear for the girl  overcame all else and he lost his fierce anger and seemed to collapse in a  conviction that Renny was lost to him forever.</p>
<p>Rudd took the helm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down there,&rdquo; he said,  sternly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move from that seat until I return. I will find Renny, I will  bring her back in safety, only&mdash;if you will promise me to let nothing tempt you  or force you to leave that chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick would not agree until Rudd  had sat himself down with the vow that he would not seek Renny unless the  promise he asked should be made.</p>
<p>At last Talbot yielded, he made  the promise and Rudd knew he would keep it.</p>
<p>But as the searcher started on his  quest, he knew not which way to turn or how to proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  Renny Sees The Bull Fight</b></h2>
<p>It was in their suite at the Hotel  Maximo that Rudd had left Talbot with orders to stay there, and Nick had no  inclination to disobey.</p>
<p>He had searched with Rudd for the  girl, and he was convinced that he had hampered rather than helped Rudd&rsquo;s  progress. In fact, Rudd had told him so, and now Talbot was content to sit and  wait, at least for a time. How long he would stay put he did not know.</p>
<p>Caleb Rudd was an amazingly clever  man. But he well knew that the situation was alarming. He felt entirely certain  that Renny had disappeared of her own volition, and he did not fear that she  was in any danger. But unless she was found, danger might come to her, and too,  he feared for his friend. Talbot was already on the verge of a nervous  breakdown yet he was unwilling to have the matter taken to the police. Renny  was, in all probability, safe and sound in some out of the way place she had  desired to visit. Never would it occur to her that her absence would cause  trouble or grief. She thought of no one but herself, of no one&rsquo;s happiness but  her own. </p>
<p>But these facts did not help Rudd.  Nor did he walk about the streets and the markets aimlessly. He tried to  deduce, like any detective, where Renny would go, but no inspiration came to  his aid. He was a clever man, he had a fine brain and a splendid education. But  hunting for a missing lady was outside his experience. He did not despair, he  had often accomplished what had seemed the impossible. And he would do anything  for Nick.</p>
<p>Their friendship was ideal. Not at  all emotional, rarely was a word of affection spoken between them; but each  knew, beyond all doubt, that the other would never fail him, never disappoint  him in the least particular, and their mutual loyalty could be trusted to the last  degree.</p>
<p>No faintest notion entered Nick&rsquo;s  head that Rudd would ever take any undue interest in Renny, and no ghost of an  idea occurred to Rudd to do such a thing. He looked on Nick&rsquo;s wife as no  concern of his, and while he did not greatly admire her, he thought her a  pretty plaything, and he now devoted all his efforts to the finding of the  girl.</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s departure from her  husband&rsquo;s side had not been spectacular, nor had she found it difficult to  accomplish her purpose.</p>
<p>She had sat a long time at the play  of the Moors and Christians. The acting was execrable, and the whole movement  slow and tiresome. Two or three times Renny had left her seat and gone outside  for an orange or a sweet lime or an ice. She always returned in a few moments,  refreshed and smiling, and Nick thought she was enjoying herself.</p>
<p>And she was.</p>
<p>There was a big handsome man in  the row behind them, and once or twice he made bold to smile at her as she  looked around,&mdash;and Renny was always looking around. Nick was getting used to  her restlessness and only laughed at it.</p>
<p>The next time, Renny smiled back  at the handsome face, and was greatly surprised at what followed.</p>
<p>Of his costume she could see  clearly only his hat, a sombrero of rose-hued felt, heavy with silver lace, and  a glimpse of a fringed leather jacket.</p>
<p>The thick black eyebrows lifted  and the black eyes darted a meaning glance. The meaning was not hard to grasp,  and the glance was luring and imperative.</p>
<p>Renny took no second thought. A  quick look at Nick showed him rapt in his attention to the play, which had  reached its only approach to a thrill, and she slid out and away, noiselessly,  without his notice.</p>
<p>Unhurriedly, she left the  building, and found herself in the crowded street, the handsome stranger at her  side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure was I you come,&rdquo; he  whispered, as he clasped her elbow protectively, for the crowd was jostling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come to see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;that, of course. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? How dare you speak  to me?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Dare? When your eyes called to  me! When your eyes said, &lsquo;I will that we meet&mdash;now!&rsquo; That your message was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a Mexican?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. But I speak the English.  And note, I do not say, &lsquo;I spik Inglese&rsquo;! I do not talk pigeon. It is my way  not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mix up your sentence forms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now and then. It makes nothing.  Come, tell me, why are you ever and ever with the old one&mdash;or the other old one?  Are they your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget them! I just ran out a  minute for a breath of air. I am sick of Moors and Christians both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But well I know what you want.  You want to go to see the bull-fight. I will take you. With me you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, let us be gay. The Old Two,  they will not that you go. Must you be tyrannized then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid I must. And now I must go  back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not, oh, not that. Look you,  Lady, you want see bull-fight. This your one chance, your only chance. You go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether it was the realization  that here was her last chance, or whether it was the hypnotic power of the deep  set eyes, black but luminous that made her do it, Renny said, &ldquo;I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well. Will he kill you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. How do we go? Where is  it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the smallest distance. We go  in the most little car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s at Tuxedo, I suppose. Every  place is Tuxpan or Tixtla&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or Tlaxcala or Taxco or Texcoco&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or Texcola or Taxicabbia. Come  on, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you hasten. But we start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny never did learn his name.  For some unknown reason she chose to call him Bartolo, and he made no  objection.</p>
<p>The girl was in throes of delight.  She had won her point, she was having her way and nothing could stop her now.  She by no means forgot or evaded the knowledge that the hour of reckoning must  come. She knew that she would go back to Talbot, and that the occasion would be  something like an unprotected Daniel stepping into the lions&rsquo; den. She knew  that cajolery and blandishment would avail her nothing and just what would  happen she could form no idea. Nor did she try.</p>
<p>She did not even feel that Rudd  could get her out of this scrape, as he often did. But her thoughts were  interrupted by Bartolo, saying, &ldquo;We are here. Will you alight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her first impression was that of  disappointment. The scene was little different from all the others, and there  was no more grandeur or gayety than elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the ring,&rdquo; he told her,  &ldquo;where the bull-fight will be made. I will get good seats.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Seats were nearly all gone and at  a premium, but Bartolo&rsquo;s capability and experience were successful, and their  seats were of the best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I give you some money?&rdquo;  Renny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, in a  matter-of-fact way. &ldquo;You will pay the expenses and after it is over, you will  give me what small guerdon you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the Fiesta, as with all  shows in Mexico, the key word was delay. There was one long wait after another,  separated only by brief and not very interesting dances. Renny grew tired of it  all, and fell into conversation with her picked up cavalier. But that soon  palled, for it was plain to be seen that his only interest lay in the line of  amorous hints and suggestive glances. These Renny nipped in the bud, and the  way she opened her eyes at him quelled his advances, at least for a time.</p>
<p>As her wide open eyes began to  startle him less each time, the bull-fight at last got started.</p>
<p>To Renny&rsquo;s disappointment it  seemed to her commonplace.</p>
<p>A bull was turned into the arena,  and allowed himself to be assailed by the lancers, who were on horseback. These  were called picadores, but seemed pale beside Renny&rsquo;s already pictured  imagination.</p>
<p>Then came the banderillos who  plunged into the bull&rsquo;s hide darts with fireworks and flags attached to them.  These Renny thought silly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the toreadors!&rdquo; she  cried. &ldquo;Like those in the opera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not toreadors more,&rdquo; Bartolo  explained. &ldquo;Matadors now. Here now they be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the matadors with their long  straight swords and long sticks, with bits of red silk attached, were far from  fulfilling Renny&rsquo;s vivid flights of fancy.</p>
<p>At the actual death of the animal,  she hid her face in her scarf and demanded to be taken home at once.</p>
<p>Even Nick&rsquo;s rage&mdash;and subsequent  making up&mdash; would be better than this stupid show.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t really a top drawer  performance.</p>
<p>But it was the best Bartolo could  do. He had tried for a better one but this third class affair was the only one  available, and he thought Renny would not know the difference.</p>
<p>And too, he had thought the girl  would prove more amenable to his tender glances, to his low voiced suggestions.  The game was scarcely worth the candle with a haughty beauty who opened her  eyes wide at meaning looks from his amorous eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all rot,&rdquo; said Renny, at  last. &ldquo;I go home now. Take me to the Hotel Maximo, at once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t do, my Lady,&rdquo; Bartolo  drawled, his insolent eyes smiling at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? How dare you question my  orders? To the hotel, this very minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, pretty one; we are going  to the dance hall.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Renny opened her eyes very wide  and stamped her foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we are not! You are to take  me home this minute, or I go by myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bartolo laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go by yourself! You court  disaster? You wish destruction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can take care of myself. I am  in no danger.&rdquo; This was sheer bravado as Renny was more frightened than she had  ever been in her life. But thought to bluff it through.</p>
<p>Bartolo spoke gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be the little fool. I will  direct. We go first to an eating-booth. You are famished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not! And I will not eat with  you. Take me home, my husband will pay you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will he&mdash;when he gets the  chance. Not eat? Then we will drink. We will have pulque&mdash;much pulque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even more than the words the man&rsquo;s  blazing eyes frightened Renny, and she was desperate.</p>
<p>She chanced to be holding in her  hand a necklace of glass beads she had bought for Anita, and the beads were not  round, but sharply pointed and thin. She flung the trinket full into Bartolo&rsquo;s  face, with all the force she could command, and then she ran as fast as she  could fly.</p>
<p>A pair of strong arms caught her,  and she found herself in the grasp of Caleb Rudd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; she moaned, her  fierceness all gone, &ldquo;take me home, take care of me&mdash;this place is terrible!&rdquo;  Rudd called a cab, and in a moment they were rolling toward the hotel.</p>
<p>Not a word was spoken, and Renny&rsquo;s  quick glances showed her a strange face beside her. Rudd had never looked like  that before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That place was terrible,&rdquo; she  repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will find the Hotel Maximo  more terrible, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick is furious, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is grave understatement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s spirits rose. She had  entire faith in her ability to quell Nick&rsquo;s fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; she said, petulantly,  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s his own fault. He wouldn&rsquo;t take me to see the bull-fight, and I was bound  to see it. It was a washout, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudd made no reply to this and  there was silence the rest of the way At the hotel steps Renny sprang out of  the cab, and leaving Rudd to settle with the man, she flew up to their  apartment. It was Renny&rsquo;s nature to face the worst and at once.</p>
<p>Smiling, she opened the door, and  ran to Nick, who stood in the middle of the room, flinging herself upon him.</p>
<p>But instead of a man she seemed to  strike a stone image.</p>
<p>Starting back from the rigid form,  she looked upon his face and screamed out in terror. His expression was that of  a madman, his eyes glared at her in flaming wrath and his ghastly white face  seemed that of a murderer.</p>
<p>Renny stepped back, with a feeling  of faintness, but she forced her pluck to the utmost, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe down, Nick, dear! Here I am,  all safe and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She never finished her sentence,  for he gave a sound like the growl of a wild beast, rushed at her, and grasped  her two wrists with wrenches that nearly broke them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you defy me!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;So  you dishonor me, you desert me, you dare to disobey me! Where have you been?  What disgrace have you brought upon me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudd appeared and answered this  question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has brought no disgrace on  you,&rdquo; he said, sternly. &ldquo;Renny was in danger, and by good fortune I happened to  be in time to save her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Renny said, taking Nick&rsquo;s  hand, &ldquo;Rudd came along just at the psychological moment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the room!&rdquo; said Talbot to  his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Rudd smiled, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t fire  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talbot spoke in a strange, almost  sepulchral voice, &ldquo;I have never before given you an order, Rudd, and I never  shall again. Leave the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudd went out, closing the door  after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Nick turned to Renny, &ldquo;and  mind you speak the truth,&mdash;where did you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny, having had time to think,  had decided on her course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to see the bull-fight,&rdquo;  she said, calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I ordered you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a Turk? Am I your slave?  Don&rsquo;t you dare take that attitude toward me! I am your wife and I obey you in  all reasonable matters, but when you deny me a simple pleasure, for no reason  whatever, I do not obey you. Remember that in future, Mr Nicholas Talbot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You have no  sense of honor; you know nothing of faith and loyalty&mdash;stand away, lest I treat  you as you deserve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick, dear, what do you mean by  this? Surely you are not in earnest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try me but one step farther, and  you will see whether I am in earnest or not! Keep your distance, or I cannot  control myself! You and Rudd. What were you doing down in the low places? No!  do not tell me, I know only too well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! I will not stand it! Mr  Rudd saved me from a most unpleasant interview with a Mexican ruffian. If you  want the truth, ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Back In Banbury Gardens</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Byron Loring to his  wife, as he folded up the letter and returned it to its envelope. &ldquo;Renny&rsquo;s  marriage has certainly turned out well. I half feared that she would resent  Talbot&rsquo;s dictatorship. Renny is not fond of being told what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor does she take it meekly from  Nick Talbot,&rdquo; Christine returned. &ldquo;You only read the girl&rsquo;s letters on the  surface, I see between the lines, and there is trouble coming to that precious  pair. You know, he reads every letter she sends us, and she has to be  discreet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has she to be discreet about?  She married him for his money, we all know that, but she is getting what she  wanted. He fairly loads her down with gifts, he lets her do whatever she  pleases,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renny is not the sentimental  sort. I know her better than you do, and love is not a dominant part of her  nature. The only rift in the lute that I feared was the ever present Rudd. Most  brides would object to a third party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t mind him a bit,&rdquo;  Christine declared, &ldquo;and he is so capable and tactful, he takes care of them  both. He worships Nick, and I think he likes Renny, though he sees through  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not hard to see through,  but I hope he doesn&rsquo;t advise or criticize my sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s not like that. He&rsquo;s  really Nick&rsquo;s body-servant, he does things that it would bother Nick to attend  to. I mean mind-servant, I think, for he writes Nick&rsquo;s letters, even personal  ones, and keeps his accounts and attends to all business matters. He directs  all the employees of the Talbot estate. I thought Rudd would object to Renny,  but he treats her like any other bit of valuable bric-a-brac that Nick might  bring home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely find a great deal  between the lines of the letters that come from Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is the power of the feminine  mind. Now, as the letter you hold tells you, they will be back here tomorrow,  and then you can judge for yourself how nearly right I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to see that the  house is opened up and ready for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Byron, don&rsquo;t you know our  friends the Talbots better than that! The house will be ready for them by the  orders of the omnipotent Rudd, and I think likely that personage came today to  be sure that all is well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re clairvoyant, Christine,  and I think you are probably right. I admit I&rsquo;m ashamed of myself to say it,  but I am glad that my small sister is going to her own palatial abode and not  coming here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you ought to be ashamed, but  we must remember that she is happier to go there than to come here. Renny is a  dear child, but hard to live with, and I ought to know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be changed a bit after  four weeks in Mexico. Think she&rsquo;ll be the Grand Lady of Banbury Gardens?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she will. And she can  carry it off. Her dinner parties will be superb. Wonder what part Drew Remsen  will play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Remsen; he&rsquo;s forgotten Renny  and he&rsquo;s all for Ruth Hanna now. I hear they are together all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth Hanna! If so, then he&rsquo;s just  trying her out as the opposite of Renny. There couldn&rsquo;t be two girls more  different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How different? They look much  alike to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Byron, you are too absurd. Renny  is the smartest, trickiest little rascal that ever breathed. Ruth Hanna is good  and noble and all that, but she is dull as ditch-water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has that Madonna type of  face, that is very lovely to look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It so happened that at that very  moment Andrew Remsen was looking at Ruth Hanna&rsquo;s face and thinking that it was  very lovely to look at.</p>
<p>He had taken her home from a dance  and had gone into the house with her and they stood in the dimly lighted hall  to say good night.</p>
<p>It was a Madonna face that looked  out at him from the folds of a hooded cape, of the blue color that the old  painters loved.</p>
<p>Azure eyes looked up at him, and a  soft voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you could come in  with me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you,&rdquo; he said,  watching her little smile in reply.</p>
<p>And then, pushing the hood back  from the tousled gold curls, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am going to ask you  something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Ruth whispered, &ldquo;oh,  don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly child, you don&rsquo;t even know  what I want! Well, I want you&mdash;all for my very own&mdash;say yes, Ruth, darling, say  yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was in his arms now, her head  lay on his breast, and her eyes were closed.</p>
<p>Remsen was at a loss to grasp her  meaning. Did she mean yes, or didn&rsquo;t she?</p>
<p>But he had one rule for girls.  When in doubt, kiss her.</p>
<p>So he kissed her, and so  effectively that she opened her eyes, not wide, as Renny did, but just enough  to see him, and she said, as was to be expected, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Getting her meaning,  he kissed her again, and then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now are you ready to say yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ruth said, shyly, and  Remsen was ashamed of himself that he wished there had been a little more  enthusiasm in her tone. </p>
<p>Again she hid her face in his  overcoat, which was far from a downy pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no place for us,&rdquo; he  said, gayly, and he led her into the library, closed the door and turned on the  light. Then he threw off his overcoat and divested her of her long blue cape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come to my arms  and let&rsquo;s get engaged properly. Will you marry me, dear? I love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth hadn&rsquo;t come to his arms but  he got her there, and then instead of nestling properly in his embrace, she  squirmed uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know your lines,  honey,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;this is where you tell me you love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will marry me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;how I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s a nice speech! And why  can&rsquo;t you, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s some fool reason. Tell  me at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Renny wouldn&rsquo;t like me  to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Drew expected to hear, it  was not that. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly!&rdquo; he said, and shook her a little. &ldquo;What on earth  has Renny got to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She made me promise not to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did!&rdquo; He was silent a moment  and then said, slowly, &ldquo;that must have been long ago, when she thought she  liked me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, forget it. Renny is joined  to her idol, let her alone. There&rsquo;s no one in the world, my Ruth, but just you  and me. Will you remember that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Drew; and now you go home.  If you haven&rsquo;t changed your mind, come round tomorrow night, and we&rsquo;ll talk  about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And shortly, Andrew Remsen was on  his way home, and Ruth Hanna sat down and cried.</p>
<p>The next day Renny came back from  Mexico.</p>
<p>They came by plane, and Rudd had  arranged to have Talbot&rsquo;s own car meet them in New York.</p>
<p>As the Lorings had surmised, Rudd  came up the day before, and everything was ready for the arrival of the  Talbots.</p>
<p>As the car came within a few  blocks of the house, Renny suddenly screamed to the chauffeur to stop, pulled  down the window and called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew! Oh, Drew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remsen looked and saw Renny&rsquo;s  little head out of the car window, and heard her imperative, &ldquo;Come here! Come  here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went, and with a cry of delight  she kissed him soundly, grasped both his hands and turned to Talbot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Nick, see! Here&rsquo;s old Drew!  Give him a shake and then we&rsquo;ll go on. How did you happen to be right here,  darling? I believe you were waiting for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Remsen?&rdquo; Nick  growled, and then said quickly, &ldquo;Go on, Mercer,&rdquo; to the chauffeur.</p>
<p>Rudd was waiting for them at the  house, or perhaps this contretemps might have been avoided, or, perhaps not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my Nixy,&rdquo; Renny said, her  eyes dancing, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not to scold your lawful wife just at the moment we reach  our home! I see your scoldy eyes&mdash;stop it now, and beam at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would have been a hard-hearted  husband who could have scolded Renny then. Her piquant little face glowed with  joy and she flung her arms round Nick&rsquo;s neck in a burst of real affection.</p>
<p>He recognized its worth, and his  anger at the Remsen chap was forgotten.</p>
<p>At the house, Byron and Christine  were awaiting them, and Rudd like a hovering angel, saw to it that everything  was as it should be.</p>
<p>Renny was in her element.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I, as a matron, Byron?&rdquo;  she asked, as she put on a dignified air for half a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so good,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;but I  hope you&rsquo;ll learn to do better. Not likely, though. A tomboy cannot be a  gracious hostess. Why did you ever marry her, Nick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She suits me,&rdquo; the bridegroom  said, &ldquo;her hostess gestures shall be what she chooses to make them, and her  guests will soon be trying to copy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nixy, what a lovely speech!&rdquo;  and Renny threw her arms round him; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t he perfect, Christine? There never  was such a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talbot, entirely unembarrassed,  was so happy at this burst of affection that he beamed like a Chessy cat.</p>
<p>The Lorings stayed for dinner, and  Renny diverted them all with her stories of Mexico and its delights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Mexico is overrated,&rdquo;  Rudd said. &ldquo;At least, it seemed to me a tawdry piece of business. Of course, to  people on a honeymoon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty true,&rdquo; Talbot  agreed. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d been there without Renny, I could have seen and admired the  whole place in forty-eight hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Including Anita?&rdquo; Renny smiled at  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Anita?&rdquo; asked Christine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick&rsquo;s maid,&rdquo; said Renny. &ldquo;Well,  that is, she was called my maid, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she was everybody&rsquo;s maid,&rdquo;  Rudd broke in. &ldquo;I declare that Mexican woman was as good as any valet I ever  saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a picture to look at,&rdquo; Renny  went on. &ldquo;Nick wanted to bring her home with us, but I knew she couldn&rsquo;t get  along with our sort of servants. But now I&rsquo;ve got used to having a maid, I must  get me one here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve engaged one for you,&rdquo; Rudd  said. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like her don&rsquo;t keep her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the First Gold-Stick in  Waiting!&rdquo; Renny exclaimed, but she gave him no further thanks. Rudd was to the  Talbots not a man but an institution. He and Nick were friends but they were  not mentally congenial, for Rudd had little education and no knowledge of  literature and the arts. Indeed, his life was just one never ceasing effort to  do anything he could for the man to whom he felt he owed so much. Rudd&rsquo;s idea  of his debt to Talbot may have been exaggerated, but it was sincere and was the  foundation stone of his whole character.</p>
<p>When Renny was brought into the  home, Rudd felt that he had now more ways to please his friend, and he  endeavored to serve or amuse her in any way he might.</p>
<p>There was no slightest degree of  the servant and master feeling between the two men. They were friends, and  though Rudd&rsquo;s position was that of confidential secretary, he filled that and  many other confidential posts.</p>
<p>It was during the evening that  Christine spoke of Drew Remsen&rsquo;s very evident attentions to Ruth Hanna.</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s eyes opened a little, and  Talbot said, crossly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remsen? That&rsquo;s the chap that  Renny kissed today in a way&mdash;well, in a way I wish she&rsquo;d kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Nick, dear, I have to kiss  you more dignifiedly, &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re so much more dignified and older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny looked like a sweet  sorrowful penitent who was willing to mend her ways, but Nick knew better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hereafter, you will refrain from  kissing anybody, in any manner, except myself and your brother and his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now will you be a good girl,  Renny?&rdquo; asked Byron. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll help. I&rsquo;ll let you kiss me as often as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And me, too,&rdquo; Christine put in,  smiling. &ldquo;But really, Ren, you must leave out Drew or Ruth Hanna will have  something to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly,&rdquo; and Renny&rsquo;s eyes  opened very wide. &ldquo;I give my kisses where I choose; they are my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But after the guests were gone and  Renny and Nick went upstairs, she went to his room, and by word and deed gave  him fully to understand that her kisses were all and only for him, that she  wanted to kiss no one else in the world ever, that the nonsense with Drew that  afternoon was no more than a mere handshake, and that it should never be  repeated. So definite and emphatic were these statements that Talbot believed  them implicitly and declared himself a brute to have said anything to hurt his  precious darling little bride.</p>
<p>And when the little bride left him  and went to her own room, she sat down by the window and looked out.</p>
<p>Sheerly by intuition, she knew  that Drew Remsen would be down there, and he was.</p>
<p>Scarce daring to whisper, she  said, &ldquo;Oh, Drew, what are you doing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waiting to see you look out,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;You are alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In less than a minute he was up  the porch column, and on the tiny balcony outside her window. Then his arms  were round her and he was kissing her fiercely, madly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo; he whispered,  &ldquo;until this afternoon, when you kissed me, I didn&rsquo;t know what we are to each  other. But now I know and you are&mdash;you must be mine&mdash;oh, Renny, how could you  marry him? But you will get a divorce, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew, have you lost your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, and my senses, and my  honor&mdash;you shall be mine if I have to kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, oh, hush! someone will hear  you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And someone did, and Talbot&rsquo;s  voice said coldly: &ldquo;Come in here, Remsen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once, Drew stepped over the low  window sill and faced Nicholas Talbot.</p>
<p>Renny, between the two men, was at  her wits&rsquo; end. No words could do any good, no action that she could think of,  would do any good.</p>
<p>But whatever she did must be done  to Nick, not Drew.</p>
<p>She stepped toward her husband,  her hands clasped, her eyes tear-filled, and said softly, &ldquo;Nick, listen to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He struck her. With the flat of  his hand he struck her face, and she fell back, as Drew rushed at Talbot.</p>
<p>With a blow he felled Nick to the  floor and was about to batter him, when Rudd appeared and pulled Remsen back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; Rudd whispered to Drew, &ldquo;go,  right now!&rdquo; Renny knelt beside her prostrate husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve killed him!&rdquo; she wailed to  Drew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I have!&rdquo; Drew turned, and  went out of the window and home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  Making Up</b></h2>
<p>The next morning Renny lay in her  bed, looking up at the Interior Decorated canopy of pale blue silk that had  been wished on her, and wondering just how she would better handle her  admirable but troublesome husband.</p>
<p>As if in answer to her thoughts,  Parker, the maid Rudd had engaged for her, brought word that Mr Talbot desired  to see her as soon as convenient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Parker, tell him that  I will see him in the morning room soon&mdash;no, don&rsquo;t say soon, say presently.  Presently is a useful word, it can mean almost anything. Tell him that, Parker,  and then come back and assemble me for the interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the maid returned, Renny was  already at her dressing table, doing things with an unusually reddish pink  rouge.</p>
<p>By careful scrutiny, she had  discovered the merest tinge of color on the cheek that Nick had slapped the  night before. By an artistic intensifying of this reddened spot and leaving the  other cheek pale, she had produced an excellent imitation of the effect of a  brutal insult she had received from her lord and master.</p>
<p>Parker&rsquo;s expressions of dismay at  this eccentric procedure were coldly set aside by Renny, who then selected a  chiffon negligee of palest chartreuse, a color especially becoming to her dark  beauty.</p>
<p>Then, adding a gently pathetic  expression to her lovely face, she went downstairs to keep her appointment.</p>
<p>Her &lsquo;presently&rsquo; had meant a really  long wait, and Nick Talbot was in a high state of impatience when she at last  appeared.</p>
<p>But Renny had builded well, and  the sight of that discolored cheek caused him to lose all thought of anger  against her and to feel himself the vilest wretch on earth.</p>
<p>Had he really so lost his senses  as to strike that lovely child, for whom he would, or thought he would, have  laid down his life!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, my precious one, can  you ever forgive me?&rdquo; he cried, in very real and earnest agony, and drew her to  him, careful not to touch the injured cheek.</p>
<p>Carefully Renny picked her words,  deciding that his deep contrition gave her full scope, and she murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were like a very devil, Nick,  but my love can forgive much. Yet to strike your Renny, your own little bride&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, my darling, don&rsquo;t put it  into words&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not only me, but Andrew! You  had no reason to hit him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hit me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same. Now, don&rsquo;t  let&rsquo;s have melodrama, but let&rsquo;s fix up this matter once for all. Drew did  nothing wrong in coming to my window. It was you who asked him to come in. You  know he&rsquo;s a mischievous sort, full of fun and joking. He just wanted to say  howdy to me, and he took that way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d better not take that way  again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nick, don&rsquo;t scold me&mdash;I can&rsquo;t  bear it&mdash;&rdquo; she turned her reddened cheek so he could see it better, and he  melted again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor darling,&rdquo; he said, as he  gently touched a finger-tip to the crimson patch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t touch it,&rdquo; she cried,  &ldquo;even your light, loving touch is agony. Do you think it will be permanent?  Shall I always have it like it is now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, your healthy skin will  heal rapidly, I am sure. But we&rsquo;ll call the doctor, to be on the safe side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a day or two, for that. It  may get better of itself. Now, Nick, as to Andrew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that Rudd came into  the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel, old chap?&rdquo; he  said to Nick. &ldquo;That was a fair punch the fellow gave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Renny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the honor of putting the  wounded champion to bed after the fray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, Nick?&rdquo; Renny asked,  without, however, any note of anxiety in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not badly enough to go to the  hospital,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but old Rudd thought Miller would handle me too  wuffly, and so he took over. What&rsquo;s on your mind, Rudd?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Remsen feller. Now look here;  every so often I have to give you two children a homily, and this is one of the  times. And you are to listen, not with angry hearts and prejudiced minds but  with common sense. You two are here now, in this big house, and you are going  to be tops in this small but very swagger community. Such a position calls for  dignity and decorum, if you have any notion what those words mean. But anyway,  you must not let a young noodle like Drew Remsen jostle you off your perch. If  he carries on with Renny, even in the mildest way, there&rsquo;s going to be gossip,  and&mdash;I will not allow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you got to say  about it?&rdquo; Renny said, pertly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has everything to say about  it,&rdquo; Nick declared. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand, Renny dear, but as my wife you have  to preserve a more careful manner than when you were a debutante. Don&rsquo;t argue  that, just remember it. You are quite right, Rudd, and we must be careful in  our treatment of Drew Remsen. You, darling,&rdquo; he drew Renny closer to him,  &ldquo;will, I know, obey me as to your acquaintance with him. We must not cut him  from our list of friends, it would not look well. I agree, Rudd, that we are  the principal citizens of this very restricted district, and that means that we  must impose some restrictions on ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of this conversation,  may I go, please?&rdquo; and Renny tried to rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you may not,&rdquo; Nick told her,  &ldquo;until you give me your promise never to see Andrew Remsen alone. Never to see  him at all, unless casually, in a crowd. You promise this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed; I promise. It&rsquo;s  beastly mean of you, for he is a splendid dancer, and I love to dance with him,  so you cut me out of a lot of pleasure. But what do you care for my pleasure?  Why did you marry me anyway? You should have married some old maid or some  widow, who would sit by the fire and darn your socks! You had no right to take  a young girl, who wants fun and entertainment and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that,&rdquo; Rudd  said, seriously, &ldquo;but, remember, Renny, you chose this life and now you must  live it. You&rsquo;ve no grievance, really; here you are with a devoted husband, a  splendid house, all the money you want, and you cannot have these without  giving something in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep out of this, Mr Caleb  Rudd! What I give to Nick is his affair, not yours, and first of all, I give  you obedience, don&rsquo;t I, you old Booful?&rdquo; With a smile that would have tamed the  Nemean Lion, she insinuated herself into his embrace, and Talbot held her  close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a scallywag,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;and the only obedience I ask of you is for your own good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I hate things that are  labeled, &lsquo;for my own good&rsquo;! But I&rsquo;m going to be the First Lady of Banbury  Gardens, I can tell you that, and if that means cutting the acquaintance of  nice young men, who know how to dance and make love and all that, why, I agree  to cut them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know these young men  can make love so well?&rdquo; Nick was gay now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t exactly know&mdash;but I  can easily find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare try it! Now you&rsquo;re  reinstated as Queen of the World, don&rsquo;t put your scepter in jeopardy again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what jeppidy means,  but if I am Queen of your heart, that&rsquo;s all I ask,&rdquo; and Renny&rsquo;s angelic smile  would have carried conviction to the sternest judge who ever sat on a bench.</p>
<p>With Andrew Remsen it was also the  morning after the night before.</p>
<p>He awoke to the realization that  he had made an infernal fool of himself. And as his thoughts came tumbling  rapidly, he discovered he was furiously angry with three people, namely, Mr  Talbot, Mrs Talbot and Miss Ruth Hanna. His ire, in each case, was unjust. He  should have been angry with only one human being, his blameworthy self.</p>
<p>But his reflections being what  they were he began to plan what he must do with each of his three problems.</p>
<p>First, he must go to Nick and make  a manly apology. Not an easy job, all things considered.</p>
<p>Then, he must settle Renny with a  few coldly polite words, and cut her out of his life entirely and forever.</p>
<p>Then there was Ruth.</p>
<p>This thought not only angered but  hurt. He had to realize that he had been a cad and a scoundrel, and those words  were not often applicable to him.</p>
<p>He had forgotten, or at least had  neglected to go to see her last night after he had promised to do so.</p>
<p>Ruth would never forgive him, and  another poignant hurt was that he knew he wouldn&rsquo;t care much if she didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Andrew Remsen was not, at heart, a  gay lothario, and he had thought himself properly in love with Ruth Hanna, but  when Renny had leaned out of the car window and kissed him, though really in a  spirit of hilarious excitement rather than affection, it had made him realize  that she was the one love of his life.</p>
<p>But that did not release him from  his obligation to Ruth.</p>
<p>She had told him to come to see  her the next night if he had not changed his mind! And he had changed his mind.  So much so that the very idea of marrying Ruth seemed to him an utter  impossibility.</p>
<p>But why not? He certainly couldn&rsquo;t  marry Renny. Nick Talbot was not the man to grant his wife a divorce for the  simple reason that she preferred another man.</p>
<p>It was a godawful mess, any way  you looked at it. And Drew felt no pleasure in anticipating his session with  Talbot, and less still in his interview with Ruth. Of Renny he dared not think.</p>
<p>What was there about that child  that made him willing to lie down and let her trample on him, if she wanted to?  To obey her slightest wish, to fulfill her most desperate command?</p>
<p>He must go away; he could not  trust himself to see Renny again.</p>
<p>But first, there were two  important duties to attend to, and Remsen was no shirk.</p>
<p>Along toward noon, he walked over  to the Talbot house, and saw Renny through a window, in the conservatory, which  was full of gay blooms.</p>
<p>There was an outside door, and  Renny opened it, saying, &ldquo;Come in, Drew,&rdquo; and then whispering, &ldquo;Play up!&rdquo; with  a look that made him understand Nick was in the next room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did cut up a silly trick last  night,&rdquo; she went on, in a carrying voice, &ldquo;climbing up the pillar just to show  off your athletics. And all you had to tell me was that you are engaged to Ruth  Hanna. You could have told me that anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew played up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, half laughing,  &ldquo;but the sight of that tremendous column reminded me of my boyhood days. You  know Uncle Perry used to live here, and I just wanted to see if I could make  it. How did you hear about Ruth and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grapevine telegraph. And I think  it&rsquo;s great. She&rsquo;s just the one for you. I like her better than any girl I ever  knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talbot walked in then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your errand was a bit of  gossip,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;maybe I owe you an apology, Remsen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for last night&rsquo;s dust-up,&rdquo;  Drew returned, &ldquo;but perhaps for calling &lsquo;a piece of gossip&rsquo; what to me is a  streamer headline!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you&rsquo;re engaged to little  Ruth. All my congratulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m engaged, but she&rsquo;s still  coyly holding off a little. All girls do that, don&rsquo;t they, Renny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, but it will be all  right. And she is so pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t she! that lovely calm  face, like a Greuze picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe down, Remsen,&rdquo; Nick said.  &ldquo;Raving over a loved one&rsquo;s ringlets isn&rsquo;t done any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right. But you know how  this sort of thing makes you feel! That&rsquo;s why I kissed Renny last night, and I  would have kissed you, if you&rsquo;d been a little less of a firebrand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it, forget it all&mdash;bother,  there&rsquo;s my private telephone! &rsquo;Scuse, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick went away, and as Remsen came  nearer to Renny, she waved him back, saying, in a very low voice, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a  fool! I saved you that time, I doubt I can ever do it again. Don&rsquo;t dare speak a  word that Nick mayn&rsquo;t hear; he is not as happy about it as he seems. Are you  really engaged to Ruth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll have to see  her again before I can tell you. And I&rsquo;ll have to see you again, before I can  tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good by, Drew,&rdquo; Renny said,  rising, and just as Nick came back to them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about the Fair, and let  you know. I must see what Nick says about it.&rdquo; Taking the not very guarded  hint, Remsen went away, and Talbot, said, slowly, &ldquo;I concluded to let last  night go by. It suits my purpose so. But if you give a repeat performance, I  shall, er, take notice of it. Now what&rsquo;s all this about a Fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  Enter A Relative</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo; Renny&rsquo;s  quick mind knew it was best to get as far away as possible from all thoughts of  last night, and she welcomed this chance. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the regular Charity Fair, they  have it every year, you know, in the Casino. We all work awful hard and we make  a lot of money for charity. And it&rsquo;s fun, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What part do you take?&rdquo; Nick  spoke without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any, if you don&rsquo;t want me  to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s eyes were half-way open,  and she looked like a docile child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I want you to. I&rsquo;ve  heard of these Fairs, they&rsquo;re famous. We must do our part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, will you be in it, too? Then  it will be fun! We must make up a real novelty. What shall it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be hard put to it to think  up a novelty,&rdquo; Rudd advised them. &ldquo;Everything has been done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think up a plan,&rdquo; Nick said.  &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a chance for your ingenuity. Suggest something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be useless to  try for a fantastic novelty. It seems to me your best bet would be something  that would be picturesque and attractive and would not require too much  fussing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Mexican Fiesta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfect!&rdquo; cried Renny. &ldquo;I can see  it all! One of the little fiestas, with all the fixings, and we can use all the  junk we brought home, and send for more if we need it. And if it isn&rsquo;t all  exactly right it won&rsquo;t matter much; those who haven&rsquo;t been to Mexico won&rsquo;t know  and those who have, won&rsquo;t care. You&rsquo;re splendid, Rudd, at thinking up things!  Won&rsquo;t it be fun, Nick? I&rsquo;ve been in lots of the fairs, but always before as one  of the helpers, waitress or chorus girl or something. Now, I can have one of  the principal booths, can&rsquo;t I, Nick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As principal as we can make it.  What are the outstanding details of a Fiesta, Rudd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Costumes, music and dances. You  won&rsquo;t attempt a drama?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not. An Adam and Eve  might catch on, but we couldn&rsquo;t attempt a Moors and Christians&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t have any of those drama  things,&rdquo; Renny begged, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve left out the eating. That&rsquo;s the Mexicanest  part, and that&rsquo;s what would make the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Rudd nodded, &ldquo;but  could we make the things? If you order them they won&rsquo;t be fit to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, and I can teach cook to  make enchiladas. I picked up a lot about Mexican cookery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; and Rudd looked a  trifle shamefaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rudd&rsquo;s a born cook,&rdquo; Talbot  declared. &ldquo;Whatever he ate in Mexico, he can make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; and Renny  opened her eyes wide with delight. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have a drama, they&rsquo;re a bore  anyhow. But we&rsquo;ll have a few first-rate dances. The jarabe, of course, and Rudd  can be the charro. And we&rsquo;ll have the sandunga&mdash;oh, we&rsquo;ll fix those all up. And  Mexican music, of course. You know all about that, Nick, and you brought home  lots of their queer instruments. Shall we have real Mexican girls and young  men, or our own crowd, fixed up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our own people, of course,&rdquo; Nick  told her. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want those brown folks around!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not all brown,&rdquo; Renny  contradicted. &ldquo;Some of them have a lovely ivory skin, like Anita&mdash;you remember  Anita, Nick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Talbot said nothing, Renny  repeated her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember her,&rdquo; and Talbot  could not prevent the crimson flush that rose to his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! Darling, you  needn&rsquo;t blush so about it! You liked her, didn&rsquo;t you? Did you ever kiss her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Renny,&rdquo; said Rudd. &ldquo;Those  are privileged communications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what those big words  mean, but I guess I&rsquo;ve got a right to ask my own husband anything I want to.  Nick, can you look me in the eye and say you never kissed Anita?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick looked at his wife. The thing  was absurd, but he scorned lying, and yet it seemed the only way out.</p>
<p>So he said, &ldquo;No, I never did,&rdquo; and  his tone was so forced and so unconvincing, that Renny gave a peal of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You darling!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  ever try to lie on the witness stand or you&rsquo;ll find yourself in jail. All  right, then, we&rsquo;ll let it go at that; you do as you like in these matters, and,  of course, I can have the same liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talbot was filled with wrath, but  he felt it wiser not to carry on the subject just then. He returned to the  discussion of the Charity Fair, and Renny wondered whether she had won out or  not.</p>
<p>Rudd wondered, too. Sometimes he  thought that deeply as Nick adored his wife, the time might come when his  long-tried patience might give way and a terrible scene would ensue. He thought  of warning Nick regarding this, but it was a delicate matter and since the Drew  Remsen affair had passed over so easily, perhaps it was wiser to let well  enough alone.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, Renny,  picking up a kitten to cuddle, threw herself down in a hammock in the sun-room  to think over some plans for the Fiesta. The warm room and the purring kitten  against her ear made her drowsy, but though she was not asleep, her eyes were  closed, when she heard a strange, but an attractive voice say, &ldquo;If you are  asleep, I have a right to kiss you&mdash;there is a law to that effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny was enchanted with the  situation, and entirely mistress of it. She kept her eyes closed, and said,  slowly: &ldquo;I am not asleep, but I am not going to open my eyes, so you may as  well go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to know who I am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I may be a tramp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go on with your tramping and  don&rsquo;t bother me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just here, Renny heard Nick&rsquo;s step  outside the room, and as it suddenly paused she knew he was listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said, to the voice,  &ldquo;my eyes are very beautiful, and when I open them, people all fall in love with  me. My husband can&rsquo;t abide that, so just lemme-lone, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renny! behave yourself!&rdquo; Nick&rsquo;s  voice was laughing, though stern. &ldquo;Trask, old fellow! when did you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, long ago. I&rsquo;ve been standing  here looking at this lady. Does she belong to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much so. Renny, put on a  proper smile and greet your cousin&mdash;is it cousin, Steve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the tone you use toward her,  I fancy the lady is your wife. In that case, Uncle Nicholas, she must be my  aunt. How do you do, Aunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. Renny, this is my  nephew, Stephen Trask, which makes him your uncle. Shake hands with your Uncle  Steve. Do not kiss him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, he is fussy about kisses,&rdquo;  Renny smiled at the visitor. &ldquo;About other people&rsquo;s, not about his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look Nick gave her frightened  her a little, but Trask took up the talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to be here, old boy. I  walked round the house, because it looked so attractive, and this door seemed  to be a bit ajar, so I just stepped in. I didn&rsquo;t mean to intrude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Renny  said, graciously. &ldquo;Have you come to stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a time, if you&rsquo;ll have me. I  would have let you know, Nick, but I came unexpectedly. I can go to the Inn or  what have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a warm welcome for you and  plenty of rooms,&rdquo; said Talbot cordially, for he was fond of this young man.</p>
<p>In fact Trask was Talbot&rsquo;s only  relative, and had reason to think he was to be Nick&rsquo;s heir. But that was before  Nick married, and it seemed likely that property arrangements might now be  changed.</p>
<p>Stephen Trask had not come to see  about this matter. He was a fine worthwhile young man, and trusted that his  uncle would treat him fairly.</p>
<p>Rudd, he knew would be remembered  in Nick&rsquo;s will, but he was not a relative, though a warm friend.</p>
<p>Trask had come partly because he  was in the neighborhood and because he heard enough about his uncle&rsquo;s new wife  to make him curious to see her.</p>
<p>Had he been asked concerning this  latter reason, he would have replied, &lsquo;the half has not been told.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For Renny, in the hammock, half  asleep, with the kitten nestled to her cheek had seemed to him a picture  unparalleled in any museum.</p>
<p>But Trask was intuitive, and he  paid no more attention to his hostess than courtesy required, for he had  quickly discovered that his respected uncle had acquired or perhaps developed a  latent Othello complex, which it were not wise to monkey with.</p>
<p>Wherefore the canny Trask divided  his conversation amiably between the two and when Rudd appeared, treated him  with a like manner of conversational chaff.</p>
<p>He knew Mexico and was ready to  suggest and assist in their charity enterprise.</p>
<p>Later he was installed in a  delightful suite of rooms and invited to make his visit as long as he wished.</p>
<p>Nick Talbot was really fond of  him, as the only son of his only brother, and he meant to find out the young  man&rsquo;s circumstances before finally deciding on his inheritance.</p>
<p>Ever since Talbot&rsquo;s marriage he  had meant to make a new will, which should include Renny in her due and proper  proportion.</p>
<p>His lawyer had spoken to him about  this a few times, and then had asked Rudd to speak to Nick. But Rudd, at the  lightest mention of the subject had received such a rebuff that he told the  lawyer he would never refer to it again.</p>
<p>Stephen Trask, naturally, could  say nothing to his uncle on such a subject as this, but he resolved that after  a time, if Talbot did not bring up the subject, he would himself do so. He was  not unduly grasping, this Trask chap, but he thought it only fair that he  should know how matters stood.</p>
<p>He threw himself, heart and soul,  into the making of the Fiesta. He declared he should make a Floating Garden,  which would be the eighth wonder of the world.</p>
<p>Nick fell in with this plan, and  they all worked on it.</p>
<p>Rudd was fertile of suggestion as  to building and Renny had full sway in the matter of decorating.</p>
<p>The Floating Garden was started  with an old scow, which was soon made beautiful with gay paint put on in  Mexican designs. A truly magnificent canopy surmounted it, made of Mexican  fabrics and embroideries. Tables were set out with Mexican pottery, and would  offer the best Mexican food at the Fair, so Rudd declared. And the flowers,  Nick had promised to see to it personally that their Floating Garden should  warrant its name, and should show a profusion of flowers, fresh and blooming  every day.</p>
<p>True, the Floating Garden had to  float on land, not water, but it would be so attractive that nobody would care.</p>
<p>The three men and Renny were most  enthusiastic about the affair, and were determined to give it just as much real  Mexican atmosphere as they possibly could.</p>
<p>Renny cut and planned costumes for  her dancing girls, and with Rudd, designed the suits for the men.</p>
<p>These were all made by capable  hands and of correct pattern and material, for whatever Nick Talbot undertook,  he carried through perfectly.</p>
<p>Nick was no fancy dancer, but  Trask could perform any caracole invented for the foot of man.</p>
<p>Rudd was a good dancer, but cared  little for it, yet, as he had in his memory all the details of the Mexican  dances, he was invaluable as a teacher. There must be two or three special  dances, the famous ones of the Fiestas, and of course, Trask and Renny must  dance them. Nick didn&rsquo;t mind, he had seen the Fiestas, and the dancing seemed  to him like puppets stalking about.</p>
<p>So it was decided that Renny and  Trask should learn the jarabe and the mariachi which were the most picturesque  as well as the easiest to learn. They required special costumes, which were at  once set in preparation.</p>
<p>These two dances were performed to  the music of a stringed instrument called the mariachi, a sort of Mexican harp,  on which Rudd had learned to play with a fair degree of excellence and a  decided Mexican twang.</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s costume, which was a real  Poblana dress from Mexico, was a full red skirt with a green yoke, spangled all  over with a white silk low-cut blouse embroidered with beads of all colors; and  a flame-colored rebozo, so fine it was like a whiff of fire.</p>
<p>Steve Trask, as the charro, was  gorgeous in long, tight leather trousers, covered with silver buttons and  chains, a soft leather jacket, braided in silver and gold and a gorgeous  serape.</p>
<p>For a charro, in full dress for  his dance is a magnificent affair, and Nick had sent instructions that everything  coming from Mexico for this occasion must be of the best and finest.</p>
<p>Wherefore, Trask, trying on this  magnificence, was so pleased with his appearance that he demanded a dress  rehearsal then and there.</p>
<p>Renny soon got into her costume,  and the two were as fine a pair of dancers as ever stood under Mexican skies.</p>
<p>The jarabe is a sentimental dance,  and before it is begun, there must be sung a song which is said to set the  mood. The song, which tells of the love of two turtle-doves, runs, &ldquo;See the  emotion with which they are trembling&mdash;billing and cooing with love&mdash;ah, the kiss  is only the net, would I could drink the river&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, with his hands behind  him, dances round the girl, with short, birdlike steps. She in a smaller  circle, comes near and draws away, smiles, and coquettes alluringly. This is  all, and the scene winds up with a sort of waltz movement.</p>
<p>Talbot watched the performance,  holding himself together by sheer willpower. Rudd, watching, wondered whether  it would be better to omit the rehearsal of the second dance. There were but  two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; cried Trask, &ldquo;hurry up,  Renny! I have an engagement, and I want to get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other dance was also a  romantic pantomime of the birds, but in this one the man was haughty and  uninterested. The coquettish girl was luring, then daring, and the rhythm of  the song was coaxing and seductive as the dancing became more and more  persuasive and acquiescent.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful picture.</p>
<p>Renny, in this dance, wore a  simpler frock and a red rose in her tangled curls. Trask, too, wore a plainer  garb, of plaited white linen, a small Jalisco sombrero and a brown serape. They  were like real people, and the wailing strains of Rudd&rsquo;s mariachi cast a  witchery of romance over the two seemingly heartbroken lovers.</p>
<p>Talbot stared at them, his face  went white, and he rose and left the room, slamming the door behind him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  At The Fair</b></h2>
<p>The music of the mariachi stopped  suddenly, the dancing ceased and the three left in the room looked at one  another in consternation.</p>
<p>Trask was very near Renny, and by  an uncontrollable reflex action of his muscles, he gathered her into his arms  and kissed her. It seemed the only thing to do.</p>
<p>Rudd&rsquo;s face did not change at  sight of the two, indeed, it already expressed the lowest depths of despair,  the absence of all hope.</p>
<p>He spoke mildly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Trask, I think you do not  realize just what has happened. Mr Talbot has reached the end of his patience  and his temper. He has been getting more and more disturbed all through this  dance and he was positively beside himself with rage and jealousy, when he ran  from the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd,&rdquo; said Trask,  scornfully. &ldquo;A man like that ought not to be at large! He ought to be shut up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Steve,&rdquo; Renny said, &ldquo;Nick  can&rsquo;t help it. We ought never to have undertaken this dance. Isn&rsquo;t that so,  Rudd?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but having undertaken it,  you ought to have carried it off more theatrically, more in burlesque. But you  two put your whole soul in your acting, and made it seem passionately real. I  don&rsquo;t know why you did that. You were not rehearsing for a great tragedy on the  stage, it is merely a foolish little story, as they dance it in Mexico. They do  it like puppets, you did real acting; why did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought a thing about  it,&rdquo; Renny declared. &ldquo;I just tried to sing nicely and look pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You succeeded too damn well!&rdquo;  Trask told her. &ldquo;Your pretty acting fired me to act, too, and my acting was in  earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let up on that, Trask,&rdquo; Rudd  spoke sharply now. &ldquo;This is no time for philandering. Renny, you are up against  it. I can&rsquo;t help you this time. I&rsquo;ve tried to pull you out of scrapes until  Nick has told me never to do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rudd, don&rsquo;t say that! Of  course you will help me. And I didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong&mdash;what did I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you only made up to Trask,  like a siren in the old mythology book. The dalliance of your eyes, the  caresses of your smiles, the wooing of your every gesture were enough to set  your partner afire&mdash;and did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did,&rdquo; echoed Trask. &ldquo;You talk  like a poet or something, Rudd, but you speak true talk. That&rsquo;s what happened,  and of course, I played up. I suppose Nick took it all in, and with his Othello  complex&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Othello didn&rsquo;t know what jealousy  meant, compared to Nick Talbot&rsquo;s wisdom on the subject. But the thing is, what  are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My advice,&rdquo; Trask stated, with an  air of calm decision, &ldquo;is to treat the matter lightly. Renny and I did nothing  wrong, and if Nick wants to kick up a fuss over it, let him kick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Renny was crying now, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  have to do it. You don&rsquo;t understand, Steve, these things have to be settled.  Rudd, you will help, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would, but I&rsquo;ve worn out my  welcome as a peacemaker. And I truly think you&rsquo;ll do better alone, this time.  There&rsquo;ll be lots of these occasions before the Fair is over, and I&rsquo;ll stand by.  But this is your personal affair, and I think you can put it over. Don&rsquo;t blame  Trask too much, just call him an innocent bystander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blame me all you like, Renny.  Tell old Nick I&rsquo;ll leave any minute, if he says so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trask couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to  see the matter as the other two did. He was entirely ready to apologize, if  Nick wanted him to or thought he ought to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a plan,&rdquo; Renny said,  rising, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s a good one, but I&rsquo;ll try it out. If you hear my  frantic shrieks, come to my aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She found Nick where she knew he  would be, in a small study that was one of his favorite rooms.</p>
<p>She had taken off the Mexican  costume and put on a simple little evening gown. She entered the room casually  and smiling, and then, as she sat down on the big arm of the modernistic chair  he was in, she looked more serious, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nick, darling, Steve is  awfully offended and he&rsquo;s going home, right off! He says he&rsquo;ll leave any minute  you say. Dear, why did you slam out of the room like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stand it to see that  brute making love to you before my eyes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was the play! Don&rsquo;t people  always act in plays? And I&rsquo;ll give up the whole thing if you want me to. I wish  you could take the part, but you don&rsquo;t dance well enough. Now, we&rsquo;ll leave  those two dances out entirely. But do you want Mr Trask to go away? If not,  you&rsquo;ll have to ask him to stay on. He didn&rsquo;t say so, but I know he thinks you  treated him a bit rudely. Don&rsquo;t you want to be nice to him now, and let it all  blow over? You&rsquo;re such a just, fair-minded man and you always do the right  thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear little peacemaker,  Renny, and I suppose I ought to fix it up with Trask. And go on with the  dances. I want you to have them, but, my darling, couldn&rsquo;t you make the love  scenes a little less realistic? A little more make-believe, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, it would spoil  the artistry, but if you want me to, I&rsquo;ll be more wooden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you wouldn&rsquo;t be praised for  your beautiful work! Oh, dear, this world is awful hard on husbands with  beautiful wives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if they trust in their  beautiful wives&rsquo; love and faith,&rdquo; Renny whispered. And then the game was won  and Nick promised her that she might play the part of a Mexican parrot or  toucan or whatever bird she was supposed to represent, in any way she chose to  cavort herself.</p>
<p>They went back to find a calm and  equable Trask awaiting them, and a slightly nervous Rudd.</p>
<p>Nick&rsquo;s first words cleared the  air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trask,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my apologies. I  have a rotten way of losing my temper, though I do try to control it. Stay with  us, and let&rsquo;s make the Fair a success by our talents and efforts. Righto?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! What&rsquo;s the use of being  relations if we can&rsquo;t have a flare-up now and then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the easy-going Trask took this  to mean he was at liberty to play up the Mexican birds in any way he chose, and  he did so. But somehow it was managed that the rehearsals were held when Talbot  was not at home.</p>
<p>Renny was trying hard to be a  model wife. Not that she approved of model wives, especially, but she was  learning how very exclusively Nick considered her his property and how easily  he became annoyed or worse, if she paid the slightest attention to any other  man.</p>
<p>She was beginning to think she  just couldn&rsquo;t continue to live with him. Rudd was the only one he trusted her  alone with. And well he might, for Rudd had never given Nick&rsquo;s wife one  admiring glance, had never said to her one word that Nick might not have heard  and welcomed. If ever a man was devoted, heart and soul, in the best and finest  way, to another man, it was Caleb Rudd to Nick Talbot.</p>
<p>This devotion was never expressed  in words, seldom shown in visible acts, but the friendship was there, strong,  firm and dependable when wanted.</p>
<p>Renny liked Rudd very much indeed,  as E. P. Roe said to Opie Read, but she never felt the least impulse to flirt  with him. When they chanced to be alone together, their talk was varied and  interesting, never forced and never personal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you never been in love,  Rudd?&rdquo; she said once. &ldquo;No, Renny, the opportunity never came my way,&rdquo; he  returned, with a smile, and the subject was never raised again.</p>
<p>But he did permit himself to warn  her of dangers that might impend.</p>
<p>Taking a chance when they were  waiting for Nick to come home from a Directors&rsquo; Meeting or something of the  sort, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a care, Renny, of the Remsen  lad. Remember the night he came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe enough; he&rsquo;s engaged to  Ruth Hanna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not really engaged, he&rsquo;s  playing fast and loose with her. He&rsquo;s a bad hat, is Remsen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you do, that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m  begging you to keep out of his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t, Rudd. Not entirely.  I&rsquo;m to do a dance with him at the Fair. Quite a separate thing from our dances,  you know. Mrs Appleton asked me and I couldn&rsquo;t refuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Nick know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so; but he won&rsquo;t  mind, since it&rsquo;s in Mrs Appleton&rsquo;s booth. She&rsquo;s head of the whole thing, you  know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, tell him, anyhow, Renny.  Don&rsquo;t spring it on him at the Fair, or he&rsquo;ll go berserk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s berserk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out if you give Nick  a surprise of that sort. Here he comes, you can tell him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car came to the house, and  Nick was soon with them, but Renny said no word of her dance with Drew Remsen.  She found it difficult to bring up the subject, and she had in her mind a  half-formed plan to give up the dance with him. She&rsquo;d wait a day longer and  think it over.</p>
<p>It was Thursday now, and the Fair  was to open on Saturday night.</p>
<p>On Friday she spoke to Mrs  Appleton about the matter and that lady said, &ldquo;Oh, no, indeed, I can&rsquo;t let you  give it up. I couldn&rsquo;t train anyone else for it now. It&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mrs Appleton, I&rsquo;m afraid my  husband won&rsquo;t like the costume. It is very scanty, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear, all you wear is  practically that Spanish shawl, but it is very large, yards and yards of  material in it, and so fine you could draw it through a &mdash;well, a barrel hoop,  anyway! And I&rsquo;m going to drape you myself, your husband will adore you in it!  No, no, don&rsquo;t dare mention making any change, I&rsquo;m nearly frantic already with  changes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So what could Renny do? Nothing  but leave the matter on the knees of the gods and hope the gods would be kind  to her.</p>
<p>She was growing more and more  afraid of Nick, his jealousy was getting unbearable and also unreasonable, and  she told Christine one day that she wished a magic carpet would come and carry  him away so far he would never come back.</p>
<p>Christine was duly shocked and scolded  Renny for not more greatly appreciating the good fortune that had come to her  and bade her be careful how she roused a jealousy of such strength.</p>
<p>She concluded her homily by  begging Renny, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, to be careful at the Fair, for while it was  bad enough for Nick to give way to tantrums in his own home, to make a scene at  the Fair would be infinitely worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; Renny said,  almost in tears, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s those eyes of yours,&rdquo;  Christine opined. &ldquo;In that fool dance you&rsquo;re going to do for Mrs Appleton&mdash;I saw  the scarf&mdash;you&rsquo;d better wear a veil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Nick will hate that  dance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t his hating it, but he&rsquo;ll  probably play Samson and tear down the pillars of the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Renny had no intention of  wearing a veil to prevent a spectacular Samson act, and she went on trusting to  luck.</p>
<p>And when at last Saturday night  came, and they were all ready to start for the great festival, Talbot seemed as  mild as a lamb, and even imbued with a spirit of merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put a little dignity into your  dancing, Renny,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to give a hoyden effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll do it all right,&rdquo; Trask  said, for he was getting tired of hearing Nick instruct Renny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll give my advice to you,&rdquo;  Nick said, a touch of sternness in his voice. &ldquo;Put a little more dignity into  your own performance, and curb your tendency to amorous gestures and tones.  They are uncalled for and they greatly mar the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trask was tempted to make a sharp  retort, but decided against it, and only said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, Uncle Nick,&rdquo; in a  childish voice, which didn&rsquo;t help matters much.</p>
<p>They were in the car, and after  they reached the Fair, they separated, the dancers to their dressing rooms and  the others greeting friends here and there.</p>
<p>In her Mexican garb, Renny came  out and walked about among the crowd. The center of a group, in no time, she  saw Drew Remsen coming toward her and unable to help it, she smiled at him.</p>
<p>The welcoming smile, and the  bewitching costume bowled him over completely, and he grasped her arm and led  her to one of the dancing platforms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, take me back,&rdquo; she gasped,  &ldquo;Nick will see us and he&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hide, then,&rdquo; and he drew  her aside to a small anteroom which chanced to be empty. He closed the door and  stood against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renny,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t do!  You know it! We can&rsquo;t live without each other. I tried to care for Ruth, but  just one look from under your long lashes, one tiny smile from your perfect  lips, and I am done for! I must and will have you, Renny, no matter what I do  to get you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Drew! And let me  out of here, you&rsquo;ve spoiled my head dress already. And remember, you belong to  Ruth and I belong to Nick, and there can be no more&mdash;no more of anything between  us, not even friendship. It&rsquo;s too late for that, Drew. Open that door, and then  stand back, while I go out alone. Don&rsquo;t disgrace me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not tonight&mdash;but after that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny stepped out, as from a  dressing room, touching her head dress and patting a curl into place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Nick?&rdquo; she asked Rudd, as  she met him outside the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he wanted to run over to  the library to meet Van Dusen, who has an old before-the-flood coin, and  they&rsquo;ve got to hobnob over it. Said he&rsquo;d be back for your dance. Everything all  right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, but I want you to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What she wanted him to do, Rudd  never knew, for several men claimed Renny as a dance partner, though she  declared she had engaged herself to none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promised me the first, and  you know it!&rdquo; a determined voice said, and as the speaker almost whirled her  off her feet, Renny was forced to pay attention to the steps she was supposed  to take.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This must be a quick one, Louis,&rdquo;  she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m due for my dance in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes is quite a bit of a  while,&rdquo; her partner said, &ldquo;more than I hoped for. Is your Bluebeard husband  here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In person. So behave yourself  prettily. Now, take me to the dressing room; I hate to be tardy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but you&rsquo;ll give me  some more later. Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a commotion in the room,  the club watchman was there, speaking to Mr Appleton, and Renny and her partner  drew a step nearer to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the man was repeating.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr Talbot, and he&rsquo;s stone dead, no mistake about that, sir. Outside the  window, sir, you come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  Tragedy And Mystery</b></h2>
<p>Lewis Appleton was a capable man  and a wise one.</p>
<p>But his &ldquo;Hush, man, speak lower!&rdquo;  had little effect on Fenn, the watchman. He tried to subdue his voice, but the  big, burly fellow was more excited than he had ever before been in his life,  and he couldn&rsquo;t suppress his turbulent nerves, though he did try.</p>
<p>Appleton realized the situation,  saw the frightened faces round him and heard one or two faint screams.</p>
<p>Though aware of the necessity for  haste, he took time to step up on a chair and say a few words, begging the  audience to be quiet and preserve self-control until it could be known whether  there was any real cause for alarm.</p>
<p>Then he went with Fenn, and they  quickly left the building.</p>
<p>The watchman led the way round the  corner of the big Casino, and toward a small window that looked in upon a  dressing room that opened on the small stage that would present the fancy  dances. There were some people on the stage, but the two men did not look at them,  as Fenn stopped beside the huddled figure on the ground beneath the window, and  turned on his flashlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick Talbot!&rdquo; said Appleton, as  if just learning the truth. &ldquo;And murdered! What must we do first?&rdquo; It was like  the man that his mind turned to duty before thinking what this death must mean  to many people.</p>
<p>But Fenn could not evade the  personal touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it awful, Mr Appleton, to  see him a layin&rsquo; there like that! An&rsquo; see the blood all over him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been stabbed,&rdquo; Appleton  said, stooping down to look. &ldquo;The knife is still in the wound&mdash;he was struck in  the neck, see&mdash;must be a long blade. Don&rsquo;t touch it, Fenn, let&rsquo;s get the Medical  Examiner as quick as we can. You go and call the Westchester Police, and  they&rsquo;ll notify the District Attorney. Then you find Mrs Appleton, and you tell  her the whole story. But tell her to confer with Granger, and they two must  decide what to do about closing the Fair, or&mdash;or whatever they think best. Go to  it, and get a couple of local chaps to come here and be with me. Things will be  moving shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fenn hurried away, and Appleton  again examined his dead friend, as much as he could without handling the body.</p>
<p>Under the window grew a lot of  small young conifers, and Talbot had fallen or been flung into the very midst  of these. He lay among the green boughs, on his back, but twisted over to one  side, and his overcoat collar was stained with blood.</p>
<p>Looks like the work of a thug,  Appleton thought, no decent feller, however angry, would have pitched him  galley-west like that. Wonder if he had much on him. Must have been robbery or  else some disgruntled communist who resented Nick&rsquo;s wealth. Wish somebody&rsquo;d  come.</p>
<p>And then a young policeman came,  running. Another followed, and Appleton was glad to give over his watch.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful night, one of  the mild ones that sometimes come in late February, and the moon was just  beginning to disappear beyond the wooded horizon. But though there was no cold  wind Appleton was chilled through, and gladly went into the Casino for some  cheer.</p>
<p>On the very doorstep he met the  Medical Examiner, Doctor Lindsay, and they went in together. Hatton, who was  Nick&rsquo;s doctor, greeted them, and Appleton introduced the two and left them to  work together, while he went in search of his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most complicated affair,&rdquo; said  Doctor Hatton, wringing his nervous hands. &ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just the usual procedure,&rdquo;  Lindsay returned. &ldquo;Where is he? Who is in charge, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;perhaps I am. But I  know nothing about it. I haven&rsquo;t seen Nick Talbot for a long time. Where&rsquo;s the  District Attorney? Lane ought to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get people in a minute,  late at night, too. He&rsquo;ll turn up soon.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Appleton, meantime, had found his  wife, and said, quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can we be alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up on the stage,&rdquo; she told  him, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no one there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dismissed a couple of  scene-shifters and a prompt-boy, and then turned to her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talbot is dead,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;murdered. The Fair must be stopped at once&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! We can&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do that. The place must  be vacated and closed as fast as possible. The police are already in charge, we  have nothing to say about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must get busy. I will take  care of the girls and the musicians. Someone must get the Women&rsquo;s Committee  together; Mrs Loring will be helpful, she always is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think, Milly. Mrs Loring is the  sister of Talbot&rsquo;s wife&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;sister-in-law. We can&rsquo;t  ask her for help. Get me Mrs Gorham, then, and we&rsquo;ll take care of our part. Go  on, Lewis, and get your own committee in council. You&rsquo;ll have things to  decide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one thing positive is that  the Fair must close. Talbot is our star citizen, the richest and most generous  man of the Gardens. Think what he has given to this Casino! The new shooting  gallery, the bowling alley, the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, and you&rsquo;re right, we couldn&rsquo;t  go on with this thing and Nick Talbot murdered! Will there be inquests and  those things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, dear. The District  Attorney will see to all that. I&rsquo;ve never had any experience in a murder case&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A messenger came for Appleton, and  he went off at once. His wife, a handsome woman, took a moment to plan, and  then went to her strange duties.</p>
<p>Lane, the District Attorney,  arriving, had sent for Appleton, as the Head of the Fair, and with the Chief of  Police and the Captain of the Homicide Squad, a meeting was held in a room  commandeered for the purpose.</p>
<p>As was his habit, Lewis Appleton  took charge of the meeting. He was a man who always took charge of anything he  ran into.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust you all agree with me,  gentlemen,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that the Fair must be closed immediately. We cannot  allow such a lack of respect for Nicholas Talbot&rsquo;s memory as to keep this thing  going a minute longer than it will take to stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will take a bit of time,&rdquo;  Lane said. &ldquo;The police will have to clear the place in their own way, and that  means slow going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way, Mr Appleton,&rdquo;  Chief Brady spoke up, &ldquo;we have to go by our rules, and we&rsquo;ve got to have the  name and address of everybody that goes out of this building tonight. We&rsquo;ll put  plenty of men on it and we&rsquo;ll be as fast as we can, but it&rsquo;s got to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Chief, you&rsquo;ll find no  obstacles in your way to carry on your routine work. But it isn&rsquo;t the general  crowd I&rsquo;m thinking about, it&rsquo;s the family, the relatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of any relatives  Talbot has except his wife, a pretty little piece. She is Byron Loring&rsquo;s  sister. I&rsquo;ve seen her and Talbot over in White Plains, but nobody was with  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has relatives, Lane,&rdquo;  Doctor Hatton said. &ldquo;A nephew is living at the house now, or visiting. I don&rsquo;t  know which. And there&rsquo;s another chap there, I think he&rsquo;s a relative of Talbot,  too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Appleton declared.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Nick&rsquo;s friend, and he lives there, but he&rsquo;s not related. Mighty fine  chap, too, and what say we call him in here, instead of the nephew. We&rsquo;ve got  to talk to some of the family, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right to call in the  widow &mdash;where is she? has she gone home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not call in Byron Loring?&rdquo;  Lane proposed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Talbot&rsquo;s brother-in-law, and it seems sort of proper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Byron was called in, and he  nodded a sort of greeting and then sat down without saying a word.</p>
<p>Lewis Appleton spoke. &ldquo;Mr Loring,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;we are uncertain how to proceed. Doctor Lindsay, the Medical  Examiner, wishes to make his report, but we hesitate to intrude upon Mrs  Talbot, and we are asking your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will not trouble my  sister with questions tonight, if it can be avoided. She is, of course, the  head of the Talbot family, now, but I have been her guardian ever since our  parents&rsquo; death, and I trust you will let me relieve her at this time as far as  possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Loring,&rdquo; and Lindsay  assumed a businesslike attitude. &ldquo;My findings are that Nicholas Talbot died  suddenly, from the stab of a sharp blade of a long knife. The weapon was left  in the body, but it has now been extracted, and seems to be just an ordinary  kitchen knife, the kind, I think, that is called a slicer. Further than that we  have no definite clues. We shall, of course, have to question all the members  of Mr Talbot&rsquo;s household, and we must interview Mr Trask and Mr Rudd tonight,  but we will not talk with Mrs Talbot until tomorrow, if you so advise. Where is  the lady now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is in one of the small rooms  that adjoin the stage. She is with my wife, and some other friends. My sister  is not at all hysterical or unnerved; she has a nature that rises to an  emergency, though she may collapse afterward. It is just possible that she may  prefer to talk to you tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, if you think it would be  all right, let&rsquo;s talk to her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Suppose I go and  ask her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do that,&rdquo; and Lindsay  indulged in a hope that he might get through with his part in the matter  tonight, and not have to come over again.</p>
<p>Loring found Renny sitting beside  Christine. She had been crying, but she was quiet now, and listened to what  Byron had to say.</p>
<p>She thought a moment, and then  said, &ldquo;Yes, Byron, I think I would rather meet them right now, and have it over  with. Oh, I suppose they may want to see me again, but I&rsquo;m all keyed up now,  and tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll be a limp rag. Come on, take me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Renny, don&rsquo;t see them  tonight,&rdquo; Christine begged her, for she knew that Renny was keyed up, and that  was far from the best mood in which to hold the proposed interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Christine, don&rsquo;t scold me  now! You know how nervous and upset I am, and you just make me more so! You  ought to give me my own way now if ever! Isn&rsquo;t that so, Byron? Stand up for me,  Byron, dear, your own little sister&mdash;you&rsquo;ve always been so good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better let her go, Chris,&rdquo; Loring  told his wife. &ldquo;I hate to cross her just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had his way, and Christine  looked her disapproval as the two left her and went to the ordeal.</p>
<p>The District Attorney led the  inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry to ask you  questions,&rdquo; he said, gently, after Renny was comfortably placed, and sat,  looking like a stricken angel, &ldquo;but I assure you I shall ask only the most  necessary ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, her lovely face  striving to look brave. &ldquo;No, Mr Lane, don&rsquo;t spare me. Remember anything I can  do for my husband or for his memory I will do gladly. Ask me anything you wish,  however personal or confidential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that, but I fear  to harrow your feelings too much for your endurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of that, just go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, tell me just where  you were when you first heard the news of your husband&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was so different from what  Renny had expected to be asked, that she stared at him first and then opened  her eyes wide.</p>
<p>And this being Robert Lane&rsquo;s first  sight of this phenomenon, he all but made an appropriate exclamation. But he  conquered his feelings and waited quietly for her answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think, exactly,&rdquo; Renny  said, and quite truly. &ldquo;I was dancing with somebody, just a little round dance,  you know, not on the stage, but it was almost time for my stage dance, and I  know I said to him&mdash; but I can&rsquo;t think who he was&mdash;I said that I must hurry to  the dressing room or I&rsquo;d be late, and I&rsquo;m never late for anything. Am I,  Byron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lane went right on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, just now, Mrs Talbot,  who it was, what did you hear then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why that&rsquo;s when I heard&mdash;oh, I  remember now, who it was! It was Louis Alger, how stupid of me to forget!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Alger was with you when you  heard the news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I told you. It  was a sort of porter talking, I think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the Casino watchman. What  did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how can I tell you? He  said&mdash;he said Mr Talbot was dead, and there was no doubt about it! That&rsquo;s what he  said. If I had believed it, then, I think I should have screamed&mdash;but, you see,  I didn&rsquo;t think it was true&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the brown eyes opened wide  at him. &ldquo;Why, because it seemed too absurd. I had just seen Nick a few minutes  before and to be told a thing like that, of course, I didn&rsquo;t believe it! But  soon I had to believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you believe it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody was talking of it. And  Mr Appleton stood up on a chair and said it was true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to my brother. He is all I  have left, now, you see. Do you want to ask me anything more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs Talbot. Who do you think  could have killed your husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea, Mr Lane. I  suppose it must have been some of those bad men who hate rich people. You know  what I mean, Reds, they call them, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had Mr Talbot ever been  threatened by any such people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge. But if he  had been, he would not have told me. He never said anything that would frighten  or alarm me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if he feared trouble with  some bad men, you knew nothing of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not. Perhaps Mr Rudd could  tell you about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Mr Rudd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a friend of Nick&rsquo;s, and he  lives with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a relative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. They are just firm  friends. I don&rsquo;t know how Mr Rudd will stand this awful thing that has come to  us. Please let me go, now, I am beginning to lose my grip.&rdquo; Big tears were running  down Renny&rsquo;s cheeks, but Lane held her a moment longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Talbot, as the Medical  Examiner has made his report, I now turn over the body of your husband to you.  Where do you want it taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home, of course.&rdquo; Renny seemed  surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; Byron said, &ldquo;it would  be better to send it to the Mortuary Parlors, down near the church, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I went there once. It is  a lovely place. Do that, Byron, look after it, will you? And I can go there to  see him, can&rsquo;t I? You must excuse me, Mr Lane, but these things are all new to  me, and I don&rsquo;t quite know how to act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, my dear,&rdquo; said  Doctor Hatton, coming to her. &ldquo;I will run in to see you tomorrow, and I know  your brave heart will carry on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, everybody&mdash;please take  me away, Byron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brother and sister went off  and the District Attorney and the Medical Examiner were at last left alone  together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where more is meant than meets  the ear,&rdquo; said Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still waters run deep,&rdquo; said  Lindsay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  A Perturbed Community</b></h2>
<p>It is hard for the general  inexperienced public to realize the multifold duties of the police immediately  after a murder.</p>
<p>Many members of the Homicide Squad  itself are handicapped by indecision, not what to do, but what to do first. The  investigators are trained to an orderly routine, but when a case is complex,  its scenes various and its motives unknown, when a hundred traces or  indications are calling at once for instant attention, discernment and wise  judgment are necessary to a right procedure.</p>
<p>And this case of Nicholas Talbot  was bewildering Chief Brady, who wanted to do right and do it quickly.</p>
<p>He wanted to get through with the  Casino and get over to the Talbot house, which was calling to him across the  Gardens.</p>
<p>By Herculean efforts he did get  the people out of the Casino, a big place, with its endless chain of rooms and  halls, balconies and galleries.</p>
<p>His faithful men tallied the names  and addresses of the vanishing crowd, and then were set to work scouring the  place for clues or for evidence of any sort, which was not readily found.  Plenty of lost objects were garnered, fans, bags, compacts, handkerchiefs,  cigarette cases and such, and these were carefully filed, but they meant  nothing as yet.</p>
<p>The principals of the various  committees were held and questioned, but could tell little of interest. A few  had noticed the members of the Talbot household, here and there, but their  behavior was in no way unusual.</p>
<p>The kitchen quarters were  ransacked in an endeavor to learn if the fatal knife had belonged there. This  could not be decided, for the myriad knives found were partly the Club property  and partly brought in from restaurants and other supply sources and ranged from  the humblest wooden handles to monogrammed silver or ivory.</p>
<p>Brady himself looked after the  protection of the place where Talbot&rsquo;s body had lain. He ordered it fenced  around, and covered securely with strong, durable material that would keep out  the weather and also any possible marauders. Two men were to guard it day and  night, until ordered off.</p>
<p>Day was almost breaking when Brady  went home, but he had to be back there early, and he was always better for a  short sleep.</p>
<p>So the sun had to rise without the  Chief&rsquo;s help, and it dared to shine sharply in at the windows of Renny Talbot&rsquo;s  sleeping room.</p>
<p>It found that young woman wide  awake, and also with her brown eyes wide open, as she tried to realize what it  all must mean to her.</p>
<p>The night before, Byron and  Christine had come home with her, after vainly trying to make her spend the  night with them.</p>
<p>Mrs Golder, the worthy Talbot  housekeeper had begged to be allowed to assist her to get ready for bed, but  Renny declared she wanted nobody, but just her own little maid, Minty, who  could do everything for her.</p>
<p>Mrs Golder understood and arranged  that Renny should have her way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; she asked of her  friend, the butler, after he had let out the Byron Lorings. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s to have  everything just as she wants it, as long as she can, and that may not be long,  poor child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Golder had resented Renny&rsquo;s  advent, after her many years of looking after Nick&rsquo;s bachelor establishments.  But Renny won out, by her sweet ways and really kind heart, and the housekeeper  was now her devoted slave.</p>
<p>And the lady possessed a marvelous  degree of perspicacity. From the very first, she had read Renny almost exactly  right, and the few mistakes she made, she was not aware of. She understood and  approved Renny&rsquo;s attitude to everybody under the Talbot roof. To Nick and to  his visiting friends, to chance guests and to the servants. And most of all, to  herself. She did not consider herself a servant, and she appreciated and  admired Renny&rsquo;s exact standpoint, halfway between mistress and friend, and she  marveled that the girl could command it so perfectly.</p>
<p>So Renny lay there, in the  sunlight, unheeding the light taps she heard on her door at intervals. Minty,  bless her heart, was trained to tap lightly, and, if not invited in, not to try  again for a while.</p>
<p>But at length, there came a more  decided rap, which, Renny knew was Mrs Golder&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; Renny called, and the  housekeeper obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother is downstairs,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;and he says you must get up and come down because some men are coming to  talk to you. He wants to see you now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; and Byron came in.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for you, Renny, you know that, but really you must try to forget  yourself a little, and remember, if you can, your duty to Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Renny sat up  in her bed and opened her eyes at him. &ldquo;I never neglect a duty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t quite know, my child,  what you are up against. They are trying to find out who killed Nick, and  naturally they want to see what you can tell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that. You just tell them,  Byron, that I haven&rsquo;t the least idea who did it, if I had I&rsquo;d tell them frankly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rolled over again, and Byron  went to her and gave her a good shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, and don&rsquo;t be such a  silly. I don&rsquo;t see how Nick ever put up with your stupidity and ignorance!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;He liked it.&rdquo; Renny flung back  the bedclothing. &ldquo;Go on, now, just push that bell for Minty. I&rsquo;ll be down in a  few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that you do!&rdquo; He kissed her,  for he really loved his foolish little sister, and went out as Minty came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything white,&rdquo; Renny said, and  the girl brought her a plain tailored white crepe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black beads?&rdquo; Minty asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing like that. Give me  just a little coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes she was down in  the morning room, and found Rudd was waiting for her. She took the hand he held  out, and meeting the glance from his clear blue eyes, she said, &ldquo;I am so sorry  for you,&rdquo; in real sincerity, and he knew it.</p>
<p>He only said, &ldquo;I am sorry for you,  Renny, too. I hope I can be of help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t, nobody can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she turned to Trask, and  said, &ldquo;You, too, have lost a good friend,&rdquo; and he replied, &ldquo;Yes, we all have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each felt relief that these  necessary words had been spoken, and no further expressions of sympathy were  called for.</p>
<p>Then she turned to Byron, saying,  &ldquo;I thought you said the whole police force was down here, waiting to arrest  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Byron looked at her, and then  spoke sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Renny, to speak  before our friends here, but I must insist that you stop that light way of  talking. I am trying to think it is because of the sudden tragedy that has come  upon you and has disturbed your poise. It is not your way to show such bad  taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Byron had struck the  right note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, By. You are right, and  I think it is because I have lost my mental balance somehow. I won&rsquo;t do it  again. Tell me what will happen. Who will come here and what will they look  for? You know they can guess people by fingerprints nowadays. Will they take  ours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But mostly, dear, they  will ask you questions about Nick. If you know the answer, tell it truly. If  you don&rsquo;t, then say so, don&rsquo;t make up or exaggerate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. I know all about Nick  that there is to know, and there is nothing bad. Will they ask things about me?  Must I tell those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it your general rule to tell  the truth. It&rsquo;s the best way. But if asked anything you really don&rsquo;t want to tell,  you can say so and they may let you off it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do all right, Renny,&rdquo;  Trask put in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only afraid you&rsquo;ll try to rag &rsquo;em. Don&rsquo;t do that. It&rsquo;s poor  taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; and Renny turned to Rudd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;anything  is poor taste, except to answer clearly and truly. But I think you won&rsquo;t be  bothered much. I doubt they&rsquo;ll try to heckle you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then they came. The case had  been put in the capable hands of Inspector Craven and his young assistant,  Detective Sergeant Flint. They came together to make their first call on the  principals of this important homicide.</p>
<p>After learning one another&rsquo;s  identities, the Inspector began.</p>
<p>He had a fine shape and a fine  face, but the latter was marred by a pair of what could only be called gimlet  eyes. Black they were, and piercing but more than that, they seemed to have a  dreadful way of reading another person&rsquo;s thoughts. Renny perceived this at  once; after a second glance, Rudd became aware of it, but Byron never noticed  it at all.</p>
<p>In fact, Byron Loring wouldn&rsquo;t  have cared if everybody in the world had read all his thoughts; indeed, he  would have been rather proud of such a performance. But the good-looking Craven  seemed to have not the slightest curiosity concerning Loring&rsquo;s most secret  hopes or fears.</p>
<p>This strange man was, to all  appearance, most fascinated by Trask&rsquo;s intelligent face. And Steve seemed aware  of it. His eyes were alight with information, his face shone with knowledge and  he seemed scarce able to keep his mouth shut until he should be asked to pour  forth his mental treasures.</p>
<p>Craven looked at him twice, before  he made his opening remark. The first time he looked puzzled and the second  time he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe, Mr Trask,&rdquo; the  Inspector said, &ldquo;that you are the nearest living relative of the late Mr  Nicholas Talbot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you count his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am speaking of the Talbot  family, of blood relations; are there any nearer than yourself? Do you know of  any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not; and Nick didn&rsquo;t either.  I&rsquo;ve heard him say if he had any other kin, he&rsquo;d like to look &rsquo;em up and pal  with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, that as to yourself you  are Nicholas Talbot&rsquo;s nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I am the only child of  his only brother. Don&rsquo;t you call that heir presumptive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in this country. Also, Mr  Talbot left a will. You were on good terms with your uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best. But I didn&rsquo;t call him  uncle. We were chums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. He had many friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, a great many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not a man to have what you  would call enemies. If anyone did anything that displeased him, he simply let  that person alone. He didn&rsquo;t pick a quarrel with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know some of these among his  social acquaintances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. If there were such,  he kept the matter to himself. He seldom talked against anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet he had one enemy who hated him  enough to kill him. He was not the sort of man to commit suicide, was he?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Trask stared at the speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly!&rdquo; he said, with a  look of scorn. &ldquo;Can you imagine a man in full health and strength, rolling in  wealth, and having just achieved a beautiful young wife, wanting to leave all  this happiness? Also, as I understand it, the fatal wound is not indicative of  suicide. Is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea has been suggested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then whoever suggested it would  better think again. There is probably no man on the face of the earth who had  less reason to kill himself than Nick Talbot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we have to search for an  enemy. Do you know of anyone with a grudge against him? Unjust, perhaps, but  revengeful. Has he discharged servants, who resented it? Has he offended any of  his casual acquaintances? Could he have had a secret enemy who threatened him,  in revenge for some past injury?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of no such instances,&rdquo;  Trask said, &ldquo;and I think there have been none.&rdquo; He had suddenly become quieter  and less inclined to talk.</p>
<p>The Inspector turned to Rudd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me anything bearing  on the matter?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am told you are Mr Talbot&rsquo;s confidential secretary,  and I am sure you recognize that on such an occasion as this, no information  should be withheld that might assist our investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do realize that, Inspector, and  I am entirely willing to tell you anything I know. As secretary, my post is a  sinecure, for since Mr Talbot retired from business, there is little clerical  work to be done. He has an agent who attends to the management of his  securities and such things. I have been in the habit of writing letters for  him, keeping his personal and household accounts and acting as go-between to  the numerous people who do not know him but continually write to him or try to  see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Talbot was a most generous  man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was, indeed. But his  benefactions were made with care and thought, they were not given out  indiscriminately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And could this at some time have  aroused someone to enmity, because of unsatisfied demands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could; but never to my  knowledge has it done so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anything, to your knowledge,  occurred, that could have made someone feel intensely angry with Mr Talbot, or  Mr Talbot with him, that might have led eventually to this tragedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black eyes were watching  Rudd&rsquo;s face with a hawk-like intensity, but they saw no hint of hesitation in  the blue eyes that met them squarely as Rudd said, firmly, &ldquo;Nothing,  Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But though Rudd showed no least  tremor of emotion at the question, Inspector Craven heard a sudden  irrepressible little gasp, and turned quickly to see Renny sobbing into a big  chiffon handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I w-wish you&rsquo;d st&mdash;top!&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it to hear you talking about my husband like that! He was a  perfect angel, he had no enemies, everybody loved him and he was good to  everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me more about him,&rdquo; said the  tactful Inspector, who was quick to see a chance. &ldquo;Tell me some little personal  things,&rdquo; his voice was gentle now. &ldquo;Did you give him a ring, when you were  married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Renny, surprised.  &ldquo;He gave me one. He didn&rsquo;t like rings on men, and yet he had one that he always  wore. He said it was his good luck piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind was it? Did he have it  on last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice, but he must have  had it on, he never takes it off. It is a scarab ring. It is set with a real  scarab, that he brought from Egypt himself. Rudd didn&rsquo;t like the ring, but I  did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you like it, Mr Rudd?&rdquo;  and Craven turned to him.</p>
<p>Rudd smiled a little. &ldquo;I suppose  it was prejudice,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It came from a king&rsquo;s grave, and I dislike those  dug-up treasures. And it is of an unpleasant greenish blue that suggests mold  and decomposition and&mdash;oh, well, I just didn&rsquo;t enjoy looking at it. But I didn&rsquo;t  really mind it. Several times Nick offered to leave it off, but I wouldn&rsquo;t let  him. Is it of importance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that Mr Talbot&rsquo;s ring was  not on his finger when he was found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very strange! that looks like  robbery, the thing was of value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange; we&rsquo;re hoping it&rsquo;s  a clue, but if so, it&rsquo;s a blind one. It seems to lead nowhere&mdash;as yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  Remsen Loses His Temper</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t a clue often blind at first,  and becomes more and more indicative as it is further investigated?&rdquo; Rudd  asked, speaking seriously. &ldquo;It does look like robbery, and yet, even though a  valuable antique, that would hardly be known to the average robber. And a man  who could realize the fact that it was an antique gem, would scarcely be in the  class of murderous bandits. Has the ring been found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and oddly enough, it was  found right in the place where Mr Talbot&rsquo;s body was lying. It must have been  under him when he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is really strange,&rdquo; Trask  declared. &ldquo;What do you make of it, Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is puzzling. If the killer  drew it from the dead man&rsquo;s finger it looks as if he was interrupted or  frightened before he could get away with it. Yet we know of no one who  witnessed the crime, or saw anyone trying to get the ring. I think we must  decide that the murderer did try to pull the ring off and did get it off, and  then was frightened and dropped the ring in panic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the ring mine?&rdquo; Renny asked,  with a wistful look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs Talbot, it will be  handed over to you later on, after we have made our investigations. Do you know  how Mr Talbot came by the ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, but I have always  supposed he bought it. He bought a great many things in Egypt, curios and such,  and I think this was just one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know there is an  inscription inside it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know that. What is  it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in old Egyptian text, and  it says&mdash;do you know what it says, Mr Rudd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr Talbot told me. He said  it is a good luck ring, and the legend inside is, roughly translated, &lsquo;Wear me  and be safe.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if someone translated  that for Mr Talbot and translated it wrongly, either in ignorance or on  purpose. For I have taken it to the Metropolitan Museum and had it translated,  and I am told on the highest and most impeccable authority, that the  translation is, &lsquo;Who weareth me will know violent death.&rsquo; It is hard to be  sure, but I think Mr Talbot believed the beneficent inscription, and that  later, only yesterday, in fact, he learned the true translation, and that being  attacked, he tried to get the ring off, and did so, but it was too late, and he  dropped the ring under him, where it was later found by the detectives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too dreadful,&rdquo; cried Renny,  who was sobbing in Byron&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell any more, I can&rsquo;t stand it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you may be excused, Mrs  Talbot, and your brother, too. I have your testimony, and if need be, I will  talk with you again. Mr Rudd, where were you when you first heard the news of  Mr Talbot&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detective Flint came in just then  and took a seat as he listened for Rudd&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just coming out of the  Cinema Room. No, I am not a Movie Fan, I seldom go to see them, but, as you  probably know, last night there was a showing of that new lighting effect, I  forget the name of it, but I am much interested in that sort of thing, and I  wanted to see it. I was there at the beginning and I stayed to the end. It was  a splendid exhibition. The place was crowded, although you had to have reserved  seats, and coming out we were in a regular jam. It was then that I heard  someone say that somebody had been killed. I didn&rsquo;t believe it at first, and  then I kept hearing more and more details, and at last I heard Nick&rsquo;s name  connected with it. Even then, I couldn&rsquo;t believe it was a true story, and I  pushed through the crowd and I ran into Trask, and he told me. But I knew Nick  had gone over to Mr Van Dusen&rsquo;s to see a rare coin he has just acquired. It was  almost time for Renny&rsquo;s character dance, and I knew Nick would be back in time  for that. You see, I just couldn&rsquo;t believe he was dead. Nobody seemed to know  anything about it, and nobody could answer my questions. Trask knew no more  than I did, positively; he had only heard wild reports and idle speculations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when Mr Appleton stood up on  a chair and told us the facts, I could doubt no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I thought. My  mind flew back to twenty years ago, when Nick and I first met. I&rsquo;m not going to  bore you with my life story, but when I was in the very depths of danger and  distress, Nicholas Talbot came to my aid and not only saved my life but my  honor, my reputation and my happiness. All I have and all I am I owe to him. It  would take too long to tell it, but Trask here, will vouch for my word and tell  you I speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, yes,&rdquo; Trask said. &ldquo;And  Rudd is too modest, he has done as much for Nick as Nick has for him. And if  ever there were two men, since the days of Damon and Pythias, who knew the  meaning of friendship in its last and best degree they are the men. I know, for  a fact, that either would have laid down his life for the other, and now such  an occasion can never happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caleb Rudd looked up with a sad  little smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t overdo it, Trask,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;It is true enough, Inspector, but one doesn&rsquo;t want it told with such emphasis.  I thank you, Trask, and if Nick were here he would agree to all you say. Now,  let us lay that aside, and turn our thoughts to the present. Ask me all the  questions you like, Inspector, disregarding what you have been told about my  friendship with Nick. If you want facts, I will say I sat in the cinema show,  from ten-thirty to eleven. I was in an end seat of the third row. I wanted to  be near, to see the lighting. It is a new and marvelous invention. As soon as  the show was over everybody rose, and of course, everybody tried to push out of  the doors at once. The result was a jam, which straightened itself out slowly  but surely. At first, I was trying to look for Nick; he is always getting lost  in a crowd, but as I heard what people were saying, and then heard what Mr  Appleton said, I put all my efforts toward finding out what I could about Nick,  and what had happened to him. I knew he had gone over to Van Dusen&rsquo;s to see a  coin, and I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking he was there yet and all this fuss was a  mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who spoke to you first about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appleton. I met him on the steps,  and he told me. I ran right back to where he said Nick was, and I saw him.  There were two policemen on guard, and I asked them a few questions, but they  knew nothing except that they had been told to stay there. I couldn&rsquo;t do  anything to help, so I went back to the Fair rooms, to see if I could do  anything for Renny. But Byron and Christine were with her, so she didn&rsquo;t need  me. I ran across Drew Remsen and Ruth Hanna. We fell a-talking, and I must say  Remsen showed real feeling and was genuinely sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t he be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh, well, he and Nick are not  exactly what you call hand and glove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mistake that speech,  Inspector,&rdquo; Renny said. &ldquo;There was a time when Nick and Drew weren&rsquo;t such awful  good friends, but they got over that and buried the hatchet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it much of a hatchet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Rudd, &ldquo;nothing that  couldn&rsquo;t be settled in a few minutes. Have you seen Remsen, Inspector? But he  wouldn&rsquo;t know anything more than anybody else. I think it&rsquo;s no use your  quizzing and questioning. Our Nick wasn&rsquo;t killed by any of his friends or foes  in his own set. He was done in by a wicked robber, and you ought to see that  yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see it myself,&rdquo;  said Inspector Craven.</p>
<p>Renny jumped up and stood before  him, her eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you believe my  husband was killed by someone he looked upon as a friend? Someone, perhaps in  this room? Someone he cared for and was loyal to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been, may it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! It may not! Have you lived  your sticky life without ever finding a friend, a dear friend, a devoted friend?  Do you believe such a one would kill you! Kill you for no reason whatever! No  one had any reason for killing Nicholas Talbot! There was no reason&mdash;there could  have been no reason, yet you sit up there and say, &lsquo;It may have been.&rsquo; Oh, I  hate you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudd went over and sat by Renny,  saying gently, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that, dear, about our Nick. Let us try to make  some plans. Can you think when you would want to have the funeral? I don&rsquo;t want  to grieve you, but if you could make a suggestion. Or would you rather see  Christine first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christine has nothing to say  about it. But I&rsquo;d like to see Byron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, Mrs Talbot, I must  ask you to postpone the making of your plans a little longer. I am a very busy  man, and I have given over this morning to these questions I want to ask of  you. I fear I must insist on taking your time for a while longer. As you may or  may not know, we detectives have to investigate certain points which we call  clues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know all about clues,  Inspector. Just ask me your questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; one of our most important  clues is Mr Talbot&rsquo;s ring. As you know I told you the inscription inside it  really reads, &lsquo;Who weareth me will know violent death.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember, but it doesn&rsquo;t  seem to matter to me. My Nick is dead, and I don&rsquo;t believe he died because he  wore a ring with a silly curse in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either, Mrs Talbot, but I  want to tell you more about the ring. Here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craven took from his pocket the  ring that had been worn for many long years by Nick Talbot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you carry it around like  that! Don&rsquo;t! You might lose it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t lose it. Now look at  it closely. You know how to open it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Just press the  spring&mdash;so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto! But there is another  spring that will open another hiding place. Do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there isn&rsquo;t any other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does anyone here know of another  secret place in the ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All said no, and the Inspector  then opened, by means of an even tinier spring, another cavity, which showed  some microscopic engraved words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can read this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; Trask declared, taking a  document microscope from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it out,&rdquo; Craven said, and  Trask obeyed. This message was not in Egyptian, but of a later date, and  engraved in exquisite Italian characters. He read it first in that language,  and was at once urged to put it in English.</p>
<p>Trask was a linguist, and he read  it out clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wear this ring until one you love  betrays you.&rdquo; Renny&rsquo;s eyes opened wide and then as suddenly closed and she  dropped her face on her crossed arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This discovery is of the gravest  importance, as you can all understand,&rdquo; the Inspector said. &ldquo;Mrs Talbot, does  it seem to you to indicate any one of your husband&rsquo;s best friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; and Renny raised  her head and looked at him with a quiet disdain. &ldquo;Mr Talbot did not know that inscription  was in the ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know he didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two reasons: one, because if  he had known it he never would have worn the ring, and the other because if he  had known of it he would have told me about it. My husband told me everything,  and we talked over everything together. And also, Mr Craven, there is what I  think is called internal evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just what do you mean by  that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that Mr Talbot was a man  of the highest honor and also of the most infinite loyalty. I am sure he did not  know of that second inscription. If he had known of it he never would have worn  the ring. For that second inscription would have implied to Mr Talbot that  someone he loved could betray him. This he would never allow; his faith in his  friends was so absolute, so perfect that to him that inscription would seem a  doubt, and he would have thrown the ring into the ocean before he would have  worn it. No, Nick never knew of that secret inscription, it was put there by  some previous owner of the ring, who knew little of love and loyalty. Of  course, it could have been that a lover gave it to his love, meaning that he  was the one she loved, and that &lsquo;until he betrayed her,&rsquo; meant never or the  same as eternity. But no true lover would word it that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know a lot about love, Mrs  Talbot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Renny, calmly, &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you have some discarded  lovers of whom Mr Talbot might have been jealous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I have.&rdquo; Renny was still  calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you name some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny opened her eyes very wide at  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose, Inspector, you  policemen have a textbook of some sort that tells you what you may and may not  do. Please bring it, next time you come and show me the rule that says you may  insult a lady, in her own home. Good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny walked, she didn&rsquo;t run, but  she was out of the room before Inspector Craven could get his mouth open for a  retort.</p>
<p>The Inspector cleared his throat  with a sound that definitely expressed his opinion of women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I would insult her, the  pretty little thing!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I know that even a bride may be subject to  the attentions of past lovers who are in depths of dark despair because she is  lost to them forever. And not infrequently the little bride is flattered by  these attentions and&mdash;the fat is in the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that cannot be said of  Renny,&rdquo; Rudd observed. &ldquo;She is staunch and loyal to her heart&rsquo;s core. I was  with them on their honeymoon, and Renny&rsquo;s devotion to her husband was a lovely  thing to see. Not that she ever paraded her affection or even showed her  happiness, but her every thought was for him or of him, and their love was  ideal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; Craven said,  &ldquo;that Mrs Talbot might kill her husband! I meant the rejected lover felt hatred  not toward the lady, but toward the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a situation often met in  song and story,&rdquo; Rudd said, &ldquo;but I think it is seldom found in conditions  today. The modern pair, if ill-assorted get a divorce or separation, but I have  never seen a case of murder because of incompatibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Trask agreed, &ldquo;and  the reason is, the modern young husband, if he finds he has drawn a blank, is  too wise to put the hangman&rsquo;s noose round his neck or to engage a reserved seat  up at Sing Sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of reserved seats, Mr  Rudd,&rdquo; said Craven, &ldquo;who sat next to you in the cinema theater, at the Fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea. He was a plump,  shortish man, who seemed greatly interested in the performance. We exchanged a  few words on the well arranged room and as to the wonder of the new light that  we were to see. He seemed rather scientific and used good language. And then  the show began and we talked no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you talk with him after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. We were separated in the  crowd, which had begun to be excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, we didn&rsquo;t get chummy  enough for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, then. Thank you, Mr  Rudd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Ashes To Ashes, Dust To Dust</b></h2>
<p>The funeral services for Nicholas  Talbot were carried out with the same dignified elegance and good taste as his  house was run.</p>
<p>Had he been there himself to look  after things, they could not have been more to his mind.</p>
<p>The flowers were of the best, yet  not too many nor of a fragrance too overpowering; the music was heavenly, and  by the best known artists; yet there were not too many numbers.</p>
<p>The services were stately, as  became a man of Talbot&rsquo;s worth and prominence.</p>
<p>And when it was over, and the  casket was sent away to be placed in the old family vault, the lawyer requested  them all to come and listen to the reading of the will.</p>
<p>It was a long process, for many  bequests and annuities were told of and many unexpected legacies were  announced.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Renny had never  heard the reading of a will.</p>
<p>Her short and irresponsible life  had seldom had occasion to come in contact with matters of business and not  often had she been called upon to make a decision of any importance.</p>
<p>It was with a feeling of curiosity  that she walked by Byron&rsquo;s side, and took the chair designated for her in the  library.</p>
<p>The lawyer, Mr Atwater, rather to  Renny&rsquo;s surprise, paid but slight attention to her; but this neither annoyed  nor offended her. The whole performance was a novelty to her, and she had but  slight interest in the matter.</p>
<p>Nor did she give much thought as  to what portion of Talbot&rsquo;s wealth should be bequeathed to her. She wanted to  live luxuriously, but she had little love of display, and, too, she felt that  whatever Nick had decided for her was unquestionably right.</p>
<p>She grew restless as she had to  listen to the long details of various bequests. It seemed to her that the  points need not have been set forth so fully, and she felt a longing to get out  of doors into the bright cold winter air.</p>
<p>There were Charitable  Institutions, Educational Fellowships and Religious Societies that all were  generously remembered, and it seemed to Renny that the instructions were so  definite and complete they could be used successfully by a schoolboy.</p>
<p>Many friends were given individual  gifts, of surprising size, and the little settlement of Banbury Gardens was  lavishly dowered.</p>
<p>And, then, when Renny felt she  could not keep awake any longer, she learned the final decrees.</p>
<p>After the household servants were  amply provided for, it was stated in the simplest terms, that such residuary  fortune as might be left of Nicholas Talbot&rsquo;s estate, should be apportioned  thus: One-half to his beloved wife, Renee Loring Talbot; one-quarter to his  cousin, Stephen Trask, and one-quarter to his dear friend, Caleb Rudd, whom he  had long held in deepest affection and respect.</p>
<p>The amounts represented by these  fractions were pretty well known to those in the room. After certain expenses and  taxes were paid, Renny would have well over twenty millions and the two men  each half of that.</p>
<p>Byron and Christine, who had each  had a pleasant remembrance, asked Renny to go home with them for dinner and she  agreed to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to decide what we are  going to do,&rdquo; Renny said, looking at Rudd and Trask. &ldquo;You two&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time enough, Renny,&rdquo; Rudd said,  &ldquo;to think of those things. Suppose we three just stay here as we are until we  get through with the police proceedings, which are not going to stop right  away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Rudd! Must that go on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you want it to,&rdquo; said  Rudd, very gently. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let our Nick go unavenged, if we can possibly help  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come along, now, Ren,&rdquo;  Byron said and it was odd to note the respect in his voice, since his sister  had become a lady of wealth and importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let&rsquo;s speak of it a little,&rdquo;  Rudd said, a quiver in his gentle voice. &ldquo;It seems to me, that time is of the  greatest value just now. We must push on the police work, or lose all we have  already done. Now, why can&rsquo;t we three live here for a while, just as we did  when Nick was with us. Mrs Golder would continue on as housekeeper, I&rsquo;m sure,  or if Renny would rather stay with her brother, Trask and I can carry on here.  Don&rsquo;t look like that, Renny, I only meant that it might be pleasanter for you  at the Lorings&rsquo; and I know you want the police work to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to do, Rudd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find the man who killed my  friend, and see to it that he pays the penalty for his crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that wouldn&rsquo;t bring Nick back  to us, so what good would it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the way you look at it,  it would do no good to you. But I feel differently about it. Would you rather  that I went to live in some other house&mdash;or at the Inn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think you can find  the criminal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can try, and I know I  am going to try. Oh, Renny, have you no heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t heart, that is only  wicked revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk that way,&rdquo; Byron said,  &ldquo;you know nothing about these things, and I think you&rsquo;d better come and stay  with us for a few weeks, and then I&rsquo;m sure I can teach you a little. Do come,  dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny opened her eyes at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Byron.  Please try to realize that I am no longer a child. I am a married woman, a  widow, and I have a right to live my life as I choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure have houses enough to  live in,&rdquo; Trask said. &ldquo;This one, the big apartment on Park Avenue, that  enormous Adirondack camp, the hunting box in Alabama, the dude ranch in  Wyoming, and each of them tops in every way! Now, it would be perfectly right  for you to go to&mdash; Gosh! I forgot the Florida house! You go there and take some  nice sweet lady with you, and stay two or three months. Then come back and pick  up your life and live it bravely and finely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve, you talk like a minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but when these shocks  come they make you feel as if you ought to be more like a minister. I wish I  could preach a sermon to you that would do you some good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem that I was the one  to be comforted&mdash; instead of that I just get scolded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Renny, we&rsquo;re not scolding  you,&rdquo; Rudd declared. &ldquo;Now, look here, use your common sense. Nick was my  dearest friend, and now that he has been taken from me I am going to try to  find the fiend who did it. If you or Trask or both will help me, I shall be  only too glad, if not I must go it alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how to do it?&rdquo; asked  Renny, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How to find him? I can only try.  But you know the first way is to find clues and find what they mean. We may get  some help that way and we may not. Then there is the police work. That is of  great help. But, it is difficult. It calls for skilled detectives and wide  experience. But the trick is to try all these ways one after the other. It will  be discouraging, but detective work is just one discouragement after another.  What say, Renny? Have I made it seem too hard? Do you want to try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made it seem pretty hard.  I don&rsquo;t mind hard work, but your discouraging songs are not pleasing to the  ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, child. We&rsquo;ll begin and  if we get on at all, you can come in. How&rsquo;s that, Trask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Rudd, I&rsquo;m no shirk,  but we don&rsquo;t know how to do this detective hodge-podge, and we&rsquo;d only waste our  time? Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to me. Nothing that I can do  to help find the villain who killed Nick is a waste of my time. But I&rsquo;m not  asking you. You do just as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Rudd,&rdquo; Byron  said, speaking slowly and thoughtfully. &ldquo;But you must realize that it isn&rsquo;t up  to you to say just what the proceedings shall be. A police case is managed by  the police, just as a legal case is managed by a lawyer or a theater by a  manager. You won&rsquo;t have to tell the police what to do, they&rsquo;ll tell you. Now,  I&rsquo;m going home. You coming, Christine? You, Renny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just then Flint, the young  Sergeant came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;do any of you  people know anything about knives? There&rsquo;s a man in the kitchen, not the  butler, an under-feller of some kind, and he says this is a perfectly good  knife and it has a coca-cola handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of lunatics make up  your staff, Renny?&rdquo; Byron asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the lunatic, By,&rdquo; and  Renny laughed at him. &ldquo;Let me see the knife, Mr Flint, please. Yes, this handle  is real cocobolo wood. It isn&rsquo;t rare, you know, but you don&rsquo;t always get the  real stuff. Did you find it in our kitchen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flint looked a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, ma&rsquo;am, I did. The cook  said it was just an old thing that had been there for years, but that it was a  good knife yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take it,&rdquo; said Rudd. &ldquo;Yes,  it&rsquo;s a cocobolo handle, all right, but you don&rsquo;t cut with the handle! What  about the blade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a stainless steel blade, I  know that,&rdquo; Christine offered proudly. &ldquo;Why are we making such a fuss over the  old thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; Flint said,  carelessly. &ldquo;Mrs Talbot, won&rsquo;t you come for a bit of a walk with me? It&rsquo;s  lovely, out in the sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to, Byron, touch that bell  for Minty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in a few minutes, Renny,  wearing a chinchilla wrap, with toque to match, was leading Flint through the  alleys of snow-laden conifers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful home,&rdquo; Flint was  saying, with sincere admiration, if not much originality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Renny said. &ldquo;Good  enough, of course, but wait till you see what I&rsquo;m going to build!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Modernistic jiggery-pokery, I  suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for that I shan&rsquo;t let you  ever see into the room that is going to be my very own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; if I shall never see  it, tell me a little about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little, then. The walls  will be of glass bricks and the furniture, gold lame, stretched over chromium  frames. Then a large, but low glass table, for books and flowers. You go in the  room through a thin black curtain, shot with gold&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you get out, that  would interest me more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that to be funny, but it  isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The room is, though. Now, Mrs  Talbot, we are not here to be funny and I am truly shocked that you talk and  act as gayly as you do. But never mind that. Is it true that you take no  interest in learning anything you can about that kitchen knife? Is it true that  you do not care whether it is the knife that killed your husband, or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not answer such useless  questions as that. If you want to ask me anything sensible, I will answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then. Did you ever see  that knife before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever go into your own  kitchen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been brought up to think  every woman should be the queen of her own kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s voice was so foolishly  scathing, that Flint wanted to laugh, but he had other questions to ask.</p>
<p>But Renny got ahead of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Mr Flint, what is  the first thing I am going to buy when I can get my money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly I do not; how could I  know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s going to be a rug of  ostrich feather and marabou. Won&rsquo;t that be beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You read about that in a book! I  read it in the same book. Why don&rsquo;t you get some original things. You read about  your glass room, too. Now, Mrs Talbot, do help me a little. Remember, to help  me is to help find the murderer of your husband. You are willing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed. But you ask such  foolish questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me something about Mr Rudd.  They have been friends a long time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I have never known such  devoted friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had similar tastes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Usually, not always. But they  just seemed to think whatever each other did was just right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think much about it.  They thought all I did was right, and that was enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you love your husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t know that  such questions are not asked. You are so very ignorant. But since you have  asked, I&rsquo;ll tell you that I did love him very much. He was very dear and lovable,  more so than strangers sometimes thought. And he was so good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you love Mr Rudd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me! Love Rudd!&rdquo; Renny&rsquo;s eyes  opened so wide that Mr Flint was frightened. He had never seen anything like it  before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, I pray. As you say, I don&rsquo;t  know much. I have gathered an idea somehow&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t know how&mdash;that young  ladies, even young married ladies, do love more than one man at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are things we don&rsquo;t talk  about in good society. Now, Mr Flint, you tell me things. Do you think you can  discover who killed Mr Talbot? Do you think Mr Craven can discover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I think it ought to be  known, I think we ought to find it out. And I think the murderer ought to be,  what do they call it? Electricated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you feel the murderer  should be punished. Why did you change your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t change my mind. You  misunderstood me. You mistook what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean when I thought you were  gay and thoughtless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I mean. And when  you thought I could love another man&mdash;beside my own beloved husband! Now, do you  think the police can solve the case, the police here in Westchester County? or  do you think we ought to have someone else; you know, the sort of smart ones  they have in the library books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sherlock Holmes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dated, isn&rsquo;t he? But I know  one, a real live one, that I can get, and nobody else can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Mr Stone. He has  solved wonderful cases. One was the Forrest case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Viv Forrest,&mdash;the fencing tragedy?  Yes, Stone&rsquo;s a great detective. But the police seldom invite a P. I. to work  with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a P. I.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private Investigator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see. I guess I spoke out of  turn! Forget it.&rdquo; </p>
<br>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  The Kitchen Knife</b></h2>
<p>As Sergeant Flint and Renny walked  back to the house, he said, a little abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your kitchens and  pantries and such places?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought you had just  visited them, looking over the knives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. But I want to go  again, and have you go with me. And I don&rsquo;t know the way from the outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, then; this way does  it. What do you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just try to find out more than I  did. I&rsquo;ll ask the questions, and you chip in, now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try. Here&rsquo;s the butler&rsquo;s  pantry, we&rsquo;ll go in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the second butler,  Johnson, on duty, and Flint began to question him about the knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you want me to tell  you, sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you on duty that night that  Mr Talbot died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I was on pantry duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what did you have to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make sure that every dish was  properly prepared and garnished before it was taken to the dining room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have occasion to use that  knife that Inspector Craven showed you this morning, and which belongs here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I did use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do with it after you  finished using it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queer thing, sir. It  disappeared, all of itself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you leave this pantry at  all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir; I was in and out,  and one time I went to pick it up from where I had left it, and it just wasn&rsquo;t  there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, are you sure that the knife  you are telling me disappeared, is the same knife that the Inspector showed you  this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, sir. I know it, because it  has brass rivets to hold the handle to the blade. We have no other knife just  like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an old knife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, but a better blade than  many of the new ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, from what you say, you must  assume that some person came in here and took the knife during one of the moments  you stepped out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to say that, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I didn&rsquo;t see anybody  coming or going, and I don&rsquo;t want to accuse anyone unjustly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accuse him of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, there is much talk in  the servants&rsquo; hall, and they do say that is the knife that Mr Talbot was killed  with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t take it out with you,  yourself, and leave it somewhere, unintentionally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Renny decided it was her turn  to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my advice on that question,  Johnson,&rdquo; she said, in a kind but decided manner. &ldquo;Say, yes, you could have  done that. For, you could, you know, even if you don&rsquo;t remember doing it, you  might have. And then you are accusing nobody in particular. But if you vow that  you didn&rsquo;t take it out, unthinkingly, then, you are accusing yourself, and I  know you are innocent, but you will get yourself in a lot of trouble. Isn&rsquo;t  that so, Sergeant Flint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want Johnson to tell the  truth, and if he doesn&rsquo;t remember taking the knife out of the room with him, I  doubt if he did take it, for he seems very clear-headed and honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. I can truly say I  did not take the knife out of the room with me&mdash;only, then how did it get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone else took it out,  Johnson,&rdquo; Renny said to him, &ldquo;and we have to find out who it was. Come on,  Sergeant Flint, we must report to the Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Renny&rsquo;s surprise, Craven  listened to her story of Johnson and the knife, with interest, but with no  great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked with that Johnson,  myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t think he had any hand in the murder nor any  reason for it. The whole staff of servants here are of long standing, and they  seem devoted to the master and mistress, and entirely obedient to Mrs Golder,  the housekeeper, who is, really the head of the house. The knife is doubtless  from the butler&rsquo;s pantry here, but to my mind that does not suggest a Talbot  servant as the criminal. Rather, indeed, the reverse. As to how the knife was  taken from the pantry and by whom, I wish we knew and the knowledge might or  might not be helpful, but we must get along without it. And I cannot feel that  a knife from the Talbot pantry implies a murderer from the Talbot household.  I&rsquo;m going over to see Van Dusen. He was the last, so far as I know, to see  Talbot alive, except, of course the murderer. Want to go, Trask? Rudd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men declined, but to  everybody&rsquo;s surprise, Renny said she would like to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought Nick went to see Mr  Van Dusen&rsquo;s old coin at the Library,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s at the house, I want  to go. I like Mrs Van Dusen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the house they were going  to, and Flint saw no objection to Renny&rsquo;s going too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get out of our house,  all I can,&rdquo; she said, as they went along. &ldquo;I feel so depressed in there. Mr  Rudd tries to be nice, but he bores me, and Mr Trask is just silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are severe,&rdquo; Craven told her.  &ldquo;I think they are two fine men, and I don&rsquo;t wonder Talbot liked them as  friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; Renny  said, &ldquo;but I just want to see some different people from them and my relatives  once in a while. There&rsquo;ll probably be some at the Van Dusens&rsquo;, there always  are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Van Dusen welcomed Renny  kindly, and Mrs Van Dusen was charming.</p>
<p>There were a few guests there, and  they all treated Renny with such gentle kindliness that she was glad she came.  She expected Christine would chide her when she heard of it, but she took the  chance.</p>
<p>Mr Van Dusen could give the  Inspector no news of Nick Talbot&rsquo;s last hour with him. He showed the old coin  and told how much Talbot was interested in it. But Talbot had interrupted his  talk about coins, to return to the Fair, where his wife was to give a solo  dance, which he must not miss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Mr Talbot wearing a bluish  green scarab ring!&rdquo; Craven asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I have never seen him  without that ring on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t look inside it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, somebody asked him to take it  off, and he said he would some other time, but just then he must hurry away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Renny said, &ldquo;he was  hurrying to see my dance. I was with Louis Alger and I had just told him it was  time for me to go to the stage, when we heard that awful man, a watchman or  something, telling everybody that Nick was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor dear child!&rdquo; and Mrs Van  Dusen put her arm round her.</p>
<p>She knew the girl was playing for  sympathy, but she had plenty and to spare, so she gave it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see Alger,&rdquo; Craven  broke in. &ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be over here soon,&rdquo; Van  Dusen said, &ldquo;any time now. He is more or less of a numismatist and he likes my  lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; asked Rip Harley,  who confessed openly to envy of Van Dusen&rsquo;s coins and curios. &ldquo;I say, Van, I  saw a marvelous cat&rsquo;s-eye the other night. Saw it on a chap&rsquo;s hand, at the  Fair. It was set in very heavy, plain old gold, splendid thing! Anybody else  would have mucked it up with a diamond or a couple of pearls. Wonder who he  was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he look like?&rdquo; Renny  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tall, heavy, rather like one of  the less celebrated presidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With kindly black eyes?&rdquo; Renny  asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so; but I couldn&rsquo;t  tell much about his looks as I sat next to him in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Craven looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you in that new-fangled  cinema show at the Fair?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where we were. I  didn&rsquo;t know the man&rsquo;s name, don&rsquo;t know it yet, but he had on that wonderful  ring, a real cat&rsquo;s-eye, and I only had a glimpse of it before the lights were  put out. When the lights were on again, and we were coming out, it was too  crowded to see anything. And then, too, we heard, just then, about the awful  tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo; asked Craven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody and everybody, Inspector;  we asked people and received no answers. Of course we were separated at once by  the crowd, and I never saw my cat&rsquo;s-eye man again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he must have been Mr  Rudd,&rdquo; Renny told him; &ldquo;a great friend of Mr Talbot&rsquo;s and mine, and who lives  with us. He does look like one of the old presidents, it&rsquo;s Franklin Pierce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. I recognize the  likeness now you name it. And you know the history book says, &lsquo;Franklin Pierce  was handsome, graceful, well-dressed and a notable orator.&rsquo; I think he was the  Clark Gable of his day; his picture looks like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Mr Rudd all this, it  ought to make him vain, but it won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Renny said, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let me take you home, it&rsquo;s  getting late anyhow, and then perhaps I can see that ring again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try it, if you like, but  he may not be at home. If he is home, though, he&rsquo;ll be wearing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; and soon the two were  walking together like old friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I get to be elderly, I&rsquo;m  going to set up a ring,&rdquo; Harley told her. &ldquo;Of course, everybody hates jewelry  on men, but a ring, in later life, is, I think, permissible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine, dignified ring,&rdquo; Renny  agreed, &ldquo;yes. My husband wore a scarab. But it was a very valuable one, a  historic gem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Inspector has it. You see, it  was found under Mr Talbot, and I believe that makes it a clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found under him? You don&rsquo;t mind  speaking of it, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not to you. How could that  make it a clue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if it does, really. But  if there was robbery, why would the thief leave the ring? Was anything else  taken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nothing. That&rsquo;s what bothers  the Inspector so. I can understand it, but they won&rsquo;t accept my theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your theory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That somebody wanted that ring,  and struggled with my husband to get it, and did get it off, but Mr Talbot  fought for it, and then the thief stabbed him, and he fell, and died, right on  the ring. The thief, frightened, ran away&mdash;maybe he heard someone coming&mdash;he must  have been scared off, because he left the knife in the wound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was stabbed in the neck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in the corroded artery, or  something like that. Here we are, let&rsquo;s go in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found Rudd in a glass sun  porch, and Renny introduced her new friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since your ring is a cat&rsquo;s-eye, I  could see it in the dark,&rdquo; Harley said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like to see it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; and Rudd drew the  ring from his finger. &ldquo;It is a fine specimen, not of any stupendous money  value, but unusual in its opalescent reflections, like those of a cat&rsquo;s eyes.  Turn it slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fascinated with the stone, Harley  turned it and moved it from side to side admiring its coruscations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it made of?&rdquo; asked Renny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a chrysoberyl found in Brazil  and Ceylon, which when properly cut has great chatoyancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you talk like that I&rsquo;m going  away! What is chatootlecy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expose your ignorance,&rdquo;  Rudd said, grinning at her, &ldquo;chatoyancy is a play of colors or lusters seen in  real cat&rsquo;s eyes in the dark, or in some sorts of silks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then I know. You mean  changeable silks. They don&rsquo;t have them now, but I have an old dress that was  grandmother&rsquo;s, made of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flint had lost no time in telling  the Inspector about the man who sat next to Rudd at the Cinema, and with equal  despatch, Craven had learned where Rip Harley could be found, and he at once  betook himself to the Talbot house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m checking up a little,&rdquo; he began,  &ldquo;as to where everybody was at the time of Mr Talbot&rsquo;s death. I&rsquo;m rather hoping  you two can tell me of seeing somebody besides one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor place to see anyone, in that  Cinema show,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harley reminded him. &ldquo;I doubt if I  should have noticed my next seat neighbor, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for his ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were the seats reserved?&rdquo; asked  Craven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rudd told him, &ldquo;mine was C-1,  I chose a near position so I could see the new process lighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I had the next seat, C-3,&rdquo;  Harley said. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t choose it, for I know little about lighting  processes. I took that seat because it was the only decent one left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you your seat-check stubs?&rdquo;  Craven asked, casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and Rudd looked  surprised. &ldquo;I usually stuff them in my pocket. Probably it&rsquo;s there yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have mine,&rdquo; Harley said. &ldquo;I  generally keep the things for a time&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why&mdash;but I&rsquo;m methodical that  way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have them both to add  to my collection,&rdquo; the Inspector smiled. &ldquo;No hurry about it, hand them to me  any time. As I see it then, you two alibi each other. Mr Rudd, you can swear  that Mr Harley sat by your side all through the cinema show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can most certainly do that. We  didn&rsquo;t talk any, for there was no intermission. But Harley was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Mr Harley, can vouch for  Mr Rudd&rsquo;s continual presence beside you, all during the show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Inspector. And I can tell  you that my attention to the performance was greatly interrupted by my frequent  glances at his cat&rsquo;s-eye ring. The place was not pitch dark all the time, it  had lighted moments now and then, and on those occasions I feasted my eyes on  the beautiful gem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudd had quietly sent a servant to  bring the ticket stub from his waistcoat pocket, and now it was brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are, Inspector,&rdquo; Rudd  said, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a wonder the thing hasn&rsquo;t been thrown away. I very seldom keep  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that you get mine,&rdquo;  Harley promised.</p>
<p>He rose to go home, and, still  holding the cat&rsquo;s-eye ring, he said to Rudd, &ldquo;You have given me great pleasure,  and I thank you.&rdquo; He then returned the ring to its owner, politely took leave  of Renny and the rest, and went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too short for his weight,&rdquo;  commented Flint, as Harley could be seen walking down the path, &ldquo;but I hear  he&rsquo;s a most clever electrician. They say he had lots to do with the arranging  of that show, yet he never put in a bid for praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like him,&rdquo; said Renny. &ldquo;He said  Rudd is handsome, graceful and well-dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said Rudd, gravely,  &ldquo;the truth is not to be spoken at all times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  Renny Accepts The Situation</b></h2>
<p>The dull days dragged along. Renny  mourned for Nick Talbot, in a perfunctory sort of way, more because she thought  she ought to do it, than because of deep grief.</p>
<p>She had loved Nick, because he was  so good to her, and let her have her own way in everything. But she was not  inconsolable. She only wished the time would come when she could do as she  liked, do as other people did, and be part of the world again. She had to obey  Christine in these matters, for Byron told her she must do so.</p>
<p>She had referred the question to  Rudd, hoping he would be more lenient, but he was of no help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I  know just how you feel, how you are restless and need distraction. But, just  now, you must really watch your step. The eyes of your friends are upon you, so  are the eyes of society. You cannot ignore these. To arouse criticism just now,  would spoil your whole life, injure your good reputation. You must content  yourself with simple pleasures and do nothing conspicuous. But, good gracious,  Renny! think how young you are! Only twenty, and after a year or less, you can  return to your beloved gayeties and vanities. I suppose you don&rsquo;t miss Nick at  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudd said this so simply and  sincerely, she answered him in the same way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. I loved Nick very  much&mdash;you know that; but now he is gone and it is because I miss him so, that I  am so miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudd pretended belief. &ldquo;Yes, of  course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish I could do something to amuse you. Do you think  Christine would let me take you to New York some night, to a show or a club?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know she wouldn&rsquo;t. And,  too, Rudd, there are those tiresome police people. They&rsquo;re popping in and out  all the time. When will they let up on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until they consider the case  finished. Be careful what you say to them, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? I haven&rsquo;t done  anything wrong! I&rsquo;m not afraid of the police!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not; but try to have a  little sense! You know that everybody in this house will be suspected, or, at  least questioned. They&rsquo;re not through quizzing you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you talking seriously, Rudd?&rdquo;  Renny suddenly looked at him in a sort of horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. The widow of a rich  man is always a suspect, and next come his friends and his housemates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you and Steve are in it with  me,&rdquo; she said, carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frivolous about it; we  do not have to be guilty to be suspected, you know, and to be put through very  dreadful experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t frivol. Say, Rudd, do  you think anybody else, outside this house could be suspected? Innocent, of  course, but&mdash;like you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Renny, that could easily  come to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat up straight in her chair,  and assumed a new dignity.</p>
<p>Her black frock with white facings  was very becoming to her, and her cheeks reddened as she tried to say what was  in her mind.</p>
<p>But she failed to utter a word and  Rudd helped her out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you thinking of anyone in  particular, dear? But I know you are. And let me give you one piece of most  serious counsel. If your name and that of Andrew Remsen come into this thing  together, you will face grave disaster. Keep away from him, dear child, I beg  of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny tried to speak  independently, but her voice trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect to see him, Rudd;  I haven&rsquo;t seen him since the&mdash;the night of the Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you mustn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re a child  in many ways, Renny, but you must understand the danger of any gossip about you  two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens and earth, Rudd! You  don&rsquo;t think either he or I killed Nick, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t! But there may  be people who do think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police?&rdquo; Renny spoke in a  scared whisper. &ldquo;They have the notion in their mind already. They are watching  both you and Remsen. I think you&rsquo;d better know this, so I tell you frankly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Drew knows it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knows what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the police suspect him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say they suspect him; if  they did, they&rsquo;d probably arrest him. I said the notion was in their mind. It&rsquo;s  up to him&mdash;and you&mdash;to see it doesn&rsquo;t go any further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Byron is going to try to persuade  them to let me go away for a time, to California, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, because I&rsquo;d have to go with  Christine. I&rsquo;d like to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear that couldn&rsquo;t be managed.  And I doubt Craven would let you go so far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They separated then, and Renny  drifted into the pleasant sun parlor, and threw herself in a long basket chair.</p>
<p>Rudd had frightened her, as he  meant to do, for it was true that even in the restricted social district of  Banbury Gardens, there were certain beautiful ladies and a few well-dressed  men, who would be quite ready to blow at a little flame started by a hint that  now Renny was free, rich and nearly twenty-one. Or, even a hint that Drew&rsquo;s  engagement to Ruth Hanna had not been actually announced.</p>
<p>Renny thought little of public  criticism, but just now, she was suffering from some very real pangs of  remorse.</p>
<p>She was remembering distinctly one  night in Mexico, when she had promised Nick she would never voluntarily see  Remsen again, and also, that she would never think of him.</p>
<p>She remembered how serious Nick  was and how he believed her promise.</p>
<p>But&mdash;a promise to a dead man&mdash;did  that count?</p>
<p>For Renny had been thinking a  great deal of Drew Remsen, of late, and she had been thinking, too, of almost  the last words she had heard him say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must and will have you, Renny,  no matter what I do to get you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was before Mr Appleton  had made the announcement of Nick&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t believe for a minute&mdash;of  course she didn&rsquo;t &mdash;that Drew would do anything of that sort, but he had spoken  in such a tense, desperate voice, that it had frightened her at the time and  ever since.</p>
<p>Had anybody overheard those words?  There were so many people about, so many temporary dressing rooms and cubicles  put up for the actors and dancers&mdash;but no, she was right there herself, and she  saw no one near.</p>
<p>Could Rudd suspect Drew? No, Rudd  was too guileless himself and too generous-minded to think such a thing. Rudd  had an angelic temperament and never believed evil of anybody. But in case of  Nick! That would be quite different! Yes, indeed, if Rudd had the least suspicion  that Remsen had done any harm to Nick&mdash;to Nick, of all people in the world, then  Rudd would have ferreted out the truth.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was doing so. Perhaps  that was why he warned Renny about any association of her name with Drew&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She heard her name spoken, in a  light, careless voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Renny! May I come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Remsen, at the door, which  was on the latch, as always, and he was coming in.</p>
<p>Renny always thought quickly. Now  she remembered Christine had told her that when she met Remsen, as she must,  sooner or later, to treat the meeting lightly. To be polite, but not chummy,  gracious but not over cordial.</p>
<p>And now the time had come, and  Renny obeyed Christine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, Drew. Yes, come in, of  course, I expect my friends to call on me. How are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had left the basket chair and  now sat gracefully straight in a smaller porch chair.</p>
<p>She scarcely dared look at him, he  was so like the old Drew she had known so long. That hectic few minutes at the  Fair, they had both been in fancy costumes, and seemed like different people.</p>
<p>But she conquered her excitement,  and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get awfully tired of the house,  but Christine won&rsquo;t let me go anywhere. So I take it in my stride. Of course,  I&rsquo;ve lots to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Renny dear. And how are  things going? Any new developments? Are you bothered much by the Force?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they come and go. I like Mr  Flint; and I like the Inspector, too, but he hasn&rsquo;t much sense of humor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if they study it in their  curriculum. Yes, Flint&rsquo;s a bright boy, but he hasn&rsquo;t got anywhere yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can he? He can&rsquo;t find  any&mdash;what do you call &rsquo;em&mdash;clues?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what always stumps the  police people. They say clues do no good, and then when they can&rsquo;t find any  they growl&mdash;oh, Renny, what made you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Renny jumped to her feet and  stood staring at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; he understood, &ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t mean why did you kill Nick, but why did you marry him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you know,&rdquo; she said in a  low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for money and position.  Well, you have them, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What use are they to me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to bluff me. You don&rsquo;t  mean that without Talbot his worldly goods are of no use to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I mean.&rdquo; Renny  began to lose her self-control. &ldquo;But I am not happy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you aren&rsquo;t, just now.  But the clouds will lift, and the skies will brighten, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny was determined she would not  look at him, but her cast down eyes, and the long lashes trembling on her  cheeks proved too much for Remsen, and after a silent instant she was in his  arms, shaking with mingled happiness and fear.</p>
<p>Then her senses returned, she  said, sharply, &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; and his arms fell at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t be fools, Drew,&rdquo; she  said, with a sad little smile, &ldquo;and if I&rsquo;m the only one with wisdom, I must use  it for us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do love me!&rdquo; he whispered.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told me now, and nothing else matters. Tell me you&rsquo;ll marry me some  day, far away though it may be, but some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew, you&rsquo;re crazy! Don&rsquo;t talk  like that. And straighten yourself out, you&rsquo;re all frowsy looking.&rdquo; She ran her  fingers through his tousled hair, and he gave her a warning look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That way madness lies,&rdquo; he said,  softly. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go home now, and come again soon. Better so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But wait just a minute. No,  don&rsquo;t touch me. Listen. Drew, there are people in the town or in the police or  both, who think that either you or I killed Nick. Don&rsquo;t rage, I&rsquo;m telling you  so you can think it over and remember it, when&mdash;well, remember it all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remsen went off without another  word, and Renny watched him as he walked down the path. How fine he looked,  upright, honorable, manly&mdash;yet, was he these things?</p>
<p>In her heart she felt that he was;  that he had always loved her and only her, and that now she was free to be his&mdash;</p>
<p>Free? Was either of them free?  Both were in danger of accusation of crime, both were in honor obliged to  consider Ruth Hanna, both&mdash;</p>
<p>Renny turned round and picked up  the morning paper, which she had been reading when Drew came. In a few moments  she threw it down again, and went to her own private telephone. A very short  conversation ensued, and then she rang for Minty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to New York on an  errand,&rdquo; she said to the girl. &ldquo;Call Doane, and tell him to have my little car  round in fifteen minutes. You will go with me. Give me something all black, but  pleasing to the eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minty always understood Renny&rsquo;s  dress requirements, and within twenty minutes they were on the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are probably followed,&rdquo; Renny  said, to her chauffeur, &ldquo;but it is all right.&rdquo; She gave the address and then  sat in thoughtful silence, until the car stopped at the city home of Fleming  Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay in the car, with Doane,  Minty,&rdquo; Renny said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea how long I shall be here. Keep within call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ushered into Stone&rsquo;s reception  room, she found him waiting there for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Talbot,&rdquo; he said, his keen gray  eyes looking pleased at the simplicity of Renny&rsquo;s appearance and manner. &ldquo;What  can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can save me, I hope,&rdquo; she  said, without a hint of theatricalism. &ldquo;I am accused, or soon shall be, of a  crime of which I am entirely innocent. I want you to prove my innocence. I know  you can prove it, because it is true, and I will help you all I can. But I am  ignorant and inexperienced in these matters and I know you are the greatest  authority. You have read, perhaps, of the death of Nicholas Talbot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs Talbot, I have. What do  you mean, exactly, when you say you are accused?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, that while the police  have not as yet arrested me, or even hinted at such a thing, I know it is in  their mind, and soon the blow will fall. Mr Stone, I did not kill my husband,  but I cannot expect you to believe my word. If I had killed him, of course, I  should say I had not. That is plain common sense. I have no witnesses, and  there is a clue that is against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without staring, Stone watched her  very closely. This seemed to him a new opening, and he was interested. &ldquo;Will  you explain your reference to a clue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he was killed with a knife  from our kitchen, a knife I like to use, and, though I denied knowing the  knife, I am sure they will find that out. But there is much to be told, and if  you cannot take the case, I ought not to impose upon your time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny then opened her eyes at him,  not wide, but just the right distance, and thereby won the day.</p>
<p>Fleming Stone had never before  been offered such an argument as a beautiful young widow, accused of murdering  her husband, calmly stating her innocence and apologizing for the intrusion on  his time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your husband was older than you?&rdquo;  he asked, looking thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, about twice as old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, there is a young lover in  the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he was there before I  married Mr Talbot. I do not think he is the murderer, but if I did think so, I  should say I didn&rsquo;t. Wouldn&rsquo;t anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people, I think. I will take  your case, Mrs Talbot. May I come tomorrow, and stay somewhere near you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come tomorrow, and stay in my  house. Good afternoon, Mr Stone.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  Fleming Stone Takes The Case</b></h2>
<p>Fleming Stone came the next day in  time for lunch.</p>
<p>Rudd met him, and then Mrs Golder  took over and saw to it that he was settled in properly, and in due time he  went down to the morning room and joined the others at cocktails.</p>
<p>Stone was an affable sort and made  friends with the greatest of ease.</p>
<p>There was no reference made to the  reason for his being there until luncheon was over, and they all sat in the big  living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we needn&rsquo;t go over what  is sometimes called the history of the case,&rdquo; he said, looking at Renny, as at  his principal. &ldquo;I have read the details, of course, and while they were  probably not entirely true, as stated, they do not interest me so much as your  own personal beliefs and opinions. I should like to begin with a  straightforward question. Will you each tell me, honestly, who you think is the  most likely person or persons to suspect. I know this sounds crude, but it will  give me a starting-point, and may lead to some discoveries. Mrs Talbot, will  you answer first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought from the  beginning, and still think that Mr Talbot was not killed by anyone of his own  class&mdash;his own associates. I think some low-down, wicked enemy did it. I know  little about Mr Talbot&rsquo;s business affairs, but I do know he has had some  disgruntled men to deal with, who refused to meet his terms. Mr Rudd can tell  you all these things, but I know that my husband realized that his life was in  danger, yet he would not&mdash;would not&mdash;oh, what do I mean to say, Rudd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you mean that Nicholas  Talbot would meet demands of justice, but he would not make further concessions  than he deemed right, because of veiled threats that were made against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think, Mrs Talbot, that  at last one of these threats was carried out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr Stone, I do; not because  I know of any definite instance, but because the explanation is plausible; and  to imagine for a moment that Nick was killed by someone of his friends or  acquaintances is out of the question. He was a most friendly man. Always square  and very generous. But you know all this. You asked my opinion and I have given  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs Talbot, and thank you.  Your husband was much older than yourself, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was forty and I am  twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he been married before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; his first wife died  before I was born.&rdquo; Concealing his surprise, Rudd looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that, Renny?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could have told me but Nick?  Of course, he told me. But Byron knew it before. I mean, before we were  married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Mrs Talbot,&rdquo; Stone went  on, &ldquo;when did you see Mr Talbot last, alive? I am sorry to ask you these  questions, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s what you are here for;  yes, I know, Mr Stone, and it&rsquo;s all right. I want to help you all I can. I  never know anything about time, but that night we all went over to the Fair  together, I mean, Mr Rudd and Mr Trask and Nick and myself. Well, almost as  soon as we got there I had to get dressed for my Mexican dance. It takes quite  a time to fix it and I couldn&rsquo;t dress before I left here. The drive over would  have quite spoiled the freshness of the costume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. So you separated from your  party almost at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Mr Trask had to get into his  Mexican rig, too, we were to dance together. I went off to the ladies&rsquo; dressing  room, leaving Nick with the other men, and &mdash;and that was the last time I saw  him alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s voice failed her, and  Trask took up the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went then, too. The men&rsquo;s  dressing rooms were in a separate building, and as I went off I heard Nick tell  Rudd that he was going&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you tell what he said, Mr  Rudd,&rdquo; Stone suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Talbot said to me that he  was going to run over to Mr Van Dusen&rsquo;s to see the wonderful old Greek coin  that he has just acquired. Talbot had thought the coin would be exhibited at  the Library, but he found it was at the Van Dusen house, and that was only a  few steps. He said he would have ample time to go there and be back for Renny&rsquo;s  dance. I was anxious to see the cinema show that was on at the same time, so  Nick hurried off to go to the Van Dusen house and I went at once to the cinema  show. I had a reserved seat, and I reached it just as the show began. You see  that gave Talbot nearly half an hour for his run over to Van Dusen&rsquo;s, and Renny  half an hour to do her dressing, and me half an hour for the show. I mention  these as it may help you with your timetable. I don&rsquo;t know where Trask was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am very glad to get some  stated times, for most people have small notion of when anything happens. Where  were you, Mr Trask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dancing on the general dance  floor. I can tell you the names of the girls I danced with but I have no idea  of the time. Next thing I knew was the announcement of Mr Talbot&rsquo;s death, by Mr  Appleton, who stood on a chair and told the news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall see Mr Appleton, of  course. And other members of the Club. And Mrs Appleton and some other ladies  of the committees. As you must see, there is much to be done. This is what is  called a widespread case. A close case is where the murder is committed in a  house with few inmates&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or in a locked room,&rdquo; said Trask,  speaking seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, those conditions make it  easier, as a rule. Now, tell me please, somebody, where was Mr Andrew Remsen at  this time we are speaking of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glance Stone threw at the men  did not leave him unaware of the sudden and vivid blush that stained Renny&rsquo;s  face.</p>
<p>Both Rudd and Trask sat silent,  and in a moment Renny spoke, with a slight tremor of embarrassment. &ldquo;I had help  with my dressing and was ready a little sooner than I expected. I stepped outside  the dressing room, and I saw Mr Remsen there. I said only a few words to him,  for several men came up and asked me to dance. I did dance a little with Mr  Alger, and it was while I was with him that we heard Mr Appleton&rsquo;s  announcement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Remsen was not with you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know where he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence then, and  after a moment Stone said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw in some paper a reference  to a ring that Mr Talbot was in the habit of wearing. I should like to be told  about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you,&rdquo; said Rudd,  seeing that Renny&rsquo;s calm was really disturbed. &ldquo;Talbot had a valuable bluish  green scarab ring. He almost always wore it, but of late it seemed a little  loose on his finger, and he sometimes left it off, saying he must have it  looked after by a jeweler. He wore it to the Fair, and it was found under his  dead body. This does not seem strange, when we know the ring was a little  loose. It may be that the murderer undertook to steal the ring, and was  frightened away and dropped it, or there may have been a tussle between Nick  and his attacker, and the ring just slid off his finger. I can&rsquo;t see that the  ring is a clue in any way, but if you can, Mr Stone, do tell us what you see in  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much at present, Mr Rudd, but  I like to get my facts together and then sort them out and see what I can make  them mean. And Mrs Talbot, perhaps you will tell me about the knife that you  consider a clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I will.&rdquo; Renny was quite  herself again. &ldquo;The knife is not here, the police people have it. But it is  just an ordinary kitchen carving knife, a slicer. It is always very sharp,  because it takes a keener edge than some of the others do. I always use it,  when I have anything to do in the kitchen. By the way, Mr Stone, I don&rsquo;t always  tell the truth, you know. I do on important matters or to important people. But  I told that silly young Flint inquisitor that I never went in my own kitchen.  Really, I often do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you tell him that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he would harp on the  knife, and it is a waste of time to harp on that knife. It is our kitchen  knife, and if it was used to kill Mr Talbot, then it was taken from my kitchen  for the purpose. Now, if that is so then that kitchen knife is an important  clue, one worthy the attention of you or some other real detective, and not one  to be fiddled with by young Mr Flint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone looked at Renny a moment,  then he said, &ldquo;You were wrong to tell a lie to the police. It should not be  done. But I will admit that I shall be glad to take over the matter of the  knife by myself. It may mean nothing in particular and it may mean a great  deal, but I hope to find out. Am I to hope you propose to tell me the truth&mdash;in  important matters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to. If I didn&rsquo;t, I  know you would worm it out of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I should. Mr Rudd, you are  wearing an unusual ring. Is it historic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But it is a fine specimen of  cat&rsquo;s-eye.&rdquo; Rudd took it off and passed it over to the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed it is. A gift?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, from Nick Talbot. If you  care to hear it, some time I will tell you the tale of our friendship, but now,  I will only say that we have been friends for more than twenty years, and  without a break. Even when he took unto himself a wife, it didn&rsquo;t upset things,  did it, Renny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Rudd; but then I am a very  nice person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truetalk, my child. But what am I  going to do with you now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I shall have to go back  to my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudd smiled to himself; he well  knew this was the very last plan she would follow. And he knew, too, they must  separate. Renny, with her wealth and position could now make her life what she  wished it to be, and, naturally there would be no place in it for Caleb Rudd.</p>
<p>He was going to miss Nick very  much. They had been friends in every sense of the word, and now he must find  new interests. But time enough for those thoughts; there was much to be done  first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t asked you much, Mr  Trask,&rdquo; Stone was saying, when Rudd brought his thoughts back to the present  situation. &ldquo;I believe you now represent the head of the Talbot family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so; that is, if  there is any family and if it has any need for a head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no relatives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None nearer than some far distant  cousins, farther distantly removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The late Mr Talbot was fond of  you, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He liked me well enough, and I  liked him. He was really a topping good fellow, but he seldom let himself go.  He was not exactly selfish, but self-centered. If he had Renny and Rudd with  him, I think he would never have cared to see anyone else. I don&rsquo;t mean this  against him, I only mean he was no mixer. He was a good sport, he liked to  travel, he liked to go to places that he liked to go to, but he was indifferent  to most things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I gathered much of that from  the stories I read in the news. Now, as to his papers, I may say private papers  and important documents, they are in his lawyers&rsquo; hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr Stone,&rdquo; Caleb Rudd  answered, &ldquo;they are all here in this house, and in my charge. They are at your  disposal whenever you want them and also ready for examination, if desired, by  Nick&rsquo;s lawyers, the firm of Barnes and Barnes. You see, I am really his  confidential secretary as well as his private secretary, and he had no secrets  from me. Nor from anyone. His books and papers can be easily looked over by  expert accountants, if advisable, all, of course, under the management of  Barnes and Barnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the firm,&rdquo; Stone said,  &ldquo;and, of course, Mr Rudd, I have no occasion to inquire into those matters  unless they should in some way affect my own work, which is simply and solely  to discover who is responsible for the death of Nicholas Talbot. So far I see  no reason to assume a motive which has any connection with financial affairs,  but, of course, some such theory may present itself. Just now, I want to become  acquainted with those nearest to Mr Talbot in his daily life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right here,&rdquo; Renny  said. &ldquo;Nick had other acquaintances, but no other close friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I begin to realize that. And  from what you have all told me, I am forming a picture of the man in my mind,  which I daresay is not far from the truth. Would it surprise you very much if I  said I would like to meet Mr Loring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny opened her eyes wide at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Byron!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why, of course  you can meet him, whenever you like. He knows nothing about Nick, and he knows  nothing about Nick&rsquo;s death&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he knows something about  you,&rdquo; Stone smiled at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not as much as these  people here do. And not nearly as much as I know about myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can well believe that,&rdquo; Stone  spoke decidedly. &ldquo;I realize already that you know yourself very well indeed, which  is far from being the case with everybody. Shall we take a walk over to your  brother&rsquo;s right now? Or would you rather someone else showed me the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; and Renny&rsquo;s voice,  though sweet and affable as ever, had a new note in it.</p>
<p>As was his intention, Fleming  Stone had his way, and they started on the short walk to the Loring house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is it  about your brother that you don&rsquo;t like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny gave him a comprehending  glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wife,&rdquo; she replied calmly.  &ldquo;You see, Byron and I could get along beautifully if it were not for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What type is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise and handsome. Critical and  dictatorial. Resentful of my unwillingness to obey her advice, and&mdash;envious of  my wealth and position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly put. I&rsquo;ll see if I think  it is correct. Now, listen, and obey my advice. I want to have a pleasant, and  straightforward interview with your brother and his wife, and I want you to  show interest and take part in the conversation, but&mdash;&rdquo; he turned to look at the  lovely face of his companion, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny looked straight ahead, and  was silent for a moment. Then she smiled a little, and giving him a look of  perfect understanding, she said, quietly, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. And &mdash;thank you, Mr Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And soon they turned in at the  entrance to the Loring house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  Facts And Fancies</b></h2>
<p>Byron was cordial in his greeting  of Fleming Stone; Christine not quite so much so.</p>
<p>It jarred on her ideas of  fashionable conduct to have a Detective calling upon her. She was polite, but  her manner was a little distant, and she looked out of the window when she  should have been looking at her visitor.</p>
<p>Byron, however, made up for her  lack of attention. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve come, Mr Stone,&rdquo; he said, sincerely. &ldquo;If  anybody can get my sister out of this fix, you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to say Mrs Talbot  is in a fix,&rdquo; Stone returned. &ldquo;She is certainly in trouble and in grief, but  not in difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know all there is  to know.&rdquo; Byron was an outspoken sort. &ldquo;To be sure, there has been no definite  accusation, but I have heard hints and murmurs of suspicion that are far from  agreeable to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, since you have mentioned  them, you will tell me what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Byron,&rdquo; said Christine, &ldquo;you  wanted to tell these things to Mr Stone, and now you have a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, Stone&mdash;and Renny  can hear this, too.&rdquo; Loring looked at his sister with affection but also with  reproach. &ldquo;As you may or may not know, Mrs Talbot threw over another suitor  when she accepted Nick Talbot. The other suitor, Remsen, greatly resented this,  and it has pleased some people in this community to say that his resentment  rose to such a height that he may properly be considered as the criminal in the  case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are making very grave  assertions, Mr Loring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make no assertions, Mr Stone,  except to say that I have heard those hints from members of our community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the hints, as you call them,  were definite enough, should you not have reported them to the police? The  retaining of important knowledge is a dangerous thing in a murder case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t knowledge!&rdquo;  Christine said, quickly. &ldquo;It was the merest suggestion that because Mr Remsen  had been a friend of Renny&rsquo;s, he might have killed the man she married. A most  ridiculous idea, you must admit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ridiculous isn&rsquo;t the word,  Christine,&rdquo; Renny said, quietly. &ldquo;It is a wrong statement, and a wicked one for  anyone to make, for Mr Remsen is engaged to Ruth Hanna, a lovely girl, whom I  know very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard they were engaged,&rdquo; and  Byron looked deeply distressed. &ldquo;If so, that makes the matter all the worse. I  know Remsen, and he is a wild, impulsive sort, and has always been in love with  Renny. When she married, he took up with Ruth Hanna, but as soon as Renny came  back here&mdash;look here, Mr Stone, I am not telling you these things as facts, I am  letting you know about them so that you can make your investigations. Don&rsquo;t  cry, Renny, nobody is blaming you. But if there is any suspicion due toward  Drew Remsen, it is better that Mr Stone should know it, and see what he can  learn about it. You see that as I do, don&rsquo;t you, Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is true,&rdquo; Christine  answered her husband, as she often did. &ldquo;But, Mr Stone, whatever you do by way  of investigating these stories about Drew Remsen, can&rsquo;t it be done secretly&mdash;I  mean, privately? Must everybody know all about our affairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that, too,&rdquo; and Renny  smiled at Stone. &ldquo;And after all, Drew Remsen isn&rsquo;t our affair. Can&rsquo;t you just  go to him, Mr Stone, and ask him to tell you the truth? I know you can depend  on his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always do I get my information  from a man&rsquo;s words, Mrs Talbot. But a man&rsquo;s expressions of face, gestures of  hands or fingers, sudden silences or hesitations are all as indicative as his  words. I shall see Mr Remsen, and learn what I can from him. You see, Mr  Loring, I have talked with no one as yet, outside the family. And I have not  yet seen the police. There is much questioning to be done before I can form  definite opinions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy you&rsquo;ll get your  questioning done and form your opinions in short order, once you get started. You  have a quick mind, and with your experience, I feel sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Stone took little interest in  Christine&rsquo;s sure feelings, and he gently interrupted her, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Loring, I want to ask you and  your husband a few questions, not in the presence of your sister. Mrs Talbot,  will you run along home, and tell Mrs Golder I will be there by lunch time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny was quite willing to do  this, for she felt little interest in Christine&rsquo;s fancies, and she was glad to  go off by herself.</p>
<p>Her life was not at all happy at  present. She had tried picking up old acquaintances that she had dropped since  her marriage, but while they were kind and gay, they kept referring to the  tragedy, or, worse, talking to her about Drew Remsen, and she longed for the  time when she could go away somewhere. Even a trip with Christine would be  better than this lonesomeness.</p>
<p>She idly wondered what Mr Stone  wanted to talk to her relatives about. But she didn&rsquo;t care much, and she walked  back home without meeting anyone she knew.</p>
<p>Mr Stone knew very well what he  wanted to talk to the Lorings about and he began at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would tell me if there  is the least reason to consider the matter of Mr Talbot&rsquo;s first marriage, in  connection with his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have often fancied that there  might be something of that sort,&rdquo; Christine said, &ldquo;but when I mention it, Byron  won&rsquo;t listen to such an idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Byron agreed,  &ldquo;since it is only an idea. Only one of your fancies, Christine, with nothing at  all to base it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did either of you know Mr  Talbot&rsquo;s first wife&rsquo;s people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; and Byron smiled. &ldquo;You  see, Talbot was twenty years older than Renny, and thirteen years older than I  am. Talbot comes of an old Southern family, and the girl, who was three years  older, practically kidnapped him. He married her all right, but his father took  the matter in hand, and easily bought off the girl&rsquo;s father, and secured a  divorce for the young couple. It was quickly hushed up, and when Talbot asked  me for Renny&rsquo;s hand, he very honorably told me all about it, and asked if I  didn&rsquo;t think we might continue to keep it a secret from her. I certainly did  think so, and how Renny first learned of it, I&rsquo;ve no idea. But somehow she did,  and she asked Nick, and he told her the truth. I don&rsquo;t think she minded it specially,  and I&rsquo;m very sure she never told anyone about it, until Inspector Craven asked  her if Nick had been married before. It was a natural enough question, it seems  to me, and I think it need go no further. But, when you speak of the family of  the girl in connection with Nick&rsquo;s murder, are you following up anything you  have heard about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all definite. I am  forty-six, myself, and I have an indistinct recollection of reading, a good  many years ago, a story of a happening like that you tell of. It was in  Charleston, and I was down near there at the time, and it may or may not have  been the same case. I remember the name of the girl was Prall, but I didn&rsquo;t  remember the man&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s the same case, then,&rdquo;  Byron told him. &ldquo;The girl Nick married was a Prall. But she died within a year  of their divorce, and I can&rsquo;t see any reason for digging up the matter unless  you have some real facts to go upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t. And I do not propose  to dig up the matter. But I do not feel it quite right to forget it entirely.  Rest assured, however, that I shall not mention it without using the utmost  discretion. And may I ask you both to keep the matter a secret. Did you mention  it to Renny, Mrs Loring, before she asked her husband about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christine said nothing for a  moment, and then, remembering that Renny might have told Stone she did, she  said, with an attempt at carelessness, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember doing so, but&mdash;I may  have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Christine,&rdquo; her husband  exclaimed, &ldquo;you know I told you emphatically, not to let Renny know! How could  you do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I did, I can&rsquo;t  remember everything! And as Mr Stone said, it can&rsquo;t make any difference now  that the girl is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite say that,&rdquo; Stone  said, gravely. &ldquo;You know those Southern families have strange notions of  revenge and sometimes their hate lasts for years. I shall most certainly look  into it. If you were so anxious to keep the matter quiet, Mrs Loring, why did  you speak of it to your sister-in-law at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy I have a right to speak  to my family as I choose,&rdquo; and Christine tried to make a laughing voice take  away any serious intent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t speak of it to  anyone else, or to Renny again. Such hints, however slight, fly like the winds  and scatter trouble oftener than you&rsquo;d think. Mr Loring, do you think Mr Rudd  knows more about this matter than you do? I mean of any possible late  developments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea, Mr Stone; I&rsquo;ve  never mentioned it at all to Rudd. But doubtless, he knows all about it, though  it happened before he and Talbot became such inseparable friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine man, it seems to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is an exceptional man. Not  brilliant, not even talented, but a wonderful friend; staunch, loyal, true and  devoted. I truly believe if Rudd had had the chance he would have laid down his  life for Nick&rsquo;s, if it could have been done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe Talbot saved him from  some trouble&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s too long a story for  full details, just now, but Rudd was absolutely innocent, proved so, by Nick&rsquo;s  exertions. Had Nick not taken up the matter Rudd would have been imprisoned for  ten years. Embezzlement it was, and the clever villain that did it was so  diabolically smart, that he made it appear to be Rudd&rsquo;s wrongdoing, and only  Talbot was shrewd enough to see the truth and save Rudd. They were all in the  same building, a big drug manufactory, and all had great responsibilities, and  great opportunities for deviltry. But Talbot saw through the villain, and acted  just in time to set things right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the bad man, what became of  him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean, but no  chance. He was put in prison, and died there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick told me. But you can&rsquo;t think  that he wasn&rsquo;t dead, and after all these years he got out and came up here and  killed Nick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up here? Was all that in  Charleston, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was in some Southern  state, but I forget which one&mdash;if I ever knew. Go to Rudd for all that data. But  I feel sure he knows all the details of the bad man&rsquo;s fate, and if he could  have any suspicion of his killing Nick, he would have told of it by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, no doubt. Well, if I&rsquo;m going  to make good my promise to be home at lunch time, I must go now. Good morning,  Mrs Loring; do come to see Renny occasionally, she is very lonely these days.  Good day, Loring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone walked away, feeling sure  that he had left an angry husband and a delinquent wife behind him, but he  couldn&rsquo;t help it. And if what had been said should have the result of  preventing Christine&rsquo;s further revelations of Talbot&rsquo;s earlier life, it was all  to the good.</p>
<p>He was walking quickly but he  heard even more rapid footsteps behind him. Then somebody caught up with him,  and a young man fell into step as he joined him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Andrew Remsen,&rdquo; said a  pleasant voice, &ldquo;and I want to know Mr Fleming Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone gave him a quick glance  before he answered. He liked the man&rsquo;s voice, he liked his smile, but there was  something about his manner that seemed a little forward, and that was a trait  Stone did not like. Remsen caught it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m fresh,&rdquo; he said,  and his manner was courteous. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to be, but I sort of felt if I  waited to be introduced to you, I might wait a long while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t want to wait? Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I be frank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I know you are here  to look into the mystery of Nick Talbot&rsquo;s death. And I know that sooner or  later you will want to quiz me on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why the haste in that  matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are several reasons. One is  that when I expect an unpleasant session, I like to have it and get it over.  Another is, that if you quiz me as I suppose you intend to do, I may give you  some information that will help you or save you some trouble. Shall I go on, or  do you want me to leave you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to leave me in about  one minute, for I promised to be at the Talbot house at luncheon time, and here  we are at the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can make an appointment, I  will give you the interview you ask for.&rdquo; Stone spoke more genially now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you! You fix the time  and place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time tomorrow? In the  afternoon? Now you say where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come to my home? I have  a pleasant back veranda, all my own, and we can stay there until we get tired  of one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me. Are you prompt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the dot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us say three o&rsquo;clock,  sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Righto! Good morning, Mr Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were just at the Talbot gate,  and Stone went in, while Remsen cast an envious glance after him. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in the world were you walking  home with?&rdquo; asked Trask, as Stone came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A young fellow named Remsen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought. Where did  you pick him up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He overtook me on the road, and  we came along together. He seems a pleasant sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Renny. &ldquo;I like him a  lot. That is, I used to. But now he&rsquo;s engaged to another girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then keep away from him. Why, if  I were engaged to another girl, and you came along, now and then, that other  girl would soon get very jealous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr Stone, I&rsquo;d no idea you  could make such flirtatious speeches,&rdquo; Renny cried, laughing up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, is he really engaged to  this Miss Hanna or not? I hear different reports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Renny said, carelessly.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to tell when people are engaged and when they aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, ever since our school  days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cannot have been long ago,  for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You see I only went through  the Primary Department and then I knew it all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think you did,&rdquo; said  Stone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Stone Learns A Few Things</b></h2>
<p>Stone kept his appointment with  Andrew Remsen promptly, and the two, having settled themselves comfortably on  Andrew&rsquo;s vaunted back veranda, fell easily into conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had intended seeing the police  people today,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;but you came along and were so wheedlesome, here I  am instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police will keep,&rdquo; Drew told  him, &ldquo;and they don&rsquo;t know much any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they have interrogated me,  and in my opinion, they don&rsquo;t know how to ask questions in a way to get  information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in my opinion, they got a  good deal more information than you imagined they did. Policemen don&rsquo;t wear  their brains on their sleeves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew gave him a comprehending  look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in that. And  I&rsquo;m not really sharp, myself. Well, then, when you do see the police, you can  get from them a lot that they got from me, when I wasn&rsquo;t looking.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if it&rsquo;s worth while. I doubt  if they have definite suspicions as yet. The case does not look to me like an  easy one to solve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet the conditions are simple.  Renny Loring and I have been in love for years. Along comes Talbot, and gets  her away from me by reason of his great wealth and position and general  attractive qualities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I&rsquo;ll hand it to Nick for  affability, charm and, well, let us say, glamor. Anyway, Renny fell for him in  a minute, and she tossed me over and married him, before I realized what she  was about. Not that it would have made any difference if I had known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, you felt like killing  him or her or both?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And would have done so,  only I knew I&rsquo;d get caught, as I probably shall, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning you run a chance of  undeserved punishment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very strong chance. Everybody  knows how I felt toward Talbot for stealing my girl, and naturally, when he is  killed, they look round for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you under surveillance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure they call it that,  but I can&rsquo;t move without the police knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to move without their  knowing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to go to see  Renny, without being checked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still care for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I? Yes, Mr Stone, I do. And  I&rsquo;m sorry for her. She was bedazzled by Nick&rsquo;s money and power, and now she&rsquo;s  bewildered by all this trouble and publicity that has come to her, and&mdash;why, of course,  I still care for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Miss Hanna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remsen turned red, and looked very  much embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she understands,&rdquo; he  said, slowly. &ldquo;She and I are not definitely engaged, you see, and now that  Renny is free, she says that it&rsquo;s only right I should go back to her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d say she is well rid of  you! You throw her over for your old love, who has come back to you with a  fortune, giving not a thought to Miss Hanna&rsquo;s feelings in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew glared, but spoke quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think she could be happy,  married to me, knowing that I loved Renny and have always loved her a thousand  times better than Ruth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; I only said that to see  how you&rsquo;d take it. And, too, you youngsters take these affairs lightly. I  daresay if a rich and glamorous man came along and offered for Miss Hanna,  she&rsquo;d throw you over for him, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not be greatly surprised. Yet  Ruth loves me far more than Renny does or ever did. You see the girls are so  different. Ruth is full of what I think are called &lsquo;good, sterling qualities,&rsquo;  and Renny is just a bunch of fascinations and contradictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lacking in constancy and  truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found that out already?  But, Mr Stone, I doubt you&rsquo;re so deeply interested in these young ladies. I  thought you came over here to see if you could cast me for the murderer&rsquo;s part  in the Talbot tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did; and I&rsquo;d like to ask you a  few questions about it, and get serious replies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you, exactly, when you  first heard the news of Mr Talbot&rsquo;s death? You were at the Fair, I think? But  just where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know. I was on the  dancing floor, but that&rsquo;s a big place. And, at that, it was crowded. I was  dancing with Gloria Adams, when I first heard someone say, &lsquo;Yes, a man has been  killed.&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t think anything of it, for I assumed it was some bit of  foolery, perhaps someone practicing a line for the play, and then, I heard it a  second time. I heard Trask say, &lsquo;Well, somebody is dead, and they say it is Mr  Talbot.&rsquo; I knew Trask wasn&rsquo;t fooling, his voice was frightened rather, and I  thought if anything had happened I&rsquo;d better look out for Miss Adams. So I took  her to her mother, and then I saw Mr Appleton get up on a chair, and I heard  what he said, and I knew it was true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, at first. I was sort of  dazed, and I looked around at the crowd, and they all seemed to be dazed, and  some of the girls were hysterical. And then I went to look for Renny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Ruth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth wasn&rsquo;t with me, I mean I  hadn&rsquo;t taken her to the Fair, and my first thought was of Renny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she was with Christine,  somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, the Fair  disintegrated. I think some people got away, though the police came soon, and  they were very strict. Everybody was talking, but it wasn&rsquo;t a noisy crowd. They  all talked in low, scared voices, and most of us were allowed to go home, after  we gave our names and addresses. But you&rsquo;ve heard the story of it all, of  course, and there&rsquo;s little to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard only what the family  have told me. But I can&rsquo;t expect to be told the things I want to know. Who is  your pet suspect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some outsider, of course. Someone  who had it in for Nick, because of ructions we know nothing about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business matters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Workmen&rsquo;s bothers, more likely.  Talbot was a most generous chap, but he had a strong sense of justice, and he&rsquo;s  had quite a lot of building done around the place, and I&rsquo;ve heard rumors of  dissatisfied painters or road-makers or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Talbot wouldn&rsquo;t have to do  with the workmen personally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno. I tell the tale as &rsquo;twas  told to me. And I sure have no suspect among the people we know. Banbury  Gardens residents are not murderers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Villains grow on every soil. And  I think I&rsquo;ll go along now, and thank you for your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically, yes. Maybe a few  mental reservations, but they may be wrong on my side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back, if I can help you  further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, indeed. And I think you  may expect me back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what did he mean by that?&rdquo;  thought Drew, as Fleming Stone walked away.</p>
<p>Inspector Craven had made an  appointment for Stone, and the detective wondered how he would be received. The  police of different places, naturally showed him different attitudes, and he  was hoping that the present officers would be to his liking.</p>
<p>He was not disappointed, for  Craven was of a cordial nature, and Sergeant Flint, being consumed with  curiosity to learn what the great detective was like, curbed the recitation of  his own beliefs and opinions.</p>
<p>Only those two were present, at  first, though others were called later.</p>
<p>The general facts known had been  mentioned and discussed, when Flint spoke out boldly, showing a trace of  impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve mushed these things over  and over, Mr Stone, till we know them by heart. I mean the carving knife and  the scarab ring and all those so-called clues. But what we want to get at  is&mdash;people. Not only who could have used the knife and who could have pulled off  the ring, but who did do it. That&rsquo;s the thing! And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m hoping you  can tell us, right off the reel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone was familiar with this  gambit. How often had a police sergeant, jealous of Stone&rsquo;s powers and insulted  at his presence, tried to annoy him by assuming that he had only to ask a few  questions and give them the answer to their problem. Unveiled sarcasm,  unpleasant innuendo had all been hurled at Fleming Stone by lesser detectives,  and he had become entirely undisturbed by them, and showed no annoyance at  them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; Stone said,  quietly, &ldquo;and it may take us more time than we think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understood you visited Mr  Remsen just before you came here,&rdquo; Flint continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Mr Stone, can you  have talked with him and not have felt sure that it was his hand that used that  fatal knife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I managed to accomplish that  feat, Sergeant Flint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sergeant looked at Stone with  such a contemptuous smile, that Stone said afterward, he was tempted to lay  down the detective business at once and forever. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re sure he was not the  murderer, already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I didn&rsquo;t say that. I  said, I do not feel sure that he was. I gather that you suspect him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I do! I more than  suspect him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector Craven hushed Flint with  a glance, and began to talk himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard, Mr Stone, about  the remark Remsen made, shortly before Mr Talbot&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. Is it indicative  of his guilt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, see what you think. It  seems that Renny and Drew Remsen were together somewhere in the Casino, and  somebody overheard them quarreling, or at least arguing. And as Remsen went off  and left her, he said, angrily, &lsquo;I must and will have you, Renny, no matter  what I have to do to get you.&rsquo; And then ten or fifteen minutes later, Talbot&rsquo;s  dead body was found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; triumphed Flint. &ldquo;What do  you say to that, Mr Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several things. First, who gave  out this story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came pretty straight,&rdquo; Craven  said. &ldquo;It was Mr Trask who heard Remsen make that speech, and he told it to  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stephen Trask, the man who lives  at the Talbots&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. And a fine chap he is.  He and Mr Rudd both live with Mr Talbot, and as Trask told that tale, you can  believe every word of it. I asked Rudd privately if he could corroborate it,  but he only said Trask hadn&rsquo;t told it to him. But he said he knew Trask for a  truthful man, and would believe anything he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Stone agreed. &ldquo;I can size  up character fairly well, and I give those two men their diplomas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s fairly certain, I  should say, that young Remsen did say that to Mrs Talbot, shortly before the  murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone looked at the Inspector, not  gravely, but with a glance that was almost quizzical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you read Detective Stories,  Craven?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What they call shockers or thrillers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not often. I get enough of murder  at first hand. But Flint, there, he&rsquo;s keen for them. He reads about a dozen a  week, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not as many as that, Mr  Stone, but quite a few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re well up in their  routine. Now, did you ever read one in which the penniless nephew has a quarrel  with his rich uncle, and someone outside the room hears the young man threaten  to do for his uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that was in &lsquo;Mortimer&rsquo;s  Threat,&rsquo; a bully book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you ever read one where a  man threatens to kill a woman&rsquo;s husband, because of jealousy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several. That was the plot of  &lsquo;Who Killed Moran?&rsquo;, I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Well, in these books we&rsquo;ve  mentioned, did the threatener make good his threat? Was the man who killed  Moran the one who threatened to do so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flint thought a few moments, and  then admitted that he could remember no story in which the man who made the  dire threat proved to be the murderer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t prove anything,&rdquo;  he said, in a grumbling way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor does your statement that  Remsen threatened to have Renny, no matter at what cost, prove that Remsen  murdered Talbot.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It goes a long way toward it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re in the Swiss  mountains and try to jump across a deep crevasse, and if you jump short and  fail to reach the other side, your going a long way toward it doesn&rsquo;t help  much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Flint left the room.</p>
<p>Craven laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind him,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a quick-tempered fellow, though one of the best. Now, see here,  Mr Stone, why don&rsquo;t you suspect young Remsen of this crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Principally because I think it  too soon for me to do that. I have talked only with the Talbot family and  Remsen himself, and you, and I think I need the opinions of more people before  I make a definite decision. I have only started on the case, I haven&rsquo;t even  been round to the Casino yet. Give me a few days, Inspector, before you demand  an opinion. I may come round to your Remsen suspect, and if so, Flint can have  the joy of arresting him. But we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone walked slowly back to the  Talbot house.</p>
<p>He had no suspect, as yet.</p>
<p>What evidence he had heard against  Remsen was insufficient for him to call the man a murderer. Of course, he would  look into the matter more deeply, and he might denounce Remsen after all.</p>
<p>Of Byron and Christine he had no  faintest suspicion, any more than he had of the occupants of the Talbot house,  from Renny herself, down to the newest scullery maid.</p>
<p>He felt an odd sort of  disappointment at the lack of possibilities, but there were still friends and  enemies of Nick&rsquo;s to be considered, and much more information to be gathered.</p>
<p>And there was Ruth Hanna. Not that  he had any reason to think she killed anybody, but she seemed a peculiar  personality and he might learn something from her.</p>
<p>And he couldn&rsquo;t entirely disregard  that speech of Remsen&rsquo;s that Trask overheard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  Fleming Stone Carries On</b></h2>
<p>That same evening the three men  sat in Nick Talbot&rsquo;s study.</p>
<p>This was a cozy room, between the  library and Nick&rsquo;s office. The office, of course, was largely Rudd&rsquo;s domain,  and all the necessary management of Talbot&rsquo;s investments and securities was  carried on there. Rudd had a competent stenographer, but no other assistant,  except as the lawyers came over now and then.</p>
<p>Many times Talbot had offered to  relieve Rudd of the work and responsibilities of his position, but his offers  were declined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I get so old I make  mistakes,&rdquo; Rudd would reply, &ldquo;then I shall resign, but not before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That time had not come, so  everything went on as usual, and when Nick&rsquo;s sudden death brought the lawyers  to look into his business affairs, they found at their disposal what they said  was the most perfectly kept set of books and files they had ever seen.</p>
<p>Rudd did not care for praise, it  was his nature to be exact and methodical, and for that very reason he was not  overburdened with work.</p>
<p>He had enjoyed the feeling that he  was of real help to the man he loved so well. Their friendship had been  flawless, and differences of opinion were argued out, always to the  satisfaction of both sides.</p>
<p>Their tastes were similar, but not  identical. Rudd was more of an outdoor man and belonged to the Athletic Club  and went hunting with friends in the Adirondack and sailing with friends who  had yachts.</p>
<p>Nick found pleasure in bridge  games and billiards, with just enough golf to keep him fit. After Nick&rsquo;s  marriage there was little change in these things. And when Trask came, the  general harmony continued. Each of them did as he chose, and the three men were  always ready to fall in with any plans Renny might make for them. But now,  Renny could not make plans for them.</p>
<p>Christine was very strict as to  what she might or might not do, and only just now had conceded that Renny might  once in a while have two or three of her friends in of an evening.</p>
<p>Not more than enough for a bridge  game, and not certain of the gayer young people whom Christine banned.</p>
<p>Of course, Remsen was among these  and some others who had been Renny&rsquo;s chums before her marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Christine had said,  and sincerely, &ldquo;but, dear, you have to be careful. I will not have you talked  about more than you are already and you ought to see this for yourself. I&rsquo;ve  been thinking about your having another woman with you, or perhaps Byron and I  might stay with you for a time. But Mrs Golder is a lady, and I can trust her  to do the right thing. She must always be in and out of the room when you have  company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she always is, Christine,  and she is really a perfect chaperon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. And the two men there are  not in love with you and never will be. Though be careful Steve Trask doesn&rsquo;t  court you for your fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. I want to be  proper and all that, but I do get so bored and lonesome. I miss Nick awfully.  Mr Stone is nice, in fact he&rsquo;s rather a chaperon in himself, but he&rsquo;s sort of  poky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to anything he tells you,  Renny. You don&rsquo;t seem to realize that dreadful things may happen yet. Keep  friendly with Mr Stone, whatever you do. And if you have a few friends come to  see you, never discuss things with them. If they show curiosity, don&rsquo;t ask them  again. Oh, I think Byron and I would better go and stay with you, or, you come  over here for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Christine, let me stay in my  lovely home. I&rsquo;ll do just as you tell me, and I won&rsquo;t flirt with anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not! Don&rsquo;t you know  you are watched all the time? If you go to New York in your own car, you are  followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I really!&rdquo; and a dangerous  smile came into the girl&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>But Christine could read her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re  thinking you&rsquo;ll go off in your car and lead your followers a dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny blushed, for Christine had  read her thoughts. &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that. There wouldn&rsquo;t be  much fun in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look for fun in your life  very soon, Renny. You are a thoughtless child, but you may have a very  unpleasant awakening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any more unpleasantness,  and you&rsquo;re not much of a comforter. Won&rsquo;t Mr Stone soon find out who killed  Nick, and then won&rsquo;t they arrest the man, and it will be all over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope so,&rdquo; and Christine  was moved by the pathetic little face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to New York some day  soon, and we can go to the Flower Show or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny didn&rsquo;t state her reaction to  this suggestion, but she left her sister-in-law, with a new resolve to be very  circumspect as long as it was necessary.</p>
<p>Her pleasure-loving nature  couldn&rsquo;t help looking forward to the time when all the police business would be  over, and she could take up her social life again, mistress of herself and her  home.</p>
<p>Rudd and Steve Trask would go  somewhere else to live, and as a widow she didn&rsquo;t see any need of a chaperon, but  anyway, Mrs Golder was all right.</p>
<p>On this particular evening, Renny  had asked three young people in for a card game, but she wasn&rsquo;t enjoying it  much. Nor were they, for it was hard to avoid the subject of the tragedy and  impossible to speak of it.</p>
<p>Across the house and far down the  hall, the three men in the study were far from avoiding the subject that filled  all their minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no reason,&rdquo; Stone said to  Trask, &ldquo;why I should not tell you that the Inspector told me of something you  overheard Remsen say, not long before the death of Talbot was discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he told it to you  correctly,&rdquo; Trask said. &ldquo;Repetitions are not always verbatim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know; that&rsquo;s why I wish you  would tell me the story yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I will. I&rsquo;ve mentioned  it only to Craven. Even Rudd hasn&rsquo;t heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, then; tell us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, then. I was looking  for Renny, as we were soon to do our Mexican dance together. The Casino has a  small stage, you know, and two tiny dressing rooms. They don&rsquo;t use it much, except  for musicales. So, for the Fair, they had put up four or five temporary  partitions, making sort of dressing rooms for the performers. I heard Renny&rsquo;s  voice coming from one of these rooms, it had no ceiling, and she was evidently  angry with somebody, but she was half laughing, too. She was saying, &lsquo;Will you  move away from that door and let me out of here!&rsquo; And the man she spoke to,  replied, &lsquo;I must and will have you, Renny, no matter what I do to get you!&rsquo; And  then she came out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I had stepped around the  corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She saw me,&rdquo; Rudd said. &ldquo;I  happened to be there, as she came flying out of the little room. She said,  &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Nick?&rsquo; and I told her that he had gone over to Van Dusen&rsquo;s house to  see some coins. And then she said she wanted me to do something for her, but  what it was I never heard. For just then some young men crowded round her,  asking her to dance and she danced away with one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who was it in the little  dressing room with Renny?&rdquo; Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since Craven has told you, it&rsquo;s  no secret,&rdquo; Trask said. &ldquo;It was Andrew Remsen. I didn&rsquo;t see him, but I knew his  voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him,&rdquo; Rudd told them. &ldquo;He  came out a moment after Renny had gone off to dance. But it seems to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What seems to you, Mr Rudd?&rdquo;  Stone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that I should want  more evidence than that, before I suspected a man of murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the circumstances,&rdquo; Trask  argued. &ldquo;For a man to say a thing like that, and then in about fifteen or  twenty minutes the one he threatened is found dead&mdash; well, it looks glum to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone looked at the two men.</p>
<p>The face of the younger one seemed  to show a scorn for any mind that would not immediately connect the threat and  the deed, and feel sure of the criminal.</p>
<p>But the older face, and it seemed  to Stone that Rudd had suddenly acquired a deeper line in his brow, and a  sadder look of compassion in his eyes, showed less certainty of the proof  offered, as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand how it strikes you,  Trask, but I don&rsquo;t see it quite the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you see it, Mr Rudd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love of Mike, Stone,  don&rsquo;t Mister me! I haven&rsquo;t been called Mr, except by servants or strangers for  years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Rudd,&rdquo; and Stone  smiled, &ldquo;then give us your view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can hardly be called a view,  it&rsquo;s more just a feeling. You see, young Remsen has been in love with Renny,  since they were schoolmates, and when she married Nick it hit him very hard.  But not hard enough to make him commit a murder, I&rsquo;d say. I didn&rsquo;t hear his  words, but as Trask tells them, they sound to me more like a burst of envious  anger than an intent of winning Renny by the dubious method of murdering her  husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with that,&rdquo; Stone  declared, &ldquo;and I think we must all agree that it was an impulsive speech, and  therefore not the result of a settled purpose to kill Talbot, for that he would  scarcely care to announce so plainly. But, at the same time, we have to allow  that Remsen had motive and opportunity, which usually count for something. I  suppose no one knows just where Remsen went after Renny left him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard anyone say,&rdquo; Rudd  told him. &ldquo;I went right on to the Cinema room then, and was only just in time  for the beginning of the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he sat next to Rip Harley,&rdquo;  Trask told Stone, &ldquo;so those two alibi each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use that word in my  connection, son.&rdquo; Rudd smiled at Trask. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need an alibi to prove I  didn&rsquo;t kill Nick, and it jars on me to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, I wish I  had an alibi myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you at the time?&rdquo;  asked Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dancing around with different  girls. But I don&rsquo;t know anything about the time, and the girls couldn&rsquo;t alibi  me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rudd is right, that is an  unpleasant word and has no use in connection with you two men. I&rsquo;d like to hear  Renny&rsquo;s version of what Remsen said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask her right out. Renny&rsquo;s a  straightforward little piece. She&rsquo;ll answer you willingly enough. Poor child,  I&rsquo;m awfully sorry for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all are,&rdquo; Rudd said, &ldquo;but  she&rsquo;ll get over it. And I mean no unkindness; but she is very young, and she  has an unbounded love of life and gayety, and after a time she will find  herself. Just now she is bewildered, and she has nothing to do that she likes  to do, and it makes her restless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Renny came along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; she said, looking  round the half open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Stone, putting on a  businesslike air, purposely. &ldquo;Come right in, we want you for a witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be it. Anything is better  than playing bridge with folks you don&rsquo;t like. Which is the witness chair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone pointed to a big easy chair,  and Renny put herself carefully into it.</p>
<p>She was all in white and made a  picture in the dark, deep-tufted chair, sitting stiffly, yet gracefully, as she  tried to look like a witness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not making believe,&rdquo; said  Stone, &ldquo;this is the real thing. Will you tell us what it was that Andrew Remsen  said to you as you left him in a small dressing room, the night of the Fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once, Renny almost lost her  poise. But only almost. She caught herself and then she opened her eyes wide at  Stone and was pleased to see that this almost made him lose his poise.</p>
<p>Having gained her advantage, she  spoke at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I will, as nearly as I  remember it. You see, Mr Stone, Mr Remsen is foolishly jealous of my husband,  and he bears me a grudge for marrying him, because he thinks I was engaged to him.  I never was, to my own mind, but anyway, the speech you probably mean is that  he said, &lsquo;that he would yet have me, no matter what he had to do to get me.&rsquo;  Now let me tell you, very seriously, Mr Remsen did not mean that as it might  sound. He was beside himself in jealous rage, and he forgot it the next  moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I know my Andrew. And  also, because, after I married Mr Talbot, Mr Remsen became engaged to another  girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Hanna?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those two really engaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I know, and so far as I  care. Those two are nothing to me, and as soon as you can get this case settled  up, I mean to go away where I shall never again see anybody I have known in  this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know positively nothing about  Mr Talbot&rsquo;s death that you have not told?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. What could I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was a quiver in Renny&rsquo;s  voice that clearly was not from grief or sorrow, it was distinctly a quiver of  fear.</p>
<p>Stone went, like Agag, very  delicately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might be some little thing,  that you forgot to mention. Mr Talbot had never expressed to you any fear of  violence coming to him, from someone who might feel anger toward him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, but if he had feared such  a thing, he would never have spoken of it to anybody. Nor would he really feel  fear. That man never knew what it was to be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet he had an enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A coward and a sneak. No man that  Nick Talbot ever knew as an equal would have struck him in the back! Would he,  Rudd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Renny. All Nick&rsquo;s friends or  acquaintances were decent people. If one of them had killed him, he would have  been struck from the front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think then, Rudd, that it was  some laborer or workman&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr Stone, or some leader of  those people who wanted to stir up some revolutionary trouble. That is the only  logical reason for his death that I can think of. I quite agree with Renny that  the angry speech Remsen made, meant nothing really. Young people of today think  nothing of saying &lsquo;I could kill him!&rsquo; when they mean just nothing at all. I am  not saying that exonerates Remsen, but I say that to my mind it is no proof of  crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Renny agreed.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all through with Drew Remsen, he has another girl, but I&rsquo;ll tell you right  now, Mr Stone, he never killed my husband.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  Miller Takes A Hand</b></h2>
<p>The next morning, Stone sat in  what he called his thinking room. He had a pleasant suite of rooms in the  Talbot house, and of them he liked best this small room which was fitted up as  an office or study, and where Fleming Stone was wont to sit and think over his  problems.</p>
<p>He had come to the conclusion that  this case of Nick Talbot was not progressing as rapidly as he would like, and  he felt he must get some new information. To be sure, he had been on the case  but a few days, but it was not going at a promising rate.</p>
<p>Miller came in then, and Stone saw  at a glance that the man had something he wanted to say.</p>
<p>Miller had been Talbot&rsquo;s valet,  and with some assistants, he also looked after the comfort of Rudd and Steve  Trask.</p>
<p>Now, that Stone was in residence,  Miller adopted him, and attended to his belongings and his wants in just the  capable but unobtrusive way that Stone was accustomed to get from his own man,  Kent. But this morning there was more on Miller&rsquo;s mind than valet service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Miller?&rdquo; Stone said,  helpfully. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is something, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see that. Sit down there,  and tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir. You know Mr  Remsen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andrew Remsen? Oh, yes. That is,  I&rsquo;ve met him; of course, I don&rsquo;t know him well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I do and I think I ought  to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell it, Miller. Go right at  it, and put it through as directly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;the police people, are  thinking Mr Remsen, maybe killed Mr Talbot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they have some suspicion,  but they are far from certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; and their suspicion is  because of something Mr Remsen said at the Fair, the night Mr Talbot was  killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know just the words, but  he said to Mrs Talbot that he would have her yet, no matter how he managed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the gist of it. Who told  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s general gossip, sir; more  than one person has told me. But never mind that, I want to speak of another  time, when Mr Remsen said almost the same thing&mdash;and I heard him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard Remsen say something to  whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Mrs Talbot &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the day they came home  from Mexico. That night, I was in Mr Talbot&rsquo;s room, fixing him for the night.  Mrs Talbot had been in the room but she had gone to her own room. The door between  was a little open, and I heard Mr Remsen talking to Mrs Talbot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he in her room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was outside her window, on a  little balcony. He had shinned up a porch pillar to get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear any words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, Mr Stone. Mr Talbot  couldn&rsquo;t hear them, he had stepped into his bathroom, and the water was running  into the tub. But I heard Mr Remsen say, &lsquo;You shall be mine, if I have to kill  him!&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he was speaking of Mr  Talbot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he was. And later Mr  Talbot heard him, and he called out, &lsquo;Come in here, Remsen&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Mr Remsen do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stepped over the window sill  and came on in to Mr Talbot&rsquo;s room&mdash;I saw it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knocked Mr Talbot down, and  Mrs Talbot screamed out, &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve killed him!&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr Remsen said, &lsquo;I hope I  have,&rsquo; and then he went back through Mrs Talbot&rsquo;s room, and out the window, and  slid down the pillar, and went home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was the result of all  this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed to be hushed up. I  don&rsquo;t know about that, but Mr Rudd can tell you. He came in while the two men  were fighting. He told Mr Remsen to go home and he told Mrs Talbot to go to her  room, and then he put Mr Talbot to bed himself, me helping, what I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why are you telling me all  this, Miller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it seemed to me I ought  to tell somebody, and I&rsquo;d rather tell you than the Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not have kept it to  yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Stone, if Mr Remsen did kill  Mr Talbot, this might be evidence against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want evidence against  him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only if he is the criminal. I&rsquo;ve  told you this because I know you will attend to it right. If I told the police,  they&rsquo;d make a rush at Mr Remsen and maybe arrest him offhand. But I know you&rsquo;ll  do the right thing, and I wanted you to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Miller. I believe you  acted on right judgment, and I will think it over before I do anything definite  about it. Are you staying on here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so. Mr Rudd likes my ways,  and Mr Trask puts up with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Trask isn&rsquo;t satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you know what the  younger men are. Mr Rudd, he&rsquo;s just like Mr Talbot, but Mr Trask, he&rsquo;s a bit  more for modern ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you told me your story,  Miller. You haven&rsquo;t told anyone else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul, sir. But it gives you  a sort of side line on Mr Remsen, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it shows how high-tempered  he is. But nothing in it to indicate that he killed Mr Talbot. However, I&rsquo;m  glad you told me about it, and I&rsquo;ll speak of it to Mr Rudd. We&rsquo;re going over to  see the Casino this morning, and probably Remsen will be mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fleming Stone had asked Rudd to  take him to the Casino rather than go alone, because he felt that the older  man&rsquo;s deeper feeling and wiser judgment might possibly be of some assistance to  him.</p>
<p>They went inside first, and Stone  noted the positions of the stage and the dressing rooms, the dancing floor and  the restaurant with interest, though they gave him no definite information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect to learn anything  from looking round here,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;but I like to know the scene. Is this  the Cinema room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and they stepped inside.  &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where I sat,&rdquo; Rudd went on, &ldquo;and that young Harley sat next to me. It  was an interesting picture, but I cared more to look at the new lighting  experiment. And, think of it, Mr Stone, as I sat in that end seat, my friend,  the only human being I ever really cared deeply for, was being killed not fifty  feet away from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have my sympathy, Rudd,&rdquo; and  Stone spoke earnestly, &ldquo;and I mean to do all I can to avenge that deed. Did you  know where he was at the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I supposed he was over at the Van  Dusens&rsquo;. He was, a few minutes before, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do you mind going with me,  outside&mdash;by the window&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where he was killed, you mean? Of  course, we&rsquo;ll go there. Come this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment, they stood looking at  the place where Talbot was struck down. It was roped off and small stones  indicated where the head and feet had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this little twig stuck in  the ground for?&rdquo; the detective inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where his ring lay. I  don&rsquo;t know why they make such a point of that ring, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me any  sort of clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor to me. A scarab, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a valuable one. The  police have it now. I never admired it specially, but Nick was fond of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was loose on his finger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but not loose enough to drop  off. I&rsquo;m sure of that. So someone must have pulled it off his finger, intending  to steal it, and then must have been frightened by the watchman&rsquo;s approach and  ran off without the ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it seems from the position of  the twig that the ring was found directly under his body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it seems so. Do you mind if  I go away, Stone. I can&rsquo;t stand it! You see, Nick was so powerful, so strong.  How could anybody overcome him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know it was somebody who  came up behind him. He had no chance to resist. Come on, Rudd, I&rsquo;ve seen enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you learned anything?&rdquo; The  two men walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing definite. But a few  things to think over. I do a lot of armchair work in my profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can succeed  here? I&rsquo;m no more revengeful than most, but I would like for you to find the  man who killed my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best! That&rsquo;s all I can  promise. Now, you go your ways, Rudd. I&rsquo;ve another errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They separated and Stone went to  call on Ruth Hanna.</p>
<p>He knew nothing at all of the  girl, but that she was more or less engaged to Remsen, and he greatly desired  to make her acquaintance.</p>
<p>Ruth was at home, and though  surprised, she welcomed Stone gracefully and they sat down in the living room  of the Hanna house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re the detective, aren&rsquo;t  you?&rdquo; and Ruth had a frightened look in her blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but detectives don&rsquo;t bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They come to visit nice young  ladies, and ask them questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do they expect the young  ladies to answer the questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hope they will, especially  if their answers will help people they care for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would mine do that?&rdquo; Ruth  whispered, and there was a quiver in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so. Is there anyone  you want to help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be glad to help anyone  who needed it.&rdquo; Ruth spoke calmly now, and rather seemed to resent Stone&rsquo;s  suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be frank, Miss Hanna. I  would like to ask you a few questions concerning Mr Remsen, if you are willing  I should do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am. What can I tell  you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, then, are you and he  engaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not a secret, but I  don&rsquo;t know myself, whether we are engaged or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems odd. Did he ask you to  marry him?&rdquo; Stone spoke thus bluntly, for he could see Ruth was under a mental  strain of some sort, and he hoped to help her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you say yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why is there any room for  doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I mean to break off the  engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Mr Remsen agree to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says not, but it must be  broken all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he is suspected of being  responsible for Mr Talbot&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; and Ruth&rsquo;s blue eyes seemed  to blaze at him. &ldquo;He never killed Nick Talbot! Who says he did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard anyone say so. I  am told it is a rumor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believe rumors? Is that  the way you do your work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may not believe a rumor, Miss  Hanna, but we have to make sure that it is false. That&rsquo;s why I came to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can tell you that it is  false! Drew Remsen has his faults. But a murderer! Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you so sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I know him so well. Is  there no one whom you feel sure&mdash;<i>sure</i> that he could not commit a murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do know a few people of  whom I feel sure in that respect. But tell me then, why you are not going to  marry Mr Remsen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he doesn&rsquo;t love me  enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure he loves someone else  better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Renny Talbot, I think.  And it seems to me you are wise not to marry a man who does not love you best  in all the world. Or even if you only think that is so. You would never be  happy with him. But make certain, Miss Hanna. Personally, I am not at all by  way of thinking that Mrs Talbot intends to marry Mr Remsen, either now, or in  the future. I am emboldened to tell you this, for I think you will understand  that I am only trying to help you. I like Remsen, he has fine qualities. And  though he is just now fascinated by Mrs Talbot, you would make him a far better  wife. You are not angry at my plain talk, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not. But I don&rsquo;t know why I  am not. If anybody else talked to me as you are doing, I should think he was  crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not crazy. I talk to you  straightforwardly, because I see that you can take it. Very few could. Now,  Miss Hanna, tell me why you are so positive that Remsen could not have killed  Talbot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I know him very well&mdash;very  well indeed. And I know that supposing he had done such a deed, he would not  ask Renny to marry him afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are entirely right,  and I think that is true logic. I do not think Remsen committed murder, but if  he had, I know he would not ask his victim&rsquo;s wife to marry him. You are a brave  girl, Ruth Hanna, to see that so clearly, and to tell me so plainly. And it is  the truth. And my advice to you is to stand by Andrew Remsen. He is going to  need your faith and loyalty if he is accused of crime, and you must give it to  him. Believe in him, my dear child; let the matter of your engagement wait over  until things are settled. He will not want Renny, he will want you. I am saying  nothing against Renny, she is a dear and a sweet. But you are a woman and a  fine one and I am proud to know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You overwhelm me, Mr Stone, with  praise that I do not deserve. But I thank you for the help and courage you have  given me. I shall have to think it all over before I make any decisions, but I  am glad of what you have told me. Will you go now, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will go now, and God bless  you for a brave girl&rdquo;</p>

  A Very Slender Clue</b></h2>
<p>Fleming Stone possessed what is  sometimes called a photographic mind, but what is really a photographic memory.</p>
<p>It is of no great use to take a  mental snapshot of things you see, but it is often very useful to have a mental  cinema record of them.</p>
<p>And when the detective was in his  deepest dilemmas, he would sit down by himself, and endeavor to learn from his  store of brain pictures some hint that might prove helpful in his work.</p>
<p>The Talbot case was proving to be  a most annoying puzzle.</p>
<p>Stone had been over and over his  list of possible suspects without getting any new light on their possibilities.</p>
<p>He had no reason whatever to  suspect any person he had spoken to since he came to Banbury Gardens. Family,  friends and neighbors alike, gave him no smallest, tiniest point on which to  hang the faintest suspicion of guilt.</p>
<p>He was sure that Andrew Remsen had  not committed the crime, and he was about to begin an intensive campaign of  investigation among the laboring men. He had learned from the police that,  while it was kept down, and was dealt with secretly, there was a rising spirit  of rebellion and antagonism between workmen and employers that might, at any  time, break out in an overt act.</p>
<p>But to Stone&rsquo;s mind, it didn&rsquo;t  make sense.</p>
<p>Nicholas Talbot had not been  overbearing or belligerent in his attitudes, although his overseers and even  his lawyers had been obliged to settle some alleged grievances.</p>
<p>Nor could he think of any reason  why Talbot&rsquo;s friends or acquaintances should have enmity for him.</p>
<p>Stone was sure the crime was the  result of some old-time episode which Talbot had thought forgotten, and which  suddenly brought him the vengeance of a forgotten or a scorned foe.</p>
<p>With Talbot&rsquo;s life before he  married Renny, Stone was entirely conversant. Beside all that Rudd had told  him, and all that Byron Loring had related, Stone had received information from  a famous and far reaching Detective Agency, which guaranteed Talbot&rsquo;s life  upright and blameless from all sins against law and order.</p>
<p>It corroborated in full the story  of Rudd&rsquo;s unjust accusation of wrong doing, and of Talbot&rsquo;s earnest and  successful efforts to prove his friend&rsquo;s innocence.</p>
<p>Nor were these plain facts all  that Stone had learned. Other and far more private agents had delved into the  personal affairs of the two men, and had given them a clean bill of decency and  honor.</p>
<p>Talbot&rsquo;s early marriage was  recorded, exactly as Stone had already heard it told.</p>
<p>In fact he proved to his own  satisfaction that the friendship of the two men was just what it seemed,  gratitude and devoted service on one side and appreciation and a fine  friendship on the other.</p>
<p>Then had come Renny.</p>
<p>Reason seemed to point to the fact  of Renny&rsquo;s arrival as a possible factor in the murder of Nicholas Talbot.</p>
<p>But unless that meant Remsen was  the murderer, it seemed to Stone to mean nothing. Doubtless Renny had had any  number of admirers before her marriage, but no one of them had been mentioned  in connection with the crime.</p>
<p>To be sure, an undiscovered and  unsuspected murderer was a possibility but far from a probable fact.</p>
<p>The only loophole for such a  suspicion to get in, was the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>Anybody so minded could have  waylaid Talbot on his arrival at the Casino after coming from the Van Dusens&rsquo;  house.</p>
<p>Stone&rsquo;s reconstruction of that  scene proved to him that Talbot came alone, and that he paused to look in at  the window, doubtless to see if the dance was yet in progress.</p>
<p>Anybody could have been in  waiting, with the knife in readiness, and could have stabbed Talbot from the back,  as he stood watching.</p>
<p>In such case, he would have  fallen, just as he did, and the murderer could have gone his ways unseen.</p>
<p>This mental picture Stone was  studying, as he sat thinking.</p>
<p>And as he saw it, he said to  himself, if that&rsquo;s all there is to it, what about the ring?</p>
<p>Plenty of suppositions; that  Talbot hit out at his attacker, and the ring, being loose, fell off. Again,  that Talbot fell, and the greedy criminal tried to rob the dead of the only  valuable in sight.</p>
<p>But these thoughts did not appeal  to Stone.</p>
<p>He wanted a more definite and  convincing reason for the presence of the ring where it was found.</p>
<p>He had learned the history of the  ring; Talbot had bought it in Egypt. It was guaranteed to have been taken from  the tomb of Tutankhamen, but Nick had always declared that he took the guaranty  with a grain of salt. He was willing to agree that it <i>might</i> have been a  possession of the great monarch, but he would not agree to any such certainty.</p>
<p>Experts had opined both for and  against, but Talbot only laughed and wore the ring without care as to its  origin. It was a fine scarab and that was enough.</p>
<p>Stone kept on wondering how the  ring was transferred from its wearer&rsquo;s finger to the ground, and suddenly he  had the glimmer of a gleam of an idea. But it was so vague, even nebulous, that  he turned his mind to more rational thoughts.</p>
<p>That fellow, Harley, now,&mdash;he, the  police had said &mdash;was terribly interested in Rudd&rsquo;s ring, the cat&rsquo;s-eye. But  that was no reason why he should be interested in Talbot&rsquo;s ring. Yet a scarab  was as valuable as a cat&rsquo;s-eye, and sometimes more so. A wild-goose chase, of  course, but Stone decided he would like a chat with Harley. The thing was to  find the man, for he had made only a short visit in the Gardens, and had long  since departed.</p>
<p>But as Stone mused there came to  him a feeling that the name was not entirely strange to him.</p>
<p>Where have I known Rip Harley? he  thought, the remembrance of the name growing more clear.</p>
<p>I have never known him, but I have  seen him, or heard of him, in some especial way. Oh, Memory dear, do come along  and help me now! I am positive I saw Rip Harley in some play&mdash;or&mdash;some parlor  entertainment.</p>
<p>Barbara! Barbara!!</p>
<p>Who is Barbara, what is she, that  I connect her with Rip Harley? Was he, or is he a movie actor?</p>
<p>But those two names I saw  together, I most surely did, in a newspaper I was reading&mdash;where!&mdash;when?</p>
<p>No, it wasn&rsquo;t a newspaper, it was  a smaller sheet&mdash; sheet of music? No. Programme? That&rsquo;s it! I certainly remember  seeing the names of Rip Harley and Barbara on the same page&mdash;now, what&rsquo;s the  name of that Shaw play? <i>Major Barbara!</i> It must have been some private  theatrical or something of the sort. Harley isn&rsquo;t an actor, or I should have  heard of it.</p>
<p>And I was in some very smart  place&mdash;a big house&mdash; lots of rooms, lovely gardens, gay people. Did I go to the  play? No, or I should remember it better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen Major Barbara on the  stage, with real players&mdash;this must have been an amateur show.</p>
<p>I can see the paper as clearly as  if it were in front of my eyes now! Barbara was in much larger letters than  Harley, and there was quite a list of names&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t seem right&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t  right.</p>
<p>What other Barbaras do I know?  Barbara Frietchie. No, I can&rsquo;t connect her with Rip Harley. Wonder what the  chap&rsquo;s real name is.</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s Chesterton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ballad  of Saint Barbara.&rdquo; A gruesome thing as I remember it. And small chance of  Harley being mixed up with that.</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;oh, thank you, thank you,  Memory dear, at last I have it! Yes, yes,&mdash;Santa Barbara, not Saint Barbara!</p>
<p>And I know just where I was! At  the beautiful Hotel Samarkand, with its fairy-like flower gardens and picture  pools. It all comes back to me.</p>
<p>And a very simple connection.</p>
<p>I was reading, not a programme,  but the leaflet published by the hotel, and of course, there was Santa Barbara  up at the top, and under it a list of the new arrivals that day, and in that  list was Richard Harley, and I&rsquo;ve heard up here that Rip&rsquo;s name is by rights,  Richard.</p>
<p>But, after all, what does it get  me?</p>
<p>Perhaps, just a very small  perhaps, I can learn what I want if I take a run down to Santa Barbara. How I&rsquo;d  love to do that! But not at this crisis. When, as and if I ever get a vacation  that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll go, though.</p>
<p>It is lovely, and the old mission  and all the picturesque alley-ways&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad I thought of it.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t go now. After all, I  doubt Rip Harley would help me much. I almost wish I hadn&rsquo;t got that little  germ of an idea in the back of my mind. It can&rsquo;t be true, I must give over  thinking of it. I wonder if there is a link who can tell me where Harley got  his nickname. And why do I want to know? But I do. Wonder if Trask would know.  I&rsquo;ve asked him about it, but maybe Santa Barbara would stir his memory.</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;ll do it myself. I&rsquo;ll get  the hotel on long distance&mdash;very long!</p>
<p>It took some time, but at last  Fleming Stone was connected with the night clerk of the Hotel Samarkand in  Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>His first questions brought  informative answers.</p>
<p>Yes, the night clerk was well  acquainted with Mr Harley, and also, he was ready and willing to talk.</p>
<p>Yet the conversation was not a  long one. When Stone asked the question as to how Harley came by that odd  nickname, the voluble clerk said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure, but it was  while he was in college. He was fond of staying up late nights, and therefore,  was often sleepy or drowsy in his classes the next day. His chums exaggerated  this trait, and called him Rip Van Winkle, and the name stuck. He&rsquo;s a  first-class feller, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m told so by many. Well, I  guess I&rsquo;ll drop off the wire. It&rsquo;s two A. M. by my watch, though I suppose your  timepieces are all about eleven o&rsquo;clock last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what they are. We have a lot  more time than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but do you improve it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t improve anything in  Santa Barbara!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree to that! And I&rsquo;ll be out  there as soon as I can get around to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late though it was, Miller was  waiting to put Stone to bed, and he told him that Mrs Talbot and Mr Trask had  gone out and had not yet returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty late,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;but  Mrs Talbot needs no chaperon. I would speak to her brother about it, but he has  no rule over her. And she carries a sound head on her pretty shoulders. I say,  Miller, give me an extra nap in the morning. Don&rsquo;t disturb me before nine,  anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miller disappeared and Stone fell  asleep at once.</p>
<p>But when, it seemed to him, he had  been in bed less than five minutes, he was conscious of somebody shaking his  arm to waken him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemmelone,&rdquo; he remarked, more in  sorrow than in anger. &ldquo;You know I told you, Miller&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, I know, but listen here,  sir. You must get up at once. Here sir, put on your clothes as I pass them to  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be damned if I will. What  time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just gone six, sir. Now, Mr  Stone, just listen. Mr Trask is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook himself out of bed, and  took his clothes as Miller handed them to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he said next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the floor, sir, in his own  bathroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run along, Miller, I&rsquo;ll get  myself there. They may need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Miller tarried and then took  Stone to the scene of the tragedy.</p>
<p>The little room seemed full of  people, but Stone passed them. He knelt by the contorted body of Stephen Trask,  bent his face over the dead face and said, &ldquo;Cyanide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the police made their  appearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
  Inquiries And Opinions</b></h2>
<p>Stephen Trask&rsquo;s pleasant suite of  rooms, held a bedroom, dressing room and bath, and, also a spacious and well  furnished sitting room, which Trask called his playroom.</p>
<p>It was in this room that Inspector  Craven and his Sergeant Flint, held their inquiry.</p>
<p>Both these men felt an  embarrassing need for &ldquo;the man of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Talbot was not visible, and  Craven sent an imperative message to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do go, Miller,&rdquo; he said, for he  knew the valet, &ldquo;to Mrs Talbot&rsquo;s room, and ask her to come here at once. If she  is not ready, bid her come as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miller went on his errand, and  Craven looked at his audience.</p>
<p>It was small, consisting only of  Rudd, Fleming Stone and a troubled looking man who wore the blue denim garb of  a workman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who first discovered Mr Trask&rsquo;s  body?&rdquo; Craven asked, looking at this man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I did, sir,&rdquo; he made  answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the janitor and electrician,  sir. My name&rsquo;s Swenson, and I have all charge of the electricity, heating, air  conditioning and such matters for the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what time did you find Mr  Trask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Musta bin just after five  o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing up in the  rooms at that hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swenson looked a little offended,  but he said, respectfully enough, &ldquo;It is part of my duty to keep an eye on the  plumbing fixtures and such things, and if I&rsquo;ve a washer to put on in the  private bathrooms, I do it at an early hour, when I know I won&rsquo;t be bothering  anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right?&rdquo; asked Craven, looking at  Rudd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly right. I have nothing  to do with household matters, but I have often seen Swenson around in the halls  as early as five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you, then, an early riser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, at times. You could  meet me in the halls at all sorts of odd hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an astronomer, Inspector,  and on occasion I view the heavens to see what the planets are up to now. The  great windows in these halls offer fine views to a student of astronomy, and I  enjoy them greatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you around studying the  planets last night, Mr Rudd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they are staging no great act  just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; and Craven turned back to  the janitor. &ldquo;When you entered Mr Trask&rsquo;s bathroom&mdash;you found him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you see him now, sir.  Crumpled all up, like. I was that dazed, I couldn&rsquo;t think what to do. I  couldn&rsquo;t refer the matter to Mrs Golder, as we do most things. So I went to Mr  Rudd&rsquo;s rooms and I woke him up and told him. He put on his dressing gown and  went back with me, and then he said, &ldquo;Get hold of Miller, and then tell him to  bring Mr Stone. So I did, and then I was dismissed. But they told me to stand  by, so here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was the last person to see Mr  Trask alive, last evening?&rdquo; Craven asked, generally.</p>
<p>It was Rudd who replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last evening,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr Trask  and Mrs Talbot went to a party together. I do not know at what time they came  home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Talbot is the person I want  to see!&rdquo; Craven said, &ldquo;and I insist that she be brought here <i>now!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minty came, then, bringing her  mistress. Renny looked very lovely, in a soft white frock. She was crying, but  she managed to open her eyes wide at the Inspector. But he had learned to  discount that performance, so it brought her nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mrs Talbot,&rdquo; Craven  said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I shall have to ask you a few questions about this new  tragedy that has come to your household.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Inspector, I am quite  at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you first learn of Mr  Trask&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When your message was brought me,  a short time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know of his death last  night, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he dead last night? Not when  I left him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what time did you leave him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very shortly after three this  morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two had been out together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a place called Lake Como. It  is a new and very beautiful skating rink. I was glad to see it. I do not go out  often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you walked home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is but a short distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you leave Mr Trask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We walked up the broad staircase  together, and then he turned toward his apartments, and I went on to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did not Mr Trask walk to your  door with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I believe he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then did you walk back with  him to his door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have done so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you in deep or important  conversation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I may say yes to that.  We were quarreling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An important quarrel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To him, not to me. It is one we  have often had before. Are these questions necessary, Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. Have you any  objection to telling what the quarrel was about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, yes, but if you insist  upon it, I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I must insist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Mr Trask was asking  me to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does not seem likely to lead  to a quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he has asked me so many  times, and I have invariably refused, I feel I have the right to resent his  insistence. It was not really a quarrel, of course, merely a tiff, such as we  have had many times before, on the same subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not wish to marry him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did not, and I told  him so as plainly as I know how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Talbot, do you know what  cyanide is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cyanide potassium? oh, yes, Mr  Trask often asked me to buy it for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you buy it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the chemists won&rsquo;t sell it.  And I daresay Mr Trask didn&rsquo;t mean it. But when I would refuse his pleas, he  would pretend he was going to commit suicide. He would say, &lsquo;Renny, run down to  the drug store and buy me a man&rsquo;s size dose of cyanide potassium! I must end it  all!&rsquo; When he got to that stage we both began to laugh. But I tried to buy the  stuff once&mdash;I thought I&rsquo;d call his bluff&mdash;and the druggist told me to try a candy  store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you quarreled with him last  night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because of his persistence.  Why should I be subjected to an annoyance like that, if I could stop it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But could you stop it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I told him last  night, if he asked me again, I wouldn&rsquo;t let him live in my house. I&rsquo;m sorry  now, that I was cross with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny broke into uncontrollable  sobbing, and Rudd spoke for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all true, Inspector.  Stephen adored her, and he has told me that he would never stop trying to win  her, until she actually married someone else. He had a very persistent nature,  and he just wouldn&rsquo;t give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Craven, though he  had never had an experience of this kind before. &ldquo;Now, Mrs Talbot,&rdquo; he went on,  &ldquo;Mr Trask&rsquo;s death was, beyond all doubt, the result of a dose of cyanide. Do  you suppose that he procured it himself, and took it purposely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said she, explosively.  &ldquo;Steve never did such a thing! His cyanide talk was all poppycock, all joking!  Of course he didn&rsquo;t kill himself! He was too fond of life for that. Why, he was  just going to buy a grand new car, and he had just decided to keep a valet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a rich man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More or less,&rdquo; said Renny,  indifferently. &ldquo;He was my husband&rsquo;s only relative. That&rsquo;s why he lived here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You enjoyed the party he took you  to last evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some. But I would not care to go  there again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The atmosphere was not exactly  what I am accustomed to. It was what is called a wild party. But I wanted to  try it once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as I understand it, you saw  Mr Trask alive for the last time this morning, a little after three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Renny nodded, and Craven went on  to ask each one present where he was at that time.</p>
<p>Both Rudd and Fleming Stone  declared they were in bed and asleep.</p>
<p>Swenson the electrician, made the  same statement. He said his working hours began at five, and he took all the  sleep he could get before that.</p>
<p>Minty said that Mrs Talbot had  come to her rooms, soon after three o&rsquo;clock, and though she seemed a little  tired, she was not cross or annoyed in any way. Minty had put her to bed and  she had dropped asleep at once. Then Minty had gone to her own room and had  gone to bed herself, not awakening until summoned by Miller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be possible,&rdquo; Craven  asked, &ldquo;for an intruder to have entered the house and have committed this  crime? Is there a watchman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be quite possible,&rdquo; Rudd  answered him. &ldquo;There is no watchman exclusively for this house. The town has a  police guard. Outside doors and windows are usually locked, but I&rsquo;d say a  determined marauder could force an entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that was the way of it,&rdquo;  Flint said. &ldquo;There can be no suspicion of anybody inside this house. The  servants are a fine class, and Mr Trask was friendly with all of them. He was  of a generous nature, and never imposed on their service. How about the young  men he was chumming with last night? Would you suspect any of them, Mrs  Talbot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know them well enough to  judge that,&rdquo; Renny said. &ldquo;I think the wicked man who killed Steve was the same  sort of man that killed my husband. Those bad people who make strikes and  things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to consider the weight of  the evidence,&rdquo; Craven said, a little sententiously. &ldquo;I can only state  positively that Mr Trask came to his death by means of poison administered  through the mouth at the hands of some person or persons unknown. I shall lock  up the bathroom for further investigation, and I must ask you all to remain in  the house in case of further inquiry. Go to your breakfast, now, those who  wish, and I shall ask your hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policemen were sumptuously  fared, and then Byron Loring and Christine came.</p>
<p>Rudd had sent for them, because he  deemed it the right thing to do. He had no desire to dictate or even to attend  to things, but he thought word ought to be sent to Renny&rsquo;s relatives, so he  sent it.</p>
<p>Christine&rsquo;s nature was the sort  that resents misfortune. Her first greetings to Renny showed a feeling that it  was all her fault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Renny,&rdquo; she said, in a tone  deeply reproachful, &ldquo;what have you done now, to bring trouble and disgrace on  the family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craven had hurried through his  last delicious cup of coffee, in order to hear what Mrs Loring had to say.</p>
<p>For he well knew that Christine  would not hesitate to suspect Renny of implication in this new disaster, if she  wanted to do so.</p>
<p>And down in the bottom of his  justice-loving heart, the Inspector himself suspected Renny Talbot. He took her  stories of the night before with several grains of salt, for he could not  understand why a marriage proposal should not be accepted or rejected as  definitely and finally as an invitation to dinner.</p>
<p>She had ample opportunity, that  was certain, and though motive might seem lacking, still, he remembered hearing  that Renny would inherit Trask&rsquo;s fortune, should he die unmarried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not sure about this, but  he had heard something of the sort, and it was doubtless true. To be sure,  Renny was rolling in riches already, but he had been told, as to those wealthy  ones, the more they had, the more they wanted. So, he wondered if he would find  a sympathizer in Christine.</p>
<p>But Renny took the situation into  her own hands.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes at Christine,  who was still under the influence of that gesture, and said, with the air of a  tragedy queen:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christine, one more speech like  that from you, and you go out of this house forever! How dare you say what you  did? <i>I</i> bring trouble on this house?  Do you mean that <i>I</i> killed Steve  Trask, Nick&rsquo;s relative, and my dear friend! Is there no one to take my part?  Byron, have you lost all love for your sister? Rudd, I am sure you will stand  my friend&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forever, Renny,&rdquo; and he crossed  the room and stood beside her. &ldquo;But quiet down, my dear,&mdash;nobody has accused you  of anything. You are nervously excited, and it won&rsquo;t do. Christine, can&rsquo;t you  be decent to this child, for once? Whatever you meant, you seemed to say that  it was Renny&rsquo;s fault that death has again visited this home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Byron came to his  sister, and put his arm round her. &ldquo;Chris didn&rsquo;t mean anything, Renny dear.  Forget it, we&rsquo;re all a little upset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Christine made no advances,  either apologetic or affectionate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your theory, Mr Stone,  about this new crime?&rdquo; Byron put his question with a slight air of patronage,  as who should say, &ldquo;Now, do some tricks for the ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am reserving my opinions, Mr  Loring. I do not make snap judgments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And quite right, too, Mr Stone.  Doubtless, to that you owe your brilliant success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said Fleming Stone,  and Byron Loring never had felt smaller in his life.</p>
<p>Then Christine asked Renny to take  her up to her rooms, and the two went off together, and Christine cried and put  up a generally fine show, and there was a making-up of sorts.</p>
<p>Loring made friends with the  Inspector, and Rudd and Fleming Stone went out on a side porch for a smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any sort of steer?&rdquo; Rudd  asked the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to call a steer&mdash;so far, I am  only counting up the things that <i>must</i> be true, and they are so painfully few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you know where to  start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  A Little More Evidence</b></h2>
<p>That afternoon Craven, with Rudd  and Fleming Stone looked over Trask&rsquo;s papers.</p>
<p>Stone was not surprised to find  them all in perfect order, for he had an idea that Rudd acted as secretary to  the young man, as he had to Nick Talbot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rudd said, when this was  mentioned, &ldquo;you see, I am a born secretary, I can&rsquo;t keep my hands off other  people&rsquo;s accounts and balances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craven nodded his head. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;Mr Rudd&rsquo;s aid was invaluable in settling up the Talbot estate. And  here is Mr Trask&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He picked up an important looking  document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Rudd agreed. &ldquo;Read it out,  Craven, it is no secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The will, in so far as it was a  will, for it was an informal paper, though duly signed and witnessed, provided  that in the event of Stephen Trask dying without having been married, and not  engaged to any lady at the time of his death, he bequeathed all his worldly  possessions to Mrs Talbot and to Mr Rudd in equal shares.</p>
<p>With the will was a notation,  describing his investments and holdings. Also it gave all information as to his  lawyer, his bankers, his Safe Deposit Box and such matters, in the most full  and clear manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good business man, Trask,&rdquo; said  Craven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With some assistance,&rdquo; Stone  added, smiling at Rudd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a pleasure to help the  boy,&rdquo; Rudd stated. &ldquo;He was so grateful, and quick at figures, too. Well, shall  we lock up Trask&rsquo;s desk, and give the keys to his lawyer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take charge of all that,&rdquo;  Craven said. &ldquo;Was Mr Trask a rich man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the Talbot tribe are rich,&rdquo;  Rudd told him. &ldquo;Now, I don&rsquo;t want what he has left to me, and I propose to  endow a school or something of the sort, that can bear Trask&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you want the money?&rdquo;  Flint inquired, with an expression of incredulity on his young face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have enough without it.  No one could live with Nick Talbot and not have opportunity to save. His  generosity was unbounded, and my own wants are simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rudd spoke sincerely and with a  far-away look in his eyes, as if thinking of his many years with Talbot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two were great friends,  weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Flint went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard you went with him on his honeymoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard correctly. I tried to  go in the role of courier or dragoman, or something of that sort, but those two  good sports set me on a pedestal as Friend of the Family, so I tried to live up  to that. We had delightful times, and I can be trusted to know the rules in  most situations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said Flint,  sincerely.</p>
<p>That afternoon, Fleming Stone, in  his pleasant sitting room, pondered deeply over the very small clue, which he  believed in, not implicitly, but persistently. He meant to carry on, until he  either proved his clue of value or was forced to the conclusion that it was no  good.</p>
<p>This meant some tall thinking and  some low-down inquiries.</p>
<p>He admitted to himself that his  idea was merely an idea, of no weight or measure, but it was a possibility. And  he had often seen a sprouting possibility flower into a solemn fact.</p>
<p>So he concluded to investigate  thoroughly his vague and intangible little clue. He could hope to get no light  on it under the Talbot roof, and he wondered how far afield his quest would  take him.</p>
<p>On his own private telephone,  which was safe from all intrusion, he made two or three calls, and then  prepared to go out.</p>
<p>He ordered the little car, which  was always at his disposal, and a smart young chauffeur awaited his orders.</p>
<p>But before leaving the house, he  went for a last look at the body of Stephen Trask. Flint unlocked the bathroom  door for him, and Stone asked to be left in the room alone.</p>
<p>Flint was very jealous of Stone,  not of his presence there, but he had hoped to learn some of his tricks. He had  visioned himself chatting with the great detective and flattering him until he  disclosed his methods and how he worked them. But Stone had seemed almost  ignorant of Flint&rsquo;s identity, and though always courteous, he offered no  opportunity for a chummy chat.</p>
<p>As Flint unwillingly closed the  door behind him, he saw Stone go to the chiffonier and from its top drawer take  a fresh handkerchief, presumably Trask&rsquo;s, and saw no more. Now, what in the  world would he do that for, the lesser and greatly perplexed detective asked  himself.</p>
<p>Evidently Stone knew what he  wanted. He knelt beside the dead man, looked into his mouth and using the  handkerchief wiped off the rather large and very well-kept teeth. Placing the  handkerchief in an envelope, he put it in his pocket and went down to the car.</p>
<p>He gave orders for New York City  as rapidly as might be, and Berman, the chauffeur, took him at his word.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful drive, and  Stone reached the city, refreshed and avid for further work.</p>
<p>He went first to a large chemical  laboratory, and by virtue of his well known name, received immediate attention.</p>
<p>He turned the handkerchief over to  the proper operator, and asked that it be carefully and thoroughly analyzed.</p>
<p>Sooner than he had thought  possible, results were put before him.</p>
<p>He was informed that there was  found upon the linen positive traces of cyanide and small quantities of tooth  paste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you tell me the brand of  tooth paste?&rdquo; Stone asked further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it happens, I can. Though it  is not possible in all cases. This is the Smiler tooth paste, patented about a  year ago. It was a success at once probably owing to its absurd name and the  picture of the very much smiling girl that advertises it. It is a good paste,  one of the best, and it has one small ingredient found in no other that I know  of. That is why I am so certain of my statements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone thanked him warmly, paid his  fee, and taking the report given him, he went his way.</p>
<p>His way led him to the Waldorf  Hotel.</p>
<p>There he found Mr Harley, who was  staying over a day or two between trains, as Stone had found out from Mr Van  Dusen over the telephone.</p>
<p>The young man was cordial and  pleasant and Stone told him frankly that he had come for information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just full of it,&rdquo; said  Harley, gayly. &ldquo;What do you want to know first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cast your mind back to the night  of the Casino Fair, when you saw the new process lighting in the cinema room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s back there, but I didn&rsquo;t see  an awful lot of the new process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Did you fall asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, who&rsquo;s been telling you tales  of me? Or do you know my name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re called Rip Van  Winkle, for reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right enough. And I don&rsquo;t mind  admitting that I did drowse in that hot, stuffy, dark little room! And I soon  discovered I&rsquo;d seen most of those films before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for drowsing,  then. Did you ever hear of Dave Fothergil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never did. Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he may have sat next to you  that night at the Cinema.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think so. Mr Rudd sat next  to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean on your other side. Mr  Rudd had an aisle seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right. I didn&rsquo;t  notice the chap on the other side of me. What did you call him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fothergil&mdash;Dave Fothergil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know the name. Never  heard it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t remember his  climbing over you and Rudd, to get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. Sorry&mdash;did you want  me to remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather&mdash;yes. But it doesn&rsquo;t  matter. You remember Rudd going out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. He just stepped out for a  second&mdash;right back. But Fothergil? Does he say he knows me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks you may not remember  him. He was with you in Santa Barbara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Samarkand? No, no, I don&rsquo;t  think so. There was no Fothergil there, to my knowledge. I always remember  names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no matter. Has anybody else  been asking you about Dave Fothergil climbing over you to get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Or, wait a minute&mdash;yes. Steve  Trask asked me something of the sort. Only he didn&rsquo;t say Fothergil, I&rsquo;m sure of  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard about Trask?&rdquo;  Stone asked, sure that he hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, what about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was killed last night, or  early this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! poor Steve. Was he in some of  those queer joints he favors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had been to Lake Como.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I advised him not to go to those  places. But he seemed to like them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t killed there, he was  killed at home. So far as we know. But we know little about it as yet. Read the  evening papers. I must go now, and thank you lots for your patience with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone returned to the car, and  bade the chauffeur go back home at once.</p>
<p>As Stone got out of the car, at  the Talbot house, the Inspector met him, and asked for a word with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Craven, come right  along up to my rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir; may we take  Flint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. What is it? a caucus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, go into that room, and  I&rsquo;ll be with you in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moment was a short one, and  Stone reappeared, with Miller, and, to the surprise of his guests, asked them  what they would drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W&mdash;we are on duty,&rdquo; stammered  Flint, but Stone shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and, too,  I&rsquo;ve had a long drive and I could do with a swallow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matter settled, Stone brought  out some fine cigars, and the three sat round a small table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;perhaps we  can get together on this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we want,&rdquo; stated  Craven. &ldquo;You see, sir, we know your powers and your reputation, and we feel  that you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craven was so utterly at a loss  how to choose his words, that Flint spoke up quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We feel, Mr Stone, that if you  know anything, you ought to tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone smiled at the young face,  timid yet determined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are inexperienced in the ways  of personal investigators, Mr Flint, if you think we discuss our findings. We  may do so, after results are reached, but seldom before. However, let&rsquo;s talk  the case over. You have your suspect, Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say I have. To my  mind nobody could have killed Trask except Mrs Talbot. She was having a  desperate quarrel with him, they were by themselves, late at night, she has an  ungovernable temper, and she is impulsive enough for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you think she killed  him?&rdquo; Stone looked grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She forced or persuaded him to  eat something into which she had introduced cyanide. Don&rsquo;t ask me where she got  the poison, I don&rsquo;t know. But a pretty woman can get anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very nearly true, but I  must ask you to dismiss Mrs Talbot from your mind as the criminal, for she did  not kill Stephen Trask. The cyanide was put into Trask&rsquo;s tube of tooth paste,  and when he brushed his teeth, he almost instantly dropped dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would have been a clever way  to do it,&rdquo; and Craven looked distinctly incredulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would have been the only way  to do it, and that is the way it was done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his brush and tube of paste  were found undisturbed on the glass shelf in his bathroom, we examined them  carefully, and the housemaid verified it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not examine far enough,  you stopped too soon. I have discovered the facts. I have no supernatural  powers, nor even superior understanding, but the poison had to be administered  that way, and it was. Of course, duplicate tubes and brushes were used. Earlier  in the evening the murderer replaced Trask&rsquo;s own tube of paste with the one he  had poisoned, and later, switched the tubes back again, and replaced the used brush  with a clean one. These things are all kept in stock by the housekeeper, and  are at the disposal of all guests. The Smiler tooth paste is used by all the  household, and is bought in quantities. We must deduce a clever murderer, for  the poisoned tube had to resemble the other as to how far down it had been used  and all that. All was attended to, and the facts passed unnoticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Stone told of the results of  the laboratory analysis, and his two listeners were, perforce, convinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;if you will  come over here tomorrow morning, and bring a couple of policemen on the side, I  think I can deliver the criminal into your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means the lady,&rdquo; said Craven  to Flint, as they went away. &ldquo;More than ever I am convinced that it was Mrs Talbot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  The Confession</b></h2>
<p>Next day the sun rose clear and  bright, but Fleming Stone woke, with feelings of sadness and depression in his  soul.</p>
<p>Never, in his experience, had he  felt such dread of what the day would bring forth.</p>
<p>He went down to breakfast, and  found Rudd still at the table. It was the habit of the men to breakfast  downstairs, while Renny followed her own sweet will. Sometimes she breakfasted  in her own rooms and sometimes she came down and sat at table with the men.</p>
<p>This morning, she appeared soon  after Stone, and sat beside him.</p>
<p>She looked like a flower in her  white frock, but she was thin and pale. Her troubles had told on her, and she  longed every day for Nick&rsquo;s strong, helpful ways and never-failing love.</p>
<p>She had made up her mind to one  thing. She could not endure the strain of another of those house funerals, with  its overpowering scent of massed flowers, and its mournful, wailing music.</p>
<p>Christine had agreed with this,  and Steve&rsquo;s funeral services would be held at the Mortuary Chapel, and he would  be buried beside Nick.</p>
<p>As she toyed with a cup of  coffee, she saw Byron and Christine coming to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are they here so early?&rdquo; she  cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I invited them,&rdquo; Stone said, &ldquo;and  I wish you&rsquo;d all come into the morning room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Renny and Rudd rose and  followed him, looking rather amazed.</p>
<p>But Fleming Stone had his work cut  out for him, and he was no shirk.</p>
<p>Byron and Christine were already  there, and then came the Inspector and Sergeant Flint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I invited these people,&rdquo; Stone  said, as he and Miller arranged the chairs a little, &ldquo;because I wish to make my  report. Mrs Talbot requested me to investigate the untimely death of her  husband, and before I had entirely done so, the death of Mr Trask occurred. As  I have discovered the killer of both these men, I must report to Mrs Talbot,  and I wish the rest of you to hear it also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I understand you have solved  both the murders?&rdquo; exclaimed the Inspector, and at Stone&rsquo;s nod, Craven called  out, &ldquo;Foster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A young man came in from the hall,  and his notebook and pencils proclaimed him an official stenographer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am infinitely grieved at the  report I must make,&rdquo; Stone began.</p>
<p>He did not sound as if making a  speech, or even a report, he seemed about to tell some sad story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;murder is a  crime and crime must leave sadness in its wake. I have found out, beyond all  possibility of mistake or error, who killed Mr Talbot and Mr Trask, for it was  the same hand that felled them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know so well, then tell us  who it was!&rdquo; Craven was not intentionally rude, but he didn&rsquo;t believe Stone did  know as much as he pretended, and Craven wanted to find out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you, in good time,&rdquo;  Stone returned, quietly, &ldquo;but first I want to give the criminal an opportunity  to confess. The murderer is in this room with us, and if a confession is  desired, it may be made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no response to this, but  everybody looked at everybody else.</p>
<p>Craven, who prided himself on his  ability to read faces, gazed at one face after another, round the small room,  but he was completely baffled.</p>
<p>Rudd&rsquo;s eyes, showed the same  honest, fearless look they always wore.</p>
<p>Renny&rsquo;s lovely face was startled,  frightened, alarmed, but showed no hint of guilt.</p>
<p>Byron Loring looked odd. He gave  the Inspector a furtive glance and then evaded his return stare.</p>
<p>Christine was in a daze.</p>
<p>It was hard for her to believe she  was in a murder case! That she, the fastidious society leader, was sitting with  policemen and detectives and&mdash;a criminal!</p>
<p>Craven sat in stern arraignment.  Nothing like this had ever happened to him before, and he couldn&rsquo;t foresee the  outcome.</p>
<p>Flint, eyes staring, lips parted,  looked like a half-wit, who could hear but not understand.</p>
<p>Stone went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The killer must have had motive  and opportunity. Everyone in this room had opportunity, but who had motive? You  do not know, but I will tell you. The motive was not a strange or unusual one.  The same person killed both Mr Talbot and Mr Trask. And, as is so often the  case with a second murder, it was committed because the victim had discovered the  criminal and so had to be silenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Trask was killed by the  introduction of cyanide into his tube of tooth paste. This was very cleverly  done. While Mr Trask was at the Lake Como party, the murderer went to his  bathroom and replaced his tube of paste and his toothbrush by others exactly  like them. Thus, Trask must put the cyanide preparation in his mouth. An hour  or so later, the murderer returned, found Trask dead, restored the original  tube and brush, and took away all signs of the crime. I know all this to be  true, and I offer the murderer another chance to confess, before I mention any  name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something to tell you,&rdquo;  Rudd said, looking round at the expectant faces, &ldquo;but I do not want to tell it  before these ladies. It is not a pretty story, but it is enlightening. Renny,  will you and Mrs Loring please leave the room, for a few minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impelled by Rudd&rsquo;s earnest gaze,  Renny rose at once, and Christine went with her from the room.</p>
<p>Rudd looked round at the men who  were his audience, and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my confession. I am the  murderer of both those men. You may take me on that simple statement, or, if  you wish, I will tell you my story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, for one, would be glad to hear  your story, Mr Rudd. I admit you have greatly surprised me, and I can&rsquo;t help  the feeling that you are trying to shield someone else.&rdquo; This from Craven, who  was very agitated, and who kept glancing toward the door through which Renny  had gone.</p>
<p>Rudd looked at the speaker calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;no, Inspector,  take your suspicions entirely away from Mrs Talbot. I alone am the evildoer. I  will try to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something compelling in  Rudd&rsquo;s attitude, something thrilling in his voice that arrested their  attention, and the men stared at him.</p>
<p>But he went on quietly, in a  narrative way, and they listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that  Nick Talbot and I were very close friends. He had saved me from prison, when I  was unjustly accused of a crime that I did not commit. For him I felt not only  the deepest gratitude but intense admiration and sincere affection. I am sure  there were never two friends more congenial than we were, or two who understood  one another better. There was no love in our relation, but a deep, firm respect  and friendship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Nick told me he was to be married,  I rejoiced for him and with him. I offered to leave his home, but he wouldn&rsquo;t  hear of it, and insisted that I remain as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then Renny came. I cannot  tell you what happened, but the first moment I laid eyes on her, I saw no one  else afterward. She, all unknowingly, took possession of me, I lived only for  the times I might be with her. I never showed it, that I am sure of, but my  life was absorbed in her. I was Nick&rsquo;s private secretary, I went on with the  work, no one knew my secret, and I vowed no one ever should.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went with them on their wedding  trip to Mexico. I was guide, courier, attendant, friend, all in one. But the  lure of the place was too much for me. The atmosphere, the flowers, the music,  the climate all played their parts, and my adoration of Renny turned to  passion. I fought it, I thought again and again I had conquered it, only to  find I had not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never knew, Nick never knew.  I could be sure of that from their natural unembarrassed attitudes. They both  felt for me the most perfect friendship and had no deeper thought toward me. I  trusted myself, I was sure I could carry on and never let them know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we came here to live, and I  saw Renny in her own home, a lovely chatelaine, a perfect wife, and&mdash; murder  entered into my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put it from me and it  returned&mdash;a thousand times I told Nick I must go away and live by myself. The  dear fellow only laughed at that, and had no suspicion of the truth. Renny  didn&rsquo;t love him, not as I could make her love me&mdash;and I had to have her. I knew  with Nick dead, she would turn to me, and I would charm her and win her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once decided, I turned all my  energies toward making it a successful murder, and had it not been for our Mr  Stone, I should have carried it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a man or a demon?&rdquo; cried  Loring, unable to keep still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; Rudd said, quietly, and  went on. &ldquo;Yes, I killed my chum, my pal, my friend&mdash;the only friend I ever had.  I did it cleverly, but, it seems not cleverly enough. How did you guess it, Mr  Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t guess, I thought it out.  I admit it was a difficult problem. But when you pinned your alibi so  definitely on the man who sat next to you in the Cinema room, and he declared  you had not left his side, I had to look into that carefully. And I found that  Mr Harley has a habit of falling asleep in a hot, stuffy, dark room, and  therefore he did not know it when you slipped out and carried out your deadly  plan, returning quickly, and unseen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was the way of it,&rdquo;  said Rudd, so calmly, that Stone wanted to strangle him, but he was not through  with him yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Stone said, sternly, &ldquo;and  by that time Trask was living with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And by accident Trask had  his suspicions aroused about me. He knew of Harley&rsquo;s habit of sleeping at any  uninteresting part of a stage performance and he put two and two together, much  as Mr Stone did, but not so positively and definitely. And, like the good  fellow he always was, he came to me with his story instead of going to Craven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I laughed at his fears and  convinced him of my innocence, but I knew he would not stop there and I  realized that he was a menace that must be got rid of. It had to be, and I had  to contrive this second murder right under the very nose of the greatest  detective of our time. And I did. I planned the perfect crime, but who can plan  against the perfect detective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone, who was watching Rudd  intently, took no notice of this speech and Craven, still bewildered, said:  &ldquo;Where did you get the cyanide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brought it from Mexico. You can  get anything in Mexico if you know where to look for it. And now you all see  why I couldn&rsquo;t tell this story before Renny. Her brother may tell her as much  as he sees fit of it all. But the less she knows the better. She has her life  before her, many happy years of it. And to save her further grief and shock,  and leave her with one less sad memory, I shall step out right here and now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only Fleming Stone realized what  Rudd was about to do, and when he saw Rudd&rsquo;s left hand go to his mouth, as his  right hand picked up a glass of water from the table, the detective made no  move. It was too late, and beside, Stone felt it was better so. It did save  Renny the pang of living through Rudd&rsquo;s incarceration and execution.</p>
<p>In a few moments the cyanide  performed its task and Caleb Rudd was a dead man.</p>
<p>Stone rose, gave a nod to Byron  Loring and the two men left the room.</p>
<p>They found Renny and Christine  waiting for them, and sitting down, Fleming Stone gave Renny his report in the  gentlest way he could command.</p>
<p>She listened, then gave way to a  crying spell of real grief, and afterward became calm and self-possessed.</p>
<p>Stone, his work finished, was  leaving at once.</p>
<p>Craven, full of curiosity, tried  to detain him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give you five minutes,  Inspector,&rdquo; the detective said. &ldquo;What is it you want to know? I must not miss  my train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you catch on to Mr Rudd&rsquo;s  affection for Mrs Talbot. He never showed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A passion such as he felt could  not be concealed from a close observer. The first time I saw them together, I  noticed his determination not to show it. He would turn his back sometimes when  she came into the room, happy and smiling, and behind his back I could see his  clenched hands. He tried to conquer it, but it was too strong for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to have gone away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he ought. And when he  suggested it, Talbot would make him stay. It is a strange case, but I  understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the knife that killed  Talbot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a knife from the house,  all right. Rudd could easily manage that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he carry it to the Fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked over his clothes. The  overcoat he wore that night has a long narrow pocket made to hold a knife. He  bought the coat in Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nobody caught on to that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody suspected Rudd. Nobody  investigated him. Another clue he gave me was his saving his seat stub in the  cinema room. I found out he never saved seat stubs, yet this was saved and  produced in evidence. Surely that pointed to an alibi! Oh, one has to notice  small things. I had to run down Rip Harley, and invent a mythical friend, one  Dave Fothergil, before I could be sure about his fondness for catnaps. Now, I  must go. Good by, Craven, and good luck to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same to you, Mr Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stone went thoughtfully up to his  rooms, found Miller had everything packed and looked after, and with a last  look from his windows out on the beautiful gardens, he went down to the waiting  car.</p>
<p>The three Lorings were in the hall  to say good by, and the parting was formal.</p>
<p>Then Christine led the others to  the drawing room and they sat down there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Renny,&rdquo; Christine said, &ldquo;for  the present you will have to come to us, or we will come here, whichever you  prefer. Here you are, with several beautiful homes, you are your own mistress  and you have all the money in the world. What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Renny, and she  opened her eyes wide at Christine.</p>
